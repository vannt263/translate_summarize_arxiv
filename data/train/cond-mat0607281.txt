    "upper panel - real part of @xmath0 from the fit of spectrum fig.2a .",
    "note the anti - resonant shape , with the minimum at the energy @xmath95 , while both amplitude and width are @xmath96 .",

    "for large energies , the pairing interaction , is @xmath98 .    lower panel - partial dos showing a sharp qp peak ( p ) , followed by the dip ( d ) at the higher energy @xmath2 .",
    "the _ derivative _ of the gap function , as in eq.(9 ) , reinforces the quasiparticle peak ( negative extremum ) and causes the dip feature ( positive extremum ) .",
    "2 mm    since @xmath99 is _ defined _ as the qp peak position , easily estimated from the data , we have the further condition that : @xmath100 , also illustrated in fig.3 . using ( 10 ) and ( 11 ) , this gives @xmath101 , or : @xmath102 as a constraint on the parameters .",
    "a second constraint is found by writing the dip position , @xmath2 , using the analytical expression of the dos .",
    "considering the extremum of @xmath103 leads to the good approximation : @xmath104 .",
    "therefore , taking @xmath2 and @xmath1 to be known , the fit to the spectrum of fig.2a can be done by the variation of only two free parameters : @xmath105 and @xmath7 .",
    "their final values determine the precise concavity in the dos , between the qp peak energy and @xmath2 , which is _ a priori _ unknown .    for the fit of spectrum 2a , using @xmath63 and @xmath64",
    ", we obtain the values @xmath66 , and @xmath65 , all in mev .",
    "the problem is thus simplified by the following outcome : @xmath106 = @xmath107 , with @xmath68 and @xmath69=2 .",
    "the corresponding function @xmath0 is depicted in the upper panel of fig.3 , with the partial dos along @xmath94 for direct comparison ( lower panel ) .",
    "one can see that @xmath0 has a minimum at @xmath95 , where its value is @xmath108 , then it increases towards the asymptotic value @xmath109 , when @xmath110 .",
    "note that the total amplitude of the resonance , @xmath111 , is identical to its width .",
    "in short , we obtain : @xmath112and we propose that these relations should scale when the carrier density , @xmath4 , varies ( section ii ) .",
    "the dip position , near to @xmath113 , is more precisely : @xmath114 so that @xmath115 .",
    "the latter parameter thus plays a fundamental role in our model .",

    "first , the @xmath116 introduced by dynes to treat a finite quasiparticle lifetime , artificially displaces the pole in the spectral function ( 8) off the real axis .",
    "it is equivalent to a lorentzian broadening of the dos , of full - width @xmath117 , affecting the states at all energies .",
    "consequently , in the lower panel of fig.3 , virtual states lie within the gap of the partial dos ( for @xmath118 ) . as we discuss in a recent paper @xcite",
    ", several factors can contribute to @xmath80 both intrinsic ( inelastic scattering , many - body effects , ... ) and extrinsic ( high - frequency noise , ... ) . in fig.2 ,",
    "the @xmath80 value was adjusted to fit the zero - bias conductance .    the qp peaks , as calculated using ( 10 ) , are initially higher than those of fig.2 .",
    "since @xmath80 is fixed , a second broadening parameter is introduced : we replace @xmath1 by a complex number with a small imaginary part , @xmath119 .",
    "this has a major effect on the qp peaks , but a small one on the remaining spectrum .",
    "intuitively , the imaginary part represents a smearing of the value of @xmath1 , such as in the case of gap anisotropy @xcite or doppler shifts due to supercurrents @xcite .",
    "while this ansatz is used to model the pseudogap in section ii , it has a negligible influence on the fit parameters deduced here .",
    "the fit to the bscco spectrum , fig.2a , leads to the simple result that the width , amplitude and position of the anti - resonance are all simply related to the quantity @xmath7 ; assuming @xmath1 to be known .",
    "the qp spectrum therefore depends on only _ two _ energy scales .",
    "this section is devoted to their possible link to the phase diagram : we infer how the parameters of the sc gap function change with the carrier density",
    ".    2 mm    _ doping dependance of the energies _    1 mm    the foregoing suggests that @xmath7 must have a new meaning . consider the asymptotic value of @xmath0 for large @xmath120 : @xmath121 for @xmath110 ( fig.3 ) .",

    "no evidence for a critical point is seen for @xmath1270.25 .",
    "3 mm    we now suggest that @xmath7 is tied to the condensation energy .",
    "the energy ( per pair ) of the sc state is then @xmath128 , with respect to the pg state , but it is @xmath129 with respect to the normal state .",
    "as will be discussed in sec.iii , the integration over energy states , involving the full @xmath130 , is necessary to obtain the precise energy changes .",
    "we can thus put : @xmath131 where @xmath132 is to be determined . from the fit of fig.2a , using @xmath133 k , and @xmath65 mev , gives @xmath134 .    with this result",
    ", one could use scaling arguments to infer the behavior of the parameters as a function of @xmath4 .",
    "however , in view of the dispersion of the tunneling and arpes data , using a single spectrum and one value of @xmath13 is restrictive .",
    "we take a different approach by first plotting in fig.4a a larger set of data of the qp peak position , @xmath1 . assuming that the critical temperature @xmath25 is known @xcite",
    ", one can deduce the linear behavior of @xmath72 by a quadratic fit @xcite .",
    "the data are from the sis ( sc - vacuum - sc ) break junction @xcite , which probes the electronic structure deep in the sample ; sin tunneling data , as well as arpes data , are included @xcite . the dip position ( @xmath2 ) , as seen in many different tunneling experiments @xcite ,",
    "is also plotted in fig.4a .",
    "the points evidently follow a continuous curve throughout the phase diagram .",
    "we propose to find this curve via a best quadratic fit using the gap function , which fixes all the parameters .",
    "the two energy terms are thus @xmath72 and @xmath135 where the best value of @xmath132 is to be determined . in order to calculate @xmath2",
    "we could use the previous condition @xmath136 , which led to @xmath137 .",
    "however , the spectrum fig.2b , from pan et al .",
    ", can not be precisely fit with the resonance energy exactly at @xmath107 .",
    "this is the essential difference between the two spectra ( 2a and 2b ) ; the latter dip position is slightly at a higher energy .",
    "from our study of ybco in @xcite , we noticed the resonance energy can be larger than @xmath107 . we thus write @xmath138 , in the general case , and determine the value of @xmath139 at the same time as @xmath132 .",
    "the expression for the dip energy is then : @xmath140 and all other parameters retain their previous meaning .",
    "putting @xmath72 and @xmath141 in ( 13 ) , and fitting the data of fig.4a , yields : @xmath142 , @xmath143 , and the continuous curve @xmath144 .",
    "the two values differ by about 5% from the single - point estimate and , considering the uncertainty in the data , the earlier observation in @xcite that @xmath145 is maintained .",
    "more significantly , we find that @xmath146 is consistent throughout the phase diagram , from underdoped to overdoped sides .    in fig.4a the total spectral gap @xmath124 , and the amplitude @xmath73 , are plotted as a function of @xmath4 .",
    "one observes that @xmath73 merges smoothly with @xmath72 on the overdoped side .",
    "consequently , @xmath124 is a smooth convex function of @xmath4 ranging from @xmath1 to @xmath147 . extrapolating @xmath144",
    ", it varies from @xmath148 to @xmath149 in the same range of @xmath4 . at optimal doping , @xmath150 ,",
    "the values are @xmath151 and @xmath152 .",
    "the dip position is at @xmath153 , in agreement with ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "simple trends are found by plotting the parameters as ratios with respect to @xmath1 , fig.4b .",
    "we see that @xmath7/@xmath1 , @xmath107/@xmath1 and @xmath2/@xmath1 are increasing linearly as a function of @xmath4 .",
    "moreover , if we write @xmath4 as the _ excess _ carrier density from the minimum value of .05 , i.e. the doping at the sc onset , we obtain : @xmath154 where @xmath155 is the optimal doping .",
    "the first two are obtained from the taylor expansion of @xmath156 while the third is from eq.(13 ) , using the value @xmath157 .",
    "thus @xmath158 shows nearly twice the slope as @xmath156 , and varies from about @xmath159 to @xmath160 in the complete doping range .",
    "such a straightforward relationship between the parameters was not expected .",
    "if @xmath7 is indeed the ` condensation amplitude ' , it continuously increases relative to the precursor gap , @xmath1 , throughout the phase diagram . since the latter decreases linearly with doping ,",
    "the order parameter is parabolic shaped : @xmath161 with the previous hypotheses , eq.(17 ) expresses a new precise relation between the qp peak positions and the order parameter of the sc transition .    to conclude the discussion on the results from the fits , it is remarkable that the gap function , @xmath0 , as displayed in fig.3 , scales perfectly as a function of @xmath4 through the variation of its amplitude , @xmath7 , and the resonance energy , @xmath162 . as with refs .",
    "@xcite , we find no abrupt change in the qp spectrum , nor in its underlying parameters , while spanning the carrier concentration .",
    "we conclude that a critical point , if there is one , is situated at the right end of the @xmath13 dome .",
    "2 mm    _ shape of the quasiparticle dos _    1 mm    the gap function @xmath0 is now uniquely determined for the range of carrier concentration of interest ( @xmath163 ) .",
    "it is then possible to fit the qp dos with essentially one free parameter ( @xmath4 ) , aside from the broadening and the background slope .",
    "the spectrum of fig.2b , from pan et al .",
    ", was fitted by adjusting the value of @xmath4 , the final value being @xmath164 ( see fig.5 )",
    ". this could be an approximate measure of the local value of the doping at the surface of the sample , but the background slope adds some uncertainty .",
    "our objective here was mainly to reduce , as far as possible , the number of free parameters",

    "plot of the quasiparticle dos evolution as a function of @xmath4 , the carrier density .",
    "the values of the parameters used in the gap function are fixed from fig.4a : the qp peaks ( @xmath1 ) follow a linear trend , while the dip position , @xmath2 , lies along the curve given by ( 16 ) .",
    "the difference between the dip and the peak positions is @xmath165 .",
    "note the detailed dos shape , varying significantly from underdoped to overdoped sides .",
    "2 mm    the variation of the qp dos shape as a function of @xmath4 is shown as a surface plot in fig.5 . as expected , the peak position follows a linear law , while the dip follows the curve given by @xmath166 as a direct consequence of the gap function ( 10 ) .",
    "the detailed shape of the qp dos is not the same on each side of optimal doping due to the relative position of @xmath107 compared to @xmath1 . indeed , on the extreme underdoped side , where @xmath167 , the outer slope of the qp peaks is more rounded , with a slight negative concavity between peak and dip .",
    "on the overdoped side , @xmath168 , the dos has sharper peaks and dips , but also a positive concavity between them",
    ". a closer look at the extreme overdoped case reveals a new singularity , near @xmath107 ( a small kink ) .",
    "the kink is due to a new extremum of @xmath169 , but this prediction remains to be verified experimentally .",
    "the question as to whether we obtain ` bcs behavior ' on the overdoped side can be addressed . in one sense",
    "we do : this limit gives @xmath170 and a single parameter is then tied to @xmath13 .",
    "however , the total spectral gap @xmath107 becomes twice too large ( @xmath171 ) so that the dip still persists , near @xmath149 , which contradicts the bcs @xmath17-wave case .",
    "thus , the precursor gap maintains its influence when @xmath172 .",
    "in fact , the results of figs.4 and 5 clearly show that the gap function is non bcs - like throughout the whole phase diagram .",
    "our model allows an order of magnitude for the value of @xmath32 , defined by the vanishing of the precursor gap . using the data of @xcite ,",
    "we find roughly that @xmath173 .",
    "combined with eq.14 , we get : @xmath174 assumed valid for @xmath175 .",

    "our model , as shown in fig.8 , gives a simple qualitative description of the qp dos with rising temperature .",
    "we turn to the question of interpreting the two energy scales ( @xmath1 , @xmath7 ) that are the main ingredients of the gap function @xmath0 , as expressed in ( 19 ) .",
    "the foregoing work shows that , for large qp energies and along the anti - nodal direction , the total spectral gap is @xmath208 , where @xmath1 defines the qp peak positions , and the new parameter , @xmath7 , is proportional to @xmath25 .",
    "we now consider the energy changes involved in both the normal to sc and the pg to sc transitions . in the latter case we use ( 20 ) for the pg gap , with the assumption : re @xmath209 , with a small imaginary part .",
    "consider first the bcs case of a constant isotropic gap of value @xmath210 in the sc spectrum . the approximate change in energy is given by the familiar integral : @xmath211 the first and second terms @xcite are the change in kinetic and potential energies , respectively , while the variation of the chemical potential is neglected .",

    "the standard result is : @xmath213 or equivalently , putting @xmath214 as the number of pairs , @xmath215 the conventional interpretation is therefore straightforward : the gap in the qp spectrum is equivalent to the energy gain per pair in the n @xmath36 sc transition .",
    "the latter intensive quantity is related to the mean - field critical temperature , @xmath216 .    in the unconventional case",
    ", we must go beyond the mean - field due to three possible effects ( a ) weak phase - stiffness and 2d electronic structure ( kosterlitz - thouless limit ) , ( b ) proximity to bose - einstein condensation and ( c ) coupling to a collective mode ( additional degrees of freedom ) . denoting @xmath217 the energy gain due to one of these processes : @xmath218 where @xmath219 is given by ( 21 ) , but using the complete gap function @xmath220 ( i.e. an extended bcs energy ) .",
    "the latter is calculated by using ( 18 ) , with @xmath221 , and integrating ( 21 ) : @xmath222 where the extra factor of 1/2 is from the angular integral for the @xmath17-wave case . here",
    "one would have expected a _ higher gap value _ than @xmath1 ( between @xmath1 and @xmath107 ) , but the anti - resonant shape of @xmath0 leads to this simple result and is discussed below . the total energy change from the normal to sc states",
    "is then : @xmath223    if one estimates the new number of gapped pairs as @xmath224 , dividing through by @xmath225 gives : @xmath226 this equation matches our expression : @xmath227 , with the identification : @xmath228 neglecting the small imaginary part of @xmath31 , we find the energy change ( n@xmath36pg ) : @xmath229 and finally , combining ( 23 ) and ( 24 ) , @xmath230 thus the @xmath217 term is precisely the energy gain of the sc state with respect to the pg state : the condensation energy .",

    "we have thus shown that the heuristic parameter @xmath7 is consistent with a condensation energy , @xmath217 , going beyond the bcs mean - field value .",
    "these arguments can not prove whether @xmath1 is a pairing gap ( pre - formed pairs above @xmath13 ) or a competing order gap ( spin density wave , etc . ) .",
    "it is compatible with many models where states , in the energy range @xmath235 , are first removed at the fermi level .",
    "however , our model suggests that the new quantity , @xmath236 , is not the opening of a second gap at the sc transition .",
    "indeed , in a first approximation , the total change in ke & pe ( i.e. given by the bcs eq.(21 ) ) is identical with the pseudogap contribution : @xmath237 with the consequence : @xmath238 however , as previously noted , this is compatible with experiment : using sts , the pg width measured at the vortex core is about the same magnitude as the sc gap between the vortices .",
    "the condensation energy term , @xmath239 , is therefore apart , and must be due to additional degrees of freedom beyond the mean field .",

    "the model contains two fundamental energy scales , whose values are determined by the fits to the tunneling spectra : @xmath1 , the quasiparticle peak position , and a second energy , @xmath7 .",
    "we found the resonance ( along the anti - nodal direction ) to be at the fixed position @xmath227 , coinciding with the total spectral gap for high energies , i.e. @xmath340 .",
    "thus , the description of the sc state depends uniquely on this new energy scale : @xmath7 .    to go a step further , we showed that these two energy scales fit the phase diagram as a function of carrier density , @xmath4 .",
    "while @xmath1 decreases linearly with doping , @xmath7 follows @xmath13 , with @xmath341 , and merges smoothly with @xmath1 at high doping .",
    "thus the gap function scales perfectly with the carrier density ; one can then generate the qp - dos shape for arbitrary @xmath4 .",
    "the two energy scales have a simple link : @xmath342 , valid in the range of the available data .",
    "if there is a critical point , it would be at maximal doping where both energy scales vanish .",
    "the role of @xmath7 as a new condensation amplitude is compelling . to check this , we estimated the energy changes associated with the three states ( normal , pg , sc ) .",

    "our new amplitude turns out to be @xmath346 .",
    "it is therefore justified , for both scenarios , that this parameter is proportional to @xmath13 , as found independently from the fits to the data .",
    "since the mouvement of states in the pg to sc transition remains subtle , i.e. not the direct opening of a second ( sc ) gap , we took a closer look at the dispersion law@xmath287 .",
    "we discussed the spectral function , and the corresponding self - energy , where the change of the quasiparticle states can be seen more readily than in the dos .",
    "indeed , it allows to identify features of the qp spectrum as a function of both @xmath120 and @xmath12 .",
    "one finds that in the pg state quasiparticles of higher energy , @xmath347 , end up as quasiparticle peaks at lower energy , @xmath335 , in the sc state .",
    "the cross - over is precisely the characteristic energy where the dip feature is seen , either in the self - energy or in the gap function . by a different analysis than of the dos",
    ", we found that this mouvement of the states depends uniquely on @xmath7 .",
    "our model shows that the principal change of kinetic and potential energies ( as in bcs ) is associated with the opening of the precursor gap @xmath348 , at the fermi level ( normal state to pg state transition ) . at the sc transition ,",
    "the quantity @xmath217 is therefore linked to other degrees of freedom not accounted for in the bcs model .",
    "this possibility is accentuated by the resonant character of the gap function . while a particular collective effect is perhaps responsible , a likely candidate for the condensation energy is the phase stiffness , @xmath249 , in the kosterlitz - thouless transition . in this context",

    "a relevant prediction is thus : @xmath350 , should the kt mechanism fit the phase diagram , for a wide range of doping .",
    "the three questions above have therefore been given a tentative answer .",
    "one could raise some objection to introducing an _ ad hoc _ gap function , where a microscopic theory is missing .",
    "some speculations concerning the physical origin of the gap function have been given in the closing paragraphs of sec.iii .",
    "our main goal of matching the observed experimental qp - dos , and their characteristics as a function of the carrier density , works without resorting to additional extraneous factors .",

    "<S> we previously introduced [ t. cren et al . , europhys . lett . * 52 * , 203 ( 2000 ) ] an energy - dependant gap function , @xmath0 , that fits the unusual shape of the quasiparticle ( qp ) spectrum for both bisrcacuo and ybacuo . a simple anti - resonance in @xmath0 accounts for the pronounced qp peaks in the density of states , at an energy @xmath1 , and the dip feature at a higher energy , @xmath2 . here </S>",
    "<S> we go a step further : our gap function is consistent with the ( @xmath3 ) phase diagram , where @xmath4 is the carrier density . for large qp energies ( @xmath5 ) , the _ total spectral gap _ is @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is tied to the condensation energy . from the available data , </S>",
    "<S> a simple @xmath4-dependance of @xmath1 and @xmath7 is found , in particular @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> these two distinct energy scales of the superconducting state are interpreted by comparing with the normal and _ pseudogap _ states . </S>",
    "<S> the various forms of the qp density of states , as well as the spectral function @xmath9 , are discussed .    </S>",
    "<S> * introduction *    4 mm    a striking feature of the conventional superconducting ( sc ) state is the small number of parameters needed for its description . with the knowledge of the bcs quasiparticle spectrum , @xmath10 , </S>",
    "<S> revealing a gap @xmath11 at the fermi level ( @xmath12=0 ) , the hamiltonian is basically known and the magnetic , thermodynamic and transport properties can be derived @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the gap @xmath11 , which vanishes at @xmath13 , is related to the pairing interaction @xmath14 via the bcs self - consistency relation , giving the ratio @xmath15 , in the weak - coupling isotropic case . </S>",
    "<S> it is thus a scalar order parameter of the transition , a fact that has been verified to a high precision @xcite .    in the case of high - t@xmath16 </S>",
    "<S> , the probing of the qp spectrum has not led to a solution . </S>",
    "<S> still , a wealth of information on the magnetic field , temperature and doping dependence of the sc state has been obtained @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the qp spectral function , as probed using photoemission ( arpes ) , or the density of states ( dos ) as obtained by scanning tunneling spectroscopy ( sts ) , reveal additional singularities which are at odds with a simple bcs @xmath17-wave spectrum @xcite . in the dos ( fig.1 , curve 1 ) , the qp peaks ( @xmath18 ) are very pronounced and are followed by a dip feature ( @xmath19 ) at higher energy ( at @xmath20 ) . </S>",
    "<S> although the origin is still debated , there is some strong - coupling effect on the quasiparticles : a self - energy is implied @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a mean - field approach is insufficient in the context of correlated electrons @xcite , coupled spin - charge degrees of freedom @xcite , phase fluctuations @xcite , or a competing order @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus the sc state can no longer depend on one parameter .    </S>",
    "<S> the main question addressed in this work is can the qp spectrum still be described in simple terms ( eg . in an extended bcs way ) and if so , how does it reflect the order parameter ? to answer , the details of the quasiparticle dos must be understood . </S>",
    "<S> as we showed in ref.@xcite , the particular shape of the measured spectrum , illustrated by curve 1 , can not be obtained from a simple mean - field gap , giving curve 3 . however , </S>",
    "<S> our resonant gap function @xmath0 , described further in sec.i , nicely fits the variety of spectra published since @xcite . despite a number of analyses of the qp spectra , taking into account the coupling to a collective mode @xcite , the effect of van hove singularities or the particle - hole asymmetry @xcite , the effects of disorder or phase fluctuations @xcite , the spectrum 1 is difficult to derive .    to 4.6 cm = 7.2 cm    fig.1 : </S>",
    "<S> curve 1 - quasiparticle dos as observed by tunneling showing pronounced peaks at @xmath21 followed by dips . </S>",
    "<S> curve 2 - _ pseudogap _ type spectrum observed in the vortex core , or for @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> curve 3 - extended bcs ( @xmath17-wave ) dos , but with a larger gap . </S>",
    "<S> all three are generated by our gap function , eq.(10 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> .2 cm    the physical parameters of a self - energy , or equivalent gap function , have yet to be connected to the phase diagram . </S>",
    "<S> important leads on the spectral function ( or dos ) , as a function of doping and temperature , have been obtained using arpes and tunneling . </S>",
    "<S> first , a well - defined qp peak at the position @xmath1 ( our notation ) develops in the sc state and is of @xmath17-wave symmetry @xcite : @xmath23 , yielding the characteristic v shape in curves 1 - 3 . </S>",
    "<S> however , the ratio @xmath24 widely departs from the bcs value ; @xmath1 decreases roughly linearly with @xmath4 , with a large negative slope , from underdoped to overdoped sides of the phase diagram @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as is well established , @xmath25 is dome shaped with a maximum at @xmath26 , where @xmath27 k , for bi@xmath28sr@xmath28cacu@xmath28o@xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the position of the qp peak ( at @xmath30 ) is not the energy scale the global sc order parameter .    </S>",
    "<S> the qp spectrum has been probed as a function of rising temperature @xcite . above @xmath13 , instead of revealing the normal state with a metallic dos , the spectrum displays a pronounced but peak - less gap of width 2@xmath31 at the fermi level . this _ pseudogap _ , see curve 2 , disappears at the higher temperature @xmath32 , and has possibly the same angular dependence as @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , @xmath1 and @xmath31 have approximately the same magnitude @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one finds that @xmath34 , so @xmath35 follows the identical trend as @xmath1 in the phase diagram . </S>",
    "<S> the challenge is to understand three contiguous phases ( superconducting , pseudogap and normal ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , the @xmath35 curve on the overdoped side , where the data is rare , is the subject of hot debate @xcite , in particular whether or not it crosses the @xmath25 dome . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath32 inferred from nmr knight shift , resistivity and specific - heat measurements may correspond to still a higher temperature , such as the onset of anti - ferromagnetic fluctuations , distinct from the vanishing of @xmath31 as observed by arpes @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the origin of the pseudogap is a key question about high - t@xmath16 , and is still highly controversial . </S>",
    "<S> theories fall into two qualitative categories : @xmath31 is either a precursor to , or competes with , the sc state @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the first @xcite is immediately compelling due to the phase diagram : below @xmath32 incoherent pairs are formed ( thus the pseudogap ) and condense at @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> it also follows many aspects of the sc state ( low carrier density , strong coupling energy , small coherence length , sensitivity to disorder , etc . ) and is theoretically tractable @xcite . in the second category , the competing order ( charge or spin density wave , varma currents , rvb, ... </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) sends @xmath32 down , possibly across the @xmath13 dome , to a quantum critical point above which a new phase is formed . </S>",
    "<S> deciding between these two categories would be a significant advance .    </S>",
    "<S> conductance mapping using sts has provided valuable information . </S>",
    "<S> the ` normal ' state found within the vortex core @xcite reveals a pseudogap analogous to the one found just above @xmath13 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the local vanishing of the sc order parameter in a vortex core is due to the phase singularity ; but contrary to the conventional case , the pseudogap persists . </S>",
    "<S> we found a quasi - identical pseudogap , in zero magnetic field , caused by weak disorder @xcite . in both cases , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath1 and @xmath31 have about the same magnitude @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus an important constraint on the sc gap function is its smooth transition to the peak - less pseudogap when phase coherence is lost : curve 1 @xmath36 curve2 ( fig.1 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> 2 mm    nozires and pistolesi @xcite have described a superconducting state when a precursor gap , such as @xmath31 , is initially present . </S>",
    "<S> however , their model implies that the sc gap must be larger than the precursor gap . </S>",
    "<S> thus , given curve 2 for the pseudogap , curve 3 is expected in the superconducting state , not curve 1 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the high spectral weight of the qp peaks ( curve 1 ) leads to an apparent paradox : electronic states seem to move towards the fermi level in the transition to the sc state @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> any complex self - energy or gap function must give the correct energy change for the pseudogap to sc transition .    </S>",
    "<S> the situation becomes complex in the case of strong disorder : local sts mapping has revealed pseudogap / sc gap variations at the surface of bscco @xcite . clearly , in this case , there are changes of both sc amplitude and phase @xcite . in pb - substituted bscco </S>",
    "<S> the disorder causes ` superconducting ' islands to form @xcite , where the intensity of the spectral fine structure correlates with the degree of long - range order . </S>",
    "<S> recent theoretical work by atkinson @xcite and experimental sts by fang et al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite corroborate this conclusion . even if the inhomogeneity is not an intrinsic property @xcite , the cuprate sc state is sensitive to local perturbations @xcite , and the attenuation of </S>",
    "<S> the spectral fine structure is a clear sign . </S>",
    "<S> then , several parameters are needed for the interpretation of the tunneling dos .    in this article </S>",
    "<S> , we analyze the qp spectrum , @xmath37 , as inferred from the sharpest tunneling dos of bscco . </S>",
    "<S> the detailed dos shape ( pronounced qp peaks , followed by dips at higher energy ) is due to a single resonance in our energy - dependant gap function , sectioni . </S>",
    "<S> such a resonance in the qp spectrum is possibly the coupling to a collective mode @xcite of the same origin as the resonance seen using inelastic neutron scattering @xcite and which scales with @xmath13 : @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> zasadzinsky et al . </S>",
    "<S> studied the dip position as a function of doping using strong - coupling theory @xcite , and suggested that the dip energy is also related to @xmath13 . since the origin of the resonant gap function ( or qp self - energy ) is still unknown , our aim is to show how the basic parameters depend on the carrier density @xmath4 . in sec.ii </S>",
    "<S> we find that one of the energy terms , @xmath39 , is compatible with an order parameter : it is proportional to @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> the predicted shape of the qp density of states is then studied as a function of @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> we treat the transition to the pg state ( sec.ii ) , and the role of the two distinct energy scales ( sec.iii ) . finally , the qp spectral function and self - energy are discussed ( sec.iv ) . </S>"
