    "this note refers to the work @xcite , in which i have defined , via skein relation , an invariant of colored links .",

    "an oriented link with @xmath0 components is a set of @xmath0 disjoint smooth oriented closed curves embedded in @xmath1 .",
    "an oriented link is _ colored _",
    ", if each component is provided with a color . in other words , a link is colored if a function @xmath2 is defined on the set of components to a finite set @xmath3 of colors .",
    "let s call _ coloration _ such a function @xmath2 .",
    "every coloration introduces an equivalence relation in the set of components : two components are equivalent if they have the same color .",
    "let @xmath4 be the set of components of a link @xmath5 .",
    "two colorations @xmath2 and @xmath6 of @xmath5 are said _ equivalent _ if there is a bijection in @xmath3 between the images @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "two colorations define the same partition of the set @xmath4 into classes of equivalence if and only if they are equivalent .",
    "an invariant of colored links takes the same value on isotopic links with the same coloration , and may take different values on the same link with different colorations .",
    "the invariant @xmath9 of colored links defined in @xcite takes the same value on isotopic links with equivalent colorations . in section 1 , the statement of the theorem defining the invariant @xmath9 is reported .",
    "the invariant @xmath9 has three variables , say @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "there are two natural ways to define an invariant of classical links by using @xmath9 .",
    "the first way , is to consider a link as a colored link , whose components have all the same color . in this case",
    "the invariant @xmath9 becomes independent of @xmath10 , and is in fact another instance of the homflypt polynomial .",
    "in particular , it becomes the jones polynomial in the variable @xmath12 setting @xmath13 . given a classical link @xmath5 , we will denote @xmath14 the invariant @xmath9 on the colored link obtained by coloring @xmath5 with a sole color .",
    "the second way , is to consider a link as a colored link , whose components have all different colors . in this case",
    "@xmath9 yields an invariant which is stronger than the homflypt polynomial .",
    "given a classical link @xmath15 with @xmath0 components , we will denote @xmath16 the invariant @xmath9 on the colored link obtained by coloring @xmath15 with n colors .    among the 89 pairs of non - isotopic links with at most 11 crossings ,",
    "non distinguished by the homflypt polynomial , 49 pairs contain links with three components .",
    "i have computed @xmath17 on 20 pairs of such pairs : six of these pairs are distinguished by @xmath17 ( see proposition [ p2 ] in section 3 )",
    ".    however , there are other ways to define an invariant of classical links by using @xmath9 .",
    "indeed , we can calculate @xmath9 on the whole set of colored links obtained from a link @xmath5 with @xmath0 components by coloring it by all the possible non - equivalent colorations .",
    "then , for every integer partition @xmath18 of @xmath0 in @xmath19 parts ( @xmath20 ) , we take all partitions of the set of @xmath0 components in @xmath19 blocks , whose cardinalities correspond to the partition @xmath18",
    ". these partitions of the set of components are said to be of type @xmath18 .",
    "we thus define the invariant @xmath21 as the set of values taken by @xmath9 on the colored links obtained by coloring @xmath5 with @xmath19 colors according to each one of the type @xmath18 partitions , i.e. , by coloring the components with the same color if and only if they belong to the same block .",
    "example : the link below has three components , that are colored according to the partitions indicated .",
    "the invariant @xmath22 distinguishes pairs of the above mentioned pairs of non isotopic links , which are not distinguished by @xmath17 .",
    "as we have said in @xcite , the definition of @xmath9 is a byproduct of the study of another class of links , the _ tied links _ ( see @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , the tied links are links whose components may be connected in several points by ties . but these ties behave exactly as an equivalence relation between the link components , so that isotopic tied links are isotopic colored links with equivalent colorations ( see section 1 for more precise definitions ) .",
    "tied links can be seen also as the closure of tied braids , that constitute a diagrammatic representation of the elements of an abstract algebra , the so - called nowadays bt - algebra ( algebra of braids and ties ) . in @xcite",
    "we have defined , via skein relation , a polynomial @xmath23 , invariant of tied links , and we have shown that @xmath23 can be realized also by the jones recipe , using the trace on the bt - algebra established in @xcite .",
    "the properties of the trace allowed us to make a computer program to calculate @xmath23 .",
    "we may define a tied link @xmath24 from a colored link @xmath5 so that @xmath25 is recovered from @xmath26 by a variable change .",
    "this has allowed me to verify the values of @xmath9 obtained on colored links by the skein relation , presented in this paper .    finally , i show some unexpected identities satisfied from the values forming the invariants @xmath27 for the pairs distinguished by such invariants , that allows to formulate a conjecture .",
    "the calculation of @xmath27 on all pairs of three - component links not distinguished by the homflypt polynomial has to be completed in order to understand these identities or to disprove the conjecture .",
    "[ isotop ] two oriented colored links are _ c - isotopic _ if they are ambient isotopic , and their colorations are equivalent .",
    "a colored link diagram is like the diagram of a link , where each component is colored .",
    "let @xmath28 be a commutative ring and @xmath29 be the set of colored oriented link diagrams . by _ invariant of colored links _",
    "we mean a function @xmath30 , which is constant on each class of c - isotopic links .",
    "[ rem1 ] in the sequel , we denote by @xmath5 an oriented colored link as well as its diagram , if there is no risk of confusion .",

    "* let @xmath5 be a colored link , with @xmath0 components and @xmath19 colors .",

    "similarly , let @xmath39 and @xmath40 be two links that inside the disc look as shown in figure [ linv1]b , while outside the disc coincide with @xmath37 and @xmath38 , except -possibly- for the colors of all the components of the link having the same colors as the strands entering the disc : all these components in @xmath39 and @xmath40 are colored by a sole color .",
