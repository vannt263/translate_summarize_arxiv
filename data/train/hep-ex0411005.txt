    "studies of @xmath7 meson decays have proved to be very useful for discoveries of new particles ( such as p - wave @xmath22 states ) , therefore it is interesting to search for pentaquarks in @xmath7 decays although no firm theoretical predictions for branching fractions exist .",

    "the data were collected with the belle detector  @xcite at the kekb asymmetric energy @xmath10 storage rings  @xcite .",
    "the belle detector is a large - solid - angle magnetic spectrometer that consists of a three layer silicon vertex detector ( svd ) , a 50-layer cylindrical drift chamber ( cdc ) , a mosaic of aerogel threshold cherenkov counters ( acc ) , a barrel - like array of time - of - flight scintillator counters ( tof ) , and an array of csi(tl ) crystals ( ecl ) located inside a superconducting solenoidal coil that produces a 1.5  t magnetic field .",
