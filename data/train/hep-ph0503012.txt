    "<S> it is well - known ( see e.g. @xcite ) that the @xmath0 quark is not heavy enough for a reliable application of the nonrelativistic expansion since the @xmath8 contributions could exceed 20% . </S>",
    "<S> this testifies a poor convergence of the @xmath9 expansion . </S>",
    "<S> while describing the properties of heavy - light mesons @xcite we treated the light quarks in a completely relativistic way . </S>",

    "<S> it is constructed with the help of the off - mass - shell scattering amplitude , projected onto the positive energy states . </S>",
    "<S> constructing the quasipotential of the quark - antiquark interaction , we have assumed that the effective interaction is the sum of the usual one - gluon exchange term with the mixture of long - range vector and scalar linear confining potentials , where the vector confining potential contains the pauli interaction . </S>",
