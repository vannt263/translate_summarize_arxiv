    "bremsstrahlung processes , particularly proton - proton bremsstrahlung , have long been studied as a method of assessing the importance of off - shell effects in low and intermediate energy hadronic scattering .",
    "there have been two main theoretical approaches : non - relativistic potential models @xcite which include off - shell effects explicitly , and the soft photon approximation @xcite which is written in terms of only on - shell information about the non - radiative scattering process .",
    "soft photon amplitudes therefore give information about off - shell effects only through any discrepancy between their prediction for the bremsstrahlung spectrum and experimental measurements , and even then there is an ambiguity in that some of the discrepancy could arise from higher order on - shell effects .    for the proton - proton bremsstrahlung process",
    "it had been found in the past that the low soft photon approximation gave a good description of the older data@xcite , suggesting that off - shell effects are small .",
    "the more recent 280  mev triumf experiment @xcite provided measurements not only of photon spectra but also of polarization observables .",
    "this data showed some disagreement with the soft photon prediction @xcite , indicating for the first time the presence of non - trivial off - shell behavior in the @xmath0  elastic scattering process .",
    "although most soft photon applications have used the low @xcite approach , it is well known that the derivation of the soft photon approximation is not unique .",
    "different choices lead to soft photon amplitudes which differ at @xmath1 .",
    "recently liou , timmermans and gibson @xcite have suggested an alternate form for the soft photon amplitude .",
    "the claim is made that this `` two - u - two - t - special '' ( tutts ) amplitude provides better agreement with @xmath2 data at all energies than the traditional low amplitude .",
    "this success is contrasted in that paper with the dramatic failure to describe the data of another alternative soft photon amplitude , the `` two - s - two - t - special '' ( tstts ) amplitude .    in this paper",
    "we shall investigate two problems which can arise in the application of soft photon amplitudes to particular processes .",
    "the first of these , which we shall call the phase space problem , concerns the expression of a soft photon amplitude solely in terms of measurable information about the on - shell non - radiative process .",
    "the second , the antisymmetrization problem , concerns the inability to write the correctly antisymmetrized @xmath2 soft photon amplitude in terms of the measured , antisymmetric @xmath0  elastic amplitude . the usual low form for the radiative amplitude will be shown to be immune to these difficulties , while the tutts and tstts amplitudes fall victim to one or both of the problems .    these problems both have analogs in the case of spinless two - body bremsstrahlung processes .",
    "we begin by studying the problems in that algebraically simpler context , deriving the spinless forms of the low , tutts and tstts amplitudes in section  [ sectii ] . in section  [ sectiii ]",
    "we consider the phase space problem while in section  [ sectiv ] we treat the symmetrization of identical particle spinless bremsstrahlung processes . in section  [ sectv ]",
    "we extend our results to proton - proton bremsstrahlung where the elastic and radiative amplitudes must be written in antisymmetric form , and present some illustrative examples of the problems discussed .",
    "we begin with two - body spin zero scattering and first review the derivation of the low @xcite form of the soft photon approximation as well as the `` two - s - two - t - special '' ( tstts ) and `` two - u - two - t - special '' ( tutts ) forms suggested by liou and collaborators @xcite .",
    "the problems in which we are interested may be considered within this algebraically simpler spinless framework , and then carried over with little modification to the more physically interesting case of nucleon - nucleon bremsstrahlung .",
    "we define @xmath3 to be the amplitude describing the non - radiative scattering of particles of mass @xmath4 and @xmath5 into a final state composed of masses @xmath6 and @xmath7 with @xmath8 and @xmath9 the usual mandelstam variables .",

    "contact with the physical non - radiative amplitude , which can be evaluated from measured phase shifts , is made by going to the on - shell limit , @xmath11 .",
    "the low form of the soft photon amplitude may then be constructed as follows .",
    "one writes the contribution of radiation from the external charged particles to the radiative amplitude in terms of off - shell evaluations of the non - radiative scattering amplitude @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath13 here @xmath14 are the charges of the various particles and @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the photon momentum and polarization vector .",
    "the non - radiative amplitude @xmath12 is written with each of the charged legs in turn taken off - shell due to the emission of the photon , i.e. , we use the same functional form as the on - shell , non - radiative amplitude considered as a function of the @xmath10 , but evaluate the @xmath10 at the radiative point satisfying @xmath17 .",

    "indeed , for most choices of radiative variable pairs and for most sets of masses @xmath64 defining phase space , we find that the soft photon amplitude does indeed require evaluations of the non - radiative amplitude at points which are not physically measurable .",

    "the amplitudes tstts and tutts could be correctly antisymmetrized by computing @xmath218 directly in terms of the unsymmetrized functions @xmath180 .",
    "as stated previously however , the @xmath180 can not be derived from @xmath200 elastic scattering data alone .",
    "thus we would lose the direct connection between a process and its radiative counterpart which gives the soft photon theorem its utility .",
    "alternatively , one could modify the original tutts amplitude by changing the terms added to give gauge invariance , just as was discussed for the spin-0 case .    from ref .",
    "@xcite we see that liou _",
    "_ seem to have used the antisymmetric @xmath183 @xmath0 elastic functions directly in their unsymmetrized tstts and tutts amplitudes .",
    "their results can not have the correct symmetry properties , and again the error will be of @xmath1 for the tstts amplitude and of @xmath140 for the tutts .",
    "we shall now illustrate these ideas with some numeric results for the @xmath0 bremsstrahlung soft photon spectrum .",
    "low energy proton - proton elastic scattering data is usually parameterized in terms of a phase shift fit . for our calculations",
    "we have used as input the recent analysis of the nijmegen group , refs .",
    "the relationship between these phase shifts and the invariant functions @xmath219 is straightforward but rather algebraically involved , and is set down explicitly in ref .",
    "@xcite . in order to investigate the work of liou , timmermans and gibson @xcite we have inserted these @xmath220 in place of the unsymmetrized functions @xmath198 in the soft photon amplitudes of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : low ] ) , ( [ eq : tstts ] )  and  ( [ eq : tutts ] ) .",
    "as shown above this will give rise to the correctly antisymmetrized radiative amplitude only for the low-@xmath55 case of eq .",
    "( [ eq : low ] ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : ppbrem ] we have shown the differential spectrum @xmath221 as a function of the laboratory frame photon angle @xmath222 for one of the kinematic choices studied by the harvard @xmath0 bremsstrahlung experiment of ref .",
    "@xcite  that is , with beam kinetic energy of 157  mev , with final state protons detected at @xmath223 on either side of the beamline direction , and with all particles coplanar . shown",
    "are the low-@xmath55 and tutts soft photon calculations using the nijmegen phase shift dataset as input . from the symmetry of this experimental setup",
    "it is clear that the photon angular spectrum must be symmetric under reflection about the beamline axis .",
    "this is the case for the low-@xmath55 spectrum , while the tutts spectrum does not have this symmetry property . since the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite give their results only in the region @xmath224 this can not be checked directly from their paper .",
    "we obtain results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ppbrem ] which agree very well with their results for that range of @xmath222 but are not mirror symmetric about @xmath225 , which they should be .",
    "this is consistent with an error in the antisymmetrization of the tutts amplitude .    due to the phase space problem described in section  [ sectii ]",
    "we can not present a result for the tstts amplitude without extrapolating the function @xmath208 far outside of the physical region of non - radiative phase space . in terms of the phase shifts , which are parameterized by center - of - mass frame momentum and scattering angle @xmath226 , this would correspond to evaluating the non - radiative amplitude for @xmath227 .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite do present results for the tstts amplitude .",
    "these spectra differ by large factors from other soft photon calculations , from potential model calculations , and from experimental data .",
    "this difference appears in spite of the well known result that the leading two orders of the photon spectrum are uniquely predicted .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite suggest that this large discrepancy is evidence that the tutts amplitude should be preferred over the tstts amplitude for calculations of identical particle scattering .",
    "an alternative explanation might be that this large discrepancy is simply a reflection of the fact that the elastic amplitudes , which are required far outside the physical region , were extrapolated in some unphysical way .",
    "we have seen that problems arise in the practical application of certain soft photon amplitudes to two - body bremsstrahlung processes , in particular to @xmath0  bremsstrahlung .",
    "since the variables @xmath99 , @xmath107 and  @xmath105 of radiative phase space satisfy the same constraints as the mandelstam variables @xmath8 , @xmath9 and  @xmath44 of the corresponding non - radiative process we find that the usual low formulation of the approximation , which expresses all elastic amplitudes at a single point in terms of these variables , is unaffected by the phase space problem and the antisymmetrization problem .",
    "in contrast , neither the `` two - u - two - t - special '' ( tutts ) nor the `` two - s - two - t - special '' ( tstts ) amplitudes suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite can be antisymmetrized while being written in terms of the measurable @xmath0  elastic amplitude .",
    "additionally the tstts amplitude was found to be incalculable unless one makes a model - dependent extrapolation of the @xmath0  elastic amplitude outside of its physical , on - shell region .",
    "we conclude that the tutts and tstts soft photon amplitudes , and those other alternative forms for the soft photon approximation which rely on taylor expansions about radiative variable pairs other than @xmath55 and share the same problems , are not suitable for the soft photon analysis of proton - proton bremsstrahlung .",
