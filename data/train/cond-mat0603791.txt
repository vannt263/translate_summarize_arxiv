    "an example of the above is the fuel lubricated diesel engine injection pump , capable of delivering in excess of 2000 bars today compared to 500 bars 15 years ago .",
    "this increase in injection pressure has ensured higher engine efficiencies and lower pollution levels .",
    "historically the diesel oil sulphur reduction both in the 1960s and 1990s combined with the high pressures have played a significant role in injection pump durability .",
    "sulphur , along with other polarity inducing atoms , is part of polar species that ensure low wear in boundary lubrication , a predominant regime in pumps lubricated by diesel oil .",
    "today there exist several accelerated laboratory tests capable of predicting the lubricating abilities of a diesel oil .",
    "if a fuel fails such a test , lubricity additives in small proportions are added to ensure proper wear resistance .",
    "the currently used diesel oil wear test in europe is the high frequency reciprocating rig ( hfrr ) which is covered by several standards @xcite .",
    "the principle in the hfrr is the sliding of a fixed steel ball , loaded with 2n on a steel disk for 75 minutes .",

    "it appears that a decrease in fuel viscosity requires an increase in lubricity ( smaller wear scar ) to ensure full lifetime of the pumps .",
    "this relation between viscosity and lubricity was confirmed as a new fuel appeared in the 1990s : dimethyl ether ( dme ) .",
    "this fuel has a viscosity 20 times lower than that of diesel oil and it was established that an adequate lubricity level according to the hfrr standards was not sufficient to protect the pump surfaces @xcite .",
    "a study @xcite has argued that that fluid viscosity is only a secondary property in the hfrr .",
    "based on molecular dynamics calculations it was discovered that the squeeze - out of linear alkanes from surface contacts is primarily a function of the length of the molecule .",
    "experimental data shown in figure [ fig_wsd_cn_2exp ] demonstrates that branched alkanes perform worse in the hfrr than their linear isomers although their viscosities are almost the same @xcite .",
    "this observation confirms that the bulk viscosity may be a secondary property in boundary lubrication .",
    "the friction and wear properties in boundary lubrication of lubricants with branched and linear molecules have been investigated both experimentally @xcite and using theoretical simulation methods @xcite .    whether linear alkanes or their branched isomers are the best lubricants according to the cited literature remains uncertain .",
    "a number of studies indicate that n - alkanes are the best lubricants @xcite whereas others claim that branched alkanes perform better @xcite",
    ". one major weakness of the published studies is that the lubricant squeezing is stopped at a separation of about eight ngstrom between the surfaces . at this point",
    "there are still a few monolayers left protecting the surfaces , and significant wear originating from cold welding should only appear when the last lubricant layer is squeezed out @xcite .    in the present computer simulation study",

    "the interaction between particles of different molecules is described by lennard - jones potentials .",
    "the intramolecular interactions include two body forces that keep the bond length c  c close to 1.53 ngstrom , three body forces imposing a preferred angle of 115 degrees between the carbon atoms , and four body forces favouring a well defined torsion of the molecules .",
    "the four body forces apply to the sequence of carbon atoms c  c  c  c , thus they are present only for n - butane .    for the iso - butane molecules we introduced also an anti umbrella inversion potential , analogously to what already done by mondello and grest @xcite for branched hydrocarbons ; the only difference here being that in the iso - butane molecule it is not possible to distinguish which carbon atom constitutes the lateral branch and which constitute the backbone of the molecule .",

    "we can achieve a realistic description of the walls elastic response by simulating thick walls comprising many layers .",
    "since we necessitate proper elastic behaviour up to wavelengths comparable with the size of the contact area the walls thickness must not be smaller that the lateral size of the box , @xmath8   .",

    "similar springs connect together the square grid of atoms of the wall .",
    "the advantage of this approach is double : with a relatively small number of atoms it is possible to describe the long range elasticity of the walls , and to impose a curved profile simply by using a curved rigid surface .",
    "the rigid surface connected to the substrate s atoms is flat and its position is fixed . the upper rigid surface has the profile @xmath13 where the amplitude of corrugation @xmath14 is 20 , 40 , or 60  .",
    "the case @xmath15   guarantees a larger contact region , but it does not allow enough empty space ( or rather vapour space region ) for the squeeze - out of the last two layers ; it was used only for comparison with the other cases , to ensure that the size of the contact region is large enough for the nucleation of the squeeze - out process .    the springs connecting the walls atoms to the rigid surfaces simulate the elastic response of a gold film of thickness 50 ngstrom , comparable with the lateral size @xmath16 of the sample .",

    "the contact region is about 15% of the whole cell size , and the real pressure in the center of the contact area is much larger than the average pressure .",
    "negative pressures observed in some time intervals are due to the attractive capillarity forces of the neck of lubricant .",

    "another independent simulation at @xmath24 k ( not shown ) confirms this trend .",
    "the transition from 2 to 1 iso - butane monolayer reveals another interesting feature : the pressure drops down in two stages , as is shown in the plot of figure [ fig_pressure_vs_time_350k ] for time close to 1.2 ns .",
    "what happens is clearly illustrated in the snapshots of figure [ fig_plateau ] : initially there is the squeeze - out of one of the two layers .",
    "the remaining monolayer does not have a preferential orientation of the molecules parallel to the walls , the plateau in the pressure versus time graph at @xmath25 ns is due to this _ thick _ monolayer .",

    "this kind of two - stage squeezing of the second layer has been observed in other simulations too , but only for iso - butane .",

    ", scaledwidth=47.5% ]    the simulations at lower squeezing speed give clear evidence that the the relatively higher lubricity of the last layer of iso - butane is a kinetic effect .",
    "thus , at @xmath19 k and for the compression speed 1 m / s ( fig .",
    "[ fig_lastlayer_300k ] ) n - butane is removed first , while when the speed is 0.1 m / s the removal of the two lubricants happens almost at the same time ( not shown ) .",
    "finally when the squeezing is carried at the speed 0.03 m / s iso - butane is removed first and at a lower pressure ( fig .",
    "[ fig_pressure_vs_time_slow ] ) . in this case",
    "there is still some small island of molecules trapped , shown in the picture , confirming once more that the lateral sliding of iso - butane is slower .",
    "a further evidence that the removal of the last monolayer is influenced by kinetic effects comes from the squeezing pressure versus pushing speed @xmath27 : keeping all the other conditions identical , we observed that the pressure at which the last layer is removed does decrease when the block is pushed down slowly .",
    "for example , for iso - butane at @xmath19 k we obtained the following pressures : 0.340 gpa when @xmath28 m / s , 0.257 gpa when @xmath29 m / s , and 0.239 gpa when @xmath30 m / s",
    "( as usual , these are spatial averages , the true pressures in the contact area being much higher ) .",
    "similarly , the corresponding simulations for n - butane gave 0.321 , 0.252 , and 0.263 gpa respectively .",
    "the lubricant is able to nucleate the hole for the squeeze - out at the lowest of these pressures , but at high pushing speed there is not enough time to exploit this possibility before the pressure is further increased .",
    "it is interesting to observe what happens when the temperature is changed , particularly considering that in reality the microcontacts where the squeeze - out happens are likely to be much warmer than the environment , at least during sliding .",
    "the temperature is likely to speed up the mobility of the molecules , reducing the influence of the drag force of the walls .",
    "moreover the larger thermal fluctuations should strongly favour the nucleation of the critical hole in the lubricant layer .",
    "both effects tend to reduce the pressure needed to squeeze the lubricant .",
    "this is indeed the trend which we found and that is observed in fig .",
    "[ fig_squeeze_vs_t ] . on the other hand , any difference @xmath31 between n - butane and iso - butane in the free energy barriers for",
    "nucleation of squeeze - out should become less important as the temperature increases , as the ratio between the nucleation probabilities is mainly affected by the boltzmann factor @xmath32 , which goes to 1 when @xmath33 .",
    "unfortunately the low temperature conditions are hard to analyse through simulations : the randomness of the single squeeze - out event is enhanced by the strong decrease of the boltzmann factor .",
    "actually the transition time for a nucleating process has an exponential distribution , where the standard deviation is equal to the average value .",
    "thereafter the data of a single simulations become no more reliable and only an average over many independent simulations not easily affordable due to computer time limitations would show the real trend .",
    "we do not have enough statistics in fig .",
    "[ fig_squeeze_vs_t ] for a reliable comparison of the behaviours of n - butane and iso - butane below room temperature .",
    "finally we consider the effect of lateral sliding of the walls with respect to each other .",
    "we ran some simulations ( not shown ) at different temperatures with squeezing speed and lateral speed both equal to 1 m / s , and we observed that the removal of the last monolayer happens almost simultaneously at the same pressure .",
    "the relative motion of the walls tends to take away the effect of the drag between walls and lubricant , which is indeed responsible of the higher lubricity of iso - butane when squeezing fast .",
    "this is an important remark , since in many practical situations there is lateral sliding .",
    "the significance of the temperature for the squeeze - out of the two different butanes is of outermost importance for future wear experiments .",
    "the results in figure [ fig_wsd_cn_2exp ] are all obtained at 298k . at this temperature and at the given sliding conditions it seems that iso - butane is more easily squeezed out from the ball - disk contact than n - butane as the resulting wear is slightly lower for the latter one . in real injection",
    "pumps the temperature could be very low ( at start up ) and very high ( running conditions ) .",
    "the present simulation results imply that wear protecting properties of different molecules in the fuel may not react the same way to changes in temperature and sliding conditions .",
    "this means that a wear test may not reflect reality unless test conditions such as temperature and sliding velocity are varied .",
    "this new aspect of wear experiments should be looked into in the near future .",
    "we have studied the properties of butane ( c@xmath0h@xmath1 ) lubricants confined between two approaching solids using a model that accounts for the curvature and elastic properties of the solid surfaces .",
    "we considered both linear n - butane and the branched iso - butane . in the case of the linear molecule",
    "well defined molecular layers develop in the lubricant film when the width is of the order of a few atomic diameters .",

    "the last layers of iso - butane are squeezed out before those of n - butane .",
    "since the ( interfacial ) squeezing velocity in most practical applications is very low when the lubricant layer has molecular thickness , one expect n - butane to be a better boundary lubricant than iso - butane .",
    "this is consistent with wear experiments in which n - butane was shown to protect steel surfaces better than iso - butane . on the other hand ,",
