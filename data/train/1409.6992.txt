    "alps ii is a light - shining - through - a - wall experiment based on an optical laser @xcite . compared to alps i",
    ", the overall experimental sensitivity will be increased by extending the magnetic length , improving the optical system and setting up a more sensitive photon detector . according to the latter , a detection of low - flux single 1064  nm photons",
    "is required @xcite .",
    "therefore , we have set to work on developing a tes detector system @xcite . in the last year",
    ", the completed setup has been characterized concerning its experimental sensitivity for the first time @xcite .",
    "the alps ii experiment asks for a detection of low rates of single 1064  nm photons .",
    "the sensitivity of the axion - like particle - photon coupling , @xmath2 , concerning only the alps detector is defined as @xcite : @xmath3    \\mathcal{s}_{\\rm detector}(g _ { { \\rm a}\\gamma } ) = \\left({\\sqrt{dc}}/{de}\\right)^{1/4 } %   \\ , \\left[{{\\rm s}^{-1/8}}\\right ]    \\label{eqn : sens}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath0 is the dark count rate and @xmath1 is the ( overall ) detection efficiency of the detector .",
    "the smaller this figure of merit the higher the gain for the alps experiment .",
    "the alps i detector was a commercial state - of - the - art silicon - based charged - coupled device ( ccd ) @xcite . using this ccd camera to detect 1064  nm light ,",
    "the sensitivity is limited due to @xmath4  % @xcite . with @xmath5  s@xmath6",
    "@xcite it results : @xmath7 the goal of a new detector is to reach a higher sensitivity or lower figure of merit , @xmath8 .",
    "detectors based on transition - edge sensors ( tess ) can reach a high sensitivity @xcite .",
    "tess are operated within the superconducting transition of the sensor s material .",
    "thus , small temperature changes like by a photon cause measurable changes of the electrical resistance . for the alps tes detector , we are using a tungsten - based tes from nist @xcite .",
    "these kind of sensors are optimized for detecting single photons around 1064  nm .",
    "single mode fibers are attached to nist tes chips @xcite . for 1064  nm signals , a detection efficiency of @xmath9 97  % @xmath10 2  % syst .",
    "@xmath10 1  % stat .",
    "was measured @xcite",
    ". exact measurements of alps tes detector s @xmath1 are underway within the collaboration . for the considered dark count rate in this paper ( sec .",
    "[ sec : dc ] ) , we conservatively estimate @xcite @xmath11 which includes a low analysis efficiency due to necessary cuts on the signal region ( sec .  [",
    "sec : dc ] ) .",
    "we are operating the nist tes at a bath temperature of @xmath12  mk @xmath13  @xmath14k due to the superconducting transition @xmath15  mk of the tes @xcite .",
    "the bath is provided by an adiabatic demagnetization refrigerator ( adr ) system .",
    "the 2.5  k - precooling is provided by a pulse tube cooler . the subsequent mk - cooling is provided by a 6  t magnet and a salt pills unit , which allows to establish a continuous 80 mk - operation for @xmath16  h. the low - noise current read - out of the tes circuit is provided by an dc 2-stage squid from ptb @xcite . for signal calibration as well as for long - background measurements ,",
    "we have used an oscilloscope dpo7104c from tektronix as data acquisition system ( daq ) .",
    "applying an attenuated laser for single photon source , we consider the distribution of the pulse heights @xmath17 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : phd ] ) .",
    "we observe three event classes @xcite :    * signal photons : 1064  nm photons normally distribute around @xmath18  mv . fitting a gaussian distribution",
    "allows to define a signal region and to determine an energy resolution of a 1064  nm photon signal .",
    "we observe @xmath19 . *",
    "sensor noise : the signal peak is clearly separated from the noise peak around @xmath20  mv . the noise is mainly caused by the fundamental tes noise . * thermal photons : thermal photon events are observed due to the warm fiber end at room temperature .",
    "the optical transmittance of the single mode fiber and the tes absorptivity cause an effective peak between 1550 and 2000  nm .",
    "thermal photons through the fiber are confirmed by operating the tes in a @xmath21  k - environment without optical fiber link .",
    "thermal photons are also observed by other groups as a reasonable background source @xcite .    while the intrinsic noise is no possible source for dark counts of 1064  nm signals",
    ", the spectrum of thermal photons can reach the 1064  nm signal region and result in a dark count .",
    "further background events , like intrinsic , are well discriminated by a proper pulse shape analysis @xcite . to estimate an expected dark count rate , we consider a conservative model : 300  k black body spectrum , no optical losses and an overall energy resolution of @xmath22 .",
    "furthermore , we only consider the high - energetic 3@xmath23-region of 1064  nm signals which corresponds to photon wavelength between 818 and 1064  nm ( sec .",
    "[ sec : dc ] ) .",
    "this results in a photon rate of @xmath24  s@xmath6 due to a room - temperature black body spectrum .",
    "this number is compared to long - term measurements in the next section .",
    "to determine the dark count rate of a fiber - coupled tes , the warm fiber end outside the cryostat was adequately covered , so that no ambient light can couple into the open fiber end .",
    "we have analyzed each trigger event of two long - term measurements ( @xmath25  h ) offline .",
    "only events showing a single photon pulse shape were taken into account @xcite .",
    "furthermore , as mentioned above , we only consider the high - energetic half 3@xmath23-region of 1064  nm signals due to the used trigger level .",
    "this is necessary because of the used daq : a corresponding low trigger level around a @xmath17 of 1550  nm photons results in a too high trigger rate due to the thermal spectrum , which would cause dead time effects . for this setup ,",
    "we determine a dark count rate of @xmath26    comparing this rate to the estimate rate due to a black body spectrum ( sec .",
    "[ sec : signal ] ) the measured rate is @xmath271.5 orders of magnitude higher than the expected rate . it is found that a plausible explanation are pile - up events of thermal photons @xcite .",
    "a first - order pile - up rate @xmath28 can be estimated by a formula describing accidental coincidences @xcite : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the resolving time and @xmath31 and @xmath32 uncorrelated rates .",
    "the time resolution of the current setup is constrained by the analysis method and is conservatively estimated by @xmath33  @xmath14s .",
    "the rates @xmath31 and @xmath32 are estimated from fig .",
    "[ fig : phd ] : we split the thermal peak in two parts and assume that two photons from each part can effectively combine to a 1064  nm signal event",
    ". it is @xmath34 .",
    "thus , the rate for first - order pile - ups imitating 1064 nm events is @xmath35 .",
    "@xmath28 is in the same order of magnitude as the measured rate @xmath36 ( eq .  [ eqn : dc ] ) .",
    "using the alps tes detector , the experimental sensitivity ( eq .  [ eqn : sens ] ) results in @xmath37 where we used the estimated @xmath38 ( eq .",
    "[ eqn : de ] ) and the measured @xmath36 ( eq .  [ eqn : dc ] ) . compared to the ccd ( eq .  [ eqn : sens : ccd ] ) , this results in a sensitivity gain of @xmath39 for the alps experiment .",
    "this proves the gain of using a tes - based detector instead of the ccd camera system to detect single 1064 nm photons .",
    "furthermore , we are motivated to improve the alps tes detector .",
    "most promising is to reduce the thermal background by using an optical bandpass filter and an improved analysis for pile - up rejection .",
