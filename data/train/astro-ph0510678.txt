    "new stellar evolution models which include the effects of rotationally induced mixing ( heger & langer 2000 ; meynet & maeder 2000 ) have considerably changed our understanding of the evolution of high - mass stars , particularly during the early phases of core hydrogen burning .",
    "rotation is now recognized as an important physical effect which substantially changes the lifetimes , chemical yields and stellar evolution .",
    "theoretical predictions can be observationally tested , and some attempts at this have already been made ( c.f .",
    "venn et al .  2002 ) .    chemical analysis of the components of binary stars with precisely known fundamental stellar parameters allows a powerful comparison with theory .",
    "however , the precision of empirical abundances from double - lined binaries is hampered by increased line blending and by dilution of the spectral lines in the composite spectra .",
    "the techniques of spectral disentangling ( simon & sturm 1994 ; hadrava 1995 ) and doppler tomography ( bagnuolo & gies 1991 ) overcome these difficulties by separating the spectra of the individual components contained in a time - series of composite spectra taken over the orbital cycle .    [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]",
    "several different sets of spectra were obtained for both binaries .",
    "we will briefly describe these observations .    _",
    "v453 cyg _ : this binary was observed in 1991 and 1992 with the 2.2-m telescope at german - spanish astronomical center on calar alto , spain .",
    "four spectral windows were observed with the coud spectrograph .",
    "a total of 28 spectra were collected .",
    "these spectra were kindly put at our disposal by dr .",
    "klaus simon .",
    "further description can be found in simon & sturm ( 1994 ) .",
    "another similar set , in two spectral windows , was secured by one of the authors ( js ) in 2001 with the 2.5-m isaac newton telescope at la palma ( southworth et al .",
    "2004 ) . a total of 41 spectra were obtained .",
    "an additional set of six spectra in the red region centred on h@xmath0 were secured by dh on the 1.2-m telescope at the dao in 2001 .    _",
    "v380 cyg _ : eight spectra centred on h@xmath1 were obtained by pk and kp at the coud spectrograph on the 2-m telescope in ondejov in 2004 .",
    "an additional two spectra in the same region were obtained by pk on the 1.2-m telescope at the dao , victoria , also in 2004 .",
    "an additional set of eight red spectra centred on h@xmath0 , from the same telescope , were obtained by sy in 2002 and are also used here .    to isolate the individual spectra of both components in v453 cyg we have made use of the spectral disentangling technique ( simon & sturm 1994 , hadrava 1995 ) .",
    "the computer codes fdbinary ( iliji et al .  2004 ) and cres ( iliji 2004 ) , which rely on the fourier transform technique ( hadrava 1995 ) , and the svd technique in wavelength space ( simon & sturm 1994 ) , respectively , were used .",
    "spectral disentangling is a powerful method which has found a variety of applications in close binary research ( c.f .",
    "holmgren et al .",
    "1998 ; hensberge et al .",
    "2000 ; harries et al .  2003 ; harmanec et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "the non - lte line - formation calculations are performed using detail and surface ( butler & giddings 1985 ) .",
    "however , hydrostatic , plane - parallel , line - blanketed lte model atmospheres calculated with the atlas9 code ( kurucz 1983 ) have also been used .",
    "this hybrid approach has been compared with the state - of - the - art non - lte model atmosphere calculations and excellent agreement has been found for the hydrogen and helium lines ( przbylla 2005 ) .",
    "in the observed spectral ranges the helium abundance can be derived only from the lines centred at 4378 , 4471 , 4718 and 6678  . as discussed by lyubimkov et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , calculations for he i 4378  are less reliable using detail since only transitions up to level @xmath2 are considered explicitly .",
    "since level populations can be affected by the microturbulent parameter @xmath3 it should be also included in calculations and adjusted to the observed line profiles .",
    "first , a check and slight adjustment of the effective temperature to the individual component spectra for v453 cyg , and the primary of v380 cyg , has been made .",
    "as an example , fitting of the calculated to the observed line profiles of the h@xmath1 line is shown in fig .  1",
    ". a simultaneous fit of the helium abundance @xmath4 , and microturbulent velocity @xmath3 has then been performed from the grid of the calculated spectra , while @xmath5 and @xmath6 have been kept fixed .",
    "the helium enrichment has been found for the primary component in the system v380 cyg by lyubimkov et al .",
    "the helium abundance they derived , @xmath7 , is considerably larger than the value derived in the present work .",
    "the complete analysis and discussion of possible sources of the discrepancy will be published elsewhere .",
    "recently , lyubimkov et al .  ( 2004 ) have derived the helium abundances in a large sample of early - b type stars .",
    "their results are plotted in fig .  3 as open symbols .",
    "this confirmed their finding that helium is becoming enriched in high - mass stars already on the main sequence .",
    "however , due to large errors in deriving the fundamental parameters for the single stars , there is considerable scatter in their diagram .",
    "overplotted by filled symbols are results for the components of eclipsing , double - lined spectroscopic binaries , in light - gray ( c.f .",
    "pavlovski 2004 ) . in dark - gray",
    "are presented the results of this work .",
    "the general finding that in the later phases on the main sequence helium is enriched is confirmed , but there is disagreement for early phases for which results from the close binaries are very consistent and are giving a helium abundance close to the solar value .",
    "however , the sample is still rather limited and more work is needed to have complete picture on the helium enrichment on the ms for high - mass stars ."
