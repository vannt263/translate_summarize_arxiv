    "magnetars , which are observed as soft gamma repeaters ( sgrs ) and anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ; for reviews , see @xcite ) , are considered to be isolated neutron stars with strong magnetic fields of 10@xmath510@xmath6gauss , which exceeds the quantum critical field @xmath7 of about @xmath8 10@xmath5gauss @xcite .",
    "they are known to exhibit emissions as sporadic bursts , which are classified into three kinds according to their luminosities and durations : `` giant flares '' , `` intermediate flares , '' and `` short bursts . ''",
    "spectra of all three giant flares observed to date are characterized by optically thin thermal bremsstrahlung ( ottb ) with plasma temperature @xmath9 from a few tens to hundreds of kev @xcite .",
    "however , some observational results in the energy spectra have indicated different spectral shapes from ottb , such as a single hard power - law model with an exponential cutoff function ( ple , @xcite ) , and a hard power - law extending to above 1 mev in energy range @xcite .",
    "x - ray spectra of intermediate flares and short bursts are usually reproduced by a combination of two - blackbody components ( 2bb ) with temperatures of @xmath10@xmath11kev and @xmath12@xmath13kev @xcite . @xcite and @xcite discovered high - energy photons extending into the sub - mev band in spectra of accumulated weak short bursts from sgr  0501@xmath144516 and axp  1e  1547.0@xmath05408 , respectively .",
    "since the spectral shapes of the bursts in the sub - mev band are complicated and not yet clarified , the spectra need to be better quantified in order to investigate the emission mechanisms .",
    "axp  1e  1547.0@xmath05408  ( sgr  j1550@xmath05418 , psr  j1550@xmath05418 ) , presented in this paper , is a magnetar associated with a young supernova remnant g327.24@xmath00.13 @xcite . according to the spin period ( @xmath15s ) and spin - down rate ( @xmath16 4.8 @xmath17 s / s ) reported by @xcite ,",
    "the dipole surface magnetic field strength and characteristic age are estimated to be about 3.2 @xmath1810@xmath19 gauss and @xmath20kyr , respectively .",
    "these features make this object relatively young and the fastest - known rotating magnetar . on 2009",
    "january 22 , the object entered an active phase and produced a large number of short bursts , as detected by swift @xcite , fermi @xcite , integral @xcite , konus - wind ( @xcite , 2009b , 2009c ) , rhessi @xcite , and suzaku @xcite .",
    "this activity was observed by several high - energy missions , creating a good opportunity for investigating the broadband spectra of magnetar short bursts and intermediate flares in detail .",
    "broadband spectral properties have been reported by several authors ( e.g. , @xcite ) , but these observations are limited to energies below about @xmath21 kev .    in this paper , we focus on spectral analysis of an energetic burst that occurred at utc 2009 january 22 06:45:13 and was observed by the suzaku wide - band all - sky monitor ( wam ; @xcite ) .",
    "the large effective area and wide energy range available from the wam enable us to investigate the 0.166.2 mev spectra of this energetic event .",
    "we also compare our results with spectra having persistent emission and stacked weak short bursts , as observed from this source by suzaku ( @xcite , 2012 ) . in the following sections , we assume a distance to 1e  1547.0@xmath05408  of @xmath22 kpc @xcite and use ` hxdbstjudge ` , ` hxdmkwamlc ` , and ` hxdmkwamspec ` , which are standard ftools included in the headas software package version 6.13 .",
    "the quoted errors are for a @xmath23 confidence level .",
    "the wam is an active shield crystal in the hard x - ray detector ( hxd , @xcite ) on - board the suzaku satellite @xcite .",
    "it comprises four walls ( wam-0 , wam-1 , wam-2 and wam-3 ) made of bismuth orthogermanate bi@xmath24ge@xmath25o@xmath26 ( bgo ) crystals , which were initially designed to measure the sub - mev gamma - ray spectrum in the nominal range of 50kev to 5mev .",
    "however , the energy range has shifted to range between 70 kev and 6.2 mev range of photon energy due to long term degradation of gain at the time of measurement .",
    "the four detectors form the lateral sides of a square tube , and each has an acceptance of 2@xmath27 sr with a nominal direction having effective area of 400 @xmath28 at 1 mev .",
    "their nominal directions have azimuth angles of @xmath29 ( wam-0 ) , @xmath30 ( wam-1 ) , @xmath31 ( wam-2 ) , and @xmath32 ( wam-3 ) , all with a zenith angle at @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is defined as the hxd on - axis . among currently working gamma - ray spectrometers on - board astronomical satellites ,",
    "the wam has the largest effective area for energies within 0.36.2mev .",
    "thanks to these characteristics , the wam has so far detected a large number of gamma - ray bursts and solar flares ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the wam produces two types of datasets : burst ( bst ) data and transient ( trn ) data .",
    "the bst data are recorded in four energy channels with time resolution of 1/64s , but they cover only 64 s around when sudden changes in count rates trigger the bst data acquisition in orbit .",
    "only one set of bst data can be stored in the on - board buffer before the spacecraft data recorder reads it out during passage through the south atlantic anomaly ( saa ) .",
    "after the readout , the onboard buffer becomes recordable again .",
    "because of this limitation , we can obtain at most about ten bst data sets in a day , but we lose later bst data if other flares occur soon after recording is triggered .",
    "in contrast , the trn data are continuously accumulated with a 1-s time resolution in 55 energy channels covering 70kev6.2mev , except for during bias - voltage reduction due to saa passage .",
    "the absolute time accuracies of these two datasets are @xmath35s @xcite .    on 2009",
    "january 22 , @xcite first reported short burst activities from 1e  1547.0@xmath05408 . at the same time",
    ", the wam had successfully record a series of bright burst - like events .",
    "figure [ fig : lightcurve ] shows the light curves of wam-0 trn data during this activity ( observational i d = 703049010 , covering january 19 23:3022 22:32 ) .",
    "a long - term trend on the hour scale is normally seen on calm days which is caused by fluctuations in the non - x - ray background induced by trapped charge particles .",
    "in addition to this background variation , we also see a large number of extremely bright bursts for about @xmath36 hours . although the wam is a non - imaging detector , we consider these bursts to have come from 1e  1547.0@xmath05408  because many of them were simultaneously detected by several high - energy missions , including integral , swift , fermi , and konus / wind .",
    "a detailed examination of the origin is described in  [ sec : detection ] and  [ sec : angle ] .",
    "note that since the highest fluence burst among those detected by the integral anti - coincident shield ( acs ) with pulsating tails at 06:48:04 @xcite was extremely bright , it triggered the wam safety functionality to turn off the detector high voltage ( orange zone in figure [ fig : lightcurve ] ) .",
    "( 80mm,80mm)fig1left.eps ( 80mm,80mm)fig1right.eps",
    "in order to extract the short bursts from the wam light curves , we used ` hxdbstjudge ` with input parameters of ` bgd_integ_time = 8 ` , ` delta_t = 1 ` and ` sigma = 5.5 ` , which produces detection criteria of ( 1 ) calculating the average count rate every 8s , which is treated as the background level before any given time , and ( 2 ) comparing it with the count rate every 1s , which could include both flare signal and background components , then ( 3 ) judging the burst when the flare signal ( 2 ) exceeds 5.5-fold the standard deviation of the background level ( 1 ) .",
    "consequently , for the wam light curves in figure [ fig : lightcurve ] , 254 , 176 , 39 , and 41 events were successfully detected by wam-0 , wam-1 , wam-2 , and wam-3 , respectively , in energy channels 211 ( 70500kev ) . in the upper energy band in energy channels 1254 , which covers 0.56.2mev ,",
    "only three events were detected that satisfied the criteria above .",
    "these occurred at utc january 22 06:45:13 , 06:47:56 , and 08:17:29 .",
    "the derived degrees of significance are 39.2 , 6.1 and 8.5 sigma . among all detected bursts , 5 events , with trigger times of utc 01:28:59 , 02:46:56 , 04:34:52 , 15:10:34 , and 17:02:55 ,",
    "were stored in the bst data format .",
    "the @xmath37 durations , that is , the time to accumulate between 5@xmath38 and 95@xmath38 of the counts , of the events were distributed from 0.13 s to 2.0 s , and were reported in a gamma - ray burst ( grb ) coordinate network circular @xcite .",
    "no bursts that satisfied the criteria were detected in the wam-0 light curves on the day before or the day after the activity .",
    "the time duration between the first detection at 00:57:20 and the last one at 17:02:56 is 58ks , while the total off - time due to saa passage and the wam safety functionality is 8ks .",
    "if we assume that these bursts come from 1e  1547.0@xmath05408 , no occultation of the object by the earth is expected from the satellite attitude during the observations .",
    "therefore net exposure of the target source was 50ks , and wam-0 detected the short bursts at a frequency of @xmath39s@xmath3 on average .",
    "the acs detected 233 bursts from utc january 21 18:11 to january 23 04:27 @xcite .",
    "although the wam has no imaging capability , the count rate ratio between wam-0 and wam-1 provides information about the angle of incidence of irradiating photons .",
    "we examined the ratio of count rates between wam-0 and wam-1 for the bursts detected by both sides in energy channels 211 to check consistency with the assumption that they are from 1e  1547.0@xmath05408 .",
    "the top panel of figure [ fig : hist ] shows a scatter plot of the count rate in wam-0 and the ratio of count rate between wam-0 and wam1 .",
    "since the statistical errors are comparatively large for dim bursts , distributions of the count rate ratios are shown separately for events brighter or weaker than @xmath40countss@xmath3 with wam-0 .",
    "the results follow lognormal gaussian shapes well , with mean values of @xmath41 and @xmath42 , and sigmas of @xmath43 and @xmath44 for brighter and weaker events , respectively .",
    "the dispersion of the weaker burst distribution is explained by the statistical poisson distribution law .",
    "the difference in mean values between the two distributions is mainly due to a pile - up effect in the wam analog signal processing unit . for comparison ,",
    "the expected ratio of count rates can be calculated from the assumed target position ( i.e. , 1e  1547.0@xmath05408 ) and the energy response function of the wam detectors . according to the location of the object by @xcite and the attitude of the satellite , the incident angles from the object to the wam are zenith angle @xmath45 and azimuthal angle @xmath46 .",
    "this requires a count rate ratio of @xmath47 in a lognormal frame ( shown in red in figure [ fig : hist ] bottom ) , with the errors , as estimated from the systematic error in the effective areas of the wam response matrix , at 30% @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the observed ratios of count rates are both consistent with the expected values under the assumption that the signals come from 1e  1547.0@xmath05408  ( to within systematic error bounds ) , although the centroids are not well aligned .",
    "we also checked the grb coordinate network circular and archive of solar flares , and confirmed that there were no reports of other astronomical transient events in the same period .",
    "we therefore concluded that all the bursts detected by the wam came from the direction of the magnetar .",
    "we hereafter use data from the two well - irradiated sides wam-0 and wam-1 in the analysis .",
    "( 80mm,80mm)fig2.eps      among all the bursts detected by wam-0 , only three events are also detected in the high - energy band between 0.56.2mev , as described in ",
    "[ sec : detection ] .",
    "detection times were utc january 22 06:45:13 , 06:47:56 , and 08:17:29 . the hardness ratios of these , defined as the ratio of the count rate in the 0.56.2mev band to that in the 70500kev band , are 0.021 @xmath48 , 0.013 @xmath48 , and 0.0026 @xmath49 , respectively .",
    "in particular , the burst observed at 06:45:13 is the hardest ( arrows in figure [ fig : lightcurve ] ) .",
    "we hereafter call this event `` the hardest burst '' and present spectral analysis of this burst in the following sections .",
    "the ratio of count rates between wam-0 and wam-1 is @xmath50 in a lognormal frame , which is within 1.1 @xmath51 from the mean of the distribution of brighter bursts .",
    "the hardest burst was observed only in the trn data ( i.e. , no bst data are available ) because the previous event had been stored and the hardest burst was not able to trigger the high - time - resolution bst mode . @xcite and @xcite reported that integral / acs detected this burst at utc 06:45:13.9 as the brightest event and labeled it with identifier number 121 and * b * with properties of a duration of 1.45s , peak flux of @xmath52erg@xmath2s@xmath3 , and fluence of @xmath53erg@xmath2 .",
    "those properties are comparable with the intermediate class among the three kinds of magnetar bursts . the detailed acs light curve ( trigger i d = 2009 - 01 - 22 06:44:36 )",
    "is published in the heavens archive with 50-ms time resolution in the 80kev8mev energy range .",
    "although the acs has no energy information about each photon , it provides a high - time - resolution light curve in similar energy bands to those from wam .",
    "figure [ fig : detailedlightcurve ] shows the light curves obtained by wam and acs .",
    "we observe an apparent time lag , which is considered to be due to time of flight of photons between suzaku and integral . in the following analysis",
    ", we corrected for this time difference of 410ms calculated from the orbit information of the both satellites at the hardest burst . according to @xcite using the bst data triggered by classical grbs , a correction accuracy of the time of flight is @xmath54ms for bright events .",
    "to perform spectral analysis of the hardest burst defined in  [ sec : hardestburst ] , we extracted energy spectra of three source intervals and estimated the background spectra of wam-0 and wam-1 as follows .",
    "we extracted time - averaged spectra of the hardest burst between 06:45:13.3 ( modified julian day = 54853.28140379 , hereafter @xmath55 ) and 06:45:15.3 ( 54853.28142694 ) from trn format data .",
    "since we used data with 1-s time resolution and the duration of the hardest burst is 1.5 s @xcite , the first 1-s region ( @xmath55@xmath56s ) is defined as the peak and the following region ( @xmath56s@xmath57s ) as the tail .",
    "background spectra are extracted from the average of before and after the hardest burst time regions , specifically , from @xmath58 s to @xmath59 s and from @xmath60 s to @xmath61 s , respectively , avoiding detected short bursts with wam-0 and wam-1 , shown in  [ sec : detection ] .",
    "the time intervals used for the background are shown in figure [ fig : lightcurve ] as red lines .",
    "figure [ fig : rawspec ] shows the extracted spectra in count rate space .",
    "( 90mm,90mm)fig4.eps    since it is difficult to avoid contamination by weak undetected bursts using the above background estimation , we compared the obtained background spectra with those from another method , using cut - off rigidity ( cor , @xcite ) to investigate whether the estimated time - averaged background spectra are suitable for performing spectral analysis . in the cor method , the background flux and spectra are estimated from the data observed one day before and after the target event .",
    "the reproducibility of this method is reported to be typically about 78% @xcite .",
    "we therefore added 8% systematic error to cor background spectra for comparison with the time - averaged background spectra .",
    "figure [ fig : comparebgd ] shows the estimated background spectra .",
    "the count rates of each energy channel in the background spectra are consistent within the error in the energy range above 200kev , while in the range below 200kev , the count rate of the time - averaged background is higher than the cor background by about @xmath13 percentage points .",
    "this is thought to be due to the time - averaged background including weak unresolved bursts .",
    "however since the response matrix uncertainty below 160kev is insufficient under current calibration @xcite , we can not examine the possible unresolved short bursts in detail . in order to perform spectral analysis",
    ", we therefore ignored the range below 160kev and added a systematic error of 15% to energy bins in the range between 160 and 200kev , and applied the time - averaged background spectra to the three intervals .",
    "( 80mm,80mm)fig5.eps      the response matrices of the wam depend on angle of incidence of photons since the wam is mounted inside a spacecraft and the observed spectra are heavily affected by absorption by the satellite structure . in order to calculate the responses of the detectors , we use a geant4-based monte - carlo simulation code @xcite .",
    "the uncertainties of the matrices have been studied before launch by ground calibration measurements of radio - isotope irradiation tests at various incident angles @xcite and also confirmed by in - orbit cross calibration between the swift - bat , the konus - wind , and the suzaku - wam using grb spectra @xcite , and by an earth - occultation technique using crab nebula spectra @xcite .",
    "the absolute flux for the incident angle of 1e  1547.0@xmath05408  ( @xmath45 , @xmath46 ) has uncertainty of about @xmath62% , which can be seen by referring to figure 18 in @xcite . since the satellite structure on the wam-0 side is not as complex as that on the other sides , the effective area for the wam-0 is the most reliable among those of the sides .",
    "therefore , we leave the normalization factor of wam-1 with respect to the wam-0 side as a free parameter in the spectral fitting below .",
    "the hardest burst was too bright to measure the exact peak flux by acs observation @xcite .",
    "the obtained peak count rate of wam-0 exceeded @xmath63 countss@xmath3 , and dead time occupies 69% of 1-s exposure .",
    "since the data are highly affected by the pile - up effect , we developed a data - acquisition pile - up simulator of the wam system to correct for the pile - up effect .",
    "the detailed design of the simulator is reported in appendixes [ sec : developingsim ] and [ sec : demonstrationsim ] .",
    "the tool simulates the analog signal processing in the on - board electronics .",
    "the input data are a background spectrum , a light curve , response matrix , and spectral model ; and the output is a spectral model affected by the pile - up effect with instrumental response . by comparing the output model that considers the pile - up effect with the observed real spectrum",
    ", we searched the best - fit parameters by using a monte - carlo approach and calculated the chi - squared values .",
    "we performed time - averaged spectral analysis using our data - acquisition pile - up simulator described in  [ sec : resppileup ] . as the first step , we applied four single - component models consisting of a blackbody ( bb ) , an ottb , a power - law ( pl ) , and a pl with an exponential cut - off ( ple ) .",

    "similarly , for the hard component of the bb@xmath14ple model during the peak and tail intervals , the photon index ( @xmath790.91.5 ) and cut - off energy ( @xmath80kev ) are consistent with those in the persistent emission ( @xmath791.31.5 and @xmath81kev ; @xcite ) .",

    "furthermore , in order to compare the energy partition rate to each radiation component among the three different emissions from the object , figure [ fig : luminosityrelation ] shows a scatter plot of the luminosity in the bolometric bb luminosity ( @xmath82 or @xmath83 ) and the 1300kev luminosity ( @xmath84 ) of the pl component .",

    "1.5s ; @xcite ) than the spin period of the object or dimmer radiation energy than typical flux of giant flares ( 10@xmath93erg ) .",
    "the properties of the hardest burst are as if the burst was a `` small - scale giant flare '' , and match those of the intermediate flares @xcite . therefore",
    ", this hardest burst could be the missing link between giant flares and intermediate flares , which are expected to have the same radiation mechanisms because the former commonly follow the latter by several days or months .",
    "however , a giant flare has not been observed from 1e  1547.0@xmath05408  to date .",
    "we attempt to explain the acs light curve ( figure [ fig : detailedlightcurve ] ) by using the same interpretation of giant flares as @xcite , which describes the rapid phenomena as a cooling of a trapped pair - photon fireball forced in a strong magnetic field : @xmath94 , where @xmath95 and @xmath96 indicate the evaporation time and benchmark of the fireball geometry , respectively . according to @xcite",
    ", the index @xmath96 indicates the dimension of the fireball surface : @xmath97 for spherical , @xmath98 for cylindrical , and @xmath99 for thin slab .",
    "the trapped fireball model is nicely fitted to the giant flares @xcite and some intermediate flares @xcite . in typical short bursts , an exponential function is often utilized to represent the decay shape . in our analysis ,",
    "the acs light curve of the hardest burst is found to be well described by a combination of the above two components . the best - fit model for the time interval of utc 06:45:14.116.2 , excepting the initial bright spike ,",
    "is shown in figure [ fig : detailedlightcurve ] . the fitting yields the following parameters : a time constant @xmath100 s of the exponential component , an evaporation time @xmath101 s and an index @xmath102 of the trapped fireball component with degree of freedom over chi - square of 104.4/42 .    comparing the light curve fitting with the spectral fitting results (  [ sec : timeresospec ] )",
    ", we can consider that the trapped fireball and the exponential components reflect temporal flux variation of the bb and the ottb / ple component , respectively . in the bb@xmath14ple spectral fitting during the tail interval , the calculated photon numbers of the bb and the ple component are about @xmath103 and @xmath104 , respectively , extrapolating the spectral model to the acs energy range ( 80kev8mev ) .",
    "the ratio of photon numbers is qualitatively consistent , with the trapped fireball component having a higher count rate than the exponential component during the tail interval in the light curve fitting ( figure [ fig : detailedlightcurve ] ) .",
    "previous reported indices @xmath96 of giant flares of sgr  1806@xmath020 on 2004 december 27 and sgr  1900@xmath1414 on 1998 august 27 are 1.5 @xcite and 3 @xcite , and a intermediate flare from sgr  1900@xmath1414 is described by two trapped fireball of @xmath105 and 0.1 @xcite . therefore , our results for the hardest burst of 1e  1547.0@xmath05408  are similar to intermediate flares . among these little samples , we found that the index @xmath96 of the intermediate flares tends to be smaller than giant flares .",
    "since the duration of the acs light curve of 1.45 s @xcite is significantly longer than the half rotation period ( 2.1/2 @xmath106 1.05 s ) , we should note that the time - variation may not reflect intrinsic evolution of the emission . +",

    "if more than one photon comes into the detectors in a time interval shorter than the processing pitch of the on - board electronics , these events are not able to be separated into individual events and thus become treated as a high - energy event or a non - x - ray event . in other words ,",
    "the spectral shape becomes harder in the case of very bright sources , and thus estimation of the pile - up effect on spectra is important .",
    "we therefore developed a pile - up simulation code based on the c++ programming language to reproduce the on - board analog electronics ( tpu : transient data processing unit , @xcite ) and to correct the effect .",
    "we utilized the sllib and sfitsio libraries for reading and writing the flexible imaging transport system ( fits ) data format files .",
    "the inputs are a background spectrum , a light curve , a response matrix , and the spectral model , and the output is the spectral model affected by the pile - up effect .",
    "the simulator plays the following role .",
    "first , it reads the input files and calculates the incident event number .",
    "second , based on the shapes of the input spectra and the light curve , the simulator randomizes the arrival time and photon energy . the time and energy information",
    "are applied to individual incident events .",
    "third , these events pass thorough the reproduced processing algorithm of the analog electronics tpu .",
    "it is at this point that they are affected by the pile - up effect .",
    "moreover , the simulator accumulates the spectrum from those events .",
    "finally , these three steps are repeated 128 times with different random seeds .",
    "the simulator calculates an average spectrum assuming a poisson distribution , which it writes out to a fits format file as the output model .",
    "the absolute flux is estimated by the count rate and the dead time reported by the on - board electronics tpu .",
    "similarly , the pile - up simulator also reports both the count rate and dead time as a response to the incident count rate , which is unknown . in order to verify the pile - up simulator",
    ", we checked if the relation between the count rate observed and dead time from the simulator matched the relationship by tpu even for brighter than usual cases .",
    "for this , we used five bright solar flares observed by the wam after 2009 as shown in figure [ fig : livetime ] . the dead time and count",
    "rate values were extracted from public trn data of wam-0 with temporal resolution of 1s .",
    "these solar flares were observed in 2010 february 12 , 2011 august 09 , 2012 january 23 , 2012 march 07 and 2012 july 06 , and are classed as goes class m8.3 , x6.9 , m8.7 , x5.4 and x1.1 , respectively .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : livetime ] , the pile - up simulator well reproduced the real data , and the reproducibility is a lot lower than the uncertainty of the response matrixes of 30% . in particular , the dead times of the hardest burst spectra for 1.21s ( wam-0 ) and 1.14s ( wam-1 ) to 2 s exposures",
    "correspond to 0.61ss@xmath3 and 0.57ss@xmath3 , respectively , and in figure [ fig : livetime ] reproducibility around these dead times is within 1% .",
    "the weight of inflection of the spectral shape due to the pile - up effect depends on the light curve , response matrix , background spectrum , source spectrum , and brightness .",
    "we demonstrated the dependence on brightness as shown in figure [ fig : demonstration ] using the pile - up simulator with two spectral models of bb of 40kev and single pl function of photon index @xmath107 and the data of the hardest burst ; the light curve of the spi - acs , the calculated response matrix , the estimated background spectrum of wam-0 in  [ sec : dataselection ] .",
    "these demonstrations indicate that observed spectral shapes are greatly changed by the pile - up effect depending on the input photon number .",
    "in particular in the case of higher flux ( orange and red lines in figure [ fig : demonstration ] ) , the flux in the lower energy range is strongly decreased and the higher energy range is increased compared to the original spectrum unaffected by the pile - up effect . observed count rate of the hardest burst is comparable with the lines of second higher flux cases ( orange lines in figure [ fig : demonstration ] ) . therefore to investigate original spectral shape and flux of the hardest burst , correction of the pile - up effects is important .",
