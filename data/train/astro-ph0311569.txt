    "the optical afterglow of grb  000301c , at a redshift of @xmath6 , exhibited variability prior to the break in the power law decline in its lightcurve .",
    "this variability has been interpreted as gravitational microlensing ( garnavich , loeb & stanek 2000 ) , as first proposed by loeb & perna ( 1998 ) .",
    "while there is no obvious intervening galaxy which might provide lenses in the form of stars or machos , we will take this possibility seriously .",
    "koopmans and wambsganss ( 2001 ) considered lensing by machos ( see also wyithe & turner ( 2002b ) ) , but as we will explain in  [ discussion ] we find a rate of macho lensing five times larger than theirs",
    ". the rate of microlensing by stars is much lower , and is naively of order one in three hundred grbs at redshift two .",
    "we note that microlensing is not the only possible explanation of this lightcurve ( panaitescu 2001 ) .",
    "several authors have considered using microlensing to study the properties of the underlying afterglow ( granot & loeb 2001 ; gaudi & loeb 2001 ; gaudi , granot & loeb 2001 ; ioka & nakamura 2001 ) . in this work",
    "we will only make statements about afterglows in the aggregate .",
    "assuming that there is a fraction @xmath7 of dark matter in machos , it is not surprising that a lensing event was seen .",
    "however , if the only cosmological microlenses are stars , the observation of an event is somewhat problematic .",
    "roughly thirty afterglows have been well  characterized ( starting with metzger et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and kulkarni et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and summarized in frail et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and bloom , frail & kulkarni ( 2003 ) ) .",
    "we investigate whether magnification bias can make a significant difference , considering the two extreme possibilities that the optical and gamma ray fluxes are perfectly correlated or perfectly uncorrelated . in appendix",
    "[ appdx : binary ] we consider binary lenses , as discussed by mao & loeb ( 2001 ) .",
    "neither of these two effects seems to be able to increase the probability by a factor of ten .",
    "we thus conclude that the observation of a second microlensing event by a star in a sample twice as large is quite unlikely , though with a large macho fraction the probability can be significant .    in  [ physics ]",
    "we summarize the basic physics involved in gamma ray burst fireballs , and give an overview of the multiwavelength observations . in  [ microlensing ]",
    "we derive the cosmological microlensing rate ( relegating the details for binary lenses to appendix  [ appdx : binary ] ) . in the remaining sections (  [ bias ]   [ sample ] ) we discuss the enhancement of the lensing probability due to magnification bias ( turner , gott & ostriker 1984 ) . magnification bias is the effect that a given _ detected _ source is more likely to be lensed than a source chosen randomly , simply because magnified sources are easier to detect .",
    "we will consider both the usual single magnification bias , as well as double magnification bias which might be relevant here because of the way gamma - ray burst afterglows are selected .",
    "the selection is complicated , involving gamma ray , x - ray and optical wavelengths .",
    "we can only hope to capture the basic features . in  [ bias ] &  [ doublebias ] we consider how the magnification bias affects bursts at a single redshift , while in  [ sample ] we consider the magnification bias on the sample of well  measured afterglows in bloom et al .",
    "( 2003 ) .",
    "we primarily consider the gravitational lensing caused by point mass lenses .",
    "we define the distance to the source @xmath8 , lens @xmath9 , and deflector  source distance @xmath10 .",
    "these distances are all angular diameter distances in physical units , and we take a flat cosmology where @xmath11 . we define the einstein radius and the einstein angle for the system as @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the mass of the point lens .",
    "the basic picture of a gamma - ray burst ( grb ) afterglow is a fireball with a relativistic jet with some small opening angle ( e.g.  waxman 1997a ) .",
    "the observed afterglow light is emitted in a ring of opening angle @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the lorentz factor of the ejecta moving at velocity @xmath16 .",
    "this ring expands at an apparent rate @xmath17 , the so  called superluminal expansion .",
    "this superluminal expansion is what allows for rapid microlens variability , even at cosmological distances ( loeb & perna 1998 ) .",
    "we take the radius of the afterglow ring in units of the einstein radius from waxman ( 1997b ) and garnavich et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the isotropic burst energy in units of @xmath20 ergs , and @xmath21 is the ambient gas density in units of 1 @xmath22 .",
    "we will assume for this work that we want a microlensing event to occur at some minimum time after the grb , to allow for optical observations . to enforce this assumption",
    "we take @xmath23 , typically achieved roughly one tenth day after the burst at a redshift of @xmath2 .",
    "we define the fractional apparent width of the emitting region @xmath24 , where the emission comes in the annulus between @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "in fact , there is some emission throughout the interior of the ring , but the inner part is less bright ( granot , piran & sari 1999 ) .    for our later calculation , we need to know the intrinsic ( not apparent ) luminosity function of grbs , at different wavebands . this is a subject of much uncertainty at the moment .",
    "schaefer , deng & band ( 2001 ) found that the luminosity function @xmath27 at gamma - ray energies is a power law of slope @xmath28 at the faint end .",
    "this result is obtained by assuming a lag  variability relation .",
    "note that bursts of all durations are included in their analysis , whereas bursts for which afterglows have been observed fall into the long duration category ( as localization of the bursts is typically done with bepposax observations which are insensitive to bursts with durations less than about a second ) .",
    "frail et al .",
    "( 2001 ) demonstrated using about 20 afterglows that the total energy output is remarkably constant from burst to burst , about @xmath29 ergs , most of which comes out in gamma - ray .",
    "bloom et al .",
    "( 2003 ) confirmed this result with a larger sample of about 30 afterglows .",
    "however , what is important to us is not the true total energy , but rather the isotropic equivalent energy .",
    "it is the latter that determines the effective luminosity of the burst ( i.e. the observed fluence is proportional to the isotropic equivalent energy divided by the luminosity distance squared ) .",
    "the two are related via a geometrical factor determined by the opening angle of the burst .",
    "the luminosity function is therefore determined by the distribution of opening angles .",
    "frail et al .",
    "( 2001 ) derived this distribution using the observed jet break times .",
    "however , it is important to keep in mind that the distribution of opening angles is obtained from a flux - limited sample . to relate that to the intrinsic distribution of opening angles , and therefore luminosities , would require detailed modeling of the selection , which is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "krumholz , thorsett & harrison ( 1998 ) derived constraints on the grb luminosity function by matching the number - peak - flux relation in the batse catalog ( see also rutledge , hui & lewin 1995 ) , as well as making use of three bursts with known redshifts at the time . assuming that the redshift distribution follows the global star formation history ( see madau et al .",
    "1996 ; madau , pozzetti & dickinson 1998 ; wijers et al .",
    "1998 ) , they find that a power - law slope of @xmath30 to @xmath31 is consistent with observations ( see fig .  1 in krumholz et al . 1998 ) .",
    "the luminosity function at optical wavebands is even more uncertain , because of the limited number of afterglows . on theoretical grounds ,",
    "one expects the gamma - ray emission to be well correlated with x - ray , but not with the optical .",
    "this is because the x - ray frequencies are generally above the various characteristic frequencies of the relativistic fireball , such as e.g.  the synchrotron self  absorption frequency , whereas the ( unknown ) relative ordering of the characteristic frequencies affects the optical flux significantly",
    ". some observational evidence of this can be found in freedman & waxman ( 2001 ) ( see also useful discussions in kumar ( 2000 ) and sari , piran & narayan ( 1998 ) ) . for our later investigation , we will examine both the case where the gamma - ray / x - ray and optical emission are well - correlated , and the case where they are not .",
    "as far as the slope of the optical luminosity function is concerned , we will assume , for simplicity and the lack of evidence to the contrary , it is the same as that for the gamma - ray emission .",
    "observation of an optical afterglow has a complicated selection process , which we will outline here .",
    "first , the burst is detected in gamma - rays ( @xmath32 kev or so ) by batse , but it is at lower x - ray energies that the bursts are localized by e.g.  bepposax . after a localization ,",
    "an attempt to measure the optical afterglow can be made .",
    "thus , to detect an optical afterglow , there are effectively three thresholds that must be exceeded . the gamma - ray and x - ray fluxes",
    "are believed to be well  correlated , but the correlation with the optical flux is uncertain ( granot & sari 2002 ) .",
    "the microlensing optical depth is defined as the number of lenses within some minimum impact parameter of the line of sight to an object .",
    "the basic optical depth , where the impact parameter is taken to be an einstein radius , is given by the following for a flat cosmology ( press & gunn 1973 ) : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the dimensionless coordinate distance , i.e.  the luminosity distance is @xmath35 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : tau ] we plot the optical depth as a function of redshift for several values of @xmath36 in a flat cosmology , dividing out the @xmath37 dependence .",
    "the quantity @xmath37 is the fraction of critical density today that is in objects capable of causing microlensing .",
    "we have assumed that the comoving number density of such objects is constant  if it decreases towards higher redshifts , the optical depth will be lower . for @xmath38 and @xmath2 ,",
    "the optical depth is @xmath39 .",
    "fukugita , hogan & peebles ( 1998 ) estimated @xmath37 in stars to be @xmath40 . with this value , constant out to redshift @xmath2 , the optical depth is 1/440 for @xmath38 , and is as large as 1/260 for @xmath41 , though the latter value for the matter density is strongly disfavored . for machos",
    ", we will simply assume that @xmath42 , namely that the halo macho fraction is universal . according to fukugita et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , roughly half of the baryons are accounted for at redshift zero , so the density of baryonic machos should not exceed @xmath43 , and thus @xmath44 for @xmath38 and @xmath45 .",
    "of course non - baryonic machos could have @xmath46 .",
    "we will thus take @xmath47 as the largest plausible value , though even this value has problems ( graff et al .",
    "1999 ; fields , freese & graff 2000 ) .",
    "there are limits on the cosmological abundance of machos of any kind ( dalcanton et al .",
    "1994 ) , but @xmath48 is allowed for stellar  mass lenses . in the baryonic case ,",
    "the optical depth to redshift @xmath2 is as large as 1/75 , which is not excessively smaller than the observed rate .    though we discussed excising the central region @xmath49 of the einstein ring in the previous section , to account for afterglow lensing events that happen too quickly to be detected",
    ", doing so has only a small effect on the rate , in fact this region is only 4% of the einstein ring .",
    "this cut will have a larger effect in the next section , where we will be discussing magnification bias .",
    "the actual optical depth of relevance depends on the magnification one is interested in .",
    "assuming @xmath50 is the magnification threshold of interest , the optical depth is : @xmath51=\\tau_0\\beta^2.\\ ] ] where @xmath52 is the peak magnification for the given lens system at a distance @xmath53 in einstein units from the burst . here , @xmath54 is the distance from the lens in einstein units where the peak magnification is @xmath50 .",
    "the symbol @xmath55 denotes a step function ( @xmath56 if @xmath57 , and zero otherwise ) . ignoring magnification bias , the optical depth @xmath58 is equal to the rate of microlensed grbs . for grb  000301c ,",
    "the peak magnification was approximately @xmath59 .    in table",
    "[ tab : tau ] we give the optical depth to lensing for several different magnification thresholds and we also consider three cases for the fractional width of the emitting ring in the gamma ray burst afterglow .",
    "we find that the consideration of binary lenses typically increases the optical depth , but not by a large amount ( see appendix  [ appdx : binary ] ) .",
    "the two main effects that we see are that binaries give a larger increase for narrower source rings , and a larger increase for larger thresholds .",
    "note that for this calculation , we only require that the peak magnification exceed the threshold , and we do not consider the detailed structure of the lightcurve .    in the remainder of this paper",
    ", we will assume that @xmath38 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 , which gives @xmath61 .",
    "we will consider both stellar lenses with @xmath62 and machos with @xmath42 .",
    "for microlensing of point sources , the probability of an impact parameter less than @xmath54 in einstein units , and thus a magnification greater than @xmath63 is simply given by @xmath64 we will use the approximate expression , and thus we need to truncate to ensure that @xmath65 , @xmath66 the probability density corresponding to this expression is now @xmath67 i.e. @xmath68 gives the probability that the magnification lies in the range @xmath69 . we will briefly discuss the effects of an inhomogeneous background mass distribution in  [ discussion ] .",
    "we now consider the magnification bias ( ignoring the complication of binary lenses , which as we have seen does not significantly affect the lensing rate ) .",
    "we compute the probability of a detectable microlensing event on the afterglow of a grb detected at high energy .",
    "the detectability of the grb at high energy will be affected by magnification bias as a point source .",
    "we then simply model the microlensing event as a detected grb with a lens between 0.2 and 1.2 einstein radii distant .",
    "the inner boundary allows a minimum time before peak magnification ( so that a bump in the lightcurve can be observed ) , and the outer boundary simply enforces that the magnification is in excess of roughly 2 in the peak ( for @xmath60 ) .",
    "the precise values of these parameters do not significantly affect our results , however , for luminosity functions with slopes @xmath70 .",
    "implicit in this prescription is the assumption that the magnification of the the gamma ray flux is the same as the magnification of the optical flux , when the optical flux is first detected .",
    "this is a good assumption as typically the afterglow would be detected in the regime where the emission region is small compared to the einstein radius , meaning the afterglow is effectively a point source when initially detected .",

    "this is clearly not the case , as mass in clustered in halos .",
    "we assume that all of the matter is in singular isothermal sphere halos with cutoffs ( @xmath156 ) .",
    "these will obey a luminosity  velocity dispersion relation , have luminosities taken from a press - schechter distribution , and have relation between cutoff radii and velocity dispersion , @xmath157 following koopmans & wambsganss ( 2001 ) , we will take @xmath158 , @xmath159 , as the fiducial case , with @xmath160 mpc@xmath161 , @xmath162 km s@xmath163 . to prescribe the cutoff radii ,",
    "we take @xmath164 , but the results are insensitive to the precise value of beta as long as it is not close to zero .",
    "we will compute @xmath165 by normalizing the total mass density to account for @xmath38 , namely all mass lies in halos .",
    "we find @xmath166    we now can easily compute the geometric cross section of halos , and the mean number of halos intersected on a line of sight to a particular redshift , @xmath167 even to moderate redshift , a significant number of halos are intersected . for grb  000301c  at @xmath6 , @xmath168 , and",
    "the approximation that halos do not overlap is therefore not accurate .",
    "this is the origin of our disagreement .",
    "we have shown that a large number of halos are typically intersected .",
    "however , there will be variations in the optical depth ( or equivalently , convergence ) between lines of sight .",
    "we have done a simple test , simulating the distribution of convergences and modifying the magnification distribution @xmath121 accordingly .",
    "the magnification bias we find does not vary by more than 15% in this case .",
    "we have shown that the consideration of magnification bias ( both single and double ) is important , in that the expected probability that a given observed gamma ray burst is microlensed can be roughly three times the naive optical depth estimate .",
    "machos making up half of the baryonic matter have a significant probability to cause such an event , but we find that stellar lenses alone have a very small probability ( less than 3% for any event in the afterglow sample ) to do so .",
    "we find that binaries can affect the gamma ray burst microlensing rate at the 25% level , which though surprisingly large , is not very significant .",
    "a single observed event with a low probability is not in itself problematic .",
    "however , should another microlensed gamma ray burst be observed in another thirty afterglows , we believe it would be a significant indication that there are significantly more lenses in the universe than can be inferred from stars . in that case",
    ", the effects we have calculated could be quite important in determining the exact density of lenses .",

    "we discuss the two point mass gravitational lens , a model that has been studied extensively ( schneider & wei  1986 ; erdl & schneider 1993 ) .",

    "the excess optical depth due to binaries is given by @xmath177 for the binary systems , we take a distribution flat in @xmath178 , and also flat in @xmath179 , where @xmath180 is the projected separation of the lenses on the sky , for the ensemble average ( baltz & gondolo 2001 ) .",
    "we adopt a complex parameterization ( witt 1990 ) of the lens system .",
    "we introduce complex angular coordinates on the plane of the sky , @xmath181 . given two lenses at angular positions @xmath182 and @xmath183 , a source at @xmath184 will have images at the solutions @xmath185 of the lens equation @xmath186 in this formalism , the jacobian of @xmath187 in eq .",

    "the total magnification is the sum of the individual magnifications of the images .    for a source of uniform surface brightness",

    "[ eq : dzdphi ] , since @xmath199 .",
    "given that we have the gamma ray fluxes for this sample of bursts , we could consider using that information in the determination of the probability .",
    "in particular , we could write the probability for an observed burst with apparent flux @xmath200 and redshift @xmath201 , @xmath202 this compares with eq .",
    "[ eq : plens ] for the single magnification bias , which can be written in a similar form @xmath203 for a power law luminosity function with no cutoffs , as is approximately the case when @xmath84 , these two probabilities are identical burst by burst .",
