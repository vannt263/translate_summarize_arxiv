    "the ferromagnetic resonance ( fmr ) spectrum of thin films is known to evolve with the angular configuration of the applied magnetic field with respect to the film surface . in this evolution",
    "the multi - peak fmr spectrum often becomes a single - peak one in a certain angular configuration , to regain its multi - peak character beyond it . a careful analysis of this effect , in which a multi - peak fmr spectrum collapses to a single - peak one , leads to the observation of two types of behavior of the collapsing spectrum .",
    "in one type the intensity of all the peaks except the first one diminishes progressively to vanish completely in the collapse configuration . beyond this configuration angle",
    "the satellite resonance lines emerge again in an unchanged order .",
    "the other type of collapse involves resonance positions rather than intensities : in the collapse configuration the lines shift to the position of the main peak , to reemerge in a reversed order beyond this configuration .",
    "the first type of collapse has been long known in the literature to be a surface effect due to the changes of the surface magnetic anisotropy ( responsible for the surface spin pinning ) with the configuration of the external field with respect to the surface of the thin film . in this pattern",
    "a complete collapse of the resonance spectrum occurs in a specific angular configuration ( referred to as critical angle of the surface anisotropy ) in which the surface anisotropy has no effect on the surface spin pinning , and the resonance precession of the all spins is homogeneous throughout the sample .",
    "in contrast , the other type of collapse is a bulk effect that occurs as a result of the ferromagnetic resonance in separate regions of slightly different magnetic character in a heterogeneous thin - film sample .",
    "a heterogeneous magnetic structure is known to result in heterogeneous conditions of ferromagnetic resonance in the sample .",
    "thus , in this interpretation each line in the multi - peak resonance spectrum corresponds to a resonance in a different region of the sample , and the collapse configuration of the external field is a particular configuration in which all the magnetically different regions participate in the resonance for resonance fields that differ only negligibly .",
    "the collapse of the fmr spectrum in this specific angular configuration of the external field in which the resonance heterogeneity of the sample is eliminated has not been thoroughly analyzed in the literature so far .",
    "the aim of this paper is to elucidate in detail the theoretical grounds of this effect .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we recall the derivation of the universal smit - beljers - suhl formula expressing the condition for ferromagnetic resonance to occur in a homogeneous bulk ferromagnetic sample . on the basis of this formula , in section",
    "iii we derive the configuration condition of resonance in thin films . in section",
    "iv we use this condition for analyzing the configuration evolution of the resonance field in thin - film samples with a perpendicular uniaxial anisotropy . we formulate a universal condition for a multi - peak fmr spectrum to collapse into a single - peak one in such samples , and ( in section v )",
    "demonstrate the bulk character of this effect .",
    "let us consider the dynamics of a body with an angular momentum @xmath1 and a magnetic moment @xmath2 collinear to it ( @xmath3 is the gyromagnetic ratio ) in a magnetic field @xmath4 .",
    "the field acts on the dipole to produce a torque @xmath5 that sets the body in motion according to the equation : @xmath6 let us represent the vectors in the above equation in the local basis of orthonormal spherical vectors @xmath7 determined by the vector @xmath8 ( obviously , @xmath9 , see fig.[fig : fig1 ] and comments in @xcite ) .",

    "the energy of a magnetic moment @xmath10 in a magnetic field @xmath4 is expressed by the equation : @xmath15 which , represented in the basis @xmath7 , becomes :    @xmath16    as a result of the rotation of @xmath10 by a small angle @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) the energy changes to : @xmath19 the vector @xmath20 can be expressed as @xmath21 , so the above equation will become : @xmath22 the following relations are seen to occur : @xmath23 @xmath24    now , we can get back to the equation of motion   and write the cross product as the determinant : @xmath25      =      \\gamma      \\left|       \\begin{matrix }        \\hat{\\bm{r}}&\\hat{\\bm{\\theta}}&\\hat{\\bm{\\phi}}\\\\        m&0&0\\\\        h_r&\\left.\\frac{-1}{m}{\\frac{\\partiale}{\\partial\\theta}}\\right|_{\\theta,\\phi}&\\left.\\frac{-1}{m\\sin\\theta}{\\frac{\\partiale}{\\partial\\phi}}\\right|_{\\theta,\\phi}\\\\       \\end{matrix }      \\right| .\\ ] ] hence we obtain the system of equations : @xmath26 this system of equations is to be solved in four steps .",
    "we ( i )  determine the equilibrium angles  @xmath27 and  @xmath28 as the solution of the system of equations @xmath29 ; ( ii )  expand @xmath30 and  @xmath31 into a taylor series at @xmath27 and  @xmath28 , respectively ; ( iii )  assume that the time dependence of the angles has the form  @xmath32 , and ( iv )  exclude all the terms except the lowest - order ones ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this procedure leads to the smit - beljers - suhl formula @xcite that represents the ferromagnetic resonance condition : @xmath33 where the values of the derivatives correspond to the equilibrium angles  @xmath27 and  @xmath28 .",
    "( note by the way that the radicand is the hessian of the function  @xmath30 at the equilibrium point ; its positive value is indicative of the existence of a minimum of the function at the point at which the first partial derivatives vanish . )",
    "since we shall henceforth consider samples with a magnetization  @xmath34 , the formulas derived above , with  @xmath34 in place of  @xmath10 , will apply to the description of the magnetization dynamics in the studied case .",
    "let us consider a sample in which the free energy density @xmath30 is the sum of the zeeman energy , the demagnetization energy and the uniaxial anisotropy energy : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is a unit vector normal to the surface of the sample , and @xmath37 is a unit vector oriented along the easy magnetization axis .",

    "we shall investigate the angular configuration dependence  @xmath41 implied by the assumed form of the free energy density  .",

    "in this section we shall only consider the simplest of the three cases mentioned above , i.e. a thin film with perpendicular uniaxial anisotropy ( case [ 001 ] ) ; we leave the remaining two cases to be similarly discussed in a separate paper .",
    "the condition allows to determine the equilibrium angle @xmath47 of the magnetization vector corresponding to a specific configuration of the external field @xmath67 .",
    "figure [ fig : ferromagnetic_resonance_a_angle ] shows the consequent configuration dependence @xmath68 for two values of @xmath69 . the deviation of the magnetization angle @xmath47 from the field angle @xmath67 is seen to be the largest in the middle of the interval @xmath70 $ ] , and to grow with increasing value of @xmath69 ; in this range the deviation is of ca .",
    "@xmath71 to @xmath72 , far from being negligible !",
    "now , let us assume that the thin film under consideration is heterogeneous and planarly stratified into regions with two different values of effective magnetization @xmath69 .",
    "the resonance condition  with the equilibrium condition used  leads to two respective configuration resonance curves @xmath41 , see fig.[fig : ferromagnetic_resonance_a_field+dhdm]a .",
    "this means that for a configuration @xmath67 each of the ferromagnetic strata resonates for a different value of the external field .",
    "this applies to the whole range of @xmath67 with the exception of one particular configuration corresponding to the point of intersection of the two curves . in this particular configuration both regions",
    " in spite of their significantly different magnetic parameters !",
    " produce a resonance simultaneously for the same magnitude of the external field .",
    "this implies homogeneous precession throughout the sample , as if its heterogeneity were completely eliminated in this configuration !",
    "thus , for this particular angle @xmath67 the sample can be regarded as _ dynamically homogeneous_. the dynamic homogeneity ( dh ) is evidenced by the collapse of the two - peak resonance spectrum to a single resonance line .",
    "note that past this particular angle the two peaks reemerge , but the resonance sequence is reversed .",
    "the occurrence of a _ dynamic homogeneity angle _ ( dha ) is an intrinsic characteristic of the smit - beljers - suhl ( sbs ) resonance formula .",
    "thus , we have grounds to ask whether the sbs equation can provide the basis for an analytical condition that would allow to predict the dha angle for a ferromagnetic thin - film sample .",
    "we think we have managed to formulate such a condition a posteriori on the basis of the numerical results shown in fig.[fig : ferromagnetic_resonance_a_field+dhdm]b , presenting the configuration dependence of the derivative @xmath73 determined for each of the ferromagnetic regions shown in fig.[fig : ferromagnetic_resonance_a_field+dhdm]a . the dha angle is seen to be in the range delimited by the extreme configurations for which the considered derivative vanishes in each stratum .",
    "the range shrinks with decreasing difference between the extreme values of @xmath69 in the two regions .",
    "thus , we can expect that the dha angle will be determined with a good approximation by the condition of vanishing of the derivative : @xmath74 in the region the magnetic properties of which predominate in the sample .",
    "it is worthy of notice that the above - discussed collapse of the fmr spectrum in a particular field configuration defined by the dha angle is a dynamic * volume * effect , since only bulk quantities figure in the adopted expression for free energy density , and the presence of the surface is only manifested in the shape anisotropy of the sample .",
    "thus , the energy of surface anisotropy was not taken into account in our considerations .",
    "this is an important statement , since also the surface anisotropy by itself can cause a multipeak swr spectrum to collapse to a single resonance line in a certain configuration , referred to as _ critical angle _",
    "@xcite , of the applied field with respect to the film surface .",
    "however , there is a substantial difference between the collapse of an fmr spectrum and that of an swr spectrum . in the former",
    "the resonance line positions merge to form a single line at the dha angle , while the collapse of an swr spectrum consists in the suppression of the intensity of all the lines except the main one at the critical angle .",
    "this is due to the different nature of the two effects : the essence of the fmr collapse is the attainment of homogeneous resonance dynamics throughout the _ volume _ of the sample , whereas the swr effect consists in the elimination , in the _ critical _ field configuration , of the impact of the surface anisotropy on the spin dynamics in the thin film .",
    "therefore , we shall refer to the latter configuration as _ surface critical angle _",
    "the sca is sensitive to the conditions on the surface of the sample and can vary with them , while the dha , only determined by the bulk characteristics that enter the condition , is a fixed parameter of the sample .",
    "it should be emphasized that the above - mentioned differences between the two effects can be used in practice as a criterion that allows to determine whether a collapse of a multipeak fmr spectrum observed in a thin film is of surface or bulk character .",
