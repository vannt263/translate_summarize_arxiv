    "critical properties of structurally disordered magnets remain a problem of great interest in condensed matter physics , as far as real magnetic crystals are usually non - ideal .",
    "commonly , in the theoretical studies , as well as in the mc simulations , one considers point - like uncorrelated quenched non - magnetic impurities @xcite .",
    "however , in real magnets one encounters non - idealities of structure , which can not be modeled by simple point - like uncorrelated defects .",
    "indeed , magnetic crystals often contain defects of a more complex structure : linear dislocations , planar grain boundaries , three - dimensional cavities or regions of different phases , embedded in the matrix of the original crystal , as well as various complexes ( clusters ) of point - like non - magnetic impurities @xcite .",
    "therefore , a challenge is to offer a consistent description of the critical phenomena influenced by the presence of such complicated defects .",
    "different models of structural disorder have arisen as an attempt to describe such defects . in this paper",
    "we concentrate on the so - called long - range - correlated disorder when the point - like defects are correlated and the resulting critical behaviour depends on the type of this correlation .",
    "several models have been proposed for description of such a dependence @xcite , a subject of extensive analytical and numerical @xcite treatment .",
    "a common outcome of the above studies is that although the concentration of non - magnetic impurities is taken to be far from the percolation threshold , in the region of weak dilution , the impurities make a crucial influence on an onset of ordered ferromagnetic phase .",
    "given that the pure ( undiluted ) magnet possesses a second - order phase transition at certain critical temperature @xmath0 , an influence of the weak dilution may range from the decrease of @xmath0 to the changes in the universality class and even to the smearing off this transition @xcite .",
    "moreover , the critical exponents governing power low scaling in the vicinity of @xmath0 may depend on the parameters of impurity - impurity correlation .    to give an example , the harris criterion , which holds for the energy - coupled uncorrelated disorder @xcite",
    "is modified when the disorder is long - range correlated @xcite . in particular , when the impurity - impurity pair correlation function @xmath1 decays at large distances @xmath2 according to a power law : @xmath3 the asymptotic critical exponents governing magnetic phase transition ( and hence the universality class of the transition ) do change if @xcite @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the correlation length critical exponent of the undiluted magnet .",
    "the above condition ( [ 2 ] ) holds for @xmath6 , @xmath7 being the space ( lattice ) dimension . for @xmath8 the usual harris criterion @xcite",
    "is recovered and condition ( [ 2 ] ) is substituted by @xmath9 .",
    "the fact , that the power of the correlation decay might be a relevant parameter at @xmath6 can be easily understood observing an asymptotics of the fourier transform @xmath10 of @xmath1 at small wave vector numbers @xmath11 . from ( [ 1 ] ) one arrives at @xmath12 , which for @xmath6 leads to a singular behaviour at @xmath13 .",
    "as far as the small @xmath11 region defines the criticality , the systems with @xmath6 are good candidates to manifest changes in the critical behaviour with respect to their undiluted counterparts . on contrary",
    ", impurity - impurity correlations at @xmath8 do not produce additional singularities with respect to the uncorrelated point - like impurities , therefore they are referred to as the short - range correlated . in turn , the disorder characterized by eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) with @xmath6 is called the long - range correlated .",
    "there are different ways to model systems with the long - range - correlated disorder governed by eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "the most direct interpretation relies on the observation that the integer @xmath14 in eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) corresponds to the large @xmath2 behaviour of the pair correlation function for the impurities in the form of points ( @xmath15 ) , lines ( @xmath16 ) , and planes ( @xmath17 ) @xcite .",
    "since the last two objects extend in space , the impurities with @xmath6 sometimes are called the extended ones .",
    "note that the isotropic form of the pair correlation function ( [ 1 ] ) demands random orientation of such spatially extended objects .",
    "non - integer @xmath14 sometimes are treated in terms of a fractal dimension of impurities , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "besides energy - coupled disorder , the power - low correlation decay ( [ 1 ] ) is relevant for the thermodynamic phase transition in random field systems @xcite , percolation @xcite , scaling of polymer macromolecules at presence of porous medium @xcite , zero - temperature quantum phase transitions @xcite .",
    "our paper was stimulated by the observations of obvious discrepancies in the state - of - the - art analysis of criticality in three - dimensional ising magnets with the long - range - correlated disorder governed by eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) . indeed , since for the pure @xmath18 ising model @xmath19 @xcite , the long - range correlated disorder should change its universality class according to eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) . whereas both theoretical and numerical studies agree on the validity of extended harris criterion ( [ 2 ] ) and bring about the new universality class @xcite , the numerical values of the critical exponents being evaluated differ essentially .",
    "we list the values of the exponents found so far by different approaches in table [ tab1 ] and refer the reader to the section [ ii ] for a more detailed discussion of this issue . here",
    ", we would like to point out that presently the results of each of existing analytical approaches ( refs . @xcite and @xcite )",
    "is confirmed by only one numerical simulation ( refs . @xcite and @xcite , respectively ) .",
    "to resolve such a bias , we perform mc simulations of a @xmath18 ising model with extended impurities and evaluate critical exponents governing ferromagnetic phase transition .",
    "as it will become evident from the further account , our estimates for the exponents differ from the results of two numerical simulations performed so far @xcite and are in favour of a non - trivial dependency of the critical exponents on the peculiarities of long - range correlations decay .",

    "the numerical values of the exponents are evaluated there by the finite - size scaling technique .",
    "section [ v ] concludes our study .",
    "currently , there exist two different analytical results for the values of critical exponents of the 3d ising model with long - range - correlated impurities .",
    "the first one is due to weinrib and halperin , who formulated the model of a @xmath26-vector magnet with quenched impurities correlated via the power law ( [ 1 ] ) @xcite .",
    "they used the renormalzation group technique carrying out a double expansion in @xmath27 , @xmath28 , considering @xmath29 and @xmath30 to be of the same order of magnitude , and estimating values of the critical exponents to the first order in this expansion .",
    "further , they conjectured the obtained first order result for the correlation length critical exponent @xmath31 to be an exact one and to hold for any value of spin component number @xmath26 provided that @xmath32 . by complementing eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) with the first order value of the pair correlation function critical exponent , @xmath33 @xcite , the other critical exponents can be obtained via familiar scaling relations . for @xmath34",
    "the exponents are listed in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "the second theoretical estimate was obtained by prudnikov _",
    "@xcite in the field theoretical renormalization group technique by performing renormalization for non - zero mass at fixed space dimension @xmath18 .",
    "their two - loop calculations refined by the resummation of the series obtained bring about a non - trivial dependence of the critical exponents both on @xmath26 and on @xmath14 .",
    "we list their values of the exponents for @xmath35 and @xmath34 in the second row of table [ tab1 ] .",
    "in particular , one observes that the correlation length exponent @xmath20 obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite differs from the value predicted by ( [ 3 ] ) by the order of 25 % . as for the reason of such discrepancy",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite point to a higher order of the perturbation theory they considered together with the methods of series summation as well as to taking into account the graphs which are discarded when the @xmath36-expansion is being used .",
    "let us note however , the qualitative agreement between the above analytical results : both renormalization group treatments , refs . @xcite and @xcite , predict that the new ( long - range - correlated ) fixed point is stable and reachable for the condition considered and hence the 3d ising model with long - range - correlated impurities belongs to a new universality class .",
    "these are only the numerical values of the exponents which call for additional verification . in such cases",
    "one often appeals to the numerical simulations .",
    "indeed , two simulations were performed , and , strangely enough , the results again split into two groups : whereas the simulation of ballesteros and parisi @xcite is strongly in favour of the theoretical results of weinrib and halperin , the simulation of prudnikov _ et al . _",
    "@xcite almost exactly reproduces former theoretical results of this group @xcite as one can see from table 1 .",
    "there , we give the results for the exponents obtained in simulations complementing them by those that follow if one uses familiar scaling relations ( the last are shown in italic ) .    since our own study",
    "will rely on the simulation technique as well , we describe an analysis performed in refs .",

    "@xcite for more discussion ) .",
    "we performed our numerical simulations using the swendsen - wang cluster algorithm .",
    "the main reason is , that with the diluted system one often performs simulations at the temperature which is far from the native phase transition point of each particular disorder realization . as the result",
    ", the single clusters can be of rather small size and the wolff one algorithm , used by us before @xcite is found to be less effective .",
    "the following set of lattice sizes @xmath88 ( @xmath89 in some cases ) is used and performing the finite - size - scaling analysis is performed .",
    "the magnetic site concentration is chosen to be @xmath45 which is far from the percolation threshold and this also allows comparison with the previous simulations @xcite .",
    "another reason for such a choice is that for the 3d ising model with uncorrelated impurities the correction to scaling terms were found to be minimal at @xmath45 @xcite , ( obviously , this does not mean that @xmath45 minimizes correction - to - scaling terms at any level of impurities correlation ) .",
    "the number of samples ranges from @xmath90 to @xmath48 for all lattice sizes .",
    "the simulations are performed at the finite - size critical temperature @xmath91 which is found from the maximum of magnetic susceptibility @xmath72 at each lattice size @xmath52 and the reweighting technique for the neighbouring temperatures is used .",
    "note , that in refs .",
    "@xcite all simulation were performed at the critical temperature of an infinite system .",
    "similarly to our other previous papers @xcite we start simulation from estimating the critical temperature of a finite - size system as a function of the lattice size @xmath52 , @xmath91 . for the smallest lattice size @xmath92 ,",
    "the preliminary simulation is performed at @xmath93 first ( @xmath94 is the critical temperature for the pure system ) .",
    "the @xmath95 is located then from the maximum of the susceptibility . at the same time",
    ", we estimate various autocorrelation times to control the error due to time correlations . for the next larger lattice size , e.g. @xmath96",

    "the process is repeated for all lattice sizes . in this way we estimate @xmath91 and the energy autocorrelation time @xmath98 .",
    "the results are given in table [ tab2 ] .",
    "one can see that the finite size system critical temperature obtained via _ averaging a _ differs from those obtained via and _ averaging b_. the difference is not too large , the next simulations were performed at the critical temperature obtained by _ averaging a_.    in evaluation of the critical indices we followed the standard finite - size - scaling scheme as described e. g. in ref .",
    "the estimates for the correlation length , magnetic susceptibility , and spontaneous magnetization critical exponents @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 can be obtained from the fss behaviour of the following quantities :    * _ averaging a _ : @xmath99    in eqs .",
    "( [ 111b ] ) , ( [ 111c ] ) , the correction - to - scaling terms have been omitted .",
    "taking them into account the fss behaviour of the quantity @xmath100 attains the form : @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the leading exponent , @xmath103 is the correction - to - scaling exponent , and @xmath104 is a correction - to - scaling amplitude .",
    "hereafter , we perform the finite - size - scaling analysis in several ways . first , assuming the correction - to - scaling terms to be small we will fit the data for the observables to the leading power laws ( [ 111b ] ) , ( [ 111c ] ) only .",
    "besides that , we will also perform the fits with correction - to - scaling terms ( [ 111d ] ) as explained below .",
    "in this section , applying the above described formalism , we give preliminary estimates of the critical exponents .",
    "as we will see , the estimates for the same exponent obtained on the base of fss of different quantities differ from each other .",
    "moreover , similar differences arise when the results obtained via _ averaging a _ and _ averaging b _ are compared .",
    "we will discuss possible reasons for such behaviour and will analyze them further in the forthcoming section .",
    "the starting point of the analysis performed in this section is connected with the fact that at the same concentration of impurities , different samples vary configurationally ( geometrically ) as well as in their thermodynamical characteristics . in systems with uncorrelated dilution",
    "these variations are also present ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) although , as we will see below , these are less pronounced than in the case of the long - range - correlated disorder .",
    "moreover , although the mean concentration of magnetic sites is well - defined for an ensemble samples ( and chosen to be @xmath45 ) , the concentration of magnetic sites in each sample vary from the mean one .",
    "such deviations are caused by possible intersections of impurity lines in different samples , besides not for all lattice sizes one can reach given concentration of impurities by an integer number of lines .",
    "therefore , to start an analysis one has to make a choice of a set of sample specifying allowed values of the concentration dispersion .",
    "we start an analysis by dealing with the set of samples that are characterized by dispersion of concentrations @xmath105 .",
