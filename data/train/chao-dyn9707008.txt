    "quantum analogues of classically chaotic systems have been an object of intensive investigations for almost twenty years .",
    "one has studied statistical properties of the spectra of quantized chaotic systems trying to prove that these systems can be described by suitable ensembles of random matrices ( see e.g. @xcite ) . in this paper",
    "we follow the opposite direction : studying a generic quantum system we find strong arguments which support the conclusion that the dynamical entropy of the corresponding classical system is positive and , actually , arbitrary large .",
    "more precisely , we analyze the set of all _ structureless _ ( without geometric or time reversal symmetries ) quantum systems @xcite . for these systems , described by the ensemble of unitary matrices ,",
    "we compute the mean dynamical entropy averaged over the haar measure .",
    "we show that it increases logarithmically with the dimension of the hilbert space where a system lives , and so tends to the infinity in the semiclassical limit .    the dynamical entropy we used depends on the choice of _ coherent states_. we prove our assertion for the families of @xmath2 coherent states with @xmath3 .",
    "this includes the well known spin @xmath4 coherent states , where the corresponding classical phase space is the two - dimensional sphere @xmath5 . in the present work we only outline the main ideas of the proof putting apart the details of our reasoning to a forthcoming publication .",
    "the attempts to give a quantum analogue of the classical kolmogorov ",
    "sinai ( ks ) entropy have a rich history @xcite .",
    "most of these definitions do not provide a good framework for investigating the _ quantum chaos_. some of them , as the connes - narnhofer - thirring entropy @xcite or the alicki - fannes @xcite entropy , vanish for finite quantum systems and can be rather applied in quantum statistical mechanics .",
    "others do not give the correct semiclassical limit .",
    "most of them are not easy to calculate neither analytically nor numerically , but for very simple cases . in a series of papers",
    "@xcite we proposed a new definition of dynamical quantum entropy based on the notion of coherent states , which we would like to recall now .",
    "our approach to quantum entropy is based on the assumption that the knowledge of the time evolution of a quantum state is obtained by performing a sequence of approximate quantum measurements .",
    "the possible results of the measurement forms the ( coarse - grained ) stochastic phase - space being the quantum counterpart of the classical one .",
    "the evolution of the system between two subsequent measurements is governed by a unitary matrix .",
    "let @xmath6 be an @xmath7-dimensional hilbert space ( which represents the _ kinematics _ of the quantum system ) , let @xmath8 be a unitary operator on @xmath6 ( which describes the _ dynamics _ _ _ ) , let @xmath9 be a compact _ phase space _ _ _ endowed with a probability measure @xmath10 ( we shall write @xmath11 for @xmath12 ) , and let @xmath13 be a _ family of coherent states _ ( which are related to an _ approximated quantum measurement _ ) , i.e. , @xmath14 and @xmath15 is continuous .",
    "moreover , we assume in this paper that @xmath16 .    let @xmath17 be a partition of @xmath18 .",
    "we define the _ coherent states ( cs ) entropy of _",
    "_  _ @xmath8 _ _ with respect to the partition _",
    "_ @xmath19 by the formula @xmath20 where the partial entropies @xmath21 are given by @xmath22 for @xmath23 ; the probabilities @xmath24 of entering the cells @xmath25 are @xmath26 for @xmath27 ; and the kernel @xmath28 is given by @xmath29 for @xmath30 .",
    "the kernel @xmath31 may be interpreted as the @xmath32-dependent _ husimi distribution _ of the transformed state @xmath33 . if @xmath8 equals to the identity operator @xmath34 , the quantity @xmath35",
    "is called the _ overlap _ of coherent states @xmath36 and @xmath37 .    note",
    "that both sequences in ( [ cse1 ] ) are decreasing and the quantity @xmath38 , which does not depend on @xmath8 , is just the _ entropy of the partition _ @xmath19 .",
    "we denote it by @xmath39 .",
    "there are two kinds of randomness in our model : the first is connected with the underlying unitary dynamics of the system ; the second comes from the approximate measurement process .",
    "accordingly , we divide cs - entropy with respect to a partition into two components : _ cs  measurement entropy _ and _ cs  dynamical entropy _ :    @xmath40    @xmath41    finally , we define the partition independent _ cs  dynamical entropy of _ _",
    "@xmath8 _ as @xmath42 the supremum being taken over all finite partitions .",
    "it is conjectured that in the semiclassical limit the cs - dynamical entropy tends to the ks - entropy , if the unitary dynamics comes from an appropriate quantization procedure ( some results in this direction were proved in ) .",
    "in @xcite we study the properties of cs - dynamical entropy and present the methods of its numerical computing based on the concept of iterated function systems ( ifs ) . in this work",
    "we evaluate the mean value of cs - dynamical entropy @xmath43 , taking the average over the unitary matrices @xmath44 of the circular unitary ensemble ( cue ) .",
    "we study cs - dynamical entropy for the family of @xmath2 coherent states , @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "let @xmath47 be the irreducible representation of the group @xmath2 in the group of unitary operators acting on hilbert space @xmath48 , where @xmath49 , @xmath50 .",
    "we can identify the phase space @xmath18 with the coset space @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the maximal stability subgroup of @xmath2 with respect to the reference state @xmath53 , i.e. , the subgroup of all elements of @xmath2 which leave @xmath54 invariant up to a phase factor .",
    "the coherent states are defined by @xmath55 @xmath56 for @xmath57 . the space @xmath18 which plays the role of the phase space of corresponding classical mechanics is isomorphic to the complex projective space @xmath58 .",
    "hence , each point of @xmath18 can be interpreted as a pure quantum state in a @xmath45 - dimensional complex hilbert space @xmath59 .",
    "one can show that the overlap of two coherent states related to pure quantum states @xmath60 and @xmath61 is given by @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the canonical scalar product in @xmath59 @xcite .",
    "the _ semiclassical limit _ is obtained when @xmath64 , and @xmath65 plays the role of the relative planck constant .",
    "the above construction may be treated as a particular case of the general construction of group - theoretic coherent states @xcite .    if @xmath66 , then @xmath67 is simply isomorphic to the two - dimensional sphere @xmath5 , and the coherent states are ordinary _ spin coherent states _ ( see @xcite and also @xcite ) . in this case",
    "@xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the spin quantum number , the operators @xmath70 are represented by the wigner rotation matrices , and for the state @xmath71 one usually takes the maximal eigenstate @xmath72 of the component @xmath73 of the angular momentum operator .",
    "computing the cs - dynamical entropy requires the time limit : @xmath74 .",
    "surprisingly , one can obtain bounds for this quantity analyzing the _ continuous entropy _ of @xmath8 , which depends only on the one - step evolution of the quantum system :    @xmath75    this quantity is related to the  classical - like  entropy introduced to quantum mechanics by wherl in @xcite .",
    "namely , @xmath76 is equal to the difference of the wherl entropy of the states @xmath33 averaged over all @xmath77 from @xmath18 and @xmath78 ( the latter term follows from the normalization in ( [ ker1 ] ) ) .",
    "a similar quantities have been also studied by schroeck @xcite ( under the name of stochastic quantum mechanical entropy ) and by mirbach and korsch @xcite .",
    "calculation of continuous entropy is particularly easy for @xmath79 and @xmath2 coherent states . in this case",
    "@xmath80 belonging to the phase space @xmath18 and so    @xmath81    we can now apply the formula for the overlap of two @xmath2 coherent states ( see above ) , which enables us to use the result from jones @xcite who calculated generalized mean entropy of pure quantum state in a @xmath45-dimensional complex hilbert space . proceeding in this way",
    "we get    @xmath82           \\text { , }   \\label{meas3}\\ ] ]    where @xmath83 and @xmath84 is the digamma function , satisfying @xmath85 for @xmath86 . if @xmath66 the above formula reduces to    @xmath87",
    "let @xmath19 be a partition of @xmath18 and let @xmath8 be a unitary operator on @xmath48 . using classical methods from the information theory ( see @xcite , sect .",
    "2.2 ) we can prove the following observation :    @xmath88 = h_u   \\label{bound1}\\ ] ]    for each natural @xmath89 , where the coherent states partial entropies @xmath90 are defined in ( [ cse2 ] ) . hence and from the definition of cs - entropy we get    @xmath91    and @xmath92 = h_u\\text { . }",
    "\\label{bound3}\\ ] ] in fact , the infimum in ( [ bound1 ] ) and ( [ bound3 ] ) is achieved if the maximal diameter of a member of the partition @xmath19 tends to zero .",
    "thus for a sufficiently fine partition the cs - entropy splits approximately into two parts : the one which depends only on the partition , and the other depending only on the dynamics . combining the above formulae with the analogous obtained for @xmath79",
    "we conclude that @xmath93    the famous lieb conjecture says that for @xmath66 the wherl entropy attains its minimum equal to @xmath94 ( compare [ meas4 ] ) for any coherent state ( see @xcite , and @xcite for partial results ) .",
    "we conjecture that this is also true for @xmath95 and the minimum of the wehrl entropy for @xmath2 is equal to @xmath96 given by ( [ meas3 ] ) plus @xmath78 .",
    "this would imply @xmath97 , and consequently @xmath98 @xmath99 for every unitary matrix @xmath8 .    as we can see above the quantity @xmath96 decreases approximately as @xmath100 and so ,",
    "if the generalized lieb conjecture is true , then the entropy @xmath101 is limited from below by @xmath102 .",
    "this agrees with the bound obtained by halliwell for the information of phase space distributions derived from the probabilities for quantum histories @xcite .",
    "note , however , that the bound ( [ bound2 ] ) seems to be more precise , because , as we will show , @xmath103 is typically much smaller then @xmath104 .    averaging ( [ bound4 ] ) over the set of all unitary matrices @xmath44 with respect to the haar measure",
    "@xmath105 we get @xmath106 thus , to obtain the desired bounds for the mean cs - dynamical entropy , it suffices to calculate @xmath107 .",
    "we have    @xmath108    since latexmath:[$k_u(x , y)=|\\langle y|u|x\\rangle |^2/n=|\\langle \\kappa             integration and using the invariance of the haar measure on @xmath44 we conclude that    @xmath110 given by ku et al .",
    "otherwise , we can use the already mentioned result of jones @xcite .",
    "applying one of these methods we get the following formula :    @xmath111    finally from ( [ meas3 ] ) , ( [ bound5 ] ) and ( [ final3 ] ) we obtain the main result of this work : a lower and an upper bound for the mean dynamical entropy    @xmath112    where    @xmath113 ,            \\nonumber \\\\",
    "u_b & = & \\ln n           -m\\left [ \\psi \\left ( m+d\\right ) -\\psi \\left ( m+1\\right ) \\right ] ,             \\label{boub2 }          \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with @xmath114 .    in the semiclassical limit @xmath64",
    "we get simple approximations for both bounds    @xmath115    where @xmath116 is the euler constant .",
    "the difference between an upper bound ( which is actually the maximal value of the cs - dynamical entropy ! ) and a lower one converges to the constant @xmath117 if @xmath64 .",
    "hence the mean value of cs - dynamical entropy tends in the semiclassical limit to the infinity exactly as @xmath78 .",
    "let us consider the case @xmath66 , where the family of spin coherent states is parametrized by the points lying on the two - dimensional sphere @xmath5 .",
    "the mean entropy of quantum maps on the sphere is thus bounded by    @xmath118    ( 9,8 ) ( 0.7,10.8 )    the dependence of both bounds on the quantum number @xmath119 is presented in fig .  1 .",
    "in the semiclassical limit @xmath120 the mean dynamical entropy diverges in contrast to the cs - dynamical entropy of a given quantum map , which converges to the ks - entropy of the corresponding classical system .",
    "therefore , for sufficiently large @xmath7 a matrix @xmath121 representing a given quantum map must differ from a generic ( with respect to the haar measure on @xmath122 ) unitary matrix . to visualize the difference we present in fig .",
    "2 the husimi function of an exemplary coherent state @xmath123 transformed once by a floquet operator @xmath121 representing the kicked top @xcite in the classically chaotic regime ( a ) , and by a random unitary matrix @xmath8 ( b ) .",
    "the sphere is represented in the mercator projection with @xmath124 and @xmath125 , @xmath126 . in the former case",
    "the wave packet remains localized in the vicinity of the classical trajectory , while in the latter , it is entirely delocalized already after one iteration .",
    "the same data plotted in the log scale allow one to detect zeros of the husimi functions @xcite . for the quantum map f they form a regular spiral - like structure ( c ) in contrast to the random distribution over the entire phase space for the unitary map @xmath8 ( d ) .",
    "( 9.5 , 9.5 ) ( 0.0,-4.2 )",
    "the estimate ( [ boub1 ] ) allows us to conclude that a quantum system represented by a typical unitary matrix from cue ensemble is characterized by positive dynamical entropy , which is only insignificantly smaller than the maximal diverging with @xmath127 . in other words ,",
    "a generic quantum system is almost as chaotic , as possible .",
    "we prove this for @xmath2 coherent states , but the method seems to work also in the general case , i.e. , for coherent states defined on arbitrary homogenous compact manifold , as well as for the orthogonal and symplectic ensembles .    at a first glance",
    "this result seems to be paradoxical as the ks - entropy of a classical map is finite and the cs - dynamical entropy of the corresponding quantum system tends to this value in the semiclassical limit .",
    "hence for a hilbert space of sufficiently large dimension matrices representing a quantum analogue of a given classical chaotic system can not be typical .",
    "their entropy is substantially smaller than the cue average , even though many other statistics ( level spacing distribution , spectral rigidity , etc . )",
    "conform to the predictions of random matrix theory .",
    "however , this need not contradict the general believe that quantum analogues of classically chaotic systems might be represented by a typical unitary matrix . the paradox can be resolved if we assume that strongly chaotic systems dominate less chaotic ones in the space of classical systems defined on the corresponding symplectic manifold .",
