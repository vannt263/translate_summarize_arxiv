    "a profound connection between geometry and thermodynamics was first hinted in 1970s by  the works of bekenstein [ 1 ] and hawking [ 2 ] with the black hole thermodynamics .",
    "later , the discovery of black hole radiation by hawking established the physical link between the area of the horizon with entropy and the surface gravity of the black hole with temperature . however , despite the success of black hole thermodynamics , the relation between general theory of relativity and thermodynamics remains to be established for more general metrics .    in 1995 , assuming * extensivity * of entropy , jacobson [ 3 ] obtained einstein s field equations from the proportionality of entropy and the area of the horizon , and the relation@xmath1 where @xmath2 is heat , @xmath3 is entropy , and @xmath4 is the temperature .",
    "jacobson s treatment hinges on the fact that causal horizons hide information , hence should be associated with entropy , where heat is defined as the energy that flows through the causal horizon that continues to interact with the outside gravitationally .",
    "recently , assuming that the holographic principle holds , and building on the works of jacobson [ 3 ] and padmanabhan [ 4 ] , verlinde [ 5 ] proposed a framework for gravity as an entropic force via the assumption that holographic principal holds . on the nonextensive thermodynamics side , recently tsallis and cirto [ 6 ] argued that gravitating systems should be associated with an appropriate * nonextensive * generalization of the additive expression @xmath5    the fact that horizons hide information motivates their association with entropy , but due to the universality of gravity and the principle of equivalence , we can also expect a more general relation between gravity and entropy , independent of the existence of a horizon .",
    "this follows from the fact that all one can say about the source of a gravitational field is its total energy - momentum distribution .",
    "since there are many different ways to generate the same energy - momentum distribution , the gravitational field itself embodies a certain amount of information .",
    "even though classically the number of possible sources that could produce a given gravitational field is infinity , we expect quantum mechanics to give a finite number .    on the thermodynamic side of this captivating connection between gravitation and thermodynamics , we revisit the suggestive model introduced in 1986 as the friedmann thermodynamics [ 7 - 10 ] and give new derivations of its key components like the _ gravitational  temperature _ and the _ global equation of state_. by comparing the equal time expansion of the green function of the massless conformal scalar field in background frw geometry with the thermal green function in minkowski space - time , we give a new derivation of _ _ the _ _ gravitational temperature . using this temperature within the context of friedmann thermodynamics , which we also reestablish , we argue that the geometry of the visible universe is lobachevskian . in this regard",
    ", the lack of any measurable curvature in current observations means that the universe  must be much larger than what is visible to us .",
    "we also discuss limitations and the logical consistency of this model , along with its connections with nonextensive thermodynamics .",

    "the spatial universe is described by the constant time slices of the line element . for @xmath8",
    "the universe is flat and the geometry is euclidean , for @xmath9 the geometry is gaussian and the universe is the three dimensional surface of a four dimensional hypersphere with time dependent radius @xmath10 , for @xmath11 the geometry is lobachevskian , where the universe can be considered as the surface of a hypersphere with imaginary radius @xmath12 .",
    "the frw models are in general time dependent , where * * @xmath13 is the scale factor .",
    "we will take the initial conditions so that @xmath14 is the present radius of the universe .",
    "one of the trademarks of a given geometry is the sum of the interior angles of triangles , which for the euclidean geometry is always equal to @xmath15 and greater than @xmath15 for the gaussian , and less than @xmath15 and for the lobachevskian geometries .    even though geometry is a directly observable feature of the universe through angle , distance , area , etc .",
    "measurements , cosmic scales make this rather impractical . on the other hand , einstein s field equations : @xmath16 which relate the space - time geometry to the matter content of the universe , offer a much more practical alternative . the left hand side of the einstein s field equations ,",
    "@xmath17 is called the einstein tensor , which is a purely geometric quantity entirely composed of the metric tensor and its first two derivatives . the right hand side , @xmath18 is the energy - momentum tensor , which describes the matter content of the universe . in this work ,",
    "we treat the cosmological constant as a part of the energy - momentum tensor , hence do not write it explicitly .    for perfect fluids",

    "the dynamic mass measurements indicate that the amount of luminous matter plus the dark matter in the universe only adds up to around @xmath38 @xmath39 of the critical density , which from equation ( [ 9 ] ) indicates that we live in a lobachevskian universe .",
    "just when all such data pointed to a lobachevskian universe , the wmap satellite measurements of the anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background radiation surprised cosmologists by yielding a @xmath40value very close to zero .",
    "this also meant that the current density of the universe is very close to the critical density , thus indicating that almost @xmath41 of the matter content of the universe is yet to be accounted for .",
    "another surprise came with the discovery of the acceleration of the universe , which allowed us to interpret this missing @xmath41 in terms of some exotic form of matter called the _",
    "dark energy_. even though the physics of dark energy is still unknown , we can say that it has positive mass and responds to gravity with repulsion .",
    "this naturally demands a radical change in our understanding of the contents of the universe . considering that a flat universe demands a precisely tuned current density to the critical density , which is a tall order for any observation , it is only fair to say that the geometry of the universe will still continue to captivate cosmologists for years to come .",
    "in fact , the recent data from the wmap indicate that the total density differs from the critical density by as much as 1% or so [ 11 ] .",
    "since frw models with different @xmath30 values correspond to different spatial distributions of galaxies , we address this problem by investigating the connection between geometry and thermodynamics . in thermodynamics , a particular crystal structure ,",
    "that is , a particular spatial distribution of atoms , becomes the stable form of matter with respect to the entropy criteria . in this regard",
    ", we think that it may be possible to predict the geometry of the universe via some _ thermodynamic _ arguments .",
    "a profound connection between geometry and thermodynamics was first hinted by the black hole thermodynamics [ 1,2,12 ] .",
    "we now further the suggestive ( toy ) model we introduced in 1986 as the _ friedmann thermodynamics _ and clarify some of its critical concepts [ 7 - 10 ] * , * which has some definite predictions about the geometry of the universe . in section iii , we introduce the concept of _ global equation of state _ , which plays a central role in this model . in section iv",
    ", we give a derivation of the _ gravitational temperature _ for the frw geometries . in section v , we introduce the _ local _ equation of state concept and discuss the assumptions involved . in section vi , for a given local equation of state , we discuss how to find the global equation of state and then how to determine the geometry of the universe . in section vii , using a local equation of state that covers a wide range of physically acceptable cases , we argue that with respect to the friedmann thermodynamics , the geometry of the universe is lobachevskian .",
    "finally , in section viii , we discuss our results .",
    "einstein once said that the left hand side of the field equations is as solid as the rock of gibraltar but the right hand side is like a house built from a deck of cards [ eq .",
    "( [ 4 ] ) ] .",
    "the left hand side of the einstein s field equations , @xmath42 , is a unique divergenceless tensor , entirely composed of the metric tensor and its first two derivatives . on the other hand , the right hand side is the energy - momentum tensor , @xmath43 , which represents the matter content of the universe .",
    "the problem is due to the fact that matter not only affects geometry but also gets affected by it , hence @xmath43 is also a function of the unknown , that is , the metric tensor . unlike the special theory of relativity , where one can obtain the energy - momentum tensor in a moving frame from the rest frame expression by a lorentz transformation , it is not possible to generate the curved space - time energy - momentum tensor , @xmath44 from its flat ( minkowski ) space - time expression by a general coordinate transformation . in flat space - time * * , * * that is , in a free fall frame , the perfect fluid energy - momentum tensor is written as @xmath45 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the pressure and the density distributions , respectively . in principle , there are infinitely many expressions that one could write for the curved space - time energy momentum tensor .",
    "of course , all of them reducing to equation ( [ 10 ] ) in the limit @xmath46 for the energy - momentum tensor in curved space - time , the common practice is to replace the minkowski metric in @xmath47 with the general curved space - time metric , @xmath48 and express @xmath23 and @xmath24 in curved space - time coordinates to write @xmath49 since @xmath23 and @xmath24 are defined _ locally _ , their values at a given point in curved space - time coordinates do not change , thus the equation of state in curved space - time is still taken as the flat space - time equation of state , that is , as @xmath50    friedmann thermodynamics is based on the observation that different crystal structures of matter correspond to different spatial distributions of atoms over lattices * * with discrete symmetry properties . at a given temperature ,",
    "what defines the stable phase is the crystal structure that has the lowest gibbs energy .",
    "analogously , the frw models correspond to different spatial distributions of galaxies , where the space over which the galaxies are distributed is  curved over a hyperspace with continuous but nevertheless with distinct symmetry properties called the bianchi symmetries .",
    "phase transitions are due to collective behavior of matter , hence they are governed by the entropy criteria rather than the energy . for example , tin has two allotropic forms at normal pressure as white and gray tin , where white tin exists in stable form at 298 k , a form that should be unstable according to the energy criteria [ 13 ] .",
    "similarly , we can expect to determine the geometry of the universe via thermodynamic arguments , but the conventional energy - momentum tensor [ eq .",
    "( [ 11 ] ) ] with a given flat space - time equation of state , @xmath26 yields isentropic ( or isothermal ) models that all have the same gibbs energy . in other words , with the conventional approach , all frw models have the same gibbs energy , @xmath51 , which leaves @xmath30 as a parameter that can only be determined by observation .    in 1902",
    "gibbs [ 14 ] pointed out that systems with long range interactions like gravity , are in principle beyond the scope of standard ( boltzmann - gibbs ) statistical mechanics . in line with gibbs",
    ", we now argue that thermodynamic systems that are large enough for the effects of curvature to be important , are endowed with a _ gravitational temperature _ and a _ gravitational entropy , _ and define the curved space - time energy - momentum tensor as@xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the _ global pressure _ and _ density _ distributions , respectively , and @xmath4 is the _ gravitational temperature_. in this approach , the vacuum field equations remain intact , but the right hand side of the field equations is modified profoundly so that the effect of curvature on the energy - momentum tensor is included not only explicitly through the replacement @xmath55 but also implicitly through the global equation of state @xmath56 .",
    "as we will show , compared to other modifications of the einstein s field equations , this is a rather intricate change that allows us to predict the geometry of the universe .",
