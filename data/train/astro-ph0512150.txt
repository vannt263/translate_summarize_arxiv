    "the process of tidal capture , whereby a body in initially unbound orbit has a close approach to another gravitating mass , and through the excitation of internal modes of oscillation , becomes subsequently bound is of general importance in astrophysics .",
    "it is believed to play a role in binary formation in globular clusters ( eg . press & teukolsky 1977 , hereafter pt , and references therein ) and to play a role in the tidal interactions of stars in galactic centres .",
    "a related problem is the circularisation of an orbit from large eccentricity which may occur after a tidal capture . in this situation ,",
    "each periastron passage is very similar to a close encounter in a weakly unbound orbit that causes a change in the energy contained within internal modes of oscillation at the expense of that in the orbit .    in order to estimate capture probabilities and circularisation time",
    "scales the excitation of normal modes of oscillation by a perturbing potential must be considered . in general modes associated with",
    "spherical stars , or small perturbations of them , have been considered ( eg .",
    "pt , ip and references therein ) . however , if the tidally perturbed body has multiple encounters , angular momentum transfer should lead it to rotate at an angular velocity related to that at periastron . in this case modes of oscillation with periods comparable to the rotation period",
    "need to be considered ( eg .",
    "papaloizou & pringle 1978 ) .",
    "an approach for dealing with the problem of calculating tidal phenomena while taking into account the part of the oscillation spectrum with eigen frequencies comparable to the rotation frequency was recently proposed by pi .",
    "they adopted a self - adjoint formalism for calculating the tidal response that used the density perturbation to describe the motions within the star and they made a low frequency approximation that the rotation and mode frequencies were very much less than the inverse sound crossing time .",
    "they also evaluated the inertial mode spectrum for a polytrope with index @xmath14 and showed that inertial modes dominated the response at low frequencies or large periastron distances .",
    "given the importance of rotation , the purpose of this paper is to develop further the work begun in pi and to use the results to obtain time scales for tidal phenomena such as circularisation of the orbit starting from high eccentricity .",
    "we begin by noting that the self - adjoint formalism can be extended to general linear displacements without making a low frequency approximation . in this form , which uses the lagrangian displacement to describe the perturbations it has wider applicability than the formalism presented in pi which made a low frequency approximation .",
    "we also wish to evaluate the expressions obtained for the energy and angular momentum exchanged during close periastron passages for realistic planet models .",
    "accordingly we calculate sequences of models of one jupiter mass @xmath15 and @xmath16 each sequence has a range of radii in order to take account of the fact that the planet radius varies with age . for simplicity",
    "we do not include a solid core noting that according to saumon & guillot ( 2004 ) observations of jupiter are not inconsistent with this .",
    "we calculate the oscillation spectra together with required overlap integrals for the models using a set of basis or trial functions .",
    "we then use the determined eigenmode properties for these models to estimate tidal phenomena such as the attainment of pseudo synchronism for which the angular momentum transfer at periastron passage is zero . such a state is expected to be attained , on account of the small inertia of the planet compared to that of the orbit , with subsequent energy exchanges occurring with the planet rotating at an equilibrium angular velocity .",
    "the inclusion of inertial modes is important for determining this angular velocity which turns out to be close to that of the orbit at periastron .",
    "calculations in ip incorporating only the @xmath3 modes gave a much higher value .",
    "having calculated the equilibrium angular velocity we are able to consider multiple encounters and determine conditions for the onset of stochastic instability , that results in the stochastic gain of inertial mode energy over many periastron passages when there is no dissipation ( kochanek 1992 , mardling 1994a , b ) .",
    "then we make estimates of circularisation time scales for the two different planet masses taking into account the evolutionary variation of the planet radius with age .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we formulate the new self - adjoint formalism for the problem of linear perturbations proposed in our recent paper(pi ) using the lagrangian displacement to describe the motions and then use it to derive general expressions for the energy and angular momentum transfered when a rotating planet or a star passes through periastron in a parabolic or highly eccentric orbit around a central mass without making a low frequency approximation as in pi .",
    "it can thus be applied to general situations in which @xmath17 @xmath18 @xmath19 and inertial modes are significant . in section 3",
    "we show that the general formalism can be reduced to that of pi in an appropriate low frequency limit . in this case",
    "only the inertial modes contribute to the tidal response for the baratropic stellar models we consider . in section 4",
    "we discuss the tidal energy and angular momentum transfered through inertial modes giving very simple expressions that apply when the planet or star rotates in a state of pseudo synchronisation for which the angular momentum transfered in an encounter is essentially zero .",
    "we apply these to the multi - passage problem when there is no dissipation finding conditions for the occurrence of the stochastic instability .",
    "we find that this requires the circularisation process to start with a rather large semi - major axis @xmath4 for final periods of @xmath5 days .",
    "however , this could be reduced to @xmath6 for the shortest observed final periods @xmath7 days .    in section 5",
    "we calculate the eigenspectrum of the inertial modes for the planet models which have been obtained using a realistic equation of state .",
    "we find that the counterparts of the two global modes found in a polytrope with @xmath20 exist in these cases but that there are additional global modes associated with the transition from molecular to metallic hydrogen .",
    "we go on to apply the results to the problem of tidal circularisation of the orbits of the extrasolar planets in sections 6 and 7 finding that inertial modes dominate the tidal interaction for @xmath15 planets ending up on circular orbits with final period in the @xmath10 day range and are potentially able to account for the initial circularisation at a @xmath11 day period within a few @xmath12 in that case",
    ". however , in the case of @xmath13 oscillation modes excited in the star become more important . finally in section 8",
    "we discuss our results .",
    "in this section we further develop the self adjoint formalism describing the pulsations of a uniformly rotating fully convective object ( a planet or a star ) , referred to hereafter as a planet , introduced in our previous paper ( papaloizou @xmath21 ivanov 2005 , pi ) .",
    "we give general expressions for the energy and angular momentum transfer from the orbit to the planet as a result of a close encounter or fly by around a gravitating centre . here , contrary to pi , we do not make the assumption that only low frequency modes respond effectively to the tidal forcing and the results obtained are valid for the excitation of any pulsational mode of a rotating planet .",
    "the fundamental quantity used in our analysis is the lagrangian displacement vector @xmath22 . by definition ,",
    "this is real .",
    "we adopt a cylindrical coordinate system @xmath23 with origin at the centre of mass of the planet .",
    "we make use of the fourier transforms of the displacement vector and any other perturbation quantity , say q , over the azimuthal angle @xmath24 and time @xmath25 in the form @xmath26 where the sum is over @xmath27 and @xmath28 and @xmath29 denotes the complex conjugate .",
    "the reality of @xmath30 implies that the fourier transform , indicated by tilde satisfies @xmath31    the inner products of two complex scalars @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and vectors @xmath34 and @xmath35 are defined as @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the scalar product , @xmath38 is the density , and @xmath39 stands for the complex conjugate .",
    "we assume that , viewed from an inertial frame , the planet is rotating with uniform angular velocity @xmath40 directed perpendicular to the orbital plane .",
    "in this situation the hydrodynamic equations for the perturbed quantities take the simplest form in the rotating frame which we accordingly adopt .",
    "since the planet is fully convective , the entropy per unit of mass of the planetary gas remains approximately the same over the volume of the planet , and the pressure @xmath41 can be considered as a function of density @xmath38 only , @xmath42 . a perturbation of the planet may be considered as adiabatic , and therefore the same functional dependence @xmath42 holds during perturbation as well .",
    "this condition is often referred to as the baratropic condition . in the baratropic approximation",
    "the linearised navier - stokes equations take the form ( see pi ) @xmath43 where @xmath44 @xmath45 is the density perturbation , @xmath46 is the adiabatic sound speed , @xmath47 is the stellar gravitational potential arising from the perturbations and @xmath48 is the external forcing tidal potential .",
    "the viscous force per unit of mass is @xmath49 in cartesian coordinates it can be written in component form as @xmath50 where the comma denotes differentiation and @xmath51 is the kinematic viscosity .",
    "the greek indices enumerate spatial coordinate directions and the usual summation convention over these is adopted .",
    "note that the centrifugal term is absent in equation @xmath52 being formally incorporated into the potential governing the static equilibrium of the unperturbed star .",
    "the convective derivative @xmath53 as there is no unperturbed motion in the rotating frame .",
    "the linearised continuity equation is @xmath54 and the linearised poisson equation is @xmath55    provided that expressions for the density , sound speed and kinematic viscosity are specified in some unperturbed model of the planet , the set of equations @xmath56 is complete . without the viscous term on the right hand side of equation @xmath52",
    "these equations coincide with the analogous equations used by pi .",
    "the perturbed potential @xmath47 can be formally expressed in terms of the density perturbation with help of the inverse of the laplace operator , @xmath57 , and the density perturbation is expressed in terms of the displacement vector with help of the continuity equation .",
    "we have @xmath58    now we express @xmath59 in terms of @xmath60 with help of equations @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "we substitute the result into equation @xmath52 thus obtaining an equation containing only the displacement vector @xmath60 as a dynamical variable . after making fourier transform of this equation",
    "we get @xmath64 where the operators @xmath65 and @xmath66 are defined through their action on the vector @xmath60 as @xmath67 and @xmath68 it can be easily checked that the so defined operators @xmath65 and @xmath66 are self adjoint in the sense of the normal product @xmath69 .",
    "also for the models we consider with weak self - gravity , the operator @xmath66 may be taken to be positive definite for displacements with a non zero density perturbation somewhere and non negative for arbitrary displacements including those with zero density perturbation everywhere .",
    "the source term @xmath70 is determined by the external forcing potential @xmath71      the presence of the viscous force @xmath72 leads to dissipation of energy of the perturbed motion on a dissipation time scale . for global disturbances in astrophysical systems",
    "this time scale is typically very large compared to a time scale characterising the tidal forcing . in this situation",
    "we can treat the action of the viscous force as a perturbation .    neglecting the contribution of the viscous term",
    ", we see equation @xmath73 has an analogous form to one discussed by pi for low frequency perturbations .",
    "there it was shown that this form led to a standard type of eigen value problem associated with a new self adjoint operator @xmath74 . in order to bring equation @xmath73 to this standard type ,",
    "let us formally consider the square root of the operator @xmath66 , @xmath75 , defined by the condition : @xmath76 this can be done on account of the non negativity of @xmath77 .",
    "further , let us introduce a six dimensional vector @xmath78 with components @xmath79 it follows from equation @xmath73 that the eigenvalue problem can be written in the standard form @xmath80 where the operator @xmath74 has a matrix structure @xmath81 and the source six dimensional vector @xmath82 has the components @xmath83 it follows from equation @xmath84 that the operator @xmath74 has the required self adjoint form .",
    "now we can look for solution to equation @xmath85 in the form : @xmath86 where @xmath87 are the eigenfunctions of @xmath74 which satisfy @xmath88 the eigen frequencies @xmath89 are necessarily real .",
    "equation @xmath90 is equivalent to equation @xmath73 with the source term @xmath91 .",
    "note that the eigen spectrum of @xmath74 or a part of it can be continuous .",
    "it this case the summation in @xmath90 must be replaced by integration with an appropriate measure .",
    "the eigen functions @xmath92 are orthogonal in the sense of the inner product @xmath93 where @xmath94    substituting @xmath95 into equation @xmath85 and using @xmath96 we obtain @xmath97 where we add a small imaginary part to the frequency @xmath98 with @xmath99 in potentially resonant denominators to account for dissipation . as we show below , for modes for which the effect of viscosity can be treated as a small perturbation , an explicit expression for @xmath100 can be obtained by taking into account the dissipation determined by the viscous force @xmath72 .",
    "@xmath101 is the norm .",
    "the coefficients @xmath102 determine decomposition of the source vector over the eigen functions , @xmath103 where summation is performed over all modes with a particular value of @xmath104 .",
    "they can be written in the form @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the density perturbation associated with the eigenvector @xmath107 : @xmath108 , and to obtain the last equality , we integrate by parts .",
    "it is important to note that the coefficients @xmath102 , the eigen frequencies @xmath109 and the associated displacement vector @xmath110 obey a certain identity relation @xmath111 which follows from equations @xmath112 , @xmath113 and the orthogonality relation @xmath96 for the eigen vectors .",
    "this relation is also required to ensure that @xmath114 remains bounded as @xmath115 ( see below ) .",
    "the solution for the displacement vector @xmath116 follows from equations @xmath112 , @xmath95 and @xmath117 @xmath118 where we use the relation @xmath119 to obtain the last equality .",
    "the displacement vector @xmath60 is obtained from its fourier s transform @xmath116 by integration over @xmath120 and summation over @xmath104 @xmath121 this expression can be simplified in the limit @xmath122 at which only the poles in the expression in the braces contribute significantly to the integral over @xmath120 . in this limit",
    "we may , therefore , write @xmath123      it can be easily shown from equation @xmath52 or equation @xmath73 that the expression for the canonical energy of the perturbations is given by @xmath124 where we integrate over the volume of the planet .",
    "we evaluate the expression @xmath125 after a close encounter , @xmath126 .",
    "assuming that the time after closest approach is much larger than the characteristic time scale of the encounter , but nevertheless much smaller than the characteristic viscous time scale @xmath127 , we can use equation @xmath128 setting @xmath129 substituting the expression for @xmath60 and its time derivative into @xmath125 and taking into account equation @xmath130 we get @xmath131 where we use the orthogonality relation @xmath96 and the expression for the norm @xmath96 .",
    "the rate of viscous dissipation of energy is given by the standard expression @xmath132    an explicit expression for the amount of energy dissipated by viscosity after the fly by , @xmath133 , can be obtained from @xmath134 substituting @xmath135 into @xmath134 and integrating over time the resulting expression .",
    "we have @xmath136 where we use the well known relation @xmath137 , and @xmath138 as we have mentioned above , we assume that viscosity is very small , and the imaginary part of the frequency is much smaller than the corresponding real part . in this case , one can see from equation @xmath139 that the leading contribution to @xmath140 is determined by diagonal terms in the summation series with @xmath141 . also , only a part of the integral over @xmath120 very close to the resonance , @xmath142 , gives a significant contribution .",
    "we obtain @xmath143 the amount of energy transfered by tides into the modes must be equal to the amount of energy dissipated by viscosity : @xmath144 . from this condition and equation @xmath145 and @xmath146 we easily obtain an explicit expression for the inverse dissipation time @xmath147    similar arguments can be used for calculations of the amount of the angular momentum transferred to the modes after the fly by .",
    "however , the expression for the angular momentum transfer directly follows from the general relation between canonical energy and angular momentum corresponding to a particular mode with given values of @xmath148 and @xmath104 ( eg .",
    "friedman and schutz 1977 ) @xmath149 accordingly , we have from equation @xmath145 @xmath150    the expression for the energy of the modes in the inertial frame , @xmath151 , follows directly from equations @xmath145 and @xmath152 @xmath153 note that the modal energy in the inertial frame can be negative .",
    "the formalism developed in the previous section can be applied for any pulsational mode of a rotating planet .",
    "it follows from equations @xmath154 , @xmath145 and @xmath152 that in order to find the transfer of energy and angular momentum from the orbit to the modes we should be able to find solutions ( eigen functions and eigen frequencies ) of equation @xmath84 describing free oscillations of the planet .",
    "this can be done numerically . however , in general , it is rather difficult to use numerical methods directly in solving equation @xmath84 without any further simplifications .",
    "it turns out that these simplifications can be naturally introduced into the problem on hand . assuming that the periastron distance @xmath155 is sufficiently large",
    ", there is a small parameter in the problem , namely the ratio of the typical frequency associated with the periastron passage , @xmath156 to the typical frequency associated with the planet , @xmath157 : @xmath158 . and @xmath159 are the radius and the mass of the planet , respectively , and @xmath160 is the mass of the object exerting tides on the planet . ] we would expect that the angular momentum transfer between the orbit and the modes leads to a so called state of pseudo synchronisation where @xmath161 , and therefore the angular velocity of the planet can be , typically , much smaller than the characteristic frequency @xmath162 . in such a situation",
    "all modes of pulsation present in a convective planet can be divided in two distinct groups : high frequency modes with eigen frequencies of the order of or larger than @xmath162 , and low frequency modes with eigen frequencies of the order of @xmath163 . for the high frequency modes",
    ", the effects of rotation on the structure of eigen functions and eigen frequencies can be taken into account as a perturbation ( see eg .",
    "ip ) and references therein ) .",
    "calculation of the eigen spectrum of the low frequency modes is much more difficult ( papaloizou @xmath21 pringle 1981 , hereafter pp ) .",
    "however , a convenient approximation can also be made in this case which allows one to reduce the general equation @xmath84 to a much simpler equation for the low frequency modes only ( pp , pi ) .      in order to reduce equation @xmath84 to an expression appropriate for low frequency modes it is convenient to use the potential @xmath164 ( see equation @xmath61 for definition ) as a dynamical variable instead of the displacement vector @xmath116 .",
    "we express the components of @xmath116 in terms of @xmath164 using the fourier transformed variant of equation @xmath52 having set @xmath165 there . for a normal mode labelled by @xmath166 the components of the displacement vector",

    "we shall not use tildes and subscripts denoting @xmath104 for quantities associated with eigen modes .",

    "they can also be presented in another equivalent form as @xmath276 where the dependence of the functions @xmath277 and @xmath278 on @xmath279 follows from @xmath268 and @xmath280 accordingly , the energy transfer in the inertial frame follows from @xmath281 @xmath282 and the use of @xmath283 where all quantities in the brackets belong to a particular value of @xmath284 @xmath285 where all quantities in the brackets are evaluated for @xmath286 and @xmath287 as @xmath288    usually , the moment of inertia of the planet is much smaller than the moment of inertia of the orbit . in this case",
    "the planet tends to rotate with equilibrium value of the angular velocity , @xmath289 determined by condition that there is no exchange of angular momentum between the planet and the orbit at this rotation rate , @xmath290 this state of rotation is often referred to as a state of pseudo - synchronisation. for a given model of planet , equation @xmath291 can be solved numerically to find @xmath289 .",
    "the expression for the energy transfer at the state of pseudo - synchronisation , @xmath292 , follows from equation @xmath293 @xmath294 where @xmath295 depends only on the structure of a planet . for simplicity we set @xmath296 hereafter .",
    "the expressions for a comparable mass ratio @xmath231 can be easily obtained from our equations by an appropriate re - scaling of variables we use .",
    "an estimate of @xmath297 can be obtained from the following semi - analytical arguments . as we will see below only two global modes with @xmath298",
    "mainly determine the energy transfer when @xmath299 and we can take into account only these two modes in the summation @xmath300 and @xmath301 .",
    "one of these modes has a positive eigen frequency with @xmath302 and the overlap integral @xmath303 , and another mode has a negative eigen frequency with @xmath304 .",
    "the equilibrium value of the angular velocity is always close to the frequency of periastron passage , with @xmath305 .",
    "this information is sufficient to estimate @xmath297 .",

    "we get @xmath309 . taking into account that @xmath310 and @xmath311",
    ", we get @xmath312 .",
    "this value is in a good agreement with numerical results discussed below , see discussion and equation @xmath313 in section 6 .",

    "@xmath315 , @xmath316 , @xmath317 , @xmath318 , @xmath319 , @xmath320 , @xmath321 and @xmath301 are strictly valid only when the energy stored in the modes can be dissipated between two successive periastron passages . in the opposite limit , when the dissipation time @xmath322 , where @xmath246 is the orbital period , the planet approaches periastron in a perturbed state .",
    "the additional linear perturbation induced during a particular periastron passage must be added to the perturbation already present in the star .",
    "since the mode energy is quadratic in the perturbed quantities , it can either decrease or increase after the periastron passage , depending on phase of the perturbations ( kochanek , 1992 , mardling 1995a , 1995b ) .",
    "this issue has been studied analytically by ip .",
    "it was found that when a change of the orbital period between two successive periastron passages is sufficiently large , the energy transfer proceeds in a stochastic way . in this case",
    "the phase of perturbation in the planet approaching periastron is not correlated with the phase of the perturbation induced by tides near periastron , and the energy transfer during the periastron passage is essentially a random quantity , with dispersion of the order of the expressions for the energy transfer calculated above . in this situation , a build - up of mode energy due to",
    "stochastic instability is possible .",
    "a semi - analytical condition for this instability to happen has been obtained in ip .",
    "here we generalise their formalism to take account of the specific features associated with inertial waves .",
    "let us assume that dissipation is negligible and treat the tidal influence as a sequence of impulses separated by periods of time equal to the orbital period . in this case , any time between two impulses the planet undergoes free oscillation , and the lagrangian displacement vector can be represented by an expression analogous to @xmath323 @xmath324 where the dimensionless real coefficients @xmath325 characterise the amplitudes of perturbations corresponding to different modes and @xmath326 are the corresponding phases .",
    "note that the origin of time is chosen to coincide with the moment of periastron passage .",
    "the expressions for the canonical energy and angular momentum follow from @xmath327 , @xmath328 and @xmath329 @xmath330 when @xmath331 these expressions obviously coincide with the expressions @xmath315 and @xmath316 for the single passage problem . for inertial waves equations",

    "as we discus below in the tidal problem we can neglect the contribution of @xmath27 terms . in this case , the mode energy in the inertial frame can be represented as @xmath339 where @xmath292 is given by @xmath301    after the periastron passage , the expression @xmath323 must be added to @xmath329 , and the resulting expression can brought again to the form @xmath329 but with new values of the amplitudes and phases , @xmath340 and @xmath341 .",
    "thus , the action of tidal forcing defines an iterative map @xmath342 .",
    "it is convenient to introduce new variables @xmath343 and @xmath344 . in terms of these variables",
    "this map has especially simple form ( ip ) @xmath345 where @xmath346 , and @xmath347 is a two dimensional rotational matrix .",

    "when @xmath246 is a constant , it is easy to see from equation @xmath348 that the amplitudes @xmath340 do not grow with the number of iterations .",
    "however , the orbital period depends on the orbital energy , @xmath350 , as @xmath351 and the orbital energy is proportional to the mode energy @xmath151 due to the law of energy conservation .",
    "since @xmath352 is proportional to the squares of the modes amplitudes , @xmath353 , the map is non - linear .    in order to simplify the problem ,",
    "let us consider a situation when the mode energy is much smaller than the orbital energy such that the orbital energy and angular momentum remain in the neighbourhood of some particular fixed values .",
    "in this case we can set @xmath354 , where @xmath355 is a constant , and @xmath356 where @xmath350 and @xmath357 are the orbital energy and semi - major axis corresponding to the period @xmath355 .",
    "now the angles @xmath358 can be expressed in terms of @xmath151 as @xmath359 where @xmath360 , @xmath361 and @xmath362 where we use equations @xmath363 , @xmath364 , @xmath301 and @xmath365 .",

    "since the angles @xmath369 are determined by initial conditions , the results should be averaged over these angles .    this map has been investigated numerically by ip for the case of only one high frequency mode .",
    "it has been found that the instability sets in when the average value of @xmath372 is larger than @xmath373 . in our case",
    "the situation is slightly more complicated since there are at least two modes which play a role in the energy transfer .",
    "also , we should specify the evolution of the angular velocity .",
    "in order to investigate this question we consider numerically the simplest possible case of constant equilibrium rotation of a planet , when @xmath374 .",
    "for definiteness , we use parameters described in the end of the previous section , namely @xmath375 and consider only @xmath298 modes with @xmath376 and @xmath377 . in this case",
    "we have @xmath378 in the first case and @xmath379 in the second .",
    "we iterate numerically the map for a large number @xmath380 of iterations for a given value of @xmath381 with @xmath382 , and for a given value of @xmath372 .",
    "the stochastic instability is assumed to set in when the energy @xmath383 exceeds the maximal number of iterations , @xmath384 during the iterations .",
    "this happens when @xmath372 exceeds some critical value @xmath385 .",
    "the results of our computations are shown in figure 1 .",
    "one can see from this figure that there is a strong dependence of @xmath386 on @xmath381 .",
    "nevertheless we use the averaged value of @xmath386 , @xmath387 since our results are rather insensitive to the exact values of @xmath386 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the transition from a quasi - periodic behaviour of @xmath383 to stochastic behaviour is very sharp . in figure 2",
    "we show the evolution of @xmath383 for @xmath388 and two values of @xmath372 : @xmath389 and @xmath390 .",
    "one can see from this figure that a small change of @xmath372 is sufficient for stochastic instability to set in .    from the condition",
    "@xmath391 we find that the stochastic instability sets in only when the semi - major axis is sufficiently large , @xmath392 using the values of all quantities in @xmath393 typical for the problem of circularisation of extra solar planets , we have @xmath394 where @xmath395 , @xmath396 and @xmath397 are the masses of jupiter and of the sun , respectively , and @xmath398 is the radius of jupiter .",
    "remarkably , the typical value of @xmath399 is close to what has been obtained in the analysis of the stochastic instability associated with the fundamental modes ( ip ) .",
    "this value is of the order of a typical initial semi - major axis from which we would expect the process of circularisation to begin for @xmath400 this corresponds to a final circularised period of @xmath401  d for a jupiter mass planet around a solar type star .",
    "however if the final period is reduced to @xmath402  d , corresponding to the shortest period exoplanets , the initial semi - major axis is reduced to between @xmath403 and @xmath404 if the initial semi - major axis is smaller , the stochastic growth of the mode energy is not possible . however , in this case , we would expect a stronger dissipation of the mode energy due non - linear mode - mode interactions ( e.g. kumar @xmath21 goodman 1996 ) .",
    "this possibility needs a further investigation .",
    "in this section we construct realistic models of planets at different evolutionary stages for which we obtain the oscillation spectra numerically .",
    "we discuss our numerical method , use it to solve equation @xmath405 , and discuss the results which are used in subsequent sections to evaluate the tidal responses of different planet models undergoing a fly by or circularisation from a highly eccentric orbit .",
    "we find it convenient to adopt a system of dimensionless units for the spatial coordinates , density and the sound speed expressing them in units of @xmath258 , the averaged density @xmath259 , and @xmath260 , respectively .",
    "we also use dimensionless frequencies @xmath406      we assume that the planets are spherically symmetric and adopt the equation of state of saumon , chabrier @xmath21 van horn ( 1995 ) . although it is likely that giant planets form through a nucleated core instability ( eg .",
    "bodenheimer @xmath21 pollack 1986 ) , for this first set of calculations , for reasons of simplicity we shall assume that solid cores are absent .",
    "in this context we note that the mass of any solid core in jupiter is highly uncertain , being sensitive among other things to the equation of state adopted , with recent estimates showing it to be consistent with zero ( see saumon & guillot 2004 ) . to make this consistent with a nucleated core instability scenario for formation",
    ", these authors suggest that a core could be eroded and remixed during subsequent gas accretion of light elements .",
    "but it should be noted that the presence of a large solid core could significantly affect the mode spectrum of the planet through the existence of wave attractors ( eg .",
    "ogilvie & lin 2004 ) that could produce effects on a long time scale .",
    "however , the presence of a small core is unlikely to affect phenomena of short duration such as the energy transfer that occurs during a close passage or fly by .",
    "we calculate numerically the form of @xmath38 and @xmath46 as functions of the radius @xmath407 with these functions known , equation @xmath206 can be solved and the overlap integrals @xmath408 calculated . as in ip",
    "we consider only two planet masses @xmath409 and @xmath410 .    for a given mass we calculate planet models for six values of the radius .",
    "these are @xmath411 ( @xmath412 ) when @xmath413 ( @xmath414 ) , and @xmath415 , @xmath416 , @xmath417 , @xmath418 , @xmath419 for both masses .",
    "the different values of radius for a given mass correspond to different points on an evolutionary track .",
    "on such a track , the radius decreases with time due to gravitational contraction . to determine the age corresponding to a given radius",
    ", we use the relationship between the radius and luminosity , and hence the age of the planet calculated by burrows et al ( 1997 ) ( see fig . 8 of ip ) .",
    "since a young hot planet of age @xmath420 has a radius of around @xmath421 the range of radii we consider corresponds to planet ages between @xmath420 and @xmath422 .",
    "we illustrate the dependences of the density , the magnitude of the density gradient @xmath423 and square of the sound speed for several planet models in figures [ fig.3]-[fig.5 ] . as one can see from figure [ fig.3 ] for a particular planet , the ratio of central density to mean density increases with radius .",
    "this effect is less prominent for the models with @xmath424    note a sharp drop of density at @xmath425 when @xmath426 and @xmath427 this is due to the phase transition of hydrogen from the metallic to molecular phase which is assumed to be of the first kind .",
    "this phase transition also takes place when @xmath414 and @xmath428 but it is shifted to a larger @xmath429 and is not well resolved in this figure . in general , according to saumon , chabrier @xmath21 van horn ( 1995 ) , the phase transition is of the first kind when @xmath430 ( @xmath431 ) for @xmath409 ( @xmath414 ) . for larger radii the adiabats describing the interiors of the planets go above the critical point of saumon , chabrier @xmath21 van horn ( 1995 ) equation of state on @xmath432 phase plane . as we see below the effect of the phase transition on the structure of the eigen spectrum",
    "is more prominent for @xmath409 .    to illustrate this",
    "it is of interest to compare this model with a similar model without the phase transition and we make such a model with smoothed out transition between the metallic and molecular phases ( dotted curves in figures 3 - 5 ) , for @xmath409 and @xmath433 this model has been calculated using a prescription provided by saumon , chabrier @xmath21 van horn 1995 .",
    "the structure of the density profiles is better seen in figure [ fig.4 ] where the magnitudes of the density gradients are plotted .",
    "for the models with the phase transition there is a discontinuity at the radius of the phase transition . for the models without the phase transition the modulus of the gradients increase with radius at small @xmath434 , and they sharply decrease at large @xmath434 .",
    "the transition point between these two limiting cases corresponds to a melting point where the number density of the hydrogen molecules sharply decreases toward smaller values of @xmath434 .",
    "this transition point shifts toward smaller @xmath434 with increase of the planet radius .",
    "as seen from figure [ fig.5 ] the sound speed is changes non monotonically near the transition point .    in general , the models corresponding to the larger mass are more similar to each other . in this case the radius of transition is shifted toward larger @xmath434 where the planets have rather low density .",
    "the low density outer regions of the planet should not influence eigenfrequencies and eigenfunctions corresponding to global modes should they exist .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to suppose the presence of the phase transitions and the melting zones in the planet models with @xmath414 is less significant for our problem than for the case of @xmath409 . as we see below this assumption",
    "is supported by our numerical results .      for our numerical work",
    "we use a method similar to that proposed by pp .",
    "this involves reducing the operator equations to discrete form by use of a set of basis functions .      for our numerical work",
    "it is convenient to work with a matrix representation of equation @xmath436 this is accomplished by use of a basis of trial functions @xmath437 , @xmath438 which is assumed to be complete .",
    "we introduce a fourier decomposition of an eigenfunction @xmath439 in terms of the trial functions as @xmath440 where the indices enumerating the eigen functions are enclosed in brackets from now on .",
    "then we substitute equation @xmath441 into equation @xmath435 and taking the scalar product @xmath442 of the resulting expression with @xmath443 we get @xmath444 where @xmath445 and the standard summation rule over the repeating indices is implied",
    ". we can introduce square roots and inverses of the above matrices in a similar manner to that adopted for the corresponding operators .",

    "we have @xmath451 the eigen value problem @xmath452 can be formulated for the vectors @xmath453 in a way equivalent to @xmath405 , @xmath454 where the matrix @xmath455 has a structure equivalent to the operator @xmath204 ( equation @xmath456 ) with the operators being substituted by the corresponding matrices .",
    "it is natural to use the solutions of the eigenvalue problem @xmath457 as the functions @xmath437 .",
    "these functions are orthogonal with respect to the inner product @xmath458 . as follows from equation @xmath182 , for the spherical planet models the variables in equation @xmath459 are separable in spherical polar coordinates @xmath460 , @xmath461 , where @xmath462 .",

    "it follows from @xmath468 that the eigen values of @xmath186 are bound from below : @xmath469 when @xmath470 .",
    "in our numerical work we truncate the series @xmath441 at some sufficiently large value @xmath471 .",
    "the trial functions must be arranged in such a way that when @xmath464 is sufficiently large the corresponding trial functions oscillate with periods of spatial oscillation that decrease with increasing @xmath464 . in this case",
    ", one can argue that errors will be small because of a negligible contribution of the oscillatory terms with high @xmath464 to the various integrals occurring in the formulation of our problem as discussed above .",
    "of course , this idea must be tested , and we discuss such tests later .    since for our problem @xmath472 is even and",
    "the angular parts of the trial functions are such that @xmath473 the modes odd with respect to reflection in @xmath474 do not couple with the tidal field and we can choose @xmath475 to be even . thus @xmath476 with @xmath477 being a positive integer such that @xmath478    it is convenient to consider an equal number of the radial functions @xmath479 and angular functions @xmath480 thus we write @xmath481 in our numerical work , we use different values of @xmath384 in order to study the dependence on the number of trial functions , with the largest @xmath482 .",

    "this is ultimately likely to be discrete but everywhere dense ( see eg .",
    "one should also consider the possibility of the existence of a continuous spectrum in some cases .",
    "then the numerically obtained eigenfunctions may not show convergence to regular functions .",
    "but note that , independently of this issue , we expect our numerical method to be convergent when the eigenfunctions we obtain are used to provide a basis for representing smooth functions varying on a global scale .",
    "the issue of the possibility of ultimately irregular eigenfunctions belonging to a continuous spectrum does not affect this or preclude the convergence of the process of calculating the angular momentum and energy exchanges associated with a fly by . on account of the forcing by a global potential and short time duration of a fly by",
    ", a basis representation capable of representing global scales would be expected to be adequate on physical grounds .",
    "indeed for our models it turns out that only a few global eigenfunctions are important for determining the energy exchanged and these can be represented with a basis set that needs only to be capable of representing global functions .",
    "this makes the issue qualitatively different to the one that occurs in the context of tidal forcing occurring in a circular orbit with fixed frequency for infinite time periods ( eg.ogilvie & lin 2004 ) .",
    "it is obvious that the dimension of the matrix @xmath455 is @xmath490 .",
    "thus , we have @xmath490 eigen values @xmath491 and eigen vectors . are degenerate . ]",
    "the number of terms in the series occurring in @xmath318 , @xmath319 and @xmath492 determining the tidal response , is proportional to @xmath493 .",
    "it is important to check whether the process adopted and the corresponding series converges and we discuss this issue below . as we have stressed above , the convergence of the series means that the tidal response is mainly determined by a few global modes with a large scale distribution of @xmath439 over the planet .",
    "the results of our numerical calculations reported below allow us to suggest that the numerical method described above is stable and robust for the modes with sufficiently large values of @xmath495 .",
    "however , there is a problem with this approach related to the case of small values of @xmath496 .",
    "this problem is associated with the existence of a non - trivial null space of the operator @xmath497 .",
    "it is easy to see that all modes satisfying @xmath498 are degenerate solutions of @xmath435 ( and @xmath405 ) with @xmath494 .",
    "in fact any @xmath439 that is independent of @xmath499 will do .",
    "the corresponding norm @xmath500 .",
    "physically , for @xmath501 these modes correspond to introducing an infinitesimal amount of differential rotation and thus slightly shifting the static equilibrium .",
    "as follows from equation @xmath502 the overlap integrals are formally infinite for these modes .",
    "however , in the exact theory this does not lead to any difficulty since the contribution of a particular mode to the energy exchange is proportional to @xmath503 ( see e.g. equation @xmath318 .",
    "this means that the degenerate set of modes is in fact not excited .",
    "however , due to numerical inaccuracy of our method the modes formally belonging to the null space of @xmath497 acquire small non zero @xmath491 .",
    "the corresponding overlap integrals are very large and they can lead , in principal , to a very large unphysical energy transfer .",
    "this problem is not significant for the case of @xmath298 . in this case , the quantities @xmath504 entering in @xmath318 are very small for an interesting range of @xmath505 .",
    "they suppress effectively the contribution of the spurious modes to the energy and angular momentum exchange . on the other hand , in the case of @xmath27 the corresponding quantities",
    "@xmath506 do not suppress this contribution , and the spurious modes do lead to a very large unphysical energy transfer . therefore , in principle , the numerical method must be able to overcome this difficulty , by e.g. incorporating the solutions to @xmath507 in the set of the trial functions .    this can be done by considering polynomials consisting of products of different power of @xmath508 and @xmath499 as a new set of trial functions ( pp ) instead of solutions to @xmath459 . however , this set is difficult to use when considering a large values of @xmath493 .",
    "therefore , in our numerical work we simply identified the spurious modes corresponding to @xmath27 by comparing the spectra calculated using these two different sets of trial functions and removed them from the summation in the expression for the transfer of energy ( there is no angular momentum exchange in this case ) .",
    "the resulting contribution to the energy exchange appears to be very small compared with what is obtained for the case of @xmath298 , and we will not discuss further the case @xmath27 below .      in this section",
    "we discuss in detail the case of a planet with @xmath409 and @xmath411 .",
    "this case has the most complicated spectrum of all models we consider . in our opinion , this is mainly because of the presence of the phase transition at a sufficiently small radius @xmath425 .",
    "the analysis of the eigenfrequencies and the eigenmodes developed for this case can be easily applied to planets with larger radii and masses which have a simpler structure .    in figure [ fig.6 ]",

    "the frequencies and amplitudes of these modes depends only weakly on the number of trial functions , and these modes are especially important for the problem on hand .",
    "however , contrary to the case of a polytropic star with index @xmath521 , there are some other markedly large values of @xmath511 associated with modes at other eigenfrequencies ( eg . near @xmath524 and @xmath525 ) .",

    "it is seen from this figure that when @xmath528 is sufficiently large the curves representing large values of @xmath518 and @xmath517 are in a very good agreement with each other .",
    "the curves representing @xmath527 and @xmath278 for @xmath515 are also in qualitative agreement with those corresponding to the larger value of @xmath493 .",
    "however , the curve representing @xmath529 deviates significantly when @xmath530 .",
    "when @xmath528 is small , the curves representing @xmath515 and @xmath516 have larger values compared to the case with @xmath531 .",
    "this is due the contribution of spurious modes with eigenfrequencies very close to @xmath532 . in principle",
    ", we can improve the agreement between different curves significantly simply by discarding these modes .",
    "however , as we will see below it is possible to improve the stability of our numerical scheme with respect to the choice of different numbers of trial functions and suppress the influence of these spurious modes automatically .      in order to improve the stability of our numerical scheme with respect to numerical noise we would like to separate the eigenspectrum into bins with a finite frequency width and adopt the sum of the overlap integrals within a particular bin instead of @xmath511 . to begin , we redefine the overlap integral according to the rule @xmath533 it follows from equation @xmath534 , that the quantity @xmath529 has especially simple form when expressed in terms @xmath535 , namely @xmath536 to define the frequency bins let us separate the eigenspectrum into regions between successive minima of @xmath537 and treat all @xmath538 and @xmath491 within such a region as belonging to the same bin .",
    "note that modes defining minima are not included in the bins .",
    "accordingly , we have @xmath539 as new binned overlap integrals and binned eigenfrequencies . here",
    ", the summation is performed over all eigenfrequencies belonging to the same bin , and @xmath540 is a number of a bin .    the result of comparison between the binned quantities @xmath541 corresponding to different @xmath493 and the quantities @xmath542 calculated with the largest @xmath531 is shown in figure [ fig.8 ] .",
    "one can see from this figure that the binned quantities calculated for @xmath518 and @xmath531 are in a good agreement .",
    "the results corresponding to @xmath515 agree with what is shown for larger values of @xmath493 for the two main global modes .",
    "they are also in qualitative agreement for @xmath543 , but deviate in a part of the spectrum with positive values of @xmath491 .",
    "it turns out that this deviation is not important for our purposes .",
    "indeed , the positive part of the spectrum plays a role in the tidal response problem when @xmath279 is small . in this case",
    "width of the function @xmath504 is rather large , and the tidal response is mainly determined by the main global mode with @xmath544 and the largest overlap integral .",
    "when @xmath279 is large , the tidal response is mainly determined by the modes with negative @xmath491 which can then comove with the tidal perturbation near periastron .",
    "the width of @xmath504 decreases with increase of @xmath279 , and , when the rotation rate is large , the tidal response is determined by several modes with sufficiently large overlap integral and sufficiently large absolute values of @xmath491 .",
    "this effect explains in part why the energy transfer in the rotating frame determined by the quantity @xmath529 tends to some non - zero value with increase of the rotation rate ( see e.g. figure 7 and figure 9 ) .    in figure [ fig.9 ]",
    "we show the quantities @xmath527 , @xmath529 and @xmath545 calculated using the binned overlap integrals for the different values of @xmath493 and the corresponding quantities calculated using the non - binned overlap integrals with @xmath531 .",
    "comparing figure [ fig.7 ] with figure [ fig.8 ] we see that the use of the binned quantities does allows us to improve significantly the stability of our numerical scheme with respect to different numbers of basis functions .",
    "now , all curves are in a good agreement with each other for the whole considered range of @xmath279 .      in figure [ fig.10 ]",
    "we show the result of calculation of the overlap integrals for the model with smoothed out phase transition ( dashed curve ) together with the overlap integrals for the model with the phase transition .",
    "as it is seen from this figure the two main global modes have practically the same overlap integrals for the both models . however , other prominent spikes present in the model with a phase transition are absent for the model without the phase transition .",
    "therefore , there only two global modes in that case .",
    "one can assume that the presence of the other global non standard modes in the realistic planet models is related to the presence of the phase transition .",
    "in fact , as we will see below these modes are also present in the planet models with larger radii where the phase transition is absent .",
    "it is reasonable to suppose that the presence of some of these modes is related to a sharp decrease of the density after the radius of the phase transition ( or the melting point for the models with larger radii , see figures [ fig.3 ] and [ fig.4 ] ) in the realistic planet models .",
    "as we have pointed out above there is a set of modes characterised by relatively large values of the overlap integrals .",
    "these modes are referred to as global modes .",
    "physically , these modes have eigenfunctions for which @xmath439 varies on a large scale . in this situation ,",
    "the overlap integrals are not averaged to small values after integration over the volume of the planet .    as can be seen from figures [ fig.6 ] , [ fig.8 ] and [ fig.10 ]",
    "there are more than ten modes with markedly large overlap integrals .",
    "however , they are not equally important for the problem on hand .",
    "the two most important modes are the main global modes with the largest values of the overlap integrals .",
    "these are present in all our models as well as in polytropic stars .",
    "other global modes with negative values of @xmath491 can also play an important role in the tidal response .",
    "additionally , it is interesting to consider the positive and negative frequency global modes with the largest values of @xmath538 after the main modes .",
    "these modes contain information about the difference of the realistic planet models from over - simplified polytropes , and may be of interest for another problems as well .",
    "there are eight modes satisfying these criteria .",
    "their eigen frequencies and overlap integrals are shown in table [ table1 ] .    [",
    "cols=\"<,<,>,>,>,>,<,>,<,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     as follows from these table apart from the case of a planet with jupiter mass and radius which gives a rather large value @xmath546 , the values of @xmath297 and @xmath547 are rather close to each other . therefore ,",
    "in our estimates of the time scale of tidal circularisation below we will use the typical values @xmath548 and @xmath375 .",
    "accordingly , the energy transfer will be given by @xmath549 regardless of the planet radius and mass .",
    "in figure [ fig.16 ] we show the dependence of @xmath292 on @xmath550 as a solid curve .",
    "the dotted , dashed and dot - dashed curves correspond to the energy transfer associated with the fundamental modes , @xmath551 .",
    "they are calculated with help of equations derived in ip and presented in appendix .. this has no influence on the conclusions of ip .",
    "the correct expressions are shown in appendix . ] in a similar manner to the energy transfer associated with the inertial modes , @xmath551 depends on the angular velocity of the planet , and we present several different curves calculated for different values of @xmath552 .",
    "the dashed curves are calculated for a non - rotating planet with @xmath553 , they correspond to a maximal energy transfer @xmath554 as a function of @xmath555 .",
    "the dotted curves are calculated for the case @xmath556 .",
    "the dot - dashed curves are calculated for the equilibrium angular velocity of the planet , @xmath557 , associated with the fundamental modes , see equation @xmath558 of appendix . these curves give a minimal energy transfer @xmath559 as a function of @xmath552 , for a given @xmath550 .    as follows from appendix , in order to calculate @xmath551 the eigenfrequencies associated with the fundamental modes , @xmath560 as well as the corresponding dimensionless overlap integrals , @xmath561 must be known .",
    "these quantities depend on the planet structure , and therefore they are different , in principle , for planets with different masses and radii , see ip for their numerical values . in figure [ fig.16 ]",
    "we show the case of a planet with @xmath413 and @xmath562 ( the upper dashed , dotted and dot - dashed curves ) , where we have @xmath563 and @xmath564 .",
    "the lower dashed , dotted and dot - dashed curves represent the case of a planet with the same value of mass and @xmath565 with @xmath566 and @xmath567 . as follows from the results provided in ip , when @xmath414 the dependence of the eigenfrequencies and overlap integrals on the planet radius is rather weak , and the corresponding energy transfer is always approximately represented by the upper dashed and dotted curves in figure [ fig.16 ] .    as follows from figure [ fig.16 ] the inertial modes",
    "dominate the energy transfer for sufficiently large values of @xmath550 .",
    "when @xmath374 the contribution determined by the inertial waves dominates over that corresponding to the fundamental modes for @xmath568 in the case of @xmath562 and for @xmath569 in the case of @xmath565 .",
    "thus , we expect that the circularisation of the planet orbits with sufficiently large periastron distances is mainly determined by the contribution associated with the inertial modes .",
    "in this section we apply the results developed in the previous sections to estimate the effect of tides exerted by the central star on the planet on the planet orbital evolution .",
    "we assume that the state of pseudo - synchronisation with @xmath570 is maintained in a situation when the inertial modes dominate over the fundamental modes in tidal response .",
    "apart from the fact that we mainly consider the effects of inertial waves , the formulation of the problem is analogous to what was discussed in ip .",
    "let us consider a planetary system consisting of a few massive planet and a central star and assume that a certain planet has lost a significant amount of its orbital angular momentum , most probably due to gravitational interaction with other planets in the planetary system .",
    "such situations have been frequently observed in numerical simulations of gravitationally interacting planets ( papaloizou @xmath21 terquem 2001 , adams @xmath21 laughlin 2003 )",
    ". the orbital semi - major axis of this planet , in this case , could be of the order of its typical value @xmath571 while the periastron distance @xmath155 could be very small , of the order of a few stellar radii .",
    "for a such eccentric orbit the orbital angular momentum per unit of mass is related to the periastron distance as @xmath572 .",
    "if we assume that the orbital evolution is determined by tides , the angular momentum is approximately conserved while the semi - major axis may decrease due to transfer of the orbital energy into oscillations of the planet by tides and subsequent dissipation . then , the energy may be radiated away from the planet .",
    "the conservation of the angular momentum leads to the well known fact that the radius a final circular orbit , @xmath573 is twice as large as the periastron distance @xmath155 .",
    "therefore , @xmath155 can be related to the observed orbital period of the planet after circularisation , @xmath574 , as @xmath575 where @xmath576 , @xmath577 is the stellar radius and @xmath578 is the radius of the sun .",
    "we have , accordingly , from equation @xmath364 @xmath579 for the planet and the star with jupiter and solar values of mass and radius , respectively , @xmath580 .",
    "let us consider the evolution of the semi - major axis of the eccentric planet orbit due to tidal interactions near the orbit periastron .",
    "we can assume that the contributions from each of successive impulsive energy transfer can be added to each other only when one of two conditions is fulfilled : either the energy is dissipated during two successive periastron passages or the condition for the stochastic instability @xmath581 is satisfied .",
    "in the latter case the evolution of the semi - major axis is stochastic , and we assume below that , in this case , our evolution equations are written for averaged over some distributions values of the corresponding quantities .    under these assumption",
    "we can write the evolution equation for semi - major axis , @xmath582 , in the form ( ip ) @xmath583 where @xmath584 .",
    "the characteristic evolution time @xmath585 depends on the energy transfer due to dynamic tides associated with the inertial and fundamental modes in the planet , @xmath292 and @xmath551 , respectively , and also on the transfer of the orbital energy into stellar oscillations determined by dynamic tides exerted on the star @xmath586 where @xmath292 is given by equation @xmath313 and @xmath587 stands for the energy transfer associated with dynamic tides in the star .",
    "note that the time @xmath588 implicitly depends on time @xmath25 through dependence of the planet radius @xmath258 on time due to the evolutionary cooling and a possible tidal heating of the planet .",
    "equation @xmath589 can be integrated to give @xmath590 where @xmath591 is the initial value of the semi - major axis expressed in units of @xmath592 .",
    "a more accurate compared to @xmath589 definition of the evolution time scale , @xmath593 , can be obtained from equation @xmath594 requiring that the semi - major axis @xmath595 is formally equal to zero when @xmath596 .",
    "thus @xmath597    for a constant value of @xmath588 , @xmath598 . in this case",
    "we can obtain a simple estimate of @xmath593 assuming that the transfer of energy is determined only by the inertial modes .",
    "setting @xmath599 in equation @xmath600 and substituting equations @xmath313 , @xmath601 and @xmath600 into @xmath589 , we have @xmath602 note a very strong dependence of @xmath593 on @xmath258 and @xmath246 .",
    "results of numerical calculations of @xmath593 are shown in figure [ fig.25 ] for the case of a planet with @xmath409 , and in figure [ fig.26 ] for a planet with @xmath414 . in order to calculate",
    "@xmath593 we use expressions for the energy transfer associated with the fundamental modes given in appendix , the corresponding eigenfrequencies and overlap integrals are given in ip .",
    "the dependence of @xmath258 on time is taken from burrows et al ( 1997 ) where a cooling history of isolated planets is considered .",
    "thus we neglect effects of tidal heating on the planet size and structure reserving their discussion for a future work .",
    "burrows et al ( 1997 ) consider evolution of the planet radius starting from the initial time @xmath603 and until a maximal time @xmath604 is reached .",
    "we set the initial time @xmath605 .",
    "we assume that the planet radius is not changed significantly for @xmath606 and set @xmath607 with @xmath608 for @xmath413 and @xmath609 for @xmath414 .",
    "the lower curves of the same type in figures [ fig.25 ] and [ fig.26 ] correspond to @xmath610 and the upper curves are calculated for @xmath611 .    in figure [ fig.25 ]",
    "the solid curves describe the dependence of @xmath593 on @xmath246 calculated under assumption that only inertial waves contribute to the tidal evolution , and accordingly , in this case @xmath612 in equation @xmath600 . for the dashed curves we take into account all the contributions to the sum in @xmath600 .",
    "is , strictly speaking , not correct .",
    "however , we assume hereafter that this procedure gives correct order of magnitude estimates reported in this paper . ] in order to calculate @xmath587 we model the star as a non rotating @xmath613 polytrope and take into account the contributions of @xmath19 , @xmath3 and low order @xmath224 modes , see ip for details .",

    "this may be justified according to the following arguments .",
    "the inertial modes dominates over the fundamental modes at sufficiently large values of @xmath550 , and accordingly at sufficiently large values of @xmath246 , and the fundamental modes dominate at smaller values of @xmath246 .",
    "taking into account that the contribution of fundamental modes decreases exponentially with increase of @xmath246 , the transition from the case of domination of the fundamental modes to the case of domination of inertial modes occurs near a certain value of @xmath246 . taking into account that a planet with a low value of the moment of inertia has the angular velocity always close to the equilibrium value determined by the modes dominating the energy transfer",
    ", the dashed curve could give an order of magnitude estimate of @xmath593 for the whole range of @xmath246 .",
    "the dotted curves show the results of calculation of @xmath593 for the case of a non rotating planet . in this case",
    "the energy transfer determined by the inertial modes is absent and we set @xmath615 in equation @xmath600 and we use equation @xmath616 to calculate @xmath551 .    as seen from figure [ fig.25 ] when @xmath409 the inertial modes dominate for @xmath617 .",
    "the time scale of circularisation is smaller than a typical life time of a planetary system @xmath618 when @xmath619 for @xmath610 and when @xmath620 for @xmath611 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the contribution of the fundamental modes sharply decrease when @xmath621 .",
    "this is simply because the energy transfer associated with the fundamental modes is highly sensitive to the radius of the planet ( see appendix ) .",
    "it can lead to a substantial change of the semi - major axis only when the planet radius is close to its initial value @xmath622 .",
    "the cooling of the planet results in a decrease of the planet radius on a time scale @xmath420 and the contribution of the fundamental modes quickly become unimportant after this time is reached .",
    "the tides exerted on the star are not significant at all for a planet with @xmath409 .    in figure [ fig.26 ]",
    "we show the results corresponding to a planet with @xmath414 .",
    "contrary to the previous case now the inertial modes are not important for the whole range of @xmath246 and the circularisation time scale at large values of @xmath246 is determined by tides exerted by the planet on the star .",
    "this may be explained as follows . at large values of @xmath246",
    "the circularisation time scale is of the order of several @xmath12 . a planet with its mass in the range @xmath623 and its age of the order of a few @xmath12 has the radius close to @xmath624 .",
    "the circularisation time scale is mainly determined by the expressions for the energy transfer calculated for this radius .",
    "assuming that the inertial modes dominate we can use equation @xmath625 to estimate @xmath593 . as follows from this equation @xmath626 . when eg . @xmath627 and",
    "@xmath610 we have @xmath628 for @xmath409 and @xmath629 for @xmath414 .",
    "obviously , the inertial modes can not lead to a significant decrease of the semi - major distance in the latter case over the life time of the planetary systems .",
    "unlike the situation with the inertial modes , the energy transfer determined by the stellar modes grows with the planet mass , and therefore the tides exerted on the star dominate when the planet mass is sufficiently large .",
    "in this paper we have developed and extended a new self - adjoint formalism for the problem of small stellar oscillations proposed in our recent paper(pi ) .",
    "we went on to apply this to the calculation of the tidal response of uniformly rotating fully convective planets and stars which undergo a single encounter in a parabolic orbit or a sequence of multiple encounters in a weakly bound orbit .",
    "this was then applied to the problem of the tidal circularisation of the orbits of the extrasolar planets .    in section 2",
    "we began by showing that the general formalism , presented in pi when @xmath630 is used as variable characterising linear eigenmodes , can also be applied when the lagrangian displacement is used .",
    "the advantage of this approach is that , as no low frequency approximation is needed , it allows us to consider pulsations of arbitrary frequency .",
    "we derived general expressions for the energy and angular momentum transfer that occurs when a rotating planet or a star passes through periastron in a parabolic or highly eccentric orbit around a central mass the amplitudes and phases of the eigenmodes excited in the planet or a star as a result of the tidal encounter were also determined .",
    "we showed that these expressions can be represented in terms of a spectral decomposition over the normal modes of the self - adjoint operator @xmath631 .",
    "we also obtained a self - consistent expression for the rate of dissipation of an excited mode to leading order in the small parameter defined by the ratio of pulsation period to a characteristic dissipation time scale .    in section 3",
    "we focused on the case of low frequency inertial modes , showing how the more general formalism in terms of the lagrangian displacement can be reduced to that in pi in the low frequency limit .",
    "this procedure allows one to separate out the contribution associated with the inertial modes and simplify the equations governing free pulsation of a rotating planet or a star . in that case",
    "the corresponding self - adjoint problem is formulated through equations @xmath405 and @xmath456 .",
    "note that the tidal response of the inertial modes to impulsive tidal forcing has not been described using other methods .",
    "we showed in section 4 that when the rotating planet or a star approaches periastron in an unperturbed state the tidal energy and angular momentum transfered through the excitation of inertial modes are given by very simple expressions @xmath320 and @xmath301 .",
    "we considered the multi - passage problem assuming that there was no significant dissipation of mode energy between successive periastron passages , and found a simple condition @xmath581 for the occurrence of stochastic instability that results in the stochastic gain of inertial mode energy over many periastron passages .",
    "this was quantitatively similar to that given by ip for @xmath3 modes .",
    "we found that for stochastic instability the circularisation process has to start with @xmath632 for final periods of @xmath5 days . or",
    "@xmath6 for final orbital periods @xmath7 days .",
    "in section 5 we applied our formalism to fully convective rotating giant planets . in order to evaluate the expressions for the energy and angular momentum transfer the eigenspectrum of @xmath456",
    "must be found numerically , for a given model .",
    "we calculated the eigenspectrum of the inertial modes for several planet models with a realistic equation of state .",
    "the details and stability of the numerical method we used are discussed in section 5.2 .",
    "we considered planet models with two different masses equal to @xmath633 and @xmath410 , with radii in the range @xmath634 .",
    "we found that , as in the case of @xmath20 polytrope considered by pi , the tidal response was determined by a few global eigenmodes with a large scale distribution of perturbed quantities .",
    "two main or standard global modes have eigenfrequencies close to those corresponding to the @xmath635 polytrope .",
    "these modes have the largest overlap integrals characterising coupling between the tidal field and the eigenmodes .",
    "however , we found that for realistic planet models , there could be non - standard global modes possibly related to a sharp change of structure occurring near to the point of ionisation of hydrogen .",
    "the structure of the non - standard modes as well as their stability with respect to a change of the planet mass and radius was discussed .",
    "the results obtained for the eigen spectra of realistic planet models were applied to the problem of tidal circularisation of the orbits of the extrasolar planets in sections 6 and 7 . in section 6",
    "we calculated the rotational angular velocity for which the net angular momentum transferred was zero . because of the relative low inertia of the planet compared to the orbit it is expected to rapidly attain this angular velocity and achieve a state of pseudo synchronisation . the angular velocity associated with pseudo synchronisation",
    "was found to be always close to @xmath2 times the angular velocity of a circular orbit at periastron .",
    "orbital evolution arises through the transfer of orbital energy to the modes of oscillation .",
    "transfers at successive periastron passages lead to orbital circularisation .",
    "this is the case , either when the mode energy is dissipated directly between encounters , or when the system is in the regime of stochastic instability .",
    "we compared the contribution associated with the inertial modes with the contribution associated with the fundamental modes , in a state of pseudo synchronisation , to the circularisation time scale in section 7 .",
    "we found that the inertial modes led to effective circularisation of a giant planet with mass @xmath636 on a time scale smaller than or of the order of a few @xmath12 , when the initial semi major axis was less than @xmath9 and the final orbital period after circularisation @xmath637 in this case the inertial modes play the most important role at the longer periods .",
    "however , the inertial waves are less important for the planets of larger mass @xmath410 that we considered . in that case the dynamic tides exerted on the star central star , which we assumed to be solar like , play a major role .    in our opinion ,",
    "the most important unresolved question related to the theory discussed above is concerned with internal dissipation .",
    "of particular concern is the internal location of modal dissipation and the related issue of whether the energy deposited can be radiated away between successive periastron passages .",
    "there are several potentially interesting channels of dissipation which may operate in our case .",
    "the non - linear parametric instability discussed by kumar and goodman ( 1996 ) for the case of @xmath19 modes in convectively stable stars may be effective for the inertial modes as well .",
    "this instability operates when there are eigenmodes in the stars with eigenfrequencies approximately half that of the eigenfrequencies of the tidally excited modes and sufficiently large coupling coefficients .",
    "these modes may be unstable on account of parametric resonance .",
    "taking into account that the eigenspectrum of the inertial modes is dense , unstable modes are expected to exist for sufficiently weak dissipative processes .",
    "this question will be addressed in our future work .",
    "our formalism is general enough that it can be extended to the case of convectively stable uniformly rotating stars and it can also be applied to other astrophysical situations where excitation of stellar pulsations with frequencies comparable to the angular velocity of rotation is important . in this particular work",
    "we assumed that the orbital and planetary angular momentum vectors were aligned .",
    "this is a very reasonable assumption when the system has many periastron passages and so readily attains a state of pseudo synchronisation during the circularisation process .",
    "however , misaligned angular momenta should be considered if the main issue is tidal capture , as in globular clusters , because in that case there is no reason for the initial angular momentum vectors to be correlated .",
    "these issues and extensions of the formalism will be considered in future work .",

    "<S> we consider the general problem of the tidal capture or circularisation from large eccentricity of a uniformly rotating object . </S>",
    "<S> we extend the self - adjoint formalism introduced in our recent paper(papaloizou & ivanov 2005 hereafter pi ) ) to derive general expressions for the energy and angular momentum transfered when the planet or a star passes through periastron in a parabolic or highly eccentric orbit around a central mass . </S>",
    "<S> these can be used without making a low frequency approximation as was done in pi . </S>",
    "<S> we show how these can be adapted to the low frequency limit in which only inertial modes contribute for baratropic planet models . in order to make quantitative estimates , </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the inertial mode eigenspectrum for planet models of one and five jupiter masses @xmath0 without a solid core , with different radii corresponding to different ages . </S>",
    "<S> the spectra are found in general to be more complex than of a polytrope with index @xmath1 considered in pi , because of the existence global modes associated with the transition from molecular to metallic hydrogen . </S>",
    "<S> nonetheless the main tidal response is still found to be determined by two global modes which have polytropic counterparts .    </S>",
    "<S> these also determine the uniform angular velocity in a state of pseudo synchronisation , for which the angular momentum transfered during an encounter is zero . </S>",
    "<S> this is found to be close to @xmath2 times the circular orbit angular velocity at periastron for all models considered . </S>",
    "<S> this is in contrast to the situation when only the @xmath3 mode is considered ( ivanov & papaloizou 2004 , hereafter ip ) and the equilibrium angular velocity is found to be much larger .    </S>",
    "<S> we consider the multi - passage problem when there is no dissipation finding that stochastic instability resulting in the stochastic gain of inertial mode energy over many periastron passages occurs under similar conditions to those already found by ip for the @xmath3 modes . </S>",
    "<S> we find that this requires circularisation to start with a semi - major axis exceeding @xmath4 for final periods of @xmath5 days . </S>",
    "<S> reducing to @xmath6 for final periods @xmath7 days .    </S>",
    "<S> finally we apply our calculations of the energy transfer during a periastron passage to the problem of the tidal circularisation of the orbits of the extrasolar planets in a state of pseudo synchronisation , expected because of the relatively small inertia of the planet , and find that inertial mode excitation dominates the tidal interaction for @xmath8 planets that start with semi- major axes less than @xmath9 and end up on circular orbits with final period in the @xmath10 day range . </S>",
    "<S> it is potentially able to account for initial circularisation up to a final @xmath11 day period within a few @xmath12 but in the case of @xmath13 oscillation modes excited in the star are more important .    </S>",
