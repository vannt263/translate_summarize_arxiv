    "as neither subsample of agn similarly exhibits a redshift separation , we do not plot them with different symbols according to redshift .",
    "the redshift tracks of the featureless agn and silicate agn composite seds occupy the same portion of the graph , so we only plot the silicate agn sed track in orange ; the track lies in the upper portion of the graph .",

    "the @xmath32 sources are on average lirgs ( @xmath54 ) and therefore have less dust to obscure the irac colors than our @xmath8 ulirg sed composite ; adding more dust to a sf galaxy will cause it to shift towards the top - left of this plot , which is exactly the shift we see between our @xmath32 and @xmath8 sed tracks . at @xmath55 ,",
    "the tracks approach the area occupied by the agn , but as none of our sf sources possess a redshift this high , we are unable to determine if our sources follow our tracks into the upper portion of the graph .",

    "[ sternlacy ] , we show on our composite seds the effective wavelengths of each of the irac bandwidths at redshifts 1 , 2 , and 3 ( blue , green , and red , respectively ) .",
    "these bands straddle the stellar bump over this redshift range .",
    "both agn seds have a power - law shape over these bands causing little evolution in irac colorspace .    the high degree of contamination in these irac color - color diagnostics by high redshift sf galaxies motivated @xcite to create more restrictive criteria than originally presented in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite uses a sample of agn identified at optical and x - ray wavelengths to construct the new criteria , and now we are able to test these criteria using mid - ir spectroscopic agn .",
    "we apply the new color cut presented in @xcite to our sample in figure [ donley ] .",
    "the authors determined the gray shaded region was the most effective at selecting out agn with power - law spectra in the irac bandwidths , and indeed , all of our sources that meet the more restrictive criteria have flux densities such that @xmath56 . based on our high redshift sources ,",
    "we propose the simple irac color cuts of @xmath57 ( solid lines in fig .",
    "[ donley ] ) for selecting potential power - law agn candidates , similar to the @xcite criteria .",
    "the irac color selection techniques , even using the more restrictive cuts presented in @xcite , still miss a large fraction ( 39% of the present sample ) of mid - ir spectroscopically confirmed agn , specifically most of the more obscured silicate agn .",
    "furthermore , such diagnostics can not conclusively determine if an agn is significantly contributing to the bolometric luminosity of a galaxy .",
    "since an irac color diagnostic applied at high redshift ( @xmath58  1.3 ) is necessarily based on separating sources into agn- or sf - dominated based on the shape of the spectrum in the near - ir , such diagnostics might not be the most desirable for determining the dominate power source of dust obscured galaxies in the mid - ir and far - ir regime .",
    "our large sample of high redshift sf and agn sources , identified with deep mid - ir spectroscopy , and wealth of multiwavelength photometry allows us to define new color - color diagnostics that are well suited to uncovering galaxies harboring an agn as revealed in the mid - ir spectrum , and galaxies with a bolometrically important agn .",
    "we seek to combine multiple portions of the ir spectrum that are probing the physical nature of each galaxy with different pieces of information . at @xmath50 m , sf galaxies at @xmath59 will have a stellar bump due to the underlying stellar population , while this effect might be washed out in luminous agn , producing a power - law shape .",
    "similarly , at these redshifts , the @xmath60 m filter will straddle the pah complexes at 7.7 and @xmath61 m , which will be weakened or absent in a bright agn .",
    "however , there is a caveat that at @xmath62 , the silicate absorption feature present in some agn spectra , falls into the @xmath60 m bandwidth which can produce colors that mimic sf galaxies . on the other hand ,",
    "the bandwidth is large enough that we do not expect this to be a significant source of contamination .",
    "the far - ir should have a different shape based on the relative amounts of cold and warm dust emission present , and sf galaxies will have relatively more cold dust than agn , while agn have an increased amount of warm dust ( paper i ) .",
    "finally , the @xmath63 m filter , at @xmath59 , covers a relatively featureless portion of the spectrum , so when combined with filters that are tracing features , should act as a base to distinguish between agn and sf systems .",
    "we used available photometry from _ herschel _ and _ spitzer _ ranging from @xmath64 m ( observed ) and explored every possible color combination . in addition , we also look at where the composite seds lie to get a sense of where we should expect to find agn and sf galaxies , on average .",
    "for color - color plots in which the agn were well separated from the sf sources , we calculated the contamination rates of each region .",
    "we find that a color diagnostic spanning the full range of the ir spectrum does the best job of separating both agn with pure power - law spectrum from @xmath65 m and agn with silicate absorption from sf galaxies at high redshift .",
    "we define two new color - color diagnostics which , based on having a low contamination and clarity of separation , are the optimal diagnostics to employ when a full suite of ir photometry exists .",
    "we find that combining longer wavelength photometry from _ herschel _ with mid - ir photometry from _ spitzer _",
    "mips / irac provides the most reliable separation between our mid - ir classified agn and sf galaxies since they probe the widest range of dust properties affected by agn and sf activity .",
    "figure [ basic250_24 ] shows @xmath3 vs. @xmath4 .",
    "both colors cause a separation of sources with the result that the sf dominated sources lie in the lower right portion of the graph ( separated by the diagonal solid line ) .",
    "the sf sources separate weakly according to redshift ( indicated by open and filled symbols ) with the lower redshift sources lying slightly below the high redshift sources .",
    "the redshift tracks calculated from the @xmath32 sf sed and @xmath8 sf sed follow similar evolutionary paths , although again they exhibit a separation in the irac color , @xmath4 , with the @xmath8 sf track redder than the @xmath32 sf track between @xmath59 .",
    "the sed redshift tracks trace out the area occupied by the sf galaxies according to the redshift separation exhibited by the sources .",

    "we plot both subsamples according to redshift ( filled symbols are @xmath32 and open symbols are @xmath8 ) .",
    "the featureless agn do not contaminate the sf region and lie further to the left ( lower @xmath66/@xmath67 ) than the silicate agn , due to an excess of warm dust emission in these sources .",

    "the track has some slight evolution along the x - axis with redshift , consistent with the individual data points .",
    "the silicate agn ( filled and open squares , according to redshift ) , on the other hand , show no evolution along the x - axis with redshift but show some spread along the y - axis .",
    "the fact that some silicate agn sources contaminate the sf region can be attributed to two effects , namely that some individual sources possess a weak stellar bump and some sources have more relative cold dust emission in the far - ir .",
    "the silicate agn sed redshift track exhibits no evolution in either direction and so is plotted as a star .",

    "we quantify the contamination of the sf and agn regions ( separated by the diagonal solid line ) : 10% of the sources ( 11 of 111 total ) in the sf region are agn and 2 of the 22 sources ( 9% ) in the agn region are sf dominated .",
    "none of the contaminating agn are power - law dominated .",
    "some of the individual silicate agn have a stellar bump ( 41% ) , causing contamination along the @xmath4 axis .",
    "futhermore , several of our silicate agn ( 8 , or 42% ) have significant amount of cold dust emission in the far - ir , producing @xmath3 flux density ratios greater than 1.3 .",
    "the high @xmath3 flux density ratio correlates with the presence of a stellar bump in the silicate agn , with 32% possessing both .",
    "finally , it is worthwhile to note that the contaminating agn are significantly fainter at @xmath60 m ( median @xmath70jy ) than the agn lying in the upper region of the graph ( median @xmath71jy ) .",
    "indeed , all but one of the properly identified agn have @xmath72jy . based on our sample of 24@xmath23 m bright sources , our diagnostic is optimized to select agn with @xmath72jy , though if the physics is similar in lower luminosity agn , they will have similar seds and colors , in which case our diagnostics can also be used to select out agn dominated sources .",
    "@xmath66 , in comparison with @xmath67 , is an indicator of the relative amount of cold dust in a galaxy . as",

    ", the cold dust will be the dominant contributor to the @xmath53 .",
    "low @xmath3 ratios in our mid - ir agn indicate that the warm dust , indicative of an agn , is significantly contributing to the far - ir emission , and accordingly , the agn is an important contributor to the bolometric luminosity .",

    "the uncertainties on our composites are not calculated directly from the intrinsic scatter in the data , but are the standard deviation of the calculated luminosity after resampling the data 10,000 times .",

    "the silicate agn exhibit no redshift evolution in this color space , but the featureless agn display a weak separation .",

    "[ basic100_24 ] shows three of our composite seds with lines illustrating where the relevant photometry bandwidths lie at a given redshift .",

    "[ basic100_24 ] , we test our diagnostic by overplotting the redshift tracks of local templates and a high redshift smg sed . the local agn mrk  231 ( red dashed line ) lies well outside the sf region while the starburst m  82 ( blue ) and local ulirg ngc  6240 ( orange ) lie inside it for the most part .",
    "the smg redshift track ( purple ) also lies in the sf region as expected since most smgs are star formation dominated ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "substituting @xmath81 instead of @xmath76 also works well for separating out the agn ( it has the same contamination rates mentioned above ) .",
    "however , the sf sources do not have a strong redshift separation , although , since @xmath81 is still probing the cold dust at lower redshifts , there is a stronger separation along the x - axis .",
    "the @xmath5 vs. @xmath4 colorspace can be used to select sf galaxies based on redshift as well as looking for agn .",
    "the @xmath82 sf galaxies have higher @xmath5 ratio since the @xmath80 m filter is tracing the cold dust . at redshift of 2",

    "we start by applying color - color diagnostics based on irac colors alone @xcite to our high redshift sample and find that there is significant contamination of sf sources in the agn regions ; however , our mid - ir spectroscopic sample confirms the new irac color diagnostics from @xcite .",
    "adding @xmath60 m photometry does not effectively separate all of the agn , but it does produce a separation of the sf galaxies according to redshift .",
    "the same separation of sf galaxies is produced by plotting our redshifted sed tracks in color - color graph using the wise transmission filters .",

    "the optimal color diagnostics for bright @xmath67 sources spanning the full ir spectrum are @xmath3 vs. @xmath4 and @xmath5 vs. @xmath4 .",
    "these diagnostics have a low contamination rate of @xmath610% in each of the sf and agn occupied regions , and the contaminating agn chiefly have @xmath88jy . moreover , the @xmath3 color estimates if an agn is significantly contributing to the bolometric output of a galaxy .",
    "the mid - ir photometry from wise can also be used in conjunction with _",
    "herschel _ photometry to separate out agn .",
    "when only limited data is available , either of the colors @xmath3 or @xmath4 can be used alone to select agn .",
    "we apply our new color - color diagnostics to the entire goods-_herschel _ survey to determine the fraction of sources which are dominated by agn and sf activity .",
    "we find roughly 10% of goods- _ herschel",
    "_ galaxies have a significant agn .",
    "we also confirm that a higher fraction ( @xmath89 ) of the brightest sources , @xmath90jy or @xmath91jy , have colors indicative of a bolometrically significant agn .",
    "the @xmath80 m and @xmath73 m fluxes show a much weaker dependence on agn fraction , though when combined with @xmath67 , @xmath66 effectively separates out the agn , indicating that the amount of cold dust emission relative to mid - ir emission is a good indicator of the ir power source .",
    "we conclude then that far - ir fluxes or colors alone can not be used to determine the nature of the ir power source , and the most effective method is to combine mid - ir and far - ir data .",
