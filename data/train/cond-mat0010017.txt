    "recently , the rare earth compounds retr@xmath2pn@xmath3 ( tr : fe , co , ru , os and pn : p , as , sb ) with the filled skutterudite structure@xmath6 have attracted much attention , partly because of a potential practical application as thermoelectric materials.@xmath7 also from the viewpoint of basic physics , a number of novel phenomena , such as a metal - insulator transition and intermediate valence , have been reported.@xmath8 torikachvili et al.@xmath9 have reported the first systematic study on refe@xmath2p@xmath3 where they found variety of interesting properties depending on re - atoms ; i.e. , superconducting lafe@xmath2p@xmath3 below 4.2k , insulating cefe@xmath2p@xmath3 , antiferromagnetic prfe@xmath2p@xmath3 below 6.4k , and ferromagnetic ndfe@xmath2p@xmath3 below 1.9k .",
    "an uranium analog ufe@xmath2p@xmath3 was also reported to be insulating.@xmath10 for a better understanding of these novel phenomena , high quality single crystals are essential .",
    "we have recently succeeded in growing high quality refe@xmath2p@xmath3 single crystals that realized the first de haas - van alphen ( dhva ) experiment.@xmath11 in this paper , we report the first experimental studies ( except for our preliminary report in the sces98 proceeding@xmath12 ) on the thermoelectric power and hall effect of refe@xmath2p@xmath3 single crystals along with the anomalous behaviors in the electrical resistivity .",
    "single crystals were grown by the tin - flux method,@xmath13 using 99.99% fe , la and pr , 99.9% nd , 99.9999% p and 99.999% sn .",
    "the samples for the transport measurements are basically the same as were used for the dhva measurements,@xmath11 and both measurements were made on exactly the same samples for some compounds .",
    "their dingle temperatures were estimated to be 0.3@xmath40.6k , which insures the samples of high quality . the high quality is also reflected in the large residual resistance ratio ( rrr ) of 1,300 and 1,000 for la- and nd - samples , respectively .",
    "the small rrr of @xmath413 for prfe@xmath2p@xmath3 at zero field does not indicate a low sample quality , since the fermi surface ( fs ) changes across @xmath14 .",
    "the intrinsic rrr of prfe@xmath2p@xmath3 was estimated to be @xmath41,000 from the resistivity at 0.3k in high fields above the metamagnetic transition .",
    "we found a meaningful correlation between the dhva amplitude and the rrr ; i.e. , the dhva oscillations could be detected only in large rrr samples .",
    "the electrical resistivity and hall resistivity were measured by the ordinary dc four - probe method .",
    "temperature was monitored by calibrated two @xmath15 and a platinum resistance thermometers depending on the temperature ranges between 0.5k and 295k .",
    "the calibration was made against a thin - film resistance temperature sensor ( cernox resistor , lake shore ) calibrated against the international temperature scale of 1990 ( its-90 ) . in a supplemental cryostat",
    "used only above 1.5k , a au-0.07%fe vs. chromel thermocouple was used as a temperature monitor .",
    "the thermoelectric power was measured by the differential method using au-0.07%fe vs. chromel thermocouples .",
    "the thermocouples were calibrated after every cooling down at the boiling point of @xmath16he in ambient pressure .",
    "the accuracy of temperature measurement is less than 0.1k at low temperatures , while it is a few k near room temperature ( rt ) .",
    "the voltage measurements were made by keithley 182 nanovoltmeters .",
    "the magnetic measurements were made by a quantum design squid magnetometer up to 5.5 t.",
    "the temperature dependence of electrical resistivity @xmath17 for lafe@xmath2p@xmath3 ( not shown ) almost agrees with the result in ref.2 except the orders of magnitude larger rrr in the present work .",
    "the superconducting transition temperature ( @xmath18 ) estimated from the midpoint of the resistive transition is 4.6k with a transition width of @xmath19t@xmath40.6k .",
    "the higher @xmath18 in the @xmath17 measurement is not attributable to the reported enhancement of @xmath18 with pressure in lafe@xmath2p@xmath3,@xmath20 since @xmath18 estimated from a squid measurement under almost the same sample condition is 4.17k in agreement with the previous report.@xmath9 the transition in @xmath17 may not be a bulk property , but is plausibly the surface superconductivity as is occasionally observed in rare earth superconductors . in fact , @xmath17 for lafe@xmath2p@xmath3 in ref.2 also shows a tendency to decrease at around 7k .",
    "below 25k , @xmath0 is well described by @xmath17 = @xmath21+a@xmath22 , with a@xmath23=(1.0@xmath240.1)@xmath25@xmath26cmk@xmath27 .",
    "the large a@xmath23 compared to the ordinary metals reflects a large contribution from the 3d - band of fe to the electronic density of states at the fermi level , as was already indicated in the large specific heat coefficient.@xmath28    figure  1 shows the temperature dependence of resistivity for prfe@xmath2p@xmath3 .",
    "the most remarkable difference in @xmath17 for prfe@xmath2p@xmath3 between the present work and ref.2 is the sign of d@xmath0/d@xmath29 above the neel temperature ( @xmath14 ) . in fig.1",
    ", @xmath17 increases almost logarithmically with decreasing temperature between 100k and 30k , in contrast with the monotonous decrease from rt down to @xmath14 in ref.2 .",
    "the absolute value of @xmath17 is slightly sample dependent in the present work due to irregular shapes of the samples .",
    "however , @xmath17s normalized at the peak for four samples from different batches lie almost on a single curve as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "the negative d@xmath0/d@xmath29 is reminiscent of the kondo effect that has been frequently observed in ce and u compounds . for pr - compounds ,",
    "prsn@xmath30 and prinag@xmath31@xmath32 are the quite rare examples exhibiting the kondo behaviors .",
    "a notable feature of prfe@xmath2p@xmath3 compared to these two compounds is a large magnitude of the logarithmic increase in @xmath17 .",
    "a large @xmath33 value ( @xmath341j / mol @xmath35 k@xmath9 ) reported at low temperatures in the high field paramagnetic state,@xmath36 indicating the existence of mass - enhanced electrons , is another sign of the kondo effect in prfe@xmath2p@xmath3 .",
    "if the logarithmic increase in @xmath17 is ascribed to the kondo scattering , the kondo temperature @xmath37 should be @xmath4100k .",
    "the @xmath37 value is in conflict with the weiss temperature ( @xmath38 ) of a few k that provides a measure of @xmath37 for heavy fermion compounds , though kondo scattering associated with higher crystal field levels could not be ruled out as an origin of such an enhancement of @xmath37 in @xmath17.@xmath39 the origin of the logarithmic increase in @xmath0 is an attractive subject for further investigations .    with decreasing temperature",
    ", @xmath0 shows a sharp upturn at 6.7k followed by a peak around 5.4k .",
    "the general features agree with the result in ref.2 , although the ratio rr=@xmath40/@xmath41=12@xmath420 in the present experiment shows a sharp contrast with rr@xmath421 in ref.2 .",
    "a notable feature in fig.1 is an abrupt change in slope of @xmath17 curves at @xmath42k , which was already found on one of the samples in ref .",
    "2 . a sudden increase in @xmath17 above 2k suggests some gap structure in the scattering probability . tentatively assuming a resistivity component with the form @xmath43=a@xmath44exp(-@xmath45 ) , @xmath46 @xmath17 below 3.2k is well reproduced by using @xmath47=6.8k as given in fig .",
    "this fact suggests that the scattering probability of conduction electrons reflects some gap structure , probably in the magnon dispersion relation , although the agreement of @xmath47=6.8k with @xmath14 may be accidental .",
    "it should be noted that a bend was observed near 2k also in the temperature dependence of specific heat coefficient.@xmath36    @xmath17 for ndfe@xmath2p@xmath3 is in agreement with that in ref . 2 except the low residual resistivity ( @xmath48 ) in the present experiment .",
    "figure  3 shows the low temperature part of @xmath17 for ndfe@xmath2p@xmath3 where d@xmath0/d@xmath29 is negative between @xmath44k and 30k .",
    "the negative d@xmath0/d@xmath29 developing below @xmath410@xmath49@xmath50 is quite unusual for ferromagnetic materials .",
    "the minimum should be intrinsic , since it has been reproducibly observed in samples with large rrr values . below a sharp drop at @xmath512k , the exponent @xmath52 in @xmath53 + a@xmath54",
    "is close to 4 as shown in the inset .",
    "the exponent , twice as large as @xmath52=2 expected for the simple magnon scattering , is well correlated with the @xmath55 dependence of specific heat reported in ref .",
    "2 ( in contrast with the @xmath56 dependence expected for simple ferromagnets ) . such large exponents for both the resistivity and specific heat could be consistently understood,@xmath57 if the magnon dispersion relation is @xmath58@xmath59@xmath60 rather than @xmath61 .",
    "figure  4 shows @xmath17 in cefe@xmath2p@xmath3 for four different samples .",
    "the resistivity change between rt and the lowest temperature in the present experiment is about five orders of magnitude smaller than that in ref .",
    "it should be noted again that dhva signals with large effective masses have been detected in la- , pr- and nd - fe@xmath2p@xmath3@xmath62 grown by the same procedure as described above , insuring the quality of the bulk part of the samples .",
    "we thus infer that the effect of impurity doping in the bulk part of samples might be less in the present work .",
    "taking into account these facts , some shortening effect by small size grains of sn inevitably embedded in the sample is the most probable origin for such difference in @xmath17 between the two works .",
    "we have tried to reduce the embedded sn grains by following two ways , ( 1 ) repeatedly slicing and etching a sample in acid to dissolve sn , and ( 2 ) selecting samples from different crystals from different batches . from the meissner diamagnetic contribution to the low field magnetic susceptibility",
    ", we have found the amount of sn varying from @xmath41 to less than 0.01-vol.% . however , despite the large variation in the sn content , only minor change in @xmath63=(@xmath64 was observed .",
    "note that a large sample - to - sample variation in the conducting behavior in cefe@xmath2p@xmath3 was already reported in refs . 3 and 18 ,",
    "although the @xmath17 curve was shown only for a single sample .",
    "it should be also noted that the resistivity at rt in the present work is slightly larger than that estimated in ref.21 .    the temperature dependence of @xmath0 in fig .",
    "4 indicates the existence of three characteristic temperature ranges ; i.e. , t@xmath34230k , 230k@xmath34t@xmath3450k and t@xmath4250k . the energy gap 1,250k estimated from the @xmath17 data above 250k is almost sample - independent .",
    "the value is close to the reported value of 1,500k in ref .",
    "3 which was estimated in the temperature range 85k@xmath42t@xmath42140k .",
    "these values are about 1/3 of the gap ( = 0.34ev ) estimated by the band structure calculation within the local - density approximation.@xmath65 taking into account the fact that a recent optical experiment also gives a smaller gap of 0.15ev,@xmath66 the disagreement may be ascribed to the local density approximation that tends to overestimate the band gaps.@xmath65 @xmath17 depends only slightly on temperature from 230k to @xmath450k below which it shows a sharp upturn .",
    "the upturn below 50k , which is hardly explainable if the shortening effect of metallic sn grains dominates the conduction , is probably an intrinsic behavior of @xmath17 . at this stage",
    ", we can not give any conclusive remark on the origin of the difference in @xmath17 behaviors in the two works .",
    "however , it might be worthwhile to report the first hall effect and thermoelectric power experiments on cefe@xmath2p@xmath3 , since the main characteristics are reproducible .",
    "figure  5 shows the temperature dependence of hall coefficient @xmath1 for ( a ) la- , pr- nd- fe@xmath2p@xmath3 and ( b ) cefe@xmath2p@xmath3 . at rt , @xmath1 is @xmath41.5@xmath67m@xmath68/c for both la- and nd - fe@xmath2p@xmath3 , and @xmath41.3@xmath67m@xmath68/c for prfe@xmath2p@xmath3 .",
    "the hall coefficient in magnetic system is usually expressed as a combination of the normal hall coefficient @xmath69 resulting from the lorentz motion of conduction electrons and the extraordinary one @xmath70 caused by magnetic scattering of conduction electrons ; @xmath71.@xmath72 the positive @xmath1 at rt , where @xmath69 dominates , is consistent with the band structure calculation for lafe@xmath2p@xmath3 predicting two hole - like fermi sheets.@xmath73 the weak temperature dependence of @xmath1 for lafe@xmath2p@xmath3 , including a peak at  25k , can be understood as due to the temperature dependence of the anisotropy in the relaxation time @xmath74.@xmath75 as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "5(a ) , the change in @xmath1 below @xmath14 for prfe@xmath2p@xmath3 is more than two orders of magnitude larger than that above @xmath14 , which also indicates a fs reconstruction associated with the antiferromagnetic superzone gap formation .",
    "@xmath76 becomes almost temperature independent below 2k , which also suggests some gap structure described above in correlation with the anomalies in @xmath17 and the specific heat.@xmath36    at temperatures higher than kondo temperature,@xmath77 @xmath70 in the dense kondo compounds has been well described by the skew scattering mechanism as @xmath78 , using the reduced magnetic susceptibility @xmath79 , the magnetic part of resistivity @xmath80 and a parameter @xmath81 depending on the phase shift associated with the kondo scattering . to test the model , @xmath1",
    "is compared with m@xmath82 calculated from the magnetization at 0.1 t and zero field resistivity for prfe@xmath2p@xmath3 as a function of temperature in fig .",
    "@xmath76 is qualitatively reproduced by the @xmath83 curves above @xmath14 .",
    "in contrast , the experimental curve for ndfe@xmath2p@xmath3 is hardly reproduced over the wide temperature range , even if the temperature dependence of @xmath69 is taken into account .",
    "this fact suggests that the skew scattering contribution is small at high temperatures .",
    "thus , the comparison between @xmath1 and @xmath83 is shown in fig .",
    "6 ( b ) only near @xmath50 , where the extraordinary hall resistivity @xmath84 is expected to become larger.@xmath65 the positive peak is well reproduced as a combined effect of growing m and decreasing @xmath0 below @xmath50 , though the peak for @xmath1 is broader and shifted to higher temperatures .",
    "the disagreement could be partly ascribed to the higher applied field of 1 t in the @xmath1 measurement .    for cefe@xmath2p@xmath3 , despite the clear difference in the @xmath17 curves , @xmath76s for the two different samples ( @xmath851 and @xmath852 ) are basically same including the absolute values , suggesting the overall feature of @xmath1 to be a bulk property .",
    "corresponding to the hump in @xmath17 , a change in the slope of @xmath76 exists around 220k . a notable feature in fig .",
    "5(b ) is a sharp drop of @xmath1 below a peak at @xmath425k in correlation with the low temperature upturn in @xmath17 .",
    "below rt , the sign is always positive , suggesting the higher mobility carriers in the top valence band . of course",
    ", the existence of acceptor type impurities could not be ruled out at this stage . assuming the single carrier model , the concentration of carriers is estimated to be 1@xmath25holes / f.u . at rt ,",
    "1@xmath86holes / f.u . at 25k",
    "( peak in @xmath1 ) and 4@xmath86holes / f.u . at 2k .    the combination of decreasing @xmath1 and increasing @xmath17 with decreasing t leads to a decrease of hall mobility below 25k based on the single carrier model as shown in fig .",
    "the hall mobility at rt is about an order of magnitude smaller than that in si.@xmath87 the decrease in hall mobility above @xmath4150k with increasing t follows @xmath88 dependence , suggesting the dominant acoustic phonon scattering as expected for ordinary semiconductors.@xmath87 note the apparent peak in the hall mobility observed around 65k .",
    "figure  8 ( a ) shows the temperature dependence of tep for la- , pr- , and nd - compounds .",
    "tep for lafe@xmath2p@xmath3 decreases with decreasing t from @xmath899@xmath5v / k at 290k , and changes its sign below 18k after showing a minimum near 200k and a maximum near 100k .",
    "the relatively large absolute value at rt compared to simple metals is ascribable to the large contribution from 3d band of fe at fermi surface.@xmath90 . a delicate combination of the diffusion and the phonon drag contributions might lead to such a complex t - dependence .",
    "tep for ndfe@xmath2p@xmath3 is almost indistinguishable with that of lafe@xmath2p@xmath3 above 220k , suggesting a localized nature of 4f - electrons in this system . at lower temperatures",
    ", tep deviates from that for lafe@xmath2p@xmath3 downward and changes its sign at around 85k . at the lowest temperature , it approaches to zero after showing a minimum of @xmath415@xmath5v / k which is quite large as a localized f - electron material .",
    "the coincidence of the minimum temperature ( @xmath430k ) with that for the @xmath17-minimum suggests that these minima originate from the same conduction - electron scattering with a characteristic energy scale of @xmath430k .",
    "tep for prfe@xmath2p@xmath3 shows largely different behaviors . even at 290k ,",
    "the magnitude is about twice as large as that in lafe@xmath2p@xmath3 , and decreases with decreasing t. below a sign change near 70k , it drastically decreases with t , showing a bend near @xmath14 . after exhibiting a large minimum near 3k ,",
    "it approaches to 0@xmath5v / k at the lowest temperature .",
    "the sharp drop below @xmath14 could be ascribed to the fs reconstruction . however",
    ", the large magnitude ( @xmath450@xmath5v / k ) above @xmath14 is quite unusual .",
    "the diffusion thermoelectric power is represented by an energy derivative of conductivity @xmath91",
    "as,@xmath92    @xmath93 .",
    "the origins of energy dependence of @xmath91 could be further classified into two factors ; carrier numbers and scattering probability . in the high mobility semiconductors where the former factor is huge",
    ", a large value of tep could be expected at low temperatures .",
    "it is not applicable to prfe@xmath2p@xmath3 , since we already know the existence of rather large fs in prfe@xmath2p@xmath3 from the dhva experiments.@xmath94 even in the transition metals and alloys with a large electronic density of states near fermi energy , a large diffusion tep has been reported only at high temperatures.@xmath95 in fact , this is the case for tep in lafe@xmath2p@xmath3 .",
    "such a large magnitude of tep in metals with a large fs has been reported only for the kondo systems where a large energy dependent scattering process is essential.@xmath96 if we assume 4f electrons to be well localized in prfe@xmath2p@xmath3 , the difference compared to the la - and nd- compounds should be ascribed only to the electron scattering by the localized 4f - electrons .",
    "then , we can hardly expect such a large magnitude of tep at low temperatures and a difference in tep at rt compared to lafe@xmath2p@xmath3 .",
    "the small sample size could lead to a large error in tep , however , we confirmed the contribution to be minor in the present case from independent measurements on different samples .    figure 8(b ) shows the t - dependence of tep for cefe@xmath2p@xmath3 , where the huge value of tep should be noted . at around 65k , tep exhibits a broad peak of @xmath40.76mv / k and sharply decreases below 50k where @xmath17 shows an apparent increase after a plateau .",
    "the temperature dependence is weak above 100k , except a small but an apparent anomaly at @xmath4220k .",
    "the positive sign of tep as well as @xmath1 at high temperatures is consistent with the band structure calculation.@xmath66 the top valence bands are dominated by the hybridized fe-3d and p-3p states with a moderate dispersion , while the lowest conduction bands are dominated by the narrow spin - orbit split ce-4f bands .",
    "namely , the effective mass for the electrons in the 4f - dominated bands is apparently heavier than that for the holes in the valence bands , which leads to the positive tep and @xmath1 in the intrinsic regime .",
    "all the transport properties of cefe@xmath2p@xmath3 show unusual temperature dependence below rt ; the complex temperature dependence of resistivity unexpected for a simple single gap semiconductor , the huge thermoelectric power above @xmath410k with a maximum value of 0.76mv / k , the sharp decrease of both tep and the carrier mobility below a peak around 65k .",
    "all these features might be related with the 4f - electron hybridization associated with the filled skutterudite structure as was already pointed out based on the electrical resistivity and optical measurements .",
    "the most remarkable finding was made on prfe@xmath2p@xmath3 .",
    "all the transport properties @xmath17 , @xmath76 and @xmath97 indicates a strong possibility of kondo - like scattering .",
    "ordinary magnetic kondo effect may not be its origin . in order to clarify the origin ,",
    "further investigations such as neutron scattering and ultrasonic experiments are in progress .",
    "the negative d@xmath0/d@xmath29 above @xmath50 in ndfe@xmath2p@xmath3 has a magnetic origin , which might be related with an unusual dispersion of the magnon spectrum inferred from the temperature dependence of the resistivity and the specific heat below @xmath50 .",
