    "information can be stored on various physical media , ranging from modern compact disks to ancient papyrus .",
    "a fundamental goal of information storage is to preserve it for the longest possible time in a reliable way .",
    "that obviously depends on the used technology .",
    "however , even if we have achieved a perfect or ideal implementation of a given technology , we should realize that there are limitations on preserving information .",
    "these limitations are posed by physical theories and ultimately result from the evolution of the universe itself , which can cause unavoidable effects to any physical system .    to address the issue of determining these fundamental limits",
    ", we require the theory of general relativity as well as that of quantum information .",
    "very recently the interconnections between these two fields have received increased interest .",
    "several previous works have developed a theory of communication between a sender and a receiver in relativistic settings @xcite or in situations involving black holes @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate how well information stored in the remote past is preserved when going to the far future , by assuming evolution of the universe in a robertson - walker ( rw ) spacetime .",
    "our main results are 1 ) that the noise imparted to spin-@xmath0 particles by the evolution of the universe is equivalent to an amplitude damping channel , and so we then 2 ) determine achievable rates for the simultaneous communication of classical and quantum information over this channel . as a result",
    ", we can interpret these rates to be achievable rates for the storage of classical and quantum information from the early past to the far future in a robertson - walker spacetime .",
    "the rw spacetimes are a reasonable description of the dynamics of the late universe , which , at large scale , appear to be homogeneous and isotropic .",
    "most cosmological models are special cases of rw spacetimes @xcite .",
    "when considering a quantum matter field evolving through a dynamical spacetime , the concept of the vacuum can not be considered unique any longer . indeed , to detect the presence of quanta it is also necessary to specify the details of the quantum measurement process , and in particular , the state of motion of the measuring device .",
    "particles possess an essential observer - dependent quality , so that they can be observed on some detectors and not others .",
    "also , we can define positive and negative energy solutions of differential equations governing matter fields only if the spacetime structure is invariant under the action of a time - like killing vector field @xcite .",
    "this is certainly true for minkowski spacetime , and a rw universe which is minkowskian in the early past and in the far future is a suitable choice .",
    "the simplest , nevertheless insightful , choice we can make is a 1 + 1 rw spacetime .",
    "there , we can consider any quantum state of the matter field before the expansion of the universe begins and define , without ambiguity , its particle content .",
    "we then let the universe expand and check how the state looks once the expansion is over .",
    "the overall picture can be thought of as a noisy channel into which some quantum state is fed .",
    "once we have defined the quantum channel emerging from the physical model , we will be looking at the usual communication task as information transmission over the channel .",
    "since we are interested in the preservation of any kind of information , we shall consider the trade - off between the different resources of classical and quantum information .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we discuss the physical model and show how the noise imparted to spin-@xmath0 particles is equivalent to an amplitude damping channel , which has been well studied in quantum information theory @xcite . in the section",
    "thereafter , we calculate achievable rates for the simultaneous communication of classical and quantum information over this channel .",
    "we then conclude with a summary of our results and a discussion of some open questions . appendixes",
    "a and b are devoted to prove the main results .",
    "there we also determine a trade - off between achievable rates of classical and quantum information preservation when entanglement assistance is available , which might be useful for applications beyond the physical setting studied in this paper .",
    "the geometry of a rw spacetime , considered here for the sake of simplicity of 1 + 1 dimensions , is described by the line element @xmath1^{2}(-d\\tau^{2}+dx^{2}),\\ ] ] which represents the varying distance between two spacetime points , depending on the conformal scale factor @xmath2 .",

    "in fact , in order to save energy , one would like to have the momentum @xmath27 as low as possible .",
    "however , it is unreasonable to freeze particles such that @xmath92 .",
    "hence , we have to face up with the problem of non - negligible information damping , and this motivates us to consider the best strategy for preserving it .    in particular",
    ", we would like to preserve both classical and quantum information in the rw spacetime , and so we consider trade - off strategies for doing so @xcite , modeling the noise as an amplitude damping channel ( as motivated in the previous section ) .",
    "to do so , we can model this problem in a communication - theoretic language , in which we say that the device encoding information at the beginning of the evolution is the `` sender '' and the device recovering information at the end of the evolution is the `` receiver . ''",
    "a simple strategy for trading between classical and quantum communication is known as _ time sharing_in a time - sharing strategy , the sender and receiver use a classical communication code for a fraction of the channel uses , a quantum communication code for another fraction , etc . for some channels such as the quantum erasure channel @xcite , time sharing is an optimal communication strategy , but in general , it can not outperform a more general strategy known as `` trade - off coding '' @xcite .",
    "this allows for transmitting classical and quantum information at net rates @xmath93 that lie in a two - dimensional capacity region .    to proceed with our development for the amplitude damping channel , we begin by recalling that the trade - off region between classical and quantum communication ( without the help of entanglement assistance ) for any quantum channel @xmath94  is given by @xcite : @xmath95 where @xmath96 , @xmath97 , and @xmath98 denote the quantum mutual information , coherent information , and holevo information of a quantum state @xmath99 , respectively , with the von neumann entropies defined as @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 , etc .",

    "we should clarify that the above rate region is an achievable rate region , and for some channels , it is known to be optimal as well @xcite .",
    "the above rate region is not known to be optimal for the amplitude damping channel .    for the amplitude damping channel @xmath64 , and hence for the channel ( [ kraus - rep ] ) , we have the following characterization of the single - letter trade - off region :    [ theo1 ] the single - letter trade - off region ( [ eq : double-1])-([eq : double-2 ] ) for the qubit amplitude damping channel is the union of the following polyhedra over all @xmath107 $ ] for @xmath108 and where @xmath109 and @xmath110 : @xmath111 , \\nonumber\\\\ c+q &   \\leq   h_{2}\\left (   \\eta p\\right )   -\\sum_{x\\in\\{0,1\\ } } p_x   \\ , { \\sf g}\\left (   q_x,1-\\eta,\\nu_x\\right ) .",

    "in this paper , we have investigated how well information stored in the remote past is preserved when going to the far future , by assuming evolution of the universe in a robertson - walker spacetime .",
    "we proved , under certain assumptions , that the noise imparted to spin-@xmath0 particles by the evolution of the universe is equivalent to an amplitude damping channel , and we then determined achievable rates for the simultaneous communication of classical and quantum information over this channel .",

    "nevertheless ( remembering that it suffices to consider two letters ) if we take two arbitrary points @xmath203 and @xmath204 in the @xmath205 plane and suppose w.l.g . that @xmath206 , we have @xmath207 hence @xmath208 however , by the concavity of @xmath176 with respect to @xmath177 we can further write @xmath209 so this proves ( [ eq:29 ] ) for this case .",
