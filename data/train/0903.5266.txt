    "gaussian random matrix ensembles ( rmes ) were proposed by wigner about half a century ago to describe the statistical properties of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of complex many - body quantum systems in which the hamiltonians are considered only in a probabilistic way @xcite . over the past several decades , they proved to be a very useful tool in the studies of equilibrium and transport properties of disordered quantum systems , classically chaotic systems with a few degrees of freedom , two - dimensional gravity , conformal field theory and chiral phase transition in quantum chromodynamics @xcite .",
    "this wide applicability results from certain universal properties of the correlation of the eigenvalues known as the wigner distributions , as opposed to the poisson distributions that result from random sets of eigenvalues .",
    "more recently , attempts have been made to construct generalized ensembles that show a crossover from a wigner to a poisson distribution as a function of a parameter , as seen in many physical systems @xcite .",
    "one such generalization is the family of ` q - random matrix ensembles ' ( q - rmes ) @xcite .",
    "these were later shown to be models of ` critical ensembles ' , with statistical properties different from the gaussian rmes and relevant for systems near a metal - insulator transition @xcite . while there are other models that also describe critical statistics @xcite , one advantage of the q - rmes",
    "is that they are rotationally invariant , and therefore can be analytically studied in great detail by the powerful method of orthogonal polynomials @xcite . in particular ,",
    "the differences between the gaussian and the critical rmes can be traced to the differences in the asymptotic properties of the classical vs. q - orthogonal polynomials @xcite , illustrating how the universality of the gaussian rmes breaks down and gives rise to a different kind of universality for the critical ensembles .    in this work ,",
    "we take the generalization one step further to include ` lvy like ' ensembles .",
    "lvy ensembles were introduced by cizeau and bouchaud ( cb ) @xcite where the matrix elements are drawn from a power law distribution according to @xmath5 .",
    "such matrices with a broad distribution of matrix elements have been studied in the context of a wide variety of systems including financial markets , earthquakes , scale free networks , communication systems etc . as well as quantum chaotic systems such as the coulomb billiard and kicked rotor with singularities @xcite .",
    "the statistical properties of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of such matrices are , in general , quite different from the universal properties of the gaussian or the critical ensembles .",
    "indeed , it has been argued @xcite that matrices of the lvy type are relevant for describing localization transition of interacting electrons in infinite dimensions .",
    "in particular , while the eigenvectors of the gaussian rmes are all extended , the lvy type matrices contain signatures of mobility edges , separating localized states from extended states within the spectrum .    however , the cb model is very difficult to study because it is not rotationally invariant .",
    "while eigenvalue densities for certain lvy ensembles have been obtained analytically @xcite , little progress has been made in any systematic study of the eigenvalue _ correlations _ where novel universal features can be expected . in the present work we will consider `",
    "lvy like ' ensembles , characterized by a power law eigenvalue density @xmath6 , without specifying whether such a density arises from a distribution of the matrix elements as in the cb model . for this purpose",
    ", we introduce a rotationally invariant model characterized by a parameter @xmath0 .",
    "we show that @xmath1 corresponds to a critical ensemble , while @xmath3 and @xmath4 describe lvy like ensembles with bounded and unbounded ( long tail ) densities , respectively . in particular",
    "the model allows us to calculate the two - level kernel for lvy like ensembles , from which all correlations can be evaluated , in terms of a novel family of orthogonal polynomials .",
    "these correlations turn out to be qualitatively different from either the gaussian or the critical ensembles .",
    "consider the set of all @xmath7 hermitian matrices @xmath8 ( we will restrict ourselves to the unitary ensembles only ) randomly chosen with the following probability measure @xmath9 dm , $ ] where @xmath10 is a suitably increasing function of @xmath11 , @xmath12 is the matrix trace and @xmath13 the haar measure . by going over to the eigenvalues - eigenvectors representation , it can be shown that the joint probability distribution of the eigenvalues @xmath14 of the matrices can then be written in the form @xcite @xmath15 here the factor @xmath16 arises from the jacobian of a change of variables .",
    "the level correlations can be determined exactly by recognizing that the distribution can be written as a product of vandermonde determinants of a set of ( monic ) polynomials @xmath17 that are orthogonal with respect to the weight function @xmath18 @xcite , i.e. @xmath19 the main quantity of interest is the large n limit of the two - level kernel @xmath20 from which all correlation functions can be obtained .",
    "the gaussian rmes follow when one chooses the ` confinement potential ' @xmath21 that defines the hermite polynomials .",
    "since all ` freud - type ' weight functions @xmath22 , with monotonically increasing _ polynomial _ @xmath10 , lead to orthogonal polynomials with qualitatively similar asymptotic behavior in the large @xmath23 limit , they all share the same correlations as the gaussian rems .",
    "this is at the root of the wide applicability of the gaussian rmes . on the other hand ,",
    "q - rmes follow when one chooses @xmath24 for large @xmath11 @xcite , which leads to the q - polynomials .",
    "all q - polynomials have similar large @xmath23 asymptotic behavior , which differ qualitatively from those of the freud like classical polynomials .",
    "thus all q - rmes characterized by different q - polynomials share the same correlation properties as those of the critical ensembles , which are different from those of the gaussian ensembles .",
    "it turns out that all q - rmes have density of eigenvalues falling off as @xmath25 @xcite . comparing this with the fact that lvy - like ensembles have density falling off as @xmath6",
    ", this suggests that we consider a generalization of the q - rme model where the asymptotic @xmath26 behavior of the potential is extended to include other powers of the logarithm .",
    "we therefore introduce a one parameter generailzation of the q - rmes characterized by @xmath27^{1+\\lambda } ; \\;\\;\\ ; \\lambda > 0 ; \\;\\;\\ ; q<1.\\ ] ] for @xmath0 = 1 , this is a model for critical ensembles @xcite , defined by the ismail - masson q - polynomials @xcite .",
    "since the asymptotic behavior of the potential is @xmath28 , any @xmath2 is qualitatively different from a q - ensemble .",
    "however , there is no direct way to obtain orthogonal polynomials for any arbitrary non - trivial weight function . in particular , the orthogonal polynomials corresponding to @xmath2 are not known , and we can not write down the two - level kernel ( eq .",
    "3 ) directly .",
    "we therefore follow an indirect but systematic method @xcite that allows us to obtain the polynomials recursively for any given potential .",
    "it is well known that every orthogonal system of real valued polynomials satisfy a three term recursion relation @xcite @xmath29 following ref [ 15 ] , we define a set of integrals @xmath30 which in turn satisfy the recursion relation @xmath31 thus , the determination of the coefficients @xmath32 and @xmath33 necessary to calculate the polynomials of degree @xmath34 requires only the knowledge of the @xmath35 integrals @xmath36 for @xmath37 .     as a function of @xmath38 for different values of @xmath0 .",
    "solid line corresponds to the critical ensemble @xmath1 , which separates two qualitatively distinct classes @xmath39 and @xmath4 . ]",
    "we first note that for the present model , because we choose the potential to be symmetric , all @xmath40 .",
    "therefore , @xmath32 completely determines the polynomials . for simplicity",
    ", we will use a fixed value of the parameter @xmath41 except in figure  [ alpha ] where we also show results for @xmath42 .",
    "figure  [ rn ] shows the @xmath38-dependence of @xmath32 for different values of @xmath0 obtained by evaluating the @xmath36 numerically . for all @xmath0 , the large @xmath38 behavior of @xmath32",
    "has the form @xmath43 in contrast , for all freud like classical orthogonal polynomials , @xmath44 .",
    "figure  [ alpha ] shows the @xmath0 dependence of the exponent @xmath45 .     as a function of @xmath0 for two different values of @xmath46 .",
    "@xmath1 corresponds to the q - polynomials describing the critical ensembles . ]    for @xmath1 , @xmath47 , which recovers the known recursion relation is @xmath48 , see @xcite . ] for the q - orthogonal polynomials . on the other hand for @xmath39 , @xmath49 , while for @xmath4 , @xmath50 .",
    "note that the distribution of the zeros of the polynomials are determined by the exponent @xmath45 , such that when @xmath51 , the logarithm of the zeros of the corresponding ismail - masson q - polynomials are uniformly distributed . for @xmath52",
    "the zeros are ` bunched together ' while for @xmath53 they are ` unbunched ' , highlighting their differences from the q - polynomials .",
    "thus , @xmath2 defines a novel family of orthogonal polynomials that generalizes the q - polynomials .",
    "however , the asymptotic properties of these ` generalized q - polynomials ' are not known .",
    "the density of eigenvalues @xmath54 can now be obtained for different values of @xmath0 from eq .  3 by summing the products numerically .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ density ] .    .",
    "@xmath1 is the critical ensemble . for @xmath39 ,",
    "the density has a sharp edge , while for @xmath55 there is a true ` levy - like ' long tail . ]",
    "as already known , the density for @xmath1 falls off as @xmath25 . for @xmath2 ,",
    "the density falls off as @xmath56 , as expected for lvy - like ensembles .",
    "however , for @xmath39 , @xmath57 and the density falls off slower than @xmath25 ; the normalization condition ( that there are @xmath23 eigenvalues in total for a matrix of size @xmath23 ) then forces the density to have a sharp edge , similar to the edge of the semicircular density of the gaussian rmes .",
    "thus , even though all @xmath2 have power law densities , the long tail characteristic of a lvy ensemble is cut off for @xmath3 by a sharp edge .",
    "for @xmath4 , @xmath58 and the density has true power law tails .",
    "it should be noted that nonextensive ensembles @xcite characterized by one parameter @xmath59 also show a similar power - law behavior ; for @xmath60 , the distributions of eigenvalue density show true long tails and for @xmath61 , the distributions have compact support .",
    "however , the parameter @xmath59 in this case depends on the dimensionality n of the ensemble such that in the large @xmath23 limit where universal behavior is expected , the maximum @xmath59 allowed for the nonextensive ensembles approaches unity .",
    "our results now allow us to obtain exact correlations for lvy like ensembles . using eq .  3 for the two - level kernel we calculate the ` unfolded ' cluster function @xmath62 where the variable @xmath63 is such that the density is uniform and unity : @xmath64 .",
    "it is only in this rescaled variable @xmath63 that the universality of a given ensemble is revealed if it exists .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ cluster ] .",
    "note that cluster functions for @xmath39 are intermediate between the gaussian ( @xmath65 ) and the critical ( @xmath66 ) ensmbles @xmath67 ^ 2 ; \\;\\;\\ ; y^{c}=\\left[\\frac{\\gamma}{2\\pi}\\frac{\\sin(\\pi r)}{\\sinh [ ( \\gamma/2)r]}\\right]^2;\\ ] ] but for @xmath4 it is qualitatively different , with peak positions of the lobes shifting towards smaller @xmath63 values with decreasing @xmath0 .",
    "this suggests that @xmath68 consists of a more general @xmath0-dependent argument as well as power of the @xmath69 function that reduces to @xmath66 in the limit @xmath1 .",
    "note that our results are limited to finite system size n only , which makes any attempt to obtain the true asymptotic behavior of @xmath68 unreliable .",
    "nevertheless , with sufficiently large n , we can clearly demonstrate that the correlation functions obtained from @xmath68 for @xmath70 are qualitatively different from both the gaussian and the critical ensembles .     for lvy - like ensembles for different values of @xmath0 .",
    "the dotted and the solid lines agree with the known results for the gaussian and the critical ensemble ( with @xmath71 ) , respectively . ]    as an example of the correlation functions obtained from the cluster function , we evaluated the number variance @xmath72 within a range @xmath73 shown in figure  [ variance ] . for @xmath74",
    ", the number variance tends to that of the gaussian rmes , as expected , due to the absence of long tails . on the other hand for @xmath4 , the number variance shifts towards the uncorrelated poisson distribution . for @xmath4 , @xmath72 for large",
    "@xmath73 seems linear in @xmath73 , as it is for the critical as well as poisson cases , although the slope depends on @xmath0 in a nontrivial manner .",
    "we have also evaluated the gap function which , for critical ensembles , falls off slower compared to the gaussian rmes .",
    "we find that for @xmath39 the gap function is in between the critical and the gaussian rmes , while for @xmath4 it falls off slower than the critical ensemble .",
    "again , finite system size prevents us from obtaining a reliable @xmath0 dependence of the asymptotic behavior .",
    "determination of the true asymptotic behavior of these correlation functions will require knowledge of the asymptotic properties of the novel orthogonal polynomials introduced here .     for lvy like ensembles for different values of @xmath0 ]",
    "in summary , we have introduced a rotationally invariant model of random matrix ensembles by defining a confinement potential @xmath10 that includes a parameter @xmath0 .",
    "we obtained the orthogonal polynomials associated with the weight function @xmath18 for different values of @xmath0 by using a recursive method . for @xmath1",
    ", we recover the well known q - polynomials that describe the critical ensemble , with eigenvalue density @xmath76 . for @xmath2",
    ", we obtain a novel family of ` generalized q - polynomials ' . while @xmath77 for all @xmath2 , only @xmath4 correspond to lvy like ensembles with true long tails .",
    "we use the generalized q - polynomials ( for finite n ) to evaluate the two - level kernel from which all eigenvalue correlations can be obtained .",
    "we find that for @xmath2 , the correlations are of novel types , differing from both the gaussian and the critical ensembles .",
    "clearly , studies of the asymptotic properties of the generalized q - polynomials introduced above would be very useful in better understanding the properties of lvy like ensembles .",
    "although we have considered only the variation with respect to the parameter @xmath0 , the model has another parameter , @xmath59 , which we kept fixed .",
    "we have confirmed that the two parameters are independent , so that a single effective parameter can not describe the separate dependence of the two parameters .",
    "it would be important to find out if the q - parameter can describe e.g. any `` transition '' within the lvy like ensembles , as argued in ref . @xcite .",
    "while the mobility edge or the localization transition has clear meaning in the context of electron transport in disordered systems , it would be very interesting if it exists in lvy like ensembles , in the context of complex systems like earthquakes and scale - free networks .",
