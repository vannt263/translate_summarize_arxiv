    "recent studies have revealed that our understanding of the mechanism of type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) is poorer than we had thought .",
    "it is suspected that there are two different progenitor types responsible for sne ia : explosions from old systems as in the long - accepted scenario and explosions in young stellar systems @xcite .",
    "the evidence , however , is not conclusive yet , and some observations at high redshift do not fit this picture ; for example , there are indications for a drop in the sn rate at @xmath5 , where star formation rate is still rising @xcite , which does not support the presence of a large prompt component .    the present paper studies the luminosity functions ( lf ) of sne ia and their host galaxies and correlations in properties of sn ia and of host galaxies .",
    "@xcite and @xcite studied the lf of various types of sne based on the asiago supernova catalog @xcite .",
    "in particular , @xcite showed that the lf of sne ia is consistent with the gaussian distribution with @xmath6 and @xmath7 using 111 spectroscopically normal sne ia without correcting for the light curve shape parameter . with the correction for the decline rate @xmath8",
    "can be reduced to 0.11 @xcite .",
    "we are not aware of a study of the lf of sne ia host galaxies .",
    "we may hope that a comparison with the lf of field galaxies may hint us as to what type of galaxies would preferentially host sne ia .",
    "we have accumulated a sample of sne ia acquired in the second phase of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ?",
    "supernovae were searched during september to november of 2005 to 2007 by repeated imaging for the sky area of 300 square degree of the southern equatorial region , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , every two days @xcite .",
    "approximately 500 sne ia at @xmath11 were identified using well - defined selection criteria and their light curves were measured @xcite .",
    "the advantage of the use of the sdss is , apart from its accurate five colour photometry @xcite , that most of the galaxies that host supernovae have already been photometrically observed with homogeneous presetted criteria , so that one can study the properties of those galaxies and correlations between the supernovae and their host galaxies .",
    "the disadvantage is that the sdss is somewhat too shallow for this purpose due to a limitation arising from the time - delay - and - integrate mode imaging with the 2.5 m aperture telescope @xcite .",
    "the sn candidates are spectroscopically followed - up with other telescopes as much as the time allows to determine their types and redshifts @xcite . after the sn light faded away spectroscopic observations",
    "are carried out for its host galaxy to detremine redshift of the sn ia candidate . in this paper",
    "we use the data from the first year for the completeness is high for redshift of host galaxies for the first year sne .",
    "we limit the sample effectively to @xmath12 for the sample completeness .",
    "five colour photometry had been made for host galaxies .",
    "a @xmath13 galaxy at @xmath14 would give @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , so that we can sustain reasonable accuracy in sdss photometry for the four passbands @xcite .",
    "for the @xmath19 passband , however , a @xmath13 galaxy at @xmath14 gives @xmath20 , which is significantly beyond our survey limit @xmath21 , a calibre of our survey with a 2.5-m telescope , and hence , the @xmath19 passband information can not efficiently be exploited .    in this paper , we take @xmath22 km s@xmath23 mpc@xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 for the cosmological parameters .",
    "in the 2005 sdss - ii observation , 706 sne ia candidates were identified including objects with observations at only a few epochs and 130 sne ia among them are spectroscopically confirmed with additional 16 identified as spectroscopically probable sne ia .",
    "the latter are the objects whose spectrum do not show significant si ii absorption - line feature while the overall spectra match with the ia templet .",
    "follow - up observations were not complete due to the time limitation while sne candidates would be observable . we are left with the candidates whose light curves indicate sne ia but were not spectroscopically confirmed . our experience with",
    "the spectroscopically confirmed sample tells us that spectroscopic failure rate to confirm sne ia is only 10% of the light - curve selected candidates @xcite .",
    "this significant failure rate , however , applies to loosely selected candidates raised for spectroscopic follow - up that use light curves only in early days from the first detection , and it is substantially reduced for tightly light - curve selected sn ia candidates , such as those used in this paper . a contamination of a few misidentified sne ia out of a hundred , if any , would not spoil global statistical analyses , such as those presented in this paper , beyond our statistical errors .",
    "host galaxies of those candidates were spectroscopically observed later and their redshifts were measured .",
    "we refer to these cases as ` host-@xmath26 measured sne ia ' .",
    "there are 168 objects in this category , which make our total sample to comprise 314 sne ia with known redshift .    for the supernova sample , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29-band light curves",
    "are measured by fitting images with a model of the galaxy background and the sn point spread function without pixel re - sampling frame by frame ( scene - modeling photometry ) @xcite .",
    "these sn multi - band photometric data are fit simultaneously by the salt2 light curve fitter @xcite to derive photometric parameters .",
    "some sne ia in our sample are not suitable for detailed analysis : for sne ia discovered in the early or late phase of the observing season , i.e. , early september and late november , light curves are observed only partially , with which it is often difficult to determine the accurate light curve shape and hence peak brightness .",
    "some sne ia are faint and their signal - to - noise ratio at peak brightness is too low due to their large distances .",
    "we set the following criteria , as were done by @xcite , for the secure acquisition of light curves : ( i ) at least one measurement with @xmath30 days ; ( ii ) at least one measurement with @xmath31 days ; ( iii ) at least five measurements with @xmath32 days ; ( iv ) at least one measurement with signal - to - noise ratio above 5 for each of @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 ; ( v ) reasonable light curve fit whose reduced @xmath33 calculated by salt2 is less than 3 for probable and host-@xmath26 sne . for spectroscopically confirmed sne ia , the @xmath33 criteria was not applied . here",

    "the known peculiar sne ia , sn2005gj @xcite and sn2005hk @xcite are rejected here .",
    "we limit the sky area to @xmath36 and @xmath37 and the time coverage to @xmath38 ( 13 september 2005 ) @xmath39 ( 11 november 2005 ) to avoid the edge effects .",

    "this figure shows that our sample is likely complete to @xmath47 .",
    "the sample incompleteness at higher redshift is caused mainly by spectroscopic targetting and is given by fitting the ratio of observed number of sne in our basic sn ia sample to the simulated number as seen in figure [ fig : completeness ] : @xmath48 where the best fit values are @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "for each sn ia the nearest primary object that resides within 10 arcsec from the sn is identified as its host galaxy in catalog archive server of sdss data release 6 ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) , with the identification visually confirmed .",

    "figure [ fig : hrhist ] shows the apparent @xmath28-band petrosian magnitude distribution of host galaxies for 207 sne ia before the magnitude cutoff with the dotted histogram .",
    "the solid histogram is the host galaxies for our magnitude limit sample .",
    "there are 9 sne whose host galaxies are not identified in the basic sample of 207 sne ( 8 sne in the 137 magnitude limit sample ) within @xmath51 arcsec from a sn .",
    "these hostless sne ia are listed in table [ tbl : hostless ] , which gives the upper limit on absolute brightness of host galaxies searched in our survey to be @xmath52 for the apparent magnitude limit of @xmath53 mag .",

    "redshifts are fixed to the spectroscopic values .",
    "the light curves of sne are fit by the salt2 @xcite , which yields apparent maximum brightness in the rest - frame @xmath35-passband , @xmath55 , together with the parameter describing the spectral variation @xmath56 and the optical depth representing the colour excess at maximum brightness @xmath57 .",
    "the parameter @xmath56 is the weight of the next leading component of the spectral templet and is related to the light curve shape parameter @xmath58 ( phillips 1993 ) , as @xmath59 @xcite .",
    "salt2 corrects for galactic extinction following the extinction map of @xcite .",
    "we apply the @xmath54 method to calculate lfs of sne ia ( and of their host galaxies ) to the magnitude limit sample of 137 sne whose maximum brightness is brighter than 21.5 mag in the @xmath28-passband in the observed frame , by calculating the maximum redshift , @xmath60 , at which each sne ia ( or their host galaxies ) can be observed within the magnitude limit . since the multicolour passband",
    "light curve fit by salt2 gives us the spectral energy distribution of sn ia , characterised with the shape parameter and the colour excess parameter , we can calculate expected apparent brightness in the @xmath28-passband in the observed frame at various redshifts using this spectral energy distribution .",
    "the limiting redshift gives the maximum volume that can be surveyed , @xmath61 , as    @xmath62    where @xmath63 is the solid angle @xmath64 , and the index @xmath29 refers to sne ia . since @xmath65 is regarded as the volume surveyed to find @xmath29-th sne , the lf is obtained by summing the inverse of @xmath66 within specified magnitude bins ( @xmath67 ) assuming that the lf is not evolving over the respective redshift range .",
    "taking into account the effect of visibility time and spectroscopic incompleteness , the lf is calculated as    @xmath68    where @xmath69 is the time of visibility in the rest - frame at which each sn ia is observed .",
    "if the sn would be observed just at one epoch , as was done in a number of observations to derive the sn rate , the visibility time will be a time span over which each sne can be detected above the detection limit : in this case a fainter sne would have a shorter visibility time . in our case , however , observations have been made for the same field of sky continuously with the magnitude limit set for peak brightness .",
    "the visibility time will then be a time span of the survey observation . from the criteria on the date of maximum brightness",

    "we describe in appendix simulations we made to show that sample incompleteness and our corrections do not induce particular systematic errors to our analysis and our procedures allow us to recover the true lf , sn rate and related quantities .",
    "to estimate the intrinsic brightness of sne ia , we must correct for dust extinction within host galaxies . in fact , sne ia show the variation in colour that could be attributed to dust extinction within host galaxies and/or interpreted as an intrinsic colour variation .",
    "the colour information is obtained from the colour excess parameter @xmath57 of salt2 , which is defined by @xmath76 at @xmath35-passband maximum brightness , where the second term is colour of the sn ia templet .",
    "figure [ fig : ebvhist ] shows the distribution of this colour excess @xmath77 .",
    "the distribution is asymmetric with respect to @xmath78 , similar to that of the snls sample @xcite .",
    "if we assume the color distribution as an exponential distribution @xmath79 smeared by intrinsic gaussian color distribution with the dispersion of @xmath8 , the observed distribution can be fitted with @xmath80 and @xmath81 as in figure [ fig : ebvhist ] .",

    "if they would be removed the mean and dispersion will become @xmath87 .",
    "one may suspect that our sample may lack highly extinct or very red sne due to selection effects .",
    "it is unlikely , however , that we dropped such sne at least at lower @xmath26 where sne are surveyed deep enough to reach brightness significantly fainter than are dimmed by extinction , unless @xmath88 which are dropped as our selection procedure for the sn ia sample .",
    "the fact that the distribution does not change appreciably from low @xmath26 to our redshift limit indicates that the decline of the event rate that give @xmath89 is not due to the selection effect and sne that give a larger @xmath86 is missing .",
    "the distribution of @xmath86 corresponds , if interpreted as extinction , to extinction in the @xmath90 passband ranging from @xmath91 mag to @xmath92 mag for one sigma , if @xmath93 is assumed .",
    "the range of positive numbers is consistent with what is expected from extinction in the galactic discs with the hi column density @xmath94 @xmath95 @xcite , which is a typical value for disc galaxies unless they are edge - on .",
    "extinction may also receive a contribution from sn itself and its environment .",
    "we come back to this problem in the end of the next section .",
    "figure [ fig : av ] shows the distributions of @xmath96 for the sne ia sample , taking the colour variation as reddening and assuming @xmath93 .",
    "note that above @xmath97 sne ia candidates , if any , are rejected during sn identification with light curves @xcite .",
    "this is compared with @xmath96 for star forming field galaxies ( dotted histogram ) , as calculated from the h@xmath98/h@xmath99 balmer line ratio obtained by sdss within 3 arcsec of the central region of galaxies for @xmath100 @xcite .",
    "the mean value of extinction of sne ia , @xmath101 mag , is significantly smaller than that for star forming field galaxies , @xmath102 mag .",
    "this suggests that most sne ia take place in regions clearer in dust than actively star forming regions .",
    "we provisionally assume that the colour variation is due to extinction within host galaxies and that the extinction law is the same as that in our galaxy with @xmath103 .",
    "we then estimate brightness of sne ia by correcting for extinction as @xmath104 with @xmath105 .",
    "we note , however , that this ratio of total to selective extinction is not well justified .",
    "there are some indications that @xmath3 for sne ia is lower than the galactic value ; @xcite used the bluest sne ia to estimate intrinsic colour of sn ia and @xcite used sne ia in early - type galaxies and far outlying sne ia in spiral galaxies .",
    "both authors obtained @xmath106 .",
    "@xcite also found a low value of @xmath107 simultaneously deriving templets of sne colour evolution in time and extinction .",
    "@xcite resulted in @xmath108 and @xcite gave @xmath109 .",
    "all @xmath3 thus derived are smaller than the canonical value for the milky way .",
    "figure [ fig : snlf ] shows the lf of sne ia in the @xmath35-passband , which is fitted with the gaussian distribution with the mean and dispersion given in the upper left corner of each panel .",
    "the panel ( a ) assumes that the colour variation @xmath57 arises from extinction with @xmath110 , giving the mean @xmath111 ( in the johnson zero point ) and the dispersion @xmath112 mag .",
    "if we would adopt a smaller value for @xmath3 , the lf of sne ia becomes closer to a more regular gaussian distribution with a smaller dispersion , as shown in figure [ fig : snlf](b ) .",
    "the minimisation of dispersion with respect to @xmath99 results in @xmath113 , which leads to the narrower gaussian width of 0.16 mag with @xmath114 , which is 0.10 mag fainter than with @xmath115 .",
    "thus the smaller @xmath3 gives more homogeneous sn ia luminosity .",
    "this small value of @xmath3 obtained by minimizing the width of gaussian fitted to sne lf is an alternative manifestation of the low value of @xmath99 obtained by @xcite by minimising the residual scatter in the hubble diagram along with cosmological parameters . @xcite and @xcite indicated that minimizing the scatter in the hubble diagram tends to give @xmath3 biased towards a value lower than the true value . our simulation ,",
    "however , shows that the value of @xmath99 may be biased to the lower value but no more than by @xmath116 , so that this can not be the reason for @xmath3 being significantly smaller than 3.1 .",
    "we do not conclude here that @xmath3 is actually smaller but take @xmath115 as our fiducial choice , keeping in mind the uncertainty from @xmath3 in the analysis in what follows .",
    "it has been argued that the maximum luminosity correlates with the light curve shape , or more specifically the decline rate ( @xmath117 , stretch , or salt2",
    "s @xmath56 ) , and the inclusion of the correlation with it makes the behaviour of the lf tighter @xcite .",
    "we show in panels ( c ) and ( d ) of figure [ fig : snlf ] the lf where brightness is corrected by @xmath118 , with @xmath98 chosen to minimise the width of the gaussian . in panel",
    "( c ) , @xmath99 is fixed to our fiducial value of 4.1 and the minimisation gives @xmath119 . in ( d )",
    "both @xmath98 and @xmath99 are chosen to minimise the width , which results in @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "the correlation of @xmath56 with brightness makes the gaussian distribution narrower , especially for the case in which both @xmath98 and @xmath99 are optimised .",
    "the narrowest gaussian is obtained with @xmath122 which corresponds to @xmath123 where the correction for the light curve shape to brightness is expressed as @xmath124 .",
    "this value is consistent with 0.78@xmath125 obtained by @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : mab ] shows the correlation between brightness of sne with the shape parameter and the colour excess .",
    "this correlation is the reason why the width of the luminosity function decreases upon inclusions of the light curve shape parameter and the colour excess parameter ( with a small @xmath3 ) .",
    "the correlation in the upper panel is represented by @xmath126 as shown in figure [ fig : snlf](b ) , and that in the lower panel by @xmath127 as in figure [ fig : snlf](c ) .",

    "the normalisation is taken to be the same as that in figure [ fig : hostlf_r ] .",
    "morphological types of galaxies are indicated with the corresponding colours according to @xcite with the error bar representing the dispersion of colours in the morphologically classified sample .",
    "this figure shows that the colour distribution of sne ia host galaxies traces well that of field galaxies , and we do not see any particular excess of sne ia host galaxies for bluer , late type or irregular galaxies , beyond one sigma level . in this comparison",
    "we do not take into account the evolution of galaxy colour to @xmath171 .",
    "in particular we may be interested in the difference of the sn rate between the elliptical galaxies and other galaxies .",
    "if we select galaxies with colour @xmath172 corresponding to elliptical galaxies ( with contaminations from s0 and some sa galaxies ) we obtain the sn rate @xmath173 snu(r ) which is compared with @xmath174 for galaxies with @xmath175 ( sa galaxies or later ) .",
    "we observe a 31@xmath176% enhancement in the sn rate relative to galaxy luminosity in late type galaxies compared to that in elliptical galaxies , though the effect is only at one sigma .",
    "we do not see a particular enhancement of sn rate per luminosity , however , among late type galaxies , where the star formation rate increases towards later type morphologies @xcite .",
    "@xmath177 colour is more sensitive to the star formation activity than @xmath178 , but @xmath19-band brightness is too faint to us for most host galaxies : sn host galaxies brighter than 21 mag are less than 40% for our magnitude limit supernova sample , and we are not able to draw a meaningful conclusion from the @xmath177 colour distribution . the sn host galaxies are also too faint for sdss spectroscopy @xcite , and we can not estimate the star formation rate directly , unless we resort to population synthesis colours , which are not well constrained without @xmath19 colour .",
    "therefore , we do not find clear evidence that points to the correlation of the sn rate with the star formation activity .",
    "@xcite and @xcite give models of sn ia rates with the two components of progenitors , one explosions of old binary stars with a large delay time from the formation and the other explosions with a short delay time after the system formed .",
    "@xcite give sne ia rate that depends on the morphological type of host galaxies in units of snu(@xmath179 ) .",
    "we may use their rate to estimate the number of sne ia for each morphological type using morphological - type dependent luminosity density of field galaxies , as given by @xcite with the aid of the conversion from the @xmath28 to the @xmath179-passband @xcite .",
    "this model gives @xmath180 , where 31% are the prompt component , which is consistent with the difference in sn ia rate relative to galaxy luminosity between elliptical galaxies and spiral galaxies .",
    "the total rate also agrees with our rate in equation ( [ eq : volsnr ] ) .",
    "the detailed numbers are presented in table [ tbl : rate ] .",
    "@xcite modelled sn ia rate as a function of stellar masses and mean sfrs of host galaxies .",
    "we use the morphology dependent luminosity density of @xcite and the morphologically dependent star formation rate calculated from the star formation rate of the bugle and disk components given in @xcite .",
    "the predicted sn ia rate is @xmath181 , of which 13% are prompt : see also table [ tbl : rate ] .",
    "the predicted numbers of sne ia are plotted in figure [ fig : hostcf ] as dotted ( mannucci et al.s model ) and dashed ( sullivan et al.s model ) curves taking the colour distribution of each morphological type as a gaussian with mean and dispersion given by @xcite .",
    "the @xmath33 for the two models are 15.1 and 23.6 for 11 degrees of freedom using data for @xmath182 .",
    "the currently available two component models are marginal to represent our data , but are consistent with the observed number of sne ia , as shown by the histogram in figure [ fig : hostcf ] allowing for large uncertainties . the prompt component is rather minor and not very manifest in the integrated rates for low @xmath26 sne , as in our analysis .",
    "the model prediction for i m galaxies is low , which is due to the low luminosity density of i m galaxies in the sdss morphologically classified sample . in @xcite",
    "i m galaxies contribute only @xmath183 of the total luminosity density , which may be due to the selection effect that disfavours i m galaxies .",
    "this contrasts to the indication from the colour function of @xcite , which suggests that galaxies bluer than @xmath184 contribute by @xmath185 of total luminosity .",
    "if the luminosity density of i m galaxies is this large , however , the number of sne ia in i m galaxies would be 10 times more that would largely overshoot our observed numbers of sne . to identify the prompt component and test the two component hypothesis , we need a sample where the prompt component is dominant , or the sample with which both star formation rate and sn rate can more accurately be measured .",
    "our sample allows us to study if the properties of sne ia would depend on the property of host galaxies .",
    "it has occasionally been claimed that bright sne ia appear more often in late type galaxies , while sne ia in early type galaxies are subluminous @xcite .",
    "this has been counted as one of the reasons that sn ia calibration of nearby galaxy s distance led to a smaller value of the hubble constant in the past .",
    "figure [ fig : snmhostc](a ) plots the maximum brightness of sne ia in our sample as a function of @xmath178 colour of host galaxies : mean brightness of sne ia does not change across colours of galaxies from e to i m .",
    "in particular the plot does not indicate any evidence that sne ia in bluer galaxies are systematically brighter or those in red galaxies are fainter .",
    "both mean and dispersion of luminosity are nearly constant with respect to galaxy colour as seen in the figure .",
    "figure [ fig : snmhostc](b ) shows the plot of the @xmath56 parameter , which represents the decline rate of sne ia brightness , against @xmath178 colour of host galaxies .",
    "the upper values of @xmath56 does not change with respect to colour from e to i m galaxies , but the lower value shows the trend that it decreases from @xmath186 ( or @xmath187 ) for i m galaxies to @xmath188 ( @xmath189 ) for e and s0 galaxies .",
    "it is noted that large negative values of @xmath56 are seen only in early - type galaxies .",
    "this causes some dependence of @xmath56 on colour of host galaxies as seen in the figure .",
    "the slope , however , is small enough to cause any effect on brightness of sne ia through the correction of @xmath190 .",
    "similarly figure [ fig : snmhostm ] shows maximum brightness of sne ia on luminosity of host galaxies , showing that the former does not depend on luminosity of the host .",
    "note that we expect that average metallicity of the host galaxy changes by 0.59 dex in this luminosity range @xcite .",
    "the @xmath56 parameter changes slightly as luminosity of host galaxies changes .",
    "we also examine the dependence of the @xmath57 parameter and the @xmath56 parameter on the distance from the centre of galaxies as shown in figure [ fig : dpos_color ] .",
    "the colour excess @xmath77 stays nearly at @xmath1910.08 with the dispersion of 0.07 and does not show a systematic change from 1 kpc to 15 kpc . in particular , we observe that the colour excess does not decrease as we go farther away from the centre of galaxies , where stars , and hence dust , are expected to decrease .",
    "the trend we see here does not change if we limit the sne to @xmath100 with which sne ia that would receive reasonably large extinction are included in the sample .",
    "this finding suggests us to interpret that the observed reddening is mostly associated with individual supernovae , either extinction from supernova itself and/or circum - supernova dust or intrinsic colour variation of the supernova , rather than interstellar dust in host galaxies .",
    "this would also give us an upper limit on the model as to the amount of dust produced around sne ia .",
    "we observe only 7 sne ia which shows colour excess more than @xmath192 mag among our 137 sn ia sample .",
    "in addition , we do not observe a systematic dependence of the @xmath56 parameter on the distance from the centre of galaxies ; see figure [ fig : dpos_color](b ) .",
    "the sne ia sample acquired in the sdss ii , containing 137 low redshift sne from @xmath193 to 0.3 , indicates that the occurrence of sne ia is primarily proportional to luminosity of galaxies .",
    "the lf of sn ia host galaxies matches very well with that of field galaxies multiplied by luminosity , and colour of sn ia host galaxies does not differ from that of field galaxies .",
    "our low redshift sample does not indicate an active signature that the occurrence of sne ia follows star formation activity , except that possible enhancement in the sn ia rate is noted in late type galaxies ( @xmath194% ) compared with the rate in elliptical galaxies .",
    "our low redshift sample is compatible with the two component model where the effect of the prompt component is modest ( 10@xmath19530% of the total rate ) , as in the current models .",
    "we are not able to differentiate sn rates among late type galaxies .",
    "our sample contains 8 sne ia , whose host galaxies were not identified .",
    "it is shown , however , that they are consistent with them occurred in low luminous galaxies beyond the survey limit for galaxies .",
    "luminosity of sne ia does not appear to depend upon luminosity or colour of host galaxies .",
    "the luminosity function of sne ia is gaussian with @xmath196 and @xmath197 mag ( fwhm is a factor 1.4 in luminosity ) , if the colour variation is interpreted as reddening obeying the extinction law of the milky way with the standard value @xmath93 .",
    "this gaussian distribution is further tightened and @xmath198 mag if the extinction to reddening ratio @xmath3 is reduced to @xmath199 and if the correlation is taken into account between maximum brightness and the decline rate .",
    "reddening of sn ia , inferred from the colour variation , is 0.1 mag in @xmath96 , which is lower approximately by a factor of 5 than that for star forming field galaxies measured from h@xmath98 and h@xmath99 emission .",
    "we also showed that the distribution of the sn ia occurrence , that extends to a few tens of kpc , agrees with the general light distribution of galaxies that have bulges with the de vaucouleurs type profiles .",
    "the variation of colours of sn ia is constant and does not depend on the distance from the centre of galaxies unlike what is expected for the supernova that would happen in the galactic disc .",
    "the colour variation of sne ia may likely be ascribed to intrinsic colour variation or immediate neighbourhood of supernovae rather than extinction in host galaxies . the total column density of dust",
    "should not give extinction more than 0.2 mag in the @xmath90 passband .",
    "we should like to thank the review group of the sdss - ii supernova survey project ( josh frieman , bob nichol , saurabh jha , benjamin dilday ) and don schneider and richard kessler for reviewing the manuscript and useful comments improving the manuscript .",

    "<S> the sample contains 8 type ia supernovae whose host galaxies were not identified , but it is shown that their occurrence is consistent with them occurred in low luminous galaxies beyond the survey . </S>",
    "<S> the luminosity function of type ia supernovae is approximately gaussian with the full - width half maximum being a factor of 1.4 in luminosity . the gaussian distribution becomes tighter if the ratio of extinction to reddening , @xmath3 , is lower than the characteristic value for the milky way and if luminosity is corrected for the light curve shape . </S>",
    "<S> the colour excess is @xmath4 mag which is significantly smaller than reddening expected for field galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> this colour excess does not vary with the distance of the supernovae from the centre of the host galaxy to 15 kpc . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that the major part of the colour excess appears to be either intrinsic or reddening that arises in the immediate environment of supernova , rather than interstellar reddening in host galaxies , and most of type ia supernovae take place in relatively dust free environment . </S>"
