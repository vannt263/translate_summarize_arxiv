    "transition metal compounds with interplay of spin , orbital , and charge degrees of freedom are of strong current interest .",
    "thus , magnetite ( fe@xmath1o@xmath10 ) , the famous lodestone,@xcite is one of the classical examples of such a system , where a first - order metal - insulator transition occurs at @xmath11 k.@xcite according to verwey this transition is caused by the ordering of fe@xmath4 and fe@xmath5 cations on the octahedral @xmath12-sublattice of the inverted spinel structure ab@xmath0o@xmath10.@xcite recently , the local spin density approximation ( lsda)+@xmath2 method  @xcite has been used for investigation of the low - temperature monoclinic structure  @xcite of fe@xmath1o@xmath10  @xcite . the charge and orbitally ordered insulating ground state with two different order parameters : small for the charge and large for the orbital order was obtained self - consistently . while the first order parameter was introduced as the total @xmath6 charge separation between fe@xmath4 and fe@xmath5 cations , the latter one corresponds to the charge difference between occupancies of occupied @xmath13 orbital of fe@xmath4 and unoccupied @xmath13 orbital of fe@xmath5 cations .",
    "but an important issue , which is still unresolved is whether the charge ordering in magnetite is driven by coulomb repulsion between the charges , or by the strain arising from electron - lattice interactions .",
    "an analysis of the charge and orbital order parameters  @xcite in fe@xmath1o@xmath10 inevitably results in a strong interplay between jahn - teller effect and electrostatic repulsion between electrons .",
    "therefore , theoretical investigations of the isostructural iron and manganese oxoborate ( fe@xmath0obo@xmath1 and mn@xmath0obo@xmath1 , correspondingly ) that support predominantly electrostatic and jahn - teller distortion driven mechanisms  @xcite behind the charge ordering in the same structural arrangement , are highly desirable .",
    "iron borate ( fe@xmath0obo@xmath1 ) is a semi - valent oxide.@xcite it belongs to the homometallic warwickite family with formal chemical formula @xmath14 , where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are , respectively , a divalent and trivalent metal ions .",
    "surprisingly , that the homometallic ( @xmath17 ) warwickites are known only for fe  @xcite and mn.@xcite in both compounds the metal have octahedral coordination . these octahedra share edges to form ribbons of four infinite along crystallographic @xmath7-direction chains of octahedra linked by corner sharing and the trigonal bo@xmath1 groups ( see fig .",

    "fe@xmath0obo@xmath1 is @xmath9-type ferrimagnetic with drastically smaller in comparison to fe@xmath1o@xmath10 critical temperature of @xmath21 k , the fe(1 ) magnetic moments being aligned antiparallel to the fe(2 ) moments .",
    "it is almost antiferromagnetic but a small ferrimagnetic moment of @xmath22  @xmath23 per fe atom in a 0.05 t field was found.@xcite at room temperature fe@xmath0obo@xmath1 is a semiconductor with a thermoactivated conductivity low @xmath24 with @xmath25 ev.@xcite upon farther heating a broad semiconductor - to - semiconductor transition occurs at @xmath26 k , where resistivity drops down by a factor of @xmath27 , and , as a result , a small decreasing of the activated energy up to @xmath28 ev above 350 k is observed.@xcite the 317 k transition is assigned to charge ordering of 2 + and 3 + fe cations on fe(1 ) and fe(2 ) sites , and accompanied by a structural transition from monoclinic @xmath29 to orthorhombic @xmath30 symmetry with increasing temperature .",
    "this structural transition is attributed by modification of the @xmath8 angle from @xmath31 at 3 k to @xmath32 at 337 k.@xcite the change in conductivity and structure are small .",
    "but the @xmath33fe m@xmath34ssbauer spectra at around 317 k clearly result in the charge localization at the transition with an equal distribution of fe@xmath4 and fe@xmath5 cations over the two structurally distinct fe(1 ) and fe(2 ) sites with formal chemical formula fe(1)@xmath35fe(1)@xmath36fe(2)@xmath35fe(2)@xmath36obo@xmath1.@xcite although , there are two types of distorted feo@xmath20 octahedra with fe - o bond length varying between 1.92 and 2.23   for 3 k , the average fe(1)-o and fe(2)-o distances are 2.085 and 2.082  , respectively , i.e. equal within experimental errors.@xcite such a small difference results in the extremely small value of deviation ( @xmath37 0.01 ) from the average 2.5 + value of valence of fe cations estimated by the bond valence sum method . while an electronic transition between charge ordered and disordered state occurs at around 317 k , as evidenced by m@xmath34ssbauer spectroscopy and resistivity measurements , no long range fe@xmath4/fe@xmath5 ordering is directly observed by x - ray , neutron or electron diffraction .",
    "thus , a long range charge ordering such as the simple alternating scheme proposed in ref .   destroys the mirror symmetry , which leads to a tilting of the fe - ribbons , consistent with the observed enlargement of the @xmath8 angle below the transition .",
    "however , there is no observation of the increasing of @xmath7-axis periodicity ( it should increase by a factor of two or another integer factor below @xmath38 ) .",
    "thus , below the transition , a charge ordering is not implicit in the atom coordinates , although it is indirectly evidenced by other experiments .",
    "this ambiguity is resolved in our electronic structure study , which reveals an arrangement of fe@xmath4 and fe@xmath5 cations alternately ordered within the chains along the @xmath7-direction .    in this paper",

    "motivated by our results , we propose an order parameter , defined as the difference between @xmath3 minority spin occupancies of fe(1)@xmath4 and fe(1)@xmath5 as well as the difference between @xmath3 majority spin occupancies of fe(2)@xmath4 and fe(2)@xmath5 cations .",
    "this order parameter is found to be quite large , although the total @xmath6 charge difference between 2 + and 3 + cations , is small .",

    "seven kinds of empty spheres were introduced to fill up the inter - atomic space . for simplicity",
    "we neglect small spin - orbit coupling ( for instance , in other iron oxide , in fe@xmath1o@xmath10 , the spin - orbital interaction for @xmath6 electrons was found to be negligibly small ) .",
    "we consider only a collinear spin case , in which the fe magnetic moments are aligned along the @xmath7-direction ( see table 1 of ref .  ) , which is in a reasonably good agreement with the experimental magnetic structure of fe@xmath0obo@xmath1 below @xmath47 .",

    "fe @xmath6 states give predominant contribution to the bands at -3.5 ev below and up to 2.5 ev above the fermi level .",
    "the exchange splitting between the spin - up and spin - down fe @xmath6 states is roughly 3 ev .",
    "additionally , the five - fold @xmath6 levels are split by the crystal field into @xmath3 and @xmath49 sub - bands .",
    "the oxygen octahedra in fe@xmath0obo@xmath1 are strongly distorted and the local symmetry of fe sites is , of cause , lower than cubic . nevertheless , the cubic component of the ligand field , which is determined by the relative strength of fe @xmath50  o @xmath51 hybridization of @xmath52- and @xmath53-type , remains dominant , whereas the splitting within `` @xmath3 '' and `` @xmath54 '' subbands is smaller than the corresponding band width .",
    "this allows one to label the corresponding states as @xmath3 and @xmath54 .",
    "the crystal field splitting is roughly 2 ev , which is less than the exchange splitting .",
    "this is consistent with the high - spin state of the fe cations .",
    "the symmetry inequivalence of fe(1 ) and fe(2 ) sites leads to an inexact cancellation of magnetic moments and results in a small ferrimagnetic moment of @xmath55  @xmath23 per formula unit .",
    "the absolute values of magnetic moments obtained by lsda are 3.54 @xmath23 and 3.81 @xmath23 for fe(1 ) and fe(2 ) sites , respectively .",
    "fe(1 ) and fe(2 ) @xmath3 and @xmath49 states with the opposite spin projections share nearly the same energy intervals .",
    "thus , fe @xmath6 states between -3.5 and -2.0 ev originate predominantly from majority spin fe(1 ) and minority spin fe(2 ) @xmath3 states whereas the states between -2.0 and -0.5 ev are mainly of @xmath49 character .",
    "partially occupied bands crossing the fermi level are formed by minority spin fe(1 ) and majority spin fe(2 ) @xmath3 states .",
    "the nominal occupation of these bands is 1/6 . in the majority spin channel , however , the fe(2 ) @xmath3 state , that is oriented in the plane",
    "perpendicular to the shortest fe(2)o bond , forms quasi - one - dimensional bands with a strong dispersion along the @xmath7-direction .",
    "the one - dimensional character of the dispersion is explained by the fact that there are only two nearest neighbours of the same kind around each fe(2 ) ion .",
    "the other two fe(2 ) @xmath3 states are shifted to higher energy and the corresponding bands are completely unoccupied . as a result ,",
    "the majority spin bands crossing the fermi level turn out to be half - filled .",
    "an fe(1 ) ion , in contrast to fe(2 ) one , has four fe(1 ) neigbours at close distances . as a result of the hybridisation between fe(1 )",
    "@xmath3 states the situation in the minority spin chanel is more complicated .",
    "twelve @xmath3 bands are split into three groups of 4 bands each .",
    "the fermi level is crossed by lowest bands which show a rather strong dispersion along @xmath7-direction but with a period two times smaller than the quasi - one - dimensional fe(2 ) bands .",
    "it should be noted that in contrast to experimental data  @xcite lsda predicts fe@xmath0obo@xmath1 to be metallic with substantial magnetic moment per unit cell .",
    "apparently , the electron - electron correlations , mainly in the @xmath6 shell of fe cations , play a significant role .",
    "to proceed further we take into account the strong electronic correlations in fe @xmath6 shell using the lsda+@xmath2 method .",

    "this is in a strong contrast to metallic solution without co obtained by the lsda .",
    "the co pattern obtained from the calculations is similar to the one proposed in ref .",
    "this is a notable result because the co is not implicit in the atomic coordinates , and it shows that lsda+@xmath2 calculations can assist experiments in revealing co arrangements . to obtain a reasonably good agreement of the calculated gap of 0.39 ev with experimental value of 0.35 ev we increase the @xmath2 value up to 5.5 ev",

    "the calculated net moment is @xmath59 per fe atom , in exact agreement with the experimental value ( ref .  ) .",

    "we perform additional self - consistent lsda+@xmath2 calculations for @xmath29 unit cell as well as for double and triple along @xmath7-direction @xmath29 supercells .",
    "but only self - consistent solutions with larger value of the total energy or with substantial magnetic moment per unit cell , which contradicts to the experimental data , were found .",
    "also we found that other charge arrangements in @xmath62 @xmath29 supercell are unstable , and the stable one coincides with the co found previously .",
    "thus , the co obtained for certain value of @xmath2 and @xmath58 does not depend on the initial charge arrangemet .",
    "it is not possible to check all possible co arrangements including more complex co scenarios , but our results consistently indicate that the obtained co solution is more favourable than other simple alternatives , and is the ground state of fe@xmath0obo@xmath1 in the low - temperature phase .    because of the small monoclinic distortion of the low temperature @xmath29 structure the distances between the nearest fe(1 )",
    "cations become slightly different .",
    "it is important to note that in the calculated co pattern the shortest ( 2.957  ) is the distance between the pairs of equally charged fe(1 ) cations whereas the distance between fe(1)@xmath4 and fe(1)@xmath5 cations turns out to be larger ( 2.961  ) . on the contrary ,",
    "the pairs of fe(1 ) and fe(2 ) sites with the shortest distance between them are occupied by the cations of different valency .",
    "thus , assuming a simple ionic model with the coulomb interaction between fe ions only the obtained co pattern contradicts to the requirement of the minimal electrostatic energy .",
    "indeed , the comparison of the madelung energies shows that the energy lowers ( about 0.07 ev per unit cell ) if the nearest fe(1 ) sites are occupied by fe(1)@xmath4 and fe(1)@xmath5 ions .",
    "this observation suggests that electron - lattice coupling rather than electrostatic repulsions drives the charge ordering in fe@xmath0obo@xmath1 ; the same conclusion was found for the charge order in fe@xmath1o@xmath10.@xcite    although the corresponding total @xmath6 charges difference @xmath63 and disproportion of the total electron charges inside the atomic spheres of fe@xmath4 and fe@xmath5 cations @xmath64 is small , an analysis of occupation matrices of @xmath6 fe(1)/fe(2 ) minority / majority spin states confirms substantial charge separation .",
    "thus , as shown in table  [ tab : occ ] , one of the @xmath3 states of fe(1)@xmath4 and fe(2)@xmath4 cations is almost completely filled with the occupation numbers @xmath65 , whereas the remained two @xmath3 orbitals of the fe@xmath4 cations have significantly smaller population of about 0.1 . according to ref .",
    "we define an order parameter as the largest difference between fe@xmath4 and fe@xmath5 @xmath3 populations .",
    "while due to strong static `` screening '' effects,@xcite the order parameter introduced as the total @xmath6 charge difference between 2 + and 3 + fe cations is ill defined , the well - defined order parameter is the difference of @xmath3 occupancies for fe@xmath5 and fe@xmath4 cations , which amounts to 80% of ideal ionic co model and clearly pronounces the existence of co below the transition .",
    "the occupation matrices analysis shows that the change of the @xmath3 occupations caused by the charge ordering is very effectively screened by the rearrangement of the other fe electrons .",
    "thus , significant contribution to the charge screening is provided by fe @xmath49 states due to relatively strong @xmath53 bonds with 2@xmath51 o states and , as a result , appreciable contribution to the occupied part of the valence band .",

    "the values of these interactions are shown in table  [ tab : inter_exchange ] , whereas the spatial representation is schematically presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : inter_exchange ] .",
    "thus , the exchange parameters between fe(1)@xmath5 and fe(2)@xmath4 cations are antiferromagnetic with values of @xmath69 - 229 k and @xmath70 - 207 k ( see table  [ tab : inter_exchange ] ) .",
    "such an appreciable difference between @xmath71 and @xmath72 arises from geometry since the former is due to the superexchange interaction between fe ions linked by shortest bonds to a common o ion .",
    "it seems that the geometrical reason is also responsible for decreasing of absolute value of the exchange interactions between fe(1)@xmath4 and fe(2)@xmath5 cations from @xmath73 k to @xmath74 k ( see table  [ tab : inter_exchange ] ) .",
    "also it is interesting to note that the exchange interaction between fe(1)@xmath5 and fe(2)@xmath5 cations is considerably larger than between fe(1)@xmath4 and fe(2)@xmath4 ( @xmath75 and @xmath76 , respectively ) .",
    "we find that the interribbon exchange interactions play predominant role and determine the whole @xmath9-type ferrimagnetic spin structure below @xmath47 in contrast to the ferromagnetic intrachain order due to @xmath77 ",
    "in summary , in the present lsda+@xmath2 study of the low - temperature @xmath29 phase of fe@xmath0obo@xmath1 we found a charge ordered insulator with an energy gap of 0.39 ev . while the screening of the charge disproportion is so effective that the total @xmath6 charge separation is rather small ( 0.34 ) , the charge order is well pronounced with an order parameter defined as a difference of @xmath3 occupancies of 2 + and 3 + fe cations ( 0.8 ) .",
