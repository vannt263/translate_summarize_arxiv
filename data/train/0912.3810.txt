    "blazars typically show superluminal motion of discrete jet features .",
    "observations indicate that blazars are very compact and have a parsec - scale radio jet pointing close to our line of sight . to answer fundamental questions concerning beaming factors of superluminal motion , origin of high energy production , and the connection between @xmath4-ray flares and jet - component ejections , multiwavelength observations are crucial .",
