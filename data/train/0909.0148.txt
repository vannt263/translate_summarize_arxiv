    "the luminosity variations of kuv 02464 + 3239 have been discovered by fontaine et al .",
    "@xcite . they identified it as a dav pulsator using an about 50-minute - long observation made in 1999 . in this paper",
    "we present some results of the fourier and seismological analyses of the star based on our observations .",
    "we also present our investigations of selected light curve segments .    based on its atmospheric parameters ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xcite )",
    "the star is located near the red edge of the dav instability strip .",
    "non - sinusoidal light curve shapes , short - term amplitude variations and the presence of linear combination peaks in the fourier spectra characterize the pulsation of similar cool dav stars .",
    "investigations of these complex pulsators can allow of to know more about the dynamics behind the observed light variations .",
    "we started white light observations of the star in october 2006 at piszkstet ( the mountain station of konkoly observatory ) with the 1 m rcc telescope and a princeton instruments versarray:1300b ccd camera .",
    "the observations ended february 2007 .",
    "covering the whole observing season we obtained data on 20 nights .",
    "our longest time string obtained on jd 2454068 covers 11.2h .",
    "we used standard iraf routines during the photometric reduction process .",
    "data analyses were made by use of the mufran ( multi - frequency analyzer ) package @xcite @xcite and the time series analysis program period04 @xcite .",
    "frequency values are derived in cycle / day ( c / d ) units .",
    "kuv 02464 + 3239 was found to be a multiperiodic pulsator showing large amplitude and long period pulsation modes in accordance with its position in the dav instability strip .",
    "another characteristic of the light curve is its strongly non - sinusoidal shape .",
    "this means that non - linear effects play an important role in the observed variability .",
    "since we observed kuv 02464 + 3239 through a whole season , we had the opportunity to form groups of nights and analyse them independently .",
    "we selected four subsets of nights : four nights from october ( subset 1 ) , the longest time string ( subset 2 ) from november and a one- and four - night dataset from december ( subset 3 and 4 , respectively ) .",
    "table  [ log ] shows the data subsets log of observations .",

    "[ cols=\"<,^,^ , > , > \" , ]     by further investigations of the 6 model solutions we selected 3 models as our ` favoured ' ones .",

    "therefore , the 0.645@xmath0 model seems to be our best choice .",

    "we published our preliminary analysis of the first month s dataset in 2007 @xcite .",
    "we investigated two segments of the light curve which show alternating smaller and larger maxima .",
    "we found harmonic and lower - amplitude subharmonic peaks by the fourier analyses of these segments .",
    "this feature of the spectra implies that the dynamics of the star is dominated by non - linear processes .",
    "fontaine et al .",
    "@xcite described kuv 02464 + 3239 as a photometric twin of the cool dav star , gd 154 . in the case of gd 154 robinson et al .",
    "@xcite also detected harmonics and subharmonics in the power spectrum .",
    "the emergence of subharmonic peaks is similar to what we see in some non - linear dynamical systems which evolve toward chaos via a cascade of period doubling bifurcations .",
    "this result on the two segments made us to investigate other parts of the light curve as well .",
    "however , we could nt point out the presence of significant subharmonic peaks but only of harmonics",
    ". this gave us the idea to investigate light curve segments from another point of view .",
    "we selected segments which show large amplitude variations . in these cases",
    "we can see easily the non - sinusoidal shape of the cycles and we can find at least the second harmonic peak of the frequency which is dominant in the given segment . as control cases we selected light curve segments showing just small amplitude variations and segments where we can determine two close frequencies causing beat in that part .",
    "we used the standard deviations of the light curve segments to parametrize the groups .",
    "the standard deviation ( sd ) has two sources .",
    "the scatter of the measurement and the deviation from the mean light level caused by the pulsation .",
    "since our observations are of high quality the dominant part of sd reflects the amplitude of the star s pulsation .",
    "[ sd1 ] confirmes the correctness of our selection criteria showing standard deviations of the selected light curve segments .",
    "the 3 groups are widely separated according to this parameter . the numbers in fig .",
    "[ sd1 ] are used to refer to a certain segment throughout the paper .",
    "four segments with the largest amplitude light variations are presented in fig .",
    "[ lc : large ] .",
    "they have different reasons for being selected .",
    "segment 5 analysed in bognr et al .",
    "@xcite shows very explicit alternation of small and large amplitude cycles which denotes the presence of subharmonic frequencies . in the case of segment 11",
    "we see an abrupt change in the peaks amplitude from one cycle to another .",
    "segments 40 and 41 seem to have a roughly sinusoidal envelope suggesting strong beating of frequencies . in segment 41 frequencies at @xmath1387 and 104c / d and their second harmonics are responsible for the envelope s shape .        in the case of the large amplitude segments",
    "there are remarkable discrepancies between the observations and their fits .",
    "neither the 6 accepted normal modes nor the extended list with 13 frequencies can give acceptable fits .",
    "sd seems to be a useful parameter again to show the behaviour of segments using 6- and 13-frequency fits . in fig .",
    "[ sd2 ] we present the sd differences of the original light curve segments and their fits ( solid and dashed lines : 6 and 13-frequency solutions , respectively ) .",
    "most of the segments show @xmath14 sd improvements using more frequencies .",
    "the 13-frequency sd differences of most segments agree with the average sd difference of the 6-frequency fits for one of our control group , the beating segments .",
    "this level is @xmath15 .",
    "our examples presented in fig .",
    "[ lc : large ] have privileged positions in the representation of sd differences , too . in fig .",
    "[ sd2 ] the 4 largest amplitude segments have the largest difference values . in the case of segment 5",
    "we see smaller improvement with a 13-frequency fit than for segment 40 and 41 . considering the 13-frequency fit segment 40 and 41",
    "do not have privileged positions anymore . in some cases  at segment 29 , 26 and 37  we get only slight improvements .",
    "the average of improvement using 13 frequencies instead of 6 is about 40% .",
    "this short investigation of larger amplitude light curve segments suggests the importance of non - linear processes working in the star . considering the shape of the light curve ( with special regards to alternating smaller and larger amplitude cycles ) and the fts of segments showing large amplitude variations it is obvious that to understand the behaviour of this star we would need a non - linear treatment of its pulsation .",
    "another result is that we found differences rather than similarities between the overall pulsational properties of gd 154 and kuv 02464 + 3239 .",
    "the fourier spectrum of gd 154 is dominated by only 3 modes and their harmonics and linear combinations @xcite .",
    "we found 6 modes in the case of kuv 02464 + 3239 and only one significant harmonic in the whole light curve s spectrum .",
    "we see clear presence of further harmonics only in segments of the light curve .",
    "the non - linear behaviour of kuv 02464 + 3239 and similar white dwarf pulsators mean real challenge for theory and they are waiting for a solution ."
