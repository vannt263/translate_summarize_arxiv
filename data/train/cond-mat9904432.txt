    "when non magnetic sites are diluted in an unfrustrated ferromagnet with a probability @xmath0 , the transition temperature is reduced and vanishes at the percolation threshold @xmath1 . in such non frustrated systems , two phases only exist : a low temperature ferromagnetic phase above the percolation threshold , and a paramagnetic phase . if the temperature is decreased at the percolation threshold , the dynamics becomes slower because large - scale droplet - like objects of size @xmath2 form , with @xmath3  @xcite .",

    "this indicates that some perturbations of these unfrustrated systems may drive them to a true spin glass phase , which we show in the present article by studying the thermodynamics of a particular model .    in dilute magnet compounds , such as eu@xmath4sr@xmath5s  @xcite",

    "the spin glass phase is reentrant inside the ferromagnetic phase .",
    "one purpose of the present article is to show that these qualitative features of the phase diagram can be reproduced in a model that combines dilution and short range frustration .",
    "this model does not consist in a detailed microscopic modeling of eu@xmath4sr@xmath5s , but rather contains the generic ingredients entering the physics of these systems ( dilution and short range frustration )  @xcite . even though this treatment relies on a specific lattice topology ( a tree structure ) ,",
    "bethe - peierls phase diagrams are equivalent to mean field phase diagrams while the bethe - peierls method is powerful enough to give an exact answer to the issue of reentrance .",
    "the resulting phase diagrams are therefore not expected to be specific to our treatment but are generic features of the coupling hamiltonian .",
    "the article is organized as follows .",

    "the paramagnetic phase boundary is solved in section  [ sec : recur - rel ] .",
    "we study in section  [ sec : reentrance ] the spin glass  /  ferromagnet phase boundary and show that it is reentrant .",
    "the issue of reentrance is non trivial because nishimori s argument  @xcite does not hold in our model , part of the exchanges being frozen .",
    "an extension of the model is given in which the spin glass  /  ferromagnet phase boundary is shown not to reenter in the ferromagnetic phase asymptotically close to the tricritical point , whereas it has a turning point at a lower temperature .",
    "we expect this unusual type of phase diagram to be a generic feature of models combining disordered and frozen exchanges , and may be obtained in finite dimensional models also",
    ". finally , we study in section [ sec : dil - spinliquid ] the effect of diluting a spin liquid state , in which case ordering by disorder generates a transition from an ising paramagnet to an ising spin glass .",
    "this ordering by disorder mechanism is `` minimal '' because spins have an ising symmetry only .",
    "in a bethe - peierls calculation , only the properties of the `` top '' spin ( the highest one in the hierarchy ; see fig .  [",
    "fig : husimi ] ) are considered , and the thermodynamic limit is obtained by growing the number of generations to infinity  @xcite .",
    "the top spin fixed point magnetization distributions @xmath11 are of three types : ( i ) _ paramagnetic phase _ : @xmath12 ; ( ii ) _ spin glass phase _ : @xmath11 is even ; ( iii ) _ ferromagnetic phase _ :",
    "@xmath11 has a finite first moment .",
    "the transitions between the phases are of a mean field type  @xcite .",
    "the phase diagram of the @xmath13 model on the bethe lattice  @xcite is very similar to the one of the sherrington - kirkpatrick model  @xcite , and the bethe - peierls treatment allows a correct description  @xcite of the almeida - thouless line  @xcite .",
    "this shows that a bethe - peierls treatment succeeds in reproducing the mean field phase diagram of spin glass models .",
    "we consider a model in which the ferromagnetic bonds @xmath14 of the cayley tree are canceled with a probability @xmath0 .",
    "frustration is added by completing the triangles , with frozen antiferromagnetic bonds @xmath15 forming a husimi cactus - like structure  @xcite ( see fig .  [",

    "the husimi cactus structure allows the introduction of a _ local _ frustration resulting from next - nearest - neighbor interactions , and can be used to mimic the effects of local antiferromagnetic interactions in dilute compounds .",
    "chandra and douot  @xcite considered a frustrated spin model on a regular husimi cactus structure , and studied ordering by disorder in the spin liquid state in the bethe - peierls limit ( see also  @xcite for a study of the effect of quantum fluctuations ) .",
    "these authors considered a non disordered model in which a spin glass phase can not exist  @xcite . in our model with randomness , we show the stability of a spin glass solution in some regions of the phase diagram .",
    "we consider bond instead of site percolation because the site percolation threshold of the husimi cactus structure would be equal to the one of the tree structure , independent of the additional bonds @xmath15 .",
    "the bond percolation model is therefore better suited for modeling dilute compounds  @xcite , since the bond percolation threshold of the structure without frustration ( a tree structure ) is @xmath23 , larger than the bond percolation threshold @xmath24 of the structure with frustration ( the husimi cactus structure shown on fig .",

    "moreover , spin correlations can be related to gauge variable correlations , with the consequence that the frontier between the ferromagnetic and spin glass phases is either vertical or reentrant  @xcite . in our model ,",
    "gauge invariance is useless for the following reason .",
    "one can define a local distribution of bond variables @xmath32 , being ( [ eq : bond ] ) on the tree bonds , and @xmath33 on the antiferromagnetic bonds @xmath15 .",
    "nishimori s line is defined by @xmath34  @xcite , and @xmath35 .",
    "the first equality originates from the tree bond variables and the second from the frozen antiferromagnetic bonds @xmath15 .",
    "the two equalities can be formally met if @xmath27 , in which case nishimori line is @xmath35 . however , this does not make predictions on the phase diagram possible even in the case @xmath27",
    "@xcite because one does not expect to be able to describe finite temperature spin glass properties in terms of the ground state only ( the only state selected if @xmath36 ) .",
    "nishimori s argument can therefore not be made in this model , and the question of reentrance ( item ( iv ) in the introductory section ) can not be answered on the basis of nishimori s line while bethe - peierls calculations are powerful enough to allow the derivation of exact results . we show that the spin glass  /  paramagnet boundary is reentrant in the dilution model ( @xmath27 ) in the @xmath37 plane . in the @xmath13 model with the additional coupling @xmath15 ( @xmath6 ) , and in the @xmath38 plane , we show that the spin glass  /  ferromagnet phase boundary is not reentrant asymptotically close to the tricritical point , whereas it has a turning point at lower temperatures .",

    "we have shown the existence of a spin glass solution upon diluting both the weakly frustrated magnet ( @xmath124 ) , and the spin liquid ( @xmath78 ) .",
    "we underline the differences in the physics in these two regimes .",
    "we believe the generation of a spin glass phase upon weakly frustrating a dilute magnet close to the percolation threshold to be due to the following : _ the strong diluted unfrustrated magnet is already close to a spin glass_. this can be seen on the example of square lattice dilute magnets  @xcite , where dilution removes sites in the ferromagnet up to the point where the percolating cluster is a fractal object at the percolation point .",
    "since the order of ramification of percolating clusters is finite  @xcite , one can isolate large droplet - like objects  @xcite from the remaining of the structure by cutting a finite number of bonds .",

    "the addition of frustration in dilute magnets close to the percolation threshold turns the quasi spin glass order into a true one .",
    "we have shown this explicitly in our model , and a similar behavior was obtained in another model  @xcite .",

    "the `` chaos and memory '' behavior of metallic spin glasses was put forward in ref .",
    "@xcite , associated to the growth of fractal droplets with a chaotic behavior in the sense that droplets at a given temperature overlap weakly with droplets at a different temperature .",
    "we do not expect a chaotic behavior in our model because the finite temperature droplet excitations of the frustrated dilute magnet should be obtained from reversing clusters of spins in the unfrustrated magnet dilute lattice .",
    "the mechanism for generating a spin glass phase from the spin liquid is different .",
    "the spin glass phase originates from a balance between the small - dilution regime in which _ dilution suppresses the liquid behavior in favor of spin - glass correlations _ , and a large - dilution regime in which _ dilution suppresses spin glass correlations by cutting the system into finite pieces_. this is an order by disorder mechanism  @xcite : thermal fluctuations favor a spin glass arrangement and therefore reduce the phase space dimensionality compared to the one of the spin liquid state .",
