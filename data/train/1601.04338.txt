    "the short range energy transfer phenomena find applications in wide areas of physics and chemistry from mesoscopic to molecular systems ,  @xcite and is critical to our understanding of physical , chemical and biological processes at the molecular level .",
    "@xcite understanding the physics of an exciton transfer from a donor to an acceptor is also crucial for designing better solar cells and photo - voltaic materials .",
    "this has fueled great interest in the study of the effect of electromagnetic environment on the resonant energy transfer , which offers the possibility of controlling and enhancing the energy transfer in molecular systems .",
    "@xcite therefore , obtaining an exact classical description of the resonant energy transfer under the influence of an electromagnetic environment is imperative to improve the energy transfer mechanism in molecular systems .",
    "the interaction between a dipole emitter and its mirror image under the metallic surface , or equivalently , the scattered evanescent waves from the metal , has been studied in varieties of nanoscale systems .",
    "@xcite furthermore , the effect of metal on the luminescent lifetime of a molecule has been known ,  @xcite and recently , its effect on the relaxation of the semiconducting quantum dot has been studied .",
    "@xcite the presence of metallic environment in the vicinity of the donor - acceptor system introduces a fluctuating electromagnetic field which can modify the donor s emission and acceptor s absorption spectra , as well as the coupling strength between the donor and the acceptor molecules , which can modify the frster resonant energy transfer ( fret ) rate .",
    "@xcite as a result , one can control the transfer rate by tuning the dielectric environment .",
    "the derivation of the classical energy transfer rate using the dyadic green s function in the local limit of the metallic environment has been considered before  @xcite . here",
    "we reconsider the derivation based on photon green s function , connecting it with previous derivation based on molecular polarizability .",
    "we also consider the non - local limit of the material permittivity which is an accurate limit at small separation of the donor - acceptor system from the metallic surfaces .",
    "furthermore , we generalize our derivation to include energy transfer processes in multimer ( multi - donor and acceptor ) systems in the presence of an arbitrary electromagnetic environment .",
    "we emphasize that the usage of the photons green function allows us to treat arbitrary photonics / dielectric environment as well as multimer systems efficiently , from both computational and theoretical perspectives .",
    "two key factors in the fret rate are : the electronic coupling of the donor and acceptor dipoles and the overlap of the emission and absorption spectra of donor and acceptor molecules .",
    "the fret is considered as an incoherent energy transfer mechanism in which greater overlap between the emission and absorption spectra due to incoherent broadening can enhance the transfer rate .",
    "an incoherent evanescent wave in the vicinity of the metallic environment can participate in the fret by bridging the emission and absorption spectra due to the shared modes of evanescent waves from the metal .",
    "the similar concept of shared phonon modes has been studied previously  @xcite in the context of the enhancement of the fret rate and recent experiments have shown longer coherence time and enhancement of the exciton transfer in light harvesting proteins .",
    "@xcite in the same spirit of the shared mode approach , the mirror image of the donor dipole can couple to the donor and acceptor at the same time through the evanescent waves , leading to enhanced transfer rate .",
    "in addition , in the multimer systems , the shared modes will generate additional pathways for the energy transfer and their interference effect can suppress or enhance the resonant energy transfer rate .",
    "from the classical electromagnetic ( em ) theory , the energy flux density of the em field from the donor to acceptor is given by the poynting vector , @xmath0 .",
    "adopting the classical perspective by kuhn and silbey ,  @xcite the energy transfer from donor to acceptor can be understood as two coupled oscillating dipoles ( donor and acceptor ) .",
    "the donor radiates an electric field that permeates the acceptor and the acceptor as an antenna receives the energy from this field . due to the existence of an electromagnetically active environment like metal , the electric field experienced by the donor and the acceptor",
    "will be modified and can be determined by the boundary conditions , @xmath1 the geometry of the metallic environment . here",
    "we employ the dyadic green s function to calculate the modified electric field of a donor molecule due to the presence of metallic environment , the effect of which is fully captured by the relative permittivity @xmath2 of the environment .    the retarded photon green s function @xmath3 satisfies the following wave equation  @xcite : @xmath4 d_{ik}(\\vec{r}_d,\\vec{r}_a , \\omega )   \\nonumber \\\\ & = \\delta^{3}\\left(\\vec{r}_d-\\vec{r}_a\\right )   \\delta_{jk}\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath5 is the speed of light in vacuum and @xmath6 and @xmath7 are positions of donor and acceptor , respectively .",
    "we briefly pause here to mention that the dyadic green s function contains two important points of information .",
    "first , it provides the electric field @xmath8 of the donor dipole @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the strength or magnitude of the electric dipole and @xmath11 is the unit dipole , located at @xmath6 in the presence of arbitrary metallic environment , @xmath12 \\cdot \\vec{n}^{elec}_d\\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for molecules with finite volumes that can not be approximated by point dipoles , the dipole electric field is obtained by integrating the dyadic green s function over the volume of the molecule .",
    "second , it provides the thermal correlation of the photon reservoir , which includes both evanescent and propagating waves , governed by the spectral density @xmath13 @xmath14 which is related to the dyadic green s function via fluctuation - dissipation theorem :  @xcite @xmath15 [ 1 + n(\\pm\\omega)]\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the planck s function and the indices @xmath17 run over cartesian coordinate axes @xmath18 and @xmath19 .      with this information ,",
    "we are now in a position to express the rate of energy transfer in terms of green s function .",
    "we start from the previously known expression of the energy transfer rate per unit volume in the time domain :  @xcite @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the polarization of an acceptor in the time domain and @xmath22 is the electric field due to the donor molecule at the acceptor s location @xmath7 .",
    "to compare with the fret rate , we transform @xmath23 into the frequency domain , @xmath24 using the acceptor molecule s polarization @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the polarizability tensor of the acceptor , the energy transfer rate becomes : @xmath27 which in time - domain reduces to the previous result derived by chance @xmath28",
    "@xcite . using eq .",

    "[ rate ] shows that the transfer rate is determined by the overlap of the donor emission spectrum @xmath40 , acceptor absorption spectrum @xmath41 and the dyadic green s function @xmath42 .",
    "these three terms represent two fluctuation sources  phonon bath ( linewidth broadening of emission and absorption spectra ) and the evanescent component of the fluctuating electromagnetic waves .      using the dyadic green s function ,",
    "we extend the fret rate from dimer to multimer systems . assuming that the system consists of @xmath43 with @xmath44 donors and @xmath45 with @xmath46 acceptors , one can write the dyadic green s function for all possible interaction between the donors and acceptors using the same photon green s function described above , except with different labels of @xmath47 for a donor molecule location and @xmath48 for the location of an acceptor molecule .",

    "since the energy transfer rate is modified only at a small separation from the metal , it is necessary to take an accurate model of the permittivity of the metal to obtain the better estimate of the effect of the metallic environment on the transfer rate . to this end",

    "@xcite we attribute this difference in behavior to the fact that in case of energy transfer , green s function is evaluated at the spatial locations of a donor and an acceptor , which are always separated by a finite distance .",
    "however , in the case of relaxation rate calculation , green s function is always evaluated at the location of a single molecule or a quantum dot .",
    "the presence of finite length scale in the case of energy transfer prohibits contribution from large momentum wavevectors of the evanescent modes in the local limit and does not lead to divergence of the transfer rate even at small separations from the metal . as such ,",
    "the non - local limit only offers small corrections and the result does not deviate significantly from the local approximation .",
    "we have studied the effect of metallic environment on the resonant molecular energy transfer using the classical model based on the dyadic green s function in local and non - local limits of the material permittivity .",
    "our results demonstrate that the evanescent waves from the metallic halfspace and thin film can enhance the fret rate between the donor and the acceptor since they are simultaneously coupled to the same evanescent mode from the metal .",
    "furthermore , we have extended our model to multimer systems in arbitrary dielectric environments .",
    "the numerical results indicate that since all donors and acceptors are under the influence of the evanescent wave , the path interference through all the incoherent channels can enhance or suppress the energy transfer rate with different arrangements of donors and acceptors and their distances from the metal surface .",
    "our work suggests that by utilizing metallic environments and different arrangements of dipoles / molecules , the resonant energy transfer rate can be modulated . in the future",
    ", we would like to implement computational method based on our theoretical framework to improve fster s energy transfer rate by tailoring the metallic geometry .",
    "in addition , further studies to identify optimal geometrical arrangement of donors and acceptors to guide the energy flow in nanoscale systems will find applications in designing nano - materials for efficient harvesting of solar light .",
