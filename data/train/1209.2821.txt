    "point - contact spectroscopy ( pcs ) has long been known as a method to study the interactions of electrons with other excitations in metals .",
    "@xcite the interpretation of the observed characteristics in point - contact ( pc ) spectra is usually difficult because most often contacts are made by the needle - anvil or shear technique and are not microscopically well - defined with respect to contact size and geometry , structure , and local electronic parameters .",
    "recently , andreev reflection at point contacts was used to extract values of the transport spin polarization @xmath1 out of spectra measured on superconductor / ferromagnet ( s / f ) contacts .",
    "@xcite however , different models  @xcite used to describe the transport through s / f interfaces yielded varying values for @xmath1 , also depending on the contact fabrication and the transport regime ,  @xcite an issue that is not yet understood in detail .",
    "@xcite therefore , a key issue in pcs is to determine the pc parameters , such as the form and diameter of the metallic nanobridge and the mean free path in the immediate contact region , so that one is able to identify the relevant transport regime . usually sharvin s @xcite or wexler s @xcite formulae for the ballistic and diffusive transport regime , respectively , are used to infer the pc diameter from the measured pc resistance .",
    "only very few experimental studies deal with the question whether these formulae - especially the interpolation formula in the diffusive regime - yield correct values for the pc diameter .    in this paper , we employ e - beam lithography to structure a nanometer - sized orifice into a free - standing insulating si@xmath2n@xmath3 membrane followed by metallization of both sides of the membrane to get a pb / fe contact with well - defined orifice size .",
    "a detailed characterization of heterocontacts with respect to contact size and geometry , structure , and local electronic parameters allows a direct comparison of the measured pc parameters to different contact - size estimates .",
    "we find that the theoretical approximation of the contact size is appropriate if the measured electronic mean free path of each individual contact region is used .",
    "the current assignment of the contact regime is facilitated by the analysis of the pc spectrum with features due to electron - phonon interaction or the pair - breaking critical current through the orifice .",
    "when considering electron transport through a circular microscopic constriction with diameter @xmath0 between two equal metallic reservoirs , different transport regimes have to be distinguished . in the ballistic regime where @xmath0 is much smaller than the elastic and inelastic electron mean free paths @xmath4 and @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) ,",
    "the electrons pass the constriction mostly without scattering .",
    "the resistance of a pc can be calculated according to sharvin  @xcite as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a material constant with fermi momentum @xmath9 , elementary charge @xmath10 , electron density @xmath11 , and the total mean free path @xmath12 obtained using matthiessen s rule . in the opposite case @xmath13 known as thermal limit where elastic and inelastic scattering takes place in the immediate contact region , the resistance can be calculated after maxwell  @xcite as @xmath14 when the transport is mainly diffusive with @xmath15 , wexler  @xcite derived an interpolation formula between the two regimes for the contact resistance @xmath16 where the maxwell term ( [ eq : maxwellres ] ) is weighted with a slowly varying , non - analytical function @xmath17 .",
    "this function can be approximated by using the pad fit .",
    "@xcite    based on these formulae , an estimate of the pc diameter @xmath0 can be obtained as long as the transport regime , the resistance @xmath18 and the pc parameters of the individual contact such as the local @xmath12 , and the local resistivity @xmath19 in the contact region are known .",
    "usually these parameters are not determined experimentally but the bulk values found in literature are used instead . for geometrically symmetric heterocontacts of two",
    "different metals 1 and 2 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are replaced by @xmath21 and by @xmath22 , respectively .",
    "@xcite    an alternative method to determine the local pc parameters and transport regimes _ individually _ for _ each _ pc arises from differentiation of eq.([eq : wexlerres ] ) . for a diffusive pc and under the assumption of dominant phonon scattering one gets @xmath23 valid in a region where both the pc resistance in the normalconducting state @xmath24 and the phonon contribution to the resistivity @xmath25 have the same functional temperature dependence . under further assumption that wexler s formula ( [ eq : wexlerres ] ) is valid and @xmath26 , we gain an estimate for the  at low temperatures dominant ",

    "( [ eq : akimenko1 ] ) and ( [ eq : akimenko2 ] ) could reproduce the intensity of theoretical phonon spectra .",
    "we fabricate pcs by structuring nanobridges between the two metallic reservoirs by means of e - beam lithography .",
    "this technique  originally developed by ralls  @xcite and used in a number of publications  @xcite  offers a variety of advantages compared to standard pc techniques like the needle - anvil or the shear method .",
    "first , mechanically stable contacts with small contact diameters down to a few nanometers can be obtained .",
    "furthermore , _ in situ _ preparation of the two metal reservoirs yields clean metal interfaces without oxide barriers .",
    "the main advantage is , however , that the geometry and size of the contacts are well defined through the orifice size which can be measured by scanning electron microscopy ( sem ) .    in brief",
    ", we follow the process described in ref .   to fabricate pb",
    "/ fe point contacts , including an additional experimental characterization step .",
    "a bowl - shaped hole is structured into a @xmath28 nm thick insulating non - stoichiometric silicon - nitride membrane ( si@xmath2n@xmath3 ) by using electron - beam lithography followed by isotropic reactive ion etching with sf@xmath29 .",
    "this leads to a smaller orifice in the membrane than originally structured into the pmma resist mask .",
    "the nanoholes in the membranes are analyzed prior to the pb / fe metallization by scanning electron microscopy .",
    "an approximately @xmath30 nm thick pt layer is sputtered onto the membranes .",
    "this step is inevitable because charging effects would otherwise destroy the insulating , free - standing membrane and because of the necessary high resolution .",
    "we measured the hole diameters in the membrane directly by using a zeiss supra 55 vp sem at small acceleration voltages of @xmath31kv , a @xmath32 m aperture and the secondary electron in - lens detector for high surface resolution and contrast .",
    "the silicon - nitride membranes are typically pierced for diameters less than @xmath33 nm , with the smallest orifices having a diameter of @xmath34 nm .",
    "[ fig : nanoholes](c ) and ( d ) show exemplarily two nanoholes with diameters of @xmath35 and @xmath36 nm . in these sem pictures , we can clearly distinguish a border between pt covered areas showing a granular structure and the interior part of the ` bowl ' , which we assume not to be pt covered . however , further investigations including a focused - ion - beam ( fib ) lateral cut through a smaller pc revealed that for smaller nanoholes ( @xmath37 nm ) pt might reduce the original hole diameter in the membrane by forming a ring of adsorbed material close to the rim of the hole . fig .",
    "[ fig : fibcut ] shows a fib lateral cut through a pc with a nominal diameter in the membrane of 24 nm , performed by successive @xmath31nm - distance lateral cuts with a ga - ion fib system .",
    "one can clearly see the layer geometry with the continuous pb layer , the `` bowl '' in the membrane and the corresponding fe / cu layer on the back side of the membrane .",
    "in addition , one can identify the possible effect of pt in narrowing the original constriction of the si@xmath2n@xmath3 membrane .",
    "thus the pt film is removed completely prior to metallization by immersing the sample in a @xmath38c hot bath of _ aqua regia _ for @xmath39h .",

    "a @xmath41 nm thick pb layer is deposited on the bowl - shaped side of the membrane by e - beam evaporation at room temperature under ultra - high vacuum ( @xmath42 mbar ) , followed by a @xmath43 _ in - situ _ rotation of the sample and the deposition of a @xmath44 nm thick fe layer , topped by a @xmath45 nm thick cu layer for a good ohmic contact on the flat side of the membrane ( see fig .

    ", the high mobility of the pb atoms leads to a stranski - krastanov - like island - growth mode .",
    "further sem analysis gave clear evidence for a continous pb film with average island sizes of @xmath46 nm , i.e. much larger than the typical pc size .",
    "each sample was characterized by measuring its resistance at room temperature in order to check whether a conductive nanobridge has been realized in the metallization process .",
    "it turned out that a nanobridge was only established in samples with hole diameters in the membrane larger than @xmath33 nm reliably .",
    "9 point contacts with hole diameters ranging from @xmath47 nm and resistances @xmath48 in the range of @xmath49 to @xmath50 were investigated ( see also table  [ table : contactradius ] ) .",

    "since the resistivity of thin metallic layers strongly depends on the layer thickness and the growth conditions , the same silicon nitride substrate , identical evaporation conditions and layer thicknesses as for the pcs were chosen .",
    "the reference samples had the form of meander - like bars with the dimensions of @xmath53 mm length , @xmath54 width ( see inset fig.[fig : reference ] ) , and @xmath55 nm or @xmath56 nm thickness for the fe and pb layer , respectively .",
    "in addition , the fe layer was covered _ in - situ _ with a @xmath57 nm thick insulating sio@xmath40 layer to avoid surface oxidation in air .",
    "resistance measurements were performed instantly after fabrication to reduce oxidation .",
    "sample geometries were determined afterwards by using sem for the width and length measurements and an ambios technology xp-2 profilometer in combination with layer - thickness monitors .",
    "the resistance @xmath18 of all samples was measured in the range of room temperature down to @xmath58k in a @xmath59he cryostat by using a lr-700 resistance bridge .",
    "the differential resistance @xmath60 vs applied bias voltage @xmath61 was recorded at low temperatures between @xmath62k and @xmath63k via lock - in technique .",
    "some measurements were done in an external magnetic field of @xmath64mt applied parallel to the current through the pc to drive the superconducting pb to the normalconducting state .",
    "from the @xmath65 measurements down to @xmath66k on the reference samples and pcs ( shown in fig.[fig : reference ] exemplarily for the pb reference sample and the pc sample 4 ) one obtains all necessary contact parameters . for the pb reference sample",
    "we obtain a residual resistance ratio @xmath67 , a critical temperature @xmath68k and the resistance in the normal - conducting state @xmath69 at @xmath70k . with the known geometry of the sample ,",
    "we calculate the resistivity of our @xmath41 nm thick pb layer at @xmath70k as @xmath71 m . for our @xmath44 nm thick fe layer",
    "we obtain @xmath72 , the averaged resistance @xmath73 and hence @xmath74 m at @xmath70k .",
    "both values agree well with those obtained on similar samples in the literature .",
    "@xcite according to ref .",
    ", the resistivity of a geometrical symmetric pb / fe heterocontact ( hc ) at @xmath70k is @xmath75 of course , @xmath76 is chiefly determined by the highly resistive fe layer . for further analysis",
    "we also need the material constants @xmath20 for the corresponding metals . here",
    ", we use the value @xmath77 for pb .",
    "@xcite from these values we obtain an electron mean free path in the pb layer of @xmath78 at @xmath70k , which is of the order of the island structure of the pb film .",
    "for fe , @xmath79 is calculated using the drude model with the charge carrier density  @xcite @xmath80 obtained from band - structure and de - haas - van - alphen measurements , and the fermi velocity  @xcite @xmath81 m/s .",
    "the magnitude of the electron mean free path @xmath82 nm clearly demonstrates that interface scattering plays the most important role in the @xmath44 nm thick fe layer . with these values",
    ", we calculate the arithmetic average of @xmath20 for a heterocontact as @xmath83 hence , the electron mean free path through the contact is estimated as @xmath84 nm .",
    "these values are usually used to allocate the transport regime .    to calculate pc diameters as suggested by akimenko _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite ( cf .",
    "eq.([eq : akimenko1 ] ) ) one needs additionally @xmath85 and @xmath86 of each individual pc as a function of @xmath87 .",
    "@xmath86 is determined by a linear fit for @xmath88k to the resistance data of the two reference samples whence @xmath89 in the range where @xmath90 .",
    "similarly , @xmath85 was determined individually for each pc for @xmath88k where @xmath91 as well .",
    "using equations ( [ eq : sharvinres ] ) to ( [ eq : wexlerres ] ) and the parameters given in section  [ analysisdata ] , we can determine the contact radius @xmath92 and allocate a transport regime to each individual contact .",
    "however , this method is problematic because it is based on the assumption of one universal electron mean free path @xmath93 nm fixed for all pcs . for example , the calculation would result in much larger contact radii @xmath94 nm respectively 58 nm for samples 3 and 4 , respectively , than the measured upper limits @xmath95 nm and accordingly 35 nm .",
    "in reality , the electron mean free path in the immediate region of the nanobridge may differ from sample to sample due to the granular structure of the films and the growth process of the nanobridge which usually is not controlled on the atomic level . the advantage of the second approach following akimenko _ et al . _",
    "@xcite is that the t dependence of the contact resistance @xmath48 enters the calculation .",
    "it provides a more realistic insight into the dominant scattering processes that determine the pc resistance .",
    "we therefore employ akimenko s  @xcite approach using eq .",
    "( [ eq : akimenko1 ] )  which can be applied nearly independently for contacts in the diffusive regime  and eq .",
    "( [ eq : akimenko2 ] ) to calculate the pc parameters @xmath96 and @xmath4 for each individual pc with the parameters given in subsection  [ analysisdata ] . table  [ table : contactradius ] summarizes those values and the allocated transport regimes for all measured samples together with @xmath48 and the measured hole radii @xmath97 .",
    "in addition , the last column displays the pc radii @xmath98 calculated by equations ( [ eq : sharvinres])-([eq : wexlerres ] ) when taking the correct contact regime and elastic mean free path @xmath4 determined by akimenko s approach into account which furnishes a self - consistency check of the method .",
    "indeed , the elastic mean free path in the immediate contact region varies from sample to sample and for some samples differs significantly from @xmath99 calculated in the former paragraph .",
    "the main reason for the variation is probably a difference in grain structure of the immediate contact region caused by the island growth of the pb film which tends to increase the mean free path in larger contacts .",
    "the analysis also shows that the low - resistive pb part of the heterocontact is decisive for the pc properties and prevails over the highly resistive fe part .",
    "most of our samples seem to belong to the diffusive ( ` d ' ) regime with some being closer to the ballistic limit  labeled as ` b ' in table  [ table : contactradius ] - some being closer to the thermal limit - indicated as ` t ' .",
    "for very small @xmath96 wexler s equation ( [ eq : wexlerres ] ) is no longer valid and eq .",
    "( [ eq : akimenko2 ] ) may yield unphysical negative values of @xmath4 .",
    "the corresponding samples can be assigned to the pure ballistic regime ( samples 6 and 7 ) .",
    "for these samples , the sharvin formula does indeed yield reliable values for @xmath96 .    [",

    "[ fig : comparisonradius ] , the contact radii @xmath98 derived from the self - consistency check yield nearly the same values for the pc radius @xmath96 when taking the correct transport regime and the locally determined @xmath4 into account .",
    "the calculated radii are always somewhat smaller than those of the holes in the membranes , but do seem to follow the same general experimental trend . when recalling the sample fabrication process , it seems obvious that the metals will not completely fill the holes in the membranes during the evaporation process - thus leading to narrower _ metallic _ nanobridges .",
    "the sem measurement yields an upper limit for the effective pc radius .",
    "statistical variations of the contact size can be attributed due to the rather uncontrolled nature of the aggregation process at the atomic level following the evaporation .",
    "hence , the exact geometry of establishing a nanobridge can not be controlled .",
    "finally , we want to emphasize that experimentally determined values only enter into the determination of the pc radius .",
    "the very good agreement of those calculations with the experimental trend shows _ directly _ for metallic heterocontacts that frequently used size estimates for pc diameters do agree with the experimental data and yield reasonable values for those parameters .",
    "however , extreme care has to be taken when characterizing the samples .",
    "pc spectra have been recorded at different temperatures and in an applied magnetic field @xmath64mt which proved to be sufficient to drive the superconducting pb into the normalconducting state at lowest @xmath58k .",

    ", we observe an overall rise in the differential resistance and changing slopes which can be interpreted as due to electron - phonon scattering in pb ( 2 ) , and a rather sharp peak in the superconducting state of pb at higher energies @xmath104 that scales with temperature is attributed to the current through the contact exceeding the pair - breaking critical current ( 3 ) .",
    "features of andreev reflection with the possibility to extract @xmath102 can be found even for rather ill - defined pcs .",
    "the nonlinearities caused by ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) , on the other hand , depend sensitively on the quality of the pc .",
    "k. in addition to the andreev signature ( 1 ) in the middle part of the spectrum , we observe a rise and change of slope ( 2 ) of @xmath105 as well as a sharp peak ( 3 ) on this rise . ]",
    "[ fig : phononspectra ] exemplarily shows the second derivative @xmath106 vs. @xmath61 spectra of samples 2 and 4 , recorded at @xmath58k and @xmath107mt where pb is in the normal state .",
    "@xmath106 vs. @xmath61 spectra are obtained by numerical differentiation of the measured @xmath108 data .",
    "typically , the data have to be averaged over 20 - 30 data points to reduce the noise .",
    "the second derivative @xmath106 is proportional to the eliashberg function @xmath109 , where for heterocontacts the spectrum is a sum of contributions of both pb and fe .",
    "@xcite for low energies , predominantly the phonon excitations of pb are expected while the contributions of fe will be significant at higher energies @xmath110mev only .",
    "@xcite indeed , we identify features indicated by arrows for sample 4 at @xmath111mv , which are ascribed to transverse acoustic ( ta ) phonons of pb .",
    "@xcite in contrast , only a broad feature is seen in the spectrum of sample 2 .",
    "the broadening is a direct consequence of the reduced mean free path , corresponding to a knudsen ratio @xmath112 , of this particular sample . in the diffusive regime ,",
    "the intensity of the peaks depends on the knudsen ratio .",

    "arrows indicate the position of ta phonon peaks in pb . ]",
    "we note that we observe a shift of the peak positions to higher energies on the order of the energy gap @xmath115mev and a peak intensity which is nearly independent of the contact regime when pb is in the superconducting state , in agreement with theory  @xcite and earlier experiments .",
    "@xcite    the second feature which supports the allocation of the transport regimes is the sharp peak in the differential resistance spectra at higher bias @xmath116 when pb is in the superconducting state ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : overviewspectr ] , ( 3 ) ) .",
    "it is observed for all our pcs .",
    "the dc current @xmath117 at the peak position , simultaneously recorded as a function of @xmath87 , scales with the superconducting order parameter in bcs theory ( see inset in fig .  [",

    "the position @xmath121 of the peaks varies depending on the contact geometry and can often be found at voltages as high as @xmath122mv at lowest @xmath87 . as discussed above , our fabrication process results in a controlled pc geometry , where  in our specific sample geometry  pb establishing the contact grows in a cylindrical shape into the nanohole ( see fig .
