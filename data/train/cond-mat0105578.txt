    "<S> recent experiments show the thermal growth of dislocation lines in unlta - pure bcc @xmath0he . </S>",
    "<S> the activation energy for the growth of the dislocation lines is found to agree with the activation energy of mass diffusion . </S>",
    "<S> we propose that these dislocations are topological defects in the phase of the complex order - parameter which describes the dynamic zero - point atomic correlations , unique to the bcc phase . </S>",
    "<S> these is a shear strain field associated with these topological defects . we show that the smallest topological defect is a localized excitation , a loop - defect , which leads to the exponential growth of the dislocation lines with temperature .    </S>",
    "<S> pacs numbers : 67.80-s,67.80.cx,67.80.mg    recent experiments @xcite show the thermal growth of dislocation lines in ultra - pure bcc @xmath0he , interpreted within the dislocation theory of granato and lcke @xcite . the activation energy for the growth of dislocation network </S>",
    "<S> is found to agree with the activation energy of mass diffusion @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is in contrast with the case of hcp @xmath1he , where only pinning of dislocations to @xmath2he impurities was observed @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is the quantum nature of the dislocations in the pure bcc phase which we shall describe in this paper .    </S>",
    "<S> we have previously proposed a new model for the description of the quantum correlations in the bcc phase of solid helium @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this model introduces a new complex order parameter which describes the phase of the dynamic zero - point oscillations of the atoms . </S>",
    "<S> these zero - point oscillations are highly directional along the normal ( ( 100),(010),(001 ) ) axes of the bcc phase and result in dynamic polarization of the electronic clouds , i.e. @xmath3 level mixing of the order of @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the oscillating electric dipole moments are correlated in a long - range order to lower the ground - state energy ( fig.1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is a state with off - diagonal long range order ( odlro ) @xcite , with a broken gauge symmetry in the form of a global phase of the oscillating dipoles . </S>",
    "<S> a flipping of a dipole out of this ordered ground - state , i.e. giving it a phase shift of @xmath5 , is treated as a local - mode of energy @xmath6 , which is twice the dipolar interaction energy . </S>",
    "<S> the dipoles are simultaneously arranged along the three orthogonal axes , and form a coherent state with a complex order - parameter having 3 independent phases for each of the normal axes @xcite . in the hcp phase </S>",
    "<S> we do not expect such a long - range coherent order to form since the triangular symmetry frustrates the dipolar interactions    the effect of these interacting local dipoles is to couple ( hybridize ) with the harmonic transverse phonon which has the same symmetry as the dipolar order of fig.1 , which turns out to be only the t@xmath7(110 ) phonon . </S>",
    "<S> the result of this hybridization @xcite is to soften this harmonic phonon by a factor of 2 , and create a new localized ( i.e. dispersionless ) excitation of twice the bare local - mode energy : @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> the nature of this excitation @xcite is shown in fig.2 . </S>",
    "<S> this excitation involves a local flipping of the phase of the dipoles , which is spread over approximately two unit cells . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting `` breathing '' motion will lower the barrier for atoms to exchange and this excitation is therefore involved in the thermal activation of mass diffusion in bcc helium . since the t@xmath7(110 ) phonon is a shear wave , the flipping of a dipole out of the ground - state , introduces a local shear . the shear degree of freedom is introduced into the hybridization through the harmonic transverse phonon @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we will now show that the localized excitation of energy @xmath8 is a shear - dipole , i.e. a microscopic analogue of a vortex - loop . in the hybridization procedure of the dipoles and the harmonic t@xmath7(110 ) shear phonon @xcite , we found that the two excitation branches have ground - state occupation of local - modes ( dipole flips ) and harmonic phonons @xmath9 where the functions @xmath10 are described in [ @xcite ] , and the operators @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the creation / annihilation operators of the local - mode and harmonic phonon respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the subscript 1 and 2 stands for the soft ( i.e. hybridized ) t@xmath7(110 ) phonon and the localized @xmath8 branch respectively . from ( [ psi0hyb ] ) </S>",
    "<S> the occupation number of local - modes in the lower branch diverges at @xmath13 as : @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the velocity of the soft t@xmath7(110 ) phonon . </S>",
    "<S> this signals condensation in a bose system @xcite , which in this low energy limit shows the odlro in this system . </S>",
    "<S> similarly the number of harmonic shear - modes occupation diverges for @xmath13 in the localized branch . </S>",
    "<S> such occupation of pairs of @xmath16 shear modes ( [ psi0hyb ] ) with @xmath17 divergency is equivalent to a @xmath18 shear field , which coincides with the large @xmath19 field around a localized shear dipole ( fig.2 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> epsf    3.0 cm    we shall now turn to describe topological defects of macroscopic length in the dipolar order of fig.1 . </S>",
    "<S> in general , a complex order - parameter can support linear topological defects around which the coherent phase changes by @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> this is the case in superfluid @xmath1he and s - wave superconductors @xcite . in our case </S>",
    "<S> we can treat each component of the 3 orthogonal dipoles as an independent order - parameter . concentrating on one axis </S>",
    "<S> , a linear topological defect appears as a complex phase in the dipole - dipole interaction energy of the atom at @xmath21 @xmath22    \\exp \\left [ i\\cdot \\theta\\left ( { \\bf r}_{vort}-{\\bf r}_{i}\\right ) \\right ] \\label{edipole}\\ ] ]    where the sum is over all the atoms in the lattice , @xmath23 being the coordinate of the @xmath24-th atom and @xmath25 is the coherently oscillating electric dipole moment along one of the normal axes @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the geometrical phase @xmath26 is just the azimuthal angle and changes by @xmath20 around the defect s axis ( located at @xmath27 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we have calculated by numerical summation ( [ edipole ] ) the radial dependence of the dipolar energy cost per atom , for various linear defects in the bcc lattice ( fig.3 ) , with respect to the ground - state of fig.1 . </S>",
    "<S> we found for a defect with @xmath28 , that the energy cost per atom at radius @xmath29 is @xmath30 the values of the numerical prefactor @xmath31 will be different for various defects , due to the dipolar energy form ( [ edipole ] ) , and are given in fig.3 . the form of the energy ( [ edipolecont ] ) is what we expect from a continuum model where the dipolar energy is simply proportional to the scalar product of the nearest - neighbor dipoles . </S>",
    "<S> this form is the same as that for the kinetic energy around a linear vortex in superfluid @xmath1he @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> in addition to linear defects , which have to terminate at the system s surface , there can be loop - defects ( again similar to vortex - loops in superfluid @xcite @xmath1he ) . </S>",
    "<S> the energy cost of a loop - defect of radius @xmath29 in a continuum model @xcite is @xmath32    where the local - mode energy is defined to be @xcite : @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> the smallest such loop should have radius of approximately one unit cell , where the continuum limit is already suspect . </S>",
    "<S> fortunately in our previous treatment we have found a localized excitation of exactly the nature of the smallest loop - defect . </S>",
    "<S> this is the excitation we have discussed above ( fig.2 ) , in relation to mass - diffusion . </S>",
    "<S> the dipolar phase changes by @xmath34 ( with respect to the ground - state phase ) when passing through this excitation along the ( 110 ) direction . </S>",
    "<S> the dipolar phase changes by @xmath5 due to the first dipole - flip and then by a second @xmath5 due to the second dipole - flip ( fig.4 ) . </S>",
    "<S> it has the form of a topological defect of the kind marked ( a ) in fig.3 , curled into the smallest possible loop . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , using this excitation s energy @xmath8 in ( [ eloop ] ) we get a loop radius of @xmath35 , as we expect from the smallest loop - defect .    </S>",
    "<S> we now come to the recent experimental results @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these results show that the dislocation network and loops have a length which grows exponentially with temperature , even in ultrapure crystals . </S>",
    "<S> the activation energy for this dislocation growth is @xmath36k at v=24.3 cm@xmath2/mole . </S>",
    "<S> this energy agrees with the value @xmath8 , as measured in various experiments for mass diffusion and specific - heat @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore conclude that the dislocations measured in ultrapure bcc @xmath2he are in fact topological defects in the phase of the coherent zero - point dipoles . these linear defects will grow and lengthen due to thermal activation of small loop - defects of energy @xmath8 ( fig.4 ) .    in the ultrapure hcp phase </S>",
    "<S> there was no measurement of such effect , only the weak influence of thermal phonons @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this difference between the two phases fits our interpretation , since due to geometric frustration we do not expect a similar complex order - parameter to exist in the hcp phase @xcite .    to summarize </S>",
    "<S> , we have shown that the novel phase of bcc he , which has a complex order - parameter , can support topological defects of microscopic and macroscopic sizes . </S>",
    "<S> these defects will behave similar to a network of dislocation lines , and their total length increase with the thermal activation of microscopic loop - defects . </S>",
    "<S> this explains the different experimental measurements in bcc and hcp phases . to conclude we point to possible experimental verifications of the proposed model . </S>",
    "<S> it follows from our description that in ultrapure bcc @xmath2he at different molar volumes the dislocation network is thermally activated with the same energy as found in mass - diffusion and specific - heat measurements @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this prediction can be checked in future experiments . finally , </S>",
    "<S> in the spin - ordered bcc @xmath2he , we expect the topological defects to have a nuclear spin - structure , due to the proposed relation between the zero - point atomic motion and the nuclear spin - ordering phenomenon @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . these dislocations may be therefore detectable using magnetic probes such as nmr . </S>"
