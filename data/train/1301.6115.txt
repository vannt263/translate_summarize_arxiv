    "specifically , at time @xmath12 a bank - firm pair is chosen randomly , and the following actions take place :    * banks and firms repay loans issued at time @xmath13 * firms realize profits or losses ( consumption ) * banks pay interest to households * firms request loans * households re - distribute cash obtained from firms * liquidity management of banks in the ib market , including : ib re - payments , firm - loan requests , defaulted firms , and re - distribution effects from households * firms pay salaries and make investments * firms or banks default if equity- or liquidity problems arise    a new bank - firm pair is picked until all are updated ( random sequential update ) ; then timestep @xmath14 follows .    during the simulation , firms and banks may be unable to pay their debts and thus become insolvent .",

    "in contrast , if a bank borrows from a systemically dangerous node the borrower inherits part of this risk , and increases the overall systemic risk .",
    "these facts are conveniently incorporated in the definition of debt- and katz rank .",
    "we found that the performance of the method is surprisingly insensitive to the choice of the particular centrality measure , or whether the actual topology of the ib network ( scale - free or random ) .",
    "also the average connectivity @xmath86 of the network is not relevant , as long as it remains in sensible regions ( @xmath87 $ ] ) .",
    "this suggests that the essence of the proposed scheme is that risk is spread more evenly across the network , which practically eliminates cascading failures .",
