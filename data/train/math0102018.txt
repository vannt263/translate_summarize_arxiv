    "the hypothesis ( h1 ) could be weakened , see @xcite , but here we prefer to use a simpler framework . in formulating ( h2 )",
    "we used the embedding of @xmath36 into @xmath43range@xmath44 given by @xmath45 .",
    "such an hypothesis is then equivalent to the denseness , in @xmath5 , of the set @xmath46 .",
    "indeed there exists @xmath47 such that @xmath48 if and only if there exists @xmath49 ( necessarily orthogonal to kernel@xmath4 ) such that for any @xmath50 one has @xmath51 .",
    "the advantage of the formula given in @xcite over other approaches ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and references therein ) is its relative simplicity , being expressed directly in terms of the map @xmath13 ; moreover the domain of definition of @xmath6 can be described , interpreting the map @xmath13 as a trace ( restriction ) operator , in terms of a sort of boundary conditions ( see [ * 19 * , remark 2.10 ] ) . in the case",
    "@xmath52 , @xmath53 denoting the spectrum of @xmath25 , this description becomes particularly expressive since @xmath54 can be simply defined by the original operator applied to the regular component of @xmath8 .",
    "such a regular component @xmath55 is univocally determined by the natural decomposition which enter in the definition of @xmath56 and it has to satisfy the boundary condition @xmath57 more precisely , by ( h1 ) , ( h2 ) and by [ * 19 * , lemma 2.2 , thm .",

    "2.1 , remarks 2.10 , 2.12 ] , we have the following    let @xmath0 be self - adjoint with @xmath52 , let @xmath1 be continuous and satisfy ( h1 ) and ( h2 ) .",
    "if @xmath58 is self - adjoint , @xmath59 and @xmath60 then the linear operator @xmath61 is self - adjoint and coincides with @xmath25 on the kernel of @xmath13 ; the decomposition entering in the definition of its domain is unique .",
    "its resolvent is given by @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath64    by ( h1 ) one has @xmath65 and so @xmath66 this implies that @xmath2 inherits a hilbert space structure and we could then identify @xmath16 with @xmath2 .",
    "even if this gives some advantage ( see [ * 19 * , remarks 2.13 - 2.16 , lemma 2.4 ] ) here we prefer to use only the banach space structure of @xmath2 .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to extend the above theorem to the case in which @xmath25 is merely injective .",
    "thus , denoting the pure point spectrum of @xmath25 by @xmath67 , we require @xmath68 but we do not exclude the case @xmath69 ; this is a typical situation when @xmath25 is a differential operator on @xmath19 . in order to carry out this program",
    "we will suppose that the map @xmath13 has a continuos extension to @xmath70 , the completion of @xmath11 with respect to the norm @xmath12 ( note that @xmath71 when @xmath52 ) .",
    "this further hypothesis allows then to perform the limit @xmath72 ( see lemma 3 ) ; thus an analogue on the above theorem 1 is obtained ( see theorem 5 ) .",
    "such an abstract construction is successively specialized to the case in which @xmath18 is a convolution operator on @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is a distribution with compact support ( so that this comprises the case of differential - difference operators ) . in this situation",
    "the results obtained in theorem 5 can be made more appealing ( see theorem 11 ) .",
    "the case in which @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and @xmath13 is the trace ( restriction ) operator along a @xmath75-set with a compact closure of zero lebesgue measure , @xmath76 , is explicitly studied ( see example 14 ) .",
    "of course , since @xmath77 is not negative , in this case one could apply theorem 1 to @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and then define @xmath80 .",
    "however this alternative definition looks a bit artificial and has the drawback of giving rise to boundary conditions which depend on the arbitrary parameter @xmath81 .",
