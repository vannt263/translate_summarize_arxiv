    "understanding the sea - quark structure of the nucleon has long been a central topic in nuclear physics  @xcite .",
    "of particular interest are the contributions of the @xmath4 component since the nucleon contains no valence strange quarks , e.g. , the strangeness contribution to the proton spin  @xcite and to the electric and magnetic form factors  @xcite . in this context",
    ", the strangeness - nucleon sigma term , @xmath5 , plays an important role as it relates to the scalar strangeness content of the nucleon , the composition of the nucleon mass , @xmath6 scatterings , counting rates in higgs boson searches  @xcite , and the precise measurement of the standard model parameters in @xmath7 collisions at the lhc  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the uncertainty in @xmath3 is the principal source in predicting the cross section of certain candidate dark matter particles interacting with the nucleons  @xcite .    although the pion - nucleon sigma term @xmath8 can be determined from pion - nucleon scattering  @xcite , historically the strangeness - nucleon sigma term has been determined indirectly via the nonsinglet matrix element @xmath9 , which yields a value ranging from 0 to 300 mev  @xcite . in principle ,",
    "lattice quantum chromodynamics ( lqcd ) provides a model independent way in the determination of the baryon sigma terms by either computing three - point  @xcite or two - point correlation functions ( the so - called spectrum method )  @xcite .",
    "although tremendous efforts have been made in this endeavor , due to the many systematic and statistical uncertainties inherent in these studies , no consensus has been reached on the value of the scalar strangeness content of the nucleon .",
    "the most important sources of systematic uncertainties originate from the so - called chiral extrapolations . in the @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 flavor sector ,",
    "a proper formulation of baryon chiral perturbation theory ( bchpt ) that satisfies all symmetry and analyticity constraints is known to be essential to properly describe the nonperturbative regime of qcd . in this sense ,",
    "the extended - on - mass - shell ( eoms ) formulation  @xcite has shown a number of both formal and practical advantages , whose applications have solved a number of long - existing puzzles in the one - baryon sector  @xcite .",
    "its applications in the studies of the lqcd octet baryon masses turn out to be very successful as well  @xcite . furthermore ,",
    "as demonstrated recently , mass dependent and mass independent lattice scale setting methods can result in a @xmath3 different by a factor of three  @xcite , therefore , it casts doubts on the determination of the @xmath3 from a single data set with a particular scale setting method .",
    "to say the least , systematic uncertainties might be well underestimated .    in this article , utilizing the latest and high - statistics @xmath0 lqcd simulations of the octet baryon masses from the pacs - cs  @xcite , lhpc  @xcite , and qcdsf - ukqcd  @xcite collaborations and the feynman - hellmann theorem , paying special attention to the lattice scale setting , we report a determination of the baryon sigma terms , particularly the strangeness - nucleon sigma term , in covariant bchpt up to next - to - next - to - next - to - leading order ( n@xmath13lo ) .",
    "the feynman - hellmann theorem  @xcite dictates that at the isospin limit the baryon sigma terms can be calculated from the quark mass dependence of the octet baryon masses , @xmath14 , in the following way : @xmath15 up to @xmath16 in the chiral expansion , @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the su(3 ) chiral limit octet baryon mass , and @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 represent the @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath16 chiral contributions  @xcite .",
    "the virtual decuplet contributions are not explicitly included in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mb ] ) , since their effects on the chiral extrapolation and finite - volume corrections ( fvcs ) are shown to be relatively small  @xcite .    at n@xmath13lo",
    ", there are @xmath24 unknown low energy constants ( lecs ) ( @xmath18 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 ) in eq .   to be determined by fitting the lqcd data  @xcite , and the others",
    "are fixed at the following values : @xmath30 , @xmath31  @xcite , @xmath32 gev  @xcite , and @xmath33 gev .",
    "it should be stressed that in the present work the lqcd baryon masses only serve as inputs to fix the relevant lecs of the bchpt .",
    "once the lecs are known , bchpt completely determines the derivatives of the baryon masses with respect to the light @xmath34 ( strange ) quark mass with the strange ( light ) quark mass fixed , thus yielding the desired baryon sigma terms .",
    "in order to obtain an accurate determination of the baryon sigma terms , a careful examination of the lqcd data is essential , since not all of them are of the same quality though they are largely consistent with each other as shown in refs .",
    "@xcite . for instance , the statistics of the hsc simulations needs to be improved  @xcite while the nplqcd simulations are performed at one single combination of light - quark and strange - quark masses  @xcite , which offers little constraint on the quark mass dependence of the baryon masses .",
    "the bmw simulations  @xcite , though of high quality , are not publicly available .",
    "this leaves the pacs - cs  @xcite , lhpc  @xcite , and qcdsf - ukqcd  @xcite data for our study .",
    "it is important to note that most lqcd simulations fix the strange - quark mass close to its physical value and vary the light - quark masses . as a result",
    ", they are suitable to study the light - quark mass dependence but not the strange - quark mass dependence . in this respect ,",
    "the qcdsf - ukqcd simulations are of particular importance because they provide a dependence of the baryon masses on the strange - quark mass in a region not accessible in other simulations . in order to stay within the application region of the bchpt",
    ", we only choose the lqcd data satisfying the following two criteria : @xmath35 mev   down to @xmath36 mev or @xmath37 mev has little effect on our numerical results , but since our @xmath38 ( see table i ) is already about 1 , there is no need to further decrease the cut on @xmath39 . ] and @xmath40 , as in refs .",
    "it should be noted that the later criterium is relaxed for the qcdsf - ukqcd data taken into account is 2.932 .",
    "] since their fvcs are small because of the use of the ratio method  @xcite .",
    "a second issue relates to the scale setting of lqcd simulations ( for a recent review , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . for the spectrum determination of the baryon sigma terms ,",
    "it was pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite that using the sommer scale @xmath41  @xcite to fix the lattice spacing of the pacs - cs data can change the prediction of the strangeness - nucleon sigma term by a factor of two to three in the finite - range regularization ( frr ) bchpt up to next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) .",
    "it was claimed that using @xmath42 for the purpose of lattice scale setting is preferred in the lhpc simulations  @xcite as well . as a result , it is necessary to understand how different scale setting methods for the same simulations affect the prediction of the baryon sigma terms .",
    "unfortunately , such a systematic study is still missing .",
    "in addition , instead of relying on the scale determined by the lqcd collaborations themselves , one can fix the lattice scale self - consistently in the bchpt study of the lqcd dimensionless data , as recently done in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the present work ,",
    "all the three alternative ways of lattice scale setting will be studied and their effects on the predicted sigma terms examined and quantified .",
    ".values of the lecs from the best fits to the lqcd data and the experimental octet baryon masses up to n@xmath13lo .",
    "the lattice scale in each simulation is determined using both the mass independent scale setting ( mis ) and the mds methods . in the mis ,",
    "both the original lattice spacings determined by the lqcd collaborations themselves `` @xmath43 fixed '' and the self - consistently determined lattice spacings `` @xmath43 free '' are used ( see text for details ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "at n@xmath13lo , the lqcd and experimental meson masses are described by the next - to - leading order chpt  @xcite with the lecs of ref .",

    "[ tab : n3lolecs ] , we tabulate the lecs and the corresponding @xmath38 from three best fits to the lqcd mass data and the experimental octet baryon masses . in the first fit , we use the lattice spacings @xmath43 determined by the lqcd collaborations themselves to obtain the hadron masses in physical units as done in ref .  @xcite . in the second fit",
    ", we determine the lattice spacings @xmath43 self - consistently .",
    "interestingly , we find that the so - determined lattice spacings @xmath43 are close to the ones determined by the lqcd collaborations themselves .",
    "specifically , the pacs - cs deviation is 2.5% , the lhpc deviation is 4.1% , and the qcdsf - ukqcd deviation is 2.1% .",
    "the corresponding @xmath38 also look similar . while in the third fit",
    ", we adopt the so - called mass dependent scale setting ( mds ) , either from @xmath41 for the pacs - cs data with @xmath44 fm  @xcite , @xmath42 for the lhpc data with @xmath45 fm  @xcite  , or @xmath46 for the qcdsf - ukqcd data with @xmath47 gev  @xcite .",
    "the third fit yields a smaller @xmath38 and different lecs compared to the other two fits .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : bmw ] , we show the octet baryon masses as functions of @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) using the lecs from table  [ tab : n3lolecs ] with the physical light- ( right panel ) and strange - quark ( left panel ) masses . in order to cross -",
    "check the validity of our n@xmath13lo bchpt fit , the bmw collaboration data  @xcite are shown as well .",
    "it is clear that our three fits yield similar results and are all consistent with the high - quality bmw data , which are not included in our fits .",
    "using the best fit lecs , we predict the sigma terms of the octet baryons and tabulate the results in table  [ tab : n3losigma ] .",
    "our predictions given by the lecs of table  [ tab : n3lolecs ] are consistent with each other within uncertainties , and the scale setting effects on the sigma terms seem to be small .",
    "therefore , we take the central values from the fit to the mass independent @xmath43 fixed lqcd simulations as our final results , and treat the difference between different lattice scale settings as systematic uncertainties , which are given in the second parenthesis of the second column of table  [ tab : n3losigma ] .",
    "it is clear that for @xmath50 , uncertainties due to scale setting are dominant , while for @xmath3 statistics errors are much larger , calling for improved lqcd simulations .",
    "it should be noted that we have studied the effects of virtual decuplet baryons and variation of the lecs @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and the renormalization scale @xmath54 , and found that the induced uncertainties are negligible compared to those shown in table  [ tab : n3losigma ] .",
    "furthermore , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , continuum extrapolations have no visible effects on the predicted sigma terms .",
    "the pion - nucleon sigma term , @xmath1 mev , is in reasonable agreement with the latest @xmath55 scattering study , @xmath56 mev  @xcite , and also the systematic study of @xmath0 lqcd simulations on the nucleon mass , @xmath57 mev  @xcite , but larger than that of ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath58 mev .",
    "our predicted @xmath3 is compared with those of earlier studies in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigma_s ] , classified into three groups according to the methods by which they are determined .",
    "the first group is the results reported by the @xmath0 lqcd simulations , while the second and third groups are predicted by the nnlo and n@xmath13lo bchpt , respectively .",
    "our results are consistent with the latest lqcd determinations and those of nnlo bchpt studies .",
    "it should be noted that , however , the prediction of the only other n@xmath13lo study in the partial summation approach  @xcite is not consistent with our result and most lqcd results .",
    "a note of caution is in order .",
    "clearly , using the spectrum method to determine the baryon sigma terms depends critically on the details of the lqcd simulations .",
    "lattice scale setting is just one of the sources for potentially large systematic errors . in the present work ,",
    "we have studied three common alternative strategies and found that the resulting predictions remain almost the same .",
    "nevertheless , our studies do not exclude the possibility that predictions can change in more rare scenarios .",
    "in addition , other lqcd artifacts not addressed in the present work that affect little the baryon masses may have an impact on the predicted baryon sigma terms , which is , however , beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "lo results , respectively .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",width=302 ] +",
    "given the fact that bchpt plays an important role in predicting the baryon sigma terms , it is of particular importance to assess the uncertainties of truncating chiral expansions .",
    "it becomes even more important in the @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 three - flavor sector , where convergence is governed by the relative large ratio of @xmath59 .",
    "previous studies either stayed at nnlo or n@xmath13lo and , therefore , were unable to perform such an analysis except those of refs .",
    "@xcite , which , however , focused on a global study of the baryon masses and did not include all the qcdsf - ukqcd data that provide further constraints on the strange - quark mass dependence of the octet baryon masses .",
    "to understand quantitatively the convergence issue , we have studied at nnlo the octet baryon masses of the pacs - cs , lhpc and qcdsf - ukqcd data obtained with the lattice spacings @xmath43 given by the lqcd collaborations themselves .",
    "we have allowed the lec @xmath53 and the renormalization scale @xmath54 to vary to get an estimation of the induced variation .",
    "all the obtained @xmath38 is larger than 1 , indicating that higher - order chiral contributions need to be taken into account .",
    "in addition , we have employed the frr method , which is known to converge relatively faster , to study the same data and found no qualitative difference from the eoms approach .",
    "we noted that if one allows the @xmath53 to deviate from the chiral limit value to take into account su(3 ) breaking effects , the so - obtained @xmath53 is close to its su(3 ) average @xmath60 with @xmath61 mev  @xcite . the predicted strangeness - nucleon sigma term is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigma_s ] .",
    "it is clear that the nnlo result has a much smaller uncertainty compared to the n@xmath13lo one mainly because the lecs are over constrained by the lqcd simulations .",
    "it should be mentioned that in the feynman - hellmann method the large @xmath62 multiplying the derivative enhances the uncertainty in the determination of the strangeness - baryon sigma term , which seems to dominate the uncertainty and therefore puts an upper limit in the precision one can achieve .",
    "in this work , we have performed a determination of the octet baryon sigma terms using the covariant baryon chiral perturbation theory up to next - to - next - to - next - to - leading order .",
    "we found @xmath1 mev and @xmath2 mev .",
    "special attention was paid to uncertainties induced by the lattice scale setting method , which , however , were found to be small , in contrast with previous studies .",
    "other uncertainties , such as those induced by truncating chiral expansions and variations of lecs were also studied in detail . in addition , we have used the strong - interaction isospin - splitting effects from the lqcd simulations to further constrain the relevant lecs .",
    "our results indicate a small scalar strangeness content in the nucleon , consistent with the strangeness contribution to the proton spin and to the electromagnetic form factors of the nucleon .",
