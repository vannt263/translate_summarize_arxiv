    "observations of the cosmic microwave background find that the primordial spectrum of the metric perturbations is given by@xcite @xmath1 the most widely studied theory that explains this spectrum is inflation ( see @xcite",
    ". for a different point of view see @xcite ) .",
    "inflation accounts for this spectrum by introducing a new length scale into the problem : the hubble radius of the inflating universe . when the wave length of a mode of the inflaton becomes larger than the hubble scale the evolution of the mode effectively stops .",
    "the amplitude of the field at the moment of horizon crossing determines the amplitude of the perturbation . because inflation has to end the hubble scale changes at the end of inflation .",
    "it is this changing hubble scale that is responsible for the tilt in the above spectrum . to achieve this exit a particular potential for the inflaton has to be postulated .",
    "instead of postulating a new particle and a very special potential for it we propose that a phase transition in the early universe is the reason for the spectrum of equation ( [ eqn : spectrum ] ) .",
    "phase transitions in the early universe are nothing new .",
    "it is widely believed that we arrived at the current gauge group of the standard model by a series of symmetry breaking processes . unlike the transition that we are thinking about here though these processes happened in ordinary spacetime .",
    "we are instead talking about a more radical kind of phase transition ; namely a transition in which space itself emerged . on this side of the transition we have our well known notions of space and elementary particles whereas on the other side of the transition space and particles are completely different or do not exist at all .",
    "let us describe the process that we have in mind .",
    "we start with the system ( the universe ) in its unordered phase at a temperature @xmath2 above a critical temperature @xmath3 .",
    "as we approach the transition temperature the correlation length @xmath4 and the relaxation time @xmath5 both grow .",
    "if we define @xmath6 then the behavior of @xmath4 and @xmath5 near the transition is given by @xcite @xmath7 for some critical exponents @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "at some point the rate of change @xmath10 will exceed the inverse relaxation time @xmath11 . at this point the evolution of the system freezes .",
    "let us call the correlation length of the system at this point @xmath12 .",
    "the evolution of the system will not continue again until we have passed the transition temperature @xmath3 and the rate of change is again smaller than the inverse relaxation time in the new phase @xcite .",
    "what happens now is the crucial part in the derivation of the spectrum .",
    "the system will relax to a ground state in the correlated domains of size @xmath12 .",
    "if the transition is a symmetry breaking transition this is the moment the symmetry brakes .",
    "we are then left with domains of size @xmath12 that each represent a different ground state .",
    "the spectrum that we are after is the result of this transition to the new ground state . before the transition we have a distribution of regions of all orientations and sizes up to @xmath12 . in the transition some of these smaller regions have to flip to form the new ground state",
    "this flipping of the smaller regions will leave behind perturbations in the newly formed ground state that carry the signature of the state of the system just before the transition . if @xmath13 is an order parameter than we want to calculate the spectrum @xmath14 of the order parameter just before the transition .",
    "we will show that this spectrum is naturally scale free : @xmath15 in turns out that this is not the whole story",
    ". this would be the spectrum if there would be no other small length scale in the problem .",
    "in solid state physics the atomic spacing provides another length scale that slightly changes the exponent .",
    "we face a similar situation here with the difference that the constituents are not the atoms that we know .",
    "the critical exponent that is relevant here is the anomalous dimension @xmath16 of the correlation function @xmath17 the typical value for @xmath16 is @xmath0 ( see table [ tab : eta ] ) .",
    "we will argue that the spectrum of @xmath13 is not flat but that instead @xmath18 this is exactly the spectrum of the metric perturbations of equations ( [ eqn : spectrum ] ) .",
    "this is our central result .",
    "there are now three attitudes one can take towards this result .",
    "one possibility is to say that this just represents a numerical coincidence and does not tell us anything significant about early universe cosmology .",
    "another possibility is to say that this picture provides an effective description of what is going on .",
    "what needs to be done then is to find the fundamental theory whose degrees of freedom are effectively described by the order parameter @xmath13 .",
    "the last possibility is to take this result literally and equate the order parameter @xmath13 with the metric perturbation @xmath19 .",
    "this is the path that was advocated in @xcite .",
    "the cosmological microwave background then becomes the first experimental hint that tells us where to look for a quantum theory of gravity .",
    "we infer that gravity is emergent , that there is a fundamental discreteness , and that the non - perturbative degrees of freedom of the vacuum have to be identified with gravity .",
    "for concreteness we assume that we are dealing with the simple case of a second order phase transition with a scalar order parameter @xmath13 .",
    "we want to calculate the spectrum of the order parameter just before the domains of size @xmath12 are formed . for the domains of size @xmath12 to form the regions of smaller size inside the domain have to flip to form the new ground state .",
    "the spectrum is given by @xmath20 here @xmath21 is the fourier transform of @xmath13 restricted to the volume @xmath22 .",
    "the order parameter @xmath23 is the sum of the contributions from the different regions .",
    "if @xmath24 is the set of regions then @xmath25 because we are interested in the ensemble average we find @xmath26 the contribution from a region @xmath27 only depends on its size .",
    "let us define @xmath28 so that @xmath29 is the number of regions with sizes between @xmath30 and @xmath31 in the volume @xmath22 .",
    "then @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the contribution from a domain of size @xmath30 . for the spectrum",
    "we then get @xmath34 we thus need to calculated the number @xmath28 of regions and the contribution @xmath33 from one such region .    .",
    "[ tab : eta ]    .the critical exponent @xmath16 . [ cols=\"^,<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     this table has been adapted from @xcite .",
    "@xmath35 is the dimension of the order parameter .",
    "the leading behavior of @xmath28 can be derived from the scale invariance of the system at the transition .",
    "we have defined @xmath28 such that @xmath36 is the number of regions with sizes between @xmath30 and @xmath31 in the volume @xmath22 .",
    "if we scale the whole system by @xmath37 then the above expression gives the number of regions with sizes between @xmath38 and @xmath39 in the volume @xmath40 .",
    "we can define the scaled number density @xmath41 by @xmath42 the last factor of @xmath43 accounts for the change in @xmath44 .",
    "scale invariance .",
    "the first step of a renormalization group transformation would then consist of averaging neighboring cells .",
    "this step does not change @xmath28 for length scales larger than @xmath45 .",
    "the second step , i.e. the rescaling , changes @xmath28 in the way given by equation ( [ eqn : rescale ] ) and produces an equivalent result to the one we started out with .",
    "this is what equation ( [ eqn : scale free ] ) says . ]",
    "then implies @xmath46 this gives the following scaling behavior for @xmath28 : @xmath47 this is not the whole story though . because of the presence of a small length scale @xmath45 there is perfect correlation of the order parameter for length scales smaller than @xmath45 . for length scales larger than @xmath45",
    "this discreteness shows up as a small change in the exponent of the power law behavior of the correlation function .",
    "instead of @xmath48 we have @xmath49 typical values for @xmath16 are given in table [ tab : eta ] .",
    "note how very little variation there is in the value of @xmath16 and how close it is to the observed value of the tilt of the spectrum of the cosmic microwave background .",
    "we see that there is slightly _ more _ correlation at smaller distances because of the existence of the length scale @xmath45 .",
    "we can repeat this argument for the number @xmath28 of regions with size @xmath30 . for length scales smaller than @xmath45 the number of regions drops to zero .",
    "the effect of the small length scale @xmath45 is thus to have slightly _ fewer _ domains of small size .",
    "the observations about the correlation function @xmath50 and the number of regions @xmath28 are consistent because it takes more regions of differing orientations to destroy correlation .",
    "more correlation at smaller length scales implies fewer regions of small size . in appendix",
    "[ app : nu ] we argue that in fact @xmath51",
    "next we have to calculate the contribution to the spectrum from one region of size @xmath30 : @xmath52 we assume that the value of the order parameter @xmath13 is constant inside the region .",
    "if one thinks of a spin model then the new ground state might be all spins down .",
    "the constant value that we are talking about here is the value that corresponds to the spins being up . in particular",
    "this implies that the constant does not depend on @xmath30 . using parseval s identity we obtain for @xmath53 that @xmath54 or @xmath55 the factor of @xmath56 on the right hand side of the equation arises because the support of the fourier transform will have size @xmath57 if the support of the function has size @xmath30 . to summarize @xmath58",
    "we are now in a position to calculate the spectrum @xmath59 of the order parameter just before the transition : @xmath60 using equations ( [ eqn : nuofl ] ) and ( [ eqn : phicontribution ] ) we obtain @xmath61 if we identify @xmath13 with the metric perturbation @xmath19 this is exactly the spectrum found in the cosmic microwave background .",
    "in this paper we have pointed out a curious fact .",
    "an almost scale free spectrum with a slight tilt of @xmath0 appears in two very different places in nature .",
    "one place is early universe cosmology and the other is an ordinary phase transition .",
    "one can have two different attitudes towards this result .",
    "either one thinks that this is pure numerology or one takes this to be an indication that a phase transition was part of the early history of the universe .",
    "let us investigate the second option .",
    "the most important consequence is that it replaces the big bang and a period of inflation with a phase transition .",
    "this might look like too high a price to pay but it it is worth remembering that the theory of inflation is not without problems .",
    "the phase transition saves us from having to introduce a new field and a potential that is chosen just so to produce the desired tilt .",
    "it also saves us from having to contemplate the initial value problem and the multiverse problem that automatically come with the theory of inflation .",
    "it is no longer the case that we have to ask ourselves how it is that we live in this universe if everything that could happen did happen an infinite number of times .",
    "our approach also solves the problems that inflation originally set out to solve : the horizon problem , the flatness problem , and the magnetic monopole problem .",
    "the horizon problem is easily addressed because the size @xmath12 of the correlated domain is just related to the speed with which the phase transition is traversed .",
    "the flatness problem does nt arise because the solid state like models that we are looking at here naturally favor flatness .",
    "monopoles are expected to appear at the boundary of the correlated domains of size @xmath12 and are thus not visible in our universe .",
    "the reason for the existence of the anomalous dimension @xmath16 is the presence of a small length scale . in solid state physics",
    "this is the atomic spacing ; here it implies the existence of a new fundamental small length scale that we have not yet observed in any other way .",
    "the tilt of the cosmic microwave background is thus an indication that our world is discrete or at least possesses a further fundamental small length scale .",
    "it is worth pointing out how robust the value of @xmath16 is .",
    "it varies very little over different dimensions and systems ( see table [ tab : eta ] ) .",
    "another important consequence of this result is what it implies for the search of a theory of quantum gravity .",
    "the fact that we see the results of a phase transition in the cosmic microwave background shows that gravity has to be emergent .",
    "it implies in particular that quantum gravity is not the quantization of gravity just like water molecules are not obtained by quantizing water waves .",
    "many attempts at a quantum theory of gravity deal with quantum space times that are superpositions of planck scale sized versions of space time @xcite .",
    "this result implies that quantum gravity is not of this kind .    in this paper",
    "we have suggested to identify the order parameter with the gravitational potential .",
    "this is what we have advocated in @xcite .",
    "the order parameter that we have looked at here is of course far too simple .",
    "it is to be expected that the parameter that is describing our world is far more complicated than a scalar .",
    "what we do expect though is that gravity is the effect of the non - perturbative structure of the vacuum .",
    "it is our conviction that if one proposes such a drastic revision of the basic building blocks of physics some things should be simple .",
    "this result is this simple thing . instead of a theory that leads us to reconsider the kind of questions science",
    "can answer we are just dealing with a simple phase transition .",
    "let @xmath62 be a subset of @xmath63 .",
    "for every @xmath64 let @xmath65 be the number of spheres of radius @xmath30 that are needed to cover @xmath62 . when we let @xmath30 go to zero @xmath65 typically diverges .",
    "the way @xmath65 diverges allows us to define the dimension @xmath66 of @xmath62 .",
    "we set @xmath67 it turns out that there are sets @xmath62 for which this number @xmath66 is not an integer .",
    "we will call @xmath66 the fractal dimension of the set @xmath62 ( see @xcite for more details ) .    another way to characterize",
    "the set @xmath62 is through the correlation function @xmath50 corresponding to @xmath62 .",
    "let @xmath68 be the characteristic function of @xmath62 : @xmath69 then we define @xmath70 it turns out that the small scale behavior of the correlation function of @xmath62 is related to the fractal dimension of @xmath62 .",
    "if the correlation function behaves like @xmath71 then the fractal dimension is @xmath72 this connection provides a convenient way to calculate the fractal dimension of a given set @xmath62 .",
    "[ app : calc ] for some region in @xmath73 let @xmath65 be the number of spheres of radius @xmath30 that are needed to cover @xmath62 .",
    "the number that we are looking for is just the number of regions that have size @xmath30 .",
    "the way to get this number is to see how @xmath65 changes when we change @xmath30 .",
    "let us say we go from @xmath74 to @xmath30 .",
    "if we have one solid region of size @xmath74 then we should have @xmath75 the difference of the two sides of this equation is a measure for the number @xmath28 of regions of size @xmath30 ( see the figure [ fig : regions ] ) .",
    "thus @xmath76 both terms go like @xmath77 .     of regions of size @xmath30 from @xmath65.,width=302 ]",
    "let us start with the correlation function of equation ( [ eqn : correlation ] ) .",
    "it corresponds to a fractal of dimension ( see [ sec : fractal ] ) @xmath78 the number of spheres of size @xmath30 that are needed to cover this fractal is given by @xmath79 the number @xmath80 of regions with sizes between @xmath30 and @xmath74 .",
    "this number is proportional to @xmath81 ( see appendix [ app : calc ] for the details ) . we just care about the power of @xmath30 which is @xmath82 we now have to connect the number @xmath83 of regions of size @xmath30 that cover the fractal to the total number @xmath28 of regions that flip .",
    "if @xmath84 and @xmath85 are the number of domains of up and down spins of size @xmath30 then we have shown that @xmath86 let @xmath87 be the fraction of regions contributing to the fractal , i.e. @xmath88 the question is whether @xmath87 depends on @xmath30 .",
