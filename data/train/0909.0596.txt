    "has to be introduced into the right hand side of einstein equation to explain the phenomenon of cosmic acceleration .",
    "however , the nature and origin of dark energy remain a mystery .",

    "the equation of state parameter @xmath11 of dark energy is a constant in a redshift bin , and three redshift bins with boundaries at @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 were chosen .",

    "the authors considered two redshift bins by using the constitution snia data , and they found that dark energy suddenly emerged at redshift @xmath9 .",
    "the results obtained in @xcite were based on the analysis of the constitution snia , the full wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe 5 year ( wmap5 ) @xcite and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) data . for the redshift range @xmath15 , four evenly spaced redshift bins were chosen . however , choosing the same four evenly spaced redshift bins , the authors in @xcite found no evidence for dark energy dynamics by using the constitution snia , wmap5 , bao @xcite , the integrated sachs - wolfe effect , galaxy clustering and weak lensing data .",
    "different data sets and analysis may give different results .",
