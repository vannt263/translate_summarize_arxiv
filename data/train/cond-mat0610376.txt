    "many systems of statistical physics can develop interfaces , separating different phases or substances .",
    "these include bloch walls in ferromagnets , binary liquid mixtures , liquid - gas systems and systems of immiscible polymers @xcite .",
    "the properties of interfaces are important for the behaviour of such systems .",
    "they have been investigated both experimentally and theoretically and are subject of current research , see e.g.  @xcite . for example , if substrates are covered by liquid films in coatings or lubricants , the stability of the films depends on the interfacial tensions between substrate , liquid and vapor .",
    "another example concerns the mechanical strength of polymer blends against deformations .",
    "the structure of interfaces between domains of the minority component , which are embedded in the background of the majority component , is of crucial importance for the strength of the blend @xcite .",
    "the profile of an interface characterizes its geometry .",
    "it determines several other properties such as the interface width and interface tension and therefore plays a central role for the physics of interfaces .",
    "interfacial profiles are investigated experimentally through scattering of photons or neutrons @xcite .",
    "theoretical studies of interfacial profiles include numerical monte carlo simulations @xcite and field theoretic calculations @xcite .",
    "the simplest description of interfaces is based on mean field theory @xcite .",
    "the interfacial profile is described by a continuous order parameter @xmath0 representing the difference between the concentrations of the two coexisting phases . in the landau - ginzburg approach the free energy density",
    "is written as @xcite @xmath1 = \\frac{1}{2 } \\partial_\\mu   \\phi \\partial_\\mu   \\phi + v_0(\\phi)\\,.\\ ] ] in the situation with interfaces the potential is of the double - well type , @xmath2 the minima of this potential correspond to the two homogeneous phases .",
    "the mean field correlation length @xmath3 is defined through the second moment of the correlation function in the mean field approximation .",
    "it is given by the second derivative of the potential in its minima : @xmath4    in mean field theory the interfacial profile is given by minimization of the free energy density ( [ lagr ] ) with boundary conditions appropriate for an interface .",
    "this leads to the differential equation @xmath5 if we choose the interface to be perpendicular to the @xmath6-axis , we find the typical hyperbolic tangent profile @xcite @xmath7 its width is proportional to the mean field correlation length @xmath3 .",
    "the parameter @xmath8 specifies the location of the interface and will be set to @xmath9 in the following .",
    "corrections to mean field theory come from fluctuations of the order parameter field .",
    "they can be calculated systematically in renormalized perturbation theory .",
    "the fluctuations result in different modifications of the mean field result .",
    "first of all , higher order corrections change the form of the profile from the tanh - function to a different function @xmath10 .",
    "secondly , renormalization of the parameters @xmath11 and @xmath3 becomes necessary and consequently the mean field correlation length @xmath3 is replaced by the physical correlation length @xmath12 , which diverges near the critical point with a characteristic exponent @xmath13 .",
    "a profile of the form @xmath14 corresponds to the scaling form proposed by fisk and widom @xcite . finally , long - wavelength capillary wave fluctuations lead to the roughening phenomenon @xcite .",
    "it implies a further broadening of the interface such that in a three - dimensional system the width of an interface depends logarithmically on the system size and diverges in the limit of an infinite system .",
    "in this article we consider corrections to mean field theory by means of the  local potential approximation \" , which is popular in the study of non - homogeneous structures in field theory and cosmology .",
    "it takes into account corrections to the local potential @xmath15 , whereas contributions involving higher powers of derivatives are neglected . in this sense",
    ", the local potential approximation represents the leading contributions in a systematic expansion of the effective action .",
    "however , it neglects any non - local contribution to the effective action .",
    "therefore it is , in particular , insensitive to effects related to the system size .",
    "the resulting interfacial profile is of the scaling form ( [ form ] ) . in the local potential approximation",
    "the effects of capillary waves are not fully taken into account .",
    "this is due to the fact that in the differential equation determining the interface profile only the local value of the profile function but no large - scale properties like the system size enter .",
    "the profile function therefore describes a kind of intrinsic interfacial profile . including large - scale effects",
    "would require to build on the full effective potential , which is a non - local functional of the profile function .",
    "in such a calculation additional contributions to the interface profile are to be expected , which depend logarithmically on the system size @xcite . to define a unique separation of an intrinsic profile from its capillary wave contribution in such",
    "a situation is a nontrivial subject , which has been discussed in various papers , see e.g.@xcite . in our approach ,",
    "where broadening due to capillary waves is suppressed , this problem does not show up .",
    "our calculations are performed in @xmath16 physical dimensions in contrast to the @xmath17-expansions , where @xmath18 and an extrapolation to @xmath19 is necessary .",
    "the three - dimensional approach , in the framework of renormalized massive field theory , is based on a systematic expansion in a dimensionless coupling @xcite .",
    "we calculate the potential to second order in the loop expansion .",
    "ultraviolet divergencies are treated by dimensional regularization ( @xmath20 ) , which does not vitiate the fact that the results for physical quantities strictly refer to @xmath16 dimensions .",
    "renormalization of the three - dimensional field theory is performed in the scheme used in @xcite to two - loop order , employing the results of @xcite .",
    "the differential equation for the interfacial profile is solved analytically in terms of special functions @xcite .",
    "the resulting profile is compared with results from monte carlo calculations .",
    "previous studies of interfacial profiles in the framework of field theory have been made in @xcite .",
    "in @xcite the profile is calculated to first order in the @xmath17-expansion .",
    "this amounts to a one - loop calculation . as the expansion is around the four - dimensional case , capillary wave effects",
    "are not included , and an extrapolation to @xmath16 is necessary .",
    "the calculation of @xcite is extended to include the effects of an external field in @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the interfacial profile is considered in @xmath16 dimensions at one - loop order in the presence of an external gravitational field .",
    "a functional form of the profile is given , including capillary wave effects .",
    "the dependence on the system size is , however , not considered .",
    "the effective potential can be calculated in the loop - expansion by standard field theoretic methods @xcite .",
    "the starting point is the hamiltonian density @xmath21 we write the mean field potential as @xmath22 where the bare mass @xmath23 is equal to the inverse bare ( mean field ) correlation length .",
    "the hamiltonian is @xmath24 in the physical situation the number of dimensions is of course @xmath16 , but we shall keep @xmath25 variable to allow for dimensional regularization .    the normalized partition function with an external source is defined through the functional integral @xmath26 =   \\frac{1}{z_0 } \\int\\!\\ !",

    "the effective potential @xmath15 is the basic quantity for the discussion of spontaneous symmetry breaking and non - homogeneous configurations @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that it is not a convex function , as the loop expansion also reveals .",
    "this is , however , not a failure of the loop expansion , but a feature of the effective potential , see e.g.  @xcite or sec .",
    "2.2 of the textbook @xcite .",
    "the local potential represents the density of the gibbs potential for a small volume element , in which the field is constant , i.e.  locally in a pure phase .",
    "the proof of convexity applies to the extensive thermodynamic function , i.e.  the total gibbs potential , and not to the local potential . for a proof of convexity in the context of field theory see @xcite . in a situation ,",
    "where the local potential is not convex , but the gibbs potential is , the system is in a mixed phase and the convexity of the total gibbs potential is the result of the composition of contributions from the coexisting pure phases .",
    "this is the situation where interfaces are present .",
    "therefore it is the local effective potential which is relevant for the local interface structure .",
    "another non - homogeneous situation , where the non - convex local potential plays a role , is the presence of nucleation bubbles in nucleation theory @xcite .",
    "the effective action can be calculated by means of the loop expansion in the form @xmath35 =   \\gamma_0[\\phi ] + \\gamma_1[\\phi ] + \\gamma_2[\\phi ] + \\cdots\\,,\\ ] ] where the leading term @xmath36 is equal to the negative hamiltonian . in the corresponding expansion of the effective potential , @xmath37 the leading term",
    "@xmath38 is the mean field potential ( [ mfpot ] ) .",

    "actually , for small values of the field the system is unstable due to spinodal decomposition .",
    "the boundary value for @xmath44 given above represents the mean field spinodal . in the full renormalized theory",
    "this will be modified or even be replaced by a crossover line @xcite . according to @xcite the imaginary part of the effective potential is to be identified with the decay rate of the mixed state . for the calculation of the interfacial profile",
    "the real part of the effective potential has to be employed .",
    "the two - loop contribution to the effective potential is obtained through the calculation of two feynman diagrams :    graphs @xmath45    in the two - loop contribution usual ultraviolet divergencies appear .",
    "they originate from large momentum , short - distance fluctuations , and are not related to capillary wave fluctuations .",
    "this is reflected in the fact that they are identical to those coming from bulk fluctuations in a situation without interfaces .",
    "the divergencies have to be treated in some regularization and renormalization scheme .",
    "we choose to employ dimensional regularization in @xmath20 dimensions .",
    "it should be noted that this does not amount to an @xmath17-expansion , since after renormalization @xmath17 is sent to zero , whereas in the @xmath17-expansion one has @xmath18 and the results have to be extrapolated to @xmath46 .",
    "we obtain @xmath47 where @xmath48 is euler s constant .",
    "this potential is being used for the calculation of the interfacial profile .",
    "in the local potential approximation the effective action is approximated by @xmath49 = \\int\\!\\ ! d^d\\!x \\,\\left\\{v(\\phi(x ) ) + \\frac{1}{2 z_3 } ( \\partial\\phi(x))^2 \\right\\}.\\ ] ] the factor @xmath50 is the usual field renormalization constant in the broken symmetry phase , given by @xmath51 with @xmath52 denoting the minimum of the effective potential .",
    "the interfacial profile @xmath53 is now obtained in the local potential approximation as a solution of the differential equation @xmath54 where @xmath55 denotes the real part of the effective potential . for an interface perpendicular to the @xmath6-axis",
    "the appropriate boundary conditions are @xmath56    the resulting profile function contains diverging coefficients coming from the @xmath57 term in the second order effective potential ( [ v2 ] ) .",
    "these are treated by the usual renormalization procedure .",
    "we adopt the renormalization scheme used in @xcite to two - loop order .",
    "the renormalized mass @xmath58 is equal to the inverse correlation length @xmath12 , which in turn is defined through the second moment of the correlation function .",
    "the field @xmath41 and its value @xmath52 in the minimum are renormalized according to @xmath59 the renormalized coupling is specified as in @xcite through @xmath60 in addition we define a dimensionless renormalized coupling according to @xmath61    employing the relations given in @xcite , the bare quantities @xmath62 and @xmath63 are expressed in terms of their renormalized counterparts .",
    "this yields an expression for the renormalized interfacial profile @xmath64 depending on the parameters @xmath65 and @xmath66 . in this expression",
    "the divergencies are canceled , as they should .",
    "the solution is expanded in the form @xmath67 here we have introduced the variable @xmath68    the leading order contribution has of course the form of the mean field profile @xmath69 it should , however , be distinguished from the mean field profile , as it contains the physical correlation length instead of the mean field one .",
    "it represents a refinement of landau theory that is consistent with scaling @xcite and holds near the critical point .    due to the fact that the effective potential has a point of non - analyticity , the first and second order contributions are also non - analytic . for @xmath70",
    "smaller or larger than @xmath71 , the functions @xmath72 and @xmath73 take different forms , which are called @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 , @xmath77 , respectively . for the first and second order correction we obtain @xcite @xmath78 @xmath79 and @xmath80 @xmath81    the contributions of the various orders and the resulting profile function are displayed in fig.[profile ] .",
    "for the renormalized dimensionless coupling we have chosen @xmath82 . in the vicinity of the critical point",
    "the coupling varies only slowly and is close to the universal fixed point value @xmath83 , see @xcite for a discussion of numerical and field - theoretical estimates .",
    "the figure shows that the corrections are small compared to the leading term and therefore the interfacial profile at second order can be approximately described by a tanh function .",
    "it can also be seen that the higher order corrections lead to an increase of the interface width .",
    "the broadening of the interface can be specified more quantitatively in terms of a broadening factor @xmath84 by fitting the total profile function to @xmath85 where the prefactor is fixed through the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath86 .",
    "for @xmath82 we obtain a value of @xmath87 .",
    "while the one - loop contribution @xmath72 vanishes asymptotically for @xmath88 , the two - loop contribution approaches a small but finite value , affecting the total asymptotic value .",
    "it also displays a bump - like behaviour , which is due to the non - analyticity at @xmath71 , mentioned above",
    ".    a numerical investigation of the interfacial profile in the three - dimensional ising model has been made by stauffer @xcite for a temperature , which is one percent below the critical one .",
    "the resulting order parameter can be described rather well by a tanh function and the numerical fit yields @xmath89 where @xmath90 denotes the lattice spacing .    in order to compare with our result",
    "we have to convert the units by using @xmath91 with @xmath92 @xcite and @xmath93 @xcite . for @xmath94",
    "this gives @xmath95    the broadening factor deviates from the monte carlo value by only 12% .",
    "the significance of this coincidence is , however , not clear , due to the procedure to identify the interface profile in the monte carlo calculation .",
    "this procedure includes the effects of capillary waves , but neglects the effects of bulk fluctuations , whose contributions are central in our calculation .",
    "it is unclear how the resulting difference in the definitions of the interface width affects the comparison .",
    "we investigated the interfacial profile in the framework of renormalized field theory using the local potential approximation .",
    "for this purpose the effective potential has been calculated in the loop expansion to second order .",
    "the resulting profile function is obtained analytically .",
    "it is of the scaling form and can be interpreted as an intrinsic profile .",
    "to lowest order the profile is of the mean field type . for typical values of the coupling constant in the scaling region",
    "the higher order corrections are small .",
    "they imply a broadening of the interface of about 25% .",
