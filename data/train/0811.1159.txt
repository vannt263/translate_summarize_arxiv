    "interacting fermionic particles play a central role in the structure of matter and exist over a very broad range of energies , from extremely low temperature trapped atomic fermi gases , where @xmath10 k  @xcite , to very high temperature primordial matter , like quark - gluon plasmas , where @xmath11 k  @xcite . for all of these systems , the most intriguing physics is related to very strong interactions between fermionic particles , such as the strong coupling between electrons in high-@xmath8 superconductors and the strong interactions between neutrons in neutron matter .",
    "current many - body quantum theories face great challenges in solving problems for strongly interacting fermi systems , due to the lack of a small coupling parameter .",
    "for example , the critical temperature of a superfluid - normal fluid transition in a strongly interacting fermi gas has been controversial for many years .",
    "the critical temperature @xmath12 has been predicted to have values in the range between 0.15 and 0.35 by different theoretical methods  @xcite .",
    "a complete understanding of the physics of strongly interacting systems can not yet be obtained from a theoretical point of view .",
    "there is a pressing need to investigate strongly interacting fermions experimentally .    in recent years ,",
    "based on progress in optical cooling and trapping of fermionic atoms , a clean and controllable strongly interacting fermi system , comprising a degenerate , strongly interacting fermi gas  @xcite , is now of interest to the whole physics community .",
    "strongly interacting fermi gases are produced near a broad feshbach resonance  @xcite , where the zero energy s - wave scattering length @xmath13 is large compared to the interparticle spacing , while the interparticle spacing is large compared to the range of the two - body interaction . in this regime ,",
    "the system is known as a unitary fermi gas , where the properties are universal and independent of the details of the two - body scattering interaction  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to other strongly interacting fermi systems , in atomic gases , the interactions , energy , and spin population can be precisely adjusted , enabling a variety of experiments for exploring this model system .",
    "intense studies of strongly interacting fermi gases have been implemented over the past several years from a variety of perspectives . some of the first experiments observed the expansion hydrodynamics of the strongly interacting cloud  @xcite .",
    "evidence for superfluid hydrodynamics was first observed in collective modes  @xcite .",
    "collective modes were later used to study the @xmath14 equation of state throughout the crossover regime  @xcite .",
    "recently , measurements of sound velocity have also been used to explore the @xmath14 equation of state  @xcite .",
    "below a feshbach resonance , fermionic atoms join to form stable molecules and molecular bose - einstein condensates  @xcite .",
    "fermionic pair condensation has been observed by projection experiments using fast magnetic field sweeps  @xcite . above resonance ,",

    "rotating fermi gases have revealed vortex lattices in the superfluid regime  @xcite as well as irrotational flow in both the superfluid and normal fluid regimes  @xcite .",
    "measurement of the thermodynamic properties of a strongly interacting fermi gas was first accomplished by adding a known energy to the gas , and then determining an empirical temperature that was calibrated using a pseudogap theory  @xcite .",
    "recent model - independent measurements of the energy and entropy  @xcite provide a very important piece of the puzzle , because they enable direct and precision tests that distinguish predictions from recent many - body theories , without invoking any specific theoretical model  @xcite .",
    "one of the major challenges for the experiments in strongly interacting fermi gases is the lack of a precise model - independent thermometry .",
    "two widely - used thermometry methods are model - dependent , in that they rely on theoretical models for calibration .",
    "the first relies on adiabatic magnetic field sweeps between the molecular bec regime and the strongly interacting regime  @xcite .",
    "subsequently , the temperature of the strongly interacting gas is estimated from the measured temperature in the bec regime using a theoretical model of the entropy  @xcite .",
    "the second method , used by our group  @xcite , is based on determining an empirical temperature from the cloud profiles that is calibrated by comparing the measured density distribution with a theoretical model for the density profiles .",
    "currently two model - independent thermometry methods have been reported for strongly - interacting gases .",
    "one is the technique employed by the mit group  @xcite , which is only applicable to imbalanced mixtures of spin - up and spin - down atoms .",
    "that method is based on fitting the noninteracting edge for the majority spin after phase separation .",

    ", we estimate the critical energy @xmath15 and critical temperature @xmath8 .",
    "both the model - independent @xmath4 data and the estimated critical parameters are compared with several recent many - body theories based on both analytic and quantum monte carlo methods .",
    "we also show how parameterizing the @xmath4 data provides experimental temperature calibrations , which helps to unify , in a model - independent way , the results obtained by several groups  @xcite .",
    "first we relate the endpoint temperatures for adiabatic sweeps of the bias magnetic field between the strongly interacting and ideal noninteracting regimes , as used in the jila experiments to characterize the condensed pair fraction  @xcite .",
    "this enables the ideal gas temperature observed for the onset of pair condensation  @xcite to be related to the critical temperature of the strongly interacting fermi gas .",
    "the temperature obtained by parameterizing the strongly interacting gas data also calibrates the empirical temperature based on the cloud profiles , as used in our previous studies of the heat capacity  @xcite .",
    "these temperature calibrations yield values of @xmath8 close to that estimated from our @xmath4 data .",
    "next , we discuss three different methods for determining the universal many - body parameter , @xmath16  @xcite , where @xmath17 is the energy per particle in a uniform strongly interacting fermi gas at @xmath14 in units of the energy per particle of an ideal fermi gas at the same density . first , we describe the measurement of the sound velocity at resonance and its relationship to @xmath16 .",

    "finally , we obtain three universal thermodynamic functions from the parameterized @xmath4 data , the energy @xmath19 , heat capacity @xmath20 , and global chemical potential @xmath21 .",
    "our experiments begin with an optically - trapped highly degenerate , strongly interacting fermi gas of @xmath0li  @xcite . a 50:50 mixture of the two lowest hyperfine states of @xmath0li atoms is confined in an ultrastable co@xmath22 laser trap with a bias magnetic field of 840 g , just above a broad feshbach resonance at @xmath23 g  @xcite . at 840 g ,",
    "the gas is cooled close to the ground state by lowering the trap depth @xmath24  @xcite .",
    "then @xmath24 is recompressed to a final trap depth of @xmath25k , which is much larger than the energy per particle of the gas , for the highest energies employed in the experiments .",
    "this suppresses evaporation during the time scale of the measurements .",
    "the shallow trap yields a low density that suppresses three body loss and heating .",
    "the low density also yields a weakly interacting sample when the bias magnetic field is swept to 1200 g , although the scattering length is @xmath26 bohr , as discussed in detail in   [ sec : entropy ] .",
    "the shape of the trapping potential is that of a gaussian laser beam , with a transverse gaussian profile determined by the spot size and an axial lorentzian profile determined by the rayleigh length . to simplify the calculations of the ideal gas properties in subsequent sections , as well as the theoretical modelling",

    "since the harmonic potential energy is proportional to the mean square cloud size , measurement of the cloud profile determines the total energy .",
    "remarkably , a trapped unitary fermi gas at a broad feshbach resonance obeys the same virial theorem as an ideal gas , although it contains superfluid pairs , noncondensed pairs , and unpaired atoms , all strongly interacting .",
