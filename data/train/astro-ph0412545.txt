    "cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) are interacting binary systems in which a white dwarf primary accretes from a roche - lobe filling , late - type secondary ( see @xcite for a comprehensive review ) . in the majority of cvs ,",
    "the magnetic field of the primary is not strong enough to control the accretion flow . in such systems ( non - magnetic cvs )",
    ", accretion proceeds via a keplerian disk , which radiates half the available potential energy mostly in the optical and uv . the other half of the potential energy is in principle available to power the boundary layer between the disk and the white dwarf @xcite .",
    "it is the likely source of x - rays that are observed in nearby non - magnetic cvs , since the accretion disk is not hot enough to be a significant source of x - rays .",
    "there are , however , important questions regarding the validity of this simple interpretation .",
    "x - ray observations are an essential tool that may help advance our understanding of the accretion onto the white dwarfs in cvs in general , and the nature of the boundary layer in particular .    a subset of cvs have been discovered as classical novae .",
    "these eruptions are due to thermonuclear runaway of hydrogen - rich material accreted on to the primary of a cv .",
    "v603  aql  was the brightest classical nova of the 20th century during its eruption ( as nova aquilae 1918 ) .",
    "classical novae are spectacular laboratories of thermonuclear reactions , and make some notable contributions to the chemical evolution of the interstellar medium",
    ". however , the outburst characteristics , such as the energetics , the duration , and nucleosynthesis yields , all depend on the details of the accretion processes in quiescence , including their quiescent mass accretion rate ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "this is an important motivating factor in attempting to learn as much about the nova systems in quiescence .",
    "various authors have claimed v603  aql  to be magnetic ; however , none of these claims have been verified by later , more sensitive , observations .",
    "the claim of periodicity in polarization by @xcite has been disproved by more sensitive observations by @xcite and by @xcite .",
    "although there is a real modulation of the x - ray flux with a 60 minute timescale in in the _ einstein _",
    "data @xcite , this modulation is neither persistent nor periodic , hence v603  aql  should be considered a non - magnetic cv ( @xcite ;  4.1 ) .",
    "v603  aql  is the brightest old ( = quiescent ) nova in the optical , uv and x - ray wavelengths .",
    "it is also relatively nearby ; @xcite have estimated a distance @xmath1 of 360 pc using the expansion parallax method .",
    "the statistical error is negligible in this estimate , although there is a systematic error due to departure from spherical symmetry in nova ejecta @xcite .",
    "@xcite estimate @xmath1 = 430 pc using the correlation between the absolute magnitude and the rate of decline of classical novae ( @xmath2 = 8 days ; @xcite ) .",
    "at such a distance , hipparcos parallax measurement does not lead to a more precise estimate ( @xmath1 = 237@xmath3 pc ; @xcite ) . in this paper , we adopt the @xcite value of 360 pc as the fiducial distance .    v603  aql  is also a permanent superhumper showing both positive and negative superhumps @xcite , suggesting a well - established disk with high @xmath0  simultaneously undergoing apsidal and nodal precessions .",

    "in addition , for the 2001 observations , we have excluded the data taken with pcu0 , as the propane leak in this detector makes background subtraction problematical .",
    "we present summaries of these observations in table[obstab ] .",
    "earlier observations of v603  aql  with _ einstein _ , _ exosat _ , and _ rosat _  are summarized in @xcite .",
    "v603  aql  is located in a crowded region near the galactic plane ( at @xmath13 , @xmath14 ) .",
    "background subtractions for _ rxte _  pca data are performed using a model that accounts for the time - variable particle background and for the average , high - latitude , cosmic x - ray background .",
    "galactic diffuse emission remains in the `` background subtracted '' data , as well as any specific x - ray sources that are in the field - of - view .",
    "the latter includes the supernova remnant kes 79 @xcite , 53.8@xmath15 away , consisting of a thermal shell and a soft , central point source .",
    "this source is probably too soft and too distant to have a significant impact .",
    "more worrisome is the recurrent transient x - ray pulsar , gs  1843 + 009  ( @xcite and references therein ) , located 52.2@xmath15 away from v603  aql . during an outburst",
    ", this pulsar can be much brighter than v603  aql , particularly at high energies since gs  1843 + 009  is a hard source , and can strongly contribute to the counts of non - imaging observations aimed at v603  aql .",
    "it is quite possible that the _ einstein _  mpc data , taken in 1981 march and is reported by @xcite , were strongly contaminated by gs  1843 + 009 , which was unknown at the time ( its discovery was in 1988 ; @xcite ) .",
    "note that the mpc has a relatively wide ( 1.5@xmath16 fwhm ) filed - of - view and there are no contemporary all - sky monitor data",
    ". the high apparent ratio of mpc to ipc count rates ( 3.24/0.71 ) and the hard spectral shape inferred from the mpc data are both incompatible with our findings below .",
    "either v603  aql  was in a different state in 1981 march , or the mpc data were contaminated by a hard source , such as gs  1843 + 009 .",
    "we have extracted the mpc data from heasarc and searched for the 29.5 s spin period of gs  1843 + 009 ; although we do not see the period , this unfortunately still allows the possibility of a significant contamination by this pulsar , since the pulse fraction of gs  1843 + 009  is unusually small ( 4% peak - to - peak ; @xcite ) .",
    "_ rxte _  pca is less susceptible to contamination by this source , because of its narrower field - of - view ( 1@xmath16 fwhm ) .",
    "moreover , we have checked _ rxte _",
    "asm data to ensure that , at the time of these _ rxte _",
    "observations , gs  1843 + 009  was not in an active state . although we can not exclude contamination at a low level by gs  1843 + 009  or another source , it probably is not a major concern .    however , the pca data are contaminated by the apparently diffuse , `` galactic ridge '' x - ray emission @xcite . from figure 1 of @xcite",
    ", we estimate a 26 kev flux of the ridge of order 7@xmath17 ergss@xmath6@xmath18 per _ exosat _  me beam ( 45@xmath15 fwhm ) near v603  aql . taking into account the larger beam size of _ rxte _  pca ( 1@xmath16 fwhm ) , we expect of order 2 ctss@xmath6 per pcu from the ridge in the observations of v603  aql .",
    "although the average spectrum of the ridge has been precisely characterized , the fact that there are at least two components whose relative importance is a function of galactic coordinates @xcite makes it difficult to subtract the ridge contamination with confidence . in the rest of this work , we will use the _ rxte _  data primarily to discuss the short timescale , relative variability of v603  aql .      despite the above considerations , the long - term variability of v603  aql",
    "is well established through imaging observations @xcite , for example by the different count rates recorded by the _ rosat",
    "_  pspc . here",
    "we investigate short - term ( @xmath45 days or less ) variabilites using _ asca _ , _ rxte _ , and _ chandra",
    "_  data .",
    "we present the 64 s bin _ asca _",
    "light ( 0.510 kev ) in figure[ascalc ] .",
    "a significant variability is obvious : although the average count rate is 2.22 cts@xmath6 , values ranging from @xmath110.1 to @xmath47.0 cts@xmath6  ( 64 s bins , all 4 instruments and all photon energies combined ) are seen . despite the strong variability , there is no single stable period in this data @xcite .",
    "we have also investigated the energy dependence of this variability . in figure[ascasoft ] , we plot the softness ratio ( counts below 2 kev divided the 210 kev counts ) against the 210 kev count rate . except at the lowest count rates ,",
    "this plot is relatively flat , and shows a slight softening trend when the count rate is lower .",
    "this rules out changes in photoelectric absorption , which would predict a strong hardening at lower count rates , as a major cause of variability .",
    "we present the light curve of the 1998 _ rxte _",
    "observations in figure[xte1998lc ] .",
    "as the light curve contains counts due to the galactic ridge , we have chosen 2.0 ( the estimated ridge contribution ) as the origin of the y axis . with this offset ,",
    "the high level of variability is apparent , including a large flare - like event at the beginning of the first observation .",
    "although not the main strength , the _ chandra _  hetg / acis - s observation provides an uninterrupted light curve of v603  aql . because the zeroth order ( undispersed ) image is heavily affected by pile - up , we restrict our analysis to the first order photons . we have combined the hetg 1st order light curve and the 2001 pca light curves into a single figure ( figure[apr2001lc ] ) .",
    "of the 20 separate _",
    "pointings , 4 overlapped in time with the _ chandra _  observation .",
    "the middle panel shows the light curves of v603  aql  during this interval , both using the hetg ( blue ) and the pca ( black ) , the latter plotted with the @xmath42 cts@xmath6  per pcu offset as before .",
    "these two light curves overlap closely .",
    "this suggests that our estimate of the galactic ridge contribution to the pca data is a reasonable one .",
    "moreover , any energy dependence of the variability must be small , since the two instruments are sensitive to different energy ranges .    to investigate the energy dependence of the variability further",
    ", we have extracted spectra from the _ chandra _  hetg ( meg ) data from the high and low states , defined as when the total 1st order count rate was higher than / lower than 0.45 cts@xmath6  ( as shown by the dashed line in the middle panel of figure[apr2001lc ] ) .",
    "this ratio is shown as a function of the wavelength in figure[rplot ] in the 1.517.2  ( 0.728 kev ) range .",
    "we confirm the _ asca _  result ( figure[ascasoft ] ) of mild energy dependence . with this definition of high and low states ,",
    "the high state spectrum is somewhat harder : a linear fit to the trend suggests high / low ratio is @xmath420% higher at 8 kev than at 1 kev .",
    "we reach a similar conclusion from the energy independence of the variability in the _ rxte _  pca data ( without subtracting the galactic ridge , whose precise spectrum at the location of v603  aql  is uncertain ) .",
    "this suggests again that the variability of v603  aql  is only mildly energy dependent , and also that the spectra of v603  aql  and of the galactic ridge are similar , barring an unfortunate coincidence .",
    "we present the power spectra ( using the definition of @xcite ) from the 1998 and 2001 observations in figure[sgmplot ] .",
    "@xcite contains a corresponding power spectrum plot from the _ asca _  observation .",
    "we confirm their finding that there is no coherent periodicity in the x - ray data of v603  aql .",
    "in particular , the power spectrum of the _ chandra _  data does not suffer from the aliasing problem that plagues low earth orbit satellite data , and thus the multiple peaks seen in the bottom panel between 0.20.5 mhz ( periods in the 20005000 s range ) must be taken at face value .",
    "that is , v603  aql  shows strong variability on these timescales , which however is not due to a single , coherent period .",
    "in addition , we have attempted to verify the tentative detection of power at 60 hrs @xcite using the 2001 _ rxte _  campaign , but failed to do so .",
    "this is in part due to the the combination of the powers at higher frequencies ( 0.20.5 mhz ) and our sampling pattern .",
    "we also note that the earlier claim was based on _ rosat _  data , which leaves open the possibility of a soft x - ray absorption event that would be undetectable with _ rxte_. finally , the highest peak in the _ chandra _  power spectrum corresponds to a period of  25,000 s. this is a significant fraction of the duration of our _ chandra _  data , so we caution against overinterpreting this peak .",
    "we show the average _ chandra _  hetg / acis spectrum of v603  aqlin figure[hetgov ] .",
    "the line - rich nature of its spectrum is obvious .",
    "the he - like and cold fe k@xmath19 lines are strongly detected , as well as a weaker h - like fe k@xmath19 .",
    "the h - like lines of si , mg , ne and o are prominent , while their he - like counterparts are detected but significantly weaker .",
    "in addition , many fe l - shell lines are detected in the 1017   range .",
    "this overall appearance is that of an x - ray emission from multi - temperature , collisionally excited plasma , as was noted earlier by @xcite .",
    "we have analyzed this spectrum using two complementary methods . in one ,",
    "we have characterized individual lines through local fits , using an unabsorbed power law continuum and gaussian lines . in the second method",
    ", we have performed a global fit using the variable abundance version of the cooling flow model ( vmkcfl ) with the gaussian broadening function ( gsmooth ) , as well as an additional gaussian representing the fluorescent fe line at 6.4 kev .    in principle",
    ", we can derive several quantities from the global fit .",
    "chief among them are the maximum temperature of the plasma , the global mass accretion rate , and the various elemental abundances .",
    "we do not detect a significant interstellar absorption ; in fact , our upper limit ( @xmath20 @xmath18 ) is considerably smaller than the value of 68@xmath21 @xmath18 inferred from _ rosat _  pspc data by @xcite .",
    "this may indicate a possible problem with the calibration of contaminant for _ chandra _  hetg / acis - s data , which would be a source of systematic errors in the low energy results , both from global and local fits .",
    "we also obtain only an upper limit for the minimum temperature , @xmath22 .",
    "the fact that the model is pegged at its hard lower limit ( 0.0808 kev ) suggests the limitation in the grid of models , in addition to the lack of sensitivity of hetg to such low temperature components , may be playing a role .",
    "the maximum temperature is found to be 20.3@xmath23 kev . as for the abundance values",
    ", we only report our results for ne and fe , two elements that are clearly non - solar relative to the fiducial values of @xcite .",
    "other abundances are consistent with solar , although the best - fit values may deviate from 1.0 by 0.1 or more . the accretion rate of the plasma that is emitting the observed x - rays is determined to be 8.00@xmath24 m@xmath25yr@xmath6 for the assumed distance of 360 pc .",
    "we present a summary of the global fit results in table[gfres ] , with formal 90% confidence errors , and further consider the reliability and the implications of this procedure in  4.2 below .",
    "we list all the lines that are confidently detected in table[llist ] .",
    "for each line , we list the probable identification , observed wavelength , the velocity width , and the photon flux according to the local fit .",
    "these lines are also labelled in figure[hetgov ] .",
    "the measured flux of a line can be combined with the theoretical curve of its emissivity in a collisionally excited plasma as a function of plasma temperature to draw a curve on the temperature  emission measure plane ( figure[emplot ] ) . for ne and fe ,",
    "we have used the best - fit abundance values from the global fit in placing these curves .",
    "any point on one of these curves represents the maximum emission measure a plasma of that temperature can have , before predicting more flux in that line than is observed .",
    "for multi - temperature plasma , emission measures must be summed at several discrete temperatures or integrated over the relevant range .",
    "this is analogous to the differential emission measure ( dem ) distribution analysis favored for the study of stellar coronae ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "note , however , we have not derived the true dem distribution unambiguously .",
    "what we have done here is to constrain the shape of the dem distribution from local fits , and to fit a discrete approximation of the dem distribution appropriate for a isobaric cooling flow .",
    "note also that our data for v603  aql  mixes lines from different elements , and lines of different types , and this complicates the interpretation .",
    "nevertheless , we find it satisfactory that the line from the global fit parallels the locus defined by the series of parabola - like curves derived from individual line fluxes , with an appropriate offset ( a factor of 4 , which is roughly the number of temperature steps of the global model within the typical width of the parabola - like curves ) .",
    "it is also possible to study selected lines in greater detail . in figure[fek ] , we present a close - up view of the fe k@xmath19 region of the spectrum as observed with the heg .",
    "the equivalent width of the fluorescent ( 6.4 kev , or 1.98 ) line is 150 ev , which is what is expected of reflection off a surface that subtends a 2@xmath26 steradian as seen from the primary x - ray source , if the fe abundance is roughly solar . in figure [ triplets ] , we present close - up views of the he - like triplet regions for mg and ne . in both cases , we detect lines near the expected wavelength of the forbidden component",
    ". however , there appears to be an offset . given this ,",
    "the possibility that these apparent detections are due to interlopers should be kept in mind .",
    "we place an upper limit to the flux of the forbidden component at laboratory wavelength of 2.8@xmath27 photons@xmath18s@xmath6 for mgxi and 3.0@xmath27 photons@xmath18s@xmath6 for neix , respectively .",
    "we explore the possible implications further in  4.4 below .",
    "the line width is generally small .",
    "most lines are consistent with a velocity width of order 200300 kms@xmath6 .",
    "this is not surprising given the low inclination angle of v603  aql  ( @xmath28 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the exceptions are the fe fluorescent line and several observed lines that are likely to be blends .    finally , we confirm that the same spectral model can be used to fit the _ asca _  spectra ( those taken with gis and with sis ) of v603  aql .",
    "we obtain an acceptable fit just by adjusting the n@xmath29 and the participating mass accretion rate .",
    "the former is likely due to calibration issues ( both for _ asca _  and for _ chandra _ ) , while the latter is not surprising , given the high level of variability known in this system .",
    "we obtain a participating mass accretion rate of @xmath30 m@xmath25 yr@xmath6 during the _ asca _  observation .",
    "we can also fit the ridge - contaminated _ rxte _  data with the same model , again suggesting the close similarity between the spectra of v603  aql  and the ridge , but we refrain from further interpretation due to this contamination problem .",
    "our analysis of x - ray curves fails to show a persistent periodicity .",
    "although the power spectra of individual observations often show prominent peaks , there is no single period that appears in all observations . instead , the power spectrum of our _ chandra _  data show the simultaneous presence of many peaks .",
    "moreover , the nature of x - ray variability in v603  aql  is atypical for an ip . if there is an energy dependence in the x - ray variability of v603  aql , it is rather subtle ; a strong energy dependence , on the other hand , is a common characteristic of ips .    combined with other recent x - ray results @xcite , as well as non - detection of polarization @xcite",
    ", we affirm the conclusion that v603  aql  is a non - magnetic cv .",
    "the earlier results are likely correct in finding power at certain frequencies in the x - ray data , but are incorrect in interpreting the power spectrum as evidence of a single , coherent , underlying clock .",
    "we consider the nature of the hard x - ray variability further in  4.3 below .",
    "scientifically , the fact that we must assume a physical model for the x - ray emission in a global fitting approach is both its strength and its weakness .",
    "it allows physical interpretations of the fit results , on the one hand . on the other hand ,",
    "the interpretations are only as good as the set of assumptions one has adopted . in our global fits , we have assumed a isobaric cooling flow with no additional heating or cooling mechanisms , absorbed only by the interstellar medium .",
    "several authors have already explored alternative assumptions while analyzing the _ chandra _  hetg data of other cvs @xcite .",
    "moreover , we can not rule out the more simple model in which the emission measure is a power law function of temperature ( cevmkl model in xspec ; see , for example , @xcite ) . as figure[emplot ] shows , the isobaric cooling flow model deviates only mildly from a power law above temperature of 3@xmath31k , where the hetg data have good sensitivity . in this respect ,",
    "we note that our best - fit global model fails to reproduce the observed fexvii line fluxes ( figure[hetgov ] ) , and that a cevmkl model with a reduced o abundance is a viable model .",
    "nevertheless , we discuss below our global fits using the isobaric cooling flow model , since it appears adequately to describe our data and has a physical interpretation .    the numerical complexity and the degeneracy of model parameters",
    "are further factors limiting what one can achieve with global fits .",
    "for example , the maximum temperature ( kt@xmath32 ) can only be constrained if the overall abundance is fixed at an assumed value .",
    "this is because , for the likely range of kt@xmath32 ( @xmath810 kev ) , the hottest plasma contributes little line fluxes , and the continuum shape within the _ chandra _  hetg band changes only moderately .",
    "the main effect of increasing kt@xmath32 is to reduce the equivalent widths of the lines , which can also result from lower abundances .",
    "we have therefore fixed the abundances to the solar values of @xcite , with the exception of ne and fe .",
    "moreover , we have not included reflection in our fits , since _ chandra _",
    "hetg has little sensitivity to reflected continuum , even though the strength of the 6.4 kev line indicates that reflection must be occurring in v603  aql .",
    "given these assumptions , kt@xmath32 is tightly constrained .",
    "unlike in magnetic cvs , however , there is no obvious and simple relationship linking kt@xmath32 with the white dwarf mass ; this would require a knowledge of exactly how the plasma is shocked in an accretion disk boundary layer .    the total mass accretion rate that participate in the cooling flow is well constrained , for the same solar abundance assumption , and for the assumed distance .",
    "however , as we discuss in  4.4 , some of the lines have the potential as plasma diagnostics ; the other side of the coin is that the cooling flow model fit , which does not account for effects of line opacity , photoexcitation etc .",
    ", may not be completely reliable .",
    "moreover , the lines may have variable widths and/or profiles , which could skew our fit results : physically , we expect the plasma to continue to decelerate as it cools , so the line width should be a function of the typical temperature needed to emit that line .",
    "we approximate this using the xspec convolution model , gsmooth , which allows the line width to be a function of the photon energy of that line .",
    "these obviously are not the same thing .",
    "however , the unconfused lines are marginally resolved at best in our data ( see table[llist ] ) , so this is probably not a major concern .    with these caveats , the mass accretion rate in the cooling flow",
    "is tightly constrained in our global fit ( @xmath33 m@xmath25yr@xmath6 or @xmath34 gs@xmath6 ) .",
    "in addition , the observed luminosity in the 1.07.0 kev band is 1.88@xmath35 ergss@xmath6 , depending only on the assumed @xmath1 , and hence is more robust .",
    "that is , v603  aql  is hard x - ray luminous for a non - magnetic cv . in particular , v603  aql  is significantly more luminous than the dwarf nova z  cam in outburst ( 6@xmath36 ergss@xmath6 ; @xcite ) or the inferred hard x - ray component of the nova - like system , ux  uma ( 1.26@xmath37 ergss@xmath6 ; @xcite ) .",
    "ss  cyg has a 320 kev luminosity of 39 @xmath37 ergss@xmath6 during the peak of normal outbursts @xcite , again fainter than v603  aql .",
    "ss cyg , however , has been observed at x - ray luminosity comparable to that of v603  aql : in the 1993 may _ asca _  observation obtained towards the end of an anomalous outburst @xcite and transitions into and out of outburst @xcite .",
    "thus , ss cyg has three main x - ray / optical states .",
    "in the presumed order of increasing mass accretion rate onto the white dwarf , these are : the quiescence , the transition , and the outburst peak .",
    "of these three , v603  aql  resembles the transition most closely , in terms of its x - ray luminosity and its x - ray spectrum .",
    "the lack of detection of soft x - rays ( i.e. , the high energy end of the expected euv / soft x - ray blackbody like component that would escape interstellar absorption ) in v603  aql  @xcite is also consistent with this analogy .",
    "arguing against this is the high optical / uv luminosity ( 10@xmath5 ergs@xmath6 ; @xcite ) of its accretion disk .    the observed x - ray luminosity is less than one per cent of the observed uv luminosity .",
    "if the uv luminosity of v603  aql  indeed represents the accretion luminosity of its disk , the resemblance to the transition in ss  cyg must be a coincidence , and over 99% of the expected luminosity of the boundary layer remains unobserved .",
    "if this luminosity is radiated from the white dwarf surface , this must cover a large fraction of the white dwarf surface to have escaped detection : 10@xmath5 ergs@xmath6 radiated from 5% of the area of a 6,000 km radius white dwarf would have an effective temperature @xmath38 of 25 ev , and would have been detectable as a bright , soft x - ray component , even with a column of n@xmath39 @xmath18 . at @xmath38=20 ev , this is not necessarily the case ( most of the emission is in the euv and can be hidden by the interstellar absorption ) , but the area must be 15% of the white dwarf surface .",
    "thus , the standard picture of @xcite with an optically thick boundary layer producing euv emission , with an optically thin hard x - ray emission near its surface , is a valid model for v603  aql  as long as detailed models allow such a boundary layer to cover a large fraction of the white dwarf surface .",
    "we believe it is appropriate to question if all the observed uv luminosity is directly from viscous heating in the accretion disk .",
    "@xcite note that the apparent correlation ( with little or no time lag ) between the x - ray and uv fluxes may indicate that a fraction of the uv flux is due to reprocessing of x - ray photons . for",
    "this to be the case , we must postulate a luminous euv component that varies in phase with the observed hard x - rays , because the luminosity of the latter is clearly insufficient to power the uv component . the hot white dwarf may also contribute non - negligible euv flux in this regard .",
    "our understanding of when and how nuclear burning terminates in classical novae is still rather vague ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , and little is known about the post - nova cooling . if the entire photosphere of the white dwarf in v603  aql  is hot , though less so than in super - soft source stage of classical novae , its photospheric emission can be hidden more easily than a soft x - ray component from a boundary layer .",
    "the difficulty with this picture is that one would expect the photospheric euv luminosity of a white dwarf to be constant , which is a significant difficulty in explaining the strong uv variability .",
    "if the correlated x - ray / uv variability in v603  aql  is confirmed , then the accretion rate inferred from the uv luminosity may be an overestimate , regardless of what we might eventually conclude about the nature of the irradiating source .",
    "in any case , the resemblance between the x - ray behaviors of v603  aql  and ss  cyg in outburst transition requires an explanation .",
    "further observations of the overall energy balance of ss  cyg during transition may prove useful in this regard .",
    "we have argued earlier that the rapid x - ray variability of v603  aql  is not due to photoelectric absorption .",
    "there is , however , one parameter in the cooling flow model that can explain the type of variability observed : kt@xmath32 . when it is higher , the continuum is stronger and somewhat harder ; when lower , weaker and somewhat softer .",
    "the continuum shape can only constrain kt@xmath32 to within @xmath410 kev , while the line to continuum ratio can constrain it to better than 1 kev , if the overall abundances are fixed . ] . in magnetic cvs",
    ", such changes would be unphysical , since the accretion flow is radial and kt@xmath32 is strongly tied to the white dwarf mass . in a non - magnetic cv , however , the shock geometry is complex and three dimensional , and we know of no reason why the shock geometry , hence kt@xmath32 , can not vary with a timescale of 10s of minutes . on the other hand ,",
    "this timescale is too long to be intrinsic to the boundary layer ; some external mechanism to drive such a change is probably necessary .",
    "a search for similar x - ray variability in other non - magnetic cvs , such as ss  cyg during transition , would be worthwhile .",
    "this timescale , however , is similar to that seen in the uv spectroscopy of v603  aql  @xcite .",
    "based on the detection of episodic uv absorption lines , they suggested the presence of a time - variable wind in v603  aql .",
    "this may be another symptom of the underlying mechanism that causes the x - ray variability .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that uv flux appears to be correlated with x - ray intensities @xcite .",
    "the detection of individual lines opens up the possibility to use selected line ratios as diagnostics of the temperature and the density of the emitting plasma .",
    "the first thing to note is that the high ratio of h - like to he - like line fluxes is a natural consequence of multi - temperature plasma , since h - like lines are typically emitted over a wider range of temperatures than are the he - like lines ( see figure[emplot ] ) .    a casual glance at the he - like triplets of mg and ne ( figure[triplets ] ) suggests that the forbidden component may be present , which would prove a relatively low density ( n@xmath40 @xmath41 ) , and hence a large ( comparable to , or larger than , the white dwarf ) volume",
    "however , we caution against this interpretation for several reasons .",
    "first , the observed wavelengths are not exactly at the laboratory wavelengths of the forbidden transitions , even though the resonant lines are exactly where they are supposed to be .",
    "this suggest either the identification is incorrect , or that the forbidden component originates in a material with different kinematic properties .",
    "second , observed fluxes in the he - like triplets of ne and o are much higher than those of the best - fit cooling flow model ( figure[hetgov ] ) .",
    "this suggests the possibility of a second component .",
    "the third reason is that the strength of the fluorescent fe k@xmath19 line ( equivalent width @xmath4150 ev ) is consistent with reflection from the white dwarf surface and/or the inner disk @xcite that subtends 2@xmath26 steradians , as seen from the x - ray emitter .",
    "this strongly suggests that the emitting region is compact .",
    "the likely volume of such a compact boundary layer ( much less than that of the white dwarf ) and the emission measure estimates ( figure[emplot ] ) require that the emission region must be of very high density .",
    "for a boundary layer covering 1% of the surface area of a white dwarf ( with radius , @xmath42 , of 6,000 km ) , and height 0.1@xmath42 , to have an emission measure of @xmath43 @xmath41 , the density must be @xmath44 @xmath41 .",
    "in fact , the lack of forbidden components of mgxi and neix at rest wavelengths ( see  3.3 ) is consistent with this interpretation .",
    "the ratio @xmath45/(@xmath42+@xmath46 ) is measured to be @xmath110.44 for mgxi and @xmath110.16 for neix , taking the upper limit for the @xmath45 flux and the lower limits for @xmath42 and @xmath46 .",
    "this implies density greater than @xmath47 @xmath41 @xcite , and can be much higher .",
    "what about the fe l diagnostics @xcite ?",
    "of the fexvii lines , the 17.05  line appears to be strongly detected , while the 17.10  line is not confidently detected . within the limited s / n of our data",
    ", this is consistent with high density or significant photoexcitation . as for the fexxii lines near 11.8 the s /",
    "n of our data is not high enough to allow reliable use of this diagnostic , given the need to first separate the fexxii 11.78  line from the fexxiii 11.74  line .",
    "our analysis suggests that the accreting gas in v603  aql  has a high ne abundance and a low fe abundance , relative to the fiducial values of @xcite .",
    "however , note that the solar photospheric fe abundance more recently derived by @xcite is approximately 60% that of @xcite .",
    "thus , whether the fe abundance of v603  aql  is solar or sub - solar may well be a question of the fe abundance in the sun .",
    "however , the ne overabundance of v603  aql  appears genuine , regardless of which solar values we adopt .",
    "v603  aql  appears to differ from other cvs for which abundance anomalies have been reported ( see , for example , @xcite and references therein ) , since these concern mostly carbon and nitrogen .",
    "these measurements refer to the abundances of the accreting material , hence those of the outermost region of the secondary .",
    "the anomalies are likely caused by an episode of cno cycle in these binaries , perhaps in the secondary which was once more massive @xcite .",
    "although further nuclear evolution can in principle alter the ne abundance , this presumably would have been preceded by the cno cycle .",
    "since the nv @xmath481240 line is seen to be weak @xcite , the cno cycle and further nuclear evolution does not appear to be a viable explanation for the ne overabundance in v603  aql .",
    "an alternative explanation for the cno abundance anomaly is that the secondary is contaminated by the ejecta from novae in which cno cycle occurred @xcite .",
    "this idea can in principle be extended to explain the ne abundance of v603  aql , since approximately a third of all classical novae are thought to harbor an o - ne - mg white dwarf , as evidenced by the high ne abundances in their ejecta @xcite .",
    "however , what we observe is not the material of the underlying white dwarf , nor is it the deeper layers of the accreted envelop that is enriched by dredge - up . instead ,",
    "the observed x - rays are emitted above the primary surface by the accreting material .",
    "thus , for this mechanism to work , the white dwarf material must first be ejected in nova eruptions , accreted by the secondary , then transferred back onto the white dwarf .",
    "this requires a much higher overabundance of ne in the nova ejecta than what we observe in the _ chandra _  data . according to the analysis of @xcite , however , the ne abundance of the v603  aql  shell was 1/7,000 , or 1.4@xmath49 by number .",
    "this value is between the solar value of @xcite ( 1.23@xmath49 ) and our x - ray fitting result ( 1.75@xmath49 ) .",
    "we therefore conclude that this is not a viable mechanism for the observed ne overabundance .",
    "this suggests that the v603  aql  system was born with a higher then solar ne abundance due to galactic chemical evolution , implying that it is either young , or it originated closer to the galactic center ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "given the location of v603  aql  very near the galactic mid - plane ( @xmath14 at a distance of 360 pc ) , the former interpretation is certainly plausible .",
    "it is also consistent with the proposition that there are two population of classical novae , one young and fast ( v603  aql  being a prominent example ) , the other older and slower @xcite .",
    "abundance measurements of other old novae may provide a way to test whether there indeed are two distinct populations .",
    "we have presented our analysis of _ chandra _ , _ rxte _ , and archival x - ray observations of v603  aql .",
    "it is among the x - ray brightest cv and displays a line - rich x - ray spectrum .",
    "however , it is likely that non - imaging x - ray data of v603  aql  are contaminated by the galactic ridge as well as nearby , unrelated sources . on v603",
    "aql  itself , our findings can be summarized as follows .",
    "\\(2 ) the x - ray spectrum of v603  aql  is from a multi - temperature , collisionally ionized plasma . specifically , we find that the cooling flow model provides an adequate framework for physical interpretation .",
    "\\(3 ) the spectrum and the luminosity of v603  aql  resembles those of ss  cyg in transition , even though the uv luminosity of v603  aql  is very high .",
    "this is a clue that must be taken into account in any detailed physical models of the x - ray emission mechanism in non - magnetic cvs .",
    "\\(4 ) the weak energy dependence of the x - ray flux variations in v603  aql  can be explained as due to changes in the maximum temperature of the multi - temperature plasma .",
    "the physical cause of such changes is unknown , but we note the accretion disk wind in v603  aql  appears to be modulated on a similar timescale .",
    "\\(5 ) there are complications that make the plasma diagnostics less clear - cut than we would like .",
    "the preponderance of evidence points towards a high density , compact emission region compatible with the accretion disk boundary layer .",
