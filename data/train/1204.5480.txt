    "the significant differences in these line strengths mean that observations of higher co transitions in this object , would conclusively constrain the region of parameter space of the lvg model which describes the conditions of the gas .      another way",
    "we may be able to rule out one of the models is by considering the spatial distribution of the gas .",
    "consider the lvg model which gives the lowest @xmath77 value , t@xmath10 =  k , n(h@xmath11 ) =  @xmath16 and @xmath12 =  kpc , and assume the molecular gas is distributed in a thin disc with height @xmath78 , of uniform density .",

    "we use the findings of @xcite that the molecular gas in the central regions of ulirgs is not a collection of separate clouds undergoing self - gravitation , but rather clouds fused together to form a disc of more or less constant density .",
    "they modelled the structure of these gas discs and found the average height of the discs to be @xmath79 pc .",
    "taking this value as the height of the assumed disc of gas for ams12 , we can calculate the volume of the disc given @xmath80 =  kpc .    from this volume , and the best fitting density of the gas n(h@xmath81 ) =  @xmath16",

    "this is four orders of magnitude higher than the gas mass derived from our observations ( see section [ sec : gasmass ] ) . table [ tab : ci_temp ] shows the gas mass m@xmath83 , for the four methods described in section [ sec : gasmass ] .    on the other hand , the lvg model giving the parameters",
    "t@xmath10 =  k , n(h@xmath11 ) =  @xmath16 and @xmath80 =  kpc , gives a mass of @xmath84  assuming the same disc height of 58 pc .",
    "this is very similar to the masses in table [ tab : ci_temp ] determined by equation [ eqn : coh ] .",
    "though we note we have made various assumptions to estimate the gas masses in section [ sec : gasmass ] , this crude mass estimate from the volume argument , distinguishes the lvg model solutions from each other .",

    "@xcite found in the two smgs they studied , the co ladders were best fit with two component lvg models ; a dense , high - excitation component to fit the higher-@xmath71 co lines , and another low - excitation component to fit the low-@xmath71 co measurements .    to investigate the possibility",
    "the [ ci ] gas in ams12 is from a lower - temperature , more diffuse region , we fit a second component to the lvg model .",
    "we used the co(1 - 0 ) estimate from the [ ci]@xmath0  line , and for the high - excitation component we keep the previous lvg model solution using the dust prior ( from figure [ fig : cosed_prior ] ) .",
    "we fix the temperature of the second component at 42.7 k ( the [ ci ] excitation temperature ) , and tie both components to the estimate of the co(1 - 0 ) strength .",
    "since we only have one data point , we can not fit for both the size and the density at the same time , so we fit each independently keeping the other fixed at a fiducial value .",
    "firstly , we keep the density fixed to @xmath85 @xmath16 and fit for the size .",
    "this density is chosen as a representative of a diffuse component and corresponds to the critical density of co(1 - 0 ) .",
    "the best fit to the radius is 2.8 kpc and the resulting lvg model is shown in figure [ fig:2compfixd ] .",
    "next , we fix the size of the low - excitation gas , while continuing to hold the temperature at 42.7 k , and fit for the density .",
    "we choose two arbitrary sizes ; 1 kpc , which is similar to the best fitting size of the single component lvg model solution to the high-@xmath71 co lines , and 6 kpc , which is significantly more extended .",
    "for the second component solution with a fixed size of 1 kpc , the best fitting density is n(h@xmath81 ) = 10@xmath86 @xmath16 .",
    "the two component lvg model ( comprising of this solution and the best fitting solution of the high-@xmath71 co lines with the dust temperature prior applied ) , is shown as the solid line in figure [ fig:2compfixr1 ] .",
    "it does not provide a good fit to the observations .    with the second component size fixed at 6 kpc , ( and temperature remaining at 42.7 k ) , the best fitting density is n(h@xmath11 ) = 10@xmath87 @xmath16 .",
    "the corresponding two component lvg model is shown in figure [ fig:2compfixr2 ] .",
    "this second component solution provides a better fit to the observed co lines .",
    "the estimates shown in figures [ fig:2compfixd ] and [ fig:2compfixr2 ] , are consistent with a more diffuse and extended gas which is only detectable via the low-@xmath71 co lines and the [ ci ] lines , while still providing good fits to the high-@xmath71 observations .",
    "we note that by construction , our method will only select solutions with weak emission of the high-@xmath71 lines .",
    "since we have begun by fitting co(3 - 2 ) , co(5 - 4 ) and co(7 - 6 ) with a single component model , the extra component used to fit co(1 - 0 ) must produce negligible flux in the co(3 - 2 ) , co(5 - 4 ) and co(7 - 6 ) lines , otherwise their predicted fluxes will be higher than those observed",

    "we can use the co linewidths to estimate the dynamical mass , however , if the [ ci ] traces a low - excitation region of gas , we should use the [ ci ] linewidths . given the large uncertainties in the linewidths in table [ tab : co ] , the co and [ ci ] linewidths are very similar and agree within 2@xmath89 . using both the [ ci ] linewidths , we use @xmath90 km  s@xmath52 .",
    "this will give an approximate estimate on the dynamical mass .",
    "assuming two arbitrary radii encompassing a range of sizes , i.e. the radii from section [ sec : twocomp ] , @xmath91 kpc and @xmath92 kpc , we can estimate two values of the dynamical mass of ams12 .",

    "the stellar mass in ams12 is found from the mid-/near - infrared sed by @xcite , to be @xmath97 .",
    "the dynamical mass estimates make it difficult to account for the stellar mass .",
    "it may be that the radius estimates we have used are not adequate to encompass all the stellar mass .",
    "the constraints on the inclination angle assuming the radii above are severe when considering the stellar and gas mass , for example , if @xmath98 kpc , then the inclination angle _ _ i__@xmath99 . while using the radius estimate @xmath100 kpc , the constraint on the inclination angle relaxes slightly to @xmath101 .",
    "these arguments suggest the host galaxy is seen face - on .",
    "the radio spectrum of ams12 has been investigated in @xcite .",
    "this object has a steep extended radio spectrum , and narrow optical emission lines pointing to torus obscuration , i.e. the orientation of the central engine and its obscuring material is closer to edge - on to the observer .",
    "the low inclination angle of the host from the dynamical mass estimates , suggest the central agn region and the galaxy s stellar , gas and dust regions are not aligned .",
    "together with the observed narrow emission lines , this suggests ams12 is obscured by the torus and not by dust in the host galaxy ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the caveats to using this dynamical mass estimate are many .",
    "the high - excitation co lines may be tracing a separate gas component than the [ ci ] lines , and therefore the radius estimates based on the high - excitation co lvg modelling are tenuous for the possible low - excitation component .",
    "though the [ ci ] linewidths are similar to the co linewidths , this does not immediately place the [ ci ] at the same region of the high - excitation co , i.e. if [ ci ] is alluding to a more massive while more extended low - excitation gas reservoir . resolving the detected co and [ ci ] lines would constrain the sizes of these emitting regions , which may be possible with the upcoming iram northern extended millimeter array ( noema ) upgrade to pdbi . in particular",
    "though , resolved co(1 - 0 ) in this object would significantly improve the dynamical mass estimate in this object .",

    "their sources are split into quasars and smgs , and while quasars have l@xmath107(1 - 0)}}$]/l@xmath108 ratios similar to that of ams12 , the smgs ratios are around an order of magnitude higher .",
    "this could be due to the agn contribution to the l@xmath108 in the quasars , as discussed earlier .",
    "overall , the [ ci ] lines are not major coolants , in fact they are negligible compared to the cooling by the dust continuum .      from our current observations of the dust and high - excitation gas in ams12",
    "the temperatures we determine are shown to be beyond the capabilities of heating by star formation alone . empirical observational evidence and radiative models of star - forming galaxies",

    "apm 08729 + 5255 , f10214 , br 1202 - 0725 and cloverleaf for example , have hotter fir dust than typical star - forming galaxies and other smgs .",
    "detailed studies of the dust and gas in these objects have revealed the dust is compact which supports the possibility of significant agn heating @xcite .",

    "this result is obtained assuming that the ultraviolet photons travel unhindered up until the radius where the dust becomes self - shielding ( i.e. at large optical depths ) , thus 2.7 kpc may be thought of as the characteristic radius to which the dust is heated to this temperature by the agn ( see * ? ? ? * for details ) .",
    "clearly , since the characteristic scale of the dust is indeed found to be @xmath32 kpc in many objects @xcite , the dust temperature observed in ams12 , t@xmath7 = 88 k , could be achieved through heating from the agn .",
    "note , this estimate of the bolometric luminosity does not take the @xmath5  into account , and therefore may be considered a lower limit .",

    "the revised @xmath112  ( including the @xmath5 ) , leads to an estimate of the black hole mass @xmath127 .",

    "the stellar mass of ams12 has been estimated by @xcite to be @xmath128 .",
    "we assume this stellar mass is located entirely within the bulge as ams12 is probably the progenitor of a present - day elliptical galaxy .",
    "this means ams12 has already the stellar mass of a present - day 2l@xmath33 galaxy .",
    "given the gas mass of @xmath129  we derive from the co observations , were this to be converted into stars with 100% efficiency , it would still only increase the stellar mass by @xmath130 .",
    "observations of co(1 - 0 ) are needed to probe the lower - excitation gas and give a more accurate value of the gas mass .",
    "however , it seems unlikely that the stellar mass will increase significantly , unless we have underestimated the gas mass by a factor of @xmath131 .",
    "assuming @xmath132 , we have a @xmath133 ratio for ams12 of @xmath134 .",
    "this is significantly higher than the relationship determined from nearby ( @xmath135 ) galaxies by @xcite and @xcite where @xmath136 with a scatter of @xmath137 .",
    "the @xmath138 relationship has been investigated at higher redshifts up to @xmath139 .",
    "for example , @xcite investigated the relationship in radio - loud galaxies at @xmath140 , @xcite studied a sample of 96 quasars out to @xmath141 , @xcite used both gravitationally lensed and non - lensed galaxies to study the relationship out to @xmath142 , while @xcite studied @xmath139 quasars .",
    "the high redshift studies all agree that the @xmath133 relationship appears to be evolving with redshift .",

    "* who studied both radio - loud and radio - quiet quasars , as well as investigated possible biases ) .",
    "the results of these studies agree with one another and imply that the black holes at high redshifts are more massive for a given bulge mass than their local counterparts .",
    "conversely , the opposite was found in @xmath143 smgs , @xcite , where it was found that the smgs lie below the local @xmath133 relationship .",
    "this illustrates that the selection of objects has significant effects as to where they will be placed with respect to the local relationship .",
    "smgs are biased towards extreme star - formation rates , which indirectly translates to a bias towards relatively massive galaxies . on the other hand ,",
    "selection of quasars and radio galaxies is biased towards massive black holes .",
    "it is therefore perhaps unsurprising that these selected populations are biased towards different sides of the local @xmath133 relationship .",
    "while our results have considerable uncertainty , they are consistent ( within the scatter ) with what these other groups have found @xcite .",
    "for ams12 to evolve to the local relationship , the bulge would have to grow @xmath144 times as much as the central black hole from @xmath145 to @xmath146 .",
    "given the amount of molecular gas implied by the co observations , if ams12 were to evolve secularly , it would , at most , only increase its bulge mass by @xmath130 .",
    "mergers could add more gas for star formation while adding stellar and black hole mass .",
    "it is expected that massive galaxies ( @xmath147 ) , undergo @xmath148 mergers from @xmath141 to present day @xcite .",
    "however , it is not clear how mergers affect the black hole mass and whether it is possible to achieve the necessary growth of the bulge relative to the growth of the black hole .",
    "alternatively , @xcite addressed the possibility that the remnants of the high redshift quasars they studied are high - mass outliers to the local relationship .",

    "in addition , the search for co in this object was initiated by selecting the brightest mambo detection from the obscured quasar sample @xcite .",
    "there is also a possibility that by biasing ourselves towards such a high @xmath112 , ams12 is super - eddington , in which case we would be overestimating the black hole mass .",

    "* ) .    however , comparing to other high redshift quasars which are strongly lensed , is difficult as is illustrated with f10214 .",
    "the gas and dust properties of f10214 are very similar to ams12 , with approximately equivalent [ ci ] abundances , cooling rate , and line ratios in terms of both co and [ ci ] .",
    "@xcite modelled the co emission in f10214 with lvg models , and found a similar dust temperature to ams12 ( 80 k ) , and determined a range of gas kinetic temperatures from 45 - 80 k ( note their figure 7 has a similar shape to the high temperature region in figure [ fig : cont_plots ] ) , with @xmath152 of [ ci ] @xmath153 k.    @xcite detected co(1 - 0 ) in f10214 , and found there was no evidence for an extended , low - excitation gas component .",
    "for their analysis they assumed a constant magnification factor for the co(1 - 0 ) ( the magnification given by the higher-@xmath71 co lines ) , hence if there is differential magnification of the gas components , their results may be affected .",

    "in this paper we have presented new observations of the obscured quasar ams12 and , along with previous mm and submm observations , we have investigated the dust and gas properties of this object .",

    "the atomic carbon fine structure lines [ ci]@xmath0  and [ ci]@xmath1 , were observed and the [ ci ] excitation temperature was determined to be @xmath18 k , which is significantly lower than t@xmath10 , indicating either [ ci ] is not in lte , or it is from a more extended , lower temperature gas component .    the gas mass found from the co(1 - 0 ) estimate , to be @xmath156 .",
