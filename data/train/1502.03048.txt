    "implicit solvation techniques based on liquid - state theory such as integral equation theory in the interaction - site@xcite or molecular picture@xcite or classical density functional theory@xcite have proven to be successful for the computation of solvation properties .",
    "those methods have shown to give thermodynamic and structural results that get closer and closer to all - atom simulations at a much lower numerical cost .",
    "a current challenge lies in the development and implementations of three - dimensional implicit solvation theories to describe molecular liquids and solutions .",
    "recent developments in this direction have focused on gaussian field@xcite theoretical approaches , or the 3d reference interaction site model ( 3d - rism),@xcite an appealing integral equation theory that has proven recently to be applicable to , e.g. , structure prediction in complex biomolecular systems .",
    "integral equations are , however , restricted by the choice of a closure relation , typically , hypernetted chain ( hnc ) , percus - yevick or kovalenko - hirata . despite their great potential , they remain difficult to control and improve , especially for arbitrary three - dimensional molecules , and they can prove difficult to converge .",
    "we have proposed recently a three dimensional formulation of molecular density functional theory ( mdft ) in the homogeneous reference fluid approximation ( hrf ) to study solvation@xcite .",
    "it has proven successful in studying solvation properties of solutes of arbitrary three - dimensional complexity embedded in various molecular solvents . however , when one comes to water , the hrf approximation fails even qualitatively to predict the solvation of large hydrophobic solutes@xcite .",
    "such limitation can be explained by two essential features of water at ambient conditions that are not properly described by hrf functional .",
    "first , it is known that the solvation free energy of mesoscale apolar solutes can be modeled as the sum of a surface and volume term@xcite . for water , as well as for any solvent at room condition ,",
    "the pressure is very low , inducing negligible @xmath1 term until large radii@xcite .",
    "another key feature is that at ambient condition , water is close to its liquid - gas coexistence . as a consequence",
    "the solvation of big hydrophobic solutes may induce dewetting  @xcite .    in section [ sec : theory",
    "] , we propose an extension of mdft to introduce the liquid - gas coexistence of the solvent and to recover the correct pressure .",
    "then , in section [ sec : results - and - discussion ] , we apply our theory to a model of water and compare the results of solvation of apolar solutes with reference all - atom monte carlo simulations ( mc ) .",
    "while the theory discussed here is generic to any classical density functional theory , it is described below in the framework of the mdft for water introduced recently@xcite .",
    "we start from the single point charge extended ( spc / e ) model of water@xcite , that is , a model comprising one lennard - jones site and 3 partial charges . with mdft ,",
    "one computes the solvation free energy and the solvation structure of a solute of arbitrary shape that acts on the water density field through an external potential .",
    "this last quantity is the sum of an electrostatic vector field @xmath2 and a lennard - jones scalar field @xmath3@xcite . in the general case ,",
    "the functional of the density @xmath4 depends upon the position @xmath5 , and the molecular orientation of the ( rigid ) solvent molecule .",
    "there is no restriction on the molecular or chemical nature of the solvent molecule model , but to be rigid . in that particular model of water ,",
    "@xmath4 can be split into two distinct fields : the molecular density field @xmath6 coupled to @xmath3 and the polarization vector field @xmath7 coupled to @xmath8 .",
    "these fields are themselves functionals of @xmath4 : @xmath9 @xmath10 where @xmath11 denotes the integration over all molecular orientations .",
    "@xmath12 is the molecular polarization of a single water molecule at the origin of a cartesian frame , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the charge and position of the m@xmath15 solvent site .",
    "one should refers to jeanmairet _ _ et al__@xcite for a complete description of mdft for water . without loss of generality",
    ", we will stick in what follows to solutes without partial charges , so that the polarization vector field is zero @xmath16 . as a consequence ,",
    "the free energy is , at dominant order , a functional of @xmath6 only .",

    "the first term thus corresponds to a series expansion in density of @xmath29 , around the density of the hrf , truncated at second order .",
    "truncated information is put into an unknown bridge term , @xmath30 . when @xmath31 , i.e. when we stick to the pure hrf approximation , eq.[eq : fexc ] can be shown to correspond to the hnc approximation of integral equations@xcite .",
    "it will thus be called the hnc functional below .",
    "we suppose now that the correction can be expressed as a polynomial containing all terms of orders higher than 2 in @xmath32 .",
    "eq.[eq : fexc ] can be used only if one knows the direct correlation function , @xmath27 . in this article",
    ", we use an accurate direct correlation function of spc / e water computed by belloni et al . according to the methods discussed in refs .",
    "the fourier transform of the direct correlation function , @xmath33 , is calculated by @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the first rotational invariant of the fourier transform of the total correlation function @xmath36 calculated by puibassset and belloni  @xcite .",
    "this function , as well as all higher rotational invariant components are obtained at short range by monte carlo sampling , and at higher range by integral equation closures , so that small @xmath37 values are very accurate .",
    "the hnc functional has proved to be good enough for studying solvation in acetonitrile and in the stockmayer fluid , but it exhibits wrong behaviors when coming to water@xcite . to improve the description of water we have proposed , as several other authors @xcite , an hard sphere bridge functional that consists in replacing all the unknown orders in @xmath32 of the molecular fluid by the known ones of a hard sphere fluid of a diameter chosen on physical considerations@xcite .",
    "such a correction does improve the solvation of small molecular solutes  @xcite .",
    "however , the hnc functional or the functional with the hard sphere bridge , hnc+hsb , are not able to reproduce to date the solvation of hydrophobic solutes at both small and large length scales .",
    "this is an important discrepancy that originates from the fact that water at room conditions is close to liquid - gas coexistence and has a very low pressure , a fact that is impossible to account for consistently in hnc  @xcite .",
    "we proposed recently a correction that imposes the essential physics@xcite .",
    "it is based on the separation of the functional of eq.[eq : f=00003dfid+fext+fexc ] with the hard sphere correction in a short range and a long range part .",
    "the long range part was then made compatible with the van - der - waals theory of phase coexistence at long range in a spirit similar to the lum - chandler - weeks theory@xcite .",
    "it introduces a coarse - grained density , similar in nature to weighted densities at the core of fundamental measure theories for hard sphere fluids@xcite .",
    "we were then able to reproduce qualitatively the solvation of hydrophobic solutes at all length - scales .",
    "the surface tension was found too high , however , and the solvation structure of qualitative agreement only .",
    "it should be noted that the key role of the pressure of the fluid was not identified in this work : the pressure was consequently not explicitly considered as a control parameter even if this correction had an effect on the pressure . a functional that imposes the coexistence and the right pressure of the fluid is thus presented here .",
    "what we propose is an expression of @xmath30 that is cubic in @xmath32 .",
    "there are two main motivations to such an expression .",
    "( _ i _ ) first , evans et al@xcite and later rickayzen and collaborators@xcite showed that a series expansion of the functional at the quadratic order is thermodynamically inconsistent .",
    "in particular , the pressure of the homogeneous reference fluid predicted by the theory can be overestimated by orders of magnitude .",
    "for instance , for water , the hnc functional predicts a pressure of approximately 11450  bar instead of 1  bar .",
    "( _ ii _ ) also , rickaysen proposed to add the simplest cubic term to the series expansion of @xmath38 in density , and showed it to be sufficient to overcome the thermodynamic inconsistency .",
    "following rickayzen s prescriptions , a `` three body '' bridge term that is cubic in @xmath32 , @xmath39 , is proposed .",
    "we give arguments on the form that should have @xmath39 for water , and how the addition of a physical constraint makes it a single parameter functional .    instead of the simple three body expression of rickayzen based on the overlap of hard bodies , we use here a rather different expression that is motivated by the fact that in water , tetrahedral order due to hydrogen bonding is lost in the hnc approximation and should be reinforced .",
    "note that if the structuration discussed below is particular to water , the idea of including a three body term to improve the local structuration given by the hnc functional is relevant for any solvent .",
    "the three body functional should _",
    "( i ) _ enforce thermodynamic consistency , _",
    "( ii ) _ give back the local order due to @xmath40-body interactions missed so far ( @xmath41 ) , and _",
    "( iii ) _ stay numerically efficient since it is our long - term goal to compete with other implicit methods like pcm ( polarizable continuum model)@xcite that are much cruder but extremely useful .",
    "this last point may seem minor from a physical point of view ; nevertheless , to compute @xmath39 , one should integrate over the whole @xmath42 instead of @xmath43 ( with convolutions ) for hnc : if it is not built efficiently , then it is useless . consequently , in addition to physical motivation , the analytical form of the three body functional introduced here must allow efficient computation .",
    "we start from the idea of the coarse - grained model of tetracoordinated silicon by stillinger and weber@xcite , re - parameterized later for water by molinero and moore@xcite .",
    "their idea relies on an harmonic penalty to non - tetrahedral oxygen - oxygen - oxygen angles . in the mdft framework",

    "the dot product defines the cosine of the angle between three space points , and the quadratic term enforces a tetrahedral angle with @xmath48 .",
    "the function @xmath49 tunes the range of the three body interaction .",
    "as a source of _ local _ structuration of the fluid , it must be short - ranged and must vanish after few solvent radii , at distance @xmath50 .",
    "we propose as molinero and moore @xmath51 @xmath52 is a dimensionless parameter modulating the strength of this oriented - bond term ( hydrogen bond in case of water ) .",
    "the excess term in eq.[eq : f3b expression en r ] is specific to a given fluid and should thus be parameterized once for all for the sake of consistency .",
    "we chose it so that one recovers the thermodynamic consistency and the correct pressure of the bulk liquid .",
    "the grand potential of a system of homogeneous fluid of volume @xmath53 and pressure @xmath54 is equal , by definition , to @xmath55 .",
    "it is @xmath56 in an empty system .",

    "our goal is to predict the hydration structure and free energy of hydrophobic solutes from microscopic to macroscopic length scales .",
    "hydration free energies of nanometric solutes are proportional to the surface of the solute . since this behavior is due to the almost zero pressure of liquid water at room conditions , it is of prime importance to build a density functional that imposes the right pressure .",

    "this height exhibits a peculiar maximum that is characteristic of the solvation of hydrophobic solutes in water@xcite .",
    "it tends toward unity for large radii .",
    "this behavior has been explained as follow : for small radii , the solvent can reorganize around the solute without losing solvent - solvent interactions , that is without losing too much cohesion : the increase of the height of the peak is due to an increase in packing of molecules at the surface of the sphere . for bigger",
    "radii , the perturbation is too high to keep the local structure unchanged : there is a loss of solvent - solvent interactions that has an energetic cost that limits the accumulation of molecules at the surface of the sphere and induces dewetting eventually . as a summary ,",

    "mdft - hnc is in agreement with the simulations only for very small radius ( below @xmath81 ) but does not reproduce the plateau for bigger radius ( @xmath82 ) , this is consistent with the structural results , the transition between the two regimes is missed .",

    "<S> the solvation of hydrophobic solutes in water is special because liquid and gas are almost at coexistence . in the common hypernetted chain approximation to integral equations , or equivalently in the homogenous reference fluid of molecular density functional theory , </S>",
    "<S> coexistence is not taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> hydration structures and energies of nanometer - scale hydrophobic solutes are thus incorrect . in this article , we propose a bridge functional that corrects this thermodynamic inconsistency by introducing a metastable gas phase for the homogeneous solvent . </S>",
    "<S> we show how this can be done by a third order expansion of the functional around the bulk liquid density that imposes the right pressure and the correct second order derivatives . </S>",
    "<S> although this theory is not limited to water , we apply it to study hydrophobic solvation in water at room temperature and pressure and compare the results to all - atom simulations . </S>",
    "<S> the solvation free energy of small molecular solutes like @xmath0-alkanes and hard sphere solutes whose radii range from angstroms to nanometers is now in quantitative agreement with reference all atom simulations . </S>",
