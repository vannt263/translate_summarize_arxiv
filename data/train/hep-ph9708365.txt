    "<S> the effect of mixing of the vector and axial vector correlation functions in the nuclear medium arising from the interaction of nuclear pions with corresponding interpolating currents is considered . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the mass difference between @xmath0 and @xmath1 meson gets smaller with the increase of the nuclear density reflecting the phenomena of partial restoration of chiral symmetry whereas the absolute values of meson masses may both decrease and increase in nuclear medium depending on the model used for the phenomenological spectral density .    </S>",
    "<S> pacs : 11.30.rd , 11.55.hx , 21.65.+f    during the last few years the behaivior of vector mesons in the dence and/or hot matter attracted much attention . among them </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0-meson is of particular interest as , due to rather significant width , @xmath0-meson decays mostly in nuclear interior and dilepton invariant spectrum should thus carry the direct information on the @xmath0-meson properties in the nuclear medium @xcite . from the theoretical point of view </S>",
    "<S> the situation is far from clear . </S>",
    "<S> according to brown and rho @xcite the rho - meson mass should decrease in baryon matter like the chiral order parameter ( br - scaling ) . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , several calculations in the framework of qcd sum rules @xcite , devoted to the study of density dependence of the vector meson masses , suggest significant drop of the @xmath0-meson mass with density ( about 20@xmath2 at the normal nuclear density ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is the remarkable fact since the decrease of the rho - meson mass in the nuclear matter may indicate the partial restoration of chiral symmetry . in @xcite nuclear matter </S>",
    "<S> was assumed to be a system of nucleons with finite density and the phenomenological part of the qcd sum rules , represented by some spectral density which was taken to be a delta function plus a continuum , whereas in @xcite this spectral density was treated using the vector dominance model that was extended to include the delta - hole polarization initiated by pions produced by the @xmath0 meson decay in nuclear matter . </S>",
    "<S> however , in the very recent paper @xcite it was shown that qcd sum rules analysis results in small change of the @xmath0-meson mass provided the @xmath0n scattering amplitude is properly taken into account . moreover , some effective models @xcite also lead only to marginal changes of the @xmath0-meson mass in the matter .    </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , chiral symmetry alone can not predict the actual behavior of the in - medium @xmath0-meson mass . </S>",
    "<S> instead , chiral symmetry dictates the correlators of the chiral partners to be identical in a chirally symmetric world . in our case </S>",
    "<S> the vector and axial correlation functions should become equal in the chirally restored phase . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the vector and axial correlators get mixed when the chiral symmetry is partially restored . </S>",
    "<S> such kind of admixture was found in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite in the case of finite temperature . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we address the same issue to the system with finite baryon density .    </S>",
    "<S> the axial vector correlator includes the contributions from pion and @xmath3 meson . </S>",
    "<S> the pionic part of the axial correlator can be determined rather well at least in the leading order in density , since pion mass remains close to it vacuum value even for the normal nuclear density and pion decay constant @xmath4 scales with density like @xmath5 condensate , in - medium behaviour of which can be determined by model - independent way @xcite in the linear in nuclear density approximation . </S>",
    "<S> the contribution in the axial correlator which is due to @xmath3 meson , causes more problems . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , there are neither theoretical calculations nor attemps to determine the in - medium properties of @xmath3 experimentally . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , to study the vector axial mixing one needs to assume some in - medium behaviour of the unmixed correlators . </S>",
    "<S> one notes that , whereas the effect of the mixing is inevitably present as long as chiral symmetry gets restored , one seems impossible to determine quantitatively the in - medium masses of the chiral partners caused by too large uncertainties already on the level of the unmixed vector and axial correlators . </S>",
    "<S> however one can determine , at least qualitatively , the density dependence of the @xmath0-@xmath3 mass difference , since this is a parameter characterizing the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry .    </S>",
    "<S> in - medium behaviour of hadrons can be studied theoretically by calculating the two - point correlator of the corresponding current . in the particalar case of the @xmath0-meson the correlator </S>",
    "<S> is given by @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the isovector current and the matrix element is taken over the ground states of the system with finite baryon density @xmath0 . in the case of the noninteracting nucleons </S>",
    "<S> the expression above is identical to that , calculated by hatsuda et.al @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , when nuclear pions are explicitely included , the direct interaction of those pions with the vector currents may induce the mixing of the vector and axial correlators . </S>",
    "<S> admixture of the opposite parity channel arises when two pions interact with vector currents at points 0 and/or @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> the piece of the correlator where the vector current interacts directly with the nuclear pion that is emitted and then absorbed by the nuclear matter can be written in the form @xmath9 in the nuclear matter the pions are virtual so one needs to consider all possible time orderings where two pions are either emitted or absorbed by the matter . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding pieces of the correlator can be represented by the expressions similar to eq.([piinout ] ) but with two forward - or backward going pions . </S>",
    "<S> one has , respectively @xmath10 and @xmath11 where @xmath12 .    </S>",
    "<S> we consider the nuclear pions in the chiral limit so that the nuclear wave functions appearing in the momentum and space integrals are the same in the leading chiral order implying that in this order pion absorption or / and emission does not change the nuclear wave functions . </S>",
    "<S> one notes , that similar approach @xcite was used earlier to remove the unwanted pieces forbidden by chiral symmetry in the qcd sum rules for the nucleon mass in matter . in some sence in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and in the present paper the same issue , namely the consistency of the qcd sum rules calculations of hadron properties in the nuclear matter , is addressed . in case of @xmath0-meson </S>",
    "<S> this amounts to necessity to include into consideration the in - medium behaviour of its chiral partner , @xmath3 meson . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , any study of the @xmath0-meson mass in matter is not fully consistent with chiral symmetry , unless the in - medium modifications of @xmath3 meson is included . using the soft - pion theorem </S>",
    "<S> one has @xmath13\\right]|\\psi\\rangle , \\label{soft}\\ ] ] while the matrix elements in both ( [ twopiin ] ) and ( [ twopiout ] ) also reduce to the same expression . calculating the double commutator and making use of the usial expansion of the pion field in terms of creation and annihilation operators and commutation relations of current algebra @xmath14=i\\epsilon^{abc}a^{c}_\\nu$ ] one can get the following expression for @xmath15 @xmath16 and similar expression for the axial correlator @xmath17 @xmath18 here @xmath19(@xmath20 ) is the correlator of the vector ( axial ) currents calculated in the approximation of the noninteracting nucleons with finite density . </S>",
    "<S> we defined @xmath21 and used the relation @xmath22 where @xmath23 mev is the leading nonanalytic term in the @xmath24 corresponding to the contribution of the pion mass term to the nucleon mass and @xmath25 is the pion field . from the eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( 6 - 7 ) one can see that the complete mixing arises at @xmath26 but this estimate should not be taken too seriously , since both the in - medium condensates and phenomenological spectral anzats get highly model dependent at such densities and reliable conclusion can not be drawn . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the soft - pion approximation may no longer be valid near the point of chiral symmetry restoration . </S>",
    "<S> it is worth mentioning that , even at the normal nuclear density , where the change of the two - quark condensate can almost entirely be described by the model independent , linear in nuclear density term , only the qualitative conclusions about the in - medium behaviour of axial and vector meson mass difference can be made . </S>",
    "<S> this is basically due to unknown behaviour of the correlator of the axial currents in the nuclear medium . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that density dependence of @xmath20 is the same as that for @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> besides , the higher twists contributions and the factorization approximation , which is clearly too crude to be used in nuclear matter , make the ope for the vector correlator full of uncertainties too . </S>",
    "<S> one notes , that there is no distinction between the longitudinal and transverse directions in nuclear medium and , as such , the corresponding correlators can be related to each other @xmath27 and @xmath28 so only the longitudinal correlation function is really needed . </S>",
    "<S> representing the correlators by the standard expressions containing pole terms plus continuum contributions , starting at some effective thresholds and then applying the borel transform one can get the following sum rules @xmath29 and @xmath30 the unmixed correlators are given by @xmath31 @xmath32 here @xmath33 and @xmath34 is the density dependent residue and mass of the corresponding hadron calculated without the pion corrections . in case of the @xmath0-meson we used the results obtained in ref.@xcite for @xmath33 and @xmath34 . in principle </S>",
    "<S> effective thresholds are also different with and without pionic corrections . </S>",
    "<S> however , the numerical effect is small and , therefore , we keep effective thresholds the same . in the practical calculations we used the values @xmath35=2.2gev and @xmath36=1.5gev . </S>",
    "<S> as we already mentioned , the in - meidium behaviour of @xmath37 and @xmath38 is completely unknown so we assumed that they scale like the corresponding parameters of the vector spectral density , starting from the values @xmath39 and @xmath40 at zero density . </S>",
    "<S> the density dependence of @xmath41 can be found from the in - medium analog of the gor relation @xmath42 making use of the fact that the pion mass remains almost unchanged at least at normal nuclear density and using the values of @xmath43 both with and without pionic corrections obtained by weise et.al @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one notes that at @xmath44 the value of @xmath45 is quite close to @xmath46 since at normal nuclear density meson corrections gives only minor contribution to the quark condensate @xcite . in order to obtain the expressions for @xmath47 and @xmath48 </S>",
    "<S> one needs to get rid of the unknown factors @xmath49 and @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> it can be done by differentiating the sum rules over the variable @xmath51 and dividing the obtained expression by the original sum rules . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding masses @xmath48 , @xmath47 are shown in fig.1 as the functions of the nuclear density . </S>",
    "<S> one can see from fig.1 that , although the rho mass still decreases with an increase of the nuclear density , the size of this effect is significantly smaller than in the case of the unmixed correlator , whereas the @xmath3 meson mass drops considerably faster resulting in the convergence of the rho and @xmath3 masses . it may indicate the tendency toward the partial chiral symmetry restoration . </S>",
    "<S> one can also try to use the other model for the phenomenological part of the vector correlator developed in ref.@xcite and leading to the almost unchanged in - medium mass of the rho - meson . </S>",
    "<S> as one can see from fig.2 in this case @xmath48 grows with density while @xmath47 still decreases , albeit quite slowly . </S>",
    "<S> it is worth mentioning that , in spite of the distinctions in the density dependence for the vector and axial meson masses , obtained in different models , the mass difference @xmath52 remains approximately the same in all cases . </S>",
    "<S> however , one needs to stress again that the above results are obtained under the assumption that @xmath19 and @xmath20 scale identically with density . </S>",
    "<S> one could do the complete qcd sum rules calculations for the axial channel but the uncertainties will be at least as large as those for qcd sum rules analysis of the in - medium rho - mass so it seems unlikely that such culculations will significantly reduce the ambiguities in the value of the @xmath53 mass in the nuclear matter .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we have presented the analysis of the pionic corrections in the qcd sum rules for the vector and axial vector mesons in the nuclear matter . </S>",
    "<S> it was found that such corrections result in the effect of mixing of the correlators of the opposite parity , calculated in the approximation when the nuclear matter was treated as a medium of the noninteracting nucleons with some finite density . </S>",
    "<S> the mass difference between the chiral partners @xmath0 and @xmath54 decreases with the growth of the nuclear density indicating the tendency towards the partial restoration of chiral symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> however , chiral symmetry alone can not predict the actual values of the meson masses in the nuclear medium due to uncertainties both in the in - medium quark and gluon condensates ( especially in the 4-quark condensate ) and in the phenomenological spectral densities . </S>",
    "<S> the standard anzats represented by the sum of pole and continuum seems to be unadequate to get reliable density dependence of the in - medium masses . in order to go beyond the normal nuclear density one needs to consider some additional effects . </S>",
    "<S> first , the soft - pion approximation may become invalid if the density is high enough so at some point the finite pion momenta should be taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> second , at high densities , when the @xmath0-@xmath3 mass difference may become comparable with the typical energy of the nuclear transitions , the exitation of the residual nucleus should be included so that the effect of mixing of vector and axial vector correlators will be represented by the sum over @xmath55 states with certain parity to maintain the corresponding conservation law . </S>",
    "<S> besides , at high densities the direct interactions of the isovector current with heavy scalar mesons may also give a significant contribution . </S>"
