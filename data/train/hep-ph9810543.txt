    "the interference between states of slightly different masses has appeared in quantum mechanics .",
    "inspired by the work of gell - mann and pais , bruno pontecorvo turned to consider the possibility of quantum mechanical mixing in another neutral particle - the neutrino . in 1957",
    "he first suggested that a neutrino may oscillate into its antipartner [ 3 ] .",
    "oscillation among the different kinds of neutrinos was then proposed by maki , nakagawa and sakata in 1962 [ 4 ] and later by many others [ 5 ] .",
    "the neutral @xmath8 @xmath9boson system is not the only one where the quantum mechanical mass mixing can be considered .",
    "we can expect to observe the same phenomena in other neutral boson systems : @xmath10 @xmath11 and @xmath12 @xmath13 generally , flavour oscillations of particles can occur when states produced and detected in a given experiment , are superpositions of two or more eigenstates with different masses .",
    "the oscillation of k and b meson has been observed experimentally in 1961 [ 6 ] and later [ 7 ] and has been used to place stringent constraints on physics beyond the standard model . if neutrinos are massive and oscillate it is possible to resolve the well - known solar neutrino problem [ 8 ] .",
    "there are also first experiments in which the neutrino oscillations are observed [ 9 ] .",
    "the flavour oscillation of particles is a very fascinating demonstration of quantum mechanics in the macroscopic world .",
    "it has served as a model for many interesting systems and problems .",

    "we will concentrate only on the quantum mechanical description of particle oscillations .",

    "first of all we should mention that interference between states with different masses is not allowed in non - relativistic quantum mechanics .",
    "the galilean invariance forbids a coherent superposition of such states ( the so called bargman superselection rule [ 10 ] ) . beyond the non - relativistic limit such restrictions",
    "do not hold ( which clearly follows from experiment ) .",
    "it means that all of our considerations should be done in relativistic quantum mechanics ( nevertheless non - relativistic approximations are possible ) .",
    "first , we would like to describe briefly the traditional approach to the particle oscillation problem .",
    "this treatment is simple and elegant but immediately raises a number of conceptual questions .",
    "we specify more of them ( chapter 2 ) .",
    "next we show the wave packet treatment , where some of the problems disappear ( chapter 3 ) .",
    "the current density approach which is closely connected with the experimental setting , is described in chapter 4 .",
    "the problem of constructing the probability current density for a particle with undetermined mass is also considered there .",
    "next , in chapter 5 , we give some remarks on the field theoretical approach to particle oscillations .",
    "usually ( as in the case of neutrino oscillations ) the oscillating particle is not directly observed . only particles accompanying neutrinos , hadrons and charged leptons created in the decay",
    "are observed .",
    "the proper approach should take all these circumstances into account .",
    "the creation of the neutrino in the source , its propagation to the detector and the detection process are treated in the framework of quantum field theory as one large feynman diagram .    in chapter 6",
    "we discuss the controversial problem of the oscillation of particles recoiling against kaons or neutrinos from the production process .",
    "a detailed approach using wave packets explains the problem of four - momentum nonconservation raised in the literature .",
    "in chapter 7 we discuss the modern example of an einstein - podolsky - rosen correlation in k@xmath14and @xmath15 systems .",

    "let us assume that at @xmath16 neutrino with flavour @xmath29 was born with momentum @xmath30 perfectly defined ( as for example neutrino @xmath31 in the pion decay @xmath32 ) . at this time",

    "it follows that the oscillation will disappear ( the @xmath56 does not depend on @xmath57 ) if ( i ) all neutrino masses are equal @xmath58 and/or ( ii ) only diagonal elements of the mixing matrix @xmath59 do not vanish .",
    "the presented arguments seem to be clear and elegant but they are wrong .",
    "many conceptual questions arise when we look at the presentation shown above .",
    "a complete treatment of particle oscillation must address the following additional issues .",
    "+ ( 1 ) a necessary condition for particle oscillation to occur is that particle source and detector are localized within the region @xmath60 much smaller than the oscillation length @xmath61@xmath62 + ( 2 ) from eqs .",
    "( 4 ) and ( 7 ) we see that different mass eigenstates are produced and detected coherently .",
    "this is possible only if the momentum @xmath63 and energy @xmath64 of the oscillating particle are spread in such a way that the error in @xmath65 measurements given by @xmath66 ^{1/2}\\ ] ] is larger than @xmath67@xmath68 if this condition is not satisfied and @xmath69 then also @xmath70 but from the uncertainty relation @xmath71 and eq.(17 ) gives @xmath72 and the wave packet approach must be constructed .",
    "\\(3 ) the energy and momentum conservation in processes in which oscillating particles are created ( e.g. @xmath73or @xmath74 implies that different mass eigenstate components have different energy and momentum [ 14 ] .",
    "approaches where all oscillating particles have the same momentum and different energies [ 11,12 ] , or the same energies and different momenta [ 15 , 16 , 17 ] are conceptually not correct .",
    "\\(4 ) in the traditional approach to find the oscillation probability we calculate the wave functions@xmath75 overlap ( compare eqs .",
    "( 6 ) and ( 10 ) ) .",
    "this procedure gives the probability which depends on time . in the real experiment the distance between the source and the detector is known ( not the moment in which the measurement is done ) . to transform @xmath76 into @xmath77 the classical formula @xmath78 is invoked .",
    "however to find the probability that the beam of particles produced at @xmath79 will reach a physical detector at a distance @xmath80 the current density @xmath81 should be integrated over the surface of the detector and over the time of observation [ 18 ] @xmath82 in such an approach there is no problem of how to change @xmath83 into @xmath57 .",
    "\\(5 ) in case of neutrinos additional conceptual problems arise because neutrinos are not  seen  directly .",
    "the only things which can be  seen  are hadrons or / and charged leptons in points where neutrinos are produced and detected .",
    "so in a realistic description , the external ( initial and final ) particles should be described by wave packets , and the mass - eigenstate neutrinos should propagate from the production region to a detector [ 19 , 20 ] .",
    "all points which have been mentioned above are not only purely academic . we do not try to derive in a more precise way something which is known from the beginning .",
    "we will see that the more precise approach to the particles@xmath84 oscillation phenomenon gives us new predictions and elucidates mysteries in many points .",
    "on the other hand we will see quantum mechanics in action on macroscopic distances .",
    "the wave packet approach to neutrino oscillation was first proposed by b. kayser [ 13 ] and later considered in more detail in [ 21 , 22 ] . nowadays",
    "the neutral boson oscillation is also treated in the same way .",
    "we will present the formalism for neutrinos , but everything can be repeated also for bosons .    in eq.(7 ) states @xmath34 have definite energy and momentum ( also the spin direction of neutrinos is defined ) so for the sake of precision we should write @xmath85 we can easily construct a state with momentum distributed around a mean value @xmath86 . let us assume that , instead of a plane wave , our new state @xmath34 ( eq.(20 ) ) has a gaussian form , which in the momentum representation , is given by @xmath87 ^{3/2}}\\exp \\left [ -\\frac{\\left ( \\stackrel{\\rightarrow } { p}-\\stackrel{\\rightarrow } { p}_a% \\right ) ^2}{4\\sigma _ { pp}^2}\\right ] , \\ ] ] where the width @xmath88 is the same for each massive neutrino in the production @xmath89 process and the same along all three directions .",
    "the average momenta @xmath86 of the different mass eigenstates are determined by the kinematics of the production process .",
    "in the wave packet approach , the flavour states @xmath90 after time t ( given by eq.(9 ) in the plane wave formalism ) are now @xmath91 where @xmath92    the same states in the position representation @xmath93 are given by @xmath94 where now the function @xmath95 is defined by @xmath96 since the gaussian wave packet in momentum space is picked around the average momentum @xmath86 we can neglect the spreading of the wave packet and approximate @xmath97 where @xmath98 then @xmath99 ^{3/2}}\\exp \\left [ i\\left ( \\stackrel{\\rightarrow } { p_a}\\stackrel{\\rightarrow   } { x}-e_at\\right ) -\\frac{\\left ( \\stackrel{\\rightarrow } { x}-\\stackrel{% \\rightarrow } { v_a}t\\right ) ^2}{4\\sigma _ { xp}^2}\\right ] , \\ ] ] with the width @xmath100 in coordinate space given by @xmath101 as earlier in eq.(10 ) , to find the amplitude of the flavour changing process , we project the states @xmath102 on the flavour states @xmath103@xmath104",
    "if @xmath103 is the same as before ( eq.(7 ) ) this means that the momentum of each neutrino @xmath105 is measured precisely .",
    "but this is not realistic , so let us assume that also detection process is characterized by the spatial coherence width @xmath106 connected with the uncertainties in momentum and energy measurements @xmath107 the average values of the momentum @xmath108 are the same as in the incoming wave packets eq.(22 ) . to calculate the spatial decomposition of the detecting flavour state we have to take into account that the detector is placed at a distance @xmath109 from the origin of the coordinates , so we have @xmath110 and after the same approximation as before ( eq.(24 ) ) we obtain @xmath111 @xmath112 is given exactly by eq.(25 ) after replacements @xmath113 the amplitude of the flavour changing process is given by the overlap @xmath114 we have to remember that the origin of coordinates @xmath115 and @xmath116 are not the same , so @xmath117 and we have @xmath118 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath119 where the total production and detection width is now @xmath120 everything we have done up to now can be applied either to neutrino or neutral boson oscillations .",
    "the only assumption about the narrow wave packets in the momentum representation ( eq.(24 ) ) can be used in both cases .",
    "next we calculate the oscillation probability for neutrinos which are relativistic @xmath121 and following ref.[22 ] we approximate @xmath122 and @xmath123 e is the energy determined by kinematics of the production process for a massless neutrino and @xmath124 is a dimensionless quantity of order unity .",
    "we will see ( next chapter ) how the relativistic approximation for neutrinos causes that the production and detection processes can be factorized out and the standard quantum mechanical approach describes the oscillation phenomenon properly .    in all realistic experiments the distance @xmath109 is a fixed and known quantity , whereas time t is not measured .",
    "the quantity which we measure is the time integral of the probability . now",
    "the time integral can be done , and it is possible to avoid the not properly legitimated ( in quantum mechanics ) replacement @xmath125    the time integral for @xmath126 ( eq.(34 ) ) can be done [ 22 ] and after normalization @xmath127 , instead of eq.(11 ) we have @xmath128 the oscillation lengths are the same as before ( eq.(12 ) ) , namely @xmath129 and @xmath130 known as * coherence lengths * [ 23 ] are given by @xmath131 comparing eq.(37 ) to the usual expression for the neutrino oscillation probability we can see that two additional terms appear .",
    "the second factor @xmath132 is equal to unity if @xmath133 this inequality must be satisfied to observe any oscillation .",
    "the presence of the term ( 40 ) which goes to zero for @xmath134 reflects the requirement which we qualitatively discussed in the previous chapter : to see the oscillations , the localization of the source and the detector must be much better determined than the oscillation length .",
    "the first factor @xmath135 was predicted long ago [ 23 ] .",
    "it is connected with the fact that two wave packets each with different momentum and energy , have slightly different group velocities .",
    "it means that after some time the mass eigenstate wave packets no longer overlap and can not interfere to produce oscillations .",
    "it is very easy to predict the value of coherence length .",
    "if both wave packets have width @xmath100 along the direction of propagation and the difference between group velocities is @xmath136 then we can expect that after traveling a distance l @xmath137 both wave packets cease to overlap each other .",
    "this l is just the coherence length .    for relativistic neutrinos , using approximations given by eq.(36 )",
    ", we reproduce @xmath130 from eq.(39 ) , to a factor of @xmath138 we can expect that the coherence length becomes longer if the spreading of the wave packets is taken into account .",
    "it is indeed the case as it was proved in ref.[21 ] .    from eq.(39 )",
    "we see that the coherence length @xmath130 is proportional to @xmath139 and not only to @xmath100 as in eq.(42 ) .",
    "it means that precise measurements of momenta of all particles appearing in the detection process ( which implies small @xmath106 , thus large @xmath140 ) can increase the coherence length [ 22 , 24 ] .",
    "this is a wonderful example of quantum mechanics in action .",
    "a measurement can restore the coherence .",
    "two wave packets having negligible overlap in the detector ( thus without detector influence they can not interfere , and the oscillation disappears , @xmath141 ) , because of precise measurements @xmath142 may still interfere to give rise to oscillations @xmath143 .",
    "this feature of quantum mechanics disagrees with causality .",
    "however , it is not the first time when quantum mechanics is at variance with common sense .",
    "but eq.(37 ) also restores some common sense .",
    "measurements of momenta and energies of detected particles can not be too precise if we want to maintain the particle oscillation . as a matter of fact",
    ", we have a longer and longer coherence length , but on the other hand increasing @xmath144 makes the position of the detector to be more and more undefined . if @xmath145 the wave packets of neutrinos @xmath52 and @xmath146 lose coherence ( eq.(40 ) ) , the oscillation between them is wash away .",
    "we see , particularly , that the plane wave approach and oscillations are incompatible . for a plane wave",
    "@xmath147 @xmath148 and the factor ( 40 ) teaches us that oscillations disappear .",
    "there are also approaches where the neutrino oscillation is treated in a manifestly lorentz invariant way [ 25 ] .",
    "the final answer is exactly the same as was presented up to now , but for one difference . in the fully covariant treatment , besides the spatial width @xmath149 also temporal width @xmath150 should appear .",
    "it causes only one change in the oscillation probability formula eq.(37 ) . instead of the spatial width",
    "@xmath149 a new effective one , @xmath151 appears in the coherence length ( 39 ) and in the factor ( 40 ) @xmath152 where @xmath105 and @xmath153 are group velocities of wave packets .",
    "if @xmath154 is given by the lifetime of particles which produce neutrino , @xmath154 = @xmath155 @xmath156 $ ] ( e.g. pions , kaons or muons ) then the second term in ( 43 ) is usually much bigger than the first one and the role of factor ( 40 ) becomes more important .",
    "we should stress however that the independent widths of spatial and temporal characteristics of wave packets cause that freely propagating particles are not necessary on mass - shell . if we insist to have our particle on mass shell ( all the time , not for mean values exclusively , which is equivalent with the requirement that our particle s state satisfies the equation of motion ) only the momentum ( or only the energy ) distribution should be applied .",
    "then energy ( or momentum ) is distributed also but in agreement with the on - shell relation @xmath157 such an approach , which we also used in our presentation above is the standard one .",
    "a typical experiment which tries to observe particle oscillations measures the flux of flavour @xmath41 type particles in the detector localized at some distance l from the source which produces particles with flavour @xmath158 the time of measurements is not known .",
    "usually typical measurements last hours , days or even years ( like the observation of solar neutrinos ) .",
    "so the most appropriate way to find the probability ( or number of particles ) to cross the surface @xmath159 of the detector ( see fig . ( 1 ) ) is to integrate the probability current density over the surface and integrate the result once more over the duration of measurements @xmath160    this procedure seems to be so easy and natural , that we can ask why people try to use other , more complicated methods .",
    "the answer is very simple , there is a problem with the correct definition of the current @xmath161 this current should be defined for particles which we measure , that is @xmath162 or @xmath31 .",
    "but these particles have undefined masses , and we do not know how to define the probability current for such particles .",
    "the problem is more general : how to define properly the creation and annihilation operators for undefined mass states [ 26,27 ] ? here we will not discuss all trials [ 26 ] to resolve this problem in quantum field theory .",
    "we will concentrate only on a simple example of definition of the current @xmath163 for particles with flavour @xmath164 for relativistic currents the problem has not been solved . for kaons",
    "it was done in ref.[18 ] . in the non - relativistic case the free schrdinger equation for particles with mass @xmath35",
    "can be written in the form @xmath165 which is the appropriate non - relativistic limit of either klein - gordon or dirac equations @xmath166 .",
    "for the schrdinger equation ( eq.(45 ) ) we know how to define the probability current : @xmath167 for which the usual continuity equation is satisfied @xmath168 the problem arises while we try to define the current for the states @xmath169 which are an orthogonal mixture of two states with different masses @xmath35 and @xmath170 .",
    "we expect that , because of mass mixing , the currents for @xmath171 will not be conserved [ 18 ] , so let us propose a modified  continuity equation  for @xmath172 states in the form @xmath173 with the following requirements , concerning the new current @xmath174[18]@xmath175 that : ( 1 ) only  velocity  terms with one gradient are included , ( 2 ) for @xmath35 @xmath176 @xmath177 the  diffusion  terms @xmath178 should vanish @xmath179 , and ( 3 ) the sum of both flavour currents @xmath180 is conserved @xmath181 the currents @xmath182 and the diffusion terms @xmath178 can be found .",

    "there is , however , one objection concerning this approach .",
    "the flavour currents which we use are not conserved .",
    "this nonconservation is given by the diffusion term ( eq.(52 ) ) which is proportional to @xmath190 .",
    "so , we can expect that all our calculations have been done with the some precision . then",
    ", if the result is proportional to @xmath191 our probability flux calculations give the correct answer .",
    "the diffusion terms will change the result in higher powers of @xmath192",
    "there are several papers where authors investigate the neutrino oscillation problem in the framework of quantum field theory [ 19,20,24,28,29,30 ] .",
    "what are the main reasons for those studies ?",
    "first until now , to describe particle oscillations , we have used states with undefined masses ( eq.(4 ) for kaons and eq.(7 ) for neutrinos ) .",
    "but , as we have seen in the previous chapter , there is a problem of proper definition of such states [ 26 ] . only in the extremely relativistic limit",
    "the flavour states are defined correctly [ 27 ] .",
    "as we will see , in quantum field theory the particle oscillation can be treated without resort to weak eigenstates .",
    "secondly , we have completely neglected the effect of the production and detection processes .",
    "it has been shown [ 27 ] , that the neutrino oscillation probability is independent from the details of the production and detection processes only in the case of extremely relativistic neutrinos .    and finally , in real neutrino oscillation experiments only associated particles , hadrons and charged leptons are observed .",
    "neutrinos are not prepared and not observed directly .",
    "one can measure the energy and momentum distributions of other particles which appear in the production and detection processes . as we will see , only the quantum field theoretical approach",
    "gives the opportunity to express the neutrino oscillation probability in terms of measured quantities .",
    "let us now describe briefly how the particle oscillation is treated in field theory .",
    "as in ref.[20,30 ] we will describe the process of neutrino production ( p ) and neutrino detection ( d ) as one feynman diagram with a virtual neutrino propagating itself on macroscopic distances between the source and the detector .",
    "let us consider the process [ 20,30 ] @xmath193 where @xmath194 and @xmath195 ( @xmath196 and @xmath197 ) are the particles in the production ( detection ) processes .",
    "the production and detection processes are localized in coordinates @xmath198 and times @xmath199 ( see fig.2 ) .",
    "all initial @xmath200 and final @xmath201 particles are described by wave packets .",
    "their shapes depend on the measurement precision in the production and detection processes .",
    "the amplitudes for the full process can be written in the form @xmath202 we can see that there are no neutrinos in the initial and final states . only particles which really appear in the production and detection ",
    "equipments  are observed .",
    "neutrinos with mass @xmath203propagate virtually between the source and the detector and are described by the feynman propagators @xmath204 we will not present the details of all calculations , which are straightforward but tedious .",
    "a clear presentation can be found in refs .",
    "[ 20 , 28 , 30 ] .",
    "we will concentrate only on the discussion of the final results .",
    "first of all , neutrinos are not directly present in eq.(55 ) , but this is not necessary .",
    "the amplitude @xmath205 depends on points @xmath206 and @xmath207 where neutrinos were born and detected , and this is enough to study oscillations .",
    "next , the amplitude @xmath205 depends also on amplitudes of the production and detection processes and the full structure of @xmath208 is the following @xmath209 where @xmath210 describes the process of neutrino creation and annihilation .",
    "the standard oscillation formula is recovered only if @xmath210 can be factorized .",
    "this happens , when amplitudes @xmath210 become independent of neutrino masses , @xmath211 .",
    "if all neutrinos are relativistic then @xmath212 and the oscillation probability can be defined .    in case of relativistic neutrinos the time integrated neutrino flavour changing probability is given by the similar formula to eq.(37 ) with two changes .",
    "first , the dumping factor ( eq.(40 ) ) is slightly modified and now equals @xmath213 where @xmath124 is the same quantity as before ( eq.(36 ) ) , but @xmath214 is the new factor which depends on the production and detection dynamics and can be large ( e.g. @xmath215 is possible [ 30 ] ) .",
    "the second modification is a little different definition of the coherence length . instead of ( eq.(39 ) )",
    "we now have @xmath216 with the same factor @xmath214 as in eq.(58 ) .",
    "the oscillation length @xmath217 and the spatial width @xmath144 are given by the same formulae as before ( eqs.(38 ) and ( 35 ) ) .",
    "there is also an additional very important difference between the present and the former wave packet approaches .",
    "before , @xmath100 and @xmath218 ( eq.(35 ) were two spatial widths of neutrinos specified in some way by the production and detection processes respectively .",
    "now , these quantities are defined by spatial widths of hadrons and leptons which are measured .",
    "it turns out ( for detail see ref.[30 ] )    @xmath219 and @xmath220 the widths of observed particles in the production and detection processes define the width of  the neutrino ",
    ", even if there is no place in this approach for physical neutrinos ( only virtual ones appear ) . in the configuration space ( eq.(60 ) )",
    "the sum of the inverse squares of widths for the observed particles gives the inverse square of the resultant width .",
    "then the smallest ingredient width dominates the values of @xmath100 or @xmath221 .",
    "it is the opposite for the resultant width @xmath149 where @xmath222 @xmath223 from the definition of the momentum width @xmath224 , it follows that it is just opposite in momentum space , so then @xmath225 but @xmath226 and the same for particles in the detection process .",
    "we can see explicitly , that precise measurements of momenta of all particles involved in the neutrino detection process ( small @xmath227 and @xmath228 ) give a small resultant width @xmath106 , thus large @xmath140 and large @xmath144 . the same subtle thing , which we have discussed before in chapter 3 , that the final measurement is able to recover",
    "the interference , in the present interpretation has found a much stronger background .",
    "for many years oscillations of particles like kaons or neutrinos were treated in isolation .",
    "the circumstances in which oscillating particles were produced have not been considered . recently",
    "a series of papers has appeared [ 31 , 32 ] , in which the kinematics of the production process have been taken into account in detail .",
    "authors claim that , because the produced oscillating particles have neither momentum nor energy defined in explicit way , this fact should have consequences not only for them but also for the recoiling particles .",
    "let us consider the @xmath229 production in the reaction @xmath230 or the neutrino production in the @xmath231 decay @xmath232 if the invariant mass of the initial system is denoted by m @xmath233 or @xmath234 then energies @xmath235 and momenta @xmath236 of outgoing particles depend on masses @xmath237 of @xmath238 or @xmath31 . in the cm system",

    "are also defined by ( 65 ) .",
    "authors of ref .",
    "[ 31 ] claim that if @xmath229 or @xmath244 oscillate , also the recoiling particles @xmath242 or @xmath243 do the same .",
    "if it is true , the existence of such phenomena could give a chance for indirect observation of neutrino oscillations which are very difficult to observe in a direct way .",
    "however other papers have immediately appeared [ 33 , 34 , 35 ] where authors have been strongly against the oscillation of particles produced in association with kaons or neutrinos .",
    "we will present here our approach to the problem [ 36 ] which also supports the opinion against a visible oscillation of the associated particles . to fix notations",
    ", everything will be described for the process ( 63 ) , but equally well we can show the lack of visible muon oscillations in the pion decay ( 64 ) .",
    "first of all we would like to specify the kind of oscillation , we can consider for @xmath242 ( or @xmath243 ) .",
    "two @xmath242 s with different masses do not exist .",
    "but even without mass differences the @xmath242 s are produced in association with the long - live @xmath245 and the short - live @xmath246 as @xmath245 and @xmath247 have different masses @xmath242 s will be produced in two orthogonal states with different energy and momentum . @xmath248 and @xmath249 where @xmath250 and @xmath251 are the momentum and the energy of the @xmath252 in total cm frame of the process ( 63 ) .",
    "we do not know in which state @xmath253 or @xmath254 the @xmath242 particles are produced , so let us assume that at @xmath16 they are produced in some state which is a linear combination of both states ( 66 ) @xmath255 as both ingredient states have different energy they evolve with time in a different way , so there is some chance that after some period of time the state @xmath256 will oscillate to the orthogonal one @xmath257 do we have a chance to recognize both states @xmath258 and @xmath259 ? in the neutral bosons system , because of the strangeness conservation , @xmath229 and @xmath260interact strongly in a completely different way and are easily distinguishable .",
    "here we have the same particle @xmath242 with only one decay width @xmath261 . in spite of that ,",
    "in principle we can distinguish @xmath258 from @xmath259 but in a much more sophisticated way .",
    "@xmath242 s in both states will decay in the same way ( mostly to @xmath262 but because two states @xmath263 have slightly different momenta ( in cm frame ) also the angular distribution ( e.g. for protons ) will be slightly different . as two states",
    "@xmath264 and @xmath259 are various mixtures of @xmath265 the angular distribution of the protons in cm frame which come from @xmath266 or from @xmath267 will be different .",
    "we can see that in principle both states ( 67 ) and ( 68 ) could be distinguished . but do we have anything which may be distinguished ?",
    "in other words , if we have flux of @xmath242 s produced with kaons in the reaction ( 63 ) , will their number in the state @xmath258 or @xmath259 change with distance from the reaction point ?",
    "for simplicity we will present the answer to this question in the plane wave language .",
    "we know that it is not precise , but the value of oscillation length obtained in this way is correct .",
    "the full wave packet approach , together with particle correlations ( the epr effect ) will be presented in the next section .",
    "let us assume that at @xmath268 @xmath242 s are produced in the pure state @xmath269 ( in the reaction ( 63 ) , the coefficients @xmath270 , but it is more transparent to leave them undefined ) .",
    "we will consider the production of @xmath242 s and the decay @xmath271 together .",
    "the amplitude for @xmath242 production and decay after a period of time t can be written in a form , where two indistinguishable ways of reaching the final state are added coherently [ 37 ] @xmath272 where @xmath273 are amplitudes for @xmath242 production in the states @xmath274 , @xmath275 are decay amplitudes from both states , @xmath276 and @xmath277 are mass and decay width of the @xmath242 . the different proper times which elapse in the @xmath278 s rest frames during the propagation are the crucial points in our discussion .",

    "if instead of @xmath242 we consider the production and decay of the initial kaon a similar formula would be obtained but with one , as we will see , crucial difference . as masses of @xmath282bosons are different , the oscillation factor is equal to @xmath283 .",
    "how to calculate the proper times ?",
    "they are measured in different lorentz frames , in the rest frames of @xmath284 and @xmath285 .",
    "the basic principle of quantum mechanics - the superposition principle tells , that we can add two states at the same time @xmath286 in the position representation we add wave functions @xmath287 in the same position @xmath116 and at the same time t. it means that the proper times are not suitable variables . we have to add wave function at the same point @xmath288 of the same lorentz system .",
    "it is necessary to transform @xmath289 and @xmath290 to the same common frame .",
    "the cm frame for the whole @xmath291 process is the most convenient in this place .    for convenience ,",
    "we consider only  the one dimensional ",
    ". then lorentz transformations between the rest frames for @xmath293 and the cm frame are given by    @xmath294    and    @xmath295 where @xmath296 at the beginning @xmath297 and two  ingredients  of the @xmath242 particle , @xmath284 and @xmath285 are created at @xmath298 and @xmath299 but particles in two states @xmath300and @xmath301have different speeds and after time t they are in different points in the cm frame ( see fig.3 ) .",
    "in classical mechanics , for point particles , it is impossible to have a situation that two particles which were born in the same point and at the same time but moving with different speeds would be still in the same , common points at the same time later ( fig.3 ) .",
    "accordingly to our previous statement ( eq.(73 ) ) such particles will not interfere for any time @xmath302 but in qm particles are described by wave packets ( in the limiting case - plane waves ) .",
    "we do not know at what place the particle was born inside the wave packet and what was the speed of it ( see fig.4 ) .",
    "it is not strange that different parts of two wave packets still interfere . inside wave packets , energy and momentum",
    "are distributed in agreement with qm prescriptions and it is not a surprise that they can be not conserved [ 32 ] .    as we remember , in the wave packet approach , to find the probability as a function of position it is not necessary to assume any relation between t and x. we simply integrate over t [ 36 ] .",
    "it is possible , however , to find such a relation between t and x that the oscillation length , which we obtain in this frame , will be ( to the first order ) the same as in a proper wave packet approach .",
    "such a frame was found [ 35 ] .",
    "it is the cm frame for @xmath303 and @xmath304 where their momenta are opposite @xmath305 @xmath306 ( see fig.4 ) .",
    "the velocity @xmath41 of the origin of @xmath307 center of mass frame in the laboratory system can be easily found from the relation @xmath308 so @xmath309 then the movement of the origin of the @xmath310 cm frame in our laboratory system is described by the obvious relation @xmath311 with @xmath41 given by eq.(76 ) .    using this classical relation eq.(77 ) , the proper times @xmath312and @xmath313from eq.(74 ) ) are given by @xmath314 and taking eqs .",
    "( 74 ) and ( 77 ) we have [ 35 ] @xmath315 = 0\\ ] ] and the oscillation length ( eq.(71 ) ) is infinitely large .",
    "if we calculate , in a analogous frame , the oscillation factor for kaons we obtain [ 35 ] @xmath316 @xmath119 which reproduces the well known result for the oscillation frequency ( eq.(6 ) ) @xmath317 the relations ( 79 ) and ( 80 ) which characterize the oscillation length are obtained in this special lorentz frame .",
    "in other frames , these results are correct only to first order in @xmath318 . instead of checking the dependence of the oscillation length on the lorentz frame , in the next section we will present the more complete wave packet approach .",
    "here we have found that the oscillation length of particles recoiling against mixed states is very large .",
    "it means that even if we consider the oscillation of such particles @xmath319 or @xmath320 separately , without connection to kaons or neutrinos it is impossible to observe such oscillations on any acceptable terrestrial distance .",
    "now we consider the oscillation of both particles @xmath319 and @xmath321 or @xmath322 and @xmath323 together .",
    "up to now we have considered the oscillation of one particle without taking into account possible correlations which may appear for two or more particles in the final states from which at least one oscillates in the traditional way .",
    "there are many such cases .",
    "some of them , with one oscillating particle , have been discussed above @xmath324 there are also interesting processes with two oscillating bosons e.g. @xmath325 or @xmath326    let us describe the last of them . at @xmath16 the state of two bosons is a combination of states with definite masses @xmath327 where @xmath328 and @xmath329 are elements of unitary matrix which describes the mixing .",
    "the momentum conservation in the production process gives altogether @xmath330 independent momenta for all @xmath331 pairs @xmath332 .",
    "sometimes there are additional correlations between various mass states @xmath333 and @xmath334 in eq.(82 ) .",
    "if , for example , the @xmath335pairs are produced by the @xmath336 decay then the state @xmath337 must be totally antisymmetric [ 38,39 ] ( since @xmath336 has intrinsic spin @xmath338 but b mesons are spinless , the b pair is in a p wave ) .",
    "the factors @xmath339 in eq.(71 ) are responsible for such correlations ( see for details ref.[36 ] ) .",
    "each state @xmath340 is described by a wave packet which in the momentum representation is given by @xmath341 where @xmath342 for simplicity is taken as the gauss function @xmath343 ^{3/2}}e^{-\\frac{% \\left ( \\stackrel{\\rightarrow } { p}-\\stackrel{\\rightarrow } { p}_a\\right ) ^2}{% \\scriptstyle 4\\sigma _ p^2}},\\ ] ] with @xmath86 - the average momentum and @xmath344 - the width of the distribution .",
    "after time t ( taking into account the particle decay ) the state @xmath345 will evolve into @xmath346 where @xmath347 is the lifetime of the @xmath348 particle in a chosen lorentz frame .",
    "the states @xmath349 in the position representation will be given by @xmath350 where @xmath351 is the fourier transform of the momentum distribution ( eq.(84 ) ) and is given by eq.(25 ) .",
    "let us assume that two detectors are placed at points @xmath352 and @xmath353 .",
    "the detectors will measure the particles with beauty  1  and  2  ( @xmath354 , respectively ) .",
    "the states of the b mesons measured by the two detectors are defined by @xmath355 and @xmath356 notations in eqs .",
    "( 87 ) and ( 88 ) are similar to previously presented in eq.(30 ) .",
    "we can find the amplitude for two oscillating particles in the same way as before ( chapter 3 ) .",
    "then the amplitude of the process where two particles @xmath357 and @xmath358 produced at @xmath16 at point @xmath359 are detected as particles with beauty  1  (  2  ) at point @xmath360 at @xmath361 , is the following @xmath362 @xmath119 with the normalization factor @xmath363 ^{1/2},\\ ] ] and the effective total widths @xmath364 the amplitude ( 89 ) can be used in various situations .",
    "if we apply the formula ( 89 ) to the description of the epr effect in the @xmath365 decay ( refs [ 38,39 ] ) , the collapse of the bb wave function is included in a natural way .",
    "our approach is an alternative to the amplitude description ( refs [ 38,39 ] ) and , in case of particle mixing , takes into account the epr correlations in a much more transparent way ( see ref.[36 ] for detail ) .",
    "the formula ( 89 ) can also be used for the @xmath366 pair  oscillation  from the @xmath367 decay . in this case only one particle , the neutrino , mixes .",
    "then , in the application of eq.(89 ) to our present purpose , we have to take one diagonal mixing matrix ( e.g. @xmath368 ) and @xmath369 .",
    "usually neutrinos are considered as stable or very long living particles .",
    "let us also assume that the  oscillation  of the muons is measured on a distance much shorter than their decay length",
    ". then both factors in eq.(89 ) , which are responsible for particle decay , may be neglected . in such circumstances , the probability that neutrinos produced as @xmath370 type together with muons at @xmath359",

    "first of all , we can see from eq.(92 ) that the muon oscillation disappears if we do not measure separately the neutrinos with flavour @xmath41 .",
    "in such case the probability given by amplitude ( 92 ) is constant in @xmath382 and @xmath383 and can be normalized @xmath384 but even if we measure the @xmath41-type neutrino , the muon oscillation will not be seen",
    ". we can prove this statement because we know precisely the muon oscillation length ( eq.(93 ) ) .",
    "if we denote the difference between the masses of two neutrinos a and b , as @xmath385 the inverse of the oscillation length may be decomposed in powers of @xmath386 .",
    "for muons , the term proportional to the first power of @xmath386 vanishes , and @xmath387 where @xmath388 is the factor in the decomposition @xmath389 while for neutrinos there is @xmath390 and we reconstruct the previous formula for mixing particle oscillation length eqs.(12 ) , ( 38 ) .    from eq.(98 )",
    "it follows that @xmath391 is very large and for the acceptable neutrino mass difference the muon oscillation length is much bigger than its decay length @xmath392 we can see that even if the neutrino and the muon are both measured , the oscillation of muon will not be observed",
    ". taking into account opinions presented in the latest exchange of views [ 31 - 35 ] we agree with the statement that , in practice , oscillations of @xmath322 or @xmath393particle are impossible to observe .",
    "let us briefly summarize the main results of this review paper    * ( i ) * many conceptual difficulties arise in the plane wave approach to the particle oscillation problem .",
    "this approach gives us the shortest way to get the correct expression for the oscillation length , but it fails if we try to describe other aspects of the particle oscillation .              - gives a possibility to understand in a simple way the phenomenon , that a precise measurement of the detected particles momenta may restore the coherence between various eigenmass states and , as a consequence , the oscillation between particles ,    - temporal and spatial distributions in the wave packet are correlated by the requirement , that particles are on mass shell .",
