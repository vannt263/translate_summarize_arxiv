    "<S> cefe@xmath0 is a geometrically frustrated ferromagnet that lies close to an instability at which a subtle change in the lattice symmetry couples to a transition to antiferromagnetism . </S>",

    "<S> comparison of phase transitions under both chemical substitution and applied pressure suggests a general solution to the physics of pyrochlore rare earth inter - metallic magnets .    in a geometrically frustrated magnet </S>",
    "<S> not all pairs of magnetic ions can simultaneously assume their lowest energy configuration , and the system often has to choose among a large number of competing configurations . </S>",
    "<S> from a conceptual standpoint , frustrated systems are interesting because ostensibly minor phenomena can play an outsized role in dictating the overall magnetic structure . </S>",
    "<S> cefe@xmath0 is a frustrated rare earth inter - metallic magnet with laves crystal symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> laves phase materials belong to a broader class of pyrochlore lattice systems , which attract much interest as canonical examples of geometrically frustrated magnetism in three dimensions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> many laves magnets of both ferro- and antiferromagnetic symmetry are known @xcite and , as we demonstrate here , the ease with which the magnetic symmetry can be switched is a direct result of geometrical frustration . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we quantitatively illustrate the effects of geometrical frustration on the generic magnetic phase diagram of cefe@xmath0 .    </S>",
    "<S> the cubic laves structure features transition metal ions on a pyrochlore lattice of corner - sharing tetrahedra woven through by corrugated planes of rare earth ions , as illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> stoichiometric cefe@xmath0 @xcite is ferromagnetic but undergoes a phase transition to an antiferromagnet under light chemical doping by for example al , co , ru or ir @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> previous studies on stoichiometric cefe@xmath0 have found evidence for a high pressure phase , which by comparison with the doped systems was posited to be antiferromagnetic @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> further support for this identification comes from the observation of antiferromagnetic fluctuations within the ferromagnetic phase @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we show in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] that the existing data for chemical doping and applied pressure can be collapsed onto a generic phase diagram , wherein both the ferromagnetic and the antiferromagnetic transition temperatures are plotted as a function of an effective tuning parameter @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , @xmath1 does not vary monotonically with the lattice constant , and the antiferromagnetic phase can be found for materials with lattice constants both larger and smaller than the parent compound cefe@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> this apparent insensitivity to the lattice constant is at variance with the conventional notion that chemical substitution influences magnetism by exerting a positive or a negative  chemical pressure \" , and suggests that the phase diagram is instead controlled by symmetry and the geometry of magnetic frustration .    . </S>",
    "<S> ( a ) layered view of cefe@xmath0 along @xmath2 . </S>",

    "<S> all four dopants would individually preserve the laves phase when fully replace fe in cefe@xmath0 @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> the peak splitting at high pressure is evidence of the rhombohedral distortion . at 1.8 gpa </S>",
    "<S> , the splitting of the ( 220 ) peak indicates phase coexistence , while the cubic ( 311 ) peak is indistinguishable from the rhombohedral ( 31@xmath7 ) peak within our measurement resolution . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig2 ] the response of the crystal lattice to applied pressure @xmath10 at low temperature . </S>",
    "<S> near @xmath11 gpa the lattice undergoes a transition in which it is compressed along one of the cubic body diagonals , resulting in a splitting of the cubic crystal into four types of rhombohedral domains . using high resolution x - ray diffraction it is possible to index diffraction peaks by their rhombohedral domain type . </S>",
    "<S> the compressibility @xmath12 is determined by fitting the lattice constant @xmath8(@xmath10 ) to a one parameter birch equation @xcite , with @xmath13 gpa and @xmath14 gpa in the low and high pressure phases respectively . in the high pressure phase the unit cell angle @xmath9 deviates from @xmath15 by @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> the data also show clear evidence for a regime of phase coexistence between 1.3 and 1.8 gpa . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of a structural phase transition and a regime of phase coexistence are consistent with magnetic susceptibility studies of cefe@xmath0 under pressure , which found the ferromagnetic phase boundary to be difficult to pin down at low temperature @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> note also that a similar rhombohedral distortion is known to accompany the ferromagnetic - to - antiferromagnetic phase transition in ru- , al- , and co - doped cefe@xmath0 , with @xmath9 in the range @xmath17 @xcite , further supporting the notion that the magnetic phase diagram is linked to symmetry considerations rather than controlled by effective chemical pressure or the effects of disorder .    </S>",
    "<S> using non - resonant magnetic x - ray diffraction we searched for and found the high pressure antiferromagnetic phase in the form of ( 1/2 , 1/2 , 1/2)-type bragg diffraction peaks associated with antiferromagnetic period doubling @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the longitudinal magnetic peak widths are limited by the instrument resolution ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3]a ) , meaning that the coherence length of the antiferromagnetic domains is at least 1500 @xmath18 . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig3]b antiferromagnetic reflections at nine positions in reciprocal space , all corresponding to a single rhombohedral domain at @xmath19 gpa and @xmath20 k. the nine positions yielded six measurable peaks and three null results , all of which can be used to constrain the magnetic structure . </S>",
    "<S> the orbital contributions to the magnetism in cefe@xmath0 are negligible compared to the spin contribution for both ce and fe @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the non - resonant magnetic diffraction cross section is thus dominated by the projection of the spin onto the direction ( @xmath21 ) perpendicular to the scattering plane . </S>",
    "<S> the measured quantity is the ratio of diffraction intensity from the antiferromagnetic and the lattice bragg peaks , expressed as @xmath22 here ( h , k , l ) are miller indices of the unit cell before antiferromagnetic period doubling . </S>",
    "<S> the summations in the numerator and denominator run over all scattering sites in the magnetic and lattice unit cells , respectively , and the factor of eight accounts for the difference in size between the magnetic and lattice unit cells . </S>",

    "<S> centered lattice the basis therefore increases from one to eight points , forming a bipartite lattice consisting of basis points 1 - 4 and 1-4 , with the condition that the primed and unprimed points be magnetically distinguishable . in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> bear in mind that the laves basis consists of six atomic sites ( four fe and two ce ) at each point of the bipartite lattice .    </S>",
    "<S> the antiferromagnetic structure proposed for ce(fe@xmath28co@xmath29)@xmath0 on the basis of neutron and resonant x - ray diffraction measurements @xcite , consists of ferromagnetic kagome sheets of 3e - fe spins ( each carrying 1.61 @xmath30b ) polarized along @xmath31 , with the spins inverted on adjacent sheets . </S>",
    "<S> the ce spins ( 0.13 @xmath30b ) are also parallel to @xmath31 and are ordered antiferromagnetically within each ( 111 ) plane . </S>",
    "<S> the 1b - fe spins ( 1.12 @xmath30b ) are polarized within the ( 111 ) plane . </S>",
    "<S> this can be understood as the result of frustration , arising from the ferromagnetic coupling of the 1b - fe spins to the two oppositely polarized neighboring kagome sheets . </S>",
    "<S> considering only the coupling of the 1b - fe spins with their ( ce and 3e - fe ) nearest neighbors , all orientations of the spins within the plane are degenerate . in the model of ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the sheets of 1b - fe spins are ferromagnetically polarized in the plane , so that the lattice sites 1 - 4 have identical spin orientations , which are opposite to the spins on sites 1-4. however , it is straightforward to show that any such model gives a magnetic structure factor of zero for all six of the observed reflections plotted in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> each sub - lattice point is associated with a complete laves basis , which is explicitly drawn on sub - lattice point 1 . </S>",
    "<S> the spin orientations on site 1 are the inverse of those on site 1 , and likewise for the other pairs . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) the 3e - fe spins on each kagome sheet are ferromagnetically aligned . </S>",
    "<S> ( c ) the 1b - fe spins form a plane of frustrated triangular plaquettes . the degeneracy associated with the choice of antiferromagnetic pairs leads to a magnetic domain structure ; only one domain is drawn here as an example . </S>",
    "<S> ( d ) monte carlo simulation of the generic magnetic phase diagram , which is controlled by competition between the antiferromagnetic ce - ce exchange interaction ( @xmath32 ) , and the ferromagnetic fe - fe interaction ( @xmath33 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the spin structure for cefe@xmath0 in both the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases is drawn for the 1b - fe site and its twelve nearest neighbors.,width=324 ]    the model proposed for ce(fe@xmath28co@xmath29)@xmath0 is therefore not directly transferrable to antiferromagnetic cefe@xmath0 under pressure . however , this model can conform to our data with one revision . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that the fe spins are not all co - linear is established @xcite , and the assumption that the 1b - fe spin is misaligned with the 3e - fe spins is consistent with the rhombohedral distortion . </S>",
    "<S> however , the interaction between 1b - fe spins and their orientation within the ( 111 ) plane have not been constrained . </S>",
    "<S> if this interaction is antiferromagnetic rather than ferromagnetic , then the triangular plaquettes of 1b - fe sites will be magnetically frustrated , the bipartite lattice sites 1 - 4 will not have identical spin orientations , and the observed reflections acquire non - zero structure factors .    as explained in detail in the supplemental material </S>",
    "<S> , this leads to a model ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] ) that is consistent with our data . </S>",
    "<S> the planes of 1b - fe sites consist of antiferromagnetically aligned pairs and two spin polarization axes separated by @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> there is degeneracy associated with the choice of pairs , giving rise to a magnetic domain structure . </S>",
    "<S> each domain contributes to some but not all of the reflections shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3]b and for simplicity we assume that the three domain types are equally populated . </S>",
    "<S> we further assume that the angle @xmath35 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4]c differs by @xmath36 between domains . </S>",
    "<S> the diffraction intensities calculated from this model are in decent quantitative agreement with our data ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3]b ) , including the three null results , and allow us to determine the 1b - fe moment to be @xmath37b . </S>",
    "<S> the agreement between model and measurements can be further improved by assuming unequal magnetic domain populations and/or by optimizing the angles @xmath35 and @xmath38 , but we feel such an analysis is unjustified within our limited data set .    </S>",
    "<S> we can now understand the phase diagram by considering the magnetic interactions . </S>",
    "<S> in both the high and low pressure phases , the ce spins are anti - aligned with the majority of the fe spins @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that an antiferromagnetic coupling ( with exchange energy @xmath39 ) between the ce and fe spins is the dominant magnetic interaction . </S>",
    "<S> this coupling may be expected to arise from the double exchange interaction between the localized fe moments and the itinerant ce electrons @xcite , and is known to exist in laves systems @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the bonds between fe nearest neighbors are ferromagnetic ( exchange energy @xmath33 ) . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the ce spins are antiferromagnetically aligned in the high pressure phase . the proximity of the magnetic phase transition in cefe@xmath0 to ambient pressure , and the insensitivity to the interatomic distances ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] ) , are strong indications that the magnetic interactions will not be _ qualitatively _ different on opposite sides of the transition . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore propose that the ce - ce interaction is always antiferromagnetic ( exchange energy @xmath32 ) , and that the shifting balance between the antiferromagnetism of the ce spins and the ferromagnetism of the fe spins drives the transition .    to test this proposal </S>",
    "<S> we construct a semiclassical model , taking into account only the nearest neighbor interactions @xmath39 , @xmath33 and @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> we numerically determine the phase diagram both within a mean field approximation and using a classical monte carlo simulation ( see supplementary material ) , assuming that the ce and 3e - fe spins will be aligned along @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting phase diagram is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4]d . </S>",
    "<S> even at this level of approximation , the theoretical model clearly reproduces the qualitative features of the experimental phase diagram .    the generic magnetic phase diagram in fig .  [ fig1 ] </S>",
    "<S> is now explained . the low temperature , ambient pressure phase of cefe@xmath0 is ferromagnetic , but it sits close to an antiferromagnetic instability and @xmath40 is close to the critical value . since al , co , ru and ir all replace fe upon being doped into cefe@xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> , they affect the fe - fe bonds more strongly than the ce - ce bonds . the dopants which end up on fe-1b sites decrease the energetic cost of the antiferromagnetic stacking of fe-3e layers and </S>",
    "<S> thus effectively increase @xmath41 . on the other hand , the application of pressure mainly affects the interatomic distances , and therefore affects both the ferromagnetic and the antiferromagnetic bonds . </S>",
    "<S> the latter is more sensitive to the changing overlap integrals due to the itinerant character of the ce electrons , thus shifting @xmath41 towards higher values under pressure . </S>",
    "<S> the horizontal scaling of various magnetic phase diagrams for chemical doping and applied pressure results from the fact that there is only a single parameter @xmath41 which controls the transition between the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases . </S>",
    "<S> by contrast , the thermal transition into the paramagnetic phase is controlled by @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> this strong ce - fe spin interaction is little affected by either pressure or doping , and the vertical axes of the different phase diagrams thus line up without any additional scaling .    </S>",
    "<S> the picture which emerges for cefe@xmath0 contains multiple magnetic energy scales which compete in a landscape of geometrical frustration , and the magnetic structure is determined by the balance between the weakest two interactions . </S>",
    "<S> this solution holds for both chemical substitution and applied pressure and may serve more generally for other geometrically frustrated pyrochlore magnets . </S>",
    "<S> the phase transition occurs when the effective interaction between kagome layers turns from ferromagnetic and mediated by the fe spins , to antiferromagnetic and mediated by the ce spins . in the ferromagnetic phase , </S>",
    "<S> the fe - fe interactions are satisfied and the ce - ce interactions are frustrated . </S>",
    "<S> the rhombohedral distortion tilts the playing field in favor of the ce - ce interactions by isolating the 1b - fe spins , with the result that in the antiferromagnetic phase the fe - fe interactions are partially frustrated while the ce - ce interactions are mostly satisfied . </S>",
    "<S> underpinning the whole phase diagram is the dominant antiferromagnetic ce - fe interaction , which depends on strong hybridization between the itinerant ce @xmath42 and the more localized fe @xmath43 orbitals .    </S>",
