    "entanglement is a fundamental notion of quantum mechanics , that has over the recent years gained popularity as a way to provide new insights in the quantum many - body problem . from the condensed matter point of view ,",
    "one of the most interesting promises of the study of entanglement properties is the possibility to automatically detect the nature of quantum phases and of quantum phase transitions . in this approach",
    ", there is no need to provide _ a priori _ physical information or input , such as the specification of an order parameter .",
    "the detection can occur through the study of the scaling ( with system size ) of various entanglement estimators .",
    "for instance , the scaling of the von neumann entanglement entropy for one - dimensional systems is different for critical and gapped systems - allowing their distinction . for a recent review of various properties of entanglement entropy in condenser matter ,",
    "see ref .  .",
    "to quantify the entanglement between two parts @xmath2 and @xmath3 of a quantum system described by a wave - function @xmath4 , one usually invokes the von neumann entanglement entropy ( vn ee ) defined as : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the reduced density matrix obtained by tracing out the degrees of freedom in @xmath3 . considering that @xmath2 is a connected region of space ( such as a block of sites in a lattice model ) , on general grounds",
    "one expects that @xmath7 scales not as the volume of @xmath2 , but rather as the interface between @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "this `` area law ''  @xcite is due to the fact that the value of @xmath7 is independent of whether degrees of freedom in @xmath2 or @xmath3 have been first traced out : @xmath8 and therefore the size dependence must come from the boundary between the two parts of the system .",
    "this general area law has been shown to be fulfilled for many physical wave - functions .",
    "however it is also known to be violated for several examples , where in most cases some type of long - range correlations develop between degrees of freedom in @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the most documented situation is the case of one - dimensional ( 1d ) quantum critical systems where several important results can be derived from conformal field theory ( cft ) . for 1d quantum critical wave - functions displaying conformal invariance ,",
    "it was shown  @xcite that @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the length of the block of sites @xmath2 . here",
    "@xmath11 is the central charge of the corresponding cft , and periodic boundary conditions are assumed .",
    "the 1d area law ( where @xmath7 saturates to a constant for large @xmath10 ) is fulfilled on the other hand as soon as the correlation length is finite .",
    "even though one expects the area law to be valid in most cases , the situation of corrections to the area law is still unclear in higher dimensions .",
    "cft predictions are valid only in a few isolated situations  @xcite .",
    "some exact results are available for a few specific models : for instance , the ground - state of free bosonic models fulfills strictly the area law  @xcite whereas free fermions can display multiplicative log corrections  @xcite . on the other hand , calculations for interacting models",
    "become rapidly untractable .",
    "numerical simulations are also not eased by the higher dimensionality .",
    "exact diagonalization techniques have access to ee , but they are limited to very small samples sizes which do not allow a test of the area law , and deviations thereof , in high dimension .",
    "ee comes for free within the dmrg method  @xcite , but it is limited to 1d and quasi-1d systems .",
    "stochastic methods , such as quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) , have no problem with simulations of systems in higher dimensions , but unfortunately the vn ee is a quantity that is extremely complex to measure within monte carlo methods ( see however recent progresses  @xcite ) .    alternatively , it is possible to define for certain quantum spin systems , a different quantifier of entanglement through the use of the valence bond ( vb ) representation .",
    "the key idea is that for two quantum spins 1/2 at sites @xmath12 and @xmath13 , the singlet state ( or vb ) @xmath14 is maximally entangled .",
    "it can therefore be used as a natural unit of entanglement ( in the quantum information community , the entanglement is often measured in units of singlets ) .",
    "consider now a vb state where an even number n of spins @xmath15 are coupled pairwise in singlets , and divide the spins in two arbitrary sets @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "it is simple to see that the von neumann entropy @xmath7 is equal to the number of vbs shared between @xmath2 and @xmath3 ( i.e. where one of the two spins is located in @xmath2 and the other in @xmath3 ) , times the constant @xmath16 .",
    "this constant is just the von neumann entropy of a single spin in a vb . in other words ,",
    "every singlet that crosses the boundary between @xmath2 and @xmath3 contributes @xmath16 to the von neumann entropy .",
    "the picture is very appealing as it provides a simple geometrical interpretation of entanglement , a quantity which is not always easy to grasp intuitively .",
    "this argument of course is only exact for the case of vb states , which are simple factorized states .",
    "however , it can be shown , and we will describe this in detail below , that the picture holds for all singlet states .",
    "this is an important property as most antiferromagnetic systems have a singlet finite size ground - state .    in general , the resulting valence bond entanglement entropy ( vb ee )",
    "@xcite is _ different _ from the von neumann entropy , except for the case of vb states where they coincide .",
    "there are however several points of interest for this alternative description : ( i ) it fulfills all desired properties of an entropy  @xcite , ( ii ) the vb ee can be easily computed through qmc methods in the vb basis  @xcite , offering the possibility to study @xmath17 systems , ( iii ) the scaling properties of the vb ee display several interesting features .",
    "concerning the scaling ( with system size ) of the vb ee , it has been shown first numerically and then analytically that for critical systems in 1d , the vb ee scales logarithmically with block size @xmath18 ( here and in the following the symbol @xmath19 denotes proportionality up to a constant ) . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath20 converges to a constant for gapped systems .",
    "the same scaling behavior is displayed by the vn ee .",
    "the only difference comes from the prefactor of the log divergence : while the numerical estimation of @xmath21 was first reported  @xcite to be consistent with @xmath22 ( as for vn ee ) , the analytical results of ref .",
    "indicate that the two quantities are different for heisenberg spin chains @xmath23 , even though the numerical value of @xmath24 is very close to @xmath25 ( @xmath26 for the heisenberg chain ) .",
    "we will comment on the numerical validation of the exact value @xmath27 at a later stage of this paper .    in two dimensions ,",
    "the situation seems slightly different . for gapped spins systems ,",
    "the vb ee was shown  @xcite to fulfill a strict area law @xmath28 ( with @xmath10 the linear size of the boundary between @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) .",
    "the same scaling is expected on general grounds for @xmath7 . in the case of the ground - state of the 2d heisenberg model displaying nel order with gapless excitations",
    ", the vb ee displays a multiplicative logarithmic correction to the area law  @xcite : @xmath29 .",
    "there is no equivalent calculation ( analytical or numerical ) for the vn ee of the 2d heisenberg model , for the reasons described above .",
    "however , recent dmrg calculations  @xcite on @xmath30-leg ladders and qmc computations of the renyi entropy of the 2d heisenberg model  @xcite , suggest that the vn ee displays no such multiplicative logarithmic and that the nel ground - state fulfills strictly an area law @xmath31 .",
    "this can be seen negatively as the scaling of the vb ee does not match the one of the vn ee , showing its limits to discuss the adherence of the vn ee to the area law in higher dimensions .",
    "one should note however that the vb ee is able to distinguish between a gapless and a gapful state through its scaling -whereas the vn ee cannot- , one of the main original and practical motivations of studying entanglement in condensed - matter systems . as a side remark",
    ", we also note that the vb ee can be used to characterize shared information in the different context of stationary states of stochastic models  @xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "we investigate the properties of the vb ee using a different approach.the original vb ee definition@xcite is intimately related to the fact it is possible to consistently define@xcite a vb occupation number able to quantify the presence / absence of a su(2 ) dimer on a given bond for any singlet state .",
    "note that the definition only depends on the chosen bipartition of the lattice into two subsets , in spite of the vb basis overcompleteness .",
    "we derive in sec .",
    "[ sec : def ] an alternative but equivalent definition of the vb occupation number which is free of any vb basis formulation .",
    "this allows to define the vb ee in the practical @xmath32 basis , and its computation through different numerical schemes ( such as exact diagonalization or dmrg ) than the vb qmc method used in previous works .",
    "being now able to compute the vb ee for frustrated systems , we study in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] both vn and vb ee for the @xmath33-@xmath34 spin chain , using dmrg techniques .",
    "we discuss and compare how the scaling of both entropies can detect the critical phase ( for small @xmath34 ) and the quantum critical point that separates it from the dimerized gapped phase present at large @xmath34 .",
    "we also discuss the importance of the marshall sign present in the ground - state wave function when comparing the two entropies .",

    "@xmath7 is plotted for the ground - state . ]",
    "[ fig : entropyed ] shows ed data for various entropies . in particular",
    ", since @xmath20 depends on the choice of bipartition , one may wonder what to choose .",
    "usually , one is guided by the ising solution : for small @xmath189 , it is natural to choose a @xmath94 bipartition , while for large @xmath189 , the system will behave as two decoupled heisenberg chains with twice as large lattice spacing , meaning that bipartition should be of the form @xmath190 the marshall sign for this @xmath186 partition is presented in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : marshall ] .",
    "of course , the intermediate region with maximal frustration has no preferred bipartition .",
    "moreover , since the ground - state oscillates between @xmath185 and @xmath90 , we plot both entropies . still , as can be seen from its definition eq .",
    "( [ eq : vbee_proj ] ) , @xmath20 is only defined when the overlap between the ground - state and the classical nel state is finite .",
    "unfortunately , the @xmath187 nel state has no projection in the singlet @xmath90 sector as it is invariant by a combination of lattice translation and spin reversal .",
    "however , for @xmath186 bipartition , we can compute @xmath20 for both lowest @xmath185 and @xmath90 states and it turns out that data are very similar ( sometimes they can not be distinguished on the scale of fig .",
    "[ fig : entropyed ] ) , although states are quite different ( see their marshall sign in fig .  [",
    "fig : marshall ] ) .    by comparing fig .",
    "[ fig : entropyed ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : marshall ] , we observe that when the marshall sign is too small , @xmath20 has absolutely no meaning ( and can even be negative ) . on the other hand , is @xmath180 is large enough , or said differently , if we choose the bipartition that maximizes @xmath180 , then @xmath20 behaves much better and follows the same trend as @xmath7 , that is both converge to a constant for large enough block size .",
    "in fact , for large @xmath189 where the marshall sign becomes again close to 1 for the @xmath186 choice , we observe that both entropies become more and more similar .",
    "in this paper , we studied the behavior of the valence bond entanglement entropy of the frustrated @xmath33-@xmath34 spin chain , and offered a direct comparison with the von neumann entropy .",
    "numerical dmrg calculations indicate that both entropies scale logarithmically with block size in the critical phase , and converge in the gapped dimerized phase of this model .",
    "the study of the vb ee has been made possible in this frustrated model through a formulation of valence bond occupation number , which extends this notion out of the valence bond basis .",
    "first , as based on the example of the @xmath33-@xmath34 model , the scaling of @xmath20 with the block size allows to differentiate critical from gapped phases in one dimension , similarly to @xmath7 .",
    "moreover , the knowledge of the exact prefactor  @xcite of the log scaling permits a relatively precise determination of the quantum critical point at @xmath135 with finite - size data ( this is however due to the vanishing of log corrections at this particular point , a non - generic feature ) .",
    "note that this knowledge can be useful as the scaling of @xmath20 might now be used to characterize uniquely the unknown phase of a new model .",
    "@xmath20 can be computed for the q - states potts model using the loop language of ref .   and there , the prefactor of the logarithmic scaling depends on q and is therefore indeed different for the different critical points encountered in the potts model .",
    "this is similar to the scaling of @xmath7 which allows the determination of the central charge - the knowledge of which entirely determines the cft at play for minimal models .",
    "it is possible to compute @xmath20 directly in the thermodynamic limit using the infinite - size algorithm idmrg  @xcite or itebd  @xcite . in this formulation ,",
    "the number of basis states in the calculation controls the spectrum transfer matrix of the system , which gives a scaling of the correlation length @xmath191 at criticality , where @xmath192 is a function of the central charge  @xcite .",
    "however , the effective boundary condition for the transfer matrix , and hence the form of the corrections to scaling of the entropies @xmath20 and @xmath7 , will be different to the case of periodic boundary conditions , and we leave this analysis for a future study .",
    "besides , knowing the corrections to scaling induced on a finite system by marginally irrelevant operators is interesting by itself ( see for instance ref .  ) .    in dimension",
    "higher than 1 , it was already demonstrated  @xcite that the scaling of @xmath20 discriminates between gapped and gapless phases . since numerical calculations are possible in @xmath17 with qmc vb methods  @xcite , it would be of high interest to perform a systematic study of the scaling of @xmath20 in different phases of quantum spin models .",
    "several questions are in order : for instance , do the multiplicative log corrections observed for the 2d heisenberg model have a physical interpretation ?",
    "are prefactors of the scaling of @xmath20 universal within a phase or at a quantum critical point  @xcite , as observed in 1d ?",
    "we note that the techniques described here for calculating the vb entanglement entropy can easily be applied to higher dimensional tensor network algorithms such as peps  @xcite where the necessary scalar products are similarly easily computed .",
    "this opens the door to studies of the vb entanglement entropy for frustrated 2d systems  @xcite .",
    "our study on frustrated systems also sheds lights on the importance of a good physical choice for the bipartition used in the definition of the vb ee , and its relation to the existence of a marshall sign rule ( or a large marshall sign ) in the wave - function under study . when the marshall sign is exactly or close to @xmath126 , the resulting choice of bipartition ( or equivalently reference state @xmath84 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : projection_mixed_normalized ] ) ) produces a valence bond entanglement entropy that closely follows the scaling of the von neumann entropy .",
    "this suggests another route to quantify entanglement in a wave - function through its projection over a well - chosen ( physical ) reference state .",
    "another interesting situation which we have not discussed in this work is the one of strongly disordered spin systems , where @xmath20 and @xmath7 coincide  @xcite ( after averaging over disorder ) .",
    "this is the case in the random singlet phase , where the low - energy physics is dominated by a single valence - bond state , as remarked in ref .   and more recently by tran and bonesteel  @xcite .",
    "as pointed out by these authors , the study of the _ fluctuations _ of the number of vbs crossing the boundary provide additional physical insights in this situation .    finally , we comment on the usefulness of the formulation eq .",
    "( [ eq : projection_mixed_normalized ] ) of the valence bond occupation number .",
    "it clearly points towards generalizations of @xmath20 for situations not explored before , for instance for spins higher than @xmath15 , as well as for systems which lack su(@xmath125 ) symmetry . in the latter case ,",
    "the direct interpretation in terms of @xmath131 vbs is not possible anymore and the physical meaning of @xmath51 has first to be clarified .",
    "it would be interesting for instance to look for the relation to q - deformed singlets  @xcite , which are used in ref .   to extend the vbee to potts models .",
