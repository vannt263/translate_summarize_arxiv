    "coronal and interplanetary type ii radio emissions are widely believed to result from the interaction of a fast shock with the coronal and/or the interplanetary medium ( wild 1950 , malitson et al .",
    "1973 , boischot et al . 1980 , nelson & melrose 1985 ) .",
    "the sequence of events is thought to be as follows : the shock accelerates a distribution of electrons to suprathermal ( @xmath0 kev ) energies ; the electron energy distribution is unstable to the production of langmuir waves ; the langmuir waves , in turn , are converted by means of nonlinear wave - wave interations to electromagnetic waves  plasma radiation  near the fundamental and/or harmonic of the local electron plasma frequency . in the case of coronal type ii radio bursts ,",
    "the nature of the shock driver remains controversial : flare blast waves ( uchida 1974 , wagner & macqueen 1983 ; cane & reames 1988 ; vrsnak et al .",
    "2006 ) , flare ejecta ( gopalswamy et al . 1997 ) , and cmes ( cliver et al . 1999 , 2004 )",
    "have all been considered .",
    "in contrast , it is generally accepted that shocks driven by fast cmes are responsible for ip type ii radio emission ( cane 1984 , 1985 ; see also the recent review by gopalswamy 2006 ) . regardless of the driver ,",
    "type ii radio emission has long been used as a tracer of shocks in the corona and the interplanetary medium . since plasma radiation",
    "is emitted at frequencies near the electron plasma frequency @xmath1 and/or @xmath2 , where @xmath3 khz , it provides a direct link between the observed radiation and the electron number density in the source . moreover",
    ", as the shock propagates through the coronal or interplanetary medium , the change in the frequency of the type ii emission with time jointly constrains the density gradient and the shock speed along its trajectory .",
    "observations of coronal and interplanetary type ii radio bursts have been important in connecting phenomena observed in the corona ( e.g. , flares and cmes ) to _ in situ _ measurements made near 1 au ( e.g. , leblanc et al . 2001 , reiner et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "cairns et al .",
    "( 2000 ) posed the question of whether multiple classes of interplanetary type ii radio events exist , drawing a distinction between  broadband , smooth events \" ( cane et al .",
    "1982 , lengyel - frey & stone 1989 ) and  narrowband , intermittent events \" ( e.g. , reiner et al . 1997 , 1998 ) .",
    "recently , cane & erickson ( 2005 ) presented a study of events observed by the space - based wind / waves experiment and ground - based spectrometers .",
    "based on a qualitative evaluation of 1 - 14 mhz spectra , they conclude that there are indeed multiple classes of type ii radio emission and classify them into three groups : 1 ) extensions of coronal type ii radio bursts from meter wavelengths into the 1 - 14 mhz frequency range ; ii )  blobs and bands \" ; iii )  ip type ii events \" .",
    "their classifications are non - exclusive  more than one class of type ii phenomenon can occur during a given event .",
    "drawing from a sample of 135 type ii burst events identified in the 1 - 14 mhz radio band from 20012003 , cane & erickson found that 70% displayed  blobs and bands \" and @xmath4 showed evidence for the presence of extensions of coronal type ii bursts .",
    "less than @xmath5 of the events showed the presence of an  ip type ii event \" .",
    "these events are therefore rare , occurring at a rate of approximate one per month during the years in question .",
    "on the other hand , gopalswamy ( 2006 ) has suggested a unified approach to understanding the type ii phenomenon .",
    "he emphasizes the hierarchical relationship between cme kinetic energy and the wavelength range and , hence , radial range over which type ii emission occurs , and notes the  universal \" relationship between type ii drift rates and their emission frequency ( vrsnak et al .",
    "2001 , aguilar - rodriguez et al .",
    "2005a ) , as well as a  universal \" value for the frequency bandwidth ratio @xmath6 ( aguilar - rodriguez et al 2005b ) .    in the present case",
    "study a type - ii - like event that was observed on 2003 june 17 - 18 is analyzed in detail .",
    "in fact , the event matches the definition of an  ip type ii event \" and its initial developments is used as an example by cane & erickson ( 2005 ; see their fig .",
    " ip type ii events \" are defined by cane & erickson as those that i ) start at a frequency @xmath7 mhz but extend to frequencies @xmath8 mhz ; ii ) have a duration @xmath9 hrs ; iii ) are broadband ( @xmath10 ) . on the basis of its observed properties , however ,",
    "i show that it is difficult to reconcile with existing ideas regarding coronal and ip type ii radio emission .",
    "in particular , i show that synchrotron radiation , rather than plasma radiation , may be the relevant emission mechanism .",
    "in other words , it may be necessary to distinguish between two , fundamentally different types of slow - drift radio emission in the interplanetary medium : the familiar _ ip type ii - p emission _ due to plasma radiation , and",
    "_ ip type ii - s emission _ due to synchrotron radiation .",
    "since synchrotron radiation involves the interaction of relativistic electrons with magnetic fields , the phenomenon raises a number of critical questions regarding electron acceleration and transport .",
    "it also offers a new diagnostic tool for probing the nature of fast cmes in the interplanetary medium ( ipm ) .",
    "the observations are presented in  2 ; problems with an interpretation of the data based on plasma radiation are pointed out in  3 ; a simple synchrotron model is presented in  4 .",
    "i briefly explore some of the implications of this idea in  5 .",
    "the radio event of interest occurred on 2003 june 17 - 18 , type - ii - like radio emission associated with a fast halo cme ( fig .  1 )",
    ", a soft - x - ray ( sxr ) flare of goes class m6.8 , and a solar proton event .",
    "the flare occurred in noaa active region number 10386 at a position e55 , s07 .",
    "the radio observations were made by the waves experiment ( bougeret et al .",
    "1995 ) on board the wind satellite , a spin - stabilized satellite that revolves once every 3 s about a spin axis that is orthogonal to the ecliptic .",
    "it has a complex orbit but is often near the l1 lagrangian point .",
    "the waves experiment employs three dipole antennas , one on the spin axis ( @xmath11 ) and two orthogonal dipoles in the spin plane ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "the observations discussed here were made by the rad1 and rad2 radio receivers .",
    "rad1 typically makes measurements at 32 frequencies , selected from 256 possible frequencies , distributed linearly from 20 - 1040 khz whereas rad2 makes measurements at 256 channels distributed linearly from 1.075 - 13.825 mhz .",
    "the data were downloaded from the wind / waves web site .",
    "the rad1 data discussed here use the @xmath13 dipole originally composed of two 50  m antenna segments , although in august 1998 , one segment is believed to have lost roughly 15  m in length ( m. kaiser , private communication ) .",
    "the rad2 data discussed here use the @xmath14 dipole composed of two 7.5  m antenna segments .",
    "the data have been averaged to a nominal time resolution of 1 min .",
    "the wind / waves data were flux calibrated using the known parameters of the dipole antennas and receivers , and daily background measurements . the calibration was applied to events that have been previously published as calibrated spectra ( e.g. , leblanc et al . 2000 ) and the results agreed well .",
    "the calibrated data were also cross - checked against a second method that references the measurements to the galactic background radiation , which dominates the receiver noise over most of the rad1 and rad2 frequency ranges ( dulk et al .",
    "the two methods are in agreement to better than 3  db for frequencies in the range 0.1 - 10 mhz , the frequencies that concern us here .",
    "as will be shown , the type - ii - like radio event analyzed here is quite faint .",
    "the typical background levels are @xmath15 and @xmath16 sfu in rad1 and rad2 , respectively .",
    "it is therefore important to subtract the background from the spectra prior to analysis . for the purposes of display and analysis , it is convenient to interpolate the calibrated , background - subtracted spectra from rad1 and rad2 onto a single grid that displays the logarithm of the calibrated flux density as a function of time ( linear abscissa ) and the frequency ( logarithmic ordinate ) .",
    "the observations are summarized in fig .  2 .",
    "the lower panel shows the wind / waves dynamic spectrum over a frequency range of 100 khz to 13.825 mhz and a time range of 500 min , starting at 21:40 ut on 2003 june 17 .",
    "the log - flux is clipped at 1000 sfu to better show the radio emission of interest in the presence of other intense emissions .",
    "the upper panel shows the goes 1 - 8  sxr light curve to illustrate the relative timing between the radio emissions and the associated sxr flare . the cme height - time measurements from soho / lasco ( brueckner et al .",
    "1995 ) were obtained from the nasa cdaw data center online cme catalog .",
    "the cme shows little sign of acceleration or deceleration to an apparent height of nearly 30 r@xmath17 ; a linear fit to the data ( dotted line ) yields an apparent speed of 1820 km s@xmath18 .",
    "the mass and kinetic energy of the cme , also drawn from the online catalog , are @xmath19 gm and @xmath20 ergs , respectively , although these estimates are rather uncertain .",
    "since the cme height observations are projected onto the sky plane , the measured cme speed represents a projected speed . assuming the cme propagates radially from the position of the associated flare , and can be characterized by a hemispherical front and an opening angle @xmath21 , an approximate correction factor can be derived ( leblanc et al .",
    "2001 ; see also sheeley et al .",
    "if the projected speed is @xmath22 it should be multiplied by @xmath23 to produce an estimate of the de - projected cme speed @xmath24 .",
    "the parameter @xmath25 is the angular distance of the associated active region from sun center and @xmath26 is the half - width of the opening angle of the cme .",
    "inspection of fig .",
    "1 suggests @xmath27 is appropriate , yielding a deprojected speed @xmath28 km s@xmath18 , although the correction factor is not very sensitive to @xmath26 .",
    "cyr et al .",
    "( 2000 ) observed a mean value of @xmath29 , which would yield an estimated speed of 2050 km s@xmath18 in the present case .",
    "the dynamic spectrum shows intense , fast - drift ip type iii radio bursts during the rise phase of the sxr flare , with a peak flux density of @xmath30 sfu ( 1 sfu = @xmath31 w m@xmath32 hz@xmath18 ) .",
    "beginning at a time nearly coincident with the sxr maximum ( 22:55 ut ) , a faint , slow - drift radio event is seen , first detected at a frequency of @xmath33 mhz .",
    "the diamond symbol in the upper panel of fig .  2 represents the projected radius of the cme ( @xmath34 r@xmath17 ) at the estimated time of the onset of the radio event . during the course of more than 3 hrs",
    ", the emission drifts to lower frequencies and eventually becomes lost in the confusion of brighter emissions at a frequency of @xmath35 khz at 01:30 - 02:30 ut on 2003 june 18 , when the cme was @xmath36 r@xmath17 from the sun .",
    "compared with the ip type iii bursts , the ip type ii - s event is very faint , with a peak flux density of only @xmath37 sfu .",
    "the emission varies smoothly and shows neither substructure nor any sign of additional components that are harmonically related to the dominant lane of emission .",
    "the variation of peak flux with time is characterized by a rapid rise to a broad maximum at @xmath38 ut , followed by a monotonic decline to just a few sfu .",
    "if @xmath39 is the frequency of the flux maximum at a time @xmath40 and @xmath41 is the fwhm bandwidth of the spectrum at that time , the bandwidth frequency ratio is @xmath42 . for reasons that will become apparent below",
    ", we refer to the slow - drift radio burst as an _ ip type ii - s _ event .",
    "it is interesting to note the presence of a second type of emission beginning at approximately 02:30 ut on 2003 june 18 although it may begin with a faint fragment as early as 01:30 ut ( upper band ) . here ,",
    "two lanes of emission are present .",
    "they are harmonically related and vary irregularly with time .",
    "the frequency bandwidth of each lane is @xmath43 .",
    "the two lanes drift slowly to lower frequencies with time .",
    "the emission in this case is identified as an _ ip type ii - p _ event .",
    "note that while cane & erickson ( 2005 ) cite the june 17 - 18 event as an `` ip type ii '' event they show only the first 60 minutes of the rad  2 dynamic spectrum .",
    "the rad  1 spectrum shows type ii - s emission extending down almost to 200 khz , followed by the type ii - p emission .",
    "cane & erickson would have presumably classified the type ii - p emission as `` blobs and bands '' .",
    "the emission identified here as an ip type ii - s event differs in significant ways , both qualitatively and quantitatively , from most coronal type ii bursts and their interplanetary extensions and analogs .",
    "while it matches the definition of an  ip type ii event \" , as defined by cane & erickson ( 2005 ) , the classification of ip type ii - like emissions requires further refinement . in the case of the type ii - s event , it is difficult to reconcile the properties of the radio emission with the assumption that plasma radiation is the relevant emission mechanism .",
    "the frequency bandwidth ratio of the type ii - s event is significantly larger than that typically observed for coronal and ip type ii emissions ( @xmath44 ; e.g. , aguilar - rodriguez et al . 2005 ) , but is consistent with that of  ip type ii events \" although cane & erickson did not analyze their sample quantitatively .",
    "lengyel - frey & stone ( 1989 ) noted the large bandwidths of certain ip type ii radio emission ( denoted  class b \" events by the authors ) observed by the radio experiment on the isee-3 spacecraft .",
    "aguilar - rodriguez et al . argue that the large bandwidths inferred for isee-3 type ii events may reflect a selection bias resulting from the frequencies sampled by the isee-3 experiment but nevertheless find ( rare ) events with frequency bandwidth ratios ranging from 0.5 - 0.8 .",
    "lengyel - frey et al . (",
    "1989 ) suggested that large bandwidths can be understood in terms of density inhomogeneities in the source .",
    "if the density inhomogeneities are given by @xmath45 , the bandwidth of the resulting plasma radiation should be @xmath46 .",
    "a problem with this idea is that the magnitude of plasma density fluctuations @xmath45 is typically quite small in the solar wind .",
    "woo et al .",
    "( 1995 ) used dual - frequency ranging from _ ulysses _ to show that @xmath45 varied from 1% to no more than 20% over periods of 20 min to 5 hrs ( see also celnikier 1987 ) . to account for",
    "the observed frequency bandwidth ratio on june 17 - 18 would require @xmath47 , much larger than is typically observed .",
    "it is therefore hard to see how a localized region could instantaneously produce broadband plasma radiation through random density inhomogeneities .",
    "if the source is very large the shock could encounter many discrete densities at any given time ; but then it is difficult to understand why the distribution of emission is continous and smooth over the entire radial range that the event is observed .",
    "more recently , knock & cairns ( 2003 , 2005 ) have quantitatively explored sources of spectral structure in coronal and ip type ii bursts in the context of the plasma radiation model .",
    "knock & cairns ( 2005 ) consider the case of a shock expanding laterally in the quiescent corona and show that broadband emission can be produced , the two harmonics even merging in some cases .",
    "it is questionable whether such a model applies to the event considered here , however . by its very nature , a lateral shock in the corona will not propagate significantly in the radial direction and therefore does not propagate significantly into the interplanetary medium .",
    "knock & cairns point out that the frequency drift rate resulting from lateral shock expansion would be much less than that resulting from a radially propagating shock .",
    "as shown below , the type ii - s event discussed here shows a frequency drift that is significantly _",
    "faster _ than can be accounted for by plasma radiation driven by a radially propagating shock .",
    "indeed , a defining property of coronal and ip type ii radio emission is the drift of the characteristic frequency from higher to lower values with time . the frequency and drift rate of type ii radio emission",
    "are easily measured and , in the context of plasma radiation , can be interpreted in a straightforward manner .",
    "the measured frequency is assumed to be a measure of the electron plasma frequency @xmath48 and the drift rate is therefore assumed to be @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the speed of the source parallel to the density gradient .",
    "the most common interpretation of ip type ii radio emission is that it occurs in the foreshock region of the fast cme ( see cairns et al .",
    "2000 for a summary of the data and arguments in support of this conclusion ) .",
    "the density in the source is therefore assumed to be the relatively undisturbed corona and/or interplanetary medium .",
    "analysis of coronal and ip type ii radio emissions typically involves fitting the time evolution of the spectrum to a shock speed and trajectory , and a density model .",
    "semi - empirical models based on white light ( e.g. , newkirk 1967 ; saito 1970 ; saito et al . 1977 ) or radio data ( fainberg & stone 1971 ; bird et al . 1994 ; leblanc et al .",
    "1998 ) are employed , although the model is often renormalized by a constant scaling factor ( e.g. , reiner et al .",
    "2003 ) . adopting a given density model , the source speed",
    "can then be inferred ( e.g. , kaiser et al .",
    "1998 ) from the frequency drift of the type ii emission .",
    "with the availability of high quality white light coronagrams from soho / lasco over wide range of coronal heights in recent years , the projected speed of the shock driver  the cme  is known .",
    "recent work has used radio and white light observations jointly to constrain shock dynamics ( reiner et al . 2003 ) .",
    "reiner et al . (",
    "1998 ) point out that the density varies with radius nearly as @xmath51 beyond a few solar radii , so the plasma frequency and hence , the observed radio frequency , should vary as @xmath52 , an expectation that is often borne out .    in the present case ,",
    "the projected speed of the cme is well - measured ; the start time and start frequency of the type ii - s event are also well - constrained .",
    "hence the initial radius @xmath53 , corrected for projection , and the electron number density @xmath54 are presumed known if the source is associated with the cme shock and plasma radiation is the relevant emission mechanism . to be concrete ,",
    "the density is assumed to vary with radius according to the model of saito et al .",
    "( 1977 ) although other density models yield similar results .",
    "starting at @xmath55 the cme is assumed to propagate from @xmath53 radially outward with either a projected speed of 1820 km s@xmath18 ( case 1 ) or a de - projected speed of 2010 km s@xmath18 ( case 2 ) , driving a shock which produces plasma radiation .",
    "3a shows the expected drift rate for the saito density model overlaid on the dynamic spectrum for case 1 ( dash - dot ) and case 2 ( dashed ) . in order to match the initial condition ,",
    "the saito model must be multiplied by a factors of @xmath56 and 10 for cases 1 and 2 , respectively , assuming fundamental plasma radiation .",
    "these normalization values should be divided by 4 if harmonic plasma radiation is assumed .",
    "regardless , the time variation of plasma radiation fails to match that of the type ii - s event .",
    "indeed , in order to approximately match the frequency drift , the electron density must vary as @xmath57 ( case 1 ) or @xmath58 ( case 2 ) , and to account for the initial condition the source must be overdense relative to saito at @xmath53 by factors of 13 and 6.5 , respectively ( fundamental emission ) . to account for the type ii - s event in terms of a plasma radiation model",
    "therefore requires rather unusual conditions in the inner heliosphere : the electron number density must be overdense relative to the saito et al ( 1997 ) model , yet decline with radius as @xmath59 out to @xmath60 r@xmath17 rather than rapidly tending toward the expected @xmath51 dependence .",
    "in contrast to the type ii - s event , the emission identified as type ii - p in fig .",
    "2 and described in  2 , is entirely consistent with plasma radiation : it shows both fundamental and harmonic bands , the bands have narrow frequency bandwidth ratios , the intensity varies irregularly with time , and the emission drifts slowly to lower frequencies with time .",
    "the flux density of the fundamental band is @xmath61 sfu while the harmonic emission is considerably weaker , a property that has been noted previously for ip type ii harmonic pairs ( lengyel - frey et al .",
    "1985 ; lengyel - frey & stone 1989 ) .",
    "the frequency drift of the type ii - p emission is also consistent with plasma radiation : it can be described by plasma radiation from a saito density model , with no renormalization needed , if the shock launches at the same time as the cme , but propagates at @xmath62 km s@xmath18 .",
    "this might occur if the shock front responsible for the type ii - p emission propagates at an angle @xmath63 from the radial , as would be the case if the source is near the flank of the cme rather than the nose .    to summarize , the fast halo cme of 2003 june 17 produced a type - ii - like radio event , referred to here as an ip type ii - s event , that is characterized by a smoothly varying , relatively broadband , single lane of emission .",
    "the large bandwidth and the smooth variation of the radio emission with time are difficult to understand in the context of plasma radiation .",
    "if plasma radiation is nevertheless the relevant emission mechanism , then rather special conditions in the ipm would be required to account for the variation of radio frequency with time ; namely , a density model that is initially overdense relative to the model of saito et al .",
    "( 1977 ) , declines with radius significantly more steeply than a saito model out to at least 30 r@xmath17 , and must contain extreme and rather uniform density variations over the full radial range to account for the large bandwidth .",
    "in contrast , the emission referred to here as ip type ii - p is entirely consistent with plasma radiation from a shock propagating through a saito et al density model , but only if the shock is associated with a shock near the flank of the fast cme .",
    "in this section an alternative to plasma radiation from an ip shock driven by a fast cme is considered : incoherent synchrotron radiation .",
    "synchrotron radiation is emitted by energetic electrons gyrating in an ambient magnetic field .",
    "it is a well - understood mechanism that is believed to play a central role in a wide variety of astrophysical phenomena , including solar flares ( e.g. , bastian et al .",
    "1998 ) , supernova remnants ( e.g. , reynolds & chevalier 1981 ) , and extragalactic radio sources ( e.g. , begelman et al . 1984 ) .",
    "the observed spectrum of sychrotron radiation depends on the magnetic field , the electron distribution function , the ambient plasma in the source , and the medium external to the source .",
    "the frequency bandwidth ratio of a self - absorbed synchrotron emission spectrum is @xmath10 but it can be smaller . the low - frequency spectrum can cutoff steeply if razin suppression and/or thermal free - free absorption are operative ; the high frequency spectrum can cutoff if the electron energy distribution has a high energy cutoff ( see , e.g. , ramaty 1969 , ramaty & petrosian 1972 , klein 1987 ) .    as noted previously ,",
    "the frequency drift with time from high to low values is a defining characteristic of type ii radio emission .",
    "can synchrotron emission produce a frequency change in time similar to that observed ?",
    "consider a power - law distribution of electrons with a number density @xmath64 .",
    "the spectral maximum of the emission spectrum then occurs at a frequency @xmath65 ( dulk 1985 ) , where @xmath66 is the magnetic field .",
    "it is clear that if @xmath67 and/or @xmath66 decrease in the source with time , then so does @xmath68 .",
    "for example , if @xmath67 and @xmath66 both vary as @xmath69 , then so does @xmath68 .",
    "i present a more quantitative comparison below .",
    "another question : is the flux density of the source commensurate with the proposed emission mechanism ?",
    "a limit to the brightness temperature @xmath70 of a self - absorbed synchrotron source is imposed by inverse compton scattering , constraining it to be no more than @xmath71 k ( kellermann & pauliny - toth 1969 ) . observations of certain coronal type ii radio bursts yield brightness temperatures well in excess of this limit ( nelson & melrose and references therein ) , thereby eliminating synchrotron radiation as the relevant emission mechanisms on these grounds alone .",
    "the flux density of the type ii - s source is related to its brightness temperature by @xmath72 where @xmath73 is boltzmann s constant and @xmath74 is the solid angle subtended by the source .",
    "while wind / waves measured the flux density of the type ii - s event , no direct information is available on its angular size .",
    "however , if it is assumed that the source is comparable in size to the projected size of the cme itself , a maximum brightness temperature can be inferred and compared to the inverse compton limit .",
    "the ip type ii - s event had a maximum flux density of @xmath75 sfu at about 23:10 ut , when the projected height of the cme was @xmath76 r@xmath17 and the frequency is @xmath77 mhz . taking the solid angle subtended by the source to be @xmath78 , where @xmath79 au , @xmath80 k , well below the compton limit .",
    "therefore , the possibility that synchrotron emission is relevant to type ii - s events is not excluded on the basis of the observed flux and the inferred brightness temperature .    to pursue the idea further ,",
    "a simple model was developed as a means of illustrating that type ii - s bursts can be ascribed to synchrotron radiation from near - relativistic electrons .",
    "it is not intended to explain the familiar type ii - p emissions for which the plasma radiation mechanism is assumed to be relevant .",
    "i assume that , just as is the case for ip type ii - p emission , type ii - s radio events are causally related to fast halo cmes . in other words , i assume that the type ii - s source region is closely associated with the fast cme . as the cme and the associated type ii - s source",
    "increase their distance from the sun , the source size , magnetic field , plasma density , and number of energetic electrons are all assumed to vary . for illustrative puposes , the ingredients of the schematic model refer to the event of 2003 june 17 and are as follows :    1 .",
    "_ source speed _ : the source is assumed to move radially outward from the sun at a constant speed @xmath24 .",
    "_ source size _ : the type ii - s source size @xmath81 is assumed to increase linearly with time @xmath40 so that the solid angle subtended by the source increases approximately as @xmath82 .",
    "specifically , i take @xmath83 , where @xmath53 is the initial source size at @xmath84 when the type ii - s event begins",
    ". the angular size of the source is computed as @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is the source area and @xmath87 is 1 au .",

    "aspect angle _ : implicit in the expression for the source size is the assumption that the source is viewed approximately  head - on \" , as appropriate to a halo cme ( although the bulk of the june 17 - 18 event in fact propagated to the east ) .",
    "it is further assumed that the magnetic field is oriented @xmath89 to the line of sight for the purposes of this illustrative calculation .",
    "plasma density _ : the unperturbed solar wind plasma density is assumed to vary according to a saito et al . ( 1977 ) model .",
    "it is found that the best results were obtained when the source volume was _ underdense _ relative to saito et al .",
    "( see below ) .",

    "_ energetic electrons _ :",
    "the electron distribution is assumed to be power - law in energy , isotropic in pitch - angle , and to fill the source uniformly : @xmath91 , where @xmath92 embodies the radial variation in the number density of energetic electrons .",
    "furthermore , the distribution is characterized by a low - energy cutoff of @xmath93 , to which the emission spectrum is insensitive , and a high energy cutoff @xmath94 , to which the emission spectrum is somewhat sensitive .",

    "finally , it is assumed that @xmath92 increases linearly with time from 0.001% to a few times 0.1% of the ambient plasma density until roughly 02:00 ut .",
    "a computer program has been written that embodies these assumptions , a modified version of the code described by bastian et al .",
    "briefly , the source radius is computed once each minute according to the assumed speed of the cme and the corresponding values of the magnetic field , ambient plasma density , energetic electron density , source area , and source depth are derived . the source flux density",
    "is then computed at a given frequency using    @xmath99\\ ] ]    where @xmath100 is the index of refraction , @xmath101 is the total emissivity due to the free - free and synchrotron mechanisms , @xmath102 is the total absorption coefficient , @xmath103 is the solid angle subtended by the source , and @xmath87 is the distance from the observer to the source ( 1 au ) . in the case",
    "considered here thermal free - free absorption is negligible for the parameters chosen .",
    "the expressions for @xmath104 and @xmath105 for the case of mildly relativistic electrons are quite cumbersome ( ramaty 1969 , benka & holman 1992 ) and their evaluation is computationally demanding .",
    "they were instead calculated using using the approximate expressions of klein ( 1987 ) , which are accurate to better than 10% over the range of conditions considered .",
    "model spectra were computed using calculaions at 100 frequencies distributed logarithmically between 0.1 - 13.825 mhz and displayed as a dynamic spectrum identical in format to that shown in fig .  1 .",
    "the results are shown in figs .",
    "3b and 3c .",
    "two cases were considered . in the first case ,",
    "the source was assumed to propagate out from the sun with a speed @xmath106 km s@xmath18 , the apparent speed on the sky ( case 1 ) .",
    "a good fit to the data is obtained when @xmath107 g and @xmath108 .",
    "however , it was necessary to assume that the ambient density was underdense relative to a saito model by a factor of 4 . in the second case",
    ", it was assumed that the source propagated out from the sun with a speed @xmath28 km s@xmath18 , the deprojected speed ( case 2 ) . in this case , a good fit to the data was obtained when @xmath109 g and @xmath110 , and an ambient density that is underdense relative to a saito model by a factor of 3 .",
    "the reason the ambient density must be underdense relative to a saito model is that razin suppression would otherwise cut off the emission at a higher frequency than is observed .",
    "the run of magnetic field in the source from 3 - 30 r@xmath17 is roughly 0.5 to 0.01 g in both cases .",
    "it is interesting to note that bastian et al .",
    "( 2001 ) fit a magnetic field strength of 0.33 g at a radius of 2.8 r@xmath17 in the case of the fast cme observed on 1998 april 20 .    fig .",
    "3b shows the model dynamic spectrum for case 1 ; the case 2 spectrum is nearly indistinguishable from case 1 visually .",
    "3c again reproduces the wind / waves dynamic spectrum .",
    "this time , the plots overlaid on the type ii - s event show the variation of the peak frequency @xmath68 of the model synchrotron spectrum as a function of time .",
    "they follow the observed variation in frequency with time rather well in both cases",
    ". however , the peak flux density of the models falls short of that measured by a factor of a few . a straightforward modification would be to simply increase the diameter of the source .",
    "alternatively , or in addition , the details of the electron distribution function , the time variation of the number of energetic electrons , and the magnetic field could be  fine tuned \" , an exercise i do not pursue here .",
    "additional examples of the ip type ii - s phenomenon will be analyzed and modeled in a forthcoming publication .",
    "it is important to emphasize that type ii - s events potentially offer important new diagnostics of physical conditions in the source , leveraging information about the magnetic field , the plasma density , and the distribution of energetic electrons in the source . with the launch of stereo",
    "/ waves , important new observations of these sources are possible such as more precise constraints on the location and size of the source .",
    "the stereoscopic observations provided by stereo may also provide constraints on the directionality of the emission , which can be significant for plasma radiation , but is not expected to be a factor for synchrotron radiation as long as the electron distribution function is nearly isotropic .",
    "observations of an ip type - ii - like radio event that occurred on 2003 june 17 - 18 in association with a fast halo cme , a strong sxr flare , and a solar proton event have been presented .",
    "it is difficult to account for the observed properties of the event in terms of plasma radiation .",
    "indeed , the properties of this ip type ii - s event can be adequately accounted for in terms of synchrotron emission from a source associated with the fast cme .",
    "in contrast , the emission referred to here as type ii - p remains fully consistent with plasma radiation from the shock if it is associated with the flank of the cme .",
    "therefore , it may be necessary to distinguish between slow - drift radio bursts that can be attributed to plasma radiation ( ip type ii - p ) and those that can be attributed to synchrotron radiation ( ip type ii - s ) .",
    "since the ip type ii - s event shares many attributes with cane & erickson s  ip type ii events \" , and  ip type ii events \" are relatively rare , ip type ii - s events are presumably rarer still , since it remains to be seen what fraction of cane & erickson s  ip type ii events \" can be attributed to synchrotron radiation .",
    "future attempts to classify ip type ii or type - ii - like phenomena will need to distinguish between the underlying radiation mechanisms .",
    "it is worth asking , at this point , whether the designation `` type ii - s '' is the best descriptor of the event analyzed here .",
    "is it possible that the observations are better described as the interplanetary analog to a `` moving type iv burst '' , or type ivm ?",
    "type ivm radio bursts are a rare coronal phenomenon that , despite decades of observations , remain poorly understood ( stewart 1985 and references therein ) .",
    "they have been attributed to both plasma radiation and/or synchrotron radiation .",
    "they have been classified ( smerd & dulk 1971 ) as isolated sources , expanding arches , and advancing fronts ( kai 1970 ) .",
    "the range of speeds inferred for type ivm sources is quite similar to that of cmes , ranging from 200 - 1600 km s@xmath18 .",
    "the `` advancing front '' type ivm has been attributed to a shock that produces a coronal type ii radio followed synchrotron radiation beyond 2r@xmath17",
    ". it may be that the `` advancing front '' type ivm is analogous to the june 17 - 18 event analyzed here .",
    "only one example of type ivm has been reported in the wind rad1 and rad2 band ( reiner et al .",
    "2006 ) , a broadband , highly circularly polarized source that showed a slow frequency drift from 2 mhz to 0.8 mhz over a period of four days .",
    "the spectrum is strikingly different from the present case . given the persistent uncertainties in interpreting type ivm bursts and the fact that both kaiser s online catalog and cane & erickson classify the event of 2003 june 17 - 18 as a `` type ii '' , i retain the terminology type ii - s as a meaningful descriptor .",
    "while it now appears that ip type - ii - like emissions may involve two distinct emission mechanisms , both the type ii - p and type ii - s emission remain closely associated with fast cmes .",
    "* where is the source region of the type ii - s relative to the fast cme ?",
    "* what is the source of the energetic electrons that emit the synchrotron radiation and how are they transported throughout the source ?",
    "* what are the relevant electron acceleration and loss mechanisms ?",
    "while these questions are left open here , i nevertheless comment briefly on each .",
    "regarding the location of the type ii - s relative to the cme , it is widely assumed that the source region of type ii - p events is in the foreshock region of a shock driven by an interplanetary cme ( cairns et al .",
    "i consider the foreshock region as an unlikely source region for type ii - s events for the simple reason that the undisturbed solar wind magnetic field in the foreshock region will be significantly weaker than in the postshock region ( manchester et al .",
    "since the synchrotron emissivity @xmath104 depends on the magnetic field roughly as @xmath111 a given population of energetic electrons will emit far more strongly in the postshock region than in the foreshock region if they are present there .",
    "therefore , one possible source region is the sheath between the cme and the shock it drives .",
    "the fact that the best model fit resulted from an ambient density that is underdense relative to saito et al .",
    "( 1997 ) by a factor of 3 may present difficulties in this case because both the density and the magnetic field are expected to be enhanced in the sheath .",
    "in addition , the electrons responsible for the synchrotron emission may escape rather easily from the sheath region .    a second possibility is the cme flux rope , or magnetic cloud ( burlaga et al 1981 ) .",
    "it is interesting to compare the inferred magnetic field variation in the source with that inferred on observational and theoretical grounds .",
    "a study of a large sample of interplanetary cmes ( icmes ) by wang et al .",
    "( 2005 ) suggests that @xmath112 on the other hand , for self - similar flux rope models ( gibson & low 1998 ) , @xmath113 .",
    "these values neatly bracket those inferred from the synchrotron model .",
    "if the source region is associated with the cme flux rope , it might be regarded as analogous to the fast cme on 1998 april 20 described by bastian et al ( 2001 ) , which displayed synchrotron radiation from mev electrons entrained in the cme magnetic loops , albeit at much higher frequencies ( 164 - 432 mhz ) than those considered here , observed to a height of @xmath114 r@xmath17 .",
    "if the source electrons reside in the flux rope , the fact that the source is underdense may not be a problem .    while the source of the energetic electrons responsible for the synchrotron emission is unknown ,",
    "as are the acceleration and transport processes , the fact that such electrons occur in association with fast cmes and large solar flares is well established ( see the recent review by kahler 2007 , and references therein ) .",
    "the energy requirements of the type ii - s event in the context of synchrotron radiation from near - relativistic electrons does not appear to present difficulties from an observational perspective .",
    "mewaldt et al .",
    "( 2005 ) analyzed the energy contained in energetic protons , helium , and electrons associated with the 2003 oct - nov events and conclude that accelerated ip particles amount to 0.4% to as much as 24% of the energy of the associated cme and that from 1% to 18% of the particle energy is contained in electrons .",
    "one possibility for the source of the electrons is the high mach number shock driven by the cme ( mann et al . 1999 , 2002 )",
    ". if the source of the type ii - s event is in the sheath region , then shock - accelerated electrons have ready access and may therefore be relevant .",
    "however , if the source region is in the flux rope , it is less clear that shock acceleration is relevant because it is not known how shock - accelerated electrons could then gain access to the flux rope .",
    "alternatives to the cme - driven shock include electron acceleration in the flare ( e.g. , simnett et al .",
    "2005 , 2006 ) , in the current sheet following the cme ( e.g. , cliver et al .",
    "1986 ) , and/or sustained electron acceleration and release in the solar corona ( klein et al .",
    "2001 , 2005 ) .",
    "the presumption in these cases is that energetic electrons are fed into the expanding icme for an extended period of time , replenishing those electrons that lose their energy to adiabatic losses ( synchrotron cooling is unimportant ) .",
    "the question of whether these are viable alternatives or not is beyond the scope of this paper .    to conclude , the ip type ii - s event may represent a new class of interplanetary radio phenomenon . just as is the case for conventional ip type ii - p events , the type ii - s event is closely associated with a fast cme .",
    "however , unlike ip type ii - p events , the type ii - s is interpreted as synchrotron emission from relativistic electrons interacting with a magnetic field .",
    "such electrons are far more energetic than those responsible for plasma radiation .",
    "the precise location of the type ii - s emission is presently unknown .",
    "i have suggested the post - shock sheath region or the flux rope as possible source locations .",
    "the source of the relativistic electrons is also unknown ; i have suggested the fast cme - driven shock , the flare , cme current sheet , or other energy release processes in the solar corona as possible sources . to refine the nature of ip type ii - s events , to understand their relation to other coronal and ip bursts , and to answer fundamental questions raised above ,",
    "requires the identification and analysis of many more events",
    ". a more comprehensive study of additional events observed by wind / waves will be forthcoming .",
    "the recently launched stereo / waves experiment should provide important new data , including constraints on the source size and direction ."
