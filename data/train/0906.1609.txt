    "indirect photon signals including monochromatic photon line , fragmentation photon spectrum and final state radiation photon spectrum in the ihdm is under current study @xcite .",

    "the ihdm is a simple extension of the sm which provides a very promising wimp dark matter candidate .",
    "there are several regions of the parameter space that could provide the right amount of dark matter relic density in the universe .",
