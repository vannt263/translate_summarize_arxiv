    "the discovery of the current accelerated expansion of the universe @xcite has prompted a renewed interest towards classic cosmological tests .",
    "the measurement of the expansion rate of the universe at different redshifts is crucial to investigate the cause of the accelerated expansion , and to discriminate candidate models . until now",
    ", a number of cosmological tools have been successfully used to probe the expansion and the geometry of the universe .",
    "the position of acoustic peaks in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) angular power spectrum provides a powerful geometrical test , showing that the space curvature of the friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) metric is nearly flat @xcite .",
    "a similar test is performed through the detection of baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) in the power spectrum of matter extracted from galaxy catalogues .",
    "the luminosity distance of type ia supernovae and other standard candles allows to constrain the value of the expansion rate at different redshifts , typically up to @xmath1 @xcite .    currently , however , very little is known about the detailed dynamics of the expansion . depending on the underlying cosmological model ,",
    "one expects the redshift of any given object to exhibit a specific variation in time .",
    "an interesting issue , then , is to study whether the observation of this variation , performed over a given time interval , could provide useful information on the physical mechanism responsible for the acceleration , and be able to constrain specific models .",
    "this is the main goal of this paper .",
    "in addition to being a direct probe of the dynamics of the expansion , the method has the advantage of not relying on a determination of the absolute luminosity of the observed source , but only on the identification of stable spectral lines , thus reducing the uncertainties from systematic or evolutionary effects .",
    "the possible application of this kind of observation as a cosmological tool was first pointed out by @xcite .",
    "however , the tininess of the expected variation ( typically , a shift of less than a cm / s over a period of a year ) was deemed impossible to observe at the time . the importance of this test was stressed again over the past decades by other authors ( e.g.  @xcite , @xcite ) ; more recently , @xcite re - assessed its feasibility and concluded that , given the advancement in technology occurred over the last forty years , it is conceivable to expect that a measurement of the redshift variation in the spectra of some suitable source ( most notably the lyman-@xmath0 absorption lines of distant qsos ) could be detected in the not too distant future . recently , @xcite showed that measuring the time evolution of redshift would be a way to check the internal consistency of the underlying cosmological model , and to map the equation of state of dark energy .    with the foreseen development of extremely large observatories , such as the european elt , with diameters in the range 30 - 100 m , and the availability of ultra - stable , high - resolution spectrographs , the perspectives for the observation of redshift variations look very promising .",
    "for example , @xcite pointed out that the codex ( cosmic dynamics experiment ) spectrograph should have the right accuracy to detect the expected signal by monitoring the shift of lyman-@xmath0 lines of distant ( @xmath2 ) qsos over a period of some decades .",
    "a previous investigation of the expected cosmological constraints from this kind of observations was performed by @xcite . that work , however , only made predictions for a very restrictive set of models and assumptions : firstly , it only explored the case when the dark energy is a standard cosmological constant ( i.e.  a component with constant equation of state @xmath3 ) plus a few non - standard models ( the chaplygin gas , and a model that , although named interacting dark energy , in fact only generalises a constant dark matter equation of state , leaving the cosmological constant untouched ) ; secondly , as it will be shown in more detail later , the observational strategy considered in that paper seems rather optimistic .    in this paper , we aim to give an overview of the theoretical predictions for the most popular and still viable models introduced in the recent past to explain the observed accelerated expansion .",
    "these models either fall within the broad category of `` dark energy '' , introducing an unknown , smooth and gravitationally repulsive component , or invoke a modification of the theory of gravity ( for a review of possible explanation for the accelerated expansion see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "our first goal is to investigate whether the dynamics of any of these standard and non - standard dark energy models shows interesting features that could be constrained by future observations of the redshift variation .",
    "we do not restrict ourselves _ a priori _ to models with flat geometry , and we fully take into account correlations between parameters when assessing the expected uncertainties .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in sect .",
    "2 we review the basic equations that describe the redshift variation with time of a source , in an expanding universe .",
    "we comment on the possibility of detecting the effect in the near future in sect .",
    "3 . in sect .",
    "4 we study the expected apparent velocity shift for a number of non - standard dark energy models . finally , we discuss the main results and conclusions of our work in sect . 5 and 6 .",
    "we start by reviewing the basic theory necessary to derive the expected redshift variation in a given cosmological model .",
    "we assume that the metric of the universe is described by the frw metric .",
    "the observed redshift of a given source , which emitted its light at a time @xmath4 , is , today ( i.e. at time @xmath5 ) , @xmath6 and it becomes , after a time interval @xmath7 ( @xmath8 for the source ) @xmath9 the observed redshift variation of the source is , then , @xmath10 which can be re - expressed , after an expansion at first order in @xmath11 , as : @xmath12 clearly , the observable @xmath13 is directly related to a change in the expansion rate during the evolution of the universe , i.e.  to its acceleration or deceleration , and it is then a direct probe of the dynamics of the expansion .",
    "it vanishes if the universe is coasting during a given time interval ( i.e.  neither accelerating nor decelerating ) .",
    "we can rewrite the last expression in terms of the hubble parameter @xmath14 : @xmath15 the function @xmath16 contains all the details of the cosmological model under investigation .",
    "finally , the redshift variation can also be expressed in terms of an apparent velocity shift of the source , @xmath17 .",
    "the latest studies on the feasibility of detecting a time evolution of the redshift are those by @xcite .",
    "the most promising approach is to look at the spectra of lyman-@xmath0 forest absorption lines , which are very stable and basically immune from peculiar motions .",
    "this is a scenario that might be achieved in the next decades , when extremely large telescope ( such as the elt ) will collect a large number of photons , and high - resolution spectrographs ( such as codex ) will be able to measure tiny shifts in spectral lines over a reasonable amount of time , typically of order of few decades .    according to monte carlo simulations discussed by @xcite",
    ", the accuracy of the spectroscopic velocity shift measurements expected by codex can be modelled as : @xmath18 here , @xmath19 is the signal to noise ratio for pixels of 0.0125  , @xmath20 is the number of qsos spectra observed and @xmath21 is their redshift .",
    "based on the currently known qsos brighter than @xmath22 in the redshift range @xmath23 , @xcite assumed to observe either 40 qsos with @xmath19 ratio of 2000 each , or 30 qsos with @xmath19 of 3000 , respectively .",
    "in fact , again according to @xcite , a codex - like experiment , coupled to a 60 m telescope with approximately 20@xmath24 total efficiency , would give a cumulative @xmath19 of 12000 for a single qso , requiring roughly 125 hours of observation to get a @xmath19 of 3000 on that spectrum .",
    "then , starting with 10 hours of observation per night , and taking into account a 20@xmath24 use of the telescope , and a @xmath25 of actually usable data , one finds that 40 spectra can be measured with that @xmath19 in roughly 7.6 years ( this time would actually increase to about 15 years if the telescope aperture is smaller , e.g. , 42 m instead of 60 m ) .",
    "then , it seems that a reasonable time span to perform a second observation of the same spectra might be 30 years .",
    "based on the previous considerations , our study will then be conducted assuming a future dataset containing a total of 40 qsos spectra ( uniformly distributed over 5 equally spaced redshift bins in the redshift range 2 - 5 ) , with a @xmath26 , observed twice over a time interval of 30 years .",
    "we note that a previous study performed by @xcite seems to make optimistic claims , i.e. that 240 pairs qso s spectra can be observed with @xmath26 over a time span of 10 years .",
    "it is easily shown ( with the same arguments as above ) that with these figures the required observing time would actually be roughly 90 years for each of the two epochs . moreover , even assuming an increase of the number of qsos in the redshift range 2 - 4 with future large all - sky photometric surveys , it seems quite difficult to predict an order of magnitude increase over the current known objects , which are 25 @xcite .    using the expected error bars from eq .",
    "[ forecast ] , we can predict the level of accuracy that can be reached in the reconstruction of the parameters for a comprehensive set of dark energy models . furthermore , we can predict whether any of these models can be distinguished from the standard @xmath27cdm scenario .",
    "we will now look into these problems .",
    "all of the models we will consider in this paper are currently viable candidates to explain the observed acceleration , i.e.  they have not been falsified by available tests of the background cosmology .",
    "clearly , some models may be preferred with respect to others based on some statistical assessment of their `` economy '' , i.e.  the fact that they fit the data well with a smaller number of parameters .",
    "given the current status of cosmological observations , there is no strong reason to go beyond the simple , standard cosmological model with zero curvature and a cosmological constant @xmath27 ( except for the conceptual problems arising when one attempts to reconcile its observed value with some estimate derived from fundamental arguments , see , e.g. , @xcite ) . for the scope of the present paper , however , it is interesting to explore as many models as possible , since future observations of the time variation of redshift could reach a level of accuracy which could allow to better discriminate competing candidates , and to understand the physical mechanism driving the expansion .",
    "we refer the interested reader to the paper by @xcite , which discusses the constraints on most of the models that we will focus on in our study . unless stated otherwise , throughout our paper we assume for each class of models the best fit values found in that work , and vary the parameters within their 2@xmath28 uncertainties .",
    "all the predictions on the time evolution of redshift presented in the following were derived assuming observations performed over a time interval @xmath29 years . from eq .",
    "[ deltaz ] it is clear that the expected velocity shift signal increases linearly with @xmath7 , so that it is straightforward to calculate the expected signal when a different period of observation is assumed . fig .",
    "[ fig : all ] shows our predictions for the cosmological models discussed in the following , along with simulated data points and error bars derived from eq .",
    "[ forecast ] .",
    "we start our analysis by first setting out the predictions for the current standard cosmological model . in the simplest scenario ,",
    "the dark energy is simply a cosmological constant , @xmath27 , i.e.  a component with constant equation of state @xmath3 .",
    "flatness of the frw metric is usually assumed , but in general one can parametrize the deviation from the zero - curvature case in terms of the parameter @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the total density of the universe in units of the critical value @xmath32 .",
    "the hubble parameter evolves according to the friedmann equation , which , for this model , is : @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 parameterize the density of matter and cosmological constant , respectively . when flatness is assumed , @xmath36 , and the model has only one free parameter , @xmath35 .",
    "the current best fit value from cosmological observations is @xmath37 in the flat case @xcite , while relaxing the assumption of flatness results in a preference for slightly closed models , with @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "the next step is to allow for deviations from the simple @xmath39 case , introducing a component with an arbitrary , constant value for the equation of state .",
    "the accelerated expansion is obtained when @xmath40 .",
    "the hubble parameter for this generic dark energy component with density @xmath41 then becomes : @xmath42 the currently preferred values of @xmath43 in this models still include the cosmological constant case : @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "if the equation of state of dark energy is allowed to vary with time , then the hubble parameter is : @xmath45 in this case , one has to choose a suitable functional form for @xmath46 , which in general involves a parametrization .",
    "the most commonly used @xcite is : @xmath47 although different approaches can be used .",
    "clearly , the exact form of @xmath46 with time will lead to completely different evolution for the dark energy component .",
    "in interacting dark energy models the dark components interact through an energy exchange term .",
    "the conservation equations for matter and dark energy can be written in a very general way as @xmath48 so that the total energy - momentum tensor is conserved .",
    "whenever @xmath49 is a non - zero function of the scale factor , the interaction causes @xmath50 and @xmath51 to deviate from the standard scaling , and the mass of the particles is not conserved .",
    "this non - standard behaviour has been parametrized @xcite by the relation @xmath52 , where @xmath53 and the density parameters are the present quantities .",
    "the hubble parameter or this model then reads @xmath54 which reduces to the uncoupled case for @xmath55 .",
    "this model also includes all late - time scaling solutions .",
    "we also note that this model is a genuinely interacting dark energy , unlike the one discussed in @xcite which is actually a generalised dark matter ( thus more similar to the model we discuss in [ affine ] ) .",
    "the dvali - gabadadze - porrati ( dgp ) model @xcite provides a mechanism for accelerated expansion which is alternative to the common repulsive - gravity fluid approach : within the context of brane - world scenarios , the leaking of gravity in the bulk , above a certain cosmologically relevant physical scale , is responsible for the increase in the expansion rate with time . the only parameter of this class of models is @xmath56 , the length at which the leaking occurs , which defines an adimensional parameter @xmath57 .",
    "the hubble parameter then reads : @xmath58 where @xmath59 .",
    "another possibility originating from the brane - world scenario is that of a so - called cardassian expansion @xcite resulting from a modification of the friedmann equation , with the introduction of a term that depends non linearly on the average density of the universe , assumed to be composed only of matter .",
    "this additional term , phenomenologically , is equivalent to the introduction of a dark energy component , with a scaling law @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is completely equivalent to the quantity @xmath62 of the dark energy models with constant equation of state .",
    "more interesting are the so - called `` modified polytropic cardassian '' models , which have an extra parameter @xmath63 and a friedmann equation :    @xmath64      there are a few models which attempts to explain both structure formation and the current acceleration of the universe with a single `` dark fluid '' , whereas the standard scenario relies on two separate dark contributions to the stress - energy tensor ( a dark matter and a dark energy component ) .",
    "a well - studied case is the so called chaplygin gas @xcite , where the unified dark component has equation of state @xmath65 with @xmath66 .",
    "the expansion rate in this model is governed by the equation : @xmath67    with the definition @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the total density of the universe at the present .",
    "the so - called `` standard case '' for the chaplygin gas is obtained for the choice @xmath70 ( which , however , is not a good fit to current data ) , while for @xmath71 the model recovers the standard cosmological constant case with @xmath72 .      an interesting possibility to consider",
    "is that the dark energy is modelled by a generic , barotropic equation of state @xmath73 , as discussed in @xcite . in particular ,",
    "the case where the taylor expansion of an arbitrary equation of state of that sort is truncated to first order , e.g.  @xmath74 , has recently been investigated by @xcite , who also derived cosmological constraints on the parameters of the model .",
    "it is interesting to note that such an affine equation of state can be used to describe a simple unified dark matter model , with a time evolution of the background density given by @xmath75 , where @xmath76 and @xmath69 is the dark energy fluid energy density at present .",
    "the hubble parameter is given by : @xmath77 where @xmath78 ; for @xmath79 this model recovers the standard @xmath27cdm case .",
    "we used the expected error bars from eq .",
    "[ forecast ] to perform a fisher matrix analysis @xcite , leading to an estimate of the best possible constraints on the parameters of dark energy models .",
    "all our predictions are based on 30 years of observation , assuming that the fiducial values for the parameters of each dark energy model are those which best fit current observations ( as from @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .    the fisher matrix formalism allows one to estimate the best possible accuracy attainable on the determination of the parameters of a certain model .",
    "specifically , given a set of cosmological parameters @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and the corresponding fisher matrix @xmath82 ( that is easily calculated based on a theoretical fiducial model and the assumed data errors from eq . [ forecast ] ) , the best possible @xmath83 error on @xmath80 is given by @xmath84 , where the covariance matrix @xmath85 is simply the inverse fisher matrix : @xmath86 .",
    "it is a well - known fact ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) that , when estimating the expected errors @xmath87 on each parameters , one has to be careful about existing correlations with the other parameters . during the inversion process ,",
    "non - null off - diagonal fisher matrix elements propagate in the diagonal elements of the covariance matrix , giving their contribution to the estimated uncertainties . neglecting this contribution , for example by simply taking the inverse of the elements of the fisher matrix ( a process which is equivalent to assume perfect knowledge of all the other parameters ) usually results in severely underestimated errors .",
    "the existence of correlations among estimated parameters is a manifestation of degeneracies : when more and more parameters are allowed to vary , and they have similar effects on the observable quantities , it becomes increasingly difficult to constrain each parameter .    from the above considerations , two crucial consequences arise : first",
    ", dark energy models with intrinsically less free parameters will have an advantage with respect to models with more free parameters ; second , not taking properly into account the degeneracies among parameters ( for example , by assuming perfect knowledge on some of them ) will lead to wrong estimates of the errors .",
    "for this reason , we allowed all the parameters which are specific of a given dark energy model to vary simultaneously in our analysis ( i.e. we inverted the full fisher matrix when estimating errors ) .",
    "however , since it would be pointless not to assume _ any _ prior knowledge , we fixed the parameters not directly related to dark energy ( such as , for example , the baryon density ) to their current best fit value .    as an example of what we just discussed ,",
    "let us consider first the standard @xmath27cdm case .",
    "assuming that the fiducial model has @xmath88 and @xmath89 and that both @xmath35 and @xmath90 can vary , we find @xmath91 and @xmath92 at 1@xmath28 .",
    "when we fix @xmath89 , the bound on @xmath35 becomes 0.007 ( at 1@xmath28 ) .",
    "if dark energy is modelled by a constant equation of state ( with a fiducial value @xmath39 ) and the flatness constraint is imposed we find a looser bound on the dark energy density , @xmath93 , and quite a large error on the equation of state , @xmath94 .",
    "this clearly shows that different assumptions on the knowledge of any parameter has an influence on all the others .",
    "having noted this , however , we also note that the parameter @xmath90 can be much better constrained using external datasets , such as the cmb anisotropy .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , then , we will assume flatness in the following .",
    "the prospect of detecting departures from the standard @xmath27cdm case could in principle be one of the real assets of observing the time evolution of redshift , and is thus worth closer investigation .",
    "since the simulated data used in our analysis assume that qsos are used as a tracer of the redshift evolution , we expect that the more constrained models will be those that have the largest variability in the redshift range @xmath95 .",
    "of course , additional information could be obtained using other observational windows .",
    "we will comment on this issue later on .",
    "the dgp model is the one for which we obtained the tightest constraints in our analysis : @xmath96 at 1@xmath28 , assuming @xmath97 as a fiducial value .",
    "this is not only due to the strong dependence of the velocity shift on @xmath98 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : all ] ) , but also to the simplicity of the model , which depends on only one parameter ( in this respect ,",
    "this is the simplest model , together with the standard flat @xmath27cdm ) .",
    "in general , as we already discussed , it is to be expected that models with less parameters perform better .",
    "the issue of degeneracies is crucial when looking into the behaviour of models having more than one free parameters .",
    "we start by discussing the chaplygin model .",
    "when both @xmath99 and @xmath100 vary freely , no interesting constraint can be obtained observing the velocity shift with the assumed qso data : we find @xmath101 and @xmath102 ( for the fiducial values @xmath103 and @xmath104 ) .",
    "fixing @xmath99 , on the contrary , results in a very tight bound on @xmath100 : @xmath105 .",
    "we then address the interacting dark energy and the affine equation of state . as it is clear from fig .",
    "[ fig : all ] these models show a large variability in the redshift range we are exploring : this is to be expected , since in both models the matter - like component departs from the usual @xmath106 scaling , giving a distinctive signature when one looks at higher and higher redshifts .",
    "we could then naively expect tight bounds on the parameters of these models from the observation of velocity shift .",
    "unfortunately , again , this is not the case , due to strong degeneracies among the parameters .",
    "for example , when @xmath35 is allowed to vary , for the affine equation of state we find @xmath107 ( for a fiducial value @xmath108 ) .",
    "however , if we suppose that one of the parameters is known from other observations , the constraints on the others narrow considerably .",
    "if @xmath35 is known , the affine parameter @xmath0 can be reconstructed with an error @xmath109 .",
    "if , in addition , we also know that @xmath39 we find @xmath110 for the interacting dark energy model ( for a fiducial value @xmath111 ) .",
    "the other models do not seem to have very interesting signatures to be exploited , at least in the redshift range considered in our analysis .",
    "the worst bounds are expected for the cardassian models , which has not a large parameter dependence in the redshift range @xmath112 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : all ] ) . in the case of a varying equation of state ,",
    "the simple parameterization adopted in our study shows significant deviations from the fiducial model only when rather extreme values of @xmath113 ( already excluded by current observations ) are assumed .",
    "however , alternative parametrizations might lead to different scalings , and dark energy might dominate in the redshift window probed by lyman-@xmath0 forests .",
    "models with this behaviour can in principle exist ( see , for example , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . a recent review on the dynamics of dark energy models is @xcite .",
    "a different aspect that we dealt with in our study was the potential of this cosmological tool to increase the ability to discriminate different models , when combined to other observations .",
    "[ fig : data ] shows the comparison among the predicted velocity shifts for all the models described earlier , assuming parameter values that are a good fit to current cosmological observations ( including the peak position of the cmb anisotropy spectrum , the sne ia luminosity distance , and the baryon acoustic oscillations in the matter power spectrum ) . in other words , the models shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : data ] can not be easily discriminated using current cosmological tests of the background expansion .",
    "if we assume that the @xmath27cdm model is the correct one , and simulate the corresponding data points for the velocity shift , using a @xmath114 test we can quantify how well we can exclude the competing models based on their expected signal . as it is clear from fig .",
    "[ fig : data ] , some models can be excluded with a high confidence level . in particular , we find that the chaplygin gas model and the interacting dark energy model would be excluded at more than @xmath115 confidence level , and that the affine model would be out of the 1 @xmath28 region .    as a final caveat ,",
    "we note that our results were obtained assuming an equal number ( 8) of qsos for each of 5 redshift bins in the range @xmath11625 .",
    "( such a uniform distribution was also assumed in the simulations performed by @xcite . )",
    "this explains the fact that our error bars significantly decrease with redshift ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : all ] ) . assuming a decreasing number of qsos at higher redshifts (",
    "undoubtedly , a somewhat more realistic assumption ) would result in a slight increase in the error bars for those bins .",
    "for example , assuming 3 qsos instead of 8 in the highest redshift bin would increase the error bar for that bin of a factor 1.6 .",
    "however , since the largest variability in theoretical predictions is precisely at high redhisfts , we would not expect our main conclusions to change dramatically .",
    "in summary , we found that the measurement of the velocity shift with future extremely large telescopes and high - resolution spectrographs could provide interesting information on the source of cosmic acceleration , which would complement other , more traditional cosmological tools . from our analysis , it is also clear that the observation of velocity shift alone can be affected by strong parameter degeneracies , limiting its ability to constrain cosmological models .",
    "contrarily to other analyses , then , our conclusion is that the uncertainties on parameter reconstruction ( particularly for non - standard dark energy models with many parameters ) can be rather large unless strong external priors are assumed .",
    "when combined with external inputs , however , the time evolution of redshift could discriminate among otherwise indistinguishable models .",
    "we also found that a reasonable time span to perform the comparison on the redshift evolution seems to be roughly three decades .",
    "shorter time spans seem unrealistic , given the time needed to observe qsos spectra with the necessary @xmath19 .",
    "a shorter interval would also make the redshift difference too small to produce any interesting constraint on cosmological parameters .    despite its inherent difficulties ,",
    "the method has many interesting advantages .",
    "one is that it is a direct probe of the dynamics of the expansion , while other tools ( e.g. those based on the luminosity distance ) are essentially geometrical in nature .",
    "this could shed some light on the physical mechanism driving the acceleration .",
    "for example , even if the accuracy of future measurements will turn out to be insufficient to discriminate among specific models , this test would be still valuable as a tool to support the accelerated expansion in an independent way , or to check the dynamical behaviour of the expansion expected in general relativity compared to alternative scenarios . furthermore , despite being observationally challenging , the method is conceptually extremely simple .",
    "for example , it does not rely on the calibration of standard candles ( as it is the case of type ia sne ) or on a standard ruler which originates from the growth of perturbations ( such as the acoustic scale for the cmb ) or on effects that depend on the clustering of matter ( except on scales where peculiar accelerations start to play a significant role ) . moreover , the errors on the measured data points decrease linearly with time and can become significantly smaller over only a few decades of observations .",
    "finally , it is at least conceivable that suitable sources at lower redshifts than those considered in this work could be used to monitor the velocity shift in the future .",
    "this would be extremely valuable , since some non - standard models have a stronger parameter dependence at low and intermediate redshifts ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : all ] ) , that could be exploited as a discriminating tool . in @xcite",
    "speculative possibilities of using other sources have been indicated , like masers in galactic nuclei , extragalactic pulsars or gravitationally lensed galaxy surveys : this would further extend the lever arm in redshift space and increase the ability of constraining models .",
    "exploring the feasibility of such proposals is beyond the scope of this paper , but it may certainly be an interesting topic for further studies from observers .",
