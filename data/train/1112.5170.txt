    "two main physical processes characterize the nuclear regions of active galaxies : intense star formation at rates of @xmath010@xmath210@xmath3 m@xmath4  yr@xmath5 ( starburst , sb ) and accretion on to a supermassive black hole ( active galactic nucleus , agn ) .",
    "the issue of sb and agn connection in both local and distant galaxies is critical for a proper understanding of galaxy formation and evolution , of star formation history and metal enrichment of the universe , and of the origin of the extragalactic background at low and high energies .",
    "there is indeed increasing evidence of a strong link between the starburst and agn mechanisms in active systems .",
    "the empirical correlation between the mass of black holes ( bhs ) located at the centre of nearby galaxies ( both active and passive / quiescent ) and the mass of their spheroids ( see sani et al .  2011 [ 1 ] and references therein ) suggests that the formation of bulges and the growth of the central bhs are tightly connected .",

    "2010 [ 5 ] ) hints at the relation between the two phenomena .",
    "the overall conclusion of these studies is that in 3050% of the cases the accreting supermassive bhs are associated with young ( i.e. of age less than a few @xmath6100 myr ) star - forming regions , with clear evidence of an enhanced star formation rate ( reaching up to starburst intensities ) in most agn .",
    "however , this does not necessarily imply any causal connection between the two physical processes .",
    "it could be simply the natural consequence of massive gas fuelling into the nuclear regions , due to either interactions / mergers or secular evolution such as bar - driven inflows .",
    "both star formation and nuclear accretion , in fact , are triggered and subsequently fed by this gas reservoir .",
    "+ in the local universe , the optimal targets to study the agn / sb interplay are the so - called ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ; sanders & mirabel 1996 [ 6 ] ) .",
    "these sources are the result of major mergers , during which the redistribution of the gaseous component drives vigorous starburst events and obscured nuclear accretion .",
    "it is now well established that ulirgs are usually powered by a combination of both processes , giving rise to their huge luminosities ( @xmath7 ) . however , since the primary radiation field is reprocessed by dust , the identification of the dominant energy supply is often unclear .",
    "the simultaneous presence of star formation and agn signatures in the mid - ir makes this a really favourable band to disentangle the agn and sb components and explore their environment .",
    "in particular , ( _ i _ ) the available spectra of _ bona fide _ starburst - dominated and , respectively , unobscured agn - dominated sources are widely different , and show little dispersion within the separate classes ( risaliti et al .",

    "2009 [ 11 ] ) .",
    "such a large difference is due to the key contribution of the hot dust layers directly exposed to the agn radiation field .",
    "together with the relatively low dust extinction at these wavelengths , this allows the detection of an agn even when it is heavily obscured and/or its total luminosity is small compared with the sb counterpart .",
    "based on the above points , we successfully fitted the observed ulirg spectra with a two - component analytical model , with only two free parameters : the relative agn / sb contribution and the optical depth of the screen - like obscuration ( if any ) affecting the compact agn component .",

    "the _ l_-band spectrum of 20551  shows somewhat puzzling properties [ 7 ] : a strong 3.3  @xmath1 m emission feature ( ew @xmath27 90 nm ) suggests a dominant starburst contribution . on the other hand , the steep observed slope ( @xmath28 ) and the detection of the 3.4-@xmath1 m absorption feature point to the presence of a significant agn affecting the continuum emission .",
    "sani and co - authors [ 17 ] added the _ m_-band ( 45  @xmath1 m ) data to better determine the continuum trend and analyse the broad co absorption band near @xmath29 m .    .",
    "the heavily reddened continuum ( red curve ) is present together with strong co absorption in the _ m_-band .",
    "the regions of bad atmospheric transmission are shaded in yellow .",

    "the observed agn component , however , is heavily obscured and shows extreme dust reddening .",
    "the large optical depth ( @xmath31 , assuming the extinction law of draine 1989 [ 18 ] ) is necessary to reconcile the apparently contradictory observational results , i.e. the high equivalent width of the 3.3-@xmath1 m pah feature and the steep , intense continuum .",
    "the presence of a dust and gas screen absorbing the agn emission is also revealed by the deep absorption profiles due to aliphatic hydrocarbons ( @xmath32 ) and gaseous co ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "this step - wise correlation between continuum reddening and absorption features appears to be a general property of ulirgs hosting an obscured agn [ 11,17 ] .",
    "anyhow , this does not hold under a quantitative point of view : no tight correlation is found among the values of the optical depth , not even between the two absorption features themselves .",

    "we have shown that the high quality of _",
    "spitzer_-irs data allows a very effective _ quantitative _ determination of the agn / sb components around 58  ; this method is much more accurate than those possible in other bands in spite of the lower agn over sb brightness ratio , which rapidly declines with wavelength .",
    "summarizing , once applied to large , virtually complete samples of local ulirgs , the 58  analysis yields the main results listed below : _ ( 1 ) _ the large variations in the observed spectral shape of ulirgs can be successfully explained in terms of the relative agn contribution and its degree of obscuration . _",
    "( 2 ) _ although the larger fraction of ulirg bolometric energy output is associated with the intense sb events , the agn contribution is non - negligible ( @xmath02530% ) and increases with both the total ir luminosity of the host galaxy and , possibly , with the merger stage ( nardini et al .",

    "_ ( 3 ) _ the apparent lack of continuum reddening and the simultaneous detection of deep absorption troughs in some of the most obscured sources ( when a step - wise correlation is generally found , as mentioned earlier ) suggests that the extinction of the agn component in a ulirg environment is not universal .",

    "none the less , a comprehensive interpretation of all the observables ( agn hot - dust emission , continuum reddening , absorption features , pah strength ) is not straightforward .",
    "the general picture is complicated by the different spatial extent of the nuclear region that has been explored in the works mentioned above .",

    "20551  presents a very small fraction ( @xmath47% ) of extended emission in the 13.2-@xmath1 m continuum , which can be mainly associated with the compact , unresolved hot / warm dust component in proximity of the agn ( daz - santos et al .",

    "it is clear that the observed continuum slope , which is expected to be heavily shaped by the agn contribution , can not be reproduced with a single spectral index over the whole range under investigation . in our separate _ l_-band and 58  studies we have assumed an intrinsic slope of @xmath48 for the agn hot - dust continuum , and then applied a power - law extinction of the form @xmath49 [ 18 ] .",

    "in fact , by extending the best - fitting agn model from the _ l_-band to longer wavelengths we largely overestimate the 8-@xmath1 m observed flux .",
    "of course , it is possible that the intrinsic agn spectrum is more complex than the one adopted in our spectral decomposition .",

    "our estimate gives a higher temperature ( @xmath76 ) and correspondingly lower gas mass with respect to [ 23 ] .",
    "the inclusion of the s(0 ) line require some caution , as it is detected with the irs - lh slit , much larger ( @xmath77 ) than the sh one ( @xmath12 ) that samples the previous fluxes . for completeness ,",
    "we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] the observed s(0 ) value as a cross and the value corrected for the relative slit apertures sh / lh as a green point . including also the corrected s(0 )",
    "significantly steepens the linear regression and leads to a lower temperature t@xmath78  k , hence doubling the column density and mass . as a matter of fact ,",
    "a single - temperature component is not suitable to properly reproduce complex systems such as 20551 , and a multi - temperature model should be adopted [ 23,33 ] .",
    "unfortunately the non - detection of higher level transitions [ e.g. from s(4 ) to s(7 ) ] , or their blending with pah features , prevents us from modelling a hot ( @xmath79  k ) 2  component . none the less , as an exercise , we can exclude the s(3 ) point and adopt the corrected s(0 ) in the linear regression .",
    "we now trace a colder 2  component with @xmath80  k , characterized by a huge , likely unphysical would correspond to enormous star formation rates , with an ir radiation even greater than 20551  bolometric luminosity . ]",
    "gas mass ( @xmath81 ) .",
    "we remind that ortho-2  exists only in states of odd rotational quantum number , while para-2  is represented only by states of even @xmath68 , therefore the s(1)/s(3 ) line ratio is independent from the ortho - to - para ratio .",
    "the measured s(1)/s(3 ) is @xmath82 , in agreement with the theoretical value of 1.23 computed for _ no _ extinction and @xmath83  k. from this , we conclude that the obscuring material along the line of sight producing the continuum reddening , deep features and x - ray absorption lies in between the agn and molecular 2  clouds and is possibly associated with the sb region .",
    "we can now compile all the different aspects of the previous analysis in order to construct a comprehensive picture of the absorbing / emitting medium in 20551 . a stratified structure of the circumnuclear material , involving the different spatial scales ( see fig .  [ fig0 ] )",
    ", can well explain all the observational evidence .",
    "the basic ingredients are summarized as follows : _ ( i ) _ the hot dust component , where the grains are transiently heated to temperatures close to the sublimation limit , can be associated with both the inner surface of the agn torus and the starburst environment ; however , due to the different spatial concentration of the hot dust in the two cases , the resulting nearly power - law continuum is much more intense for an agn . _",
    "( ii ) _ a cold dust component and a large amount of gas are required to produce the continuum reddening , the deep absorption features ( aliphatic hydrocarbon , co , hac , silicates ) , as well as the x - ray absorption .",
    "consequently , the inferred properties of the circumnuclear absorber point to an optically thick screen along the line of sight towards a point - like source such as a bright agn , rather than to a diffuse dust distribution spatially mixed with the energy source ( as in a starburst )",
    ". moreover , this dust screen must be geometrically thick , since a large covering factor would be consistent with the absence of high - ionization coronal lines ( e.g. [ ne  v ] , [ o  iv ] ) .",
    "these properties are typical of the agn putative torus , which is located at the spatial scales ranging from a few pc to several tens of pc from the central engine .",
    "the obscuring medium is also expected to be sufficiently close to the central agn ( i.e. with the inner edge of the torus falling within the dust sublimation radius ) to allow for the observed gas over - abundance . on farther scales ( several hundreds to a few thousands pc ) ,",
    "molecular clouds are associated with the starburst event . here ,",
    "in addition to warm thermal dust , the pah grains can survive and give rise to the typical set of emission features usually employed as sf tracers . furthermore , with the increasing optical depth within the individual star - forming clouds , photo - dissociation becomes eventually slow and inefficient , so that hydrogen also appears in the molecular state .",
    "this explains the unextincted 2  pure rotational lines detectd in the mid - ir . a cartoon of the circmunuclear environment is shown in fig .",
    "+ of course , the qualitative considerations driven by the mid - ir spectral properties are not sufficient to fully understand the multiple physical conditions characterizing such an extreme source . in order to probe the nuclear enviroment and its surroundings , a detailed spectral analysis at different wavelengths is needed , possibly resolving and disentangling the different spatial scale .",
    "this would make it possible to address the problems connected to the uncertain shape of both the intrinsic and the observed agn continuum , and therefore to better constrain the actual extinction law . at present ,",
    "even the joint modelling of the @xmath0220   spectral energy distribution ( sed ) is frustrated by the spread of the signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) and the relative flux calibration among ground - based and space facilities involved in the observations . the forthcoming _ james webb space telescope _ ( _ jwst _ ) is the ideal instrument to probe the mid - ir sed of local ulirgs , offering the opportunity of high - quality data obtained with relatively short exposures .",
    "for example , a high - resolution ( @xmath84 ) observation of 20551  with nirspec ( bagnasco et al . 2007",
    "[ 35 ] ) centred at 3.5  requires only @xmath0300 sec of exposure time to reach a s / n@xmath85 per resolution element . at longer wavelengths , the medium - resolution spectrometer miri ( wright et al . 2004 [ 36 ] )",
    "will ensure similarly high performances . besides the unique settings available ( among which integral field unit and multi - shutter array ) , _ jwst _ will fully cover the @xmath0125  range , allowing us to detect and resolve even faint and/or blended features . in this context , the separation of highly excited rotational levels of the co @xmath86 band would be particularly suitable to constrain the dense gas temperature , density and kinematics within the circumnuclear environment ( see e.g. shirahata et al . [",
    "in the present work we have first reviewed the properties of 20551 a prototypical local ulirg observed by our group in the _ l_- and _ m_-band with isaac at the _ vlt_. the spectral analysis also includes the 58  spectrum obtained by _ spitzer_/irs .",
    "according to the agn / sb decomposition method we have developed in several previous papers [ 7,10,17 ] , 20551  turns out to be a composite source , dominated in the mid - ir by hot dust emission associated with deeply embedded bh accretion and characterized by a vigorous circumnuclear starburst which provides the main power supply to the whole system .",
    "we have then interpreted the key spectral properties of the source over the @xmath0320  wavelength range ( e.g. the reddening of the continuum , the presence of deep absorption features , the lack of high - ionization coronal lines and the detection of 2  rotational transitions ) in the framework of dust and gas spatial distribution and physical conditions .",
    "our main results are the following : ( _ i _ ) the shape of the agn intrinsic continuum is partly degenerate with the form of the extinction law .",
    "this is mainly evident beyond 5 .",
    "( _ ii _ ) given the gas amount inferred from x - ray observations , the central regions of 20551 seem to have a dust - to - gas ratio much lower than the galactic interstellar medium .",
    "( _ iii _ ) aliphatic hydrocarbon and hac grains are over - abundant with respect to the local molecular clouds .",
    "( _ iv _ ) a large covering of the nuclear engine likely prevents the ionization of the agn narrow - line region and the excitation of fine - structure lines .",
    "therefore , a screen of cold , dusty gas lies along the line of sight to the agn , heavily extinguishing its spatially compact primary emission .",
    "( _ v _ ) a large amount ( @xmath87 ) of warm ( @xmath88  k ) molecular hydrogen and pah grains are associated with the starburst environment on typical scales of a few kpc .",
    "the findings have been _ qualitatively _ interpreted by means of a simple geometrical configuration as the one sketched in fig .",
    "we have finally described the great improvement in terms of sensitivity , spectral coverage and resolution that will be achieved in the near future with the advent of _ jwst_. this will also allow us to separate the different spatial scales and explore in larger detail the connection between the agn and sb environments and the mutual feedback between the two physical processes .",
