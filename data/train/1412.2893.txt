    "stabilization of mixed finite element methods for saddle point problems @xcite is by now a well - established technique to design stable methods with finite element spaces which do not have to satisfy the so - called babu@xmath0ka  brezzi condition .",
    "the idea is to add a properly weighted residual of the momentum balance equation to the variational bilinear form .",
    "this resembles the least squares method and hence the formulation has often been called the galerkin least squares method .",
    "this is , however , a somewhat misleading name since the formulation does not lead to a minimization problem .    in the paper by franca and stenberg",
    "@xcite a unified stability and error analysis for this class of methods was given .",
    "the error estimates were obtained under the assumption that the solution is regular enough , and so far a general analysis has been missing .    the purpose of this paper is to address this question .",
    "we will show that using a technique proposed recently by gudi @xcite it is possible to derive quasi - optimal a priori estimates .",
    "this technique uses estimates known from a posteriori error analysis .",
    "in addition to the a priori analysis , we discuss a posteriori estimates .",
    "since the added stabilization term is exactly a weighted residual , the a posteriori analysis is very straightforward .",
    "similar a posteriori estimates were given in [ 18 ] .",
    "our analysis seems , however , more natural .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in the next sections we recall the continuous stokes problem and its discretization by stabilized finite element methods .",
    "then we present the new a priori analysis .",
    "we end by deriving the a posteriori error estimates .",
    "we will use well established notation .",
    "in addition , we will use the shorthand notation @xmath1 for : there exist a positive constant @xmath2 , independent of the mesh parameter @xmath3 , such that @xmath4 .",
    "we consider the stokes equations for slow ( or very viscous ) steady fluid flow or equivalently , the equations of incompressible elasticity , which we normalize in such a way that @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the dynamic viscosity or first lam parameter , respectively .",
    "let @xmath7 denote the vector valued divergence applied to tensors and denote the symmetric velocity gradient / strain tensor by @xmath8 introducing the second order differential operator @xmath9 the problem is : given @xmath10 , find @xmath11 such that @xmath12 the domain @xmath13 is assumed bounded and with a polygonal or polyhedral boundary . with the bilinear form @xmath14 and the linear form @xmath15",
    "we define the variational formulation .",
    "the continuous problem . _ find @xmath16 such that _ @xmath17 here , @xmath18",
    "the stability of this is a consequence of korn s inequality @xmath19 and the condition @xmath20 together they imply the stability :    it holds @xmath21    classical mixed finite element methods are based on the variational formulation above posed in the finite element subspaces . by analogy with the continuous problem ,",
    "the discrete spaces have to satisfy the babu@xmath0ka  brezzi condition , i.e. the discrete counterpart of . the recent monograph @xcite contains the state of the art information on stable velocity  pressure pairs .",
    "we denote the piecewise polynomial finite element subspaces for the velocity and pressure by @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively .",
    "the underlying mesh is denoted by @xmath24 . as usual ,",
    "the diameter of an element @xmath25 , is denoted by @xmath26 .",
    "next , we define the bilinear and linear forms @xmath27 @xmath28 from the differential equation it follows .",
    "[ s = l]if @xmath29 it holds @xmath30    the differential equation has to be interpreted in the sense of distributions . however , with the assumption @xmath29 the sum @xmath31 is in @xmath32 and hence both @xmath33 and @xmath34 are well defined and equal .",
    "next , we define the forms @xmath35 and @xmath36 where @xmath37 is a positive constant less than the constant @xmath38 in the following inverse inequality , which is valid in piecewise polynomial spaces with shape regular elements : @xmath39 the stabilized formulation is then the following .    the finite element method .",
    "_ find @xmath40 such that _",
    "the consistency follows from lemma [ s = l ] .",
    "suppose that @xmath29 .",
    "then finite element method is consistent , in the sense that the exact solution @xmath16 to satisfies the discrete variational form @xmath42    next , we outline the main steps for analyzing the stability of the formulation . for @xmath43 , the inverse inequality and the assumption @xmath44 give @xmath45 as for the continuous problem the stability for the velocity follows from korn s inequality , whereas the stability of the pressure is in the mesh dependent semi - norm @xmath46 as a consequence of the added stabilization term .",
    "this gives stability for all pressures except the piecewise constants .",
    "in the case of continuous pressure approximations , all modes except the globally constant function are stabilized . for discontinuous pressures",
    "the stable subspace is that of pressures orthogonal to the space of piecewise constants denoted by @xmath47the stabilization term has no influence on @xmath48 .",
    "hence the stability has to be based on the original bilinear form @xmath49 , i.e. we have to assume that the following discrete stability inequality is valid : @xmath50 the final stability estimate with the @xmath51-norm for the pressure is then proved using and and a `` trick '' , first introduced by pitkranta @xcite , and later applied for the stokes problem by verfrth @xcite .",
    "our stability theorem is formulated as follows .",
    "suppose that one of the following conditions is valid : @xmath52 for @xmath53 it then holds@xmath54    we emphasize the generality of the formulation . for continuous pressures",
    "all elements , triangles , quadrilaterals , tetrahedrons , prisms , hexahedrons and pyramids can be used , and also mixing them is allowed provided the mesh is conforming . for discontinuous elements",
    "the only condition is that the stability estimate is valid . in two dimensions",
    "this is true if the local element are @xmath55^{2}$ ] and @xmath56^{2}$ ] for triangles and quadrilaterals , respectively . in three dimensions the choices @xmath57^{3}$ ] and @xmath56^{3}$ ] are sufficient for tetrahedrons and hexahedrons .",
    "the following error estimate presented in the papers @xcite is a direct consequence of the stability and consistency @xmath58",
    "the drawback of this estimate is that it requires that @xmath59 and @xmath60 . for less regular solutions",
    "the convergence was left open in the papers cited above . in the following",
    "we will amend this situation by using arguments introduced by gudi  @xcite .",
    "first , we recall results from a posteriori error analysis @xcite . for an edge or face @xmath61 in the mesh ,",
    "we denote by @xmath62 the union of all elements in @xmath24 having @xmath61 as an edge or a face .",
    "we define @xmath63 by @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the @xmath51-projection of @xmath66 .",
    "similarly , we define @xmath67 with @xmath68 being the @xmath51-projection .",
