    "this talk mainly focuses on @xmath7 multi-@xmath2 processes in the @xmath0 scattering formalism  @xcite .",
    "recent development of the original scattering formalism  @xcite can be reviewed in refs .",
    "the central idea rests upon symmetries that emerge for qcd in the large @xmath3 limit .",
    "the symmetries relate scattering amplitudes in channels of different @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and other quantum numbers and consequently impose degeneracies among poles that occur within them .",
    "however , this scattering formalism depends upon a single incoming source and a single outgoing source scattering from the baryon .",
    "therefore , a meaningful way to constrain such multipion processes must be considered .",
    "also , a standard @xmath3 counting shows that the generic scattering amplitude for @xmath10 is @xmath11 , while that for @xmath12 [ fig .",
    "[ scatfigs](a ) ] is @xmath13 .",
    "1.3 in 1.3 in 1.3 in    nevertheless , circumstances exist in which processes that _ eventually _ produce two ( or more ) pions nevertheless appear with amplitudes at leading order , @xmath11 .",
    "in particular , the @xmath14 is stable for sufficiently large @xmath3 ; its width scales as @xmath15 .",
    "therefore , as in fig .",
    "[ scatfigs](b ) , the @xmath16 process may be cut ( indicating an on - shell state ) at the intermediate stage , @xmath17 . of course",
    ", we live in the @xmath18 world where @xmath19 is over 100  mev ; even so , @xmath19 is considered sufficiently small that researchers regularly extract @xmath17 partial widths .",
    "similarly , processes such as in fig .",
    "[ scatfigs](c ) ( @xmath20 followed by @xmath21 ) may be analyzed in the two - body formalism since @xmath20 partial widths have been tabulated .",
    "the derivation of the meson - baryon scattering amplitudes formalism  @xcite is done by considering only baryons lying in the ground - state band of large @xmath3 , whose nonstrange members have spin = isospin @xmath22 .",
    "this restriction is not physically constraining since all observed meson - baryon scattering processes fit into this category .",
    "the basic process is @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a meson of spin @xmath25 and isospin @xmath26 , in a state of relative orbital angular momentum @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) with a baryon @xmath29 of spin = isospin @xmath30 in the ground - state multiplet , and the total spin angular momentum of the meson and baryon is denoted @xmath31 .",
    "the intermediate state is labeled by quantum numbers @xmath8 and @xmath9 , giving the full partial wave @xmath32 .",
    "abbreviating the multiplicity @xmath33 of an su(2 ) representation of quantum number @xmath34 by @xmath35 $ ] , one finds  @xcite @xmath36 ( [ r][r^\\prime][s][s^\\prime][\\tilde{k}][\\tilde{k}^\\prime])^{1/2 } \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\times \\left\\ { \\begin{array}{ccc }",

    "the factors in braces are @xmath44 coefficients , and @xmath45 are universal amplitudes ( _ reduced _ or _",
    "k _ amplitudes ) that are independent of @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 .",
    "the linear relations among the scattering amplitudes can be seen from the structure of eq .",
    "( [ mmaster ] ) ; the point is there are more @xmath52 amplitudes than @xmath53 amplitudes .",
    "here we present the transition amplitude for @xmath6 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath5 , @xmath56 , and @xmath4 final states of spin @xmath57 , @xmath58 and both positive-@xmath59 and negative-@xmath60 parity resonances in tables  [ t1 ] and  [ t2 ] .",
    "the notation for @xmath61 partial waves is @xmath62 ; if @xmath63 then the label @xmath28 is suppressed , while if @xmath51 ( the @xmath64 spin ) is zero , then @xmath65 equals the spin of baryon @xmath66 and is suppressed .",
    "the association of resonances with poles  as determined by presence of absence of certain decay channels  seems robust . in particular , eq .",
    "( [ mmaster ] ) can be employed in a straightforward fashion to show that @xmath67 contains a single @xmath37 amplitude [ with @xmath68 , and the mixed partial wave @xmath69 contains a single @xmath37 amplitude [ with @xmath70  @xcite . for given @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath59 these",
    "two amplitudes always probe distinct @xmath37 .",
    "the following is an example of brief analysis for one of the two channels .",
    "1 .   @xmath71 : the two well - established resonances in this channel are @xmath72 ( the roper ) and @xmath73 , while our transition amplitude calculations provide two distinct pole structures , @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "the @xmath72 has a very small , @xmath76 , @xmath6 br while @xmath73 has a small but nonnegligible @xmath6 br , @xmath77 . comparing this observation to our tabulated result for",
    "the @xmath78 transition amplitude suggests that the roper is a @xmath79 pole and the @xmath73 is a @xmath75 pole .",
    "this assignment agrees very well with the assumption of the roper as a radial excitation of ground - state @xmath80 , which is a ( nonresonant ) @xmath81 state .",
