    "partial or full ring - like structures , which apparently are projections of shells , are often found in the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "these dense shells could possibly be driven by one of the numerous sources like , ionising radiation from young star - clusters , early type massive stars , blast - waves from supernovae , or energetic stellar winds . detailed observations of these shells in various bands of the infrared wavelength have also revealed isolated sites of massive star formation ( e.g. deharveng , zavagno & caplan 2005 ) . in the recent past a number of such sites have been reported , for instance in the hii region rcw79 ( zavagno _ et al .",
    "_ 2006 ) , and rcw120 ( anderson _ et al .",
    "a catalogue of 600 such shells in the galactic disk was drawn up by churchwell _",
    "( 2006 ) as part of the glimpse survey .",
    "the survey showed that a large proportion ( @xmath290 % ) of these shells are thin , i.e. the shell thickness is less than a third of the outer shell radius , and driven primarily by massive stars ( @xmath3 shells ) , see also zavagno _ et al .",
    "_ 2010 .",
    "it is well - known that relatively high - mass stars emit powerful radiation that ionises gas in the local neighbourhood , and heats it to temperatures typically of the order of 10@xmath4 kelvin .",
    "this hot plasma propagates in the interstellar medium ( ism ) at a highly supersonic speed ( typical velocity of expansion in the initial phases is @xmath5 km / s ) , whence it gradually equilibrates to a significantly lower temperature , of order a few thousand kelvin .",
    "the expanding , roughly spherical volume of hot plasma , the so called stroemgren sphere , cools primarily via collisional excitation of heavier elements such as carbon , nitrogen , and oxygen , and sputtering of dust - grains while sweeping up a dense shell of gas in the ism ; the familiar snow - plough phase .",
    "this shell is confined by two shocks , first , due to the wind driving it , and second , due to the reverse shock resulting from the propagation of the shell in the ism .",
    "the stability of such shells has been discussed by numerous authors , e.g. elmegreen & elmegreen ( 1978 ) , larson ( 1985 ) , elmegreen ( 1989 ) , vishniac ( 1983 , 1994 ) , whitworth ( 1994 ) , wuensch & palou@xmath6 ( 2001 ) and anathpindika ( 2010 ) .",
    "it has been demonstrated by these and several other authors that , a shock - confined shell is unstable to instabilities arising out of shock - induced turbulence within layers of the shell .",
    "turbulence leads to enhanced transfer of momentum in different regions of the shell that makes it unstable to the so called thin shell instability ( tsi ) ( vishniac 1983 , 1994 ) , and raises the effective local sound - speed .",
    "the stability of the shell depends on the critical interplay between the gravitational instability ( gi ) and the tsi .",
    "a full fledged analytic treatment of the stability of a shock - confined slab is rather complex as has been demonstrated by vishniac ( 1994 ) , for instance , who showed that such slabs were likely to be unstable to the so called non - linear thin shell instability ( ntsi ) .",
    "traditionally , stability analysis of shocked shells and/or slabs , for all practical purposes , have been simplified by excising shock dynamics in favour of a simple high - pressure approximation thereby eliminating perturbative effects of the tsi , and its non - linear excursion ( e.g. whitworth _ et al . _",
    "1994b ) . anathpindika ( 2009 , 2010 ) numerically showed that a shocked slab and/or shell is unstable to the tsi , which , soon after its formation , develops wiggles on its surface and grows non - linearly . ehlerov@xmath7 & palou@xmath6 ( 2002 ) derived the critical density for a shell to become gravitationally unstable . under a sinusoidal approximation for these perturbations , anathpindika ( 2010 ) deduced an expression for the wavenumber of the fastest growing mode .",
    "below , we propose to test the validity of this expression for hii shells driven by typical candidate stars listed in table 5.3 of spitzer ( 1978 ) , and deduce a mass function for clumps condensing out of these shells .",
    "the case of a shell driven by a supernova blast wave will be considered separately .",
    "we shall demonstrate that the mass function so derived is consistent with that reported by fukui _",

    "let us consider a typical source of ionising radiation that emits n@xmath8 number of photons per second . if @xmath9 , @xmath10 are the respective number of protons and @xmath11 per unit volume , then @xmath12 is the number of electrons captured per @xmath13 in the ground state , and the flux of photons flowing through a shell of radius , @xmath14 , is- @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the recombination coefficient that excludes electron captures to the ground state , and defined as @xmath17 at a temperature @xmath18 ; @xmath19 is the ionic charge and @xmath20 is the recombination coefficient function corresponding to @xmath16 ( see table 5.2 , spitzer 1978 ) .",

    "this efficiency is defined as , @xmath111 which suggests that a large proportion of the initially injected energy is lost in heating the ism . the attenuated sound speed , @xmath112 , defined by eqn . ( 19 ) below accounts for the effects of turbulence generated by various hydrodynamic instabilities",
    "which were not directly included in the perturbative analysis that led to eqn .",
    "( 9 ) , and @xmath113}.\\ ] ]    the glimpse survey of supernovae shells produced a catalogue of 95 snrs ( reach _ et al .",
    "_ 2006 ) , none of which have shown unambiguous evidence in favour of the collect and collapse model , although a sample of snrs have shown association with oh masers .",
    "however , the source of these masers is unclear and could perhaps be due to sporadic star - formation triggered in molecular clouds over - run by snrs .",
    "despite this being the case , one may assert that possible condensation in snrs may take a while , as suggested by the magnitude of @xmath79 , which is roughly two orders of magnitude larger than the timescale over which the hii shell produced fragments .",
    "the resulting fragments are therefore likely to be at least as massive as those forming in the former case .",
    "the number of clumps , @xmath114 , condensing out of a shell is @xmath115 .",
    "then @xmath116 or equivalently , in terms of the wavenumber , @xmath52 , @xmath117 this equation defines the number of clumps in an interval @xmath118 , the integration of which , over the wave number domain yields the mass spectrum for putative clumps .",
    "figure 4 shows a typical mass spectrum for clumps condensing out of hii shells , obtained via a monte - carlo integration of eqn .",
    "the integration was performed for 10,000 realisations of shell fragmentation , each producing @xmath114 number of clumps .",
    "thus , we have @xmath2180,000 clumps for the o5 star and fewer , @xmath119 , for an o9 star .",
    "the relatively smaller shell driven by the latter star not only produces fewer fragments but also , those that are comparatively less massive than those in the former case .",
    "however , we note that extremely large clumps , @xmath120 , may only be sparingly produced as is evident from the mass spectrum in fig .",
    "the mass spectrum for stars of either spectral type is similar and a power - law , @xmath121 , appears to fit the derived spectrum reasonably well in either cases ; @xmath122 , and 1.5 respectively .",
    "the spectrum derived here is consistent with the one obtained for large clouds by fukui _",
    "( 1999 ) , and roslowsky ( 2005 ) .",
    "similarly , we also obtain the mass spectrum for fragments condensing out of the snr driven shells .",
    "the spectrum for this case is plotted in fig . 5 , and a power - law similar to the one in earlier two cases , fits the spectrum reasonably well . in fact , this latter spectrum is similar , @xmath123 , to that for the fragments resulting from the hii shell driven by an o5 star ; spectrum for the snr was derived for @xmath124 realisations of shell fragmentation , and shows considerable shift towards a higher mass in comparison to the distributions shown in fig .",
    "this is probably because the velocity of an hii shell in its dense phase decays more rapidly than that of an snr , which pushes up the attenuated sound - speed , @xmath112 , for the latter that in turn raises the mass , @xmath99 , as seen in fig .",
    "star forming clumps as massive as @xmath22500 m@xmath1 have been reported in the hii shell n49 and rcw34 ( e.g. zavagno _ et al .",
    "_ 2010 , bik _ et al .",
    "a similar treatment of the problem was presented by whitworth _",
    "( 1994a , b ) who arrived at a minimum clump mass of only a few tens of m@xmath1 , which in the light of present findings , appears somewhat conservative . our claim more massive clumps",
    "is supported by recent observations described above .",
    "it is well known , the evolution of a cloud is governed by the dynamical effects associated with the complex interplay between self - gravity , and other contributing factors such as turbulence and the magnetic field that support a clump against the former .",
    "it is therefore crucial to predict clump masses with reasonably good accuracy ; under - estimation of the mass of putative clumps , for a given radius , which in the present case is roughly equal to the wavelength of the unstable mode , will lower the average density and thus raise the clump - lifetime .",
    "an increase in the longevity of clumps will also possibly make events such as clump - clump collisions more probable , than they are known to be .",
    "inter - clump collisions , according to simulations , could lead to bursts of star - formation with fewer low - mass stars ( e.g. chapman _ et al .",
    "_ 1992 , anathpindika 2009 ) , that will tend to shift the stellar initial mass function towards a top - heavy distribution , away from the widely reported lognormal form .",
    "we have examined the stability of thin , dense shells driven by powerful ionising radiation originating from massive , early type stars and/or blast waves from a supernova .",
    "our work here shows that fragmentation of these shells is likely to produce large clumps , with masses typically @xmath0 m@xmath1 .",
    "this calculated range of fragment masses is consistent with that reported via observations of hii shells , and the fragments so formed could spawn a second generation of stars , which may in turn trigger the next generation of stars in the surrounding ism .",
    "the simple calculations discussed above appear to suggest that the ratio of thickness - to - radius for a shell evolves only weakly with time , and that calculated here ( see fig . 3 ; @xmath125 ) , is consistent with the values reported in the glimpse survey for hii shells .",
    "similar results are obtained for an snr , which , however , appears to be much thinner compared to the shells driven by ob stars .",
    "this could perhaps be the reason why snrs often appear filamentary in the irac bands ( e.g. reach _ et al .",
    "simulations studying the evolution of thin shells such those by anathpindika ( 2010 ) have demonstrated the dominance of tsi in shocked shells ; the surface of the shell was also shown to develop ripples , similar to breathing modes on fluid surfaces ( fig .",
    "3 in anathpindika ( 2010 ) ) . while wiggles on the shell surface associated with the tsi though coplanar , are generally orthogonal to its surface , and so in case of a shell in the plane of the sky , can not alone account for the reported filamentary nature",
    "however , breathing modes coupled with local magnetic field could perchance explain the occurrence of filaments reported by reach _",
