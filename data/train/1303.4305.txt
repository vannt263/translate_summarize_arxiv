    "since far infrared emission from galaxies is primarily powered by dust absorption of photon radiation from young , massive stars and the 20-cm radio continuum by relativistic cosmic - ray electrons , the fir - radio correlation requires physical connections to exist between star formation processes , cosmic ray production , and the physical state of the ism .",
    "these connections have now been further extended by @xmath1-ray observations of galaxies obtained at tev energies from the ground with veritas and hess and from space at lower energies with _",
    "starburst galaxies are particularly interesting for testing models of the fir - radio correlation in galaxies .",
    "while electron losses in normal galaxies occur via synchrotron radiation in a generally diffuse ism filling large volumes , the situation in starbursts is much more extreme . that this correlation applies to starbursts , with their intense star formation , high pressure ism , and large - scale galactic winds , as well as normal galaxies ,",
    "is puzzling as the radio synchrotron emission depends on the electron energy density and the magnetic field strength @xcite , as well as losses via galactic winds .",
    "the observed validity of the fir - radio correlation has led to the concept of calorimeter models for cosmic ray interactions in galaxies .",
    "the underlying principle of the calorimeter model is that the energy radiated by relativistic particles scales with the relativistic particle energy input . as cosmic rays",
    "are produced by supernovae , the total energy in cosmic rays follows from the supernova rate and thus from the star - formation rate ( sfr ) .",
    "a galaxy is then a calorimeter if essentially all the power that supernovae transfer to relativistic particles can be balanced by observable radiative losses .",
    "if the calorimeter model applies to cosmic - ray electrons , then the synchrotron luminosity is proportional to supernova rate and thus the sfr , and the fir - radio correlation is obtained .",
    "if it applies to cosmic - ray protons , then the @xmath1-ray luminosity also depends only on the supernova rate .",
    "the actual situation is complicated by additional factors , including the effect of the magnetic fields on synchrotron radiative efficiencies , non - radiative losses such as ionization , and advection of particles and magnetic fields if a galactic wind is present .",
    "the existence of such secondary factors that especially influence synchrotron luminosities make the existence of the fir - radio correlation all the more remarkable .",
    "observations with hess and veritas on the ground and _ fermi _ in space are filling in the gap in measurements of high energy @xmath1-ray photons from galaxies , including nearby starburst systems ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "while our model currently includes inverse compton emission from only primary electrons , we found that it to be a significant contribution from the total @xmath1-ray flux at both gev and tev energies .",

    "thus , to accurately model the observed @xmath1-ray flux at lower energies , we must include both neutral pion decay and bremsstrahlung in our work .",

    "we tested several models and found that the free - free covering factor was always near unity . a simpler model consisting of a cylindrical wall of warm , ionized gas surrounding a lower density hot medium provides a reasonable representation of the free - free radio absorption in m82 .    the multiphase nature of the ism is incorporated by considering the different properties of the warm and hot ionized gas .",
    "the warm , ionized gas is assumed to be magnetically threaded and produces both synchrotron and free - free emission ( @xmath134 ) as well as free - free absorption ( @xmath135 ) .",
    "synchrotron self - absorption is found to be negligible in m82 , so we need only consider free - free absorption .",

    "as one increases the magnetic field strength , you must also increase the wind speed to achieve a similarly good fit .",
    "why might such a degeneracy occur ?",
    "the magnetic field strength and the wind speed both affect the amount of synchrotron emission .",
    "the magnetic field essentially scales the radio spectrum up and down as the square of the magnetic field strength ; however , because the high frequency portion of the spectrum is dominated by thermal emission from the ionized gas , changing the magnetic field does not change the high frequency end .",
    "if we increase the wind speed , then we decrease the advection time and thus decrease the number of cosmic - ray electrons and positrons in the starburst region . by advecting away some of the electrons / positrons , we decrease the amount of synchrotron emission .",
    "because we have fixed the molecular and ionized gas masses and therefore the average density , it is necessary to have advection to create a better fit as otherwise we overpredict the radio spectrum .",
    "if we increase the wind speed too much , then the advection time is shorter than the loss lifetime , and we no longer have enough cosmic - ray protons to produce the correct amount of @xmath1-ray flux .",

    "while the observations relating to ionized gas density , magnetic field strength , and wind speed leave much uncertainty as to their true values , observations for spectral index and molecular gas mass are more constraining .",

    "we find that the minimum @xmath2 value decreases as the gas mass increases with there being a slightly larger gap between in @xmath2 values between @xmath150 and @xmath124 than between @xmath124 and @xmath151 .",
    "over the course of this paper , we have investigated a model for cosmic ray interactions in the starburst galaxy m82 .",
    "we incorporate synchrotron emission and free - free absorption and emission into the radio spectrum and include neutral pion decay and bremsstrahlung as mechanisms for @xmath1-ray production . for the most part ,",
    "the fits agree well with the data , with the exception of 92 ghz radio data point .",
    "the radio fits also indicate that there is a degeneracy between magnetic field strength and wind speed .",
    "we find that for both the radio and @xmath1-ray spectra a spectral index of @xmath148 = 2.1 and a molecular gas mass of @xmath157 m@xmath7 produce the best fit ( see  4.4 ) , but a variety of different models fit both the radio and @xmath1-ray spectra well .",
    "however , while the @xmath2 tests on the radio spectrum allow for fits over a large range of wind speeds , the @xmath2 tests on the @xmath1-ray spectrum more severely limit the range of allowable wind speeds .",
    "one of the main questions we seek to answer in this paper is whether or not m82 is a calorimeter .",
    "we define a calorimeter such that cosmic - ray proton or electron energy losses dominate over advective or diffusive losses . in the case of the cosmic - ray electrons , it is clear that the galaxy is an electron calorimeter as energy losses dominate over advective losses for all wind speeds tested ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "however , it is more difficult to decide exactly when a galaxy is no longer a proton calorimeter . in the case of the cosmic - ray protons",
    ", the advection timescale is about equal to the peak of the energy loss lifetime ( see figure 1 ) meaning that the galaxy is a 50% calorimeter .",
    "how calorimetric a galaxy is depends on not only on the wind speed , which determines the advection timescale , and the average density , which determines the energy loss timescale , but also on the cosmic ray acceleration efficiency . throughout the paper ,",
    "we have assumed cosmic ray acceleration efficiency ( @xmath29 ) of 10% . to investigate the impact of acceleration efficiency , we tested two alternative values : a decreased efficiency of @xmath158% and an increased efficiency of @xmath159% ( that could also be achieved with an efficiency of 10% and an supernova rate of 0.14 yr@xmath0 ) .    for the 4% case , the resulting radio models consistently required higher magnetic field strengths due to a lack of electrons because of the decrease in the primary electron population and because of a decrease in the secondary electron / positron population because of the decrease in primary protons .",
    "the best models required wind speeds on the order of 0 - 100  km  s@xmath0 ( see figure 9 ) .",
    "wind speeds of this magnitude give advection timescales that are longer than the proton energy loss timescales , resulting in an 80%-100% calorimeter .",
    "the best fit had a @xmath2 value nearly a factor of 2 larger than the best fit for an efficiency of @xmath160% for both the @xmath1-ray and radio spectra .",
    "for all three acceleration efficiencies , we found 317 of the 49,000 + models to be within 1@xmath156 for both the radio and @xmath1-ray spectra .",
    "of those 317 models , only 45 had an acceleration efficiency of 4% . based on these results and the extremely low wind speeds , we can effectively rule out the 4% case .",
    "conversely , for the 20% efficiency case , we found that significantly higher wind speeds were required to achieve good fits because of an increase in the overall electron / positron population .",
    "the best models required wind speeds on the order of @xmath31500  km  s@xmath0 ( see figure 9 ) . while models for an efficiency of 10% agree with measurements of wind speeds in the optical @xcite , wind speeds on the order of 1500  km  s@xmath0 agree with x - ray measurements by @xcite .",
    "comparing the resulting advection timescales to the proton energy loss timescales gives a 35% calorimeter .",
    "we find that for this higher acceleration efficiency , the minimum @xmath2 value for the radio spectrum is smaller than in the 10% case , while the @xmath2 value for the @xmath1-ray spectrum is just slightly higher than before ( @xmath161 vs @xmath153 ) .",
    "thus , while we rule out the 4% acceleration efficiency , we consider the 20% case to be plausible .",
    "acceleration efficiency directly affects our initial cosmic ray population .",
    "however , it is not the only factor .",
    "for example , we use the lower bound of 0.07 sn  yr@xmath0 for our supernova rate . if we scaled the supernova rate up and the acceleration efficiency down in equal measure",
    ", our initial population of cosmic rays would be unchanged .",
    "while we have selected one particular set of parameters for our initial cosmic ray population , it is simple to obtain the same population from a slightly different set of initial parameters and as such , we would again produce a degenerate relationship between magnetic field strength and wind speed .",
    "thus , we would produce the same fits as presented above .",
    "it remains a curious question as to why starburst galaxies lie on the same fir - radio correlation as the normal , quiescent galaxies .",
    "the general explanation for the fir - radio correlation in disk galaxies is the electron calorimeter theory by @xcite .",
    "this paper postulates that both fir and radio synchrotron emission are proportional to the supernova rate as fir emission is essentially starlight reradiated by dust grains and radio synchrotron emission comes from energetic electrons accelerated by supernovae @xcite . as such",
    ", it is required that cosmic - ray electrons radiate away their energy wihtin the galaxy to achieve the observed radio synchrotron emission . however , in dense environments such as starburst galaxies , there is a second source of electrons / positrons from proton - proton collisions .",
    "the overall importance of secondary electrons / positrons is dependent upon the ratio of primary protons to primary electrons ( @xmath162 ) .",
    "the significance of secondary electron / positrons decreases as the ratio of primary protons to electrons decreases . in our model",
    ", we leave this ratio as an independent free parameter fixed at 50 based upon supernovae studies in the milky way .",
    "@xcite makes a case for this parameter being model dependent such that the ratio depends on the masses of protons and electrons and the selected spectral index , @xmath163 .",
    "our prefered spectral index is @xmath164 , which gives a ratio of @xmath165 .",
    "as our free parameter selection is smaller than this value , the importance of secondary electrons / positrons would only increase by making the ratio model dependent .",
    "thus , while we find that m82 is an electron calorimeter , the overall picture is complex .",
    "it is true that all cosmic ray electrons are mainly confined to the starburst core .",
    "however , because the galaxy is not also a proton calorimeter , there is an inherent loss of any secondary electrons and positrons that would have resulted from proton - proton collisions in the core .",
    "thus , any electrons produced in the starburst region ( primary or secondary ) are confined to the core but the total possible population of electrons / positrons is not equivalent to the confined population .",
    "this is one of the mechanisms responsible for keeping the galaxy on the fir - radio correlation . without some loss of protons to a advection in a galactic wind",
    ", there would be a larger population of electrons / positrons resulting in a higher radio flux .",
    "our approach to modeling cosmic rays in starburst galaxies builds on that taken in previous models @xcite .",
    "however , we place an emphasis in our models on varying and constraining a variety of possible wind ( advection ) speeds rather than assuming a single , static wind speed @xcite . additionally , whereas some previous models have had more free parameters @xcite",
    ", our approach reduces the varied parameters to a select few .",
    "all other parameters are chosen to be in agreement with observations .",
    "thus , we compare large numbers of models and strive to produce fits to the radio and @xmath1-ray spectra that are more intuitive and observationally informed .",
    "@xcite favor higher mean gas densities , ranging from 100 to 1000  @xmath9 , and strong magnetic fields , ranging from 200 to 1000  @xmath4 g .",
    "their best solution resulted in a density of @xmath166 = 600  @xmath9 and a magnetic field strength of @xmath116 = 450  @xmath4 g .",
    "in contrast , we favor smaller magnetic field strengths ( 225 to 350  @xmath4 g ) . however , though we test smaller densities ( 280 to 415  @xmath9 ) , our best fits have a comparable density of 550  @xmath9 ( see table 1 ) . @xcite favor models with larger supernova rates ( 0.1 - 0.3 sn  yr@xmath0 ) and use a significantly smaller average ism density ( 180  @xmath9 ) .",
    "they produce models with magnetic fields strengths from 120 to 290  @xmath4 g .",
    "this range is comparable to our own results .    like our model ,",
    "both @xcite and @xcite incorporate free - free absorption into their radio models with spectra that turn over at @xmath3700  mhz and @xmath3200  mhz respectively .",
    "neither incorporates a halo synchrotron emission component to allow for comparison with low frequency radio data .",
    "additionally , @xcite assume a constant convection loss timescale of 1 myr which is sufficiently longer than the energy loss timescale for cosmic rays ( at their preferred average density of 600 @xmath9 ) that they find the galaxy to be calorimetric for both protons and electrons .",
    "in addition to creating a model for cosmic rays in starburst galaxies , we address the question of calorimetry in starburst galaxies .",
    "calorimetry is also address by the recent paper @xcite .",
    "a semi - analytical formula which depends on the star - formation rate and supernova acceleration efficiency of a galaxy is used to determine the calorimetric efficiency estimate , while we compare a fully calculated energy loss lifetime against the advection timescale for a variety of wind speeds ( see  3.1 and  5.1 ) .",
    "@xcite find that galaxies with sfr @xmath167 m@xmath7  yr@xmath0 have calorimetric efficiencies of 30% to 50% , a similar result to our own findings .",
    "while studying the complex situation presented by cosmic ray interactions in the starburst galaxy m82 , we found it useful to develop a physically realistic but computationally simple single zone model . in this paper , we present a cosmic ray model for m82 that has few free parameters and is observationally informed .",
    "our model produces statistically reasonable fits to both the radio and @xmath1-ray spectra .",
    "we find that the inclusion of secondary electrons and positrons as well as a galactic wind are key to producing better fits .",
    "in the course of modeling the radio spectrum , we find that geometry is vital due to a rather high ionized gas optical depth at low frequencies .",
    "we achieve the turnover of the radio spectrum in the starburst core due to free - free absorption , but do not reproduce the observed high frequency free - free emission . without adding another level of detail , it is impossible to achieve both the spectrum turnover at low frequencies due to free - free absorption and the necessary flux from free - free emission at high frequencies .    while m82 is undoubtedly an electron calorimeter , it is not straightforward to make such a distinction for the cosmic - ray protons . with our original assumption of an acceleration efficiency of 10% ,",
    "m82 is a 50% proton calorimeter , meaning energy losses within the starburst zone equal advection losses in the galactic wind .",
    "we found that it was not possible to achieve acceptable fits for an 80% calorimeter when decreasing the acceleration efficiency to 4% .",
    "however , of 49,000 + models , fits can be achieved for an increase of the cosmic ray acceleration efficiency to 20% ( or with an efficiency of 10% and a supernova rate of 0.14 yr@xmath0 ) such that m82 is a 35% proton calorimeter .",
    "thus , m82 is at best a 50% calorimeter and from these results , it is clear that a wind is vital to the modeling of cosmic ray interactions in the starburst region .",
    "one of the implications of the fir - radio correlation is that the magnetic and cosmic - ray energy density scale with the sfr . from our models ,",
    "we find that this is partially fulfilled in m82 .",
    "in particular , our @xmath2 analysis puts the magnetic field near ( slightly above ) equipartition , independent of any minimum energy assumption .",
    "this is also fulfilled in that we find m82 to be an electron calorimeter .",
    "thus , our results go part way toward explaining the fir - radio correlation .",
    "however , as we do not find the galaxy to be a proton calorimeter , the cosmic - ray energy density does not completely scale with the sfr . as a consequence of not being a perfect proton calorimeter ,",

    "<S> we construct a family of models for the evolution of energetic particles in the starburst galaxy m82 and compare them to observations to test the calorimeter assumption that all cosmic ray energy is radiated in the starburst region . assuming constant cosmic ray acceleration efficiency with milky way parameters , we calculate the cosmic - ray proton and primary and secondary electron / positron populations as a function of energy . </S>",
    "<S> cosmic rays are injected with galactic energy distributions and electron - to - proton ratio via type ii supernovae at the observed rate of 0.07  yr@xmath0 . from the cosmic ray spectra </S>",
    "<S> , we predict the radio synchrotron and @xmath1-ray spectra . </S>",
    "<S> to more accurately model the radio spectrum , we incorporate a multiphase interstellar medium in the starburst region of m82 . our model interstellar medium is highly fragmented with compact dense molecular clouds and dense photoionized gas , both embedded in a hot , low density medium in overall pressure equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> the spectra predicted by this one - zone model are compared to the observed radio and @xmath1-ray spectra of m82 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath2 tests are used with radio and @xmath1-ray observations and a range of model predictions to find the best - fit parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the best - fit model yields constraints on key parameters in the starburst zone of m82 , including a magnetic field strength of @xmath3250  @xmath4 g and a wind advection speed in the range of 300 - 700  km  s@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that m82 is a good electron calorimeter but not an ideal cosmic - ray proton calorimeter and discuss the implications of our results for the astrophysics of the far infrared - radio correlation in starburst galaxies . </S>"
