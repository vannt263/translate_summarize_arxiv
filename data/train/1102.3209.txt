    "our focus is on comparison of cloudy to cloud - free profiles within rrtm , so we do not need high accuracy calculations of early earth radiative forcings .",

    "generation of an appropriate cloud climatology for this work is not straightforward .",
    "two fundamental problems are shortcomings in available cloud climatologies and averaging to a  single profile .",

    "hence these water paths are indicative only .",
    "using fine resolution spatially and temporally resolved data would help resolve these issues .",

    ", we shall need to simplify cloud properties , tune our model clouds and consider sensitivity of the model energy budget to these clouds .    even with the assumption that each cloud is homogeneous , each of our three cloud layers is represented by a  cloud base and top , water path , liquid : ice ratio , and effective particle sizes for liquid and ice particles , giving 6degrees of freedom for each cloud . with three layers ,",
    "there are eight permutations for overlap , contributing another 7degrees of freedom for the fractional coverage .",
    "a  total of 25degrees of freedom is clearly impossible to explore fully . as a  necessary simplification ,",
    "we fix the cloud base and top , take clouds to be either liquid ( low and mid clouds ) or ice ( high clouds ) and fix the particle size we assume that cloud layers are randomly overlapped , so each cloud layer can be represented by a  single fraction from which the overlap is calculated ( many gcms use a overlap method where cloud layers are correlated ; this is not relevant here as our discrete cloud layers are separated by intervals of clear sky , e.g.  see @xcite ) .",

    "such large effective radii could be justified .",
    "larger droplets lead to more rain , so should make clouds thinner . to account for this , @xcite arbitrarily decrease the liquid water path of their stratus clouds by a  factor of 3.7 , which is at the high end of likely decreases @xcite . even with these very strong assumptions ,",

    "is that @xcite requires a highly non - standard climate sensitivity to force his model . in the sensitivity test where he uses a more standard climate sensitivity",
    ", it results in a mean temperature @xmath55c during the archean . even if the underlying hypothesis had not been refuted , the same arguments as above would apply : plausible decreases in stratus are insufficient to resolve the fysp .    when calculating radiative forcing from increased greenhouse gas concentrations , we find that omitting clouds leads to a  systematic overestimate relative to models in which clouds are included in a physically based manner . with 0.1bar ( the relevant quantity for a based resolution to the faint young sun paradox in the late archean ) the overestimate of radiative forcing from modelling without clouds approaches 10wm@xmath1 in our model , equivalent to the clear - sky forcing from 100ppm . as the radiative transfer code we use underestimates forcing from at this level , and we include in our profile , the difference between the real cloud case study and the cloud - free model here must be seen as a  lower bound on the error from omitting clouds . for other greenhouse gases , especially those which absorb strongly in the water vapour window , the overestimation by a  cloud - free model would likely be larger .",
    "this would affect calculations of the warming by methane and ammonia and of recently proposed archean greenhouse gases , ethane @xcite and ocs @xcite .",
    "the question of what direct effect clouds might have is a  more interesting and difficult one .",
    "we can address this best by considering what radiative forcing can be generated in both the shortwave and longwave spectral regions by changing cloud physical properties , and whether such changes in cloud physical properties can be justified .    for solar radiation ( shortwave ) , low level stratus clouds have the greatest effect . removing them from the model",
    "entirely gives a  forcing of 25wm@xmath1 .",
    "even this end - member falls short of the 50wm@xmath1 that is needed to resolve the fysp .",
    "a  more plausible combination of reduced fraction and water path and increased droplet size would give a  maximum forcing of 1015wm@xmath1 .",
    "however , suitable justification for these changes does not come easily .",
    "@xcite asserted that dms fluxes would be low in the archean , but there may well have been other biological and chemical sources for the sulphuric acid on which water condenses ( dms is a  precursor to this ) . for example , methyl mercaptan is produced abundantly by bacteria @xcite .",
    "observations of clouds show that the effective radius rarely becomes larger that 15 m @xcite , which implies that regionally low ccn flux does not lead to very large droplets .",
    "if there were less land early in earth s history and more zonally uninterrupted ocean , one might expect there to be more cloud rather than less ( similar to how there is greater cloud fraction in the southern hemisphere than the northern hemisphere ) . also relating to low cloud ,",
    "@xcite and @xcite contend that less galactic cosmic rays were incident on the troposphere during the archean and this would have led to less stratus .",
    "however , the underlying hypothesis for this has been refuted .    for terrestrial radiation ( longwave ) , high level clouds are most important as they are coldest ( the greenhouse effect depends on the temperature difference between the surface and the cloud ) .",
    "the end member case is 100% coverage of high clouds which are optimised for their greenhouse effect , being both thicker and higher than our case study .",
    "such an end member case gives a  forcing of 50wm@xmath1 , which would just be sufficient to resolve the fysp .",
    "however , physical justification for any of the required changes is lacking .",
    "@xcite invoke a  controversial negative feedback of increased cirrus fraction with decreased temperature ( the hypothesis of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but a  true resolution to the fysp should give temperatures equal or higher than present .",
    "thus , even if the hypothesis was correct , it would act to oppose warming .",
    "it is difficult to think of other mechanisms to make high clouds wider and thicker .",
    "whether clouds should have been higher in the archean may warrant more study .",
    "the absence of the strong stratospheric temperature inversion presently caused by ozone might contribute .",
    "however , without increase in fraction or cloud water path , the forcing will likely be less than 5wm@xmath1 .",
    "the question then naturally arises : how should one model early earth climate",
    "? some would look first towards a  general circulation model ( gcm ) , in order to better represent the dynamics on which clouds depend .",
    "we disagree .",
    "whilst dynamics are certainly important , it is unrealistic to think that in the near future clouds could be _ resolved _ in a  global scale climate model applicable to palaeoclimate . even in models used for anthropogenic global change",
    ", cloud processes are parameterised sub - grid scale .",
    "as one moves towards deep palaeoclimate research , one moves further from the present atmospheric state for which the model may have been designed and can be validated .",
    "a  larger model therefore introduces greater , and harder to track , uncertainty . considering",
    "what radiative forcing or warming a  given mixture of greenhouse gases will impart is a  first - order question , and one which should be answerable with a  first - order model .",
    "a  1-d model is sufficient for this , but clouds must be included .",
    "the appropriate starting point would likely be a model with fixed cloud optical depth and fixed cloud top temperature ( see , for example * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for any proposed change to clouds , very great attention is needed to the feasibility of the mechanism involved . to model these",
    ", one should probably look towards a  cloud microphysics resolving model , coupled to appropriate models of ccn supply and chemistry .",
    "a stronger greenhouse effect likely contributes the largest part of the forcing required to keep early earth warm .",
    "it is important to remember , however , that the forcing from a greenhouse gas depends on the logarithm of its abundance .",
    "thus , a modest forcing from clouds could have a large effect on how much of a greenhouse gas in needed ; indicatively , a 10wm@xmath1 from requires a increase in concentration of a factor of 2 to 3 .",
    "a large atmospheric reservoir ( @xmath56bar ) may be slow to accumulate , as geochemical processes ( principally volcanic outgassing ) contributing linearly to concentration , so any other forcings may be rather useful in resolving the fysp .    in summary , it is necessary to include clouds in climate models if these are to be accurate .",
    "resolution of the faint young sun paradox likely requires a  combination of a  few different warming mechanisms , including strong contributions from one or more greenhouse gases",
    ". changed clouds could contribute warming , but this has yet to be justified  and cooling caused by cloud changes is equally possible .",
    "future work will no doubt propose novel mechanisms to change clouds .",

    "<S> , we comprehensively asses how the radiative properties of clouds , and changes to these , can affect the fysp . </S>",
    "<S> first , we explicitly evaluate how accurate cloud - free calculations of changes in the greenhouse effect are with respect to atmospheres with clouds included . </S>",
    "<S> we do this by considering a  very wide range of cloud properties within a  single global mean atmospheric column , finding a  case study which matches earth s energy budget , then comparing the effect of more greenhouse gas in this column to a  cloud - free calculation . </S>",
    "<S> second , we conduct a  very wide exploration of how changing clouds could directly influence climate . </S>",
    "<S> we vary fraction , thickness , height and particle size of the clouds and vary surface albedo . </S>",
    "<S> we do not advocate any particular set of changes to clouds . </S>",
    "<S> rather , constraints on what direct contribution clouds can make towards resolving the fysp emerges from our wide exploration of the phase space .    </S>",
    "<S> the heyday of clouds in 1-d models was the 1970s and 1980s . </S>",
    "<S> improvements in radiative transfer codes and computational power over the last 30 years allow us to contribute new insight to the problem , in particular by widely exploring phase - space . </S>",
    "<S> nonetheless , these classic papers retain their relevence and are instructive as to how one might treat clouds in such simple models ( e.g. * ? ? ? </S>",
    "<S> * ; * ? ? ? </S>",
    "<S> * ; * ? ? ? </S>",
    "<S> * ; * ? ? ? </S>",
    "<S> * ; * ? ? ? </S>",
    "<S> * ) . </S>",
    "<S> with specific relevance to the fysp , @xcite included clouds in their model of methane and carbon dioxide warming on early earth , and calculated radiative forcings from some changed cloud cases ( our results here agree with this older work ) . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite considered cloud feedbacks for early earth .    </S>",
    "<S> regarding whether a  cloud - free model will correctly calculate the increased greenhouse effect with increases gaseous absorbers , we hypothesise that it will lead to an overestimation in the efficacy of enhanced greenhouse gases . in the absence of clouds , the broadest range of absorption is due to water vapour . </S>",
    "<S> however , whilst water vapour absorbs strongly at shorter and longer wavelengths , it absorbs weakly between 8 and 15 m . </S>",
    "<S> this region of weak absorption is known as the water vapour window . </S>",
    "<S> it is coincident with the wein peak of earth s surface thermal emission at 10 m . </S>",
    "<S> thus the water vapour window permits a  great deal of surface radiation to escape to space unhindered . </S>",
    "<S> other greenhouse gases  and clouds  do absorb here , so are especially important to the greenhouse effect . with clouds absorbing some fraction of the radiation at all wavelengths </S>",
    "<S> , the increase in absorption with increased greenhouse gas concentration would be less than if clouds were absent . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we think that a  cloud - free model would overestimate increased gaseous absorption with increased greenhouse gas abundance and underestimate the greenhouse gas concentrations required to keep early earth warm .    </S>",
    "<S> comparison of cloudy and cloud - free radiative forcings in the context of anthropogenic climate change @xcite supports our hypothesis . for , a  clear - sky calculation overestimates the radiative forcing by 14% . for more exotic greenhouse gases , </S>",
    "<S> which are optically thin at standard conditions ( cfcs , ccs , hcfcs , hfcs , pfcs , bromocarbons , iodocarbons ) , clear - sky calculations overestimate radiative forcing by 2635% . and are intermediate ; their clear - sky radiative forcings are overestimated by 29% and 25% , respectively @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> a  roadmap of our paper is as follows . in sect .  </S>",
    "<S> [ s - methods ] we describe our general methods , verification of the radiative transfer scheme and the atmospheric profile we use . in sect .  </S>",
    "<S> [ s - cloudrep ] we deal specifically with the development of a  case study of three cloud layers representing the present climate and the model sensitivity to this . in sect .  </S>",
    "<S> [ s - kastingeval ] we compare cloudy and cloud - free calculations of the forcing from increased greenhouse gas concentration . in sect .  </S>",
    "<S> [ s - cloudpropvar ] we explore what direct forcing clouds could impart , and in section [ s - fys_resol_eval ] we evaluate the aforementioned cloud - based hypotheses for resolving the fysp . </S>"
