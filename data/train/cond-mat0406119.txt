    "the calculation of the inelastic scattering lifetime of an excited quasiparticle in an electron liquid , due to coulomb interactions , is a fundamental problem in quantum many - body theory . according to the landau theory of fermi liquids  @xcite the inverse lifetime of an electron quasiparticle of energy @xmath0 ( relative to the fermi energy @xmath1 ) at temperature @xmath2 in a three - dimensional ( 3d ) electron liquid",
    "should scale as @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the boltzmann constant . in a two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron",
    "liquid the above dependencies are modified as follows  @xcite : @xmath5    besides its obvious importance for the foundations of the landau theory of fermi liquids  @xcite , the inelastic lifetime also plays a key role in our understanding of certain transport phenomena , such as weak localization in disordered metals . in this case",
    ", the distance an electron diffuses during its inelastic lifetime provides the natural upper cutoff for the scaling of the conductance , and thus determines the low - temperature behavior of the latter  @xcite .    during the past decade some newly developed experimental techniques , combined with the ability to produce high - purity 2d electron liquids in semiconductor quantum wells have enabled experimentalists to attempt for the first time a direct determination of the intrinsic quasiparticle lifetime , i.e. , the lifetime that arises purely from coulomb interactions in a low - temperature , clean electron liquid  @xcite . in refs .",
    "@xcite , for example , the quasiparticle lifetime was extracted directly from the width of the electronic spectral function obtained from a measurement of the tunneling conductance between two quantum wells . in the case of large wells separation , like the ones ( @xmath6 ) studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , the couplings between electrons in different well are weak and can be ignored . for such weakly - coupled wells ,",
    "the lifetime is principally due to interactions among electrons in 2d , while the contribution of the impurities is relatively small .    in spite of these wonderful advances ,",
    "a quantitative comparison between theory and experiment remains very difficult .",
    "there are several reasons for this to be so .",
    "first of all , the 2d samples studied in the experiments are not yet sufficiently  ideal \" , namely disorder and finite width effects still play a non - negligible role : as a result , the measured lifetimes are typically found to be considerably shorter than the theoretically calculated ones . secondly , the electronic density in these systems falls in a range in which the traditional high - density / weak - coupling approximations  @xcite , are not really justified .",
    "finally , there is still confusing disagreement among various theoretical results in 2d @xcite , even in the random phase approximation ( rpa ) .",
    "this paper is devoted to a critical analysis of the last question , i.e. , specifically , we calculate _ analytically _ the constants of proportionality in the relations  ( [ landauscaling3d ] ) and  ( [ landauscaling2d ] ) in the weak coupling regime , and try to clear up the differences that exist among the results of different published calculations .",
    "one particular aspect of the confusion is the widespread belief that the fermi golden rule calculation of the lifetime , based on the rpa screened interaction , is exact in the high density / weak coupling limit .",
    "in fact , this is only true in 3d , but not in 2d . to our knowledge",
    ", this fact was first recognized by reizer and wilkins  @xcite , who introduced what they called  non golden rule processes \" , i.e. , exchange processes in which the quasiparticle is replaced in the final state by one of the particles of the liquid . in point of truth ,",
    "these processes are still described by the fermi golden rule , provided one recognizes that the initial and final states are slater determinants , rather than single plane wave states . in three dimensions ,",
    "such exchange contributions to the lifetime were calculated ( numerically ) in refs .",
    "@xcite , but they are easily shown to become irrelevant in the high - density limit . in 2d , by contrast , the exchange contribution remains of the same order as the direct contribution even in the high density limit .",
    "reizer and wilkins found the exchange contribution to reduce to @xmath7 of the direct one ( with the opposite sign ) in the high - density limit , while we find it here to be only @xmath8 of the direct contribution in the same limit .",
    "more generally , we give an analytical evaluation of both the  direct \" and the  exchange \" contributions vs density , for boh @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "ii , we provide the general formulas for @xmath11 including exchange processes .",
    "we then devote sect .",
    "iii to the analytical calculation of @xmath11 in 3d ; and sect .",
    "iv to the same calculation in 2d .",
    "the 2d calculation is presented in greater detail in order to explain the origin of the disagreements among the results of previous calculations .",
    "we explain the reason for the much stronger impact of exchange on the lifetime in 2d than in 3d at high density .",

    "we consider an excited quasiparticle with momentum @xmath12 and spin @xmath13 .",
    "its inverse inelastic lifetime due to the electron - electron interaction is a sum of two terms , corresponding to the contributions from the  direct \" and  exchange \" processes , respectively , @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the free - particle energy measured from the chemical potential @xmath16 .",
    "we use ` d ' to denote the  direct \" term , and ` ex ' the  exchange \" term .

    "such screening effects are normally characterized by a screening wave vector @xmath32 . following this practice we approximate @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the fermi wave vector and the bohr radius , respectively . at very low density ,",

    "the remarkable fact is that , at variance with the 3d case , this ratio does not vanish for @xmath110 .",
    "the reason for this difference can be understood as follows . in 3d",
    "a _ typical _ scattering process near the fermi surface , such as the one shown in fig .",
    "1(a ) , involves two particles that are well separated ( by a wave vector of the order of @xmath117 ) in momentum space .",

    "the exchange scattering amplitude , on the other hand , is of the order of @xmath119 for all values of @xmath75 : hence the ratio of @xmath49 to @xmath45 goes as @xmath120 , which vanishes for @xmath110 .",
    "the reason why this argument fails in 2d is that the logarithmic contribution to the inverse lifetime in the high density limit does not arise from typical scattering processes , but rather , from _ special _ ones in which the two colliding particles are very close in momentum space ( see fig .",
    "1(b ) ) : hence the direct and the scattering amplitude are comparable , and give similar contributions to the inverse lifetime .",
    "a careful analysis of the integrals involved shows that in the high density limit , the exchange contribution cancels @xmath8 of the direct contribution to the inverse lifetime .",
    "this result is at variance with that of ref .",
    "@xcite , according to which the exchange contribution cancels @xmath7 of the direct one .",
    "we find that the relation @xmath121 holds only in the low density limit ( see eq .",
