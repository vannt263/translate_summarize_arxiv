    "( @xmath2 ; @xmath3 ) has displayed some of the most rapid x - ray variability observed in a seyfert galaxy ( turner 1999 ; leighly 1999a ) .",
    "its x - ray spectrum is steep and shows a strong `` soft excess '' ( vaughan 1999 ; leighly 1999b ) and its optical spectrum shows narrow  ( fwhm  = 1050 km s@xmath4 ) and strong emission ( remillard et al .",
    "1986 , leighly 1999b ) , characteristic of many ultrasoft seyferts . on the basis of fwhm",
    "is classified as a narrow - line seyfert 1 ( nls1 ) galaxy .",
    "such ultrasoft nls1s are of particular interest because their extreme properties are most likely produced by an extreme value of an underlying physical parameter ( e.g. pounds , done & osborne 1995 ; boller , brandt & fink 1996 ; brandt & boller 1998 ; vaughan 2001 ) .",
    "however , with a few exceptions , their timing and spectral properties proved difficult to study in detail with previous x - ray observatories as a result of e.g. , regular light curve interruptions from earth occultation and limited spectral bandpass .",
    "was observed as part of a guaranteed time programme to study the timing and spectral properties of the x - ray brightest and most prominent ultrasoft nls1s using . in this letter",
    "we report the first results from the epic data and in particular the detection of an unusual spectral feature at around 7  kev .",
    "observed on 2000 october 21 during rev .",
    "0159 for a duration of 46 ks , during which all instruments were operating nominally .",
    "the epic pn camera was operated in full - frame mode , and the two mos cameras were in large - window mode ; all three cameras used the medium filters .",
    "extraction of science products from the observation data files ( odfs ) followed standard procedures using the  science analysis system version 5.1.0 ( sas ) .    the raw mos and pn data were processed to produce calibrated event lists .",
    "unwanted hot , dead or flickering pixels were removed , likewise events due to electronic noise , and event energies were corrected for charge - transfer losses .",
    "the latest available calibration files were used in the processing .",
    "light curves were extracted from these event lists to search for periods of background flaring and showed the background to be stable throughout the duration of the observation .",
    "the total amount of `` good '' exposure time selected was 42688  s for mos1 , 42692  s for mos2 and 38106  s for the pn .",
    "( the pn exposure time includes a correction for out - of - time events in full - frame mode ; strder 2001 ) .",
    "source data were extracted from circular regions of radius 60for the mos data , and radius 35  for the pn .",
    "( the smaller extraction region was used in the pn in order to avoid the ccd chip boundary @xmath5  from the pn aimpoint . )",
    "the total number of counts for the pn is 52377 , for mos1 and mos2 14501 and 14634 , respectively . for the pn camera ,",
    "both source and background regions were taken from inside the area corresponding to the hole in the pn circuit board .",
    "an examination of background images and spectra confirmed that the instrumental fluorescence radiation , especially above 7  kev from cu and ni , is not affecting the source or background spectra .",
    "there are no signs of pile - up in the source region .",
    "events corresponding to patterns 012 were extracted from the mos data .",
    "patterns 04 ( single and double pixel events only ) were used for the pn analysis .",
    "the source spectra were grouped such that each spectral bin contains at least 20 counts and were fitted using the xspec 11.0.1 software package ( arnaud 1996 ) .",
    "the latest publicly available responses were used .",
    "the spectra from the three detectors were fitted simultaneously but with the relative normalisations free to vary .",
    "the quoted errors on the derived best - fitting model parameters correspond to a 90 per cent confidence level for one interesting parameter ( i.e. a @xmath6 criterion ) unless otherwise stated .",
    "values of @xmath7  km s@xmath4 mpc@xmath4 and @xmath8 are assumed throughout , and fit parameters ( specifically edge and line energies ) are quoted for the rest frame of the source .",
    "fig  [ fig : raw_spec ] shows the raw count spectra from the epic cameras .",
    "the broad - band spectrum is steep .",
    "a simple power - law fitted across the entire spectrum gives a slope @xmath9 , but this fit is dominated by the spectrum below 1  kev where the statistics are best .",
    "the most striking spectral feature is the sudden drop by a factor of more than 2 at around 7  kev , visible in both pn and mos spectra ( note that this is a lower limit as the energy resolution of about 180  ev will smear a sharp edge ) .",
    "the width of the feature is not significantly larger than the energy resolution .",
    "the response matrices do not introduce any strong features around the observed energy of this feature , nor do the cosmic or instrumental backgrounds . in the 710  kev range",
    "the source is detected with a significance level of about 20 @xmath10 , therefore the spectral feature is intrinsic to the source .",
    "however , the limited photon statistics above 10 kev do not allow us to constrain the expected recovery of the flux at higher energies .    in the absence of any known systematic effect that could introduce such a feature into the spectrum , the rest of this paper discusses possible physical origins of the feature assuming it to be intrinsic to the source spectrum .",
    "the much higher statistical weight at lower energies ( due to the strong soft excess emission and peak in the epic response at @xmath11  kev ) meant that fits to the full - band spectra were dominated by the soft emission . in order to concentrate on the feature at 7",
    "kev the data below 2 kev were ignored in the following analysis .      the most natural interpretation for a drop in the spectrum at just above 7  kev is as an absorption edge from a large column of neutral iron ( 7.112  kev , henke 1993 ; 7.111  kev , bearden 1964 )",
    "the 210  kev spectrum ( see fig  [ fig : fits ] ) can be adequately parameterized ( @xmath12 ) using a power - law and a deep absorption edge ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "while providing an acceptable fit to the data , this model is unsatisfactory for a number of reasons .",
    "firstly , the 210  kev power - law slope is unusually flat ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "secondly , the steep spectrum below 1  kev suggests there is little ` cold ' absorption above that expected from the galactic column ( @xmath15  @xmath16 ; dickey & lockman 1990 ) .",
    "indeed , the column of cold iron expected from the depth of the putative edge is @xmath17  @xmath16 which corresponds to @xmath18  @xmath16 for solar abundances . at this column density",
    "the spectrum should be _ dominated _ by absorption at low energies ( l shell iron and k shell absorption from lower @xmath19 elements ) , whereas it actually steepens considerably in the soft band .",
    "absorption by ionised material can produce a strong iron  k edge without significant soft x - ray absorption , but the energy of the putative edge suggests the absorber is not strongly ionised .",
    "the edge energy at @xmath20  kev is consistent with the neutral iron  k edge energies given in the literature .",
    "the fluorescent yield for iron is close to 0.34 ( bambynek 1972 ) .",
    "however , there is no strong , narrow 6.4  kev emission line in the epic spectrum ; the 90 per cent upper limit on the photon flux in a narrow 6.4  kev line is @xmath21  photons @xmath16 s@xmath4 ( corresponding to an equivalent width of @xmath22  ev ) .",
    "the estimated photon flux absorbed by the putative edge is @xmath23  photons @xmath16 s@xmath4 . for a spherically symmetric distribution of absorbing material",
    "one expects a ratio of fluorescence line to fe - k absorbed flux approximately equal to the fluorescent yield , modified by the absorption of the 6.4  kev line ( which is about a factor of 2.5 here ) .",
    "the measured ratio ( of line / edge flux ) is @xmath24 , a factor @xmath25 smaller than expected for a spherical distribution .",
    "this suggests that the column density along the line - of - sight is higher than the average surrounding the x - ray source .",
    "the solid angle subtended by the putative absorber , as seen from the x - ray source , is likely to be @xmath26  sr ( but see also section  [ sect : disco ] ) .",
    "the following subsections discuss two alternative spectral models , specifically , partial absorption by neutral material and reflection from ionised material .",
    "one possible explanation for the 210  kev spectral form of is partial covering ( i.e. , a patchy absorber ; holt 1980 ) : the observed spectrum is modified by cold absorption at high energies , while at lower energies a relatively unabsorbed component leaks through .",
    "a partial covering model does provide a good fit to the 210  kev spectrum ( @xmath27 ) , using three absorbed power - laws to explain the flat spectrum while the deep iron  k edge in the most heavily absorbed component explains the 7  kev feature ( see fig  [ fig : fits ] ) . a narrow 6.4  kev iron line is included in the model although , as noted above",
    ", it is only poorly constrained by the data .",
    "the best fitting model parameters are as follows : intrinsic power - law slope @xmath28 , line - of - sight column densities ( and covering fractions ) of @xmath29 ( in units of @xmath30 ) and an iron abundance of about 35 .",
    "partial ionisation of metals could help , but the sharp spectral edge suggests that iron is not strongly ionised and iron l - shell absorption is unavoidable .",
    "the edge energy in the partial covering model is ( 7.10 @xmath31 0.04 ) kev consistent with the energy of the neutral iron k edge . fitting the 0.310 kev spectral energy distribution by adding a black body component ,",
    "does not affect the spectral parameters derived above .",
    "a strong fe edge may be found in the reflected emission from an irradiated accretion disc which is not too highly ionised ( ross , fabian & young 1999 ) .",
    "to investigate if such models can describe these data , the constant - density reflection models of ross & fabian ( 1993 ) were fitted to the 210  kev spectrum .",
    "since the reflected emission may originate close to the central black hole , relativistic blurring was applied to the model during fitting ( using the laor code ; laor 1991 ) .",
    "reflection from ionised material was strongly preferred over neutral reflection ( @xmath32 ) , an iron abundance approximately 3 times solar was needed ( @xmath33 from a solar abundance model ) , and a kerr space - time geometry was preferred over a schwarzschild one ( @xmath34 = 34 , @xmath35= 8.3 gravitational radii ) .",
    "however , a model with a reflection fraction of unity can only give an adequate fit to the data ( @xmath36 ) between 2 and 10  kev , and it can not fully account for the sharp spectral drop at @xmath07  kev . allowing",
    "the reflection fraction to increase to 9 resulted in a steeper continuum ( @xmath37 from 1.54 ) and an improved fit ( @xmath38 ; see fig  [ fig : fits ] ) .",
    "the high value of @xmath39 can be decreased by increasing the iron abundance of the reflector .",
    "the ionisation parameter is @xmath40  erg  cm  s@xmath4 . at this level of ionisation",
    "the reflection - dominated model predicts a strong he - like fe  k@xmath1 line with an equivalent width of 1.8  kev .",
    "this model clearly is not as good at describing the data as the partial covering model .",
    "it is extremely difficult for ionised reflection to account for the depth of the drop at @xmath07  kev without invoking a very extreme fe abundance and/or reflection fraction .",
    "the blue wing of a very strong relativistically broadened and highly redshifted iron k@xmath1 line can produce a drop at 7 kev .",
    "a power - law plus laor line ( rest energy 6.4  kev ) provides a good fit ( @xmath41 ) with an inner disc radius @xmath42 and an underlying power - law slope of @xmath43 .",
    "however , the very high equivalent width ( @xmath44  kev ) required to explain the size of the 7 kev drop is difficult to justify .",
    "alternatively , a reflection spectrum from cold material will contain a neutral iron edge .",
    "fitting with a pexrav model gives a good fit ( @xmath45 ) with a reflection fraction @xmath46 ( essentially just reflection ) and an iron overabundance @xmath47 .",
    "the dominance of the reflected compared to the primary emission , and the weakness of the associated iron k@xmath1 line appear fatal for this interpretation .",
    "fig  [ fig : light_curve ] shows the 0.110  kev epic pn light curve in 200  s bins ( the mos light curves are essentially identical to the pn light curve ) .",
    "the source again showed strong ( factor of @xmath04 change during the observation ) and rapid variability , as previously seen by  ( leighly 1999a ) .",
    "the relatively low apparent luminosity of the source during this observation , @xmath48  erg s@xmath4 , means that the rapid variability translates to a fairly modest rate of change of luminosity .",
    "for example , the rapid rise toward the end of the observation corresponds to a luminosity increase of @xmath49  erg s@xmath50 .",
    "the corresponding radiative efficiency , using the argument of fabian ( 1979 ) , is only @xmath51 per cent .",
    "light curves in various energy bands were analysed to search for spectral variability .",
    "the variations in each band appear very similar .",
    "the fractional variability amplitude @xmath52 ( see edelson 2001 ) was measured in different energy bands ( fig  [ fig : rms_spec ] ) using light curves binned to 1000  s and is consistent with a constant ( fractional ) variability amplitude . a cross - correlation analysis using the discrete correlation function ( dcf ;",
    "edelson & krolik 1988 ) showed the light curves to be correlated at zero - lag , with no evidence for any time lags .",
    "hardness ratios were also examined to search for spectral variability ( see fig  [ fig : hr ] ) .",
    "these do show spectral variability ( the lower two panels ) but are uncorrelated with flux . as a final check of (",
    "flux - correlated ) spectral variability separate pn spectra were extracted from time intervals when the source flux was below the mean ( `` low flux '' spectrum ) and above the mean ( `` high flux '' spectrum ) .",
    "the ratio of the two spectra ( fig  [ fig : ratio ] ) was consistent with a constant , re - enforcing the claim of no flux - dependent spectral variability .",
    "unfortunately , the limited number of counts above 7  kev ( @xmath53 source counts in the pn ) mitigates against a detailed analysis of the variability of the 7  kev spectral feature .",
    "the  spectrum of has revealed a sharp drop , by a factor @xmath25 in the spectrum at an energy just above 7  kev .",
    "this is to our knowledge the first detection of such a feature in an agn .",
    "the limited statistics and complex continuum mean that the identification of this feature remains ambiguous .",
    "we have considered models involving either partial covering of the x - ray source by cold material , or emission from an ionised accretion disc , but both these explanations have drawbacks .",
    "the energy of the feature is strongly suggestive of absorption by neutral iron .",
    "however , a complex partial covering model is required in order that the soft x - ray spectrum be relatively unaffected by the absorber .",
    "a further implication of the partial covering model is that the underlying power - law is unusually steep ( @xmath54 ) . a similar feature , namely a sharp drop near 7.1  kev with relatively little fluorescence emission ,",
    "was observed in the peculiar x - ray binary cir x-1 ( brandt 1996 ) . in this case",
    "the spectral feature is almost certainly due to partial covering .",
    "an important consequence of the partial covering model is that the unabsorbed x - ray luminosity of is an order of magnitude higher than the observed ( absorbed ) luminosity .",
    "we have calculated the @xmath55 values for the absorbed and unabsorbed fluxes at 2  kev ( the flux density at 2500    is taken from leighly 2000 ) .",
    "the values are @xmath56 ( absorbed x - ray flux ) and @xmath57 ( unabsorbed ) .",
    "this is suggestive of absorption ( see brandt , laor & wills 2000 ; brandt 2001 , figure 3 ) as almost all the objects with @xmath58 suffer from heavy uv and x - ray absorption .",
    "however , there is no evidence for intrinsic absorption in the -stis spectrum of ( leighly 2000 ) .",
    "the ionised disc model including relativistic blurring seems to provide another possibility for the sharp spectral feature .",
    "the blue horn of the relativistically broadened k@xmath1 line emission , combined with the iron edge can produce a drop around 7 kev .",
    "however , there still remain some residuals above 6.8 kev in the observers frame and it appears somewhat surprising that the energy of the feature is almost exactly that of the neutral iron edge .      the simplest configuration for the absorber would involve the absorber completely covering our line of sight , the unabsorbed flux being a scattered component from some other direction .",
    "this scattered component would not then vary rapidly and so would cause spectral variability when combined with the ( variable ) absorbed flux .",
    "if on the other hand the absorber does partially cover the source then it presumably is at most only a few 100 light - seconds in size and its density exceeds @xmath59",
    "photoionization considerations require that the cloud thickness be less than @xmath61  cm , where the distance of a cloud from the nucleus is @xmath62  cm .",
    "the source position , size and spectrum must remain fixed while the flux is rapidly varying in order to avoid strong spectral variability .",
    "these problems are alleviated if the absorbers are close to , or even within , the emission region .",
    "the absorbing clouds must then be very dense to remain cool and therefore held by magnetic fields .",
    "the possible presence of such clouds in agn in general has been discussed by rees ( 1987 ) ; celotti , fabian & rees ( 1992 ) ; kuncic , blackman & rees ( 1996 ) ; kuncic , celotti & rees ( 1997 ) and malzac ( 2001 ) .",
    "brandt & gallagher ( 2000 ) first suggested that such clouds might be particularly relevant for nls1s .",
    "cool gas trapped by the magnetic field is compressed to extreme densities by the high radiation pressure .",
    "clouds and filaments of such cold gas may accompany the active regions above an accretion disc .",
    "this possibility has been investigated using a relativistically - blurred model involving emission and partial covering . in order",
    "that the 7.1  kev feature remains sharp in the model , the inclination must be @xmath63 .",
    "if the absorbing material lies outside the emission region ( say in a toroidal structure at @xmath64  cm ) then only the line - of - sight material affects the spectrum and this constraint is relaxed .",
    "it is interesting to speculate whether the absorbing material is connected with the radiation - driven outflow suggested by leighly ( 2000 ) in , and whether it affects the observed rapid x - ray variability .",
    "clearly it is crucial to search for similar features in other objects . the  spectrum of pg  1211 + 143 ( reeves in prep .",
    ") appears to show a similar drop at @xmath65  kev .",
    "if such features are common in other objects , this will further constrain the range of suitable models .",
    "based on observations obtained with , an esa science mission with instruments and contributions directly funded by esa member states and the usa ( nasa ) .",
