    "the incoherent addition of the cross sections due to all @xmath3 resonances gives smaller cross section ( dot dashed curve ) .",
    "it is equal to 0.11 mb/(gev sr ) at the peak , appearing at the @xmath4 meson mass equal to 720 mev .",
    "whereas , the coherent contribution of all @xmath3 resonances ( solid curve ) enhances the cross section by a factor about 7.82 to 0.86 mb/(gev sr ) .",
    "the peak position in the later case appears at 730 mev in the @xmath4 meson mass distribution spectrum .",
    "the @xmath4 meson nucleon resonance dynamics in the nucleus have been studied through the coherent @xmath10 meson production process in the proton nucleus reaction .",
    "this study shows that the cross section strongly depends upon the @xmath4 meson - nucleon - resonance coupling constant .",
    "it also depends on various other quantities , such as the spin - isospin transition factor and the hadron parameters for the resonance .... etc .",
    "the cross sections arising due to @xmath1 wave @xmath3 resonances are larger than those due to @xmath0 wave @xmath3 resonances . amongst the @xmath0 wave resonances , the largest cross section originates distinctly due to @xmath6 resonance .",
    "the relativistic results are qualitatively similar to the non - relativistic results in the case of @xmath0 wave @xmath3 resonances .",
    "the relativistic calculation for these resonances gives larger cross sections .",
    "these features are opposite in the case of @xmath1 wave @xmath3 resonances dynamics .",
    "the coherent contribution of all resonances enhances the cross section drastically over that due to incoherent contribution .",
