    "if a three - phonon amplitude is included , we describe @xmath77 with high accuracy ( e.g. , correct up to terms of order @xmath78 near the continuum edge and up to terms of order @xmath79 for the small-@xmath2 behaviour )",
    ". this would be enough for reasonable estimates in the weak coupling regime .",
    "the only problem is that the numerical job becomes time consuming and could be done only for the case @xmath49 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    to conclude this section we mention a qualitatively different behavior of the dispersion curves for @xmath80 and @xmath15 .",
    "the continuum edge is an asymptote for @xmath80 , and is approximated from below as @xmath81 , whereas for @xmath15 the dispersion does meet the edge at a finite value of @xmath82 , which depends on @xmath0 ( see refs .",

    "it is well known that intermediate values @xmath38 and even larger can be tackled within conventional raleigh - schrdinger perturbations .",
    "this becomes possible because the coefficients @xmath95 in the expansion @xmath96 of the polaron ground - state energy decrease very fast with @xmath97 so that the expansion is performed , roughly speaking , in powers of @xmath98 or so .",
    "one can notice this tendency ( although it is not proved rigorously ) looking at eq .",
    "( [ eq - perturb ] ) .",
    "the famous feynman approximation @xcite clearly demonstrates this property as it follows from our calculations @xcite of first twelve ( sic ! ) coefficients of the weak - coupling expansion for the 3d - polaron . besides",
    ", the radius of convergence @xmath99 of the rspt for the bulk polaron ground - state energy was estimated in a number of papers : larsen @xcite found @xmath100 , klochikhin @xcite argued that @xmath101 , our estimate @xcite gave @xmath102 .",
    "anyway , this explains why the weak coupling expansion can be applied for intermediate values @xmath103 or even larger . on the other hand , our lower bound gives very poor results for the intermediate coupling .",
    "in addition , the two - phonon approximation works not so well at these values of the coupling constant @xmath0 .",
    "the reason is that the edge point @xmath104 is then calculated within the one - phonon approximation , which is certainly not enough to reach appropriate accuracy .",
    "taking as an example 1d - polaron , @xmath105 is defined as @xmath83 of eq .",
    "( [ 1d-1phonon ] ) at @xmath36 : @xmath106 expanding @xmath105 in powers of @xmath107 we obtain @xmath108 . here",
    "the second order coefficient is positive and equals one - half , while in the correct result @xcite @xmath109 it is small ( -0.06 ) and negative . from the point of view of diagrammatic technique for polarons@xcite",
    "it means that only the disconnected feynman diagram is taken into account in the one - phonon approximation . in this approximation",
    "the contribution of two connected diagrams is skipped which otherwise would compensate rather a large positive coefficient to give a small negative residue -0.06 .",
    "an analogous fine tuning happens for flat ( @xmath47 ) and bulk ( @xmath15 ) polarons as well .",
    "this explains why one needs to include three - phonon amplitudes to describe not only weak couplings but also intermediate values @xmath38 .",
    "however , as was mentioned earlier , three - phonon calculations can be performed only in @xmath49 , and the numerical job becomes enormous in other spatial dimensions .",
    "so we propose now a simple formula to fit the exact dispersion curves .",
    "we demonstrate its validity for @xmath49 by the comparison with the three - phonon approximation .",
    "in other sections of the current paper the fitting formula will be used instead of the absent numerical three - phonon calculations .",
    "let us stress that we are not going to proceed to the strong - coupling limit .",
    "we are still dealing with the weak couplings and our goal is to restore what is lost in approximations with partial summation of the perturbation series , that is to regain a possibility to use the weak - coupling results for the intermediate values of @xmath0 .",
    "we start with the first term of the brillouin - wigner perturbation series ( [ 1d-1phonon ] ) which reproduces the general behavior of the dispersion curve . as we already know , its main disadvantage is the lack of accuracy , especially in calculating the value of the continuum edge .",
    "thus , we propose to remedy this weak point introducing correction terms `` by hand '' .",
    "first of all , we replace the first order expression for the ground - state energy ( which equals @xmath110 in this case ) by its exact value @xmath19 .",
    "then we also replace the approximate edge point which is unity by its exact value @xmath111 in the propagator of the r.h.s . of eq .",
    "( [ 1d-1phonon ] ) .",
    "note that actually this step is not an approximation : the energy can be arbitrarily shifted in the denominators of the brillouin - wigner expansion , as was mentioned in ref .",
    "this allows us to keep the correct gap between the zone s bottom and the edge point .",
    "finally , we scale the total momentum @xmath2 by the factor @xmath112 to obtain the correct effective mass behavior of the type @xmath113 at small @xmath2 . this way we arrive at our fitting formula : @xmath114",
    "later we apply a similar procedure to the cases @xmath115 .    at small @xmath2 the correct parabolic behaviour",
    "is guaranteed by the very construction of eq .",
    "( [ interp1d ] ) .",
    "when @xmath2 is large it leads to the asymptotic behaviour @xmath116 thus , the dispersion curve approaches the correct continuum edge rather fast .",
    "the exact expressions for the polaron ground - state energy @xmath19 and its effective mass @xmath117 are unknown but they can be calculated numerically with the help of the perturbation series .",
    "the first two terms of the latter were found in ref .",

    "@xcite which appears to be equivalent to the one - phonon tamm - dancoff approximation @xcite .",
    "previously , this approximation was used for polarons in @xmath115 ( the discussion and references will be given later ) . with these ideas",
    "being applied to the polaron in 1d , we obtain the following expression : @xmath120 in comparison with our eq .",

    "[ fig1a ] .    comparing with the three - phonon calculation",
    "one can notice that our fitting curve provides us with an excellent result which is also better than the tamm - dancoff approximation .",
    "this is not surprising because we used in our construction the rspt expansions to rather high orders which work quite well for the intermediate values of @xmath0 .",
