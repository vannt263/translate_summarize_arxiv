    "a network is an abstract entity consisting of a certain number of nodes connected by links or edges .",
    "the number of nodes that can be reached from a reference node @xmath4 in one step is called its degree denoted by @xmath5 . if equal number of nodes can be reached in one step from all the nodes , the network is said to be regular or homogeneous .",
    "a regular lattice where nodes are associated with fixed locations in space and each node connected to equal number of nearest neighbours , is an example of a regular network .",
    "however , in the general context of complex networks , it is defined in an abstract space with a set of nodes @xmath6 and a set of links denoted by @xmath7 . as the spectrum of @xmath8 values of the nodes increases ,",
    "the network becomes more and more irregular and complex . over the last two decades",
    ", the study of such complex networks has developed into a major field of inter - disciplinary research spanning across mathematics , physics , biology and social sciences @xcite .",
    "many real world structures @xcite and interactions @xcite can be modeled using the underlying principles of complex networks and analysed using the associated network measures @xcite . in such contexts ,",
    "the corresponding complex network can be weighted @xcite or unweighted and directed @xcite or undirected depending on the system or interaction it represents . in this paper , we restrict ourselves to unweighted and undirected networks and the possible extensions for weighted and directed networks are discussed in the end .",
    "the topology or structure of a complex network is determined by the manner in which the nodes are connected in the network .",
    "for example , in the case of the classical random graphs ( rg ) of erds and r ' enyi ( e - r ) @xcite , two nodes are connected with a constant and random probability @xmath2 . in contrast , many real world networks are found to have a tree structure with the network being a combination of small number of _ hubs _ on to which large number of individual nodes are connected @xcite .",
    "an important measure that distinguishes between different topologies of complex networks is the degree distribution @xmath9 that determines how many nodes in the network have a given degree @xmath8 . for the rgs",
    ", @xmath9 is a poisson distribution around the average degree @xmath10 @xcite while many real world networks follow a fat - tailed power law distribution given by @xmath11 , with the value of @xmath3 typically between 1 and 3 @xcite .",
    "such networks are called _ scale free _ ( sf ) @xcite due to the inherent scale invariance of the distribution .    though topology is an important aspect of a complex network , that alone is not sufficient to characterize and compare the interactions that are so vast and diverse .",
    "a number of other statistical measures have been developed for this purpose , each of them being useful in different contexts .",
    "two such commonly used quantifiers are the clustering coefficient ( cc ) and the characteristic path length ( cpl ) .",
    "there are also characteristic properties of local structure used to compare the complexity of networks in particular cases , such as , the hierarchy or community structure @xcite in social networks and motifs @xcite and super family profiles @xcite in genetic and neuronal networks . however , a single index that can quantify the diversity of connections between nodes in networks even with different topologies , is the heterogeneity measure @xcite .",
    "it is also indicative , in many cases , of how stable and robust @xcite a network is with respect to perturbations from various external parameters .",
    "an important example is the technological network of north american power grid @xcite .",
    "recent studies have also revealed the significance of the heterogeneity measure in various other contexts , such as , epidemic spreading @xcite , traffic dynamics in networks @xcite and network synchronization @xcite .",
    "the network heterogeneity has been defined in various ways in the literature which we will discuss in detail in the next section where , we will also present the motivations and need for a new measure . while all the existing measures are based on the degree correlations @xmath5 and @xmath12 of nodes @xmath4 and @xmath13 in the network , the measure proposed in this paper uses only the degree distribution @xmath9 to compute the heterogeneity of the network .",
    "however , we show that this new measure varies directly with the @xmath8 spectrum , or the spectrum of @xmath8 values in the network , and hence gives a true representation of the diversity of node degrees present in the network . in other words , it serves as a single index to quantify the node diversity in the network .    in this work",
    ", we also include a class of networks not considered so far in the context of heterogeneity measure in any of the previous works .",
    "these are complex networks constructed from the time series of chaotic dynamical systems , called recurrence networks @xcite .",
    "they have a wide range of practical applications @xcite and the measures from these networks are used to characterize strange attractors in state space , typical of chaotic dynamical systems , as discussed in  v. the diversity of node degrees in",
    "the rns was actually one of the motivations for us to search for a heterogeneity measure that could be used to compare the structural complexities of different chaotic attractors through the construction of rns .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in the next section , we discuss briefly all the previous measures of heterogeneity and give reasons why we have to look for a new measure .",
    "the measure that we propose is based on the idea of what we consider as a completely heterogeneous network of @xmath1 nodes , that is illustrated in  iii .",
    "the proposed measure of heterogeneity is presented in ",
    "iv while  v and  vi are devoted to computation of this new measure for various synthetic as well as real world networks .",
    "our conclusions are summarised in ",
    "if we carefully analyze the heterogeneity measures proposed in the literature , it becomes clear that two different aspects of a complex network can be quantified through a heterogeneity measure .",
    "they are the diversity in node degrees and the diversity in the structure of the network .",
    "for example , the initial attempts to measure the heterogeneity try to capture the diversity in the node degrees of the network and were mainly motivated by the random graph theory .",
    "the first person to propose a measure of heterogeneity was snijders @xcite in the context of social networks and it was modified by bell @xcite as the variance of node degrees : @xmath14 where @xmath10 represents the average degree in the network .",
    "though this is still one of the popular measures of heterogeneity , its applicability is mainly limited to rgs where one can effectively define an average @xmath8 .",
    "another measure was proposed by albertson @xcite as : @xmath15 which is a sum of the local differences in the node degrees in the network .",
    "this index also is not completely adequate in quantifying correctly the heterogeneity of networks with different topologies .",
    "apart from the above two measures defined in the context of social networks , another measure @xcite has recently been proposed to quantify the degree heterogeneity .",
    "it uses a measure of inequality of a distribution , called the gini coefficient @xcite , which is widely used in economics to describe the inequality of wealth . here",
    "a heterogeneity curve is generated using the ratio of cumulative percentage of the total degree of nodes to the cumulative percentage of the number of nodes .",
    "the heterogeneity index is then measured as the degree inequality in a network .",
    "though the authors compute heterogeneity of several standard exponential and power law networks , the measure turns out to be very complicated and works mainly for networks of large size with @xmath16 . in short ,",
    "none of these measures , though useful in particular contexts , truly reflects heterogeneity as represented by the diversity of node degrees in a network .",
    "a comparative study of the above heterogeneity measures has been done by badham @xcite .",
    "the second aspect of heterogeneity discussed in the literature is the topological or structural heterogeneity possible in a complex network which is especially important in real world networks .",
    "an example for this is the measure proposed by estrada @xcite recently , given by    @xmath17    which can also be normalised to get a measure @xmath18 within the unit interval @xmath0 $ ] as :    @xmath19    a comparison of the completely heterogeneous networks ( see text ) with @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 . in each case , all the possible @xmath8 - values from @xmath24 to @xmath25 are present in the network as shown .",
    "one degree ( one @xmath8 value ) has to be shared by two nodes since the @xmath26 node will have the degree of any one of other nodes .",
    "it is empirically shown that this degree of @xmath26 node , denoted by @xmath27 , is automatically fixed ( if the network has all possible degrees from @xmath24 to @xmath25 ) and is @xmath28 if @xmath1 is even and @xmath29 if @xmath1 is odd .",
    "for example , for @xmath20 and @xmath21 , @xmath30 and for @xmath31 and @xmath23 , @xmath32 and so on . ]    change in the degree distribution for a typical complex network as it is transformed from complete homogeneity to complete heterogeneity , for @xmath33 . ]",
    "if we analyse this measure closely , we find that it is basically different with respect to the earlier measures .",
    "the reason is that the measure proposed by estrada is based on the randic index @xcite given by    @xmath34    now , the randic index was originally proposed @xcite as a topological index under the name _ branching index _ to measure the branching of carbon atom skeletons of saturated hydrocarbons . this index is so designed to get extremum value for the `` star '' structure which is the most heterogeneous branching structure and is bounded by values given by    @xmath35    with the limiting values for the star structure and a regular lattice . to be specific",
    ", estrada defines heterogeneity through an irregularity index for each pair of nodes @xmath36 , where @xmath37 if @xmath38 and @xmath39 for @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "it is obvious that a measure based on this definition will be maximum for a `` star network '' of @xmath1 nodes compared to all other networks since there are @xmath25 connections with @xmath36 having maximum value .",
    "the above discussion makes it clear that estrada s measure elegantly captures the structural aspect of heterogeneity associated with a complex network .",
    "this is also evident in the results given by the author .",
    "out of all possible branching structures , the heterogeneity is maximum for the star structure . while the star network has @xmath42 , the values for networks with other topologies are much less with a typical sf network having @xmath43 .",
    "this measure is important in the context of real world networks with different topology and structure and can be used to classify such networks as shown by estrada .",
    "our focus here is the heterogeneity associated with the diversity in node degrees ( analogous to the earlier attempts of heterogeneity ) to propose a measure applicable to networks of all topologies .",
    "an important difference is that we use the frequencies of the node degrees , rather than @xmath5 directly , to define this measure .",
    "we show that , as the spectrum of @xmath8 values in the network increases , the value of the measure also increases correspondingly .",
    "we call the measure proposed here _ degree heterogeneity _ in order to distinguish it from the measure in @xcite . also , the two measures capture complimentary features of heterogeneity in a complex network",
    ". a network having high heterogeneity in one measure may not be so in the other measure and vice versa .",
    "for example , the star network is nearly homogeneous in our definition of heterogeneity , as shown below .",
    "it is also possible to correlate the robustness or stability of a network with the measure proposed here , with the sf networks having comparatively high value of heterogeneity . on the other hand ,",
    "the star network is most vulnerable since disruption of just one node can destroy the entire network . to define the new measure",
    ", we require a network with a limiting value of heterogeneity to play a role similar to that of star network in the earlier measure .",
    "this network is presented in the next section .",
    "finally , the heterogeneity measure that we define below can be shown to have direct correspondence with the entropy measure of a complex network @xcite , characterized by the standard shannon s measure of information @xmath44 .",
    "in particular , this measure can be so adjusted to get the value zero for completely homogeneous networks and the value @xmath45 for the completely heterogeneous case as defined by us in this work .",
    "though there are attempts to represent heterogeneity through entropy @xcite , we prefer to view the two measures as two sperate aspects of a complex network .",
    "entropy is usually associated with the rate at which a process or system ( evolving ) generates information . in the case of a network ,",
    "each node can be considered as an information hub and links as channels for dissipating information . for the completely homogeneous network ,",
    "no new information is generated while it tends to be maximum when the diversity in the node degrees is maximum . in this sense ,",
    "entropy and heterogeneity are closely related and both have values normalized in the interval @xmath0 $ ] . however , while entropy is a dynamic measure , heterogeneity is basically a static measure characterizing the structure and diversity of connections between the nodes and not directly concerned with the information transfer .",
    "that is why traditionally the two measures have been treated seperately , though the values of both for the extreme cases can be made identical .",
    "moreover , the measure that we propose below has the following advantages :    \\i ) only the degree distribution of the network is required to compute the heterogeneity in contrast to all the previous measures proposed so far .",
    "\\ii ) the specific condition that we apply for the completely heterogeneous network provides analytical values for heterogeneity in terms of network size .",
    "\\iii ) based on the proposed measure , we are able to give a structural characterization index for a chaotic attractor through the construction of a complex network called recurrence network .",
    "here we present what we consider as the logical limit of a completely heterogeneous network of @xmath1 nodes .",
    "the reader may find that this is an ideal case .",
    "nevertheless , it helps to put the concept of heterogeneity of a complex network in a proper perspective . consider an unweighted and undirected complex network of @xmath1 nodes , with all the nodes connected to the network having a degree of at least one . if all the nodes have the same degree @xmath8 , the network is completely homogeneous with the degree distribution @xmath9 being a @xmath46 peaked at @xmath8 .",
    "let us now consider the other extreme where no two nodes have the same degree .",
    "the maximum possible degree for a node is @xmath25 .",
    "let the nodes be arranged in the ascending order of their degree .",
    "it is obvious that the @xmath26 node will have to take a degree equal to that of any one of the other nodes having degree from 1 to @xmath25 . to find out what degree is possible for the @xmath26 node under the given condition",
    ", we start with taking small number of nodes as shown in fig .",
    "[ f.1 ] , where we show @xmath47 different cases of @xmath1 ranging from @xmath47 to @xmath23 . in each case",
    ", the @xmath26 node is represented as a _ pentagon shape _ with its degree denoted as @xmath27 .",
    "it is clear that if all the node degrees are to be different , there is only one possible value of @xmath27 for the @xmath26 node , which is @xmath48 if @xmath1 is even and @xmath49 if @xmath1 is odd .    a snapshot of different types of complex networks in the increasing order of their heterogeneity(@xmath50 ) , taking @xmath51 in all cases . from top to bottom , the nature of the network varies from completely homogeneous , star , rg , sf and finally to completely heterogeneous network .",
    "the degree distribution and @xmath8 spectrum are also shown for each case to indicate that @xmath50 is a measure of the diversity in the node degrees . ]",
    "we now give a simple argument that this result is true in general for any @xmath1 .",
    "the degree of node 1 is @xmath24 which means that it is connected only to the node with degree @xmath25 .",
    "that is , node 1 is not connected to @xmath26 node .",
    "node 2 is connected only to two nodes with degree @xmath25 and @xmath52 and hence it is also not connected to node @xmath1 . by induction , one can easily show that the @xmath53 node is connected only to nodes with degree @xmath25 , @xmath52, ....... @xmath54 .",
    "suppose @xmath1 is even .",
    "when @xmath55 , this node is connected to nodes with degree from @xmath25 to @xmath48 . to avoid self loop , this node should be connected to node @xmath1 .",
    "thus all nodes with higher degree from @xmath48 to @xmath25 are connected to node @xmath1 whose degree becomes @xmath48 . by a similar argument",
    ", one can show that the degree of @xmath26 node is @xmath49 if @xmath1 is odd .",
    "let us now consider the degree distribution @xmath9 of this completely heterogeneous network .",
    "all the nodes have different @xmath8 values and only two nodes share the same @xmath8 value , @xmath27 .",
    "one can easily show that : @xmath56 our definition of heterogeneity is derived in such a way that this network has maximum heterogeneity , which is done in the next section .",
    "it is very well accepted that a network of @xmath1 nodes with all nodes having equal degree @xmath8 is a completely homogeneous network with @xmath9 being a @xmath46 centered at @xmath8 .",
    "the value of @xmath8 can be anything in the range @xmath57 and all these networks have heterogeneity measure zero , for any @xmath1 . in principle , the heterogeneity of a network should measure the diversity in the node degrees with respect to a completely homogeneous network of same number of nodes .",
    "all the measures defined so far in the literature directly use the @xmath8 values present in the network for computing the heterogeneity measure . here",
    "we argue that a much better candidate to define such a measure is @xmath9 rather than @xmath8 . since @xmath9 is a probability distribution , as the spectrum of @xmath8 values increase , the value of @xmath9 gets shared between more and more nodes with the condition @xmath58 . in other words ,",
    "this variation in @xmath9 reflects the diversity of node degrees and hence the heterogeneity of the network . a typical variation of @xmath9 as the network changes from complete homogeneity to complete heterogeneity",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "note that for rgs , this variation in @xmath9 is with respect to @xmath59 , with @xmath10 being the average degree , while for sf networks , it is with respect to @xmath60 .    to get the heterogeneity measure",
    ", we first define a heterogeneity index @xmath61 for a network of @xmath1 nodes as the variance of @xmath9 with respect to the peak value corresponding to the completely homogeneous case : @xmath62 the condition implies that the summation is only over @xmath8 values for which @xmath63 . for a completely homogeneous network ,",

    "we note the following features regarding @xmath50 :    \\i ) it is defined here for unweighted and undirected complex networks and represents a unique measure applicable to any network independent of the topology or degree distribution and increases with the diversity in the node degrees .",
    "\\ii ) however , certain topologies have inherent limitations in diversity . for example",
    ", @xmath50 for a star network is very close to zero and hence the star network is nearly homogeneous in our definition .",
    "this is because , in the star topology , the degree of only one node is different from the rest of the nodes .",
    "\\iii ) since we use the counts of the node degrees rather than directly @xmath5 to find @xmath50 , we can not express the measure in terms of the elements of the laplacian matrix , as some authors have done .",

    "this is especially important for real world networks where @xmath1 varies from one network to another , as discussed in  vi .",
    "however , a network with larger @xmath1 generally tends to have lower @xmath50 since , to keep the same heterogeneity , the range of non zero @xmath8 values should also increase correspondingly . in other words ,",
    "a network with @xmath80 nodes attains complete heterogeneity if the @xmath8 values range from @xmath24 to @xmath81 whereas , to attain complete heterogeneity for a network of @xmath82 nodes , the @xmath8 values should range from @xmath24 to @xmath83 .",
    "the above result also implies that for any network that is evolving or growing , for example the sf network where the nodes are added with preferential attachment @xcite , the value of @xmath50 generally keeps on decreasing with increasing @xmath1 . in the next section",

    "the effect of changing @xmath2 for a fixed @xmath1 as well as changing @xmath1 for a fixed @xmath2 are to shift the average @xmath8 value of the nodes in the rg .",
    "since the degree distribution is approximately gaussian for large @xmath1 , the spectrum of @xmath8 values depends directly on the variance of the gaussian profile . as @xmath2 increases from zero for a fixed @xmath1 , the spectrum of @xmath8 values and hence @xmath50 increase correspondingly .",
    "due to the obvious symmetry of the network with respect to the transformation @xmath86 , as @xmath2 increases beyond @xmath87 , @xmath50 starts decreasing .",

    "the resulting complex network is the rn which , by construction , is an unweighted and undirected network .",
    "the adjacency matrix @xmath111 of the rn is a binary symmetric matrix with elements @xmath112 ( if nodes @xmath4 and @xmath13 are connected ) and @xmath113 ( otherwise ) .",
    "more details regarding the construction of the rn can be found elsewhere @xcite .",
    "here we follow the general framework recently proposed by us @xcite to construct the rn from time series .",
    "top panel shows the variation of @xmath50 with @xmath1 for rns constructed from lorenz ( filled triangle ) and henon ( filled circle ) attractor time series .",
    "bottom panel shows the variation of @xmath50 with @xmath108 for fixed @xmath1 for lorenz ( filled triangle ) and duffing ( filled circle ) attractors . in both graphs ,",
    "the error bar comes from the standard deviation of values for @xmath50 computed from time series with ten different initial conditions . ]    for generating the time series , we use the equations and the parameter values given in @xcite for all chaotic systems . for continuous systems ,",
    "we have used the sampling rate @xmath114 for generating the time series .",
    "the time delay used for embedding is the first minimum of the autocorrelation .",
    "we first study how the value of @xmath50 varies with the number of nodes @xmath1 for rns . in fig .",
    "[ f.8 ] ( top panel ) , we show the results for the lorenz attractor and the henon attractor .",
    "it is evident that for large value of @xmath1 , @xmath50 converges to a finite value . we have checked and verified that this is true for other low dimensional chaotic attractors as well .",
    "it is found that once the basic structure of the attractor is formed , the value of @xmath50 remains independent for further increase in @xmath1 .",
    "in other words , the range of @xmath8 values increases with @xmath1 to keep the value of @xmath50 approximately constant .",
    "this result also follows from the statistical invariance of the degree distribution of the rn as has already been shown @xcite .",
    "next , we consider the variation of @xmath50 with embedding dimension @xmath108 .",
    "this is also shown in fig .",
    "[ f.8 ] ( bottom panel ) for two standard chaotic attractors .",
    "it is clear that the value of @xmath50 converges for @xmath115 in both cases .",
    "this is because , the fractal dimension of both these attractors are @xmath116 .",
    "we have already shown @xcite that the degree distribution of the rn from any chaotic attractor converges beyond the actual dimension of the system .",
    "thus , @xmath50 turns out to be a unique measure for any chaotic attractor independent of both @xmath108 and @xmath1 .    from the construction of rns ,",
    "the range of connection between two nodes is limited by the recurrence threshold @xmath110 .",
    "hence the degree of a node in the rn and the probability density around the corresponding point over the attractor are directly related .",
    "for example , for the rn from a random time series , every node has degree close to the average value @xmath10 since the probability density over the attractor is approximately the same .",
    "one can show that the degree distribution of the rn from a random time series is gaussian for large @xmath1 .",
    "thus , the @xmath8 spectrum of the rn is indicative of the range in the probability density variations over the attractor , which in turn , is characteristic of the structural complexity of the attractor .",
    "we have already shown that the measure @xmath50 proposed here is indicative of the diversity in the @xmath8 spectrum . moreover",
    ", it is found to have a specific value for a given attractor independent of @xmath108 and @xmath1 .",
    "it is well known that the statistical measures derived from the rns characterize the structural properties of the corresponding chaotic attractor . in particular , since every point on the attractor is converted to a node in the rn and the local variation in the node degree is a manifestation of the variation in the local probability density over the attractor , the measure @xmath50 can serve as a single index to quantify the structural complexity of a chaotic attractor through rn construction . in table",
    "i , we compare the values of @xmath50 for rns constructed from several standard chaotic attractors . in all cases ,",
    "the saturated value of @xmath50 converged upto @xmath117 is shown . in each case , ten different rns are constructed changing the initial conditions and the average is shown with standard deviation as the error bar .",
    "the results indicate that that among the continuous systems compared , the lorenz attractor is structurally the most complex while in the case of 2d discrete systems , lozi attractor is found to be the most diverse in terms of the probability density variations .",
    "finally , it will also be interesting to see how the value of @xmath50 is affected by adding noise to the chaotic time series . to test this ,",
    "we generate data adding different percentages of noise to lorenz data .",
    "when the value of @xmath50 is computed , it is found that the value reduces systematically with the increase in the noise percentage and approaches the value of noise for a noise level @xmath118 .",
    "this result clearly indicates that the measure will be useful for analysing the real world data .",
    "the value of @xmath50 for random time series with @xmath119 and @xmath120 is found to be @xmath121 . to get a comparison with the values of conventional complex networks , we compute @xmath50 for a rg with @xmath122 that gives the same @xmath10 as that of the rn from random time series and a typical sf network with @xmath123 with @xmath119 in both cases .",
    "the average of ten different simulations is taken .",
    "we find that @xmath124 for the rg which is exactly same as the rn from random time series and @xmath125 for the sf network .",
    ".comparison of @xmath50 for several standard chaotic attractors . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     since we have to restrict to the case of unweighted and undirected networks , we could use only a small subset from the very large variety of real world networks that are mostly weighted or directed . to extend the measure to directed networks , one has to consider the in - degree and out - degree distributions and find the heterogeneity separately . in order to generalise the measure to weighted networks ,",
    "the distribution of the weight or strength of the nodes in the network @xcite , rather than the simple degree distribution is to be considered and define the measure accordingly . for example , for unweighted and undirected networks , all the links are equivalent and hence the degree of @xmath126 node @xmath5 is just the sum of the links connected to node @xmath4 . on the other hand , for weighted networks ,",
    "each link is associated with a weight factor @xmath127 and hence the degree @xmath5 should be generalised to the sum of the weights of all the links attached to node @xmath4 : @xmath128 thus the degree distribution needs to be generalised to the _ strength distribution _ @xmath129 , which is the probability that a given node has a strength equal to @xmath130 @xcite .",
    "the equation for heterogeneity for weighted networks can be modified accordingly .",
    "however , it should be noted that the weight factors are assigned based on different criteria depending on the specific system or interaction the network tries to model .",
    "modifying the measure by incorporating the specific aspects of interaction , the measure itself becomes network specific .",
    "the measure that we propose here is independent of such details and is representative of only the diversity of node degrees in a network , determined completely by the simple degree distribution .",
    "complex networks and the network based quantifiers have become useful tools for the analysis of many real world phenomena .",
    "physical , biological and social interactions are increasingly being modeled and characterized through the language of complex network .",
    "an important measure for the characterization of any complex network is its heterogeneity measured in terms of the diversity of connection reflected through its node degrees . here",
    "we introduce a measure to quantify this diversity which is applicable to networks of different topologies .",
    "this measure is minimum ( equal to zero ) for a completely homogeneous network with all @xmath131 . to get the upper bound for the measure",
    ", we consider the logical limit of heterogeneity possible in a network of @xmath1 nodes where nodes of degree varying from 1 to @xmath25 are present , whose heterogeneity is normalised as 1 .",
    "while considering this network of limiting heterogeneity , we also prove that the degree that is repeated ( or shared by two nodes ) is @xmath28 if @xmath1 is even and @xmath132 if @xmath1 is odd .",
    "also , the measure that we propose here uniquely quantifies the diversity in the node degrees in the network which is characteristic of the type and range of interactions the network represents .",
    "the diversity also depends on the topology of the resulting network .",
    "for example , for rgs , the diversity is limited since most degrees are centered around the average value @xmath10 while the sf networks are comparatively more diverse due to the presence of hubs .",
    "the proposed measure can quantify this diversity in the node degrees irrespective of the topology of the network .    by applying the proposed measure",
    ", we compute the heterogeneity of various unweighted and undirected networks , synthetic as well as real world .",
    "we study numerically how the heterogeneity varies for rg with respect to the two parameters @xmath2 and @xmath1 , while for sf networks the variation of heterogeneity with respect to @xmath3 as well as @xmath1 are analysed . to illustrate the practical relevance of the measure ,",
    "we analyse the rns constructed from the time series of chaotic dynamical systems and highlight its utility as a quantifier to compare the structural complexities of different chaotic attractors .",
    "as has already shown by us @xcite , the nonlinear character and chaotic dynamics underlying the time series can be distinguished from the rns through the usual characteristic measures of complex networks like cc or cpl .",
    "however the subtle differences between the degree distributions of rns from different chaotic systems are not clearly evident from their cc or cpl .",
    "we find these can be quantified uniquely using the proposed measure of degree heterogeneity .",
