    "the vacuum is induced to be a dielectric medium based on overall experimental observations in separate publications @xcite . in this paper",
    "i formally develop the dielectric theory for this dielectric medium , or vacuum dielectrics , with respect to an * empty space * ( or free space) _ the space left over after the removal of the dielectric vacuum_. i will mainly address the questions that , under the influence of an external ( vaculeon ) charge placed in the vacuum , what is the electric polarization of the medium , the depolarization field , the polarization of each individual vacuuon , the local field acting on a vacuuon dipole , and the electric dipole moment of a vacuuon .",
    "these are the basis for expressing the interaction forces and potential energies between an external single vaculeon and its surrounding polarized vacuuons , and between the polarized vacuuons themselves presented in @xcite , and furthermore for expressing the gravitational interaction force between masses@xcite .",
    "this paper is aimed to elucidate the formalism of the vacuum dielectrics mainly ; the detail - filling equations for dipole and local fields for a three - dimensional vacuum , involved directly for obtaining vacuum interaction forces @xcite are left out ; these are given in @xcite .",
    "a large part of the dielectric theory of the vacuum can be formulated in direct analogy to the well - established dielectric theory for ordinary dielectric materials ( see e.g. @xcite , or see @xcite for a brief review ) , given that vacuum is just one specific dielectric medium , and that we have practically based on proposition 1 an explicit internal structure for the constituent vacuuon particles of the vacuum , from which the vacuum polarization and dielectric properties derive .",
    "vacuum is actually a very well behaved dielectric by virtue of its isotropy and nonpolar nature , among others ; although it has also particularities not present with the ordinary dielectric materials as i will discuss when in question .",
    "[ app - diele - vacpol ]    the electric _ polarization _ of an ordinary dielectric medium is defined as the _ dipole moment _",
    "@xmath0 per unit volume , averaged over a macroscopic volume @xmath1 : @xmath2 , with respect to the vacuum .",
    "we similarly define the * electric polarization of the dielectric vacuum * , or the * vacuum polarization * , with respect to the empty space after the removal of the vacuum , over a macroscopic volume @xmath1 as : @xmath3 @xmath4 being the _ electric dipole moment _ of the vacuum in the specified volume @xmath1 . by virtue of its structure proposed in @xcite namely that , briefly , the vacuum consists of neutral but polarizable entities termed vacuuons , the vacuum presents no permanent dipoles . in other terms , the vacuuons have zero electric dipole moment in the absence of an applied field , and the vacuum is thus a _",
    "nonpolar _ dielectric . in the presence of an applied electric field , the n- and",
    "p- vaculeon charges comprising a vacuuon will be displaced relative to each other , into dipole charges ; accordingly the vacuum is produced with an electric polarization .",
    "the n- and p- vaculeons of a vacuuon are bound each other with a binding energy extraordinarily large , estimated @xcite to be 0.5 gev ; therefore normally ( except in a pair production ) they can not be separated .",
    "the vacuum will therefore maintain _ electrically neutral _ even in the presence of applied fields .",
    "hence the electric dipole moment in a macroscopic volume @xmath5 of the vacuum may be obtained by @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the position vector of charge @xmath8 . the subscript @xmath9 labels that a specified quantity , here @xmath4 , pertains to the ( dielectric ) vacuum as opposed to an ordinary ( dielectric ) material medium . with ( [ eq - app - mub ] ) , ( [ eq - app - dielce - x1 ] )",
    "thus writes @xmath10     polarized into a vacuuon dipole of dipole moment @xmath11 , with a displacement @xmath12 between its two charges @xmath13 and @xmath14.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    for two opposite - signed charges ( @xmath15 , @xmath16 ) on a polarized vacuuon @xmath17 , mutually displaced by a distance vector @xmath18 ( figure [ fig - dipole ] ) , equation ( [ eq - app - mub ] ) gives the ( induced ) * electric dipole moment of a vacuuon * : @xmath19     is produced by two parallel plates with free charges @xmath20 and @xmath21 on them , and with a dielectric vacuum medium in between .",
    "the vacuum is regarded explicitly as non - dielectric in ( a ) , and as a dielectric in ( b ) .",

    ", scaledwidth=70.0% ]",
    "consider here a region of the vacuum is subjecting to the influence of a uniform applied field , @xmath32 as measured in the vacuum . with no loss of generality",
    "let this @xmath32 be produced in between two parallel uniformly charged plates ( figure [ fig - dielec ] ) , of equal but opposite - signed free charges , @xmath29 and @xmath21 .",
    "figure [ fig - dielec]a shows the traditional representation where one regards the vacuum as non - dielectric while , as one may recognize , a practically dielectric property is effectively reflected through a parameter , the permittivity of the vacuum .",
    "unless specified otherwise we below regard that _ the vacuum is a dielectric _ ( figure [ fig - dielec]b ) .",
    "suppose we have managed to remove the dielectric vacuum ( i.e. all of the vacuuons composing it ) in a region in question , say in a volume embracing the two parallel charged plates plus a certain vicinity region , and situate ourselves in the _ empty space _ left over as defined earlier .",
    "then , a free charge in it will be @xmath33 if it was @xmath34 when measured in the dielectric vacuum ; and we find by measurement the applied field produced by @xmath33 in this empty space is @xmath35 ( figure [ fig - dielec]c ) .",
    "we now fill in between the charged parallel plates with a piece of dielectric vacuum medium .",
    "the field @xmath35 produced by the free charges on the plates then polarizes the vacuuons constituting the vacuum in between into * induced vacuuon dipoles * , each of an electric dipole moment @xmath36 aligned in the direction of @xmath35 . through the volume between the two plates",
    "the displaced charges from each adjacent vacuuon dipoles are lined up head - to - tail in the direction perpendicular to the plates , and annul one another , giving a net zero charge in the interim of the chosen volume . only on the surface @xmath28 of the enclosure , see figure [ fig - dielec]d , one finds net charges , referred to as * polarization charge * of the vacuum here , @xmath37 , on each face @xmath38 parallel with the plates ; @xmath37 has an opposite sign to the free charge @xmath34 on the plate just beside it .",
    "the formulae of the ordinary form of gauss s law ( for electricity here ) for the vacuum and for an ordinary dielectric material of dielectric constant @xmath39 between the plates , respectively write , @xmath40 with @xmath41 the permittivity of vacuum and @xmath42 polarization charge .",
    "these are expressed by phenomenologically regarding the vacuum as `` non - dielectric '' . in other terms ,",
    "in this form one does not regard the microscopic and dielectric property of the vacuum explicitly .",
    "( see @xcite for a review of the derivation of these and related dielectric relations in terms of directly comparable denotations . )    in analogy to the ordinary form of gauss s law , we now establish the corresponding gauss s law applied to a general dielectric material with respect to the empty space . for illustration",
    "we choose the `` dielectric material '' between the two charged plates to be just the dielectric vacuum itself , as shown in figure [ fig - dielec]b . in a thought experiment",
    "it is easy to remove the vacuum outside the region enclosed between the plates , as in figure [ fig - dielec]d or b , and situate ourselves in the empty space and look at the interface between the vacuum and the empty space , the upper surface @xmath38 here ; on @xmath38 we find the polarization charge to be @xmath37 , as specified earlier . and",
    "we will find by measurement the total charge on @xmath38 is @xmath43 we here do not presume any knowledge of the sign of @xmath44 , but rather leave it to be fixed through applying gauss s law , as by ( [ app - dielec-72 ] ) below .",
    "that is , as viewed in the empty space , @xmath31 is effectively produced by @xmath45 ( the subscript @xmath34 indicates instead the charge as viewed in the vacuum ) , and @xmath35 is produced by @xmath46 ( @xmath47 as we will show below ) .",
    "now with respect to the empty space , with the total charge as given by ( [ eq - app - dielec - qpq ] ) , we apply gauss s law to the gaussian surface @xmath28 enclosing the upper plate : @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the * permittivity of the empty space * ; @xmath31 is now the so - called macroscopic field produced by @xmath33 as measured in the dielectric vacuum .",
    "note that since the empty space has no dielectric property , @xmath49 would merely represent a dimensional conversion factor .",
    "it is straightforward to prove @xcite that ( [ app - dielec-74 ] ) is equivalent to the ordinary form of gauss s law for vacuum , ( [ app - dielec-6]a ) .    since the vacuum is such a particular medium that it extends continuously throughout the space , in reality we can never actually find a real surface separating the vacuum and the empty space , and situate ourselves on the empty - space side of it .",
    "so , whenever making an actual measurement of the charge , we are only doing this in the interim of the vacuum continuum . in it at any point on any specified surface",
    "we make measurement , the polarization charges on its two opposite sides cancel .",
    "consequently in realistic experiments we always measure the true value of the charge as in the empty space .",
    "that is @xmath50",
    "similarly as in the dielectric theory for ordinary materials , we introduce a * dielectric constant of the ( dielectric ) vacuum * , denoted by @xmath51 , with respect here to the empty space .",
    "@xmath51 is defined such that the electric field measured in the dielectric vacuum @xmath31 , in relation to the field measured in the empty space @xmath52 is @xmath53 accordingly the permittivity of the ( dielectric ) vacuum with respect to the empty space , , @xmath51 , and @xmath33 of the dielectric vacuum as measured with respect to the empty space , and also the applied field @xmath54 in the empty space , we have used a subscript @xmath55 to distinguish from their counterparts @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) , @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) and @xmath34 ( @xmath60 numerically but having a distinct physics ) , for a `` non - dielectric vacuum '' with respect to the vacuum itself , and also @xmath61 .",
    "the latter typically take trivial values only but are ordinarily expressed as variables . by this denotation method",
    "all of the variables including @xmath62 , @xmath4 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 for the dielectric vacuum with respect to the empty space should also be suffixed by @xmath55 , as @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 in cases where explicitness is needed .",
    "we have in this text dropped the @xmath55 for the latter variables given that no confusion is being caused . ] in relation to that of the empty space is @xmath77 a basic notion we maintain in the two alternative ( the dielectric and the `` non - dielectric '' ) representations of the vacuum is that , the @xmath31 field as measured in a dielectric vacuum with respect to the empty space , is the same as one as actually measured in the real vacuum .",
    "this must be so since , irrespective of which representation , we have one and the same vacuum and the force per charge ( per unit volume ) as represented by @xmath31 in this vacuum must be of an unique value .",
    "the field produced at @xmath78 by a point charge @xmath34 located at @xmath79 is given by the coulomb s law @xmath80 ; it thus follows that in the latter representation , @xmath81 is the same quantity as that actually measured for the vacuum through the coulomb s law .    since the dielectric vacuum responds to @xmath35 with a depolarization field ( see below ) which cancels a portion of @xmath35 , thus @xmath82 .",
    "combining this inequality with ( [ app - dielec-70 ] ) and in turn the resultant with ( [ app - dielec-71 ] ) we have @xmath83    in further analogy to the dielectric theory for ordinary materials in a `` non - dielectric vacuum '' , we express the polarization charge of the dielectric vacuum in terms of the polarization of the vacuum via a corresponding gauss s law : @xmath84 and we express @xmath85 in relation to @xmath31 through an * electric susceptibility of the dielectric vacuum * , @xmath86 : @xmath87 substituting with ( [ app - dielec-73 ] ) , ( [ app - dielec-72 ] ) writes : @xmath88 substituting ( [ app - dielec-72])@xmath89 into the right - hand side of ( [ app - dielec-74 ] ) , rearranging , we have : @xmath90    the quantity on the right - hand side of ( [ app - dielec-75 ] ) , @xmath91 , is the free charge measured in the empty space . according to the principle of gauss s law applied here to the charge in empty space , the quantity on the left - hand side must amount to the total electric flux produced by the charge @xmath91 .",
    "this corresponds to a so - called electric * displacement vector * of here the dielectric vacuum : @xmath92 so defined such that @xmath93 ( [ app - dielec-74])@xmath89 and ( [ app - dielec-75 ] ) give @xmath94 canceling @xmath95 between ( [ app - dielec-77b]a ) and ( [ app - dielec-77 ] ) further gives @xmath96 substituting into ( [ app - dielec-77b]b ) with ( [ app - dielec-71 ] ) we have @xmath97 . or ,",
    "@xmath98 this gives the dielectric constant of vacuum in relation to susceptibility . substituting with",
    "( [ app - dielec-73 ] ) , ( [ app - dielec-77b]b ) alternatively writes : @xmath99",
    "applying gauss s law for the gaussian surface about the upper charged plate and enclosing @xmath100 only ( figure [ fig - dielec]d ) , we get the * electric polarization field of the vacuum * , produced by the charge displacements of the constituent vacuuons under the influence of the applied field @xmath35 .",
    "that is @xmath101 canceling @xmath102 between ( [ app - dielec-73 ] ) and ( [ app - dielec-17b ] ) gives : @xmath103 @xmath104 is explicitly expressed by ( [ eq - app - efbpol2 ] ) to be antiparallel to @xmath35 and similarly to @xmath31 , and therefore is termed the * depolarization field * of the vacuum . substituting ( [ app - dielec-17b ] ) for @xmath85 into ( [ app - dielec-77b]c )",
    "we have @xmath105 where the last expression used ( [ app - dielec-71 ] ) . from ( [ app - dielec-18 ] )",
    ", we obtain the so - called * macroscopic field * in the dielectric vacuum : @xmath106 this is just the `` applied '' field @xmath31 ( with respect to a `` non - dielectric '' vacuum ) actually as measured in the vacuum ( cf .",

    "the results in this section are the direct dielectric - theoretical basis for the depolarization radiation force considered as a cause of gravity@xcite .",
    "we now represent the dielectric response of the vacuum , under the influence of the applied uniform field @xmath35 , in terms of the individual constituent vacuuons .",
    "@xmath35 polarizes the initially neutral vacuuons into * vacuuon dipoles * aligned in the direction of @xmath35 , each having a dipole charge @xmath107 , charge displacement @xmath12 , and an electric dipole moment @xmath63 expressed earlier in ( [ eq - app - mub ] ) in terms of @xmath12 .",
    "assuming @xmath35 is small so that the resulting charge displacement is linear , accordingly @xmath108 will be in linear proportion to a so - called * local field * , @xmath109 , produced by the applied field at the vacuuon .",
    "that is @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the * polarizability of vacuuon*.    the local field at the site @xmath7 of vacuuon @xmath17 , is given by the sum of the applied field @xmath35 and the total dipole field @xmath112 produced at it by all other vacuuon dipoles from the surrounding .",
    "that is @xmath113    the electric field at @xmath7 as produced by a dipole located at @xmath114 , having an electric moment @xmath115 , is given by the standard equation of electrostatics : @xmath116 where @xmath117 is the distance vector from vacuuon @xmath118 to @xmath17 , @xmath119 for @xmath120 ; or @xmath121 and @xmath122 for @xmath123 . the total electric field at the @xmath17th dipole s location @xmath7 as produced by all the other dipoles , or the * total dipole field * , is the vector sum @xmath124 @xmath125 , and accordingly @xmath68 and @xmath108 are generally dependent on the geometry of the dielectric specimen and the orientation of @xmath52 relative to the specimen .",
