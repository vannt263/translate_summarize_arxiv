    "coupled map lattices ( cmls ) as introduced by kaneko and kapral  @xcite are a paradigm of higher - dimensional dynamical systems exhibiting spatio - temporal chaotic behaviour .",
    "there is a variety of applications for cmls to model hydrodynamical flows , turbulence , chemical reactions , biological systems , and quantum field theories ( see e.g.  reviews in  @xcite ) .",
    "the analysis of chaotic cmls is often restricted to numerical investigations and only a few analytical results are known .",
    "a notable exception is the case of hyperbolic maps ( maps for which the absolute value of the slope of the local maps is always larger than @xmath4 ) for small coupling @xmath1 . in this case",
    "a variety of analytical results exists  @xcite that guarantee the existence of a smooth invariant density and ergodic behaviour .",
    "the situation is much more complicated for non - hyperbolic maps which correspond to the generic case of physical interest . here",
    "much less is known analytically , though some promising steps have been made  @xcite .    in this paper , we present for the first time analytical results corresponding to a non - hyperbolic situation and calculate invariant densities explicitely for the case of locally fully developed chaos that is diffusively coupled .",
    "we study local maps given by @xmath0-th order tchebyscheff polynomials . in the uncoupled case",
    "these maps are conjugated to a bernoulli shift of @xmath0 symbols . in the coupled case ,",
    "this conjugacy is destroyed and the convential treatments for hyperbolic maps does not apply , since the tchebyscheff maps have @xmath5 critical points where the slope vanishes , thus corresponding to a non - hyperbolic situation . from the physical point of view , the non - hyperbolic case is the most interesting one .",
    "for example , it has been shown that these types of non - hyperbolic cmls naturally arise from stochastically quantised scalar field theories in the anti - integrable limit  @xcite .",
    "they can serve as useful models for vacuum fluctuations and dark energy in the universe  @xcite .",
    "other applications include chemical kinetics as described by discretised reaction diffusion dynamics  @xcite .",
    "the case of two coupled tchebyscheff maps was previously studied in  @xcite using periodic orbit theory .",
    "here we consider infinitely many diffusively coupled tchebyscheff maps on one - dimensional lattices with periodic boundary conditions , and apply perron - frobenius and convolution operator techniques .",
    "our analytical techniques will yield explicit perturbative expressions for the invariant 1-point density for small couplings @xmath1 .",
    "we will prove that the density exhibits log - periodic oscillations of period @xmath3 near the edges of the interval .",
    "our explicit result for the invariant density will allow us to calculate expectations of arbitrary local observables",
    ". we will prove that expectations of typical observables scale with @xmath2 ( rather than with @xmath1 as for hyperbolic coupled maps ) .",
    "we also show that there are log - periodic modulations of expectation values when the parameter @xmath1 is changed .",
    "our results seem to be typical for local maps with one or several quadratic maxima which are in a fully developed chaotic state .",
    "other types of maps may of course generate different types of behavior for @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "this paper is organised as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we introduce the relevant class of coupled map lattices and briefly explain their physical relevance . in sec .",
    "iii we give some numerical results for the scaling behaviour of these non - hyperbolic systems . in sec .",
    "iv we present our analytical results for the invariant density which we use to rigorously prove the scaling behaviour .",
    "consider a scalar field @xmath7 described by an equation of the form @xmath8 here @xmath9 is a diffusion constant and @xmath10 is some suitable potential .",
    "these types of equations occur in many different areas of physics .",
    "they describe reaction diffusion systems , ginzburg - landau type of models , nonlinear schrdinger equations , stochastically quantised field theories , etc . in the one - dimensional case the laplacian @xmath11",
    "is just given by @xmath12 .",
    "in many cases there is a fundamental length and time scale below which the above continuum theory is not valid anymore . for example ,",
    "for stochastically quantised field theories this is the planck length  @xcite .",
    "writing @xmath13 , @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are integers , and @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a dimensionless field and @xmath19 is some constant with the same dimension as the field , the discretised eq .",
    "( [ sto2 ] ) can be written in the form @xmath20 where the local map @xmath21 is given by @xmath22 and the dimensionless coupling @xmath1 is given by @xmath23 .",
    "for various applications of these types of coupled map lattices , see  @xcite .",
    "the important point is that generically these types of models can lead to non - hyperbolic local maps @xmath21 .",
    "for example , a @xmath24-theory described by a double well potential @xmath25 with a sufficiently strong quartic term leads to cubic maps with two inflection points where the slope @xmath26 vanishes .",
    "it is thus important to understand the generic behaviour of non - hyperbolic coupled map lattices .",
    "we are particularly interested in cases where the local map exhibits strongest possible chaotic behaviour .",
    "the negative 3rd order tchebyscheff map @xmath27 on the interval @xmath28 $ ] is such an example .",
    "it is conjugated to a bernoulli shift of 3 symbols and can be obtained in our context from the potential @xmath29 in a similar way , one can construct potentials that lead to positive and negative tchebyscheff maps of arbitrary order @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "let us now study cmls of type  ( [ dyn ] ) where @xmath30 is a tchebyscheff map of order @xmath0 .",
    "one observes nontrivial scaling behaviour for small values of the coupling @xmath1 that is significantly different from that of hyperbolic systems .",
    "consider an arbitrary test function @xmath31 of the local iterates .",
    "assuming ergodicity , expectations @xmath32 for a given parameter @xmath1 are numerically calculable as time averages @xmath33 for @xmath6 one numerically observes the scaling behaviour @xmath34 where @xmath35 is a periodic function of @xmath36 with period @xmath3 .",
    "examples are shown in fig .",
    "[ logb1 ] .",
    "the choice @xmath37 is important in the physical applications to estimate the vacuum energy generated by the chaotic field theory under consideration  @xcite .",
    "generally the function @xmath38 $ ] is a functional of the chosen test function @xmath39 .",
    "the above log - periodic scaling is observed for arbitrary test functions @xmath39 and hence is a general property of the invariant 1-point density @xmath40 of the cml for given small couplings @xmath1 .",
    "in fact one observes that there is not only scaling in the parameter space @xmath1 but also in the phase space @xmath41 .",
    "this is shown in fig .",

    "+    near the left edge of the interval @xmath42 $ ] one may write @xmath43 and observe the scaling behaviour @xmath44 where the function @xmath45 is independent of @xmath1 for small @xmath1 . at the right edge , writing @xmath46 , one observes @xmath47 where @xmath48 is independent of @xmath1 for small @xmath1 .",
    "moreover , @xmath48 exhibits log - periodic oscillations @xmath49 over a large region of the phase space ( see fig .",
    "[ peri ] ) .",
    "the number of oscillations is approximately @xmath50 .",
    "for @xmath0 odd the density is symmetric and the behaviour at the left and right edge is the same , whereas for @xmath0 even there is no left - right symmetry .    in the following section we will analytically prove the above numerical observations and provide explicit formulas for the functions @xmath48 and @xmath45 for a given local tchebyscheff map @xmath51 .",
    "our method is based on a perturbative treatment of the perron - frobenius operator of a perturbed local map and on convolution techniques . in a first approximation",
    ", the neighbouring lattice sites can be regarded as producing independent random noise with density @xmath52 .",
    "while this picture works well in the middle of the interval @xmath42 $ ] , in the vicinity of the edges @xmath53 one has to take into account nontrivial nearest neighbour correlations , due to the non - hyperbolicity of the map . a first - order approximation of the density",
    "can then be further iterated to yield results of better precision . in each step",
    "we integrate over 2-point functions describing the joint probability of neighboured lattice sites to obtain the marginal distribution at a single lattice site .",
    "a detailed description of our calculations is out of the scope of a short letter , they will be published elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "our final result is that for @xmath54 one obtains in leading order of @xmath2 at the left edge @xmath55 where @xmath56 at the right edge one obtains by iterating our scheme @xmath57 times @xmath58 where @xmath59 here the function @xmath60 is defined as follows : @xmath61 the limits of the two integrations in eqs .",
    "( [ 15 ] ) and  ( [ 166 ] ) are given by the condition that @xmath62 and that the argument of the square root should always be positive .",
    "a simple way to numerically evaluate our formulas is to replace the double integrals by ergodic averages of iterates of the uncoupled tchebyscheff map .",
    "so for example we may evaluate the density at the left edge as @xmath63 and similar formulas apply to the right edge .",
    "( [ 15 ] ) can also be written as @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind . from the above formula it is obvious that the density is not differentiable at @xmath66 and @xmath67 for arbitrarily small @xmath1 ( compare fig .",
    "[ rho23 ] ) . by iteration of the perron - frobenius operator",
    "one can show that these two non - analytic points generate an entire cascade of such points at the right edge of the interval .",

    "( [ 166 ] ) converges rapidly with increasing @xmath57 . in practice ,",
    "a few terms are sufficient to obtain perfect agreement with the numerical histograms .",
