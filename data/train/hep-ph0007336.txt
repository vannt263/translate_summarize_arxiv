    "the search for higgs bosons will be among the prime tasks of the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) @xcite . while the standard model ( sm ) contains one complex higgs doublet ,",
    "from which one neutral cp - even higgs boson emerges in the physical particle spectrum after the electroweak symmetry breaking , the higgs sector of the minimal supersymmetric extension of the sm ( mssm ) consists of a two - higgs - doublet model ( 2hdm ) and accommodates five physical higgs bosons : the neutral cp - even @xmath1 and @xmath2 bosons , the neutral cp - odd @xmath3 boson , and the charged @xmath4-boson pair . at the tree level , the mssm higgs sector has two free parameters , which are usually taken to be the mass @xmath5 of the @xmath3 boson and the ratio @xmath6 of the vacuum expectation values of the two higgs doublets .",
    "the discovery of the @xmath4 bosons would rule out the sm and , at the same time , give strong support to the mssm .",
    "the main strategies for the @xmath4-boson search at the lhc were summarized in refs .",
    "depending on the @xmath4-boson mass @xmath7 , the dominant mechanism of single @xmath4-boson hadroproduction are @xmath8 followed by @xmath9 @xcite , @xmath10 @xcite , @xmath11 @xcite , and @xmath12 @xcite together with their charge - conjugate counterparts .",
    "the hadroproduction of @xmath13 pairs proceeds at tree the level via @xmath14 annihilation , @xmath15 , where @xmath16 @xcite , and @xmath17 @xcite , and at the one - loop level via @xmath18 fusion , @xmath19 , which is mediated by quark @xcite and squark loops @xcite .",
    "the suppression of the @xmath18-fusion cross section by two powers of the strong - coupling constant @xmath20 relative to the one of @xmath14 annihilation is partly compensated at multi - tev hadron colliders by the overwhelming gluon luminosity .",
    "an interesting alternative is to produce @xmath4 bosons in association with @xmath21 bosons , so that the leptonic decays of the latter may serve as a trigger for the @xmath4-boson search .",
    "the dominant partonic subprocesses of @xmath0 associated production are @xmath22 at the tree level and @xmath23 at one loop , which were investigated for vanishing bottom - quark mass @xmath24 and small values of @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite and recently , without these restrictions , in refs .",
    "@xcite . a careful signal - versus - background analysis , based on the analytic results of ref .",
    "@xcite , was recently reported in ref .",
    "so far , only the quark loop contribution to @xmath23 was considered @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to provide , in analytic form , the supersymmetric contribution to this partonic subprocess , which is induced by virtual squarks through the feynman diagrams depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : one ] .",
    "furthermore , we wish to quantitatively study its influence on the cross section of the inclusive reaction @xmath27 at the lhc .",
    "we recall that , in the case of @xmath28 , the supersymmetric correction to the @xmath18-fusion cross section can be as large as @xmath29 @xcite . _ a priori _ , one expects to encounter a similar situation for @xmath27 .    in order to reduce the number of unknown supersymmetric input parameters , we adopt a scenario where the mssm is embedded in a grand unified theory ( gut ) involving supergravity ( sugra ) @xcite .",
    "the mssm thus constrained is characterized by the following parameters at the gut scale , which come in addition to @xmath25 and @xmath5 : the universal scalar mass @xmath30 , the universal gaugino mass @xmath31 , the trilinear higgs - sfermion coupling @xmath32 , the bilinear higgs coupling @xmath33 , and the higgs - higgsino mass parameter @xmath34 .",
    "notice that @xmath5 is then not an independent parameter anymore , but it is fixed through the renormalization group equation .",
    "the number of parameters can be further reduced by making additional assumptions .",
    "unification of the @xmath35-lepton and @xmath17-quark yukawa couplings at the gut scale leads to a correlation between @xmath36 and @xmath25 . furthermore ,",
    "if the electroweak symmetry is broken radiatively , then @xmath33 and @xmath34 are determined up to the sign of @xmath34 .",
    "finally , it turns out that the mssm parameters are nearly independent of the value of @xmath32 , as long as @xmath37  gev at the gut scale .",

    "[ fig : two](b ) close to @xmath134 may be understood by observing that the average strength of the @xmath135 coupling , which is proportional to @xmath136 , is then minimal @xcite .",
    "as is the quark case @xcite , the squark triangle and box contributions are similar in size and destructively interfere with each other , so that their superposition is much smaller than each of them separately . as in the case of @xmath28 @xcite ,",
    "the bulk of the squark contribution comes from the stop and sbottom squarks , while the contributions from the first- and second - generation squarks is greatly suppressed because their couplings to the higgs bosons are significantly smaller than those of the third - generation squarks and their masses are generally larger than those of lightest stop and sbottom squarks , @xmath137 and @xmath138 .",
    "we conclude that the suppression of the @xmath18-fusion cross section relative to the one of @xmath126 annihilation remains after the inclusion of the squark loop contributions .",
    "it is interesting to find out how the kinematic behavior of the @xmath18-fusion cross section is affected by the supersymmetric correction .",
    "to that end , we study in figs .",
    "[ fig : three](a ) and ( b ) the distributions in the @xmath63-boson transverse momentum @xmath109 and rapidity @xmath108 , respectively , for @xmath124 , 10 , 30 , and @xmath139  gev .",
    "while the @xmath108 distribution does not exhibit any striking features , we observe that the supersymmetric correction leads to an increase of the @xmath109 distribution by more than 50% at large @xmath109 for medium to large @xmath25 .",
    "this can be traced to the presence of absorptive parts in the squark loop contribution .",
    "in fact , if @xmath140 , then @xmath141 , so that pairs of real @xmath142 squarks can be produced .    for a comparison with future experimental data",
    ", the @xmath126-annihilation and @xmath18-fusion channels should be combined . from fig .",
    "[ fig : two](a ) , we read off that the total cross section of @xmath27 at the lhc is predicted to be approximately 500  fb ( 20  fb ) in the considered mssm scenario if @xmath143 and @xmath125  gev ( @xmath124 and @xmath139  gev ) .",
    "if we assume the integrated luminosity per year to be at its design value of @xmath144  fb@xmath145 for each of the two lhc experiments , atlas and cms , then this translates into about 100.000 ( 4.000 ) signal events per year .",
    "we calculated the squark loop contribution to the partonic subprocess @xmath23 within the mssm , and analyzed its impact on the inclusive cross section of @xmath27 and its distributions in transverse momentum and rapidity at the lhc adopting a sugra - inspired scenario . its inclusion may increase or decrease the integrated @xmath18-fusion cross section by up to 10% , depending on the values @xmath25 and @xmath7 .",
    "however , @xmath126 annihilation remains the dominant mechanism of @xmath0 associated hadroproduction at the lhc .",
    "should the mssm be realized in nature , then the @xmath0 channel will provide a copious source of charged higgs bosons at the lhc , with an annual yield of up to 100.000 signal events .",
