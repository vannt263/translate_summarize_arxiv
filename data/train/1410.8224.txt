    "we are interested in the dynamics of an asset price in a limit order market .",
    "we aim at constructing a tractable model which captures endogenously such phenomena observed in actual markets as nonlinearity in liquidation , permanent market impact and a flash crash due to illiquidity .",
    "the liquidity issue has been pointed out as a major risk which standard models of financial engineering have not taken into consideration . the failures of several financial institutions are often attributed to the uncovered liquidity risk .",
    "the liquidity crisis is a rare event ; an exogenous statistical modeling of liquidity costs is therefore not sufficient for preparing ourselves for a future crisis .",
    "an economic consideration is required for a deeper understanding of the liquidity risk .",
    "this paper provides an utility - based asset pricing model with analytically tractable structure .",
    "+ in a limit order market , the roles of supplier and demander of liquidity are not symmetric .",
    "a liquidity supplier submits a _",
    "limit order _ that quotes a price for a specified volume of an asset .",
    "they can trade with each other by using limit orders to maximize their own utilities .",
    "once an equilibrium is achieved , no more trade occurs among them .",
    "however , a liquidity supplier still has an incentive to submit a limit order as long as the corresponding transaction improves her utility .",
    "the remained limit orders form a price curve which is a nonlinear function of volume .",
    "a liquidity demander submits a _ market order _ to buy or sell any amount of the asset according to the price curve .",
    "taking a bertrand - type competition among liquidity suppliers into account , it is then reasonable to begin with modeling the price curve as the utility indifference price for a representative liquidity supplier ( rls hereafter ) .",
    "+ if the rls is risk - neutral , then the utility indifference price of an asset coincides with the expected value of the future cash - flow associated with the asset .",
    "the price curve then becomes linear in volume .",
    "this simplest framework was adopted by many studies such as glosten and milgrom  @xcite . in this study , we assume the rls to be risk - averse in managing her inventory , which results in nonlinear pricing with market impact . +",
    "this approach differs from the classical works including garman  @xcite , amihud and mendelson  @xcite , ho and stoll  @xcite , ohara and oldfield  @xcite , where a price quote is a solution of an utility maximization problem for a market maker with exogenously given order - flow . here , we solve an utility maximization problem for a representative liquidity demander ( rld hereafter ) .",
    "therefore , an order - flow is endogenously determined .",
    "our model is closely related to the one considered in bank and kramkov  @xcite , where they analyzed the market impact of a large trade and formulated a nonlinear stochastic integral as the profit and loss associated with a given strategy of a large trader . here , we aim at deriving the dynamics of the _ efficient price _ , that is the asset price when the rld follows an optimal strategy . unlike standard optimal investment or hedging problems ,",
    "the asset price is nonlinear in volume and depends on the trading strategy .",
    "if the set of the liquidity demanders consists of price takers and a single large investor , the optimal strategy can be interpreted as the solution of an optimal investment or hedging problem for the large investor under a simplified version of the model introduced by bank and kramkov  @xcite .",
    "the model represents permanent market impact , while instantaneous or temporary market impact models have been extensively considered in the literature .",
    "see e.g. cetin et al .",
    "@xcite , fukasawa  @xcite , guant  @xcite and the references therein . in the most of the preceding studies ,",
    "the structure of market impact was exogenously modeled . here , as in bank and kramkov  @xcite",
    ", the market impact is endogenous .",
    "+ we consider a hypothetical market where all traded securities expire at a maturity and yield cash - flow , of which the joint probability distribution is given exogenously .",
    "this can be seen as a model of a commodity futures market .",
    "a standard theory shows that a commodity future price is determined by an arbitrage relation to the spot price of the commodity .",
    "this arbitrage pricing however does not work for a commodity of which the inventory costs are so expensive , such as oil or electricity .",
    "a major factor which determines the future price of such a commodity would be the probability distribution of the spot price at the maturity , which is the idea of our model .",
    "+ in section  2 , we give a rigorous formulation of the problem . in section  3",
    ", we consider a lvy - driven market as an example which admits explicit results .",
    "in particular , we observe that an optimal risk allocation between the rls and the rld is achieved in a specific situation .",
    "we see also that an endowment shock can invoke a price crash with severe illiquidity . in section  4",
    ", we solve the optimal hedging problem under a condition of completeness , where the optimal risk allocation is achieved . in particular , we construct a perfect hedging strategy under the market impact .",
    "we observe that the volatility of the efficient price process depends on the convexity of an initial endowment to be hedged .",
    "we see also that a price crash is invoked by a propagated endowment shock . in section  5 , under an incomplete situation , we establish a dynamic programming principle in a discrete time framework and give its applications .",
