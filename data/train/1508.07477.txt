    "simulating quantum systems on classical computers is a major challenge in theoretical physics , a challenge that has been addressed by a number of recent algorithmic developments  @xcite .",
    "such simulation is particularly difficult when strong correlations , as reflected in a high level of entanglement , are present  @xcite . for one - dimensional systems , the matrix - product - state  based ( mps  based )  @xcite density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg )",
    "method  @xcite is the most effective tool to calculate the properties of the ground and selected excited states . in higher dimensions ,",
    "the dmrg is less efficient at representing the entanglement structure of states due to its one - dimensional topology .",
    "recent developments have led to several alternative methods that potentially overcome the limitations of the dmrg .",
    "these include , tensor network states ( tns )  @xcite , the multi - scale entanglement renormalization ( mera )  @xcite , the projected entangled pair states ( peps )  @xcite , the tree - tensor network state ( ttns )  @xcite , quantum monte carlo ( qmc )  @xcite , and the density matrix embedding theory ( dmet )  @xcite .",
    "all such methods have advantages and disadvantages ; each of these methods has competitive performance in particular circumstances .",
    "however , there is no single method yet that can be applied efficiently as a black - box tool to a general quantum lattice problem .",
    "therefore , despite substantial effort over many years , accessible system sizes in more than one dimension are still strongly limited .",
    "for example , in two and higher dimensions , qmc is a potentially very powerful method but it suffers from the so - called fermion sign problem  @xcite , which occurs when fermionic systems and spin systems with frustration are treated .",
    "the domain of application of peps is limited due to the expensive scaling of the computational cost with bond dimension when highly entangled systems are treated  @xcite .",
    "in addition , when the infinite - system version of peps , ipeps , is used , the proper choice of the size of the unit cell can significantly effect the final solution  @xcite .",
    "another promising method for simulating two - dimensional systems is the dmet , a method that is based on the numerically exact calculation of the ground state ( or other particular state ) of a finite - size cluster embedded to an environment via a density matrix .",
    "the cluster calculation is typically carried out using exact diagonalization or the dmrg , whereas the degrees of freedom of the environment are approximated .",
    "the accuracy therefore depends on the level of truncation of the environment degrees of freedom . within the dmrg",
    ", a two - dimensional system must be mapped to a one - dimensional lattice topology due to the nature of the mps , which must then be optimized by sweeping through the system in a `` snake - like '' manner  @xcite .",
    "thus , local interactions become nonlocal with respect to the mps , and an efficient representation of a locally entangled two - dimensional state becomes impossible .",
    "an overview of recent state - of - the - art results on the two - dimensional hubbard model calculated using a variety of numerical algorithms has been given in a recent review  @xcite .",
    "one interesting conclusion is that , in spite of the limitations of mps  based methods for two - dimensional systems , competitively accurate results have been obtained for two - dimensional frustrated spin systems using the dmrg .",
    "for example , for the heisenberg model on the kagome lattice , dmrg calculations yield results that have among the best levels of variational accuracy  @xcite and are in excellent agreement with results from mera  @xcite and peps  @xcite .",
    "the amount of entanglement present when partitioning a system , however , is basis dependent  @xcite .",
    "therefore , a given problem could possibly be solved with significantly less computational cost if an optimal representation could be found  @xcite .",
    "for example , the dmrg treatment of a two - dimensional noninteracting fermionic problem is exponentially difficult in real space due to the high level of entanglement , whereas in a momentum - space representation the solution is a simple product state , which can be represented exactly with a low - dimensional mps  @xcite . for the case of non - vanishing interactions , however , interactions that are local in a particular basis ( typically real space ) become nonlocal after a change of basis , influencing the scaling behavior of entanglement with system size dramatically . for systems with sufficient locality ,",
    "i.e. , with hopping and interaction terms that have a finite range within a lattice of a particular dimensionality , the scaling of the entropy for ground and certain low - lying excited states is thought to obey the entropy area law  @xcite .",
    "thus , such models with short - range interactions can , generically , be simulated efficiently using tensor network state algorithms .",
    "when locality is lost , the area law , in general , can break down , making efficient treatment of the problem difficult  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , for small interaction strengths and for a given error threshold , it is still potentially possible to find a representation that is computationally more efficient for particular system sizes .",
    "in addition , the weak - coupling regime is often well approximated by analytical approaches  @xcite , providing connections between numerical and analytical results .",
    "furthermore , geometrical aspects of a hamiltonian in a particular representation can have a more compact description in another representation ; in particular , what is long range in real space tends to be short range in momentum space and vice versa .    motivated by the arguments above , here we study and compare the real - space and momentum - space representations of the hubbard model in one and two dimensions from the point of view of quantum information entropies . although previous numerical studies of the hubbard model using the momentum - space dmrg method ( k - dmrg ) date from as long as two decades ago  @xcite , these studies were severely limited in the number of block states kept , worked with non - optimally ordered mpss for the two - dimensional system , and did not study the behavior of quantum - information - based quantities .",
    "therefore , a rigorous analysis of the scaling of the entanglement entropy and other measures of quantum correlation as a function of system sizes and interaction strengths could not be carried out . in this paper , we reexamine the hubbard model using the k - dmrg , presenting state - of - the - art results using a modern mps  based dmrg code that optimizes the mapping of the lattice to an mps and can keep up to of the order of @xmath2 block states for the momentum - space hubbard model . to study the intrinsic properties of the mps representation , we carry out a detailed analysis of entanglement scaling with system size and interaction strength @xmath0 in one and two dimensions .",
    "our study is also motivated by the fact that information on the dimensionality and geometry of the lattice as well as range of the hopping is encoded in the kinetic term , which is diagonal in momentum space .",
    "thus , the k - dmrg is less sensitive than the real - space representation to changes in these aspects of the model , that is , more complex cases that add computational cost in real space could potentially be treated with little additional cost in momentum space ; it is important to determine to what extent this is the case .",
    "furthermore , the momentum - space representation is intrinsically translationally invariant , so that finite - size corrections can be treated by scaling systems with periodic and antiperiodic boundary conditions rather than the open boundary conditions that must usually be used in real space .",
    "finally , using the k - dmrg the entanglement patterns of the wave function can be analyzed with respect to momentum , allowing us to make connections between weak - coupling analytic pictures  @xcite and numerical results .",
    "in particular , we will be able to study the role of umklapp in one dimension and the effect of perfect and non - perfect nesting in two dimensions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : theory ] , we describe the model , define the quantum - information - based quantities that we treat , and describe the numerical methods . in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] , we apply our approach to the one- and two - dimensional hubbard models in momentum space . finally , sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] contains our conclusions .",
    "the hamiltonian of the hubbard model in real space has the form @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 creates and annihilates a particle on site @xmath6 with spin @xmath7 , @xmath8 measures the number of electrons on site @xmath6 with spin @xmath9 , and @xmath10 denotes a nearest - neighbor pair on sites @xmath6 and @xmath11 . the dimensionality and structure of the lattice is contained in the the definition of the index @xmath6 and in the definition of the nearest neighbors . by carrying out a change of basis using a fourier transformation ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath12 , we obtain the corresponding momentum - space hamiltonian @xmath13 if periodic boundary conditions are applied , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 creates and annihilates a particle with momentum @xmath16 , with @xmath16 a vector with the dimensionality of the lattice , and @xmath17 is the number of sites . in one dimension , @xmath18 , with @xmath19 and @xmath20 . in two dimensions , @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "note that the @xmath16  points will be shifted by a half - interval if antiperiodic rather than periodic boundary conditions are applied in a particular direction . due to momentum conservation , the total momentum before and after the scattering processes given by the four - operator term",
    "is the same . the interaction strength @xmath0 is given in units of @xmath23 with @xmath24 .",
    "in the remainder of the paper , we will use the expression `` hartree - fock orbitals '' to denote single - particle orbitals , i.e. , @xmath16  points , that are filled for the noninteracting case , @xmath25 .",
    "these points will be within the fermi surface where the `` fermi surface '' is defined by the boundary in momentum space between occupied and unoccupied points for @xmath25 . in one dimension ,",
    "the fermi surface consists of two points , @xmath26 , and in two dimensions , it forms a curve or set of curves in the @xmath27-@xmath28 plane in the infinite - system limit .",
    "also note that we measure distance in momentum space in units of the unit vectors of the reciprocal space , that is , @xmath29 for the one - dimensional chain and @xmath30 or @xmath31 for the two - dimensional square lattice of dimension @xmath32 .",
    "use of terms such as `` long range '' or `` short range '' as applied to momentum space will refer to momentum - space distances measured in these units .",
    "`` volume '' in momentum space will be shorthand for the number of discrete momentum points in a momentum region or in the entire lattice .      in the two - site dmrg ,",
    "the full hilbert space of a finite system consisting of @xmath17 sites , @xmath33 , is approximated by a tensor product of four tensor spaces , @xmath34 .",
    "the basis states of @xmath35 , the local - site ( tensor ) space , depend on the representation in which the hamiltonian is formulated .",
    "the bases of the @xmath36 and @xmath37 are formed through a series of unitary transformations generated by singular value decompositions ( svd ) applied repeatedly as the bipartite partition of the system is moved back and forth through the lattice (  sweeping \" ) .",
    "thus , their actual form depends on the details of the procedure  @xcite .",
    "the nature and size of the bases of @xmath36 and @xmath37 can be optimized using the concepts of quantum information theory  @xcite i.e. , by controlling the level of entanglement  @xcite of the subsystems  @xcite . therefore",
    ", a given problem can be solved with significantly less computational resources if an optimal representation is found  @xcite .",
    "the single - site von neumann entropy , @xmath38 is formed from the reduced density matrix @xmath39 of the subsystem consisting of the site @xmath40 .",
    "its value ranges from @xmath41 to @xmath42 for a fermionic site with spin , with larger values corresponding to a more mixed state and a larger contribution to the correlation energy .",
    "in fact , an exact expression for the local single - site entropy in the ground state of the one - dimensional hubbard model has also been derived  @xcite .",
    "similarly , the two - site von neumann entropy can be constructed using the reduced density matrix of a subsystem built from orbitals @xmath40 and @xmath43 , @xmath44 .",
    "the mutual information @xmath45 describes how these two orbitals are correlated with each other given that they are embedded in the whole system .",
    "it includes contributions from correlations of both classical and quantum nature  @xcite .",
    "the number of block states , @xmath46 and @xmath47 , required to achieve a given convergence is determined by the von neumann entropy of segments of length @xmath48 of the finite chain ( `` blocks '' )  @xcite . in practice ,",
    "we fix the accuracy threshold and vary the number of block states @xmath49  to maintain the threshold .",
    "the @xmath50-site block entropy @xmath51 can be used to study critical and gapped phases and is an easily accessed quantity numerically , as the reduced density matrices @xmath52 are generated automatically within the dmrg procedure .",
    "ground states of lattice models with local interactions are thought to obey the so - called entropy area law relatively generically  @xcite . in one dimension ,",
    "the block entropy can be shown to saturate with block length for gapped models and to diverge logarithmically for critical systems  @xcite . in two dimensions",
    ", the entropy area law still applies if interactions are short - range and all correlation functions have finite correlation lengths  @xcite .",
    "when nonlocal interactions are present , the arguments for the applicability of the area law break down . in nonlocal models , the profile of the block entropy has a more general form that depends on several factors , as has been discussed for the hubbard model in momentum space  @xcite , for the xxz chain in momentum space  @xcite , and for quantum chemical systems  @xcite .",
    "the block entropy profile can be optimized by minimizing the entanglement distance , defined as @xmath53 where the sum is weighted by the @xmath54 moment of the distance ( @xmath55 )  @xcite , and the distance function @xmath56 depends on the tensor network topology  @xcite .",
    "in the mps  based dmrg , @xmath57 refers to the distance between sites within the mps chain , and eq .",
    "( [ eq : idist ] ) can be minimized by permuting the lattice sites , i.e. , by reordering  @xcite . in this way , both the sum of @xmath51 over @xmath48 and the maximum of @xmath51 over all @xmath50 , @xmath58 $ ] , can be reduced significantly .",
    "the sum is related to the computational time of a full sweep , and the maximum determines the maximum amount of computational resources required for one dmrg step . by changing a local hopping to a nonlocal hopping by permuting the ordering of lattice sites",
    ", one can interpolate between a logarithmic- ( area law ) and a linear ( volume law ) scaling  @xcite , as has been demonstrated in a study of the one - dimensional hubbard model  @xcite .",
    "another way of reducing @xmath59 is to transform the single - particle basis , choosing the transformation to optimize entanglement measures  @xcite .",
    "for example , for the noninteracting ( @xmath25 ) hubbard model , the hamiltonian is diagonal in the momentum - space representation , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and the ground state is a product state ; thus , @xmath59 and @xmath51 are zero . on the other hand , for finite coulomb interaction @xmath0 ,",
    "these quantities become finite and , in the @xmath62 limit , @xmath63 , i.e. , all sites are in maximally mixed states .",
    "therefore , the momentum - space representation is expected to be useful in a regime adiabatically connected to the free - particle case , typically the weak - coupling regime .",
    "entanglement analysis is also a very powerful tool to obtain physical information encoded in the wave function  @xcite .",
    "entanglement patterns by the two - site mutual information provide information about the overall correlations in the system , while the generalized correlation functions used to form the two - site reduced density matrix can be used to identify dominant correlations . for more detailed discussions ,",
    "see refs .  .",
    "some aspects of the usual dmrg algorithm must be adapted to obtain an efficient implementation for momentum - space hamiltonians .",
    "the main difficulty in implementing the momentum - space dmrg comes from the fact that short - range interaction terms such as that in the real - space hubbard model , eq .  , become long - range in the momentum basis .",
    "naively implemented , the momentum - space hubbard model hamiltonian requires the calculation of @xmath64 terms in order to apply the interaction part of the hamiltonian to the wave vector because of sum over three momenta in eq .  .",
    "in an mps formulation , the matrix product operator ( mpo ) would have bond dimension @xmath65 , resulting in unacceptable resource requirements even for relatively small system sizes .",
    "this problem can be ameliorated by factorizing the hamiltonian and building partial sums over certain combinations of operators within the left and right dmrg blocks , resulting in an effective one - index sum and a computational cost per diagonalization step of @xmath66 . at the same time , the required composed operators must be saved and updated iteratively , resulting in additional memory cost of @xmath66 .",
    "while this technique was already described and used in the first work on momentum - space dmrg  @xcite , here we have adapted this method to the mps framework and optimized it within this framework .",
    "the factorization described above can only be carried out for particular forms of the interaction of which the fourier - transformed on - site interaction is one . the cpu time and memory costs for a single diagonalization step",
    "can be reduced to @xmath66 , compared to @xmath67 for other more general long - range hamiltonians ( e.g. , those for quantum chemistry )  @xcite .",
    "certain extensions to the hubbard interaction , such as nearest- or next - nearest - neighbor repulsion can also be factorized to obtain @xmath66 terms , only affecting the prefactor but not the scaling in the computational cost  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the real - space case , adding longer - range terms to the hopping in momentum space only affects the dispersion relation , which enters the hamiltonian as a diagonal term , and therefore does not change the mpo bond dimension .",
    "one significant advantage of working in the momentum - space representation is the availability of the additional momentum quantum numbers . within an mps  based dmrg implementation",
    ", all contractions of the tensor network can be reduced to a series of matrix operations , principally multiplications .",
    "the abelian momentum quantum numbers can be used to decompose all matrices to block form , where the blocks are labeled by quantum number pairs .",
    "carrying out operations only using these blocks significantly speeds up the algorithm and significantly lowers the memory required . for the hubbard model calculations carried out here , we typically obtain very small dense blocks with @xmath68 elements , which make up sparse matrices with up to millions of blocks .",
    "this large number of blocks makes it essential to carry out the quantum - number bookkeeping as efficiently as possible and to reduce additional overhead to a minimum . in our code",
    ", we obtain very good results by using hash tables to do the quantum - number bookkeeping .    at the same time",
    ", use of the momentum quantum numbers introduces convergence problems because the quantum numbers of local states of two neighboring sites can , in general , no longer be recombined to the same target quantum number in more than one way . due to this , the algorithm tends to get stuck in local minima even if the dmrg is implemented in the usual way with two single sites in the center .",
    "( such problems typically occur in the variant of the dmrg where a single site is taken in the center . ) for example , a two - site k - dmrg calculation initialized with a product state will remain stuck in that state throughout the entire calculation unless additional measures are taken . for the single - site real - space dmrg algorithm ,",
    "an effective solution to this problem is to add a noise term to the density matrix  @xcite .",
    "here , we add such a noise term within the two - site algorithm and find that the convergence problem is essentially eliminated , provided that the noise term is given appropriate strength .    in our implementation , which exploits the additional momentum quantum numbers and carries out an efficient factorization of the interaction term , a comparatively large number of block states can be kept at reasonable computational cost .",
    "we typically increase the number of block states after every second full sweep by @xmath69 states and keep a maximum of up to @xmath70 states during the last two sweeps . running on 10 cpu cores ( intel^^ xeon^^ 5140 ) ,",
    "the calculation for a @xmath71-site system with a maximum of @xmath70 states kept during the last two sweeps takes roughly three days of wall - clock time and uses 30 gb of main memory .",
    "we use two codes , one sequential code based on a strongly modified version of the open - source itensor library  @xcite and one parallelized code based on a self - written tensor library .",
    "in addition to these technical optimizations , choosing appropriate boundary conditions for each calculation so that a `` closed - shell '' configuration is obtained for the fermi sea can lower the maximum block entropy and thus improve the dmrg convergence for a fixed number of block states .",
    "the idea is to coordinate lattice size , filling , and boundary conditions so that the noninteracting ground state is non degenerate .",
    "for example , consider the noninteracting half - filled one - dimensional hubbard model in momentum space .",
    "for periodic boundary conditions and system sizes @xmath72 the ground state in momentum space is a unique product state , while system sizes @xmath73 lead to a fourfold - degenerate ground state .",
    "for antiperiodic boundary conditions , the momentum - space sites are shifted , reversing the situation .",
    "it is known that this behavior is preserved in the exact bethe ansatz solution for the interacting one - dimensional system  @xcite .",
    "although interaction tends to wash out degeneracies in open - shell configurations , taking closed - shell configurations for weak to moderate coupling strength is still very useful . for moderate coupling strength ,",
    "closed - shell configurations have a unique hartree - fock ground state and thus have fewer energetically low - lying excitations , leading to a less entangled ground state .",
    "the system sizes , fillings , and boundary conditions in the next section are selected accordingly .",
    "in this section , we present our numerical results obtained with the momentum - space dmrg on the half - filled and doped hubbard model in one and two dimensions for finite systems .",
    "first , we analyze the entanglement patterns in the ground - state wave function , identifying relevant correlations by examining highly entangled momenta points .",
    "next , we calculate the wave - function coefficients in full tensor form , which are an alternate way of characterizing the wave function and can be connected to the configuration - interaction ( ci ) expansion technique used in quantum chemistry .",
    "finally , we study the scaling of entanglement , quantified by the von neumann block entropy , as a function of interaction strength and system size .      in order to investigate the entanglement structure and optimize the site ordering within the mps , we examine the two - site mutual information @xmath74 as well as the site occupancy and single - site entropy for the one- and two - dimensional hubbard models .        we start with the half - filled one - dimensional case in fig .",
    "[ fig : ground_state_1d_n1 ] . figure  [ fig : ground_state_1d_n1](a ) is a ( color ) density plot of the @xmath74 matrix , with the row and column indices @xmath40 and @xmath43 referring to the sites of the dmrg chain , while in fig .",
    "[ fig : ground_state_1d_n1](b ) the same correlations are plotted as lines between the corresponding points in momentum space , where the momentum points are arranged in the vertical direction according to the dispersion relation @xmath75 .",
    "one can see that the pairs of sites with the strongest correlations are the pairs which are associated with the allowed scattering processes close to the fermi surface , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : g - ology ] .",
    "consequently , the single - site entropy @xmath76 [ fig .",
    "[ fig : ground_state_1d_n1](d ) ] shows two peaks at the fermi points . correspondingly , the site occupancy [ fig .",
    "[ fig : ground_state_1d_n1](c ) ] drops from close to @xmath77 to almost @xmath78 at the fermi points ; the sharp drop is characteristic of the relatively weak interaction strength @xmath79 .",
    "the strongest bonds can be found between those pairs of sites with distance @xmath80 in momentum space .",
    "therefore , in order to improve the dmrg convergence , sites with a separation @xmath81 in momentum space should be placed on neighboring sites on the dmrg chain .",
    "in addition , pairs close to the fermi surface should be put in the center of the dmrg chain .",
    "automatic ordering of the sites , carried out by minimizing the entanglement distance ( [ eq : idist ] ) , gives the optimal ordering shown in table  [ tab:1d_ordering ] , which corresponds quite well to these heuristic rules .",

    "[ fig : ground_state_1d_n075 ] ] , taking an average particle number @xmath85 .",
    "the entanglement structure is similar to that in the half - filled case ; the pairs of sites close to and symmetric relative to the fermi points ( now at somewhat smaller @xmath86 ) show the strongest correlations [ see fig .  [",

    "however , the pairs of momentum points analogous to those which , in the half - filled case , are associated with backward and umklapp scattering , @xmath87 and @xmath84 , respectively , are now significantly less correlated . this can be understood by examining the effect of the shifting of the fermi points on the conservation of momentum .",
    "in the half - filled case , the energetically lowest excitations relative to the hartree - fock ground state @xmath88 that have the same total momentum are of four different types :    @xmath89    @xmath90    with @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , and @xmath94 . in the doped case ,",
    "states of type @xmath95 no longer have the same momentum as @xmath96 because @xmath97 .",
    "thus , they can not be in the space of the ground state . without these excitations ,",
    "two - particle umklapp processes symmetric to the fermi surface are no longer possible ; this also holds for higher excitations . in terms of equal - time correlations , the number of excitations that make up the interacting ground state and can contribute to the correlations drops , consequently lowering the two - site mutual information between these sites .    in matrix form for optimal ordering , @xmath74 [ fig .",
    "[ fig : ground_state_1d_n075](a ) ] is somewhat less diagonal - dominated than at half - filling , but the strongly off - diagonal elements have comparable or smaller values than the half - filled case .",

    "the combination of these two effects leads to volume - law scaling of the block entropy .    once the volume dependence is factored out , we obtain almost universal curves for the maximum of the block entropy per site for both the one- and two - dimensional hubbard models , at least at half - filling .",
    "these curves must go to zero at zero interaction and increase with the square of the interaction strength for weak coupling , retaining a perfect volume scaling .",
    "the presence of volume scaling of the entropy at arbitrary weak interaction is a distinct indication of the fundamental limitations of perturbative approaches for the hubbard model in one and two dimensions . for strong coupling , the maximum entropy per site saturates , with a boundary value lying clearly below its theoretical limit and with a volume scaling that seems to be slightly sublinear , at least in the one - dimensional , half - filled case .",
    "we find this result somewhat surprising and slightly less unfavorable than naively expected , even though , admittedly , the high value of the maximum entropy per site and the approximate volume law preclude any well - controlled mps  based approaches .    despite these limitations , the momentum - space dmrg also has some interesting favorable properties .",
    "while the convergence of the real - space dmrg becomes worse for doped systems , we have found that , in momentum space , the block entanglement decreases and the convergence improves upon doping .",
    "in addition , our highly optimized and parallelized code has enabled us to keep a comparably large number of block states at reasonable computational cost , a number of states that is typically significantly larger than a comparably optimized real - space dmrg code for similar system size and parameters . since the coefficient of the volume scaling can be made arbitrarily small at weak interaction , the k - dmrg could nevertheless yield variationally competitive results , at least relative to the real - space dmrg , for particular moderate system sizes at sufficiently weak interaction .",
    "one possibility to overcome the main problems of momentum - space dmrg while keeping some of its advantages is to use a hybrid real- and momentum - space representation , i.e. , take a momentum basis in the transverse direction and a real - space basis in the other direction . in this way ,",
    "the translational invariance and good momentum quantum numbers are preserved in the transverse direction , but the volume - law entanglement due to long - range interactions the in the longitudinal direction can be avoided .",
