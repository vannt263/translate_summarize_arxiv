    "various related mechanisms are thought to contribute to the generation and maintenance of large - scale meridional flows in the solar convection zone .",
    "the effect of rotation on turbulent convection induces a relatively strong anisotropy in the reynolds stresses ( kippenhahn 1963 ) , in particular near the base of the convection zone where the convective turnover time is of the order of the solar rotation period .",
    "the divergence of these anisotropic stresses can directly drive large - scale meridional flows ( see rdiger , 1989 , for a discussion of this effect ) .",
    "it also drives large - scale zonal flows ( more commonly referred to as differential rotation ) which then induce meridional forcing through the biais of the coriolis force , a mechanism referred to as `` gyroscopic pumping '' ( mcintyre 2007 ) .",
    "indeed , the polar regions of the convection zone are observed to be more slowly rotating than the bulk of the sun ( schou _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ) , so that the associated coriolis force in these regions drives fluid _ towards _ the polar axis",
    ". meanwhile , equatorial regions are rotating more rapidly than the average , and are therefore subject to a coriolis force pushing fluid _ away _ from the polar axis .",
    "the most likely flow pattern resulting from the combination of these forces is one with an equatorial upwelling , a surface poleward flow and a deep return flow .",
    "this pattern is indeed observed near the solar surface : poleward surface and sub - surface flows with velocities up to a few tens of meters per second have been observed by measurements of photospheric line - shifts ( labonte & howard 1982 ) and by time - distance helioseismology ( giles et al .",
    "1997 ) respectively .",
    "the amplitude and spatial distribution of these meridional flows deeper in the convection zone remains essentially unknown , as the sensitivity of helioseismic methods rapidly drops below the surface . as a result",
    ", the question of whether some of the pumped mass flux actually penetrates into the underlying radiative zone is still open , despite its obvious importance for mixing of chemical species ( pinsonneault , 1997 ; elliott & gough , 1999 ) , and its presumed role in the dynamical balance of the solar interior ( gough & mcintyre 1998 , mcintyre , 2007 , garaud , 2007 , garaud & garaud , 2008 ) and in some models of the solar dynamo ( see charbonneau , 2005 for a review ) .    in paper i ( garaud & brummell , 2008 )",
    ", we began a systematic study of the penetration of meridional flows from the convection zone into the radiative zone by considering a related but easier question : _ assuming that the amplitude and geometry of meridional flows in the convection zone are both known _ , what is their influence on the underlying radiative zone ?",
    "this simpler question enabled us to study the dynamics of the radiative zone only by assuming a flow profile at the radiative  convective interface ( instead of having to include the more complex convection zone in the calculation ) .",
    "the overwhelming conclusion of that first study was that the degree to which flows penetrate into the stratified interior ( in the model ) is _ very _ sensitive to the interfacial conditions selected .",
    "hence , great care must be taken when using a `` radiative - zone - only '' model to make definite predictions about interior flow amplitudes .",
    "in addition , that approach makes the implicit assumption that the dynamics of the radiative zone do not in return influence those of the convection zone , but the only way to verify this is to construct a model which includes both regions .",
    "this was the original purpose of the present study ; as we shall see , the combined radiative ",
    "convective model we construct here provides insight into a much broader class of problems .",
    "we therefore propose a simplified model of the sun which includes both a `` convective '' region and a `` radiative '' region , where the convective region is forced in such a way as to promote gyroscopic pumping of meridional flows .",
    "we calculate the flow solution everywhere and characterize how it scales in terms of governing parameters ( e.g. stellar rotation rate , stratification , diffusivities , etc .. ) , focusing in particular on the flows which are entering the radiative zone .",
    "we begin with a simple boussinesq cartesian model ( section [ sec : cart ] ) , first in the unstratified limit ( section [ sec : unstrat ] ) and then in the more realistic case of a radiative  convective stratification ( section [ sec : strat ] ) .",
    "although the cartesian results essentially illustrate most of the relevant physical phenomena , we confirm our analysis with numerical solutions of the full set of equations in a spherical geometry in section [ sec : spherical ] .",
    "we then use this information in section [ sec : disc ] to discuss the effects of mixing by meridional flows both in the sun and in other main sequence stars .",
    "as in paper i , we first study the problem in a cartesian geometry .",
    "since our primary aim is to understand the behavior of the meridional flows generated ( e.g. scaling of the solutions ) in terms of the governing parameters , this approach is sufficient and vastly simplifies the required algebra . in section [ sec : spherical ] , we turn to numerical simulations to study the problem in a spherical geometry .    in this cartesian model section , distances are normalized to the solar radius @xmath0 , and velocities to @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the mean solar angular velocity ( the exact value is not particularly relevant here ) . the coordinate system is @xmath3 , where @xmath4 should be thought of as the azimuthal coordinate @xmath5 , with @xmath6 $ ] ; @xmath7 represents minus the co - latitude and spans the interval @xmath8 $ ] ( the poles are at @xmath9 and @xmath10 while the equator is at @xmath11 ) . finally the @xmath12-direction is the radial direction with @xmath13 $ ] , and represents the direction of ( minus ) gravity so that @xmath14 is the interior , and @xmath15 is the surface .    in this framework ,",
    "the system rotates with mean angular velocity @xmath16 , thereby implicitly assuming that the rotation axis is everywhere aligned with gravity .",
    "this assumption induces another `` geometric '' error in the velocity estimates for the meridional flows , comparable with the error made in reducing the problem to a cartesian analysis ; it does not influence the predicted scalings ( except in small equatorial regions which we ignore here ) .",
    "we divide the domain in two regions , by introducing the dimensionless constant @xmath17 to represent the radiative  convective interface .",

    ", we work with the boussinesq approximation ( this assumption is dropped in the spherical model but does nt affect the predicted scalings ) .",
    "the background state is assumed to be stratified , steady , and in hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "the background density and temperature profiles are denoted by @xmath21 and @xmath22 respectively .",
    "density and temperature perturbations to this background state ( @xmath23 and @xmath24 ) are then assumed to be linearly related : @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the coefficient of thermal expansion . for simplicity",
    ", we will assume that the background temperature gradient @xmath27 is constant throughout the domain @xmath28 $ ] , and treat the convection zone as a region where @xmath29 while the radiative zone has @xmath30 ( see below ) .",
    "the alternative option of using a constant @xmath31 and a varying @xmath27 yields qualitatively equivalent scalings for the meridional flows ( a statement which is verified in section [ sec : spherical ] ) although the algebra is trickier .",

    "as mentioned earlier , the transition between the model radiative zone and convection zone is measured by the behavior of @xmath26 , which goes from 0 for @xmath42 to a finite value for @xmath43 .",
    "this can be modeled in a non - dimensional way through the rossby number , which we assume is of the form : @xmath44 \\mbox {    ,   } \\ ] ] where @xmath45 is constant .",

    ", the nonlinear terms @xmath49 and @xmath50 are assumed to be negligible . within the convection zone on the other hand , anisotropic turbulent stresses are thought to drive the observed differential rotation .",
    "we model this effect in the simplest possible way , replacing the divergence of the stresses by a linear relaxation towards the observed convection zone profile : @xmath51 where @xmath52 and the function @xmath53 models the observed azimuthal velocity profile in the solar convection zone .",
    "this is analogous to the prescription used by spiegel & bretherton ( 1968 ) in their study of the effect of a convection zone on solar spin - down , although in their model the convection zone was not differentially rotating .",
    "the dimensionless relaxation timescale @xmath54 can be thought of , for example , as being of the same order of magnitude as the convective turnover time divided by the rotation period .",
    "it is modeled as : @xmath55\\mbox {    .   } \\ ] ] note that in the real solar convection zone , @xmath54 varies by orders of magnitudes between the surface ( @xmath56 ) and the bottom of the convection zone ( @xmath57 ) . here",

    "the tanh function once again is merely added to guarantee continuity of the forcing across the overshoot layer .",
    "the function @xmath61 describes the imposed `` vertical shear '' , and is for simplicity taken to be a linear function of @xmath12 .",
    "if @xmath62 , the forcing effectively vanishes at the base of the convection zone . if @xmath63 on the other hand , a strong azimuthal shear is forced at the interface",
    "the observed solar rotation profile appears to be consistent with @xmath64 and @xmath65 both being non - zero ( and of the order of 0.1 , although since we are studying a linear problem , the amplitude of the forcing is somewhat irrelevant ) . note that if @xmath66 the forcing velocity @xmath67 has zero vorticity .    finally ,",
    "the observed asphericity in the temperature profile is negligible in the solar convection zone ; this is attributed to the fact that the turbulent convection very efficiently mixes heat both vertically and horizontally .",
    "we model this effect as : @xmath68 where the turbulent heat diffusion coefficient is modeled as @xmath69\\mbox {    ,   } \\ ] ] and thus vanishes beneath the overshoot layer .",
    "we will assume that the diffusion timescale @xmath70 ( in non - dimensional units ) is much smaller than any other typical timescale in the system ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "projecting the remaining equations into the cartesian coordinate system , and seeking solutions in the form @xmath72 for each of the unknown quantities yields @xmath73 note that as required , the imposed forcing term drags the fluid in the azimuthal direction : for @xmath74 , @xmath75 in the convection zone .",
    "the meridional flows @xmath76 and @xmath77 on the other hand are generated by the @xmath78component of the coriolis force and by mass conservation respectively ( the essence of gyroscopic pumping , see mcintyre 2007 ) .",
    "we now proceed to solve these equations to gain a better understanding of the meridional flows and their degree of penetration into the radiative zone below .",
    "we use a dual approach , solving these equations first analytically under various limits , and then exactly using a simple newton - raphson - kantorovich ( nrk ) two - point boundary value algorithm .",
    "the analytical approximations yield predictions for the relevant scalings of the solutions in terms of the governing parameters ( an in particular , the ekman number and the rossby number ) which are then confirmed by the exact numerical solutions .",
    "although this limit is not a priori relevant to the physics of the solar interior , we begin by studying the case of an unstratified region , setting @xmath79 ( in this case , the thermal energy equation can be discarded ) .",
    "this simpler problem , as we shall demonstrate , contains the essence of the problem .    in order to find analytical approximations to the solutions , we solve the governing equations separately in the convective zone and in the radiative zone . at this point",
    ", it may be worth pointing out that in the unstratified case , the nomenclatures `` convective '' and `` radiative '' merely refer to regions which respectively are and are not subject to the additional forcing .",

    "this implies that the amplitude of meridional flows everywhere in the solar interior scales like @xmath111 ( even in the convection zone ) .",
    "the physical interpretation of this somewhat surprising limit is discussed in section [ sec : phys_unstrat ] , but turns out to be of academic interest only ( section [ sec : twist ] ) .",

    "a full 2d visualization of the flow for @xmath122 but otherwise the same governing parameters is shown in figure  [ fig : unstr_bc1_2dfield1 ] .",
    "this figure illustrates more clearly the fact that the meridional flows are negligible below the interface , and mostly return within the convection zone .",
    "note that given our choice of the forcing function @xmath123 , the induced coriolis force does not vanish at @xmath9 or @xmath124 ( the `` poles '' ) .",
    "this explains why the meridional flows apparently cross the polar axis in this simple model .",
    "this is merely a geometric effect : in a true spherical geometry the forcing azimuthal velocity @xmath125 would be null at the poles , and meridional flows can not cross the polar axis .",
    "more realistic calculations in spherical geometry are discussed in section [ sec : spherical ] .    finally , it is interesting to note that the analytical solution for the azimuthal velocity @xmath105 exhibits a `` discontinuity '' across the base of the convection zone , which tends to @xmath126 as @xmath104 .",
    "the numerical solutions of course are continuous , but the continuity is only assured by the viscosity in the system ( in the @xmath78 direction ) and the fact that the overshoot layer depth is finite .",
    "this is shown in figure [ fig : unstr_bc1_uplot1 ] , together with a comparison of the numerical solutions with the analytical solution , again confirming the analytical approximation derived .",
    "this highlights another and equally a priori counter - intuitive property of the system : the value of @xmath127 in the radiative zone is markedly different from the imposed @xmath128 at the interface : @xmath129 hence , even if the imposed differential rotation is exactly 0 at the radiative  convective interface ( as it is the case in the simulation presented in figure [ fig : unstr_bc1_uplot1 ] since @xmath130 ) , a large - scale latitudinal shear measured by @xmath127 may be present in the radiative zone , as illustrated in figure [ fig : unstr_bc1_2dfield1 ] .",
    "this shows that the propagation of the azimuthal shear into the radiative zone is non - local ( i.e. does not rely on the presence of shear at the interface ) , and is instead communicated by the long - range pressure gradient .",
    "the stress - free bottom boundary conditions studied in the previous section are at first glance the closest to what one may expect in the real sun , where the `` bottom '' boundary merely represents the origin of the spherical coordinate system .",
    "however , let us now explore for completeness ( and for further reasons that will be clarified in the next section ) the case of no - slip bottom boundary conditions .    when the lower boundary is a no - slip boundary , the nature of the solution in the whole domain changes .",
    "this change is induced by the presence of an ekman boundary layer , which forms near @xmath14 . just above the boundary layer , in the bulk of the radiative zone",
    ", the solution described in [ sec : unstr_radbc1_ss ] remains valid .",
    "however , matching the bulk solution with the boundary conditions can no longer be done directly ; one must first solve for the boundary layer dynamics to match the bulk solution with the boundary conditions _ across _ the boundary layer .",
    "this is a standard procedure ( summarized in appendix a for completeness ) , and leads to the well - known `` ekman jump '' relationship between the jump in @xmath106 and the jump in @xmath105 across the boundary layer : @xmath131    by impermeability , @xmath132 .",
    "moreover , by assuming that the total angular momentum of the lower boundary is the same as that of the convection zone , we require that @xmath133 . meanwhile , @xmath134 and @xmath135 in the notation of equation ( [ eq : unstr_radbc1_sol ] ) .",
    "so finally , for no - slip boundary conditions , we simply replace the impermeability condition ( @xmath136 ) in ( [ eq : unstr_matchbc1_sys ] ) by @xmath137 and solve for the unknown constants @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath138 and @xmath101 as before",
    ".    the exact expressions for the resulting integration constants @xmath91 and @xmath92 are now slightly different from those given in ( [ eq : unstr_abbc1_sol ] ) , but are without particular interest . however , it can be shown that they have the same limit as in the stress - free case as @xmath104 ( with @xmath112 ) .",
    "this implies that the meridional flows driven _ within the convection zone _ , in the limit @xmath104 , and with @xmath112 , are independent of the boundary condition selected at the bottom of the radiative zone .",
    "however , we now have the following expression for @xmath106 in the bulk of the radiative zone : @xmath139 which has one fundamental consequence : the amplitude of the flows allowed to penetrate into the radiative zone is now of order @xmath140 instead of being @xmath141 .",
    "this particular statement is actually true even if @xmath142 , although in that case both convection zone and radiative zone flows scale with @xmath140 .",
    "figure [ fig : unstr_bc2_wplot1 ] shows a comparison between the approximate analytical formula and the numerical solution for the same simulations as in figure [ fig : unstr_bc1_wplot1 ] , but now using no - slip bottom boundary conditions . for ease of comparison , the results from the stress - free numerical simulations ( for exactly the same parameters ) have also been drawn , highlighting the much larger amplitude of the meridional flows down - welling into the radiative zone in the no - slip case , and their scaling with @xmath140 .",
    "figure [ fig : unstr_bc2_2dfield1 ] shows an equivalent 2d rendition of the solution , and illustrates the presence of large - scale mixing in the bulk of the radiative zone when the bottom - boundary is no - slip .",
    "the various sets of solutions derived above can be physically understood in the following way .",
    "let us first discuss the solution in the convection zone . in the limit where @xmath53 is independent of @xmath12 ( equivalently , @xmath142 ) ,",
    "the azimuthal ( @xmath99 ) component of the vorticity of the forcing is zero . in that case",
    "there is no injection of @xmath99vorticity into the system aside from that induced in the viscous boundary layers , and the amplitude of the meridional flows generated in the convection zone scales with @xmath111 .",
    "this limit is somewhat academic in the case of the sun , however given the observed rotation profile ( see also section [ sec : twist ] ) .",
    "when @xmath143 , the amplitude of the induced meridional flows in the convection zone scales linearly with @xmath65 and is independent of viscosity .    in the radiative zone ,",
    "the taylor - proudman constraint enforces invariance of the flow velocities along the rotation axis , except in regions where other forces balance the coriolis force . in the non - magnetic ,",
    "unstratified situation discussed in the two previous sections , the only agent capable of breaking the taylor - proudman constraint are viscous stresses , which are only significant in two thin boundary layers : one right below the convection zone and the other one near the bottom boundary .",
    "_ these two layers are the only regions where flows down - welling into the radiative zone are allowed to return to the convection zone_. the question then remains of what fraction of the mass flux entering the radiative zone returns within the upper ekman layer , and what fraction returns within the lower ekman layer .",
    "the latter , of course , permits large - scale mixing within the radiative zone .",
    "in the first case studied , the bottom boundary was chosen to be stress - free .",
    "this naturally suppresses the lower viscous boundary layer so that the only place where flows are allowed to return is at the radiative - convective interface",
    ". as a result , only a tiny fraction of the mass flux penetrates below @xmath93 , and the turnover time of the remaining flows within the radiative zone is limited to a viscous timescale of the order of @xmath144 .    following this reasoning",
    ", we expect and indeed find quite a different behavior when the bottom boundary is no - slip . in that case",
    "viscous stresses within the lower boundary layer break the taylor - proudman constraint and allow a non - zero mass flux ( of order @xmath145 ) to return near @xmath14 .",
    "this flow then mixes the entire radiative zone as well , with an overall turnover time of order of @xmath146 ( in dimensional units ) .",
    "to summarize , in this unstratified steady - state situation , the amount of mixing induced within the radiative zone by convective zone flows depends ( of course ) on the amplitude of the convection zone forcing , but also on the existence of a mechanism to break the taylor - proudman constraint somewhere within the radiative zone .",
    "that mechanism is needed in order to allow down - welling flows to return to the convection zone .",
    "but more crucially , this phenomenon implies that the dynamics of the lower boundary layer entirely control the mass flux through the system .    here",
    ", we studied the case of viscous stresses only .",
    "one can rightfully argue that there are no expected `` solid '' boundaries in a stellar interior and that the overall behavior of the system should be closer to the one discussed in the stress - free case than the no - slip case .",
    "_ however , we chose here to study viscous stresses simply because they are the easiest available example . _ in real stars viscous stresses are likely to be negligible compared with a variety of other possible stresses : turbulent stresses at the interface with another convection zone , magnetic forces , etc",
    ". nevertheless , these stresses will play a similar role in allowing flows to mix the radiative zone if they become comparable in amplitude with the coriolis force , and help break the taylor - proudman constraint .",
    "this issue is discussed in more detail in section [ sec : disc ] .      before moving on to the more realistic stratified case , note that this unstratified system holds one final subtlety . in all simulations presented earlier ,",
    "the overshoot layer depth was selected to be very small  and in particular , smaller than the ekman layer thickness . in that case , the transition in the forcing at the base of the convection zone is indeed close to being a discontinuity , and the analytical solutions presented in sections [ sec : unstr_conv_ss ] and [ sec : unstr_radbc1_ss ] are a good fit to the true numerical solution .    in the sun ,",
    "the overshoot layer depth @xmath46 is arguably always thicker than an ekman lengthscale @xmath145 .",
    "when this happens , the solution `` knows '' about the exact shape of the forcing function within the transition region , and therefore depends on it .",
    "this limit turns out to be rather difficult to study analytically , and since in the case of the sun we do not know the actual profile of @xmath147 , there is little point in exercise anyway .",
    "we can explore the behavior of the system numerically , however , for the profile @xmath147 discussed in equation ( [ eq : tau_profile ] ) , in the limit where @xmath148 .",
    "the example for which this effect matters the most is the somewhat academic limit where @xmath142 in the convection zone , but @xmath63 . in this case",
    ", the asymptotic analysis predicts that the meridional flow amplitudes are @xmath149 in both the convection zone and in the radiative zone for the no - slip case .",
    "we see in figure [ fig : varydelta ] that this is indeed the case in simulations where @xmath150 .",
    "however , when the overshoot thickness is progressively increased and becomes larger than the ekman layer thickness , the amplitude of the meridional circulation in the convection zone is no longer @xmath149 but much larger .",
    "meanwhile , the scaling of the radiative zone solutions with @xmath111 remain qualitatively correct .",
    "the difference with the analytical solution in the convection zone can simply be attributed to the fact that when the system knows about the shear _ within _ the overshoot layer the limit @xmath142 is no longer relevant .",
    "while the previous section provides interesting insight into the problem , notably on the role of the taylor - proudman constraint , we now move to the more realistic situation where stratification plays a role in the flow dynamics . in this section",
    ", we generalize our cartesian study to take into account the stratification of the lower region ( ro@xmath151 ) . for this purpose , we go back to studying the full system of equations ( [ eq : maineqs ] ) . as",
    "before , we first find approximate analytical solutions to derive the overall scaling of the solutions with governing parameters , and then compare them to the full numerical solutions of ( [ eq : maineqs ] ) .",
    "the analytical solutions are obtained by solving the system in the convective region and radiative region separately , and matching them at @xmath93 .",

    "the solutions are then as ( [ eq : unstr_conv_sol ] ) , together with @xmath155}{d_0 ( 1- \\delta^2 k^2 ) }   + \\frac{2is}{k^3 \\lambda d_0}\\mbox {    ,   } \\label{eq : tconv}\\ ] ] where the integration constants @xmath156 and @xmath157 remain to be determined . for the sake of analytical simplicity , we will assume that @xmath71 in all that follows ( i.e. very large thermal diffusivity in the convection zone ) , and thus neglect the third and fourth terms in ( [ eq : tconv ] ) .",
    "this limit is relevant for the sun .",
    "the radiative zone equations are now @xmath158 and can be combined to yield @xmath159 and similarly for @xmath154 .",
    "the characteristic polynomial is @xmath160 with solutions @xmath161 these solutions are the same as those presented in paper i , and will be referred to as the `` global - scale '' mode and the thermo - viscous mode respectively . note that here , @xmath162 corresponds to @xmath163 in paper i.    in this steady - state study , the quantity @xmath162 summarizes the effect of stratification .",
    "it is important to note that it contains information about the rotation rate of the star as well as the prandtl number , in addition to the buoyancy frequency . if @xmath164 , then the thermo - viscous mode essentially spans the whole domain : the system appears to be `` unstratified '' , and is again dominated by the taylor - proudman constraint . on the other hand , if @xmath165 then the flows only penetrate into the radiative zone within a small thermo - viscous boundary layer of thickness @xmath166 as a result of the strong stratification of the system .",
    "the taylor - proudman constraint is irrelevant in this limit , since the magnitude of the buoyancy force is much larger than that of the coriolis force .",
    "the calculation above was made in the limit where the viscous terms in the latitudinal and radial components of the momentum equation are discarded .",
    "paper i shows that two additional ekman modes are also present if they are instead kept . by analogy with the unstratified case",
    ", we expect that these ekman modes do not influence the solution for stress - free boundary conditions , but that additional care must be taken for no - slip boundary conditions .",
    "note that the equation for @xmath77 instead simplifies to @xmath167 and similarly for @xmath76 ( i.e. both equations are only second order in @xmath12 , and only contain the thermo - viscous mode ) . the radiative zone ( @xmath168 $ ] ) solutions are now @xmath169\\mbox {    ,    }   \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\hat w(z ) = - ik \\frac{e_\\nu}{2 }   \\frac{(k^2 - \\lambda_2 ^ 2 ) } { \\lambda_2 } \\left [ u_3 e^{\\lambda_2 z } - u_4 e^{-\\lambda_2 z } \\right ] \\mbox {    ,    } \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\hat p(z ) = -\\frac{2}{ik}\\left [ u_1 e^{k z } + u_2 e^{-kz } + u_3 e^{\\lambda_2 z } + u_4 e^{-\\lambda_2 z } \\right ]   \\mbox {    ,    } \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\hat t(z)= -   \\frac{2}{ik { \\rm ro}^2_{\\rm rz } } \\left [ k u_1 e^{k z } -ku_2 e^{-k z } + \\lambda_2 u_3 e^{\\lambda_2 z } - \\lambda_2 u_4 e^{-\\lambda_2 z } \\right]\\mbox {    .    } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the 4 constants @xmath170 are integration constants , to be determined .",

    "the presence of mixing in stellar radiative zones has long been inferred from remaining discrepancies between models - without - mixing and observations ( see pinsonneault 1997 for a review ) .",
    "the most commonly used additional mixing source is convective overshoot , whereby strong convective plumes travel beyond the radiative  convective interface and cause intense but very localised ( both in time and space ) mixing events ( brummell , clune & toomre , 2002 ) .",
    "the typical depth of the layer thus mixed , the `` overshoot layer '' , is assumed to be a small fraction of a pressure scaleheight in most stellar models .",
    "a related phenomenon is wave - induced mixing ( schatzman , 1996 ) .",
    "while most of the energy of the impact of a convective plume hitting the stably stratified fluid below is converted into local buoyancy mixing , a fraction goes into the excitation of a spectrum of gravity waves , which may then propagate much further into the radiative interior . where and when the waves eventually cause mixing ( either through mutual interactions , thermal dissipation or by transferring momentum to the large - scale flow ) depends on a variety of factors .",
    "it has recently been argued that the interaction of the gravity waves with the local azimuthal velocity field ( the differential rotation ) would dominate the mixing process ( charbonnel & talon 2005 ) , although this statement is not valid unless the wave - spectrum is near - monochromatic . for the typically flatter wave spectra self - consistently generated by convection ,",
    "wave - induced mixing has much more turbulent characteristics ( rogers , macgregor & glatzmaier 2008 ) , and is again fairly localized below the convection zone .",
    "mixing induced by large - scale flows comes in two forms : turbulent mixing resulting from instabilities of the large - scale flows , and direct transport by the large - scale flows themselves .",
    "the former case is the dominant mechanism in the early stages of stellar evolution when the star is undergoing rapid internal angular - momentum `` reshuffling '' caused by external angular - momentum extraction ( disk - locked and/or jet phase , early magnetic breaking phase ) . in these situations , regions of strong radial angular - velocity",
    "shear develop , which then become unstable and cause local turbulent mixing of both chemical species and angular momentum .",
    "studies of these processes were initiated by the work of endal & sofia ( 1978 ) .",
    "later , chaboyer & zahn ( 1992 ) refined the analysis to consider the effect of stratification on the turbulence , and showed how this can differentially affect chemical mixing and angular - momentum mixing .",
    "finally , zahn ( 1992 ) proposed the first formalism which combines mixing by large - scale flows and mixing by ( two - dimensional ) turbulence .",
    "in addition to the flows driven by angular - momentum redistribution , he also considered flows driven by the local baroclinicity of the rotating star , and showed that their effect can be represented as a hyperdiffusion term in the angular velocity evolution equation . in a quasi - steady , uniformly rotating limit , the flows described are akin to a local eddington - sweet circulation .",
    "his formalism is used today in stellar evolution models with rotation ( maeder & meynet , 2000 ) .    in all cases described above ,",
    "mixing is either localised near the base of the convection zone ( overshoot , gravity - wave mixing ) , or significant only in very rapidly rotating stars ( local eddington - sweet circulations ) or stars which are undergoing major angular - momentum redistribution ( during phases of gravitational contraction , spin - down , mass loss , etc .. ) . in this paper , we have identified another potential cause of mixing , where the original energy source is the differential rotation in the stellar convective region : gyroscopic pumping ( induced by the coriolis force associated with the differential rotation , see mcintyre 2007 ) drives large - scale meridional flows which may  under the right circumstances  penetrate the radiative region and cause a global circulation .",
    "this source of mixing is intrinsically _ non - local _ to the radiative zone .",
    "the simplest way of seeing this is to consider a thought - experiment where the radiative  convective interface is impermeable : as shown in paper i , the amplitude of the meridional flows generated locally ( i.e. below the interface ) is then much smaller than the one calculated here .",
    "the origin of the flows is also clearly independent of the baroclinicity ( since the same phenomenon is observed in the unstratified limit ) , although the flows themselves can be influenced by the stratification .",
    "this implies that they are not related to eddington - sweet flows .",
    "finally , contrary to some of the other mixing sources listed above , the one described here does not rely on the system being out - of - equilibrium : it is an inherently quasi - steady phenomenon , implying that this process is an ideal candidate for `` deep mixing '' for stars on the main sequence .",
    "the process together with the conditions under which strong mixing might occur , are now summarized and discussed .      the differential rotation observed in stellar convective envelopes ( e.g. barnes _ et al .",
    "_ 2005 ) is thought to be maintained by anisotropic reynolds stresses , arising from rotationally constrained convective eddies ( kippenhahn , 1963 ) .",
    "the details of this particular process are beyond the scope of this study , but are the subject of current investigation by others ( kitchatinov & rdiger , 1993 , 2005 ; rempel , 2005 ) .",
    "instead , we have assumed here the simplest possible type of forcing which _ mimics _ the effect of convective reynolds stresses in driving the system towards a differentially rotating state . using this model , we then derive the expected mixing caused by large - scale meridional flows .",
    "we first found that large - scale flows are indeed self - consistently driven by gyroscopic pumping in the convection zone , as expected ( mcintyre , 2007 ) .",
    "the amplitude of these flows _ within the convection zone _ scales roughly as @xmath263 where @xmath264 is the observed equator - to - pole differential rotation , @xmath265 is the stellar radius , and @xmath54 is , as discussed in section [ sec : modeleq ] , related to the ratio of the convective turnover time divided by the rotation period .",
    "note that for the sun , with @xmath266 , the typical amplitude of the corresponding meridional flows would be of the order of 200 @xmath54 m / s  which does nt seem too unreasonable given the observations of subsurface flows ( giles _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 ) and the typical values of @xmath267 in the solar convection zone ( see section [ sec : modeleq ] ) .",
    "next , we studied how much mixing these flows might induce in the underlying radiative zone .",
    "_ in this quasi - steady formalism _",
    ", we found that the magnitude of convection - zone - driven flows decays exponentially with depth below the radiative  convective interface on the lengthscale @xmath268 , where @xmath269 , as determined in section [ sec : stratrad ] ( see also gilman & miesch , 2004 and garaud & brummell , 2008 ) .",
    "this penetration corresponds ( in the linear regime ) to a so - called `` thermo - viscous '' mode .",
    "the limit @xmath270 corresponds to a strongly stratified limit , where the flow velocities are rapidly quenched beneath the convection zone .",
    "the limit @xmath271 corresponds to the weakly stratified case , where the thermo - viscous mode spans the whole radiative interior and the stratification has little effect on the flow .",
    "it is important to note that `` weakly stratified '' regions in this context can either correspond to regions with weak temperature stratification ( small @xmath246 ) , _ or _ in rapid rotation , _ or _ with small prandtl number  this distinction will be used later .",
    "the amplitude of the flows upon entering the radiative zone @xmath272 , together with @xmath268 , uniquely define the global circulation timescale in the interior ( roughly speaking , @xmath273 ) .",
    "in the weakly stratified / rapidly rotating limit , we find that the fraction of the meridional mass flux pumped in the convection zone which is allowed to _ enter _ the radiative zone is strongly constrained by taylor - proudman s theorem . this theorem , which holds when the pressure gradient and the coriolis force are the two dominant forces and are therefore in balance , enforces the invariance of all components of the flow velocities along the rotation axis .",
    "hence , flows which enter the radiative zone can not _ return _ to the convection zone unless the taylor - proudman constraint is broken . however , additional stresses ( such as reynolds stresses , viscous stresses , magnetic stresses ) are needed to break this constraint . as a result",
    ", two regimes may exist .",
    "if the ( weakly stratified / rapidly rotating ) radiative zone is in _ pure _ taylor - proudman balance , then the system adjusts itself , by adjusting the pressure field , in such a way as to ensure that the convection zone flows remain entirely within the convection zone . on the other hand ,",
    "if there are other sources of stresses somewhere in the radiative zone to break the taylor - proudman balance , then significant large - scale mixing is possible since flows entering the radiative zone are allowed to return to the convection zone .",
    "furthermore , the resulting meridional mass flux in the radiative zone depends rather sensitively on the nature of the mechanism which breaks the taylor - proudman constraint ( see next section ) .",
    "the strongly stratified / slowly rotating limit exhibits a very different behavior . because of the strong buoyancy force , the taylor - proudman balance becomes irrelevant , the flows are exponentially suppressed , and the induced radiative zone mixing is independent of the lower boundary conditions .",
    "however , note that since @xmath246 tends to 0 at a radiative  convective interface , there will always be a `` weakly stratified '' region in the vicinity of any convective zone . in that region",
    "the dynamics described in the previous paragraph apply .      in the illustrative model studied here ,",
    "the only stresses available to break the taylor - proudman constraint are viscous stresses , which are only significant within the thin ekman layer located near an artificial impermeable inner boundary .",
    "we do not advocate that this is a particularly relevant mechanism for the sun !",
    "however , it is a useful example of the sensitive dependence of the global circulation mass flux on the mechanism responsible for breaking the taylor - proudman constraint .    in the limit of weak stratification",
    ", we found that if the inner boundary is a stress - free boundary then the global turnover time within the radiative zone is the viscous timescale .",
    "this is because stress - free boundary conditions effectively suppress the ekman layer . on the other hand",
    "if the boundary layer is no - slip , then _ the global mass flux through the radiative zone is equal to the mass flux allowed to return through the ekman layer_. in that case , and according to well - known ekman layer dynamics , the overall turnover time within the bulk of the domain is the geometric mean of the viscous timescale and the rotation timescale ( @xmath274 ) , which correspond to a few million years only .",
    "going beyond simple ekman dynamics , a much more plausible related scenario for the solar interior was studied by gough & mcintyre ( 1998 ) .",
    "they considered the same mechanism for the generation of large - scale flows within the convection zone , studied how these flows down - well into the radiative zone and interact with an embedded large - scale primordial magnetic field .",
    "they showed that the field can prevent the flows from penetrating too deeply into the radiative zone , while the flows confine the field within the interior .",
    "in their model , this nonlinear interaction occurs in a thin thermo - magnetic diffusion layer , located somewhat below the radiative  convective interface .",
    "one can therefore see an emerging analogy with the dynamics discussed here : in the gough & mcintyre model , the field does act as a somewhat impermeable barrier , and provides an efficient and elegant mechanism for breaking the taylor - proudman constraint within the radiative zone .",
    "the only significant difference is that the artificial ekman layer is replaced by a more convincing thermo - magnetic diffusion layer : the mass flux allowed to down - well into the radiative zone , and mix its upper regions , is now controlled by a balance between the coriolis force and magnetic stresses ( instead of the viscous stresses ) . with this new balance , they find that the global turnover time for the circulation in the region between the base of the convection zone and the thermo - magnetic diffusion layer is of the order of a few tens of millions of years ( which is still short compared with the nuclear evolution timescale ) .",
    "this mixed region is the solar tachocline . by relating their model with observations ,",
    "gough & mcintyre were able to identify the position of the magnetic diffusion layer to be just at the base of the observed tachocline ( around @xmath275 , see charbonneau _",
    "this turns out to be close enough to the base of the convection zone for the dynamics of the radiative region to be weakly - stratified in the sense used in this paper ( see figure [ fig : lambda2 ] and section [ sec : stratspher ] ) so that the meridional flows are indeed able to penetrate , and do so with `` significant '' amplitude ( about @xmath276 cm / s ) down to the magnetic diffusion layer .",
    "however , it is rather interesting to note that the gough & mcintyre model could not have worked had today s tachocline been observed to be much thicker .",
    "it is also interesting to note that for younger , more rapidly rotating solar - type stars , a much larger region of the radiative zone can be considered `` weakly stratified '' , possibly leading to much deeper mixed regions if these stars also host a large - scale primordial field .",
    "the implications of these findings for li burning , together with a few other interesting ideas , will be discussed in a future publication .",
    "this work was funded by nsf - ast-0607495 , and the spherical domain simulations were performed on the ucsc pleiades cluster purchased with an nsf - mri grant .",
    "the authors thank n. brummell and s. stellmach for many illuminating discussions , and d. gough for the original idea .",
    "equation ( [ eq : unstr_radbc1_sol ] ) provides the solution `` far '' from the lower boundary , in the bulk of the fluid .",
    "let us refer to the limit of bulk solutions as @xmath277 as @xmath278 ( and similarly for the other quantities ) .",
    "we now derive the ekman solution close to the boundary , for the unstratified case .",
    "let s study the problem using the stream - function @xmath279 with @xmath280 moreover , let us assume that within the boundary layer , @xmath281 .",

    "<S> the solar convection zone exhibits a strong level of differential rotation , whereby the rotation period of the polar regions is about 25 - 30% longer than the equatorial regions . </S>",
