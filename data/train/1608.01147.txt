    "one of the greatest of ambitions in physics is to find a single theory where one can unify all the existing theories @xcite .",

    "a similar idea also has been considered in other branches of theoretical sciences , such as computer science .",
    "there are some difficult problems which are called np - complete where if one solves one of the np - complete problems @xcite , one will be able to solve all other problems in computer science .",
    "for example , each problem in computer science can be converted into a version of the sat problem @xcite . + moreover the above fundamental sciences",
    ", it has also been considered a new kind of the unification in statistical mechanics which has been called completeness . since all thermodynamics properties of a model can be derived from the partition function , the main idea is related to unification of the partition functions of various statistical mechanical models in the partition function of a complete model .",
    "it means that there is a specific model hamiltonian in the sense that the partition function of such a model in different regimes of coupling constants can generate the partition functions of other statistical mechanical models .",
    "+ the first complete model was introduced in an interesting paper @xcite where the authors showed that the partition function of the 2d ising model with complex interactions and magnetic field is equal to the partition function of any statistical mechanical models .",
    "it means that one can imagine the phase diagram of a 2d ising model with the magnetic field where it covers all universality classes . +",
    "although the completeness of 2d ising model is related to statistical physics , quantum information theory plays a key role for the derivation of the result .",
    "it is shown that the partition function of a spin model can be written as the inner product of two quantum states @xcite in the following form : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a product state that encodes the couplings of the spin models and @xmath3 is an entangled state that encodes the interaction pattern of the spin model . by quantum formalism , the completeness of 2d ising model is related to the universality of cluster states for measurement - based quantum computation @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a similar approach leads to other complete models like 4d @xmath4 lattice gauge theory@xcite .",
    "an extension of above results to statistical models with continuous degrees of freedom has been lead to completeness of 4d @xmath5 lattice gauge theory @xcite and 2d classical @xmath0 field theory @xcite .",
    "+ in addition to completeness , mapping between quantum information theory and statistical mechanics has also opened other interesting fields of research @xcite",
    ". however , quantum information theory usually plays the role of a middle approach for derivation of results and it is expected to find an alternative approach to can be accessible to a wider range of physicists .",
    "furthermore , such new approaches will lead to clarification of the results for quantum information theorists . for this purpose , in @xcite",
    ", authors gave an algorithmic proof for the completeness of 2d ising model without quantum formalism .",
    "furthermore in a recent paper @xcite , the new concept of the universal models has been introduced where , by a bridging to computer science , it has been shown that 2d ising model in presence of magnetic field with real coupling constants is a universal model .",
    "it means that the physics of all classical models with discrete or continuous degrees of freedom are reproduced in the low - energy sector of a 2d ising model . by such a definition ,",
    "a complete model is also a specific kind of a universal model .",

    "in addition to theoretical importance , we believe that our work has two other more advantages , simplicity and generality where it will clarify the previous result that had been derived by quantum formalism for other communities of physics as well as quantum information theorists . furthermore , our approach is algorithmic in nature where we consider a general field theory with arbitrary symmetries and arbitrary dimensions and we give a set of specific transformations on such models to convert them to a 2d @xmath0 field theory with the same partition function .",

    "we gave a step by step proof which shows how a discrete version of classical field theories and also @xmath5 lattice gauge theories on arbitrary graphs with arbitrary dimensions can be converted to a 2d classical @xmath0 field theory with the same partition function .",
    "since our result was derived by a purely mathematical method , quantum information theory which already played a key role was absent in our proof .",
    "however , we believe that our approach has this advantage that due to simplicity and generality , it leads to a general approach which can be used by various communities of physicists for future researches on similar problems .",
