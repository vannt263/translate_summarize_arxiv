    "this paper studies a natural nonlinear way for unraveling the oscillation of a function @xmath6 that is holomorphic in a neighborhood of the unit disk .",
    "our starting point is a fundamental theorem in complex analysis ( _ blaschke factorization _ ) stating that any such function can be decomposed as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a blaschke product , that is a function of the form @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are zeroes inside the unit disk @xmath12 and @xmath13 has no roots in @xmath12 .",
    "for @xmath14 we have @xmath15 which motivates the analogy @xmath16 for the function restricted to the boundary .",
    "however , the function @xmath13 need not be constant : it can be any function that never vanishes inside the unit disk .",
    "if @xmath0 has roots inside the unit disk , then the blaschke factorization @xmath17 is going to be nontrivial ( meaning @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) .",
    "@xmath13 should be simpler than @xmath0 because the winding number around the origin decreases and we will quantify this in many different ways .",
    "there is a natural way of iterating blaschke factorization that is inspired by the power series expansion of a holomorphic function in 0 .",
    "since @xmath13 has no zeroes inside @xmath12 , its blaschke factorization is the trivial one @xmath20 , however , the function @xmath21 certainly has at least one root inside the unit disk @xmath12 and will therefore yield some nontrivial blaschke factorization @xmath22 .",
    "altogether , this allows us to write @xmath23 at least formally , an iterative application gives rise to what we call the _ unwinding series _ @xmath24 this formal expansion first appeared in the phd thesis of michel nahon @xcite . given a general function @xmath0 it is not numerically feasible to actually compute the roots of the function ;",
    "a crucial insight in @xcite is that this is not necessary  one can numerically obtain the blaschke product in a stable way by using a method that was first mentioned in a paper of guido and mary weiss @xcite ( see also @xcite ) and has been investigated with respect to stability by nahon @xcite and letelier and saito @xcite . numerical investigation",
    "@xcite indicates that the formal series @xmath24 will converge to the actual function and , generically , this seems to happen at an exponential rate .",
    "the following example / picture is taken from the phd thesis of michel nahon @xcite .",
    "let us consider the blaschke factorization of a function given by the projection of a modulated gaussian on the boundary onto holomorphic functions @xmath25 fig .",
    "1 shows the curves @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 in the complex plane .",
    "a lot of the oscillation ( and almost the entire phase ) is transported from @xmath0 to @xmath8 leaving @xmath13 significantly simpler than @xmath0 .",
    "it also serves as a good example of the heuristic @xmath29 figure 1 shows the real and imaginary part of the original signal , its shape when interpreted as a curve @xmath30 and the same information for @xmath8 and @xmath13 : @xmath8 captures most of the oscillation .",
    "blaschke products have long been used in the signal analysis  often under the name _ malmquist - takenaka _ system .",
    "the crucial underlying fact is that for any two blaschke products @xmath31 the two functions @xmath32 and @xmath33 are orthogonal on @xmath34 since @xmath35 this allows naturally to build orthogonal functions via @xmath36 and contains the classical fourier system @xmath37 as a special case .",
    "we refer to papers of eisner and pap @xcite , feichtinger and pap @xcite , pap @xcite and picinbino @xcite for some examples .",
    "the unwinding series is first studied in the phd thesis of michel nahon @xcite .",
    "subsequently , a method for numerical stabilization in the case of @xmath38 becoming small has been investigated by letelier and saito @xcite .",
    "the unwinding series has been used by healy @xcite in the study of the doppler effect .",
    "of particular importance is a paper of tao qian @xcite in which he proves the convergence of the unwinding series for @xmath39 .",
    "this paper was brought to our attention after this paper had been completed and we summarize his argument below .",
    "closely related is also another approach developed by qian , ho , leong and wang @xcite ( and elaborated in further papers by qian and collaborators @xcite ) , which they call _ adaptive fourier transform_. the main idea is to use blaschke products as a library and proceed by a projection pursuit approach , where at each step one projects onto the element in the library yielding the largest inner product with the function : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is chosen among all blaschke products with @xmath42 zeroes as the one yielding the largest inner product . since , in particular , the functions @xmath43 are elements of that library , this approach may be understood as a generalization of fourier series  among their results is also an independent rediscovery of the guido and mary weiss algorithm @xcite and of the unwinding series @xcite .",
    "there are also similarities in spirit with recent work of mallat @xcite .",
    "mallat s _ scattering transform _ is a translation - invariant operator , which is lipschitz - continuous w.r.t . to @xmath44 diffeomorphisms of the underlying space .",
    "the construction is based on an iterative application of wavelet transforms followed by restriction to the modulus .",
    "our iterative application @xmath45 uses the modulus of the corresponding functions while the coefficients are given as the mean .",
    "this yields a comparable level of stability : at least the leading coefficient is stable under both perturbations of the function and reparametrization of the torus .",
    "this paper deals with holomorphic signals given as functions @xmath46 by regarding them as the restriction of a holomorphic function @xmath6 on the boundary of the unit disk @xmath47 . we will therefore use both @xmath48 and @xmath47 depending on which aspect should be emphasized .",
    "we will work with both sobolev spaces @xmath49 and hardy spaces @xmath50 ( the hilbert transform , which appears only briefly , will be @xmath51 ) .",
    "@xmath5 denotes the dirichlet space , @xmath52 the holomorphic projection .  2 states the results ,  3 gives background material and discusses some possible applications .",
    "the proofs are given in  4 .",
    "given a function @xmath6 , we define @xmath53 as the outer part in the blaschke factorization of @xmath0 @xmath54 and then , iteratively , @xmath55 as the outer part in the blaschke factorization @xmath56 we are interested in ensuring that @xmath57 in some suitable space @xmath58 and our main statements will be formulated that way .",
    "we emphasize that the formal series is , from the point of view of complex analysis , the canonical nonlinear extension of the fourier series which arises from an iterative application of @xmath59 the blaschke series , in contrast to the fourier series , proceeds by factoring out all zeroes inside @xmath12  this gives a rise to a much larger library of functions and makes it seem intuitive that one should not only expect convergence but also faster convergence than for the fourier series . at the same time , the iteration @xmath60 seems to define a very natural dynamical system on holomorphic function that could be of interest in its own right .",
    "we start ( assuming for simplicity that there are no roots on the boundary of the unit circle ) with two basic observations . recall that a general blaschke factor has the form @xmath61 suppose @xmath62 is holomorphic",
    ", @xmath63 and @xmath0 has the set of roots @xmath64 . if @xmath65 , then the roots of @xmath13 are simply @xmath66 geometrically , this means that the roots of @xmath0 outside the unit circle stay unchanged while roots inside the unit circle are inverted across the unit circle .",
    "we emphasize that in every step of the algorithm consists of studying not @xmath67 but @xmath68 , which will have a very different set of roots .",
    "however , one immediate easy consequence is the following .",
    "let @xmath62 be given by a polynomial of degree @xmath42 .",
    "then the formal series converges and is exact after @xmath42 steps .",
    "the algorithm is closed in the set of polynomials .",
    "furthermore , since @xmath69 has at least one root in @xmath70 , the degree of the polynomial decreases by at least 1 in every step .",
    "this argument is more algebraic than analytic and comes with the obvious limitation that it does not give any convergence speed ( analogously , it is not surprising that a trigonometric polynomial can be written as finite fourier series ) .",
    "an illustrative example is given by @xmath71 the blaschke factorization @xmath72 is easy to write down and @xmath73 by making @xmath74 sufficiently small , the functions @xmath0 and @xmath13 can be made as close to each other in any reasonable function space as we wish .",
    "these sort of examples immediately imply that it is not possible to construct a reasonable norm @xmath58 with @xmath75 for some universal @xmath76",
    ". exponential convergence , which is observed in practice , will therefore either not always be the case or be the consequence of an underlying phenomenon ensuring that iterative blaschke factorization can not always stay close to set of functions behaving like these polynomials .",
    "blaschke factorization only guarantees a splitting into an _ inner _ and an _",
    "function , where the inner function itself is given by multiplying a blaschke product and a singular inner function .",
    "it is not clear at this point how one would work with a singular inner function and we are restricting the further scope of the paper to functions that are holomorphic on a domain @xmath77 that contains an entire disk with radius @xmath78 , where @xmath79 can be arbitrarily small .",
    "this implies that the blaschke factorization really factors into a blaschke product and an outer product ; moreover , any ( nonzero ) function that is holomorphic in a neighborhood of the unit disk has at most finitely many roots inside the unit disk , which guarantees that all blaschke products are finite .",
    "this is not a serious restriction for applications as most signals of interest can be approximated by a trigonometric polynomial  it would be desirable to have a more complete theory from a mathematical perspective , however , at this point even the dynamics of iterative blaschke factorization on polynomials , though convergent , is far from being understood .",
    "this section presents our main convergence result .",
    "we first state the result in the most general form and comment on special cases of particular interest further below .",
    "we start by introducing two norms on the hardy space on the unit circle @xmath80 .",
    "let @xmath81 be an arbitrary monotonically increasing sequence of real numbers and let @xmath58 be the subspace of @xmath82 for which @xmath83 we define a second norm @xmath84 ( semi - norm whenever @xmath85 is not strictly increasing ) @xmath86    our main statement is that the blaschke factorization acts nicely on these spaces .",
    "the first part of our statement is known ( being ascribed to digital signal processing in @xcite ) and can be equivalently phrased as follows : given a blasche decomposition @xmath87 and assuming both functions are expanded into a fourier series @xmath88 then , for every @xmath89 @xmath90 phrased differently , inner outer factorization shifts the energy to lower frequencies in a strictly monotonous way .",
    "our main tool will be a refinement of that inequality .",
    "[ main ] if @xmath91 is holomorphic on some neighborhood of the unit disk and has a blaschke factorization @xmath87 , then @xmath92 moreover , if @xmath93 for some @xmath94 , we even have @xmath95    the most important implication is convergence of the unwinding series in the space @xmath84 if the initial data lies in @xmath58 .",
    "the argument is straight - forward : the construction of the unwinding series proceeds by setting @xmath96 and thus , by construction , the functions always have a root in @xmath97 .",
    "furthermore , adding and subtracting constants has no impact on @xmath98 because @xmath99 and therefore @xmath100 summing on both sides yields a telescoping series and thus @xmath101 which implies that @xmath102 .",
    "after @xmath42 steps , we have the equation @xmath103 and exploiting that @xmath104 , we have that @xmath105 this motivates putting special emphasis on the space @xmath58 arising from @xmath106 for which @xmath107 .",
    "this space is also known as the dirichlet space @xmath5 and has special geometric significance and structure ; for algebraic reasons we can get an even sharper inequality in that case ( see below ) . another natural ( from a geometric perspective ) space is given by @xmath108 , where @xmath109 , @xmath110 and theorem 1 can be alternatively proven using green s formula ( see below ) .",
    "all sobolev spaces @xmath111 with @xmath112 are also special cases : the statement implies that for @xmath113 with @xmath112 , we have convergence in @xmath114 .",
    "all these results have a completely analogous version on the upper half - space @xmath115 with blaschke - type products being defined on the real line @xmath116 ; even the proofs translate almost verbatim ( see below ) .",
    "the unwinding series can be phrased slightly more generally than we have done up to now : indeed , at the @xmath117th step , we could actually pick an arbitrary @xmath118 and proceed via @xmath119 clearly , @xmath120 is guaranteed to have at least one root in the unit disk because it has one in @xmath118 .",
    "theorem 1 was formulated in a completely general way ( for a general root @xmath121 ) and applies to this more general case as well ( at the cost of introducing a factor @xmath122 ) . in choosing a ` good ' value for @xmath123",
    ", one naturally encounters the quantity @xmath124 we set @xmath125 , which  in practice  does not seem to make a big difference because the factor @xmath126 ensures that the maximum can not be assumed on the boundary .",
    "while maximizing the quantity can lead to better results , we have observed that @xmath125 seems to always be doing fairly well in practice .",
    "we will assume @xmath125 throughout the rest of the paper but emphasize that the algorithm is slightly more general .",
    "one instance where this could be useful is whenever @xmath127 has a root on @xmath47 : in order not to lose information on the phase , it is desirable for the performance of the guido & mary weiss algorithm that @xmath128 for all @xmath129 . whenever this is not the case",
    ", one could use @xmath130 for a value @xmath94 close to the origin such that this function has no roots on the boundary .",
    "let us now explore the special cases with obvious geometric significance in greater detail .",
    "we identify functions @xmath0 that are holomorphic in a neighborhood of the unit disk with maps @xmath131 via @xmath132 this is motivated by the fact that in the algorithm we obtain @xmath55 not from @xmath67 but from @xmath68 and it is therefore natural to study translation - invariant ( geometric ) quantities depending on @xmath133 .",
    "let us consider a particular example @xmath134 ( taken essentially at random ) and the blaschke factorization @xmath135 ( see fig . 2 and fig .",
    "since @xmath136 has no roots in @xmath12 , the argument principle implies that @xmath136 does not wind around 0 . note that furthermore @xmath137 for all @xmath138 .",
    "as suggested by the picture ( and many others like it ) , one would expect that the length of the curve @xmath139 is , at least generically , smaller than that of @xmath140 but we have been unable to prove that ; instead , we were able to obtain that result for the natural @xmath141version of length , sometimes called the _ energy _ of a curve @xmath142 by hlder s inequality , we have that @xmath143 therefore , in particular , if the energy of a curve tends to 0 , then so will the length .",
    "algebraic simplifications allow us to quantify the decrease of the @xmath144norm of the boundary function in terms of its @xmath141norm weighted against the poisson kernel of the roots : the argument is not as sharp as the one formulated for the dirichlet space further below but is very elementary ( using green s theorem and geometric considerations ) .    [ fullformula ] let @xmath145 be holomorphic in some neighborhood of the unit disk .",
    "then , if @xmath146 are the roots of @xmath0 in @xmath12 and @xmath147 @xmath148    exploiting an additional geometric argument based on random projections and the uncertainty principle , we were able to obtain the following estimate , which controls the error in @xmath149 .",

    "we can rewrite the terms as @xmath259 @xmath260 we need to show that @xmath261 if we write @xmath262 then @xmath263 the problem consists now of evaluating @xmath264 this corresponds to integrating the vector field @xmath265 green s theorem states that this implies @xmath266 where @xmath267 is the area of the domain enclosed by the curve @xmath85 ( weighted at each point with the winding number with respect to @xmath85 ) .",
    "the previous language establishes a relationship between @xmath268 and @xmath0",
    ". however , only the _ modulus _ of @xmath0 ever appears in the argument : exploiting that @xmath269 allows for a better using of the gain obtained from iterative application of the previous lemma when inverting several roots along the unit circle .",
    "more precisely , consider again @xmath270 the crucial new ingredient is that @xmath271 the very same reason allows for a more precise analysis of the effect removing one root has .",
    "let again @xmath226 be the root ; we compare @xmath227 on the boundary @xmath47 . the same computation as",
    "before yields @xmath272 in particular , all the arising expressions can be summed in closed form and the arising gain is @xmath273    there is a difference of a factor 2 in the way we stated the carleson s formula and the proof above : this is due to the fact that we computed the effect on what turns out to be @xmath274 whereas the dirichlet space in carleson s formula also has the @xmath275norm ( which stays preserved since @xmath276 ) , hence the difference of a factor of 2 .",
    "we have @xmath277 but there is no way of turning this into a quantitative decay estimate because the gain @xmath278 put geometrically , @xmath279 may wind around @xmath280 very quickly while @xmath281 could be quite small all the time .",
    "the crucial insight is as follows : if that were actually the case and @xmath282 is small , then one would certainly hope that @xmath283 is also small .",
    "now we reverse the order of that argument : suppose that @xmath283 is _ not _ small .",
    "this means that @xmath281 is big for some @xmath284 , which does not at all mean that the function is large in @xmath4 , it could just be big in one place and very small everywhere else : this , however , would imply that the @xmath141norm of the gradient is large and we know it can not exceed that of the initial data .",
    "the second ingredient of the argument may be formulated as follows : let @xmath285 be differentiable . if @xmath286 is not very big and @xmath287 has a certain size , then @xmath288 can not be arbitrarily small ( depending on the first two quantities ) : the only way to be big in @xmath149 but small in @xmath216 is quick decay around the point where the supremum is assumed .",
    "the inequality is merely the classical embedding of the sobolev space @xmath289 .",
    "we apply the statement to a curve @xmath295 , which is different object than a periodic function @xmath285 .",
    "the natural approach to reduce one to the other would be to fix a vector @xmath296 with unit length @xmath297 and consider the projection @xmath298 the next lemma states that there exists a unit vector @xmath299 such this reduction does not change the @xmath141norm and @xmath300norm by more than an absolute constant : @xmath301      it is easy to see by cauchy - schwarz that @xmath302 varies slower than @xmath85 @xmath303 therefore , after having established the existence of such a vector @xmath42 and reparametrizing the curve in such a way that @xmath304 , we could deduce that @xmath305 which is a quantitative version of our intuition described above : in order for the function to be big at some point , it can not be too small on average .",
    "let us now prove the statement .",
    "the argument says that it is sufficient to take that vector at random to have the desired property to be true on average ( in particular , there exists at least one vector for which it is true ) .",
    "the line from the origin to @xmath310 defines a unique angle @xmath121 .",
    "let us now chose @xmath299 randomly from @xmath311 and @xmath312 .",
    "any such vector satisfies the first condition and we will now compute the expectation of the @xmath141norm for such a random vector .",
    "we first remark that for every fixed vector @xmath313 and every @xmath314 a simple computation shows that @xmath315 we now compute the expectation by using this and exchanging the order of integration @xmath316 since @xmath317 and since a random vector has that expectation , there exists at least one vector with that value .",
    "the monotonicity formula implies that @xmath318 suppose that for some @xmath42 and some @xmath319 @xmath320 we can identify @xmath321 with a curve @xmath306 and reparametrize it using our lemma so that @xmath322 and @xmath323 we can now apply our second lemma to the function @xmath324 since @xmath127 has winding number at least 1 , so has @xmath85 and therefore @xmath302 vanishes at least in two points .",
    "@xmath302 and @xmath68 have comparable @xmath325norm ( up to a factor of @xmath326 ) and comparable @xmath327norm ( up to a factor of 6 ) and elementary geometric considerations ( projections make vectors only smaller ) show that the derivative of @xmath302 satisfies @xmath328 we can now apply lemma 2 and conclude that @xmath329 where the second inequality follows from the assumption that @xmath330 and the fact that the @xmath141norm of the derivative is decreasing .",
    "now , let s look at the next step in the algorithm , where we decompose @xmath331 our inequality tells us that the squared @xmath141norm of the derivative decreases at least by a factor of ( using @xmath332 for blaschke products ) @xmath333 this yields @xmath334 for some universal constant @xmath335 .",
    "however , since all the involved quantities are nonnegative , this immediately implies that number of @xmath336 for which @xmath337 is bounded from above by @xmath338 this concludes the argument .",
    "we recall the action of removing one root which entails comparing @xmath339 as was shown in the proof of theorem [ main ] , we have the identity @xmath340 in the dirichlet space @xmath341 , we have @xmath106 and thus @xmath107 . in the proof of theorem 1",
    ", we used the monotonicity formula to remove all roots and applied the full strength of the inequality only once for a root that is in the origin . here",
    ", the special algebraic structure of the space allows us to apply the inequality multiple times _ and sum all the contributions in closed form_. the crucial ingredient that makes this possible is the algebraic identity on @xmath47 for all @xmath342 @xmath343 we will now illustrate the effect of applying the identity twice ( to remove two roots @xmath206 from @xmath12 ) .",
    "the arising functions are @xmath344 applying the identity twice yields @xmath345 normally , we would be unable to sum up these two contributions , however , here the algebraic identity implies that @xmath346 and @xmath347 this allows us to simplify @xmath348 the general case for more sums follows by the same reasoning . @xmath242 + the argument can be easily summarized as saying that the algebraic structure of @xmath341 implies that @xmath107 ; the additional algebraic ingredient is @xmath349 which implies that the various @xmath350 one gets from successive removal of roots can actually be summed up in closed form .",
    "the statement is pointwise and invariant under multiplication with polynomials having all roots outside of @xmath12 : it thus suffices to prove it for polynomials having all their roots inside of @xmath12 .",
    "we write @xmath351 obviously @xmath352 and thus @xmath353 an explicit computation yields that @xmath354 while @xmath355 altogether , this implies that if @xmath356 it remains to show that both quantities have the same norm if @xmath129 @xmath357      we imitate the argument in the case of fourier series and again study the effect of removing one root by comparing @xmath358 note that @xmath359 and therefore @xmath360 after simple computation we arrive at @xmath361.\\ ] ] writing @xmath362 as real and imaginary parts , we see that @xmath363 this implies that we can write @xmath364 and therefore with integration by parts @xmath365 which is clearly nonnegative because @xmath366 .",
