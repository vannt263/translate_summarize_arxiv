    "during the past years a great deal of attention has been devoted to the ratchet effects both for point particles @xcite and for extended systems @xcite .",

    "ratchet - like systems such as systems of two particle with internal degree of freedom @xcite , periodic rocket ratchets ( deterministic and stochastic ) @xcite and temperature ratchets @xcite , have also been considered . for infinite dimensional systems described by nonlinear partial differential equations ( pde ) of soliton type",
    ", ratchet phenomena were investigated both in the case of asymmetric potentials in presence of symmetric forces @xcite , and in the case of symmetric potentials with asymmetric forces @xcite . in both cases the ratchet phenomenon manifests as an unidirectional motion of the soliton , similar to the drift motion occurring for point particle ratchets ( from here the name of soliton ratchets ) .",
    "a symmetry approach to the phenomenon , which allows to establish conditions for the occurrence of soliton ratchets , was developed in ref .",
    "this approach , although useful for predicting the phenomenon , does not provide information about the actual mechanism responsible for the unidirectional motion .",
    "the mechanism underlying soliton ratchets was recently proposed by two of us for the case of a perturbed asymmetric double sine - gordon equation driven by symmetric forces @xcite , and extended in ref .",
    "@xcite to the case of a perturbed sine gordon system in presence of asymmetric drivers . in both cases",
    "the phenomenon was ascribed to the existence of an internal mode mechanism which , in presence of damping , is able to couple soliton internal vibrations to the translational mode , producing in this way transport .",
    "the phenomenon was described as follows : the energy pumped by the ac force into the soliton internal mode is converted into net dc motion by the coupling of the internal vibration with the center of mass induced by the damping .",
    "this internal mode mechanism was confirmed by numerical and analytical investigations for the case of the sine gordon system with asymmetric periodic forces @xcite and by direct numerical investigations for the case of soliton ratchets of the asymmetric double sine - gordon equation @xcite . in the last case , a detailed numerical investigation ( see @xcite ) showed the following facts :    * ( i ) * the presence of damping and the asymmetry of the potential are both crucial ingredients for the existence of the net motion of the soliton ( in presence of the ac force , but in absence of damping , the asymmetry of the potential does not produce transport ) . *",
    "( ii ) * the effect of the damping is to couple the internal vibrations of the kink to the motion of the center of mass . * ( iii ) * for fixed values of the amplitude and frequency of the ac force there is an optimal value of the damping for which the transport is maximal . *",
    "( iv ) * the direction of the motion is fixed by the asymmetry of the potential and is independent on initial conditions . *",
    "( v ) * for fixed values of the damping the average velocity of the kink shows a resonant behavior as a function of the frequency of the ac force . *",
    "( vi ) * at low damping and higher forcing strengths , current reversals in the kink dynamics can occur .",
    "this phenomena was ascribed in ref .",
    "@xcite to the soliton - phonon interaction rather than to the internal mode mechanism .",
    "these points were found to be valid also for different soliton ratchet systems @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the existence of an optimal value of the damping constant which maximizes the transport , was ascribed to the relativistic nature of the kink dynamics and the possibility of nonzero currents in absence of damping , was also found . since most of the analysis of ref .",

    "@xcite as well as points * ( i ) * - * ( vi ) * listed above . to this end , we use perturbation theory and a collective coordinate ansatz for the soliton shape to derive ordinary differential equations ( ode ) for the center of mass and for the soliton width . we show that , to second order of perturbation theory , soliton width vibrations couple _ effectively _ to the motion of the center of mass via the damping in the system . by using the collective coordinate equations we are able to derive an analytical expression of the mean drift velocity of the kink as a function of the system parameters .",

    "it is not difficult to check that @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) for @xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) and that @xmath63 vanishes at @xmath68 .",
    "third , from ( [ solx2a ] ) we also see that for a given frequency there is an optimal value of the damping to achieve the maximal mean velocity ( see fig .  4 of @xcite ) .",
    "this optimal value can be easily calculated as a function of @xmath42 and @xmath35 ( see the solid line of fig .",

    "( [ solx2a ] ) we can not change the sign of the average velocity .",
    "this feature confirms the prediction of @xcite , where the rectification of the movement for small damping and large amplitude of the ac force was related to the excitation of phonons for a given choice of parameters .    moreover ,",
    "the existence of a resonant behavior of the mean velocity as a function of the frequency @xmath42 is also qualitatively confirmed by eq .",
    "( [ solx2a ] ) . as reported in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see fig .  6 of this paper ) , @xmath71 becomes maximum when @xmath42 approaches the internal mode frequency @xmath72 .",
    "this agreement , however , is only qualitative since the resonant peak is very close to the edge of the phonon band so that phonons are easily excited in the system .",
    "in fact , eq . ( [ soll1 ] ) together with eq .",
    "( [ soll2 ] ) show that the kink oscillates with two frequencies @xmath42 and @xmath73 .",
    "close to the resonance @xmath74 one is inside the phonon band so that phonons get excited and the cc analysis becomes unaccurate .",

    "a straightforward calculation shows that the same result is true also at order @xmath86 .",
    "this implies that the ratchet effect in the zero - damping case does not exist .",
    "as we will see in the next section , this conclusion is confirmed by numerical simulations of eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "the cc analysis of the previous section neglects the presence of phonons in the system and is based on a particular _ ansatz _ for the soliton shape in eq .",

    "( [ cc1])-([cc3 ] ) with the routine divprk of the imsl library @xcite which uses the runge - kutta - verner sixth order method .",
    "figures  [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] show the mean velocity dependence on the damping coefficient for different values of the amplitude and frequency of the ac force . from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we see that for low values of @xmath4 there is a very good agreement between the cc results and pde simulations in the whole range of @xmath2 .",

    "we show the same dependence for an higher value of the driver frequency ( @xmath92 ) .",
    "we see that although the approximated solution ( [ solx2a ] ) and the numerical solution of the cc equations are quite close , there is a discrepancy with the pde results starting from the peak and extending to higher values of @xmath2 , this indicating that the cc _ ansatz _ is valid only for @xmath93 ( @xmath94 for @xmath95 ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig - alphaopt ] , we check eq .",
    "( [ alphaopt ] ) for the optimal value @xmath96 of the damping constant for @xmath95 .",
    "we can see that this value increase up to @xmath97 and after that @xmath96 decreases .",
    "again , a good agreement between the cc theory and pde results is found at small @xmath42 values .    by increasing the amplitude @xmath4 of the driver , reversal of current",
    "can also occur @xcite .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4-sal ] from which we see that as @xmath2 is increased the mean velocity computed from pde simulations displays a crossover from negative to positive values ( i.e. a current reversal occurred ) .",
    "this phenomenon is described neither by the cc analysis ( notice that eq .",
    "( [ solx2a ] ) predicts a positive average velocity for all @xmath67 ) , nor by the numerical solutions of the cc analysis depicted in the figure .",
    "this agrees with the claim made in ref .",
    "@xcite that reversal currents do not depend on the internal mode mechanism , but rather on the existence of phonons in the system . in order to show the presence of phonon modes when this phenomenon appears , we have plotted in fig .",
    "[ dft1 ] the discrete fourier transform ( dft ) of the kink s width @xmath23 ( obtained from the numerical simulations of the pde equation ) for two values of @xmath2 , i.e. @xmath98 ( before crossover occurs ) and @xmath99 ( inside the rectified motion region ) . in the former case ( upper panel ) ,",
    "one of the frequencies of the oscillations of @xmath23 lies inside the phonon band , so phonons are clearly excited . in the latter case ( lower panel ) the main frequencies of the spectrum are well below the lower phonon edge ( @xmath100 ) . from this",
    "we conclude that phonon modes are important for current reversals and a theory based on the internal mode alone ( as the one presented here ) can not describe properly this phenomenon .",
    "+    in ref .",
    "@xcite a resonant behavior of mean velocity as a function of @xmath42 was also reported ( see the peak of @xmath71 at @xmath101 in fig .  3 of this paper ) .",
    "this feature is also confirmed by eq .",
    "( [ solx2a ] ) ( notice that the denominator of this expression has a minimum at @xmath102 ) although , in this case , the agreement with pde results is only qualitative .",
    "this is shown in fig.[fig3-sal ] from which we see the presence of a resonant structure , with good agreement at small frequencies and large deviations from pde results at higher @xmath103 values .",
    "the agreement at low frequencies can be understood from the fact that phonons in this case are hardly excited and the cc description becomes accurate . on the contrary , when @xmath42 gets close to the resonant peak , phonons are easily excited and the cc analysis becomes unadequate .",
    "we have also investigated the dependence of the phenomenon on the asymmetry parameter @xmath35 as well as the importance of the damping term for soliton ratchets . in fig .",
    "[ vel - lamb ] we show the mean velocity as a function of @xmath35 for fixed system parameters and two different values of @xmath2 .",
    "we see that the curve is anti - symmetric around the origin meaning that the sign of @xmath35 determines the direction of motion , the maximal effect occurring around @xmath104 , i.e. the point of maximal asymmetry of the potential .",
    "finally , we have investigated the zero damping limit of the phenomenon . in fig.[fig3 ] we depict the time evolution of the center of mass of the kink for @xmath76 and for different values of the initial condition phase @xmath105 of the ac force .",
    "we see that @xmath22 is basically a linear function of time , whose slope depends on @xmath106 .",
    "this implies that , in this case , is the initial phase which determines the direction of the motion and not only the asymmetry of the potential , as predicted by the cc analysis . since in most experimental contexts",
    "initial phase are usually unknown , one must consider the phase as a random variable and take average on it .",
    "this obviously implies that soliton ratchets can not exist in the zero - damping limit .",
    "in this paper we have studied the ratchet dynamics of the kink solution of the adsge by using a collective coordinate approach with two collective variables , the center of mass and the width of the kink . for these variables",
    "we have obtained a system of odes from which we derived an approximated expression for the mean velocity of the kink as a function of the system parameters .",
    "we have confirmed that the cc approach is valid when phonons are not excited in the system , i.e. for small values of @xmath4 and for @xmath93 .",
    "we have shown that for a proper description of soliton ratchets it is not enough to consider the kink as a point particle moving in a ratchet potential @xcite , but it is crucial to include also the internal oscillations of the kink profile . in particular , we have shown that the net motion of the kink becomes possible when its internal and translational modes become _ effectively _ coupled ( the effective coupling being possible only in presence of damping ) .",
    "we also showed that the asymmetry of the potential determines the direction of the motion and that in the zero - damping case the ratchet effect vanishes ( i.e. it depends on initial conditions ) .",
    "the resonant behavior of the velocity as a function of frequency and damping was also investigated .",
    "we found that the mean velocity approach a maximum value when the frequency of the ac force goes to the internal mode frequency or when the damping coefficient approach its optimal value .",
    "finally , we have shown that the occurrence of current reversal is related to the presence of phonons in the system rather than the coupling between the translational and the internal mode .",
