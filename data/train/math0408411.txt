    "legendrian contact homology has been an effective tool in studying legendrian submanifolds in @xmath7 in @xmath8 , chekanov @xcite and eliashberg and hofer ( unpublished but see @xcite ) used contact homology to show that legendrian knots are not determined up to legendrian isotopy by the so - called classical invariants ( topological isotopy class , thurston - bennequin number , and maslov class ) .",
    "subsequently , contact homology has been used to greatly illuminate the nature of legendrian knots in @xmath9 the contact homology of legendrian submanifolds in @xmath10 ( for @xmath11 ) was given a rigorous foundation in @xcite and its efficacy was demonstrated in @xcite . very roughly speaking contact homology is the homology of a differential graded algebra ( dga ) associated to a legendrian submanifold @xmath12 .",
    "the algebra is generated by double points in the ( lagrangian ) projection of @xmath13 into @xmath5 and the differential counts rigid holomorphic disk with corners at these double points and boundary on the projected legendrian submanifold . in the initial definition of contact homology",
    "the disks were counted modulo 2 since in that version of the theory orientations and orientability of spaces of holomorphic disks need not be considered .",
    "a @xmath4-lift of contact homology of legendrian knots in @xmath8 have been introduced in a purely combinatorial fashion in @xcite .",
    "it is however still not known if the oriented version of the theory in this case is any stronger that the unoriented version of the theory .",
    "orientations for the moduli space of certain riemann surfaces without boundary has been discussed in @xcite . in this paper",
    "we show how to lift the dga of legendrian submanifolds , of @xmath14 , which are spin to @xmath4 .",
    "we demonstrate that this lift gives a more refined invariant of legendrian isotopy than does the theory over @xmath2 in dimensions @xmath15 . for legendrian knots in @xmath8 ,",
    "our analytical approach to orientations recovers the combinatorial sign rule of @xcite and furthermore gives rise to another combinatorial sign rule not mentioned there .",
    "we also use legendrian contact homology to produce lower bounds on the double points of exact lagrangian immersions into @xmath16 ( a lagrangian immersion @xmath17 is _ exact _ if the closed form @xmath18 , where @xmath19 are standard coordinates on @xmath20 is exact . ) generically an exact lagrangian immersion can be lifted to a legendrian embedding .",
    "a dga is called good if it is ( tame ) isomorphic to a dga without constant terms in its differential @xcite .",
    "we show that if @xmath17 is an exact self - transverse lagrangian immersion of a closed manifold such that the dga associated to a legendrian lift of @xmath21 is good then the number @xmath22 of double points of @xmath21 satisfies @xmath23 where @xmath24 or @xmath25 for any prime @xmath26 if @xmath6 is spin and where @xmath27 otherwise .",
    "it is easy to construct exact lagrangian immersions of spheres and tori of arbitrary dimensions which shows that the estimate is the best possible .",
    "while the hypothesis on the exact lagrangian immersion seems somewhat unnatural it is frequently satisfied and from anecdotal evidence one would expect exact lagrangian immersions with non - good dga s to have more double points than ones with good dga s . despite this evidence it does not seem straightforward to use contact homology for estimates when the algebra is not good .",
    "however , we prove that if one can establish an estimate like with any fixed constant subtracted from the right hand side then is true too .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : basnot ] we introduce basic notions which will be used throughout the paper . in section [ sec : orimdli ] we show how to orient moduli spaces of holomorphic disks relevant to contact homology . to accomplish this we discuss orientations of determinant bundles over spaces of ( stabilized ) @xmath28-operators associated to legendrian submanifolds and their interplay with orientions of spaces of conformal structures on punctured disks .",
    "similar constructions are carried out in @xcite but some of the details differ . in section [ sec : legch ] we define the dga associated to a legendrian spin submanifold @xmath13 as an algebra over @xmath29 $ ] with differential @xmath30 and prove that @xmath31 .",
    "furthermore we prove the invariance of contact homology under legendrian isotopy by a mixture of a homotopy method and the more direct bifurcation analysis , making use of the stabilization mentioned above .",
    "( over @xmath2 this invariance proof gives an alternative to the invariance proof given in @xcite . )",
    "we also describe how the contact homology depends on the choice of spin structure of the legendrian submanifold and we derive diagrammatic sign rules for legendrian knots in @xmath8 . in section [ sec : lmt ] , we adapt a theorem of floer @xcite to our situation so that , in special cases , the differential in contact homology can be computed .",
    "we also apply these results to construct examples which demonstrates that contact homology over @xmath4 is more refined than contact homology over @xmath2 . in section [ sec : dbpt ] we prove the results related to the double point estimate for exact lagrangian immersion mentioned above .",

    "this construction is clearly continuous in @xmath138 .      to compute signs in contact homology we need to compare the orientation on @xmath87 induced from the orientation on @xmath172 and the orientation on @xmath87 induced by a diagram trivialization . to this end",
    "we look at the details of basic orientations to derive the shading rules .",

    "all capping operators oriented we orient all the bundles @xmath87 over @xmath1428 we next describe how the choices of orientation of @xmath88 changes canonical orientations .",
    "recall that the canonical orientation on the determinant bundle over trivialized boundary conditions on the @xmath78-punctured disk was defined by , after deformation , expressing the operator as an operator over @xmath1429 with constant @xmath642 boundary conditions and an operator over @xmath439 with complex kernel or cokernel attached at the origin of @xmath1429 .",
    "the kernel and cokernel of the latter gets oriented by viewing them as complex vector spaces .",
    "now if the orientation of @xmath88 is switched then the orientation of each odd dimensional complex vector space changes and the orientation of each even dimensional complex vector space remains the same .",
    "since the dimension of the kernel and cokernel of the operator over @xmath1429 with constant @xmath642 boundary conditions is 2 and 0 , respectively , the effect on the canonical orientations is as follows : changing the orientation of @xmath88 changes the canonical orientation for each operator of index @xmath1430 and keeps the orientation of each operator of index @xmath1431 . recall the index of the operators @xmath1432 are @xmath1433 respectively . fix an orientation of @xmath88 .",
    "consider @xmath1434 with one positive odd corner and with a diagram orientation which agrees with that of the boundary of the disk .",
    "pick the orientation of the determinant bundle over @xmath1423 such that when gluing @xmath1382 to the trivialized boundary condition just described the orientation induced on @xmath87 agrees with the one induced on @xmath87 by the bundle @xmath172 of linearized conformal structures .",
    "note that the operator obtained by gluing @xmath1382 has index @xmath636 and hence the same choice of orientation works also for the other orientation of @xmath88 .",
    "denote this orientation @xmath1435    [ lma1punct ] let @xmath1434 be any disk with any diagram orientation .",
    "the orientation induced on the fiber of @xmath87 over @xmath138 obtained by gluing @xmath1382 with orientation @xmath1435 agrees with the orientation induced by @xmath1436    there are two possible diagram orientations for such a disk . for diagram orientations which can be obtained continuously from the diagram orientation given above",
    "the lemma is clear . to see that the lemma holds also for other diagram trivializations we need only check it for one . to this end",
    "we rotate the first coordinate of the glued boundary condition by @xmath337 .",
    "this transports the canonical orientation to the canonical orientation and the orientation of the capping disk to the right orientation .",
    "moreover , it preserves the orientation on the @xmath636-dimensional kernel of the @xmath28-operator on the one punctured disk .",
    "thus the induced orientations on @xmath138 with the two different diagram trivializations must be the same .",

    "for the choice of basic orientations @xmath1442 , @xmath1435 , and @xmath1443 we have @xmath1444 where @xmath1445 is the number of b - shaded punctures in the diagram orientation .",
    "we will prove this lemma by induction on the number of punctures in the disk . as a `` base case '' we must understand the orientations on one- and two - punctured disks .",
    "the lemma for the disk with one positive odd puncture and no other punctures is simply a restatement of lemma [ lma1punct ] .",
    "fix an orientation @xmath1446 on @xmath88 . to determine the sign of an arbitrary diagram orientation we will use orientations of @xmath72-dimensional moduli spaces and in particular lemma  [ lmamorient ] .",
    "more precisely , we consider holomorphic disks with several convex and one concave corner .",
    "exactly as above one may use capping disks to orient the one - parameter family of disks in which it lives . for such model families",
    "lemma [ lmamorient ] relating various orientations hold . to determine the sign of the disk with one even positive corner and one odd negative corner , consider the disk with one concave ( even ) corner shown in figure  [ fig : signs1 ] .",
    "it is easy to arrange a one - parameter family    which splits as follows .",

    "one choice of orientation @xmath1439 yields the a - shading rule and the other one @xmath1453 the b - shading rule .",
    "note that the operator obtained by capping off @xmath248 has index @xmath78 and hence its canonical orientation changes with @xmath1446 .",
    "since the gluing of @xmath1382 and @xmath1380 also gives an operator of index @xmath78 also @xmath1454 changes with the orientation of @xmath88 and thus @xmath1439 and @xmath1453 are independent of @xmath1446 .",
    "we have chosen orientations on the determinate line bundles over @xmath1424 and @xmath1423 so that the lemma is true for the cases considered so far .",
    "to finish the `` base case '' of our induction we are left to check that the lemma holds for disks @xmath1455 and @xmath1456 with one positive odd puncture and one negative even puncture .",
    "arguing as in the above paragraph we see that the two configurations of such disks must have opposite signs .",
    "moreover , with respect to one choice of signs on these disks the a - shading rule in the lemma is correct with respect to the other the b - shading rule is .",
    "we finish the base case by checking that a change of @xmath1446 changes the signs of @xmath1455 and @xmath1456 .",
    "note that the operator obtained by capping off @xmath1455 has index index @xmath636 .",
    "thus its canonical orientation is not affected by @xmath1446 . however , the operator obtained by gluing @xmath1381 and @xmath1379 has index @xmath78 so the orientation @xmath1457 on @xmath1422 induced from @xmath1439 changes with @xmath1446 .",
    "it follows that there is a choice @xmath1458 so that the a - shading rule holds in all base cases .",
    "moreover , with @xmath1442 we find since @xmath1459 that the induced orientation @xmath1460 on @xmath1422 satisfies @xmath1461 and that the b - shading rule applies in all base cases for @xmath1462 .",
    "to finish the proof we use the same argument in both cases . for simplicity",
    "we give it only in the case of a - shading .",
    "assume by induction that the lemma is true for all disks with @xmath0 punctures .",
    "let @xmath138 be a disk with @xmath1463 punctures .",
    "if the puncture counterclockwise of the positive puncture is odd then we can glue a once punctured disk @xmath87 to it .",
    "one of the four possible cases if shown in figure  [ fig : signs2 ] .",
    "we will finish the argument in this case .",
    "the remaining cases are similar .",
    "the one dimensional moduli space formed by this gluing also splits into an @xmath0 punctured disk @xmath1464 and a twice punctured disk @xmath1465 by induction we know the sign of @xmath1464 is @xmath1466 where @xmath1467 is the number of @xmath45-shaded regions in @xmath1468 moreover , the sign of @xmath1449 is @xmath1450 thus lemma  [ lmamorient ] implies @xmath1469 note the number of @xmath45-shaded regions of @xmath138 is @xmath1470 thus the lemma holds for @xmath1351 an entirely analogous argument works if the puncture counterclockwise of the positive puncture of @xmath138 is even .",
    "the only difference is one must glue a twice punctured disk to @xmath1351 ( note in this case one must actually have determined the signs on thrice punctured disks , but this may be done as in the previous paragraph by noting that at least one of the punctures must be odd . )",
