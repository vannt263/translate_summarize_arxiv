    "mild excesses of events compared to the standard model ( sm ) background in both channels for lqs with mass around 650 gev were observed .",
    "currently , these excesses have attracted considerable attention in the literature @xcite .    for the first generation lq ,",
    "a more stringent limit comes from atlas . with 20 fb@xmath6 of integrated luminosity at the 8 tev lhc",

    "most of the experimental analyses use the fixed order ( fo ) result for the lq pair production cross section computed at the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) of qcd  @xcite . at fo ,",
    "@xmath25 contributions consist of real qcd emissions from the born subprocesses and the interference between the born diagrams and the one - loop corrected born diagrams .",
    "however , to get a more realistic picture of the final state particles , one has to combine the fo nlo results with parton showers ( ps ) that consistently resum large logarithmic terms in the collinear limit , thereby expanding the coverage of the kinematical region . in this paper",
    ", we compute the pair production of scalar lqs at the nlo of qcd accuracy ; i.e. , we analyze the @xmath25 corrections to the following leading order ( lo ) partonic subprocess at the lhc , .",

    "compared to fo calculations , matching with the ps improves the accuracy of theoretical estimations of various kinematic distributions .",
    "these improved and more precise distributions can play a crucial role if advanced techniques like multivariate analysis are employed to separate lq signal from sm background or differentiate lqs from other bsm candidate with similar signatures ( like leptogluons for example ) .",
    "while matching the fo nlo results with ps , we use the mc@nlo formalism @xcite that avoids double counting in the hard and collinear regions at the nlo level by adding suitable counterterms . as our nlo+ps computation",
    "is performed using the madgraph5_amc@nlo framework @xcite , it is flexible to any choice of cuts , scales , parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) , etc .",

    "we make use of the nloct package @xcite to calculate the uv counterterms within the on - shell renormalization scheme and to determine the rational @xmath38 terms required for the opp reduction .",

    ", we estimated its contribution to be @xmath41 10% of the lo qcd mediated contribution for @xmath39 as large as 0.5 at the 8 tev lhc  @xcite . for higher generations , it would be even smaller because of the relative suppression of the initial pdfs . hence , all our cross section estimations are essentially model independent and are equally applicable for model b too .",

    "our computation provides a reliable and completely automated code that goes beyond computing the nlo @xmath2-factor by simulating signal events at the qcd nlo(+ps ) level and improves the precision of various kinematic distributions .",
