    "two of the main tools in order to analyze and describe lvy processes are the characteristic exponent and the blumenthal  getoor index . in the present paper , we show that there exist analogous of these concepts for a much wider class of processes , namely homogeneous diffusions with jumps ( h.d.w.j . ) in the sense of jacod and shiryaev ( @xcite , definition iii.2.18 ) .",
    "these indices are used to derive growth and h \" older conditions for the paths of the process .",
    "a lvy process @xmath2 is a stochastic process with stationary and independent increments which has a.s .",
    "cdlg paths ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . it is a well - known fact that the characteristic function of @xmath3 can be written as @xmath4 where the characteristic exponent @xmath5 is a continuous negative definite function ( c.n.d.f . ) in the sense of schoenberg ( cf .",
    "@xcite , chapter 2 ) .",
    "in fact , one obtains by the relation ( [ charexp ] ) a one - to - one correspondence between the class of c.n.d.f.s and lvy processes . the blumenthal ",
    "getoor index was first introduced in @xcite in order to analyze h \" older conditions , the @xmath6-variation and the hausdorff - dimension of the paths of lvy processes .",
    "the idea of the present paper is to use the state - space dependent right derivative at @xmath7 of the characteristic function to obtain the symbol @xmath8 of the process which generalizes the characteristic exponent of a lvy process .",
    "the formula reads as follows ( for details , see definition [ defsymbol ] below ) : for @xmath9 @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the first - exit time of a compact neighborhood of @xmath12 . since for every fixed @xmath13 ,",
    "the function @xmath14 is the characteristic function of the random variable @xmath15 it is continuous and positive definite . by corollary 3.6.10 of @xcite",
    ", we conclude that @xmath16 is a continuous negative definite function . dividing by @xmath17 preserves this property since the c.n.d.f.s form a convex cone . by lemma 3.6.7 of @xcite ,",
    "the above limit is a negative definite function which is continuous if the convergence is locally uniform .",
    "the idea to analyze objects of this type was proposed first in @xcite in the context of universal markov processes .",
    "we have thus shown that the symbol is a state - space dependent c.n.d.f .",
    "therefore , we can define and analyze eight indices along the same lines as in schilling s article @xcite where the case of rich feller processes was analyzed .",
    "these are feller processes with the property that the test functions @xmath18 are contained in the domain of their generator .",
    "the multiplier in the fourier representation of the generator of such a process is also a state - space dependent c.n.d.f .",
    "( cf . example [ exfeller ] below and for details the monograph by jacob @xcite ) . for these c.n.d.f.s",
    ", we write @xmath19 to distinguish them from the @xmath20 above . in order to introduce and use the indices , schilling needed the following two conditions ( [ growth ] ) and ( [ sector ] ) which we state here since they play a role in our considerations , too .",
    "the growth condition is fulfilled , if there exists a @xmath21 such that    @xmath22    for every @xmath23 .",
    "the sector condition , which is needed only for some of the results , is fulfilled , if there exists a @xmath24 such that for every @xmath9    @xmath25    in @xcite , we have shown that every rich feller process is an it process in the sense of cinlar , jacod , protter and sharpe ( cf .",
    "@xcite , section 7 ) , that is , a hunt semimartingale with characteristics of the form    @xmath26 where for every @xmath27 @xmath28 is a vector in @xmath29 , @xmath30 is a positive semi - definite matrix and @xmath31 is a borel transition kernel such that @xmath32 .",
    "the triplet @xmath33 appears in the symbol again ( cf . theorem [ thmstoppedsymbol ] ) .",
    "since the characteristics describe the local dynamics of the process , it is not surprising that the symbol , as well as the associated indices , contain a lot of information about the global and the path properties of the process , like conservativeness ( cf .",
    "@xcite , theorem 5.5 ) , strong @xmath6-variation ( cf .",
    "@xcite , corollary 5.10 ) or hausdorff - dimension ( cf .",
    "@xcite , theorem 4 ) . by now , all results of this type were restricted to rich feller processes .",
    "the above considerations show that it processes would be a natural candidate to generalize the results on symbols , indices and fine properties . in the present paper",
    "we go even one step further : semimartingales having characteristics of the form ( [ hdwj ] ) are called h.d.w.j .",
    "it is this class we are dealing with . in section [ sec2 ]",
    ", we have included an example of this kind , which is not a markov process . philosophically speaking we show that the symbol , as well as the derived indices , are a concept related to the underlying semimartingale structure rather than the property of being memoryless . to this end , new techniques of proof had to be developed .    here and in the following , we mean by a stochastic process a family of processes @xmath34 which is normal , that is , @xmath35 .",
    "such a process is called a martingale , continuous , ",
    "iff it is w.r.t .",
    "every @xmath36 @xmath37 a martingale , continuous , @xmath38 . a  stochastic basis @xmath39 is always meant to be in the background .",
    "we assume that the usual hypotheses are satisfied .    before closing this section",
    ", we give an overview on what was known before the present paper .",
    "we consider the following classes of processes : @xmath40 the symbol was generalized to it processes in @xcite .",
    "the indices were known for rich feller processes satisfying ( [ growth ] ) and ( [ sector ] ) .",
    "fine properties were obtained for the same class , sometimes under additional assumptions ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . let us mention that even in the known case of rich feller processes we generalize schilling s results : instead of ( [ growth ] ) we only need a local version of this property which is automatically fulfilled by every rich feller process .",
    "let us give a brief outline on how the paper is organized : in the subsequent section we show that there exists a h.d.w.j . which is not markovian .",
    "in particular the last inclusion in ( [ display ] ) is strict . in section [ sec3 ]",
    "we present the definitions and main results .",
    "complementary results and several examples , including the cogarch process which is used to model financial data , are contained in section [ sec4 ] .",
    "the proofs are postponed to section [ sec5 ] , since they are rather technical .",
    "our main results are theorems [ thmstoppedsymbol ] , [ thmttoinfty ] and [ thmtto0 ] .",
    "the notation we are using is more or less standard .",
    "vectors are column vectors",
    ". transposed vectors or matrices are denoted by @xmath41 .",
    "vector entries are written as follows : @xmath42 . in the context of semimartingales",
    "we follow mainly @xcite .",
    "multivariate stochastic integrals are always meant componentwise .",
    "this is true for integrals w.r.t .",
    "processes as well as for those w.r.t . random measures . a function @xmath43 is called cut - off function if it is borel measurable , with compact support and equal to one in a neighborhood of zero . in this case",
    "@xmath44 is a truncation function in the sense of @xcite .",
    "finally , let @xmath45 .",
    "virtually all examples of homogeneous diffusions ( with or without jumps ) in the literature are markov processes . here",
    "we construct an example which is not markovian .",
    "we use the construction principle for deterministic processes which we introduced in @xcite and generalized in @xcite .",

    "is called homogeneous diffusion with jumps , but even there this name was qualified as ` misleading ' , since the term ` diffusion ' is often used for continuous markov processes : a diffusion with jumps is not continuous and in section [ sec2 ] we have seen that it does not have to be markovian . however , we decided to stick to the classical name , since it has become canonical .    in our considerations , it turned out that the most general assumption on the differential characteristics , under which we are able to prove our main results , read as follows",
