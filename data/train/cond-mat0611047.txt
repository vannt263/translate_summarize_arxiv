    "after associating molecules , remaining atoms can be pushed out of the trap using the radiation pressure of applied laser light @xcite .",
    "the dipole trap used here is much deeper than the photon recoil energy , so that the blast light must drive a closed cycling transition , which is not possible when starting from the state @xmath19 .",
    "hence , a first light field ( the  pump light \" ) optically pumps the atoms from @xmath19 to @xmath75 .",
    "a second light field ( the  cycling light \" ) then drives a cycling transition .",
    "we only drive transitions on the @xmath76 resonance line at @xmath77  nm .",
    "as the blast light is applied while the atoms are in a magnetic field of 1005.8  g , some effort is needed to obtain light stabilized at the required frequencies .",
    "two frequency - stabilized lasers are already in use in the experiment for operating the magneto - optical trap ( mot ) : one is locked close to the mot transition @xmath78 and another laser is locked to the repump transition @xmath79 . quantum numbers with a prime refer to excited states .",
    "the cycling laser resonantly drives the @xmath80 transition @xmath81 at 1005.8  g , which is 1405  mhz blue detuned from the @xmath82 mot transition .",
    "note that at 1005.8  g , the relevant ground states are characterized by good quantum numbers @xmath83 , while the excited states are characterized by good quantum numbers @xmath84 .",
    "a beat lock stabilizes the frequency of the cycling laser relative to the mot laser .    in order to deplete the state @xmath19 ,",
    "we use pump light that is 62  mhz red detuned from the @xmath82 repump transition . the light is obtained from the repump laser using an acousto - optical modulator ( aom ) and resonantly drives the @xmath85 transition @xmath86 at 1005.8  g.    from the excited state populated by this pump light , atoms can decay back to the initial state , into the desired state @xmath75 or into the undesired state @xmath87 .",
    "the experiment shows , that the branching ratio for decay into the undesired state is only a few percent .",
    "still , we use a third light field to deplete this state .",
    "we use another aom to obtain light that is 87  mhz red detuned from the @xmath82 mot transition .",
    "this light resonantly drives the @xmath80 transition @xmath88 at 1005.8  g.    note that the excited state @xmath89 can not decay into ground states with @xmath90 , because at 1005.8  g the quantum number @xmath91 is conserved during the decay and the @xmath92 ground state does not have sub - states with @xmath93 .",
    "all three blast fields are operated a factor of ten or more above saturation intensity .",
    "they are on simultaneously .",
    "the trap depth is a few microkelvin , so that approximately five directed photon recoil momenta should add sufficient kinetic energy for an atom to leave the trap .",
    "this momentum should be accumulated after @xmath94s .",
    "the estimated acceleration is @xmath95  m / s@xmath96 , so that the cloud radius of @xmath97 m is estimated to be traversed in @xmath98s .",
    "but the experiment shows that the blast light needs to be on for @xmath99s , in order to remove all atoms from the trap .",
    "the origin of this discrepancy is unclear .",
    "application of the three blast beams reduces the molecule number by approximately 30% . a recent experiment , performed after the measurements reported here , demonstrated that atoms can be removed by applying a microwave field and only the cycling laser @xcite .",
    "this has the advantage that the loss of molecules during application of the blast light becomes negligible @xcite ."

    "<S> the molecule number decays as a function of hold time between association of the molecules and release from the trap . </S>",
    "<S> the loss of molecules from the trap can be described by the rate equation @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the particle densities of atoms and molecules and @xmath0 and @xmath1 are the loss - rate coefficients caused by inelastic atom - molecule and molecule - molecule collisions , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath24 represents molecule loss mechanisms which do not rely on collisions with other cold atoms or molecules . </S>",
    "<S> such loss could be caused by background gas collisions , photo - dissociation by the dipole - trap light , or spontaneous decay into lower ro - vibrational levels . </S>",
    "<S> our experimental results show that @xmath24 is negligible .    </S>",
    "<S> the loss of atoms during the hold time is also found to be negligible . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig - kmm ] and obtain @xmath47ms from the fit . </S>",
    "<S> again , the error bar is statistical .    in order to extract the loss - rate coefficients @xmath1 and @xmath0 , the effective volumes @xmath35 and @xmath34 must be determined . </S>",
    "<S> this requires knowledge of the density distributions of the atomic and molecular cloud . </S>",
    "<S> this is a delicate issue , because the small cloud size makes direct measurements of the spatial distributions in the trap very hard . </S>",
    "<S> theoretical modeling is also hard . </S>",
    "<S> even the distributions at the beginning of the loss measurements are difficult to model , because the time evolution during molecule association is nontrivial . </S>",
    "<S> this is because , first , atomic pair correlations are crucial for a realistic treatment of the association process @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> second , the loss rate coefficients @xmath1 and @xmath0 become relevant as soon as molecules start to form during the ramp . </S>",
    "<S> third , these coefficients exhibit an unknown but probably strong magnetic - field dependence near the feshbach resonance .    during the loss measurement , </S>",
    "<S> anharmonicities in the trap potential and elastic collisions between particles tend to randomize the motion leading towards a thermal distribution . </S>",
    "<S> inelastic collisions , however , remove particles preferentially at the trap center , where the density is highest . </S>",
    "<S> the elastic scattering cross sections for the molecules are unknown . </S>",
    "<S> hence , it is not clear which process dominates at what stage of the loss measurement . </S>",
    "<S> the evolution of the density distributions during the loss measurements is therefore a complex process with unknown parameters and unknown initial conditions .    in order to obtain an estimate for the effective volumes @xmath34 and @xmath35 , we assume that particles of the same species ( atoms or molecules ) are in thermal equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> our model does allow for a temperature difference between atoms and molecules . </S>",
    "<S> with this approximation , the spatial density distributions @xmath22 and @xmath23 are gaussian and eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq - volume ] ) yields the effective volume for species @xmath29 @xmath48 where the index @xmath49 refers to the three directions in space and the one - dimensional ( 1d ) root - mean - square ( rms ) radii of the gaussians are @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> the mass and temperature of species @xmath29 are labeled @xmath51 and @xmath52 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the polarizability and the mass of a molecule are twice as large as for one atom , so that the trap frequencies for atoms and molecules are identical , i.e.  @xmath53 .    </S>",
    "<S> the temperature of the atoms and molecules is determined from time - of - flight measurements . for the atoms , the cloud size evolves as @xmath54 where the trap is switched off at @xmath40 and @xmath55 </S>",
    "<S> is the 1d rms - velocity of species @xmath29 , which is independent of the spatial direction if the species is in thermal equilibrium . for the molecules </S>",
    "<S> , extra kinetic energy is added in the dissociation process @xcite , so that @xmath56 again , @xmath40 is chosen at the time of release from the trap . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath57 reflects the extra kinetic energy released in the dissociation . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath58 is the remaining time of flight between dissociation and detection . in order to determine @xmath59 , we scan the time @xmath60 between release and detection in such a way that @xmath58 remains fixed </S>",

    "<S> ( [ eq - m - exp ] ) is then equivalent to a fit of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq - a - exp ] ) with a modified value for @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the extracted temperature is insensitive to the dissociation heating .    the atomic cloud before molecule association typically contains @xmath62 atoms at a temperature of @xmath63k very close to @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> the cloud is almost purely thermal with only @xmath64 bec atoms . </S>",
    "<S> the molecule association is accompanied by noticeable heating and substantial loss . </S>",
    "<S> the remaining atomic cloud contains @xmath65 atoms at a temperature of @xmath66k . </S>",
    "<S> there is no bec in the remaining atomic cloud . </S>",
    "<S> the molecular cloud has a temperature of @xmath67k resulting in a peak phase - space density of @xmath68 for the molecules . </S>",
    "<S> the center - of - mass motion of an atom pair is unchanged in the association and in a dilute thermal cloud the atomic pair correlations are uncorrelated from the center - of - mass motion of the pairs . </S>",
    "<S> hence , our experiment should produce molecules with the same temperature as the initial atoms . </S>",
    "<S> this agrees reasonably with our measurements . </S>",
    "<S> the measured values of @xmath26 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 vary by less than 10% during the loss measurement . </S>",
    "<S> this justifies the assumption that they are time - independent , which was used to derive eq.([eq - n(t ) ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the above values for @xmath70 and @xmath69 yield effective volumes of @xmath71  @xmath72 and @xmath73  @xmath72 . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting loss - rate coefficients are @xmath74  @xmath4s and @xmath3  @xmath4s . </S>",
    "<S> statistical errors on the rate coefficients are negligible compared to systematic errors .    </S>",
    "<S> the dominant systematic error arises from the problematic assumption that the clouds are in thermal equilibrium . for reasons discussed above , it is hard to measure or model the temporal evolution of the density distributions . on one hand , </S>",
    "<S> the association process preferentially populates the trap center , because the association is less efficient at low atomic density . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , inelastic collisions preferentially deplete the trap center . </S>",
    "<S> both effects can lead to a misestimation of @xmath34 but the trends go into opposite directions . </S>",
    "<S> it is not clear which of the effects dominates . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting systematic error is hard to quantify . </S>",
    "<S> we speculate that a factor of 3 seems possible for @xmath0 as well as @xmath1 .    in conclusion , we measured the loss - rate coefficients @xmath0 and @xmath1 for feshbach molecules in @xmath2rb at 1005.8  g. these results yield valuable input for theoretical models of the three - atom and four - atom system . </S>",
    "<S> the measured value for @xmath0 agrees reasonably with the prediction @xmath14  </S>",
