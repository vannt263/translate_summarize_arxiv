    "most of the modern theoretical work on prebiotic evolution was prompted by the seminal paper of @xcite which explored the fate of a population of competing macromolecules in an environment with limited resources .",
    "the main conclusion of eigen s work is that the length of a replicating polymer ( i.e. , a rna - like template ) is limited by the replication accuracy per nucleotide , and so primordial replicators would have to replicate with implausible high accuracy in order to reach the length of today s rna viruses ( about @xmath3 to @xmath4 nucleotides ) .",
    "this finding , together with the observation that distinct templates can not coexist in the competition - only scenario @xcite , come to be known as the information crisis of prebiotic evolution .",
    "in fact , this information crisis would be resolved by the coexistence of several distinct , short templates , i.e. by the splitting of the information in short modules , similarly to the division of the genome in chromosomes found in many present - day organisms . in this case , the total information content of the template pool is the product of the number of different templates and the maximum information coded per template ( roughly the template length @xmath1 ) , provided the template types have the same concentration .",
    "but template coexistence can be achieved only if some sort of cooperation between templates is imposed _ a priori _ to the molecular population . to this end",
    "@xcite proposed a cyclic reaction scheme , termed hypercycle , in which each replicator would aid in the replication of the next one , in a regulatory cycle closing on itself .",
    "an alternative proposal confines the templates in packages or prebiotic vesicles which are deemed viable provided it encloses a number @xmath5 of distinct functional templates @xcite .    perhaps because hypercycles and vesicle models are more difficult to analyze than the naked - gene ( quasispecies ) scenario , the all - important question of whether these information integration systems exhibit a similar phenomenon as the error threshold of the quasispecies model was put off . only recently a re - examination of a prototypical package model  the model of @xcite  revealed that package models in general suffer from the same malady as the quasispecies model : in the case of imperfect replication an increase in the number @xmath5 of distinct templates confined in the vesicle must be followed by a decrease of their lengths , otherwise the package becomes unviable . as a result",
    ", the product @xmath6 ( i.e. , the total information content of the package ) tends to a constant value that depends essentially on the spontaneous mutation rate per nucleotide @xcite .",
    "our aim in this contribution is to investigate whether a similar restriction to the total amount of information in the pool of templates holds for hypercycle systems as well .",
    "the dynamics of hypercycle systems in the presence of a variety of mutant types was extensively investigated by @xcite .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for an emphasis on the destabilizing effects of mutant parasites and to @xcite for an analysis of the robustness conferred by spatial organization against those mutants",
    ". however , the formulation of @xcite in which the mutants form an error tail class seems more appropriate to study the error threshold phenomenon and so our analysis will build heavily on that paper .",
    "the sole motivation of this contribution is to show that the condition for the viability of the hypercycle derived in @xcite is in fact valid for all @xmath5 and not only for the regime where fixed points are stable , i.e. , for @xmath7 .",
    "this is so because we found numerically that a necessary condition for the presence of stable periodic orbits is the existence of an unstable fixed point .",
    "for the purpose of completeness , in the following section we describe the model and re - derive the main results regarding the existence of fixed point ( and hence of stable periodic solutions ) for the hypercycle system .",
    "the hypercycle system we consider here is composed of @xmath5 ` functional ' elements @xmath8 and its error tail @xmath9 .",
    "the templates are capable of self - replication with productivity values @xmath10 and @xmath11 . as usual , we introduce the kinetic constants @xmath12 that measure the strength of the influence of template @xmath13 on the growth promotion of template @xmath14 . the key ingredient in the modeling",
    "is that in both processes of growth of template @xmath14 the probability of success is given by the parameter @xmath15 $ ] , so that an erroneous copy , which will then belong to the error tail , is produced with probability @xmath16 .",
    "back - mutations from the error class to the functional class , as well as mutations between elements of the functional class , are neglected .",
    "this formulation is equivalent to considering polynucleotides of length @xmath17 whose mutation probability per nucleotide @xmath18 goes to @xmath19 such that the replication accuracy per genome is finite , i.e. @xmath20 .    the concentrations @xmath21 of the hypercycle functional elements and the concentration @xmath22 of the error - tail evolve in time according to the kinetic equations @xcite @xmath23 and @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 is a dilution flux that keeps the total concentration constant , i.e. , @xmath27 . as usual ,",
    "the dot denotes a time derivative .",
    "henceforth we will assume that @xmath28 in accord with the usual assumption of package models that functional templates and parasites are selectively neutral @xcite we set @xmath29 , and @xmath30 for @xmath31 , resulting in the so - called symmetric hypercycle .",
    "hence by measuring the kinetic constant @xmath32 and the time @xmath33 in units of @xmath34 we can set @xmath35 without loss of generality ( except for @xmath36 , of course ) .",
    "here we focus only on the fixed - point solutions @xmath37 for @xmath38 . in this case , the condition @xmath39 yields @xmath40 which , inserted in the equations @xmath41 , yields @xmath42 . using these results in eq .",
    "( [ flux ] ) we find that @xmath43 is given by the roots of the quadratic equation @xmath44 which has two real positive roots provided the condition @xmath45 is satisfied .",
    "we note that @xmath46 is a necessary condition for the existence of hypercyclic solutions @xmath47 , since in the absence of catalytic couplings among functional templates ( i.e. , @xmath48 ) eq . ( [ quad ] )",
    "has no solution .    the analysis of the roots of eq .",
    "( [ quad ] ) and the numerical evaluation of the jacobian eigenvalues indicate that the smaller root is always unstable whereas the larger root is ( locally ) stable for @xmath7 .",
    "in addition , the disordered fixed point @xmath49 and @xmath50 is always stable @xcite .",
    "it is well known that for @xmath51 the steady state of the hypercycle is characterized by stable periodic solutions @xcite where the concentrations @xmath52 vary wildly reaching values dangerously close to zero , which would certainly doom a finite - population system @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , here we take an optimistic stance and assume that the hypercycle is an acceptable information integrator even in the regime where it exhibits periodic solutions : the @xmath5 templates do coexist in this regime after all , albeit with ( very ) distinct concentrations .",
    "the issue is then to determine the region in the space of the parameters @xmath53 and @xmath32 where the steady - state solution is such that @xmath54 is nonzero .",
    "the search for steady - state solutions with nonvanishing concentration of functional templates can be carried out straightforwardly through the numerical integration of the differential equations ( [ ode_h])- ( [ ode_e ] ) .",
    "the procedure is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] for @xmath55 : for a fixed value of @xmath32 we decrease @xmath53 until we reach a threshold value below which the only steady - state solution is @xmath50 .",
    "remarkably , through this numerical analysis we find that the region of viability of the hypercycle ( i.e. , the region characterized by a nonzero concentration of functional templates , regardless of whether the stable solution is a fixed point or a periodic orbit ) is determined by the condition of existence of real fixed points , eq .",
    "( [ qh ] ) . we are not aware of a mathematical proof for this result . for @xmath56 ,",
    "index theory can be used to show that inside the region enclosed by a periodic orbit there must exist at least one fixed point so that the absence of fixed points precludes the existence of periodic orbits @xcite .",
    "it seems , however , that this result can not be extended to @xmath57 .",
    "the theorem proved by @xcite is not helpful either : it asserts that for a hypercycle system with no error tail ( i.e. , @xmath58 ) if the ( unique ) fixed point becomes unstable then there is a stable periodic orbit , whereas our conjecture is that if there is a stable periodic orbit then there must be at least one unstable fixed point .    in summary , we find that the hypercycle system is viable provided the number of functional templates @xmath5 satisfies the condition @xmath59 where @xmath60 since @xmath0 is a monotonously increasing function of @xmath15 $ ] and @xmath53 , in turn , is a monotonously decreasing function of @xmath1 ( recall that @xmath61 ) we find that @xmath0 decreases with increasing @xmath1 .",
    "hence , all other things being equal if the number of functional templates @xmath5 is increased then their lengths @xmath1 must decrease accordingly so as to guarantee that @xmath59 is fulfilled .",
    "this remark shows that an information preservation principle similar to that derived for package models holds for the hypercycle as well , which suggests a reconsideration of the whole approach based on the coexistence of distinct templates to address the information crisis of prebiotic evolution .",
    "in our analysis we have opted for the choice of parameters that most favored the stability of the hypercycle .",
    "for instance , introduction of other interactions such as the catalytic promotion of the growth of the templates in the error tail by functional templates ",
    "an assumption implicit in the package models  can only reduce the value of @xmath0 .",
    "( we have verified that the catalytic coupling between functional templates and the error tail does not produce any qualitatively new result . ) similarly , the parameter setting that corresponds to the elementary hypercycle in which @xmath62 but @xmath63 results also in a reduction of @xmath0 .",
    "asymmetric hypercycles in which the templates have distinct productivities @xmath64 leads to internal competition and again to the decrease of @xmath0 @xcite . hence eq .",
    "( [ n_max ] ) must be seen as an upper bound to the maximum number of functional templates in the hypercycle .",
    "the effect that a change @xmath65 causes on @xmath0 is given by @xmath66 in the case the functional templates have a high replication accuracy ( i.e. , @xmath67 ) we find that the product @xmath2 tends to a constant value , similarly to the findings for the package models @xcite .",
    "we stress that eq .",
    "( [ n_max ] ) is worthful because its validity is not restricted to the regime where the nontrivial fixed point is stable : it holds also in the regime where the only stable solutions are periodic orbits .",
    "we provide only numerical evidence to support this remarkable finding which is based on the conjecture that the existence of an unstable fixed point is a necessary condition for the presence of stable periodic orbits in the system of ordinary differential equations ( [ ode_h])-([ode_e ] ) .",
    "it would be very interesting to find a proof for this conjecture .",
