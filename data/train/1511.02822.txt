    "the powerful @xmath1 radiation from bscco mesas at zero magnetic field being reported in 2007 @xcite starts a new stage of intensive investigation of the intrinsic josephson junctions ( ijj ) .",
    "a big progress has been made in mesa preparation technology , as a consequence self - heating effects and hot spot formations are significantly reduced @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the last progress gives possibility to increase the number of junctions in mesas from @xmath2 @xcite to @xmath3 @xcite , the radiation power from @xmath4 @xcite to @xmath5 @xcite and the frequency from @xmath6 @xcite up to @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "still , the mechanism of powerful radiation has not been fully explained .",
    "it has been generally accepted that high radiation power could be achieved when the frequency @xmath8 satisfies the resonance condition : @xmath9 this means that @xmath8 satisfies the ac josephson relation @xmath10 and it simultaneously coincides with some cavity mode frequency : @xmath11 . here",
    "@xmath12 is the electric charge , @xmath13 is planck s constant and @xmath14 is the applied dc voltage .",
    "cavity mode frequency @xmath15 depends on mesa geometry and dimensions @xcite .",
    "the resonance condition is rather restrictive and usually it is not exactly observed in the real experiments . although the ac josephson relation is always excellently fulfilled in the experiments , it is not yet explained why the frequency @xmath8 may differ from the corresponding cavity mode frequency @xmath15 @xcite,@xcite . the observed  dual  source mechanism in experimental works @xcite , @xcite",
    "is confirmed numerically in @xcite but it s still not well understood .",
    "there are two main concepts for the powerful radiation mechanism - the coupling to the resonance modes is obtained by @xmath0 kinks @xcite,@xcite or by breather type self oscillation ( not necessarily with @xmath0 amplitude ) @xcite .",
    "it is important to mention that there is a difference in the mathematical models used in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "periodic boundary conditions in z - direction ( stacking direction ) are posed in @xcite while the boundary conditions in @xcite are nonperiodic .",
    "although the parameters are almost the same , there is a difference in the characteristic mode velocities @xcite .",
    "particularly the maximum ( in - phase ) plasma velocities significantly differ for usual simulations with about 10 - 20 junctions . on the other hand",
    "the use of nonperiodic boundary conditions in @xcite makes the junctions to be not identical , the amplitudes of oscillations in the external junctions lower then these in the internal ones and hence the picture becomes more complicated .",
    "actually , it is reasonable to think that the solutions in @xcite and @xcite are generally of the same type and not to treat them as different .",
    "in addition we want to note the new state with coexisting moving fluxons and longitudinal plasma wave in @xcite . this state may be also important for the future understanding of powerful thz radiation .    in this work",
    "we carry out numerical simulation by solving a system of 1d sine - gordon equations which describe well the rectangular mesas in which the zero mode is realized in y - direction .",
    "because in reality the number of junctions is thousands , we prefer to use periodic boundary conditions as in @xcite .",
    "we achieve kinks in the numerical simulations and perform a detailed analysis of their possible amplitudes .",
    "we show that the kink amplitudes may differ from @xmath0 , they depend on the kink configuration in z - direction and on the bias current .",
    "a crucial observation is the alternative character of the static kink configuration and approximately the same number of kinks and anti - kinks in the stack .",
    "we show by fft analysis that radiation frequencies excellently satisfy the ac josephson relation as in the real experiments . calculated amplitude maps and the direct phase analysis show simultaneous existence of nonlinear background modes .",
    "although the background modes are hard to see at the top of the current steps , corresponding to a particular cavity mode excitation @xcite , their amplitudes become higher when the current decreases . the background modes",
    "are very well seen at the bottom of the current steps .",
    "there is a strong relation between the oscillations of the background modes and the static kink configuration : the opposite static kink chains in the different junctions correspond to opposite ( @xmath0-shifted ) oscillations of the background modes .",
    "assuming zero mode along y - axis we consider a system of 1d sine - gordon equations ( @xmath16-model ) @xcite . for stack of @xmath17 periodically stacked junctions with length @xmath18 the column vector @xmath19 of the gauge invariant phase differences satisfies the standard inductive model @xcite : @xmath20 here @xmath21 is the @xmath22 matrix @xmath23 with @xmath24 being the inductive coupling parameter , @xmath25 is the london penetration depth , @xmath26 is the thickness of insulators , @xmath27 - the thickness of superconductors .    in @xmath28",
    "is the damping parameter , where @xmath29 are the normal resistance , the capacitance and the critical current per unit length respectively .",
    "the applied bias current @xmath30 is normalized to the critical current @xmath31 .",
    "the space @xmath32 in is normalized to the josephson penetration depth @xmath33 , the time @xmath34 to the inverse of plasma frequency @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the effective magnetic thickness of the barrier , @xmath37 is the magnetic constant . in",
    "calculated further current - voltage characteristics ( cvcs ) the voltage @xmath38 will be normalized to @xmath39 .",
    "the voltage @xmath38 in the stack is the sum of voltages @xmath40 in the junctions : @xmath41 .",
    "when @xmath40 are equal as a result of using periodic conditions for the stack , we will write simply @xmath14 .",
    "together with equation we consider radiative boundary conditions @xcite,@xcite :    @xmath42    with @xmath43 we denote the instant spatial average , plus sign corresponds to the left edge of the stack ( @xmath44 ) , minus sign - to the right edge ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "@xmath46 is the normalized impedance . for @xmath47",
    "boundary conditions become simple neumann conditions : @xmath48 because @xmath46 is huge in reality @xcite and also it is not easy to implement , most authors prefer to use neumann conditions for their simulations . in our simulations we use the boundary conditions .",
    "for rectangular mesas described by the @xmath16-model , the frequencies for the cavity modes @xmath49 ( in normalized units ) are given by @xcite : @xmath50 here @xmath51 is the maximum plasma velocity .",
    "@xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the minimal eigenvalue of the cyclic tridiagonal matrix @xmath21 and does not depend on @xmath17 .",
    "for the usual ( not cyclic ) tridiagonal matrix @xmath54 @xcite .    in our simulations we take @xmath55 close to @xmath56 , which corresponds to strong inductive coupling ( as for bscco crystals ) .",
    "it is important to note again the difference between using models with cyclic and not cyclic matrix . as an example for @xmath57 , @xmath51 for the cyclic and not cyclic matrix",
    "are respectively @xmath58 and @xmath59 , and the condition numbers of the matrices are respectively @xmath60 and @xmath61 . for @xmath62 , which is usually used in simulations @xcite , @xmath51 changes to @xmath63 and @xmath64 respectively and the condition numbers to @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "the above difference in wave velocities nicely explains the different results in @xcite,@xcite and the achieved higher modes in @xcite - up to 12 .",
    "moreover , it is difficult to determine parameter @xmath55 rigorously @xcite .",
    "for all the above reasons ( the use of periodic boundary conditions , numerical accuracy , not strictly determined @xmath55 in reality ) , we take @xmath55 phenomenologically .",
    "the results that follow are achieved for @xmath67 .",
    "we solve problem , by using a leap - frog difference scheme .",
    "the nonstandard boundary conditions are approximated by the method of balance @xcite , which provides energy conservation of the numerical scheme .",
    "simulations are made for @xmath68 .",
    "the bias current @xmath30 is taken with noise of amplitude @xmath69 .",
    "simulated cvc s for different dissipation parameters.,scaledwidth=36.0% ]     emission power corresponding to cvc s calculated by the poynting vector at the edge @xmath44.,scaledwidth=36.0% ]    we do nt use any special initial conditions",
    ". we use zero initial conditions at the start of our simulations . a typical simulation of the outermost branch of the cvc works as follows . starting with zero initial conditions at @xmath70",
    "we increase @xmath30 by steps of @xmath71 until ( at @xmath72 ) all the junctions switch to resistive state .",
    "we continue increasing @xmath30 up to @xmath73 and then start to decrease @xmath30 .",
    "a hysteresis region , typical for ijj , is observed , i.e. at the decreasing part of cvc , the voltage @xmath38 remains nonzero for @xmath74 until all the junctions switch to superconductive state ( @xmath75 ) at some bias current .",
    "cvcs for @xmath76 are shown in fig.1 .",
    "different @xmath77 model different mesa temperatures @xcite .",
    "cvcs show a nice regular pattern . depending on the possible achievable voltage @xmath38 ,",
    "jumps are observed at @xmath78 .",
    "voltage @xmath79 in the stack corresponds to voltage @xmath80 per junction .",
    "radiation power achieved by calculating time average of the poynting vector @xcite at the edge @xmath44 of the stack is shown in fig.2 .",
    "each voltage jump corresponds to a peak in the radiation power .",
    "these voltage jumps are different from the jumps to another voltage branch such as those in the experimental results in @xcite , where different groups of junctions are involved in resonance . in our case",
    "we remain on the same ( outermost ) branch .    direct analysis of the calculated @xmath81-dynamics shows that the peaks at @xmath82 correspond to an excitation of the cavity modes @xmath83 respectively @xcite .",
    "the phase in a particular junction is a sum of three terms : the linear term @xmath84 , a static kink term ( time independent ) and an oscillating term @xcite . a clear two - dimensional standing wave pattern is seen as in @xcite,@xcite , where the oscillating term of the phases @xmath81 is approximately uniform in z - direction and satisfies the linear wave equation : @xmath85 with neumann boundary conditions , except at the bottom of the current steps . as our numerical simulations show there",
    "exist a small nonuniform oscillating part with the same frequency , which is clearly seen at the bottom of the current steps .",
    "unlike the cavity mode part this part has a nonlinear origin .",
    "we use the terminology from @xcite and call this oscillating mode a background mode .",
    "we will return to describe the background modes later .",
    "it is worth to note that the cavity mode 1 excitation is more stable for larger dissipation parameter @xmath77 .",
    "this is clearly seen from the loosing of smoothness of cvc around the resonance voltage for @xmath86 ( fig",
    ". 1 ) and also from the direct observation of the phase @xmath81 which shows a very complicated picture , hard to analyze .",
    "this is in a good agreement with the experimental results in @xcite,@xcite where the highest power for cavity mode 1 is achieved for relatively higher temperatures .",
    "the static part of @xmath81 consists of some configuration of chains of kinks ( @xmath87 ) and anti - kinks ( @xmath88 ) in every junction as in @xcite,@xcite .",
    "a crucial observation is the alternative character of the static kink configuration , i.e. alternating of opposite kinks ( kinks and anti - kinks ) in x and z - direction .",
    "as numerous simulations show the number of kinks and antikinks in the stack is usually one and the same ; if it is not , the difference is at most 2 . for mode",
    "@xmath89 the chains consist of @xmath89 kinks or antikinks , for example @xmath90 .",
    "a kink configuration in the stack is a sequence of chains starting with the first junction .",
    "for example in the case of excitation of third cavity mode the sequence @xmath91 corresponds to a configuration with chain @xmath92 in the first junction , @xmath93 in the second and so on .",

    "they are achieved at @xmath96 .",
    "the picture for cavity mode @xmath97 , achieved at @xmath98 and for mode 2 at different @xmath77 is similar .",
    "regardless the static kink configuration for numerous repeated simulations , cavity mode @xmath95 is excited always when @xmath99 at the decreasing part of cvc .",
    "the results for the radiation power , the voltages and the kink amplitudes , corresponding to three different kink configurations ( three solutions ) , are shown in fig.3 .",
    "all the curves in fig.3 are obtained by reversing @xmath30 at point @xmath100 ( @xmath99 ) , i.e. increasing @xmath30 until the corresponding solution exists .",
    "figure 3b actually shows the current steps in the cvc corresponding to the excitation of cavity mode 2 with different kink configurations .",
    "the heights of the current steps differ for different configurations .",
    "solution 1 corresponds to the kink configuration @xmath101 , solution 2 - to @xmath102 , solution 3 - to @xmath103 .",
    "the total number of kinks and antikinks for the above kink configurations is one and the same . from the top to the bottom of the current steps",
    "the kink amplitudes decrease from almost @xmath0 to zero .",
    "solution 1 exists at largest range in @xmath30 and can achieve maximal radiation power ( fig.3a ) .",
    "although for every coexisting point the voltages and the power are approximately the same for solutions @xmath83 , the kink amplitudes are not .",
    "the average in the stack kink amplitudes are shown in fig.3c .",
    "the average kink amplitude is greatest for solution 1 for every @xmath30 .",
    "the maximal average kink amplitude is close ( @xmath104 ) , but less then @xmath0 .",
    "decreasing @xmath30 from point @xmath100 the kink amplitudes strongly decrease together with decreasing the voltage and the radiation power .",
    "kink configuration for solution 2 at point @xmath105 ( @xmath106 ) and point @xmath100 ( @xmath99 ) in fig.4 confirm the last conclusion .",
    "it is worth to note that although the average kink amplitude is always less then @xmath0 , it could be even greater then @xmath0 for particular junction and depending on the kink configuration .",
    "for example the kink amplitude in junction @xmath107 for solution 3 at point @xmath108 ( @xmath72 ) is @xmath109 .",

    "calculated by fft radiation frequency @xmath8 excellently fulfills the ac josephson relation , which in normalized units is @xmath112 .",
    "the fft results for the oscillation of the electric field @xmath94 at the edge @xmath44 of the stack are shown in fig.5a ( cavity mode 2 ) and fig.5b ( cavity mode 1 ) .",
    "the oscillation amplitudes decrease together with the decreasing bias current @xmath30 ( decreasing radiation power ) .",
    "integer higher harmonics up to the fifth order are also visible on the top of the current steps but their number decrease with @xmath30 and completely disappear at the bottom of the current steps . at the top of the current steps",
    "the amplitudes decrease exponentially as it is seen from dashed lines in fig.5 .",
    "integer higher harmonics are obtained in many experiments , for example in : @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite , where an exponential rate of decreasing of harmonics amplitudes is also observed .    to check the resonance condition",
    "we calculate @xmath113 from calculated voltage at the top of the current step of cavity mode 2 and @xmath114 from formula .",
    "they differ by less then @xmath115 : @xmath116 .",
    "although the voltage @xmath14 is in a pretty large range for kink solutions ( @xmath117 in fig .",
    "3b ) , the frequency tunability for powers greater then @xmath118 and @xmath119 of the maximal power is only about @xmath120 and @xmath121 respectively .",
    "the fact that the frequency at the maximal achieved power excellently fits with the cavity frequency agrees with the experimental results @xcite-@xcite .",
    "on the other hand the frequency tunability around the cavity frequency is much larger in the experiments then in our simulation . in our opinion this is dew to the fact that the considered model does nt treat the temperature inhomogeneities which exist in reality .    in order to understand whether the oscillating part consists only of cavity mode oscillations , we calculate the amplitude maps of the electric field , i.e. we calculate the amplitude for every harmonic frequency by using fft for every point @xmath122 $ ] . it is correct because although the amplitudes slightly depend on the output bins , the frequencies are the same for every @xmath32 .",
    "figure 6a shows the amplitudes of the first three frequency harmonics corresponding to the top of the current step of the excited cavity mode 2 . in our case the second and the third harmonics are the cavity modes @xmath123 and @xmath124 respectively .",
    "the amplitudes excellently fit with the properly scaled @xmath125-function : @xmath126 . on the other hand at the bottom of the current step ( fig.6b ,",

    "this result confirms the existence of oscillating background modes .",
    "although it is hard to detect background mode oscillations at the top of the current steps , we suppose that they support the cavity mode oscillations at the entire current step .",
    "the background modes have a nonlinear origin .",

    "the time evolution of the electric field and the electric field with subtracted cavity mode part are shown in fig.8 and fig.9 respectively . as it is seen from these figures , the amplitudes of the background modes",
    "are not uniform , but they are higher at the centers of the kinks .    the oscillations of the background modes in the adjacent junctions ( odd and even ) for excited cavity mode 2 at @xmath106 , @xmath132 are shown in fig.7b .",
    "the static kink configuration is @xmath101 ( solution 1 ) . here",
    "the background amplitudes are relatively smaller because we are not at the very bottom of the current step .",
    "the picture is similar , the anti - phase background oscillations are clearly seen in fig .",
