    "the seyfert 1s with extreme properties , i.e. @xmath15 , steepest x - ray spectra and rapid x - ray variability form a distinct subclass known as narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxies ( nls1s ) .",

    "these facts imply that there must be seyfert 2s with high relative accretion rates similar to those of nls1s i.e. , the type 2 counterpart of nls1s .",
    "these objects are largely missing at present due to the difficulty in isolating them using the conventional observational techniques of the optical regime .",
    "the only way to distinguish them is to use observations which are not affected by absorption such as near infra - red spectroscopy , optical spectropolarimetry and x - ray emission above 2 kev .    in this _ letter _ , we present x - ray evidence for three type 2 counterparts ( ngc  7582 , ngc  5506 and ngc  7314 ) of nls1s .",

    "the @xmath7 x - ray emission from seyfert 1.9/2 galaxies consists mainly of two components : ( @xmath48 ) absorbed primary continuum , and ( @xmath49 ) compton reflection from distant cold material .",
    "the reflection component is relatively steady over timescales of years .",

    "we did not use the mos data for ngc  7314 due to the high signal - to - noise of the pn data and slight mismatch in the continuum shapes inferred from the pn and mos data .",

    "a detailed study of the complex soft x - ray emission is beyond the scope of this _ letter _ , and has no significant impact on the final results .",
    "the x - ray spectra of a seyfert 2s generally show signatures of reprocessed emission ; namely a strong iron k@xmath17 line at @xmath50 and a corresponding absorption edge at @xmath51 . in view of these features ,",
    "we adopt a baseline model consisting of a heavily absorbed power - law , a compton reflection component from neutral material and a narrow gaussian to represent the iron k@xmath17 line . for the sake of completeness",
    ", we also added a second gaussian line to describe the iron k@xmath9 line from neutral iron .",
    "the energy and strength of the k@xmath9 line were fixed at their theoretical values of @xmath52 and @xmath53 of the strength of the corresponding k@xmath17 line , respectively .",
    "all the components were modified by the galactic column , listed in table  [ t1 ] .",
    "we used the reflection model _ pexrav _",
    "( magdziarz & zdziarski 1995 ) .",
    "this model calculates the reflected spectrum from a neutral disk exposed to an exponentially cutoff power - law continuum .",
    "the _ pexrav _",
    "model was set to produce the reflected emission only , while the power - law was set to provide the primary continuum .",
    "we fix the cutoff energy of the primary power law at @xmath54 , disk inclination at @xmath55 , and the abundance of heavy elements at the solar value .",
    "the free parameters are the photon index and the normalization of the primary power law , and the relative amount of reflection compared with the directly viewed primary spectrum ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "we also varied the intrinsic absorption column ( @xmath57 ) , the line energy ( @xmath58 ) and the flux ( @xmath59 ) of the iron k@xmath17 line .",
    "the baseline model resulted in a good fit ( @xmath60 for @xmath61 degrees of freedom ( dof ) for ngc  7582 and @xmath62 for @xmath63 dof for ngc  7314 ) .",
    "the best - fit parameters are listed in table  [ t1 ] , and the unfolded spectra and deviations are shown in figures  [ f2 ] ( ngc  7582 ) and [ f3 ] ( ngc  7314 ) .",
    "the contribution of the compton reflection component , including the narrow iron lines , to the observed x - ray flux in the @xmath7 band is @xmath64 for ngc  7582 and @xmath65 for ngc  7314 .",
    "a comparison of _ asca _ ( xue et al . 1998 ) , _ bepposax _ ( turner et al . 2000 ) and _ xmm - newton _ observations of ngc  7582 reveals a continuous increase in the absorption column ( @xmath66 ) and the @xmath12 photon index ( @xmath67 ) from 1994 to 2001 .",
    "ngc  7582 was in the lowest flux state during the _ xmm - newton _ observation in may 2001 .",

    "a joint spectral analysis of the two data sets was performed by matt et al .",
    "the best - fit model to the pn and pds data was similar to the baseline model except for an additional broad k@xmath17 line from ionized iron .",
    "the primary power - law was steep ( @xmath72 ) and heavily absorbed ( @xmath73 ) . using the best - fit parameters derived by matt et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , we estimated that the contribution of the compton reflection including the unresolved k@xmath17 line from neutral iron is @xmath74 to the total observed x - ray emission ( @xmath75 ) in the @xmath7 band , while the absorption corrected contribution is @xmath76 to the intrinsic x - ray emission ( @xmath77 ) in the @xmath7 band .",
    "to estimate the variability amplitudes of the primary power - law , we have corrected the observed count rates for the contribution of the compton reflection and heavy obscuration .",
    "first , we converted the count rates into absorbed power - law flux using a conversion factor between the time - averaged count rate and observed flux , and the contribution of the reflection emission as derived from the spectral modeling . the absorbed power - law flux were then converted to unabsorbed power - law flux using the best - fit photon indices and the absorption columns ( see table  [ t1 ] ) .",
    "the count rates and the unabsorbed power - law flux at the beginning and the end of the rapid variability events are listed in table  [ t2 ] .",
    "the @xmath7 unabsorbed flux of the primary power law varied by a factor @xmath78 or a change in flux , @xmath79 in @xmath80 in the case of ngc  7582 .",
    "a change in the intrinsic power - law flux @xmath81 in @xmath82 has been observed from ngc  5506 . a similar change , @xmath83 in @xmath84 , is evident from ngc  7314 .",
    "we have studied the temporal and spectral characteristics of three obscured seyfert galaxies .",
    "ngc  7582 showed a factor of two variability in the @xmath7 count rate or a change of @xmath7 intrinsic luminosity , @xmath85 of the primary emission in just @xmath86 .",
    "ngc  5506 showed a change in the count rate of @xmath87 or a change in the luminosity of @xmath88 in an interval of @xmath89 only .",
    "ngc  7413 showed a change in the count rate of @xmath90 or a change in the intrinsic primary luminosity @xmath91 in the @xmath7 band .",
    "these are the most extreme rapid variability events ever observed from seyfert 1.9/2 galaxies .",
    "application of the efficiency ( @xmath92 ) limit : @xmath93 ( fabian 1979 ) , however , shows that the these events do not violate the limit for a swarzschild black hole . among the radio - quiet agns , the most rapid x - ray variability on timescales of a few hundred seconds",
    "is observed from nls1s ( see e.g. , boller et al .",
    "1996 ; leighly 1999a ) . the rapid x - ray variability observed from ngc  7582 , ngc  5506 and ngc  7314 are similar to that of nls1s .",
    "in addition to the extreme variability , the three agns show steep @xmath7 primary power - law ( ngc  7582 : @xmath94 ; ngc  5506 : @xmath72 ; ngc  7314 : @xmath95 ) .",
    "these photon indices are steeper than the mean index , @xmath96 , of the @xmath97 intrinsic power - law for 20 bright compton - thin seyfert 2s ( risaliti 2002 ) .",
    "the photon indices are also steeper than the mean index of @xmath98 for the broad - line seyfert 1s but similar to the mean index @xmath99 for nls1s in the sample of leighly ( 1999b ) .",
    "the similarity of the extreme variability and steep primary power - law emission of the three obscured seyfert galaxies and that of nls1s strongly suggests that the accretion disk - black hole system , responsible for the primary x - ray emission , is similar in the above two types of seyfert galaxies .",
    "many of the observed characteristics of nls1s are interrelated e.g. , the width of the h@xmath9 line is anti - correlated with the soft ( @xmath11 ) and hard ( @xmath12 ) power - law photon indices ( boller et al .",
    "1996 ; brandt , mathur & elvis 1997 ) . thus if the central engines of nls1s and that of ngc  7582 , ngc  5506 and ngc  7314 are similar , then permitted optical lines from the blr should be narrower ( fwhm@xmath100 ) , similar to that of nls1s",
    "indeed , the discovery of near - ir permitted o   i@xmath23 line ( fwhm@xmath22 ) and @xmath101 fe ii lines by @xcite is fully consistent with the x - ray nature of ngc  5506 .",
    "the dramatic appearance of broad balmer lines in the optical spectrum of ngc  7582 in july 1998 is not expected from an obscured nls1 .",
    "however , the broad lines may not be related to the agn , as the evolution of h@xmath17 line width closely resembled with that of sn  1988z ( aretxaga et al .",
    "a near infra - red spectrum of ngc  7582 during its typical type 2 state will further clarify its nature . in view of the above results",
    ", we suggest that the type 1.9/2 agns ngc  7582 , ngc  5506 and ngc  7314 are the type 2 counterpart of nls1 galaxies . as nls1s form a special subclass of seyfert 1 galaxies due to their extreme characteristics , the seyfert 1.9/2s with extreme x - ray characteristics form a special subclass of seyfert 2s , and we term them as `` obscured nls1 '' galaxies to better reflect their nature .",
    "the existence of obscured nls1s is consistent with the standard unification of seyfert galaxies .",
    "however , the presence of nls1 nuclei in both type 1 and 2 seyferts requires a new parameter , the relative accretion rate , to be incorporated in the standard unification scheme based on the viewing angle .",
