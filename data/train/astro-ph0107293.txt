    "in the past half decade , estimates of the cosmic baryon density parameter @xmath1 have ranged from as low as @xmath7 to as high as @xmath8 , driven mainly by studies of the deuterium abundance in high - redshift ly@xmath9 absorbers and by measurements of anisotropy in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) .",
    "the primordial deuterium abundance , combined with the theory of big bang nucleosynthesis , should in principle yield a tight constraint on the quantity @xmath10 .",
    "however , estimates of the deuterium abundance in ly@xmath9 absorbers have ranged widely , with a recent consensus emerging in favor of @xmath11 and a corresponding @xmath12 .",
    "the first analyses of the boomerang and maxima experiments implied a low second peak in the cmb power spectrum , which could be explained by a higher baryon density @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "results from the more recent analysis of boomerang ( including more of the data ) and from the dasi experiment show a stronger second peak that is consistent with the @xmath10 values inferred from the deuterium abundance @xcite .",
    "it is tempting to conclude , therefore , that the baryon density is now known to be @xmath14 with an uncertainty @xmath15 .",
    "however , recent history suggests that we should remain somewhat cautious about this conclusion until it has stood for a longer period of time , especially since there are still discrepancies between this value of @xmath10 and most estimates of the @xmath16he abundance within the framework of standard big bang nucleosynthesis @xcite .",
    "given the remaining uncertainties , it is important to understand the impact of @xmath1 on the predicted properties of cosmic structure .",
    "we investigate this issue using hydrodynamic simulations that have identical cosmological and numerical parameters and differ only in the value of @xmath1 .",
    "even if one believes that the value of @xmath1 is well constrained by observations , an investigation that isolates the effect of the baryon density can give insight into the physics that governs the processes of galaxy formation and the state of the intergalactic medium .",
    "we have previously used simulations like the ones carried out here to predict the evolution of different phases of the intergalactic medium ( dav et al .",
    "1999 ) , the properties of the ly@xmath9 forest ( hernquist et al .",
    "1996 ) , the properties of damped ly@xmath9 and lyman limit systems ( gardner et al .",
    "2001 , hereafter gkhw , and references therein ) , and the masses and star formation rates of high - redshift galaxies ( weinberg , katz , & hernquist 2001 ) .",
    "these are the quantitative predictions that we focus on here , restricting our attention to high - redshift structure purely for reasons of computational practicality : it takes much less computer time to evolve three simulations to @xmath17 than to @xmath18 .",
    "although the qualitative effects of changing @xmath1 are usually easy to guess , the scaling of quantities with @xmath1 is not obvious and turns out in some cases to be non - intuitive . these scalings give guidance to the theoretical uncertainties associated with uncertainties in @xmath1 and a better understanding of the role of gas physics and radiative processes in determining the properties of high - redshift structure .",
    "in this paper we present the results of three simulations of the `` standard '' cold dark matter model ( @xmath19 , @xmath20  mpc@xmath21 , @xmath22 ) identical in every respect except the baryonic mass fraction @xmath1 , which is set to @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "all three runs are performed in a manner similar to that described by gkhw and katz , weinberg , & hernquist ( 1999 ) , wherein a periodic cube whose edges measure 11.11mpc in comoving units is drawn randomly from a cdm universe and evolved to a redshift @xmath17 .",
    "the simulations employ @xmath25 gas and @xmath25 dark matter particles , with a gravitational softening length of 5  comoving kpc ( 3comoving kpc equivalent plummer softening , @xmath26 physical kpc at @xmath17 ) .",
    "the dark matter particle mass is @xmath27 and the gas particle masses are @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 for @xmath31 , and 0.125 respectively .",
    "this yields baryonic mass resolutions ( defined by a 64-particle threshold ) of @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 for the respective @xmath1 s .",
    "detailed descriptions of the simulation code and the radiation physics can be found in hernquist & katz ( 1989 ) and katz , weinberg , & hernquist ( 1996 ; hereafter kwh ) , and we only summarize the techniques here .",
    "we perform our simulations using treesph  ( @xcite ) , a code that unites smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ; @xcite ; @xcite ) with a hierarchical tree method for computing gravitational forces ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "dark matter , stars , and gas are all represented by particles ; collisionless material is influenced only by gravity , while gas is subject to gravitational forces , pressure gradients , and shocks .",
    "we include the effects of radiative cooling , assuming primordial abundances , and compton cooling .",
    "ionization and heat input from a uv radiation background are incorporated in the simulation .",
    "we adopt the uv background spectrum of haardt & madau ( 1996 ) , although it is reduced in intensity by a factor of two at all redshifts for the @xmath35 and 0.05 simulations so that the mean flux decrement of the ly@xmath9  forest ( laf hereafter ) is closer to the observed value given our assumed baryon density ( @xcite ) .",
    "we apply further adjustments to the background intensity during the analysis stage to match the press , rybicki , & schneider ( 1993 ) measurements of the mean decrement , as discussed further in ",
    "[ subsec : laf ] below .",
    "we use a simple prescription to turn cold , dense gas into collisionless `` star '' particles and return the resulting supernova feedback energy to the surrounding medium as heat .",
    "the prescription and its computational implementation are described in detail by kwh .",
    "details of the numerical parameters can be found in katz et al .",
    "( 1999 ) .",
    "> from the simulation outputs at @xmath36 3 , and 2 , we identify dark matter halos and the individual concentrations of cold , collapsed gas that they contain .",
    "we identify the halos by applying a friends - of - friends algorithm ( fof ) to the combined distribution of dark matter and sph particles , with a linking length equal to the mean interparticle separation on an isodensity contour of an isothermal sphere with an enclosed average overdensity of 178 , the virial overdensity . in an isothermal sphere ,",
    "the local density at the virial radius is simply one third the virial overdensity .",
    "the dark matter particles in fof - identified groups correspond to the dark matter halo of a galaxy or cluster .",
    "for all of the analyses in this paper , we impose a cutoff of 64 dark matter particles , corresponding to a halo mass @xmath37 , to eliminate incompleteness effects at smaller , marginally resolved masses .    to detect galaxies within the dark matter halos , we search for discrete regions of cold collapsed gas and stars ( ccgs ) by applying the algorithm spline kernel interpolative denmax ( `` skid '' ) of stadel ( 2000 ; see also kwh and http://www-hpcc.astro.washington.edu/tools/skid.html ) to the distribution of baryonic particles .",
    "skid identifies gravitationally bound groups of gas and star particles that are associated with a common density maximum .",
    "gas particles are only considered as potential members of a skid group if they have temperature @xmath38 k and smoothed density @xmath39 .",
    "we discard skid groups with fewer than eight members . as in gkhw",
    ", we find that all of the gas concentrations found by this method reside within the larger dark matter halos identified by fof .",
    "the particles identified to be part of the remaining skid groups are labeled ccgs ( cold collapsed gas and stars ) , and we consider each skid group to be a galaxy .",
    "the total ccgs mass of a halo is calculated by summing the mass of particles in skid groups within a given fof group .",
    "we present results spanning a wide range of baryonic temperatures and densities .",
    "first we discuss global thermal and density distributions of the baryonic matter , including implications for the ly@xmath9 forest and the mean opacity of the universe .",
    "we then concentrate on baryons resident within collapsed objects , examining the effects of @xmath1 on damped ly@xmath9 absorber and lyman limit incidences , halo baryon and ccgs fraction , and star formation .",

    "shocked : _ ( remainder ) shocked igm in the form of shock - heated gas in filaments and halos .",
    "we adopt the term `` condensed '' to denote gas classified simply by this @xmath41 cut to differentiate it from `` cold collapsed gas ''  part of the cold collapsed gas and stars ( ccgs ) component presented later on  which is gas that is part of a skid - identified group ( and hence gravitationally self - bound ) .",
    "-0.65 in + -0.2 in    figure  [ fig : phases ] compares the mass fraction in each of the three gaseous phases from figure  [ fig : rhot ] as a function of redshift .",
    "stellar mass fraction is displayed separately and in combination with condensed gas .",
    "hence , the bottom - left panel is the true measure of condensed matter in the simulation .",
    "the line styles denoting the different simulations are the same throughout this paper : @xmath46 dotted , @xmath47 solid , and @xmath0 long - dashed .",
    "the higher gas density in high @xmath1 cosmologies clearly promotes more aggressive cooling , which in turn enhances star formation activity .",
    "the fraction in the diffuse component reflects the original state of the gas and is largely unaffected by variations in global baryon density .",
    "hence , the increased mass in condensed baryons is offset by a deficit in shocked gas .",
    "the fact that the condensed and shocked phases establish a balance while leaving the diffuse component unchanged indicates that the gas is shocked in high - density regions physically proximate to the cooling gas , but not in regions that harbor the diffuse component .",
    "table  [ tab : fits ] shows the results of fitting a power law in @xmath1 for each of the five components . as one would surmise from figure  [ fig : phases ] , the diffuse component exhibits little @xmath1 dependence .",
    "the baryon dependence of the shocked component is difficult to characterize by a power - law because it varies more strongly when changing @xmath1 from 0.02 to 0.05 than from 0.05 to 0.125 ; in the latter case , the removal of shocked gas to the condensed / stellar phases is partly compensated by a small drop in the diffuse phase .",
    "the fractions of baryons in the condensed and stellar phases scale fairly well with @xmath1 and can be approximated by power laws that vary approximately as @xmath6 , with the exact scaling depending on the precise phase and redshift .",
    "the errors in the @xmath48 fit to the exponent are minimal , although it is difficult to assign formal errors to the quantities in figure  [ fig : phases ] .",

    "if we used the same uv background intensity in all three simulations , then the higher @xmath1 runs would have higher gas densities , higher neutral fractions , and a higher mean opacity of the laf .",
    "instead we follow the by now standard procedure of adjusting the uv background intensity ( which is observationally quite uncertain ) so that each simulation reproduces the observed mean opacity ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "table  [ tab : mean ] lists the factors by which we must multiply the @xcite background intensities to match the press et al .",
    "( 1993 ) values of the laf mean flux decrement in the three simulations at each redshift .",
    "these factors scale roughly as @xmath2 .",
    "figure  [ fig : zooplots ] shows spectra and 1-d profiles along four randomly selected lines of sight through the simulations at @xmath17 .",
    "the gas density profiles ( 2nd panel up in each case ) are virtually identical when computed in units of the mean baryon density . random lines of sight intersect regions of low to moderate overdensity , where changing the baryon fraction has negligible impact on the density field .",
    "neutral fractions ( 3rd panel up ) are higher for lower @xmath1 , as they must be to maintain a constant value of the mean flux decrement ( which scales roughly with the mean neutral hydrogen density ) . temperatures ( bottom panel ) are higher for higher @xmath1 because the higher photoionization rate leads to more rapid heating , while the cooling , which is dominated by adiabatic expansion in these low density regions , stays constant .",
    "these higher temperatures are the reason that the required uv background intensity scales as @xmath2 rather than @xmath5 as one might naively expect .",
    "higher temperatures reduce the recombination coefficient , so the neutral fraction at fixed photoionization rate does not grow as fast as @xmath1 .",
    "the top panels in figure  [ fig : zooplots ] show the synthetic spectra themselves , and they are virtually indistinguishable for the three different @xmath1 values . because the gas overdensity structure is nearly independent of @xmath1 , normalizing the uv background to match a fixed mean decrement makes the spectra match point by point , with only a minor difference caused by differences in thermal broadening .",
    "figure  [ fig : zooplots ] thus provides strong backing for the standard practice of scaling laf spectra derived from hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "when gas temperatures are set by the interplay between photoionization heating and adiabatic cooling , as they are here , then the parameter combination constrained by the observed mean opacity scales as @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the hi photoionization rate .",

    "we mean the number of systems with @xmath58 ( dla ) or @xmath59 ( ll ) intercepted along a line of sight per unit redshift .",
    "although our simulations only resolve halos with virial radius circular velocities @xmath60 , gkhw find that a significant fraction , possibly even the majority , of the dla and ll incidence arises in halos less than this cutoff .",
    "consequently , in comparing our simulated @xmath57 to observational values in figure  [ fig : dlall ] , we would expect our results to be below what is observed and serve as lower limits .",
    "however , given that all three simulations have the same mass resolution , we can compare the simulations against one another to understand how dla and ll incidence is affected by @xmath1 .",
    "gkhw and gardner ( 1997 ) demonstrated that the cross - section of halos harboring dla and ll absorbers was a complex function of halo mass , interaction history , and cooling time .",
    "specifically , absorbers that are able to cool more quickly tend to have more mass in cooled neutral gas but also _ smaller _ cross - sections as the gas tends to collapse more tightly .",
    "the competing effect that helps determine the halo absorption cross - section is that higher mass halos tend to harbor more absorbers , thus increasing the overall absorption cross - section with mass .",
    "the incidence of dla and ll systems , however , follows the intuitive expectation that a higher @xmath1 means more absorbers . if we examine the results on a halo by halo basis ( not shown ) we find that , in general , the scaling in figure  [ fig : dlall ] results from halos of all masses having uniformly larger absorption cross - sections in higher @xmath1 models .",
    "hence , although the complex link between gas mass and dla / ll cross - section need not have yielded an intuitive relationship between cross - section and @xmath1 , dla and ll incidence does appear to scale in a relatively simple manner with the universal baryon fraction .",
    "-0.65 in + -0.2 in    we now examine the behavior of baryons within collapsed objects , specifically groups which have been identified with the fof algorithm and are above the mass resolution cutoff . cold collapsed gas and stars ( ccgs ) in each halo are identified using skid as detailed in section  [ ssec : ident ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : baryonfrac ] compares the baryonic fraction and the fraction of baryons in ccgs in each of the simulations .",
    "given that the simulations have the same total mass and were run from exactly the same initial waves , it is simple to identify the corresponding halos in each simulation . each point in figure  [ fig : baryonfrac ] represents the same halo identified in all three simulations and matched based on its position .",
    "looking at the top panels , we notice that at @xmath17 the baryonic fraction of halos normalized to the baryonic fraction of the universe as a whole is insensitive to @xmath1 for @xmath61 , i.e. the baryonic fraction of a halo just scales linearly with @xmath1 .",
    "interestingly , the average baryonic fraction of halos in these models is greater than the universal fraction .",
    "thus , somehow baryons are managing to collapse more readily than the dark matter , indicating that collapse beyond the boundaries of dark matter halos is not purely gravitationally driven .",
    "we examine this topic in gardner  ( 2001b ) . the @xmath0 model , however , does not have an overabundance of baryons , showing that the process is nonlinear below some mass or density threshold .",
    "larger numbers of baryons within dark matter halos do uniformly lead to enhanced cooling and collapse , as evidenced by the lower panels in figure  [ fig : baryonfrac ] . hence , more baryons in the universe cause a greater fraction of them to become galactic ccgs",
    ". we will examine the effect of this on galaxy properties in the next section .",
    "-0.65 in + -0.2 in    next , let us turn our attention to the ccgs .",
    "the upper panel of figure  [ fig : matchplot ] is consistent with figure  [ fig : baryonfrac ] in that both sets of points lie above the dashed line , indicating a greater than linear dependence of ccgs mass on @xmath1 .",
    "the scaling goes as @xmath62 in the redshift range @xmath63 ( only the @xmath17 data are shown in figure  [ fig : matchplot ] ) .",
    "more ccgs also produces more stars ( as opposed to just cold collapsed gas ) , as evidenced by the middle panels .",
    "stellar mass scales similarly to ccgs as @xmath64 .",
    "both scalings are listed in table  [ tab : halofits ] .",
    "most likely , there is a critical gas mass required in the central regions of our simulated galaxies for star formation to occur efficiently . the horizontal features at low halo stellar masses indicate that star formation is severely damped at these masses for lower @xmath1 when compared to their higher @xmath1 counterparts .",
    "all of the halos plotted in figure  [ fig : matchplot ] are above our resolution limit of 64 dark matter particles .",
    "even so , gkhw find similar behavior when comparing higher resolution simulations to lower resolution ones of the same cosmology .",
    "consequently , this is most likely a resolution effect .",
    "therefore , the scalings in @xmath1 reported above are calculated using only those points in the higher mass regions that are well approximated by a power law ( for the top and middle panels for masses greater than @xmath65 ; for the bottom panels for star formation rates greater than 0.85 m@xmath66 yr@xmath67 ) .",
    "one may note that the scalings given here are different from those in section  [ ssec : global ] . here",
    "we include only baryons in dark matter halos , whereas before we examined all baryons .",
    "we believe that the steeper scaling of the global quantities could also be due to a resolution artifact .",
    "halos at the limit of our resolution cross a critical threshold when the gas particles are more massive , higher @xmath1 , but do not cross that threshold when the gas particles are less massive , lower @xmath1 . remember that the number of gas particles is the same for all the simulations ; we change @xmath1 by altering the gas particle mass .",
    "although the star formation rate is not shown for redshifts @xmath68 , the @xmath1 scaling does depend strongly on redshift , going as @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath6 for redshifts 2 , 3 , and 4 , respectively .",
    "owing to the large scatter , it is difficult to achieve the precision of the stellar and ccgs mass measurements .",
    "however , it is clear that the star formation rate scales beyond simple linearity . given that that the relation is close to linear for @xmath71 , the increased stellar mass in the middle panels most likely comes from a higher star formation rate at earlier redshifts .",
    "the careful reader will note that there are points below @xmath72 for the @xmath47 run in the left panel in the middle row but not in the right panel .",
    "this is because the halos in the @xmath47 run with such a low stellar mass have no skid - identifiable groups at all in the @xmath0 run and hence are not included in the @xmath47 vs.  @xmath0 plot . since gas particle mass scales with @xmath1 ,",
    "we _ would _ expect to detect skid groups in both simulations if stellar mass scaled simply with @xmath1 .",
    "the fact that there are no skid groups in the low @xmath1 halos that have skid groups at higher baryon abundance again indicates a steep @xmath1 dependence .",
    "-0.65 in + -0.2 in    -0.65 in + -0.2 in    -0.65 in + -0.2 in    in this section , we concentrate on the effect of universal baryon fraction on galaxies .",
    "in contrast to the previous sections , here we consider skid - identified groups of gas and stars  galaxies in our simulations  irrespective of their parent fof - identified parent halos .",
    "we keep plotted values in units unnormalized to the universal fraction to more easily relate them to observables .",
    "figure  [ fig : stargassmass ] plots the cumulative comoving number density of galaxies @xmath73 with mass @xmath74 in stars or @xmath75 in ccgs , while figure  [ fig : starform ] plots the cumulative number of galaxies with at least a given star formation rate ( sfr ) .",
    "given that the halo mass function is essentially identical in all three simulations , the plots indicate a direct correspondence between @xmath1 and typical galaxy gas , stellar mass and star formation rate .",
    "figure  [ fig : madauplot ] gives the total star formation rate in resolved galaxies as a function of redshift for all three simulations .",
    "note that this does not include star formation in galaxies with @xmath76 , which make a significant contribution to the total star formation rate at high redshift .",
    "the global sfr is a strong function of the universal baryon fraction and is well approximated by a power law .",

    "shocked and condensed gas , however , exchange abundances with condensed gas being more prevalent in higher @xmath1 universes while less mass is contained in the shocked phase .",

    "( 2001 ) who find that galaxies gain mass mostly through the smooth accretion of cooling gas and not through merging .",

    "the required uv background intensity scales approximately as @xmath2 , and diffuse gas in a higher @xmath1 model is slightly hotter because of the higher photoionization rate .",
    "the gas overdensity field is essentially independent of @xmath1 in diffuse regions , and higher neutral fractions compensate for lower gas densities when @xmath1 is low , so synthetic spectra are virtually identical for different values of @xmath1 .",

    "the @xmath1 dependence is much stronger for dla absorption than for ll absorption , and it is somewhat stronger at @xmath4 than at @xmath3 .",
    "our simulations only resolve baryon concentrations in halos with @xmath77 , and they therefore underestimate the total incidence of dla and ll absorption .",
    "however , the trend of increased absorption with increasing @xmath1 holds on a halo - by - halo basis within the mass range that we do resolve , so we expect that it would continue to apply to the absorption in all halos .    taken together ,",
    "our results imply a relative simple picture of the influence of @xmath1 on high - redshift structure .",
    "the amount of gas in the diffuse phase is essentially unaffected by changes in @xmath1 , and the laf absorption produced by this gas is unchanged if the uv background is adjusted to keep the mean opacity fixed . the increased cooling in models with high @xmath1 shifts gas from the shocked phase to the condensed phase , increasing the stellar and gas masses of galaxies , the rates of star formation , and the amount of high column density absorption . while the @xmath1-scalings of these quantities that are listed in table  [ tab : fits ] are not guaranteed to hold in other cosmologies or other ranges of redshift and galaxy mass , they provide a best guess for how to scale the predictions of hydrodynamic simulations to alternative values of @xmath1 .",
