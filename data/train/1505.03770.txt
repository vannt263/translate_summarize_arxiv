    "variational ideas play an important role in various areas of mathematical general relativity e.g . in the adm formalism @xcite , in the analysis of penrose - like inequalities @xcite or in the analysis of area - angular momentum inequalities @xcite to mention some .",
    "similarly , spinorial methods constitute a powerful tool for the analysis and manipulation of the einstein field equations and their solutions most notably the proof of the positivity of the mass by witten @xcite and the analysis of linearised gravity , see e.g. @xcite .    to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "all available treatments of calculus of variations and linerisations in spinorial settings make use of computations in terms of components with respect to a dyad .",
    "it is therefore of interest to have a setup for performing a dyad - independent calculus of variations and computation of linearisations with spinors .",
    "the purpose of the present article is to develop such a setup .",
    "we expect this formalism to be of great value in both the analysis of the notion of non - kerrness introduced in @xcite and positivity of the mass in @xcite , as well as in a covariant analysis of linearised gravity .",
    "the transformation properties of tensors and spinors pose some conceptual subtleties which have to be taken into account when computing variations of the basic tensorial and spinorial structures .",
    "it is possible to have variations of of these structures which are _ pure gauge_. this difficulty is usually dealt with by a careful fixing of the gauge in some geometrically convenient manner .",
    "one thus makes calculus of variations in a specific gauge and has to be careful in distinguishing between properties which are specific to the particular gauge and those which are generic .",
    "this situation becomes even more complicated as , in principle , both the tensorial and spinorial structures are allowed to vary simultaneously .    in this article",
    "it is shown that it is possible to define a _ modified variation operator _ which absorbs gauge terms in the variation of spinorial fields and thus , allows to perform _",
    "covariant variations_. the idea behind this modified variation operator is similar to that behind the derivative operators in the ghp formalism which absorb terms associated to the freedom in a np tetrad see @xcite .",
    "as a result of our analysis we are able to obtain expressions involving abstract tensors and spinors thus , they are valid in any system of coordinates , and therefore invariant under diffeomorphisms which are constant with respect to variations . however , linearisations of diffeomorphisms do affect our variational quantities .",
    "this is discussed in section  [ sec : diffeomorphisms ] , where we also find that the diffeomorphism freedom can be controled by a gauge source function .    finally , we point out that although our primary concern in this article is the construction of a formalism for the calculus of variations of expressions involving spinors in a 4-dimensional lorentzian manifold , the methods can be adapted to a space - spinor formalism on 3-dimensional riemannian manifolds .",

    "for valence 1 space spinors we define the modified variation operator @xmath99 via @xmath289 these relations extend to higher valence spinors via the leibnitz rule .    in the same way as for the spacetime variations ,",
    "we get a relation between @xmath99 and spin frame component variation : @xmath290    the reality of @xmath90 and gives @xmath291 expanding the frame index in equation and taking hermitian conjugate yields @xmath292 hence , the operation of hermitian conjugation and the modified variation @xmath99 commute .",
    "let @xmath293 denote the space spinor version of the trace free ricci tensor , and let @xmath294 be the ricci scalar .",
    "define @xmath295 similarly to the case of spacetime spinors , we can compute the variation of a covariant derivative .",
    "the variation of a covariant space - spinor derivative is given by @xmath296    we also get @xmath297      to analyse the dependence of the formalism on diffeomorphisms , we proceed in the same way as in section  [ sec : diffeomorphisms ] .",
    "accordingly , let @xmath225 be a one parameter group of diffeomorphisms generated by a vector field @xmath226 .",
    "now , let @xmath298=\\phi^*_{-\\lambda}\\mathring h_{ab}$ ] .",
    "all members of the family @xmath298 $ ] will have the same geometric content and we get @xmath299 moreover , one has that @xmath300 again , we see that @xmath301 can be interpreted as a gauge source function for the linearised diffeomorphisms , but this time one needs to solve an elliptic equation instead of a wave equation to obtain @xmath302 from @xmath301 .      by computing the variation of the commutator relations    @xmath303",
    "we get , after calculations similar to those carried out in the spacetime case , the variation of the curvature .",
    "the variation of the spatial curvature spinors is given by @xmath304    computing the variation of relation gives @xmath305 computing the variation of relation gives @xmath306    for a pure gauge transformation , we get @xmath307 where @xmath308",

    "the purpose of this appendix is to discuss some issues related to the gauge in the frame and spin dyad formalisms .",
    "as it is well known , the metric @xmath16 is not determined in a unique way by the orthonormal coframe @xmath309 .",
    "any other coframe related to @xmath309 by means of a lorentz transformation i.e . a matrix @xmath310 such that @xmath311 it follows that @xmath312 is also orthonormal with respect to @xmath16 and one can write @xmath313 .",
    "the associated orthonormal frame is @xmath314 with @xmath315 where the last expression is a relation between matrices .",
    "the discussion in the previous paragraph can be extended to include spinors . making use of the infeld - van der waerden symbols ,",
    "equation can be rewritten as @xmath316 with @xmath317 .",
    "it can be shown that the spinorial components @xmath318 can be decomposed as @xmath319 where @xmath320 is a @xmath0 matrix .",
    "the latter naturally induces a change of spinorial basis via the relations @xmath321 with @xmath322 .",
    "crucially , one has that @xmath323      given a 3-dimensional negative - definite riemannian metric @xmath325 and an associated orthonormal coframe @xmath326 one has that @xmath327 any other coframe @xmath328 related to the coframe @xmath326 through the relation @xmath329 , where @xmath330 is a @xmath324-matrix , gives rise to the same metric .",
    "the defining condition for @xmath331 can be expressed as @xmath332    a direct calculation using the definition of the hermitian product shows that the changes of spin dyad preserving the hermitian structure induced by the hermitian spinor @xmath254 are of the form @xmath333 where @xmath334 are @xmath1 matrices . as @xmath1 is a subgroup of @xmath0 ,",
