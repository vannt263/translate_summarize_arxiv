    "a number of different mechanisms ( taking place in different environments ) have been proposed for the observed bimodality of the galaxy population , including , but not limited to , galaxy merging ( major and minor ) , galaxy strangulation and harassment , ram - pressure stripping as well as agn feedback ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "such mechanisms could regulate the observed optical colours of galaxies by influencing their key physical parameters such as star formation history ( sfh ) , mean age of stellar populations , the amount of dust attenuation , dust geometry and metallicity @xcite .",

    "galaxy morphology is a strong function of galaxy density , i.e. the morphology - density relation , and numerous studies since then have shown the dependence of galaxy properties on the local environment @xcite .",
    "for example , the red population is substantially dominated by early - type galaxies and thus preferentially found in high - galaxy density environments , while blue galaxies are predominantly late - type systems and mostly found in low - galaxy density environments , i.e. the colour - density relation . moreover",
    ", vast majority of galaxies in the blue cloud are actively forming stars while the red sequence consists mainly of passive galaxies with little or no ongoing star formation .",
    "there are also additional contributions to the red cloud from ( a ) heavily obscured star - forming or edge - on galaxies and ( b ) galaxies with passive disks , e.g. red spirals showing signs of low - level of star formation , which are known to be considerably redder and more massive than their blue / star - forming counterparts @xcite .",
    "it is noteworthy that the morphology - density and color - density relations evolve with redshift ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "analyses of the dust attenuation in active / star - forming galaxies suggest that in contrast to passive galaxies , they are heavily affected by dust @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the bulk of the dust in late - type galaxies is in the cold phase and as consequence emits at @xmath9100 , i.e. the far - infrared ( fir ) and wavelengths @xcite .",
    "such wavelengths are covered by the instruments on board the _ herschel space observatory _ @xcite .",
    "thus , the data collected by _",
    "herschel _ is uniquely suited to probe the dusty component , e.g. its characteristics and origin , in all type of galaxies , in particular early - type galaxies which contain significantly less dust than late - type systems .",
    "the existence of dust in early - type galaxies has been first reported from studying the absorption of stellar light @xcite and since then several studies have been conducted in order to shed light on the quantitative dust content of eary - type galaxies@xcite . however , data provided by _",
    "herschel _ have enabled us to study dust properties , e.g. its total luminosity , mass and temperature in early - type galaxies in an unprecedented manner due to a better sensitivity , resolution and/or the long wavelength coverage necessary @xcite .    among various surveys ,",

    "@xcite used data from the h - atlas sdp to study dust properties and star formation histories in a sample of low redshift galaxies ( z  @xmath13  0.5 ) detected at wavelengths .",
    "followed by classification of their sample based on optical morphology , @xcite found that @xmath12  4.1 per cent of all detections are early - type systems and that @xmath12  3.8 per cent ( 19 out of 496 ) of spiral galaxies with detections are passive . in another study and by using samples of early - type galaxies at low redshifts ( 0.013  @xmath13  z  @xmath13  0.06 ) ,",

    "finally 100 and 160   aperture flux densities were measured following matching each 250   source to the nearest pacs sources within a radius of 10 arcsec .",
    "a likelihood - ratio analysis @xcite was performed by @xcite to match 250   sources to the sdss dr7 @xcite sources brighter than r = 22.4 mag within a 10 arcsec radius .",

    "furthermore , the gama-_wise _  ( the wide - field infrared survey explorer ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) catalogue adds coverage in four mir bands at 3.4 , 4.6 , 12   and 22  @xcite .    in summary",
    ", we have at our disposal uv , optical and mir data as well as redshift estimates for the galaxies within the h - atlas / gama - overlapping area where all selected sources in our sample satisfy the following criteria :    * they all have sigma   detected at spire 250 .",
    "* they fall within the redshift range @xmath22 .",
    "we only select objects with a sufficiently reliable spectroscopic determination ( i.e. @xmath233 ; * ? ? ?",
    "all galaxies have a reliability parameter ( ` reliability `  @xmath20 0.8 ) of being associated with an optical counterpart in the sdss r - band catalogue , for which multi - wavelength photometry is available . as such , in addition to the 250   emission , all sources ( 7131 objects ) have corresponding fluxes ( all corrected for galactic extinction ) via aperture matched photometry in other bands ranging from uv to mir . *",
    "since a crucial aspect of our selection of red galaxies is based on the uv - optical ( ) colour , we remove from our sample those galaxies for which their nuv fluxes as estimated in gama , differ by more than @xmath90.5 magnitude from those retrieved through _ galex _ gr6 data release based on the all - sky imaging survey ( ais ) data products ( nuv depth @xmath24  20.8 mag ) . in addition , all selected sources have nuv magnitude errors , as provided by _",
    "galex_-gr6 , which are @xmath0 0.2 mag .",
    "this guarantees that all sources in our sample have enough signal - to - noise ratio in uv .",
    "the above constraints on uv fluxes , reduces our sample to 4016 sources . *",
    "finally since the physical parameters inferred for each galaxy are based on sed fitting techniques , an extra criterion has been applied in order to exclude sources ( 234 in total ) with poor quality sed fits ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : sed ] ) .",
    "after applying these selection criteria , we find @xmath25 galaxies with detections in at least nuv + _ u , g , r , i , z _ and 250   bands .",
    "distributions of the sdss @xmath26-band and nuv magnitudes for all galaxies as well as those qualified to be included for the subsequent data analysis are shown in panels of fig.[fig : petrosian - r ] . according to the first panel ,",
    "approximately @xmath1  13 per cent of the initial sources were excluded following the requirement of a uv detection for inclusion in the sample .",
    "but that does not seems to exclude systematically any particular type of sources as a kolmogorov - smirnov test ( ks test ) suggests a @xmath5  70.0 per cent probability that the distribution of sources detected at 250   is similar to the one being observed simultaneously in the 250 @xmath27 nuv bands .",
    "however by limiting errors in the nuv band to @xmath13  0.2 mag , more sources ( @xmath1 31 per cent ) are excluded in particular faint objects in the nuv band .",
    "a subset of sources have also detections in _ galex _ fuv , pacs ( 100  , 160  ) and spire ( 350  , 500  ) bands . _ wise _ data are available and recently have been cross - matched , with extended sources from _ wise _ accounted for correctly , for all gama fields .",
    "yet at the time of analysing galaxy seds in this work , _ wise _ data were only available for the g12 and g15 fields .",
    "thus , out of the 3782 sources , 2622 ( @xmath1 70 per cent ) have also aperture - matched _",
    "wise_-mir data .",
    "though the vast majority of galaxies at low redshift with detection are star - forming and optically blue , a small fraction of them are red in optical bands ( e.g. @xmath28 , @xmath14 ) .",
    "we separate blue and red galaxies in the sample using the uv - optical index .",
    "this is more robust than optical colour indices as it is more sensitive to recent star - formation activity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite separate red and blue galaxies in the h - atlas sample at  @xmath29  4.5 , estimated through fitting a double gaussian to the   colour distribution of galaxies , with redshifts @xmath22 ( i.e. similar to the present work ) , in the h - atlas sdp data .",
    "hence any source with nuv@xmath30 mag is considered as _ red _ , while _ blue _ objects are those with nuv@xmath31 mag . as fig.[fig : petrosian - r]a shows , the majority of the galaxies in our sample have apparent @xmath26-band magnitudes @xmath13  17.5 mag and nuv magnitudes @xmath5  19.0 mag .      in order to ensure that none of the emission has been contaminated by synchrotron emission from radio - jets hosted by active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , we find and exclude radio agn as follows .",
    "we cross matched the sdss position of our sources with those from the full , unfiltered radio - source catalogue of @xcite .",
    "the radio catalogue consists of all sources detected in the h - atlas phase 1 field by the nrao vla sky survey ( nvss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and , as such , contains 7823 sources .",
    "the outcome is 117 matches having separations of @xmath32  arcsec . in order to determine whether the radio emission was consistent with the presence of a radio - loud agn , we calculated @xmath33 , defined as :      where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are fluxes at 250   and 1.4-ghz for all matched sources respectively . if @xmath37 then part of the radio - emission is due to agn activity @xcite .",
    "conservatively , we exclude any source which satisfies this criterion in order to ensure none of the submm emission may be contaminated by radio agn activity .",
    "out of 117 sources with radio counterparts , only 13 sources ( 1 and 12 galaxies ) have @xmath37 and are thus excluded from the subsequent analysis .        the morphology of all 117 galaxies were examined from their sdss @xmath26-band images , following independent visual inspection by three team members .",
    "galaxies were classified into three categories of elliptical ( e ) , spiral ( s ) and uncertain ( u ) .",
    "the number of sources in each morphological type is 37 , 48 and 32 for the e , s and u galaxies respectively ( see fig.[fig : red - morphology - pie - chart ] ) .",
    "many of sources classified as u are too small in the sdss images to judge their morphology and can be of any type , i.e. spiral , elliptical or merging galaxies .    in order to test the validity of this morphological classification , we compared our classification to an independent morphological classification based on the index @xmath38 which we obtained from the sdss dr7 galaxy catalogue @xcite .",
    "different studies have adopted different thresholds of theindex above / below which a galaxy is considered as early / late type .",
    "for instance , @xcite adopts @xmath38=2.0 to divide their sample into early and late types though indices of @xmath392.5 have been also used to describe early - type sources ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "in fact the disk structure is extremely pronounced in highly inclined spiral galaxies and therefore the majority of galaxies in the s category are those having larger ellipticities .",
    "this is better shown in fig .",

    "inclinations are determined from the relation      in which @xmath47 is the ratio of the smallest to the largest axis of an oblate spheroid of rotation .",
    "we assume @xmath47 = 0.20 which is an appropriate value to use for the intrinsic flattening of the distribution of the light of galactic spheroids ( e.g. ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    unlike and -e galaxies ,",
    "the majority of -s galaxies are highly inclined .",
    "note that , even in the combined -u @xmath27 -s sample , there is still and excess of galaxies with relatively large inclination angles in comparison to the and -e samples .    to illustrate this , we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : red - morphology]c the distribution of inclination angles as expected from a random sampling .",
    "the observed difference between the distribution of -(s@xmath27u ) galaxies in comparison to a sample of simulated inclinations , suggests that the fraction of highly inclined systems in -(s@xmath27u ) sample is more than one would expect for a random distribution .",
    "this shows that the inclination angle play a non - negligible role in the observed red colour of -s systems .",
    "the main conclusion is that the -e sample consists of intrinsically red objects while the -s sample contains galaxies where inclination could be a dominant factor in determining the observed red optical colours .",
    "although these inclined sources are not the main interest of this paper , we do discuss some of their ensemble properties in sec .",

    "this is based on counting the number of nearest neighbours , i.e. the density within the distance to the nth nearest neighbour .",
    "hence , the surface density to the fifth nearest neighbour is calculated as :      where @xmath49 is the projected co - moving distance to the fifth nearest neighbour within a volume - limited density - defining population and relative velocity @xmath501000  km  s@xmath17 @xcite .",

    "[ fig : density - sigma5 ] displays histograms of the projected densities for and galaxies within the redshift range of @xmath52 and for all systems having @xmath54  @xmath55 .",
    "this decreases the overall number of galaxies by @xmath1  4.2 per cent ( out of 117 galaxies , two have @xmath56 and three have @xmath57  @xmath55 ) .",
    "although the highest observed density ( 1.5 @xmath58 2.5 ) is populated by a small fraction of the -e type systems which indeed are relatively massive galaxies , there is no significant difference between the distribution for the sources in any morphological type with respect to the one corresponding to the sample .",
    "this indicates that all galaxies , irrespective of their morphologies , reside in environments with similar densities .",

    "these templates are constructed by considering the spectral evolution of stellar populations that are born with a @xcite initial mass function ( imf ) in combination with infrared dust spectral libraries as described in @xcite .",
    "the model assumes that the energy from uv - optical radiation emitted by the stellar populations is absorbed by dust and re - radiated in the fir .",

    "the model also accounts for the enhanced attenuation of stellar radiation for stars located in star forming regions in comparison to older stars found elsewhere within the galaxy .",
    "as the magphys analysis is based on ab magnitudes , all available photometry ( aperture matched ) has been converted to the ab magnitude system before estimating their associated fluxes in units of jansky ( jy ) .",
