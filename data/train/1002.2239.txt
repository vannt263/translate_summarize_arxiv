    "clusters of galaxies are the most massive objects in the universe that have had time to virialize by the present epoch , making nearby clusters attractive targets for searches for a signature from dark matter annihilation .",
    "clusters are more distant , but more massive than dwarf spheroidal galaxies , and like dwarf spheroidals , they are very dark matter dominated and typically lie at high galactic latitudes where the contamination from galactic gamma - ray background emission is low . a common feature of the stable particle products resulting from the annihilation of weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) , prime candidates for dark matter , is a significant gamma - ray emission , though in addition dark matter annihilation is expected to yield a broad multiwavelength spectrum of emission @xcite . for a variety of particle models , the gamma - ray signal from the annihilation of dark matter in clusters was predicted to be potentially observable by the fermi gamma - ray space telescope @xcite .    in proto - typical wimp models , such as for neutralinos in the minimal supersymmetric extension to the standard model , gamma - ray emission results primarily from the decay of neutral pions produced as part of the annihilation products .",
    "for wimps annihilating primarily into leptons , such as the dark matter models proposed to explain the pamela positron excess @xcite , gamma - ray emission results instead dominantly from internal bremsstrahlung in the final state .",
    "in addition , these models lead to a large population of energetic @xmath51 and @xmath52 among the annihilation products ( hence the popularity as an explanation for the recent @xmath53 measurements ) which in turn lead to significant gamma - ray emission through the inverse compton scattering ( ic ) of cosmic microwave background photons ( cmb ) or other photon fields in the inter - galactic medium . the ic emission is particularly important in clusters which effectively confine cosmic ray electrons much longer than the time it takes them to lose energy through this mechanism",

    "dark matter annihilation is not the only potential source of gamma - ray emission from clusters of galaxies .",

    "collisions of relativistic protons with protons in the thermal intracluster medium would lead to gamma - ray emission through the decays of neutral pions produced in the collision .",
    "in addition , diffuse radio emission observed in many clusters reveals the presence of relativistic electrons , and similar to the dark matter case , ic scattering of background radiation by these relativistic electrons could also lead to detectable gamma - ray emission .",
    "the shape of the gamma - ray spectrum is generally expected to be different than that from dark matter annihilation , although sufficient statistics are required to distinguish between the two @xcite .    significant gamma - ray emission has not been detected from local clusters by fermi - lat in the first 11 months of observations @xcite , aside from the detection of the central radio galaxies in a couple of clusters @xcite .",

    ", the non - detection of local clusters and groups excludes models fitting the pamela positron excess with masses above @xmath103 tev for a @xmath72 final state . even for a smooth nfw dark matter profile with no substructure ,",
    "models fitting the pamela data with masses @xmath112 tev are excluded .",
    "unlike similar constraints placed by the non - detection of dwarf spheroidal galaxies by fermi - lat @xcite which depend sensitively on the model employed for the spatial diffusion of @xmath111 , the leakage of cosmic rays due to spatial diffusion in clusters is not expected to be significant or significantly reduce the ic gamma - ray emission .    with the inclusion of galactic scale substructure , the cluster gamma - ray constraints are beginning to probe some dark matter models annihilating to a @xmath71 or similar final state  producing a gamma - ray spectrum similar to what is expected in popular particle dark matter models , such as the neutralino  with thermal relic densities consistent with the observed universal matter density . including the contribution from smaller mass dark matter substructures , the constraints we obtain become increasingly tighter .",
    "in general , however , these constraints are a bit weaker than ( or in the most optimistic case similar to ) the constraints derived from the non - detection by fermi - lat of the best candidate dwarf spheroidal galaxies @xcite .    clusters of galaxies , an as - yet gamma - ray quiet source class , will continue to be monitored as the fermi telescope increases its observing time in survey mode .",
    "in addition , future investigations will improve these constraints through stacking of clusters , improvements in our understanding of the gamma - ray backgrounds , and searches for extended emission around clusters like perseus which host central gamma - ray agn .",
    "while the detection of a gamma - ray signal from clusters might be attributed to a variety of source mechanisms , including cosmic rays from merger or accretion shocks and particle dark matter annihilation or decay , as shown in the present study even null results imply interesting and compelling constraints .",
    "the _ fermi_/lat collaboration acknowledges generous ongoing support from a number of agencies and institutes that have supported both the development and the operation of the lat as well as scientific data analysis .",
    "these include the national aeronautics and space administration and the department of energy in the united states , the commissariat  lenergie atomique and the centre national de la recherche scientifique / institut national de physique nuclaire et de physique des particules in france , the agenzia spaziale italiana and the istituto nazionale di fisica nucleare in italy , the ministry of education , culture , sports , science and technology ( mext ) , high energy accelerator research organization ( kek ) and japan aerospace exploration agency ( jaxa ) in japan , and the k.  a.  wallenberg foundation , the swedish research council and the swedish national space board in sweden .",
    "additional support for science analysis during the operations phase is gratefully acknowledged from the istituto nazionale di astrofisica in italy and the centre national dtudes spatiales in france .",

    "<S> nearby clusters and groups of galaxies are potentially bright sources of high - energy gamma - ray emission resulting from the pair - annihilation of dark matter particles . </S>",
    "<S> however , no significant gamma - ray emission has been detected so far from clusters in the first 11 months of observations with the fermi large area telescope . </S>",
    "<S> we interpret this non - detection in terms of constraints on dark matter particle properties . </S>",
    "<S> in particular for leptonic annihilation final states and particle masses greater than @xmath0 gev , gamma - ray emission from inverse compton scattering of cmb photons is expected to dominate the dark matter annihilation signal from clusters , and our gamma - ray limits exclude large regions of the parameter space that would give a good fit to the recent anomalous pamela and fermi - lat electron - positron measurements . </S>",
    "<S> we also present constraints on the annihilation of more standard dark matter candidates , such as the lightest neutralino of supersymmetric models . </S>",
    "<S> the constraints are particularly strong when including the fact that clusters are known to contain substructure at least on galaxy scales , increasing the expected gamma - ray flux by a factor of @xmath1 over a smooth - halo assumption . </S>",
    "<S> we also explore the effect of uncertainties in cluster dark matter density profiles , finding a systematic uncertainty in the constraints of roughly a factor of two , but similar overall conclusions . in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we focus on deriving limits on dark matter models ; a more general consideration of the fermi - lat data on clusters and clusters as gamma - ray sources is forthcoming .    </S>",
