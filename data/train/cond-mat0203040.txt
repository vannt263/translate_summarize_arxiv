    "sand dunes develop wherever sand is exposed to an agitating medium such as air or water that lifts grains from the ground and entrains them into a surface flow .",
    "the diverse conditions of wind and of sand supply in different regions on earth give rise to a large variety of shapes of aeolian dunes @xcite .",
    "moreover , dunes have been found on the sea  bottom and even on mars @xcite . despite the long history of the subject ,",
    "the underlying physical mechanisms of dune formation are still not very well understood .",
    "how are aerodynamics ( hydrodynamics ) and the particular properties of granular matter acting together to create dunes ?",
    "how is the shape of a dune maintained when it moves ?",
    "since the macroscopic phenomena of interest are separated by many orders of magnitude from the grain scale and involve various coupled nonlinear processes such as turbulent air flow and grain hopping ( `` saltation '' ) , one is bound to devise some simplified models in order to address such questions .",
    "we will argue that approximate numerical models can only be successful if based on a sound qualitative understanding of the problem .",
    "therefore , our main aim is to identify the key mechanisms underlying dune formation and migration and incorporate them into a working minimal model of aeolian sand dunes , and we will emphasize generic aspects over the more specific details . for definiteness , the reader may find it helpful to think of isolated transverse dunes or crescent  shaped barchan dunes as major applications of the model .",
    "a schematic sketch of the height profile of a barchan is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : barchan ] .",
    "the broad phenomenology of aeolian and submarine land forms provides a large number of different characteristic structures that can certainly not all be described by the same simple model developed with the specific examples of barchan or transverse dunes in mind .",
    "however , we expect that our approach is amenable to future adaptations that make it applicable to a broader class of sand topographies on the one hand , and for quantitative investigations of more specific questions on the other hand .",
    "although the minimal model refers only to rather generic properties of the wind velocity field and the laws of aeolian sand transport , it can make interesting predictions about the surface profile , the development and position of the slip face , dune migration etc .",
    "that are insensitive to the simplifying assumptions .",
    "the main features of the model were already briefly presented in a recent letter @xcite .",
    "the present contribution gives a more comprehensive discussion of the model and tries to communicate its precise definition as well as its major predictions to an interdisciplinary readership .",
    "the model , as presented here , is restricted to a two  dimensional ( @xmath0 ) slice of a dune parallel to the unidirectional wind .",
    "( a generalization to @xmath1 problems is in preparation . )",
    "a further restriction is the neglect of ripples and direct slope effects onto the sand transport outside slip faces . although they have successfully been incorporated into continuum sand transport models @xcite similar to our own @xcite , we chose to disregard them for the present purpose and leave their integration to future work .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next introductory section",
    "we summarize some background knowledge and basic definitions .",
    "we will also introduce a naive `` zeroth order '' description of the wind shear stress and the induced aeolian sediment transport . its instructive failure to produce dune  like steady  state solutions will be a guide for identifying two relatively small effects ( the upwind shift of the maximum of the shear stress with respect to the topography and the saturation transients in the sand flux ) as key ingredients of a proper description of structure formation by aeolian sand transport .",
    "we will moreover derive the scaling behavior of the migration velocity for translation invariant heaps and dunes of different size but similar shape based on very general grounds .",
    "sections  [ sec : wind ] and [ sec : saltation ] are devoted to the definition of the minimal model , i.e. , to the modeling of the air shear stress exerted onto a heap of sand and the induced sand transport , respectively .",
    "the first step builds on turbulent boundary layer calculations developed in a series of publications mainly by hunt and coworkers @xcite , the second one on a previous contribution @xcite by the present authors .",
    "only the most pertinent results of these earlier developments will be summarized here . in the remainder",
    ", we will derive some important predictions of the model for the central slice of a barchan dune or transverse dune .",
    "in particular , we will demonstrate that there is a minimal dune size .",
    "although we will thereby gain interesting results , these are rather meant to be illustrative examples of possible applications of the model . by no means",
    "do we attempt to provide a complete analysis of its predictions , and it should become obvious that much more remains still to be done . finally we will summarize our main results and speculate about probable consequences of the present @xmath0 theory for @xmath1 topographies .    ) over a concave slip face . ]",
    "before going into the description of the model , we want to recall some general background and to introduce some quantities of major interest .",
    "first of all , for convenience , we will usually refer to dunes without slip face as heaps .",
    "further , we will sometimes find it helpful to focus on isolated heaps or dunes on bedrock , although most of our discussion is not restricted to this situation .",
    "the key quantity for the description of the formation and migration of sand dunes and heaps is the local horizontal surface velocity @xmath2 of a sand height profile @xmath3 at all positions @xmath4 and times @xmath5 . via mass conservation",
    "it can be related to the erosion rate @xmath6 ( negative erosion is deposition ) , where the sand flux @xmath7 is defined as the mass of sand transported per unit of time across a hyper  plane transverse to the wind direction .",
    "more precisely , since we want to specialize our discussion to a @xmath0 slice parallel to the unidirectional wind velocity , the hyperplane is a vertical line and @xmath8 is a flux per unit width .",
    "mass conservation then takes the form of a continuity equation for the height profile @xmath9 with @xmath10 the density of the sand bed .    with eq.([eq :",
    "mass ] ) one can write the position dependent migration velocity at a given time @xmath5 as @xmath11 where we have introduced the shorthand notation @xmath12 . at this stage",
    "we can already get some physical insight by observing that this equation needs special attention at the top of a heap or dune , where we expect the denominator to vanish . for @xmath13 to remain finite at the crest as required in the steady state , there are in general only two possibilities .",
    "either the sand flux @xmath8 is fine tuned so that the erosion @xmath14 vanishes in exactly the same way as the slope @xmath15 , or the profile @xmath16 is not differentiable at the crest . as the reader may already anticipate and",
    "will be verified below , both cases have their physical realizations , the former in heaps or small dunes with smooth crests and the latter in large dunes with a slip face that terminates in a sharp brink .",
    "the problem we face , if we want to calculate the dynamic evolution of desert topographies , is the closure of eq.([eq : mass ] ) or ( [ eq : v_def ] ) by expressing the flux @xmath7 in terms of the height profile @xmath3 and the external wind and boundary conditions .",
    "since for the applications we have in mind , the migration velocity is very small compared to the speed of elementary sand transport processes ( grain hopping etc . ) and the wind speed , the topography can be assumed to be stationary for considerations concerning the wind and sand transport dynamics .",
    "this allows one to subdivide the problem of calculating @xmath17 into two independent steps .",
    "first , one needs to know the stationary wind velocity above a given topography .",
    "more precisely , what is required is the shear stress @xmath18 exerted by the wind onto the ground . and",
    "secondly , one needs a model that predicts the stationary sand flux @xmath17 for a given stationary @xmath19 , schematically @xmath20 computing the derivative @xmath14 and integrating the mass conservation eq.([eq : mass ] ) then closes the model and allows one to predict the development of the surface profile in time . since aeolian dunes typically have relatively gentle slopes outside their slip face , we will at the present stage restrict the scope of the minimal model to this case and disregard in eq.([eq : task2 ] ) the direct slope effects @xmath21 onto the flux outside the slip face .    in special cases , the relations ( [ eq : task1 ] ) , ( [ eq : task2 ] )",
    "are phenomenologically and theoretically well established . for a flat surface , @xmath22 const . , it is well known @xcite that the mean turbulent wind velocity increases logarithmically with height above the surface . it can be characterized by a single characteristic velocity , the `` shear velocity '' @xmath23 defined by @xmath24 with @xmath25 the ( suitably time averaged ) shear stress and @xmath26 the density of air .",
    "since the shear stress of the air is transmitted to the surface , the latter can mobilize grains on a surface covered with sand , if it exceeds a threshold value @xmath27 . as a result",
    ", the wind entrains some grains into a surface layer flow .",
    "the grains advance mainly by an irregular hopping process ( `` saltation '' ) , thereby reducing the wind velocity in the surface layer . via this feed ",
    "back mechanism a unique relation between the shear stress @xmath18 and the sand flux @xmath8 is established in the equilibrium state .",
    "if @xmath18 is not too close to the threshold , this relation can approximately be represented as @xcite @xmath28 although a host of more accurate descriptions have been discussed in the literature @xcite and one of them will be part of our definition of the minimal model below , the simpler eq.([eq : bagnold ] ) will be sufficient for our qualitative discussion in the first part of the paper .",
    "the index @xmath29 in eq.([eq : bagnold ] ) emphasizes that such local relations are restricted to situations where the flux is saturated , that is , equal to its equilibrium transport capacity .",
    "this is certainly not the case near a boundary between uncovered and covered ground or on sloped beds . neglecting this restriction for the moment , eq.([eq : bagnold ] )",
    "predicts that the shear stress perturbation @xmath30 above a modulated topography @xmath16 is responsible for flux gradients @xmath31 that cause erosion and deposition and thus  according to eqs.([eq : mass ] ) , ( [ eq : v_def ] )  migration of the sand surface . explicitly closing the model by assuming that the shear stress is an affine function of the modulation of the topography ( @xmath32 ) leads to what we call the `` zeroth order '' model , which will briefly be analyzed in the next paragraph .",
    "the zeroth order model is given by @xmath33 where we have used the curly brackets to indicate a general functional dependence and introduced a characteristic length scale @xmath34 of the topography to normalize the height profile .",
    "( the motivation for the latter step will become clear in the next section . )",
    "the zeroth order model assumes _ local _ relations in eqs.([eq : task1]),([eq : task2 ] ) .",
    "it approximates the wind shear stress perturbation by its `` affine '' contribution ( proportional to the profile @xmath35 that causes the perturbation ) and replaces the true sand flux @xmath8 by its saturated value @xmath36 , thereby neglecting saturation transients .",
    "this model is so simple that its qualitative predictions for an arbitrary smooth heap of sand can easily be anticipated without doing any actual calculations .    combining eq.([eq : v_def ] ) with eqs.([eq : bagnold])([eq : q0 ] ) one obtains a surface velocity that increases with height ( @xmath37 ) due to the nonlinearity of eq.([eq : bagnold ] ) .",
    "this implies that the upwind ( or `` stoss '' ) slope tends to decrease and the downwind ( or `` lee '' ) slope tends to increase . since @xmath38 by the chain rule",
    ", there is no erosion or deposition at the top of a smooth heap , which therefore keeps its initial height .",
    "obviously , integrating forward in time will eventually increase the lee slope up to the angle of repose , where surface avalanches have to be introduced and a slip face of constant slope develops .",
    "if the latter reaches the crest the above argument for the persistence of the height can no longer be applied , because the slope at the crest is then ill defined .",
    "since there is so far nothing to stop a further decrease of the windward slope , the model dune will then start to decrease in height and finally flatten out .",
    "the steady  state solution is a flat surface .",
    "the simple argument shows that the zeroth order model  although it gives some clue as to the origin of the slip face  is insufficient for a proper qualitative understanding of dunes .",
    "however , some important lessons can be learned from it that will be helpful in our further investigation of the problem .",
    "first , even with a very simplistic model any reasonably heap  like initial condition will quickly develop into a dune  like shape with a slip face .",
    "secondly , although the latter may seem to converge to a steady  state solution for intermediate times , it finally turns out to be unstable and flattens out .",
    "the discussion of the migration velocity in section  [ sec : aeolian ] suggests that small deviations from eqs.([eq : tau0 ] ) and ( [ eq : q0 ] ) at the brink can make an important difference .",
    "obviously some caution is needed in judging the success of numerical models of dune formation . unless stability has explicitly been demonstrated , they may be suspected to fail in a similar way as the zeroth order model when integrated over sufficiently long times (",
    "which has actually not been checked for some models that can be found in the literature ) or to be sensitive to numerical errors at the brink .",
    "detailed numerical modeling should therefore be preceded by a sound qualitative understanding of the mechanisms underlying dune formation .",
    "we will argue in sections  [ sec : wind ] , [ sec : saltation ] that to this end a subtle balance between two small deviations from eqs.([eq : tau0]),([eq : q0 ] ) and especially non  local contributions in eq .",
    "( [ eq : task2 ] ) have to be taken into account .      before entering a detailed discussion of the minimal model",
    ", it is worth pausing for some general thoughts as to what can be said about the shear stress and the speed  up of the wind above an obstacle , without actually doing the ( somewhat involved ) calculation .",
    "a basic property of strongly developed turbulence is its dilation invariance or scale free structure . whereas general navier  stokes flow is invariant under a scale transformation that keeps the reynolds number constant , strongly turbulent flow ( for `` infinite '' reynolds number ) allows for infinitely many such similarity transformations .",
    "landau and lifshitz @xcite took advantage of this fact for deriving the logarithmic velocity profile mentioned above by an elegant scaling argument .",
    "the logarithmic velocity profile suggests that the speed  up of the wind and therefore also the shear stress perturbation above a heap of given shape should itself be logarithmically dependent on its size .",
    "but how do they depend on the shape of the obstacle ?",
    "since the flow itself does not provide any characteristic length scale , the dimensionless quantity @xmath39 defined in eq.([eq : tauhat ] ) can only depend on a dimensionless characterization of the profile @xmath16 .",
    "in other words , to lowest order in the perturbation , it must be a linear functional of the derivative @xmath15 and can be written as @xmath40 with a dimensionless profile function @xmath41 and a scale  free ( and necessarily non ",
    "local ) linear functional @xmath42 .",
    "this reasoning can be repeated for the dimensionless velocity and pressure perturbations .",
    "intuitively , the scaling @xmath43 for a flat smooth obstacle ( @xmath44 ) can be understood from fig .",
    "[ fig : scaling ] .",
    "when the air flows over the obstacle , the velocity close to the obstacle is deflected by an angle @xmath45 whereas it remains constant far above the obstacle .",
    "for incompressible flow , continuity translates this into a speed  up of order @xmath45 and ( via bernoulli s law ) into a corresponding pressure drop near the top of the heap .",
    "this in turn causes a shear stress perturbation @xmath39 of the same order .     above a flat heap of aspect ratio @xmath46",
    "the characteristic length scale @xmath34 is in this context conventionally often identified with the half length at half height of the heap .",
    "the vertical deflection causes a speed  up above the top of the heap .",
    "this is accompanied by a pressure perturbation that is negative above the top of the heap and positive at its tails . due to turbulence",
    ", the flow pattern is asymmetric even above a symmetric heap . ]",
    "these general considerations already allow us to predict the scaling of the migration velocity @xmath13 with dune size if we assume that dunes of different size have roughly similar shapes @xmath47 and aspect ratios @xmath45 , which is indeed suggested by the scale invariance of the turbulent wind field and by observations . inserting eq.([eq : scaling ] ) into eq.([eq : v_def ] ) , and again approximating eq.([eq : task2 ] ) by a local sand transport law @xmath48 , we find @xmath49 the final proportionality strictly holds only if the steady  state shape @xmath47 and aspect ratio @xmath45 are scale invariant .",
    "however , it can be expected to be robust and rather insensitive against violations of exact scale invariance .",
    "first , the normalized steady  state shapes @xmath47 are strongly constrained by the requirement that they render @xmath50 , independent of @xmath4 , along the heap .",
    "therefore , they should to a first approximation be independent of size , which is indeed borne out by the minimal model ( fig .",
    "[ fig : shapes ] ) and empirical observations @xcite .",
    "moreover , the dependence @xmath51 is rather indirect and can therefore be expected to be weak .",
    "secondly , eq.([eq : bagnold ] ) suggests that for gently sloped obstacles ( @xmath52 ) the dependence of @xmath53 on the aspect ratio @xmath45 also is not very pronounced . and finally ,",
    " due to the above mentioned scale invariance of turbulence  a scale invariant aspect ratio can reasonably be expected for large dunes .",
    "in fact , we will show below that the minimal model predicts that the aspect ratio of small heaps is not constant but rather decreases proportional to their height .",
    "but this also implies that the latter becomes too small to have a very significant effect on the above argument .",
    "note , however , that only for strictly scale invariant dunes , eq.([eq : v ] ) becomes identical to the often quoted observation that dunes migrate with a speed inversely proportional to their height @xcite .",
    "since the deviations of large dunes from scale invariance are not very pronounced , the difference between these predictions is not very strong except for small dunes and heaps . presently available field data",
    "are maybe not accurate enough to clearly distinguish between @xmath54 and @xmath55 , though some data support @xmath56 , most notably the comprehensive study of barchan dunes in southern peru by finkel @xcite .",
    "as we will show below , our numerical results for the minimal model clearly favor @xmath56 .",
    "we also note that together with eq.([eq : bagnold ] ) , eq.([eq : v ] ) moreover predicts that the migration velocity grows non  linearly with ( as the third power of ) the wind velocity",
    ". a more accurate relation can be obtained from the minimal model as described below , but the qualitative conclusion is the same .",
    "dunes can migrate farther in a short period of exceptionally strong wind than during much longer periods of gentle winds .",
    "finally , we should mention that some caution is needed when identifying the characteristic length scale @xmath34 in eq.([eq : v ] ) . in our discussion , we have so far assumed that @xmath47 is a smooth function , which is not the case for dunes with slip face .",
    "below we will argue that in this case @xmath57 should be identified with the envelope of the dune and its separation bubble and @xmath34 with the characteristic length scale of this envelope . for a barchan dune the latter",
    "practically coincides with the total length of the dune from its windward end to the tips of its horns ( cf.fig .",
    "[ fig : barchan ] ) .",
    "in contrast to the overall migration velocity of a translation invariant dune , the position dependent migration velocity @xmath58 that determines that shape is much harder to obtain since it requires a precise knowledge of the non  local functional @xmath42 in eq.([eq : scaling ] ) . this will be provided in the following section .",
    "the discussion in the preceding paragraph showed that  in contrast to the assumption in eq.([eq : tau0 ] )  the dependence of the shear stress on the height profile is non  local .",
    "although it will turn out that this shortcoming of eq.([eq : tau0 ] ) is not responsible for the failure of the zeroth order model , it should by now have become apparent that further progress can hardly be achieved without a rather detailed understanding of the turbulent wind field above heaps and dunes . for dunes with a slip face that typically has a slope of about @xmath59 and terminates in a sharp brink , the situation is similar to the textbook example of a backward facing step , which has the reputation of a test case for numerical turbulent models . even if a commercial turbulent solver is used , the accurate calculation of the shear stress e.g.  on a barchan dune is a non ",
    "trivial task and quite demanding in computer time and memory , and the most interesting long  time dynamics of dunes is therefore difficult to access .",
    "for this reason , we want to focus on flat smooth heaps , first . in this case",
    ", one can apply an analytical perturbation theory for turbulent boundary layer flow over smooth hills that has been developed over the last decades @xcite . though the calculation is essentially a formalization of the intuitive description accompanying fig .",
    "[ fig : scaling ] , it requires a highly non  trivial boundary layer construction that we will not recapitulate here .",
    "the interested reader is referred to the original literature .",

    "we also have introduced the von krmn constant @xmath75 and euler s constant @xmath76 . a practical approximation for @xmath77",

    "this is a crucial step in the construction of a minimal model of aeolian sand dunes , since the enormous complexity of the turbulent air flow over structured terrain otherwise severely restricts the possible applications of the model .",

    "this is indeed consistent with observations for large dunes .",
    "together with the good representation of the windward profiles of large dunes @xcite by @xmath128 ( @xmath167 ) , it suggests that the given description becomes qualitatively correct in the limit of large dune sizes .",

    "as outlined in eq.([eq : task2 ] ) , the second task in the specification of the minimal model is to find a prescription for calculating the sand flux @xmath17 for a given topography @xmath16 and shear stress @xmath19 .",
    "so far , we have been using the local saturated  flux approximation eq.([eq : q0 ] ) in our qualitative arguments . however , a closer look at the predictions obtained within this approximation reveals a number of inconsistencies .",
    "first , as we have already noted in the discussion of fig .",
    "[ fig : v ] , the use of eq.([eq : q0 ] ) together with the complete wind model of section  [ sec : wind ] leads to the odd prediction of deposition at the windward foot of an isolated heap or dune , where the shear stress decreases .",
    "this defect of eq.([eq : q0 ] ) has been noticed in the literature before ( see e.g.  refs.@xcite ) .",
    "previous numerical studies tried to avoid this problem by focusing onto the short time behavior and by introducing _",
    "ad hoc _ heuristic methods such as a `` smoothing operator '' @xcite or an `` adaptation length '' @xcite .",
    "the reason for the problem is that the saturated  flux approximation breaks down at a boundary ground / sand . as another shortcoming",
    ", we want to mention that the model as discussed so far predicts a universal scale invariant dune shape with a brink that is displaced slightly upwind from the maximum of the envelope , leading always to a positive slope at the brink .",
    "a glance at a real dune field proves that the latter is not always the case and careful measurements @xcite have revealed systematic deviations from scale invariance .",
    "though less obvious , it turns out that the reason for this discrepancy lies again in the saturated  flux approximation .",
    "both mentioned problems are thus naturally resolved by introducing a slightly more general sand transport law that allows for saturation transients .",
    "the saturated  flux approximation eq.([eq : q0 ] ) assumes that the flux is everywhere equal to the equilibrium transport capacity @xmath36 of the wind .",
    "however , due to variable wind or sand conditions , the actual sand flux @xmath8 is in general different from @xmath36 .",
    "these deviations are called saturation transients , because they quickly relax to zero under homogeneous conditions .",
    "we have recently demonstrated @xcite that this relaxation occurs within a characteristic length scale , called the _ saturation length _ @xmath168 , which is related to ( but distinct from ) the mean saltation length of the grains .",
    "it was moreover shown how the introduction of saturation transients cures the problem of deposition at the windward foot of an isolated sand dune . here",
    ", we only summarize the most pertinent results of this earlier development in order to demonstrate how a size dependence of the dune shape naturally results as a consequence of saturation transients .",
    "the sand transport model of ref  @xcite is based on a mean  field like description of saltation .",
    "it models a typical grain that is accelerated by friction with the air and slowed down by dissipative interactions with the bed .",
    "the average properties of the complicated splash process @xcite are subsumed into two dimensionless parameters , an effective restitution coefficient @xmath169 for collisions with the bed , and a kinetic coefficient @xmath170 that characterizes the relaxation of the density of saltating grains to its saturated value . together with an effective height for the wind ",
    "grain interaction that enters only logarithmically , these are the only phenomenological parameters of the model .",
    "they have been determined by a comparison with experiments and grain scale simulations .",
    "formally , the model consists of two coupled differential equations for mass and momentum conservation , and a modified turbulent closure relation that accounts for the feedback of the saltating grains on the wind velocity .    for the present purpose ,",
    "the model can be simplified by taking advantage of the fact that the prevailing conditions in applications to dunes are typically well described by the steady  state ( @xmath171 ) version .",
    "further , the relaxation of the typical sand transport velocity can be assumed to be fast compared to the variations in the density of mobilized grains in the saltation layer . approximating the latter by",
    "its saturated value for the calculation of the effective wind speed @xmath172 via the modified turbulent closure , one can decouple the mass and momentum conservation equations . the whole model can then in a reasonable approximation be reduced to a single differential equation @xmath173 for the sand flux @xmath17 .",
    "the shear stress dependent parameters @xmath174 are immediately identified as the saturation length and the saturated flux , respectively .",
    "the equation for @xmath36 generalizes eq.([eq : bagnold ] ) to arbitrary wind speeds . in the following we specify the explicit expressions for both quantities as they result from the sand transport model of ref .",
    "@xcite , but the structure of eq.([eq : flux ] ) is thought to be more general and independent of the precise form of eq.([eq : ls ] ) .",
    "again , @xmath19 is the position dependent shear stress discussed in section  [ sec : wind ] and @xmath175 is the estimated impact shear stress threshold that corresponds to a critical shear velocity @xmath176 @xcite .",
    "( for simplicity , we do not introduce the additional threshold for purely aerodynamic entrainment here , but allow instead for a small residual influx even if the latter is nominally zero . ) to make the underlying structure of the model more palpable , we have expressed @xmath168 in terms of another characteristic length scale @xmath177 , which ( up to a numerical factor ) is the average saltation length of the grains .",
    "the latter  but not @xmath168  must always be considerably smaller than the dune length for the model to be applicable .",
    "further , we have decomposed @xmath36 into the saturated density @xmath178 and the effective sand transport velocity at saturation @xmath179 with @xmath172 the effective wind velocity that accelerates the grains , given by @xmath180 by @xmath181 we have denoted the gravitational acceleration and from ref  @xcite we adopt the ( approximate ) numerical values @xmath182 , @xmath183 , @xmath184 , @xmath185 , and @xmath186 m/s for the lag velocity of the grains .",
    "we note that these numerical values are not completely independent of each other and of the mentioned value for the impact threshold @xmath27 , due to the calibration of the sand transport model with experimental data @xcite . for convenience",
    "we show a plot of the saturation length @xmath168 obtained with these values in fig .  [",
    "fig : ls ] .",
    "this completes the definition of the sand transport part of the minimal model on gently sloped ground .     in meters as a function of the shear stress exerted by the wind onto the sand bed .",
    "this function sets the natural length scale for dunes and heaps . ]",
    "before we complete the general model definition by a brief paragraph on slip faces , we want to point out some implications of the model as developed so far .",
    "first , note that the full expression for @xmath36 given in eq.([eq : ls ] ) , contains eq.([eq : bagnold ] ) as a limiting case for strong winds but is better approximated by @xmath187 for moderate wind speeds . for weak flux gradients and strong winds",
    ", one may set the left hand side of eq.([eq : flux ] ) to zero , leading to @xmath188 .",
    "this is typically the case on most of the windward slope of a large dune , where the left hand side of eq.([eq : flux ] ) can roughly be estimated by @xmath189 .",
    "the local saturated  flux approximation with eq.([eq : bagnold ] ) for @xmath36 , which we have applied throughout our qualitative discussion so far , is thus asymptotically valid for large dunes and strong winds ( except near the windward foot of an isolated dune ) .",
    "this is what one might have expected in the first place , and the reader may wonder at this point how the saturation transients and their characteristic length scale @xmath168 can have the claimed importance .",
    "how can @xmath168 affect the shape of a dune that is typically about two orders of magnitude larger ?",
    "this apparent puzzle is now easily resolved by going back to figs .  [",
    "fig : hills ] , [ fig : sym_asym ] and eq.([eq : shift ] ) and by observing that the symmetry breaking shift @xmath131 of the location of the maximum of the shear stress with respect to that of the maximum of the height profile ( or envelope ) that is responsible for the finite windward slope and growth of dunes , is also of the order of some per cent of the total dune length . in summary , the longitudinal profile of dunes and heaps is determined by the competition of two quantitatively small but qualitatively crucial effects , one related to turbulent wind flow and the other to sediment transport .",
    "this may be the reason , why its explanation proved elusive for a long time .    to get a qualitative idea of the consequences of the introduction of the generalized non  local flux law in eq.([eq : flux ] ) as replacement for eq.([eq : q0 ] ) , we want again to go back to our discussion of the surface migration velocity of the cosine shaped heap @xmath128 in fig .",
    "[ fig : v ] .",
    "let us for the moment adopt a crude approximation and replace the expression for @xmath36 given in eq.([eq : ls ] ) by its simpler limiting form @xmath190 introduced in eq.([eq : bagnold ] ) .",
    "we also neglect the variation of @xmath168 on the dune and replace it by a ( fine  tuned ) constant @xmath191 . with an influx ( about @xmath192 for the solid and @xmath193 for the dashed line in the lower part of fig .  [",
    "fig : v ] ) one can thus achieve a fairly constant surface velocity over the _",
    "length of a cosine shaped heap .",
    "again the constancy is slightly better for @xmath194 than for @xmath117 .",
    "it is further improved by reducing the slope of the heap well below the optimum windward slope of the dune obtained for @xmath195 , as seen from a comparison of the solid line and the dashed line .",
    "we also note in passing that the influx needed to maintain the shape is increasing with decreasing slope .",
    "together , the plots in fig .",
    "[ fig : v ] confirms our claim that even an @xmath196 may visibly affect the overall shape of aeolian dunes .",
    "although , for the example shown in the lower part of fig .",
    "[ fig : v ] , the saturation length is only about @xmath197 of the heap length , the slip face instability is evidently completely washed out . altogether , this strongly suggests the existence of translation invariant cosine shaped heap solutions for the model .",
    "the ultimate proof will be provided by the numerical results presented in section  [ sec : solution ] , where the full form of @xmath36 and @xmath168 according to eq.([eq : ls ] ) will be used , but the present crude approximation already illustrates the main point , and also demonstrates that the behavior is a generic consequence of eq.([eq : ls ] ) and insensitive to the detailed form of the parameters @xmath198 and @xmath199 that may phenomenologically be somewhat different from the model prediction without affecting our general conclusions .",
    "an immediate consequence of the foregoing discussion is the existence of a minimum dune size . for small enough dunes ,",
    "the slip face instability is washed out by the saturation transients .",
    "one may also arrive at this conclusion from an analysis of heaps . to this end",
    "we observe that the value of the saturation length @xmath168 is a property of the wind velocity and the saltation kinetics and depends on the topography only indirectly through the variable shear stress @xmath18 .",
    "moreover , it is apparent from fig .",
    "[ fig : ls ] that this dependence becomes weak for strong winds . on the other hand ,",

    "as we have seen , a smooth heap can only be a translation invariant solution of the model if the lag ( of order @xmath168 ) of @xmath17 with respect to @xmath199 and the shift @xmath131 are fine  tuned to guarantee a vanishing erosion rate at the top of the heap . from this",
    "we expect heaps to obey @xmath200 to a first approximation",
    ". this condition can only be fulfilled if the aspect ratio @xmath45 of heaps grows proportional to their size ( i.e.  roughly @xmath201 ) .",
    "hence , in contrast to large dunes with slip face , for which we have argued that they are asymptotically scale invariant ( @xmath202 const . ) , heaps must have a strongly size dependent aspect ratio . as a consequence ,",
    "translation invariant heap solutions obviously can not exist beyond a certain critical size .",
    "a slip face will develop when the shear stress on the lee side of the heap drops below the threshold value @xmath27 , or at the latest , when the lee slope exceeds the critical slope for flow separation .",
    "this will be further analyzed in section  [ sec : solution ] .",
    "finally , we note that the steady  state flux of a heap can be estimated by the observation that the outflux is essentially determined by the strength of the reduction @xmath203 of the shear stress at the lee end of the heap . according to eq.([eq : scaling ] ) , the latter is ( for a given shape ) proportional to the aspect ratio @xmath45 . for qualitative purposes , the outflux @xmath204",
    "may thus be estimated in the saturated flux approximation with eqs.([eq : ls]),([eq : ueff]),([eq : scaling ] ) as @xmath205 where we have assumed @xmath206 ( fulfilled for moderate wind speeds and/or heaps near the critical heap size ) to linearize the expression for @xmath207 given in eq.([eq : ls ] ) . here",
    ", @xmath208 is the critical aspect ratio for which the shear stress on the lee drops below the threshold and the outflux vanishes .",
    "note that the latter increases with increasing shear stress whereas the heap length decreases according to eqs.([eq : ls ] ) , ( [ eq : heap_aspect ] ) .",
    "the effects of the two trends onto the critical heap mass could therefore partially cancel unless the lee slope exceeds the critical slope for flow separation .",
    "we have argued above that for large heaps ( @xmath209 ) , aeolian sediment transport tends to increase the downwind slope until it reaches the angle of repose of the grains . at this point ,",
    "any further increase of the lee slope initiates avalanches that restore a slope slightly below the static angle of repose and eventually create a slip face of a roughly uniform slope of about @xmath210 . since the physical modeling of this process itself is not a major objective of the present contribution , we can choose between different possible implementations for this phenomenon .",
    "in @xmath0 it is possible to represent the slip face as boundary condition for the sand transport .",
    "it is uniquely determined by its fixed uniform slope and mass conservation . however , with regard to a future generalization of the present @xmath0 model to @xmath1 we chose a more realistic implementation based on a widely  used avalanche model @xcite .",
    "the formulation of this model bears some close similarities with the sand transport model presented in the preceding paragraph , and thus suggests itself as a natural extension of the latter to the slip face .",
    "this completes the definition of the minimal model that will be solved numerically in the next section .",
    "apart from the model definition , the preceding sections have provided some qualitative insights into the main mechanisms responsible for dune formation and migration .",
    "now we are prepared to study numerically the quantitative predictions of the model .",
    "again , we emphasize that we only can explore some major features of the model in the present report , leaving many interesting questions and more systematic and quantitative parameter studies for future work .    for convenience , the solution procedure of the minimal model is summarized as a flow chart in fig .",
    "[ fig : flowchart ] .",
    "one starts with an initial profile @xmath211 ( typically @xmath119 or @xmath212 ) , checks whether a separation bubble has to be added for the calculation of the shear stress , then obtains the latter from eq.([eq : fourier_wind ] ) and uses the result as input for the iterative solution of the sand transport equation eq.([eq : flux ] ) .",
    "this finally gives the erosion / deposition needed to update the surface profile .",
    "technically , eq.([eq : fourier_wind ] ) is implemented as a fast  fourier  transform algorithm , and for the integration of eqs.([eq : flux ] ) and ( [ eq : mass ] ) an upwind discretization scheme is used .",

    "[ fig : flowchart ] can be iterated for different influx boundary conditions .",
    "for all of the numerical calculations presented below , we chose periodic boundary conditions .",

    "these solutions are obtained for fixed wind conditions with parameters @xmath214 and @xmath81 appropriate for the central slice of a @xmath1 ( symmetric ) heap or of a barchan dune .",
    "the shear velocity @xmath215 m / s lies well above the impact threshold .",
    "( the situation very close to or below the threshold would need special attention . ) as anticipated above , large dunes become asymptotically scale invariant .",
    "the asymptotic master curve for the windward profile is practically indistinguishable from the profile @xmath216 ( @xmath217 ) , and the slope at the brink is indeed positive .",
    "its average windward slope is inversely proportional to the value of the parameter @xmath69 given in eq.([eq : a_b ] ) . due to the additional terms in the expression eq.([eq : correction ] ) for the shear stress on dunes with a finite width , somewhat steeper average windward slopes are predicted for barchan dunes than for transverse dunes under identical influx and wind conditions .",
    "however , a detailed quantitative comparison is probably beyond the scope of the present semi  quantitative implementation . more important",
    "are the remarkable qualitative predictions of the model .",
    "in particular , the fact that dunes with slip face are only stable above a certain ( wind dependent ) critical size , whereas smooth steady  state heaps only exist below a critical size , deserves attention .",
    "we also note that the steady state is not always unique .",
    "there is a hysteretic regime , where the initial conditions can select one of two possible steady  state shapes and accordingly the masses for the two sets of profiles in fig .",
    "[ fig : shapes ] are not all distinct . the largest heaps in the upper plot were obtained from flat initial profiles @xmath119 , whereas the smallest dunes with slip face in the lower plot were obtained from steeper initial profiles @xmath119 of the same mass .",
    "especially , the dune with a negative slope at the brink could only be obtained from steep initial conditions . since under natural wind and sand conditions ,",
    "the initial conditions themselves will generally be heaps or dunes close to the steady state , one can say that the model predicts a critical heap size for slip face formation and a critical dune size for slip face destruction . in both cases",
    "the slip face is finite as a consequence of flow separation .",
    "the latter also allows a dune to be somewhat higher than a heap of the same mass , since its effective volume as seen by the average air flow is increased by the separation zone . as anticipated , the aspect ratio of the dunes is asymptotically constant , whereas it is strongly size ",
    "dependent for heaps .",

    ", we estimate @xmath34 by adding @xmath151 to the horizontal length from the windward foot of the dune to its crest , thus neglecting the weak slope dependence of the size of the separation bubble . obviously , the @xmath225scaling is superior for moderate winds and small dunes where @xmath223 systematically fails to describe the data .",
    "this is also supported by field data @xcite .",
    "both fits become identical in the scaling limit @xmath226 . due to the decrease of @xmath168 with the wind speed ,",
    "the latter is reached for smaller dunes at stronger winds .",
    "we have already pointed out that the choice of different boundary conditions for the flux allow a separate discussion of shape and mass stability .",
    "this is of practical importance , since ( in @xmath0 ) all steady  state shapes are unstable with respect to mass changes .",
    "if the influx of a steady  state solution deviates slightly from its corresponding steady  state flux , this solution will start to either shrink until it has flattened out or grow without bound . though the latter effect could ( but need not ) be a peculiarity of the vanishing outflux for @xmath0 dunes with slip face , at least the former generalizes to @xmath1 heaps .",
    "despite the fact that the steady  state shapes are ( locally ) stable attractors for the shape evolution under periodic flux conditions , mass stability can in general not be achieved under open boundary conditions .",
    "the situation is clarified in fig .",
    "[ fig : q_v ] .",
    "it depicts the steady  state sand flux @xmath8 over the bedrock as a function of aspect ratio .",
    "the numerical results nicely confirm our theoretical expectation from eq.([eq : outflux ] ) .",
    "for all dunes with slip face the flux vanishes identically in @xmath0 , whereas in general it grows with decreasing size for smooth heaps . for open boundary conditions , the line in fig .",
    "[ fig : q_v ] can be interpreted as an unstable phase boundary ( with hysteresis ) between infinitely growing and shrinking solutions .",
    "for example , a heap with influx slightly below the steady  state , will shrink a bit . to remain close to the steady  state shape",
    ", it will therefore mainly reduce its height , whereas its length will stay almost constant .",
    "due to the reduced aspect ratio @xmath45 , @xmath39 decreases in magnitude and the shear stress depression at the lee boundary is less pronounced .",
    "as a consequence there is less deposition on the downwind slope and the outflux is higher , so that the heap shrinks even more etc .",
    "a completely analogous reasoning applies to the opposite case of higher influx .",
    "the corresponding shape attractors are the scale invariant asymptotic dune shape and the flat surface , respectively .",
    "the above discussion explains , why isolated smooth aeolian sand heaps are rarely observed as distinct features of desert topographies . under approximately stationary wind and influx conditions they only exist as transient states that either vanish or develop into dunes with slip face . under variable wind and influx conditions ,",
    "the situation is less clear and deserves a detailed study of its own .",
    "for example , the model predicts that during a period of strong wind all dunes are driven towards the asymptotic shape .",
    "after a subsequent period of weak winds , finite size effects become more pronounced , and small dunes may develop longitudinal profiles like those in the hysteretic regime or even loose their slip face .",
    "again , the case @xmath227 of a shear stress close to or below the threshold shear stress needs special attention .",
    "the prevailing wind conditions as well as recent changes in the wind velocity are thus encoded in a complicated but comprehensible way in the shapes of the dunes in a dune field .",
    "this is a promising direction for further studies .",
    "one may hope that by systematic studies along these lines one will in the future be able to infer flow conditions in remote or uncomfortable places ( e.g.  on the sea bottom or on other planets ) by analyzing dune shapes .",
    "[ c]@xmath204 [ kgm@xmath228s@xmath228 ]     the figure may also be read as a phase diagram for the situation with open boundary conditions . in this case the steady  state solutions  though attractors for the shape  are unstable with respect to mass fluctuations . ]      as a first step towards an understanding of the effects of variable wind speeds ( for constant wind direction ) , this section is devoted to an exploratory study of the transient shape evolution .",
    "we restrict ourselves to periodic boundary conditions leaving the richer phase space of open boundary conditions for future studies .",
    "[ fig : growth ] shows two extreme scenarios . a flat initial condition with a mass greater than the critical mass for slip face formation ( a ) , and a steep initial condition with a mass below the critical mass for slip face destruction ( b ) .",
    "the steep initial condition gives rise to the temporary formation of a slip face that is finally washed out by the saturation transients , whereas the flat heap steepens until the shear stress on the lee falls to the threshold value .",
    "this causes complete deposition on the lee side of the heap . whether this happens before or with the onset of flow separation depends on wind and influx conditions .",
    "as it also depends on the precise numerical values of some of the phenomenological parameters of the model , a detailed parametric study is again beyond the scope of the present contribution .        although the times to reach the steady state are apparently somewhat longer for the flat initial condition , it is evident from fig .",
    "[ fig : growth ] that the relaxation dynamics is in general relatively fast even if the initial condition is far from the steady state shape .",
    "large dunes under low influx conditions as they prevail e.g.  in fields of isolated dunes should therefore be well described by an adiabatic approximation assuming that ( except after drastic changes in the wind and sand conditions as they occur during sand storms ) the dune is practically in a steady state .",
    "apart from the low influx , this also relies on the fact that virtually no sand is lost over the slip face . for a large isolated @xmath1",
    "barchan dune this implies that most of the sediment transported over the dune is actually trapped in a tread  milling flux , and only a small portion of the total flux is contributed by and contributes to the external flux .",
    "hence , under steady wind conditions these dunes are in a quasi steady state and thus very close to their true steady  state shape .",
    "investigation of the steady  state properties is therefore the starting point also for the study of their time evolution .",
    "moreover , this suggests that a comparison of our steady ",
    "state shapes to shapes obtained in field measurements is justified .",
    "in fact , the calculated shapes agree nicely with recent measurements for barchan dunes @xcite .",
    "the situation is less clear for small heaps , where mass losses can be of the order of the total flux and may thus lead to significant differences between the steady  state and the transient shapes under vanishing influx .    in the remainder of this section ,",
    "we want to investigate more closely the mechanism that drives the shape relaxation .",
    "as we have pointed out , the positions of the maximum of the sand flux and of the maximum of the profile must coincide in the steady state to make the erosion / deposition vanish at the crest .",
    "we have shown that for small heaps , this can be achieved by a fine  tuning of @xmath131 to about @xmath168 .",
    "in contrast , for large dunes and strong winds , @xmath230 , and the steady  state condition can only be met with a singularity at the crest .",
    "this important difference is exemplified by figs .",
    "[ fig : deltaheap ] and [ fig : deltadune ] .",
    "both figures show the evolution of the height and the displacements @xmath231 and @xmath232 of the locations of the maximum of the shear stress and of the maximum of the sand flux from the location of the top of the sand profile , respectively .",
    "the distance between both displacements is the lag of the flux with respect to the shear stress due to the saturation transients , and is therefore closely related to the saturation length @xmath168 for smooth surface profiles .",
    "it guarantees the proper vanishing of the erosion rate @xmath14 at the top of a steady  state heap where @xmath131 is finite , but vanishes for large steady  state dunes , where the slip face ends in a sharp brink singularity at which the grains fall into the wake and are quickly deposited .        . _",
    "lower part : _ height of the dune .",
    "_ upper part : _ distance of the locations of the maximum of the shear stress and of the maximum sand flux from the position of the top of the crest .",
    "the lag between shear stress and sand flux vanishes , when the slip face reaches the crest . ]",
    "in summary , we have shown that a simple minimal model for the wind  driven sediment transport over a sand dune is capable of explaining several important features of desert topographies . among them",
    "are the migration velocities of heaps and dunes , their shape along the wind direction and the existence of a minimal dune size and a maximum heap size .    as we have emphasized throughout this contribution and demonstrated by the numerical solutions in the preceding section , the symmetry breaking part of the shear stress exerted by turbulent air flow on an obstacle , and local deviations of the sediment flux from its equilibrium transport capacity ( `` saturation transients '' ) , are the essential ingredients in the modeling of aeolian sand dunes .",
    "it is exactly the balance of these two relatively small effects that is responsible for the relaxation of arbitrary initial conditions into a characteristic dune or heap shape .",
    "their neglect was responsible for the failure of the naive zeroth order model discussed in section  [ sec : zero ] .",
    "in hindsight we can say that it is not so much the quantitative errors but the omission of this _ qualitatively _ important mechanism , what makes the zeroth order model an insufficient description .",
    "in contrast , taking this balance properly into account , makes the minimal model structurally stable against the neglect of less significant quantitative details of the same order of magnitude .",
    "this direction was recently pursued further in an effort to calculate analytically certain steady state shapes of dunes and heaps by `` linearizing '' the minimal model @xcite .",
    "one may as well wish to proceed also into the opposite direction .",
    "after the basic mechanism is understood , more elaborate dune models can be constructed by putting some of the neglected details back into the description .",
    "detailed parametric studies of such a refined model for a certain dune type and comparison to field data would be very useful to test some of the less generic predictions of the underlying sand transport model @xcite , such as the shear stress dependence of the saturation length @xmath168 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ls ] ) .",
    "this is important , since , as we have shown , the variable parameter @xmath168 sets the characteristic length scale with respect to which dunes and heaps can be said to be large or small .",
    "phenomenological knowledge about @xmath168 is still very limited .",
    "more detailed studies could further be helpful to map out quantitative shape diagrams , of the type sketched qualitatively in fig .",
    "[ fig : shapediagram ] .",
    "these diagrams could be useful not only for the validation of the model , but also for the comparison of field data from different places with different prevailing wind and sand conditions .",
    "the migration velocity is constant along the rising lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : shapediagram ] , which were obtained from eq.([eq : v ] ) using @xmath233 together with eq.([eq : ls ] ) .",
    "they allow for example a comparison of the migration velocities of dunes of different sizes that are exposed to ( on average ) identical winds . or one may infer the average wind speed from measurements of sizes and migration velocities in a dune field . the falling lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : shapediagram ] are lines of constant shape , assuming that the latter is determined by @xmath234 .",
    "they may thus be used for correlating wind speeds with dune shapes . in general ( in particular for the full @xmath1 problem ) , such shape diagrams will be more complex since the influx is an additional important variable that we have neglected here , as it vanishes for @xmath0 dunes in the steady state .    moreover , as we pointed out , there are still many consequences of the present model that await a systematic investigation .",
    "and a major future task is finally the generalization of the present discussion to the @xmath1 case .",
    "a promising route could be the construction of an effectively sliced model that allows one to use the proposed model for the separation bubble and to keep the time  limiting calculation ( the integration of the flux equation ) effectively one  dimensional .",
    "the smaller transverse currents could be inferred from the sliced solution .",
    "a generalization of the flux equation to the @xmath0 surface of a @xmath1 dune is also feasible @xcite",
    ". a more ambitious task will eventually be the simulation of dune fields . whereas the existence of a minimum dune size could be obtained by an analysis of the shape stability alone , the question of a possible existence of a characteristic or maximum dune size in a dune field , depends on the mass balance of a dune in the complicated environment provided by the other dunes , and is much more difficult to answer @xcite ."
