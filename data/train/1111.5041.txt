    "since the discovery of sn 1987a , dust formation has been confirmed observationally in the ejecta of several core - collapse supernovae ( type ii sne ; e.g. , wooden et al .",
    "1993 , kozasa et at al .",
    "2009 ) . in these , one or more of the following signatures",
    "are observed @xmath5250 - 600 days after the initial explosion : ( 1 ) the development of an infrared excess seen in the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the sn ; ( 2 ) the appearance of blue - shifted optical / near - infrared lines , which is interpreted as the attenuation of the redshifted wing ( i.e. , the receding gas ) by dust formed homogeneously in the ejecta ; and ( 3 ) the steepening decline of the optical lightcurve consistent with an increase in circumstellar extinction .",
    "the sn luminosity after day @xmath5150 is supported by @xmath12 rays from @xmath6co decaying into @xmath6ni .",
    "if the dust is formed in sne , the optical luminosity from the sn remnant has become much fainter than would be produced by the radioactive decay power .    in order to properly assess dust formation by type ii sne ejecta it is essential to continue monitoring type ii sne before and after dust formation started ( i.e. day @xmath5300 ) because other physical properties such as the @xmath6ni mass and light echos from circumstellar and interstellar dust can be measured and disentangled from dust production effects .",
    "the early epoch evolution of type ii sne before day @xmath5300 has been relatively well studied in optical and near - ir bands .",
    "however at the present time , the evolution beyond day 300 has been poorly measured .    to address these issues ,",
    "we have conducted a long term photometric monitoring of sne using high angular resolution facilities such as hst / wfpc2/nicmos , wiyn / whirc , and gemini / niri through our sne project @xmath13 ( survey for evolution of emission from dust in sne , pi : m.barlow ) . in this paper",
    "we report on the late - epoch light - curves of 6 type ii sne .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we present the observations , data processing and resulting images , and light curves . in section 3 , we analyze the resulting light curves to derive @xmath6ni masses for all targets except for sn 1999bw and , for cases with detected light echoes , to estimate the density of the environment . in section 4 , we discuss the results for each sn . in section 5 , we do a comparative analysis of these sne in the context of physical properties reported in the literature , such as the amount of dust produced and progenitor mass .",
    "we chose 6 type ii sne in nearby galaxies , matching the following three criteria .",
    "( 1 ) the distance to a sn is within @xmath515 mpc and thus suitable for long - term follow - up observations with @xmath2 , @xmath14 , and @xmath14-m class ground based telescopes .",
    "( 2 ) at the start of the observations , the sn is 1 year or older after the initial explosion . (",
    "3 ) the expected @xmath15-band magnitude of targets is @xmath1628 based on the evolution of sn 1987a in order that the sne is detectable within a reasonable integration time .",
    "these 6 type ii sne include 4 type ii - p ( sne 2002hh , 2003gd , 2004et , and 2005cs ) , 1 type ii - n ( sn 1999bw ) , and 1 type ii - l or ii - p ( sn 2006bc ) .",
    "in addition , during our campaign , a supernova impostor , sn 2008s , erupted in the field of view of our sn 2002hh observations , allowing us to monitor this new type of variable as well .",
    "the high - angular resolution images of our target sne were taken by the hubble space telescope with the wide field planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) and the near infrared camera and multi - object spectrometer 2 ( nicmos2 ) through the cycle 16 proposal by m.meixner ( proposal i d : go 11229 ) .",
    "the observations were coordinated so that the wfpc2 and nicmos images were taken within days to a week of each other . in the wfpc2 observations",
    ", we took the images using the f450w , f606w , f622w , and f814w filters . in the nicmos2 observations",
    ", we took the images using the f110w , f160w , and f205w filters .",
    "the observation logs and sn positions are summarized in table [ obslog ] .",
    "the boldface coordinates in this table are derived from our f606w or f622w @xmath2 observations and the others are from the simbad database .",
    "the data reduction and calibration were performed by standard techniques . using the stsdas package version 3.8 specialized for @xmath2 , we reduced and calibrated the data , including cosmic rays and artificial features removal and detector linearity correction .",
    "the final high resolution images were created using the stsdas / drizzle package .",
    "for both the wfpc2 and nicmos2 observations , we conducted sub pixel scale dithering to improve s / n and remove cosmic rays and obtain further high - resolution images via the drizzle technique .",
    "we set 4 or 5 points dithering with 115 - 400sec per science frame for each band .",
    "after drizzle processing , we performed an additional distortion correction and alignment using background stars for the nicmos2 data . the point - spread - function ( psf ) of these reference background stars",
    "were fit by gaussian profiles to obtain accurate positions , and then instrumental distortions were corrected with the xyxymatch , geomap , and geotran iraf routines , and we aligned the positions of stars in the nicmos detector to those in the wfpc2 .",
    "the resultant plate scale reaches 0.025@xmath17 pixel@xmath18 in the wfpc2 and archived acs / hrc data ( see below ) and 0.04@xmath17 pixel@xmath18 in the nicmos2 and archival nicmos3 data ( see below ) , respectively .",
    "the size of the psf at fwhm typically corresponds to @xmath53 pixel . using the psf fitting package iraf / daophot ,",
    "photometry was performed on the images , except for sn 2005cs in f110w and f160w and sn 2002hh in all bands . for sn 2005cs in f110w and f160w ,",
    "we used differential images with pre - explosion images using archival nicmos3 images of the host galaxy taken in 1998 june 28th ( pi : n.scoville , proposal - id : go 7237 ) and our nicmos2 data to detect the sn alone and performed psf fitted photometry .",
    "sn 2002hh has an extended shell structure as shown in fig.1 , we therefore performed aperture photometry based on background star subtracted images .",
    "we used 0.6@xmath17 radius regions to define the entire the sn .",
    "we subtracted background from an annulus centered on the sn with inner and outer radii of 0.6@xmath17 and 0.8@xmath17 .",
    "the aperture corrections were calculated with an empirical psf function .",
    "note that the magnitudes of sn2002hh listed in tables 1 , 2 , and 3 include the sn + extend light echo .    for each filter , the measured count rate ( cr , in units of dn s@xmath18 ) of the sn",
    "was converted to flux by multiplication with the photflam ( erg s@xmath18 cm@xmath8 @xmath18 dn@xmath18 or erg s@xmath18 cm@xmath8 @xmath18 electron@xmath18 ) conversion factor given in the fits header , where photflam is the bandpass - averaged flux density for a source that would produce a count rate ( cr in units of dn s@xmath18 or electron s@xmath18 ) .",
    "the @xmath2 system magnitude ( stmag ) was calculated from the following equation , @xmath20 where zp is the zero point magnitude for 1 dn s@xmath18 or 1 electron s@xmath18 . for the wfpc2 and archival acs data ( see below ) , the conversion from f450w , f606w and f622w , and f814w stmag to the vega magnitude system @xmath21 , @xmath15 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 , respectively , used the stsdas / synphot package .",
    "the broad band nicmos filters , f110w , f160w and f205w , are roughly equivalent to the @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 filters respectively , color transformations are not well constrained for late - time sn spectra at near - ir wavelengths .",
    "based on our experience , for sne in days 300 - 1000 , the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) in the range from @xmath50.44 to @xmath52.2 @xmath27 m can be represented by a single blackbody function with the effective temperature of @xmath57000 - 11000 k. the conversion from the stmag to the vega magnitude system was done by the stsdas / synphot package , assuming a 9000 k blackbody function as the incident sed .

    "we assume solar metallicity .",
    "there is no correlation between them .",
    "this can be explained by the different light echo geometry ( shape , size , and inclination angle , etc . ) .",
    "for example , modeling of the possible light echo geometries in sn 2004et currently suggests an hourglass - shaped nebula similar in size to that discovered around sn 1987a , but oriented such that we are looking down the symmetry axis ( sugerman et al . in prep . ) .",

    "<S> we present @xmath0 band photometry of 6 core - collapse supernovae , sne 1999bw , 2002hh , 2003gd , 2004et , 2005cs , and 2006bc measured at late epochs ( @xmath12 yrs ) based on hubble space telescope ( @xmath2 ) , gemini north , and wiyn telescopes . </S>",
    "<S> we also show the @xmath3 lightcurves of a supernova impostor sn 2008s up to day 575 because it was serendipitously in our sn 2002hh field of view . of our 43 @xmath2 observations in total , </S>",
    "<S> 36 observations are successful in detecting the light from the sne alone and measuring magnitudes of all the targets . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath2 observations show a resolved scattered light echo around sn 2003gd at day 1520 and around sn 2002hh at day 1717 . </S>",
    "<S> our gemini and wiyn observations detected sne 2002hh and 2004et , as well . combining our data with previously published data , </S>",
    "<S> we show @xmath4-band lightcurves and estimate decline magnitude rates at each band in 4 different phases . our prior work on these lightcurves and other data </S>",
    "<S> indicate that dust is forming in our targets from day @xmath5300 - 400 , supporting sn dust formation theory . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we focus on other physical properties derived from the late time light curves . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate @xmath6ni masses for our targets ( 0.5 - 14 @xmath710@xmath8 @xmath9 ) from the bolometric lightcurve of each for days @xmath5150 - 300 using sn 1987a as a standard ( 7.5@xmath710@xmath8 @xmath9 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the flattening or sometimes increasing fluxes in the late time light curves of sne 2002hh , 2003gd , 2004et and 2006bc indicate the presence of light echos . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate the circumstellar hydrogen density of the material causing the light echo and find that sn 2002hh is surrounded by relatively dense materials ( @xmath10(h ) @xmath1400 @xmath11 ) and sne 2003gd and 2004et have densities more typical of the interstellar medium ( @xmath51 @xmath11 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze the sample as a whole in the context of physical properties derived in prior work . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath6ni mass appears well correlated with progenitor mass with a slope of 0.31@xmath710@xmath8 , supporting the previous work by maeda et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2010 ) , who focus on more massive type ii sne . </S>",
    "<S> the dust mass does not appear to be correlated with progenitor mass . </S>"
