    "<S> it is demonstrated both theoretically and experimentally that the spin chirality associated with a noncoplanar spin configuration produces a magneto - optical effect . </S>",
    "<S> numerical study of the two - band hubbard model on a triangle cluster shows that the optical hall conductivity @xmath0 is proportional to the spin chirality . </S>",
    "<S> the detailed comparative experiments on pyrochlore - type molybdates @xmath1mo@xmath2o@xmath3 with @xmath4nd ( ising - like moments ) and @xmath4gd ( heisenberg - like ones ) clearly distinguishes the two mechanisms , i.e. , spin chirality and spin - orbit interactions . </S>",
    "<S> it is concluded that for @xmath5=nd , @xmath0 is dominated by the spin chirality for the dc ( @xmath6 ) and the @xmath7 incoherent intraband optical transitions between mo atoms .    </S>",
    "<S> quantum - mechanical phenomena associated with the berry phase  @xcite have attracted much interest in condensed - matter physics , including charge and spin hall transport properties . in particular </S>",
    "<S> , it has recently been recognized that the berry phase is relevant to the anomalous hall effect ( ahe ) where a finite dc hall conductivity @xmath8 appears in ferromagnets . </S>",
    "<S> it was first proposed that the ahe originates from a fictitious magnetic flux penetrating the conducting network  @xcite . however , the ahe is distinct from the ordinary hall effect that appears in the presence of the external uniform magnetic field , since the periodicity of the crystal is preserved in the case of the ahe </S>",
    "<S> . then it was found that the berry phase curvature of the bloch wavefunction in the momentum space is a more fundamental and universal concept  @xcite , which leads to a finite anomalous contribution to the hall conductivity . </S>",
    "<S> this berry phase curvature emerges through the relativistic spin - orbit interaction and/or the solid angle subtended by the spins under the noncoplanar structure , the latter of which is called _ spin chirality </S>",
    "<S> _  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the spin - chirality mechanism for the ahe has a fundamental significance , since the spin - orbit coupling acting on the propagating carriers was considered to be indispensable to produce the ahe in conventional theories  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recently , spin - chirality scenarios for the ahe have been extensively studied from both theoretical and experimental aspects  @xcite . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , it is also believed that the spin - orbit coupling is indispensable to have a finite optical hall conductivity @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> it remains as an open issue how such magneto - optical properties are influenced by the spin chirality in strongly correlated electron systems like transition - metal oxides , which is of our interest in the present paper .    in conventional magnets </S>",
    "<S> , it is difficult to distinguish between two mechanisms based on the spin - orbit interaction and the spin chirality , since the noncoplanar spin structure itself originates mostly from the spin - orbit interaction acting on the same electrons which are responsible for the magnetism . in this context </S>",
    "<S> , a pyrochlore molybdate system @xmath1mo@xmath2o@xmath3 ( @xmath4nd and gd ) offers an ideal laboratory to address this issue  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the both compounds have a unit cell composed of a tetrahedron for @xmath5 ions and that for mo which are shifted from each other by half the lattice constant . </S>",
    "<S> nd@xmath2mo@xmath2o@xmath3 henceforth referred to as the nmo is an itinerant ferromagnet with curie temperature @xmath9 k. by a small amount of hole doping , the marginally insulating gd@xmath2mo@xmath2o@xmath3 turns to be a ferromagnetic metal with @xmath10 k in the case of ( gd@xmath11ca@xmath12)@xmath2mo@xmath2o@xmath3 ( henceforth referred to as the gmo ) . </S>",
    "<S> the ferromangetism in these compounds is mostly attributed to the double exchange mechanism for mobile carriers of mo @xmath13 electrons . </S>",
    "<S> well below @xmath14 ( @xmath15 k for @xmath5=nd ) , through the exchange coupling @xmath16 with the mo spins , the localized @xmath17 moments on the rare - earth ions @xmath5=nd and gd start to produce a net magnetic moment in the anti - parallel and the parallel directions to the ferromagnetic moments of mo spins , respectively . here , it is important to notice that the nd moments are subject to a strong single - ion anisotropy and the four moments in the nd tetrahedron behave as ising spins pointing toward or outward the center of the tetrahedron as in spin - ice systems  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the gd moments behave as heisenberg spins since the orbital moment is quenced in the gd@xmath18 ion with the @xmath19 configuration  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the noncoplanar spin anisotropy and structure of the nd moments are transmitted to the mo spins through the exchange coupling @xmath16 , leading to the spin chirality of the mo electrons only in the case of the nmo .    </S>",
    "<S> this spin chirality manifests itself as a gauge flux which is experienced by the electrons upon their coherent and incoherent propagations , or the optical @xmath7 transition between the mo atoms , while the local charge transfer excitations on the mo@xmath20o bonds are least influenced by the spin chirality since the oxygen ion has no spin moment . in the dc limit </S>",
    "<S> , the spin chirality actually contributes to the ahe . in particular , in the case of the nmo , we can distinguish a _ spin chirality induced term _ in @xmath21 from the conventional one associated with the spin - orbit coupling of the itinerant electrons . </S>",
    "<S> this is because the spin chirality of the mo conduction electrons appears without the spin - orbit interaction acting on themselves . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , it is expected that the _ spin chirality _ gives an additional contribution to @xmath0 for the nmo , as far as the optical @xmath7 transitions between the mo atoms is concerned . </S>",
    "<S> namely , the dc and the optical hall conductivities of the nmo in the energy range from @xmath6 to the optical @xmath7 transitions contain the _ spin chirality induced contributions_. on the other hand , those of the gmo , which is a reference system reproducing well the magnetic and longitudinal - transport properties of the nmo except the chiral spin order arise solely from the conventional spin - orbit coupling acting on the mo @xmath13 electrons . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the comparison between nmo and gmo offers a touch - stone for the spin - chirality mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> on this basis , we study magneto - optics due to the spin chirality from both the theoretical and the experimental viewpoints .    </S>",
    "<S> the mo@xmath22 ion has two @xmath13 electrons in the @xmath23 orbital in the local coordinate associated with each moo@xmath24 octahedron . </S>",

    "<S> it is notable that a small spin canting affects the magneto - optical response at such incoherent regime . </S>",
    "<S> the on - site coulomb interactions only determine the characteristic excitation energy @xmath67 for the incoherent optical process and the longitudinal current response at this energy with the factor @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> the ratio of the anomalous hall velocity to the longitudinal one is exclusively determined by the tilting angle @xmath60 and insensitive to the coulomb interaction parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the triangular - cluster model of non - coplanar spins is the most basic system to investigate the effect of spin chirality on the optical hall conductivity . </S>",
    "<S> although these results allow at most semi - quantitative comparison with the experiments they generally prove the importance of the spin - chirality contribution to @xmath0 in the incoherent range of the spectrum ( for intraband transitions or excitaions through the gap ) independently of the fine details of the model system </S>",

    "<S> the low - energy side of the conductivity spectrum is well fitted by a drude term ( with a scattering rate of @xmath70mev ) when the contribution of the infrared active phonon modes is subtracted . </S>",
    "<S> the coherence peak is followed by the so - called incoherent band ( or intraband ) transitions in the mid - infrared region which is characteristic of correlated electron systems in the vicinity of a metal to insulator transition . </S>",
    "<S> separated from the mo @xmath13 optical processes , the higher energy conductivity peak ( centered around @xmath71ev ) is assigned as local charge - transfer excitations from oxygen sites to neighboring mo sites .    </S>",
    "<S> the dominance of the spin chirality mechanism over the spin - orbit interaction in the dc ahe of pyrochlore molybdates ( namely @xmath72 orders of magnitude difference ) has been previously pointed out in frame of a comparative investigation of nmo and gmo @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> now , on the basis of the present wide energy - range magneto - optical experiments we shall conclude that the same tendency remains valid for the finite - frequency transverse transport , @xmath0 , as far as the mo @xmath13 intraband - transition region is concerned .    </S>",

    "<S> @xmath75 was obtained by kramers - kronig transformation from the reflectivity , while due to the applied ellipsometric method , @xmath0 could be directly determined from the magneto - optical kerr parameters : @xmath76 where @xmath77 and @xmath78 are the kerr rotation and the kerr ellipticity , respectively , measured by a polarization modulation technique  @xcite . for both compounds , with nearly normal incidence , the polar kerr spectra of the @xmath79 crystallographic plane were measured in a magnetic field of @xmath80 t in the temperature range of @xmath81k . this magnetic field is large enough to orientate the ferromagnetic domains but still can be considered as the zero - field limit .    </S>",
    "<S> both compounds can be classified as bad metals since even at the lowest temperature the resistivity is close to or even larger than the ioffe - regel limit ( @xmath82m@xmath83 cm ) ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the whole @xmath84 spectra are also similar to each other in magnitude . by contrast </S>",
    "<S> , we have observed large signals @xmath85 and @xmath86 for nmo below @xmath87ev , while substantially smaller ones for gmo . in both cases , </S>",
    "<S> there appear a peak structure in @xmath77 and the corresponding inflection in @xmath78 centered around @xmath88ev , but these are due to the presence of the apparent plasma edge ( indicated by a dashed line ) . </S>",
    "<S> after evaluating @xmath0 according to eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 ) the apparent plasma resonance is naturally cancelled out by the energy dependence of @xmath89 , which ensures the correctness of the kramers - kronig transformation . nevertheless , a significant difference is quite clear in the magnitude of @xmath0 for the infrared incoherent band ( @xmath90ev ) between the two compounds .    on the high - energy side which is dominated by </S>",
    "<S> the o @xmath91 @xmath92 mo @xmath13 charge - transfer excitations , the magneto - optical response of the two systems are almost identical . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that in this energy region , @xmath0 solely originates from the spin - orbit interaction of the mo electrons and simply measure the spin polarization of the final state ( not the chirality ) , therefore invariant under the change of the rare - earth component . towards lower energies where the mo @xmath13 intraband transitions </S>",
    "<S> are dominant , however , @xmath0 shows a robust increase in the case of nmo while not for gmo . at the lowest energy of the experiment , @xmath93ev </S>",
    "<S> , this tendency results in nearly one order of magnitude difference between the magneto - optical responses of the two compounds , as expressed by @xmath94 and @xmath95 .    in fig .  4 </S>",
    "<S> , we present the detailed temperature dependence of @xmath0 for nmo . </S>",
    "<S> the spectral structure does not vary with increasing temperature , but only its magnitude is suppressed as @xmath14 is approached . </S>",
    "<S> figure  4 shows the temperature dependence of @xmath0 for the both compounds at three representative energies : ( i ) in the dc limit , ( ii ) in the region of the incoherent intraband transitions ( @xmath93ev ) and ( iii ) for the charge - transfer peak ( @xmath96ev ) . </S>",
    "<S> the total magnetization and the mo - spin contribution  @xcite are also plotted in the same figure . </S>",
    "<S> below @xmath97k , the nd moments tend to align antiparallel to the almost ferromagnetically ordered mo spins which results in the low - temperature reduction of the magnetization . by contrast , the interaction between mo and gd sites is ferromagnetic , and hence the magnetization is enhanced in gmo . </S>",
    "<S> as far as the mo @xmath13 intraband ( incoherent band ) transitions at @xmath98ev are concerned , @xmath0 of nmo is substantially larger than that of gmo over the whole ferromagnetic phase of the compounds , independently of temperature . </S>",
    "<S> this key finding evidences that the leading term in the magneto - optical response of the incoherently moving electrons comes from the spin - chirality mechanism .    </S>",
    "<S> generally speaking , the role of the spin chirality becomes more important as the dc limit is approached , since the low - energy transitions can more coherently pick up the gauge flux ( or integrate the berry curvature ) . </S>",
    "<S> when the fermi level is located within a tiny energy gap generated by the gauge flux at the band crossing point , @xmath99@xmath100@xmath101 is maximized due to the presence of the magnetic - monopole analog at the crossing point @xcite . in the low - temperature phase of nmo , this characteristic energy scale is estimated to be @xmath102ev @xcite . the temperature dependence of @xmath0 should show a complicated behavior for @xmath103 as a finger print of this gauge flux structure in momentum space . for @xmath104 , on the other hand , the perturbative treatment of the magnetization @xmath105 times the spin chirality @xmath106 is appropriate , and hence we predict @xmath107 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , considering @xmath108ev , it is reasonable that the temperature dependence of @xmath0 in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> 4 and 5 scales with the mo magnetization except the dc value .    </S>",
    "<S> a nonmonotonous spectral shape of @xmath0 is expected for @xmath109ev , since it is known that complicated band crossings realized in the electronic structure gives a rapid oscillation of @xmath0 as mentioned above . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , it is discerned in the low - energy @xmath0 spectra of nmo . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , @xmath110 obviously changes sign at @xmath111 . from the kramers - kronig relation , this has to be accompanied by a maximum in @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , one can show that the compatibility of the dc values ( @xmath112 and @xmath113 ) with the low - energy @xmath0 data presented in fig .  4 , @xmath56 requires two more sign changes in the experimentally inaccessible low - energy region as the dc limit is approached . </S>",
    "<S> such a behavior is consistent with the above scenario of the rapid oscillation of @xmath56 at low energies due to the band crossing .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> we have demonstrated , theoretically and experimentally , the magneto - optical effect induced by the spin chirality . </S>",
    "<S> the theory on the two - band hubbard model for a triangle cluster shows that the optical hall conductivity across the mott - hubbard gap emerges in the presence of the spin chirality . </S>",
    "<S> the magneto - optical experiments have shown that the amplitude of the optical hall conductivity in the energy range of @xmath7 intraband transitions between the mo atoms is large under a noncoplanar spin structure in nd@xmath2mo@xmath2o@xmath3 with spin chirality , while it is significantly suppressed in gd@xmath2mo@xmath2o@xmath3 without spin chirality .    </S>",
