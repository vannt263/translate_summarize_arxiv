    "problems which deal with finsler - laplacian type operators have been studied in several contexts ( see , for example , @xcite ) .    when @xmath2 is the euclidean norm , namely @xmath18 , blow - up problems for equations depending on the gradient have been studied by many authors .",
    "we refer the reader , for example , to @xcite . in the euclidean",
    "setting , problem - reduces to @xmath19 the interest in problems modeled by has been grown since the seminal paper by lasry and lions @xcite .",
    "the equation in is a particular case of hamilton - jacobi - bellman equations , which are related to stochastic differential problems .",
    "indeed , in @xcite the authors enlightened the relation between problem and a model of stochastic control problem involving constraints on the state of the system by means of unbounded drifts .",
    "we briefly recall a few facts about this link .",
    "let us consider the stochastic differential equation @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a standard brownian motion .",
    "we assume that @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the class of feedback controls such that the state process @xmath24 , solution to the above sde , remains in @xmath4 with probability @xmath25 , for all @xmath26 and for any @xmath27 .",

    "there are several results regarding the existence , uniqueness and asymptotic behavior of the solutions of .",
    "when @xmath35 tends to zero , the limit of @xmath36 is known as ergodic limit .",
    "this kind of problems have been largely studied ( see , for example , @xcite ) . a typical result states that @xmath36 tends to a value @xmath37 and @xmath38 , for fixed @xmath39",
    ", tends to a function @xmath40 which solves @xmath41 problem is seen as the ergodic limit , as @xmath42 , of the stochastic control problem just destribed .",
    "the scope of the present paper is to obtain existence , uniqueness and asymptotic behavior of the solutions to problem - , in the spirit of the work by lasry and lions @xcite , when @xmath2 is a general norm of @xmath43 .",
    "the interest in this kind of problems is twofold .",
    "first , in analogy with the relation between the quoted sde and the elliptic problem , we stress that the finsler laplacian @xmath5 can be interpreted as the generator of a `` h - finslerian diffusion '' , which generalizes the standard brownian motion in @xmath3 .",
    "stochastic processes of this type arise in some biology problems , as in the theory of evolution by endo - symbiosis in which modern cells of plants and animals arise from separately living bacterial species .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite ( and to the bibliography cited therein ) for the stochastic interpretation of @xmath5 and for the quoted applications .",
    "second , apart from the stochastic motivation , the nonlinear elliptic problem we study is of interest in its own right . in our case ,",
    "the operator in is , in general , anisotropic and quasilinear , with a strong nonlinearity in the gradient , and generalizes to this setting some extensively studied problems in the isotropic case .",
    "actually , this brings several difficulties and differencies with respect to the euclidean case .",
    "moreover , in @xcite the asymptotic behavior of the solutions of near to the boundary of @xmath4 is strongly related to a precise behavior of @xmath8 with respect to the distance to @xmath44 . in our case , the anisotropy of the operator leads to use an appropriate distance function to the boundary related to @xmath2 . on the other hand , unless @xmath45 , the function @xmath46 is always discontinuous in @xmath47 .",
    "hence , also giving smoothess assumptions on @xmath2 and on the data , it is not possible to apply classical caldern - zygmund type regularity results to get strong solutions in @xmath48 , @xmath29 .",
    "we deal , in fact , only with solutions in @xmath49 .",
    "furthermore , this lack of regularity does not permit to obtain , in general , the same gradient estimates for the solutions of - proved in the euclidean case , which play a central role in the study of the ergodic problem . actually , we are able to treat also the case @xmath10 , obtaining existence results for the limit problem @xmath50 and some properties of the ergodic constant @xmath51 .",
    "we refer the reader to section [ 2.3 ] for the complete scheme of the obtained results .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .    in section",
    "[ 2 ] we give the precise assumptions on @xmath2 and recall some basic facts of convex analysis .",
    "moreover , we state our results . in section [ 3 ] we prove some a priori estimates for the gradient . finally , in section [ 4 ] we give the proof of the main results .",
    "throughout the paper we will consider a function @xmath52 convex , @xmath25-homogeneous , that is @xmath53 and such that @xmath54 for some constant @xmath55 . under this hypothesis",
    "it is easy to see that there exists @xmath56 such that @xmath57 moreover , we will assume that @xmath58 in all the paper we will denote with @xmath4 a set of @xmath3 , @xmath12 such that @xmath59    the hypothesis on @xmath2 assure that the operator @xmath5 is elliptic , hence there exists a positive constant @xmath60 such that @xmath61 for any @xmath62 and for any @xmath63 .",
    "we will consider as solutions of equation the strong solutions , namely functions @xmath64 such that the equality in @xmath65 holds almost everywhere in @xmath4 .    in this context , an important role",
    "is played by the polar function of @xmath2 , namely the function @xmath66 defined as @xmath67 it is not difficult to verify that @xmath66 is a convex , @xmath25-homogeneous function that satisfies ( with different constants ) .",
    "moreover , @xmath68 the assumption on @xmath69 implies that @xmath70 is strongly convex , in the sense that it is a @xmath11 set and all the principal curvatures are strictly positive functions on @xmath71 .",
    "this ensures that @xmath72 ( see @xcite for the details ) .",
    "the following well - known properties hold true : @xmath73 analogous properties hold interchanging the roles of @xmath2 and @xmath66 .",
    "the open set @xmath74 is the so - called wulff shape centered at the origin .",
    "more generally , we denote @xmath75 and @xmath76 .      due to the nature of the problem , it seems to be natural to consider a suitable notion of distance to the boundary .",
    "the anisotropic distance of @xmath77 to the boundary of @xmath44 is the function @xmath78 it is not difficult to prove that @xmath79 .",
