    "recently there has been growing interest in characterizing the formation probabilities in quantum spin chains near quantum critical points .",
    "the formation probability is defined as the probability of occurrence of a particular configuration for a given observable in a subsystem .",
    "for example , in the case of spin chains one can think about probability of having a particular configuration for a string of spins .",
    "a especial case of the formation probabilities is called emptiness formation probability . in the spin chains it is defined as the probability of having a configuration with all the spins up in the subsystem .",
    "emptiness formation probability of the discrete systems has been studied extensively in the literature , see for example @xcite , for the evolution of the emptiness formation probability after a quantum quench see @xcite .",
    "the main result is that the emptiness formation probability of a simple subsystem of a critical model usually symmetry .",
    "] decreases exponentially with the size of the subsystem .",
    "the exponential decay is accompanied by a power - law decay with a universal exponent .",
    "the nature of this exponent , which is dependent on the central charge of the underlying conformal field theory , is understood in @xcite by using boundary conformal field theory ( bcft ) techniques .",
    "the main idea is that fixing observables in part of the system is like introducing a slit like boundary in the euclidean version of the quantum spin chain . if the boundary condition induced by the configuration respects the conformal symmetry one can calculate the formation probability using the bcft techniques .",
    "the analyzes later generalized to two - disjoint intervals in @xcite and it was pointed out that by calculating this quantity one can not only derive the central charge of the system but also the whole critical exponents present in the system .",
    "it is worth mentioning that in @xcite it was shown numerically that the bcft results are not only valid for emptiness formation probabilities but also for much more general formation probabilities .",
    "formation probabilities have also been used to calculate interesting quantities , such as shannon information and mutual shannon information @xcite .    in apparently unrelated studies the casimir effect of two floating objects in a two dimensional classical medium has been the subject of intense studies for decades , see for example @xcite and references therein .",
    "the calculation of the casimir energy of two floating objects in a medium boils down to calculating the change in the free energy of the medium when there is a especial boundary condition in the domain that we positioned the objects .",
    "although normally calculating the casimir energy is a difficult task for generic systems it was shown in @xcite that if the system is at the critical point and the boundary conditions are conformal invariant one can exactly calculate the casimir energy of two arbitrary objects using bcft techniques .",
    "it is not difficult to see that there is an obvious connection between the emptiness formation probabilities in the quantum spin chains and the casimir effect of two slits ( needles ) .",
    "this connection first highlighted in @xcite in the case of infinite chains .",
    "of course , this connection is not only present in @xmath0d systems but it can be generalized for arbitrary dimensions .",
    "this simple relation can have numerous mutual benefits for these two apparently unrelated areas of research .",
    "in @xcite we have used the formulas presented in the casimir effect studies to calculate the formation probability of two disjoint intervals in an infinite system . for general formulas regarding casimir energy of two needles",
    "see @xcite . in this work",
    "we extend the results to finite systems .",
    "we study two different cases : 1 ) formation probability of one interval inside an open finite system and 2 ) formation probability of two disjoint intervals in a finite periodic system .",
    "the calculations also provide a formula for the casimir free energy of a needle inside a strip and the casimir energy of two aligned needles in a cylinder .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the next section we give a brief review of the connection between formation probabilities and the casimir effect .",
    "we also provide all the necessary definitions and formulas . in the third section",
    "we find a conformal map from strip with a slit to an annulus and then we use it to give a formula for the formation probability of a domain inside a finite chain . in the fourth section",
    "we study the formation probability of two disjoint intervals in a finite periodic system . in the fifth section we numerically check the validity of the presented cft formulas for the critical transverse field ising chain .",
    "finally in the last section we summarize our findings and comment about future directions .",
    "in this section we summarize the main result of the paper @xcite which highlights a relation between the casimir effect and the formation probabilities in the quantum chains .",
    "the work was based on the earlier studies on the emptiness formation probability of one interval @xcite and the casimir effect of arbitrary two dimensional objects @xcite .",
    "although the relation can be explained most easily in the context of the quantum spin chains the conclusions are valid for any quantum system in any dimension . consider a quantum system with the hamiltonian @xmath1 .",
    "the transfer matrix of the system is @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the imaginary time step . in the limit of infinite steps",
    "@xmath4 we have @xmath5 .",
    "now imagine we are interested in the probability of having an arbitrary configuration @xmath6 in part of the system .",
    "from now on , we call this quantity the formation probability .",
    "note that the chosen spins do not need to be neighbours .",
    "for example , we can think about two disjoint intervals or two disconnected regions with fixed spins .",
    "one can calculate the formation probability by the following formula : @xmath7 where @xmath8 fixes the spins in the basis @xmath9 in some arbitrary directions and @xmath10 is the state at infinity and can be in principle any state not orthogonal to the ground state .",
    "the denominator of the equation ( [ formation probabilities definition ] ) is the total partition function of the corresponding @xmath11 dimensional classical system .",
    "the infinite system can be subject to periodic ( open ) boundary conditions , in that case one needs to work on the infinite cylinder ( strip ) in two dimensions . in higher dimensions one needs to think about a generalized cylinder or a generalized strip .",
    "the numerator is the partition function of the system with this constraint that the spins in the corresponding sub - domain @xmath12 have particular values . using the above argument",
    "now we can write @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the partition function of the whole system minus a slit and @xmath15 is the total partition function .",
    "note that the numerator is dependent on the basis that one chooses simply because working on different bases induces different boundary conditions on the slit . instead of working directly with the formation probabilities , which usually decays exponentially with respect to the volume",
    ", it is much better to work with its logarithm .",
    "we call @xmath16 logarithmic formation probability",
    ". it usually follows a volume law with some universal subleading terms that we are interested to calculate them .",
    "when the system is at the critical point these subleading terms can be calculated using the boundary cft techniques . from now on , we write @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the volume of the domain @xmath12 and @xmath19 is the universal part of the formation probability and @xmath20 is a constant .",
    "it is not difficult to see that the @xmath21 can be also interpreted as the universal part of the casimir energy of the system .",
    "for example , consider an open chain with a string of fixed observables inside of it . in this case",
    "the classical counterpart of the setup is a strip with a needle inside .",
    "if we change the slit position just the @xmath19 part of the logarithmic formation probability will change .",
    "in other words , the change in the casimir free energy of the needle comes from this part .",
    "that is the reason that ultimately the casimir force is just dependent on this term . to see the connection more",
    "explicitly it is much better to define the following quantity @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the boundary conditions on the slit and the natural boundary . @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the partition functions of the strip with slit and slit in an infinite system respectively .",
    "the right hand side of the equation ( [ r open ] ) is the energy required to bring the boundary from infinity to a finite distance from the needle .",
    "the same argument goes more or less smoothly also for a periodic system with two slits inside of it . in this case",
    "we define @xcite @xmath27 where again @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the boundary conditions on the slits and @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath28 are the partition functions of the cylinder with two slits , slit @xmath23 and slit @xmath24 respectively .",
    "the right hand side of the above equation is the casimir free energy of two needles . in both of the above examples we have two boundaries and in principle topologically they are equivalent to a finite cylinder . since we know the partition function of the cft on the cylinder one can hire the techniques known in the boundary cft to calculate @xmath19",
    "this procedure has been carried out for generic cft s in two dimensions in @xcite .",
    "the final result is @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the free energy of the cft on the annulus which is known for most of the cft s @xcite and the @xmath31 can be calculated using @xcite @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a contour surrounding one of the slits , @xmath34 is the conformal map which maps the original system with two boundaries to an annulus and @xmath35 is the schwarzian derivative . in the above equation",
    "the derivative is with respect to the distance between the slits in the case of two slits in a periodic system which finally gives us the casimir energy between the two slits .",
    "however , logarithmic formation probability has also another universal term which is a property of every slit without considering the other one .",
    "this part of the logarithmic formation probability can be also calculated by using the above formulas , just we need to consider the derivative appearing in the equation ( [ integral ] ) with respect to the length of the slit as it is done also in @xcite . for the open chain with a slit we will consider this case .    the annulus contribution part for a generic cft with the boundary conditions @xmath23 and @xmath24 on the two boundaries has the following form @xcite    @xmath36-c\\frac{h}{12},\\\\ \\label{annulus part4 } \\ln z^{annu}(\\tilde{q})&=&\\ln [ \\tilde{q}^{-c/24}(b^{a}_{0}b^b_{0}+\\sum_jb^{a}_{j}b^b_{j}\\tilde{q}^{\\delta_j})]-c\\frac{h}{12},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath37 s are some non - negative integers and @xmath38 and @xmath39 with @xmath40 and @xmath41 are cardy and ishibashi states respectively .",
    "different coefficients are related to each other with the formula @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the element of the modular matrix @xmath44 , see @xcite .",
    "finally @xmath45 and @xmath46 are defined as @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the inner radius of the annulus and the outer radius is @xmath49 .",
    "as it is clear , for large @xmath50 the expansion with respect to @xmath46 , i.e. ( [ annulus part4 ] ) is useful and when @xmath50 is small the expansion with respect to @xmath45 , i.e. ( [ annulus part3 ] ) .",
    "an equivalent way of writing the equations ( [ annulus part3 ] ) and ( [ annulus part4 ] ) is @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the character of the conformal operator with the conformal weight @xmath53 .",
    "in this section we study the logarithmic formation probability of a string with the length @xmath54 inside a finite chain with the total length @xmath55 . in two dimensions",
    "the strip with the slit can be mapped to an annulus and later to a cylinder . in principle",
    "the boundary conditions on the slit and on the natural boundaries of the open system can be different which means that the two boundaries of the cylinder can have different conditions .",
    "this subtlety can be easily considered in the framework of our previous section .",
    "the setup that we would like to study is shown in the figure  1 . to derive the logarithmic formation probability one needs to calculate the partition function of the surface shown in the the figure  1 .",
    "[ htb ] [ fig1 ]   in four steps . ,",
    "title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=120.0% ]    the corresponding conformal map from strip with one slit to a cylinder can be derived as follows :    step i : we first map the strip to a unit disc by the conformal map @xmath56 the coordinates of @xmath57 and @xmath58 are now @xmath59 and @xmath60 respectively with @xmath61}{1+\\sin[\\frac{\\pi l}{l}]},\\\\ b=\\frac{\\cos[\\frac{\\pi ( l+s)}{l}]}{1+\\sin[\\frac{\\pi ( l+s)}{l}]}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    step ii : the unit disc with the unsymmetrical slit can be mapped to a unit disc with a symmetrical slit by the conformal map @xmath62 the length of the slit is now @xmath63 with @xmath64    step iii : the remaining disc with a slit can now be mapped to an annulus by using the conformal map @xmath65 provided in @xcite as @xmath66 where @xmath67 and @xmath68 are the elliptic and inverse jacobi functions respectively and @xmath69 note that the equation ( [ conformal map obc ] ) is valid just for @xmath70 , for the lower half @xmath71 we need to use @xmath72    step iv : the final step is mapping the annulus to a cylinder by @xmath73 . since we already wrote the partition function of the annulus explicitly this step is in principle redundant .",
    "however , it is worth mentioning that the term @xmath74 in the partition function of the annulus is the result of this step .    to calculate the schwarzian derivative we need the following chain rule @xmath75 the calculations",
    "can be done using mathematica .",
    "finally we have @xmath76 for symmetric slit with @xmath77 we have @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "then the above formula has much simpler form @xmath80 the above equations combined with the @xmath81 provide us all the necessary formulas for the formation probability of a slit inside a finite chain . since the final integral over @xmath82",
    "can not be calculated analytically one can rely on numerical calculations .",
    "it is illuminating to study the above formulas in the limit of @xmath83 .",
    "in this limit we have @xmath84 in particular , in this limit @xmath46 is the small parameter with the following asymptotic limit @xmath85 then after a bit of calculations we have @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the smallest scaling dimension present in the spectrum of the system and @xmath88 is the ultra violet cutoff .",
    "putting all the terms together we finally have @xmath89 the first term which is dependent just to the central charge of the system is already derived in @xcite .",
    "the constant terms are the affleck - ludwig boundary entropies and the last term is the finite size correction to the formation probability .",
    "note that there are also some further corrections coming from the geometric part of the partition function , see @xcite , however , they are not dependent on the spectrum of the system . to determine the boundary entropy term one should first remove a piece of non - universal constant term .",
    "this can be done by considering a periodic or infinite system , then we have @xmath90 where again @xmath91 is the boundary contribution of the slit .",
    "the boundary contribution of the natural boundary can be derived by subtracting the two equations ( [ formation probabilities obc large system ] ) and ( [ formation probabilities pbc large system ] ) .",
    "in this section we study the logarithmic formation probability in the finite periodic system .",
    "the most general case that we are interested in is the one with two disjoint intervals .",
    "when we have one interval the formation probability has been already calculated in @xcite : @xmath92 in the presence of two intervals we have @xmath93    [ htb ] [ fig2 ]   and @xmath94 for a system with the total size @xmath55 .",

    "it is also the part which is the same as the corresponding casimir energy .",
    "we would like to calculate @xmath96 in the presence of two slits @xcite positioned at distance @xmath54 from each other .",
    "in other words we are interested to study the casimir energy of two needles in a periodic system . the conformal map of a cylinder with two slits to an annulus has been already presented in @xcite and we wrote it explicitly in the appendix .",
    "the schwarzian derivative and the integral over the poles at @xmath97 and @xmath98 can be calculated using the mathematica .",
    "the final result has the following form :    @xmath99    with    @xmath100    and @xmath101 having the above formulas now we apply them to three interesting regimes : two small slits far from each other , one big and one small slits far from each other and two big slits close to each other .",
    "when two small slits are far from each other the geometric part of the free energy decays like @xmath103 with respect to the distance @xmath54 , see @xcite .",
    "because of the fast decay of this term usually we can ignore it in favor of more dominant terms coming from the annulus part .",
    "this is true also when one of the slits is big but the other one is small .",
