    "<S> the integral @xmath1 is estimated from @xmath2 to @xmath3 gev@xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the result shows that there is a region where both contributions from the baryon resonances and the deep inelastic scattering are important , thus provides important information on the high twist effects on the spin dependent sum rule .    </S>",

    "<S> the parton model tells us that the spin dependent structure functions @xmath5 should have simple scaling behaviors in the large @xmath12 limit ; @xmath13 and the corresponding spin dependent sum rules@xcite @xmath14 provide us an important information on the spin - flavor correlations of the nucleon . </S>",
    "<S> however , the average @xmath12 of the polarized lepton - nucleon scattering experiments may not be high enough to reach the scaling limit , and the @xmath12 dependence of the spin structure function becomes significant . </S>",
    "<S> recent studies@xcite have shown that the @xmath12 dependence of the spin structure function should be taken into account in order to explain smc@xcite and slac@xcite measurements on the spin structure function of the nucleon along with the emc@xcite data . </S>",
    "<S> theoretically , such @xmath12 dependence that comes from the high twist effects have been the subject of many studies@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the information on the spin structure function in the low @xmath12 region would be more interesting since the high twist effects become stronger , this is where the spin structure function in the resonance region plays an important role . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , it has been shown@xcite that @xmath12 dependence of the spin structure function arises naturally due to the transition from a negative drell - hearn - gerasimov ( dhg ) sum rule@xcite to the positive spin - dependent sum rule in the large @xmath12 limit . </S>",
    "<S> the investigations in the explicit quark model show@xcite that the dhg sum rule is dominated by the spin structure function in the resonance region , in particular , by the process @xmath15 , which has been confirmed by the data@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> how this transition happens in the small @xmath12 region also provides an important test ground for theories , since the explicit quark model@xcite and chiral perturbation theory@xcite have given different predictions .    </S>",
    "<S> the focus of this paper is to examine the @xmath12 dependence of the spin structure function in the resonance region . </S>",
    "<S> our investigation is based on the earlier studies of the @xmath12 extensions of the dhg sum rule@xcite , and we further replace the photon energy @xmath16 by variable @xmath17 which is analogue to the bjorken scaling variable in the deep inelastic scattering . we shall show that the resonance region alone is not sufficient to provide an accurate estimate of the dhg sum rule due to the kinematic restriction . the evolution of the spin asymmetry @xmath0 , which is defined as @xmath18 will also be studied in this framework . </S>",
    "<S> a negative dhg sum rule at the real photon limit requires that the spin asymmetry function @xmath19 be negative at the real photon limit . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to a transition from a negative @xmath0 at the real photon limit to the positive @xmath0 at large @xmath12 , the data@xcite tell us that such a transition should happen at a relative small @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> if this is indeed to be the case , the @xmath0 in the resonance region will show how the transition occur . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , because the dhg sum rule is dominated by the exclusive process @xmath15 , one should expect a dramatic @xmath12 dependence in the small @xmath12 region . </S>",
    "<S> thus , there might be a region that both contributions from the resonance region and deep inelastic scattering are important , where the @xmath12 dependence of the structure function is dominated by the leading high twist effects . </S>",
    "<S> our investigation shows that this is possible for @xmath20 gev@xmath4 . in the next section </S>",
    "<S> , we will establish the connection between the dhg sum rule and the integral of the spin structure function . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath12 evolution of the asymmetry @xmath0 will also be shown .    </S>",
    "<S> eqs . </S>",
    "<S> [ 21 ] and [ 22 ] show that the dhg sum rule integral @xmath21 used in refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite is not related to the spin dependent sum rule @xmath22 at large @xmath12 since the photon flux @xmath23 in eqs . [ 21 ] and [ 22 ] is defined as the equivalent photon energy . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , one should estimate the integral @xmath24 , which is related the dhg sum rule in the real photon limit and the spin dependent sum rules in the deep inelastic scattering region . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , one has to go beyond the resonance region to give an accurate estimate of the integral @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> this will be given in section 3 . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the conclusion will be given in section 4 .      in order to describe </S>",
    "<S> the strong @xmath12 dependence around @xmath2 of the spin structure function due to the pion photo and electroproduction that dominate the dhg sum rule , it is more appropriate to define the variable @xmath17 as @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the threshold energy for the pion - electroproduction , which is related to the pion mass @xmath28 and the nucleon mass @xmath10 by @xmath29 the variable @xmath17 defined in eq . [ 1 ] is exactly the same as variable @xmath30 in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , which gives a better description of the strong @xmath12 dependence of the structure function @xmath31 near threshold . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the variable @xmath17 naturally leads to the bjorken scaling variable @xmath32 in the large @xmath12 limit , and makes it possible to write the dhg integral @xmath33 in terms of the integral @xmath22 at the real photon limit ; @xmath34 where the photon flux @xmath23 in eq . </S>",
    "<S> [ 21 ] is the photon energy @xmath16 at the real photon limit . </S>",
    "<S> the dhg sum rule gives @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the anomalous magnetic moments of the nucleon . </S>",
    "<S> substitute @xmath37 and @xmath38 for both protons and neutrons into eq . </S>",
    "<S> [ 6 ] , we have @xmath39    replacing the photon energy @xmath16 by the variable @xmath17 at low @xmath12 also shows kinematic restrictions of the resonance region ; rewriting the photon energy as @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the mass of final state when nucleon @xmath10 at rest absorbs the incoming photon with energy @xmath16 , the resonance region corresponds to the final state mass @xmath41 from the threshold @xmath42 to @xmath43 gev which is also the region that can be reached in the future cebaf experiments@xcite . in fig . 1 </S>",
    "<S> , we show the range of the variable @xmath17 that is accessible to the resonance region ; at @xmath2 , the resonance region covers @xmath44 , while @xmath17 is only limited to @xmath45 at @xmath46 gev@xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> this raises a serious question whether the resonance region , or the information from the cebaf experiments , alone would be sufficient to provide an accurate estimate of the spin dependent integral @xmath47 even at moderate @xmath12 .    </S>",
    "<S> however , the studies of the spin structure function in the resonance region could provide us very useful information on transition of the spin structure function from the real photon limit to the scaling limit in the deep inelastic scattering . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the data on the spin asymmetry function @xmath0 in the resonance region will reveal how it reaches the scaling limit , if @xmath0 has little dependence on @xmath12 after @xmath48 gev@xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> a significant amount of the pion and @xmath49 electroproduction data has been collected in the resonance region@xcite , this enable us to extract the transverse photo coupling amplitudes @xmath50 and @xmath51 for the most prominent resonances in the range @xmath52 gev@xmath4 . for the other relative weak resonances , we used the single quark transition model to calculate their photo coupling constants . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , combining the contribution from the resonances and the background pion production , one can obtain the spin structure function in the resonance region , ( for further detail , see @xcite ) . in the figure 2 </S>",
    "<S> , we show that asymmetry @xmath0 of proton in the resonance region at @xmath2 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 gev@xmath4 , and the data at @xmath55 and @xmath54 gev@xmath4@xcite are also shown . </S>",
    "<S> the asymmetry is mostly negative in the region @xmath56 in the real photon limit , since it is dominated by the process @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the cancellation between the transitions of spin flip and orbital angular momentum flip for the resonance @xmath58 and @xmath59@xcite also makes helicity amplitudes @xmath60 vanishes for these resonances , which leads to a negative @xmath19 for the higher resonances . as @xmath12 increases , </S>",
    "<S> the resonance @xmath61 is shifting to larger x , and the magnetic spin flip transition becomes dominant , thus the asymmetry @xmath0 becomes positive in the small x region , and changes the sign and approaches to unity as @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> this tells us that the asymmetry @xmath0 approaches to the scaling limit in the small @xmath17 region first , and the range of variable @xmath17 that asymmetry @xmath0 scales increases as @xmath12 increases . at the scaling limit </S>",
    "<S> , the valence quark model@xcite predicts @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the ratio between the structure functions of neutrons and protons , which give a very good description of the emc data@xcite in the large @xmath17 region . comparing with the asymmetry @xmath65 in the scaling limit , which is also shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 , we find that the @xmath0 in the resonance region does not reach the scaling limit at @xmath55 gev@xmath4 , and it is much closer to the scaling limit at @xmath66 gev@xmath4 for @xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> the future experiments at cebaf@xcite would certainly provide the answer in this regard .      </S>",
    "<S> there are several problems in estimate the @xmath12 dependence of the integral @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> first ; there is little experimental information available on the longitudinal photon coupling @xmath69 in the resonance region , we can only estimate the integral @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the ratio between the longitudinal and transverse cross sections , and @xmath23 is defined as the equivalent photon energy . </S>",
    "<S> this integral equals @xmath72 at the real photon limit and the large @xmath12 limit . </S>",
    "<S> soffer and teryaev@xcite pointed out that the strong @xmath12 dependence of the spin structure function @xmath73 in the small @xmath12 region might be due to the contamination of the function @xmath74 , this means that the quantity @xmath11 in eq . [ 21 ] might play an important role in the small @xmath12 region . </S>",
    "<S> this might be related to the threshold effect around @xmath2 , thus one expected it vanish very quickly as @xmath12 increases . </S>",
    "<S> the quantitative calculation of @xmath11 can be done in the framework of valence quark model , and this is in progress . </S>",
    "<S> second , the kinematic restriction shows that the spin structure function in the resonance region alone might not be sufficient to estimate the integral @xmath75 , fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 shows the quantity @xmath76 as a function of @xmath77 at @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the dhg sum rule should be extracted at @xmath78 , and if the function @xmath79 reaches constant in the small @xmath77 region , it means that the integral @xmath80 can be neglected , thus an accurate dhg sum rule can be obtained experimentally . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 shows that @xmath77 is not small enough to warrant such extraction , and @xmath79 has not become constant in the small @xmath77 region . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , there is a theoretical uncertainty in the estimate of the dhg sum rule due to the kinematic restrictions of the resonance region , which has not been discussed in the literature@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the dhg could be obtained by averaging two extreme cases ; extrapolating @xmath81 from the function @xmath79 at small @xmath77 region assuming a smooth behavior of the function @xmath79 near @xmath78 , or neglecting the contribution from the outside of the resonance region , and the difference between these two cases represents the theoretical uncertainty . following this procedure , </S>",
    "<S> we find @xmath82 this result is in good agreement with the theoretical prediction for protons in eq . </S>",
    "<S> [ 7 ] , and the theoretical uncertainty is quite significant .    </S>",
    "<S> therefore , one can generally write the integral for the spin dependent structure function @xmath75 as @xmath83 where @xmath84 represents the contribution from the resonance region between @xmath85 and 1 , and @xmath86 comes from the outside resonance region . the quantity @xmath87 in eq . </S>",
    "<S> [ 8 ] is @xmath88 with @xmath89 gev . </S>",
    "<S> thus , @xmath87 approaches to unity as @xmath12 increases , and consequently the contribution from the resonance region decreases . </S>",
    "<S> our result shows that the asymmetry @xmath0 outside the resonance region may not reach the scaling limit for @xmath90 until @xmath91 gev@xmath4 , where the asymmetry data in deep inelastic scattering@xcite could be used . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 shows our estimate the @xmath12 dependence of the integral @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> the qualitative behavior of @xmath84 is consistent with the results in refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , there is a strong @xmath12 dependence of @xmath84 in the region @xmath92 gev@xmath4 due to the transition @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath84 becomes positive at @xmath93 gev@xmath4 and reaches maximum at @xmath94 gev@xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> however , @xmath84 is not the whole story , one has to add @xmath86 to give an accurate estimate of @xmath25 . since the asymmetry @xmath0 in the resonance region shows a strong @xmath12 dependence in @xmath95 gev@xmath4 , we only add @xmath86 after @xmath96 gev@xmath4 , in which @xmath65 is taken from the emc data@xcite , the structure function @xmath31 is obtained from the parametrization of the experimental data by donnachie and landshoff@xcite , and quantity @xmath97 comes from the global fit of the experimental data by whitlow _ </S>",
    "<S> et al_@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the result shows that @xmath86 gives an dominant contribution , while @xmath84 only accounts for 15 to 20 percent of @xmath25 in the region @xmath98 gev@xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> this is where we believe that one could obtain a reliable information of the high twist effects . </S>",
    "<S> if we write the @xmath12 dependence of @xmath25 above @xmath99 gev@xmath4 as @xmath100 our result in @xmath101 gev@xmath4 region gives @xmath102 and @xmath103 in particular , the parameter @xmath104 is consistent with recent analysis of the smc and emc data by close and roberts@xcite in which they conclude @xmath105 as well as the qcd sum rule prediction by balitsky _ </S>",
    "<S> et al_@xcite used in the analysis by ellis and karliner@xcite .      </S>",
    "<S> we have presented a framework to study the @xmath12 dependence of the spin structure function in the resonance region . </S>",
    "<S> at the real photon and large @xmath12 limit , the spin dependent sum rule @xmath75 defined in eq . </S>",
    "<S> [ 25 ] is related the dhg sum rule and the sum rules in the deep inelastic scattering by @xmath106 which also equals to the integral @xmath22 in these limits . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the data from the resonance region alone is not enough to determine the integral of the spin structure function , even the dhg sum rule in the real photon limit . </S>",
    "<S> however , the spin structure function in the resonance region does provides important insights into the transition of the spin structure function as the @xmath12 increases . </S>",
    "<S> the dhg sum rule is a threshold effect . </S>",
    "<S> it decreases very quickly as @xmath12 increases due to its strong connection with the process @xmath15 , which is proportional to @xmath107 at large @xmath12@xcite , thus it is not the hight twist effect that generates the leading @xmath108 corrections to the spin structure functions in the deep inelastic scattering region .    </S>",
    "<S> further theoretical and experimental studies of the quantity @xmath11 is needed , it will not only provide information on the spin structure function @xmath74 in the small @xmath12 region , but also allow more precise estimation on the @xmath12 dependence of the spin structure function @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> this investigation is in progress . </S>",
    "<S> further information on the asymmetry @xmath0 in the small @xmath17 region around @xmath2 is desirable to give a precise estimate of the dhg sum rule , it may also tell us how the transition from negative to positive @xmath0 happens quantitatively in the small @xmath17 region .    </S>",
    "<S> we show that there is a region that both contributions from resonance and the nonresonance regions are important , and the effects of the dhg sum rule is small . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , one could obtain the leading high twist effects reliably . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , our result of the @xmath12 dependence of @xmath25 is quite consistent with the recent theoretical analysis . </S>",
    "<S> the future experiments at cebaf@xcite will certainly provide us more information in this area .    </S>",
