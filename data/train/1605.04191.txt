    "competing interactions between particles or molecules that manifest at distinct lengthscales can generate hierarchical structure in soft matter systems  @xcite . for contexts as diverse as microemulsions  @xcite , block - copolymers  @xcite , graphene oxides  @xcite , and confined fluid mixtures  @xcite , this type of constituent frustration drives ( often abrupt ) transformations between homogeneous states and morphologies exhibiting micro- to mesoscopic density fluctuations .",
    "such modulated density fluctuations are typically classified as `` intermediate - range order '' ( iro ) because , for this class of morphologies , the structure factor @xmath0 displays a characteristic pre - peak at a low but nonzero wavenumber  @xcite . in turn",
    ", the emergence of iro can greatly impact the mechanical , optical , electronic , etc .",
    "properties of such systems , and the ability to detect , characterize , and ultimately _ engineer _ the emergence of iro structure can facilitate new material processing methods  @xcite .",
    "this publication concentrates on an iro morphology of increasing fundamental and technological interest : the _ equilibrium cluster phase_. such a phase comprises self - terminating , finite - sized clusters composed of solute monomers ( i.e. , primary particles ) ; the clusters themselves are ideally dense , amorphous , and relatively monodisperse in terms of their size  .",
    "they coexist with a continuous ( interstitial ) low - density population of monomers ; thus , reversible transformations between homogeneous phases ( where monomers are well - dispersed ) and cluster phases can be viewed as microscopic analogues of macroscopic liquid - gas separation .",
    "self - limiting cluster phases have been studied via theory , computer simulations , and experiments of various idealized  @xcite or archetypal colloidal suspensions ( e.g. , polystyrene spheres )  @xcite and more complex constituent monomers like proteins  @xcite , organic - inorganic complexes  @xcite , etc .",
    "the generic clustering behavior is attributed to a common physical paradigm : aggregates form due to a competition between short - range attractions that drive monomer association and long - range repulsions that collectively build up to attenuate growth .",
    "the former can be realized in colloidal suspensions via , e.g. , the introduction of crowder molecules ( e.g. , non - interacting polymers ) that induce depletion attractions , while the latter are attributable to ( typically weakly - screened ) electrostatic interactions between the ionic double - layers of nearby monomers due to their surface charges  @xcite .    despite the attention directed at colloidal suspensions that form cluster phases ,",
    "there remain basic knowledge gaps regarding their behavior and characterization , particularly in terms of how the shape of the structure factor @xmath0 relates to real - space morphology . to wit , while characteristic clusters _ must _ be reflected by the existence of an iro pre - peak in @xmath0 , it has also been recognized that suspensions can exhibit iro pre - peaks _ without _ having formed monodisperse multi - particle aggregates  @xcite . in other words , it is difficult even to positively detect cluster phases versus either effectively homogeneous phases ( exhibiting some other form of iro ) or , alternatively , percolated gel phases .",
    "meanwhile , it remains unclear which morphological lengthscale(s ) ( e.g. , cluster size , intercluster spacing ) the wavenumber ( position ) of the iro pre - peak captures , or whether it is sensitive to conditions like bulk monomer density  @xcite .",
    "being able to describe cluster morphologies by decoding @xmath0 would be conceptually powerful because it would allow one to obtain knowledge about multi - body structure based on pair correlations alone ; it is also of practical interest because _ in situ _ measurements of pair correlations are feasible for a wide range of soft matter systems and lengthscales , including nanoscopic primary particles and aggregates . in this vein ,",
    "our goal here is to use integral equation theory and computer simulations to _ unambiguously _ and _ simultaneously _ characterize @xmath0 profiles and corresponding suspension morphologies for a canonical pairwise interaction model that generates clusters , with a particular emphasis on surveying wide ranges of conditions that might be accessed through experimentally tunable parameters , including monomer packing fraction @xmath1 , monomer surface charge @xmath2 , suspension ( debye ) screening length @xmath3 , and short - range attraction strength @xmath4 .    based on our analysis of these model fluids ,",
    "we first systematically expand upon previous findings  @xcite to demonstrate the poor correlation between the emergence of the iro pre - peak in @xmath0 and the onset ( or even energetic favorability ) of self - limited clustering .",
    "we next demonstrate that the pre - peak position is dependent upon both cluster size in terms of number of monomers and average monomer density , and that it directly quantifies the average real - space intercluster separation .",
    "we then test two criteria based on @xmath0 that have been postulated to pinpoint the onset of clustering ( and thus positively detect cluster morphologies ) , which are based on the iro pre - peak height  @xcite and width  @xcite , respectively .",
    "we find that the criterion based on the pre - peak width , which encodes the iro thermal correlation length , is a more robust ( albeit still only approximate ) predictor of the onset of clustering .",
    "finally , we note that beyond this work , our accompanying publication focuses on describing self - limited cluster phases with free energy models adapted from classical nucleation theory .",
    "we focus on one of the simplest colloidal models  @xcite known to generate equilibrium cluster phases : a pair potential that combines a short - range attraction ( sa ) with a long - range repulsion ( lr ) .",
    "the so - called salr potential can be expressed    @xmath5    where @xmath6 ( @xmath7 is boltzmann s constant and @xmath8 is temperature ) ; @xmath9 is the non - dimensionalized interparticle separation ; @xmath10 is the characteristic particle diameter .",
    "note that we generalize the pair potential to account for _ multicomponent _ ( here , size - polydisperse ) suspensions where two interacting particles are of types @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively .    when conducting simulations ( see section  [ lbl : sims ] ) , we follow previous work and simulate three - component mixtures that approximate suspensions with 10% size polydispersity",

    "specifically , we study mixtures comprised of 20% small , 60% medium ( characteristic size @xmath10 ) , and 20% large particles with @xmath16 .",
    "short - range attractions can be realized in colloidal suspensions via the introduction of depletant molecules with exclusion volumes smaller than that of the primary particles .",
    "these depletion attractions are represented via a generalized ( 100 - 50 ) lennard - jones interaction    @xmath17 ( x_{i , j}^{-100}-x_{i , j}^{-50})\\ ] ]    where the lengthscale of the attractive well is approximately @xmath18 . here , @xmath4 is the baseline attraction strength between monomers and @xmath19 is an energetic perturbation that biases against demixing .",

    "experimentally tunable parameters are essentially @xmath2 , @xmath27 , and @xmath30 ( and , practically , even some of these may be interdependent ) . in our analysis , we choose to fix the relative bjerrum length at @xmath31 ( corresponding to , e.g. , @xmath32 nm monomers suspended in room temperature water with @xmath33 nm ) , which means electrostatic effects are set via @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",

    "this treatment mimics how short- and long - range aspects of constituent interactions are approximately orthogonal for colloidal suspensions , and is worth noting as it is in contrast to some studies where attractions and repulsions are simultaneously scaled via changing",
    "@xmath8  @xcite .",
    "finally , note that throughout the remainder of the publication , we notate @xmath36 as @xmath37 for aesthetic simplicity ( unless otherwise indicated ) .",
    "we execute integral equation theory ( iet ) calculations to efficiently predict @xmath0 across wide ranges of the parameter space ( @xmath4 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) underlying the pair interactions @xmath37 . in brief , iet partitions the total correlation function @xmath38 ( where @xmath39 is the radial distribution function ) into pair and multibody contributions by introducing the direct correlation function @xmath40 in the context of the ornstein - zernike ( oz ) relation :    @xmath41    in order to use eqn .",

    "starting from randomized initial configurations , we allow systems at @xmath58 , 0.030 , 0.060 , and 0.120 to equilibrate for @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 steps , respectively .",
    "( lower packing fractions require relatively more equilibration time given less frequent monomer - monomer collisions . )",
    "we have confirmed that these equilibration times are sufficient by ( 1 ) checking that energies have converged and ( 2 ) by visualizing the trajectories to check that clusters undergo frequent intracluster rearrangements and intercluster exchanges ( i.e. , that individual particles ergodically sample the simulation space ) .",

    "we first calculate the gyration tensor @xmath83 , where the elements are @xmath84 and @xmath85 is the the position of the @xmath11-th particle participating in the cluster in the @xmath86-th cartesian coordinate ( @xmath87 , @xmath88 , or @xmath89 ) . the radius of gyration is then given by @xmath90 , where @xmath91 , @xmath92 , and @xmath93 are the eigenvalues of @xmath83 in order of magnitude @xmath94 .",
    "the well - established relative shape anisotropy  @xcite is calculated via @xmath95 , which is bounded between 0 and 1 : @xmath96 corresponds to points ( particle centers ) that are symmetrically distributed and @xmath97 corresponds to points arranged linearly . to slightly smooth over instantaneous cluster distortions ( e.g. , when the outer edge is distended due to an imminent particle exchange ) , measurements of @xmath81 and @xmath82 are derived from @xmath83 tensors collected over blocks of 10 individual clusters ( where particle positions are renormalized relative to the respective centers of mass of the clusters ) ; in turn , average and error values are based on 500 of these measurements .",
    "we begin our discussion by considering the existence of a low - wavenumber pre - peak in the structure factor @xmath0 , which emerges at a position @xmath98 lower than that of the primary peak associated with monomer - monomer packing effects located at @xmath99 ( i.e. , a real - space lengthscale of @xmath10 ) . a pre - peak position of @xmath100",
    "is associated with suspensions dominated by short - range attractions , where such a pre - peak corresponds to ( infinitely ) long - ranged , densified regions and diverges in magnitude at the onset of _ macroscopic _ liquid - gas phase separation  @xcite . on the other hand , phases composed of self - terminating _ microscopic _ clusters must exhibit an intermediate - range order ( iro ) peak at some wavenumber @xmath101 due to their modulated structure ; however , as discussed above , it is tentatively understood that not every state exhibiting an iro peak is actually comprised of characteristically - sized clusters  @xcite .    in fig . 1 , we build upon these basic guidelines by examining an salr system where we fix charge @xmath2 and packing fraction @xmath1 while varying attraction strength @xmath4 and screening length @xmath3 over wide ranges .",
    "this allows us to : ( 1 ) systematically map out how the _ existence _ of the @xmath0 pre - peak and its _ position _ relate to some of the tunable parameters controlling interparticle interactions and phase behavior ; and ( 2 ) consider how the parameter space where iro pre - peaks exist compares to the parameter space where clusters emerge . in fig .",
    "1(a ) , we make the mapping tractable by using iet calculations with the approximate orpa closure ( see methods ) that can efficiently survey parameter space ; to address the latter comparison , we plot the line of critical attraction strength @xmath79 observed in md simulations ( where we can directly characterize multi - body structure ) , which corresponds to the onset of clustering at a given @xmath3 .",
    "meanwhile , in figs .",
    "1(b - d ) , we show selected series of @xmath0 profiles obtained from iet and simulations to illustrate the pre - peak shapes that correspond to the positions in fig .",
    "note that here we are using an approximate closure and making comparisons between monodisperse iet calculations and lightly polydisperse md simulations ; thus , while we can not expect perfect agreement between the methods , we do observe _ qualitative _ agreement in terms of the evolution of @xmath0 even in regions where @xmath0 is changing rapidly ( as exemplified in figs .",
    "1(b - d ) and elsewhere  @xcite ) .",
    "nonetheless , we restrict our comments below to general trends that should not be sensitive to these types of methodological choices .    focusing on fig .",
    "1(a ) , it is apparent that for any given repulsive interaction , it is only above a sufficiently strong attraction @xmath102 that a pre - peak of any position forms . as might be anticipated , a @xmath103 pre - peak forms in the limit of small screening lengths , while at sufficiently large screening lengths ( @xmath104 ) , one observes an iro pre - peak at @xmath105 that grows in from higher to lower @xmath106-values with increasing attractions . moving left - to - right in the direction of increasing screening length , the transition between @xmath103 and @xmath105 ( where the zero - wavenumber convexity switches from negative to positive ) is termed a lifshitz point , which is a common feature of fluids with generic salr interactions  @xcite .",
    "generally - speaking , to reach this transition , repulsions must not only exist but must also be sufficiently _ competitive _ relative to attractions to favor modulated phases ( minimum threshold repulsion strengths are known analytically for some temperature - controlled systems  @xcite ) . in the parameter space here",
    ", this condition means that given a surface charge @xmath2 , one requires a minimum @xmath3 to generate repulsions that can collectively stabilize aggregates once attractions start to pull monomers together .    from fig .",
    "1(a ) , one can also readily appreciate that the presence of an iro pre - peak is a poor indicator of : ( 1 ) whether a particular state is composed of clusters ; and ( 2 ) whether the charge - charge repulsions are even strong enough to favor persistent modulated structure .",
    "the first point has been postulated previously  @xcite , and here is bolstered by the considerable discrepancy between the region of parameter space where an iro pre - peak is observed and the region where formation of clusters occurs ( i.e. , at and above locus of @xmath107 ) . to wit",
    ", there is a energy differential of @xmath108 between the emergence of the iro pre - peak and the emergence of clusters over many screening lengths .",
    "meanwhile , one can also observe a second transition in the peak behavior of fig .",
    "1(a ) within the screening length range @xmath109 : moving in the direction of increasing attraction strength , an iro pre - peak initially develops , but subsequently shifts to @xmath103 while the system _ bypasses the formation of a cluster phase_. crossing this type of ( reverse ) lifshitz boundary is readily attributable to the physical setup we consider , where attraction strength is `` decoupled '' from repulsions ; after all , one should arguably be able to ramp up attractions to such high strengths that macrophase separation is favorable given even relatively strong repulsions .",
    "( alternatively , our previous work illustrates this switch for one case of extremely weak repulsions  @xcite . )",
    "this shift from @xmath105 to @xmath103 is exemplified in fig .",
    "1(b ) , which can be contrasted with fig .",
    "1(c ) , which shows an @xmath0 series at larger @xmath3 where the iro pre - peak persists and grows once it emerges .",
    "( these behaviors are rounded out by panel fig .",
    "1(d ) , which gives a representative series of a system shifting from a @xmath103 to @xmath105 pre - peak . ) taking these two observations together , one must keep in mind that iro pre - peak existence can not only considerably precede cluster formation , but can be very misleading at intermediate screening lengths where existence does not even _ universally _ signal that increasing attraction strength will result in formation of stable clusters .    to demonstrate that the qualitative trends of pre - peak existence and position shown in fig .",
    "1 are relatively generic , we show in fig .",
    "2 a representative series of pre - peak landscapes for various charges @xmath2 ( at fixed @xmath1 ) , and a comparison between landscapes for different @xmath1 ( at fixed @xmath2 ) . despite the varying conditions , we generally find : ( 1 ) that given sufficient integrated repulsions , the formation of an iro pre - peak precedes cluster formation by a differential in attraction strength upwards of @xmath110 to @xmath111 ; ( 2 ) that there exist intermediate ranges of @xmath3 where iro pre - peaks shift to @xmath103 prior to clustering ; and ( 3 ) that formation of finite - sized aggregates is very unlikely for screening lengths @xmath112 , though we can not definitively rule out the possibility .    indeed , the primary differences across these various conditions are systematic shifts in the critical attraction strength @xmath79 to form clusters . the locus of @xmath79 shifts to higher values as surface charge @xmath2 increases due to the need to overcome greater charge - charge repulsions .",
    "in contrast , for fixed @xmath2 and @xmath3 , the critical attraction strength @xmath79 decreases by between approximately @xmath113 and @xmath114 when @xmath1 is doubled ( trend applies from @xmath115 ) because this reduces the effective energetic barrier for bringing particles from the reference pair distance @xmath116 of the homogeneous dispersion to the contact distance @xmath117 in aggregates .    as a final point",
    ", we note that for a given charge @xmath2 , the range in @xmath3 over which the dense phase moves between an infinite scale ( i.e. , macroscopic liquid - gas separation ) at small @xmath3 to an asymptotic modulated structure ( given sufficient charge @xmath2 ) at large @xmath3 is quite narrow .",
    "moving horizontally at , e.g. , @xmath79 , across any of the landscapes of figs . 1 and 2 , the pre - peak moves from @xmath100 at @xmath118 to an approximately constant @xmath105 for @xmath119 .",
    "thus , one effectively reaches the coulombic limit in terms of the repulsion influence for screening lengths @xmath3 approaching only a few monomer diameters .      to forge connections between the iro pre - peak in @xmath0 and the real - space morphologies observed in salr systems , we analyze 3d configurations of approximately 100 different clustered phases generated via md simulations , where we can obtain @xmath0 while simultaneously measuring the number - size @xmath73 and real - space lengthscales associated with the aggregates",
    "we consider cluster phases formed for wide ranges of @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , where , for the sake of consistency , we specifically concern ourselves with states _ at the onset of clustering _ where aggregates of a preferred size have emerged .",
    "these states are defined by critical attraction strengths @xmath79 , where all of the state points that are analyzed in the following sections are listed in table i by their respective @xmath79 values . )    as demonstrated in figs . 3 and 4 , we examine phases comprising clusters in the size range @xmath120 that are compact and spherically symmetric on average , making these states promising for @xmath0 interpretation because they are relatively simple ( idealized ) in terms of their morphologies .",
    "we first consider figs .",
    "3(a ) and 3(b ) , where we show that plotting the radius of gyration @xmath81 versus cluster size @xmath73 follows the relation    @xmath121    where @xmath122 is a @xmath1-dependent prefactor on the order of @xmath123 ( hereafter notated @xmath124 ) and @xmath125 is the fractal dimension of the aggregates .",
    "the fractal dimension @xmath126 signifies that the clusters are compact objects , in contrast with aggregates that are more highly - branched and/or elongated , which would tend to exhibit @xmath127 .",
    "likewise , the magnitudes of the @xmath124 prefactors underline that these aggregates have high internal packing fractions , though we do see a modest positive correlation between @xmath81 and @xmath1 given fixed @xmath73 .",
    "this indicates that clusters are slightly less dense given closer intercluster proximity , which can be attributed to more frequent monomer exchanges that tend to instantaneously ( but , on average , isotropically ) enlarge the clusters compared to their `` isolated '' structure at very low packing fractions , e.g. , @xmath58 .",
    "meanwhile , measurements of the relative shape anisotropy @xmath82 , which are shown in fig .",
    "3(c ) , demonstrate that these cluster objects are highly symmetric even down to small sizes @xmath73 . here , we calculate the long - established parameter @xmath82 , where @xmath96 corresponds to points ( particles ) that are symmetrically distributed and @xmath97 corresponds to points arranged linearly  @xcite . calculated based on the monomer positions within the clusters , we find @xmath128 for all cluster sizes and packing fractions , which indicates symmetric arrangements of particles and complements the @xmath81-based findings above that mainly imply compactness . specifically , we observe @xmath129 ( very high symmetry ) for the most isolated clusters at @xmath130 , and a slight positive correlation between @xmath82 and @xmath1 that implies aggregate symmetry is somewhat sensitive to the increasing frequency of ( near-)collisions and monomer - exchanges , which tend to generate outlying particles and instantaneously distorted states that positively contribute to @xmath82 .    as illustrated in fig .",
    "4 , visualizations of the cluster phases complement the findings above : the aggregates formed in these systems are highly - compact and roughly spherical on average ; furthermore , based on these attributes and the size - scaling of the aggregates , we estimate the typical internal packing fraction of the clusters is @xmath131 . to wit",
    ", we observe good mixing of the polydisperse monomers , which frustrates intracluster crystallization and promotes intra- and intercluster diffusion .",
    "one can also appreciate the preferred sphericity of the clusters , though this can be instantaneously violated as clusters collide , merge , or exchange monomers .",
    "given the clusters are spherical , we can estimate the internal packing fraction using the expression @xmath132 where @xmath133 and @xmath134 are the volumes of the monomer and cluster , respectively ( here we assume monodisperse monomer ) .",
    "we then estimate the @xmath73-dependent cluster radius as @xmath135 where the latter coefficient is added because @xmath81 is based on particle centers .",
    "using the relation @xmath136 gives @xmath137 over the range @xmath120 , with the majority of sizes @xmath138 .",
    "this is comparable with dense simple fluids .    finally , in line with the observations of godfrin et .",
    "@xcite , we find that the emergent aggregates universally exhibit average intracluster coordination numbers ( i.e. , numbers of nearest - neighbors ) of @xmath139 , which is the well - established minimum coordination number corresponding to rigid percolation  @xcite . predictably , @xmath140 grows with respect to cluster size , where the scaling relationship between these two quantities is important for understanding the thermodynamics of cluster formation .",
    "we refer the reader to the accompanying publication for a more extensive discussion .      based on our collection of simulated cluster morphologies ,",
    "we first address what physical characteristic(s ) of these morphologies that the iro _ pre - peak position _ in @xmath0 captures .",
    "this is important because while the _ real - space _ lengthscale @xmath141 captured by the inverse pre - peak position is generally thought to encode the real - space cluster diameter ( or perhaps intercluster center of mass separation ) , there has been limited information available allowing for an unambiguous determination of what lengthscale(s ) @xmath142 truly captures . as such",
    ", there is not yet consensus about whether the pre - peak position should exhibit a systematic dependence upon bulk monomer density  @xcite . in other words ,",
    "if similarly sized clusters are found at two densities , should pre - peak position be the same ?    focusing on fig . 5",
    ", we find that the real - space lengthscale @xmath141 is equivalent to the average _ center - to - center intercluster distance _ @xmath143 . a direct comparison between the two quantities is presented in fig .",
    "5(a ) , which demonstrates excellent quantitative agreement , and fig .",
    "5(b ) makes it clear that the pre - peak lengthscale is correspondingly a function of both cluster size @xmath73 _ and _ bulk monomer density @xmath35 . to understand why this is so ,",
    "let us consider the number density of clusters @xmath144 , where @xmath145 is the number of clusters in the simulation assuming perfect size - uniformity and @xmath146 is the simulation box length .",
    "we can then write @xmath147 = ( \\rho d^{3})/n^{*}$ ] , where the second equality is simply due to the definition of the bulk monomer density @xmath148 .",
    "since , in the crudest sense , the average intercluster distance @xmath149 , we thus have :    @xmath150    as is evident from fig .",
    "5(a ) , there is excellent collapse in the data along eqn .",
    "[ eqn : lcc ] for all of the cluster phases tested .",
    "this analysis assumes nothing about the shape and/or compactness of the clusters ( only that they are distinguishable and of number - size @xmath73 ) , which has two implications : one can readily obtain cluster size @xmath73 given knowledge of @xmath142 and @xmath35 ; however , to obtain a real - space cluster diameter , one must _ independently _ possess an empirical relation between @xmath73 and cluster diameter ( or , e.g. , @xmath81 ) .",
    "of course , given our systems exhibit the size - scaling of eqn .",
    "[ eqn : rgscaling ] , we demonstrate in fig .",
    "5(c ) that this type of conversion from pre - peak position to cluster radius is quantitative .",
    "finally , though this model for pre - peak position assumes little about the nature of the aggregates , we can not rule out that the strength of the quantitative match between @xmath141 and @xmath143 may diminish for less - idealized morphologies that are not primarily composed of highly - packed spherical clusters .",
    "as already discussed , the existence of an iro pre - peak is necessary but not sufficient evidence for positively identifying a clustered phase . in this section ,",
    "we draw on our results from simulations to directly test two criteria postulated to detect the transformation between homogeneous and clustered phases : one based on the iro pre - peak _ height _",
    "( i.e. , magnitude ) and one based on the iro pre - peak _",
    "width_.      we begin by revisiting previous reports  @xcite that the onset of clustering occurs as the pre - peak height ( magnitude ) reaches the threshold value @xmath151 . in brief",
    ", this is an adaptation of the empirical hansen - verlet freezing rule developed for simple fluids  @xcite , which states that the height of the first pre - peak in the structure factor approaches @xmath152 at the fluid - solid transition ( i.e. , along the melting line ) . in this way , the @xmath151 clustering criterion is conceptually like considering cluster formation as a _",
    "microcrystallization _ event ,",
    "i.e. , a frustrated analog of the bulk freezing transition . however , this criterion for identifying clustering has only been tested for a limited scope of repulsions strengths and lengthscales , generally in schemes ( unlike the protocol here ) where attraction and repulsions strengths have been simultaneously rescaled by modulating @xmath8 .    in fig .",
    "6 , we plot the magnitudes of the iro pre - peaks in @xmath0 measured from simulations at the onset of clustering for our @xmath153 different systems , where we observe that for the majority of cases tested , the peak - height considerably exceeds ( by up to an order of magnitude ) the @xmath151 threshold .",
    "in essence , the criterion does not generally pinpoint the _ emergence _ of aggregates with a characteristic size because many dispersed states ( and/or states exhibiting generic amorphous iro ) at a given @xmath2 and @xmath3 exhibit iro pre - peaks with heights of @xmath154 well before attractions are actually strong enough to stabilize clusters .",
    "thus , one might instead posit that the condition @xmath154 is a _ necessary but not sufficient _ criterion for positively identifying clustered phases .",
    "broadly speaking , the criterion acts only as a minimum threshold because pre - peak height is highly - coupled to the @xmath155 limit of @xmath0 , which is proportional to system compressibility @xmath156  @xcite . to wit , the states where the @xmath157 values most exceed the @xmath151 limit at @xmath79 are those governed by relatively weak repulsions ( correlated with larger @xmath73 in fig .",
    "6 ) and lower @xmath1 , both of which contribute to high @xmath156 .",
    "thus , an iro pre - peak height can reach large values even as the pre - peak signature itself may be rather weak ( i.e. , flat , especially away from the clustering locus ) , simply due to the leading influence of the high - magnitude low-@xmath106 limit .",
    "this type of coupling between the pre - peak and zero - wavenumber limit is evident even at `` moderate '' packing fractions like @xmath158 , as shown in figs .",
    "6(b ) and ( c ) : relatively low - strength repulsions combined with the increasing attractions generating heterogeneity drive compressibility to high values ( e.g. , greater than 1 ) , with the pre - peak emerging and sharpening at correspondingly large magnitudes .",
    "more conceptually , it should perhaps be unsurprising that the hansen - verlet freezing rule is a poor fit for these systems .",
    "in essence , the rule was developed based on suspensions undergoing solidification due to _ packing effects _ ; however , clustering in an salr system is driven not by a competition between configurational free volumes , but by a competition between attractions and repulsions . in turn , while describing the cluster formation as `` microcrystallization '' seems fitting  especially for highly monodisperse monomers that form clusters with crystal motifs ",
    "it is a transformation more akin to a frustrated liquid - gas separation .",
    "we now move on to test a recently proposed framework  @xcite for identifying the onset of clustering based the iro pre - peak width , which encodes the _ thermal correlation length _ @xmath159 .",
    "conceptually , the thermal correlation length quantifies the real - space persistence of structural correlations and is most frequently considered in the context of fluids undergoing _ macrophase _ liquid - gas separation ( i.e. , unstable droplet formation ) . in this context",
    ", @xmath159 constitutes a prefactor in the well - established  @xcite second - order inverse expansion of @xmath0 about the corresponding pre - peak at @xmath103 :    @xmath160    and one can identify the liquid - gas transition based on the divergence of @xmath161 , which signifies formation of `` infinitely '' persistent dense regions .    for clustering systems dominated by frustrated interactions",
    ", one can analogously consider the @xmath159 encoded in the iro pre - peak , which quantifies the persistence of the _ modulated _ dense structure in the fluid characterized by the finite lengthscale @xmath141 . here",
    ", the inverse expansion about the pre - peak can be written :    @xmath162    which can be readily rearranged to give :    @xmath163    this rearranged expression makes it clear that the combined prefactor @xmath164 is equivalent to the second - order coefficient in a taylor series expansion of @xmath165 .",
    "this equivalence provides a highly practical expression for calculating the iro thermal correlation length    @xmath166^{1/2}\\ ] ]    where one must simply ( 1 ) record the pre - peak magnitude and ( 2 ) perform a polynomial fit about the pre - peak position @xmath167 to obtain the second - derivative .    in line with other systems that undergo frustrated microstructural transformations  @xcite",
    ", the peak - width clustering criterion posits that cluster formation should be characterized not by a true divergence in the iro @xmath159 , but instead when the iro @xmath159 first exceeds the only competing ( characteristic ) lengthscale in the system : the screening length of the repulsions @xmath3 . in other words ,",
    "the onset of clustering should occur when the iro thermal correlation length reaches the debye screening length , i.e. ,    @xmath168    the remainder of this section aims to provide greater physical intuition for this criterion and to demonstrate how it performs versus simulations .    to get a better physical sense for this comparison between thermal correlation length and debye length , consider fig .",
    "7(a ) , where we plot selected transforms of the total correlation function @xmath169 and the interparticle potential @xmath37 that highlight how the constants @xmath159 , and @xmath3 reflect the characteristic exponential decays ( negative slopes ) of the pair structural correlations and repulsive barrier , respectively . here , while repulsions are obviously defined by the exponential decay in eqn .",
    "[ eqn : ulr ] , it is also worth recalling that pair correlations have the form  @xcite    @xmath170\\cos[rk_{\\text{iro}}-\\theta]\\ ] ]    where the cosine term captures the modulated nature of the iro structure ( it is not normally included for , e.g. , simple fluids ) .    by examining the profiles in fig . 7 calculated for conditions ( @xmath171 ) exceeding the eqn .  [ eqn : xitcrit ] condition , we can readily glean the features of @xmath169 that characterize cluster phases in the iro @xmath159 framework : oscillations ( humps ) in transformed @xmath169 that asymptotically decay _ more slowly _ than the potential @xmath37 ( fig .",
    "7(a ) ) , where these tell - tale oscillations mirror long - range oscillatory structure in @xmath169 that occurs on the lengthscale @xmath141 ( fig .",
    "7(b ) ) and sets the pre - peak in @xmath0 ( fig .",
    "7(c ) ) . in contrast",
    ", for a dispersed phase ( here , @xmath172 ) , one observes @xmath169 ( transformed or not ) decay quickly to zero and display no characteristic oscillations at any intercluster lengthscale .",
    "comparing these cases , it is clear that by searching for sufficiently strong iro thermal correlation lengths @xmath159 , we are looking for states that exhibit persistent _ coordination shell _ structure in @xmath169 at a `` cluster - sized '' scale .",
    "this is intuitive given a clustered phase ideally comprises intermediate - scale densified regions exhibiting disordered fluid structure in themselves .",
    "finally , we consider fig . 8 , where we directly test the @xmath173 criterion by examining the @xmath0 profiles from our @xmath153 simulated systems at the onset of clustering ( i.e. , at @xmath79 ) and plotting the @xmath159 values extracted from the iro pre - peaks versus the @xmath3 values defining the respective repulsive interactions .",
    "we obtain the @xmath159 values via eqn .",
    "[ eqn : xitcalc ] , where we measure the pre - peak position and magnitude and then calculate the second derivative of @xmath0 based on a third - order polynomial curve centered at @xmath142 and fitted over a @xmath174 range . to give a sense for the uncertainty in @xmath159 , note that we plot error bars corresponding to the standard deviation in @xmath159 values across the @xmath0 pre - peaks exhibited at attraction strengths @xmath175 and @xmath176 .",
    "so how does the pre - peak width criterion perform ?",
    "8 demonstrates that the emergence of clusters occurs when the iro @xmath173 for a wide variety of @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 conditions , provided the interactions are governed by sufficiently large screening lengths ( @xmath177 ) . at smaller screening lengths ,",
    "we clearly observe a systematic breakdown of the criterion shown by the empirical dashed line .",
    "in retrospect , this is somewhat unsurprising given that iro pre - peaks manifesting equally diminutive correlation lengths would be very weak ( flat ) , i.e. , would not reflect persistent intercluster coordination shells . in turn , thinking about larger screening lengths beyond those tested ( @xmath178 ) , we would note that the critical iro @xmath159 likely exhibits weak dependence on @xmath3 because these systems effectively approach the coulombic limit for @xmath119 ( see figs . 1 and 2 and accompanying publication ) .",
    "indeed , given the spread in the data , there is already little discernible difference between the critical iro @xmath159 values recorded from the simulation sweeps at @xmath179 and 4.0 .",
    "taken altogether , we propose as a general guideline that to detect the onset of clustering , one search for the conditions at which the iro thermal correlation length is within the range @xmath180 and where ( given the discussion above ) the pre - peak height simultaneously exceeds @xmath154 .",
    "this two - fold criterion is advantageous because it does not depend on screening length @xmath3 and , while this rule is necessarily inexact , it is nonetheless more empirically robust with respect to conditions ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) , particularly over the intermediate screening lengths ( one to three monomer diameters ) common to clustering studies .",
    "we would also point out that this hybrid rule should serve as a _ lower bound _ with respect to @xmath4 for the appearance of clusters : above the critical @xmath79 , we have generally observed a bandwidth in attraction strength of @xmath181 before clusters start to form arrested percolated networks that are tentatively classified as thermoreversible gels  @xcite .    in closing this discussion",
    ", we do note that the original pre - peak width criterion , which requires knowledge of @xmath3 , can be used based _",
    "solely _ on knowledge of @xmath0 because one can not only extract the iro @xmath159 , but also an estimate for @xmath3 .",
    "( this is an alternative approach to estimating @xmath3 based on @xmath2 , @xmath27 , @xmath30 , etc . ) here , one can recall  @xcite that the direct correlation function @xmath40 is generally understood to scale at long - range as @xmath182 .",
    "given that @xmath183^{-1}$ ] and @xmath184 $ ] , one can : ( 1 ) measure @xmath0 ; ( 2 ) convert it @xmath185 ; ( 3 ) and readily obtain @xmath40 .",
    "this provides an approximate @xmath37 profile , which can be plotted ( as in fig .",
    "7 ) to deduce @xmath3 from its slope at long distance .",
    "thus , in principle , one can quantify the characteristic lengthscale of monomer - monomer repulsions _ in situ _ at arbitrary density .",
    "we have tested how the existence , position , and shape of the iro pre - peak in the structure factor @xmath0 can be interpreted for colloidal fluids that reversibly form self - limiting aggregate clusters due to isotropic competing salr interactions between monomers .",
    "a major goal was to survey a wide array of parameter space spanning both monomer packing fraction ( @xmath186 ) and the variables controlling monomer - monomer interactions ( including attraction strength @xmath4 , surface charge @xmath2 , and screening length @xmath3 ) .",
    "the bulk of our findings draw upon results from md simulations of approximately 100 different phases located along the locus of cluster formation , which exhibited relatively idealized morphologies comprising compact spherical clusters .",
    "first , both iet calculations and md simulations systematically corroborate the previous observations  @xcite that the _ existence _ of an iro pre - peak in @xmath0 is a poor predictor of whether a phase is clustered .",
    "notably , we observe that for many intermediate screening lengths ( e.g. , @xmath187 ) , iro pre - peaks can form at wavenumbers @xmath105 as @xmath4 increases , but subsequently shift to @xmath100 , which corresponds to macroscopic lengthscales , before any microscopic cluster phases can form .",
    "thus , iro pre - peak formation does not even guarantee that a particular set of conditions ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) favors self - limited aggregation at any @xmath4 .    provided a phase",
    "is clustered , we find that the _ position _ ( wavenumber ) of the iro pre - peak @xmath142 directly encodes the average real - space intercluster distance , where @xmath188^{1/3}$ ] .",
    "this dependence on @xmath35 means that for fixed cluster size @xmath73 , @xmath142 will show a systematic rightward shift with increasing @xmath1 .",
    "we add a note of caution that one can not directly derive a real - space cluster diameter from @xmath0 ; to obtain a cluster diameter , one one must possess an independent relation that can convert between @xmath73 and real - space lengthscale .",
    "we next tested a previously - proposed criterion for detecting the onset of clustering based on the _ height _ ( magnitude ) of the iro pre - peak , which states that the onset of clustering occurs when @xmath151 . over our wide survey of states",
    ", we instead find that the pre - peak height at the onset of clustering frequently exceeds ( by up to an order of magnitude ) the @xmath151 threshold because of the coupling between the shape of the iro pre - peak and the @xmath155 limit of @xmath0 , which equals the system compressibility and is highly sensitive to both @xmath1 and the strength and lengthscale of interparticle repulsions .",
    "thus , the condition @xmath154 appears to be a minimum threshold for clustering , i.e. , it is a necessary but not sufficient test for positively identifying clustered phases .",
    "we then revisited an alternative criterion for detecting cluster formation based on iro pre - peak _ width _ , which encodes the thermal correlation length @xmath159 , where the criterion states that the onset of clustering occurs when @xmath173 .",
    "we observe that this rule performs well for many different combinations of @xmath1 and @xmath2 provided that the screening length is in the range @xmath189 .",
    "however , the criterion breaks down at smaller @xmath3 because clustered phases , which are characterized intermediate - range coordination shells of aggregates , must correspondingly exhibit relatively large `` threshold '' iro @xmath159 values .    because both the pre - peak height and width criteria are only approximate across wide ranges of monomer interactions and packing fractions , we propose a _ hybrid heuristic _ for detecting the emergence of cluster phases based on @xmath0 : search for the conditions where ( 1 ) the pre - peak height exceeds @xmath154 and ( 2 ) the iro thermal correlation length encoded in the pre - peak width simultaneously reaches the range @xmath180 .",
    "the combination of these attributes should ensure that there is both a very strong signature of iro but also slowly - decaying modulated pair correlations corresponding to well - developed coordination - shell pair structure between clusters . and though inexact , this rule does not require knowledge of @xmath3 and should be reasonably robust to varying conditions and interparticle interactions .    in closing",
    ", we remark that beyond the connections considered here between pair correlations and clustering , there remain deep questions about whether one can alternatively identify conditions that favor clustering in salr fluids based simply on the phase behavior of fluids with equivalent attractions but no repulsions , which exhibit macrophase separation .",
    "indeed , previous work  @xcite has pointed to strong ( predictive ) overlap between the onset of clustering and underlying purely - attractive binodal boundaries in systems where temperature is the controlling parameter ; meanwhile , our related work on systems where attraction strength is the controlling parameter points to correspondence at least in the limit of very weak repulsions  @xcite . a fruitful area of inquiry here would be to understand how closely one can map between the temperature- and attraction - strength - based frameworks , which would lend fundamental insights into when and how repulsions drive otherwise macrophase - separating systems to form equilibrium microphase morphologies .",

    "<S> next , for approximately 100 different cluster phases at various conditions ( where aggregates range in size from six to sixty monomers ) , we quantitatively relate the shape of the structure factor to physical characteristics including intercluster distance and cluster size . </S>",
    "<S> we also test two previously postulated criteria for identifying the emergence of clustered phases that are based on iro peak - height and -width , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the criterion based on peak - width , which encodes the iro thermal correlation length , is more robust across a wide range of conditions and interaction strengths but nonetheless approximate . </S>",
    "<S> ultimately , we recommend a hybrid heuristic drawing on both pre - peak height and width for positively identifying the emergence of clustered states . </S>"
