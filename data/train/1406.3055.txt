    "for completeness , we give extra details here on why @xmath38 ( for nonzero @xmath149 ) is in the third level of the clifford hierarchy .",
    "first we examine the equation @xmath150 expanding the exponent , @xmath151 , the cubic terms cancel and we are left with a purely quadratic expression , namely @xmath152 . therefore , the rhs is a clifford that we denote @xmath153 .",
    "we further require that @xmath154 is clifford for all pauli @xmath88 .",
    "all pauli operators can , up to a phase , be written @xmath155 and so conjugate to @xmath156 where we have used commutation of @xmath38 with @xmath25 .",
    "since the clifford gates form a group @xmath157 is again clifford .",
    "next we must check that @xmath38 is not simply a clifford unitary .",
    "clifford unitaries conjugate pauli operators to pauli operators .",
    "therefore non - cliffordness can be established by finding a single pauli such that @xmath158 is not a pauli .",
    "we again consider @xmath159 , and the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ app_eq1 ] ) . for @xmath160 to be nonpauil , the exponent @xmath161 must be non - linear .",
    "this occurs provided the coefficient of @xmath162 is nonvanishing .",
    "therefore , we need @xmath163 modulo @xmath0 . if @xmath164 , we have a problem as @xmath165 ( mod @xmath166 ) vanishes for all @xmath149 . whereas , for odd prime @xmath167 , multiplication by 3 is always non - trivial   when @xmath168 .",
    "this argument does not apply when @xmath164 since multiplication by @xmath166 is actually multiplication by 0 , and so not invertible . ] .",
    "this is one of the fundamental reasons why it is simpler to construct codes with transversal non - cliffords in odd @xmath167 .",
    "earlier we remarked that a @xmath38 gate will be clifford equivalent to gates of the form @xmath169 , simply by combining @xmath38 with a clifford gate @xmath170 .",
    "however , this prompts the question whether all @xmath38 are clifford equivalent or whether the above @xmath41 codes ever have genuinely distinct non - clifford gates .",
    "this question was addressed by bengtsson _ et .",
    "al . _ in relation to mutually - unbiased bases ( mub ) and symmetric , informally - complete ( sic ) measurements , and here we present a brief review . in dimension @xmath171 , all @xmath172 gates are clifford equivalent . whereas in dimensions where @xmath173 , we find 3 distinct equivalence classes .",
    "we can move between different @xmath38 gates by conjugating the unitary with the permutation cliffords @xmath174 so that @xmath175 where in the last line we collect all the quadratic terms into @xmath176 .",
    "the interesting part is the cubic term , which has gone from @xmath177 to @xmath178 .",
    "hence , @xmath38 and @xmath179 are clifford equivalent if there exists a @xmath28 such that @xmath180 .",
    "the structure of the equivalence class is determined by the set @xmath181 which in field theory is known as the cubic residue of the field .",
    "it can be shown that the cubic residue forms a group under multiplication .",
    "we can now immediately leverage results in field theory .",
    "in dimensions satisfying @xmath171 , the cubic residue includes all non - zero elements of the finite field @xmath17 , so @xmath182 .",
    "therefore , we can always find a @xmath28 such that @xmath183 to ensure clifford equivalence .    in dimensions satisfying @xmath173",
    ", elementary field theory shows the cubic residue contains @xmath83 elements .",
    "the cubic residue is a normal subgroup of the group @xmath184 ( a group under multiplication ) .",
    "therefore , each element of @xmath184 belongs to one coset of the cubic residue , and each coset is equal in size .",
    "this gives three cosets each containing @xmath83 elements .",
    "cosets are closed under multiplication by elements from the generating subgroup , the cubic residue , and hence each coset defines an equivalence class of @xmath149 values .",
    "for example , @xmath5 satisfies @xmath173 and the cubic residue is @xmath185 with cosets @xmath186 and @xmath187 , providing the three clifford equivalence classes of @xmath149 values .",
    "so far we have only considered changing @xmath38 by applying clifford gates that permute and apply phases in the computational basis , having ignored the effect of the hadamard gate",
    ". however , hadamard gates simply change the basis , and so hadamards effectively just interchange the role of subsequent @xmath174 and @xmath170 clifford unitaries .",
    "we wish to find a general solution of @xmath188 for all @xmath189 , and as usual working modulo @xmath0 .",
    "we begin by breaking the sum into monomials , @xmath190 and see the problem reduces to finding the monomial solutions @xmath191 .",

    "we have shown that @xmath207 the modular dependence on @xmath208 comes from flt .",

    "<S> error correcting codes protect quantum information and form the basis of fault - tolerant quantum computing . </S>",
    "<S> leading proposals for fault - tolerant quantum computation require codes with an exceedingly rare property , a transversal non - clifford gate . </S>",
    "<S> codes with the desired property are presented for @xmath0-level , qudit , systems with prime @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the codes use @xmath1 qudits and can detect up to @xmath2 errors . </S>",
    "<S> we quantify the performance of these codes for one approach to quantum computation known as magic - state distillation . unlike prior work , we find performance is always enhanced by increasing @xmath0 .    </S>",
    "<S> quantum error - correction stores information in a subspace of a larger physical hilbert space and is an efficient method of protecting quantum information from noise . repeated measurements and error - corrections keep the information from drifting too far out of the error - correction subspace , also called the codespace . </S>",
    "<S> for robust quantum computation , we must be able to perform gates without leaving a protected codespace or amplifying existing errors . </S>",
    "<S> fault - tolerance is straightforward for a limited set of gates , the so - called _ transversal _ gates of the code . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , severe constraints exist  @xcite that mean such direct approaches can not provide gates sufficient for universal quantum computation . </S>",
    "<S> rather , we must rely on additional techniques to implement further fault - tolerant gates .    </S>",
    "<S> one route to universality is to prepare high - fidelity resource states and then use state - injection to convert the resource state into a fault - tolerant gate  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> reduction of noise in these resource states , sometimes known as magic states  @xcite , requires extensive distillation methods demanding that the majority of a quantum computer is a dedicated magic state factory  @xcite . due to the significant resource overhead , </S>",
    "<S> maximizing efficiency of these protocols is of paramount importance , and recently many improvements have been made  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one could try to circumvent this overhead by exploring one of many other ways to achieve universality  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , all these proposals have to sacrifice some error correcting capabilities , and so are only viable when physical operations are much less noisy ( such as was explicitly shown in ref .  @xcite ) . except for shor </S>",
    "<S> s method  @xcite , these alternative routes require codes with a rare property , and such codes also play a fundamental role in most magic state distillation ( herein msd ) protocols . specifically , these codes have as a transversal gate the @xmath3 phase gate , which is special as it is outside the clifford group yet still closely related to it .     codes at msd . _ ( a ) _ shows the efficiency metric @xmath4 ( the smaller the better ) for various prime @xmath0 . _ ( b ) _ two curves which @xmath4 fluctuates between , shown for much larger @xmath0 ( on a log - scale ) . _ </S>",

    "<S> [ app_cliff_equiv ] ) . ]    in almost every route to fault - tolerance , these exotic codes emerge as pivotal components . here </S>",
    "<S> , we tackle the problem of designing and improving analogous codes in the qudit setting of using @xmath0-level elementary systems . in this </S>",
    "<S> setting , qudit error - correction  @xcite has been long known , but only much later were analogs of @xmath3 phase gate characterized  @xcite and codes discovered with these as transversal gates  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> campbell , anwar , and browne ( herein cab ) analyzed several quantifiers of performance for magic state distillation using these codes  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> cab found marked improvement over comparable qubit codes for modest sizes @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> however , in even larger dimensions ( @xmath8 ) performance again declined . </S>",
    "<S> this fall in performance is peculiar , especially in light of other results showing qudit toric codes have thresholds increasing with system dimension  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> here we present msd protocols with commensurate improvements to thresholds and , more importantly , an unexpected improvement to efficiency that is not present in toric codes . </S>",
    "<S> fault - tolerant clifford gates   can be provided by toric codes , and our protocols extend this to a universal set of fault - tolerant gates ; with both components becoming more effective in higher dimensions , they pose a powerful combination . </S>",
    "<S> such gains will also apply to qudit analogs of the  magic - state free \" fault - tolerance schemes  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we consider an extended class of quantum reed - muller codes that are constructed in terms of polynomial functions , whereas the work of cab only considered linear functions . here </S>",
    "<S> we see that higher degree polynomials can be used to construct codes with the desired transversality properties . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the polynomial degree can grow with the qudit dimension @xmath0 , and , in turn , the effectiveness of the code also grows . </S>",
    "<S> we make this statement more precise by considering the code parameters conventionally labeled @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the number of physical qudits , @xmath11 is the number of logical qudits encoded and @xmath12 is the code distance ( measuring its error - correction capabilities ) . the codes presented here encode a single logical qudit into @xmath13 qudits , and our best performing codes have @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> it is desirable that @xmath12 is larger and @xmath10 is smaller , but we find both numbers grow with system dimension . </S>",
    "<S> the overall effectiveness is measured by the codes  gamma value \" , @xmath15 , which is smaller for more efficient codes . </S>",
    "<S> we find @xmath4 can be decreased arbitrarily close to unity by increasing @xmath0 and discuss the operational meaning of @xmath4 in the context of msd . </S>",
    "<S> these results are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ fig_gamma ] ) , which discuss in detail later . in summary , they show qudit protocols far ahead of the first proposed qubit codes  @xcite , and comparable with modern qubit block codes  @xcite without the disadvantages encurred by using block codes .    aside from the practical merits , refinements to notation and </S>",
    "<S> proof techniques present a clearer picture of why these codes possess their strange properties . for technical reasons , </S>",
    "<S> we consider only prime dimensions of five and above . </S>",
    "<S> extensions to prime power dimensions are plausible , and new techniques offer hope in arbitrary dimensions  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our results also enhance our understanding of qudit magic states as a resource theory . </S>",
    "<S> study of qudit systems benefit from neater phase space methods  @xcite that are absent from qubit systems , and a growing body of work shows a richer and more elegant resource theory  @xcite than for qubits , with interesting connections to quantum contextuality  @xcite and to symmetric informationally - complete measurements  @xcite .    _ </S>",
    "<S> definitions_.- qudits are @xmath0-level systems , and we label computational basis states by elements of the set @xmath16 and all arithmetic is performed modulo @xmath0 , so @xmath17 forms a galois field of order @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> let us review the structure of the clifford group denoted @xmath18 and a normal subgroup called the pauli group denoted @xmath19 , both being fundamental to quantum coding theory . </S>",
    "<S> those clifford unitaries that are also diagonal ( in the standard basis ) have the form @xmath20 where @xmath21 , throughout @xmath22 and we employ the number operator @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> generally , the clifford exponent is quadratic in the number operator , but when linear we find @xmath24 is also in the pauli group . in particular , pauli @xmath25 is @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> there are also clifford unitaries that permute the computational basis states , such that @xmath27 , where again @xmath21 . here , </S>",
    "<S> unit @xmath28 picks out elements of the pauli group , in particular , pauli @xmath29 is @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> the pauli operators @xmath29 and @xmath25 and tensor products thereof generate the whole pauli group . </S>",
    "<S> multiplication in modular arithmetic is not always invertible , which we need for @xmath31 to be unitary , but thankfully in prime dimensions we do have invertibility . </S>",
    "<S> these gates are not yet sufficient to generate the clifford group and we must also include a hadamard - like gate , @xmath32 , that acts as @xmath33 and a 2-qudit control - phase gate of the form @xmath34 .    _ non - clifford gates_.- as remarked earlier , the special ingredient we need is a fault - tolerant implementation of a gate outside of the clifford group . </S>",
    "<S> the qubit @xmath3 gate is non - clifford and has other useful properties . </S>",
    "<S> we consider qudit analogs  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such an analog will be diagonal in the computational basis , non - clifford , and will by conjugation map pauli operators to clifford operators . </S>",
    "<S> such gates are often said to belong in the third level of the clifford hierarchy , and this property is useful for gate teleportation  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we show these properties for unitaries of the form , @xmath35 for @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> we could include a quadratic component to the exponent , but the unitary would be clifford equivalent ( for more insights on clifford equivalence , see ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and the app .  </S>",
    "<S> [ app_cliff_equiv ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we find that @xmath37 is clifford and non - pauli . </S>",
    "<S> it follows that @xmath38 is in the third level of the clifford hierarchy , and so analogous to a @xmath3 gate ( more details in app .  </S>",
    "<S> [ app_hierarchy ] ) . however , there are important differences between qubits and higher @xmath0 qudits . for instance , the qudit non - clifford gates are order @xmath0 ( so @xmath39 ) , but the qubit @xmath3 is order @xmath40 , which changes the proof of transversality and ultimately leads to our improved performance .    _ the reed - muller codes_.-here we consider a simple subclass of shortened quantum reed - muller codes ( herein @xmath41 codes ) . the codes are defined in terms of polynomial functions from the nonzero elements of the field ( @xmath42 ) to the whole field , so formally @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> it is called a degree-@xmath44 polynomial if @xmath45 with @xmath46 and where lower case is used throughout for the coefficients @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> we also denote the degree as @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> fermat s little theorem ( flt ) asserts that @xmath49 if @xmath50 , and so all functions can be represented with polynomials of degree less than @xmath51 . when higher degree polynomials appear , we equate them via flt with the polynomial of lowest possible degree . </S>",
    "<S> we say the function is shifted by @xmath52 and unshifted when @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> we use these functions to describe quantum states , so that @xmath54 for example , @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> the codespace of such @xmath41 codes is defined by its degree , @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> we begin by defining the logical states @xmath56 as @xmath57 which is an equally weighted sum over all @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is a @xmath11-shifted function of degree no greater than @xmath44 . for the @xmath60 state , </S>",
    "<S> the functions are unshifted .    </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , @xmath41 codes can be described in the qudit stabilizer formalism  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> if a pauli operator @xmath61 satisfies @xmath62 for all @xmath11 , we say that @xmath61 is an element of the code stabiliser @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> we proceed by defining pauli operators @xmath64 and noting @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> one can then verify that the codespace is stabilized by @xmath66 for all unshifted functions of degree no greater than @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , the stabilizer contains operators @xmath67 , as we find later when discussing code distance . in terms of logical operators , </S>",
    "<S> we observe that since @xmath68 , we have @xmath69 and can identify @xmath70 where bars throughout denote logical operators .    </S>",
    "<S> _ transversal gates_.-the key feature of @xmath41 codes that makes them useful for fault - tolerant quantum computing is that they possess transversal non - clifford gates . </S>",
    "<S> that is , one can perform a logical non - clifford single qudit gate within the codespace by applying a product unitary . </S>",
    "<S> we shall show that for @xmath41 codes of degree @xmath71 , a logical @xmath38 gate can be implemented transversely by @xmath72 . </S>",
    "<S> we begin by considering some polynomial @xmath59 , the corresponding state @xmath58 , and how the product unitary acts on this @xmath73 where we introduce the shorthand @xmath74 and @xmath75 , and next we must evaluate @xmath76 . </S>",
    "<S> the following steps all rest on a remarkable algebraic feature of prime numbers , namely that all functions satisfy @xmath77 ( see app .  </S>",
    "<S> [ app_sum ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> now we must find the explicit form for @xmath78 in terms of the @xmath79 . by expanding out @xmath80 and using flt </S>",
    "<S> , we find @xmath78 is a sum over every @xmath81 where @xmath82 . this </S>",
    "<S> is hugely simplified if we restrict to @xmath59 with degree less than @xmath83 as there is only one contribution so that @xmath84 . under this assumption , </S>",
    "<S> eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq_mmu ] ) becomes simply @xmath85 , and so the phase depends only on the shift of the function .    in reed - muller codes , the logical basis states @xmath56 are a sum over polynomials shifted by @xmath11 . for @xmath41 codes of degree @xmath86 , </S>",
    "<S> these polynomials have degree of @xmath44 or less , and so the above proof directly entails @xmath87 . </S>",
    "<S> this shows that the product unitary acts on the @xmath41 codewords as a logical @xmath38 gate , and so transversality of a non - clifford gate has been demonstrated .    </S>",
    "<S> _ error correcting properties_.- the previous work of cab  @xcite used different proof techniques to show the transversality of non - clifford gates for @xmath41 codes of only first degree . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , those first degree codes could only detect a single error . </S>",
    "<S> however , increasing the degree of @xmath41 codes opens the possibility of detecting more errors . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , we will show below that @xmath41 codes of degree @xmath44 can detect up to @xmath44 errors .    </S>",
    "<S> we first review some basic concepts . </S>",
    "<S> the weight of an operator @xmath88 denoted @xmath89 is the number of qudits it acts upon non - trivially . </S>",
    "<S> we are interested in the smallest weight pauli operator whose effects can not be detected by measuring stabilizers of the code and that also acts non - trivially on the code . </S>",
    "<S> formally , @xmath88 must commute with @xmath63 , but not be a member of @xmath63 , and the minimum weight of such @xmath88 is called the code distance , @xmath90=0 , p \\notin \\mathcal{s } , p \\in \\mathcal{p }   \\ } .\\ ] ] we begin by considering only phase errors and again use polynomials to define multi - qudit operators , so @xmath91 . </S>",
    "<S> the weight of @xmath92 can be expressed as @xmath93 , where @xmath94 is the number of nonzero arguments for which the function @xmath95 evaluates to zero . </S>",
    "<S> that is , @xmath96 is the number of distinct nonzero roots of the polynomial . </S>",
    "<S> the roots are limited by the degree of the polynomial such that @xmath97 . putting this together , we have the degree - weight relation @xmath98 . </S>",
    "<S> next , we show that commutation of @xmath92 with the stabilizer puts an upper bound on @xmath99 .    </S>",
    "<S> recall that the stabilizers of @xmath41 codes include operators @xmath66 for all unshifted functions with @xmath100 . from @xmath101 , we know that @xmath66 and @xmath92 commute iff @xmath102 . </S>",
    "<S> recall that such sums only vanish when the composite polynomial , here @xmath103 , is unshifted . </S>",
    "<S> the shift of @xmath104 is @xmath105 , which by expanding @xmath106 is a sum over every @xmath107 such that @xmath108 . </S>",
    "<S> let us just consider monomials @xmath109 , then we have the simplification @xmath110 . by definition , </S>",
    "<S> a degree @xmath44 polynomial has @xmath111 , and so @xmath112 whenever @xmath113 . since @xmath114 </S>",
    "<S> , we conclude that provided @xmath115 , we can always find an unshifted @xmath59 [ with @xmath116 such that @xmath106 is shifted . </S>",
    "<S> this entails that the corresponding @xmath92 fails to commute with at least one element of the stabilizer , namely @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> conversely , for a @xmath92 error to commute with the stabilizer , it must have degree less than @xmath117 , and from the degree - weight relation this entails @xmath118 . being true for all @xmath92 entails all undetectable phase errors have weight greater than @xmath44 . as for @xmath29 errors , </S>",
    "<S> a similar analysis shows even greater protection . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the code distance satisfies @xmath119 , with equality being easy to confirm .    _ </S>",
    "<S> msd_.- we have shown transversal non - clifford gates for @xmath41 codes of up to degree , @xmath120 , and so a distance @xmath121 that grows linearly . </S>",
    "<S> this result implies increasing code performance with increasing dimensionality . to make this concrete , </S>",
    "<S> let us consider the performance when using these codes for msd . </S>",
    "<S> each round of distillation consumes ( @xmath51 ) noisy copies of @xmath122 and , when successful , outputs a purer magic state . to briefly review </S>",
    "<S> , a simple distillation protocol will take noisy magic states , measure the code stabilizers , and postselect on all  + 1 \" outcomes . </S>",
    "<S> this projects onto the codespace . </S>",
    "<S> next , we perform @xmath123 , outputting the first qudit . </S>",
    "<S> the role of transversality of @xmath38 is the following : it commutes with the code projection allowing us to instead consider the action of the projector onto ( independently ) noisy @xmath124 states and consequently directly detect errors therein . </S>",
    "<S> we expand on this last point . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath25 basis measurements will project noisy @xmath124 states into the codespace , allowing the @xmath29 basis measurements to detect phase errors . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the state is output with an infidelity @xmath125 where @xmath12 is the code distance , as analyzed in detail in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the above argument gives sufficient conditions for a code being useful for msd . </S>",
    "<S> codes without the desired transversality might , via a different mechanism , achieve msd , but the performance is no longer linked to code distance . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , msd can be based on the 5-qubit code  @xcite or steane code  @xcite and , respectively , reduces errors quadratically @xmath126 and linearly @xmath127 , though both codes have @xmath128 . only the @xmath29 basis measurement detect errors , whereas the @xmath25 basis measurements are entirely random . </S>",
    "<S> prior work  @xcite shows that all @xmath25-basis measurements outcomes can be accepted providing a success probability approaching unity as @xmath129 .    </S>",
    "<S> we now discuss the efficiency and noise threshold of msd with the high degree @xmath41 codes . </S>",
    "<S> the average number of consumed noisy states can be shown  @xcite to scale as @xmath130 where @xmath131 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , @xmath4 quantifies the efficiency for msd , with lower @xmath4 showing better performance . using the optimal @xmath121 </S>",
    "<S> , we find @xmath4 slowly approaches 1 from above . </S>",
    "<S> previously proposed qudit codes were first degree @xmath41 codes ( with distance @xmath132 ) and though cab observed improved @xmath4 for @xmath133 , this was followed by impoverished @xmath4 at greater @xmath0 . whereas , here @xmath4 continues to improve with growing @xmath0 . in the qubit </S>",
    "<S> setting , the 15-qubit code achieves @xmath134 . </S>",
    "<S> however , recent improvements in qubit msd have used block codes  @xcite that achieve @xmath135 ( the bravyi - haah limit ) and multi - level distillation  @xcite where numerics indicate @xmath136 . </S>",
    "<S> however , multi - level distillation requires very many magic states to be simultaneously prepared , and can not be used in conjunction with further resource saving methods that store nosier magic states within smaller codes . </S>",
    "<S> one detailed study of multi - level distillation concluded that the benefits are slight compared to the 15-qubit code  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , higher dimensional systems offer efficient protocols even for preparation of a single magic state , avoiding the complexity of multi - level or block protocols . </S>",
    "<S> though very large @xmath0 is needed for our protocols to get @xmath4 close to unity ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_gamma ] ) , modest @xmath0 is sufficient to outperform qubit protocols .    another important figure of merit for msd is the noise threshold below which the protocol successfully reduces noise . </S>",
    "<S> the threshold depends on the noise model , and here we consider depolarizing noise such that @xmath137 is mixed with the identity to give a state @xmath138 with fidelity @xmath139 . after a distillation round , </S>",
    "<S> the output is still depolarized with improved fidelity provided @xmath140 . for prime @xmath141 , we have numerically found @xmath142 shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ fig_gamma]c ) , and observed increasing improvements with @xmath0 . there is a monotonic improvement in both threshold and @xmath4 within the two classes of odd numbers , @xmath143 versus @xmath144 . </S>",
    "<S> jumps occur because the code distance only increases when @xmath0 increases by 3 or more . </S>",
    "<S> compared to qudit toric code thresholds , these distillation thresholds are consistently higher , and we exceed @xmath145 even with @xmath146 while toric codes only approach @xmath147 in the large @xmath0 limit . </S>",
    "<S> even so , there remains potential room for improvement in msd thresholds , though even in the qubit case , studying the maximum possible threshold is notoriously difficult  @xcite .    _ </S>",
    "<S> conclusions_.- in summary , we have shown that quantum reed - muller codes provide effective means of fault - tolerantly implementing gates that are essential to various approaches to quantum computing , with special attention paid to msd . </S>",
    "<S> further study is warranted of the benefits for qudit variants of non - msd approaches to quantum computing  @xcite , though the relative merits of these proposals is still poorly understood . </S>",
    "<S> unlike previous work , improvements in efficiency and thresholds continue to increase with @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> comparable threshold improvements are seen in qudit toric code , but improved efficiency does not occur in the toric code context , and so this is the more surprising result . </S>",
    "<S> we must remark that coherent control of high @xmath0 qudits is challenging , and in physical systems one may also see noise rise with @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> such features depend subtly on the details of the underlying physics . whilst many systems may not be well suited to qudit approaches , </S>",
    "<S> many atomic systems come equipped with large hilbert spaces for which control of many levels need not be substantially more difficult than control of just 2 levels . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , experiments in trapped cesium have performed gates between 16 levels at @xmath148 fidelity  @xcite .    _ </S>",
    "<S> we thank the european commission ( siqs ) for funding and mark howard , niel de beaudrap , hussain anwar , dan browne , and tom bullock for useful discussions and comments on the manuscript . </S>"
