    "lepton signals at the tevatron in the framework of mssm with general cp phases but without generational mixing .",
    "the stringent constraints by the electron and neutron edm on the cp phases have been also included in the discussion of the effects of the cp phases .",
    "for the sake of illustration , we have considered two exemplary scenarios for the relevant susy parameters ; @xmath168 with very heavy first and second  generation sfermions and @xmath165 with relatively light sfermions but a large @xmath155 . + we have found that in both scenarios the cp  violating phases can have a significant impact on the production cross section and the partial leptonic branching fractions of the chargino @xmath10 and neutralino @xmath11 . as a result",
    ", there may lead to a minimum rate of the tri  lepton signal for non  trivial cp phases .",
    "this implies that one should be careful when interpreting the chargino and neutralino mass limits derived under the assumption of vanishing phases , since the worst case is not ( always ) covered by just flipping the sign of @xmath13 ; rather it can occur from some non  trivial phases in between .",
    "+ the production  decay spin correlations lead to several cp  even observables .",
    "we have studied the useful kinematical observables such as the dilepton invariant mass distribution , the angular distributions of the final  state leptons , and the t ",
    "odd ( cp  odd ) triple momentum products of the initial proton momentum and two final lepton momenta .",
    "+ we have found that the the end point of the dilepton invariant mass distribution is very sensitive to the relevant cp  violating phases because of the strong dependence of the neutralino masses on the phases .",
    "therefore , these distributions can be very useful in determining the phases once the other real susy parameters are known .",
    "the angular distributions of the final  state leptons taking into account the full spin / angular correlations can differ from the non  correlated ones by a few percents .",
    "therefore , it will be sometimes necessary to consider the fully  correlated distributions in order to interpret experimental data properly .",
    "+ it turned out to be difficult to investigate the cp  violating phases directly through the t ",
    "odd triple momentum products at the tevatron with its upgraded luminosity of about 2 fb@xmath423 .",
    "but , we have found that a substantial region of the cp  violating phases may be explored through the triple momentum products with the luminosity of about 30 fb@xmath423 as proposed for tev33 .",
