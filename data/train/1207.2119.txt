    "in the last decade there has been an increasing number of works dealing with magnetic models to study quantum phase transitions . in particular , considerable interest has been directed to the transverse ising model ( tim ) used to describe a variety of physical systems @xcite .",
    "it was originally introduced by de gennes @xcite as a pseudospin model for hydrogen - bonded ferroelectrics such as @xmath5 in the order - disorder phenomenon with tunnelling effects so , it has been successfully used to study a number of problems of phase transitions associated with order - disorder phenomena in other systems @xcite .",
    "it provides a good description to analyze some real anisotropic magnetic materials in a transverse field .",
    "theoretically , various methods has been employed to study the criticality of the tim such as renormalizaton group ( rg ) method @xcite , effective field theory ( eft ) @xcite , mean field theory ( mfa ) @xcite , cluster variation method ( cvm ) @xcite , pair approximation ( pa ) @xcite , monte carlo ( mc ) simulations @xcite , and so on .",
    "the critical behavior of the one dimensional tim has already been established through exact results , where the ground - state energy , the elementary excitations and the correlation functions were obtained @xcite .",
    "the tim is among the simplest conceivable classes of quantum models in statistical mechanics to study quantum phase transition @xcite .",
    "the ferromagnetic tim has been studied intensively .",
    "the critical and thermal properties of the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic tim are equivalent , but the properties of these two model are very different at not null longitudinal field @xmath6 .",
    "for example , the ground - state phase transition in the ferromagnetic tim is smeared out by the longitudinal field in contrast to the antiferromagnetic tim for which the phase diagram remains qualitatively the some at @xmath6 .",
    "experimental investigations on the metamagnetic compounds such as @xmath7 and @xmath8 @xcite and @xmath9 @xcite , under hydrostatic pressure , have been performed .",
    "for example , in the @xmath7 compound was observed a sharp peak in magnetization measurements under a field inclined by @xmath10 with the @xmath11 axis ( perpendicular to the plane ) of the crystal .",
    "they concluded that the peak was affected by the ordering of the planar spin components .",
    "it is obvious that the field can be decomposed into the longitudinal and transverse fields .",
    "the model is described by the ising hamiltonian to which is added a term which represents the effects of the transverse field part . due to the requisite of non - commutativity of the operators in the hamiltonian , deriving the eigenvalues of",
    "the hamiltonian is a very difficult problem .",
    "therefore , many theoretical methods have been used to investigate this system @xcite .    from a theoretical point of view",
    "it is known that the effect of the transverse field in the ising model tim is to destroy the long - range order of the system .",
    "many approximate methods @xcite have been used to study the critical properties of this quantum model .",
    "some years ago , a simple and versatile scheme , denoted by differential operator technique @xcite , was proposed and has been applied exhaustively to study a large variety of problems . in particular , this technique was used to treat the criticality of the tim @xcite obtaining satisfactory quantitative results in comparison with more sophisticated methods ( for example , mc ) .",
    "this method is used in conjugation with a decoupling procedure which ignores all high - order spin correlations ( eft ) .",
    "the eft included correlations through the use of the van der waerden identity and provided results which are much superior that the mfa .",
    "the tim was first studied by using eft @xcite for the case of spin @xmath12 , and generalized @xcite for arbitrary spin-@xmath13 .    on the other hand ,",
    "the critical and thermal properties of the transverse ising antiferromagnet in the presence of a longitudinal magnetic field have been few studied in the literature @xcite . using the classical approach mfa and the density - matrix renormalization - group method ( dmrg ) @xcite , the ground state phase diagram in the @xmath14 plane",
    "was studied in one - dimensional lattice .",
    "critical line separates the antiferromagnetic ( af ) phase with long - range order ( lro ) from the paramagnetic ( p ) phase with uniform magnetization .",
    "the quantum critical point @xmath15 decreases as @xmath16 increase , and is null at @xmath17",
    ". the mfa approach does not give the correct qualitative description of the critical line @xcite .",
    "firstly , the quantum fluctuations shift the ground critical point @xmath18 to @xmath19 at @xmath20 underestimates critical value .",
    "second , the form of the critical line shows an incorrect behavior around of the critical point @xmath17 .    by using the eft approach , neto and de sousa",
    "@xcite have studied the ground - state phase diagram of this quantum model on two - dimensional ( honeycomb @xmath21 and square @xmath22 ) lattices , where was discussed the possibility of existence of a reentrant behavior around @xmath23 critical value .",
    "the spin correlation effects are partially taken into account in eft , while it is entirely neglected in mfa .",
    "the differences of results given by using eft and mfa show that the spin correlation has important on the phase diagram .",
    "the ground - state phase diagram in the @xmath14 plane is qualitatively similar to the results of fig .",
    "( [ estado_fundamental ] ) in ref .",
    "@xcite , but the reentrant behavior found by mfa occurs near @xmath23 .    in the present paper , using eft we investigate the quantum phase transitions of the ising antiferromagnetic in both external longitudinal and transverse fields .",
    "this work is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we outline the formalism and its application to the transverse ising antiferromagnetic in the presence of a longitudinal magnetic field ; in sec .",
    "iii we discuss the results ; and finally , in sec .",
    "iv we present our conclusions .",
    "the model studied in this work is the nearest - neighbor ( @xmath24 ) ising antiferromagnet in a mixed transverse and longitudinal magnetic fields divided into two equivalent interpenetrating sublattices @xmath25 and @xmath26 , that is described by the following hamiltonian    @xmath27    where @xmath28 is the af exchange coupling , @xmath29 denoted the sum over all pairs of nearest - neighbor spins ( @xmath30 ) on a @xmath31-dimensional lattice ( here we treat the two - dimensional lattices with @xmath32 and @xmath33 ) , @xmath34 is the @xmath35 component of the spin-@xmath36 pauli operator at site @xmath37 , and @xmath38 is the longitudinal(transverse ) magnetic field .",
    "the @xmath39 and @xmath40 spin-@xmath36 pauli operators do not commute , then a nonzero field @xmath41 transverse to the spin direction causing quantum tunneling between the spin - up and spin - down eigenstates of @xmath40 and quantum spin fluctuations .",
    "these fluctuations decrease the critical temperature @xmath42 at which the spins develop long - range order . at a critical field @xmath43 ,",
    "@xmath42 vanishes , and a quantum phase transition between the af ordered state and a quantum paramagnetic state occur . to the best of our knowledge , the model ( [ 1 ] ) at finite temperature @xmath44",
    "has not yet been examined in the literature . in particular , the ground - state phase diagram was studied by neto and de sousa @xcite , then , in this work we generalize it to analyze the field effects at finite temperature by using eft .    the ground - state of the model ( [ 1 ] )",
    "is characterized by an antiparallel spin orientation in the horizontal and vertical directions and so it exhibits nel order within the initial sublattices @xmath25 and @xmath26 ( see fig .",

    "in particular , the model ( [ 1 ] ) has an af ( ordered ) phase in the presence of a field , with the decreasing transition temperature as the fields intensity increases , where at @xmath45 ( ground- state ) a second - order transition occurs at both critical field with @xmath46 and @xmath47 .    to treat the model ( [ 1 ] ) on two - dimensional lattices by the eft approach",
    ", we consider a simple example of cluster on a lattice consisting of a central spin and @xmath30 perimeter spins being the nearest - neighbors of the central one .",
    "the nearest - neighbor spins are substituted by an effective field produced by the other spins , which can be determined by the condition that the thermal average of the central spin is equal to that of its nearest - neighbor ones .",
    "the hamiltonian for this cluster is given by    @xmath48    and @xmath49where @xmath25 and @xmath26 denote the sublattice .",
