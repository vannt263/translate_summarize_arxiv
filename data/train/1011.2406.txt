    "it is widely accepted that the large - scale magnetic field generation in the sun is governed by a dynamo process .",
    "mathematical models of this dynamo process standardly decompose the magnetic field into poloidal and toroidal parts , where the aim is to complete the dynamo loop of generating toroidal field from poloidal field and vice versa .",
    "the presence of differential rotation within the sun s convection zone is believed to be responsible for turning poloidal field into toroidal field , this procedure is known as the @xmath2-effect .",
    "the mechanism by which poloidal field is generated from toroidal field is still open to debate , and a number of different models have been investigated .",
    "one such model is that of ` mean - field electrodynamics ' , where the magnetic field is supposed to exist on two very different scales , and large - scale magnetic fields are generated through a mean emf induced by the averaged properties of small scale helical motions ( the ` @xmath0-effect ' ) ( see @xcite and @xcite for details ) .",
    "+ the @xmath0-effect is associated with an average over the small scales of the cross - product of the small scale velocity and magnetic fields .",
    "since it is due to an average , it is generally treated as a non - zero variable varying only on long spatial and temporal scales .",
    "this assumption would be acceptable provided that any high - frequency fluctuations of @xmath0 around this mean value are not too large . a turbulent , helical flow , which lacks reflectional symmetry about the equator ,",
    "might be thought to provide perfect conditions for the @xmath0-effect to work , enhancing the growth of large - scale poloidal magnetic field and leading to a large - scale dynamo .",
    "a study by @xcite , however , found a contradictory result .",
    "they studied rotating boussinesq convection where the flow was turbulent and helical , and found no large - scale dynamo .",
    "they calculated the emf and plotted @xmath0 as a function of time but found it to be wildly fluctuating with a very small long - time average .",
    "+ previous work by @xcite and @xcite has shown that when such fluctuations in the @xmath0-effect interact with a large - scale shear , unlike @xcite , then large - scale dynamo action can occur even when the mean @xmath0 is zero .",
    "both of these investigations used an @xmath0-@xmath2 dynamo model ; @xcite considered spatial variation of the fluctuations in quite a complicated calculation , whereas @xcite considered a temporally fluctuating @xmath0-effect in a much simpler setup .",
    "the @xcite calculation used a one - dimensional dynamo wave model and the @xmath0-effect was split into mean and fluctuating parts , where the fluctuations were large .",
    "a suitable average was taken , which resulted in a new term involving the fluctuating part of @xmath0 in the mean field evolution equations .",
    "it was then found that this new term can lead to a large - scale dynamo mechanism , even when the mean @xmath0 term is zero .",
    "this paper also found that when this new term was included in a simple mean field model of the solar cycle , the effect was a lengthening of the cycle period as the amplitude of the new term increased ; at a sufficiently large value , the solutions became steady .",
    "+ @xcite revisited the calculation of @xcite with the addition of large - scale shear , and found vigorous large - scale dynamo action .",
    "they concluded that the effect of introducing large - scale shear could be due to one of two mechanisms : the anisotropy of the shear could lead to a shear - current effect as discussed in @xcite , or the shear could interact with a temporally fluctuating @xmath0-effect as in @xcite both of which can be associated with off diagonal components of the turbulent diffusivity tensor , and lead in simple geometries to the same addition term in the mean field equations .",
    "either of these effects could also explain the amplification of the large - scale magnetic field found in previous numerical studies by @xcite and @xcite , where 3d simulations of turbulent convection and shear were investigated .",
    "these calculations support the necessity of large - scale shear , and correspond to the case in @xcite where a large - scale dynamo mechanism was found with no mean @xmath0-effect .",
    "+ the purpose of this paper is to extend the investigation of a fluctuating @xmath0-effect in @xcite by looking at the linear and nonlinear consequences of the new term in a finite geometry .",
    "firstly , in section [ sec : extension_of_model ] , it is shown that the model of @xcite can be extended to include more realistic spatial and temporal dependent fluctuations .",
    "detailed studies of the dynamics of the model in the linear and nonlinear regimes are conducted in section [ sec : numerical_model ] , which allow us to understand precisely how the steady and oscillatory modes interact , and the effects of parity on the system . preliminary results of this work are discussed briefly in @xcite .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : test_with_random_function ] , the fluctuating @xmath0-effect theory is verified by relating it to a simple one - dimensional model with a fluctuating function for the @xmath0-effect term .",

    "results are shown in figure [ zeta_vs_growth_rate ] , where @xmath130 is plotted against the growth rate . although it is not possible to make a comparison between the two models in the spatiotemporal case , it is clear that an increase in @xmath105 does lead to an increase in the growth rate of magnetic energy , as predicted by the asymptotic theory .",

    "the interaction of a spatially and temporally fluctuating @xmath0-effect with large - scale shear can lead to a large - scale dynamo mechanism , as in @xcite .",
    "moreover , a similar term to the new term found in @xcite relating to the fluctuating @xmath0-effect is calculated and found to be positive or negative , depending on the spatiotemporal spectrum of the fluctuations .",
    "if the term is negative the critical value of the dynamo number is increased , and dynamo action is inhibited .",
    "+ numerical investigations were made , both in the linear and nonlinear regime , by adapting the equations to a simple one - dimensional model of the solar cycle , and investigating behaviour in the two - dimensional @xmath73 parameter space . in the linear model",
    "it was found that the values of @xmath72 for the onset of unstable solutions are different for dipole and quadrupole parity systems at a fixed value of @xmath71 , but these become more and more alike as @xmath79 increases .",
    "the first two modes of stability are initially steady state , but join together at a codimension-2 point , where there is a region of solutions with zero frequency , i.e. steady solutions , to the left of this point , and oscillating solutions to the right . + in the nonlinear model , the onset of steady solutions was plotted in @xmath73 space and it was found that an increase in the fluctuating @xmath0 parameter , @xmath72 , led to an increase in the cycle period of the oscillations .",
    "regions of stable parity were determined throughout phase space and were found to be quite complicated considering the simplicity of the model .",
    "the boundary conditions were adjusted to allow the determination of the onset of steady and oscillatory solutions for the dipole and quadrupole cases separately , and combining these with the corresponding stability boundaries from the linear model reveals that the curve separating steady solutions from oscillatory solutions in the nonlinear regime tends to the codimension-2 point where the two types of linear stability join .",
    "+ finally , the asymptotic theory is verified against a one - dimensional dynamo wave model with a fluctuating function for the @xmath0-effect .",
    "firstly , the time - dependent case is verified in the nonlinear regime , where a new more accurate version of the asymptotic theory from @xcite is derived and used to compare with a temporally fluctuating function for @xmath0 .",
    "the relationship between the time - dependent function and the previous @xmath72 term is found and tested , and we see an increase in the cycle period of the oscillations in the predicted way according to the relationship derived . secondly , an attempt to verify the spatiotemporal case is made using a space and time - dependent @xmath0 function .",
    "it is not possible to make a quantitative comparison with the asymptotic theory in this case , due to contributions to the @xmath0-effect in the analytic theory which can not be calculated in a finite domain .",
    "instead , the test model is solved , in the linear regime , and it is shown that increasing the value of the spatiotemporal @xmath0 function does indeed increase the growth rate of magnetic energy .",
    "the governing equations are @xmath131 we follow the derivation of the fluctuating @xmath0 model used in @xcite , since this is the temporal case , with a more general function of @xmath7 .",
    "we split @xmath0 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 into their mean and fluctuating parts and apply a method of multiple scales such that @xmath132 where subscripts @xmath16 and @xmath17 denote the mean and fluctuating parts respectively , @xmath13 is the intermediate timescale and @xmath19 is taken to be small .",
    "a suitable average is taken such that @xmath133 and @xmath134 , and we obtain the following leading order mean field equations      the new term @xmath136 is calculated in the usual way and found to be @xmath137 substituting @xmath136 in equation ( [ eq : derivation_mean_a ] ) and , to use the same notation as section [ sec : nonlinear_model ] for comparison , we set @xmath138 , @xmath139 , @xmath140 and drop the zero subscripts . equations ( [ eq : derivation_mean_a ] , [ eq : derivation_mean_b ] ) then become          this derivation only concerns a temporally fluctuating @xmath0-effect",
