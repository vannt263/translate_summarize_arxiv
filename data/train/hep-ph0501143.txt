    "in papers @xcite-@xcite an attempt is made to develop an effective field theory formalism suitable for description of hadronic scattering processes at low energies ( see also @xcite and ref . therein ) .",
    "it was shown that the natural requirements of self - consistency of the perturbation series for scattering amplitudes lead to an infinite system of restrictions ( called _ bootstrap constraints _ ) for the physical parameters of a theory .",
    "once solved the bootstrap system would permit to uncover the set of truly independent physical parameters of the effective field theory .",
    "unfortunately , for the present we are unable to point out an explicit solution to the bootstrap system .",
    "so , roughly speaking , the only way to check the consistency of our effective theory approach is to perform the numerical testing of the relations ( sum rules ) for physical parameters of the theory that follow from the bootstrap system .",
    "in other words , we need to check if it is possible to approximately saturate those sum rules with the finite number of experimentally known resonances .",
    "this kind of verification was done for the cases of @xmath0 and @xmath1 systems ( see ref . in @xcite ) .    in each case",
    "it proved to be possible to single out certain groups of sum rules that are very well saturated with known data on the resonance spectrum . at the same time , there were found sum rules which can not be satisfactorily saturated with the same set of data .",
    "clearly , one of the reasons is that the modern information on hadron spectrum is far from being exhaustive ( especially in the region @xmath2 gev ) .",
    "that is why only those sum rules that converge sufficiently rapidly could undergo the experimental verification and posses certain predictive power .",
    "so it would be extremely instructive to learn how to pick out such sum rules from the infinite system of bootstrap constraints .",
    "the problem is that even the simplest ( tree level ) bootstrap system for the physical parameters of @xmath3 hadron scattering looks very intricate and awkward .",
    "its analysis is complicated by multiple technical obstacles such as the non - trivial geometry of mandelstam complex plane , the presence of various symmetries and bulky expressions corresponding to contributions of the high spin resonances .",
    "that is why it seems reasonable to simulate different situations that may be encountered in realistic numerical analysis . for this",
    "we need to consider a simple model example . a good candidate for such tests",
    "is the `` toy bootstrap model '' ( discussed previously in @xcite ) . surely , the main reason to choose it is that this model is exactly solvable , in a sense that in this case we have in hands the closed analytical expression for the amplitude that satisfies the system of bootstrap constraints .    in this talk we consider the numerical test of sum rules for this bootstrap model and discuss the methods of accelerating their convergency .",
    "we will also introduce the matrix methods that ( as show our preliminary investigations ) may be useful for the further analysis of bootstrap systems .",
    "we consider a simple model for the scattering amplitude that is constructed  in accordance with the idea of veneziano @xcite  out of @xmath4-function without a tachyon : @xmath5 in this section we give a short summary of the properties of this function .",
    "the string amplitude has the following specific points ( hyperplanes ) @xmath6 :    * zero hyperplanes : @xmath7 * pole hyperplanes in @xmath8 ( @xmath9 fixed , @xmath10 ) : @xmath11 * pole hyperplanes in @xmath9 ( @xmath8 fixed , @xmath10 ) : @xmath12 * there are also three series of ambiguity points located at the intersections of the zero hyperplanes with the pole hyperplanes in any variable .",

    "@xmath19 @xmath17 has the analogous asymptotic behavior .",
    "the layers @xmath20 and @xmath21 intersect as it is shown in figure  [ betabootpic ] .",
    "the residues of @xmath17 at poles in variable @xmath8 are given by the expression @xmath22 were @xmath23 stands for the so - called pochhammer symbol ( shifted factorial ) .",
    "residues at poles in @xmath9 read : @xmath24    it is often said that the string amplitude is constructed solely from the pole contributions of one channel : @xmath25 + \\sum_n \\left[{{\\text{pole } } \\atop { \\text{contributions } } } \\right].\\ ] ] however in @xcite it was shown that the meaning of this statement needs to be refined .",
    "the technique of cauchy forms known from the complex analysis allows one to represent @xmath17 in the system of layers @xmath26 as the uniformly converging series of the following structure : @xmath25 + \\sum_n \\left[{{\\text{pole } } \\atop { \\text{contributions } } } + { { \\text{correcting } } \\atop { \\text{polynomials } } }   \\right].\\ ] ] this is not just a sum of poles in one channel , because the cross - channel poles make explicit contributions to the correcting polynomials as well as to background term .",
    "the degree of the correcting polynomial depends on the asymptotic behavior in a given layer .",
    "for example , in the layer @xmath27 the asymptotic behavior of @xmath17 corresponds to zero value of the bounding polynomial degree ( the amplitude grows slower than a linear function of @xmath8 but faster than a constant ) .",
    "hence in the cauchy expansion we have to take account of the correcting polynomials of @xmath28th degree .",
    "thus we obtain the following series : @xmath29    in the layer @xmath30 @xmath17 grows slower than a constant .",
    "so , we can write down the cauchy expansion without correcting polynomials : @xmath31 note , that because the asymptotics becomes `` softer '' at large negative @xmath9 , this expansion is also valid in every layer corresponding to @xmath32",
    ". the similar cauchy form can be written for @xmath17 in the layer @xmath33 : @xmath34",
    "the full system of bootstrap equations for the string amplitude contains three types of conditions :    * the consistency conditions that arise naturally from the requirement that the cauchy form in one variable valid in certain layer can be analytically continued into the perpendicular layer . for this reason two cauchy forms in different variables written in two intersecting layers should coincide with one another in the intersection domain .",
    "+ e.g. , in the intersection domain @xmath35 ( see fig .",
    "[ betabootpic ] ) we obtain the following condition : @xmath36 with the help of generating function @xmath37 this condition can be rewritten as follows : @xmath38 * the _ collapsing conditions _ for excessive degrees of the correcting polynomials",
    ". + e.g. , the cauchy series ( [ cformby ] ) written for @xmath17 in the layer @xmath39 is also valid in the lower layers with softer asymptotics . however in those layers this expansion should coincide with ( [ cformby1 ] ) and we obtain the corresponding collapsing condition : @xmath40 * the _ superconvergency conditions _ in the layers with rapidly decreasing asymptotics .",
    "+ e.g. , in the layer @xmath41 the string amplitude is the ( @xmath15)-bounded function of the complex variable @xmath8 . thus one can write down the collapsing condition of the previous type for the function @xmath42 that is @xmath14-bounded in this layer",
    ". it reads : @xmath43    this system is by no doubt badly overdetermined and the problem of pointing out its full subsystem rests a serious challenge .",
    "we will return to this question in sec .",

    "the numerical testing of sum rules for the resonance parameters is one of the ways to check the consistency of our eft approach . in this section",
    "we consider various situations that may encounter in realistic eft models by analyzing the numerical tests of sum rules following from the above - described `` toy bootstrap model '' .    to perform these numerical tests",
    "we first need to define a quantity that would allow us to characterize the accuracy of saturation of a given sum rule after taking into account the finite number of items . because of the symmetry of spectrum",
    ", it looks natural to consider the difference of the contributions from the @xmath20-layer and @xmath21-layer poles at every step of the computation .",
    "usually the contributions of the first few poles have a definite ( say , positive ) sign but , starting from a certain number ( @xmath44 ) , the sign changes .",
    "thus the saturation of a sum rule is provided by the negative contribution of the long tail of distant poles .",
    "it compensates gradually the positive contribution of the first few items . as the convergence characteristics we chose the ratio : @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the discrepancy that remains after one considers @xmath47 poles in the @xmath20-layer and @xmath47 in @xmath21-layer ; @xmath48 is the sum _ of all _ positive contributions ( those corresponding to the finite number of the first terms ) . ] .    as an example we perform the numerical testing of the sum rule that follows from the bootstrap condition ( [ vboot1 ] ) with different @xmath49 and @xmath50",
    ". certain sum rules of this group are saturated very fast .",
    "for example , for @xmath51 first @xmath52 poles saturate the sum rule with @xmath53 discrepancy . the sum rule with @xmath54 saturates",
    "even faster : first @xmath52 poles give @xmath55 discrepancy .",
    "it is interesting to note that the scenario of saturation of this sum rule is in accordance with the so - called _ local cancellation hypothesis _ ( see @xcite ) employed in phenomenological models .",
    "it says , that the properties of the amplitude are mostly defined by the resonances with masses close to the energy scale under consideration and , possibly , by nonsingular background .",
    "the contributions from all the other resonances `` almost cancel among themselves '' .",
    "the fast saturating sum rules provide us with powerful constrains for the parameters of first few poles .",
    "the hope is that the reliable sum rules which were found for @xmath56 and @xmath1 systems are exactly of this type and , hence , they can be used to study the hadron spectrum .",
    "however , we will show that the fast saturation is not always the case and in certain situations the important properties of the amplitude may depend on the large number of distant poles .",
    "for this let us consider the sum rule that follows from ( [ vboot1 ] ) with @xmath57 : @xmath58 the convergence of this sum rule turns out to be very slow .",
    "the dependence of the relative discrepancy @xmath59 on the number of poles taken into account is shown in fig .",
    "[ nt1 ] .    to saturate this sum rule with high accuracy on has to use the detailed information about the resonance spectrum ( poles and residues ) .",
    "for example , to saturate it with @xmath60 accuracy ( @xmath61 discrepancy ) one has to take into account more than @xmath62 poles .",
    "now we would like to discuss a way that allows one to modify this sum rule so that it will be possible to saturated it with smaller number of poles .",
    "the trick we are using is very similar to the conventional method of accelerating the convergency : the partial summation of converging series . instead of ( [ cformby1 ] ) and ( [ cformbx11 ] ) representing @xmath17 in @xmath63 and @xmath64 we now make use the cauchy forms with excessive degree of the correcting polynomial .",
    "the bootstrap conditions in @xmath65 then read : @xmath66    we consider the sum rule : @xmath67    the smooth parts of the amplitude ( background terms ) @xmath68 and @xmath69 can be found , for example , from the bootstrap conditions in another layers . from @xmath70 ( using ( [ cformby ] ) , ( [ cformbx11 ] ) ) we find : @xmath71_{x=-2}.\\ ] ] in the similar way from @xmath72 : @xmath73_{y=-3}.\\ ] ]    the sum rule ( [ vbootwder ] ) saturates very fast : taking into account of just @xmath52 first poles one obtains @xmath74 accuracy .",
    "the contribution of distant poles ( in both variables ) is negligible .",
    "so , in principle , from this sum rule we also can obtain the constrains for the values of resonance parameters of few first poles .",
    "the studies of possibility to apply the methods of convergency acceleration for the case of realistic eft models describing hadron scattering to cure certain `` bad '' sum rules and to derive the fastly saturated sum rules are now in progress .",
    "the problem of analysis of the system of bootstrap constrains is closely linked to the general theory of analytic continuation .",
    "in fact , the bootstrap system expresses the possibility to carry out the analytic continuation of the meromorphic function with given asymptotic regime from one layer to the perpendicular one .",
    "bootstrap constrains result in a set of restriction for the resonance parameters of a theory .",
    "one of the most important ( and difficult ) problems appearing in our eft approach is formulated as follows : `` should we take into account the bootstrap constraints in all the intersection domains of various layers ? do the bootstrap conditions in the intersection domains of other layers impose any new restrictions on the parameters of the theory in addition to those following from the bootstrap system in a given intersection domain , or they are just a consequence of the bootstrap in one domain ? '' . to study this and the related problems we introduce matrix methods that are of great use in general theory of analytic continuation .",
    "let us consider the analytic continuation of the analytic ( in certain domain @xmath59 ) function of two complex variables .",
    "the coefficients @xmath75 of the double taylor series in the vicinity of @xmath76 : @xmath77 are linked to the coefficients @xmath78 of the expansion around ( @xmath79 ) by way of certain matrix operation @xmath80 : @xmath81 in fact , the matrix @xmath82 contains the complete information about non - trivial analytic properties of the function @xmath83 . on the other hand",
    "it is this matrix that transforms bootstrap conditions written in the intersection domain of two given layers into the bootstrap system in other domains .    for string amplitude it is possible to present the specific matrix of analytic continuation from , say , @xmath76 to @xmath84 .",
    "this matrix mirrors the recurrent properties of the @xmath4-function and transforms the bootstrap system at @xmath76 to another bootstrap system at @xmath84 : @xmath85 where @xmath86 \\right|_{(x_1,y_1)}\\ , ; \\label{matrix}\\ ] ] @xmath75 and @xmath87 stand for the sets of taylor expansion coefficients in the vicinity of @xmath76 and @xmath84 respectively .",
    "the bootstrap system requires that in the domain of intersection of layers the set of taylor coefficients calculated from the cauchy expansion in one layer should coincide with that calculated from the cauchy expansion in the perpendicular layer .",
    "so it is exactly the matrix ( [ matrix ] ) acting as shown in ( [ matraction ] ) that allows one to pass from the bootstrap system in a given domain to the system in the neighboring domains .    employing the information on the asymptotic behavior of the string amplitude that is contained in collapsing and superconvergence conditions ( see sec .",
    "[ bootforsa ] ) , it turns out possible to show that  due to recurrent properties of the string amplitude  the bootstrap systems appearing in all the intersection domains of various layers are , in fact , equivalent to one another .",
    "it is possible that the application of methods of the general theory of analytic continuation and of the technique of infinite dimensional matrices for the case of realistic eft models would also help to single out the independent subsystem of the full system of bootstrap constraints .",
    "the exactly solvable `` toy bootstrap model '' based on veneziano string amplitude is an outstanding proving ground for the development of methods to handle the bootstrap systems .",
    "the hope is that the results we obtained in the framework of this model will deepen our understanding of analytical properties of scattering amplitudes in the eft approach .",
