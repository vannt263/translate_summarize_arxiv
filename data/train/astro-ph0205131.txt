    "it has recently become clear that the great majority of the young low - mass stars in the nearest active star - forming regions ( sfrs ) are found in binary or multiple systems ( leinert et al .",
    "1993 ; ghez et al . 1993 ; ghez et al .",
    "although there is evidence that the mass in circumstellar material is smaller in binaries with separations @xmath4 au than in wider binaries or single stars ( jensen , mathieu , & fuller 1996 ) , a majority of young binaries emit excess radiation at infrared or submillimeter wavelengths which is typically presumed to arise in dusty disks .",
    "if the presence of one or more stellar companions does not severely hamper a disk s ability to produce a planetary system , then binary and multiple systems probably contain the majority of the planets in the nearby sfrs .    at present , only two multiple - star systems are known to contain well - ordered , edge - on circumstellar disks visible because of their occlusion of the central star .",
    "the hk  tauri  b and hv  tauri  c disks exhibit a morphology much like that predicted by scattered - light models : a pair of bright lenslike reflection nebulae trace the upper and lower surfaces of the disk , while the dense region nearer the midplane is dark ( stapelfeldt et al .",
    "1998 ; koresko 1998 ; monin & bouvier 2000 ) .",
    "there is no central point source seen in either the visible or near - infrared images .",
    "the near - infrared color of the hk  tauri  b star+disk system is bluer than that of the primary star , presumably because the light we see is scattered by small particles .    a handful of visual binary companions to t",
    "tauri stars are  infrared companions \" ( ircs ) , objects unusually faint at visible wavelengths but bright in the infrared .",
    "the ircs are mysterious because their spectral energy distributions show strong reddening and infrared excess reminiscent of stars at younger evolutionary phases than their primaries ( _ e.g. , _ koresko , herbst , & leinert 1997 ) .",
    "the structures seen in the two ircs which have been resolved in published high - resolution images are not edge - on disk systems , but a diffuse and irregular nebula ( koresko et al .",
    "1999 ) and a close double ( koresko 2000 ) . among the present sample ,",
    "the companion to elias  2 - 22 is known from previous observations ( chelli et al .",
    "1988 ) to be an irc .    clearly , the circumstellar environments of young binary stars exhibit a range of phenomena which are accessible to modern imaging techniques .",
    "this paper describes the first results of an ongoing effort to characterize the circumstellar environments in a larger sample of young binary systems .",
    "the sources were chosen from the binaries detected in the visible - light imaging survey of reipurth & zinnecker ( 1993 ; hereafter rz ) .",
    "they include all the binaries , with the exception of sz  120 , with separations between 1.0 and 3.7 and right ascensions between @xmath5 and @xmath6 ( equinox 1950 ) .",
    "this ra range includes all the rz binaries in the ophiuchus sfr , and several additional groups , for a total of 14 systems .",
    "the range of separations was chosen to avoid having the seeing - limited point - spread functions ( psfs ) overlap or fall off the edges of the detector . with one exception ,",
    "the distances to the targets are given by rz as 160  pc .",
    "their physical separations are larger than 100  au , so they are not expected to be strongly depleted of disk material via disk - companion interactions ( jensen , mathieu , & fuller 1996 ) .",
    "the sources are a somewhat mixed bag , consisting mainly of t  tauri stars but including at least one herbig  ae / be star ( elias  2 - 49 ) and a likely post - t  tauri star ( wsb  4 ) .",
    "many of the sources are well - studied , but a handful lack even published spectral types .",
    "ten of the 14 systems are members of rz s  systematic survey sample \" , which for the present purpose means that they were known to be members of dark clouds @xmath7 pc distant and are included in a list of young stars selected on the basis of a youth indicator such as near- or far - infrared excess or ca ii hk line emission .",
    "the remaining four systems are as  205 , both of whose components are classical t  tauri stars ( ctts )",
    "( prato et al . 1997 ) ; elias  2 - 26 , another ctts ( martin et al . 1998 ) ; elias  2 - 49 , a herbig ae / be star in hillenbrand s group  i ( hillenbrand 1992 ) ; and eso h@xmath2  282 , about which little seems to be known beyond the fact that it is an emission - line source .",
    "the 14 pre - main sequence binary systems were observed using speckle holography at near - infrared wavelengths @xmath8 m to produce diffraction - limited images with dynamic range of @xmath9 at 0.3 from the star , which is much better than would have been possible with standard speckle imaging .",
    "the improved dynamic range is possible because the psf is measured simultaneously with the science observations .",
    "near - infrared photometry in the j , h , k , and l bands was obtained the following night to measure the infrared excess of each component as a tracer of warm dust .",
    "two new tertiary companions with separations @xmath10.1 were detected , and an additional 7 objects were found to be marginally resolved . of these , 5 are extended along only one direction , which is consistent with the presence of a very close tertiary companion or a narrow extended structure such as a compact edge - on disk .",
    "the remaining two marginally - resolved objects were extended in all directions , which would be consistent with extended nebulosity but not with tertiary companions .",
    "no new edge - on disks were unambiguously detected .",
    "it is known from theoretical models ( _ e.g. , _ wood et al . 1998 ) and from recent high - resolution images ( _ e.g. , _ burrows et al . 1996 ) that pre - main sequence circumstellar disks with fiducial mass distributions are readily detectable in visible - light or near - infrared images only when they are viewed along a line of sight close to the disk midplane . in this orientation ,",
    "the direct radiation from the central star is blocked , making it possible to see the much fainter scattered light which traces the disk surface . the range of viewing angles over which the disk hides the star , and therefore the likelihood of detecting it if its orientation is random , depends on the disk s mass , radius , and flaring , and potentially on the degree to which the scattering dust has settled toward the midplane .",
    "the holography data were taken at the 10  m keck  1 telescope on 1999  june  1 using the near - infrared camera ( nirc ; matthews & soifer 1994 ) with the nirc image converter ( matthews et al .",
    "1996 ) to produce a magnified pixel spacing of 20 mas , approximately nyquist - sampling the @xmath11 mas diffraction limit at the @xmath8 m observing wavelength .",
    "the field of the @xmath12 pixel detector was 5.1 .",
    "the optical bandpass was set using either a standard k photometric filter , or , for stars which would saturate the detector in the k band , one of the narrower ks or ch4 filters .",
    "the observations of each visual binary consisted of hundreds of frames with an integration time of 0.14 sec per frame .",
    "this short exposure time partially  froze \" the atmospheric seeing , so that the raw psf consisted of distinguishable speckles .",
    "the separations of these visual binaries were large enough compared to the 0.5 typical seeing that only a small fraction of the frames were rejected due to poor separation of the stars .",
    "the data for each visual binary system were divided into @xmath13 series of frames , with @xmath14 frames in each series .",
    "series taken on blank sky were used to estimate the background and bias level .",
    "a journal of the holographic observations is given in table [ holoobsjournal ] .",
    "individual frames were calibrated by subtracting mean sky frames , dividing by flatfield images , and  fixing \" bad pixels .",
    "a model was computed for the detector ",
    "bleed \" signal which extended along the readout direction , as described in the nirc manual , and this was subtracted from the calibrated frame . for each frame , a subframe centered on each of the stars was extracted , with one subframe being treated as the science measurement and the other serving as a measurement of the instantaneous point - spread function ( psf ) .",
    "the subframes were either @xmath15 or @xmath16 pixels in size ; the smaller subframes were necessary for doubles whose separations were less than 64 pixels .",
    "the fourier power spectra of the target and psf subframes , and the cross - spectrum ( _ i.e. , _ the fourier transform of the cross - correlation ) of the two subframes , were computed for each input frame .",
    "these quantities are meaningful within a roughly hexagonal region of the @xmath17 plane containing spatial frequencies below the diffraction limit of the hexagonal keck primary mirror .",

    "an averaged fourier power spectrum and fourier phase for the target , corrected for the distortions due to the atmosphere and the telescope , were reconstructed from them as follows : the power spectrum was estimated as the ratio of the average target power to the average psf power , after removing a noise bias term from each .",
    "the phase was estimated as the phase of the averaged cross - spectrum .",
    "uncertainties in the power spectrum and phase were estimated from the scatter between the averages computed for the @xmath13 series for each visual binary system . the psf star in each binary",
    "was chosen arbitrarily , and the choice was reversed if it showed signs of resolved structure . in no system was there clear evidence that both stars were resolved , although in principle the technique would be insensitive to this if the morphologies of the two stars were sufficiently similar .",
    "the reconstructed fourier transforms were compared with models of single stars , double stars , and elliptical gaussian halos .",
    "these choices clearly can not span the range of all possible _ astrophysical _ models , but for targets which are only marginally resolved , they are sufficient to fit the features in the data .",
    "there is a degree of degeneracy in these model fits , in the sense that an unresolved star can always be fitted by a double - star model ( with either zero separation or zero brightness ratio ) or by a halo model ( with zero axis lengths ) .",
    "further , an object which is marginally resolved along only one axis can be fitted by either a double - star model or a halo model with a zero semiminor axis , since either model produces a power spectrum having a single broad stripe , and a nearly featureless phase , in the measured frequency range .",
    "the comparisons with models were done separately for each series of frames .",
    "only frequencies below that for which the median uncertainty rose to four times its low - frequency value at were used . for the double - star and halo models ,",
    "the fitting was done 11 times for each series , with the starting values of the parameters varied randomly , and the fit with the smallest @xmath18 value was chosen to represent that series .",
    "this was necessary because for some starting parameters the fitting routine became trapped in local minima in the @xmath18 surface .",
    "the final parameter values for each model were the averages of the results for the series , and the quoted uncertainties are the standard deviations of the means of those results .",
    "these statistical uncertainties are likely to be optimistic because they do not include the effects of systematic biases .",
    "the estimation of physical parameters is rather delicate and easily affected by those biases , especially for the marginally - resolved sources .    for the marginally - resolved sources , the final misfit ( @xmath18 per degree of freedom ) for the power spectrum was close to unity .",
    "the power spectra are more useful than the phases for marginally - resolved systems because the power spectra begin to show strong parameter - dependent structure at lower spatial frequencies than the phases do . on the other hand ,",
    "the position angles derived from power spectra suffer from an ambiguity of 180 deg ( _ e.g. , _ it is not possible to tell which star in a double is brighter ) . for the fully - resolved sources , which in the present sample are both primary - tertiary doubles , the fits to the power spectra tend to be poorer .",
    "this may be because the power spectra , being positive - definite , are susceptible to biases caused by zero - mean noise , while the phase tends to be unbiased by it .",
    "the phase fits also produce unambiguous position angles for resolved doubles . in summary ,",
    "the phase data are more useful for resolved doubles , while the power spectra are more useful for marginally - resolved objects .",
    "the photometric fluxes of the target visual binary systems were crudely measured in the j , h , k , and l filters at the keck  i telescope on 1999  june  2 , by imaging them with nirc . for the j ,",
    "h , and k filters , subframes of @xmath19 pixels were used with the image converter , while for the l filter the image converter was removed and the subframe size was reduced to @xmath20 or @xmath21 pixels .",
    "these choices were driven largely by the need to read out the detector fast enough to avoid saturating it on the brighter stars or , at the longest wavelength , on the blank sky .",
    "the stars determined the peak signal levels in the j , h , and k filters , so the exposure times were adjusted between 68  msec and 4  sec , and no coadding was done . for the l filter the frames consisted of 1000 coadds of 5  msec each .",
    "a total of 10 frames were taken on each target in each filter .",
    "periodically , frames were obtained on blank sky to estimate the background level .",
    "sr3 served as a photometric standard for the j , h , and k filters , and hd  161793 was used for the l filter .",
    "the frames were calibrated in the usual way , with sky - subtraction , flatfielding , and pixel - fixing . to derive the fluxes in the frames ,",
    "each binary was fitted using a model in which the two stars were represented by circular gaussians of adjustable size , intensity , and position . although the gaussians were not very good models for the psfs , the fact that the psf in each image was essentially identical for the two stars permitted the ratio of their brightnesses and the distance between them to be estimated accurately using this technique .",
    "the brightness ratios were combined with total flux measurements to derive the fluxes for the individual stars . at j , h , and k , these total fluxes were computed by summing the values of all pixels within 32 pixels of either star , after subtracting the background level estimated as the median value of all pixels at least 64 pixels away from either star . in the l filter the total flux was simply the sum of all pixel - values , after subtraction of a background level .",
    "the photometric fluxes were calibrated in the usual way by comparison of these numbers with similar results on standard stars .",
    "no attempt was made to correct for the differences in airmass , as those corrections were found to be smaller than the statistical uncertainties .",
    "the final uncertainties in the magnitudes are approximately 0.2 mag .",
    "separations and position angles of the binaries were derived from the model fits in each filter .",
    "the platescale with ic out of the beam has been carefully measured by the keck observatory staff , and the pixel spacing is quoted in the instrument manual as 0.1500 . by contrast",
    ", the 0.02 nominal platescale with the ic in is relatively uncertain . on the other hand ,",
    "the measurements of the separation vectors taken with the smaller pixels are likely to be significantly more precise , in the sense of having smaller uncertainties if the platescale error is neglected . to take advantage of this , the assumed platescale in each of the j , h , and k bands was adjusted to make the mean separation for all the visual binaries ( except for sz  116 , which was not measured in the l filter , and elias  2 - 49 , which is anomalous as discussed below ) equal to the mean separation in the ic - out l images .",
    "the required ic - in pixel spacing of 0.0207 was consistent between the j , h , and k images .",
    "similarly , the assumed orientation of the ic - in images was adjusted to make the mean difference between the ic - in and ic - out position angle measurements vanish .",
    "the results of the holographic imaging of the target binaries are summarized in table [ holosummary ] , and the fourier power spectra are displayed in figure [ power2d ] .",
    "the table presents the values of @xmath18 per degree of freedom ( _ i.e. , _ per frequency element in the @xmath17 plane ) for unresolved - star , double - star , and halo models of the target in each of the 14 visual binary systems studied .",
    "for the two fully - resolved doubles , the fits were made to the fourier phase , resulting in unambiguous position angle measurements , while for all other sources the fits were made to the power spectra . in the following discussion , a target",
    "is considered to be resolved if either the double - star or the halo model improves the @xmath18 value by more than 0.5 compared to the unresolved - star model .",

    "the robustness of this result is impressive in light of range of physical conditions spanned by the three sfrs .",
    "suppose that this result applies within the present sample of visual binaries for tertiaries at separations small compared to the visual binary separation .",
    "this can not be strictly true , both because the sample is _ statistically _ biased by the presence of the visual companions and because the companions gravitational influence restricts the range of separations for which a stable tertiary orbit may exist , but given the large ratio of the observed outer to inner separations and the steepness of the density function , it may not be terribly wrong .",
    "the orbital stability restriction has been estimated by harrington ( 1972 ) and depends on the inclination of the inner orbit relative to the outer orbit , the eccentricity of the outer orbit , and the mass ratios of the components , but for an outer - orbit eccentricity of 0.5 and components of similar mass it requires the major axis of the outer orbit to be approximately a factor of 10 larger than that of the inner orbit .",
    "the average projected separation of the visual binaries in the present sample is 2 , so according to the harrington criterion with the assumed parameters , and neglecting the effects of projection onto the plane of the sky , the systems on average should permit tertiary companions with separations no larger than about 200 mas . normalizing @xmath60 to produce the number of companions observed by kl98 within the range of radii to which their observations were sensitive , and integrating over an annulus extending from the approximate detection limit of 5 mas to the stability cutoff at 200 mas , leads to a prediction that 11 tertiaries should be found among the 28 primary and secondary stars in the sample . given the small sample size , the crudeness of the above approximations , and the possibility that some additional tertiary companions were missed , this is consistent with the 7 detected here .",
    "the brightness ratios for the target visual binaries measured in all four filters , plotted against the filter wavelengths in figure  [ brightnessratios ] , show no clear tendency for the primary star in a visual binary to be redder than the secondary .",
    "such a tendency would be manifested as a generally negative slope in the brightness - ratio curves .",
    "this contrasts with the result for the sample of taurus visual binary tts observed by moneti & zinnecker ( 1991 ) , in which the primary stars were redder than the secondaries .",
    "an examination of the color - color plot in figure  [ colorcolor ] shows no clear correlations between the colors of the visual binary components , their structure in the holographic observations , or their relative brightness .",
    "the present study is among the first to probe a sample of pre - main sequence visual binary systems with this combination of high resolution and dynamic range in the near - infrared .",
    "the results are not very consistent with the naive expectations that motivated it .",
    "more than half of the systems contain resolved or marginally - resolved components .",
    "two tertiary companions were clearly resolved at @xmath1 mas separations from their primaries , and tertiaries at separations below the diffraction limit are likely to account for the structure seen in all but two of the marginally - resolved stars , including the infrared companion ( irc ) in elias  2 - 22 .",
    "followup observations to search for orbital motion would be useful .",
    "the presence of such a large number of tertiary companions would make it necessary to search binary systems carefully before attempting to use them to test pre - main sequence tracks , since the light of an undetected tertiary will make a star appear younger and more luminous that it is .",
    "two stars showed extended structure which appears to be due to the presence of dust halos rather than tertiary companions , and one of these ( elias  2 - 49 ) has a separation which decreases with wavelength .",
    "strikingly absent is a clear detection of an edge - on circumstellar disk in any of the binaries in the sample .",
