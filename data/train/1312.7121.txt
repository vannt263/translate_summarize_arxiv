    "incorporated perovskites represent a valuable alternative as catalysts since they have a high thermal stability and their elevated compositional flexibility along with the presence of chemically active structural defects and localized electronic states offer tremendous tailoring possibilities for designing more efficient catalytic processes.@xcite palladium oxides is one of the most useful catalyst in oxidation reaction@xcite and the incorporation of pd in perovskite structure turned out to efficiently suppress the inconvenient clustering of pd particles , thereby improving the catalytic activity.@xcite    very recently , srpdo@xmath0 perovskite with a high catalytic activity toward hydrogen evolution reaction was successfully synthesized for the first time by galal _ et . al .",

    "all structures were fully relaxed ( including unit cell shape , volume , and internal atomic positions ) by using the screened hybrid density functional scheme of heyd - scuseria - ernzerhof ( hse06 , ref . ) until the hellmann - feynman forces acting on each atom were smaller than 0.01 ev /  .",
