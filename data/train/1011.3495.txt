    "observational studies of spiral galaxies have repeatedly established that galactic rotational velocities look nothing like the velocities that would be produced by the newtonian gravitational potentials associated with the luminous matter in the galaxies . in consequence , it is quite widely thought that such velocity discrepancies are to be explained by the presence of copious amounts of non - luminous or dark matter in galaxies .",
    "since the case for the presence of such dark matter rests solely on the assumption that wisdom acquired from studies on solar system distance scales can be extrapolated without modification to the much larger galactic distance scales , a few authors have ventured to suggest ( see e.g. @xcite for a recent review ) that dark matter may not actually exist and that instead it is the standard newtonian description that needs modifying . in this work",
    "we apply one particular candidate alternative theory , namely conformal gravity , to a large and comprehensive sample of 111 galactic rotation curves . with only one free parameter per galaxy , the galactic mass to light ratio , we find that the conformal theory provides for a good accounting of the data without the need for any dark matter at all . moreover , because our sample is so large , through our fitting we are able to find evidence in the data for the presence of a universal quadratic potential term that the conformal theory possesses .    as a theory , conformal gravity ( see e.g. @xcite ) is a completely covariant metric theory of gravity that possesses all the general coordinate invariance and equivalence principle structure of standard einstein gravity , but which in addition possesses a local conformal invariance in which the action is left invariant under local metric transformations of the form @xmath5 with any arbitrary local phase @xmath6 . as a symmetry , conformal invariance forbids the presence of any fundamental cosmological constant term in the gravitational action , with the action being uniquely prescribed by the weyl action @xmath7 , \\label{182}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is the conformal weyl tensor and the gravitational coupling constant @xmath9 is dimensionless .",
    "thus , unlike the standard einstein - hilbert action @xmath10 , which can be augmented to include a @xmath11 term , the conformal theory has a control over the cosmological constant that the standard einstein theory does not , and because of this one is able to provide a potential solution to the cosmological constant problem @xcite .",
    "for the weyl action the equations of motion take the form @xcite @xmath12=4\\alpha_g\\left[w^{\\mu \\nu}_{(2)}-\\frac{1}{3}w^{\\mu\\nu}_{(1)}\\right]=t^{\\mu\\nu } , \\label{188}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 thus , since @xmath14 vanishes when @xmath15 vanishes , we see that , as well as being a vacuum solution to einstein gravity , the schwarzschild solution is also a vacuum solution to conformal gravity .",
    "the conformal theory thus recovers all the standard solar system schwarzschild metric phenomenology , just as is needed for any metric theory of gravity .",
    "however since the vanishing of @xmath14 could potentially be achieved without @xmath15 needing to vanish , the conformal theory could also have some non - schwarzschild solutions as well . to determine what such solutions might look like , mannheim and kazanas solved for the metric outside of a localized static , spherically symmetric source of radius @xmath16 embedded in a region with @xmath17 .",
    "they found @xcite that in the conformal theory the exact , all - order classical line element is given by @xmath18 where the exterior metric coefficient @xmath19 is given by @xmath20 with @xmath21 . in equation ( [ e1 ] ) the presence of the three integration constants @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 is due to the fact that unlike the standard second - order derivative einstein theory , the conformal theory is instead based on fourth - order derivative equations , to thus contain two additional terms . with the @xmath25 product",
    "numerically being found to be small for standard astrophysical sources ( see below ) , we can set @xmath26 .",
    "then with the emergence of a @xmath27 term we see that the conformal gravity metric contains the familiar general - relativistic schwarzschild metric solution ( and thus its non - relativistic newtonian gravitational limit as well ) , while departing from it only at large @xmath28 , i.e. departing from it in precisely the kinematic region where the dark matter problem is first encountered .    in seeking to relate the various integration constants in equation ( [ e1 ] ) to properties of the energy - momentum tensor @xmath29 of the source ,",
    "mannheim and kazanas found @xcite that in terms of the general source function @xmath30 , the exact fourth - order equation of motion given in equation ( [ 188 ] ) reduced to the remarkably simple form @xmath31 without any approximation whatsoever .",
    "( the primes here denote derivatives with respect to @xmath28 . ) since @xmath32 vanishes identically everywhere while @xmath33 and @xmath34 evaluate to delta functions and their derivatives , we see that of the integration constants given in equation ( [ e1 ] ) , only @xmath22 and @xmath23 can be associated with properties of a local source of radius @xmath16 ; with the matching of the interior and exterior metrics yielding @xcite @xmath35 since the @xmath36 term in equation ( [ e1 ] ) is a trivial vacuum solution ( @xmath37 everywhere ) to equation ( [ e2 ] ) , as such it is not coupled to the local matter source , with the discussion here providing no basis for considering it further .",
    "( as we will show below , once we allow for matter sources in the @xmath38 region ( i.e. @xmath39 ) , we will be able to generate a quadratic term that will be coupled to the matter in the @xmath38 region . )    with the @xmath22 and @xmath23 terms coupling to the local source , we see that in conformal gravity a given local gravitational source generates a gravitational potential @xmath40 per unit solar mass , with @xmath41 being given by the familiar @xmath42 , and with the numerical value of the solar @xmath43 needing to be determined by data fitting .",
    "for @xmath44 to generate non - relativistic motions , it is necessary that @xmath45 and @xmath46 both be very much less than one , and that the @xmath47 product thus be very much less than one too .",
    "the domain in which we can use @xmath44 is thus an intermediate one where @xmath28 is neither too small nor too large , and in which @xmath48 and @xmath49 are such that @xmath47 ( and thus the quantity @xmath50 ) are very much less than one . in our applications of @xmath44 to galaxies we shall find that all of these conditions hold .",
    "however , since the form @xmath51 found above is exact without approximation , in the event that we were not in the domain needed to use @xmath44 , we would have to use the exact geodesics associated with the exact @xmath52 instead .",
    "in conformal gravity the visible local material in a given galaxy would generate a net local gravitational potential @xmath53 given by integrating @xmath54 over the visible galactic mass distribution .",
    "typically , the luminous material in a disk galaxy is distributed with a surface brightness @xmath55 with scale length @xmath56 and total luminosity @xmath57 , with most of the surface brightness being concentrated in the @xmath58 or so optical disk region . for a galactic mass to light ratio @xmath59",
    ", one can define the total number of solar mass units @xmath60 in the galaxy via @xmath61 .",
    "then , on integrating @xmath54 over this visible matter distribution , one obtains @xcite the net local luminous contribution @xmath62 \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\frac{n^*\\gamma^ * c^2r}{2r_0}i_1\\left(\\frac{r}{2r_0}\\right ) k_1\\left(\\frac{r}{2r_0}\\right ) \\label{e5}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the centripetal accelerations of particles in circular orbits in the plane of the galactic disk . in the @xmath63 limit",
    "this expression simplifies to @xmath64 with the entire galaxy acting as if it were a point source located at the galactic center . with the surface brightness of the optical disk region essentially becoming negligible by @xmath65 or so , equation ( [ e6 ] )",
    "can be expected to be a good approximation to equation ( [ e5 ] ) at points with @xmath66 .",
    "unlike the situation that obtains in standard second - order gravity , one can not simply use equation ( [ e5 ] ) as is to fit galactic rotation curve data , as one must take into consideration the effect of the rest of the material in the universe as well . to see why this is the case",
    ", we recall that for standard gravity , the solution to the second - order poisson equation @xmath67 for a general static , spherically symmetric source @xmath68 is given by @xmath69 with derivative @xmath70 as such , the import of equation ( [ e8 ] ) is that even though @xmath68 could continue globally all the way to infinity , the force at any radial point @xmath28 is determined only by the material in the local @xmath71 region . in this sense newtonian gravity is local , since to explain a gravitational effect in some local region one only needs to consider the material in that region .",
    "thus in newtonian gravity , if one wishes to explain the behavior of galactic rotation curves through the use of dark matter , one must locate the dark matter where the problem is and not elsewhere . since the discrepancy problem in galaxies occurs primarily in the region beyond the optical disk",
    ", one must thus locate galactic dark matter in precisely the region in galaxies where there is little or no visible matter .    despite the fact that the force in equation ( [ e8 ] ) is not sensitive to any material beyond the radial point of interest ,",
    "this local character to newtonian gravity is not a generic property of any gravitational potential . in particular for the fourth - order poisson equation @xmath72 of interest to conformal gravity ,",
    "the general solution is of the form @xmath73 with the derivative of the potential evaluating to @xmath74 this time we do find a contribution to the force coming from material that is beyond the radial point of interest .",
    "thus in the third integral in equation ( [ e10 ] ) we recognize a potential global contribution to local motions , with a test particle in orbit in a galaxy being able to sample both the local field due to the matter in the galaxy and the global field due to the material in the rest of the universe as well . in conformal gravity then , to determine motions of particles inside of galaxies one can not ignore the effect of the material outside of them .    in order to determine the effect that material exterior to galaxies might have on galaxies",
    ", we note that there are actually two global effects that we need to take into consideration .",
    "specifically , we need to consider the effects of both the homogeneous background cosmology and the inhomogeneities that are present in it .",
    "moreover , in the conformal theory , these effects have very different geometric structures .",
    "the global background cosmology is described by a comoving robertson - walker ( rw ) geometry . since an rw geometry is homogeneous and isotropic , its metric is conformal to flat .",
    "thus in an rw geometry both the weyl tensor and @xmath14 vanish identically .",
    "however , since by their very nature inhomogeneities can localize in space , they are associated with geometries in which neither the weyl tensor nor @xmath14 can vanish .",
    "indeed , in the derivation of equation ( [ e2 ] ) given in @xcite , it was found that in a static , spherically symmetric geometry the quantity @xmath75 evaluates exactly to @xmath76 , with some components of @xmath14 necessarily being non - zero in any configuration in which @xmath76 is non - zero .",
    "thus it is only inhomogeneities that contribute to the third integral in equation ( [ e10 ] ) .",
    "as regards the cosmological background , we note that since the background is associated with @xmath77 , it too will contribute to the solution to @xmath78 .",
    "however , it will do so not as part of the particular integral solution given in equation ( [ e10 ] ) but as part of the complementary solution to @xmath79 instead .",
    "the background cosmology can thus have physical consequences for galactic motions provided it causes @xmath14 to vanish non - trivially , i.e. provided it causes @xmath80 to vanish non - trivially in equation ( [ 188 ] ) .",
    "we thus recall @xcite that in conformal gravity one can indeed construct cosmologies in which @xmath80 does vanish non - trivially , and in them the scale factor @xmath81 and the 3-curvature @xmath82 of the rw metric are related to the cosmological matter content , with @xmath82 being found @xcite to be negative .",
    "with the hubble flow being described in comoving coordinates and galactic rotational velocities being measured in a coordinate system in which a galaxy is at rest , to determine the effect of the hubble flow on galactic motions we need to transform the rw metric to a static coordinate system . to this end",
    ", we recall @xcite that the general coordinate transformation @xmath83 effects the metric transformation @xmath84 ^ 2 } { [ ( 1-\\gamma_0\\rho/4)^2+k\\rho^2/4]^2 } \\left[-c^2d\\tau^2+\\frac{r^2(\\tau)}{[1-(\\gamma_0 ^ 2/16+k/4)\\rho^2]^2 } \\left(d\\rho^2+\\rho^2d\\omega_2\\right)\\right ] .",
    "\\label{e12}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the transformed metric being written compactly as @xmath85 ^ 2 } \\left(d\\rho^2+\\rho^2d\\omega_2\\right)\\right ] , \\label{e13}\\ ] ] we see that the transformed metric is conformally equivalent to a comoving rw metric as written in spatially isotropic coordinates with spatial 3-curvature @xmath86 . since an rw geometry is conformal to flat and since it remains so under a conformal transformation , we see that when written in a static coordinate system a comoving conformal cosmology looks just like a static metric with universal linear and quadratic terms .    with the dynamics that leads to the @xmath87 rw metric in the first place only involving one physical cosmological scale and not two @xcite , the decomposition of just one rw scale ( viz .",
    "@xmath82 ) into two static scales ( @xmath88 and @xmath24 ) is artificial , and it is not meaningful to keep both @xmath88 and @xmath24 . with a @xmath87 rw metric only being defined for @xmath89 , we see that if we keep the @xmath24 term alone , which would require @xmath90 to be positive , the coordinate @xmath28 would become complex at @xmath91 , with a transformation of the form @xmath92 $ ] , @xmath93 only being able to cover an @xmath94 patch of a static spacetime geometry . however , if we keep the @xmath88 term alone in equation ( [ e11 ] ) , then provided @xmath88 is taken to be positive , the coordinate @xmath28 would then be able to run all the way to infinity ( just as one would want of a static , spherically symmetric geometry ) , with nothing being able to become complex .",
    "thus , to be able to recover the standard static geometry with its infinite domain for the coordinate @xmath28 , we shall retain the @xmath88 term and leave out the @xmath24 term in the coordinate transformation .",
    "( for a discussion of a possible role for the @xmath24-dependent transformation in a cosmological context see @xcite . ) and while we shall uncover yet another quadratic term below , viz .",
    "the @xmath95 term that is associated with cosmological inhomogeneities , we will find that its scale is sub - cosmological and thus not to be associated with the cosmological @xmath36 term given in equation ( [ e12 ] ) .",
    "( for purely phenomenological purposes , if one were to keep both of the cosmological @xmath96 and @xmath36 terms in equation ( [ e12 ] ) anyway , one could consider the quadratic term to be used in the fitting described below to be a composite of homogeneously and inhomogeneously induced quadratic terms . )    on dropping @xmath24 we replace equations ( [ e11 ] ) and ( [ e12 ] ) by @xmath97 and @xmath98 ^ 2 } \\left(d\\rho^2+\\rho^2d\\omega_2\\right)\\right ] .",
    "\\label{e15}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] without the @xmath24 term the rw 3-curvature is given by @xmath99 , a necessarily negative quantity . since the only way to make @xmath82 be",
    "positive would be to have complex @xmath88 , and the only way to make @xmath82 be zero would be to have @xmath100 , we see that in the rest frame of a comoving galaxy ( i.e. one with no peculiar velocity with respect to the hubble flow ) , a topologically open comoving cosmology ( viz . just the one found in @xcite ) , and only a topologically open one , looks just like a universal linear potential , with a strength given by @xmath101 .    in the conformal theory",
    "then we recognize not one but two linear potential terms , a local @xmath102-dependent one associated with the matter within a galaxy and a global cosmological one @xmath103 associated with the cosmological background .",
    "thus in @xcite it was noted that in the weak gravity limit one could add the two potentials , with the total circular velocity @xmath104 then being given by @xmath105 with asymptotic limit @xmath106 in @xcite equation ( [ e16 ] ) was used to fit the galactic rotation curve data of a sample of 11 galaxies , and good fits were found , with the two universal linear potential parameters being found to be given by @xmath107 the value obtained for @xmath49 entails that the linear potential of the sun is so small that there are no modifications to standard solar system phenomenology , with the values obtained for @xmath102 and @xmath88 being so small that one has to go all the way to galactic systems before their effects can become as big as the newtonian contribution . moreover",
    ", the value obtained for @xmath88 shows that it is indeed of cosmological magnitude , just as desired .    while the analysis described above provides no unequivocal reason for including any possible quadratic potential term in equation ( [ e16 ] ) , valid justification for considering it is obtained by considering not the homogeneous cosmological background , but rather the inhomogeneities in it . on large scales",
    "these inhomogeneities would typically be in the form of clusters and superclusters and would be associated with distance scales between 1 mpc and 100 mpc or so . without knowing anything other than that about them ,",
    "we see from equation ( [ e9 ] ) that for calculating potentials at galactic distance scales ( viz",
    ". scales much less than cluster scales ) the inhomogeneities would contribute constant and quadratic terms multiplied by integrals that are evaluated between fixed end points , to thus be constants .",
    "( i.e. all that we require of the @xmath108 integral in equation ( [ e9 ] ) is that it begin at some minimum cluster - sized radius @xmath109 that is outside the galaxy and independent of it . )",
    "thus given the quadratic term in equation ( [ e9 ] ) , then again up to peculiar velocity effects , for weak gravity , and on scales @xmath110 , we can augment equation ( [ e16 ] ) to @xmath111 where @xmath112 , with associated asymptotic limit @xmath113 as such , equation ( [ e20 ] ) can be derived from a metric with a term @xmath114 , and thus has a de sitter - like form .",
    "however , it is not associated with an explicit de sitter geometry per se since the inhomogeneities that give rise to it are not distributed in a maximally 4-symmetric way .",
    "nonetheless , a particle in orbit in a galaxy would be affected by the quadratic term , and thus behave in exactly the same way as if it had been embedded in a de sitter background .",
    "now in a conformal theory particles can only acquire mass through some scalar field symmetry breaking procedure , and thus when particles propagate they can exchange energy and momentum with such fields .",
    "however , as we show in the appendix , even in the presence of such an exchange , circular orbits in galaxies are still of the geodesic form @xmath115^{1/2}$ ] that leads to equation ( [ e20 ] ) .",
    "equation ( [ e20 ] ) with its universal @xmath3 is thus our main theoretical result , and so we proceed now to apply it to galactic rotation curve data .",
    "since successful rotation curve fitting to an 11 galaxy sample was obtained in @xcite via the use of equation ( [ e16 ] ) , one would initially anticipate that even if the @xmath116 term in equation ( [ e20 ] ) were to be present in principle , in practice it would be too small to have any effect .",
    "however , the sample we study here is much larger ( 111 galaxies ) and it contains some galaxies whose data points extend to far larger distances from galactic centers than had been the case for the 11 galaxy sample originally studied in @xcite . as reported in @xcite , it is through fitting 21 such highly extended galaxies that we were able to uncover a role for the @xmath116 term and extract a value for @xmath117 given by @xmath118 . in the fitting to the full 111 galaxy sample",
    "we shall use this value for @xmath3 and the values for @xmath49 and @xmath88 as given above in equation ( [ e18 ] ) . for the fitting then there is just one free parameter per galaxy , namely the galactic mass to light ratio , and thus our fitting is highly constrained .    with the stars in galaxies lying within the optical disk region , to fully explore the rotation curves of galaxies one needs to study the hi gas spectra as it is only the gas in galaxies that extends well beyond the optical disk region .",
    "to get velocity measurements that are free of projection concerns one wants galaxies to be close to edge on along our line of sight , and to be able to model the gravitational contribution of the luminous disk one needs good disk photometry . given these criteria",
    "there is a now quite substantial number of galaxies for which one can do modeling , with the 111 galaxy set that we use being a large , very varied and representative sample that contains both high surface brightness ( hsb ) galaxies where both @xmath119 and @xmath120 are large , and low surface brightness galaxies with small @xmath120 and dwarf galaxies with small @xmath119 ( collectively referred to here as lsb galaxies since many small @xmath119 galaxies have small @xmath120 and vice versa ) .",
    "having this broad a variety of galaxies turns out to be very instructive since one of the most interesting aspects of equations ( [ e16 ] ) and ( [ e20 ] ) is that there are situations in which departures from the luminous newtonian prediction can be very pronounced .",
    "one situation is when @xmath119 is small , since then the net newtonian contribution can not compete with the fixed magnitude @xmath88 and @xmath3 terms .",
    "another situation is when the quantity @xmath121 is small .",
    "specifically , since the newtonian contribution in equation ( [ e5 ] ) ( the @xmath48 dependent @xmath122 term ) numerically peaks at around @xmath123 , the strength of the newtonian term at the peak will be set by the magnitude of @xmath124 , and when small will not be able to compete with the fixed magnitude @xmath88 and @xmath117 terms . since the linear term dominates over the quadratic one until the largest distances , in both small @xmath119 and/or small @xmath120 galaxies one should expect the rotation curves to start rising immediately , just as is systematically seen in the data sample .",
    "the case where the luminous newtonian contribution is not suppressed is in hsb galaxies , and here the falling newtonian contribution can compete with the rising linear term to give a region of approximate flatness before any rise could set in , again just as is systematically seen in the data . thus we see that the simple formula given in equation ( [ e20 ] ) directly captures the essence of the data , and as the fits show , the formula captures not just the qualitative trend but the actual quantitative numerical values of the velocities as well . finally , we note that for all galaxies the quadratic term will eventually take over , to then arrest the rising linear potential terms and cause all rotation velocities to ultimately fall . moreover , since @xmath125 can not go negative , beyond @xmath126 ( @xmath127 for @xmath128 ) there could no longer be any bound circular orbits , with galaxies thus having a natural way of terminating , and with the allowable sizes of galaxies being determined by an interplay between galaxies and the global structure of the universe .    for the actual fitting we have predominantly used galaxies that were studied in large surveys . in particular for the rotation curves we have used 18 galaxies from things : the hi nearby galaxy survey ( as detailed in table 1 ) , 30 galaxies from a study of the ursa major cluster of galaxies ( table 2 ) , 20 galaxies from a study of lsb galaxies , as augmented by an extended distance study of ugc 128 ( table 3 ) , 21 galaxies from a second study of lsb galaxies ( table 4 ) , and also included some 22 miscellaneous galaxies ( table 5 ) , with this last set containing many of the galaxies that played a significant historical role in establishing that there actually was a galactic missing mass problem in the first place .",
    "the sample we use contains all the 11 galaxies that were studied in @xcite ( ddo 154 , ddo 170 , ngc 1560 , ngc 3109 , ugc 2259 , ngc 6503 , ngc 2403 , ngc 3198 , ngc 2903 , ngc 7331 , and ngc 2841 ) , with a few of them having undergone significant updates since then .",
    "of the 111 galaxies in our sample , the 21 that extend the furthest in radial distance were reported in @xcite , and for completeness we also include them here . in order of increasing largest radial distance",
    "the 21 galaxies are ngc 3726 , ngc 3769 , ngc 4013 , ngc 3521 , ngc 2683 , ugc 1230 , ngc 3198 , ngc 5371 , ngc 2998 , ngc 5055 , ngc 5033 , ngc 801 , ngc 5907 , ngc 3992 , ngc 2841 , ugc 128 , ngc 5533 , ngc 6674 , ugc 6614 , ugc 2885 and malin 1 .    for the fits we have taken photometric luminosities , optical disk scale lengths and hi gas masses from refs .",
    "@xcite through @xcite .",
    "the values we use are listed in tables 1  5 . in the last column in each of these tables",
    "each set of four references gives the data sources for rotation velocities ( @xmath129 ) , luminosities ( @xmath130 ) , disk scale lengths ( @xmath56 ) and hi gas mass ( @xmath131 ) .",
    "as described in the appendix , for 11 of the galaxies ( ngc 801 , ngc 2998 , ngc 5033 , ngc 5055 , ngc 5371 , ngc 5533 , ngc 5907 , ngc 6674 , ugc 2885 , eso 1440040 and malin 1 ) , we have also included the contribution of a central spherical bulge . since hi gas distributions extend well beyond optical disk distributions , for simplicity we have modeled the gas profile in each galaxy as a single exponential disk with a scale length larger than that of its optical disk . and",
    "on finding little sensitivity to the actual gas scale lengths used ( since the gas makes only a small contribution to rotation velocities ) , for definiteness we took the ratio of gas scale length to optical disk scale length in each galaxy to be four . also we have multiplied the overall hi gas contribution by 1.4 to account for primordial helium .",
    "( when an hi gas mass was not available , the hi gas mass is listed as na in the tables . ) in the fits the gas contribution is never that significant .",
    "specifically , in the hsb galaxies the mass in stars is much greater than the mass in gas , while in the lsb galaxies , neither the gas nor the stars are able to compete with the universal @xmath88 and @xmath3 terms . in the fits we followed the discussion in @xcite and required that @xmath59 not be less than @xmath132 . in the tables",

    "the place in our theory where there is the most sensitivity to parameters is in the adopted distances to the individual galaxies , since the parameters @xmath49 , @xmath88 and @xmath3 that appear in equation ( [ e20 ] ) are given as absolute quantities . to establish a common baseline for determining adopted distances , for all the galaxies in our sample we have used the distances listed in the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) . in this database distances are obtained either via direct visual measurements ( typically cepheids or the tully - fisher relation ) or indirectly via redshift measurements . for the directly determined distances a world average mean value and its one standard deviation uncertainty are listed .",
    "the redshift - based determinations depend on how one models both the peculiar velocity with respect to the hubble flow of the milky way galaxy and the peculiar velocity of the galaxy of interest .",
    "five different such models are provided in the ned , and with each one giving a mean value and uncertainty , taken together the five determinations and their uncertainties provide a spread in values . for definitiveness , for redshift - based distance determinations we have opted to use the mean value associated with the galactocentric distance determination . for our entire set of 111 galaxies",
    "there was only a handful of 10 galaxies for which using the visually - determined mean or the redshift - determined galactocentric mean did not immediately give a reasonable fit .",
    "for ic 2574 , ngc 2403 , ngc 3621 , ngc 7793 and ngc 3109 we found it advantageous to use adopted distances up to one standard deviation above the ned mean , while for ngc 2841 , ddo 170 , ngc 5033 and ngc 5533 we allowed up to one standard deviation below the ned mean .",
    "( for ngc 2841 the adopted distance we used coincides with the one given by cepheid data alone , with tully - fisher based determinations yielding a somewhat higher value . ) for ngc 6674 we used the smallest allowed distance value within the redshift determined spread in values .",
    "thus for no less than 101 of the galaxies in our sample our theory captured the essence of the rotation curve data using the ned preferred distances as is . and",
    "moreover , despite the fact that the sensitivity to adopted distance is the most pronounced in the 21 large galaxy sample , for only four of them ( ngc 5033 , ngc 2841 , ngc 5533 and ngc 6674 ) did we even need to consider not using the ned mean values as is .",
    "the fact that our fits work so well at the ned distances is thus a noteworthy achievement for our theory . in the tables",
    "we have listed the specific adopted distances that we have used .    of the galaxies we fit , the data for",

    "and as such this galaxy actually provides the sternest test of our ideas .",
    "malin 1 is unusual in that its adopted distance is far larger than that of any other galaxy in our sample .",
    "in fact it is at such a high redshift ( @xmath134 ) that its luminosity and angular diameter distances differ quite significantly . for malin 1",
    "the ned gives a mean galactocentric luminosity distance @xmath135 mpc , with the angular diameter distance thus being given by @xmath136 mpc .",
    "the luminosity and hi gas masses quoted in table 5 were evaluated using this @xmath137 , and the radial distances and scale lengths were determined using @xmath138 , with the @xmath139 last data point then being at a mammoth @xmath140 kpc .",
    "the rotation curve data for malin 1 were originally observed in @xcite , and have recently been reanalyzed in @xcite . in part because of beam smearing correction considerations , the authors of @xcite have revised the inner region rotation curve of @xcite quite substantially , but are in reasonable agreement with @xcite in the outer region , the region that is of most interest to us here . for the fit to the galaxy we thus use the first four rotation curve data points given in @xcite , and the fifth point given in @xcite (",
    "as then adjusted to the @xmath141 inclination determined by @xcite ) .    in regard to some specific galaxies within our 111 galaxy sample , we should note that we have some difficulty fitting ngc 7793 , with the shape of its rotation curve not readily lending itself to fitting . since the hi data for this galaxy only go out to six optical disk scale lengths or so , the fits are very sensitive to any inner region structure that would not be modeled by a single exponential disk",
    ".    for the galaxy ngc 3109 we should note that we followed @xcite and scaled up the hi gas mass by a factor of 1.67 to allow for loss of flux in the original radio observations of the galaxy given in @xcite .",
    "even with this rescaling , at the one standard deviation ned distance of 1.5 mpc our fit still falls a little below the observed velocities at the largest radial distances .",
    "however , as noted in our earlier fit to this galaxy @xcite , the fit falls right on the data at the slightly larger adopted distance of 1.7 mpc .    for the galaxy ngc 4736",
    "the surface brightness profile was found @xcite to decompose into a two - disk structure , a small disk with scale length @xmath142 kpc that is operative in the inner @xmath143 kpc region where the first 13 of the 82 rotation curve data points reported in @xcite are located , together with a large disk with scale length @xmath144 kpc scale length that is operative in the region greater than @xmath145 . for simplicity",
    "we opted not to truncate either of the two disks so that we could use equation ( [ e5 ] ) as is for each of them . in the fitting the inner region disk",
    "was found to have a fitted mass @xmath146 , while the dominant primary disk was found to have a mass @xmath147 . in table 1",
    "the reported value for @xmath133 for this galaxy is the total stellar mass of the two disks combined divided by the total blue luminosity of the galaxy .",
    "the galaxy ngc 2976 is also reported to have a two - disk structure @xcite , with an effective @xmath148 kpc in the less than @xmath149 radial region and an effective @xmath150 kpc in the greater than @xmath149 radial region . with the rotation curve data of @xcite ending at @xmath151 , and with 28 of the reported 42 rotation curve data points lying in the less than @xmath149 region , for the fitting",
    "we have approximated the two disks by a single disk with a blended scale length @xmath152 kpc .",
    "the galaxy ngc 4826 is a highly unusual galaxy in which the inner 10 of the 89 rotation curve data points reported in @xcite are counter - rotating with respect to the outer 79 . with the two regions being well segregated ( the inner points lie within @xmath153 of the center of the galaxy while the outer region points lie beyond @xmath154 ) ,",
    "we provide a fit to the 79 outer region points alone .    for two of the galaxies in our sample ( ugc 5999 and f571 - 8 )",
    "we note that even though the fits themselves are reasonable , we find fitted mass to light ratios much larger than the upper bound of @xmath155 suggested by population synthesis models @xcite .",
    "the galaxy ugc 5999 has a reported inclination of @xmath156 .",
    "however , as noted in @xcite , since photometric data are not too sensitive to the inclination angle for close to face - on lsb galaxies , the data can permit a modest increase in the inclination to @xmath157 or so . with this latter value",
    "the rotation velocities are reduced by a factor of @xmath158 , with the fitted value for the mass to light ratio coming down to @xmath159 , and with the fit ( not shown ) even being improved .",
    "the galaxy f571 - 8 is close to edge on with an inclination close to @xmath160 , and while there is then little sensitivity to inclination , because the galaxy is edge on , there instead are uncertainties in the photometry due to optical depth and projection effects @xcite . for f571 - 8",
    "the rotation curve data only go out to 2.7 disk scale lengths and rise to a quite high value of @xmath161 . with",
    "the data being entirely in the inner optical disk region , given the large reported values for the velocities , a fitted disk mass as high as @xmath162 is to be expected .",
    "however for this galaxy the reported luminosity is only @xmath163 , to thus lead to a large mass to light ratio .",
    "there is thus a mismatch between the large reported inner region rotation velocities and the small reported luminosity .",
    "given the photometry uncertainties it is possible that for this galaxy the luminosity may have been underestimated .",
    "of the galaxies in the 21 large galaxy sample ( the region were we are maximally sensitive to distance determinations ) there were only three galaxies whose fitting we found challenging , viz .",
    "ngc 5533 , ngc 6674 and ugc 2885 , each a galaxy with a bulge . however , the fitting difficulties were mainly in the inner region where one has to make a bulge / disk decomposition of the luminosity , and not in the asymptotic region where the quadratic term contribution was still readily able to universally cancel the linear potential term contribution .",
    "since the ned determination of the adopted distance for ngc 5533 is given as @xmath164 to one standard deviation , we found that using @xmath165 mpc as the adopted distance gave the tightest fit .",
    "for ngc 6674 only a redshift - based adopted distance is available , and it lies in the range @xmath165 to @xmath166 mpc . for this galaxy",
    "the fitting again preferred the smallest adopted distance value . for ugc 2885 we found that the fitting could be improved if , as described in the appendix , we used a bulge scale length somewhat larger than the one reported in the literature .",
    "for ngc 5533 and ngc 6674 we recall @xcite that ngc 5533 has significant side - to - side asymmetries and kinematic evidence for a warp , while ngc 6674 has a large scale non - axisymmetric structure and a substantial inner region bar @xcite .",
    "consequently we should not anticipate being able to do more than fit the general trend for these two galaxies in the inner region .",
    "nonetheless , none of these inner region luminosity structure issues affect the outer region where all the various luminous components consolidate to produce one effective @xmath119 in the asymptotic equation ( [ e21 ] ) that then readily controls the outer region .    in figs .",
    "1 - 5 we present the rotational velocities with their quoted errors ( in @xmath167 ) for all of the galaxies in the 111 galaxy sample as plotted as functions of radial distances from galactic centers ( in @xmath168 ) . for each galaxy we have exhibited the contribution due to the luminous newtonian term alone ( dashed curve ) , the contribution from the two linear terms alone ( dot dashed curve ) , the contribution from the two linear terms and the quadratic terms combined ( dotted curve ) , with the full curve showing the total contribution . as we see , the tightly constrained equation ( [ e20 ] ) captures the essence of the data , and does so without needing any dark matter whatsoever .",
    "one of the most interesting aspects of the fits is that in the galaxies that go out to the largest radial distances the contribution of the linear potential ( dot dashed curve ) would actually lead to an overshoot of the data , but as the figures show this overshoot is completely arrested by the quadratic potential term ( dotted curve ) . since the quadratic term would eventually cause rotation velocities to fall , to illustrate the effect , for the very small ddo 154 and for the very large ugc 128 and malin 1 galaxies in fig .",
    "6 we plot the expectation of our model over an extended distance range .",
    "the anticipated ultimate fall in rotation velocities is thus a significant falsifiable diagnostic of the theory presented here , and intriguingly for the galaxy malin 1 the fall is expected to set in shortly beyond the current last data point . for ddo 154",
    "we note that there actually have been some suggestions of a possible fall in the literature .",
    "however , the small fall at the end of the rotation curve that had originally been reported in @xcite is not apparent in the more recent things survey of the galaxy",
    ". additionally , in @xcite it was suggested that there might be a fall in the rotation curve at distances beyond those currently available .",
    "( the authors are indebted to dr .",
    "m.  milgrom for alerting them to this reference . )",
    "however , the fall discussed in @xcite is thought to set in well before the one predicted here .",
    "of particular interest in the sample are the hsb galaxies ngc 3992 , ngc 3198 , ngc 2841 and ugc 2885 , all four of which were also in the 21 large galaxy sample . while ngc 3992 is part of the ursa major cluster study , its ned distance of 25.6 mpc puts it well beyond the 15.5 - 18.6 mpc distance range that the ursa major cluster is thought to lie within , and yet even at this much larger distance our theory is still able to accommodate it . both the ngc 3198 and ngc 2841 galaxies were in the 11 galaxy sample considered in @xcite , and the rotation curves shown here are of precisely the same shape as they had been previously",
    ". however , in the interim the adopted distances to both of these galaxies have been revised upwards by as much as 50 per cent . with the linear term contribution to @xmath125 being of the form @xmath169 ,",
    "it is extremely sensitive to distance determinations since @xmath88 is given in equation ( [ e18 ] ) as an absolute quantity .",
    "consequently , as the figures show , the linear potential terms would now be requiring the ngc 3198 and ngc 2841 rotation curves to rise .",
    "that no rise is seen is due entirely to the quadratic term , with the currently observed flatness of these rotation curves being due to a natural interplay of all the various terms involved .",
    "while the rotation curves of all of the galaxies in the sample are obtained from hi radio studies that extend beyond the optical disk region , the rotation curve of ugc 2885 had originally been obtained from hii optical studies @xcite that were thus restricted to the optical disk region where hot stars can ionize hydrogen gas .",
    "now even though the ugc 2885 hii rotation curve data were found to quickly rise to flat ( to thereby immediately suggest a missing mass problem ) , because the optical disk is highly extended , within the optical disk it is actually possible to fit the ugc 2885 hii rotation curve data using only the newtonian contributions of the luminous disk and bulge and visible hi gas , without the need to invoke dark matter or alternate gravity at all @xcite .",
    "such a fit would have to be a maximum disk fit in which the luminous disk @xmath119 is taken to be as large as it possibly can be in equation ( [ e5 ] ) , with optical disk region flatness thus not necessarily being an indicator of any failure of the luminous newtonian expectation .",
    "however , because the ugc 2885 optical disk region does go out so far ( not relatively in disk scale lengths but absolutely in kpc ) , the inner region rotation curve is sensitive to the linear and quadratic terms in equation ( [ e20 ] ) , and as is seen in our fit to ugc 2885 , they force the normalization of the newtonian disk term to be less than maximal .",
    "our work here thus supports the notion that the ugc 2885 optical disk region hii data do in fact serve as an indicator of the failure of the luminous newtonian expectation .    in total , our fits here and in @xcite are noteworthy in that the universal @xmath88 and @xmath3 terms have no dependence on individual galactic properties whatsoever and yet have to work in every single case .",
    "our fits are also noteworthy in that we have captured the essence of the rotation curve data even though we have imposed some rather strong constraints on the input parameters . for adopted distances in most cases",
    "we have used ned mean values .",
    "we have not used actual surface brightness distributions or actual gas profiles but have treated these distributions simply as exponentials . moreover , for the optical disk scale lengths we have mainly used those associated with the longest wavelength bands available , and have taken gas scale lengths to be four times disk scale lengths . additionally , we have not included the effects of a disk thickness or taken any galactic inclination angle uncertainties into consideration . on the theoretical side our fits are noteworthy in that equation ( [ e20 ] ) is not simply a phenomenological or empirical formula that was extracted solely from consideration of the systematics of galactic rotation curves .",
    "rather , equation ( [ e20 ] ) was explicitly derived from first principles in a fundamental , uniquely prescribed metric - based theory of gravity , namely conformal gravity . moreover , conformal gravity itself was not even advanced for the purposes of addressing the dark matter problem .",
    "rather , before it was known what its static , spherically symmetric solutions might even look like , it was advanced by one of us @xcite simply because it had a symmetry that could control the cosmological constant .",
    "our fitting is thus quite non - trivial .",
    "while beyond the scope of the present paper , we note that since the scale we find for @xmath3 is of order @xmath170 , our work potentially has some interesting implications for clusters of galaxies . for clusters one can make measurements using either interior or exterior probes .",
    "the interior probe involves measuring galaxy kinematics and x - ray kinematics , while the exterior probe involves measuring lensing by clusters . for the interior case",
    "we need to use equation ( [ e10 ] ) for points within the cluster , and for lensing we need to use equation ( [ e9 ] ) for points exterior to the cluster , and in both cases we need to include the global effect due to all of the other clusters in the universe .",
    "since previous applications of conformal gravity to clusters ( velocity dispersions @xcite , x - rays in clusters @xcite , and lensing @xcite ) did not include this global effect , studies of its possible impact on clusters and also on gamma ray bursters @xcite could be instructive .",
    "a second area of interest is the growth of inhomogeneities in conformal cosmology , to see if one can generate a theoretical expectation for the matter distributions @xmath171 and @xmath172 that appear in equations ( [ e2 ] ) and ( [ e9 ] ) .",
    "while a theory for inhomogeneity growth in conformal gravity is only in the initial stages of development with only tensor gravitational fluctuations having so far been studied @xcite , by providing a measurement of @xmath173 in this paper we have determined one of the moment integrals of the matter source @xmath172 .",
    "our paper will thus provide an immediate test for the theory of matter fluctuations once it is developed . an essential first step toward developing such a theory",
    "has recently been taken in @xcite , where it was noted that conformal cosmological perturbation theory has to be developed as a power series in planck s constant rather than as a power series in the gravitational coupling constant .",
    "one is able to make such a quantum - mechanical development since a realization of fourth - order derivative theories such as conformal gravity has recently been found in which the quantum theory is unitary and ghost free @xcite .",
    "another area where our theory could potentially be tested is in the behavior of satellite galaxies around primary galaxies .",
    "specifically , in the above we had noted that the interplay of the linear and quadratic potentials in equation ( [ e21 ] ) would lead to a cut - off in bound circular orbits at the point at which @xmath174 would vanish , with galaxies not being able to support bound circular orbits beyond this cut - off .",
    "nonetheless , as we show in the appendix , it is still possible for galaxies to support some trajectories beyond the cut - off , they just would not be circular . in a non - circular trajectory with energy @xmath175 and angular momentum @xmath176 the quantity @xmath177 would need to be positive .",
    "such trajectories are thus of relevance when the @xmath178 term is large , while the circular orbits occur when @xmath178 is small .",
    "a possible way to explore any such large @xmath179 switch over would be through the use of satellite galaxies as they are located well outside the primary galaxies . in making any such application one would have to allow for the fact that in the conformal theory the satellites themselves also put out linearly growing potentials , which would cause the satellite galaxies to interact with each other far more than they do in newtonian gravity where potentials fall with distance .",
    "the requirement of a switch over in the conformal theory conforms with the existence of a gap between the luminous material within each primary galaxy and the luminous material in its satellites . actually determining the specific way in which the switch over occurs could be quite instructive , and especially since there is no such switch over in the dark matter case , where , as noted for instance in @xcite , the extrapolation for newtonian dark matter halos is quite straightforward and smooth .",
    "( we are indebted to a referee to our paper for alerting us to the issue of satellite galaxies and to this reference . )",
    "it is also of interest to compare our work with some other alternative theories that have been proposed . of them ,",
    "two other non - dark - matter theories have also had success when applied to large samples of galaxies .",
    "one is the modified newtonian dynamics ( mond ) theory of milgrom @xcite , and the other is the metric skew tensor gravity ( mstg ) theory of moffat @xcite . in mond one modifies the connection between acceleration and force by setting @xmath180 where @xmath181 is the ordinary centripetal acceleration , @xmath182 is the standard newtonian gravitational force , and @xmath183 is the modification as defined in terms of some new universal parameter @xmath184 with the dimensions of acceleration .",
    "milgrom introduced this modification because of his empirical discovery that in all those cases where the standard newtonian theory needed dark matter , the measured centripetal accelerations were found to fall below a common value @xmath185 .",
    "through use of the simple expression @xmath186 for the function @xmath187 , milgrom was able to construct a function that interpolated between standard newton - kepler behavior at @xmath188 and departures from it in the @xmath189 mond regime where it led to asymptotically flat rotation velocities . in the years since milgrom first introduced mond",
    "many rotation curves of many different varieties of galaxy have been measured , and to a remarkable degree ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) they have been successfully fitted by equation ( [ e23 ] ) without the need to include any dark matter at all .    in moffat",
    "s mstg theory a skew - symmetric tensor field is coupled to einstein gravity , with the centripetal accelerations that result being given by the simple formula @xmath190\\right\\ } \\label{e24}\\ ] ] for a galaxy of mass @xmath191 . in applications of equation ( [ e24 ] )",
    "the parameters @xmath192 and @xmath16 are found to be given by @xmath193 and @xmath194 ; and together they combine with newton s constant @xmath195 to give a universal acceleration parameter @xmath196 . in equation ( [ e24 ] )",
    "the velocity obeys @xmath197 for @xmath198 and obeys @xmath199/r$ ] for @xmath200 , to thus be kepler in both limits , albeit with different effective newton constants . via equation ( [ e24 ] )",
    "successful fitting to a wide variety of galaxies has been obtained without dark matter @xcite .",
    "that conformal gravity , mond and mstg can all succeed in fitting the data is because not only does each one of them possess a universal ( i.e. galaxy independent ) parameter with the dimensions of an inverse length ( viz .",
    "@xmath201 for mond , @xmath202 for mstg , and @xmath1 for conformal gravity ) , the data do too .",
    "specifically , in the tables we have listed the value of the quantity @xmath203 at the last data point for each of the galaxies in the sample . as we see , despite the huge variation in luminosity and central surface brightness across the sample , within one order of magnitude all the @xmath203 values cluster around a value of @xmath204 or so .",
    "( in all the galaxies where @xmath205 is greater than @xmath206 , the luminous newtonian contribution is dominating @xmath207 , with those galaxies not being asymptotic enough to be in the region where the universal linear potential @xmath88 term would dominate . ) now different theories can not agree for ever , and since equations ( [ e20 ] ) , ( [ e22 ] ) and ( [ e24 ] ) predict differing behaviors at large @xmath179 , study of rotation curves at large enough @xmath179 could enable us to distinguish between them .",
    "as regards the near universality of @xmath203 , we should note that this is an empirical property of the raw data themselves .",
    "moreover , while there may be some uncertainties in the adopted distances to the galaxies , such uncertainties are never more than a factor of two or so . with the velocities being uncertain to no more than 10 to 20 per cent or so ,",
    "the near universality of @xmath203 is thus a genuine property of the data .",
    "it should thus be regarded as an important empirical clue for galactic dynamics .",
    "it is important to recognize that the fits provided by conformal gravity ( and likewise by mond and mstg ) are predictions .",
    "specifically , for all these theories the only input one needs is the optical and gas spectra , and the only free parameter is the @xmath59 ratio for each given galaxy , with rotation velocities then being determined .",
    "moreover , the @xmath59 ratios are highly constrained by the data in the inner rotation curve region where departures from the newtonian expectation are at their minimum , and as the tables show , they are all by and large found to be of order the mass to light ratio found in the local solar neighborhood , just as one would want .",
    "it is important to stress this point since dark matter fitting to galactic data works very differently .",
    "there one first needs to know the velocities so that one can then ascertain the needed amount of dark matter , i.e. in its current formulation dark matter is only a parametrization of the velocity discrepancies that are observed and is not a prediction of them .",
    "dark matter theory has yet to develop to the point where it is able to predict rotation velocities given a knowledge of the luminous distribution alone ( or explain the near universality found for @xmath203 ) .",
    "thus dark matter theories , and in particular those theories that produce dark matter halos in the early universe , are currently unable to make an a priori determination as to which halo is to go with which particular luminous matter distribution , and need to fine - tune halo parameters to luminous parameters galaxy by galaxy .",
    "( in the nfw cdm simulations @xcite for instance , one finds generic spherical halo profiles close in form to @xmath208 $ ] ( as then cut off at some @xmath209 ) , but with the halo parameters needing to be fixed galaxy by galaxy . )",
    "no such fine - tuning shortcomings appear in conformal gravity , and if standard gravity is to be the correct description of gravity , then a universal formula akin to the one given in equation ( [ e20 ] ) would need to be derived by dark matter theory .",
    "however , since our study establishes that global physics has an influence on local galactic motions , the invoking of dark matter in galaxies could potentially be nothing more than an attempt to describe global physics effects in purely local galactic terms .",
