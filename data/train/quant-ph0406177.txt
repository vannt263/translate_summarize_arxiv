    "there are two reasons to consider time ordering in kicked qubits .",
    "first , the behavior of a two - state quantum system interacting with a rapidly changing external field , i.e. a diabatically changing qubit , may be described analytically .",
    "while such solutions were examined some forty years ago in the context of landau - zener transitions in atomic and molecular reactions  @xcite , relatively little attention has been paid to this problem in the context of more recent work using two - state systems  @xcite ranging from quantum computing  @xcite to quantum control of atomic and molecular reactions  @xcite to manipulation of matter waves  @xcite , where this class of analytic solutions may be useful .",
    "the second reason is that time ordering has been used recently  @xcite to formulate an understanding of time correlation in multi - particle systems ( or , in the context of this paper , systems of interacting qubits ) .",
    "the central question here is how one particle ( or qubit ) is connected with other particles ( or qubits ) in the time domain .",
    "this problem has previously been formulated  @xcite using second order perturbation theory , where observable time correlations between different particles arise from time ordering of weak , external interactions in atomic scattering  @xcite .",
    "the kicked qubit gives us an opportunity to study the nature of time ordering for a simple , analytically tractable system in a strongly non - perturbative regime .    except for relatively simple @xmath0 phases , where the @xmath1 are simple eigenvalues of a time independent hamiltonian",
    ", there are only two ways in which time enters the time evolution of a quantum system .",
    "the first is through the explicit time dependence of an external interaction @xmath2 , and the second is through the constraint of time ordering imposed by the time dependent schrdinger equation itself .",
    "this time ordering , discussed below , imposes a causal - like constraint that places operators such as @xmath3 in order of increasing time .",
    "this confining condition interrelates the influence of the time parameters @xmath4 . in second order perturbation theory",
    "it has been shown  @xcite that the time ordering constraint has negligible effect if either @xmath2 or its variation with time is sufficiently small over the time of the experiment ( perturbative or constant potential limit ) or if the energy levels of the system before perturbation are all nearly the same ( degeneracy limit ) . in either case ,",
    "principal value contributions from energy fluctuations in short - lived intermediate states vanish  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we formulate the problem of time ordering in a non - perturbative two - state quantum system , i.e. a qubit .",
    "after describing the basic formalism in section  [ secbasic ] , in section  [ sectimeorder ] we define the limit without time ordering and show that time ordering disappears in either the constant potential limit or in the limit of degeneracy of the two unperturbed states , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 commute .",
    "we discuss the relationship between time ordering and the adiabatic approximation .",
    "analytic solutions for singly and multiply kicked qubits are presented in section  [ seckicked ] , with and without time ordering . in the case of a single kick ,",
    "we show how time ordering affects the transition probability from one state to another . in the subsequently discussed case of a double kick ,",
    "any transition is due entirely to time ordering effects .",
    "we discuss corrections for pulses of finite duration and in section  [ seccalc ] provide calculations illustrating our results .",
    "we present most calculations and some key formulas in both the schrdinger and intermediate ( or interaction ) pictures , and discuss some differences between time ordering effects in the two pictures .",

    "this is the way correlation , entanglement , and non - random processes are also defined  @xcite . in all of these cases",
    "it is useful to define carefully the limit without the effect ( time ordering , correlation , or non - randomness ) . in the case of time",
    "ordering we have seen that the limit without time correlation depends on how one separates @xmath15 into @xmath261 , i.e. what we call a choice of gauge . in practice",
    "this choice sometimes rests on the choice of the time averaged interaction .",

    "the problem is not new .    for clarity and simplicity we have chosen @xmath262 and @xmath263 in this paper .",
    "however other gauge choices are possible and in some cases may be more sensible . specifically , in many cases experimental conditions can lead to a sensible gauge choice where , for example , the asymptotic state of an unperturbed atom is an eigenstate of @xmath9 , and @xmath13 corresponds to an external electric or magnetic field imposed on the atom during part of the experiment .",
    "such a @xmath13 may sensibly contain @xmath11 and/or @xmath14 components .",
    "we have shown above that the limit of no time ordering depends on the picture ( representation ) used .",
    "while this difference is small when time ordering effects are small , the differences can be large otherwise .",
    "hence it might be argued that our time ordering analysis is useful primarily to determine if time ordering effects are small or large .",
    "this argument sometimes occurs in the use of correlation ( although it is not common to use different representations for correlation ) . in any case",
    "the dependence on representation is not new  @xcite .",
    "convergence properties of the magnus expansion in the schrdinger and interaction pictures have been known for some time to differ widely  @xcite . while the schrdinger picture result ( that in a sense corresponds to an especially simple gauge choice of @xmath264 ) is formally easier to write down , it often does not yield predictions as reliable as the more complete results found in the intermediate picture .",
    "we have illustrated this above with calculations and analysis of @xmath265 and @xmath266 for single and multiple pulses .",
    "the intermediate picture takes maximum advantage of knowledge about the eigenstates and spectrum of @xmath267 . in other words",

    "we have worked in the time domain and formulated the question of time ordering by explicitly working with the dyson time ordering operator , @xmath27 .",
    "equivalently one may work in the energy domain , as has been done recently in the context of atomic scattering to analyze experimental data and identify time ordering effects  @xcite .",
    "a key transformation for time ordering from the time domain to the energy domain is the fourier transform of the step function , namely , @xmath271 , where the effect of time ordering is associated with @xmath272 , which gives rise to the principal value term .",
    "the @xmath272 carries the effect of the boundary condition on the green s function in energy space .",
    "this is discussed in more detail elsewhere  @xcite . since @xmath273",
    "$ ] provides a connection between interactions at @xmath274 and @xmath275 , the quantum time propagator includes non - local effects in time .",
    "an example of a counter - intuitive time sequence occurs in stimulated raman adiabatic passage ( stirap ) , where efficient and robust population transfer is attained using two pulsed radiation fields in a three - level system  @xcite .",
    "the time ordering effects considered in this paper are associated with a sequential ordering of interactions .",
    "the normal boundary condition imposed on the evolution operator is that the sequence proceeds in the direction of increasing time ( or alternatively decreasing time to study time reversal ) .",
    "hence effects of time ordering are associated with a direction of the flow of time . in this paper",
