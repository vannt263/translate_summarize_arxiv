    "in a recent work @xcite , the current authors introduced a new growth model on the lattice @xmath0 @xmath1 which redistributes a given initial mass on @xmath0 onto a combinatorial free boundary .",
    "the growth rule asks vertices of @xmath4 lying in the interior of the visited sites of the model , and vertices on the boundary of the set of visited sites carrying mass larger than a prescribed threshold , to redistribute their entire mass evenly among their @xmath5 lattice neighbours .",
    "this procedure creates a sequence of non - decreasing domains that was shown to converge to , what we termed , _ boundary sandpile _ ( hereinafter * bs * for short ) .",
    "this local rule allows ( and in fact forces ) huge masses to accumulate on the free boundary of the moving front . in the case of a single source mass ,",
    "the numerics indicates that shapes generated by this model do not converge to a sphere under a scaling limit , but to a shape somewhat reminiscent of the classical abelian sandpile ( see @xcite for definition , and @xcite for the scaling limit ) .",
    "the initial motivation for bs was to find a sandpile dynamic that gives us the so - called quadrature surfaces ( qs ) ( see @xcite ) .",
    "a qs , for a given source @xmath6 is the boundary of a domain @xmath7 , that contains the support of @xmath6 , and has the property that the poincar balayage satisfies @xmath8 which is equivalent to @xmath9 for all @xmath10 harmonic on a neighbourhood of @xmath11 .",
    "our intention in this paper is to introduce a new sandpile dynamic that ( contrary to * bs * ) will correspond to a qs in its scaling limit .",
    "this would then parallel the theory of ( well - behaved ) divisible sandpiles ( * ds * ) , which redistributes an initial mass by putting a prescribed amount of mass at each visited site , and only moving out the excess from this prescribed amount . in * ds * the limit shapes , even for multi - source masses ( with some reasonable control over their distribution ) , have shown to be the so - called _ quadrature domains _ ( qd ) with prescribed density and given source ( see @xcite for the single source , @xcite for multi - source case , also @xcite and @xcite ) ; a well - established area in potential theory @xcite .    to establish a link between qs and sandpile dynamics ,",
    "we have chosen an approach based on singular perturbation theory for free boundary value problems ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this approach suggests that if one considers a slight perturbation of * ds * starting with total mass @xmath12 at the origin , by putting larger mass @xmath3 on @xmath13-sub - level sets of the odometer function , and letting @xmath14 tend to infinity as @xmath12 tends to infinity , then interesting shapes appear . by taking @xmath15",
    "we obtain a shape close to that of * bs * , and by letting @xmath3 be fixed ( but large ) we obtain spherical shapes , see figure [ fig - many ] .",
    "the question that arose was :    _ how fast / slow ( relative to @xmath12 ) should @xmath3 grow , in order to reach a desirable sandpile ? _    more precisely , we are interested in finding various functions @xmath16 , with @xmath17 , for which there is a new sandpile shape . when @xmath18 it is obvious that we are close to * bs * , and when @xmath19 , then we are having a * * ds**.    in this paper we show , using compactness arguments that there exists @xmath20 for which the sandpile shape converge to a sphere , and the entire mass is being uniformly distributed onto the boundary .",
    "this in general suggests that in analogy with constructing qd through * ds * , we can construct qs through sandpile dynamics too .",
    "( technical remark for experts ) in this paper , when studying the scaling limit of the model , we only consider the case of a single source , and leave out the general case .",
    "the reason for this is several infeasible technical difficulties at the moment .",
    "one major problem for the case of general initial source is the uniqueness question for the qs .",
    "this may still not be an issue , if we can show that scaling limits of our problem are unique ( as it was done in the case of abelian sandpile @xcite , for instance ) .",
    "it is however far from obvious , even for a two - point source ( see figure [ fig-2points ] for a numerical illustration ) , how such a uniqueness can be proven . in our case we have used the geometry of spheres to overcome this difficulty .",
    "on the other hand it will be apparent ( from what follows in this paper ) that we can prove that for each fixed @xmath3 subsequences of our model converge to solutions of a free boundary problem of the type @xmath21 where @xmath6 is the initial source , consisting of several point masses . a solution to this problem",
    "is not necessarily unique if @xmath6 is not a single point source .",
    "however , from free boundary technique we know that under certain good conditions ( which is satisfied at least for a two - source point ) the function @xmath22 converge ( for a subsequence ) to a function @xmath23 , as @xmath3 tends to infinity , where @xmath23 solves a free boundary problem of bernoulli type @xmath24 which amounts to a quadrature identity of type .    from here we want to deduce that by compactness we may consider a sequence of @xmath14 such that @xmath25 , as @xmath26 , in a way that we can achieve the quadrature identity for the limit scenario . for single source case",
    "the analysis heavily depends on the uniqueness and stability of the limit shape , that is unavailable for multi - source case .",
    "( to non - expert readers ) although it took a while to pull the right strings to get this result , we want to stress that the paper actually is using soft mathematics , coming from classical theory of free boundary problems , translated into the discrete language .",
    "hence we expect the reading to be easy .",
    "we need also to stress that the novelty of the paper lies in the model itself , and connections between free boundary problems and sandpile dynamics .",
    "this we believe might have some potential to grow in the near future and to give rise to an independent research area .",
    "there are indeed many free boundary problems on one side and several particle dynamic processes on the other side that seem to be defining the same model from different perspectives .",
    "attempts to bridge these models should be valuable and interesting .      before getting into the technical definitions and details , we fix some notation , and several basic facts which will be used throughout the text .",
    "let @xmath27 be fixed , and @xmath28 be a given function .",
    "its ( normalised ) @xmath29-laplacian is defined as @xmath30,\\ ] ] where @xmath31 means that @xmath32 are lattice neighbours , i.e. @xmath33 . when @xmath34 , we will simply write @xmath35 instead of @xmath36 .",
    "similar to the discrete laplace operator , one defines discrete derivatives .",
    "namely , for a unit vector @xmath37 , i.e. @xmath38 , the function @xmath39,\\ ] ] is the discrete derivative of @xmath40 in the direction @xmath41 at the point @xmath42 .",
    "it is well - known that as the lattice spacing tends to 0 , the discrete laplacian , and the discrete gradient converge to their continuous analogues , in a sense that for any @xmath43 one has @xmath44 , and @xmath45 uniformly in @xmath46 , where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are respectively the continuum laplace operator and derivative in the direction @xmath41 .",
    "we next recall the definition of the _ fundamental solution _ to @xmath49 in @xmath0 .",
    "namely , there exists a function @xmath50 such that @xmath51 for all @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the laplacian with respect to the @xmath54 variable , and @xmath55 is the characteristic function of @xmath56 .",
    "the existence and asymptotics of such @xmath57 are well - known ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) and we have @xmath58 where @xmath59 is a constant , and @xmath60 is the volume of the unit ball in @xmath46 .",
    "the operator @xmath49 also enjoys a maximum principle ( see for instance ( * ? ? ?",
    "* exercise 1.4.7 ) ) .",
    "* discrete maximum principle ( dmp ) : * let @xmath61 , @xmath62 be finite , and @xmath63 in the interior of @xmath64",
    ". then @xmath65 .    in this statement , and throughout the paper , the boundary of a non - empty set @xmath66 , denoted by @xmath67 , is the set of all @xmath68 for which there exists @xmath69 such that @xmath35 .",
    "we now give the formal definition of the sandpile process which is the focus of this paper . throughout the paper",
    "we will always assume that the dimension @xmath70 of the space is at least two .",
    "assume we have an initial distribution of mass @xmath71 @xmath1 , that is a non - negative bounded function of finite support on @xmath0 , and let @xmath72 be the total mass of the system , i.e. @xmath73 .",
    "fix also some threshold @xmath74 , and inductively define a triple @xmath75 for integer @xmath76 as follows .",
    "when @xmath77 set @xmath78 and @xmath79 ; we now define the passage from @xmath80 to @xmath81 . at a time",
    "@xmath80 call a particular site @xmath68 _ unstable _ if either of the following two ( mutually exclusive ) conditions hold :    * @xmath82 , * @xmath83 and @xmath84 .    for an unstable site @xmath54 we define an _ excess _ of mass denoted by @xmath85 and being equal to @xmath86 if @xmath54 is unstable according to ( a ) , and to @xmath87 , if ( b ) holds for @xmath54 . then",
    ", a _ toppling _ of an unstable site @xmath88 is the procedure of redistribution of the excess @xmath85 evenly among its @xmath5 lattice neighbours .",
    "thus , at each discrete time @xmath76 we identify an unstable site , say @xmath89 and topple it .",
    "then , we set @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath68 , and @xmath92 the process terminates if there are no unstable sites .",
    "it follows easily from the definition of the process , that for any @xmath93 we have @xmath94    let @xmath95 be any infinite toppling sequence , and @xmath96 and @xmath97 be the odometer , and mass distribution at time @xmath80 as defined above .",
    "obviously , for each fixed @xmath68 the sequence @xmath98 is non - decreasing , and hence there is a limit ( odometer ) @xmath99 , possibly infinite .",
    "moreover , if @xmath100 is finite at a given @xmath54 and its lattice neighbours , then passing to the limit in we see that @xmath87 is also convergent ; let @xmath101 be its limit in such case . with this notation , we fix the following :    [ defn - stable - seq](stabilizing sequence ) call a sequence @xmath102 stabilizing , if the limit odometer @xmath103 is finite everywhere on @xmath0 , and the final configuration @xmath104 is stable .    for convenience , we will allow a toppling sequence @xmath102 to include stable sites as well .",
    "thus , if a certain site @xmath54 included in @xmath102 is assigned to topple at time @xmath80 , but is stable , then toppling @xmath54 does not change anything .",
    "in other words the toppling procedure for stable vertices is idle , and the triple @xmath75 simply remains the same for time @xmath81 .",
    "* main results and organisation of the paper .",
    "* our main results concern general analysis in the discrete space @xmath0 of the singularly perturbed sandpile model defined in subsection [ sub - sec - model ] , and the existence of the scaling limit of the model generated from a single source .",
    "more precisely , in section [ sec - basic ] we show that the model is well - posed , in a sense that it reaches a stable configuration given that all unstable sites have been toppled infinitely many times ( proposition [ prop - terminate ] ) , moreover , this stable configuration does not depend on the order of topplings ( proposition [ prop - abelian ] ) .",
    "we then show that the odometer function is the smallest element in the class of all super - solutions to discrete pde problem associated with the sandpile ( lemma [ lem - odometer - is - u - star ] ) . specifying the analysis for initial distributions concentrated at a single point of @xmath0 ,",
    "we show that the odometer function is monotone in the lattice directions ( theorem [ thm - monotonicity ] ) .",
    "we then estimate the size of the annulus where the mass is concentrated ( lemma [ lem - size - of - mass - region ] ) , and of the region which is free of mass ( proposition [ prop - size - of - mass - free - region ] ) ( cf . figure [ fig - many ] ) . finally , we complete section [ sec - single - source ] by proving that the odometer is lipschitz regular uniformly with respect to threshold @xmath3 ( proposition [ prop - lip ] ) and is @xmath105 with norm depending linearly on @xmath3 ( proposition [ prop-1-step - c11-log ] ) .    in section",
    "[ sec - scaling - lim ] we show that the sandpile shapes generated by an initial distribution of the form @xmath106 and fixed threshold @xmath3 , converge to a ball under a scaling limit , as @xmath107 , moreover , the limiting odometer solves a singular perturbation problem with bernoulli type free boundary condition ( theorem [ thm - scaling - limit - fixed - m ] ) .",
    "we also prove , that there is a scaling limit for a subsequence of the sandpiles , as the mass threshold @xmath3 tends to infinity slowly with @xmath12 ( theorem [ thm - scaling - limit - inf - m ] ) .",
    "the appendix to the paper , proves a uniqueness result for solutions to singular perturbation problem with bernoulli type free boundary condition .",
    "this result is being used for establishing the existence of the scaling limit of the model .",
    "the aim of this section is to prove the well - posedness of the model ( in a sense to be made precise below ) , and to present some basic properties of it .",
    "it is not hard to realize that the process defined in subsection [ sub - sec - model ] will not stabilise after finitely many steps ( modulo the trivial cases ) .",
    "moreover , vertices in the set of visited sites may become unstable infinitely many times during the lifetime of the process .",
    "this , as in the case of bs @xcite , brings us to he following class of the toppling sequences , which leaves a chance for the process to reach a stable state .",
    "[ defn - infint - seq](infinitive sequence ) call a sequence @xmath108 infinitive ( on a set @xmath66 ) if any @xmath68 ( correspondingly @xmath69 ) appears in @xmath102 infinitely often .",

    "note , that @xmath12 and @xmath3 are not necessarily integers .",
    "the next two propositions show that any initial distribution can be stabilized uniquely by an infinitive toppling sequence .",
    "proofs follow closely to their corresponding results from our paper @xcite , without any additional difficulties , but we include some details here for the sake of completeness .",

    "* proposition 2.1 ) it will be enough to show that the set of visited sites @xmath111 stays bounded uniformly in @xmath80 , for which it suffices to obtain a uniform bound on the number of elements in @xmath112 ( see the scanning procedure by hyperplanes as described in ( * ? ? ?",

    "this means that at time @xmath80 , when @xmath123 , the 1-neighbourhood of @xmath54 has total mass at least @xmath124 .    for each @xmath68 let @xmath125 be a 1-box centred at @xmath54 ,",

    "this completes the induction . thereby ,",
    "to finish the proof of the proposition , we need to verify ( [ mu2-dist - vs - mu1k ] ) which we do next .",

    "next , if @xmath140 is set to topple because of ( b ) , then @xmath164 .",
    "but this means that @xmath89 had already toppled prior to time @xmath80 , and we let @xmath118 be the largest time before @xmath80 , when it has toppled ; in particular @xmath165 . applying the inductive hypothesis we arrive at @xmath166 from here , and the stability of @xmath163 we obtain @xmath167 , completing the proof of [ mu2-dist - vs - mu1k ] ) , and hence the proposition is proved .",
    "a simple consequence of the abelian property , is the following symmetry for a point mass concentrated at the origin .",
