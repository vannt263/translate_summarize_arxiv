    "discovery of superconductivity in layered materials or quasi - two - dimensional systems in the past several decades has brought up great interest in the physics of low dimensional superconductors . among those are the high @xmath4 cuprates,@xcite a ruthenate sr@xmath5ruo@xmath6,@xcite a cobaltate na@xmath7coo@xmath8 h@xmath5o,@xcite mgb@xmath5,@xcite a heavy electron system cecoin@xmath9,@xcite and organic conductors such as ( bedt - ttf)@xmath5x",
    "( x is an anion).@xcite    theoretically , it is well known by mermin - wagner s theorem that no off - diagonal long range order takes place at finite temperature in purely two - dimensional(2d ) systems.@xcite in the case of pure 2d , superconducting transition is expected to be of the kosterlitz - thouless ( kt ) type.@xcite the superconducting kt transition has previously been studied using finite temperature auxiliary field quantum monte carlo ( afqmc ) technique for the attractive hubbard model , that is , the hubbard model with a negative on - site @xmath10 , on a square lattice@xcite and on a triangular lattice.@xcite nowadays , a renewed interest for the kt transition on triangular lattices has arisen because unconventional superconductivity has been observed in materials having ( anisotropic ) triangular lattice structure such as na@xmath7coo@xmath8h@xmath5o and ( bedt - ttf)@xmath5x .    for the square lattice",
    ", it has been shown that the kt superconducting transition temperature @xmath11 , @xmath12 is the hopping integral , for square lattice with @xmath13 ( @xmath14 is the band filling ) away from the half filling @xmath15 , where charge density wave ( cdw ) ordering takes place.@xcite as for the triangular lattice , it has been concluded that @xmath16 takes its maximum at around half - filling due to the absence of cdw ordering , while @xmath16 is low near @xmath17,where",
    "the density of states becomes large due to the van hove singularity at @xmath18 .",
    "since previous studies have been restricted to small system sizes , here we revisit the problem of the superconducting kt transition of the attractive hubbard model on a triangular lattice using afqmc technique .",
    "combining three methods of analyzing the numerical data , we find that the kt transition temperature stays almost constant within the band filling region of @xmath19.our results suggest that the estimation of the kt transition temperature using finite size scaling requires some caution when the density of states near the fermi level is small and the calculation is restricted to small system sizes .",
    "the hamiltonian of the attractive hubbard model is given in standard notation as @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a fermion creation ( annihilation ) operator at site @xmath22 with spin @xmath23 , and @xmath24,@xmath25 denotes a pair of nearest neighbors on square or triangular lattice having periodic boundary condition.the chemical potential @xmath26 controls the band filling @xmath14 ( average number of electrons per site ) .",
    "the hopping parameter @xmath12 is taken as the unit of the energy and is set equal to unity throughout the study .",
    "as for the lattice structure , we mainly concentrate on the triangular lattice , but we also perform calculation on the square lattice at the band filling of @xmath13 in order to make comparison with previous studies and with the triangular lattice . the on - site attraction @xmath10 is fixed at @xmath27 on both lattices , which also enables us to make comparison with the previous studies .      above the superconducting kt transition temperature @xmath16",
    ", the on - site ( @xmath28-wave ) pairing correlation function decays exponentially , @xmath29    by contrast , the pairing correlation function exhibits a power - law decay @xmath30 where @xmath31 for @xmath32 . in the actual afqmc calculation",
    ", we calculate a summation of the pairing correlation function , @xmath33 , given as @xmath34 due to the decaying behavior of the pairing correlation function mentioned above , @xmath33 increases as @xmath35 is increased below @xmath16 , while it remains constant above @xmath16 .    in the present study ,",
    "finite temperature afqmc is used to calculate @xmath33 .",
    "@xcite the number of trotter decomposition slices @xmath36 is chosen to satisfy the condition @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) , so that @xmath39 is satisfied , where @xmath40 .",
    "@xmath41 monte carlo sweeps , depending on the temperature and system size , have been taken to assure sufficiently small statistical errors .",
    "we have performed calculation on system sizes from @xmath42 to @xmath43 sites .    in order to obtain @xmath16 from the afqmc data of @xmath33",
    ", we use three methods , two of which are based on finite size scaling , while the other one is a more straightforward method .",
    "as shown in eq.[eqrawcor ] , the pairing correlation decays as @xmath44 below @xmath16 for a large system size .",
    "hence @xmath33 is proportional to @xmath45 with system size @xmath46 . in a finite size system , scaling variable @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the correlation length , becomes more important.taking this into account , the scaling hypothesis assumes the following behavior for @xmath33 .",
    "@xmath49 where @xmath50 is a constant and @xmath51 is a certain scaling function . since @xmath52 for @xmath32 , @xmath53 regardless of the system size @xmath35 at @xmath54",
    "thus , if we plot @xmath55 as functions of @xmath56(or @xmath57 ) for different system sizes , they should coincide regardless of the system size at @xmath54 .",
    "@xcite    another method to identify @xmath16 is to plot @xmath55 as a function of @xmath47 , where @xmath16 and @xmath50 are chosen so that all the data points fall on a single curve ( namely @xmath58 ) regardless of the system size.@xcite    however , as we shall see in the following , these scaling methods eq.[eqfss ] turns out to suffer from finite size effects when the system size is small and/or the density of states at the fermi level is small . in fact , in the former method mentioned above , @xmath33 for small system sizes do not coincide with those for large system sizes even at @xmath54 . as for the latter method ,",
    "@xmath55 for small system sizes deviate from those for larger system sizes at low temperatures .    due to this problem , here we identify @xmath16 as the temperature at which @xmath33 for the largest two system sizes coincide in the former method , while in the latter method , we search the values for @xmath16 and @xmath50 so that as many data points as possible fall on a single curve , although the data for small system sizes deviate from the curve at low temperatures .",
    "since the scaling method suffers from finite size effects on some cases , we have adopted the third method , namely the extrapolation method .",
    "this method has been adopted for the study of the ( real ) superconducting transition temperature for the three dimensional attractive hubbard model.@xcite since @xmath33 should increase sharply at @xmath54 in the thermodynamic limit , it is reasonable to assume that @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the inflection point of @xmath61 for the @xmath35 site system .",
    "@xmath60 can be obtained by fitting @xmath61 by an appropriate function . in this study",
    "we use a gaussian form @xmath62+d_n$ ] as a fitting function , where @xmath63-@xmath64 are fitting parameters . here , we find that @xmath60 scales as @xmath65 in the range of @xmath35 considered in the present study .",
    "we may then obtain @xmath16 by plotting @xmath60 as a function of @xmath65 and linearly extrapolating it to the @xmath66 limit .",

    "we find for @xmath15 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 that the numerical results for @xmath72 , @xmath74 and @xmath0 fall on a single curve by adopting the @xmath16 obtained above and choosing appropriate values of @xmath50 .",

    "this may be because the discreteness of the energy levels due to the finite system size is small when the density of states is large .      in order to look into a possible correlation between @xmath16 and the density of states at the fermi level",
