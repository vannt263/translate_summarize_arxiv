    "opinion dynamics is one of the most investigated subfields of sociophysics @xcite .",
    "subjectively , there are at least two important reasons why physicists study this topic .",
    "the first motivation comes from social sciences and can be described as a temptation to build a bridge between the micro and macro levels in describing social systems . traditionally , there are two main disciplines that study social behavior - sociology and social psychology .",
    "although the subject of the study is the same for both disciplines , the usually taken approach is very different .",
    "sociologists study social systems from the level of the social group whereas social psychologists concentrate on the level of the individual @xcite . from the physicist s point of view",
    "this is similar to the relationship between thermodynamics and statistical physics .",
    "this analogy raises the challenge to describe and understand the collective behavior of social systems ( sociology ) from the level of interpersonal interactions ( social psychology ) .",
    "the second motivation to deal with opinion dynamics is related to the development of non - equilibrium statistical physics .",
    "models of opinion dynamics are often very interesting from the theoretical point of view @xcite .",
    "one of the best examples is the famous voter model or , the recently introduced , nonlinear @xmath0-voter model @xcite .",
    "both models are based on dichotomous opinions and belong to a wide class of binary - state dynamics @xcite .",
    "it should be stressed here , that binary opinions are natural from the social point of view , since dichotomous response format with 1 ( yes , true , agree ) and 0 ( no , false , disagree ) as response options is one of the most common in social experiments @xcite .    among many other binary opinion models @xcite , the @xmath0-voter model is not only interesting from theoretical point of view , but also justified from the social point of view . in short , within the @xmath0-voter model each individual interacts with a set of @xmath0 neighbors ( a @xmath0-lobby ) and if all @xmath0 neighbors share the same state ( i.e. the @xmath0-lobby is unanimous ) , the individual conforms to this state . as originally proposed , in the other case ( disagreement ) the individual changes its state with probability @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "however , in some later publications the model with @xmath4 was studied , as a natural generalization of the sznajd model @xcite .",
    "the unanimity rule can be justified based on social experiments .",
    "it has been observed in number of experiments that a small unanimous group may be more efficient than a much larger group with a non - unanimous majority @xcite . in a classical series of experiments on conformity",
    ", solomon asch has found that the presence of a social supporter reduced conformity dramatically ",
    "participants of the experiment were far more independent when they were opposed by a seven person majority and had a partner sharing the same opinion than when they were opposed by a three - person majority and did not have a partner @xcite .",
    "influence of a consistent minority on the responses of a majority has been reported by moscovici et al . @xcite .",
    "also recent neurological experiments suggest that unanimous opinions may be critical for normative influence @xcite .    from the physicist s point of view",
    "the @xmath0-voter model is interesting because of the rich behavior related to phase transitions @xcite as well as the controversy related to the exit probability of the model @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will focus on phase transitions driven by stochastic noise which  in the social context  may be interpreted as independence @xcite . in social psychology ,",
    "independence is recognized as one of the two types of nonconformity and means resisting influence @xcite .",
    "it has been noticed that independence plays a role similar to the temperature and introduces order - disorder phase transitions @xcite .",
    "interestingly , it has been shown that in the case of a complete graph , the phase transition changes its type from continuous to discontinuous for @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "up till now , the @xmath0-voter model has been studied on monoplex networks , i.e. networks that consist of only one level . however , as noted recently , interactions among individuals can be of qualitatively different nature and therefore modeled by multi - level networks @xcite . in the last two years",
    ", a lot of attention has been devoted to the analysis of various dynamics on multiplex networks , including diffusion processes @xcite , epidemic spreading @xcite and voter dynamics @xcite .",
    "brummitt et al .",
    "@xcite have generalized the threshold cascade model on complex networks @xcite . in @xcite",
    "they further expanded the model and introduced the idea of or and and nodes .",
    "an or node is activated as soon as a sufficiently large fraction of its neighbors are active in at least one level .",
    "an and node is activated only if in each and every layer a sufficiently large fraction of its neighbors are active",
    ". we will use a related notion of or and and types of social influence . without doubt",
    "most real - world social networks consist of many levels .",
    "for instance , a student may belong to a network of classmates , a network of sport - club teammates and a network of facebook friends .",
    "the question is if this multi - levelness is important for the macroscopic ( or global ) properties of the social system , such as public opinion , or not .",
    "we try to answer this question within the @xmath0-voter model that takes into account two types of response to social influence  conformity and independence .    the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we briefly recall the @xmath0-voter model on a single monoplex clique .",
    "we extend this framework to multiplex networks in sec .",
    "iii and propose three rules ( ` global&and ` , ` global&or ` and ` local&and ` ) . in sec .",
    "iv we derive rate equations , that describe the time evolution of the system , for each of the three rules . furthermore in sec .",
    "v , based on these equations , we derive phase diagrams and compare results obtained from analytical equations with those obtained from monte carlo simulations .",
    "the next section is devoted to a deeper analysis of the phase transitions .",
    "we wrap up the results and conclude in sec .",
    "the @xmath0-voter model with the stochastic noise , interpreted in the social context as independence , has been already analyzed on a monoplex complete graph @xcite . here ,",
    "following @xcite , we also consider a set of @xmath6 individuals , which are described by the binary variables @xmath7 ( spins up or down ) . at each elementary time",
    "step @xmath8 we randomly choose an @xmath9-th node ( i.e. a voter ) and a @xmath0-lobby , which is a randomly picked group of @xmath0 individuals . only if the @xmath0-lobby is self - consistent it can influence the voter . with probability @xmath10 the @xmath0-lobby ( if it is homogeneous ) acts on the state of the voter , which means that the voter changes state to the state of the @xmath0-lobby . with probability @xmath11 voter behaves independently  with equal probabilities flips to the opposite direction @xmath12 or keeps its original state @xmath13 .",
    "therefore only the following changes are possible : @xmath14    where a single - line arrow represents the state of a node belonging to the @xmath0-lobby while the state of the voter is marked with a double - line arrow .",
    "it has been shown that the system , described by the @xmath0-voter model with independence , undergoes the phase transition at @xmath15 .",
    "for @xmath16 the majority coexists with the minority opinion ( ordered state ) and for @xmath17 there is a status - quo ( disordered state ) @xcite .",
    "interestingly , it occurred that for @xmath18 the phase transition is continuous , whereas for @xmath19 becomes discontinuous .",
    "the most natural quantity that describes the macroscopic behavior of such a system is magnetization , which from the social point of view represents so called public opinion : @xmath20 moreover , in the case of a complete graph , the magnetization fully describes the state of system . in this paper",
    "we will calculate it in two ways  by monte carlo simulations of the microscopic system of the size @xmath6 and by numerical solution of the equation describing the time evolution of the average magnetization . in the case of the monte carlo simulations we will calculate ensemble average of the magnetization in the stationary state : @xmath21 where @xmath22 denotes the stationary value of the magnetization in @xmath9-th realization ( sample ) and @xmath23 . in this paper",
    "we average all monte carlo results over @xmath24 samples .",
    "let us start with defining a duplex clique , which is a particular case of a multiplex .",
    "specific definitions of multiplex networks have been introduced in @xcite .",
    "such systems consist of distinct levels ( layers ) and the interconnections between levels are only between a node and its counterpart in the other layer ( i.e. the same node ) . here",
    "we consider a duplex clique ( see fig .",
    "[ top_tak ] ) , i.e. a network that consists of two distinct levels ( layers ) , each of which is represented by a complete graph ( i.e. a clique ) of size @xmath6 .",
    "levels represent two different communities ( e.g. facebook and school class ) , but are composed of exactly the same people  each node possesses a counterpart node in the second level .",
    "such an assumption reflects the fact that we consider fully overlapping levels , being an idealistic scenario .",
    "we also assume that each node possesses the same state on each level , which means that the society consists of non - hypocritical individuals only .",
    "it is worth to stress the difference between a duplex clique and two inter - connected monoplex cliques ( see fig .",
    "[ top_nie ] ) , where the state of a node on one level is not directly related to the state of a node in the second layer . in inter - connected monoplex cliques the inter - clique links fulfill the same role as intra - clique edges .",
    "classical voter models were analyzed on inter - connected cliques in @xcite .    0.3 cm    0.3 cm    in this paper we investigate the @xmath0-voter model on a duplex clique .",
    "as in the case of the monoplex , we consider a set of @xmath6 individuals described by the binary variables @xmath7 , which are the same on both levels . on each level",
    "all individuals are connected with each other and therefore create a duplex clique , as shown in fig .",
    "[ top_tak ] .",
    ".three versions of dynamics on the multiplex clique .",
    "we do not consider the ` local&or ` rule because of the difficulty of such a concept related to social unreality and algorithmic ambiguity .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we consider two criteria of level dependence ",

    "criteria related to the status of independence : the ` global ` rule means that an agent is independent on both levels , but the ` local ` rule admits a situation where a person is independent in one clique but not in the other .",
    "criteria related to the peer pressure : the ` and ` dynamics is more restrictive and a node changes its state only if _ both levels _ suggest changes , in the ` or ` variant _ one level _ is enough to change the state of an individual .    finally we propose the following three rules :    a.   ` global&and `  global independence and the ` and ` rule ( see an example in fig .",
    "[ and_global_rule ] ) + with probability @xmath11 the voter is independent and with @xmath10 behaves like a conformist regardless of the level . in the case of independence",
    "the voter changes its state to the opposite one with probability @xmath25 ( we automatically change the state of the voter on both levels ) . in the case of conformity",
    "the voter changes its state only when both @xmath0-lobbies ( i.e. on the first and on the second level ) are homogeneous and both have the state opposite to the state of the voter .",
    "therefore only the following changes are possible : @xmath26 where a single - line arrow represents the state of a node belonging to the @xmath0-lobbies : arrows in the numerator represent states of the nodes belonging to the @xmath0-lobby chosen on first level and arrows in the denominator those on second level ; voter s state is marked by a double - line arrow .",
    "+ we should commend here , that the @xmath0-voter model with the ` global&and ` rule and @xmath27 on the duplex clique is equivalent to the @xmath0-voter on the monoplex clique with @xmath28 ( i.e. a monoplex clique with a @xmath0-lobby size twice as large as in the duplex case ) .",

    "[ and_local_rule ] ) .",
    "+ in this case the independence is related to the level , i.e .",
    "we run dynamics separately on each level .",
    "it means that a voter is independent on the first level with probability @xmath11 and with probability @xmath10 behaves as a conformist  it is under the influence of the @xmath0-lobby on this level .",
    "the same situation is on the second level , where regardless of the first level we choose if the voter behaves independently or conform the @xmath0-lobby on the second level .",

    "an order parameter , introduced to distinguish between two phases , is equal to @xmath66 in the completely ordered state , decreases as a function of the deviation from the order , and becomes zero in the disordered phase .",

    "furthermore , the ` and ` dynamics is more restrictive and a node changes its state only if _ both levels _ suggest changes , in the ` or ` variant _ one level _ is enough to change the state of an individual .",
    "for all three considered rules ( ` global&and ` , ` global&or ` and ` local&and ` ) , the system undergoes a continuous order - disorder phase transition at @xmath15 for @xmath95 and a discontinuous for @xmath94 , where @xmath70 and @xmath80 are rule - dependent .",
    "the ` global&and ` rule leads to a trivial result , identical with the monoplex case for a doubled value of @xmath0 .",
    "for the ` global&or ` dynamics , @xmath70 is larger than for the monoplex network .",
    "however , @xmath80 is identical with the monoplex case , i.e. @xmath96 .",
    "in contrast to the other two rules , we find a qualitative change for the ` local&and ` rule , as the phase transition becomes discontinuous for @xmath97 .",
    "the case of ` local ` independence is not only less trivial , but also more interesting and better justified from the social point of view . in particular",
    ", it has been shown that the level of conformity during face - to - face communication is significantly higher than during computer - mediated communication such as the internet @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the ` local&and ` rule is the most suitable for real social systems .",
    "certainly it could be further developed by introducing different values of noise on each level .",
    "the simplistic duplex clique topology , as introduced in this paper , can be also modified to obtain a more general network .",
    "for instance , one could consider partially overlapping cliques , where some nodes possess no counter - node on the second level . unfortunately",
    ", these modifications significantly complicate the model by introducing additional parameters and therefore are beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "however , even considering such a simple model as here , we can observe that a multiplex network can introduce significant differences in opinion dynamics .",
