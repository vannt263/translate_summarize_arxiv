    "many experiments are presently running worldwide and some have finished taking the data towards the study of hadronic structure .",
    "there has been an enormous interest to understand the partonic distribution and many models have been proposed to explain the hadronic properties theoretically .",
    "last two decades have been dedicated towards the study of generalized parton distributions ( gpds ) which contain 3-d structure information of the hadrons @xcite .",
    "several experiments , for example , h1 collaboration @xcite , zeus collaboration @xcite and fixed target experiments at hermes @xcite have completed taking data on deeply virtual compton scattering ( dvcs ) .",
    "experiments are also running at jlab , hall a and b @xcite and compass at cern @xcite to access the gpds .",
    "gpds have been classified into two types : the chiral even gpds where quark helicity does not flip ( @xmath0 ) and the chiral odd gpds which include the quark helicity flip ( @xmath1 ) . in a complete quark - parton model of the nucleon ,",
    "the quark density or unpolarized distribution @xmath2 is the probability to find a quark with momentum fraction @xmath3 in the parent nucleon without considering the orientation of the spin , @xmath4 measures the helicity of quark in the longitudinally polarized nucleon and @xmath5 is the number density of quarks having polarization parallel to the nucleon minus the quarks anti parallel to nucleon polarization .",
    "these quark distributions can be respectively obtained from @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "gpds depend on three variables @xmath8 , where @xmath3 is the fraction of momentum transferred , @xmath9 ( skewness ) gives the longitudinal momentum transfer and @xmath10 is the square of the momentum transfer in the process .",
    "however , it has to be realized that only two of these variables @xmath9 ( fully defined by detecting the scattered lepton @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the bjorken variable ) and @xmath10 ( fully defined by detecting either the recoil proton or meson ) are accessible experimentally .",
    "chiral even gpds allow us to access partonic configurations not only with a given longitudinal momentum fraction but also at a specific ( transverse ) location inside the hadron .",
    "in the forward limit they reduce to usual parton densities and when integrated over @xmath3 , they reduce to the form factors which are the non - forward matrix elements of the current operator and describe how the forward matrix element ( charge ) is distributed in position space .",
    "they can be related to the angular momentum carried by quarks inside the nucleon and the distribution of quarks can be described in the longitudinal direction as well as in the impact parameter space @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "fourier transform ( ft ) of the gpds w.r.t .",
    "transverse momentum transfer gives the distribution of partons in transverse position space @xcite .",
    "recently chiral even gpds from dvcs amplitude for non - zero skewness in longitudinal and impact parameter space have been studied @xcite . for the case of non - zero skewness",
    ", both longitudinal and transverse distribution of partons is obtained in the hadron @xcite whereas for the case of zero skewness , the momentum transfer is only in the transverse direction thus giving the transverse distribution of the partons .",
    "chiral even gpds encode the various properties of the hadrons for example electromagnetic form factors , gravitational form factors @xcite and also provide the detailed information upon the charge and magnetization densities @xcite .",
    "the chiral odd gpds , in the forward limit , reduce to transversity @xmath5 .",
    "when integrated over @xmath3 , the fundamental term @xmath13 has been studied in a self - consistent two - body model @xcite , basically for the quantum fluctuation of an electron at one - loop in qed .",
    "this term is of great interest as it provides valuable information about the correlation between the spin and orbital angular momentum of the quarks inside the nucleon .",
    "there is however no direct interpretation for @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "chiral odd gpds have been studied in the longitudinal and transverse position spaces @xcite where a field theory inspired model of spin- 1/2 system is considered .",
    "gpds have also been discussed in a simple version of mit bag model with an su(6 ) proton wavefunction @xcite and in light - front constituent quark models @xcite .",
    "in addition to this , relatively small number of studies have been done to study the nucleon spin densities which describe the quark distributions in the nucleon for unpolarized and polarized quarks in unpolarized and polarized nucleon .",
    "the nucleon spin densities have been studied in light - front constituent quark model where the first @xmath3-moments of spin densities have been obtained for the up and down quarks @xcite .",
    "lattice calculations regarding the lowest two @xmath3-moments of the transverse spin densities of the quarks in the nucleon have also been performed @xcite predicting that the boer - mulders function @xmath15 is large and negative for both the up and down quarks .",
    "this is based on the arguments given by the burkardt @xcite where transverse deformation of parton distribution has been discussed .",
    "recently , transverse distortion in impact parameter space has been studied in the light - cone model @xcite .",
    "spin densities in transverse plane and generalized quark distributions have been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite providing the relation between second leading twist t - odd quark transverse momentum distributions , the boer - mulders distribution function @xmath15 and a linear combination of gpds .    in the present work",
    ", we have studied the transversely polarized chiral odd gpds and the spin densities in the impact parameter space which are not so well known aspects of the nucleon structure .",
    "we have used the covariant model @xcite to evaluate the quark - proton helicity amplitudes .",
    "the formalism is based upon the dissociation of the initial proton into a quark and a fixed mass system ( diquark ) . to obtain the distinct predictions for the up and down quarks we have considered both the spin-0 ( scalar ) and spin-1 ( axial - vector ) configurations for the diquark @xcite .",
    "further , we have obtained the results for the fundamental term @xmath16 , linked with the transverse momentum distributions ( tmds ) and it s first moment providing the proton s transverse anomalous magnetic moment .",
    "we have also studied the spin densities for monopole , dipole and quadrupole contributions for different situations , for example , when the quarks and proton both are unpolarized , when the quarks are polarized but proton is unpolarized and finally when both the quarks and proton are polarized but in different directions .",

    "it corresponds to a two body process consisting of a struck quark and a diquark state . in order to obtain the explicit contributions from up and down quarks , we have considered both the scalar ( spin-0 ) and the axial - vector ( spin-1 ) configurations for the diquark . using the quark - proton helicity amplitudes",
    ", we have calculated the chiral odd gpds for the case of zero skewness when the momentum transfer is in the totally transverse direction .",
    "in addition to this , we have also studied the spin densities for the up and down quarks for monopole , dipole and quadrupole contributions for unpolarized and polarized quarks in unpolarized and polarized proton .    for the case when unpolarized quarks are present in the unpolarized proton the density distributions for the monopole @xmath83 and dipole @xmath115 terms are found to be larger for the up and down quarks and when we take the contributions from both the terms , the density distribution gets distorted in the plane .",
    "similarly , when we consider the monopole contributions for an unpolarized proton and the dipole contribution from a transversely polarized proton , the density distribution again gets distorted .",
    "we have also obtained the results for the polarized quarks in the polarized proton for the monopole @xmath107 and the quadrupole @xmath116 contributions . here",
    "again we find that the sign flip for the up and down quarks in the monopole and quadrupole contributions which is due to the different sign obtained for the @xmath89 and @xmath117 in the model .",
    "we have also considered the @xmath56-polarized quarks in the @xmath57-polarized proton and the spin distribution is rotated with respect to the results obtained for unpolarized quarks in unpolarized proton .",
    "the shift obtained here is however in the same direction which leads to the same sign of the magnetic moment of the up and down quarks .",
    "similar results are obtained for the case of quadrupole contributions .",
    "the spin densities provide a complete description of the spin structure of the nucleon and its relation with tmds could be tested in future experiments .    99 x. ji , phys .",
