    "the existing spectrophotometry available in computer - accessible form ( the stellar spectrophotometric atlas , gunn & stryker 1983 ; hereafter ssa ; the catalog of stellar spectrophotometry , adelman et al .",
    "1989 ; hereafter css ) tends to concentrate either on stars for stellar synthesis work , or stars of special interest ( e.g. , ap stars ; see adelman et al . ) .",
    "spectrophotometry of other stars also exists ( e.g. , breger , 1976 ; bohm - vitense & johnson 1977 ( hereafter bvj ) ; ardeberg & virefors 1980 ) , but these data are not yet in computer - readable format .",
    "even then , only the study of bvj explicitly tried to sample stars in nearby open clusters .",
    "a bit earlier than the bvj observations were taken , lee mcdonald and one of the authors ( db ) decided to obtain spectrophotometric data for a set of open cluster stars . during 19734 , 237 open cluster stars were observed using a scanning grating and a photomultiplier detector ; an instrument no longer in general use .",
    "any such observations today are likely obtained with ccd - based instrumentation .",
    "given the different detector systematics of photomultipliers and ccds , and given the resurgence of interest in obtaining accurate fluxed data on stars and galaxies with ccds , these kind of data are still of interest to many workers .",
    "of the 237 stars in our survey , only 25 stars are in common with previous studies .",
    "however , 236 stars have bv colors and 221 have uvby colors to which we can quantitatively compare our results .",
    "in addition , spectrophotometry of such a large set of open cluster stars with a range of age but otherwise similar metallicity is a good test for the kurucz ( 1992 , 1993 ) stellar synthesis models .",
    "the spectrophotometry for 237 stars , using 16 bandpasses from 36007800@xmath9 is presented in   [ sec2 ] .",
    "the seven open clusters observed are hyades ( hya ) , pleiades ( ple ) , alpha persei ( per ) , praesepe ( pra ) , coma berenices ( com ) , ic  4665 ( ic4 ) , and m39 .",
    "comparisons to published spectrophotometry are also given in ",
    "comparisons to johnson b  v and strmgren _ u",
    " v _ , _ v  y _ and _ u  b _ colors are made in   [ sec3 ] .",
    "the comparison to the models of kurucz is given in ",
    "we show that these comparsions reasonably lead to a quantitative means of assessing the accuracy of spectrophotometry on a star  by ",
    "star basis in   [ sec5 ] .",
    "our summary is given in ",
    "[ sec6 ] and individual stars of special interest are discussed in appendix  a.",
    "the observations of these open cluster stars were taken by lee mcdonald and david burstein during the period july 1973dec 1974 , with the wampler ( 1966 ) scanning spectrometer attached to the 0.9 m crossley telescope at lick observatory .",
    "table  1 lists the clusters observed in order of increasing age . parameters listed include galactic latitude ( b ) and longitude ( l ) , nominal distance and distances estimated here using a fiducial zero - age main sequence line ( d ) , the value of ( e(b - v ) ) used here , and estimated metallicity ( [ fe / h ] ) .",
    "table  2 gives the observing log , also noting the secondary standard star used for each night ( see discussion below ) .",
    "a one  channel itt fw130 photomultiplier coldbox was used every night except the first , when a two  channel coldbox was used instead .",
    "three filters were used to separate the first and second orders of the gratings , and an observation was made of each star in each filter .",
    "the effective wavelengths used for passbands per filter are : filter 1 ( 3500 , 3571 , 3636 , 4036 , 4167 , 4255 ) , filter 2 ( 4167 , 4255 , 4400 , 4565 , 4785 , 5000 , 5263 ) , and filter 3 ( 5263 , 5840 , 6300 , 6710 , 7100 , 7780 ) .",
    "each passband within a filter set was measured twice , with the starting wavelength measured a total of 4 times .",
    "note that three passbands ( 4167 , 4255 , and 5263 ) are observed in two separate filters .",
    "multi - observations of a given filter are averaged together .",
    "the passbands chosen are among the standard passbands of oke ( 1964 ) and hayes ( 1970 ) which give a fairly uniform distribution in @xmath10 . during 1973 ,",
    "all bandwidths for the observed passbands were 32@xmath2 . in 1974 ,",
    "the bandwidth for filters 1 and 2 ( as defined above ) were 48@xmath2 , while the bandwidth used for filter 3 was 64@xmath2 .",
    "object observations were interweaved with sky observations for all stars .",
    "hayes ( 1970 ) standard stars were also observed during most nights , sampling among all 12 hayes standards with emphasis on observing @xmath11 lyrae .",
    "at least 10,000 counts were accumulated at each passband for each star to obtain sufficient signal to noise .",
    "the first step in the data reduction ( done in 1974 ) was the interpolation of the sky measurements to the time of observation of a given star , which was never significant at @xmath81% in the final magnitudes .",
    "next , the observations for the hayes standard stars and the cluster stars for each night were reduced using standard mt .",
    "hamilton extinction coefficients provided by e. j. wampler .",
    "one star from each cluster was measured several times during a given night ( such stars are listed in table  2 as the `` secondary standard '' ) to internally standardize each cluster onto the same system .",
    "these stars were also used to determine any trend of atmospheric extinction different from the assumed coefficients during the night . only during night 3 was a deviation detected , affecting only the data for two stars ( per 285a , per 383 ) .",
    "in addition , we later discovered that two of the cluster secondary standard stars ( praesepe 300 and coma 60 ) are am stars , with one ( coma 60 ) suspected of being variable .",
    "fortunately , we can explicitly test if use of these stars has affected the calibration of these two clusters (   [ sec3 ] ) . to complete the standardization of the data , a smoothed energy distribution from the most - observed secondary standard star , hya 56 ( hd 27962 ) , was used as the fundamental standard for all cluster stars .",
    "lastly , each wavelength s flux was normalized with respect to its flux value at 5556",
    ". we will therefore often refer to our fluxes as spectrophotometric `` colors . ''    for the present paper these data are placed onto the spectrophotometry standard of the css .",
    "the data quoted in the css use a similar scanner - type system , and are standardized to the system of hayes & latham ( 1975 ) .",
    "of the eight stars in common , two are from pleiades , four stars from the hyades , and two ap stars from coma berenices . as the data in the css for these stars only extends to @xmath12",
    ", we assume that our data for longer wavelengths will require the same zero point correction as for neighboring shorter wavelengths .",
    "a systematic offset was indeed found between the 1974 reduction and the data of the css .",
    "this offset was easily quantified as being + 0.005 mag for the 13 passbands @xmath13 , and + 0.037 mag for the three passbands at 35003636@xmath2 .",
    "the sense of both offsets is that our 1974 reduction produced fluxes too bright in the hayes  latham ( 1975 ) sense .",
    "our zero point offsets are in the same sense as those known between the hayes ( 1970 ) and hayes  latham ( 1975 ) systems .",
    "the correction for passbands @xmath13 are consistent with that given by hayes and latham , while that for passbands in the uv are larger by about 0.02 mag .",
    "such an offset likely arises from differences in the true atmospheric extinction from that assumed .",
    "once corrected , the mutual scatter between our spectrophotometry and that of the css is @xmath14 mag ( 1@xmath15 per color ) averaged over all 15 colors , as seen in figure  1a .",
    "we adopt these corrections , so that our data are formally on the spectrophotometric system defined by hayes  latham .",
    "our comparison with the two other spectrophotometric catalogs , ssa and bvj , are done using our css - corrected data .",
    "we have three stars in common with the ssa : pra 114 , 154 and 276 .",
    "as can be seen in figure  1b , a color - by - color comparison yields relatively poor agreement , @xmath16 per observation for all three stars .",
    "there are systematic offsets between our data sets that tend to divide into wavelength regimes above and below @xmath17 .",
    "a comparison with the spectrophotometry of bvj is complicated by the fact that they calibrated their data to a different standard system than that of hayes & latham ( cf .",
    "discussion in bvj ) . as such ,",
    "we have compared our data with those of bvj as follows and summarized in table  3 : column ( 1 ) gives the color bandpass for 15 colors ( the 4400 color is not used ) .",
    "column ( 2 ) is the difference in adopted zero point , bvj - hayes ",
    "latham , calculated from the data given in table  2 of bvj .",
    "column ( 3 ) is the mean raw difference , us ",
    "bvj , with the error of the mean ( i.e. , @xmath18 ) for this raw difference given in column ( 4 ) .",
    "column ( 5 ) is the difference between column ( 3 ) and column ( 2 ) , giving the observed minus the predicted zero point offsets ( obs  pred ) between our data and that of bvj .",
    "for the three bandpasses below the balmer jump , the offset in obs ",
    "pred is + 0.0133 @xmath19 0.006 mag ( errors of the mean quoted ) ; while above the balmer jump it is -0.009 @xmath19 0.004 mag .",
    "overall the difference is only -0.005 @xmath20 mag .    the difference , star - by - star , _",
    "after _ the mean raw difference ( us  bvj ) has been removed from the comparison , is shown in figure  1c .",
    "comparison with figures  1a and 1b indicate that the scatter between our data that those of bvj is larger than that with the css data , but smaller than that of gunn & stryker .",
    "a star - by - star comparison between bvj and us indicates that most of the difference is systematic , cluster - by - cluster .",
    "for the three bandpasses below the balmer jump , the mean difference , us ",
    "bvj is -0.025 mag for 5 coma stars ( with one star having a difference of -0.050 mag ) , + 0.024 mag for 4 praesepe stars ( one star with + 0.061 , another + 0.041 ) , but less than 0.01 mag for 5 stars in hyades and 2 in pleiades .",
    "agreement is generally better for all clusters for the 12 bandpasses redward of the balmer jump , with typical differences of 0.010.02 mag , and no difference greater than -0.033 mag .",
    "two stars have been observed by three data sets : hya 95 by us , css and bvj ; and pra 154 by us , ssa and bvj .",
    "the three - way intercomparison is shown in figure  1d .",
    "the agreement among us , css and bvj for hya 95 is reassuring , showing scatter per observation of less than 0.01 mag .",
    "however , it is clear from comparing us vs. bvj and and bvj vs. ssa for pra 154 that none of the observations are in good agreement with the other , although bvj seem to agree a little better with ssa than us with bvj .",
    "why we agree better with css than bvj or ssa is not obvious .",
    "of the 8 stars in common with css , all are in the same clusters as used in comparing to bvj ( coma , hyades , pleiades ) .",
    "bvj observed some of their stars in common with us on more than one night , others just on one night ( as in the present survey ) .",
    "the `` usual '' suspects  errors in nightly extinction or nightly zero points , variable stars , just bad luck with random statistics  are likely , but not proven .",
    "fortunately , we have other means of assessing the accuracy of our data (   [ sec3 ] ,   [ sec4 ] ,   [ sec5 ] ) that include most of the stars in our sample . as a result",
    ", we defer a final discussion of the errors of our spectrophotometry until all comparisons are made .      the final calibrated spectral energy distributions ( seds ;",
    "relative to 5556 ) for all 237 stars are given in table  4 according to the cluster identification number and the night(s ) of the observation .",
    "the source of cluster identification number is given in the table notes .",
    "a colon is placed after values with _ a priori _ known estimated errors of @xmath210.030.06 mag ; an asterisk indicates errors @xmath8 0.06 mag ( which were usually interpolated from adjacent wavelengths ) .",
    "this table will also be made electronically available as described at the end of this paper .",
    "the simbad database was searched to obtain v magnitudes , ubvri colors , _ uvby _ colors and spectral types for the stars . from these data",
    "we construct up - to - date color  magnitude ( c  m ) diagrams for the stars in these clusters that are in our survey ( figures  2a  g ) .",
    "also plotted in the cluster c ",
    "m diagrams is the fiducial zero age main sequence ( zams ) from mihalas & binney ( 1981 ) , adjusted to match the least - evolved main sequence stars as well as possible .",
    "based on this adjustment , some of the distances given for the clusters in table  1 have been modified , as noted in that table .",
    "the zams is useful for identifying likely main sequence stars for the comparison with kurucz models (   [ sec4 ] ) , and for detecting spectral type misclassifications ( appendix a ) .",
    "the stars specifically identified in figure  2 will be discussed in appendix a and elsewhere in the paper ; stars used as secondary flux standards are noted with bold numbering .",
    "we initially assume that luminosities and spectral classes of stars are as given by the mk types from simbad .",
    "however , as can be seen in figure  2 , not all stars have mk classifications that correspond well to their position in the c  m diagram .",
    "we therefore modify our assumptions such that any star which could be sensibly defined as a main sequence star based on its position in the cluster c  m diagram was treated as such .",
    "separately , most of the clusters appear to have a binary star population as evidenced by the stars lying parallel to , but offset from the zams line .",
    "the spectrophotometry colors can be used to synthesize the filter colors of the strmgren _ uvby _ and johnson bv systems ( cf .",
    "breger 1976 ; adelman 1981 ) . for strmgren colors ,",
    "two adjacent bandpasses are averaged to achieve a closer approximation to the filter effective wavelength . in the case of the johnson",
    "bv filters , a convolution was made between these data and the b and v sensitivity functions ( s(@xmath22 ) ) defined by matthews & sandage ( 1963 ) such that :    @xmath23    f(@xmath22 ) represents the flux taken from the present data and the subscript of 1 indicates that the sensitivity functions with an airmass of 1 were used to determine the b - v color .",
    "table  6 list the observed b  v and _ uvby _ data as obtained from simbad , together with the differences ( observed minus predicted ) between the colors we predict from our spectrophotometry and the observed colors .",
    "we will find these color `` residuals '' quite valuable in assessing the accuracy of our data ( below and   [ sec5 ] ) .",
    "the tranformations between our spectrophotometry and the filter colors are given in table  5 , together with the results from a simple linear fit between predicted colors and observed colors . as all of our colors imply a magnitude difference of the given passband with the flux at 5556@xmath2 , the synthesized indices can be simply defined .",
    "seventeen stars do not have _ uvby _ data .",
    "seven stars were found to have significant residuals ( @xmath24 ) with respect to the _ uvby _ color fits : com  65 ( v  y ; u ",
    "b ) ; com  162 ( b  y ) ; com  183 ( v  y ; b ",
    "y ) ; ic4  83 ( b  y ) ; ic4  89 ( u  b ; b ",
    "y ) ; per  285a ( b  y ) and ple  2181 ( a known variable star ; v  y ; u ",
    "the color residuals for these stars are foot - noted in table  6 , and these colors are not used to defined the transformation between the spectrophotometry and the filter colors .",
    "the residuals , in the sense ( observed - predicted ) are given in figures  3a , b , c , d , with stars from the different clusters denoted by different symbols .",
    "all the comparisons have a slope near unity , with deviations of @xmath25 mag from linearity in the color range -0.35 to -0.50 with b  v and in the range of -0.25 to -0.50 with _ v - y_. such deviations are not surprising , given the avoidance of strong absorption features by the spectrophotometry bandpasses , and the known sensitivity of the filter indices in the wavelength region 40004900@xmath2 to changes in helium and hydrogen absorption in this temperature range .",
    "the fact that we see little deviation in linearity in the _ u  b _ comparison is a testament to the strong line blocking below the balmer jump which makes any filter in this wavelength range sensitive to absorption features .",
    "regarding the two clusters whose secondary stars are suspected variables , praesepe and coma berenices , we find that their stars follow the average filter  sed _ b  y _ correlation to 0.001 mag and -0.001 mag , respectively , with scatter of 0.015 and 0.017 mag ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "this is quite comparable to the zero points and scatter found for the other 5 clusters ( a range in zero point from -0.0004 to + 0.0027 and scatter from 0.010 to 0.018 mag ) .",
    "similarly , we find praesepe and coma berenices stars to follow the filter  sed _ u  b _ zero point to 0.004 to 0.01 mag , with scatter of 0.026 and 0.021 mag , respectively . again , this is comparable to what we find for the stars in the other 5 clusters ( zero points from 0.001 to -0.010 mag ; scatter from 0.017 to 0.031 mag ) .",
    "thus , we can find little evidence that the secondary standard stars varied sufficiently during the period of observation to differentially affect the seds of the stars in these clusters at a level we can detect .",
    "given the obvious non - linearity in the relation with _",
    "y _ and b  v , our preliminary estimate of the accuracy of our photometry from the filter comparison comes from the fits to _ u  b _ and _ b  y _ , which sample a comparable range in wavelength as the other two colors .",
    "as shown in table  5 , we get a ( @xmath26 ) scatter of 0.023 mag for _ u  b _ and 0.013 mag for _ b  y_. the implied scatter for our data ( 0.010.02 ) mag compares favorably with the estimate we get from comparing to the css , but is clearly smaller than our comparisons to bvj and the ssa .",
    "lines of @xmath27 mag are drawn in figure  3 to guide the eye relative to the scatter seen .",
    "the stellar synthesis models of kurucz ( e.g. , 1979 , 1992 , 1993 ) have been widely used over the years , especially as kurucz has strived to improve their relationship to real stellar spectra .",
    "for example , adelman ( 1981 ) used kurucz ( 1979 ) models to estimate temperatures and gravities for certain stars in the css .",
    "we believe that by comparing the models of kurucz ( 1993 ) to our data , we are making one of the more comprehensive comparisons of spectrophotometry between models and stars with a large range in temperature . as will be seen",
    ", we also benefit from this comparison , as the models give us an estimate of the accuracy of our spectrophotometry that is both more extensive and independent of the filter colors , and more comprehensive than intercomparisons with other observers (   [ sec2 ] ,   [ sec3 ] ) .",
    "we opt to explore only the variation of temperature with respect to the kurucz models for the stars in our sample for two reasons .",
    "first , the differences in [ fe / h ] from solar are at the 0.1 dex level for these clusters . second , likely gravity differences among upper main sequence stars of ages 301000 myr are generally less than 0.5 dex , at the resolution of the grid of models provided by kurucz . rather than interpolate among the kurucz models for relatively small gravity and metallicity differences ,",
    "we choose instead to explicitly test for evidence of such differences .",
    "we compare our data to kurucz models with [ fe / h ] = 0.00 , @xmath28 and a microturbulent velocity of 2 km sec@xmath29 .",
    "a spectral resolution of 32@xmath2 resolution was assumed for this comparison , as most of the data were taken with this resolution .",
    "we take into account the reddening of each cluster by appropriately reddening the kurucz models for the stars in each cluster , using the e(b  v ) values given in table  1 and a standard seaton ( 1979 ) reddening curve .",
    "we compare the kurucz models to all stars in our data which we classify as main sequence stars either based on their spectral classification or by their placement in the cluster c ",
    "m diagrams (   [ sec2.5 ] ) . the best ",
    "fit kurucz model to the data is chosen by comparing the full range of kurucz models with [ fe / h ] = 0.0 , log g = 4.0 and varying temperature .",
    "for each model comparison we calculate a least squares fit parameter @xmath30 , defined as @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the difference between our flux and that of kurucz only for the 13 passbands with @xmath33 ; i.e. , above the balmer jump . the minimum of this distribution for the residual sum is taken to be the appropriate temperature model . for this comparison",
    "we specifically exclude the 3 bluest spectrophotometric colors for the well - known reason that gravity and metallicity effects are far larger for colors defined by combining passbands above and below the balmer jump , relative to colors defined where both passbands are above the balmer jump .",
    "rather , based on the best fit to the model for the wavelengths above the balmer jump , two separate average residuals ( obs  model ) are calculated for each star ; one for the 13 `` red '' colors and one for the 3 `` blue '' colors .    in this process",
    "we do not _ a priori _ require that the mean ( obs  model ) residual for each cluster be exactly zero .",
    "rather , by letting this value float freely , we provide an extra check on the accuracy of our comparison .",
    "as expected , the average difference per cluster , ( obs  model ) for the 3 `` blue '' colors shows signficant scatter ( see also below ) . despite that scatter , significant zero point offsets ( at @xmath34 significance ) of -0.013 and -0.017 mag are found only for the hyades and praesepe clusters .",
    "since these clusters are the oldest in our sample , somewhat metal - enhanced ( table  1 ) , and with cooler stars whose seds are more affected by metallicity , such a small difference is not surprising given our use of solar metallicity models .",
    "interestingly , zero point differences at @xmath35 mag level are also seen for the average of 13  red colors for hyades , pleiades , coma berenices and ic  4665 stars .",
    "figures  4a  g show the seds for the main sequence stars in each cluster , grouped according to their best - fit kurucz temperature .",
    "for the most part , the stars of similar temperature have seds that match well ( indicating that the comparison worked ) , with the largest differences in the 35003636@xmath2 range , as expected .",
    "figure  5 shows the seds of the non - main sequence stars ( luminosity classes i , iii , and iv ) which were not explicitly compared to kurucz models , grouped according to sed .",
    "figures  6a , b graph the absolute v magnitudes of the stars in our sample ( using our predicted distances and reddenings ) versus the residuals ( observed  predicted ) for the fit of kurucz models to our data , with the known ( small ) zero point differences removed .",
    "figure  6a plots @xmath36 versus the blue color residuals ; figure  6b plots @xmath36 versus the red color residuals .",
    "note the difference in plotting scale used for the residuals in figure  6a versus that used in figure  6b .",
    "as would be expected , the scatter of the kurucz models versus the 13 red colors of our spectrophotometry show no residual dependence on absolute magnitudes , with an average scatter ( @xmath26 ) of 0.01 mag per star ( figure  6b ) .",
    "as equally expected , the scatter of the kurucz models versus the 3 uv colors shows highly systematic differences as a function of stellar absolute magnitudes .",
    "the most obvious effect is that gravity differences among the upper main sequence and subgiant stars strongly affect the uv residuals .",
    "this is to be expected .",
    "more interesting , perhaps , are the more subtle differences among the red color residuals for the lower main sequence stars . in the range @xmath37 are seven hyades stars that progressively deviate from the kurucz models with brighter magnitudes ( # s 38,45,53,68,80,94,103 ) .",
    "of these stars , two are known am stars , one is classfied as a subgiant ( ! ) , and the others are either f0v or f4v .",
    "it is possible that these small , but systematic differences are caused by increased line absorption symptomatic of the am phenomenon ( might this also be the source of the apparently mis - applied subgiant classification ? ) , rather than variability , as no similar variation is seen for the red colors of these stars .",
    "separately , stars fainter than @xmath38 in both hyades and coma show a somewhat wider spread in red residuals than do brighter main sequence stars in these two clusters .",
    "why this latter effect is so is not clear , as a gravity effect along should produce a net shift in the residuals , rather than a wider range .",
    "perhaps some of the stars are low mass - ratio binaries , which could effect the model comparsion only in the reddest colors ?",
    "the quantitative comparisons among our spectrophotometry , the css spectrophometry , the _ uvby _ and b  v colors , and the kurucz models all indicate an accuracy for our spectrophotometric colors of 0.01 - 0.02 mag , @xmath26 . yet , in quoting @xmath26 errors , we realize that in a data set as large as ours , @xmath39 , @xmath40 and even greater errors must exist if the distribution of errors is gaussian . as these data can be useful in accurately defining spectral energy distributions of bright stars for use in stellar population models and for calibrating ccd images ,",
    "it is highly desirable that the photometric accuracy for the sed of each star be known .",
    "fortunately , most of the stars in our sample have both",
    "_ ubvy _ colors and residuals from the kurucz models .",
    "suppose that the kurucz models define accurate spectral energy distributions for stars in the wavelength region we have sampled _ and _ the errors in the _ uvby _ filter colors are small and uncorrelated with our spectrophotometric errors . if both statements are true , if we plot the ( observed - filter ) residuals to the _ uvby _ colors ( @xmath41(color ) ) versus the ( observed - model ) residuals to the kurucz models ( @xmath41(model ) ) , these residuals should be strongly correlated .",
    "figure  7a shows the correlation of @xmath42 with @xmath41(blue model ) ; figure  7b the correlation of @xmath43 with @xmath41(red model ) .",
    "the term red model applies to the mean residuals for the 13 red colors ; similarly , the term blue model applies to the mean residuals for the 3 uv colors . in the case of the @xmath43 vs. @xmath41(red model ) a clear correlation exists . for 198 stars with ( b  y ) colors , kurucz model fits and not otherwise large color residuals",
    ", the correlation coefficient between @xmath43 and @xmath41(red model ) is 0.55 with a @xmath26 scatter of 0.011 mag .",
    "for the 132 stars with @xmath44 and with good predicted _ ( u  b ) _ colors , the correlation coefficient between @xmath42 and @xmath41(blue model ) is 0.298 with a @xmath26 scatter of 0.023 mag .",
    "the fact that we see significant correlations between the color residuals and the model residuals means that the above hypothesis is reasonably correct : in comparing to the filter colors and the kurucz models , we see mainly the errors in the spectrophotometric colors , while the errors in the filter colors and the models are much smaller than these . as a result",

    "inspection of the values of @xmath43 and @xmath41(red model ) in particular are useful in choosing stars from our sample with the most accurate spectrophotometry .",
    "the other color residuals and @xmath41(blue model ) are also somewhat useful in this regard as a cross - check .    given this conclusion , it is reasonable to interpret the scatter in the correlation of the residuals in figure  7 as due primarily to the errors in the spectrophotometric colors .",
    "this means that one can use the size of the color and kurucz residuals to reliably estimate the accuracy of the sed of each star , taking @xmath26 errors of 0.01 mag for the red colors , and 0.023 mag for the blue colors as the starting point .",
    "separately , we find these error estimates consistent with our estimated errors from our spectrophotometric comparison with css , but significantly smaller than our comparisons to ssa ( 0.046 mag ) and bvj ( up to 0.03 mag ) (   [ sec2.3 ] ) .",

    "in contrast , comparison to the published spectrophotometry of gunn & stryker ( 1983 ) and bohm - vitense & johnson ( 1977 ) indicates larger errors ( 0.03 - 0.045 mag ) .    the comparison to kurucz models",
    "was made for main sequence stars with values of log gravity and [ fe / h ] fixed at 4.0 and solar , repspectively .",
    "gravity differences and absorption line differences among the stars , more finely than can be measured with the standard kurucz grid , are seen when residuals ( obs minus model ) are separately tabulated for the 3 uv colors and the 13 red colors .",
    "while the residuals for the red colors show no net gravity effect , the uv colors show a strong gravity effect , as would be anticipated from colors that measure the strength of the balmer jump in b - f stars .",
    "we show that it is reasonable to assume that , compared to the spectophotometric errors , the errors in _ ( u ",
    "b ) _ , _ ( b  y ) _ and the kurucz models are small , so that the residuals @xmath42 are correlated with the kurucz uv residuals ( @xmath41(blue model ) ) , and the residuals @xmath43 are correlated with @xmath41(blue model ) .",
    "these residuals can be used to identify those stars for which the spectrophometric colors are the most reliable , and those which are less reliable .",
    "thus , while we quote @xmath26 accuracies for our data , we can also determine which stars have spectrophotometry within @xmath26 accuracy , @xmath39 , etc .",
