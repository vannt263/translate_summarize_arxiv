    "in the current studies of ultracold quantum gases , a great deal of interest has been drawn to the study of bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) loaded into optical lattices ( ols ) , i.e. , spatially periodic potentials induced by the interference between counterpropagating laser beams book1,book2,morsch06 . besides playing a crucial role in effectively tuning the interaction strength in the condensate ,",
    "i.e. , the ratio between the kinetic and interaction energies @xcite , ols offer an extremely useful tool for studies of the transition between the superfluid and mott - insulator states @xcite , and for the investigation of effects in the matter - wave dynamics due to the interplay between nonlinearity and the quasi - discreteness , which is induced by a deep lattice potential @xcite .",
    "the mean - field dynamics of the bec loaded into the ol is described by the cubic gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) with the periodic potential book1,book2,morsch06 .",
    "the respective bogoliubov s excitation spectrum features a band structure , similar to electronic bloch bands in solid state .",
    "if the ol potential is deep enough , the lowest - band dynamics may be approximated by the discrete nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation trombettoni01 . using this correspondence , the bec  dynamics",
    "was studied in the framework of the nonlinear - lattice theory , see works trombettoni01,abdullaev01,alfimov02 and short review @xcite .",
    "the presence of the ol gives raise to energetic and dynamical instabilities , which have been predicted theoretically wu01,smerzi02,konotop02,wu03,menotti03,taylor03,kramer03,kramer05 and studied experimentally @xcite .",
    "an important application of the ols is their use for the creation and stabilization of matter - wave solitons . in particular ,",
    "the periodic potential gives rise to localized gap solitons in the case of _ repulsive _ two - body interactions , as was predicted theoretically @xcite and demonstrated experimentally @xcite ( with the attractive interactions , bright matter - wave solitons were created and observed in condensates of @xmath0li @xcite and @xmath1rb weiman atoms ) .",
    "more generally , the use of time- and space - modulated fields acting on atoms is a powerful tool for the control of soliton properties @xcite ; for instance , while the gpe without external potentials admits stable soliton solutions only in the 1d geometry sulem99,ablowitz04 , ol potentials can stabilize solitons in any higher dimension @xcite .",
    "unlike 1d solitons , a necessary existence condition for their multidimensional counterparts , stabilized by means of ols , is that the soliton s norm must exceed a certain threshold value .",
    "another very useful tool frequently used in experiments with ultracold atomic gases is the control of the strength and sign of two - body interactions by means of an external magnetic field near the feshbach resonance @xcite .",
    "further , recent works proposed to exploit the possibility to control the strength of _ three - body _ interactions between atoms , independently from the control of the two - body collisions @xcite .",
    "one motivation for such studies is related to the possibility of creating new exotic strongly correlated phases in ultracold gases .",
    "indeed , quantum phases , such as topological ones or spin liquids , turn out to be ground - states of the hamiltonian including three- or multi - body - interaction terms , an example being fractional quantum - hall states described by pfaffian wave functions @xcite . in a recent work @xcite , a 1d bose gas with @xmath2-body attractive interactions was studied in the mean - field approximation , with the objective to create highly degenerate ground - states of hamiltonians including many - body terms . for the three - body interactions ( @xmath3 ) , the system is described by a _",
    "gpe , i.e. , the respective term in the energy density is proportional to @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the single - atom mean - field wave function ( in the general case , a similar term is proportional to @xmath6 ) .",
    "soliton solutions can be found for each @xmath2 , but they represent the stable ground - state , with negative energy ( which is defined as per eqs .",
    "( [ e - functional ] ) and ( [ h0 ] ) , see below ) , only for @xmath7 , being unstable excited states with positive energy at @xmath8 . for @xmath3 ,",
    "soliton solutions are 1d counterparts of the well - known townes solitons @xcite , which play the role of the separatrix between collapsing and decaying localized states .",
    "the townes - like solitons with fixed norm ( which is @xmath9 , in the notation adopted below ) exist only at a single critical value of the interaction strength , at which they feature the infinite degeneracy fersino08 : _ all _ the solitonic wave functions , @xmath10 ^{-1/2}$ ] , with arbitrary width @xmath11 ( see eqs .",
    "( [ critical - value ] ) and ( quintic-1 ) below ) , have _ zero energy _ but different values of the chemical potential , @xmath12 .",
    "a relevant issue is how this infinite degeneracy is lifted by an external potential , especially by a periodic one corresponding to the ol @xcite .",
    "when the two - body interaction is present , the mean - field equation is the gpe with the cubic - quintic ( cq ) nonlinearity @xcite .",
    "as said above , it has been shown @xcite that it is possible to tune the strength of the two - body interactions independently from the three - body ones .",
    "in addition to that , in the framework of the effective gpe for the bec loaded into a nearly 1d (  cigar - shaped \" ) trap with tight transverse confinement , an effective attractive quintic term appears , in the absence of any three - atom interactions , as a manifestation of the residual deviation from the one - dimensionality @xcite . in any case",
    ", if the two - body interaction is repulsive while its three - body counterpart is attractive , soliton solutions to the cq gpe can be found in an exact analytical form ( in the free space ) , but they feature an unstable eigenvalue in the bogoliubov - de gennes spectrum of small perturbations around them @xcite , while the instability of the townes - like solitons in the quintic equation is subexponential , being accounted for by a zero eigenvalue .",
    "the issue we address in this paper is the possibility to stabilize such solitons by means of the ol potential .",
    "previously , the stabilization of originally unstable solitons by means of the ol was considered , in the 2d @xcite and 1d @xcite settings alike , only for localized states of the townes type ( recently , the stabilization of 2d solitons against the _ supercritical collapse _ by the ol was also demonstrated in the cq model in 2d , with both cubic and quintic terms being attractive @xcite ) .",
    "it was found that the ol with any value of its strength ( i.e. , with zero threshold ) opens a _ stability window _ around the critical point corresponding to the townes solitons . in this work ,",
    "we demonstrate that the ol opens a stability window for solitons in the cq model ( with the repulsive cubic and attractive quintic terms ) too , but only if the lattice strength exceeds a _ finite _ threshold value .",
    "apart from the context of bec , where the nonlinearity degree is related to the number of atoms simultaneously involved in the contact interaction , nls equations with the power - law and cq nonlinearities are also known as spatial - domain models of the light propagation in self - focusing media kivshar03 ( for a brief overview of optical models based on the cq - nls equation , including references to experimental realizations , see recent works @xcite ) . in the case of the cubic nonlinearity ( the kerr medium ) , effects of imprinted lattices on the transmission of light beams have been investigated both in local @xcite and nonlocal @xcite models .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section",
    "ii , we introduce the cq gpe corresponding to the mean - field description of the 1d bose gas with two - body repulsive and three - body attractive interactions .",
    "properties of the ( unstable ) soliton solutions to this equation are also recapitulated in section ii . in section iii",
    ", we use the variational approximation ( va ) ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) to discuss effects of the ol on the solitons .",
    "we introduce an appropriate ansatz and compute the corresponding energy .",
    "the limit of the vanishing two - body interaction is considered too and compared to previous results @xcite . in section iv , the stability region for the soliton solution in the presence of the repulsive two - body interaction and ol is determined and compared with numerical findings .",
    "the effect of an additional harmonic - trap potential is studied in section v , showing that the stability region depends on the matching between minima of the periodic potential and the location of the minimum of the harmonic trap . in section",
    "vi we present our conclusions .",
