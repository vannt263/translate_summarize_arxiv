    "we often regard the quantum state of a field on the space - time as being a pure state that has the zero von neumann entropy . of course",
    ", this does not imply that an observer always has a perfect knowledge of the quantum field .",
    "rather , each observer would not be able to distinguish it from a certain mixed state , and the identified mixed state would in general depend on the observer s trajectory and",
    "the measuring means available .",
    "thus , each observer has his own nonzero von neumann entropy for the quantum states of the field .",
    "for example , let us consider an observer with a finite lifetime whose world - line is a timelike segment in the space - time bounded by future and past end points , and the measurements of the quantum field by him in terms of an apparatus located at each space - time point .",
    "when this observer sends a command to a remote measuring apparatus , the apparatus immediately performs a measurement of the quantum field on the corresponding space - time point and the result is returned to the observer . if this is the only way for the observer to measure the quantum state of the field , the set of points from which the observer can get the information is the intersection of the chronological future and the chronological past of the observer s world - line , which we call , for obvious reasons , the `` diamond region '' associated with the observer .",
    "the limitation of the observed region would cause the loss of the information on the quantum state of the field .",
    "this can be heuristically understood from general considerations as follows .    in general ,",
    "a quantum measurement can be reduced to the evaluation of the expectation value of a non - negative self - adjoint operator belonging to a @xmath0-algebra @xmath1 . in the quantum field theory ,",
    "the corresponding @xmath0-algebra @xmath1 might be regarded as the von neumann algebra @xmath2 constructed from the field operators on the space - time @xmath3 .",
    "( though the polynomial @xmath4-algebra generated by field operators is not a von neumann algebra , for the field operators are unbounded , one can define a von neumann algebra @xmath5 constructed from field operators on the open submanifold @xmath6 of @xmath3 , if @xmath6 is @xmath3 itself , a diamond region , a so - called rindler wedge , or their image under a poincar transformation  @xcite .",
    "more precisely , the von neumann algebra @xmath5 is the double commutant of the @xmath0-algebra generated by the projection operators composing the field operators smeared by test functions with support in @xmath6 . )",
    "however , not all the projection operators in @xmath2 are available for every observer . rather , the available projection operators , or more generally non - negative self - adjoint operators , generate a proper von neumann subalgebra of @xmath2 , which would be regarded as the algebra of physical quantities for the observer .",
    "for an observer with a finite lifetime , the corresponding von neumann subalgebra of physical quantities would be @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the diamond region associated with the observer .",
    "on the other hand , a quantum state @xmath7 on a @xmath0-algebra @xmath1 is a pure state if and only if the gns representation of @xmath1 associated with the quantum state @xmath8 is irreducible .",
    "however , the gns representation of its @xmath0-subalgebra @xmath9 associated with the restriction of @xmath8 to @xmath9 is not always irreducible .",
    "if it is reducible , the quantum state @xmath8 is indistinguishable from a certain mixed state in terms of any quantum measurements solely of the operators in @xmath9 .    hence , an observer with a finite lifetime would perceive a certain mixed state .",
    "then , how does the vacuum state in the minkowski space - time look like for the observer with the finite lifetime ?    in the case of the conformally invariant hermitian scalar field , martinetti and rovelli  @xcite conclude that such an observer will see a certain thermal state .",
    "their reasoning is based on the conformal invariance of the vacuum state and the conformal equivalence between the diamond region and the rindler wedge .",
    "the outline of their argument is as follows .",
    "let @xmath10 be the rindler wedge , which is the open submanifold of the @xmath11-dimensional minkowski space - time @xmath12 specified by @xmath13 in terms of the standard time coordinate @xmath14 and one of the standard spatial coordinates @xmath15 in the minkowski space - time .",
    "the rindler wedge @xmath10 is globally static in the sense that the lorentz boost generated by the killing vector field @xmath16 acts isometrically on @xmath10 .",
    "a uniformly accelerated observer following an orbit of the lorentz boost in the poincar invariant vacuum state would find himself apparently in a thermal bath with the temperature proportional to the proper acceleration .",
    "this is well known as the unruh effect  @xcite .",
    "one of rigorous explanations of the unruh effect is given by the bisognano - wichmann theorem  @xcite .",
    "this theorem shows that the von neumann algebra @xmath17 gives in an essential way an example of the application of the tomita - takesaki modular theory  @xcite of operator algebras .",
    "according to the tomita s fundamental theorem in the modular theory , given a von neumann algebra @xmath1 acting on a hilbert space @xmath18 , and a cyclic and separating vector @xmath19 , there uniquely exists the one - parameter group of automorphism @xmath20 acting on @xmath1 , which is called the modular flow .",
    "furthermore , the modular flow is subject to the kubo - martin - schwinger ( kms ) condition with respect to the vector state corresponding to @xmath21 , which means that @xmath21 is identified with a thermal state .",
    "the bisognano - wichmann theorem states that in the case of @xmath22 , @xmath21 corresponds to the poincar invariant vacuum , and hence the vacuum is subject to the kms condition , where the generator of the lorentz boost plays a role of the hamiltonian .",
    "thus , the modular flow here can be seen as the geometric flow generating the time translation in @xmath10 .    a relativistic quantum field in the minkowski space - time",
    "is often assumed to transform covariantly under the poincar group  @xcite .",
    "if we further require the covariance under the conformal group , and the conformal invariance of the vacuum state , we can , in a sense , map the geometric modular flow in the rindler wedge @xmath10 to that in the conformal image of @xmath10 .",
    "( though in the case of @xmath23 , there is no vacuum state invariant under the conformal group , it is sufficient to consider a state invariant under the projective conformal group , which is the subgroup generated by the dilatations , the special conformal transformations and the poincar transformations . )    in fact , hislop and longo show that for the quantum field in the diamond region @xmath6 , the conformally invariant vacuum is subject to the kms condition  @xcite , which relies on the conformal equivalence between the rindler wedge and the diamond region .",
    "martinetti and rovelli interpret the modular flow as determining the `` thermal time '' in @xmath6 , and this leads to the notion of the `` diamond temperature '' which is the proper temperature for the observer following the modular flow  @xcite .",
    "the relevant observer in @xmath6 is the inertial observer or the uniformly accelerated observer with the finite lifetime .",
    "a remarkable point here is that even an inertial observer may perceive a nonzero temperature .",
    "another feature of the diamond temperature is that it in general diverges around the future and past end points of the observer s world - line .",
    "it is not clear whether the behavior of the diamond temperature as above is universal one or whether it is peculiar to the operator - algebraic method .",
    "hence , we would like to verify the diamond temperature in terms of the standard method  @xcite via the determination of the bogoliubov transformation between different fock representations .",
    "we will see that it gives the same temperature as that derived by martinetti and rovelli .",
    "then , we discuss the thermodynamic quantities such as the casimir energy and the quantum entanglement entropy for the observer with a finite lifetime based on the standard quantum field theory .",
    "we further introduce the probability density function naturally determined by the modular flow in the diamond region , and attempt to give the information - theoretic interpretation of the entropy of the diamond region .    in this paper , we consider the free massless hermitian scalar field in the @xmath24-dimensional minkowski space - time @xmath3 , which transforms covariantly under the projective conformal group .",
    "we use the natural unit system in which @xmath25 .",
    "the diamond region @xmath6 is specified by @xmath26 with a length parameter @xmath27 , when the lorentzian metric is written as @xmath28 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : diamond ] ) .     of the minkowski space - time",
    "is depicted .",
    "the solid curve denotes constant @xmath29 and the dashed curve represents constant @xmath30 [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : tx ] ) ] . ]",
    "the modular flow in @xmath6 coincides with the geometric flow generated by the conformal killing vector field , which is timelike in @xmath6 .",
    "this conformal killing vector field naturally defines the positive frequency modes of the hermitian scalar field for observers following the modular flow .",
    "in fact , we define the positive frequency modes as the conformal image of the positive frequency solutions defined on the rindler wedge @xmath10 , under the conformal diffeomorphism : @xmath31 , which pushes forward the timelike killing vector field in @xmath10 to the conformal killing vector field in @xmath6 .",
    "more precisely , if the lorentzian metric @xmath32 in @xmath6 is conformally equivalent to the lorentzian metric @xmath33 in @xmath10 as @xmath34 , and @xmath35 is the timelike killing vector field with respect to @xmath33 , then @xmath35 is the conformal killing vector field with respect to @xmath32 .",
    "the positive frequency mode @xmath36 in @xmath6 is required to satisfy the eigenvalue equation on @xmath6 @xmath37 for @xmath38 .",
    "the null coordinates @xmath39 covering @xmath6 are defined by @xmath40 where @xmath41 are the minkowski null coordinates .",
    "then , the positive frequency modes in @xmath6 are subject to @xmath42 therefore , the positive frequency mode in @xmath6 consists of @xmath43 for the later convenience , we introduce the mode functions @xmath44 as extension of @xmath45 to @xmath3 , where we call @xmath46 the ingoing mode , and @xmath47 the outgoing mode , and these mode functions are normalized with respect to the klein - gordon inner product .    on the other hand , by continuing analytically the positive frequency modes @xmath45 to @xmath3 , we obtain @xmath48 where the null coordinates @xmath49 are defined by @xmath50 for the regions : @xmath51 .",
    "although there are two options to extend @xmath45 to @xmath51 corresponding to the double signs in the relation @xmath52 , we remove this ambiguity by requiring that @xmath53 correspond to the positive frequency modes with respect to the poincar invariant vacuum .",
    "the positive frequency modes complement to @xmath54 are determined as @xmath55 where we set the sign in the exponent to positive for @xmath56 are past - directed .",
    "the analytic extension of @xmath57 from the regions : @xmath58 to @xmath3 is obtained in the form @xmath59     and @xmath60 , the constant phase lines are schematically depicted . ]    now , let us derive the bogoliubov transformation between the poincar invariant vacuum and the vacuum defined by the conformal time flow in the diamond region @xmath6 .",
    "we can expand the field operator in the form @xmath61 then , the vacuum state in the diamond region @xmath62 is defined in terms of the annihilation operators @xmath63 as @xmath64    on the other hand , the poincar invariant vacuum is defined by the set of modes @xmath65 .",
    "more precisely , by writing the mode expansion of the field operator as @xmath66 the poincar invariant vacuum @xmath67 is defined by @xmath68 from eqs .",
    "( [ inmode ] ) and ( [ exmode ] ) , the transformation between the two sets of mode functions turns out to be @xmath69 this leads to the bogoliubov transformation of the creation and annihilation operators as @xmath70 from this , we see that the vacuum @xmath67 is also written formally as @xmath71    z&=\\prod_{\\omega } ( 1-e^{-\\pi l \\omega})^{-2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] by taking the partial trace of the density operator over the subsystem generated by the operators @xmath72 , we obtain the gibbs state with the inverse temperature @xmath73 as @xmath74    it should be noted , however , that there is an ambiguity in the normalization of the conformal killing vector field , @xmath75 , which affects the inverse temperature as @xmath76 .",
    "the invariant inverse temperature is given by @xmath77 , which is regarded as the local inverse temperature associated with the observer following the flow determined by the conformal killing vector . in terms of the proper time @xmath78 of the observer ,",
    "it becomes @xmath79 where @xmath80 denotes the proper acceleration of the observer and @xmath81 is the proper length of his lifetime .",
    "this is identical with the diamond temperature of martinetti and rovelli  @xcite .",
    "for we have explicitly determined the quantum state in the diamond region , we would be able to verify this peculiar behavior of the proper temperature along the observer with a finite lifetime by constructing a concrete model of the particle detector .",
    "note that this result does not immediately imply that a real thermometer with a finite lifetime in the minkowski space - time indicates a nonzero temperature . in principle , if a thermometer is prepared such that it interacts only with the field modes in the diamond region , it would indicate a finite temperature .",
    "however , such a preparation would be extremely difficult , that is an arbitrarily prepared thermometer would in general be inevitably coupled with field modes outside the diamond region .",
    "thus , we come to the same conclusion with different independent arguments , which is the evidence that the diamond temperature has the universal significance",
    ". we also note that the tunneling approach recently proposed by banerjee and majhi  @xcite , which is another independent method to obtain the temperature of the subsystem , also gives the same temperature , though we do nt state details here .",
    "to promote a better understanding of the thermodynamics of an observer in @xmath6 , we try to find the expression for the energy and the entropy in the diamond region .",
    "firstly , we compute the expectation value of the stress - energy operator @xmath82 for the observer in @xmath6 with respect to the poincar invariant vacuum . the operator @xmath82 is defined in @xmath6 by @xmath83 where the colons denote normal ordering with respect to the vacuum @xmath62 , and the metric @xmath32 in @xmath6 is written as @xmath84    noting that the hamiltonian @xmath85 defining the present thermal state can be written as the spatial integral of @xmath86 , we formally obtain its expectation value as @xmath87 here it should not be interpreted this divergent result as that the infinite energy has been confined in a bounded region .",
    "this quantity is merely the expectation value of the ideal hamiltonian operator such that the vacuum state projected onto the diamond region becomes the thermal state with respect to it , and hence it does not imply the instability of the minkowski space - time .",
    "the divergent factor @xmath88 here is controlled by introducing the cutoff scale @xmath89 in the following manner .",
    "let the scalar field @xmath90 be confined within the interval @xmath91 , and let @xmath92 be the corresponding stress - energy operator .",
    "then , the frequency of the scalar field is discretized as @xmath93 ( @xmath94 ) , and the energy is regarded as the limit @xmath95 where @xmath96 has been defined .",
    "on the other hand , the von neumann entropy @xmath97 of the gibbs state @xmath98 can be formally computed as @xmath99\\\\ & = { 2\\pi\\over 3l}\\delta(0),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the trace is taken over the fock space of the creation and annihilation operators @xmath100 .",
    "this may be called as the entanglement entropy of the diamond region @xmath6 .",
    "the divergent factor @xmath88 here also arises in the limit @xmath101 where @xmath102    in general , the amount of the entropy to energy ratio @xmath103 contained within a given finite region is believed to be bounded from above by the typical length scale @xmath104 of the region as @xmath105 this is known as the bekenstein bound  @xcite . in the present case , we find the relationship @xmath106 ( in the sense that @xmath107 holds , ) among the entropy @xmath97 , the length scale @xmath27 and the energy @xmath108 .",
    "this shows that the present system saturates the bekenstein bound .",
    "finally , let us try to speculate on another interpretation of the entropy @xmath97 in terms of the information theory .",
    "the trajectory of the modular flow is the curve : @xmath109 , which corresponds to the uniformly accelerated motion with the proper acceleration @xmath110 . in other words , each congruence class of trajectories of the modular flow under the action of the proper poincar group",
    "is represented by the pair of parameters @xmath111 .",
    "each trajectory of the modular flow defines a nonnegative function @xmath112 of the modular parameter @xmath30 on the trajectory , which integrates to unity : @xmath113 we interpret this as determining a certain probability density associated with the modular flow .",
    "for example , if an observer @xmath111 following the modular flow regards the increase of the minkowski time @xmath114 as a probabilistic process , so that @xmath114 jumps from @xmath115 to @xmath27 once in his history at the modular time @xmath30 , he could expect that this jump occurs with the probability density @xmath116 .",
    "given the family of probability density functions @xmath116 , the parameter space @xmath111 inherits the structure of the riemannian manifold .",
    "the riemannian metric on the parameter space is given by the fisher information metric @xmath117 where @xmath118 denotes the coordinates on the parameter space .",
    "in the present case , the parameter space @xmath111 turns out to be the poincar half plane .",
    "in fact , the fisher information metric has the form @xmath119 the distance in the parameter space determined by the fisher information metric gives an invariant measure of the difference between a pair of probability density functions . applying this to the distant pair : @xmath120 and @xmath121 in the diamond region @xmath6 of the fixed size @xmath27",
    ", we get @xmath122 thus , this amount of information discrepancy is proportional to the entanglement entropy .",
    "we can also compute explicitly the shannon entropy @xmath123 as @xmath124 which is a function of @xmath27 .",
    "this quantity can be also related with the distance between the point @xmath125 and @xmath126 as @xmath127.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus , the shannon entropy is relevant to the entropy correction  @xcite associated with the variation of the size of the diamond region @xmath6 .    in this way",
    ", the riemannian structure of the parameter space of a certain kind of the probability density functions might have to do with the entanglement entropy of the subsystem and its corrections .",
    "we hope this viewpoint provides some insight into the better understanding of the information - theoretic origin of the bekenstein - hawking entropy of black holes ."
