    "a bright soliton is a localized peak in density that can travel at a constant velocity in one dimension ( 1d ) with its shape unchanged , due to a cancellation of nonlinear attraction and dispersive effects @xcite .",
    "similarly , a dark soliton represents a dip or notch ( zero ) in density in a uniform medium that can travel in 1d maintaining its shape .",
    "bright solitons have been observed in water waves , nonlinear optics , and bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) etc . among others @xcite . in physical three - dimensional ( 3d ) world , 1d bright solitons were observed in bec of @xmath4li @xcite and @xmath5rb atoms @xcite .    in the absence of a uniform bec in a laboratory to create a mobile 1d dark soliton , a notch in density in a finite trapped quasi - one - dimensional ( quasi-1d ) repulsive bec along its width , dividing the bec into two equal pieces , has been observed in a quasi-1d bec of @xmath6rb atoms @xcite and termed a dark soliton . however , these dark solitons exhibit thermal and dynamical instabilities @xcite except for very strong transverse traps corresponding to a quasi-1d geometry . for a moderate to weak transverse confinement ,",
    "the dark solitons are unstable , show snake instability @xcite and decay to form a vortex ring @xcite . although the pioneering experiments on quasi-1d dark solitons @xcite faced technical difficulties in their stabilization due to thermal and dynamical effects , these problems are somewhat under control in recent investigations and different aspects and properties of dark solitons are being studied lately @xcite .",
    "the dynamical instability of the dark solitons becomes explicit , when the quasi-1d condition is relaxed , and bending and snaking ( dynamical ) instability of the dark solitons seriously hamper both theoretical and experimental studies @xcite .",
    "a more stable variant of the dark soliton , called ring - dark soliton , has also been suggested in a trapped repulsive bec @xcite and in a uniform self - defocusing medium in nonlinear optics @xcite and later observed in optics @xcite .",
    "a ring - dark soliton possesses a notch in density in the form of a ring in a quasi - two - dimensional ( quasi-2d ) trapped bec thus creating a ring - shaped concentric notch in a disk - shaped bec .",
    "however , the ring - dark soliton created on a quasi-2d bec is dynamically unstable in general @xcite and this creates difficulty in their theoretical and experimental studies @xcite .",
    "generation of ring dark solitons by phase engineering and their oscillations in spin-1 bose - einstein condensates have also been studied theoretically @xcite .",
    "this instability can be reduced by reducing the strength of the axial trap in a quasi-1d bec and the in - plane trap in a quasi-2d bec hosting the dark and ring - dark solitons , respectively . nevertheless , the ring - dark solitons are to be created in a repulsive quasi-2d bec and the in - plane trap can not be arbitrarily reduced as this will lead to arbitrarily large becs hosting these solitons , thus making it impossible to observe them experimentally .",
    "recent observation of dipolar becs of @xmath3dy @xcite , @xmath7er @xcite and @xmath8cr @xcite atoms has opened new studies in bec solitons . in a dipolar bec ,",

    "dipolar 1d and 2d bec solitons can be realized either by a harmonic or an optical - lattice trap in quasi-1d @xcite and quasi-2d @xcite settings , respectively .",
    "robust 1d and 2d dipolar bec solitons accommodating a large number of atoms are possible for a fully repulsive contact interaction @xcite .",
    "the long - range dipolar attraction prevents the escape of the atoms from the soliton and the contact repulsion gives stability against collapse .",
    "we demonstrated that the dynamical instability of a dark soliton can be eliminated if the dark soliton is imprinted on an 1d dipolar bec soliton instead of on a trapped bec @xcite .",
    "even a dynamically stable dark soliton can be realized on a 2d dipolar bec soliton @xcite .",
    "these 1d and 2d dipolar dark - in - bright solitons without any axial trap or an in - plane trap , respectively , do not exhibit bending or snake instability of nondipolar dark solitons in a repulsive trapped bec .    in this paper",
    "we demonstrate that a dynamically stable ring - dark soliton can be realized on a 2d bright dipolar soliton .",

    "the 2d rdb solitons presented in figures [ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] are stable and robust as tested under real - time propagation with a reasonable perturbation in the parameters .",
    "the robustness comes from the large contact repulsion which inhibits collapse .",

    "the two solitons move in opposite directions and suffer a head - on collision .",
    "the collision dynamics for velocity along @xmath9 direction is illustrated by plotting the density of the system at different times as shown in figure [ fig6](a ) .",
