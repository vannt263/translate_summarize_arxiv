    "understanding the nature of mesons and baryons has always been one of the most challenging topics in hadron physics .",
    "the new observations  @xcite have challenged the conventional wisdom that mesons are made of quark - antiquark pairs and baryons are composed of three quarks . in this respect , it is not surprising that both the @xmath0 state and the @xmath1 have generated a lot of interests in their true nature .",
    "the @xmath0 has been suggested of being either a @xmath17 , a tetraquark state , a meson - meson molecule , a glueball , or a dynamically generated state  @xcite .",
    "similarly , the @xmath1 has been found to be consistent with both a naive three quark picture and a molecular picture dynamically generated from @xmath9 and @xmath18 interactions .    in the chiral unitary approach ,",
    "the @xmath0 state was shown to be dynamically generated from the interaction of @xmath19 and @xmath20 treated as coupled channels in isospin @xmath21  @xcite .",
    "it decays into @xmath22 in @xmath23-wave with a total decay width around @xmath24 mev .",
    "the pole of the @xmath0 is much tied to the coupled channels and it disappears if either the @xmath22 or the @xmath14 channel is discarded .",
    "the closeness of its pole to the @xmath14 threshold and its strong coupling to @xmath14 have led to the suggestion that the @xmath0 state might be a cusp effect  @xcite . as a result",
    ", the @xmath0 total decay width increases very fast as its mass increases .",
    "for instance , ref .",
    "@xcite has claimed a large width for the @xmath0 around @xmath25 mev , where the @xmath0 state was studied within a realistic meson - exchange model for the @xmath26 and @xmath22 interactions .    on the other hand , in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was claimed that both the @xmath0 and the @xmath27 resonance emerge from a single @xmath28 seed state .",
    "this state interacts with other mesons , giving rise to meson - meson ( @xmath29 ) loop contributions to the corresponding mass .",
    "these contributions shift the pole of the seed state to higher energies , turning into the @xmath27 . for the @xmath0 ,",
    "the meson cloud eats up the original seed , becoming the largest component  @xcite ( see also refs .",
    "by now it is commonly accepted that the @xmath0 is not a standard @xmath30 state but an extraordinary state  @xcite .    for the @xmath1 hyperon resonance , based on the analysis of the available high precision data on @xmath31 reaction ,",
    "it was argued to be a three - quark state  @xcite .",
    "such a conclusion is also supported in the study of the @xmath32 reaction at low energies within the chiral quark model  @xcite .",
    "however , in the chiral unitary approach , the @xmath1 resonance can be dynamically generated from the @xmath23-wave meson baryon interaction in the strangeness @xmath33",
    "sector  @xcite .",
    "experimentally , the @xmath1 resonance is known to have a strong coupling to the @xmath34 channel  @xcite .",
    "hence , it is expected that the @xmath4 production is dominated by formation of the intermediate @xmath1 resonance .    in recent years",
    ", it has been shown that the selection of particular modes is possible in the nonleptonic weak decays of heavy hadrons  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the nonleptonic weak decays of charmed baryons can be useful tools to study hadronic resonances , some of which are subjects of intense debate about their nature  @xcite .",
    "in addition , those weak decays are also helpful to investigate final state interactions and hence have the potential to bring further light into the nature of some puzzling hadrons  @xcite .",
    "for instance , the @xmath35 decay was studied in refs .",
    "@xcite , where the @xmath36 state is generated in the final state interaction of the ground state pseudoscalar mesons and octet baryons ( @xmath37 ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the work of refs .",
    "@xcite on the @xmath38 weak decays was extended to the @xmath39 weak decays .",
    "it is shown there that these weak decays might be ideal processes to study the @xmath36 and @xmath1 resonances , because they are dominated by the @xmath40 contribution . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the @xmath41 mass distribution was studied in the @xmath42 decays with the aim of extracting the @xmath41 scattering lengths . in a recent work  @xcite the role of the exclusive @xmath43 decays into a neutron in testing the flavor symmetry and",
    "final state interaction was investigated .",
    "it was shown that the three body nonleptonic decays are of great interest to explore the final state interaction in @xmath44 decays .    along this line , in the present work",
    ", we revisit the @xmath45 decay taking into account not only the @xmath34 final - state - interaction ( fsi ) , but also the fsi of @xmath46 , which gives the line shape of the @xmath0 state .",
    "the pure @xmath15 nature of the @xmath3 channel is particularly beneficial to the study of the @xmath0 state .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "next , we discuss the decay of @xmath43 to produce the @xmath12 from the @xmath7 cluster and the @xmath48 pair undergoes hadronization to form a meson - meson pair .",

    "more specifically the transition amplitude is of the following form : @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the loop function of the two intermediate meson propagators  @xcite and @xmath79 are the meson - meson scattering amplitudes obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , which depend on the invariant mass @xmath80 of the @xmath3 system . in general , the factor @xmath81 should be different from the factor @xmath62 in eq .  .      with all the ingredients obtained in the previous section , one can write down the invariant mass distributions for the @xmath82 decay as  @xcite : @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the total decay amplitude for the decay of @xmath45 depending on the invariant @xmath3 and @xmath4 masses",
    "the @xmath44 decay is a three body decay and the invariant mass distribution with respect to any of the two invariant masses is evaluated by integrating over the other invariant mass . for a given value of @xmath80 , the range of @xmath64 is fixed as , @xmath85 where @xmath86 and @xmath87 are the energies of @xmath72 and @xmath12 in the @xmath3 rest frame .",

    "noting the fact that the obtained peak of the @xmath1 resonance is narrow  @xcite , we expect that the meson - meson final state interaction will not affect much the peak structure of the @xmath1 resonance in the @xmath4 invariant mass distribution .",
    "similarly , if we take @xmath91 mev , we obtain , @xmath92 which seems to imply that the meson - baryon final state interaction to form the @xmath1 state contributes to the @xmath3 invariant masses beyond the peak / cusp in the @xmath3 mass around @xmath93 mev of the @xmath0 state .",
    "however , we will see that the meson - baryon final state interaction does affect the @xmath0 structure in the invariant @xmath3 mass distribution .",

    "we can write the total decay amplitude @xmath84 as , @xmath97 where the relative strong phase @xmath96 is defined as , @xmath98    on the other hand , since the values of @xmath62 and @xmath81 are unknown , we impose a constraint on the values of @xmath62 and @xmath81 such that @xmath99 in this respect , we assume that the strengths of the two decay mechanisms shown in figs .

    "<S> we propose to study the @xmath0 and the @xmath1 resonances in the @xmath2 decay via the final state interactions of the @xmath3 and @xmath4 pairs . </S>",
    "<S> the weak interaction part proceeds through the @xmath5 quark decay process : @xmath6 , while the hadronization part takes place in two different mechanisms . in the first mechanism </S>",
    "<S> , the @xmath7 cluster picks up a @xmath8 pair from the vacuum to form the @xmath9 meson - baryon pair while the @xmath10 pair from the weak decay hadronizes into a @xmath11 . in the second </S>",
    "<S> , the @xmath7 cluster turns into a @xmath12 , while the @xmath10 pair from the @xmath5 decay picks up a @xmath8 pair and hadronizes into a meson - meson pair ( @xmath13 or @xmath14 ) . </S>",
    "<S> because the final @xmath3 and @xmath4 states are in pure isospin @xmath15 and @xmath16 combinations , the @xmath2 decay can be an ideal process to study the @xmath0 and @xmath1 resonances . describing the final state interaction in the chiral unitary approach </S>",
    "<S> , we find that the @xmath3 and @xmath4 invariant mass distributions , up to an arbitrary normalization , show clear cusp and peak structures , which can be associated with the @xmath0 and @xmath1 resonances , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the proposed mechanism can provide valuable information on the nature of these resonances and can in principle be test by facilities such as bepcii . </S>"
