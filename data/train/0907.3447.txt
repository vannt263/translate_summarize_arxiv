    "the presence of liquid - liquid ( ll ) equilibrium in simple fluids has drawn considerable attention in recent years,@xcite mainly due to its connection with the existence of certain thermodynamic , structural and dynamic anomalies in liquid water.@xcite the fact that there are significant regions of the phase diagram in which an increase of temperature at constant pressure is associated with a corresponding increase in density , or in which diffusivity is enhanced when the system is compressed , might be at first sight somewhat counterintuitive , and has therefore motivated a remarkable research effort . most of the systems that exhibit this peculiar behavior are also known to present low density solid phases ( with coordination numbers ranging from 2 to 5 ) less dense than their liquid counterparts .",
    "melting upon compression is a common feature that has to be accounted for as well .    in this",
    "regard , simple models constitute a fundamental aid that can allow to identify those essential features key to the presence of the aforementioned anomalous behavior .",
    "recent research has focused on two main categories of models : orientational and isotropic .",
    "the former class of models is constructed bearing in mind the orientational character of the hydrogen bond interaction or the strong directional character of the covalent bonding characteristic in systems with low density solid phases , such as silica,@xcite germanium oxide@xcite or phosphorus.@xcite for this class of materials , a series of realistic potentials have been employed in order to characterize their anomalies via computer simulation.@xcite useful as these studies might be , a better insight can be gained from simpler models which can be dealt with in some cases even analytically .",
    "perhaps the precursor of the simple orientational models is the bell - lavis two - dimensional lattice model of water,@xcite recently somewhat extended by barbosa and henriques.@xcite in addition to these , the mercedes benz model of water@xcite , the 3d lattice gas model of roberts and debenedetti@xcite , and the two - dimensional associating lattice gas model of henriques and barbosa@xcite must also be mentioned .",
    "the complexity of the above mentioned orientational models can be further reduced .",
    "a weighted orientational average from these types of interactions would lead in most cases to isotropic models with several interaction ranges . and",
    ", since the pioneering work of hemmer and stell,@xcite it turns out that the presence of two competing scales or interaction ranges has been found to lie at the heart of the existence of multiple phase transitions in otherwise `` simple '' fluids . the ramp potential model proposed by hemmer and stell regained attention when jagla@xcite stressed the similarities between its behavior and the anomalous properties of liquid water .",
    "since then , a good number of works have been devoted to the continuous ramp potential.@xcite other simple models with competing ranges of interaction , such as the hard - sphere square shoulder - square well potential have also been shown to exhibit ll equilibria.@xcite but not only continuous models can furnish an illustrative qualitative picture of the phase behavior and various anomalies found in water and related systems .",
    "isotropic lattice gas models have proven to be able to describe the qualitative features of these systems rather accurately .",
    "one dimensional,@xcite two dimensional@xcite and three dimensional@xcite lattice gas models have been studied , using either mean field approaches , transfer matrix methods and/or computer simulation .    in this paper",
    "we will consider a two - dimensional lattice gas model closely connected with the one studied in ref .   in three dimensions .",
    "the model is characterized by two competing interaction ranges ( a nearest neighbor hard core exclusion and a finite repulsive interaction on the next to nearest sites ) .",
    "this model is strongly related to the continuum shoulder model studied in ref .",
    ", when the attractive interactions are absent .",
    "our study will focus on the reentrant melting of the low density solid phase , using both computer simulation and lattice fundamental measure theory ( lfmt).@xcite we will see how the theoretical approach provides a qualitatively fairly approximate picture of our model phase diagram .",
    "the rest of the paper is sketched as follows .",
    "a brief description of the model is introduced in the next section .",
    "section iii is devoted to the simulation methodology .",
    "details on the finite size scaling analysis of the transitions are included in section iv .",
    "section v describes the lfmt as applied to this model , and finally our most significant results and conclusions are presented in section vi .",
    "we consider a two - dimensional model defined on a triangular lattice . a given site of the lattice can be either empty or occupied by one particle .",
    "the occupation of that site excludes the occupation of its six nearest neighbor ( nn ) sites .",
    "in addition there is a _ repulsive _ interaction between pairs of particles located in pairs of sites that are next to nearest neighbors ( nnn ) .",
    "the potential energy of an acceptable configuration is then written as : @xmath0 where @xmath1 indicates the set of nnn pairs of sites ; the coordinates @xmath2 are equal to zero for empty sites and equal to one for occupied sites ; and @xmath3 .    in the limit of high temperature",
    "the interactions between nnn become negligible and the system behaves as a hard core lattice gas with nn exclusion .",
    "such a model is the well known hard hexagon model , which exhibits a continuous order - disorder transition .",
    "the location of this transition was obtained by baxter,@xcite and it is believed to belong to the same universality class as the 3-state potts model in two dimensions.@xcite at high density the system adopts an ordered structure ( that will henceforth be referred to as t3 ) in which the sites occupy preferentially one of the three sublattices of the system [ see fig .",

    "one fourth of the sites ( large circles ) of the lattice are occupied.,title=\"fig:\",width=143 ]    in the low temperature and low pressure limit ( equivalently @xmath6 ) another lattice hard core model is met . in this case",
    "an occupied site excludes the occupation of its nn and nnn . under these exclusion rules , at high density we find again an ordered phase in which particles sit preferentially on one of the four corresponding sublattices [ see fig .  [",
    "fig : t3](b ) ] .",
    "the close packing density is in this case @xmath7 ( one fourth of the sites are occupied ) , and this ordered phase will henceforth be denoted t4 . attending to the symmetry of the order parameter and the dimensionality of the system , one expects to find an order - disorder transition belonging to the universality class of the 4-state potts model in two dimensions.@xcite theoretical analysis@xcite and simulation results@xcite have shown that this transition is also continuous .    as in previous work by some of the authors,@xcite we are interested in the phase transitions of the system at intermediate temperatures , where three phases : disordered , t4 , and t3 , can appear .",
    "in order to obtain the phase diagram of the system we have made use a number of monte carlo ( mc ) simulation techniques . at high temperature we have used a _",
    "flat - histogram _",
    "algorithm,@xcite inspired on the wang - landau ( wl ) method,@xcite to compute the helmholtz energy function for all possible densities of the systems at fixed temperature and volume . in practice , the simulation procedure can be regarded as an extension of the mc simulation in the grand - canonical ensemble ( gce ) , in which the different number of particles are not weighted by a fixed chemical potential , but using a weighting function which permits us to extend the densities entering the sampling to an arbitrary range .",
    "such a weighting function is not known a priori , but it can be computed following the strategies underlying the wl method .",
    "once the helmholtz energy function is known , for a given temperature , for all the densities and several system sizes , one can resort to finite - size scaling strategies to locate the phase transitions .",
    "this technique , with some modifications , has also been used to determine the transition occurring at low temperature and moderate density between a _ fluid _",
    "( f ) disordered phase and a triangular t4 phase .    in addition , we have made use of the so - called gibbs - duhem integration ( gdi ) technique@xcite to determine the transition between the two ordered phases and to check the consistency of the results .    in what follows we summarize these techniques .",
    "the flat histogram algorithm is divided in two parts.@xcite the first one is devoted to find a weighting function to sample efficiently a prefixed range of densities , at constant temperature @xmath8 , and volume . in this part we make use of the wl strategy . in the second part the actual sampling of the system properties",
    "is carried out .",
    "we will comment later about the specific details of each of these two steps . in the application of the algorithm",
    ", two types of moves , denoted as translation and insertion / deletion attempts , are considered .",
    "translational moves are carried out as follows : ( i ) a particle is selected at random , and removed from its position , @xmath9 , in the system .",
    "( ii ) a trial position @xmath10 ( which could even be the previous one ) is selected at random with equal probability from those positions which are neither occupied nor excluded by the nn interaction .",
    "( iii ) the new position is accepted with a probability given by the standard metropolis criterion applied to the interactions of the particle in the current and in the trial positions , i.e.@xcite @xmath11 }       { \\exp \\left [   - \\beta { \\cal u}_i({\\bf r}_i   ) \\right ] } \\right\\ } , \\label{acept1}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the interaction energy of particle @xmath13 , and @xmath14 , with @xmath15 being boltzmann s constant .    in the second type of mc move ,",
    "a change of the number of system particles , @xmath16 , is attempted .",
    "first of all it is randomly decided ( with equal probabilities ) whether to increase or decrease @xmath16 .",
    "let us first consider the most common case in which @xmath17 for the removal attempts and @xmath18 for the insertion attempts , @xmath19 being the maximum number of particles to be considered . if the number of particles is to be reduced , an occupied position is selected at random and its particle is either removed or left according to the acceptance criteria . if an insertion is attempted , a non - excluded position ( if there is any , otherwise the insertion attempt is directly rejected ) is selected to insert a particle , and as above the acceptance criteria are applied .    in order to present the acceptance probabilities of these attempts in the context of a flat histogram procedure ,",
    "let us first write the canonical configurational partition function , @xmath20 \\\\   & = \\frac{m^n}{n ! } \\left\\langle\\exp \\left [ - \\beta { \\cal u } \\right ] \\right\\rangle_{0 } , \\end{split } \\label{zn0}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is the full set of @xmath22 possible configurations of @xmath16 distinguishable particles over a lattice with @xmath23 positions .",

    "the sampling of different values of @xmath16 can be carried out by introducing a weight function @xmath26 .",

    "we can now define the acceptance probabilities of an attempted change in the number of particles . for",
    "that we start off from the detailed balance equation@xcite @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are two configurations of the system with @xmath16 and @xmath45 particles , respectively , which differ just in the fact that the latter has an additional particle with respect to the former .",
    "the right - hand side of ( [ balance ] ) is the probability of moving from the configuration @xmath43 to the configuration @xmath44 in a given monte carlo step , whereas the left - hand side corresponds to the probability of the reverse move . by @xmath46",
    "we denote the probability of choosing @xmath47 as trial configuration in an insertion / deletion move , when the current configuration is @xmath48 .",
    "finally @xmath49 is the probability of accepting the mc move @xmath50 .",
    "taking into account the above described method of performing the insertion / deletion moves we can write @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the number of available positions ( those that are not excluded due to hard core interactions ) in the system with configuration @xmath43 . taking into account ( [ omegaf])([wrminus ] ) we can write : @xmath53 \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath54 is the change of the potential energy of the system when introducing the new particle .",
    "we have performed two types of calculation . at high temperature",
    "the full range of possible number of particles , @xmath55 , has been sampled . in this case",
    "we have introduced transitions between the empty and the fully occupied lattice .",
    "this is feasible because the total number of configurations of both cases is known exactly , namely one for the empty lattice and three ( corresponding to the filling of each of the tree sublattices ) for the fully occupied lattice .",
    "thus @xmath56 and @xmath57 and the corresponding acceptance ratios can be obtained for this particular case .",
    "we will call this scheme _",
    "cyclic sampling .",
    "_    at low temperatures we found difficult to sample the whole range of densities because the wl procedure showed slow convergence .",
    "so in order to analyze the transition between the gas and the t4 phases we performed the simulations in the range @xmath58 . in this case a cyclic scheme is not feasible because at @xmath59 other configurations different to those of the perfect t4 structure are possible for @xmath60 .",
    "therefore in the insertion / deletion sampling one directly rejects selected trials of particle deletion when @xmath61 and of particle insertion when @xmath60 .",
    "technical details about how to compute the helmholtz energy fuction @xmath62 using flat - histogram techniques can be found elsewhere.@xcite here we will just mention the basic ideas underlying the calculation .",
    "simulations are divided in two parts : equilibration and sampling . in the equilibration",
    "part @xmath37 is modified during the simulation run to push the system to visit all the values of @xmath16 in the selected range .",
    "this equilibration is split in stages , each one run until certain convergence criteria are satisfied .",
    "as the stages go on the changes in @xmath37 are smaller . at the end of the equilibration one",
    "expects to have an appropriate estimation of @xmath37 .",
    "once the equilibration part is finished , the resulting function @xmath37 is kept fixed and the sampling part of the simulation starts . during this part one",
    "computes the probability of each value of @xmath16 ( from which a refined result for the helmholtz energy function @xmath62 can be obtained ) and different properties of the system , such as energy , energy fluctuation , order parameter , etc .",
    "the sampling part is divided into blocks in order to estimate error bars .      as in previous works@xcite with systems exhibiting a similar phase behavior , we have employed gdi@xcite in the computation of the phase diagram . in the present case gdi",
    "was used to determine the t3t4 transition and to check the consistency of the flat histogram mc calculations .",
    "the analysis of the helmholtz energy function in the limit @xmath63 leads to a value of @xmath64 for the t3t4 transition . after a number of short calculations",
    "we conclude that such a value hardly varies for low temperatures .",
    "gdi goes as follows . for fixed volume ( m )",
    "systems , the changes in the grand potential can be written as @xmath65 at given @xmath66 and @xmath32 phase equilibrium exists if the pressure , @xmath67 , is equal in both phases .",

    "equation  ( [ dbetamu ] ) , or some variants of it , can be used to build up numerical integration schemes to compute the phase equilibrium of discontinuous transitions . in practice",

    "we have performed a theoretical analysis of this model using lfmt.@xcite this theory is the lattice counterpart of rosenfeld s fundamental measure theory@xcite ( fmt ) , and its construction is based on the approach through zero - dimensional ( 0d ) cavities and dimensional crossovers of tarazona and rosenfeld.@xcite in short this theory amounts to computing the exact functional for a certain set of small graphs ( the 0d cavities ) and then build the simplest functional for the whole lattice which provides the exact result for density profiles that are zero everywhere in the lattice except in a 0d cavity .",

    "this model has been previously solved within the lfmt approach in ref .  .",
    "lfmt is a mean - field - like theory , and therefore all second order transitions have a parabolic behavior of the order parameter corresponding to a critical exponent @xmath240 .",
    "the exponent of the hard hexagon model ( like that of the 3-state potts model ) is@xcite @xmath241 .",
    "looking at figure  7 of ref .",
    "one must admit that a discontinuous function is a better approximation to the behavior of the order parameter than a parabolic , mean - field one .",
    "so although not quite satisfying , the result is quantitatively not too inaccurate .",
    "this also reflects in the fact that the pressure and chemical potential at the transition is rather close to the exact value , and it remains so for all @xmath242 , as figs .",

    "the lattice contains four kinds of them , each with an a site at one of the four positions .",
    "there is the same amount of each type .",

    "we obtain a wide first order transition from a uniform fluid to a t4 solid , which again is found to be continuous in the simulations .",
    "the values of the pressure and chemical potential for this transition are nevertheless rather accurately predicted ( see figs .",
    "[ bp - t ] and [ bmu - t ] ) , so the same considerations as for the f ",
    "t3 transition in the hard hexagon ( @xmath239 ) limit hold here .",
    "we find a first - order f  t4 transition all the way up to @xmath254 , where it coalesces to an end - point ( at @xmath255 ) .",
    "it is to be noticed that this point is obtained with high accuracy ( simulations yield @xmath256 and @xmath257 ; see table  [ table - specials ] ) , and that simulations also find a first - order f ",
    "t4 transition near this point ( see fig .",
    "[ t - eta ] ) .",
    "when @xmath253 the model has a close - packing at @xmath258 ; however , for any @xmath259 this limit can be crossed , although at a very high energetic cost .",
    "once this cost is paid , the system greatly diminishes its entropy by reordering itself in a t3 structure .",
    "hence the transition that is found , for all @xmath260 up to not too far from @xmath261 , between a close - packed t4 solid and a nearly closed - packed t3 solid , which is also observed in the simulations ( see fig .",
    "[ t - eta ] ) .",
    "what happens with the free energy at this t4t3 transition is very peculiar and it is illustrated in fig .  [ energy ] .",
    "the derivative of the free energy per unit volume ( in @xmath219 units ) with respect to the packing fraction is discontinuous at @xmath258 .",
    "the free energy of the t4 phase is concave beyond this point , so there is a t4t3 coexistence , but it does not satisfy the standard conditions of phase equilibria . as a matter of fact , both the pressure and the chemical potential jump discontinuously at this point .",
    "this creates a `` forbidden '' region in the pressure - temperature and the chemical potential - temperature , which can be observed in figs .",
    "[ bp - t ] and [ bmu - t ] .    at the value",
    "@xmath261 there is a f  t3t4 triple point , which the theory predicts very close to the value obtained in the simulations , @xmath262 ( see table  [ table - specials ] ) .    in the range @xmath263 a reentrant t4f transition",
    "is found before the f  t3 transition occurs .",
    "this reentrant behavior also appears in the simulations , although the coexistence region is wider because the f ",
    "t3 transition is continuous ( see fig .  [ t - eta ] ) .",
    "from figs .",
    "[ t - eta ] , [ bp - t ] , and [ bmu - t ] , we see that the theoretical results for the equilibrium between the ordered phases are in reasonably good agreement with the simulation .",
    "the theoretical estimations of the triple point and the high temperature end - point of the f  t4 equilibrium are also well described . on the other hand the lfmt description of the order - disorder transitions ,",
    "both at low and high temperature is less accurate .",
    "the theory predicts first order transitions whereas they are continuous in both limits . we have argued that this is so because the behavior of the order parameter is very sharp ( the critical exponent @xmath241 ) , so much that a discontinuous function is a better approximation to it than the simple parabolic behavior predicted by any mean - field - like theory ( like this one ) .",
    "the theory can in principle be refined by considering larger `` maximal cavities '' .",
    "although it would produce a far more complicated theory than the one presented here , and it is expected that its accuracy would increase , it is doubtful that the order of the transition would be corrected .",
    "no matter how much we complicate the theory , it does not cure its mean - field behavior near the transitions .",
    "this is also the reason why first - order transitions are described much better .      when comparing the phase diagram for the two - dimensional system on the triangular lattice with that of the three - dimensional system@xcite [ c.f .",
    "[ fig3d ] ] in a simple cubic lattice we find a couple of qualitative differences .",
    "the first one concerns the nature of the order - disorder transition at low temperature , which is continuous in two dimensions and discontinuous in three dimensions .",
    "this difference can be understood in terms of the different dimensionality , and can be related with the critical behavior of potts models @xcite in two and three dimensions .",
    "the second relevant difference arises when comparing the transitions between the two ordered phases . in two dimensions , at solid - solid equilibrium the high density solid is nearly close packed for a wide range of temperatures , whereas this is not the case for its three dimensional counterpart even at the lowest temperatures .",
    "this difference can be explained as follows . at low temperature phase equilibrium",
    "is essentially controlled by the condition of minimum energy .",
    "the energy per unit volume of the closed packed configuration in two dimensions is @xmath266 . at slighly lower @xmath187",
    "there are vacancies .",
    "the way in which they minimize the energy is by not being nearest neighbors in the solid lattice ( i.e.  next - nearest neighbors in the underlying lattice ) . this way each vacancy reduces the energy by @xmath267 .",
    "thus , for @xmath268 , @xmath269 . if we consider , at the same density , a system separated into a close - packed t3 and a t4 phase , then @xmath270 and @xmath271 , and the energy of this system will be @xmath272 . hence @xmath273 .",
    "since @xmath274 for all @xmath275 , then the phase separated system is energetically favored . the same argument for the three - dimensional model of hye",
    "_ _ et al.__@xcite yields the same energy , @xmath276 ( for @xmath277 in both cases ,",
    "so in the three dimensional system the entropy does play a role in defining the density of the high density solid , and the number of vacancies does not go to zero when approaching @xmath278 .",
    "the similarity between the phase diagrams in two and three dimensions is remarkable , though .",
    "peculiar features like the reentrant fluid phase or the vertical line at the closest packing of the loose solid when it coexists with the dense one , appear in both cases .",
    "much to our surprise , we have realized that the lfmt for the three - dimensional model is far more complicated than that of the two - dimensional one .",
    "the reason is that the soft repulsion at nnn allows for maximal cavities with up to four particles at the same time .",
    "this not only introduces a much larger set of cavities to elaborate the density functional , but also the corresponding expressions for the @xmath153 functions is very cumbersome and hard to handle . on the other hand ,",
    "given the similarity between the phase diagrams , it seems that the physics of the model is already well captured by the two - dimensional version .",
