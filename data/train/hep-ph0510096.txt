    "nowadays , it is widely accepted that hydrodynamics is a successful approach for describing the bulk of the collective flow in high - energy nuclear collisions @xcite .",
    "the basic assumption in hydrodynamical models is the local thermal equilibrium .",
    "once this condition is satisfied , all the thermodynamical relations should be valid in each space - time point .",
    "the properties of the matter formed in high - energy collisions are then specified by some equations of state ( eos ) .",
    "thus , one of the main objects of hydrodynamical approach is to determine which are the eos that consistently reproduce the observed quantities .    in high - energy nucleus - nucleus collisions ,",
    "one often uses eos with a first - order phase transition , connecting a high - temperature qgp phase of the system with a low - temperature hadronic phase .",
    "however , lattice qcd studies showed that the transition line between qgp and hadron phase has a critical end point and for small net baryon surplus the transition is of crossover type  @xcite .",
    "so , we would like to learn what are the consequences of these results on the hydrodynamics and on the observable quantities .    we shall begin showing , in the next section , how the critical end point could be implemented for the sake of phenomenological computations .",
    "besides the eos , the ingredients of any hydrodynamic approach are the equations of motion , the initial conditions and some decoupling prescription . in sec .",
    "[ ingredients ] , we shall discuss how the initial conditions are chosen in our studies ; then , how we solve the hydrodynamic equations ; and finally which is the decoupling prescription . in sec .",
    "[ results ] , we shall show some of the results of our studies .",
    "finally , summaries of conclusions and outlook are given in sec .",
    "[ conclusions ] .",
    "as mentioned above , one often introduces eos with a first - order phase transition , connecting a qgp phase of the system , usually described by the mit bag model , with a hadronic phase , depicted as a resonance gas .",
    "a detailed account of such eos may be found , for instance , in @xcite .",
    "we start from these eos , in order to get a phenomenological parametrization of those suggested by lattice qcd .",
    "let us denote by @xmath1 the pressure given by the mit bag model and @xmath2 the one corresponding to the hadronic resonance gas . given a value @xmath3 of the baryonic chemical potential",
    ", we write for the pressure @xmath4 the equation ( see figure [ fig : ptcp2 ] ) @xmath5 where @xmath6 , \\quad\\quad\\hbox{with }   \\quad\\quad\\mu_c=\\hbox{critical chemical potential}.   \\label{delta}\\ ] ]    by solving the equation above and using thermodynamical relations , we obtain @xmath7\\,\\delta }           { \\sqrt{(p_q - p_h)^2 + 4\\delta}}\\ , \\\\    \\hbox{where}\\quad \\lambda&\\equiv&{1\\over2 }       \\left[1-(p_q - p_h)/\\sqrt{(p_q - p_h)^2 + 4\\delta}\\right]\\ . \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] observe that if @xmath8 , we recover the eos with the first - order phase transition described above . in the discussion",
    "below , we call them 1opt eos .",
    "as seen in figure [ fig : ptcp2 ] , when @xmath9 , the transition from hadron phase to qgp is smooth . in the right - hand side of eq.([pressure ] ) , we     ) and ( [ delta ] ) . ]    could choose some function which becomes exactly 0 for @xmath10 to guarantee the first - order phase transition there , but for practical purpose this is not necessary . as will be shown below , our choice represented by eq.([delta ] ) is enough .",
    "we shall designate the equations of state given above , with @xmath11 , cp eos .",
    "let us compare in figure [ fig : eos1 ] below , the temperature dependences of the energy and entropy densities , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , and the pressure @xmath4 , given by the two sets of eos defined above .",
    "one can see that the cross-      and @xmath4 as function of @xmath12 for the two eos shown in figure  [ fig : eos1].,width=774,height=510 ]     and @xmath4 as function of @xmath12 for the two eos shown in figure  [ fig : eos1].,width=774 ]    over behavior is correctly reproduced by our parametrization for cp eos , while finite jumps in @xmath14 and @xmath15 are exhibited by 1opt eos , when @xmath16 crosses the transiton temperature .",
    "it is also seen , as mentioned above , that at @xmath17gev the two eos are indistinguishable .",
    "now , since in a real collision what is directly given is the energy distribution at a certain initial time ( besides baryon number distribution , charge distribution , strangeness distribution , _ etc . _ ) , whereas the temperature is defined with the use of the former , it would be nice to compare the two sets of eos , by plotting several quantities as function of @xmath12 .",
    "we do this in figure [ fig : eos2 ] .",
    "one immediately sees there some remarkable differences between the two sets of eos : @xmath18 ) naturally the pressure is not constant for cp eos in the crossover region ; @xmath19 ) moreover , the entropy is larger .",
    "we will see in sec.4 that these characteritics affect the observed quantities in non - negligible way .",
    "besides the equations of state , the other ingredients of a hydrodynamic model are the initial conditions , the equations of motion and some decoupling prescription . here we shall discuss how these elements are chosen in our studies .      in usual hydrodynamic approach",
    ", one assumes some highly symmetric and smooth initial conditions ( ic ) .",
    "however , since our systems are small , large event - by - event fluctuations are expected in real collisions , so this effect should be taken into account .",
    "remark that this might happen even if the impact parameter could be maintained fixed .",
    "many simulators , based on microscopic models , _",
    "e.g. _ hijing @xcite , vni @xcite , urasima @xcite , nexus @xcite , @xmath20 , show such event - by - event fluctuations . as an example we show in figure [ fig : ic ] the energy density for central au+au collisions at 130a gev , given by nexus simulator @xcite , at mid - rapidity . in our approach , we use both fluctuating and averaged ic . some consequences of such fluctuations have been discussed elsewhere .",
    "we shall discuss some others in sec.[results ] .     at the initial instant .",
    "left : one random event .",
    "right : average over 30 random events ( corresponding to the smooth initial conditions in the usual hydro approach).,width=377 ]      the equations of motion of hydrodynamics are the continuity equations expressing the energy - momentum conservation , the baryon - number conservation , and other conservation laws , corresponding to several charges . here , for the sake of simplicity , we shall consider only the energy - momentum and the baryon number .",
    "since our ic are entirely arbitrary , without any symmetry , as discussed above , the only way to solve the equations is through numerical computations .",
    "we have developed a numerical code called spherio ( * s*moothed * p*article * h*ydrodynamic * e*volution of * r*elativistic heavy * io*n collisions ) @xcite , based on the so called smoothed - paricle hydrodynamics ( sph ) algorithm @xcite .      in hydrodynamic treatment of high - energy nuclear collisions ,",
    "one often assumes decoupling on a sharply defined hypersurface , usually characterized by a constant temperature @xmath21 .",
    "we call this _ sudden freeze out _ ( fo )",
    ". however , our systems are small , so particles may escape from a layer with thickness comparable with the systems sizes .",
    "we have proposed an alternative decoupling prescription that we call _ continuous emission _ ( ce )  @xcite which , as compared to the usual sudden freeze out , we believe closer to what happens in the actual collisions .",
    "we introduce , at each space - time point @xmath22 , a certain momentum - dependent escaping probability @xmath23 .",
    "\\label{eq : prob1}\\ ] ]    to implement this prescription in our spherio code , we had to introduce some approximation to make the computation practicable .",
    "first , we take @xmath24 on the average , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath25 and then we approximate linearly the density @xmath26 in eq.([eq : prob1 ] ) .",
    "thus , @xmath27 where @xmath28 is estimated to be 0.3@xmath29 , corresponding to @xmath30 2  @xmath31 .",
    "we show , in figure [ fig : prob ] , the time ( @xmath32 ) evolution of the probability @xmath24 , estimated by this expression , in the mid - rapidity plane for the most central au+au collisions at 130@xmath29a gev . for comparison , we show , in figure [ fig : temperature ] , the corresponding time evolution of the temperature @xmath16 .",
    "one sees that , whereas in _ sudden freeze out _ , particles are emitted from a constant @xmath16 line of figure [ fig : temperature ] , in _ continuous emission _ , they are emitted according to the probability @xmath24 , so from a difuse space region and during a larger time interval .",
    "it will be shown in sec .",
    "[ results ] that this difference gives important changes in some observables .",
    "let us now show results of computation of some observables , as described above , for au+au collisions at 200a gev .",
    "we start computing the pseudo - rapidity and the transverse - momentum distributions for charged particles , to fix the parameters .",
    "then , the elliptic - flow parameter @xmath33 and hbt radii are computed in fit - parameter free way .      in sec .",
    "[ eos ] , we showed that the inclusion of a critical end poit in the first - order phase - transition line increases the entropy per energy , as compared with 1opt eos .",
    "this means that , given the same total energy , the multiplicity is larger for cp eos case than for 1opt eos one .",
    "figure [ fig : eta1 ] shows clearly that this happens , especially in the mid - rapidity region .",
    "now , once the equations of state are chosen , what is the effect of the fluctuating initial conditions for the same decoupling prescription ?",
    "this effect has already been discussed      distributions for the most central au+au at 200a gev , computed with cp eos , with three different combinations of ic and decoupling prescriptions . ]",
    "distributions for the most central au+au at 200a gev , computed with cp eos , with three different combinations of ic and decoupling prescriptions . ]",
    "earlier  @xcite and shown in figure [ fig : eta ] , namely , the multiplicity is smaller if the ic fluctuation is taken into account and average computed after the decoupling , as compared with the result obtained with smooth averaged ic . the curve with continuous emission is also shown there , reproducing equally well the data . here , the parameter @xmath34 has been fixed as explained in subsec .",
    "[ ce ] .      as discussed in sec .",
    "[ eos ] , since the pressure does not remain constant in the crossover region , we expect that the transverse acceleration is larger for cp eos , as compared with 1opt eos case . in effect , figure [ fig : pt1 ] does show that @xmath35 distribution is flatter for cp eos , but the difference is small .",
    "we show , in figure [ fig : pt ] , three different combinations of ic and decoupling prescriptions , corresponding to cp eos . the curve with the event - by - event fluctuating ic is flatter than the one corresponding to the averaged ic , both with sudden freezeout , probably because the initial expansion in the former is more violent , due to the bumpy structure with high - density blobs , as seen in figure [ fig : ic ] in this case .",
    "the freezeout temperature suggested by @xmath36 and @xmath35 distributions turned out to be @xmath37mev .",

    "notice that the continuous emission makes the curves narrower , as a consequence of earlier emission of particles , so smaller acceleration , at large-@xmath38 regions .",

    ". however , there is still numerical discrepancy in this case .",

    "some observables were computed and studied the effects of such eos .",
    "some of the conclusions are :    1 .   the multiplicity becomes larger for these equations of state in the mid - rapidity ; 2 .",

    "the effect of the continuous emission on the interacting component has not been taken into account .",
    "a more realistic treatment of this effect probably makes @xmath46 smaller , because the duration for particle emission becomes smaller in this case .",
