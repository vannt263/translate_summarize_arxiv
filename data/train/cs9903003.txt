    "in the simplest and commonest case , ` linguistic annotation ' is an orthographic transcription of speech , time - aligned to an audio or video recording .",
    "other central examples include morphological analysis , part - of - speech tagging and syntactic bracketing ; phonetic segmentation and labeling ; annotation of disfluencies , prosodic phrasing , intonation , gesture , and discourse structure ; marking of co - reference , ` named entity ' tagging , and sense tagging ; and phrase - level or word - level translations .",
    "linguistic annotations may describe texts or recorded signals",
    ". our focus will be on the latter , broadly construed to include any kind of audio , video or physiological recording , or any combination of these , for which we will use the cover term ` linguistic signals ' .",
    "however , our ideas also apply to the annotation of texts .",
    "linguistic annotations have seen increasingly broad use in the scientific study of language , in research and development of language - related technologies , and in language - related applications more broadly , for instance in the entertainment industry .",
    "particular cases range from speech databases used in speech recognition or speech synthesis development , to annotated ethnographic materials , to cartoon sound tracks .",
    "there have been many independent efforts to provide tools for creating linguistic annotations , to provide general formats for expressing them , and to provide tools for creating , browsing and searching databases containing them ",
    "see [ ] . within the area of speech and language technology development alone , hundreds of annotated linguistic databases",
    "have been published in the past fifteen years .",
    "while the utility of existing tools , formats and databases is unquestionable , their sheer variety  and the lack of standards able to mediate among them  is becoming a critical problem .",
    "particular bodies of data are created with particular needs in mind , using formats and tools tailored to those needs , based on the resources and practices of the community involved . once created , a linguistic database",
    "may subsequently be used for a variety of unforeseen purposes , both inside and outside the community that created it .",
    "adapting existing software for creation , update , indexing , search and display of ` foreign ' databases typically requires extensive re - engineering . working across a set of databases requires repeated adaptations of this kind .",
    "previous attempts to standardize practice in this area have primarily focussed on file formats and on the tags , attributes and values for describing content ( e.g.  @xcite , @xcite ; but see also @xcite ) .",
    "we contend that file formats and content specifications , though important , are secondary . instead",
    ", we focus on the logical structure of linguistic annotations .",
    "we demonstrate that , while different existing annotations vary greatly in their form , their logical structure is remarkably consistent . in order to help us think about the form and meaning of annotations",
    ", we describe a simple mathematical framework endowed with a practically useful formal structure .",
    "this opens up an interesting range of new possibilities for creation , maintenance and search .",
    "we claim that essentially all existing annotations can be expressed in this framework .",
    "thus , the framework should provide a useful ` interlingua ' for translation among the multiplicity of current annotation formats , and also should permit the development of new tools with broad applicability .",
    "before we embark on our survey , a terminological aside is necessary .",
    "as far as we are aware , there is no existing cover term for the kinds of transcription , description and analysis that we address here .",
    "` transcription ' may refer to the use of ordinary orthography , or a phonetic orthography ; it can plausibly be extended to certain aspects of prosody ( ` intonational transcription ' ) , but not to other kinds of analysis ( morphological , syntactic , rhetorical or discourse structural , semantic , etc ) .",
    "one does not talk about a ` syntactic transcription ' , although this is at least as determinate a representation of the speech stream as is a phonetic transcription . `",
    "coding ' has been used by social scientists to mean something like ` the assignment of events to stipulated symbolic categories , ' as a generalization of the ordinary language meaning associated with translating words and phrases into references to a shared , secret code book .",
    "it would be idiosyncratic and confusing ( though conceptually plausible ) to refer to ordinary orthographic transcription in this way .",
    "the term ` markup ' has come to have a specific technical meaning , involving the addition of typographical or structural information to a document .    in ordinary language ,",
    "` annotation ' means a sort of commentary or explanation ( typically indexed to particular portions of a text ) , or the act of producing such a commentary .",
    "like ` markup ' , this term s ordinary meaning plausibly covers the non - transcriptional kinds of linguistic analysis , such as the annotation of syntactic structure or of co - reference .",
    "some speech and language engineers have begun to use ` annotation ' in this way , but there is not yet a specific , widely - accepted technical meaning . we feel that it is reasonable to generalize this term to cover the case of transcribing speech , by thinking of ` annotation ' as the provision of any symbolic description of particular portions of a pre - existing linguistic object .",
    "if the object is a speech recording , then an ordinary orthographic transcription is certainly a kind of annotation in this sense  though it is one in which the amount of critical judgment is small .    in sum , ` annotation ' is a reasonable candidate for adoption as the needed cover term .",
    "the alternative would be to create a neologism ( ` scription ' ? ) .",
    "extension of the existing term ` annotation ' seems preferable to us .",
    "in order to justify our claim that essentially all existing linguistic annotations can be expressed in the framework that we propose , we need to discuss a representative set of such annotations .",
    "in addition , it will be easiest to understand our proposal if we motivate it , piece by piece , in terms of the logical structures underlying existing annotation practice .",
    "this section reviews nine bodies of annotation practice , with a concrete example of each . for each example , we show how to express its various structuring conventions in terms of our ` annotation graphs ' , which are networks consisting of nodes and arcs , decorated with time marks and labels .",
    "following the review , we shall discuss some general architectural issues (  [ sec : arch ] ) , give a formal presentation of the ` annotation graph ' concept (  [ sec : algebra ] ) , and describe some indexing methods (  [ sec : indexing ] ) .",
    "the paper concludes in  [ sec : conclusion ] with an evaluation of the proposed formalism and a discussion of future work .",
    "the nine annotation models to be discussed in detail are timit @xcite , partitur @xcite , childes @xcite , the lacito archiving project @xcite , ldc broadcast news , ldc telephone speech , nist utf @xcite , emu @xcite and festival @xcite",
    ". these models are widely divergent in type and purpose .",
    "some , like timit , are associated with a specific database , others , like utf , are associated with a specific linguistic domain ( here conversation ) , while still others , like festival , are associated with a specific application domain ( here , speech synthesis ) .",
    "several other systems and formats have been considered in developing our ideas , but will not be discussed in detail .",
    "these include switchboard @xcite , hcrc maptask @xcite , tei @xcite , and mate @xcite .",
    "the switchboard and maptask formats are conversational transcription systems that encode a subset of the information in the ldc and nist formats cited above .",
    "the tei guidelines for ` transcriptions of speech ' ( * ? ? ?",
    "* p11 ) are also similar in content , though they offer access to a very broad range of representational techniques drawn from other aspects of the tei specification . the tei report sketches or alludes to a correspondingly wide range of possible issues in speech annotation .",
    "all of these seem to be encompassed within our proposed framework , but it does not seem appropriate to speculate at much greater length about this , given that this portion of the tei guidelines does not seem to have been used in any published transcriptions to date . as for mate , it is a new sgml- and tei - based standard for dialogue annotation , in the process of being developed",
    ". it also appears to fall within the class of annotation systems that our framework covers , but it would be premature to discuss the correspondences in detail . still other models that we are aware of include @xcite .",
    "note that there are many kinds of linguistic database that are not linguistic annotations in our sense , although they may be connected with linguistic annotations in various ways .",
    "one example is a lexical database with pointers to speech recordings along with transcriptions of those recordings ( e.g.  hyperlex @xcite ) .",
    "another example would be collections of information that are not specific to any particular stretch of speech , such as demographic information about speakers .",
    "we return to such cases in  [ sec : extensions ] .",
    "the timit corpus of read speech was designed to provide data for the acquisition of acoustic - phonetic knowledge and to support the development and evaluation of automatic speech recognition systems .",
    "timit was the first annotated speech database to be published , and it has been widely used and also republished in several different forms .",
    "it is also especially simple and clear in structure . here",
    ", we just give one example taken from the timit database @xcite .",

    "the path name tells us that this is training data , from ` dialect region 1 ' , from female speaker ` jsp0 ' , containing words and audio sample numbers .",
    "the file contains a corresponding broad phonetic transcription , which begins as follows :    0 2360 h # 2360 3720 sh 3720 5200 iy 5200 6160 hv 6160",

    "observe that edge labels have the form where the here tells us what kind of label it is .",
    "we have used for the ( phonetic transcription ) contents of the .phn file , and for the ( orthographic word ) contents of the .wrd file .",
    "the top number for each node is an arbitrary node identifier , while the bottom number is the time reference .",
    "we distinguish node identifiers from time references since nodes may lack time references , as we shall see later .",
    "the partitur format of the bavarian archive for speech signals @xcite is founded on the collective experience of a broad range of german speech database efforts .",
    "the aim has been to create ` an open ( that is extensible ) , robust format to represent results from many different research labs in a common source . '",
    "partitur is valuable because it represents a careful attempt to present a common low - level core for all of those independent efforts , similar in spirit to our effort here .",
    "in essence , partitur extends and reconceptualizes the timit format to encompass a wide range of annotation types .    the partitur format permits time - aligned , multi - tier description of speech signals , along with links between units on different tiers which are independent of the temporal structure .",
    "for ease of presentation , the example partitur file will be broken into a number of chunks , and certain details ( such as the header ) will be ignored .",

    "this seems like the best choice in general , since there is no necessary logical structure to conversational overlaps  at base , they are just two different actions unfolding over the same time period .",
    "the cited annotation graph structure is thus less explicit about word overlaps than the utf file .",
    "however , if a more explicit symbolic representation of overlaps is desired , specifying that such - and - such a stretch of one speaker turn is associated with such - and - such a stretch of another speaker turn , this can be represented in our framework using the inter - arc linkage method described in  [ sec : multiple ] , or using the extension described in  [ sec : extensions ] .    of course , the same word - boundary - based representation of overlapping turns could also be expressed in annotation graph form , by allowing different speakers transcripts to share certain nodes ( representing the word boundaries at which overlaps start or end ) .",
    "we do not suggest this , since it seems to us to be based on an inappropriate model of overlapping , which will surely cause trouble in the end .    note the use of the",
    "` lexical ' type to include the full form of a contraction .",
    "the utf format employed special syntax for expanding contractions .",
    "no additional ontology was needed in order to do this in the annotation graph .",
    "( a query to find instances of or would simply disjoin over the types . )",
    "note also that it would have been possible to replicate the type system , replacing with for ` speaker 1 ' and for ` speaker 2 ' .",
    "however , we have chosen instead to attribute material to speakers using the type on an arc spanning an entire turn .",
    "the disconnectedness of the graph structure means there can be no ambiguity about the attribution of each component arc to a speaker .",
    "as we have argued , annotation graphs of the kind shown in figure  [ utf ] are actually more general and flexible than the utf files they model .",
    "the utf format imposes a linear structure on the speaker turns and assumes that overlap only occurs at the periphery of a turn .",
    "in contrast , the annotation graph structure is well - behaved for partial word overlap , and it scales up naturally and gracefully to the situation where multiple speakers are talking simultaneously ( e.g.  for transcribing a radio talk - back show with a compere , a telephone interlocutor and a panel of discussants ) .",
    "it also works for arbitrary kinds of overlap ( e.g.  where one speaker turn is fully contained inside another ) , as discussed in the previous section .",
    "the emu speech database system @xcite grew out of the earlier mu+ ( macquarie university ) system @xcite , which was designed to support speech scientists who work with large collections of speech data , such as the australian national database of spoken language [ ] .",
    "emu permits hierarchical annotations arrayed over any number of levels , where each level is a linear ordering .",
    "an annotation resides in a single file linked to an xwaves label file .",
    "the file begins with a declaration of the levels of the hierarchy and the immediate dominance relations .",
    "level utterance level intonational utterance level intermediate intonational level word intermediate level syllable word level phoneme syllable level phonetic phoneme many - to - many    the final line licenses a many - to - many relationship between phonetic segments and phonemes , rather than the usual many - to - one relationship . according to the user s manual ,",
    "this is only advisable at the bottom of the hierarchy , otherwise temporal ambiguities may arise .    at any given level of the hierarchy , the elements may have more than one attribute .",
    "for example , in the following declarations we see that elements at the level may be decorated with and information , while syllables may carry a pitch accent .",
    "label word accent label word text label syllable pitch_accent    the next line sets up a dependency between the level and an xwaves label file linked to esps - formatted audio data .",
    "labfile phonetic : format esps : type segment : mark end : extension lab : time - factor 1000    the declaration distinguishes ` segments ' with duration from ` events ' which are instantaneous . here , the time associated with a segment will mark its endpoint rather than its starting point , as indicated by the declaration .",
    "the timing information from the label file is adopted into the hierarchy ( scaled from @xmath0s to ms ) , and can propagate upwards .",
    "in this way , the end of a phonetic segment may also become the end of a syllable , for example .",
    "the sequence of labels from the xwaves label file is reproduced in the emu annotation , while the timing information remains in the xwaves label file .",
    "therefore the latter file is an essential part of an emu annotation and must be explicitly referenced .",

    "each matrix describes the local properties of some linguistic unit , such as a segment , a syllable , or a syntactic phrase .",
    "the value of an attribute could be atomic ( such as a binary feature or a real number ) , or another ( nested ) avm , or a function .",
    "functions have the ability to traverse one or more binary relations and incorporate values from other avms .",
    "for example , if duration was an attribute of a syllable , its value would be a function subtracting the start time of the first dominated segment from the end time of the last dominated segment .",
    "typically , each level of structure includes these function - valued attributes so that temporal information is correctly propagated and does not need to be stored more than once .",
    "0ex    an example hrg is shown in figure  [ taylor ] .",
    "each box contains an abbreviated form of an avm .",
    "the lines represent the binary relations .",
    "observe , for example , that the phonemes and the surface segments are organized into two sequences , the two parallel lines spanning the bottom of the figure .",
    "each sequence is a distinct binary relation .",
    "the hierarchical structures of the metrical and the syllable trees are two more binary relations .",
    "and the linear ordering of words is still another binary relation .",
    "figure  [ festival ] gives the annotation graph representing the second half of the hrg structure .",
    "given the abundance of arcs and levels , we have expanded the vertical dimension of the nodes , but this is not significant .",
    "node identifiers and time references have been omitted .",
    "like the hrg , the annotation graph represents temporal information only once .",
    "yet unlike the hrg , there is no need to define explicit propagation functions .",
    "a diverse range of annotation models have now been considered .",
    "our provision of annotation graphs for each one already gives a foretaste of the formalism we present in ",
    "[ sec : algebra ] .",
    "however , before launching into the formalism , we want to stand back from the details of the various models , and try to take in the big picture . in this section",
    "we describe a wide variety of architectural issues which we believe should be addressed by any general purpose model for annotating linguistic signals .      in the discussion of childes and",
    "the lacito archiving project above , there were cases where our graph representation had nodes which bore no time reference .",
    "perhaps times were not measured , as in typical annotations of extended recordings where time references might only be given at major phrase boundaries ( c.f .",
    "childes ) . or perhaps time measurements were not applicable in principle , as for phrasal translations ( c.f .  the lacito archiving project ) .",
    "various other possibilities suggest themselves .",
    "we might create a segment - level annotation automatically from a word - level annotation by looking up each word in a pronouncing dictionary and adding an arc for each segment , prior to hand - checking the segment annotations and adding time references to the newly created nodes .",
    "the annotation should remain well - formed ( and therefore usable ) at each step in this enrichment process .    just as the temporal information may be partial ,",
    "so might the label information .",
    "for example , we might label indistinct speech with whatever information is available  `",
    "so - and - so said something here that seems to be two syllables long and begins with a /t/ ' .    beyond these two kinds of partiality ,",
    "there is an even more obvious kind of partiality we should recognize .",
    "an annotated corpus might be annotated in a fragmentary manner .",
    "it might be that only 1% of a certain recording has any bearing on the research question that motivated the collection and annotation work .",
    "therefore , it should be possible to have a well - formed annotation structure with arbitrary amounts of annotation detail at certain interesting loci , and limited or no detail elsewhere .",
    "this is a typical situation in phonetic or sociolinguistic research , where a large body of recordings may be annotated in detail with respect to a single , relatively infrequent phenomenon of interest .",
    "naturally , one could always extract a sub - corpus and annotate that material completely , thereby removing the need for partiality , but this may have undesirable consequences for managing a corpus : ( i ) special intervention is required each time one wants to expand the sub - corpus as the research progresses ; ( ii ) it is difficult to make annotations of a sub - corpus available to someone working on a related research question with an overlapping sub - corpus , and updates can not be propagated easily ; ( iii ) provenance issues arise , e.g.  it may be difficult to identify the origin of any given fragment , in case access to broader context is necessary to retrieve the value of some other independent variable one might need to know ; and ( iv ) it is difficult to combine the various contributions into the larger task of annotating a standard corpus for use in perpetuity .    by pointing out these problems",
    "we do not mean to suggest that all annotations of a corpus should be physically or logically combined .",
    "on the contrary , even with one physical copy of a corpus , we would want to allow several independent ( partial ) annotations to coexist , where these may be owned by different people and stored remotely from each other . nor",
    "do we wish to suggest that the creation of sub - corpora is never warranted .",
    "the point is simply that an annotation formalism should not force users to create a derived corpus just so that a partial annotation is well - formed .",
    "existing annotated speech corpora always involve a hierarchy of several levels of annotation , even if they do not focus on very elaborate types of linguistic structure .",
    "timit has sentences , words and phonetic segments ; a broadcast news corpus may have designated levels for shows , stories , speaker turns , sentences and words .",
    "some annotations may express much more elaborate hierarchies , with multiple hierarchies sometimes created for a single underlying body of speech data .",
    "for example , the switchboard corpus of conversational speech @xcite began with the three basic levels : conversation , speaker turn , and word .",
    "various parts of it have since been annotated for syntactic structure @xcite , for breath groups and disfluencies @xcite , for speech act type @xcite , and for phonetic segments @xcite .",
    "these various annotations have been done as separate efforts , and presented in formats that are fairly easy to process one - by - one , but difficult to compare or combine .",
    "considering the variety of approaches that have been adopted , it is possible to identify at least three general methods for encoding hierarchical information .",
    "token - based hierarchy : :    here , hierarchical relations among annotations are explicitly marked    with respect to particular tokens : ` this particular segment is a    daughter of this particular syllable . '",
    "systems that have adopted this    approach include partitur , emu and festival .",
    "type - based hierarchy : :    here , hierarchical information is given with respect to types     whether once and for all in the database , or ad hoc by a user , or    both .",
    "in effect , this means that a grammar of some sort is specified ,    which induces ( additional ) structure in the annotation .",
    "this allows    ( for instance ) the subordination of syllables to words to be    indicated , but only as a general fact about all syllables and words ,    not as a specific fact about particular syllables and words .",
    "an sgml    dtd is an example of this : it specifies a context - free grammar for any    textual markup that uses it . in some cases ,",
    "the hierarchical structure    of a particular stretch of sgml markup can not be determined without    reference to the applicable dtd .",
    "graph - based hierarchy : :    here , annotations are akin to the arcs in so - called ` parse charts '    @xcite .",
    "a parse chart is a particular kind of acyclic digraph , which    starts with a string of words and then adds a set of arcs representing    hypotheses about constituents dominating various substrings . in such a    graph , if the substring spanned by arc @xmath1 properly    contains the substring spanned by arc @xmath2 , then the    constituent corresponding to @xmath1 must dominate the    constituent corresponding to @xmath2 ( though of course other    structures may intervene ) .",
    "hierarchical relationships are encoded in a    parse chart only to the extent that they are implied by this    graph - wise inclusion  thus two arcs spanning the same substring are    unspecified as to their hierarchical relationship , and arcs ordered by    temporal inclusion acquire a hierarchical relationship even when this    is not appropriate given the types of those arcs ( though a grammar ,    external to the parse chart for a particular sentence , may settle the    matter ; see also  [ sec : hierarchy - local ] ) .",
    "+    as we have seen , many sorts of linguistic annotations are naturally    encoded as graph structures with labeled arcs and time - marked nodes .",
    "such a representation arises naturally from the fact that elementary    annotations are predicates about stretches of signal .",
    "thus in our    timit example , we can construe the underlying sequence of audio    samples as a sort of terminal string , with annotations representing    hypotheses about constituents of various types that dominate    designated subsequences .",
    "in the example cited , the word ` she ' spans    the sequence from sample 2360 to sample 5200 ; the phoneme /sh/ spans    the sequence from 2360 to 3720 ; and the phoneme /iy/ spans the    sequence from 3720 to 5200 .",
    "this graph structure itself implies a sort    of hierarchical structure based on temporal inclusion .",
    "if we interpret    it as a parse chart , it tells us that the word ` she ' dominates the    phoneme sequence /sh",
    "iy/. examples of annotation systems that encode    hierarchy using this approach are timit , childes and delta @xcite .",
    "( note that , once equipped with the full annotation graph formalism , we    will be able to distinguish graph - based and time - based inclusion ,    conflated here . )",
    "a particular system may present some mixture of the above techniques .",
    "thus an sgml labeled bracketing may specify an unambiguous token - based hierarchy , with the applicable dtd grammar being just a redundant type - based check ; but in some cases , the dtd may be necessary to determine the structure of a particular stretch of markup .",
    "similarly , the graph structures implicit in timit s annotation files do not tell us , for the word spelled ` i ' and pronounced /ay/ , whether the word dominates the phoneme or vice versa ; but the structural relationship is implicit in the general relationship between the two types of annotations .    an annotation framework ( or its implementation ) may also choose to incorporate arbitrary amounts of redundant encoding of structural information .",
    "it is often convenient to add redundant links explicitly  from children to parents , from parents to children , from one child to the next in order , and so on  so that a program can navigate the structure in a way that is clearer or more efficient .",
    "although such redundant links can be specified in the basic annotation itself  as in _ festival _  they might equally well be added automatically , as part of a compilation or indexing process .",
    "in our view , the addition of this often - useful but predictable structure should not be an intrinsic part of the definition of general - purpose annotation structures .",
    "we want to distinguish the annotation formalism itself from various enriched data structures with redundant encoding of hierarchical structure , just as we would distinguish it from various indices for convenient searching of labels and label sequences .    in considering how to encode hierarchical information ,",
    "we start from the premise that our representation will include some sort of graph structure , simply because this is the most fundamental and natural sort of linguistic annotation . given this approach , hierarchical structure can often be read off the annotation graph structure , as was suggested informally above and will be discussed more thoroughly in  [ sec : algebra ] .",
    "for many applications , this will be enough . for the residual cases",
    ", we might add either type - based or token - based encoding of hierarchical information ( see  [ sec : extensions ] ) .",
    "based on the formal precedent of sgml , the model of how chart - like data structures are actually used in parsing , and the practical precedents of databases like timit , it is tempting to consider adding a sort of grammar over arc labels as part of the formal definition of annotation graphs .",
    "however , in the absence of carefully - evaluated experience with circumstances in which this move is motivated , we prefer to leave this as something to be added by particular applications rather than incorporated into the formalism . in any case",
    ", we shall argue later ( see  [ sec : multiple ] ) that we need a more general method to encode optional relationships among particular arcs .",
    "this method permits token - based marking of hierarchical structure as a special case .",
    "we also need to mention that particular applications in the areas of creation , query and display of annotations may be most naturally organized in ways that motivate a user interface based on a different sort of data structure than the one we are proposing .",
    "for instance , it may sometimes be easier to create annotations in terms of tree - like dominance relations rather than chart - like constituent extents , for instance in doing syntactic tree - banking @xcite .",
    "it may likewise be easier in some cases to define queries explicitly in terms of tree structures . and finally , it may sometimes be more helpful to display trees rather than equivalent annotation graphs ",
    "the festival example in ",
    "[ sec : festival ] was a case in point .",
    "we believe that such user interface issues will vary from application to application , and may even depend on the tastes of individuals in some cases . in any case , decisions about such user interface issues are separable from decisions about the appropriate choice of basic database structures .",
    "in addition to the hierarchical and sequential structuring of information about linguistic signals , we also have parallel structuring .",
    "nowhere is this clearer than in the gestural score notation used to describe the articulatory component of words and phrases ( e.g.  @xcite ) . a gestural score maps out the time course of the gestural events created by the articulators of the vocal tract .",
    "this representation expresses the fact that the articulators move independently and that the segments we observe are the result of particular timing relationships between the gestures .",
    "figure  [ tenpin3 ] gives the annotation graph for a gestural score .",
    "it shows the activity of the velum , the tongue tip and the lips .",
    "this example stands in stark contrast to the hierarchical structures discussed in the previous section .",
    "here there is no hierarchical relationship between the streams .    ' '' ''",
    "another important difference between hierarchical and parallel structures needs to be drawn here .",
    "suppose that two labeled periods of an annotation begin ( or end ) at the same time .",
    "the alignment of two such boundaries might be necessary , or pure coincidence .",
    "as an example of necessary alignment , consider the case of phrase - initial words . here",
    ", the left boundary of a phrase lines up with the left boundary of its initial word . changing",
    "the time of the phrase boundary should change the time of the word boundary , and vice versa . in the general case ,",
    "an update of this sort must propagate both upwards and downwards in the hierarchy .",
    "in fact , we argue that these two pieces of annotation actually _ share _ the same boundary : their arcs emanate from a single node . changing the time reference of that node does not need to propagate anywhere , since the information is already shared by the relevant arcs .    as an example of coincidental alignment ,",
    "consider the case of gestural scores once more .",
    "in 100 annotated recordings of the same utterance we might find that the boundaries of different gestures occasionally coincide .",
    "an example of this appears in figure  [ tenpin3 ] , where nodes 12 and 22 have the same time reference .",
    "however , this alignment is a contingent fact about a particular utterance token .",
    "an edit operation which changed the start time of one gesture would usually carry no implication for the start time of some other gesture .",
    "even though a linguistic event might have duration , such as the attainment of a pitch target , the most perspicuous annotation may be tied to an instant rather than an interval .",
    "some annotation formalisms ( e.g.  emu , festival , partitur ) provide a way to label instants .",
    "the alignment of these instants with respect to other instants or intervals can then be investigated or exploited .",
    "there are at least five conceivable approaches to labeled instants ( note that this is not a mutually exclusive set ) :    1 .",
    "nodes could be optionally labeled ; or 2 .",
    "an instant can be modeled as a self - loop on a node , and again labeled just like any other arc ; or 3 .",
    "instants can be treated as arcs between two nodes with the same time reference ; or 4 .",
    "instants can be treated as short periods , where these are labeled arcs just like any other ; or 5 .",
    "certain types of labels on periods could be interpreted as referring to the commencement or the culmination of that period .    with little evidence on which to base a decision between these options we opt for the most conservative , which is the one embodied in the last two options .",
    "thus with no extension to the ontology we already have two ways to model instants .",
    "as we have seen , annotations are often stratified , where each layer describes a different property of a signal .",
    "what are the possible temporal relationships between the pieces of a given layer ?",
    "some possibilities are diagrammed in figure  [ layer ] , where a point is represented as a vertical bar , and an interval is represented as a horizontal line between two points .    ' '' ''    in the first row of figure  [ layer ] , we see a layer which exhaustively partitions the time - flow into a sequence of non - overlapping intervals ( or perhaps intervals which overlap just at their endpoints ) . in the second row",
    "we see a layer of discrete instants .",
    "the next two rows illustrate the notions of gaps and overlaps .",
    "gaps might correspond to periods of silence , or to periods in between the salient events , or to periods which have yet to be annotated .",
    "overlaps occur between speaker turns in discourse ( see figure  [ callhome ] ) or even between adjacent words in a single speech stream ( see figure  [ links]a ) .",
    "the fifth row illustrates a hierarchical grouping of intervals within a layer ( c.f .",
    "the arcs in figure  [ festival ] ) .",
    "the final row contains an arbitrary set of intervals and instants .",
    "we adopt this last option ( minus the instants ) as the most general case for the layer of an annotation .",
    "as we shall see , layers themselves will not be treated specially ; a layer can be thought of simply as the collection of arcs sharing the same type information .",
    "it is often the case that a given stretch of speech has multiple possible labels .",
    "for example , the region of speech corresponding to a monosyllabic word is both a syllable and a word , and in some cases it may also be a complete utterance .",
    "the combination of two independent annotations into a single annotation ( through set union ) may also result in two labels covering the same extent .    in the general case",
    ", a label could be a ( typed ) attribute - value matrix , possibly incorporating nested structure , list- and set - valued attributes , and even disjunction . however , our hypothesis is that typed labels ( with atomic types and labels ) are sufficient .",
    "multiple labels spanning the same material reside on their own arcs .",
    "their endpoints can be varied independently ( see  [ sec : scores ] ) , and the combining and projection of annotations does not require the merging and splitting of arcs .",
    "an apparent weakness of this conception is that we have no way of individuating arcs , and it is not possible for arcs to reference each other .",
    "however , there are cases when such links between arcs are necessary .",
    "three examples are displayed in figure  [ links ] ; we discuss each in turn .    ' '' ''    recall from ",
    "[ sec : scores ] that an annotation graph can contain several independent streams of information , where no nodes are shared between the streams .",
    "the temporal extents of the gestures in the different streams are almost entirely asynchronous ; any equivalences are likely to be coincidences . however , these gestures may still have determinate abstract connections to elements of a phonological analysis .",
    "thus a velar opening and closing gesture may be associated with a particular nasal feature , or with a set of nasal features , or with the sequence of changes from non - nasal to nasal and back again . but",
    "these associations can not usually be established purely as a matter of temporal coincidence , since the phonological features involved are bundled together into other units ( segments or syllables or whatever ) containing other features that connect to other gestures whose temporal extents are all different .",
    "the rules of coordination for such gestures involve phase relations and physical spreading which are completely arbitrary from the perspective of the representational framework .",
    "a simplified example of the arbitrary relationship between the gestures comprising a word is illustrated in figure  [ links]a .",
    "we have the familiar annotation structure ( taken from figure  [ tenpin3 ] ) , enriched with information about which words license which gestures . the words are shown as overlapping , although this is not crucially required . in the general case ,",
    "the relationship between words and their gestures is not predictable from the temporal structure and the type structure alone .",
    "the example in figure  [ links]b shows a situation where we have multiple independent transcriptions of the same data . in this case",
    ", the purpose is to compare the performance of different transcribers on identical material .",
    "although the intervals do not line up exactly , an obvious correspondence exists between the labels and it should be possible to navigate between corresponding labels , even though their precise temporal relationship is somewhat arbitrary . observe that the cross references do not have equivalent status here ; the relationship between and is not the same as that between and .",
    "the final example , figure  [ links]c , shows an annotation graph based on the hayu example from figure  [ archivage ] .",
    "we would like to be able to navigate between words of a phrasal translation and the corresponding hayu words .",
    "this would be useful , for example , to study the various ways in which a particular hayu word is idiomatically translated .",
    "note that the temporal relationship between linked elements is much more chaotic here , and that there are examples of one - to - many and many - to - many mappings .",
    "the words being mapped do not even need to be contiguous subsequences .",
    "one obvious way to address these three examples is to permit arc labels to carry cross - references to other arc labels .",
    "the semantics of such cross - references might be left up to the individual case .",
    "this requires at least some arcs to be individuated ( as all nodes are already ) . while it would be a simple matter to individuate arcs ( c.f .  ",
    "[ sec : extensions ] ) , this step is not forced on us . there is another approach that stays more nearly within the confines of the existing formalism . in this approach",
    ", we treat all of the cases described above in terms of equivalence classes . one way to formalize a set of equivalence classes is as an ordered pair : class - type : identifier .",
    "but this is just our label notation all over again  the only news is that for label types interpreted as denoting equivalence classes , different labels with the same identifier are viewed as forming an equivalence class .",
    "another way to put this is that two ( or more ) labels are connected not by referencing one another , but by jointly referencing a particular equivalence class .    in the general case",
    ", we have @xmath3 partially independent strands , where the material to be associated comes from some subset of the strands . within a given strand , zero",
    ", one or more arcs may participate in a given association , and the arcs are not necessarily contiguous . for the gestural score in figure  [ links]a we augment each arc with a second arc having the same span .",
    "these additional arcs all carry the type and the unique labels ( say ) and , depending on which word they belong to .",
    "the word arcs are also supplemented : with and with .",
    "see figure  [ links2]a .",
    "now we can easily navigate around the set of gestures licensed by a word regardless of their temporal extent .",
    "we can use the type information on the existing labels in situations where we care about the directionality of the association .    ' '' ''",
    "this approach can be applied to the other cases , with some further qualifications . for figure  [ links]b ,",
    "there is more than one option , as shown in figure  [ links2]b , b. in the first option , we have a single cross - reference , while in the second option , we have two cross - references .",
    "we could combine both of these into a single graph containing three cross - references .",
    "the translation case of figure  [ links]c can be treated in the same way .",
    "if the phrasal translation of a word is a continuous stretch , it could be covered by multiple arcs ( one for each existing arc ) , or it could be covered by just a single arc . if the phrasal translation of a word is not a contiguous stretch , we may be forced to attach more than one diacritic arc with a given label .",
    "we do not anticipate any adverse consequences of such a move .",
    "incidentally , note that this linked multiple stream representation is employed in an actual machine translation system @xcite .",
    "observe that this construction involves assigning intervals ( node - pairs ) rather than arcs to equivalence classes . in cases where there are multiple independent cross references ,",
    "it is conceivable that we might have distinct equivalence classes involving different arcs which span the same two nodes .",
    "so long as these arcs are distinguished by their types we do not foresee a problem .",
    "this section has described three situations where potentially complex relationships between arc labels are required .",
    "however , we have demonstrated that the existing formalism is sufficiently expressive to encompass such relationships , and so we are able to preserve the simplicity of the model . despite this simplicity",
    ", there is one way in which the approach may seem profligate .",
    "there are no less than three ways for a pair of arcs to be ` associated ' : temporal overlap , hierarchy , and equivalence - class linkages .",
    "interestingly , this three - way possibility exactly mirrors the three ways that association is treated in the phonological literature .",
    "there , association is first and foremost a graphical notion . from context",
    "it is usually possible to tell whether the line drawn between two items indicates temporal overlap , a hierarchical relationship , or some more abstract , logical relationship @xcite .",
    "we have shown how all three uses are attested in the realm of linguistic annotation .",
    "the fact that the three conceptions of association are distinct and attested is sufficient cause for us to include all three in the formalism , notwithstanding the fact that we get them for free .",
    "an ` annotated corpus ' is a set of annotation graphs and an associated body of time series data .",
    "the time series might comprise one or more audio tracks , one or more video streams , one or more streams of physiological data of various types , and so forth .",
    "the data might be sampled at a fixed rate , or might consist of pairs of times and values , for irregularly spaced times .",
    "different streams will typically have quite different sampling rates .",
    "some streams might be defined only intermittently , as in the case of a continuous audio recording with intermittent physiological or imaging data .",
    "this is not an imagined list of conceptually possible types of data  we are familiar with corpora with all of the properties cited .",
    "the time series data will be packaged into a set of one or more files .",
    "depending on the application , these files may have some more or less complex internal structure , with headers or other associated information about type , layout and provenance of the data .",
    "these headers may correspond to some documented open standard , or they may be embedded in a proprietary system .",
    "the one thing that ties all of the time series data together is a shared time base . to use these arbitrarily diverse data streams , we need to be able to line them up time - wise .",
    "this shared time base is also the only pervasive and systematic connection such data is likely to have with annotations of the type we are discussing in this paper .",
    "it is not appropriate for an annotation framework to try to encompass the syntax and semantics of all existing time series file formats .",
    "they are simply too diverse and too far from being stable .",
    "however , we do need to be able to specify what time series data we are annotating , and how our annotations align with it , in a way that is clear and flexible .",
    "an ambitious approach would be to specify a new universal framework for the representation of time series data , with a coherent and well - defined semantics , and to insist that all annotated time series data should be translated into this framework .",
    "after all , we are doing the analogous thing for linguistic annotations : proposing a new , allegedly universal framework into which we argue that all annotations can be translated .",
    "such an effort for all time series data , whether or not it is a reasonable thing to do , is far outside the scope of what we are attempting here .    a much simpler and less ambitious way to connect annotation graphs to their associated time series is to introduce arcs that reference particular time - series files , or temporally contiguous sub - parts of such files .",
    "each such arc specifies that the cited portion of data in the cited time - function file lines up with the portion of the annotation graph specified by the time - marks on its source and sink nodes .",
    "arbitrary additional information can be provided , such as an offset relative to the file s intrinsic time base ( if any ) , or a specification selecting certain dimensions of vector - valued data . taking this approach ,",
    "a single annotation could reference multiple files ",
    "some parts of an annotation could refer specifically to a single file , while other parts of an annotation could be non - specific . in this way ,",
    "events that are specific to a channel ( like a particular speaker turn ) can be marked as such .",
    "equally , annotation content for an event which is not specific to a channel can be stored just once .",
    "these file - related labels , if properly designed and implemented , will permit an application to recover the time - series data that corresponds to a given piece of annotation  at least to the extent that the annotation is time - marked and that any time - function files have been specified for the cited subgraph(s ) . thus if time - marking is provided at the speaker - turn level ( as is often the case for published conversational data ) , then a search for all the instances of a specified word string will enable us to recover usable references to all available time - series data for the turn that contains each of these word strings .",
    "the information will be provided in the form of file names , time references , and perhaps time offsets ; it will be the responsibility of the application ( or the user ) to resolve these references .",
    "if time - marking has been done at the word level , then the same query will enable us to recover a more exact set of temporal references in the same set of files .",
    "our preference for the moment is to allow the details of how to define these file - references to fall outside the formalism we are defining here .",
    "it should be clear that there are simple and natural ways to establish the sorts of linkages that are explicit in existing types of annotated linguistic database .",
    "after some practical experience , it may make sense to try to provide a more formal account of references to external time - series data .",
    "we would also like to point out a wider problem for which we do not have any general solution .",
    "although it is not our primary focus , we would like the annotation formalism to be extensible to spatially - specific annotations of video signals and similar data , perhaps by enriching the temporal anchors with spatial and/or image - plane information .",
    "anthropologists , conversation analysts , and sign - language researchers are already producing annotations that are ( at least conceptually ) anchored not only to time spans but also to a particular spatial or image - plane trajectory through the corresponding series of video frames .    in the case of simple time - series annotations , we are tagging nodes with absolute time references , perhaps offset by a single constant for a given recorded signal . however , if we are annotating a video recording , the additional anchoring used for annotating video sequences will mostly not be about absolute space , even with some arbitrary shift of coordinate origin , but rather will be coordinates in the image plane . if there are multiple cameras , then image coordinates for each will differ , in a way that time marks for multiple simultaneous recordings do not .",
    "in fact , there are some roughly similar cases in audio annotation , where an annotation might reference some specific two- or three - dimensional feature of ( for instance ) a time - series of short - time amplitude spectra ( i.e.  a spectrogram ) , in which case the quantitative details will depend on the analysis recipe .",
    "our system allows such references ( like any other information ) to be encoded in arc labels , but does not provide any more specific support .      in this context",
    "we ought to raise the question of how annotation graphs relate to various multimedia standards like the synchronized multimedia integration language [ ] and mpeg-4 [ ] .",
    "since these provide ways to specify both temporal and spatial relationships among strings , audio clips , still pictures , video sequences , and so on , one hopes that they will offer support for linguistic annotation .",
    "it is hard to offer a confident evaluation , since mpeg-4 is still in development , and smil s future as a standard is unclear .    with respect to mpeg-4 , we reserve judgment until its characteristics become clearer .",
    "our preliminary assessment is that smil is not useful for purposes of linguistic annotation , because it is mainly focused on presentational issues ( fonts , colors , screen locations , fades and animations , etc . ) and does not in fact offer any natural ways to encode the sorts of annotations that we surveyed in the previous section .",
    "thus it is easy to specify that a certain audio file is to be played while a certain caption fades in , moves across the screen , and fades out .",
    "it is not ( at least straightforwardly ) possible to specify that a certain audio file consists of a certain sequence of conversational turns , temporally aligned in a certain way , which consist in turn of certain sequences of words , etc .",
    "the tipster architecture for linguistic annotation of text @xcite is based on the concept of a fundamental , immutable textual foundation , with all annotations expressed in terms of byte offsets into this text .",
    "this is a reasonable solution for cases where the text is a published given , not subject to revision by annotators .",
    "however , it is not a good solution for speech transcriptions , which are typically volatile entities , constantly up for revision both by their original authors and by others .    in the case of speech transcriptions",
    ", it is more appropriate to treat the basic orthographic transcription as just another annotation , no more formally privileged than a discourse analysis or a translation .",
    "then we are in a much better position to deal with the common practical situation , in which an initial orthographic transcription of speech recordings is repeatedly corrected by independent users , who may also go on to add new types of annotation of their own , and sometimes also adopt new formatting conventions to suit their own display needs .",
    "those who wish to reconcile these independent corrections , and also combine the independent additional annotations , face a daunting task . in this case , having annotations reference byte offsets into transcriptional texts is almost the worst imaginable solution .",
    "although nothing will make it trivial to untangle this situation , we believe our approach comes close .",
    "as we shall see in  [ sec : files ] , our use of a flat , unordered file structure incorporating node identifiers and time references means that edits are as strictly local as they possibly can be , and connections among various types of annotation are as durable as they possibly can be .",
    "some changes are almost completely transparent ( e.g.  changing the spelling of a name ) .",
    "many other changes will turn out not to interact at all with other types of annotation .",
    "when there is an interaction , it is usually the absolute minimum that is necessary .",
    "therefore , keeping track of what corresponds to what , across generations of distributed annotation and revision , is as simple as one can hope to make it .",
    "therefore we conclude that tipster - style byte offsets are an inappropriate choice for use as references to audio transcriptions , except for cases where such transcriptions are immutable in principle .    in the other direction ,",
    "there are several ways to translate tipster - style annotations into our terms",
    ". the most direct way would be to treat tipster byte offsets exactly as analogous to time references  since the only formal requirement on our time references is that they can be ordered .",
    "this method has the disadvantage that the underlying text could not be searched or displayed in the same way that a speech transcription normally could .",
    "a simple solution would be to add an arc for each of the lexical tokens in the original text , retaining the byte offsets on the corresponding nodes for translation back into tipster - architecture terms .",
    "timit and some other extant databases denominate signal time in sample numbers ( relative to a designated signal file , with a known sampling rate ) .",
    "other databases use floating - point numbers , representing time in seconds relative to some fixed offset , or other representations of time such as centiseconds or milliseconds . in our formalization of annotation graphs ,",
    "the only thing that really matters about time references is that they define an ordering .",
    "however , for comparability across signal types , time references need to be intertranslatable .",
    "we feel that time in seconds is generally preferable to sample or frame counts , simply because it is more general and easier to translate across signal representations",
    ". however , there may be circumstances in which exact identification of sample or frame numbers is crucial , and some users may prefer to specify these directly to avoid any possibility of confusion .    technically , sampled data points ( such as audio samples or video frames ) may be said to denote time intervals rather than time points , and the translation between counts and times may therefore become ambiguous .",
    "for instance , suppose we have video data at 30 hz .",
    "should we take the 30th video frame ( counting from one ) to cover the time period from 29/30 to 1 second or from 29.5/30 to 30.5/30 second ? in either case , how should the endpoints of the interval be assigned ?",
    "different choices may shift the correspondence between times and frame numbers slightly .",
    "also , when we have signals at very different sampling rates , a single sampling interval in one signal can correspond to a long sequence of intervals in another signal .",
    "with video at 30 hz and audio at 44.1 khz , each video frame corresponds to 1,470 audio samples .",
    "suppose we have a time reference of .9833 seconds .",
    "a user might want to know whether this was created because some event was flagged in the 29th video frame , for which we take the mean time point to be 29.5/30 seconds , or because some event was flagged at the 43,365th audio sample , for which we take the central time point to be 43365.5/44100 seconds .    for reasons like these , some users might want the freedom to specify references explicitly in terms of sample or frame numbers , rather than relying on an implicit method of translation to and from time in seconds .    several ways to accommodate this within our framework come to mind , but we prefer to leave this open , as we have no experience with applications in which this might be an issue . in our initial explorations , we are simply using time in seconds as the basis .",
    "looking at the practice of speech transcription and annotation across many existing ` communities of practice ' , we see commonality of abstract form along with diversity of concrete format .",
    "all annotations of recorded linguistic signals require one unavoidable basic action : to associate a label , or an ordered sequence of labels , with a stretch of time in the recording(s ) .",
    "such annotations also typically distinguish labels of different types , such as spoken words vs.  non - speech noises .",
    "different types of annotation often span different - sized stretches of recorded time , without necessarily forming a strict hierarchy : thus a conversation contains ( perhaps overlapping ) conversational turns , turns contain ( perhaps interrupted ) words , and words contain ( perhaps shared ) phonetic segments .",
    "a minimal formalization of this basic set of practices is a directed graph with typed labels on the arcs and optional time references on the nodes .",
    "we believe that this minimal formalization in fact has sufficient expressive capacity to encode , in a reasonably intuitive way , all of the kinds of linguistic annotations in use today .",
    "we also believe that this minimal formalization has good properties with respect to creation , maintenance and searching of annotations .    our strategy is to see how far this simple conception can go , resisting where possible the temptation to enrich its ontology of formal devices , or to establish label types with special syntax or semantics as part of the formalism .",
    "see section ",
    "[ sec : extensions ] for a perspective on how to introduce formal and substantive extensions into practical applications .",
    "we maintain that most , if not all , existing annotation formats can naturally be treated , without loss of generality , as directed acyclic graphs having typed labels on ( some of ) the edges and time - marks on ( some of ) the vertices .",
    "we call these ` annotation graphs ' .",
    "it is important to recognize that translation into annotation graphs does not magically create compatibility among systems whose semantics are different . for instance",
    ", there are many different approaches to transcribing filled pauses in english  each will translate easily into an annotation graph framework , but their semantic incompatibility is not thereby erased .    it is not our intention here to specify annotations at the level of permissible tags , attributes , and values , as was done by many of the models surveyed in  [ sec : survey ] .",
    "this is an application - specific issue which does not belong in the formalism .",
    "the need for this distinction can be brought into sharp focus by analogy with database systems .",
    "consider the relationship between the abstract notion of a relational algebra , the features of a relational database system , and the characteristics of a particular database .",
    "for example , the definition of substantive notions like ` date ' does not belong in the relational algebra , though there is good reason for a database system to have a special data type for dates .",
    "moreover , a particular database may incorporate all manner of restrictions on dates and relations among them .",
    "the formalization presented here is targeted at the most abstract level : we want to get the annotation formalism right .",
    "we assume that system implementations will add all kinds of special - case data types ( i.e.  types of labels with specialized syntax and semantics ) .",
    "we further assume that particular databases will want to introduce additional specifications .    our current strategy  given",
    "the relative lack of experience of the field in dealing with such matters  is to start with a general model with very few special label types , and an open mechanism for allowing users to impose essentially arbitrary interpretations .",
    "this is how we deal with instants ( c.f .  ",
    "[ sec : instants ] ) , associations between annotations and files ( c.f .  ",
    "[ sec : associations ] ) and coindexing of arcs ( c.f .  ",

    "let @xmath4 be a set of types , where each type in @xmath4 has a ( possibly open ) set of contentful elements .",
    "the label space @xmath5 is the union of all these sets .",
    "we write each label as a pair , allowing the same contentful element to occur in different types .",
    "( so , for example , the phoneme /a/ and the phonetic segment [ a ] can be distinguished as vs . ) annotation graphs are now defined as follows :    an * annotation graph * @xmath6 over a label set @xmath5 and a node set @xmath7 is a set of triples having the form @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , which satisfies the following conditions :    1 .",
    "@xmath11 is a directed acyclic graph .",
    "@xmath12 is an order - preserving map assigning times to some of the nodes .",
    "there is no requirement that annotation graphs be connected or rooted , or that they cover the whole time course of the linguistic signal they describe .",
    "the set of annotation graphs is closed under union , intersection and relative complement .    for convenience",
    ", we shall refer to nodes which have a time reference ( i.e.  @xmath13 ) as _ anchored nodes_. it will also be useful to talk about annotation graphs which are minimally anchored , in the sense defined below :    an * anchored annotation graph * @xmath6 over a label set @xmath5 and a node set @xmath7 is an annotation graph satisfying two additional conditions :    1 .",
    "if @xmath14 is such that @xmath15 for any @xmath16 , @xmath17 , then @xmath18 ; 2 .   if @xmath14 is such that @xmath19 for any @xmath16 , @xmath17 , then @xmath18 .",
    "anchored annotation graphs have no dangling arcs ( or chains ) leading to an indeterminate time point .",
    "it follows from this definition that , for any unanchored node , we can reach an anchored node by following a chain of arcs .",
    "in fact every path from an unanchored node will finally take us to an anchored node .",
    "likewise , an unanchored node can be reached from an anchored node .",
    "a key property of anchored annotation graphs is that we are guaranteed to have some information about the temporal locus of every node .",
    "this property will be made explicit in  [ sec : time - local ] .",
    "an examination of the annotation graphs in ",
    "[ sec : survey ] will reveal that they are all anchored annotation graphs .",
    "note that the set of anchored annotation graphs is closed under union , but not under intersection or relative complement .",
    "we can also define a _ totally - anchored annotation graph _ as one in which @xmath20 is a total function .",
    "the annotation graphs in figures  [ timit ] , [ partitur ] , [ chat2 ] and [ emu1 ] are all totally - anchored .    equipped with this three - element hierarchy",
    ", we will insist that the annotation graphs that are the primary objects in linguistic databases are anchored annotation graphs .",
    "for the sake of a clean algebraic semantics for the query language , we will permit queries and the results of queries to be ( sets of ) arbitrary annotation graphs .",
    "the following definition lets us talk about two kinds of precedence relation on nodes in the graph structure .",
    "the first kind respects the graph structure ( ignoring the time references ) , and is called structure precedence , or simply _ s - precedence_. the second kind respects the temporal structure ( ignoring the graph structure ) , and is called temporal precedence , or simply _",
    "t - precedence_.    a node @xmath21 * s - precedes * a node @xmath22 , written @xmath23 , if there is a chain from @xmath21 to @xmath22 . a node @xmath21 * t - precedes * a node @xmath22 , written @xmath24 , if @xmath25 .",
    "observe that both these relations are transitive .",
    "there is a more general notion of precedence which mixes both relations .",
    "for example , we can infer that node @xmath21 precedes node @xmath22 if we can use a mixture of structural and temporal information to get from @xmath21 to @xmath22 .",
    "this idea is formalized in the next definition .",
    "* precedence * is a binary relation on nodes , written @xmath26 , which is the transitive closure of the union of the s - precedes and the t - precedes relations .",
    "armed with these definitions we can now define some useful inclusion relations on arcs .",
    "the first kind of inclusion respects the graph structure , so it is called _ s - inclusion_. the second kind , _ t - inclusion _ , respects the temporal structure .",
    "an arc @xmath27 * s - includes * an arc @xmath28 , written @xmath29 , if @xmath23 and @xmath30 . @xmath31 *",
    "t - includes * @xmath32 , written @xmath33 , if @xmath24 and @xmath34 .    as with node precedence ,",
    "we define a general notion of inclusion which generalizes over these two types :    * inclusion * is a binary relation on arcs , written @xmath35 , which is the transitive closure of the union of the s - inclusion and the t - inclusion relations .",
    "note that all three inclusion relations are reflexive and transitive .",
    "we assume the existence of non - strict precedence and inclusion relations , defined in the obvious way .",
    "it is convenient to have a variety of ways of visualizing annotation graphs .",
    "most of the systems we surveyed in ",
    "[ sec : survey ] come with visualization components , whether tree - based , extent - based , or some combination of these .",
    "we would endorse the use of any descriptively adequate visual notation in concert with the annotation graph formalism , so long as the notation can be endowed with an explicit formal semantics in terms of annotation graphs .",
    "note , however , that not all such visual notations can represent everything an annotation graph contains , so we still need one or more general - purpose visualizations for annotation graphs .    the primary visualization chosen for annotation graphs in this paper uses networks of nodes and arcs to make the point that the mathematical objects we are dealing with are graphs . in most practical situations , this mode of visualization is cumbersome to the point of being useless .",
    "visualization techniques should be optimized for each type of data and for each application , but there are some general techniques that can be cited .",
    "observe that the direction of time - flow can be inferred from the left - to - right layout of annotation graphs , and so the arrow - heads are redundant . for simple connected sequences ( e.g.  of words )",
    "the linear structure of nodes and arcs is not especially informative ; it is better to write the labels in sequence and omit the graph structure .",
    "the ubiquitous node identifiers should not be displayed unless there is accompanying text that refers to specific nodes .",
    "label types can be effectively distinguished with colors , typefaces or vertical position .",
    "we will usually need to break an annotation graph into chunks which can be presented line - by - line ( much like interlinear text ) in order to fit on a screen or a page .",
    "the applicability of these techniques depends on the fact that annotation graphs have a number of properties that do not follow automatically from a graphical notation . in other words , many directed acyclic graphs are not well - formed annotation graphs .",
    "two properties are of particular interest here .",
    "first , as noted in  [ sec : formalism ] , all the annotation graphs we have surveyed are actually anchored annotation graphs .",
    "this means that every arc lies on a path of arcs that is bounded at both ends by time references .",
    "so , even when most nodes lack a time reference , we can still associate such chains with an interval of time .",
    "a second property , more contingent but equally convenient , is that annotation graphs appear to be ` rightward planar ' , i.e.  they can be drawn in such a way that no arcs cross and each arc is monotonically increasing in the rightwards direction ( c.f .",
    "the definition of upward planarity in @xcite ) .",
    "these properties are put to good use in figure  [ visual ] , which employs a score notation ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ) .    ' '' ''    the conventions employed by these diagrams are as follows .",
    "an arc is represented by a shaded rectangle , where the shading ( or color , if available ) represents the type information .",
    "where possible , arcs having the same type are displayed on the same level .",
    "arcs are labeled , but the type information is omitted .",
    "inter - arc linkages ( see  [ sec : multiple ] ) are represented using coindexing .",
    "the ends of arcs are represented using short vertical lines having the same width as the rectangles .",
    "these may be omitted if the tokenization of a string is predictable .",
    "if two arcs are incident on the same node but their corresponding rectangles appear on different levels of the diagram , then the relevant endpoints are connected by a solid line .",
    "for ease of external reference , these lines can be decorated with a node identifier .",
    "anchored nodes are connected to the timeline with dotted lines .",
    "the point of intersection is labeled with a time reference . if necessary",
    ", multiple timelines may be used .",
    "nodes sharing a time reference are connected with a dotted line . in order to fit on a page",
    ", these diagrams may be cut at any point , with any partial rectangles labeled on both parts .",
    "unlike some other conceivable visualizations ( such as the tree diagrams and autosegmental diagrams used by festival and emu ) , this scheme emphasizes the fact that each component of an annotation has temporal extent .",
    "the scheme neatly handles the cases where temporal information is partial .      as stated at the outset , we believe that the standardization of file formats is a secondary issue .",
    "the identification of a common conceptual framework underlying all work in this area is an earlier milestone along any path to standardization of formats and tools .",
    "that said , we believe that file formats should be transparent encodings of the annotation structure .",
    "the flattest data structure we can imagine for an annotation graph is a set of 3-tuples , one per arc , consisting of a node identifier , a label , and another node identifier .",
    "this data structure has a transparent relationship to our definition of annotation graphs , and we shall refer to it as the ` basic encoding ' .",
    "node identifiers are supplemented with time values , where available , and are wrapped with angle brackets .",

    "the same goes for the addition of new arcs between existing nodes . for the user adding new annotation data to an existing read - only corpus  a widespread mode of operation ",
    "the new data can reside in one or more separate files , to be concatenated at load time .",
    "the insertion and modification of labels for existing arcs involves changing one line of the basic encoding .",
    "adding , changing or deleting a time reference may involve non - local change to the basic encoding of an annotation .",
    "this can be done in either of two ways : a linear scan through the basic encoding , searching for all instances of the node identifier ; or indexing into the basic encoding using the time - local index to find the relevant lines .",
    "of course , the time reference could be localized in the basic encoding by having a separate node set , referenced by the arc set .",
    "this would permit the time reference of a node to be stored just once .",
    "however , we prefer to keep the basic encoding as simple as possible .",
    "maintaining consistency of the temporal and hierarchical structure of an annotation under updates requires further consideration . in the worst case",
    ", an entire annotation structure would have to be validated after each update .",
    "to the extent that information can be localized , it is to be expected that incremental validation will be possible .",
    "this might apply after each and every update , or after a collection of updates in case there is a sequence of elementary updates which unavoidably takes us to an invalid structure along the way to a final , valid structure .",
    "our approach to the file encoding has some interesting implications in the area of so - called ` standoff markup ' @xcite . under our proposed scheme , a readonly file containing a reference annotation",
    "can be concatenated with a file containing additional annotation material . in order for the new material to be linked to the existing material",
    ", it simply has to reuse the same node identifiers and/or have nodes anchored to the same time base .",
    "annotation deltas can employ a ` diff ' method operating at the level of individual arcs .",
    "since the file contains one line per arc and since arcs are unordered , no context needs to be specified other than the line which is being replaced or modified .",
    "a consequence of our approach is that all speech annotation ( in the broad sense ) can be construed as ` standoff ' description .",
    "corpora of annotated texts and recorded signals may range in size from a few thousand words up into the billions .",
    "the data may be in the form of a monolithic file , or it may be cut up into word - size pieces , or anything in between",
    ". the annotation might be dense as in phonetic markup or sparse as in discourse markup , and the information may be uniformly or sporadically distributed through the data .    at present , the annotational components of most speech databases are still relatively small objects .",
    "only the largest annotations would cover a whole hour of speech ( or 12,000 words at 200 words per minute ) , and even then , a dense annotation of this much material would only occupy a few hundred kilobytes . in most cases , serial search of such annotations will suffice .",
    "ultimately , however , it will be necessary to devise indexing schemes ; these will necessarily be application - specific , depending on the nature of the corpus and of the queries to be expressed .",
    "the indexing method is not a property of the query language but a way to make certain kinds of query run efficiently . for large corpora , certain kinds of query might be essentially useless without such indexing .    at the level of individual arc labels , we envision three simple indexes , corresponding to the three obvious dimensions of an annotation graph : a time - local index , a type - local index and a hierarchy - local index .",
    "these are discussed below .",
    "more sophisticated indexing schemes could surely be devised , for instance to support proximity search on node labels .",
    "we also assume the existence of an index for node identifiers ; a simple approach would be to sort the lines of the annotation file with respect to an ordering on the node identifiers .",
    "note that , since we wish to index linguistic databases , and not queries or query results , the indexes will assume that annotation graphs are anchored .",
    "we index the annotation graph in terms of the intervals it employs .",
    "let @xmath36 be the sequence of time references used by the annotation .",
    "we form the intervals @xmath37 .",
    "next , we assign each arc to a contiguous set of these intervals .",
    "suppose that an arc is incident on nodes which are anchored to time points @xmath38 and @xmath39 , where @xmath40 .",
    "then we assign the arc to the following set of intervals : @xmath41 now we generalize this construction to work when a time reference is missing from either or both of the nodes .",
    "first we define the _ greatest lower bound ( glb ) _ and the _ least upper bound ( lub ) _ of an arc .",
    "let @xmath42 be an arc .",
    "* @xmath43 * is the greatest time reference @xmath44 such that there is some node @xmath3 with @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "* @xmath47 * is the least time reference @xmath44 such that there is some node @xmath3 with @xmath45 and @xmath48 .    according to this definition ,",
    "the _ glb _ of an arc is the time mark of the ` greatest ' anchored node from which the arc is reachable .",
    "similarly , the _ lub _ of an arc is the time mark of the ` least ' anchored node reachable from that arc .",
    "if @xmath42 is anchored at both ends then @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "the _ glb _ and _ lub _ are guaranteed to exist for anchored annotation graphs ( but not for annotation graphs in general ) .",
    "the _ glb _ and _ lub _ are guaranteed to be unique since @xmath51 is a total ordering .",
    "we can take the _ potential _ temporal span of an arc @xmath52 to be @xmath53 .",
    "we then assign the arc to a set of intervals as before .",

    "more broadly , the design of an application - specific indexing scheme will have to consider what kinds of sequences or connections among tokens are indexed . in general , the indexing method should be based on the same elementary structures from which queries are constructed .",
    "indices will specify where particular elementary annotation graphs are to be found , so a complex search expression can be limited to those regions for which these graphs are necessary parts .",
    "there are many existing approaches to linguistic annotation , and many options for future approaches .",
    "any evaluation of proposed frameworks , including ours , depends on the costs and benefits incurred in a range of expected applications .",
    "our explorations have presupposed a particular set of ideas about applications , and therefore a particular set of goals .",
    "we think that these ideas are widely shared , but it seems useful to make them explicit .    here",
    "we are using ` framework ' as a neutral term to encompass both the definition of the logical structure of annotations , as discussed in this paper , as well as various further specifications of e.g.  annotation conventions and file formats .",
    "generality , specificity , simplicity : :     +    annotations should be publishable ( and will often be published ) , and    thus should be mutually intelligible across laboratories , disciplines ,    computer systems , and the passage of time .    +    therefore , an annotation framework should be sufficiently expressive    to encompass all commonly used kinds of linguistic annotation ,    including sensible variants and extensions",
    ". it should be capable of    managing a variety of ( partial ) information about labels , timing , and    hierarchy .",
    "+    the framework should also be formally well - defined , and as simple as    possible , so that researchers can easily build special - purpose tools    for unforeseen applications as well as current ones , using future    technology as well as current technology .",
    "searchability and browsability : :     +    automatic extraction of information from large annotation databases ,    both for scientific research and for technological development , is a    key application .    +    therefore , annotations should be conveniently and efficiently    searchable , regardless of their size and content",
    ". it should be    possible to search across annotations of different material produced    by different groups at different times  if the content permits it     without having to write special programs .",
    "partial annotations should    be searchable in the same way as complete ones .",
    "+    this implies that there should be an efficient algebraic query    formalism , whereby complex queries can be composed out of well - defined    combinations of simple ones , and that the result of querying a set of    annotations should be just another set of annotations .",
    "+    this also implies that ( for simple queries ) there should be efficient    indexing schemes , providing near constant - time access into arbitrarily    large annotation databases .",
    "+    the framework should also support easy ` projection ' of natural    sub - parts or dimensions of annotations , both for searching and for    display purposes .",
    "thus a user might want to browse a complex    multidimensional annotation database  or the results of a preliminary    search on one  as if it contained only an orthographic transcription .",
    "maintainability and durability : :     +    large - scale annotations are both expensive to produce and valuable to    retain .",
    "however , there are always errors to be fixed , and the    annotation process is in principle open - ended , as new properties can    be annotated , or old ones re - done according to new principles .",
    "experience suggests that maintenance of linguistic annotations ,    especially across distributed edits and additions , can be a vexing and    expensive task .",
    "therefore , any framework should facilitate maintenance    of coherence in the face of distributed development and correction of    annotations .    +    different dimensions of annotation should therefore be orthogonal , in    the sense that changes in one dimension ( e.g.  phonetic transcription )    do not entail any change in others ( e.g.  discourse transcription ) ,    except insofar as the content necessarily overlaps .",
    "annotations of    temporally separated material should likewise be modular , so that    revisions to one section of an annotation do not entail global    modification .",
    "queries not affected by corrections or additions should    return the same thing before and after an update .",
    "+    in order to facilitate use in scientific discourse , it should be    possible to define durable references which remain valid wherever    possible , and produce the same results unless the referenced material    itself has changed .",
    "+    note that it is easy enough to define an invertible sequence of    editing operations for any way of representing linguistic annotations    ",
    "e.g.  by means of unix ` diff '  but what we need in this case is also    a way to specify the correspondence ( wherever it remains defined )    between arbitrary bits of annotation before and after the edit .",
    "furthermore , we do not want to impose any additional burden on human    editors  ideally , the work minimally needed to implement a change    should also provide any bookkeeping needed to maintain    correspondences .",
    "how well does our proposal satisfy these criteria ?",
    "we have tried to demonstrate generality , and to provide an adequate formal foundation , which is also ontologically parsimonious ( if not positively miserly ! ) .",
    "although we have not defined a query system , we have indicated the basis on which one can be constructed : ( tuple sets constituting ) annotation graphs are closed under union , intersection and relative complementation ; the set of subgraphs of an annotation graph is simply the power set of its constituent tuples ; simple pattern matching on an annotation graph can be defined to produce a set of annotation subgraphs ; etc .",
    "obvious sorts of simple predicates on temporal relations , graphical relations , label types , and label contents will clearly fit into this framework .",
    "the foundation for maintainability is present : fully orthogonal annotations ( those involving different label types and time points ) do not interact at all , while linked annotations ( such as those that share time points ) are linked only to the point that their content requires .",
    "new layers of annotation can be added monotonically , without any modification whatsoever in the representation of existing layers .",
    "corrections to existing annotations are as representationally local as they can be , given their content .",
    "although we have not provided a recipe for durable citations ( or for maintenance of trees of invertible modifications ) , the properties just cited will make it easier to develop practical approaches .",
    "in particular , the relationship between any two stages in the development or correction of an annotation will always be easy to compute as a set of basic operations on the tuples that express an annotation graph .",
    "this makes it easy to calculate just the aspects of a tree or graph of modifications that are relevant to resolving a particular citation .",
    "linguistic databases typically include important bodies of information whose structure has nothing to do with the passage of time in any particular recording , nor with the sequence of characters in any particular text .",
    "for instance , the switchboard corpus includes tables of information about callers ( including date of birth , dialect area , educational level , and sex ) , conversations ( including the speakers involved , the date , and the assigned topic ) , and so on . this side information is usually well expressed as a set of relational tables .",
    "there also may be bodies of relevant information concerning a language as a whole rather than any particular speech or text database : lexicons and grammars of various sorts are the most obvious examples .",
    "the relevant aspects of these kinds of information also often find natural expression in relational terms .",
    "users will commonly want to frame queries that combine information of these kinds with predicates defined on annotation graphs : ` find me all the phrases flagged as questions produced by south midland speakers under the age of 30 ' .",
    "the simplest way to permit this is simply to identify ( some of the ) items in a relational database with ( some of the ) labels in an annotation .",
    "this provides a limited , but useful , method for using the results of certain relational queries in posing an annotational query , or vice versa .",
    "more complex modes of interaction are also possible , as are connections to other sorts of databases ; we regard this as a fruitful area for further research .",
    "we have focused on the case of audio or video recordings , where a time base is available as a natural way to anchor annotations .",
    "this role of time can obviously be reassigned to any other well - ordered single dimension .",
    "the most obvious case is that of character- or byte - offsets into an invariant text file .",
    "this is the principle used in the so - called tipster architecture @xcite , where all annotations are associated with stretches of an underlying text , identified via byte offsets into a fixed file .",
    "we do not think that this method is normally appropriate for use with audio transcriptions , because they are so often subject to revision .",
    "as far as the annotation graph formalism is concerned , node identifiers , arc types , and arc labels are just sets . as a practical matter , members of each set",
    "would obviously be individuated as strings .",
    "this opens the door to applications which encode arbitrary information in these strings .",
    "indeed , the notion that arc labels encode ` external ' information is fundamental to the enterprise .",
    "the whole point of the annotations is to include strings interpreted as orthographic words , speaker names , phonetic segments , file references , or whatever .",
    "these interpretations are not built into the formalism , however , and this is an equally important trait , since it determines the simplicity and generality of the framework .    in the current formalization",
    ", arcs are decorated with pairs consisting of a type and a label .",
    "this structure already contains a certain amount of complexity , since the simplest kind of arc decoration would be purely atomic . in this case",
    ", we are convinced that the added value provided by label types is well worth the cost : all the bodies of annotation practice that we surveyed had some structure that was naturally expressed in terms of atomic label types , and therefore a framework in which arc decorations were just single uninterpreted strings  zeroth order labels  would not be expressively adequate .    a first - order approach is to allow arcs to carry multiple attributes and values ",
    "what amounts to a fielded record .",
    "the current formalization can be seen as providing records with just two fields .",
    "it is easy to imagine a wealth of other possible fields .",
    "such fields could identify the original annotator and the creation date of the arc .",
    "they could represent the confidence level of some other field .",
    "they could encode a complete history of successive modifications .",
    "they could provide hyperlinks to supporting material ( e.g.  chapter and verse in the annotators manual for a difficult decision ) .",
    "they could provide equivalence class identifiers ( as a first - class part of the formalism rather than by the external convention as in  [ sec : multiple ] ) . and they could include an arbitrarily - long sgml - structured commentary .    in principle , we could go still further , and decorate arcs with arbitrarily nested attribute - value matrices ( avms ) endowed with a type system @xcite  a second - order approach . these avms could contain references to other parts of the annotation , and multiple avms could contain shared substructures .",
    "substructures could be disjoined to represent the existence of more than one choice , and where separate choices are correlated the disjunctions could be coindexed ( i.e.  parallel disjunction ) .",
    "appropriate attributes could depend on the local type information .",
    "a dtd - like label grammar could specify available label types , their attributes and the type ordering discussed in ",
    "[ sec : hierarchy - local ] .",
    "we believe that this is a bad idea : it negates the effort that we made to provide a simple formalism expressing the essential contents of linguistic annotations in a natural and consistent way .",
    "typed feature structures are also very general and powerful devices , and entail corresponding costs in algorithmic and implementational complexity . therefore , we wind up with a less useful representation that is much harder to compute with .",
    "consider some of the effort that we have put into establishing a simple and consistent ontology for annotation . in the childes case (  [ sec : childes ] ) , we split a sentence - level annotation into a string of word - level annotations for the sake of simplifying word - level searches . in the festival case (  [ sec : festival ] ) we modeled hierarchical information using the syntactic chart construction .",
    "because of these choices , childes and festival annotations become formally commensurate  they can be searched or displayed in exactly the same terms . with labels as typed feature structures , whole sentences , whole tree structures , and",
    "indeed whole databases could be packed into single labels .",
    "we could therefore have chosen to translate childes and festival formats directly into typed feature structures .",
    "if we had done this , however , the relationship between simple concepts shared by the two formats  such as lexical tokens and time references  would remain opaque .    for these reasons",
    ", we would like to remain cautious about adding to the ontology of our formalism .",
    "however , several simple extensions seem well worth considering .",
    "perhaps the simplest one is to add a single additional field to arc decorations , called the ` comment ' , which would be formally uninterpreted , but could be used in arbitrary ( and perhaps temporary ) ways by implementations .",
    "it could be used to add commentary , or to encode the authorship of the label , or indicate who has permission to edit it , or in whatever other way .",
    "another possibility would be to add a field for encoding equivalence classes of arcs directly , rather than by the indirect means specified earlier .",
    "our preference is to extend the formalism cautiously , where it seems that many applications will want a particular capability , and to offer a simple mechanism to permit local or experimental extensions , while advising that it be used sparingly .",
    "finally , we note in passing that the same freedom for enriching arc labels applies to node identifiers .",
    "we have not given any examples in which node identifiers are anything other than digit strings .",
    "however , as with labels , in the general case a node identifier could encode an arbitrarily complex data structure .",
    "for instance , it could be used to encode the source of a time reference , or to give a variant reference ( such as a video frame number , c.f .   [ sec : offsets ] ) , or to specify whether a time reference is missing because it is simply not known or it is inappropriate ( c.f .  ",
    "[ sec : childes ] , [ sec : lacito ] ) .",
    "unlike the situation with arc labels , this step is always harmless ( except that implementations that do not understand it will be left in the dark ) . only string identity matters to the formalism , and node identifiers",
    "do not ( in our work so far ) have any standard interpretation outside the formalism .",
    "we have claimed that annotation graphs can provide an interlingua for varied annotation databases , a formal foundation for queries on such databases , and a route to easier development and maintenance of such databases .",
    "delivering on these promises will require software .",
    "since we have made only some preliminary explorations so far , it would be best to remain silent on the question until we have some experience to report .",
    "however , for those readers who agree with us that this is an essential point , we will sketch our current perspective .    as our catalogue of examples indicated , it is fairly easy to translate between other speech database formats and annotation graphs , and we have already built translators in several cases .",
    "we are also experimenting with simple software for creation , visualization , editing , validation , indexing , and search .",
    "our first goal is an open collection of relatively simple tools that are easy to prototype and to modify , in preference to a monolithic ` annotation graph environment . '",
    "however , we are also committed to the idea that tools for creating and using linguistic annotations should be widely accessible to computationally unsophisticated users , which implies that eventually such tools need to be encapsulated in reliable and simple interactive form .",
    "other researchers have also begun to experiment with the annotation graph concept as a basis for their software tools , and a key index of the idea s success will of course be the extent to which tools are provided by others .",
    "existing open - source software such as transcriber @xcite , snack @xcite , and the isip transcriber tool [ ] , whose user interfaces are all implemented in tcl / tk , make it easy to create interactive tools for creation , visualization , and editing of annotation graphs .    for instance , transcriber can be used without any changes to produce transcriptions in the ldc broadcast news format , which can then be translated into annotation graphs .",
    "provision of simple input / output functions enables the program to read and write annotation graphs directly .",
    "the architecture of the current tool is not capable of dealing with arbitrary annotation graphs , but generalizations in that direction are planned .",
    "an annotation may need to be submitted to a variety of validation checks , for basic syntax , content and larger - scale structure .",
    "first , we need to be able to tokenize and parse an annotation , without having to write new tokenizers and parsers for each new task .",
    "we also need to undertake some superficial syntax checking , to make sure that brackets and quotes balance , and so on . in the sgml realm , this need is partially met by dtds .",
    "we propose to meet the same need by developing conversion and creation tools that read and write well - formed graphs , and by input / output modules that can be used in the further forms of validation cited below .",
    "second , various content checks need to be performed .",
    "for instance , are purported phonetic segment labels actually members of a designated class of phonetic symbols or strings ?",
    "are things marked as ` non - lexemic vocalizations ' drawn from the officially approved list ?",
    "do regular words appear in the spell - check dictionary ?",
    "do capital letters occur in legal positions ?",
    "these checks are not difficult to implement , e.g.  as perl scripts , especially given a module for handling basic operations correctly .",
    "finally , we need to check for correctness of hierarchies of arcs .",
    "are phonetic segments all inside words , which are all inside phrases , which are all inside conversational turns , which are all inside conversations ?",
    "again , it is easy to define such checks in a software environment that has appropriately expressive primitives ( e.g.  a perl annotation graph module ) .",
    "indexing of the types discussed earlier (  [ sec : indexing ] ) , is well defined , algorithmically simple , and easy to implement in a general way .",
    "construction of general query systems , however , is a matter that needs to be explored more fully in order to decide on the details of the query primitives and the methods for building complex queries , and also to try out different ways to express queries . among the many questions to be explored",
    "are :    1 .",
    "how to express general graph- and time - relations ; 2 .   how to integrate regular expression matching over labels ; 3 .   how to integrate annotation - graph queries and relational queries ; 4 .   how to integrate lexicons and other external resources ; 5 .",
    "how to model sets of databases , each of which contains sets of annotation graphs , signals and perhaps relational side - information .",
    "it is easy to come up with answers to each of these questions , and it is also easy to try the answers out , for instance in the context of a collection of perl modules providing the needed primitive operations . we regard it as an open research problem to find good answers that interact well , and also to find good ways to express queries in the system that those answers will define .      whether or not our ideas are accepted by the various research communities who create and use linguistic annotations , we hope to foster discussion and cooperation among members of these communities .",
    "a focal point of this effort is the linguistic annotation page at [ ] .",
    "when we look at the numerous and diverse forms of linguistic annotation documented on that page , we see underlying similarities that have led us to imagine general methods for access and search , and shared tools for creation and maintenance .",
    "we hope that this discussion will move others in the same direction .",
