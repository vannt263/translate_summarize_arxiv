    "the observation of a dip at @xmath3 in flow subtracted two - particle azimuthal correlations observed in au + au collisions @xcite was suggested as an indicator of the production of away - side parton induced wake field or mach cone @xcite .",
    "the dip might however also result from large angle gluon radiation , jets deflection by radial flow , or cerenkov gluon radiation @xcite .",
    "while discrimination of these production mechanisms is not possible with two - particle correlations , it might be achieved with three particle correlations .",
    "we present the results of * two * parallel approaches , by star , to search for conical emission in au + au collisions at @xmath0=200 gev using three particle cumulants @xcite and a two - component model based subtraction method @xcite .",
    "the analyses use au+au datasets consisting of nearly 20 million minimum bias and 22 million central - trigger collected during rhic run 4 .",
    "correlations are measured between three charged particles in the range @xmath4 in terms of two relative azimuthal angles @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "particle `` t '' , selected in the range @xmath7 , serves as a jet tag or trigger while particles `` a '' and `` b '' , in the range @xmath8 , probe the jet structure and presence of conical emission .",
    "mach cone emission shall lead to jacobian peaks at @xmath9 , @xmath10 , with the mach angle @xmath11 determined by the sound velocity in the produced medium .",
    "preliminary three particle analyses were presented at qm05 @xcite , and elsewhere@xcite .",
    "the 3-cumulant , introduced in @xcite and also discussed in @xcite is defined as @xmath12 in terms of the measured 3-particle density ( number of triplets / event ) @xmath13 and combinatorial terms @xmath14 and @xmath15 calculated based on measured 2- and 1- particle densities .",
    "figure 1 presents the 3-cumulants measured in three ranges of centrality .",
    "the 3-cumulants feature prominent peaks at ( 0,0 ) , ( @xmath16,@xmath16 ) , ( 0,@xmath16 ) , and ( @xmath16,0 ) .",
    "one also notes the presence of weaker peaks positioned at regular intervals .",
    "these are strongest in 10 - 30% collisions where @xmath17 and @xmath18 flow coefficients are the largest , and are qualitatively understood as arising from irreducible non - diagonal collective flow contributions of order @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "calculation of these contributions based on parameterizations of measured @xmath17 and @xmath18 @xcite yields amplitudes compatible with those observed in fig .",
    "1 . the near- and away - side structures are present at all centralities , including the most central collisions .",
    "while their presence can in part result from jet emission alone ( with two associated particles either on the near or away - side ) , they may also result from the interplay of jet correlations with the event reaction plane and particle flow .",
    "their interpretation thus requires further work .",
    "note finally the away - side structures are inconsistent with global momentum conservation effects expected to produce broad structures in three - particle correlations @xcite .",
    "next we examine the 3-cumulant and their projections ( bottom part of fig 1 . ) to seek evidence of structures produced by conical emission @xcite along the diagonals 60 - 80@xmath20 from the away - side direction .",
    "projections axes are set to show away - side peak at 0 radian .",
    "the projections exhibit structures consistent with @xmath21 terms but no clear evidence for conical emission .",
    "it is however conceivable that conical emission is masked by flow terms , or simply too weak to be visible in this analysis .",
    "preliminary results obtained with this analysis technique described in @xcite were already reported @xcite .",
    "current results are also presented in qm06 poster proceedings @xcite .",
    "this method is based on a measurement of three - particle density normalized per trigger particle .",
    "it includes explicit removal of @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath19 terms , and carries combinatorial background term subtraction using a zero yield at 1 radian ( zya1 ) hypothesis @xcite .",
    "2 presents the correlations obtained after flow and combinatorial background subtraction for @xmath24 , and selected @xmath25 centralities .",
    "the correlation obtained for 80 - 50% @xmath25 collisions is qualitatively similar in shape to that obtained in @xmath24 as well as that measured with the cumulant method . at 12 - 0% centralities ,",
    "the shape of the away - side structure is however substantially modified relative to the peripheral bin : two broad peaks are observed along the main diagonals at angles of @xmath26 rad .",
    "one also observes off diagonal structures at ( @xmath26 , @xmath27 ) .",
    "diagonal projections shown in fig . 2 ( bottom ) indicate these structures are statistically significant , and thus suggest evidence for conical emission in the most central bin shown , although the amplitude of the structures depends on the inclusion of a flow - jet correlation component , the amplitude of the @xmath17 and @xmath18 flow , and combinatorial terms normalization .",
    "systematic effects dominated by flow subtraction and background normalization are shown as ( yellow ) histogram band in fig 2 .",
    "the position of the peaks angles , at @xmath26 , if arising from mach cone emission , would suggest the sound velocity is rather modest in the produced medium @xcite .",
    "further work is in progress to fully understand these effects .",
    "we presented preliminary results from two on - going star searches for conical emission in au+au collisions at @xmath28 gev .",
    "the cumulant analysis reveals finite three particle correlations dominated by near and away side particle correlations consistent with jet production .",
    "no clear evidence for conical emission is observed with this method , but the signal may be masked by the presence of irreducible flow components @xcite .",
    "the model - based subtraction method yields similar results for peripheral collisions and reveals structures at ( @xmath26 , @xmath27 ) suggestive of conical emission in more central collisions .",
    "further work is in progress to understand the methods sensitivity , systematic effects , and overall robustness of these results .",
