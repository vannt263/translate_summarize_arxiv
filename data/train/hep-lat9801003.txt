    "the lattice numerical calculation of the matrix element of any operator @xmath6 with mass dimension @xmath7 yields @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the lattice spacing , up to scaling violating contributions of order @xmath10 . the calculation of @xmath9 as a function of the coupling constant can be improved if an effective scheme is used @xcite .",
    "a nice example of such improvement has been shown to occur in pure yang - mills theories @xcite and is known to work rather well in other scalar theories ( see for example @xcite for the 2d spin models ) .    in this paper we calculate the 3-loop internal energy in full qcd with wilson fermions on the lattice .",
    "the 3-loop beta function for this theory has been recently calculated @xcite and we can compute the corresponding corrections to asymptotic scaling in both the standard and effective schemes .    we will use the wilson action @xmath11 with @xmath0 flavours and gauge group @xmath1 .",
    "this action is @xmath12 with @xmath13 .",

    "@xmath17  stands for the plaquette and @xmath18 for the link at the site @xmath19 pointing towards @xmath20 .",
    "we will parametrize the results in terms of @xmath21 , @xmath0 and the couple @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the usual hopping parameter @xmath24    the average of @xmath25 can be straightforwardly computed to all orders by rescaling the fermionic action @xmath26 by a factor @xmath27 under the fermionic path integral @xmath28 @xmath29 and by using @xmath30    on the other hand , the average of @xmath31 in presence of the action eq.([swilson ] ) is calculated in perturbation theory @xmath32 the @xmath33-loop coefficient can be written as @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the pure yang - mills contribution , known since ref .",
    "@xcite up to 3-loops , and @xmath36 is the fermionic contribution . to calculate @xmath36",
    "we will first compute the free energy @xmath37 up to 3  loops , @xmath38 being the full partition function @xmath39 the average of @xmath31 is then extracted as follows @xmath40    the feynman diagrams necessary to calculate the fermion contribution to the free energy up to 3  loops are shown in fig .  1 .",
    "we have used the feynman gauge .",
    "the involved algebra of the lattice perturbation theory was carried out by making use of the computer code developed by us  @xcite .",
    "after grouping the diagrams in several infrared - finite sets , we calculated the resulting finite integrals on finite lattice - sizes @xmath41 and then the results were extrapolated to infinite size .",
    "the extrapolating function was of the type  @xcite @xmath42 we used a broad spectrum of such functional forms and analyzed the quality of each extrapolation to assign a weight to each one , to finally produce a reliable estimate of the systematic error .",
    "the criterion to judge the quality of the extrapolation was based on the accuracy of the the fitted functional form to reproduce known results at finite lattice - sizes .",
    "the different functional forms were obtained by truncating the series in eq.([extrapolation ] ) at different values of @xmath43 and assuming vanishing coefficients @xmath44 for some @xmath45 and @xmath43 .",
    "recall @xcite that the pure gluonic contributions are  ( presented here with improved accuracy ) @xmath46 the 2-loop coefficient can be written in closed form as @xmath47 where @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 are finite integrals defined and evaluated in  @xcite . in tables  i and  ii we show @xmath51 and @xmath52 for several pairs @xmath22 .",
    "they are parametrized in terms of four constants @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 as follows @xmath57    in table  iii we show the result for @xmath58 and @xmath59 for @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 . in table",
    "iv the result for @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath63 is shown .",
    "the beta function in qcd with @xmath0 wilson fermions can be written as @xmath64 the non - universal 3-loop coefficient @xmath65 has been recently calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite , ( see also  @xcite ) . in terms of the bare coupling @xmath66 , the lattice spacing @xmath9 approaches the continuum limit as @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the 3-loop correction to asymptotic scaling @xmath69    other couplings can be defined .",
    "a popular effective coupling in terms of the plaquette energy is  @xcite @xmath70 where @xmath71 indicates monte carlo average . in terms of @xmath72",
    "the approach of the lattice spacing to the continuum limit is written as in eq.([ascaling ] ) with @xmath73 instead of @xmath68 .",
    "this 3-loop correction to asymptotic scaling is @xmath74 moreover the lattice lambda parameters are related by the equation @xmath75    we give the coefficients @xmath73 for @xmath76 in table  v and for @xmath77 in table  vi . in both cases",
    "we show the result for @xmath60 and for several choices of @xmath23 .",
    "these results must be compared with the value of @xmath68 in the standard bare coupling scheme .",
    "this is  @xcite @xmath78 ( notice that in the standard bare coupling scheme , @xmath68 does not depend on the fermion mass  @xcite ) .",
    "the 3-loop correction to asymptotic scaling for @xmath61 , @xmath63 is @xmath79 in the standard scheme and @xmath80 in the  @xmath81 scheme .",
    "apparently this improvement is not as dramatic as it was for the pure gluonic case @xcite ( for @xmath77 @xmath82 in the standard scheme and @xmath83 in the energy scheme ) .",
    "the improvement therefore seems to be more efficient in the quenched case .",
    "this fact can also be seen from tables  v and  vi where the approach to the quenched case ( either @xmath84 or @xmath85 ) is accompained by the lowering of @xmath73 . however , the only relevant test for the improvement in asymptotic scaling from the standard to some energy scheme is the practical use of the effective scheme .",
    "for example , the 2d spin models @xcite show a definite improvement in spite of the behaviour of the 3-loop coefficient @xmath68 which for the @xmath86 models passes from @xmath87 in the standard scheme to  @xmath88 in the energy scheme .",
    "we have calculated the free energy up to 3  loops in qcd with wilson fermions . we have given the result of the internal energy average @xmath89 as a function of the number of fermions @xmath0 , their masses and the wilson parameter @xmath16 .",
    "these expansions have been used to study the 3-loop corrections to asymptotic scaling in this theory .",
    "we have found that at 3  loops the corresponding energy scheme @xcite provides a moderate improvement with respect to the standard scheme .",
    "however , only the practical use of this scheme in particular problems will reveal how useful it is .",
    "we can numerically compute the set of coefficients @xmath36 and @xmath68 also for other choices of @xmath90 , @xmath0 and @xmath21 .",
