    "in the last two decades , an intensive work has concerned the numerical solution of structured linear systems of large dimensions @xcite .",
    "many problems have been solved mainly by the use of ( preconditioned ) iterative solvers . however , in the multilevel setting , it has been proved that the most popular matrix algebra preconditioners can not work in general ( see @xcite and references therein ) . on the other hand",
    ", the multilevel structures often are the most interesting in practical applications .",
    "therefore , quite recently , more attention has been focused ( see @xcite ) on the multigrid solution of multilevel structured ( toeplitz , circulants , hartley , sine ( @xmath0 class ) and cosine algebras ) linear systems in which the coefficient matrix is banded in a multilevel sense and positive definite .",
    "the reason is due to the fact that these techniques are very efficient , the total cost for reaching the solution within a preassigned accuracy being linear as the dimensions of the involved linear systems .",
    "+ in this paper we deal with the case of matrices generated by a polynomial symbol and belonging to the dct - iii algebra .",
    "this kind of matrices appears in the solution of differential equations and integral equations , see for instance @xcite .",
    "in particular , they directly arise in certain image restoration problems or can be used as preconditioners for more complicated problems in the same field of application @xcite .    in @xcite a two - grid",
    "( tgm)/multi - grid ( mgm ) method has been proposed and the theoretical analysis of the tgm has been performed in terms of the algebraic multigrid theory developed by ruge and stben @xcite . + here , the aim is to provide general conditions under which the proposed mgm results to be optimally convergent with a convergence rate independent of the dimension and to perform the corresponding theoretical analysis . + more precisely , for mgm we mean the simplest ( and less expensive ) version of the large family of multigrid methods , i.e. the v - cycle procedure . for a brief description of the tgm and of the mgm ( standard v - cycle ) we refer to  [ sec : theory ] .",
    "an extensive treatment can be found in @xcite , and especially in @xcite .",
    "+ in all the considered cases the mgm results to be optimal in the sense of definition [ defn : opt ] , i.e. the problem of solving a linear system with coefficient matrix @xmath1 is asymptotically of the same cost as the direct problem of multiplying @xmath1 by a vector .",
    "@xcite [ defn : opt ] let @xmath2 be a given sequence of linear systems of increasing dimensions .",
    "an iterative method is _ optimal _ if    1 .",
    "the arithmetic cost of each iteration is at most proportional to the complexity of a matrix vector product with matrix @xmath1 , 2 .",
    "the number of iterations for reaching the solution within a fixed accuracy can be bounded from above by a constant independent of @xmath3 .",
    "in fact , the total cost of the proposed mgm will be of @xmath4 operations since for any coarse level @xmath5 we can find a projection operator @xmath6 such that    * the matrix vector product involving @xmath6 costs @xmath7 operations where @xmath8 ; * the coarse grid matrix @xmath9 is also a matrix in the dct iii algebra generated by a polynomial symbol and can be formed within @xmath7 operations ; * the convergence rate of the mgm is independent of @xmath3 .",
