    "the ability to evaluate production rates for multi - jet final states will be fundamental at the lhc to study a large class of processes , within and beyond the sm .",
    "a necessary feature of any multi - jet calculation is the possibility to properly evolve the purely partonic final state , for which exact fixed - order perturbative calculations can be performed , into the observable hadronic final state .",
    "this evolution is best performed using shower monte carlo calculations . the accurate description of color - coherence effects ,",
    "furthermore , requires a careful bookkeeping of the contribution to the matrix elements of all possible color configurations .",
    "the goal of the algorithm  @xcite described in this talk is to allow the effective calculation of multi - parton matrix elements , allowing the separation , to the leading order in @xmath3 ( @xmath4 being the number of colors ) , of the independent color configurations .",
    "this technique allows an unweighting of the color configurations , and allows the merging of the parton level calculation with the herwig monte carlo .",
    "the key element of the strategy is the use of the algorithm alpha , introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite for the evaluation of arbitrary multi - parton matrix elements .",
    "the algorithm is built up from an _ iteration _ of matrix multiplication and is intended for the _ authomatic _ calculation of tree - level amplitudes .",
    "it has a complexity growing like a power in the number of particles , compared to the factorial - like growth that one expects from naive diagram counting .",
    "the alpha algorithm will be reviewed in section ( [ alphasec ] ) , and its application to multi - jets physics in section ( [ nj ] ) .",
    "in reference @xcite , a new approach to the computation of tree level scattering amplitudes was introduced .",
    "this approach , based on the numerical legendre transform of the effective action , is particularly useful for the authomatic calculation of multi - particle processes .",
    "this technique was implemented in a fortran code @xcite which has been succesfully used to study several intricated electroweak processes @xcite of interest both at lep @xcite and at the nlc @xcite . among the key features of the algorithm",
    "are :    * suitable ( easy to implement ) for the authomatic calculation of the scattering amplitudes . * inclusion of mass effects is straightforward * the cpu cost grows like @xmath0 ( @xmath1 constant , @xmath2 number of external particles ) as opposed to the factorial growth of the number of feynman graphs .",
    "we review in this section the alpha algorithm ; the interested reader can find a more detailed discussion in the original paper @xcite , which includes an explicit analytic example for the @xmath5 theory .    let @xmath6 be the one - particle - irreducible generator of the green functions for a given theory .",
    "then the computation of the s - matrix requires the evaluation of the legendre transform , z , of @xmath6 : @xmath7 where @xmath8 are the classical fields defined as the solutions of @xmath9 and the @xmath10 play the role of classical sources .    for concretness we will develop in some detail the case of the scattering amplitue for @xmath2 external gluons . at tree - level @xmath6",

    "the sources @xmath12 is a standard source term : @xmath13 , _ i.e. _  it contains the relevant excitation for the external particles . notice that because of this choice only a finite number of momenta ( linear combinations of @xmath14 ) enters into the problem which is reduced to a problem with a finite number of degrees of freedom .",
    "the fields @xmath15 are then found as solutions of the equation of motion .",

    "performing the iteration ( [ iter ] ) we drop terms containing @xmath19 _",
    "i.e.  _ twice the same external momenta .",
    "in fact , although legitimate , they do nt contribute to the amplitude .",
    "finally the amplitude is ( p_j_1 ,  , p_j_n ) = l_ym(a ) [ ampl ] where the @xmath17 fields are obtained in eqns .",
    "( [ init],[iter ] ) . notice that the prescription to drop terms containing at least twice the same external momenta ( @xmath20 ) is still kept and it is because of this prescription toghether with the choice ( [ init ] ) for the initial step that neither truncation nor functional derivation is actually required .",
    "a remark is in order here .",
    "the algorithm sketched above has an important feature : it provides a very compact way of storing the relevant information . indeed the number of contraction @xmath21 ( see eq .",
    "[ iter ] ) which is needed is of the order @xmath22 , each of them requiring roughly the same cpu time to be computed",
    ". therefore the cpu cost of the algorithm grows like a _ constant to the power n , n _ being the number of external particles , as opposed to the factorial growth of the number of feynman graphs . to hint",
    "how does this work let us develop in more detail the case of the amplitude for five external gluons . for simplicity",
    "we neglect the four gluons coupling .",

    "it is this feature extensively used in the construction of both the @xmath17 fields and the amplitude which turns the factorial growth of the number of feynman graphs to a power law growth of the cpu cost of the alpha algorithm .",
    "notice that in eqns .",
    "( [ suba],[ampl5 ] ) @xmath25 and @xmath26 are not computed ( and used ) .",
    "morover neither the kinetic term nor the source one appears in the expression ( [ ampl5 ] ) of the amplitude .",
    "these simplifications occur because of the equation of motion as discussed in more detail in @xcite .",
    "multi - jet final states play an important role in the study of high - energy collisions .",
    "they provide in fact interesting signatures for several phenomena , both within the standard model ( e.g. top - pair production ) , and beyond it ( e.g. multi - jet decays of supersymmetric particles such as gluinos and squarks ) .",
    "the accurate determination of the properties of these phenomena requires a good understanding of the properties of the usually large multi - jet qcd backgrounds , which can distort the shapes of signal distributions and affect the measurement of quantities such as resonances masses .",
    "there are several reasons for wanting to improve the tools currently available to perform these calculations .    1 .",
    "first of all , interesting final states with larger jet multiplicities will become available with the next generation of colliders ( lhc and nlc ) .",
    "2 .   secondly",
    ", one would like to be able to complement the calculation of parton - level matrix elements with the evaluation of the full hadronic structure of the final state .",
    "the goal of the algorithm  @xcite described in this section is to allow the effective calculation of multi - parton matrix elements , allowing the separation , to the leading order in @xmath3 ( @xmath4 being the number of colors ) , of the independent color configurations .",
    "this technique allows an unweighting of the color configurations , and allows the merging of the parton level calculation with the herwig monte carlo .",
    "the key ingredient of our strategy is the alpha algorithm outlined in the previous section .",
    "it s power - law growing in complexity is a necessary feature of any attempt to evaluate matrix elements for processes with large numbers of external particles , since the number of feynman diagrams grows very quickly ( see table 1 ) beyond any reasonable value .    ",

    "this can be done with alpha using @xmath33 large enough @xcite .",
    "2 .   extract the _ most likely _ color configuration for this event on a statistical basis , according to the relative contribution of the single configurations to the total event weight   for each color flow @xmath35 , and @xmath36 , the @xmath37-th color structure will be selected if @xmath38 , for a random number @xmath39 uniformly distributed over the interval @xmath40 $ ] . ] .",
    "since each dual amplitude is gauge invariant , the choice of color - configurations is also a gauge - invariant operation .",
    "3 .   develop the ps out of each initial and final - state parton , starting from the selected color configuration .",
    "this step can be carried out by feeding the generated event to a monte - carlo program such as herwig , which is precisely designed to _",
    "turn partons into jets _ starting from an assigned color - ordered configuration .",
    "notice that , if the dual amplitudes are evaluated for a specific helicity configuration , herwig will also include spin - correlation effects in the evolution of the parton shower  @xcite .    as a result ,",
    "use of the dual - amplitude representation of a multi - gluon amplitude allows to accurately describe not only the large - angle correlations in multi - jet final states , but also the full shower evolution of the initial- and final - state partons with the same accuracy available in herwig for the description of 2-jet final states .    in alternative to the above prescription , one can use alpha to calculate the matrix elements for external states with assigned colors .",
    "since these states are all orthogonal , such an approach is particularly efficient if one wants to use a monte carlo method to sum over all possible color states .",
    "the program will then extract through a standard unweighting ( at the leading order in @xmath3 ) a specific color flow from all possible color flows contributing to a given orthogonal color state .",
    "this color flow is then suitable as an initial condition for the shower evolution .",
    "the advantage of this approach is twofold : first the number of dual amplitudes contributing to the amplitude for external states with assigned colors is substantially smaller than the total one and second dual amplitudes are required only for _ accepted events _ which , in general , are a small fraction of the generated ones .",
    "further details can be found in  @xcite .      as an example of our technique ,",
    "we present here results for the following two parton - level processes : @xmath41 for comparisons , we also computed the above reactions in the simple approximation first suggested by kunszt and stirling  @xcite . this approximation ( hereafter referred to as sphel )",
    "consists in assuming that the average value of maximally helicity violating amplitudes @xcite is equal to the average value of all other non - zero amplitudes .    the kinematic configuration and the cut values used in our numerical examples are as follows : & = 1500gev , & p_t_i > 60gev",
    ", |_i| < 2 , + & r_ij > 0.7 . & these values , and the choice of a fixed strong coupling @xmath42 , only serve for illustrative purposes .    in fig .  1 , we show the distribution of the minimum gluon transverse momentum for both processes . in fig  2",
    "we plot the distributions for the maximum gluon transverse momentum .",
    "we have reviewed the alpha algorithm to evaluate the exact , tree - level matrix elements in the context of multi - parton processes in qcd .",
    "the algorithm is suitable ( easy to implement ) for the authomatic calculation of the scattering amplitudes and it allows the inclusion of mass effects in a straightforward manner .",
    "the cpu cost of the algorithm grows like @xmath0 ( @xmath1 constant , @xmath2 number of external particles ) as opposed to the factorial growth of the number of feynman graphs .",
    "this technique has been tested for processes such as @xmath43 gluons and @xmath44 gluons , with @xmath2 up to 9 .",
    "we discussed how the summation over colour configurations allows the construction of parton - level event generators suitable to interfacing with a parton - shower evolution including the effects of colour - coherence .",
    "this will eventually lead to a fully exclusive , hadron - level description of multi - jet final states , accurately incorporating the dynamics of large jet - jet separation angles .",
