    "there are many proposals to use extreme non - linear interactions of the latest generation of high - power ultrashort pulse laser systems to produce beams of high energy photons with high - brightness and short pulse duration .",
    "for example , high - order harmonic generation promises trains of coherent pulselets @xcite whilst compton scattering could extend energies into the @xmath2-regime @xcite .",
    "however , these and other similar schemes are complex and have stringent laser requirements . an alternative proposal has been the use of compact laser - plasma accelerators to drive sources of undulating / wiggling radiation .",
    "these accelerators use the plasma wakefield generated by the passage of an intense laser pulse through an underdense plasma @xcite .",
    "such wakefields can have intrinsic fields @xmath3 greater than the best achievable by conventional accelerator technology , and thus can accelerate particles to high energies in a fraction of the distance .",
    "recently , it has been demonstrated that at high laser power , the wakefield can be driven to sufficient amplitude that it can trap particles from the background plasma and accelerate them in a narrow energy spread beam@xcite , now producing beams of electrons of @xmath4 gev energy on the order of 1 cm @xcite .",
    "such electron sources are clearly of interest to replace the accelerators which drive current synchrotron sources , and typically use multiple periods of alternately poled magnets ( undulators or wigglers ) to reinforce the synchrotron emission over a length of @xmath4 metres .",
    "the first demonstrations of wakefield driven radiation using external wigglers have now indeed been reported , though still being limited to optical or near - optical wavelengths and modest photon numbers @xcite .",
    "however , the particles being accelerated in the plasma accelerator also undergo transverse ( betatron ) oscillations due to the focusing fields of the plasma wave .",
    "the oscillations occur at the betatron frequency @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the plasma frequency and @xmath2 is the lorentz factor of the electron beam . since this betatron wavelength ( @xmath7 ) is much smaller than the period of comparable external wigglers , again due to the extremely large electric fields of the wakefield , the wavelength at which these particles radiate ( of order @xmath8 ) can be in the x - ray region for @xmath9 i.e.  for an electron beam of energy @xmath10 mev . for small transverse amplitude and thus small strength parameter @xmath11 ( i.e.  undulator limit ) , the radiation spectrum will be narrowly peaked about a fundamental energy .",
    "as @xmath12 , radiation also appears at harmonics . for large @xmath13 ( large amplitude - wiggler limit ) a synchrotron spectrum with broad emission consisting of closely spaced harmonics is produced @xcite .",
    "@xmath14 here , @xmath15 is the radiated energy , @xmath16 is the number of oscillations and @xmath17 is twice the energy above and below which roughly half of the total energy is radiated .",
    "@xmath18 is a modified bessel function of the second kind . for @xmath19 , the spectrum of radiated energy decays exponentially .",
    "the radiation is confined to a cone with opening angle @xmath20 .",
    "previous measurements of betatron radiation from a broad energy spread electron beam from a laser wakefield accelerator have demonstrated x - ray emission with energies up to @xmath21 kev with a brightness up to @xmath22  ph / s / mrad@xmath23/mm@xmath23@xmath24bw @xcite .",
    "here we demonstrate the use of a compact accelerator ( in total @xmath25 cm ) , which produces a beam with much higher charge at high energy ( @xmath26 mev ) , to produce a 1 - 100 kev x - ray source with more than @xmath27 greater brightness than previous laser driven betatron sources @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we demonstrate that this radiation source exhibits evidence for spatial coherence .",
    "the experiment was performed by focusing an intense short pulse ( @xmath28 fs , @xmath29 j ) laser onto the front edge of 3 , 5 and 10 mm helium gas jets ( see methods ) .",
    "electrons beams with narrow energy spread features were observed from all nozzles , at densities of @xmath30 @xmath31 . due to consecutive phases of injection @xcite ,",
    "the electron beam consists of multiple filaments .",
    "for example , for a density of @xmath32 @xmath31 on the 5 mm nozzle , electron beams of @xmath33 mev with @xmath34% energy spread at fwhm were observed with an average of @xmath35 filaments per shot , with a root - mean - square ( rms ) divergence of @xmath36 mrad@xmath23 . the beam position had a rms pointing fluctuation of @xmath37 mrad@xmath23 .",
    "the average and maximum energy of the electron beam follow the typical wakefield density scaling law @xcite .    with the electron beam deflected away from laser axis by the spectrometer magnet , a bright ( undeviated ) beam of x - rays",
    "was also observed co - propagating along the laser axis .",
    "it was imperative to first prove that this x - ray source originates from the plasma itself . in order to do this a grid of 60 @xmath38 m diameter silver wires",
    "was placed a few centimetres from the target .",
    "x - rays originating from the interaction region project the outline of the mesh onto an imaging plate @xcite .",
    "a strongly collimated beam of x - rays is evident in figure 1a . when either the laser power or plasma density was reduced to inhibit the electron beam",
    ", the x - ray beam also disappeared , showing that the generation of the x - rays is linked to the electron beam .",
    "the profile is elliptical with a fwhm divergence of @xmath39 mrad@xmath23 , corresponding to a wiggler parameter @xmath40 of @xmath41 and @xmath42 for a simultaneously measured electron beam energy @xmath43 mev .",
    "the x - ray beam pointing is extremely stable , as can be deduced from figure 1b , which shows the sum of five consecutive shots .",
    "their combined divergence is not significantly larger than that of a single shot measurement , the rms pointing stability is 5 mrad in the horizontal and vertical direction , similar to the pointing stability of the electron beam .    to give an indication of the x - ray source size , microscopic objects were backlit with the x - ray beam .",
    "figures 1c , g show photographs of collections of wires of various sizes , and figures 1 d , f , g , h show the corresponding radiographs of these objects .",
    "even features as small as a 5 @xmath38 m wire are resolved , indicating that the betatron x - ray source is @xmath44 m , smaller than the size of the plasma wave in which the radiating electrons were trapped ( @xmath45 m diameter ) .",

    "all features are resolved indicating a betatron source @xmath47 @xmath38 m .",
    "( i ) single edge fresnel diffraction from a cleaved insb crystal produces a half - shadow , consistent with a @xmath48 @xmath38 m spatially coherent source.,width=302 ]    to quantify the source size more precisely , a half - plain was backlit with the x - ray beam .",
    "a typical intensity distribution on the detector looks like a half - shadow ( figure 1i ) , whose details convolve information about the x - ray source and half - plain . the half - plain was a 0.25 mm thick cleaved insb crystal ( @xmath49 transmission below 20 kev ) and resembles an ideal step function . assuming a gaussian source function , convolution with the step function gives an error function which fits the experimental intensity distribution well .",
    "figure 2 ( inset ) shows several experimental intensity lineouts and fitted error functions which predict the sharp rise and provide an estimate of the source size , in the range 2.9 - 6.0 @xmath38 m at fwhm for the traces shown in figure 2 ( inset ) .",
    "the fit with the error function , however , fails to reproduce the ringing that follows the sharp rise on the high intensity side .    to accurately model the shape of the intensity distribution ,",
    "it is necessary to use fresnel diffraction ( see methods ) , where the details of the diffraction pattern depend on the spatial and spectral intensity distribution of the source and the dimensions of the setup .",
    "figure 2 shows an experimental and modelled intensity distributions based on a gaussian spatial intensity profile and synchrotron spectrum , assuming a constant phase across the source . for the solid red curve in figure 2 ,",
    "@xmath50 kev and an @xmath51 intensity radius of @xmath52 @xmath38 m was assumed , which best reproduced both the sharp rise and the amplitude and width of the first fringe .",
    "changing @xmath53 or @xmath54 under or overestimates the height and/or width of the overshoot and/or the rise , as shown by the other curves in figure 2 .",
    "this determines that the @xmath51 radius of the source is in the range @xmath55 and @xmath56 @xmath38 m and @xmath57 between @xmath58 and @xmath59 kev",
    ".    the ringing must be due to interference of the radiation that has originated from different regions of a spatially extended source .",
    "if the phase relationship across the source was random , the fringes would be blurred , as shown in gray open circles in figure 2 .",
    "the spectral width of the source also reduces fringe visibility .",
    "the fact that the data exhibits a clear first fringe can only be attributed to spatial coherence of the source .    the x - ray yield measured with an x - ray ccd",
    "was studied as a function of electron charge .",
    "the x - ray signal increases with interaction length from 5 mm to 10 mm ( figure 3a ) .",
    "this is not surprising since a longer interaction length can accommodate more betatron oscillations .",
    "however , the x - ray yield per charge increases more than linearly from the 5 mm to 10 mm nozzle , by an average factor of 3 . the electron beam exhibits oscillatory transverse deflections in the spectrometer normal to the dispersion direction , which is evidence for the presence of betatron oscillations during acceleration @xcite .",
    "indeed a high x - ray yield is correlated with the prominence of these betatron remnants ( figure 3a inset ) .",
    "an interaction of the accelerating electron beam with the laser ( betatron resonance ) , can promote an increase in oscillation amplitude @xcite .",
    "for this to occur , the electron beam must catch up with the laser , which would be favoured by a longer interaction .",
    "the faster than linear scaling of the x - ray yield may be a coherent effect based on micro - bunching , which simulations have shown as a consequence of a betatron resonance @xcite .",
