    "the receiver knows which subset of the @xmath0 channels that are working ; the transmitter does not .",
    "the problem is then to design an mdc system which , for given channel rates , minimizes the distortions due to reconstruction of the source using information from any subsets of the channels .    the achievable multiple - description ( md ) rate - distortion function is completely known for the case of two channels , squared - error fidelity criterion and the memoryless gaussian source  @xcite .",
    "an extension to colored gaussian sources was provided in  @xcite .",
    "inner and outer bounds to the @xmath0-channel quadratic gaussian rate - distortion region for memoryless sources was presented in  @xcite .",
    "practical symmetric multiple - description lattice vector quantization ( md - lvq ) based schemes for two descriptions have been introduced in  @xcite , which in the limit of infinite - dimensional source vectors and under high - resolution assumptions , approach the symmetric md rate - distortion bound .",
    "an extension to @xmath1 descriptions was presented in  @xcite .",
    "asymmetric md - lvq was considered in  @xcite for the case of two descriptions .",
    "common for all of the designs  @xcite is that a central quantizer is first applied on the source after which an _ index - assignment _ ( ia ) algorithm ( also known as a labeling function ) maps the reconstruction points of the central quantizer to reconstruction points of the side quantizers , which is an idea that was first presented in  @xcite .",
    "these designs are usually referred to as ia based designs .",

    "@xcite and the delta - sigma quantization approach of stergaard et al .",

    "while the different designs mentioned above are able to achieve the rate - distortion bounds in the asymptotical limit as the lattice vector quantizer dimension @xmath2 gets arbitrarily large , there is an inherent _ rate loss _ when finite dimensional vector quantizers are employed .",
    "for example , in the two - channel symmetric case and at high resolutions , the rate loss ( per description ) of the ia based schemes is given by @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the dimensionless normalized second moment of the @xmath5-dimensional lattice @xmath6 and @xmath7 is the dimensionless normalized second moment of an @xmath5-dimensional hypersphere  @xcite . for the source - splitting approach",
    "the rate loss is @xmath8 whereas for the delta - sigma quantization approach the rate loss is @xmath9 . since @xmath10 , it follows that the ia based approaches yield the smallest rate loss of all existing asymptotically optimal designs .",

    "specifically , we propose a design of an asymmetric ia based md - lvq scheme for the case of @xmath11 descriptions .",
    "the design uses a single labeling function and simple reconstruction functions , which are given by the inverse ia function when all descriptions are received or otherwise by a weighted average of the received descriptions .",
    "we consider the case of mse distortion and smooth sources with finite differential entropy rate . to the best of the authors knowledge ,",
    "the above restrictions ( or even less general restriction ) are also necessary for the existing ia - based designs proposed in the literature .",
    "the contributions of the paper are summarized below and are valid under high - resolution conditions and asymptotically large nesting ratios :    * we provide a simple construction of the labeling function for the asymmetric case and for any number @xmath11 of descriptions .",
    "the construction is optimal within the framework of ia based schemes where only a single ia function is used and where the reconstruction rule is given as the average of the received descriptions ( or the central lattice in case all descriptions are received ) . * for @xmath12 and any @xmath13 , we provide closed - form rate - distortion expressions . * for @xmath12 and in the limit as @xmath14 ,",
    "the distortion points of our scheme lie on the inner bound provided by pradhan et al .",

    "we define a notion of _ rate loss _ ( in the symmetric case only ) as the difference between the operational rate of the scheme and the rate of the inner bound of pradhan et al .",
    "we then show that our construction yields a smaller rate loss than that of source - splitting  @xcite .    this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : prelim ] we briefly review some lattice properties , describe the required asymptotical conditions which we will be assuming through - out the work , and",

    "this is not important for the design proposed in this work .      as is common in ia",
    "based md - lvq , we will in this work require a number of asymptotical conditions to be satisfied in order to guarantee the prescribed rate - distortion performance . specifically , we require high - resolution conditions , i.e.  we will be working near the limit where the rates of the central and side quantizers diverge towards infinity , or equivalently , in the limit where the volumes of the voronoi cells of the lattices in question become asymptotically small",
    ". this condition makes it possible to assume an approximately uniform source distribution over small regions so that standard high - resolution lattice quantization results become valid  @xcite .",
    "let @xmath87 be a real lattice and let @xmath88 be the volume of a fundamental region of @xmath26 .",
    "moreover , let @xmath89 be a connected region of volume @xmath90 .",
    "then , the high - resolution assumption makes it possible to approximate the number of lattice points in @xmath91 by @xmath92 , which is an approximation that becomes exact as the number of lattice shells within @xmath91 goes to infinity . to be more specific ,",
    "let @xmath93 be a sphere in @xmath94 of radius @xmath95 and center @xmath96 . then , according to gauss counting principle , the number @xmath97 of integer lattice points in a convex body @xmath98 in @xmath94 equals the volume vol@xmath99 of @xmath98 with a small error term  @xcite .",
    "in fact if @xmath100 then by use of a theorem due to minkowski it can be shown that , for any @xmath101 and asymptotically as @xmath102 , @xmath103 , where @xmath104 is the volume of the @xmath5-dimensional unit sphere  @xcite .",
    "it is also known that the number of lattice points @xmath105 in the first @xmath106 shells ( i.e. , the @xmath106 shells nearest the origin ) of the lattice @xmath26 satisfies , asymptotically as @xmath107 , @xmath108  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the high - resolution assumption , we also require that the index values of the sublattices become asymptotically large . with this",
    ", it follows that the number of central lattice points within a voronoi cell of a sublattice becomes arbitrarily large .",
    "furthermore , to guarantee that the sublattices satisfy the high - resolution quantization properties , we must force the volume of their voronoi cells to be small .",
    "in other words , we require that @xmath109 and @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the volume of a voronoi cell of the @xmath112th sublattice .",
    "we also note that , in order to avoid that some subset of the sublattices asymptotically dominate the overall distortion , we will require that their index values grow at the same rate , i.e.  @xmath113 for some constant @xmath114 .",
    "finally , as mentioned in the previous section , we require the existence of good lattices for quantization .",
    "we therefore require that the lattice vector dimension @xmath5 tends towards infinity .",
    "we note that the above asymptotical conditions are only required to guarantee exact results .",
    "in fact , at some point , we relax the requirement on @xmath5 and provide exact results for any @xmath13 .",
    "moreover , the proof technique is constructive in the sense that in non - asymptotical situations , i.e.  for finite @xmath115 and @xmath116 , the results are approximately true .",
    "this is interesting from a practical perspective , since , in practice , the asymptotical conditions will never be truly satisfied .      in the mdc scheme considered in this paper ,",
    "a source vector @xmath117 is quantized to the nearest reconstruction point @xmath118 in the central lattice @xmath45 .",
    "hereafter follows ias ( mappings ) , which uniquely map all @xmath118 s to reproduction points in each of the sublattices @xmath119 .",
    "this mapping is done through a labeling function @xmath120 , and we denote the individual component functions of @xmath120 by @xmath121 .",

    "each @xmath0-tuple @xmath125 is used only once when labeling points in @xmath45 so that @xmath118 can be recovered unambiguously when all @xmath0 descriptions are received .",
    "since lattices are infinite arrays of points , we adopt the procedure first used in  @xcite and construct a shift invariant labeling function , so we only need to label a finite number of points .",
    "we generalize the approach of  @xcite and construct a product lattice @xmath54 which has @xmath56 central lattice points and @xmath126 sublattice points from the @xmath112th sublattice in each of its voronoi cells .",
    "the voronoi cells @xmath127 of the product lattice @xmath54 are all similar so by concentrating on labeling only central lattice points within one voronoi cell of @xmath54 , the rest of the central lattice points may be labeled simply by translating this voronoi cell throughout @xmath94 .",
    "we will therefore only label central lattice points within @xmath53 , which is the voronoi cell of @xmath54 around the origin . with this",

    "we end by assessing the rate and distortion performances of the labeling function in section  [ sec : rates ] and section  [ sec : distortions ] , respectively .      in order to ensure that @xmath120 is shift - invariant",
    ", we must make sure that an @xmath0-tuple is not assigned to more than one central lattice point @xmath131 .",
    "notice that two @xmath0-tuples which are translates of each other by some @xmath129 must not both be assigned to central lattice points located within the same region @xmath127 , since this causes assignment of an @xmath0-tuple to multiple central lattice points .",
    "the region @xmath53 will be translated through - out @xmath94 and centered at @xmath129 .",
    "assume that @xmath54 is clean is said to be clean with respect to @xmath26 if no points of @xmath26 falls on the boundary of the voronoi cells of @xmath34 .",

    "let us now construct an @xmath0-tuple , say @xmath135 , where the first element is inside @xmath53 , i.e.  @xmath136 .",
    "once we shift the @xmath0-tuple by a multiple of @xmath54 , the first element of the shifted @xmath0-tuple will never be inside @xmath53 and the @xmath0-tuple is therefore shift invariant . in other words , @xmath137 for @xmath138 .",
    "this also means that all @xmath0-tuples ( for @xmath139 ) have their first element ( i.e.  @xmath140 ) inside @xmath53 .",

    "we consider a zero - mean and unit - variance gaussian source @xmath160 and define three random variables @xmath678 where the @xmath679 s are identically distributed jointly gaussian random variables ( independent of @xmath160 ) with variance @xmath680 and covariance matrix @xmath681 given by @xmath682 where the correlation coefficient satisfies @xmath683 .",
    "it is easy to show that the mmse when estimating @xmath160 from any set of @xmath659 @xmath684 s is given by  @xcite @xmath685 in the high - resolution case where @xmath686 it follows that we have @xmath687 @xmath688 and @xmath689 it was shown in  @xcite that , the description rate @xmath405 is given by @xmath690 so that @xmath691 where the approximation becomes exact at high resolution ( i.e.  for @xmath692 ) .",
    "we can now form the high - resolution distortion product @xmath693 where the last inequality follows by inserting @xmath446 which corresponds to having a high side - to - central distortion ratio , i.e.  it resembles the asymptotical condition of letting @xmath109 in the ia based approach .",
