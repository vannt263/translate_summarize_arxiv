    "self couplings among electroweak gauge bosons are a consequence of the non - abelian structure of the standard model ( sm ) of electroweak interactions  @xcite .",
    "the measurement of triple ( tgc ) and quartic couplings ( qgc ) has been one of the main activities of the lep experiments ( aleph , delphi , l3 and opal ) after the @xmath0  centre - of - mass energy ( @xmath1 ) was raised above the threshold for the production of two w bosons ( lep2 phase ) .",
    "experiments have performed both precision measurements of couplings as predicted by the theory and searches for anomalous couplings which could be present as a consequence of new physics .",
    "the theoretical input is normally expressed in the form of an effective lagrangian containing all operators of a given order which contribute to the set of vertices under study and which are consistent with basic physical assumptions such as lorentz and electromagnetic gauge invariance .",
    "the extraction of couplings is then performed either by fitting distributions of a chosen set of sensitive variables or by means of optimal observables techniques  @xcite , in which the sensitivity to the couplings is concentrated in a reduced number of properly defined variables .",
    "all results reported in this paper are based on data collected at lep during 19962000 at @xmath2 , corresponding to total integrated luminosities up to about 700 @xmath3 per experiment . for many channels and couplings ,",
    "lep combined results exist .",
    "the latest combinations are summarized in  @xcite where reference is given to the individual publications . more recent results are not yet combined and will therefore be referenced directly in the following .",
    "the individual references should be consulted for details about experimental techniques and composition of data sets .",
    "this document is organized as follows : section  [ secctgc ] deals with charged triple couplings , _",
    "i.e. _ couplings between the w and neutral bosons ( wwz and ww@xmath4 vertices ) , section  [ secntgc ] describes searches for purely neutral tgcs , not foreseen in the sm , and finally section  [ secqgc ] reports limits on qgcs .",
    "the wwz and ww@xmath4 vertices can be probed at lep2 in ww , single w and single @xmath4 production .",
    "to lowest order , three feynman graphs contribute to ww production : the s - channel z and @xmath4 production and the t - channel neutrino exchange .",
    "the two s - channel diagrams contain the wwz and ww@xmath4 vertices .",
    "ww@xmath4 is also involved in the single w process ( @xmath5 ) via w-@xmath4 fusion and in single @xmath4 production ( @xmath6 ) , via w - boson fusion .",
    "the most general parametrization of the wwz and ww@xmath4 vertices can be written as a function of seven complex tgcs for each vertex  @xcite .",
    "some assumptions are normally made in order to reduce the number of parameters to be measured .",
    "imposing the conservation of c and p symmetry and electromagnetic gauge invariance reduces the number of free parameters to five , usually chosen to be @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10  and @xmath11 . at tree level within the sm , @xmath12 and @xmath13",
    "a further reduction is normally achieved by the requirement of custodial @xmath14 gauge invariance , which translates to the constraints @xmath15 and @xmath16  @xcite , where @xmath17 is the weak mixing angle .",
    "@xmath7 , @xmath8  and @xmath9  are normally chosen as the minimal set of parameters to be measured and are the ones used in the lep - wide combinations .",
    "the ww channel gives the best sensitivity at lep in the measurement of charged tgcs .",
    "anomalous couplings would affect the total production cross section , the production angle and the polarization of the w bosons .",
    "a ww event , yielding two fermions and two anti - fermions in the final state , is completely described in terms of five angles : the w production angle and the polar and azimuthal angles of the fermion in the w@xmath18 rest frame and of the anti - fermion in the w@xmath19 rest frame .",
    "the distributions of these angles , or other quantities derived from them , are used by the lep experiments to derive measurements of tgcs . as an example , the distribution of the cosine of the w@xmath18 production angle in fully hadronic ww events collected by l3  @xcite is shown in figure  [ fig : qqqqcosw ] , where the effect     production angle in hadronic w - pair events collected by the l3 detector .",
    "data are shown together with the expectations for the sm and for anomalous values of @xmath7 . ]    of anomalous values of @xmath7  is also plotted .",
    "the single w channel gives a sensitivity comparable to that obtained with ww events only on @xmath8 ; on the other hand it gives the possibility to disentangle the effects of the wwz and ww@xmath4 vertices , which are correlated in measurements based on the ww channel . in this process",
    ", the electron is produced at very low polar angle and is therefore not detected , leaving a signature of only one w boson in the detector .",
    "lep experiments use different kinematic variables to extract the couplings from the single w channel . as an example the transverse momentum of the electrons and muons in leptonically decaying w s as measured by aleph",
    "are shown in figure  [ fig : singlew ] .",
    "the energy spectrum and the angular distribution of the photon produced in single @xmath4 processes are sensitive to the ww@xmath4 vertex , even though less than the ww and single w channels .    measurements of charged tgcs by the four lep experiments are summarized in table  [ table : tgc ] , together with their combination  @xcite .",
    "all results are obtained by varying one parameter while setting the others to their sm value .",
    "the constraints @xmath15 and @xmath20 are imposed .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "results of the measurements of triple and quartic gauge boson couplings by the four lep experiments are reviewed in this paper , together with their combinations .",
    "most results are either published or being finalized for publication .",
    "the measurement of charged tgcs , which are predicted as a fundamental consequence of the gauge structure of the electroweak theory , has reached at lep the precision of about 24% , with results in agreement with the sm .",
    "searches for anomalous triple and quartic couplings have been performed by all lep experiments in several different final states , and limits are set with no deviations observed from the sm predictions ."
