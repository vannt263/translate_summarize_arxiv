    "the abundance of deuterium in the interstellar medium ( ism ) is a strong constraint on chemical evolution scenarios . unlike most elements",
    ", the net cosmic abundance of deuterium is not enhanced by stellar processes or supernovae , so its abundance has been declining from the primordial value due to destruction by stellar processing .",
    "the primordial abundance of deuterium is itself an important quantity , as it can be used to measure @xmath16 , the universal ratio of baryons to photons , which can be compared to the predictions of big bang nucleosynthesis @xcite .",
    "one approach to finding the initial deuterium abundance is to measure it in high - redshift qso absorption - line systems , assuming that the clouds which give rise to these systems have undergone very little stellar processing @xcite .",
    "however , the large range in d / h values measured in these systems suggests that the gas in some of these clouds may in fact have undergone some stellar processing @xcite .",
    "it is therefore crucial to understand how chemical evolution affects the abundance of deuterium relative to other elements .",
    "several groups are measuring the abundance of deuterium and other elements along many sight lines in the galactic ism in order to establish the mean d / h ratio in the galactic disk , and to look for variations in the d / h ratio .",
    "these variations can shed light on the effects of star - formation history and mixing processes on the d / h ratio .",
    "the local d / h value can then be compared to regions that have undergone varying amounts of stellar processing ( _ e.g. , _ high velocity clouds , or intergalactic clouds ) , which will illuminate the effects of stellar processing on the d / h ratio in these systems .",
    "the _ copernicus _  satellite was used to measure the and lyman series absorption toward @xmath17 stars , and the results suggested a d / h ratio of 1.5@xmath1810@xmath19 , with a dispersion that may reflect real variations in the ism ( see vidal - madjar & gry 1984 for a review ) .",
    "several measurements of d / h in the local ism have been made with the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) @xcite , though only the ly@xmath2 transitions of and could be analyzed , limiting the number of available sight lines to those with low enough columns that the absorption is not blended with the line but large enough columns that can be detected .",
    "three sight lines observed with the interstellar medium absorption profile spectrograph ( _ imaps _ ) spanned larger distances than the _ hst _  sight lines ( 250 to 500 pc versus @xmath20 100 pc ) , and like the _ copernicus _  results they showed evidence of variation in d / h with location @xcite .",
    "one of the science goals of the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer _",
    "( _ fuse _ ) is to measure d / h in the milky way @xcite .",
    "_ fuse _  is uniquely suited to do this because it observes the spectral region from 905 to 1187   which includes all of the lyman transitions except ly@xmath2 .",
    "the ability to use multiple transitions means that _ fuse _  is able to measure @xmath15 ( ) along higher column density sight lines than missions that only observe ly@xmath2 ( _ e.g. , _ _ hst _ ) , and for many more sight lines than short term missions ( _ e.g. , _ _ imaps _ ) .",
    "moos et al .",
    "( 2002 , and references therein ) reported results for the first set of seven sight lines ranging from 37 to 179 pc , five of which had both measurements ( from _ fuse _ ) and ( from _ hst _ ) .",
    "the results were consistent with a single value of d / h@xmath21 ( the uncertainty is @xmath22 in the mean ) .",
    "however , none of these sight lines extend as far as the three sight lines observed by _ imaps_. analysis of more extended sight lines is crucial for the verification and understanding of variations in the d / h ratio in the ism .",
    "in this paper we present _ fuse _  measurements of d / h toward two distant stars in the galactic disk : hd  195965 and hd  191877 .",
    "these stars are at distances greater than the _ imaps _  targets , extending the distance and range of @xmath15 ( ) for d / h measurements in the ism .",
    "information about these two sight lines is listed in table 1 .",
    "the _ fuse _ , stis , and ground - based observations and data reduction are described in   2 .",
    "section 3 describes some properties of the sight lines . in   4",
    "we describe both the curve of growth and the absorption profile fitting analyses of the column density toward both stars . in   5 we discuss the determination of the and abundances along these sight lines , and in ",
    "6 we re - examine the column densities .",
    "section 7 contains a discussion of the results and conclusions .",
    "information for the _ fuse _  observations is given in table 2 .",
    "the _ fuse _  mission and instrument are described by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the spectra were obtained through the large ( 30@xmath23@xmath1830@xmath23 ) lwrs aperture .",
    "_ fuse _  consists of 4 co - aligned optical channels , two optimized for longer wavelength ( lif1 and lif2 ; 1000  1187   ) and two optimized for shorter wavelengths ( sic1 and sic2 ; 905  1100   ) .",
    "all of the deuterium lines used in this paper are located in the sic channels .",
    "the ly@xmath24 line was not detected in either spectrum because it was blended with the strong line , but some lines of other elements used in our analysis are located in the lif channels . between exposures the focal plane assemblies were moved so that the spectra sampled different portions of the detector .",
    "this shifting lessens the effects of detector defects when the individual spectra are combined .",
    "the raw spectra were processed through the _ fuse _  calibration pipeline ( calfuse v2.1.6 ) at the johns hopkins university .",
    "the pipeline screens data for passage through the south atlantic anomaly and low earth limb angle pointings and corrects for thermal drift of the gratings , thermally - induced changes in the detector read - out circuitry , and doppler shifts due to the orbital motion of the satellite .",
    "finally , the pipeline subtracts a constant detector background and applies wavelength and flux calibration . after the pipeline reduction",
    "the individual spectra were co - added to produce the final calibrated spectrum .",
    "the data from the four channels were analyzed separately , because there are slight differences in the spectral resolution between channels , which can cause problems if the channels are co - added .",
    "this has the benefit of allowing at least two measurements of each line , a further safeguard against detector defects .",
    "the presence of bright airglow lines at specific regions of the spectrum has resulted in a long - term depletion of electrons in the detector in those regions , and this can cause localized shifts in the spectrum in the dispersion direction .",
    "this effect , called `` x - walk , '' may change the shapes and areas of absorption lines .",
    "the effect is more pronounced in certain _ fuse _  detectors .",
    "we have avoided using the equivalent widths of absorption lines in regions where the x - walk effect is pronounced , so these detector artifacts do not affect the analysis in this paper .",
    "the x - walk distortion is described in the _ fuse observer s guide _ available at the _ fuse _  website ( http://fuse.pha.jhu.edu/ ) .",

    "brief information about the observation is given in table  2 .",
    "the spectrum was obtained in accum mode using the fuv mama , the e140h grating ( @xmath29 ) , and the @xmath30 aperture .",
    "we reduced the data using calstis ( v2.12a ) with all of the normal reduction procedures enabled in the standard data pipeline , including the two - dimensional scattered light removal algorithms ( see landsman & bowers 1997 ; lindler & bowers 2000 ; see also howk & sembach 2000 ) .",

    "the absolute wavelength scale is accurate to @xmath37 pixel , or about 3 - 6 m  ( @xmath38 kms@xmath28 ; see leitherer et al .",
    "the post - processed stis data have very low residual backgrounds .",
    "we find that the strongly saturated cores of the 1302.169   and 1334.532   lines have residual intensities of @xmath39% .",
    "high - resolution echelle spectra of hd  195965 and hd  191877 were taken with the 2.7  m telescope of the university of texas mcdonald observatory on 2001 december 29 .",
    "the  2dcoud \" spectrograph @xcite was used with 1 camera setup and a tektronix charge - coupled device ( ccd ) as the detector , which provided high spectral resolution ( r = @xmath40 160,000 ; @xmath41v @xmath42 2 km s@xmath28 ) and covered the wavelength range 6000    to 8600   .",
    "this high resolution mode yielded spectra containing 12 disjoint echelle orders approximately 40    wide , separated by approximately 150    at 6000   . the inter - order separation increased with wavelength until there was approximately 280    between orders at near infrared wavelengths .",
    "this setup provided spectra on interstellar .",
    "the resolution was determined from the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of thorium - argon ( th - ar ) calibration lamp lines .",
    "the data were reduced in a standard way utilizing the noao sun / iraf software ( v2.11.3 ) .",
    "dark , bias , and flat field lamp exposures were taken to remove any instrumental effects due to the ccd detector .",
    "comparison spectra were taken periodically throughout the night , typically every two hours .",
    "the average bias exposure was subtracted from all raw stellar , comparison ( th - ar ) and flat images .",
    "the scattered light was fitted by low order polynomials in both the dispersion and spatial directions , and removed .",
    "pixel to pixel sensitivity variations were removed by dividing the normalized average flat field into the stellar spectra .",
    "the extracted spectra were placed on a heliocentric wavelength scale using the th - ar comparison spectra and corrections for the earth s motion .",
    "the spectra were co - added and normalized to unity yielding a final spectrum with high signal to noise , approximately 100:1 .",

    "hd  195965 ( @xmath45=85.71@xmath46 , @xmath47=5.00@xmath46 ) was classified by morgan , code , & whitford ( 1955 ) as type b0v .",
    "it is listed by @xcite as belonging to the cygnus ob7 association , which is at a distance of @xmath27830 pc in the local spiral arm . @xcite",
    "give a distance of 794  pc from spectroscopic parallax ( with an uncertainty of @xmath48 ) . at this distance",

    "@xcite find log @xmath15(hi)=20.9 based on _ iue _  data .",
    "hd  191877 ( @xmath45=61.57@xmath46 , @xmath47=-6.45@xmath46 ) is type b1.0ib @xcite , and spectroscopic parallax gives a distance of @xmath272200  pc @xcite , again with an uncertainty of @xmath48 .",
    "this places the star on the edge of the sagittarius arm and 250 pc below the plane of the milky way , well out of the thin disk ( scale height @xmath50 pc , dickey & lockman 1990 ) .",
    "it is likely that most of the gas along this sight line lies within @xmath13 pc of the sun .",
    "this is supported by the fact that the column toward hd  191877 found by @xcite ( log @xmath15(hi)=20.9 ) is similar to that toward hd  195965 , even though the distance to hd  191877 is more than twice as great as the distance to hd  195965 .",
    "the two sight lines therefore likely probe a similar distance range in the disk .",

    "the ground - based optical spectra of hd  195965 and hd  191877 in figure 3 reveal that there are multiple clouds along the line of sight to each star . along",
    "both sight lines there appear to be two major components of , as well as several weaker components .",
    "the stis spectrum of hd  195965 ( figure 4 ) confirms the presence of multiple velocity components .",
    "two components are visible in the 1355.598    profiles , and the 1425.030  profile shows that the strongest of these is actually two components .",
    "the structure in the line matches well the component structure .",
    "the line shows two additional components at more negative velocities , only one of which is strong enough to appear in the 1355.598    line .",
    "the line is usually a good tracer of h@xmath52 @xcite , so it appears that the molecular hydrogen velocity structure along the sight line is not complex .",
    "the strong 1302.168    line is completely saturated and shows absorption extending over @xmath5330  kms@xmath28 , along with damping wings at even higher velocities .",
    "both sight lines contain a significant amount of h@xmath52 .",
    "most of the unlabeled features in figures 1 and 2 are h@xmath52 absorption lines .",
    "lines from the lower rotational levels ( @xmath54,1,2 ) are mostly saturated .",
    "these contain most of the h@xmath52 column density , so we did not attempt to determine the h@xmath52 abundance . however , based on the column toward hd  195965 , we estimate roughly @xmath55  @xmath56 on that sight line @xcite .",
    "the hd  191877 sight line probably contains a similar amount .",
    "there are clearly multiple components along the hd  195965 sight line ( revealed by the line ) , but they fall within @xmath5315  kms@xmath28 , so at _ fuse _  resolution the h@xmath52 distribution can be treated as a single component ( see   4.1 ) .",
    "the widths of the lines in the spectra of both stars ( and the stis lines in the hd  195965 spectrum ) are larger than the resolution of the data .",
    "this suggests that there are no strong , narrow ( unresolved ) features on either sight line .",
    "we can use the stis data for hd  195965 to show this more conclusively for that sight line .",
    "figure 5 shows the apparent column density of derived from two different lines : 1295.653    and 1296.174   .",
    "although the oscillator strengths differ by a factor of @xmath273 @xcite , the derived column density is very similar for the two lines , supporting the conclusion that narrow , saturated features are not present toward hd  195965 .",
    "( see savage & sembach 1991 for a discussion of apparent column density profile comparisons . ) in other words , while cold clouds are clearly present , they do not contain a significant amount of the material along these sight lines .",
    "most of the column arises in the diffuse ism .    to test the effects of the lower resolution of _ fuse _  on the analysis of blended lines , we smoothed the absorption profiles of the 1295.653    and 1296.174    lines in the stis data by 15 kms@xmath28  to approximate fuse resolution .",
    "we then determined the column densities by summing the apparent optical depth over the line profile .",
    "the total column density derived from the 1295.653    line is @xmath15()=@xmath57 @xmath56 , while that derived from the 1296.174    line is @xmath15()=@xmath58 @xmath56 .",
    "both values are well within the @xmath22 uncertainties of the column densities derived from the unsmoothed profiles , @xmath15()=@xmath59 @xmath56 from the 1295.653    line , and @xmath15()=@xmath60 @xmath56 from the 1296.174    line .",
    "the measured equivalent widths are @xmath61  m  and @xmath62  m , similar to the weaker and lines along the hd  195965 sight line .",
    "we also carried out this test on the lines shown in figure 3 . toward hd  191877 ,",
    "the column densities from the unsmoothed profile , @xmath63 @xmath56 , agrees well with the column density derived from the smoothed profile , @xmath64 @xmath56 .",
    "the test was harder to perform on the hd  195965 sight line because of residuals from poorly removed airglow lines , but the column density derived from the unsmoothed profile , @xmath65 @xmath56 , is in marginal agreement with that derived from the smoothed profile , @xmath66 @xmath56 . with measured equivalent widths of @xmath67  m  and @xmath68  m  toward hd  195965 and hd  191877 , respectively , these lines are similar in strength to the stronger , , and lines along both sight lines .",
    "these tests provide more evidence that there are no unresolved , saturated components along either sight line .",
    "the simplest approach to analyzing the chemical composition along a line of sight is to measure the equivalent widths of all lines of a species , assume the material lies in a single component , and construct a doppler - broadened curve of growth ( cog ) . since the _ fuse _  bandpass contains all of the transitions of except for ly@xmath2 , in principle",
    "this is possible using the current data . in reality , many of the transitions are not usable due to interference from neighboring absorption lines .",
    "table 3 lists some of the important interfering lines for the unusable transitions along these sight lines .",
    "the lower order lines are blended with strong lines , while higher order lines are often blended with strong h@xmath52 lines . however , in the spectra of each sight line there are four transitions that were either free of blending or were blended with weak h@xmath52 lines that could be removed : @xmath69919.102 , @xmath69920.713 , @xmath69922.900 , and @xmath69925.974 .",
    "a more complex but potentially more accurate method is to model the absorption lines with a profile fitting program .",
    "this technique can be especially advantageous when the velocity structure of the cloud components is complicated . in this section",
    "we describe both of these approaches to determining the abundances toward hd  195965 and hd  191877 .",
    "there are many h@xmath52 lines in the spectral range around the deuterium lines , and several can potentially affect the measurement of the d i equivalent widths .",
    "the lines that affect the four lines used in this analysis are listed in table 4 .",
    "we include only lines with rotational level j@xmath705 , because no higher @xmath71 level lines were found in the spectra .",
    "the lines listed in table 4 are expected to be strong enough to affect the lines .",
    "the 920.803    line does not fall within the 920.713     line , but it could affect the continuum on the red side of the line .    to remove the contamination , a line of the same rotational level in a clean part of the spectrum was found to use as a template , following @xcite .",
    "the template line was chosen from the same detector segment as the line being corrected , in order to avoid differences in the line spread function between segments .",
    "the parameters of the template lines are listed in table 4 .",
    "a gaussian function was fitted to the template line , and the fit was scaled in optical depth space by the ratio of the @xmath72 values to have the strength appropriate for the contaminating line .",
    "the template line was chosen to have as close to the same value of @xmath72 as the contaminating line as possible in order to avoid saturation effects .",
    "the scaled fit was then shifted to the wavelength of the contaminating line and divided out of the observed spectrum around the d i lines .",
    "another h@xmath52 line close in wavelength to the line was used to register the position of the scaled line before dividing it out , in order to compensate for any relative errors in the wavelength scale .",
    "figures 6 and 7 show the corrected profiles ( solid lines ) along with the uncorrected profiles ( dashed lines ) for both sight lines as a function of lsr velocity .      once the h@xmath52 lines were removed , it was necessary to determine the location of the continuum at the position of the absorption lines .",
    "this was done by fitting low order polynomials across the lines .",
    "the situation is complicated by the fact that the lines fall on the blue damping wings of the associated lines .",
    "we used the steeply - sloped blue sides of the lines to constrain the fits , and when possible used the red wings of the lines as a guide in determining the optimal continuum .",
    "figures 6 and 7 show the absorption profiles of the four lines after correction for h@xmath52 for hd  195965 and hd  191877 , respectively , along with the adopted continuum placement .",
    "we measured the equivalent widths of the lines using the procedures described by @xcite .",
    "the lines were integrated over a velocity range that depended upon the details of the local continuum and line blending .",
    "the equivalent widths are listed in table 5 for hd  195965 and table 6 for hd  191877 .",
    "a theoretical single - component cog was fit to the equivalent widths by minimizing @xmath73 while varying the column density @xmath15 and the doppler parameter @xmath47 .",
    "the final cogs are shown in figures 8 and 9 for hd  195965 and hd  191877 , respectively .",
    "the final uncertainties in the equivalent widths were determined from the dispersion of the points about the cog , assuming that a single component cog is appropriate for the sight lines .",
    "these error bars are a combination of statistical uncertainties and continuum fitting errors , as described by @xcite , and include the effects of fixed - pattern noise .    placing the continuum near the 925.974    line was problematic in the spectra of both stars , because of absorption from other elements on the blue side of the absorption line ( see figures 6 and 7 ) .",
    "this results in large uncertainties in the equivalent widths .",
    "because of this the 925.974    line is not given as much weight as the other lines in the cog fitting .",
    "table 7 contains the cog column density results for both sight lines .",
    "the inset in each cog figure shows a contour plot of the @xmath74 values in the @xmath15 and @xmath47 dimensions , with contours of the minimum @xmath74 + 1 , 4 , and 9 shown ( corresponding to 1 , 2 , and 3@xmath75 ) .",
    "the quoted error bars for @xmath15 shown in table 7 are the maximum extent of the projection of the 2@xmath75 contour onto the @xmath15 axis , and likewise for @xmath47 ( listed in the captions to figures 8 and 9 ) .",

    "the free parameters characterize the physical properties of the interstellar clouds ( radial velocities , column densities , temperatures , micro - turbulent velocities ) as well as the continuum shapes ( modeled with polynomials ) and possible instrumental effects ( line spread function widths , wavelength solution variations ) .",
    "the error bars are obtained using the standard @xmath74 method ; they include statistical as well as systematic uncertainties @xcite .",

    "no lines were included in the fits because they are all saturated .",

    "we fit a single component voigt profile to the normalized line using an oscillator strength f = 0.04887 and a natural damping constant @xmath86  s@xmath28 ( morton 1991 ) .",
    "the best fit model has a central velocity @xmath87 kms@xmath28 , b = @xmath88 kms@xmath28 , and @xmath89 ( ) = @xmath90 ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "this column density is in excellent agreement with the cog result listed in table  7 .",
    "the single - component fit to the 1302.169 line is shown in figure  13 .",
    "the fit shown in the figure reproduces the observed absorption profile core and damping wings well , with the minor exception of a slight underestimate in the absorption strength between + 21 and + 40 kms@xmath28 .",
    "this additional absorption is likely due to very low column density gas along the sight line that does not contribute much to the total column density ; a component with an column density of @xmath91 @xmath56 could account for this minor discrepancy .",
    "experimentation with additional components does not change the best - fit result substantially . performing a fit with",
    "the column density divided among two components separated by @xmath27 12 kms@xmath28  as suggested by the 1355.598   line shown in figure  4 yields a best fit nearly indistinguishable from the single - component fit shown in figure  13 .",
    "the 1302.169   line is very strong , and can be used to test for the presence of high - velocity components that might contribute to the column density of but be outside of velocity integration range for other elements .",
    "the most obvious candidate is the component between + 21 and + 40 kms@xmath28 , which contributes only @xmath15()@xmath91 @xmath56 , corresponding to @xmath15()@xmath92 @xmath56 using the o / h ratio of @xmath93 from @xcite , or @xmath94 of the total column density ( see   6 ) .",
    "no other components this strong are visible in figure  13 , so we conclude that high - velocity is not an issue for the hd  195965 sight line .",
    "the stis spectrum of hd  195965 contains both the optically thin 1355.598    line and the damped 1302.169    line .",
    "we can use this fact to test for consistency between the oscillator strengths of the two lines ( see sofia , cardelli , & savage 1994 ) .",
    "the column densities derived from these lines are @xmath15()@xmath95 @xmath56 and @xmath96 @xmath56 , respectively ( uncertainties are @xmath22 ) .",
    "these results are identical within the uncertainty , which suggests that any error the oscillator strength of either line is less than 20% ( the uncertainty in the 1355.598    equivalent width ) . the oscillator strength for the 1355.598    line listed in table 5 includes the correction from @xcite .",
    "we have re - measured the column densities for the hd  191877 and hd  195965 sight lines using existing stis and _ iue _  data .",
    "single - component voigt profiles were fit to the absorption toward each star .",
    "the fits were limited to the 1170 to 1260 spectral region , with the overall continuum levels determined at longer wavelengths , as needed . for both sight lines ,",
    "the fit is insensitive to the assumption of a single absorbing component . adding additional components or changing the @xmath47-value of the absorption ( assumed to be in the 1 to 100 kms@xmath28  range ) did not alter the fits significantly since the quality of the fits is governed primarily by the steep walls of the line cores and the broad radiation - damping wings .",
    "the voigt profile fitting method has been described in detail for determinations in previous _ fuse _  d / h papers ( see moos et al . 2002 , and references therein ) .",
    "our analyses follow many of these same principles and methods .    for hd  195965",
    ", we used the stis e140h data available in this wavelength region ( see  2.2 ) to determine the column density .",
    "we paid special attention to making sure that the flux calibration mapping at the ends of the individual echelle orders was consistent between adjoining orders .",
    "scattered light is not a significant source of uncertainty in the final measurement since we used the damping wings of the lines rather than the saturated portion of the line core to determine the column density .",
    "we find a best - fit value of log @xmath15 ( ) = 20.95@xmath530.05 ( @xmath4 ) for the fit to the high quality stis data shown in figure 14 .",
    "this value is slightly higher than , but within the errors of , the former value of 20.90+/-0.09 ( @xmath22 ) found by @xcite using the `` continuum reconstruction '' technique on existing _ iue _  data .",
    "the reconstruction method and profile fitting methods are complimentary to each other .",
    "the fit is shown in the bottom panel of figure 14 , together with the fits appropriate for the @xmath97 column density ranges ( dashed lines ) .",
    "for this sight line , the higher quality stis data more tightly defines the extent of the absorption than the _ iue _  data , and as can be seen in the top panel of figure 14 , the resulting fit is consistent with the _ iue _  small aperture data analyzed previously .    the primary difficulty in fitting the stis profile of hd  195965 arises in the wavelength region between 1222 and 1225  , where the fit slightly overestimates the amount of absorption present .",
    "we explored other models that fit this region better ( at the expense of fit quality at other wavelengths ) and found that in all cases the resulting column density was within the listed uncertainties .",
    "therefore , while we are uncertain of the exact cause of the discrepancy in this wavelength region , we believe the resulting column density is a robust estimate . note that this portion of the stis spectrum contains the border between two echelle orders , and that the anomaly is not apparent in the _ iue _  spectrum .    for hd  191877",
    ", we re - examined the _ iue _  small aperture data ( swp02837 ) available for this sight line .",
    "a more recent exposure ( swp148425 ) taken through the small aperture clearly has problems with the flux levels as a result of poor centering ; we did not use this low quality spectrum .",
    "we find log @xmath15 ( ) = 21.05@xmath530.10 ( @xmath4 ) , which again is slightly larger than , but consistent with , the previous estimate of 20.90+/-0.10 ( @xmath22 ) found by @xcite .",
    "the fit is shown in figure 15 , along with the @xmath97 error bars . as can be seen from this figure , a fit with a smaller column , like the one preferred by the previous investigators , is clearly below the true column density ( see the @xmath98 [ log @xmath99 model in the figure ) .",
    "diplas & savage note that there may be a small amount ( @xmath100 dex ) of contamination by stellar absorption in the ly@xmath2 profile .",
    "this contamination does not affect our @xmath15 ( ) estimate significantly .",
    "the sight lines analyzed in this paper are the longest ones for which the column densities have been determined with _ fuse_. as such , they present the opportunity to look for variations in / , / , and / beyond the local ism sight lines presented by @xcite . table 8 contains column density ratios of various elements toward both stars , along with the mean values for the local ism from @xcite . in this section",
    "we discuss the behavior of these column density ratios beyond the local ism .",
    "the deuterium abundances along seven sight lines have been analyzed with _ fuse _",
    "five of these had both and measurements , and the results were consistent with a constant value of d / h in the local ism .",
    "earlier _ copernicus _",
    "observations showed evidence for variations in d / h at larger distances ( see vidal - madjar & gry 1984 for a review ) , evidence which was strengthened by subsequent _ imaps _",
    "investigations @xcite . the main obstacle to verifying and understanding this variation is the paucity of suitable deuterium sight lines that probe distances @xmath101250 pc .",
    "figure 16 shows the d / h ratios for hd  195965 and hd  191877 plotted as a function of distance from the sun , along with five of the seven original _ fuse _  sight lines with reliable measurements , and several others from _ hst _ , _ imaps _ , and _ copernicus _  ( see moos et al",
    "the d / h ratios toward both stars are lower than the average value found for the original seven _ fuse _",
    "sight lines .",
    "this contrasts with the lack of variation seen in the local ism .",
    "the new sight lines support the existence of variations in the d / h ratio at distances larger than a few hundred pc , as also suggested by _ imaps _",
    "and_copernicus_.    in the simplest model of chemical evolution , stellar processing ( astration ) leads to a decline in the d / h ratio because d is easily destroyed in stars .",
    "thus , the d / h ratio is expected to vary among regions of the galaxy that have undergone different amounts of star formation in the past , provided that the gas in these regions has not mixed ( _ e.g. _ tosi et al .",
    "1998 ; chiappini et al . 2002 ) . in a small volume like the local ism ( @xmath102 pc )",
    ", @xcite showed that the time between supernova @xmath103 is roughly equal to the mixing time scale ( assumed to be the sound crossing time @xmath104 ) , suggesting that the gas in such a region is well - mixed .",
    "if a larger region is considered , say 1000 pc in radius to approximate the scales probed by hd  195965 and hd  191877 , the crossing time increases by a factor of 10 , while the time between supernovae decreases by a factor of 100 , so that @xmath105 .",
    "supernovae are not distributed randomly over this region but are spatially correlated in regions of star formation , meaning that substantial inhomogeneities will arise between star - forming regions and more quiescent regions . for these reasons",
    "it is not surprising to see variations over the distances probed by hd  195965 and hd  191877 .",
    "a more precise treatment of mixing in the ism was carried out by @xcite . using numerical simulations",
    ", they found that the mixing time scales were a few times 10@xmath106 years .",
    "chemical inhomogeneities in the ism are long - lived , so variations in d / h are expected over 1000  pc length scales . in fact , since the mixing time scales increase only slightly with length scale in their models , it is unlikely that the local ism ( _ e.g. , _ the original seven _ fuse _",
    "sight lines ) would have a constant d / h value if any sources of inhomogeneities ( _ i.e. , _ supernovae ) have occurred within the past @xmath107 years .",
    "we have investigated several alternative explanations for the low d / h values .",
    "one possibility is that some of the d column is in high - velocity components which are outside of the velocity integration range used to determine @xmath15 ( ) @xcite .",
    "we have used the 1302.169    line in the stis spectrum of hd  195965 to rule this out for that sight line ( see   5 ) . note that @xmath108 of the column would have to be missed",
    "if the d / h ratio for the hd  191877 sight line were as high as the @xcite mean local ism value .",
    "figure 7 shows that this is not the case , although we can not rule out a much smaller systematic offset for hd  191877 .",
    "a second possibility is that a significant amount of d is locked up in hd molecules . to test this idea ,",
    "we have measured the equivalent widths of several strong , isolated lyman series hd lines in the _ fuse_spectra : ( 3 - 0 )  r(0 )  1066.271   , ( 5 - 0 )  r(0 )  1042.847   , and ( 4 - 0 )  r(0 )  1054.288   .",
    "the column densities derived from the equivalent widths are @xmath109 @xmath56 for the hd  195965 sight line , and @xmath110 @xmath56 for the hd  191877 sight line . for both sight lines",
    "this is @xmath111% of the total d column density , much lower than the uncertainty in @xmath15 ( ) .",
    "the d / o and o / h ratios toward hd  195965 in table 8 are quite different from the average values in the local ism found by @xcite .",
    "this is a surprising result , since @xcite found very little variation in o / h in their survey , which covered distances and column densities similar to those of the sight lines in this paper .",
    "both the and column densities toward hd  195965 were determined through at least two independent methods , with very similar results .",
    "the was measured using both _ iue _  and stis data , and the was measured with a single - component cog which combined _ fuse _  and stis data , as well as independent estimates from the optically thin 1355.598    line and the damped 1302.169  line in the stis spectrum .",
    "both of these column densities are therefore quite firmly established , and we believe that it is very unlikely that there is a substantial systematic error in either quantity .",
    "hd  195965 appears to lie on a very high metallicity sight line , with supersolar o / h @xcite .",
    "this may be a region where the signature of stellar processed gas is still visible ( as is not the case for the local bubble ) .",
    "@xcite found that this star is in the cygnus ob7 association .",
    "if so , it may be in a peculiar region , perhaps in a metal - enriched cloud of ejecta from the star itself or a neighbor . since gas with high metallicity",
    "is thought to have undergone stellar processing , d / h in such gas is expected to be low .",
    "this expected anticorrelation between o / h ( or n / h ) and d / h was not seen in the first seven _ fuse _  sight lines , although it could have been masked by the small number of sight lines studied @xcite .",
    "figure 17 compares the o / h and d / h value for hd  195965 with those of the original seven _ fuse _",
    "sight lines .",
    "unfortunately hd  195965 is the only point at high metallicity , so no firm conclusions can be drawn .",
    "however , it is possible that this sight line shows evidence of the expected anticorrelation in the ism ( see also steigman 2002 ) .",
    "note that an error in the column density toward hd  195965 would tend to move that point along a diagonal line with a positive slope , and thus could not produce the expected trend of decreasing d / h with rising o / h .",
    "the hd  191877 sight line lacks stis data , so we could not constrain the and abundances with multiple estimates . for these reasons we are less confident in the column densities found for the hd  191877 sight line . as discussed in   5 ,",
    "the derived log @xmath15 ( ) is very uncertain , although our preferred value , found by coupling the @xmath47-values of and , is consistent with the _ fuse _  local ism ratio and the @xcite ratio .",
    "unfortunately , with the existing information , we can not make any strong conclusions about o / h toward hd  191877 .",
    "the n / h ratios toward hd  195965 and hd  191877 in table 8 are higher than the average values in the local ism found by @xcite .",
    "figure 18 shows a plot of n / h versus d / h along both sight lines , compared to the four _ fuse _  sight lines for which n / h was measured .",
    "the figure is very suggestive of an anticorrelation between d / h and n / h .    complicating the interpretation of this plot is the fact n / h ratio is susceptible to ionization effects , especially at low column densities which do not provide adequate shielded from ionizing photons , such as the column densities along the local ism sight lines @xcite .",
    "the dashed line in figure 18 shows the ism value of n / h found by @xcite .",
    "the sight lines used in that study had higher column densities than the _ fuse _  local ism sight lines , so the _ fuse _  sight lines are very likely underestimating n / h , because a significant fraction of n is ionized .",
    "the apparent trend in figure 18 may simply reflect the tendency for @xmath15()/@xmath15 ( ) to decrease with increasing @xmath15 ( ) .",
    "however , an anticorrelation between d and n abundances would be expected if d is destroyed in stars while n is produced ( _ e.g. _ steigman et al . 2002 ) .",
    "the overabundance of heavy elements accompanied by the underabundance of d seems to fit well within a simple chemical evolution scenario .",
    "while ionization effects probably play a role in the high n / h ratio on these sight lines , they may not be the only factor . a comprehensive n / h survey using _ fuse _",
    "spectra is currently underway , and may shed light on this issue .    several sight lines do not follow the expected trend of low d / h accompanied by high n / h or o / h .",
    "@xcite found a low o / h ratio toward bd+28@xmath1124211 with _ fuse _ , while their d / h ratio is close to the local ism mean .",
    "@xcite found a low d / h toward @xmath113 orionis using _ imaps _ , but also a somewhat low n / h ratio .",
    "these deviations suggest that the simple picture of increasing heavy elements abundances with decreasing d / h is not complete .",
    "measuring d / h values in the milky way becomes increasingly difficult as @xmath15 ( ) increases , perhaps reaching a fundamental confusion limit .",
    "the cogs in figures 8 and 9 show that the high order lyman transitions are close to saturation . at higher column densities",
    ", these transitions will fall on the flat part of the cog and will not give precise column density information .",
    "even higher order transitions at shorter wavelengths , where the lines might not yet be saturated at higher column density , are not useful because the transitions begin to blend together .",
    "these facts make it unlikely that many galactic disk sight lines more distant than those studied here will be useful for d / h measurements",
    ". however , the sight lines analyzed in this paper demonstrate that d / h properties over the distance range from 500 to 2500 pc can be explored with _ fuse _ , even if these sight lines contain a significant amount of h@xmath52 .",
    "this first glimpse at d / h in this distance range suggests that it will be very useful for understanding mixing and chemical evolution in the ism .",
    "the chemical evolution model of @xcite predicts an increase in d / h with galactocentric radius , accompanied by a decrease in n / h and o / h , leading to a pronounced gradient in d / o and n / o .",
    "the gas in the outer parts of the galaxy has undergone less stellar processing , and in fact",
    "@xcite predict that the d / h ratios in the outer disk will approach the primordial value .",
    "the sight lines studied here have roughly the same galactocentric radii as the local ism sight lines of @xcite , so we can not test this model , but with _ fuse_observations of sight lines in the inner and outer galactic disk this may prove possible .",
