    "although the standard model ( sm ) @xcite , of the strong and electroweak interactions describes correctly particle physics at present energies , one of its basic ingredients , the scalar higgs sector , still remains untested . in the sm ,",
    "the higgs sector consists of a single @xmath5 doublet , and after spontaneous symmetry breaking ( ssb ) it remains a physical state , the higgs boson ( @xmath6 ) , whose mass is not predicted in the theory . on the other hand ,",
    "the sm is not expected to be the ultimate theoretical structure responsible for electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) @xcite .",
    "one of the most simple extensions of the sm is the so called two higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) .",
    "there are four classes of 2hdm which naturally avoid tree - level flavor - changing neutral currents that can be induced by higgs boson exchange @xcite .",
    "these models include a higgs sector with two scalar doublets , which give masses to the up and down - type fermions as well as the gauge bosons .",
    "particularly interesting is the model ii , in this model one of the higgs scalar doublet couples to the up - components of isodoublets while the second one to the down - components .",
    "model ii is that one which is present in susy theories .",
    "the 2hdm(ii ) has a rich structure and predicts interesting phenomenology @xcite .",
    "the physical spectrum consists of two neutral cp - even states ( @xmath7 ) and one cp - odd ( @xmath8 ) , as well as a pair of charged scalar particles ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "the charged higgs boson in this model has the following lower mass limits @xcite and @xcite : @xmath10 and @xmath11    large - scale neutrino telescopes @xcite have as a main goal the detection of ultrahigh - energy ( uhe ) cosmic neutrinos ( @xmath12 ev ) produced outside the atmosphere ( neutrinos produced by galactic cosmic rays interacting with interstellar gas , and extragalactic neutrinos ) @xcite .",
    "uhe neutrinos can be detected by observing long - range muons and tau - leptons decays produced in charged - current neutrino - nucleon interactions .",
    "uhe tau - neutrinos are generated through neutrino oscillations @xcite .",
    "the detection of uhe neutrinos will provide us with the possibility to observe @xmath13-collisions with a neutrino energy in the range @xmath14 ev @xmath15 ev and a target nucleon at rest .",
