    "the observation of x - rays provides the most direct view of the region of interaction between the ejecta from a core - collapse supernova ( sn ) and the circumstellar medium of the progenitor star ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this circumstellar interaction gives rise to copious x - ray emission within days to months of the supernova explosion , in contrast to x - ray emission that occurs in the later supernova remnant ( snr ) during the free expansion , adiabatic , or radiative phases .",
    "the circumstellar medium is established by the wind - driven mass loss from the progenitor and is heated by the outgoing sn shock wave while the sn ejecta are heated by a reverse shock wave .    at the same time , this interaction is expected to produce nonthermal radio radiation ; in recent years , several young sne have been found to be emitting in the radio bands ( see @xcite ) .",
    "relativistic electrons and magnetic fields in the region , which give rise to the radio emission , may be built up by acceleration in the shock wave and field amplification through rayleigh - taylor instabilities .",
    "the detection of strong radio emission from a sn provides good empirical evidence of circumstellar interaction of ejecta , and such a sn is a probable emitter at x - ray wavelengths as well .",
    "study of the sn x - ray and radio light curves gives an indication of how the shock - front radius changes with time .",
    "the latter in turn can be related to the supernova gas radial density profile .",
    "the observations of x - ray emission from the six supernovae discovered prior to 1995 have been reviewed by @xcite . currently , there are thirteen known x - ray emitters , most of which are classified as type ii sne on the basis of optical spectra .",
    "sn1998bw ( a type ic sn ) has been associated with a gamma - ray burst source grb980425 and is a prototype of the collapsar model involving a rotating massive star @xcite .",
    "since the predictions of the models of grbs regarding afterglows are different on account of different immediate circumsource medium , it is important to detect and monitor the x - ray emission from sne to understand the processes responsible for the early and long - term electromagnetic emission .",
    "in addition , the environments of type ii and type ib sne are expected to be different due to differing scenarios of mass loss from the progenitor star .",
    "x - ray emission from sne that turns on shortly after the explosion and remains active for a long time is most likely due to the thermal emission from the hot gas produced in the interaction between the shock wave from the explosion and the circumstellar medium .",
    "x - ray emission with a temperature of @xmath10 1 kev ( which falls into the _ asca _ spectral band ) results from a reverse shock that propagates back into the expanding debris .",
    "the reverse shock is in turn is developed due to the interaction of the freely expanding supernova ejecta catching up to the decelerating ( outgoing ) shocked shell @xcite .",
    "the temperature behind the outgoing shock is typically @xmath1110 kev and therefore the bulk of this radiation detected by _ asca _ would appear in its higher energy bands . in the circumstellar interaction model ,",
    "the shocked supernova ejecta is the dominant source of x - rays because of its higher density and lower temperature .    in this paper",
    ", we report on an x - ray observation of sn1979c using _ asca _ and an analysis of a _",
    "chandra _ observation obtained from the data archive .",
    "these observations provide the first constraint on the x - ray flux in the energy band higher than 2 kev for a type ii@xmath12 sn .",
    "sn1979c was discovered in the optical by @xcite near maximum optical light ( m@xmath13 ) on april 19 , 1979 in the weakly - barred , almost face - on spiral galaxy ngc  4321 ( m100 ) .",
    "this galaxy is a member of the virgo s cluster , at a distance of 17.1 mpc @xcite .",
    "three other sne have been observed in this galaxy this century : sn1901b , sn1914a , and sn1959e .",
    "the j2000 position of the sn is at @xmath14 = @xmath15 , @xmath16 = @xmath17 , offset to the southeast from the center of ngc  4321 by @xmath1100 arc seconds .",
    "sn 1979c has been detected in the radio and x - ray bands and is classified as a type ii@xmath0 sn .",
    "the radio observation points to a probable explosion date of april 4 , 1979 @xcite .",
    "the supernova is thought to have originated from a red supergiant progenitor with m@xmath18 @xcite .",
    "the sn shell expansion velocity near maximum light was @xmath19 ( see for example , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite .",
    "sn1979c was observed by the einstein hri three times : in 1979 june ( @xmath14 ks ) , 1979 december ( @xmath113 ks ) , and 1980 july ( @xmath124 ks ) .",
    "the upper limits for these observations , in the 0.1 - 4.5 kev band and assuming a 5 kev raymond - smith plasma , are : june : @xmath20 ; december : @xmath21 ; and july : @xmath22 at a 3@xmath2 confidence level and calculated for a distance of 17.1 mpc @xcite .",
    "an analysis of the combined einstein data , with a total duration @xmath141 ks between days 64 and 454 after the explosion , gave an upper limit of 5.9 @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "the foreground column density of neutral hydrogen is n@xmath24 ( using the dust maps of @xcite and the e@xmath25-n@xmath26 relation of @xcite ) .",
    "an x - ray observation by the _ rosat _",
    "hri in 1995 june detected a source coincident with the position of sn1979c for the first time , more than 16 years after the explosion ( source h25 , @xcite ) .",
    "the _ rosat _",
    "hri position is @xmath27 , @xmath28 ( j2000 ) , within about 2.7@xmath29 with the position determined by radio interferometry @xcite .",
    "the measured count rate is @xmath30 .",
    "the corresponding 0.2 - 2.4 kev flux and luminosity are @xmath31 and @xmath32 respectively , assuming a 5 kev thermal spectrum .",
    "ngc 4321 was observed by _ asca _ on december 18 - 19 , 1997 .",
    "the solid state imaging spectrometers ( sis ) had useful exposure times of 24.3 ks ( sis0 ) and 25.2 ks ( sis1 ) ; the gas scintillation imaging spectrometers ( gis ) had exposure times of 27.5 ks ( gis2 ) and 28.1 ks ( gis3 ) .",
    "the nominal pointing position , @xmath14 = @xmath33 , @xmath16 = @xmath34 , placed the galaxy and the supernova towards the center of the best calibrated sis chips ( chip 1 of sis0 and chip 3 of sis1 ) .",
    "a combined sis0+sis1 image is shown in figure 1 . a 3@xmath35 diameter half power response circle",
    "is shown superposed at the location of sn1979c .",
    "the circle approximately matches the size of the d@xmath36 cicle .",
    "emission associated with the known agglomeration of sources in the central region of ngc  4321 is clearly seen . on the other hand ,",
    "no point source is evident in the circle .",
    "a point source detection task failed to detect sn1979c in either the sis or gis image .    placing an upper limit on the _ asca _ band flux from sn1979c is complicated by contamination from the integrated flux from the sources in the nuclear region of ngc 4321 .",
    "the center of ngc 4321 is only 100 arc seconds from sn1979c , resulting in a non - negligible overlap of point responses .",
    "furthermore , the emission from the galaxy is clearly broader than that produced by a single unresolved source . thus determining a count rate from sn1979c requires subtraction both of diffuse background and the contribution of the integrated flux from the other sources in the galaxy .",
    "the background subtracted counts in the defined extraction circles around the galaxy and sn are 178 @xmath37 counts and 82 @xmath38 counts respectively . as the overlap between the two circles centered about the galaxy and sn is estimated to be @xmath10.4 , the background- and galaxy - subtracted sn signal is 11 @xmath39 counts in the full 0.4 - 10 kev band .",
    "the implied 3@xmath2 upper limit of the count rate is 2.0 @xmath40 cps .",
    "a similar analysis of sis1 data of 25 ks exposure , combined with the above 24 ks exposure for sis0 , gives a combined upper limit to the count rate of 1.2 @xmath40 cps .",
    "the corresponding upper limit to the combined data from gis2 and gis3 ( 28 ks each ) gives 8 @xmath41 cps .",
    "the net exposures , total galaxy- and background - subtracted net source counts and their 1 @xmath2 errors together with the 3@xmath2 upper limits on the sn count rates for sis ( s0 and s1 ) and gis ( g2 and g3 ) are given in table 1 .",
    "the above sis combined upper limit corresponds to a flux limit of @xmath42 in the 0.4 - 10.0 kev band for a thermal bremsstrahlung spectrum with t = 3 kev ( @xmath43 ) . for kt",
    "= 5 kev , the flux limit is @xmath130% higher , @xmath18.2 @xmath7 10@xmath44 erg s@xmath4 .    in table 1 we also list the detected x - ray source fluxes ( or the upper limits ) for the previous observations obtained with _ einstein _ and _ rosat _ along with their respective band - passes and luminosities at different epochs .",
    "the acis observation was obtained on 1999 november 6 ( observation i d = 400 ; pi = g .",
    "garmire ) as part of a survey of low - luminosity galaxy nuclei @xcite .",
    "the total exposure time was 2.5 ksec .",
    "the nucleus was centered on the back - illuminated ( s3 ) chip ; each chip is 8@xmath45 by 8@xmath45 in size , so the exposure , while short , potentially captures emission from sn1979c .",
    "figure  [ chan_fig ] shows the image of the events in the 0.4 - 2.4 kev band , approximating the _ rosat _ band .",
    "the nucleus is clearly visible . using a circle of radius 3 pixels , which encloses @xmath192% of the flux , and centered on the position of sn1979c ,",
    "21@xmath467 counts are extracted .",
    "the corresponding flux and luminosity , for an adopted 3 kev bremsstrahlung spectrum are 4.6@xmath710@xmath8 erg s@xmath4 @xmath5 and 1.6@xmath710@xmath44 erg s@xmath4 , respectively .",
    "these values are comparable to the values obtained by @xcite from their _ rosat _ hri observation . while formally the acis measurement shows an increase of a factor @xmath12 above the _ rosat _ result , that measurement requires confirmation with a longer exposure .",
    "only an upper limit is possible in the 2 - 10 kev band ; the upper limit is @xmath11.1@xmath710@xmath44 erg s@xmath4 ( 3@xmath47 ) .",
    "this upper limit is similar to the limit on the nucleus reported in @xcite .",
    "a longer exposure is necessary to establish whether sn1979c is deficient in x - rays above 2 kev .",
    "the _ rosat _ hri flux from the measurement of @xcite in the 0.5 - 2.0 kev band ( for the same spectrum and absorption column for sn1979c ) is @xmath48 which corresponds to a luminosity of @xmath17@xmath710@xmath49 ergs s@xmath4 . the _ asca _ and _ chandra _ flux limits are @xmath13@xmath710@xmath8 erg s@xmath4 @xmath5 or a luminosity of 1 @xmath7 10@xmath44 erg s@xmath4 . for the energy bands in common between the two satellites ( @xmath10.5 - 2.0 kev ) ,",
    "_ rosat _ provides the more sensitive measure ; above 2 kev , a longer exposure using _ chandra _ will clearly reduce the upper limit .    until now almost all sne detected in the x - ray were measured in the lower energy band ( 0.1 - 2.0 kev ) of rosat .",
    "our reported measurement of sn1979c here gives the flux limit in a harder energy band ( @xmath50 2 kev ) for the first time for a type ii@xmath9 sn ( the only other x - ray detected type ii@xmath9 is sn1980k ) .",
    "the outgoing shock wave expanding through circumstellar material creates hotter emission compared to the reverse shock wave .",
    "the measurement of sn x - ray fluxes in higher energy bands constitutes an important goal .",
    "most extragalactic sne detected so far in the radio are extremely bright compared to galactic supernova remnants .",
    "for example , although sn1970 g is fainter than about half a dozen radio supernovae ( some of which like sn1988z and sn1986j are nearly 20 - 30 times as bright at 6 cm ) , it has a peak spectral luminosity at these wavelengths that is nearly an order of magnitude greater than the brightest galactic supernova remnant , cassiopeia a @xcite .",
    "strong radio emission from a supernova provides good empirical evidence of circumstellar interaction and such a supernova is a probable emitter at x - ray wavelengths as well .",
    "one expects strong x - ray emission from sn1979c .    to estimate the expected x - ray fluxes from sn1979c on the basis of its radio emission , we scaled its radio flux density ( 8.3 mjy ) with respect to sn1980k ( another type ii - l sn ) , as reported by @xcite .",
    "the ratio of the respective 6 cm radio flux densities of sn1979c and sn1980k ( the latter sn s radio flux is taken from weiler et al . as 2.6 mjy ) is multiplied by the absorption- corrected einstein x - ray flux of 0.03 @xmath51jy at 1 kev as reported by @xcite for sn1980k , to produce an expected x - ray flux of 1.1 @xmath52 in the ( 0.5- 2.0 ) kev band for sn1979c .",
    "both the _ rosat _ detection of the x - ray emission as well as the _ asca _ and _ chandra _ upper limits lie below this expected value .",
    "this lower than expected @xmath53 may mean that the x - ray and radio emission properties of sne can be quite variable from one environment to another .",
    "in other words , the emissions in the two bands are not directly scalable in a universal way . or the x - ray emission could be more strongly time variable than the radio emission . since the x - ray emission from a supernova",
    "is found to be primarily from the reverse shock region , the variable outer supernova density profile can affect the x - ray luminosity , but is unlikely to affect the radio luminosity to the same extent .",
    "the detection probability of a sn against a bright galactic background can be limited by a given telescope s half power diameter , especially when a sn fades with time .",
    "the higher spatial resolution of _ chandra _ improves the detection capability in this regard and is important for their higher energy sensitivity .",
    "the authors explicitly thank the referee for one of the speediest reports any of us have received .",
    "the authors are grateful to the members of the _ asca _ team .",
    "one of us ( a.r . ) was a senior research associate of the national research council at nasa / goddard space flight center during the course of this work and acknowledges support from the nrc and _ asca _ guest observer program .",
