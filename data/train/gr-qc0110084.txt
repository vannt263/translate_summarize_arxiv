    "in einstein - maxwell ( em ) theory black holes are completely characterized by their mass , their electric and magnetic charge and their angular momentum , i.e.  em black holes have `` no hair '' @xcite .",
    "the unique family of stationary kerr - newman black holes includes , beside the stationary charged black holes , the stationary kerr black holes for vanishing electromagnetic charges , the static reissner - nordstrm ( rn ) black holes for vanishing angular momentum , and the static schwarzschild black holes , which carry neither electromagnetic charge nor angular momentum .",
    "notably , the stationary em black hole solutions are axially symmetric , while the static em black hole solutions are spherically symmetric @xcite .",
    "the uniqueness theorem ( `` no hair '' theorem ) for black holes in em theory does not generalize to theories with non - abelian fields coupled to gravity .",
    "non - abelian black holes are not completely determined by their global charges , defined at infinity @xcite .",
    "furthermore , non - abelian static black holes need not be spherically symmetric , but might possess axial symmetry @xcite or discrete symmetries @xcite only , i.e.  israel s theorem does not generalize to theories with non - abelian fields coupled to gravity either .    in particular ,",
    "su(2 ) einstein - yang - mills ( eym ) theory possesses besides embedded abelian black holes sequences of genuinely non - abelian black holes @xcite .",
    "these hairy black holes possess non - trivial matter fields outside their regular event horizon .",
    "their global charges alone do not determine the spacetimes uniquely .",
    "instead , they are additionally characterized by two integers , the winding number @xmath0 ( with respect to the azimuthal angle @xmath1 ) of the non - abelian gauge fields and the node number @xmath2 of the gauge field functions @xcite .    beside black hole solutions",
    "eym theory also possesses globally regular solutions @xcite .",
    "these particle - like solutions are obtained from the hairy black hole solutions in the limit of vanishing horizon size",
    ". therefore the particle - like solutions are also characterized by the winding number @xmath0 and the node number @xmath2 of the gauge fields .",
    "recently considerable progress concerning the understanding of the non - abelian black hole solutions has been made in the framework of the newly developed isolated horizon formalism @xcite .    in the isolated horizon formalism",
    "one considers space - times with an interior boundary , which satisfy quasi - local boundary conditions that insure that the horizon remains isolated @xcite .",
    "the boundary conditions imply that quasi - local charges can be defined at the horizon , which remain constant in time . in particular one can define a horizon mass , a horizon electric charge and a horizon magnetic charge @xcite .",
    "amazingly , the horizon mass of hairy black holes is related in a simple way to their adm mass and to the adm mass of the corresponding particle - like solution @xcite .",
    "this observation suggests the interpretation of hairy black holes as bound states of a particle - like solution and a schwarzschild black hole @xcite .",
    "most interestingly , a `` quasi - local uniqueness conjecture '' for black holes has been proposed , stating that static black holes are uniquely determined by their horizon area and their horizon electric and magnetic charges @xcite .    here",
    "we address these issues , raised from the perspective of the isolated horizon framework , for the static su(2 ) eym solutions .",
    "we focus on static axially symmetric black hole solutions , since static spherically symmetric black hole solutions have been considered before @xcite .",
    "we verify the mass formula for these static axially symmetric black holes , and consider the bound state interpretation .",
    "our main concern is , however , the `` quasi - local uniqueness conjecture '' , since , as a first check for this conjecture , corichi , nucamendi and sudarsky @xcite have proposed to study colored black holes which are static but not spherically symmetric .",
    "we consider the su(2 ) eym action @xmath3 with @xmath4 $ ] , yang - mills coupling constant @xmath5 , and newton s constant @xmath6 .",
    "the static axially symmetric solutions are obtained in isotropic coordinates with metric @xcite @xmath7 and @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are only functions of @xmath11 and @xmath12 . for the gauge field a purely magnetic ansatz ( @xmath13 )",

    "while the azimuthal angle @xmath20 covers the full trigonometric circle once , we refer to the integer @xmath0 as the winding number of the solutions . for @xmath21 and @xmath22 , @xmath23 , the spherically symmetric ansatz of ref .",
    "@xcite is recovered .    to fix the residual gauge degree of freedom @xcite we choose the gauge condition",
    "@xmath24    we consider static axially symmetric solutions which are asymptotically flat , have a finite mass , and are regular at the origin or possess a regular event horizon .",
    "the boundary conditions at infinity and along the axes are the same for the regular and black hole solutions . at infinity ( @xmath25 )",
    "the boundary conditions are @xcite @xmath26 implying that the solutions are magnetically neutral .    along the @xmath27-axis and the @xmath28-axis @xmath22 ; for all other functions the derivatives with respect to @xmath12 vanish on these axes @xcite .    for the regular solutions the boundary conditions at the origin ( @xmath29 ) are",
    "@xmath30    the regular horizon of the static black hole solutions resides at @xmath31 , where @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "the equations of motion impose the boundary conditions at the horizon @xmath33 for black hole solutions , the gauge condition ( [ gc ] ) still allows for non - trivial gauge transformations .",
    "the gauge is fixed by the condition @xcite @xmath34",
    "let us now discuss the properties of the non - abelian black holes . since they are static and carry no electromagnetic charge ,",
    "their only global charge is the mass .        introducing the dimensionless area parameter @xmath41 of a black hole with horizon area @xmath42 ,",
    "@xmath43 we present the mass of the static black hole solutions , @xmath44 , with winding number @xmath0 and node number @xmath2 as a function of the area parameter in fig .  1 , for the spherically symmetric solutions with @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and the axially symmetric solutions with @xmath47 . with increasing horizon size",
    ", the mass of the hairy black hole solutions approaches the mass of the schwarzschild solutions .",
    "the isolated horizon framework @xcite leads to an intriguing relation between the adm mass @xmath44 of a black hole with area parameter @xmath41 , and the adm mass @xmath54 of the corresponding regular solution @xcite , @xmath55 where the horizon mass @xmath56 is defined by @xmath57 this mass formula ( [ ihmu ] ) has been shown previously to hold for the numerically obtained static spherically symmetric su(2 ) solutions @xcite . here",
    "we show , that it also holds for the static axially symmetric solutions .",
    "we demonstrate this relation in fig .  1 , where the sum of the mass of the regular solution and the horizon mass , @xmath58 , is superimposed on the black holes mass , @xmath44 , for the eym solutions with @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 .",
    "the curves agree within the numerical accuracy",
    ".    for distorted horizons , relation ( [ ihmu ] ) has been verified previously in einstein - yang - mills - higgs ( eymh ) theory @xcite , where it generalizes to include bifurcating branches of non - abelian black hole solutions @xcite .",
    "the isolated horizon formalism also leads to a heuristic physical model of hairy black holes , which suggests to interpret a hairy black hole as a bound state of a regular solution and a schwarzschild black hole @xcite . rewriting relation ( [ ihmu ] ) for the mass @xmath44 of the black hole solution with horizon radius @xmath41 by introducing the mass @xmath59 of the schwarzschild black hole with horizon radius @xmath41 , @xmath60 yields for the binding energy @xmath61 of the system , @xmath62    in fig .",
    "2 we show the binding energy @xmath61 for the spherically symmetric solutions with @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and the axially symmetric solutions with @xmath47 . when the binding energy tends to the negative value of the mass of the regular solution for @xmath63 , this confirms the mass relation for the regular solution @xcite , @xmath64    let us now turn to the `` quasi - local uniqueness conjecture '' for black holes , put forward in ref .",
    "@xcite , which states that static black holes are uniquely determined by their horizon area and their horizon electric and magnetic charges . here",
    "the non - abelian electric and magnetic charge of the horizon @xcite appear as the crucial quantities .",
    "the non - abelian magnetic charge of the horizon is defined via the surface integral over the horizon @xcite @xmath65 and the non - abelian horizon electric charge is defined analogously with the dual field strength tensor @xcite .",
    "for the spherically symmetric solutions , the `` quasi - local uniqueness conjecture '' holds @xcite . for a given value of the area parameter ,",
    "the horizon magnetic charge increases with increasing node number @xmath2 , reaching the constant value of the rn solution with unit charge ( for horizon @xmath66 ) in the limit @xmath67 .",
    "however , the conjecture should also hold when the axially symmetric black hole solutions with winding number @xmath68 are taken into account @xcite . to address this crucial point",
    ", we have reanalyzed the set of hairy black hole solutions with winding number @xmath69 and node number @xmath70 .",
    "we exhibit the horizon magnetic charge @xmath71 of these non - abelian black hole solutions as a function of the area parameter @xmath41 in fig .  3 , together with the horizon magnetic charge of the spherically symmetric solutions with one and two nodes .",
    "whereas the curves of the spherically symmetric solutions do not intersect , the curve of the axially symmetric @xmath47 solution intersects the curves of both spherically symmetric solutions .",
    "in fact , it intersects the curves of all the spherically symmetric solutions , since they increase monotonically with @xmath2 , but have @xmath72 .",
    "furthermore it also intersects the rn curve , @xmath73 ( for @xmath66 ) .",
    "thus when black hole solutions with a distorted horizon are included , the `` quasi - local uniqueness conjecture '' holds no longer .",
    "therefore the need for a modified uniqueness conjecture persists .",
    "the set of two integers @xmath74 , used to characterize the hairy black holes with a given mass or horizon area , apparently can not be replaced by the single quantity of the horizon magnetic charge .",
    "another horizon property would have to be included in the uniqueness conjecture .",
    "the deformation of the horizon could serve to distinguish black holes solutions with equal horizon area and horizon magnetic charge @xcite .",
