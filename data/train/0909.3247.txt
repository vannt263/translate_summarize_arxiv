    "several suggestions are already present about the possibility of interesting isospin effects on the transition to a mixed hadron - quark phase at high baryon density @xcite .",
    "this seems to be a very appealing physics program for the new facilities , fair at gsi - darmstadt @xcite and nica at jinr - dubna @xcite , where heavy ion beams ( even unstable , with large isospin asymmetry ) will be available with good intensities in the 1 - 30 agev energy region .",
    "the weak point of those predictions is the lack of a reliable equation of state that can describe with the same confidence the two phases , hadronic and deconfined . on the other hand this also represents a strong theory motivation to work on more refined effective theories for a strong interacting matter .",
    "the main qualitative argument in favor of noticeable isospin effects on the hadron - quark transition at high density can be derived from the fig.[isoparton ] , where we compare typical equations of state ( eos ) for hadron ( nucleon ) and quark matter , at zero temperature , for symmetric ( @xmath2 ) and neutron matter ( @xmath3 ) , where @xmath4 are the neutron / proton densities and @xmath5 the total baryon density .    for the hadron part",
    "we use a relativistic mean field ( rmf ) eos ( @xcite ) with non - linear terms and effective @xmath6 coupling for the isovector part , largely used to study isospin effects in relativistic heavy ion collisions @xcite . in order to keep a smooth flow of the physics points in the discussion , details about the adopted effective",
    "nucleon - meson lagrangians are presented in the appendix a.     of symmetric / neutron matter : hadron ( @xmath7 ) , solid lines , vs. quark ( mit - bag ) , dashed lines .",
    "@xmath8 represent the isospin asymmetry parameters respectively of the hadron , quark matter : @xmath9 , symmetric matter ; @xmath10 , neutron matter . ]",
    "the energy density and the pressure for the quark phase are given by the mit bag model @xcite ( two - flavor case ) and read , respectively :    @xmath11    @xmath12    where b denotes the bag constant ( the bag pressure ) , taken as a rather standard value from the hadron spectra ( @xmath13 , no density dependence ) , @xmath14 are the quark masses ( @xmath15 choice ) , and @xmath16 , @xmath17 represent the fermi distribution functions for quarks and anti - quarks .",
    "the quark number density is given by    @xmath18    the transition to the more repulsive quark matter will appear around the crossing points of the two eos .",
    "we see that such crossing for symmetric matter ( @xmath19 ) is located at rather high density , @xmath20 , while for pure neutron matter ( @xmath21 ) it is moving down to about three times @xmath22 .",
    "of course the fig.1 represents just a simple energetic argument to support the hadron - quark transition to occur at lower baryon densities for more isospin asymmetric matter . in the rest of the paper we will rigourously consider the case of a first order phase transition in the gibbs frame for a system with two conserved charges ( baryon and isospin ) , in order to derive more detailed results .",
    "since the first order phase transition presents a jump in the energy , we can expect the mixed phase to start at densities even before the crossing points of the fig.1 .",
    "the lower boundary then can be predicted at relatively low baryon densities for asymmetric matter , likely reached in relativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "moreover this point is certainly of interest for the structure of the crust and the inner core of neutron stars , e.g. see refs . @xcite and the review @xcite .",
    "the ref.@xcite is particularly interesting since similar results are obtained with rather different hadronic approaches , the rmf and the non - relativistic brueckner - hartree - fock ( bhf ) theory .",
    "we finally note that the above conclusions are rather independent on the isoscalar part of the used hadron eos at high density , that is chosen to be rather soft in agreement with collective flow and kaon production data @xcite .    in the used bag model",
    "no gluon interactions , the @xmath23-strong coupling parameter , are included .",
    "we remark that this in fact would enhance the above effect , since it represents an attractive correction for a fixed b - constant , see @xcite .",
    "a reduction of the bag - constant with increasing baryon density , as suggested by various models , see ref.@xcite , will also go in the direction of an `` earlier '' ( lower density ) transition , as already seen in ref.@xcite .",
    "at variance , the presence of explicit isovector contributions in the quark phase could play an important role , as shown in the following also for other isospin properties inside the mixed phase .",
    "we can study in detail the isospin dependence of the transition densities @xcite .",
    "the structure of the mixed phase is obtained by imposing the gibbs conditions @xcite for chemical potentials and pressure and by requiring the conservation of the total baryon and isospin densities :    @xmath24    where @xmath25 is the fraction of quark matter in the mixed phase and t is the temperature .",
    "the consistent definitions for the densities and chemical potentials in the two phases are given by :    @xmath26    for the hadron phase and    @xmath27    for the quark phase .",
    "the related asymmetry parameters are : @xmath28 nucleon and quark chemical potentials , as well as the pressures in the two phases , are directly derived from the respective eos .    in this way we get the @xmath29 surface which gives the phase coexistence region in the @xmath30 space . for a fixed value of the total asymmetry @xmath31 we will study the boundaries of the mixed phase region in the @xmath32 plane . since in general the charge chemical potential",
    "is related to the symmetry term of the eos , @xcite , @xmath33 we expect critical and transition densities rather sensitive to the isovector channel in the two phases .    in the hadron sector",
    "we will use the non - linear relativistic mean field models , @xcite , with different structure of the isovector part , already tested to describe the isospin dependence of collective flows and meson production for heavy ion collisions at intermediate energies , @xcite .",
    "we will refer to these different iso - lagrangians as : i ) @xmath34 , where no isovector meson is included and the symmetry term is only given by the kinetic fermi contribution , ii ) @xmath35 when the interaction contribution of an isovector - vector meson is considered and finally iii ) @xmath36 where also the contribution of an isovector - scalar meson is accounted for .",
    "see details in appendix a and refs.@xcite .",
    "we will look at the effect on the hadron - quark transition of the different stiffness of the symmetry term at high baryon densities in the different parametrizations .",
    "as clearly shown in appendix a , where a rather transparent form for the density dependence of the symmetry energy in rmf approaches is discussed , the potential part of the symmetry term will be proportional to the baryon density in the @xmath35 choice and even stiffer in the @xmath36 case .",
    "as already mentioned , in the quark phase we use the mit - bag model , where the symmetry term is only given by the fermi contribution .",
    "the bag parameter b is fixed for each baryon density to a constant , rather standard , value @xmath37 , corresponding to a bag pressure of @xmath38 .    ) and upper ( @xmath39 ) boundaries of the mixed phase , at zero temperature , vs. the asymmetry parameter .",

    "a relatively simple calculation can be performed at zero temperature .",
    "the isospin effect ( asymmetry dependence ) on the lower @xmath45 and upper @xmath46 transition densities of the mixed phase are shown in fig.[boundaries ] for various choices of the hadron eos . the effect of a larger repulsion of the symmetry energy in the hadron sector , from @xmath34 to @xmath35 and to @xmath36",

    "the grey region corresponds to the conditions reached in heavy ion collisions simulations at few agev beam energies , see section 3 .",
    "]    typical results for isospin effects on the whole binodal `` surface '' are presented in fig.[tcrit ] for symmetric and asymmetric matter . for the hadron part",
    "we have started from a @xmath35 effective lagrangian very close to other widely used relativistic effective models , e.g. see the @xmath48 of ref.@xcite and the @xmath49 interaction of p.ring and collaborators @xcite , which has also given good nuclear structure results , even for exotic nuclei .    in the symmetric matter case",
    "the mixed phase is evaluated from the simpler maxwell conditions .",
    "the results are shown in fig.[maxwell ] for the same hadron and quark @xmath40 s as in fig.[tcrit ] at temperatures t=0 , 50 and 80 mev . the equal chemical potential densities ( intersection of the dotted line in the lower panel ) must correspond to the equal pressure densities of the upper panels .",
    "we nicely see : i ) at t=0 mev the mixed phase is centered around @xmath50 , exactly the @xmath51 crossing point of fig.[isoparton ] , confirming our energetic argument about the transition location ; ii ) the size of the mixed phase is shrinking with temperature , it is very narrow at t=50 mev and finally at t=80 mev we can not have anymore a first order transition .",
    "in fact the critical end point is found at @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 , see also fig.[tcrit ] .",
    "the result is dependent on the choice of the bag constant , with increasing of the critical temperature with the bag value due to the reduction of the pressure in the quark phase , while the chemical potentials are not affected .",
    "this point will not be further discussed since here the main focus is on the isospin dependence of the mixed phase at lower temperatures , that can be probed in heavy ion collisions at intermediate energies .",
    "as expected , the lower boundary of the mixed phase is mostly affected by isospin effects . in spite of the relatively small total asymmetry , @xmath47",
    ", we clearly observe in fig.[tcrit ] a shift to the left of the first transition boundary , in particular at low temperature , and an indication of a relatively `` earlier '' critical end point , around ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "actually we see from fig.[tcrit ] that for asymmetric matter , we are not able to explicitly reach the @xmath57 of the binodal surface . since this feature appears also in the following figures we must add a general comment . from the present results we can not exclude a @xmath57 at higher temperature and smaller baryon density .",
    "however we have also to mention some numerical problems .",
    "the solution of the gibbs conditions , the highly non - linear system of eqs.([gibbs ] ) , is found through an iterative multi - parameter minimization procedure ( the newton - raphson method ) .",
    "when we are close to the critical end point , for each @xmath25-concentration the baryon and isospin densities of the hadron and quark phases become very similar and we start to have problems in finding a definite minimum .",
    "we are working on improving the numerical accuracy but in any case the trends towards the @xmath57 are always quite clearly observed , as a severe reduction of the mixed phase .    in the following",
    "we will concentrate on properties of the mixed phase mostly located at high density and relatively low temperature , well described in the calculation and within the reach of heavy ion collisions in the few agev range , see section 3 .",
    "for @xmath47 asymmetric matter , in the figs.[nlrmix ] , [ nlrdmix ] we show also the ( @xmath0 ) curves inside the mixed phase corresponding to a @xmath58 and @xmath59 presence of the quark component ( @xmath60 ) , evaluated respectively with the two choices , @xmath35 and @xmath36 , of the symmetry interaction in the hadron sector .",
    "we note , as also expected from fig.[boundaries ] , that in the more repulsive @xmath36 case the lower boundary is much shifted to the left .",
    "however this effect is not so evident for the curve corresponding to a @xmath58 quark concentration , and almost absent for the @xmath59 case .",
    "the conclusion seems to be that for a stiffer symmetry term in a heavy - ion collision at intermediate energies during the compression stage we can have more chance to probe the mixed phase , although in a region with small weight of the quark component .",

    "[ nlrmixhq ] , [ nlrdmixhq ] we present the results for the same weights @xmath63 of the quark phase of the previous figures .",

    "an interesting possibility is coming from the study of the asymmetry @xmath64 in the quark phase .",
    "in fact since the symmetry energy is rather different in the two phases we can expect an isospin distillation ( or fractionation ) , very similar to the one observed in the liquid - gas transition in dilute nuclear matter @xcite , this time with the larger isospin content in the higher density quark phase .    in fig.[alphaq",
    "] we show the asymmetry @xmath64 in the quark phase as a function of the quark concentration @xmath25 for the case with global asymmetry @xmath47 ( zero temperature ) .",
    "the calculation is performed with the two choices of the symmetry term in the hadron sector .",
    "we see an impressive increase of the quark asymmetry when we approach the lower boundary of the mixed phase , even to values larger than one , likely just for numerical accuracy @xcite .",
    "of course the quark asymmetry recovers the global value 0.2 at the upper boundary @xmath65 .",
    "a simple algebraic calculation allows to evaluate the corresponding asymmetries of the hadron phase .",
    "in fact from the charge conservation we have that for any @xmath25-mixture the global asymmetry @xmath66 is given by :    @xmath67    for any @xmath25 , from the calculated @xmath64 of fig.[alphaq ] and the @xmath62 of figs.[nlrmixhq ] , [ nlrdmixhq ] , we can get the correspondent asymmetry of the hadron phase @xmath68 . for a @xmath58 quark concentration we have an @xmath69 ratio around 5 for @xmath35 and around 20 for @xmath36 , more repulsive in the isovector channel .",
    "it is also interesting to compare the isospin content @xmath70 of the high density region expected from transport simulations without the hadron - quark transition and the effective @xmath70 of the quark phase in a @xmath58 concentration . in the case of @xmath71 ( initial @xmath72 )",
    "central collisions at @xmath73 in pure hadronic simulations we get in the high density phase a reduced @xmath74 ( respectively with @xmath75 interactions ) due to the fast neutron emission @xcite .",
    "the corresponding isospin content of the quark phases is much larger , @xmath76 for @xmath35 and @xmath77 for @xmath36 .",
    "this is the @xmath78 effect discussed in the section 3 .",
    "we could expect a signal of such large asymmetries , coupled to a larger baryon density in the quark phase , in the subsequent hadronization .",
    "we finally remark that at higher temperature and smaller baryon chemical potential ( ultrarelativistic collisions ) the isospin effects discussed here are expected to vanish @xcite , even if other physics can enter the game and charge asymmetry effects are predicted also at @xmath79 and @xmath80 @xcite .",
    "all the above results will be very sensitive to the explicit inclusion of isovector interactions in effective non - perturbative qcd models in regions at high baryon chemical potentials .",
    "unfortunately few attempts have been worked out for two main reasons : i ) the difficulties of lattice - qcd calculations at high baryon densities ; ii ) the main interest on the qgp phase transition at high temperature and small baryon chemical potentials , as probed in the expanding fireball of ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "a first approach can be supplied by a two - flavor nambu - jona lasinio ( @xmath81 ) model @xcite , which in fact describes the chiral restoration but not the deconfinement dynamics .",
    "the isospin asymmetry can be included in a flavor - mixing picture @xcite , corresponding to different couplings to the ( u , d ) quark - antiquark condensates . as a consequence we can have now a dependence of the constituent mass of a given flavor to both quark condensates .",
    "we devote the appendix b to a detailed study of this isospin effects in the @xmath81 chiral dynamics .    due to the scalar nature of the interacting part of the corresponding lagrangians only the quark effective mass dynamics will be affected . in the `` realistic '' small mixing case , see also @xcite",
    ", we get a definite @xmath82 splitting at high baryon density ( before the chiral restoration ) . all that can indicate a more fundamental confirmation of the @xmath83 splitting in the hadron phase , as suggested by the effective @xmath84 model with the isovector scalar @xmath85 coupling , see @xcite",
    ". however such isospin mixing effect results in a very small variation of the symmetry energy in the quark phase , related only to the fermi kinetic contribution .",
    "moreover we remind that confinement is still missing in this @xmath81 mean field approach . in any case",
    "there are extensive suggestions about a favored chiral symmetry restoration in systems with large neutron excess @xcite .",
    "more generally starting from the qcd lagrangian one can arrive to an effective color current - current interaction where an expansion in various components can provide isovector contributions , @xcite .    in this respect",
    "we remark another interesting `` indirect '' isospin effect , i.e. not directly related to isovector terms in the effective lagrangian , related to the presence of quark condensates due to the attractive gluon interaction .",
    "we note that just a color - pairing effect in the two - flavor system ( the @xmath86 phase @xcite ) would imply a stiffer symmetry energy in the quark eos since we have a larger attraction when the densities of up and down quarks are equal . a first study of the high density hadron - quark transition including such gluon correlation in the bag model has been presented very recently in @xcite .",
    "now the symmetry energy difference between hadron and quark phases is partially reduced , at least at low temperatures , and consequently also the isospin effects discussed in detail in this work will be less robust , although still present .",
    "an interesting point is that in any case the quark phase is more bound due to the attractive gluon contribution .",
    "hence the transition to the mixed phase will still appear at relatively low baryon densities , now for an `` isoscalar '' mechanism , within the reach of `` low energy '' heavy ion collisions , i.e. in the range of few agev .",
    "as an intuitive picture we can refer again to the fig.1 .",
    "essentially the difference between the @xmath87 and @xmath88 curves is increasing but meanwhile both are decreasing .",
    "with increasing temperature the color pairing effect will be in general reduced , as confirmed in @xcite in an extended @xmath81 calculation , and so isospin effects , as discussed before , will be more relevant .",
    "all that , as well as the location of the critical - end - point , is naturally related to the used value of the superconducting gap , opening new stimulating perspectives . in this sense",
    "new experiments on mixed phase properties observed with isospin asymmetric heavy ion collisions , as suggested in the final section , will be extremely important .",
    "based on the qualitative argument of the introduction and on more detailed calculations in a first order phase transition scheme , we have predicted rather `` robust '' isospin effects on the hadron - quark transition at high baryon densities , not depending on details of the eos parametrizations in the hadron and quark phases .",
    "our results seem to indicate a specific region where the onset of the mixed phase should be mainly located : @xmath89 , @xmath90 , for realistic asymmetries @xmath91",
    ". a key question is if such a region of the phase space can be explored by means of heavy - ion - collisions . in refs.@xcite",
    "it is shown that even collisions of stable nuclei at intermediate energies ( @xmath92 ) make available the pertinent ( @xmath93 ) region where the phase transition is expected to occur .    in this respect",
    "we can refer to the reaction @xmath94 ( average isospin asymmetry @xmath95 ) at @xmath96 that has been investigated in ref.@xcite , using a consistent relativistic mean field approach with the same interactions , for a semicentral impact parameter @xmath97 , chosen just to increase the neutron excess in the interacting region .",
    "the evolution of momentum distribution and baryon / isospin densities in a space cell located in the c.m . of the system has been also studied .",
    "after about @xmath98 a local equilibration is achieved still in the compressed phase , before the fast expansion .",
    "we have a unique fermi distribution and from a simple fit the `` local '' temperature can be evaluated .",
    "a rather exotic nuclear matter is formed in a transient time of the order of @xmath99 , with baryon density around @xmath100 , temperature @xmath101 , and isospin asymmetry between @xmath102 and @xmath103 , likely inside the estimated mixed phase region .",
    "we note that high intensity @xmath104 beams in this energy range will be available in the first stage of the fair facility @xcite and also at jinr - dubna in the nuclotron first step of the nica project @xcite .    which are the observable effects to look at if we enter and/or cross the mixed phase ?",
    "as already stressed , a first expectation will be the isospin distillation effect , a kind of _ neutron trapping _ in the quark phase , supported by statistical fluctuations @xcite as well as by a symmetry energy difference in the two phases , as discussed in section 2.1 .",
    "in fact while in the pure hadron matter ( neutron - rich ) at high density we have a large neutron potential repulsion ( in both @xmath35 , @xmath36 cases ) , in the quark phase the @xmath105-quarks see a much smaller symmetry repulsion only due to the kinetic contribution from the fermi gas . as a consequence",
    "while in a pure hadronic phase neutrons are quickly emitted or `` transformed '' in protons by inelastic collisions @xcite , when the mixed phase starts forming , neutrons are kept in the interacting system , in the quark phase which is also at larger baryon density , up to the subsequent hadronization in the expansion stage @xcite .",
    "observables related to such neutron `` trapping '' could be an inversion in the trend of the formation of neutron rich clusters , an enhancement of the production of isospin - rich nucleon resonances and subsequent decays , i.e. an increase of @xmath106 , @xmath107 yield ratios for reaction products coming from high density regions , that could be selected looking at large transverse momenta , corresponding to a large radial flow .",
    "if such kinetic selection of particles from the mixed phase can really be successful also other potential signatures would become available .",
    "one is related to the general softening of the matter , due to the contribution of more degrees of freedom , that should show up in the damping of collective flows @xcite .",
    "the azimuthal distributions ( elliptic flows ) will be particularly affected since particles mostly retain their high transverse momenta escaping along directions orthogonal to the reaction plane without suffering much rescattering processes .",
    "thus a further signature could be the observation , for the selected particles , of the onset of a quark - number scaling of the elliptic flow : a property of hadronization by quark coalescence that has been predicted and observed at rhic energies , i.e. for the transition at @xmath79 @xcite .",
    "we note that all the above results , on the binodal boundaries of the mixed phase and on the isospin distillation are sensitive to the symmetry term in the hadron sector , although the main isospin effects are present for all the parametrizations of the isovector interaction . at variance , for the quark sector the lack of explicit isovector terms could strongly affect the location of the phase transition in asymmetric matter and the related expected observables .    in conclusion",
    "the aim of this work is twofold :    * to stimulate new experiments on isospin effects in heavy ion collisions at intermediate energies ( in a few @xmath108 range ) with attention to the isospin content of produced particles and to elliptic flow properties , in particular for high-@xmath109 selections . * to stimulate more refined models of effective lagrangians for non - perturbative qcd , where isovector channels are consistently accounted for and/or gluon correlations , leading to diquark condensates , can induce symmetry energy effects .",

    "from the above discussion it appears ( extremely ) important to include the isospin degree of freedom in any effective qcd dynamics .",

    "the value of @xmath170 has a consequence on the structure of the phase diagram in the region of low temperatures and high chemical potential .",

    "in fact this represents just a very first step towards a more complete treatment of isovector contributions in effective quark models , of large interest for the discussion of the phase transition at high densities .                                                    in principle",

    "indeed for low @xmath25-values , @xmath184 , very small quark concentrations , we can get @xmath64 values slightly larger than 1 .",
    "however we are cautious about these results since we can expect also some numerical problems .",
    "in fact for very small @xmath25 values the weight of the @xmath64 contribution in the minimization procedure is expected not too relevant , as we can clearly see from the eq.([alphamix ] ) . in any case",
