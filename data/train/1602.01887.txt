    "visual tracking is one of the fundamental and challenging problems in computer vision and artificial intelligence . though much progress has been achieved in recent years  @xcite , there are still unsolved issues due to its complexity on various factors , such as illumination and angle changes , clutter background , shape deformation and occlusion",
    ". extensive studies on visual tracking employ a tracking - by - detection framework and achieve promising results by extending existing machine learning methods ( usually discriminative ) with online learning manner  @xcite .",
    "to adaptively model various appearance changes , they deal with a large amount of samples at both detection and updating stages .",
    "however , all of them face the same dilemma : while more samples grant better accuracy and adaptiveness , they also come with higher computational cost and risk of drifting .",
    "in addition to discriminative methods , @xcite utilize generative models with a fixed learning - rate to account for target appearance changes .",
    "the learning - rate is essentially a trade - off between adaptiveness and stability .",
    "however , even with very small rate , former samples influence on their models still drops exponentially through frames , and drift error may still accumulate . in order to alleviate drift error , @xcite",
    "are designed to exploit hidden structured information around the target region .",
    "other methods  @xcite try to avoid drifting by making the current model a combination of the labeled samples in the first frame and the learned samples from the tracking process .",
    "however , limited number of samples ( _ e.g. _ , the first frame ) can be regarded as  very confident \" , which in turn restrict their robustness in long - term challenging tasks . recently ,",
    "several methods  @xcite employ discrete fourier transform ( dft ) to perform extremely fast detection and achieve high accuracy with the least computational cost .",
    "however , same as other generative methods , the memory length of their models is limited by a fixed forgetting rate , and therefore they still suffer from accumulated drift error in long - term tasks .",
    "a very important observation is that , when the tracked target moves smoothly , _",
    "e.g. _ , without severe occlusion or out - of - plane rotations , its appearances across frames share high similarity in the feature space ( _ e.g. _ , edge features ) .",
    "contrarily , when it undergoes drastic movements such as in / out - of - plane rotations or occlusions , its appearances may not be that similar to previous ones .",
    "therefore , if we impose a temporal constraint on clustering these samples , such that only temporally adjacent ones can be grouped together , the big clusters with large intra - cluster correlation can indicate the periods when the target experiences small appearance changes .",
    "we take human memory as an analogy for these clusters , using _ reliable memories _ to represent large clusters that have been consistently perceived for a long time . in this context ,",
    "earlier memories supported by more samples have higher probability to be reliable than more recent ones with less support , especially when drift error accumulates across frames .",
    "thus , a tracker may recover from drift error with preference to choose candidates that share high correlation to earlier memories .",
    "based on these motivations , we propose a novel tracking framework , which efficiently explores self - correlated appearance clusters across frames , and then preserves reliable memories for long - term robust visual tracking .",
    "first , we design a dft - based visual tracker , which is capable of retrieving good memories from a vast number of tracked samples for accurate detection , while still ensures a fast speed for real - time performance .",
    "second , we propose a novel clustering method with temporal constraints to discover distinct and reliable memories from previous frames to help our tracker resist drift error .",
    "this method harvests the inherent correlation of the streaming data , and is guaranteed to converge at a fast speed , which costs less than 30 ms for @xmath0 frames . ] by carefully designing upon integral image . to the best of our knowledge , our temporally constrained clustering method is novel to vision streaming data analysis , and its high converging speed and promising performance show great potential in online streaming problems .",
    "particularly , it is very competent in discovering clusters ( _ i.e. _ , reliable memories ) consisted of uncontaminated sequential samples that are tracked before , and grants our tracker remarkable ability to resist drift error .",
    "experimental results show that our tracker is considerably competent in handling drift error and performs favorably against other state - of - the - art methods on benchmark datasets .",
    "further , it can robustly track challenging long videos with over @xmath1 frames , while most of the others lose track at early frames .",
    "recent works  @xcite achieve the state - of - the - art tracking accuracy with the least computational cost by exploiting the inherent relationship between dft and the circulant structure of dense sampling on the target region . in this section",
    ", we briefly introduce these methods that are highly related to our work .",
