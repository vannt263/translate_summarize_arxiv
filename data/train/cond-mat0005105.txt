    "the kpz equation @xcite , in its apparent simplicity , involves many issues that need clarification .",
    "the continuum equation ( that describes the local growth of an interface profile ) is    @xmath7    the real behavior of this equation is not well understood .",
    "the absence of a complete mean field theory does not help , and the fact that we have do understand the effects of a strong coupling fixed point makes very difficult the development of a perturbative renormalization approach .    a practical approach for numerical studied of the problem is to consider lattice restricted solid on solid ( rsos ) surfaces ( see for example @xcite for a review ) : one considers a discretized height field on a @xmath0 dimensional lattice , and imposes the constrain that the absolute value of the distance among two neighboring surface elements can only take the values zero and one",
    ".    old extensive numerical simulations @xcite do not clarify the situation completely . after a number of interesting field theoretical results @xcite , the introduction of new renormalization group based techniques is a potentially promising direction of development @xcite .",
    "the main theoretical points which still deserve proper explanation are two : it is still not clear whether equation ( [ kpz_equation ] ) has a finite upper critical dimension ( @xmath8 ) or not , and the exact quantification of the related critical exponents .",
    "regarding arguments in favor of @xmath9 we address the reader to @xcite , while arguments supporting @xmath10 can be found in @xcite .",
    "in this light we introduce here a new numerical technique and present some precise numerical simulations that allow us to estimate critical exponents .",
    "thanks to the new , precise technique we succeed to clarify some questions : we show for example that a conjecture of @xcite is not founded , and we give quantitative estimates about the behavior of sub - leading corrections .",
    "the precise results on which this paper is based are due to a new technique we introduce to simulate rsos surfaces , where adjacent elements of the surface can only be at a distance of @xmath5 , @xmath11 or @xmath12 lattice spacings .",
    "the technique is a generalization of the so called _ multi - spin coding _",
    "technique ( well discussed by rieger @xcite in the context of the study of disordered systems ) , where , by using the fact that the @xmath13 spins can be represented by boolean logical variables , one stores @xmath14 copies of the system in one single computer word ( we will assume in the following we are using a @xmath14 bit computer ) .",
    "the main idea is that we can simulate , basically at the cost of one single usual simulation , @xmath14 copies of the system , by rewriting the basic operations ( like summing spins for computing the effective force ) as boolean operations , and by exploiting the fact that when , for example , the computer is calculating a logical bit @xmath15 it is indeed doing that @xmath14 times at once .",
    "the gain of such an approach over an usual single spin simulation is of order @xmath6 : one gains a factor @xmath14 for the number of systems that updates at once , and looses a factor of order @xmath1 in computational complexity ( adding the spin in the boolean form takes some more time @xcite ) .",
    "we generalize here the ising case to the case of a _ field of differences _ , that can have three values , since a given element of the surface can be at the same height of a given neighbor , or one step behind it , or one step ahead of it .",
    "the method is new as applied to such a system , where one does not have to compute the value of an energy , but uses the boolean operations to determine if the element can be moved without violating the geometrical constraint .",
    "let us thinks for simplicity about @xmath16 , where we have a @xmath16 support where a height field ( the surface height ) @xmath17 is defined .",
    "one surface element @xmath18 has @xmath19 first neighbors : in the rsos model the difference @xmath20 , where @xmath21 , can only take the three values @xmath12 , @xmath11 and @xmath22 . we store the @xmath23 values of the @xmath24 ( and , as we will discuss better ,",
    "each @xmath24 needs two bit to be stored .",
    "this is a redundant way to store the information , since a factor two in memory could be easily saved , but it is very convenient from the point of view of computer time : as usual one trades memory for time , and avoids a cumbersome reconstruction by storing more information ) .",
    "if a given element is behind its neighbor the difference is @xmath12 , if it has the same height than the neighbor the difference is @xmath11 , while if it is ahead of the neighbor the difference is @xmath22 . since we have three allowed values we can represent each of these difference with two bits ( that we will call respectively @xmath25 , high bit , and @xmath26 , low bit ) : we can for example code with @xmath27 the situation where the given element is behind its neighbor , with @xmath28 the situation where they have the same height , and with @xmath29 the situation where it is ahead ( the value @xmath30 is forbidden ) .",
    "if the element is ahead of even a single one of the @xmath16 neighbors the move is forbidden ( it would violate the rsos constrain ) .",
    "it is clear this is easily implemented in our coding : one just needs to do a logical @xmath31 of the @xmath16 @xmath25 bits related to the site @xmath32 , and if it is @xmath5 at least one of the neighbors is behind and the move is not allowed .",
    "let us see better why .",
    "we start comparing our element @xmath32 to the first of its @xmath19 neighbors ( let us say the one in the positive direction @xmath22 ) : if @xmath32 is ahead the neighbor the relevant @xmath25 bit ( that we have stored in @xmath33 ) is @xmath5 , and we already know we can not move . if @xmath32 is on the contrary at the same height of the neighbor or behind it we have that , as far as this neighbor is concerned , the element @xmath32 can advance of one unit .",
    "now we look at the second neighbor , where the same reasoning holds : if we look at the logical @xmath31 of the two relevant high bit we will find that we can not move if this quantity is one .",
    "looking at all the @xmath16 neighbor we see that the move is forbidden if the logical @xmath31 of the @xmath16 @xmath25 bit is @xmath5 : clearly this operation , as all the other present in the core of the code , updates with a single computer cycle the @xmath14 copies of the system . after doing that ,",
    "if the element @xmath32 can not be moved there is nothing that has be done : if it gets moved we have to update the @xmath24 related to the site @xmath32 and to the neighbors , to describe the new situation .",
    "the codes simulating systems in a different number of spatial dimensions ( in our case from @xmath34 to @xmath35 ) are simple generalization one of the other ( when adding a dimension one has to add checks on the new neighbors and their update ) .    as usual in these kind of simulations the random noise is implemented with a random choice of the site to be updated .",
    "we also implement a fifty percent probability of really updating a surface element that according to the rsos constrain could be updated .",
    "this is very important , since starting from random independent surfaces is not enough : because of our parallel scheme the sites of our @xmath14 copies have to be updated in the same order , and such an updating algorithm with updating probability one is attractive , and the @xmath14 configurations asymptotically at large times become equal @xcite .",
    "the probability of not accepting an allowing change , that depends on each of the @xmath14 configurations , solve this problem .",
    "we are aware of a parallel algorithm to update surfaces @xcite : it is very different in spirit from our algorithm ( since it parallelizes on different sites of the lattice ) .",
    "we have not compared in detail the performances of the two algorithms , but we believe that on one side the algorithm of @xcite is more general , and not limited to rsos models , but on the other side our algorithms is more regular ( there are no exceptional loops ) , and is probably better performing for the model we study .",
    "we have based this work on numerical simulations of lattices of volume @xmath36 .",
    "the spatial dimensionality @xmath0 is the spatial support , where a @xmath5 dimensional surface take values .",
    "we study the @xmath34 , @xmath37 and @xmath35 cases . at a given time @xmath38 of the dynamical evolution",
    "the position of the surface can be expressed by the values @xmath39 ( that we reconstruct by the differences we store in our code , see the former section ) .",
    "@xmath32 represents , in lexicografic order , a @xmath0-ple labeling the spatial sites .",
    "we consider a dynamics which generates a restricted solid on solid ( rsos ) growth : distances of first neighboring elements of the surface can not be larger than one . at each trial step",
    "we move elements of the surface that are not constrained not to do so because of the rsos restriction with probability @xmath40 : we have to use a probability different from one in order to keep independent the different surfaces we simulate in the same computer word .",
    "we consider a large number of different lattice sizes . in @xmath34",
    "we take @xmath26 going from @xmath41 to @xmath42 , in @xmath37 we consider @xmath26 going from @xmath41 to @xmath43 while in @xmath35 @xmath26 goes from @xmath41 to @xmath44 .",
    "all our data have been averaged over @xmath14 different dynamical runs .    .",
    "number of full lattice sweeps for each run on different lattice sizes and number of dimensions .",
    "[ tab - one ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     our recent are not incompatible with the recent ones of @xcite , but our small error bars allow us to reach precise conclusions .",
    "also the comparison with the exponents found in @xcite is fair : we have stressed the length of our runs , in order to be able to give a clean estimate of the time asymptotic behavior , so that our result is hopefully unbiased .",
    "the numerical technique we have introduced works well , and has allowed us to run very precise numerical simulations with a limited amount of computer time ( a few months of pentium ii processor ) .",
    "we have been able to determine critical exponents of the kpz universality class with high accuracy .",
    "we have falsified the guess that the exponents are simple rational numbers .",
    "it is also unambiguous from our data that the upper critical dimension is larger than @xmath3 ( as opposed to the claims of @xcite ) .",
    "thanks to our precise measurements ( and fitting together the first @xmath2 non trivial moments of @xmath45 ) we have also been able to determine the exponent @xmath46 of the first non - leading scaling corrections .",
    "it is interesting to notice that the estimated value of @xmath46 is always very close to @xmath5 , independent from the dimensionality of the system .",
    "the next interesting step , following the approach of @xcite , would be to try and implement a systematic monte carlo renormalization group : the multi - surface coding technique we have discussed could be a very important ingredient of such a development .",
    "for the numerical simulations described here we have used the _ kalix2 _",
