    "the purpose of this article is to describe a numerically stable quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) algorithm to calculate zero - temperature imaginary time displaced green functions : @xmath7 @xmath8 here @xmath9 denotes the ground state of the considered hamiltonian @xmath10 , @xmath11 creates an electron with quantum numbers @xmath12 , @xmath13 is the heaviside function and @xmath14 is the chemical potential which has to satisfy : @xmath15 in the zero - temperature limit @xmath16 .",
    "the above equation implies that the chemical potential corresponding to the desired particle density , @xmath17 , has to be known prior to the simulation . in a metallic state @xmath17",
    "is in general not known a priori .",
    "however , in an insulating state at zero - temperature @xmath17 is constant and in general known for chemical potentials within the charge gap @xmath18 . in this situation , the here described algorithm proves to be a powerful tool .",
    "the above @xmath19 green functions have already been calculated with qmc methods by deisz et al @xcite . since their algorithm does not incorporate a numerical stabilization scheme , they are restricted to relatively small values of @xmath20 ( i.e. @xmath21 in units of the hopping matrix element for the one - dimensional hubbard model ) .",
    "this articles follows the work of deisz et al . and describes a numerical stabilization scheme which allows one to calculate @xmath19 green functions for arbitrary values of @xmath20 .    to demonstrate the efficiency of the algorithm",
    ", we calculate @xmath22 for the two - dimensional half - filled hubbard model : @xmath23 the quantum numbers @xmath24 and @xmath25 denote lattice site and _ z_-component of spin respectively , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 if @xmath24 and @xmath28 are nearest - neighbors . in this notation",
    "half - band filling corresponds to @xmath29 . as a non - trivial test of the algorithm",
    ", one may fit the tail of @xmath30 ( @xmath31 to the form @xmath32 to obtain the charge gap @xmath18 . at @xmath4 and after extrapolation to the thermodynamic limit , our qmc data yields @xmath33 .",
    "this value stands in good agreement with previously determined values of @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "the article is organized in the following way . in the next section ,",
    "we briefly describe the zero - temperature auxiliary - field qmc algorithm for the hubbard model @xcite .",
    "we then present our solution for the numerical stabilization of the time displaced green functions . in section 3",
    "we describe our calculation of the charge gap for the two - dimensional hubbard model at @xmath4 . in the last section ,",
    "we draw some conclusions and discuss the potential applications of the algorithm .",
    "since the hubbard model conserves particle number , and we are working in the canonical ensemble , one may factorize the chemical potential to obtain : @xmath34 due to the above relation we consider the calculation of the @xmath19 green functions at @xmath29 .    the idea behind",
    "the zero temperature qmc algorithm is to filter out the ground state from a trial wave function @xmath35 which is required to be non - orthogonal to the ground state : @xmath36    the qmc calculation of @xmath37 proceeds in the following way .",
    "the first step is to carry out a trotter decomposition of the imaginary time propagation : @xmath38 here , @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) denotes the kinetic ( potential ) term of the hubbard model and @xmath41 .",
    "having isolated the two - body interaction term , @xmath40 , one may carry out a discrete hubbard stratonovitch ( hs ) transformation @xcite to obtain : @xmath42 where @xmath43 denotes a vector of hs ising fields .",
    "for the hubbard model ( [ hubb ] ) , we take : @xmath44 the constant @xmath45 for the @xmath46-site system will be dropped below .",
    "the imaginary time propagation may now be written as : @xmath47 in the above notation , @xmath48 is given by : @xmath49 the trial wave function is required to be a slater determinant : @xmath50 here @xmath51 denotes the number of particles and @xmath52 is an @xmath53 rectangular matrix where @xmath54 is the number of single particle states .",
    "since @xmath55 describes the propagation of non - interacting electrons in an external hs field , one may integrate out the fermionic degrees of freedom to obtain : @xmath56_{x , y } + o ( ( \\delta \\tau)^2).\\ ] ] in the above equation , @xmath57",
    "@xmath58 @xmath59 @xmath60 here @xmath61 is the unit matrix , @xmath62 . in the same notation one obtains : @xmath63_{x , y } ,   \\ ; \\ ; \\tau > 0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] summarizing , the zero - temperature imaginary - time green function may be calculated from : @xmath64    at half - band filling and due to particle hole symmetry , one may chose a trial wave function such that @xmath65 is positive definite .",
    "@xmath66 may be interpreted as a probability distribution and sampled with monte - carlo methods .",
    "the origin of the numerical instabilities occurring in the calculation of green functions may be understood by considering free electrons on a two - dimensional square lattice .",
    "@xmath67 here , the sum runs over nearest - neighbors . for this hamiltonian one",
    "has : @xmath68 where @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 being the lattice constants .",
    "the chemical potential satisfies equation ( [ chem ] ) and we will assume @xmath72 to be non - degenerate . in a numerical calculation the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the above hamiltonian will be known up to machine precision , @xmath73 . in the case",
    "@xmath74 , @xmath75 .",
    "however , on a finite precision machine the later quantity will take a value of the order of @xmath73 .",
    "when calculating @xmath76 this roundoff error will be blown up exponentially and the result for large values of @xmath20 will be unreliable . in order to circumvent this problem , one may do the calculation at finite temperature and then take the limit of vanishingly small temperatures : @xmath77 even if the eigenvalues are known only up to machine precision , the right hand side of the above equation for large but finite values of @xmath78 is a numerically stable operation .",
    "although very simple , this example reflects the underlying numerical instabilities occurring in the calculation of the green functions .",
    "we now consider the calculation of @xmath79 required to compute @xmath80 ( see equation ( [ g > ] ) ) and @xmath81 ( see equation ( [ g < ] ) ) respectively .",
    "the equal - time green functions , @xmath82 , may be calculated to machine precision @xcite .",
    "the matrices @xmath83 contain scales which grow and decrease exponentially with @xmath20 . as in the above example",
    ", a straightforward multiplication of both matrices will lead to numerical instabilities for large values of @xmath20 . here",
    ", the problem is much more severe since the presence of the hs field mixes different scales . in order to circumvent this problem",
    ", we propose the following stabilization scheme .",
    "since the trial wave function is a slater determinant , we can find a single particle hamiltonian , @xmath84 , which has @xmath85 as a non - degenerate ground state . the equal time green functions",
    "may then be written as : @xmath86 the last equality follows after integration of the fermionic degrees of freedom .",
    "inspiring ourselves from the work of hirsch @xcite we calculate the time displaced green functions in equation ( [ gst ] ) with : @xmath87 for very large but finite values of @xmath78 , we can calculate the left hand side of the above equation by using matrix stabilization techniques developed for finite temperature qmc algorithms .",
    "the basic idea behind those numerical stabilization techniques is to keep the different scales occurring in the matrices @xmath88 separate ( for a review see reference @xcite ) .",
    "this is achieved by decomposing the matrices @xmath88 into a @xmath89 form where @xmath90 is an orthogonal matrix , @xmath91 a diagonal matrix containing the exponentially large and exponentially small scales , and @xmath92 a triangular matrix .",
    "the calculation of the left hand side of the above equation is done in the following way : @xmath93 @xmath94 @xmath95 in the above equation , the matrix @xmath96 contains only exponentially large scales since the matrices @xmath97 and @xmath98 act as a cutoff to the exponentially small scales in the matrices @xmath99 and @xmath100 . since the other matrices are all well conditioned , the final matrix multiplication is well defined .",
    "a convenient choice of @xmath101 is obtained in a basis where the trial wave function may be written as : @xmath102 in this basis , we define @xmath101 through @xmath103 ( here , the energy unit is set by the hopping matrix element @xmath104 . ) for this choice of @xmath101 values of @xmath105 were well sufficient to satisfy equation ( [ gs ] ) within required numerical precision @xcite .",
    "the above numerical stabilization scheme was indeed successful in all examined cases .",
    "we carried out our simulations on @xmath2 to @xmath3 lattices for the two - dimensional half - filled ( @xmath29 ) repulsive hubbard model ( [ hubb ] ) at @xmath4 .",
    "periodic boundary conditions were assumed .",
    "a spin singlet ground state of the kinetic energy in the hubbard hamiltonian was used as a trial wave function .",
    "we test the quality of this trial wave function on a @xmath106 lattice .",
    "figure 1 plots @xmath107 as a function of the projection parameter @xmath108 for @xmath109 ( solid circles in figure 1a ) and @xmath110 ( solid circles in figure 1b ) .",
    "here @xmath111 , @xmath112 is the spin operator on site @xmath113 and @xmath46 denotes the number of sites . already for values of @xmath114 , both considered observables have converged within our estimated statistical uncertainty . for comparison ,",
    "we have plotted @xmath115 for the same observables ( triangles in figure 1 ) .",
    "values of @xmath116 at least twice as large are required to obtain approximate ground state results .",
    "another source of systematic errors comes from the discretization of the imaginary time propagation . in table",
    "[ table1 ] the @xmath117 dependence of the energy and @xmath118 is given .",
    "the data are obtained form the zero - temperature qmc algorithm on a @xmath106 lattice and at @xmath119 .",
    "the values at @xmath120 are obtained from a least square fit of the finite @xmath117 results to the form @xmath121 .",
    "we carried out our simulations at @xmath122 .",
    "as may be seen from table [ table1 ] , this value of @xmath123 produces a systematic error contained in the quoted errorbars for the energy and a systematic error of less than @xmath124 for @xmath125 .    to obtain an estimate of the charge gap",
    ", we consider @xmath126 here , @xmath12 stands for spin and site indices . inserting a complete set of eigenstates of the hamiltonian @xmath10 in the @xmath127 particle hilbert space yields : @xmath128 where @xmath129 and @xmath130 . at large values of @xmath131 , @xmath132 where @xmath133 corresponds to the charge gap .",
    "our results are plotted in figure 2 . for those simulations",
    "we have chosen @xmath134 .",
    "since values of @xmath20 up to @xmath135 were considered , the effective projection parameter is given by : @xmath136 .",
    "as may be seen from figure 1 , this value of the projection parameter is more than sufficient to filter out the ground state from the trial wave function .",
    "the solid lines in figure 2 correspond to least square fits of the tail of @xmath137 to the form @xmath138 @xcite .",
    "the estimated value of the gap as a function of system size is plotted in figure 3 .",
    "a least square fit of the data to the form @xmath139 , where @xmath140 denotes the linear length of the lattice , yields @xmath141 in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "this value stands in good agreement with the value of the charge gap obtained by furukawa and imada @xcite : @xmath142 ( solid circle in figure 3 . )",
    "as may be seen from the comparison of errorbars , the accuracy of the estimation has been much improved in the present study .",
    "we have presented an efficient , numerically stable , qmc algorithm to calculate @xmath19 imaginary time green functions for hubbard type models . as a non - trivial test application of this algorithm ,",
    "we have obtained an accurate estimate of the charge gap for the two - dimensional half - filled repulsive hubbard model at @xmath4 : @xmath141 .",
    "the algorithm is formulated in the canonical ensemble .",
    "hence , the relation @xmath17 has to be known prior to the simulation .",
    "this renders the algorithm hard to use in a metallic state .",
    "however , in an insulating state at zero temperature @xmath17 is constant , and generally known , for chemical potentials within the charge gap .",
    "in this situation the here presented algorithm proves to be a powerful tool .",
    "we illustrate this by considering the two - dimensional hubbard model . due to equation ( [ factor ] )",
    ", it suffices to know the green functions at @xmath29 ( half - filling ) to be able to determine them trivially for any other chemical potential within the charge gap . at @xmath29 ,",
    "we are not confronted with a sign problem due to particle - hole symmetry and the statistical fluctuations do not blow - up exponentially with growing lattice sizes and projection parameters @xmath108 .",
    "it is however clear from equation ( [ factor ] ) that statistical fluctuations will increase ( decrease ) exponentially with growing positive values of @xmath20 for @xmath143 ( @xmath144 ) . in comparison , finite temperature algorithms in the grand - canonical ensemble ,",
    "are faced with a sign problem away from @xmath145 .",
    "hence , statistical fluctuations grow exponentially with growing lattice size and inverse temperature . away from @xmath29 , it is thus extremely hard to extrapolate any zero temperature result from the finite temperature grand - canonical algorithms for large lattice sizes .",
