    "the authors reconstructed a pair potential from measured correlation functions of a large ensemble of colloidal particles .",

    "it was observed just a macroscopic hydromechanical effect associated with specificity of measurements but not a microscopic mechanism of attraction @xcite .",
    "bechinger and his group shown for a high concentrated particle ensemble that different types of interparticle potential result in almost identical correlation functions @xcite .",
    "the conclusion was that an interaction potential should be drawn from experiments with a pair of colloidal particles but not from a large ensemble of them .",
    "another difficulty is connected to an uncertainty in observed particle position caused by diffraction which can result in errors in calculated pair potential .",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein . to reduce the diffraction uncertainty one should use ultraviolet observations .",
    "so reliability of calculation of pair potential on the basis of statistical properties of large ensembles of particles is questionable .    despite a lack of reliability of various experiments on determination of a microscopic mechanism of attraction of like charges it is always intriguing whether they attract or not in reality .",

    "an energy of fluctuating electromagnetic waves depends on a distance between particles and , therefore , it leads to a force .",
    "the second mechanism is generic with the first one since electromagnetic waves are just substituted by hydrodynamic ones .    in the third mechanism moving particles drag a part of a fluid .",
    "a mass of the involved fluid depends on a distance between the particles .",
    "there is a thermal drift of the particles into the region with a larger effective mass which is analogous to classical mechanics .",
    "this can be interpreted as an effective interaction mediated by thermal fluctuations of particle positions in a fluid . in formation of the variable mass high frequency fluctuations of the particles",
    "are involved when dissipative hydrodynamic effects are not important @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to euler hydrodynamics and gives rise to the term `` euler mass '' .",
    "the formation of euler mass reminds the equipartition law when a mean kinetic energy is @xmath6 regardless of dissipation .",
    "this is due to that the mean kinetic energy is also determined by high frequencies .",
    "there is a substantial difference among the above attraction mechanisms .",
    "the first and the third ones survive when an interparticle distance becomes larger than the debye screening length . on this distance",
    "the dlvo repulsion is very small and the above two mechanisms are the only interaction .",

    "a relative role of attraction @xmath5 and @xmath3 was also analyzed in ref .",

    "a goal of this paper is to study the three above attraction potentials for two particles and for one near a wall ( walls ) .",
    "the energy of fluctuating electromagnetic field around two particles depends on a distance @xmath7 between them and , therefore , results in an interaction force . it is called van der waals force @xcite .",

    "there are two types of fluid motion , one of them is a transverse diffusion and the second one is longitudinal sound waves associated with the density variation .",
    "the equilibrium free energy of transverse motions is determined by the boltzmann distribution of their kinetic energies and does not depend on the friction coefficient in the thermal limit .",
    "the free energy of transverse motions in the thermal limit depends on the total volume , but not on relative positions of bodies . therefore , transverse fluctuations do not result in an interaction .",
    "quite opposite situation occurs for longitudinal motions , when the total free energy is a sum of energies of different sound modes .",

    "the first formula ( [ 14 ] ) was obtained in ref .",

    "@xcite for electromagnetic fluctuations and perfectly conducting planes .",
    "the fluctuation interaction ( [ 13 ] ) depends on the debye screening length .",

    "when two objects are not flat but they are close enough interacting by small parts of their surfaces which are almost flat , one can derive an interaction potential from the flat approximation ( [ 14 ] ) integrating over the surfaces .",

    "in an electrolyte the interaction @xmath4 , mediated by plasmons , is strongly screened ( [ 14 ] ) .",
    "the van der waals interaction @xmath3 , mediated by photons of a frequency in the visible range , is not sensitive to the plasmon effects .",
    "the mechanism of variable mass is connected solely with incompressible fluid fluctuations .",
    "therefore , only the conventional van der waals interaction @xmath3 and variable mass mechanisms @xmath5 can survive in an electrolyte .",
    "the interaction due to variable mass is considered in the following sections .",
    "for the purpose of illustration of the variable mass mechanism one can consider a simple mechanical analogy .",

    "but in the case of a variable mass @xmath55 the mean displacement @xmath56 .",
    "this is due to that a particle velocity is smaller at a region of a larger mass just to keep the total energy to be constant .",
    "according to that , the particle spends more time at the region of a larger mass .",
    "this is equivalent to the certain effective attraction @xmath57 to a region of a larger mass . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , for a slow varying @xmath55 the total effective potential becomes @xmath58 .",
    "a real particle with friction participates the brownian motion characterized by the certain temperature @xmath0 .",
    "we briefly repeat here the main arguments leading to an effective potential @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the langevin equation , describing such processes , has the form @xmath59 short time fluctuations of the velocity @xmath60 are well separated from the slow drift in an effective potential .",
    "indeed , according to fluctuation dissipation theorem , the mean value of the kinetic energy @xmath61 corresponds to the equipartition law and is contributed by short time fluctuations related to the infinitely large circle in the plane of complex frequency .",
    "substitution of that mean value to eq .",
    "( [ 16 ] ) leads to the effective potential @xmath62 @xcite , where @xmath63 the expression ( [ 17 ] ) is an exact result in the thermal limit ( no quantum fluctuations ) as the equipartition law .",
    "we remind what happens in the conventional case of position - independent masses .",
    "in that situation in the thermal limit one can put all frequencies to be zero since they provide only quantum corrections to the partition function .",
    "the remaining part of the partition function is determined solely by a potential energy and does not depend on velocities .",
    "the scenario becomes different for a position - dependent mass . in this case",
    "one can use the following general arguments .",

    "to calculate the effective fluctuation potential even for system with a complicated dynamics , one has to find in the high frequency limit the mass tensor and to insert it into eq .",

    "it is promising to take a surface which adjusts the spherical particle better than two perpendicular planes .",
    "for example , it can be a cylinder with the particle inside . in this case",
    "an interaction is a few or even ten times larger than @xmath149 ( two perpendicular planes ) .",
    "the minimum value of an interaction potential @xmath149 , when @xmath0 is room temperature , is approximately a border of experimental resolution .",
    "so in a conventional electrolyte the attraction a micron sized particle to two perpendicular planes or to an interior surface of a cylinder can be experimentally observed .",
    "for like charged colloidal particles two mechanisms of attraction between them survive when the interparticle distance is larger than the debye screening length .",
    "one of them is the conventional van der waals attraction and the second one is the attraction mechanism mediated by thermal fluctuations of particle position .",
    "the latter is related to an effective variable mass ( euler mass ) of the particles produced by a fluid motion involved .",
    "the most stronger attraction potential ( up to the value of temperature @xmath0 ) corresponds to a situation of uncharged particles and a relatively large debye screening length . in this case",
    "the third mechanism of attraction enters the game .",
    "it is mediated by thermal fluctuations of fluid density .",
    "we thank j. ruiz - garcia , c. bechinger , and m. kirchbach for valuable discussions ."
