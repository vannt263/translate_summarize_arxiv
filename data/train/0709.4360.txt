    "it was soon realized @xcite that on these fractals the macroscopic conductance is isotropic even starting from microscopic anisotropy .",
    "hence , _ anisotropic _ networks were considered , in order to find the scaling exponent @xmath11 with which the conductance anisotropy ( defined as the difference from 1 of the ratio of two conductances @xmath12 and @xmath13 measured along different directions ) vanishes : @xmath14 .",
    "+ the problem consists in finding the decimation transformation @xmath0 connecting the conductances of generation @xmath15 of a fractal to those of generation @xmath16 , then linearizing @xmath0 near the isotropic point .",
    "the largest eigenvalue of the linearized map , @xmath17 , is then related to the isotropic exponent by @xmath18 ; the second eigenvalue @xmath19 is related to the anisotropy exponent by @xmath20 . since",
    "no simple method is known for finding @xmath0 for @xmath21 , the analytical challenges in the anisotropic case are much greater .",
    "the greatest effort in this direction at that time was that by vannimenus and kneevi @xcite , who managed to find @xmath22 for @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and suggested the general form @xmath25/\\ln 2 $ ] ( corresponding to @xmath26 ) .",
    "more recently , in the light of a renewed interest in the restoration of isotropy in several models defined on fractals @xcite , jafarizadeh @xcite succeeded in proving the formula suggested in @xcite for @xmath1-simplex lattices for any @xmath1 .",
    "+ the general problem of the decimation of a network of conductances on the @xmath1-simplex lattice had never been completely solved up to now . in a previous paper @xcite",
    "we found the exact map for the decimation of a network of impedances on a three - dimensional sierpiski gasket ( 4-simplex lattice ) , with a method based on the direct manipulation of the laplacian matrix of the circuit . in this paper",
    "we generalize that method and show a detailed procedure to find the decimation map @xmath0 for arbitrary @xmath1 . instead of conductances , more general complex admittances will be used . for the first time , a systematic analysis of the asymptotic expansion of @xmath0 near the isotropic fixed point will be given .",
    "+ the main results are the following .",
    "there are always exactly _ three _ eigenvalues regardless of @xmath1 , that is , of the dimension of the fractal ( being two just for the two - dimensional system ) .",
    "the third eigenvalue is @xmath27 and is related to a secondary anisotropy exponent equal to @xmath3/\\ln 2 $ ] ; however , this exponent crosses over to @xmath4/\\ln 2 $ ] for large systems .",
    "the eigenspaces corresponding to @xmath19 and @xmath28 will be studied for the first time .",
    "we will show that the eigenvectors corresponding to @xmath19 are those that allow a direct simplified ( mesh - to - star ) treatment of the problem .",
    "it will also be found that the eigenspace corresponding to @xmath28 is related to the space of cycles of even length on the complete graph @xmath5 , and has the highest dimensionality for @xmath1 large , scaling as @xmath29 .",
