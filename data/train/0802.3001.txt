    "green s functions @xcite are encountered as response functions , time - ordered expectation values , certain solutions of boundary - value problems or resolvent kernels .",
    "this introduction to green s functions is based on their role as kernels of differential equations . the procedures to construct solutions to a differential equation with an external source or with an inhomogeneity term",
    "are put together to _ derive _ the dyson equation for the green s function of the inhomogeneous system .",
    "very different areas of physics such as , for example , electrodynamics ( see section ii and @xcite ) and quantum transport ( see section iii and @xcite ) , can profit from such green s function formalisms .",
    "green s function formalisms do not present a cure - all for solving differential equations , because essentially the problem of finding the solution of the differential equation is shifted to that of finding the corresponding green s function .",
    "this can , however , be a simplification and even give access to the solution of a more general class of problems .",
    "starting from ordinary differential equations , this short review is meant to introduce how the corresponding green s functions are defined and how they are involved in constructing the solutions for different types of differential equations .",
    "although bearing similarities , the green s function formalism can go beyond perturbation theory .",
    "special emphasize is laid here upon the parallels between homogeneous and inhomogeneous ordinary differential and green s functions equations .",
    "the starting point is a homogeneous differential equation @xmath0 which we suppose is exactly solvable , although @xmath1 will not explicitly be needed .",
    "@xmath2 is some differential operator which may include multiplication with a constant or even another function of @xmath3 .",
    "@xmath3 is either a space or time variable .",
    "what we need to know is the solution @xmath4 of the corresponding green s functions equation @xmath5 @xmath4 is a tensor - like function of two arguments , @xmath2 only acting on the first of them .",
    "like @xmath4 replaces @xmath6 on the left , the zero on the right side of ( 1 ) is replaced by a @xmath7-distribution in ( 2 ) .",
    "there is no general recipe , but knowing @xmath1 can help to get @xmath8 .",
    "having @xmath4 , the construction of a solution @xmath9 of the differential equation with a source term @xmath10 on the right side @xmath11 is straight forward . of course , a solution @xmath12 of ( 1 )",
    "can be added independently of @xmath10 , so we only need to proove that the integral term from ( 3 ) satisfies ( 4 ) : @xmath13 \\ ; q(\\xi ' ) \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\int d\\xi ' \\ ; \\delta(\\xi-\\xi ' ) \\ ; q(\\xi ' ) = q(\\xi ) \\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] ( all integrals are understood to range over the entire @xmath3-space . )      instead of a source term , the differential equation can contain a potential term which we shall call an inhomogeneity . @xmath14",
    "that is a @xmath3-dependent function @xmath15 multiplied with @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath16 is not included in @xmath2 , because we assume that it so much complicates the equation that a standard solution is no longer known .",
    "the minus sign is a useful convention .",
    "we put the inhomogeneity term on the right    @xmath17    to make ( 5 ) formally look like ( 4 ) . with @xmath18 playing the role of @xmath10 a formal solution is constructed analogously to ( 3 ) : @xmath19 this presents an implicit equation for @xmath20 , the so - called _ lippmann - schwinger _ equation .",
    "we have replaced the differential equation by an integral equation . inserting the solution of the homogeneous equation @xmath12 also for @xmath20 in the integral on the right side of ( 6 ) would give the _ born _ approximation @xmath21 , which is appropriate if @xmath18 is a small perturbation compared to @xmath22 .",
    "however , it is the virtue of the green s functions method that in contrast to perturbation theory the inhomogeneity need _ not _ be a small deviation . although not yet providing an explicit solution for @xmath20 , one can make use of ( 6 ) in numerical calculations ( see section ii and @xcite ) . as ( 2 )",
    "is the corresponding green s function equation with a point source to the homogeneous equation ( 1 ) , the equation defining the green s function @xmath23 for the inhomogeneous case derived from ( 5 ) reads : @xmath24 \\ ; g(\\xi,\\xi ' ) = \\delta(\\xi-\\xi')\\ ] ] however , while supposing that we know or can easily guess @xmath8 , there is no hint yet how to calculate @xmath25 .      finally we have to treat the most general case with source and inhomogeneity term : @xmath26 in analogy to ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) a yet formal solution can be written down using ( 7 ) : @xmath27 here we have the freedom to add any solution of ( 6 ) to the integral .    but let us start again solving the problem directly from ( 8) which we rewrite as    @xmath28    we compare this with ( 5a ) and construct a solution of the same form as ( 6 ) .",
    "@xmath29 takes the role of @xmath12 , because it would satisfy ( 8a ) if the right side were zero .",
    "@xmath20 has to be replaced by @xmath30 . using ( 3 ) for @xmath29",
    "we obtain @xmath31 ( 10 ) could also have been established by a different line of thought . in ( 8) putting everything that differs from the homogeneous equation ( 1 ) on the right side gives    @xmath32",
    "if it were not for the inhomegeneity term @xmath18 , the solution would be ( 3 ) . and",
    "if it were not for the source term @xmath10 , we could use ( 6 ) .",
    "although this is , of course , not a correct way to solve non - homogeneous differential equations , we can understand ( 10 ) as an ansatz adding these two contributions .",
    "the @xmath12-part does not have to be written twice .",
    "and @xmath30 has to appear instead of @xmath20 in the integral taken from ( 6 ) .",
    "this still unknown @xmath30 leaves the neccessary freedom to somehow counterbalance the @xmath10-term not present in ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) , which justifies ( 10 ) as an ansatz .",
    "whichever way it was obtained , ( 10 ) is an implicit integral equation for @xmath30 as ( 6 ) is for @xmath20 .",
    "now we shall profit from the fact that with ( 9 ) we have a second representation of @xmath30 .",
    "insert the expression from ( 9 ) for @xmath30 both on the left and on the right side in ( 10 ) : @xmath33 \\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath20 on the left cancels with @xmath12 and one integral term on the right according to ( 6 ) and we are left with @xmath34 this is an implicit equation for the unknown green s function @xmath23 . but",
    "as @xmath23 by definition ( 7 ) does not depend on any source term , ( 11 ) must be valid for arbitrary @xmath10 .",
    "the special choice @xmath35 gives @xmath36 which after carrying out the @xmath37-integrals and then renaming @xmath38 to @xmath37 becomes @xmath39 ( 11 ) is the general implicit integral equation for the inhomogeneous system s green s function @xmath23 and called _ dyson _ equation .",
    "we could have derived ( 11 ) by doing all calculations from ( 8) on with only a point source @xmath40 instead of @xmath41 .",
    "putting in the solutions ( 3 ) and ( 9 ) for this case would just have looked a bit awkward . ( 11 ) is not an explicit solution for @xmath23 , but still an implicit equation , and even though it is often written as @xmath42 one must not forget that there is a convolution - like integration over the inner @xmath3-index behind the sequence of factors @xmath43 .",
    "the integration can either be transformed into a discrete finite sum , and thus ( 11 ) into a linear system of equations solvable by a matrix inversion ( see section ii and @xcite ) , or the convolution can be replaced by a multiplication going to frequency space by a fourier transformation ( see section iii and @xcite ) .",
    "\\(10 ) and the preparation for ( 11 ) would have looked much more elegant leaving out @xmath12 and the @xmath20-terms right from the start .",
    "indeed , one could argue that in ( 3 ) one is only interested in the part different from the trivial homogenous solution , if no further boundary conditions have to be accounted for . with a similar argument ,",
    "the @xmath20-part could have been dropped in ( 9 ) .",
    "the identities    @xmath44    @xmath45    @xmath46    @xmath47    would obviously also have given ( 11 ) .",
    "leaving out @xmath12 in ( 6 ) would be precarious ( see below ) .",
    "however , dropping it when constructing ( 11 ) along our second line of thought causes no problem . the term with @xmath10 will ensure that @xmath48 can not simply be zero .",
    "there is some subtlety about the @xmath12 contribution in ( 6 ) .",
    "( 6 * ) has the trivial solution @xmath49 and not necessarily another one .",
    "surely , @xmath50 satisfies ( 5 ) , but it is not what we want .",
    "@xmath12 is the background excitation replacing boundary conditions in this kind of problem , which shall become clear when discussing electrodynamics ( see following article ) .",
    "@xmath12 acts as a source term which - instead of being put in @xmath10 - can be more appropriately and conveniently set as a fixed part of the @xmath6 we are looking for . inserting ( 6 ) into itself ever and ever again , @xmath20 is developed into a series in powers of @xmath51 : @xmath52 just for shorthand notation we dropped the arguments and integration variables and in the third line also the integral signs .",
    "the resulting series is recognized from perturbation theory summing interactions to zeroth , first , second , etc . order .",
    "if there were no contribution @xmath12 in @xmath20 , only the contribution of @xmath51 to power infinity would exist with nothing to multiply to at the end .",
    "in other words we would have no basis on which to develop @xmath20 .",
    "the green s functions formalism as we use it aims at solving ( 6 ) , ( 10 ) or ( 11 ) in a closed form , _ not _ cutting the series in ( 12 ) at some finite order .",
    "the development ( 12 ) is only shown here precisely to demonstrate that interactions are included to all orders as well as to explain the importance of the homogeneous background contribution .",
    "the dyson equation ( 11 ) can be expanded in an analogous manner to the lippmann - schwinger equation , by the way prooving the equivalence to its complementary form @xmath53 : @xmath54 ( integration over inner arguments is understood in all contributions to the sums . ) either formally or as a matrix calculation in finite discrete @xmath3-space , ( 11 ) is often solved as @xmath55 developing the @xmath56-factor in ( 14 ) into a geometric series just results in the infinite sums written in ( 13 ) .",
    "putting together ( 12 ) and ( 13 ) we can get an alternative representation to ( 6 ) for the solution of the inhomogeneous differential equation : @xmath57 therefore in the case that should it be easier to get the green s function @xmath23 than to solve the implicit equation ( 6 ) for @xmath20 , we see that @xmath23 can be useful also for treating the equation without an external source @xmath10 .",
    "nevertheless , ( 15 ) again illustrates that @xmath58 plays the role of the source .      using green s functions",
    "it has been shown how differential equations can be treated that differ from easily solvable ones by an additional potential term or an arbitrary source term .",
    "the formalism as presented here is for open - boundary in contrast to boundary - value problems @xcite . from constructing the solutions of the differential equations",
    ", we also obtained the constituting relation for the inhomogeneous system s green s function , which characterizes the response to a point source and includes all - order interactions .",
    "examples of applications will be given in the two following sections .",
    "the fundamental homogeneous - medium green s tensor of electrodynamics is deduced from the field of a dipole . based upon that a numerical procedure is presented to solve the wave - equation for the near - field in a scattering setup for arbitrary material distributions .",
    "the full inhomogeneous system s green s function is not explicitly needed to get the fields , although it can be obtained by a very similar calculation and in optics can be interpreted as a density of states .      the typical problem in nano - optics",
    "@xcite is the situation that some tiny structures are illuminated by an extended source , a plane wave for example , and then one is interested in the field distribution that arises from multiple scattering @xcite , especially to identify places where the field intensity gets considerably enhanced @xcite .",
    "a theory can be based on green s functions , however , their implication differs slightly from the standardly taught cases of fixed boundary field values @xcite or located sources .",
    "modern optical scanning microscopes make it possible to probe and map directly even different quantities of the near - field @xcite , such as the electric and magnetic field intensities @xcite or the density of states @xcite .",
    "applications of tayloring nano - structures with respect to optical properties include resonant particles @xcite and cavities @xcite , squeezed fields @xcite , wave guides and their adressing @xcite as well as transmission apertures @xcite and lithography masks @xcite .",
    "we here present the green s functions formalism that forms the bases of a finite - element quite effective numerical algorithm used in current research @xcite .",
    "this treatise is also given as an application example of the general methods to solve differential equations with certain perturbations presented in the preceeding paper .",
    "the discussion can be reduced to monochromatic light , that is a single frequency @xmath59 and thus time dependence @xmath60 for the fields . with non - magnetic materials",
    "the problem is to find the solution @xmath61 of the wave equation @xmath62 ( 1 ) is a differential equation of the type ( 5 ) from section i. there is no source term on the right hand side of ( 1 ) .",
    "if the source were , for example , a dipole located at some point , a source term with its oscillation strength and direction would have to be put on the right as @xmath63 .",
    "however , we shall see that a plane - wave source can be and is better included in ( 1 ) as it is . for simplicity",
    "we shall assume that the background medium , in which objects with different permittivities @xmath64 are located ( fig.1 ) , is vacuum with permittivity @xmath65 .",
    "for another embedding medium , its dielectric constant @xmath66 would take the role of @xmath65 . in ( 1 ) @xmath67 of the material distribution designates the dimensionless relative permittivity with respect to vacuum or the background medium .",
    "to separate ( 1 ) into a part representing a homogeneous differential equation with known solution and an inhomogeneity write its as    @xmath68    the correspondances to the quantities of the general formalism given in section i are @xmath69 and @xmath12 will become @xmath70 .",
    "we can write down the solution following section i after having prepared the background green s function in the next section .",
    "in any case we need the green s function @xmath71 of the homogeneous problem satisfying @xmath72 with @xmath73 .",
    "@xmath4 will be a @xmath74 tensor or matrix here .",
    "more commonly @xcite the small letter @xmath4 is used for the scalar function @xmath75 with @xmath73 .",
    "the green s function @xmath4 from ( 2 ) is then named @xmath76 with index @xmath77 for _ homogeneous_. there are several ways to obtain @xmath4 .",
    "one is based on the knowledge that if we have a scalar function @xmath78 solving @xmath79 , then @xmath80 and @xmath81 with a constant but arbitrary pivot vector @xmath82 will both solve the vectorial equation @xmath83 .",
    "the tensor @xmath4 looked for in ( 2 ) can be constructed out of @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 together with @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "we shall not enter into the details of this mathematically slightly precarious approach @xcite .",
    "a second recipe just mentioned here for completeness is given by the following statement @xcite : if @xmath90 satisfies ( 3 ) , then @xmath91 is the tensor defined by ( 2 ) . of course , because of being in homogeneous space @xmath92 and @xmath4 effectively are functions of @xmath93 alone .",
    "@xmath94 is the unit matrix in 3 by 3 cartesian coordinate space and @xmath95 means building a matrix out of derivatives @xmath96 .",
    "we shall deduce @xmath4 from a physical reasoning . from standard electrodynamics",

    "a point dipole is the elementary excitation corresponding to the @xmath7 on the right side of ( 2 ) .",
    "the physical meaning of @xmath4 is to tell us what field any such dipole would have .",
    "that is shown formally in the first matrix in ( 5a ) . decomposing any @xmath98 into its cartesian components , ( 5 )",

    "compared to the above expression @xmath116 from ( 4 ) has a minus sign and misses a factor @xmath117 . as will be discussed later ,",
    "the source to put into equation ( 1 ) corresponding to an oscillating dipole is not the dipole moment @xmath98 itself , but @xmath118 times @xmath98 .",
    "and because @xmath119 we have @xmath120 the formula ( 6 ) fails for @xmath121 or @xmath122 .",
    "@xmath116 including the case @xmath122 can be represented using the principal volume method @xcite . in practice , working with finite elements , the value to put for @xmath4 of its two arguments the same place can be derived from the polarization of a dielectric body .",

    "a numerical procedure can be deduced if the objects with @xmath129 only occupy fractions of space rather small on the scale of the wavelength , not at all principally necessarily much smaller than @xmath130 , though .",
    "then we divide them up into finite elements ( fig.1 ) of volume @xmath131 , which we enumerate @xmath132 and associate permittivities @xmath133 or perturbances @xmath134 and local fields @xmath135 uniform over @xmath131 .",
    "the linear sizes of the object cells should not exceed about @xmath136 .",

    "as all terms follow the same scheme , the second is treated in an exemplary way here ( all integrals run from @xmath538 to @xmath539 ) :    @xmath540    doing the @xmath541,@xmath542- and @xmath543-integrals gives @xmath544 .",
    "then even the exponentials with @xmath352 cancel and the term simplifies to @xmath545 in our case ( 31 ) tells us that @xmath546 are all identical and real , @xmath547 is the complex conjugate of @xmath548 and @xmath549 is the complex conjugate of @xmath550 of the same @xmath59 as @xmath513 is purely imaginary , too .",
    "thus the last two terms in ( 43b ) are the complex conjugates of the first two and thus twice the real part of these first two can be taken for @xmath551 . in the superconducting version of the model , where @xmath400 and @xmath4 actually are @xmath59-dependent , complex conjugate relations @xcite also exist between @xmath400s as well as @xmath4s , and the current formula can be reduced in the same way . just to note the quite general formula @xcite in short form : @xmath552 for the integrand from the second term in our model we get @xmath553 where the signs refer to @xmath59 greater or less than zero and come out reversed for the first term with @xmath527 , because there is @xmath335 instead of @xmath333 .",
    "care has to be taken with the reference point for @xmath59 in both terms .",
    "this may easily be overlooked in the normal conducting case here in contrast to the superconducting case where @xmath400 indeed is @xmath59-dependent and like @xmath23 as a function of only one argument always referred to the same fermi level ( the left , for example ) .",
    "if we call the argument of @xmath528 from the second term @xmath59 , the one for @xmath527 in the first term is @xmath554 . on an @xmath555-axis , the second term changes sign at zero , however , the first jumps at @xmath556 ( fig.6 ) .",
    "a shift of the integration parameter can not be made independently for both terms .",
    "thus , for the normal conducting model here    @xmath557    in principle the convention is needed , that the @xmath400-argument always refers to the left side , but for @xmath4 general formula like ( 44 ) for a single bulk with fermi level at zero frequency are applied . a more involved situation where choosing integration intervals consistently for all contributing current terms is crucial",

    "@xmath346 is the transmission probability of the conductance channel through the junction we regarded .",
    "the result that in the normal - conducting case the current is proportional to the voltage is not at all surprising , of course .",
    "the non - trivial result is the conversion of the quantum mechanical transmission amplitude @xmath383 to the measurable transmission probability @xmath346 . @xmath563",
    "if @xmath564 . and a totally open channel with @xmath565 has transmission probability @xmath566 .",
    "it may seem a contradiction on the one hand calculating the current from a changing amount of charge on one side and on the other hand saying that missing charges are replaced and superfluous ones led away by the voltage source . a slightly different viewpoint may help to get convinced that the calculated quantity is indeed the current in the stationary , but non - equilibrium system .",
    "the crucial point was putting on to evaluate @xmath567 in state @xmath568 . without further ado",
    "we could not tell whether this state of the coupled system was occupied or not .",
    "the schrdinger equation ( 5 ) set up the left and right material properties as well as the coupling across the junction , however , did not take any account of the effect of the voltage source . without need to specify real locations for the division ,",
    "just principally view our structure as consisting of a junction region and leads .",
    "the @xmath568 defined through ( 5 ) describes states in the junction region . but think of them as offered by the system and following their time development whether occupied or not .",
    "the leads are always occupied exactly up to their fermi levels .",
    "electrons freshly supplied by the voltage source need not be in phase with present ones . a random phase is most easily modelled by assuming the left lead wave function at any time @xmath569 without a phase in contrast to the assumed @xmath570 for the left side of the junction region . which states to which extent actually get occupied in the left side of the junction region , that is @xmath571 ,",
    "is determined by the overlap of @xmath568 with the phaseless left lead wave function @xmath499 , which we recognize as @xmath572 .",
    "the current then is the change in time of @xmath433 due to charge flow through the junction , that is processes inside the junction region only , corresponding to what our hamiltonian was set up for .",
    "a similar line of thought with state overlaps can be applied to the passing of charges out of the junction region into the ( right ) lead ; it may be helpful to view this as putting empty states or holes into the junction region , though .",
    "of course , only the l - part of @xmath568 can overlap with @xmath499 .",
    "@xmath574 can thus be replaced by @xmath568 in our new expression for @xmath433 .",
    "recalling the operator definition ( 34 ) the time derivative of @xmath433 @xmath575 is identical to the ansatz made by putting together ( 33 ) and ( 34 ) in ( 37 ) .          at first glance the problem posed by the schrdinger equations without and with coupling , ( 1 ) and ( 5 ) ,",
    "especially if we regard a single energy level on each side with corresponding @xmath576 and @xmath379 as in fig.1c , looks like the two - level system known from quantum mechanics textbooks @xcite . by the coupling",
    "the two energy levels are shifted .",
    "the new eigenstates lie further apart from one another . if the system is initiated in one of the uncoupled states , it will oscillate harmonically between the two levels , and both both the period of the oscillation as well as the maximum transition probability to the other state depend on the energy difference of the original states .",
    "even if the time dependence of the interaction ( 18 ) can be got rid of by changing to the interaction picture , it makes no sense to numbly calculate eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a hamiltonian @xmath577 .",
    "it is not clear from which reference levels such eigenenergies @xmath578 should be counted as zero levels are different for @xmath576 and @xmath379 .",
    "if one tries to refer the left and right energies already of the uncoupled system to the same reference level , @xmath579 for example ( fig.8 ) , @xmath580 ( and @xmath524 ) can not be taken as eigenstates any more , because from @xmath581 with @xmath582 it does _ not _ follow that @xmath583 equals @xmath584 .",
    "the standard treatment of the two - level system is not applicable to the non - equilibrium situation .      despite having been the simplest example to introduce the green s functions scheme , applying the formalism to the normal conducting junction to get out that the current is proportional to the applied voltage was breaking a butterfly on the wheel .",
    "although repeatedly mentioned , fully developing the extension to the superconducting case is beyond the scope of this presentation . but the resulting current - voltage characteristics shall be shown as a plea for the usefulness of the method . a different approach based on matching wave functions @xcite leads to identical results , though .",
    "some formula shall be listed , because they are not necessarily written out in complete analogy to the presentation here in @xcite and other literature .",
    "working in the quasiparticle picture , in the superconducting case each entry in lr - space of a green s or transfer function expands into another 2x2 matrix in nambu space over electrons and holes .",
    "there is @xcite : @xmath585 @xmath4 is the same for ll and rr .",

    "@xmath589 here signs refer to the lr- and rl - direction , respectively .",
    "remark the reversed signs for holes in the exponential compared to electrons .",
    "there is no electron - hole conversion during a single hopping .",
    "the @xmath590- and @xmath591-elements of @xmath4 introduce so - called andreev reflection .",
    "( cooper - pair tunneling @xcite is not included . )",
    "@xmath400 is a full matrix in @xmath590-space and has to be set up as @xmath592 we skipped the distinction of reference @xmath593 as in ( 25 ) , because in practice only one type , e.g. @xmath424 , has to be calculated , as then @xmath419 follows from complex conjugation .",
    "@xmath284 runs over all integers .",
    "a dyson equation like ( 32 ) leads to a recursion which connects @xmath594 to @xmath595 and @xmath596 .",
    "it can be solved by reasonably truncating the @xmath284-range .",
    "then , just also summing over @xmath284 , the established current formula ( 45 ) can be used .",
    "expressions like ( 32 ) have to sum over all possible combinations of @xmath439- and @xmath77-indices .",
    "for example : @xmath597    ) [ reproduced after @xcite ] .",
    "the normal conducting @xmath598 is added for comparison ( keep @xmath586 just for units).,width=264 ]    to point out the andreev reflection in the model , we look at a term @xmath599 with alternating @xmath439- and @xmath77-indices from the development ( 21 ) . such a sequence will also be contained as parts in higher - order terms from ( 21 ) or ( 24 ) . contracting inner time arguments results in @xmath600 because the @xmath541 and @xmath542-integration give @xmath601 . in fig.9 for holes the energy axis has to be reversed as compared to electrons .",
    "therefore the initial @xmath59 is negative . for the argument here , it does not matter if the beginning factor in ( 51 ) is @xmath602 or @xmath603 .",
    "if it were @xmath77 , then the andreev reflection marked by the dashed arrow would follow .",
    "the last index of the last @xmath604 could also be @xmath77 instead of @xmath439 .",
    "whereas in the normal conducting case in multiple reflections the charge carrying particle always came back to the same energy with regard to the fermi level when coming back to the same side of the junction ( fig.1 ) , in ( 51 ) the frequency argument of the first @xmath604 is shifted by twice the applied voltage equivalent with respect to the second @xmath604 ( fig.9 ) .",
    "such shifts enable transport even when the gaps of the left and right side are still overlapping , that is for voltages below @xmath605 ( fig.10 ) . in the @xmath598-curves steps towards lower voltages at fractions of @xmath606",
    "are associated to ever higher - order andreev reflections .",
    "of course , these current contributions become the more prominent the greater the channel transmission . besides the step heights and positions the curvature on each step is an important signature .",

    "the interference of transport processes of different order is correctly taken into account .",
    "simpler models @xcite that add up tranfer probabilities proportional to @xmath607 can not reproduce these characteristics and are only valid for low transmissions @xmath608 .",
    "it has been explained on a quite basic level how quantum transport between two reservoirs in a stationary non - equilibrium state can be modelled .",
    "the purpose was to present a green s functions technique for handling coupling in the context of a field of current research interest , namely transport through point contacts . although besides the general formalism ( also see section i ) requiring the development of quite some more subject specific mathematical framework such as the transfer green s functions , the transport through a contact with arbitrary transmission is a suitable example to illustrate the inclusion of interaction up to all orders in the implicit dyson equations .",
