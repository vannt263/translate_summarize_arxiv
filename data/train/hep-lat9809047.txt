    "the three - dimensional u(1)+higgs theory contains a complex scalar field @xmath0 and an abelian gauge field @xmath1 and is defined by the action @xmath2.\\ ] ] this contains a dimensionful gauge coupling constant @xmath3 , which defines the scale of the system , and the two dimensionless parameters @xmath4 the continuum action can be discretised using either the compact or the non - compact formalism for the gauge field  in the following we shall use exclusively the non - compact formalism , which has several advantages over the compact one .",
    "the three - dimensional u(1)+higgs theory contains classical , cylindrically symmetric solutions of the equations of motion  strings .",
    "these topological objects have been studied in great detail in connection with superconductivity and cosmic strings .",
    "they can be characterized by @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the _ winding number_. this can be defined on the lattice @xcite by computing the integer @xmath6 for a closed loop @xmath7 by @xmath8 where @xmath9_\\pi-\\alpha_i({\\bf x}).\\ ] ]",
    "the phase structure of the theory at zero external magnetic field is strictly speaking only known in the compact theory @xcite .",
    "the study of the non - compact theory is in progress .",
    "however , it is known that at small values of the scalar self - coupling  @xmath10 , perturbation theory works and the theory has a first order phase transition from the symmetric to the broken phase .",
    "the transition weakens as @xmath10 is increased . at some critical value @xmath11",
    "it is expected that the transition becomes continuous .",
    "the continuous transition can be observed by measuring the photon mass .",
    "we suggest that in the non - compact theory the string free energy could be used as an order parameter , as well .",
    "the situation changes dramatically if an external magnetic field is present . depending on @xmath10 ,",
    "the system can have either two or four phases .",
    "if @xmath10 is small , there is just one transition from the symmetric to the broken phase ( from normal to superconducting phase in condensed matter terminology ) , while for large @xmath10 the system has also a vortex phase .",
    "this vortex phase can be divided to two further phases , a vortex lattice phase and a vortex liquid phase .",
    "the transition between these two vortex phases has been observed to be first order in real high @xmath12 superconductors @xcite , and it would be interesting to see if this is predicted already by the ginzburg - landau theory . at the moment , the computer simulations needed to answer this question would be extremely costly .",
    "a constant magnetic field in the @xmath13-direction corresponds to a background gauge field , for instance @xmath14 .",
    "however , the dynamics of the system may prefer to distribute the flux of the magnetic field in an inhomogeneous way .",
    "in fact , the only thing which remains constant and can be fixed is the total flux through a given surface ( e.g. , the whole lattice ) . on a lattice with strictly periodic boundaries ,",
    "there is no magnetic flux going through the lattice .",
    "however , by choosing the boundary conditions to be , for example , @xmath15 one forces a magnetic flux @xmath16 to go through the xy - plane . note that this is only possible if one uses a non - compact gauge field . also , even though all values of the magnetic field are possible in principle , values which lead to a non - periodicity in the hopping term cause large inhomogeneities , so that in a finite volume one can only use discrete values , namely @xmath17 for the magnetic field .",
    "thus the allowed values of the flux are @xmath18 .    even though in principle the magnetic field can not penetrate the type i superconductor ( @xmath10 small ) , the lattice construction above forces a flux through the lattice .",
    "what happens is that a macroscopic volume of the system remains in the symmetric phase , allowing the flux to penetrate the lattice . in type",
    "ii superconductors it is , however , expected that the magnetic field penetrates the system forming real vortices .",
    "even though the classical string solutions have a higher energy than the true vacuum , it is possible that string - like objects are generated by quantum or thermal fluctuations .",
    "this possibility has been studied in both the u(1)+higgs theory @xcite and the su(2)+higgs theory @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the behavior of the string density  number of strings passing through a closed loop  was studied .",
    "it was found that at finite lattice spacing the @xmath19 loop shows clear dependence of the parameters @xmath10 and @xmath20 .",
    "however , at the continuum limit the result is independent of the parameters ( and can in fact be obtained from a theory containing just a free massless scalar field )  the result is pure uv noise .",
    "it was also shown that the @xmath21-loop , which has a constant physical size as the lattice spacing is decreased , can contain divergent parts or can get a contribution from the uv - noise .",
    "the easiest way to remove unphysical contributions is to study the differences of string densities at various @xmath20 , which should be free of the uv - noise .",
    "we present a study of the vortex free energy @xmath22 per unit length at @xmath23 and at @xmath24 . this observable",
    "is an order parameter , as its value is finite in the higgs phase and zero in the coulomb phase .",
    "a quantized magnetic flux of magnitude @xmath25 in a finite box is forced into the system in one of the arbitrary chosen lattice directions , as described above .",
    "the gauge part of the action on the lattice then has the form @xmath26 otherwise the theory remains unchanged . here",
    "the @xmath27 have nonvanishing values @xmath28 only , if their dual coincides with a closed loop , which on the torus is closed by the boundary .    in the higgs phase ( at small values of @xmath20 ) the vortex free energy @xmath22 per unit",
    "length is finite , @xmath29 in this phase the magnetic flux is confined into a string and a dislocation of linear dimension @xmath30 is formed in the @xmath31 boxes considered .    in the coulomb phase ( large values of @xmath20 ) the vortex free energy @xmath22 vanishes . here",
    "the theory exhibits long range order as characterized by a massless excitation .",
    "large finite size effects within @xmath22 signal the existence of photons .    in figures  1 and 2 we present monte carlo measurements of the quantity @xmath22 .",
    "it can been seen that @xmath22 is finite in the small y - region of the theory .",
    "finite size effects in the quantity @xmath22 are under control at @xmath32 , as can be seen from figure  2 .    there are large finite size effects in the quantity @xmath22 for values of @xmath33 ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "these finite volume values of @xmath22 extrapolate to the value @xmath34 at positive values of @xmath20 .",
    "the vanishing of @xmath22 there and the observation of large finite size effects is consistent with the presence of a massless mode .",
    "our data in the higgs region are close to the mean field result .",
    "mean field scaling is expected to be valid away from the critical point .",
    "it is an open question , whether the critical singularity is dominated by mean field exponents or not .",
    "a more conclusive study is currently being prepared  @xcite .",
