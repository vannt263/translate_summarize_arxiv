    "the tensor interaction plays a very important role in nuclear physics .",
    "it originates from the pion exchange between nucleons , which is the most essential component in the nucleon - nucleon interaction .",
    "the green s function monte carlo ( gfmc ) simulation by the argonne group for light nuclei demonstrated that the pion contribution on the nuclear binding energy is about 80% of the entire contribution of the two - body interaction  @xcite .",
    "the pion exchange interaction can be divided into tensor and central spin - spin components .",
    "if we take a phenomenological potential as the argonne av8@xmath0 potential  @xcite , we see that the lightest nucleus , a deuteron , can not be bound by the central interaction alone : the tensor interaction plays a dominant role in the binding of the deuteron  @xcite . analyzing the energy contribution of the tensor interaction , we find that the transition matrix element between the s - wave and d - wave components provides the largest attraction for the deuteron binding .",
    "this finding motivated the introduction of the tensor - optimized shell model ( tosm ) , where the tosm wave function has a low - momentum shell - model state and also high - momentum 2-particle-2-hole ( 2p-2h ) configurations , aiming at describing heavier nuclei and nuclear matter  @xcite .",
    "the 2p-2h configurations are excited by the tensor interaction from the low - momentum shell - model state , which induces high - momentum transfer between nucleons , and provides a large attraction energy .",
    "the tosm was applied to light mass nuclei as he , li and be isotopes  @xcite .",
    "the level orders and spacings come out to be quite good due to the adequate role of the tensor interaction , although the absolute values for the binding energies are not reproduced due to the lack of the three - body interaction  @xcite .",
    "the saturation property seems satisfied for shell - model states with the use of the bare nucleon - nucleon interaction .",
    "the tosm was able to describe shell - model states and also generate low - lying alpha cluster structures in the spectrum of @xmath1be  @xcite .",
    "however , the tosm could not reproduce sufficient of alpha correlation , and we ought to improve the tosm for multi - cluster states .",
    "the concept of tosm was also applied to the few - body framework and demonstrated its goodness  @xcite",
    ". however , the few - body framework that uses the relative coordinates has difficulty in handling the antisymmetrization for p - shell nuclei .",
    "on the other hand , antisymmetrized molecular dynamics ( amd ) was developed by the kyoto group with great success to describe both the cluster and shell structures simultaneously  @xcite . here",
    ", the nuclear dynamics was controlled by an effective interaction , which is obtained from various experimental data .",
    "there are several cases where the effective interaction has to be changed for various observables of nuclear structure .",
    "a typical case for this change is the ground - state energies of @xmath2c and @xmath3o .",
    "it is highly desirable to use the bare nucleon - nucleon interaction in the amd framework for the description of light nuclei , where the structural change between shell and cluster states is essential . for @xmath1be , both the shell and alpha structures",
    "are observed experimentally and the amd description should be essential for good description of this nucleus  @xcite .",
    "it has become clear from a few - body study and the gfmc simulations for light nuclei that the three - body interaction has to be introduced for a satisfactory description of finite - mass nuclei  @xcite .",
    "the three - body interaction is mainly caused by the pion exchange interaction leading to delta - isobar excitation  @xcite .",
    "hence , its structure is again dominantly described by the successive tensor interaction .",
    "such a three - body interaction usually makes calculations of matrix elements highly complicated . with the success of the tosm for light nuclei and the ability of the amd formulation ,",
    "it is a good idea to combine these two merits for the description of nuclear structure using the bare nucleon - nucleon interaction .",
    "after many trials , we arrived at constructing a powerful method to treat nuclear many - body systems based on the amd wave function and added a tensor component by applying the tensor correlation operator on the amd wave function .",
    "we treat the tensor correlation operator as an operator on two nucleons of many nucleon systems .",
    "if we want to take the matrix elements of the two - body interaction of the tensor - correlated amd wave function , it turns out to calculate up to 6-body operators .",
    "we do these calculations systematically by utilizing the gaussian integrals , which could be done analytically .",
    "hence , we are able to handle any number of multi - body operators systematically . the genuine three - body interaction of the argonne group is naturally described in the new formalism in the same way as tensor - correlated two - body operators .",
    "we call `` this framework tensor - optimized antisymmetrized molecular dynamics '' ( toamd ) .",
    "there are three essential technologies in toamd to calculate multi - body operators based on the gaussian wave functions .",
    "the first important step is to write all the interactions and correlations in addition to the wave functions as a sum of gaussian functions .",
    "we are then able to take all the necessary integrations of the gaussian functions analytically .",
    "the second important step is to take care of the antisymmetrization . for this difficult problem , we write all the interactions and correlations in the momentum space so that we are able to write all operators in separable forms in the particle coordinates  @xcite .",
    "we are then able to use the matrix technique to treat the antisymmetrization systematically .",
    "the third important ingredient is to treat all the necessary momentum integrations with a multiple of momenta in the gaussian integrations .",
    "we introduce the source terms for the momenta and take derivatives of the integrated result of the fundamental gaussian integrals .",
    "all calculations of the matrix elements are performed in the rectangular coordinates of particles using the above important ingredients for multi - body operators .    in light nuclei there",
    "appear cluster structures , which are difficult to describe in the shell @xmath4 mean - field approximation .",
    "the cluster structure is better described in the amd framework using effective interactions , where the @xmath5he wave function is written as @xmath6 gaussian functions .",
    "although some trial was performed to include higher - spin states in the amd framework for @xmath5he , it was not successful in treating the tensor interaction  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the tosm was able to treat the tensor interaction in the shell - model basis by introducing high - momentum 2p-2h configurations .",
    "use of the bare nucleon - nucleon interaction including the strong tensor interaction in the amd framework is highly anticipated .",
    "this is achieved in the present toamd formulation , which is systematical and straightforward to apply to heavier - mass nuclei than those of the gfmc simulation .",
    "we would like to apply the toamd for the description of the coexistence of and competition between shell and cluster structures .",
    "one important application of the toamd is the alpha - condensed states in @xmath1be , @xmath2c , and @xmath3o using the bare nucleon - nucleon interaction  @xcite .",
    "this paper is arranged as follows . in sect.[sec : model ] , we introduce the tensor - optimized antisymmetrized molecular dynamics ( toamd ) , where the toamd wave function and the hamiltonian are written explicitly for nuclear many - body systems . here",
    ", we write all the matrix elements of the hamiltonian in the amd wave function so that we define all ingredients of the toamd theory . in sect.[sec : one_fd ] , we calculate matrix elements of an interaction with one tensor correlation operator , which leads to multi - body operators up to four - body for the amd wave function . in sect.[sec : momentum ] , we write all the necessary integrals and differential formulas for multiple - momentum integrations of gaussian functions . in sect.[sec : two_fd ] , we calculate two - body interactions with two tensor correlation operators as examples of using all the formula developed for the toamd theory .",
