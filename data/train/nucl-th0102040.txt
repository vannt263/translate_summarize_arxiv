    "ideas that we live in a world consisting of @xmath0 compact extra dimensions in addition to the usual four infinite dimensions are not new and date back to the 1930s .",
    "they imply that there are kaluza - klein  ( kk)-modes corresponding to excitations of ordinary standard model particles in the extra dimensions .",
    "such modes , however , have not been seen in any collider experiment so far  @xcite .",
    "recently , a variation of this concept has been revitalized by arkani - hamed _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite who considered an alternative picture in which standard model fields are confined to a four - dimensional `` brane '' while gravity , constituting the dynamics of space - time itself , is allowed to propagate into the whole ( 4+@xmath0 ) dimensional `` bulk '' .",
    "this picture caused some excitement because it provides a natural solution to the hierarchy problem .",
    "as detailed in  @xcite , the extension of the four - dimensional space for gravitons leads to a `` dilution '' of gravity into the extra dimensions and therefore to the smallness of newton s gravitational constant @xmath1 . matching the planck mass @xmath2 in the four - dimensional world to the one in the ( 4+@xmath0 ) dimensional world , @xmath3 , via the relation @xmath4 one can bring the planck mass down from @xmath5  tev to the weak scale of @xmath6  tev by choosing an appropriate size @xmath7 of the extra dimensions .",
    "for one extra dimension , @xmath8  m , in this case gravity  specifically newton s inverse - square law  would be modified on the scale of astronomical distances , a case clearly ruled out .",
    "but already for @xmath9 , @xmath10  mm , which is just out of reach to present experimental measurements of the gravitational force law  @xcite .",
    "another way of testing these models is to search for `` beyond the standard model '' physics at the scale @xmath3 .",
    "even though one would naively expect a violation of the standard model at this scale to be of only gravitational strength , the large number of excited kk - modes at such high energies compensates for the weak coupling between these kk - modes and the ordinary matter fields .",
    "such effects could alter standard model predictions due to virtual kk - mode contributions or manifest themselves in the form of massive graviton production  @xcite .",
    "it might be possible that such effects can be seen in the form of missing energy at future colliders operating at the tev scale like the cern lhc  @xcite .",
    "the most stringent constraints on the size of extra dimensions come from astrophysical considerations .",
    "recently it has been pointed out that an overproduction of massive kk modes in the early universe might result in early matter domination and therefore a lower age of the universe  @xcite .    another way to obtain bounds on",
    "the size of extra dimensions from astrophysics comes from supernova sn1987a .",
    "our current theory of supernovae predicts the shape and duration of sn1987a s neutrino pulse very well .",
    "hence , if some new channel transports too much energy from the interior of the supernova then the current understanding of sn1987a s neutrino signal gets invalidated .",
    "raffelt  @xcite has quantified the maximum possible emissivity for a new energy loss process which does nt conflict with our current understanding of the neutrino signal as @xmath5  ergs / g / s . using this criteria",
    "there have been several calculations  @xcite to obtain bounds on the size of the extra dimensions for a newly born proto - neutron star assuming that the interior of the star consists of nuclear matter at a temperature of @xmath11  mev .",
    "a more rigorous approach has been undertaken recently by hanhart _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite who performed detailed simulations of the effect of exotic radiation on the neutrino signal .",
    "although the star s inner core might well consist of nuclear matter , because of the extreme conditions seconds after core bounce with a density in some regions possibly up to @xmath12 times the nuclear matter density @xmath13 and a temperature of maybe up to @xmath14  mev , matter is near a phase transition to a deconfined qcd plasma .",
    "it is therefore important to investigate how bounds on the size of extra dimensions change if a scenario is considered where , in contrast to taking nucleons as the relevant degrees of freedom , the calculation is carried out using quarks and gluons as degrees of freedom .",
    "however , in the regime we are considering here matter is not in a state where the density and temperature are so high that a first order perturbative calculation would suffice ; it is rather in a regime where deconfinement just sets in and the qcd coupling constant is still large ( @xmath15 ) . for this reason we will carry out our calculations for a ( unphysical ) regime of very high density ( up to @xmath16 ) .",
    "there , the coupling is weak and perturbative calculations are feasible .",
    "from there we extrapolate down to get the emissivity in the physical region .",
    "note that if the temperature falls below a critical temperature @xmath17 of @xmath11  mev ( for a density of a few times nuclear density ) this very dense plasma most likely undergoes a phase - transition to a color superconducting phase ( for a recent review see  @xcite ) .",
    "since we do not consider such a scenario here , we assume the temperature to be above @xmath17 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ s : kk - loss ] we calculate the amplitude for the emission of soft gravi- and dilastrahlung into kk - modes from quark - quark ( qq ) scattering in a degenerate qcd plasma .",
    "this calculation is fairly general , it applies to soft radiation of kk - modes from light relativistic fermions .",
    "then , in section  [ s : quark - quark ] , we consider a simple model of the plasma consisting of three light quark flavors to estimate the size of the qq scattering cross sections . to treat the occurring divergences for colinear scattering",
    "we incorporate the effects of the surrounding plasma into the gluon propagator by introducing a cutoff mass .",
    "we do not consider any other many - body effects ; our goal is to obtain an estimate for the qq scattering cross section , an exact calculation is presently not feasible . in section  [ s : emissivity ] , we carry out the phase - space integration to get a formula for numerical calculation of the emissivity of a gas of weakly interacting quarks .",
    "we also provide an approximation formula for the degenerate limit .",
    "finally , in section  [ s : results ] , we calculate the emissivity and the bounds on the size of the @xmath0 extra dimensions for the case of @xmath9 and @xmath18 and compare them to the result from previous nuclear matter calculations .",
    "we assume the @xmath0 extra dimensions to form a @xmath0-torus with radius @xmath7 so that the kk - graviton and kk - dilation mode expansions are given by @xmath19 respectively .",

    "it is therefore worthwhile to investigate how the graviton emissivity and hence the bounds on extra dimensions change if one carries out the calculations in this regime .",
    "our intention here is to investigate graviton radiation into extra dimension from such a qcd plasma .",
    "the physics of a qcd plasma under such violent conditions is particularly rich .",
    "in addition to quarks of different flavors , a variety of other particles are present and being produced constantly , such as electrons , positrons , neutrinos , and collective excitations like plasmons .",
    "the properties of the quark - gluon plasma are far from being completely understood so that we do not even attempt to take the whole richness of matter under such extreme conditions into account here .",
    "instead , we assume a rather simply model for the plasma ( not unlike the one used in ref .",

    "more contributions come from graviton - production reactions like @xmath107 .",

    "note that the inclusion of any kk - modes generated by channels we neglect will only increase the emissivity and strengthen the bounds obtained below .",

    "of course , this is eventually a sign that matter under these conditions is at the phase transition to the qcd phase .",
    "therefore this regime is particularly difficult to treat because on the one hand nucleonic degrees of freedom are no longer the proper degrees of freedom while on the other hand perturbative qcd calculations are notoriously difficult .",

    "we also present the emission rates from nucleon - nucleon scattering  @xcite for lower densities .",
    "note that it is not sensible to compare the emission rates for quark matter and nuclear matter for an equal density , since for densities much higher than @xmath262 nucleons are certainly no longer the appropriate degrees of freedom .",

    "we have calculated emissivities and bounds on the size of gravity - only extra dimensions from a deconfined quark - gluon plasma in the core of a star seconds after the supernova core bounce .",
    "we have not considered the case where the temperature falls below the critical temperature @xmath17 defining the transition of quark matter to a color superconducting state .    by extrapolating the emissivity from a quark - gluon plasma at very high density ( @xmath267 ) down to the physically interesting region of @xmath268",
    "we find that the kk - graviton emissivity is comparable to those found from nuclear matter calculations .",
    "we have examined the error introduced into our calculation due to the fact that we are working only to first order in the qcd coupling constant .",
    "we estimate this error to be at the most 100% . to consider the rather uncertain value of the cutoff mass we have calculated the emissivity using a cutoff mass which varies about one order of magnitude about the central value from the lowest order perturbative calculation [ eq .",
    "( [ e : m_d ] ) ] .",
    "we find that this causes an uncertainty in the emissivity of about two orders of magnitude .",
    "we have not examined any other many - body effects which could modify the vacuum rates for kk - graviton emission , such as the landau - pomeranchuk - migdal effect , which would decrease the emissivity because of multiple quark scattering before the graviton gets emitted .",
    "note that the source of uncertainties is not the soft radiation theorem , which is well suited for the degenerate case , but rather our lack of knowledge about the nuclear physics nature of qcd .",
    "this deficit of understanding to only impacts our calculation of the quark - quark scattering cross section and the treatment of the qcd plasma , but also forces us to access the interesting transition region only with the aid of extrapolation .    despite the significant uncertainties in our calculation for quark matter",
    ", we believe to have ruled out the possibility of a significantly larger emissivity compared to the nuclear matter case .",
    "it is up to further investigation to provide better information on the conditions which govern the state of the matter at the star s core during and shortly after a supernova event .",
    "it is unlikely that the whole core will consist of dense quark matter , more likely is a scenario where at the core s center matter is deconfined and undergoes a phase transition to nuclear matter as one goes towards the surface .",
    "furthermore , a better understanding of qcd in the non - perturbative regime and at finite density would enable a reduction of the uncertainties .",
