    "the exclusive semi - leptonic decays @xmath19 , @xmath20 and radiative decays @xmath21 and hadronic two - body decays @xmath22 have been studied extensively @xcite , while the decays @xmath23 have been calculated with the qcd factorization approach @xcite , generalized factorization approach @xcite , etc .",
    "it is more easy to deal with the exclusive semi - leptonic precesses than the non - leptonic precesses , and there have been many works on the relevant form - factors @xmath24 , @xmath25 in determining the ckm matrix element @xmath26 @xcite .",

    "however , the light - cone distribution amplitudes of the @xmath5-meson are received relatively little attention comparing with the ones of the light pseudoscalar mesons and vector mesons , our knowledge about the nonperturbative parameters which determine those light - cone distribution amplitudes is limited and an additional application ( or estimation ) based on qcd is useful .    in this article",
