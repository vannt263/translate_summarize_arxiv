    "one of the most widely known classes of hysteresis models is the classical preisach model ( cpm ) and a rich variety of its close relatives .",
    "the main motivation behind our work was clear separation of reversible and irreversible components of isothermal , quasi static hysteresis loops . in cpm , the reversible part",
    "is represented by hysterons located on the edge of the preisach half - plane , i.e. on the line @xmath4 ( up- and down - switching fields equal to each other ) .",
    "all other physically valid hysterons , i.e. those with @xmath5 , are related to the irreversible magnetization processes . usually , the preisach distribution is interpreted in probabilistic terms .",
    "there is , however , a problem with credible characterization of the ( ferro)magnetic samples with diamagnetic components , like , for example the graphite foam @xcite , and  of course  superconductors .",
    "their preisach maps _ may _ go negative in the reversible part , thus such processes should be treated separately from the rest of the complete preisach distribution .",
    "disregarding this distinction leads frequently to puzzling results : the negative amplitudes appear in the preisach plane , even for ferromagnetic samples .",
    "findings like that have been signalled since at least ten years . until recently , they were usually attributed to    experimental uncertainties or inaccuracies introduced during the data processing . yet , even the forc diagrams introduced by pike @xcite , which are more or less equivalent to cpm , exhibit such a  feature quite often .",
    "moreover , the very existence of composite materials with negative remanence @xcite constitute the unquestionable experimental evidence , that the probabilistic interpretation of the preisach distribution is untenable .",
    "inspecting results , similar to those presented by pike and by other authors @xcite , we decided to try the following idea .",
    "we drastically reduce the support of the preisach distribution , @xmath6 ,  leaving for it only two lines : @xmath4 for reversible part , and @xmath7 , the mirror symmetry axis of the usual preisach distribution , for irreversible part .",
    "this way we can separate both kinds of magnetization processes . formally :    @xmath8    where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are real , single - valued functions of a single variable , and @xmath11 is dirac s delta .    in this respect",
    "our idea is similar to the one presented earlier in @xcite .",
    "the separate treatment for the reversible processes , using different arguments than ours , was pointed out in many papers , maybe most convincingly in @xcite .",
    "our calculations strictly follow the usual path of all the preisach - like models . for @xmath14 , the function @xmath15 is immediately identified as @xmath16 , with the derivative being taken along the ascending branch of the major hysteresis loop , while for @xmath17 we have to use the identity @xmath18 .",
    "the other function is again given by the derivative : + @xmath19 $ ] . here @xmath20 describes the descending branch of the major hysteresis loop , and @xmath21  its ascending branch .",
    "the experience shows , that sometimes @xmath22 happens to be negative on some interval , see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , near @xmath23  oe .",
    "this is , as a rule , accompanied by the presence of the similarly shaped , but positive , part of the function @xmath24 located at higher fields .",
    "to get rid of the ` unphysical ' parts of @xmath25 , we can apply the relation : @xmath26 where @xmath27 represents an ordinary preisach hysteron with @xmath28 and @xmath29 . from the above identity we can conclude ,",
    "that essentially it might be possible to repair the unphysical results , at the cost of restoration of the full preisach model .",
    "unfortunately , this can be done in infinitely many ways .",
    "accidentally , we have just shown , that * the preisach map obtained from major hysteresis loop alone is not unique*.",
    "first of all , our model is unique  by construction .",
    "secondly , it compares very favorably to others , when it comes to computational complexity , accuracy and experimental effort needed for data acquisition .",
    "we only use first derivatives of the original data , what introduces definitely less noise than other techniques relying on higher derivatives .",
    "the calculations are straightforward and do not include any iterative schemes . given perfect data , the procedure reproduces them exactly .",
    "there is no need to guess , or to assume , any particular shape of the anhysteretic part of the magnetization process first , as it is required in jiles - atherton model @xcite .",
    "the clearly visible drawback of our method is that the ( over?)-simplified preisach distribution can not be interpreted in usual terms , namely as a  probability distribution . as of today , we can not offer its precise alternative interpretation , in well defined , physical terms .",
    "the ability of our model to reproduce minor loops has not been tested yet .",
    "the simplified procedure , as being rather simple , fast and unique , may be regarded as a new , valuable tool of analysis of magnetic ( and maybe superconducting as well ) systems , including non - homogeneous ones , like those containing nanocrystals , multilayer structures , patterned media , etc .",
    "the results produced with this approach should probably be interpreted in the same spirit , as those obtainable from forc diagrams , that is , in the language of the statistics of the effective internal fields , including their signs , not just amplitudes .",
    "especially interesting is the shape of @xmath30 , sometimes exhibiting more than one - peak structure , thus clearly deviating from the usually assumed langevin s formula .",
    "we suspect its close relationships with internal field distributions , investigated numerically in @xcite , for systems with long - range , dipolar interactions .",
