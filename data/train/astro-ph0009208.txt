    "to characterize the metallicity and age of an old stellar system , iron abundance [ fe / h ]   ( the logarithm of the iron - to - hydrogen abundance ratio with respect to its solar value ) and the stellar effective temperature  must be determined together for its main - sequence turnoff ( msto ) stars .",
    "these are dwarfs and subgiants of types f and early g with @xmath0 .",
    "their spectra are dominated by fei  lines , whose strength increases as  declines . for both metallicity and age , then , a reliable derivation of  is necessary .",
    "this can be problematical even for an individual star .",
    "the photometric colors often used to derive  are sensitive to reddening by the interstellar medium and to the modeling of convection ( castelli , gratton , & kurucz 1997 ) , as is the more recently developed infrared flux method @xcite .",
    "methods using balmer - line profiles are reddening - independent but still very model - dependent @xcite .",
    "methods relying on the excitation equilibrium of fei  are reddening - independent and model - independent if lines are weak , but are susceptible to systematic errors in laboratory measurements of gf - values @xcite and to possible departures from local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "currently ,  values derived for individual msto stars show uncomfortably large spreads : values of @xcite and @xcite average 100  ",
    "200  lower than those found by @xcite and @xcite , with those of @xcite and @xcite in between . not only is overall metallicity affected , but also the ratios of the abundance with respect to iron of certain elements . among these",
    "are the  and  ratios so critical to uncovering the nucleosynthesis history of the early universe @xcite and deducing the age of globular clusters from the msto luminosity @xcite .",
    "when  alone is raised by 100 , modeled values of   change by + 0.09dex @xcite ;  changes by @xmath1dex , + 0.03dex , or + 0.16dex depending on whether the high - excitation oi  7775  triplet , the [ oi ] 6300  ground - state line , or oh molecular lines near 3100   are used @xcite . not surprisingly , the oxygen abundance in extremely metal - poor stars remains uncertain , as summarized during a workshop devoted to the problem @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , among others , have suggested that a higher  scale for metal - poor turnoff stars might eliminate the systematic differences in  seen from its different diagnostics .    for all these reasons , it seems important to reduce uncertainties in the determination of  in msto stars .",
    "fitting the slope of their uv flux distribution might help , since the fluxes of f ",
    "g stars peak in the optical so that uv fluxes vary rapidly with .",
    "although fitting a uv slope is also reddening - dependent , reddening should be very low for the brightest metal - poor msto stars , which are typically within 50pc ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "reliable calculations of msto mid - uv spectra would be especially valuable in constraining the age and metallicity of a spatially unresolved old stellar system such as an elliptical galaxy or extragalactic globular cluster .",
    "for the mid - uv flux of an old stellar population is dominated by turnoff stars @xcite , but the light redward of 4500  is dominated by cool giants in a 17  population of solar metallicity @xcite . to date , however , mid - uv studies of galaxies and globulars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have largely been empirical , comparing extragalactic spectra against observed spectra of individual f and g stars @xcite .",
    "thus the metallicity of the extragalactic systems has generally been assumed to be solar , although age is very sensitive to this assumption @xcite .",
    "furthermore , nonsolar abundance ratios have not been included , despite the fact that abundance enhancements of light elements such as magnesium are generally seen in metal - rich extragalactic systems @xcite .",
    "modeling the mid - uv region is difficult , though , because of the dramatic increase in line absorption at short wavelengths .",
    "line blending in the solar spectrum suppresses the optical continuum blueward of @xmath2 4500   @xcite , and becomes even more severe in the near- and mid - uv .",
    "especially in the uv , many lines are `` missing ''  although they appear as absorption features in spectra of solar - type stars , they lack laboratory identification , and are thus not matched by spectral synthesis calculations @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the normalization of the solar uv continuum is controversial @xcite .    with few exceptions ( e.g. , * ?",
    "* ) , calculations of the mid - uv region are based on kurucz model flux distributions .",
    "@xcite compared these to international ultraviolet explorer ( iue ) mid - uv spectra of nearby metal - poor halo stars , illustrating that  is generally recovered when parallaxes are known and reddening negligible .",
    "@xcite have used kurucz fluxes as generated by @xcite to examine the effect of abundance on the mid - uv light of old stellar populations , but found that the uv fluxes of cool stars were poorly reproduced .",
    "this is not surprising given the known limitations of the opacity distribution functions on which the kurucz flux distributions are based .",
    "they statistically treat lines in a list that includes `` predicted '' lines whose wavelengths are uncertain by @xmath210  ( because one or both energy levels have not been measured in the laboratory ) , limiting the resolution of the flux distributions to 10 .",
    "moreover , they assume a solar iron abundance @xmath20.15 dex higher than the value currently accepted @xcite , and a solar ratio of light - element abundances  = 0 .",
    "in contrast , metal - poor stars of the galactic halo typically show  = 0.3 @xcite , a factor - of - two enhancement in mg , si , ca , and ti .",
    "this affects the fit in the mid - uv , since it includes the very strong resonance doublet of mgii  at 2800   and a bound - free opacity edge of mgi  at 2512 , plus many",
    "weaker mg , si , and ti lines .",
    "in this work we calculate the mid - uv spectrum line - by - line at high resolution , independent of the kurucz flux distributions .",
    "our line list does not include predicted lines , but rather is based on an updated laboratory line list augmented by manual addition of missing lines where necessary . to ensure the reliability of these calculations , we match as best we can the individual line blends observed in the mid - uv echelle spectra of real near - turnoff stars , spanning a wide metallicity range and including both solar and enhanced light - element ratios .",
    "our purpose is to reproduce mid - uv spectra of turnoff stars accurately enough to determine  and to predict the composite mid - uv spectra of old stellar systems over their entire range of overall metallicity and light - element abundance ratio .    in this first step ,",
    "we describe this calibration procedure . because the calibrations depend significantly on the stellar temperatures adopted , we have carried out new  determinations in seven metal - poor turnoff stars and one mildly metal - poor hotter star .",
    "they are based on simultaneously matching both mid - uv spectra ( 2280  3120 ) and the  profile and the strengths of high - excitation atomic lines in optical spectra . we thus do not rely on any photometry or parallax information in the  determination .",
    "iron abundances and  ratios were adopted as derived from both weak and strong lines in the optical spectra . to assist in filling in the mid - uv line list ,",
    "we have included mid - uv analyses of two stars with mid - uv spectra of very high resolution , the sun and 128620 (= ) , a well - studied nearby southern star with a greater - than - solar metallicity @xcite , for which  was taken from the literature .    in fitting each mid - uv spectrum , we adopted a single continuum normalization constant , the scale factor by which the observed mid - uv spectral flux was multiplied to match the flux predicted by theoretical calculation .",
    "this constant proved to agree to an average of 6% @xmath3 5% with that expected from the ratio of stellar distance ( found from the parallax ) to stellar radius ( found from the model  assuming a reasonable stellar mass ) .",
    "model , , and   colors all agreed extremely well with those observed , confirming  errors of @xmath450 .",
    "our mid - uv and optical echelle spectra are described in  3 . as discussed in  4 ,",
    "was initially established from the optical spectra , and compared to the mid - uv fit .",
    "for the most metal - poor stars , this fit did not require the addition of missing lines , but did require the use of kurucz models in which convective overshoot was turned off , in contrast to the kurucz models in general use . to reproduce mid - uv line strengths and to match the pseudocontinuum of the mid - uv spectra of more metal - rich stars , mid - uv atomic line parameters were changed and missing lines were added .",
    "transitions especially sensitive to the surface temperature were still poorly reproduced ; this mismatch was reduced by adopting a mild enhancement of temperatures in shallow photospheric layers of the models of one - tenth solar metallicity and higher .    the degree",
    "to which the resulting calculations match both mid - uv and optical spectra of turnoff stars is shown and discussed in  5 .",
    "the match is very good for 2900  3120  at all metallicities , and generally good throughout the mid - uv for metallicities at and below one - third solar",
    ". it could be improved at solar metallicities by obtaining additional high - resolution mid - uv spectra of a few well - chosen standards .",
    "our  results are presented in  6 , where comparisons are made of model fluxes and colors with observations .",
    "we conclude in  7 with a summary and a discussion of the prospects for constraining age and metallicity of quiescent stellar systems by comparing such calculations to spectra of their integrated light .",
    "we begin by listing the properties of the stars considered in table 1 .",
    "the first five columns following the hd number give the observed @xmath5 magnitude , colors , and the parallax from simbad .",
    "the next five columns , discussed in  6 , show comparisons of observed properties of each star with those calculated from the models .",
    "the parameters of the model used to calculate both mid - uv and optical spectra of each star are given in the next four columns .",
    "in all cases but 128620 =  and the sun , all the model parameters were redetermined here as described below .",
    "the final columns show  values determined previously in several works .",
    "of the eight stars whose temperatures have been redetermined here from optical and uv spectra , seven are metal - poor main - sequence turnoff ( msto ) stars .",

    "for the one exception , 114762 , the blue spectrum was obtained in two one - hour exposures by tony misch at lick with the coude auxiliary telescope , using the same echelle spectrograph configuration .",
    "for the sun , the flux spectrum of @xcite was downloaded from the kurucz web site at http://cfaku5.harvard.edu ; the full - resolution version was matched at 150,000 resolution .",
    "the mid - uv spectral observations of the sun modeled here are the rocket spectra of @xcite , recorded on film .",
    "both passes of the center of the solar disk were used .",

    "the @xmath9 aperture was used and exposure times were 6  10min .",
    "consequently , s / n is lower , but flux levels are less dependent on pointing .",
    "fluxes good to 1% for these six stars are indicated by previous observations of mgii  line profiles in each star , made using the hst goddard high - resolution spectrograph ( ghrs ) and the @xmath10 aperture in program # 5869 @xcite .",
    "mid - uv spectra of the stars 128167 ( = hr5447 ) , from # 7433 , and 128620 (= hr5459 =) , from # 7263 @xcite , were recorded in multiple exposures with the e230h grating .",
    "spectral coverage is 2380  ",

    "similar uncertainties are anticipated for 106516 , where the @xmath12 aperture was also used .",
    "rotation is detected in at least two stars and possibly in two more , from the extra broadening required to match line profiles . for 128167 , 106516 , 84937 , and 114762 ,",
    "line breadths were matched in the spectral synthesis by adopting rotational velocities  = 9 , 7 , 5 , and 4  respectively .",
    "thus the resolution of the mid - uv spectrum of 128167 is effectively degraded to that of the stars observed at lower resolution , affecting the discernment of mid - uv lines .",
    "this star nonetheless has one of the sharpest - lined spectra among those obtained in program # 7433 .",
    "spectrum analysis was based on visually matching each observed spectrum to _ ab initio _ radiative - transfer calculations assuming static models in lte .",

    "the more metal - rich ones were modified by introducing enhanced temperatures in the shallow layers .",
    "the synthe program accepts as input both line lists and a model atmosphere with temperature and other quantities tabulated for each depth , and calculates an array of spectra at individual emergent angles .",
    "these may then be used individually ( as for spectra of the center of the solar disk ) or convolved with a zero or positive rotational velocity to generate an emergent flux spectrum . in either case",
    ", the resulting spectrum can be broadened by gaussians ( or other profile shapes ) to incorporate macroturbulence and instrumental broadening .",
    "synthe was modified to run under unix on a sun ultra-30 at the university of virginia .",
    "mid - uv spectra from 2280  to 3160  were calculated at a resolution of 330,000 ( 500,000 for the sun and 128620 ) , and optical spectra at a resolution of 500,000 .",
    "a gaussian macroturbulent broadening of 1.5  was assumed for all stars as well as for the sun .",
    "spectra for some stars were rotationally broadened as listed in the last paragraph of  3 , as was the solar flux spectrum , for which a mean rotational velocity of 2  was adopted .",
    "the spectra were then broadened by gaussians corresponding to the values of instrumental resolution listed individually in  3 .    the line lists and the source code of the opacity routines available at the kurucz web site",
    "give specifics on the wide variety of opacity sources treated by synthe .",
    "for example , the significant absorption by the bound - free absorption edge of mgi  near 2512  is treated both as line opacity , with the line list including the bound - bound transitions to @xmath14 , and as continuous opacity blueward of the bound - free edge at @xmath15 = 39759.8 @xmath16 , by the subroutine mg1op .",
    "near @xmath15 , this routine adopts a cross section of 40 mbarn with a @xmath17 frequency dependence , based on the laboratory measurement of 46 @xmath3 12 mbarn by @xcite and the convergence of high - level lines .",
    "where this formalism falls below the theoretical cross section , the program adopts the latter , with a cross section of 20 mbarn and a @xmath18 frequency dependence ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    for calculations redward of 5000 ,",
    "the line list of @xcite based on the solar spectrum was adopted , with modifications due to the use here of a flux , rather than central intensity , spectrum for the sun and to the incorporation of an approximate chromosphere in the solar model .",
    "this led to the deduction of larger gf - values for the strongest lines except where laboratory gf - values were adopted , as for low - excitation fei  lines with furnace measurements @xcite .",
    "blueward of 5000 , the kurucz 25 may 1998 atomic line lists _",
    "gf_0300.100 , _",
    "gf_0400.100 , and _ gf_00500.100 were used .",
    "these differ significantly from those used in the kurucz flux distribution calculations in including only atomic lines identified in the laboratory ( with laboratory gf - values where available )  like those of @xcite but with the addition of many lines of fei , feii , and other species whose upper energy levels were newly determined in near - uv laboratory spectra ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . because the strengths or profiles of many lines were mismatched when using line parameters directly from this list , their gf - values and damping constants were changed where necessary , as described shortly .",
    "since many lines appear in the stis mid - uv spectra that were not modeled by lines in the list , such missing lines were added blueward of 3120 .",
    "redward of this , no missing lines were added , but gf - values were changed to match stronger lines in the sun in the regions depicted in fig .",
    "4 below .",
    "the , , [ fe / h ] , , and  values for each reanalyzed star were initially established from  and weak lines of neutral species in the optical spectra , reassessed from optical lines of once - ionized species , then confirmed or revised from the uv . for the two most metal - poor stars",
    ", mid - uv spectra provided an immediate check on .",
    "for the others , the following steps were iterated until all diagnostics converged .",
    "first the  profile and an assumed  were used to estimate .",
    "[ fe / h ]  was adjusted until weak fei  lines in the 5100  ",
    "5400  region were well matched ; their strengths are largely gravity - independent . the strength of weak tii , mgi , and sii  lines determined .",
    "microturbulent velocity  was set by matching weak and strong iron and titanium lines .",
    "gravity  was then checked by demanding matches for mgi , mgii , and the wings of the  lines , for fei  and feii , for tii  and tiii , and for sii   and siii .",
    "this also constrains , for the mgii  and siii  doublets arise from highly excited lower levels ( @xmath78ev ) , while the optical tiii  and feii   lines originate from much lower levels ( @xmath113ev ) .",
    "roughly two dozen fei   lines , a dozen tii  lines , and a dozen total tiii  and feii  lines were detected for the most metal - poor stars , with double this number typical of the more metal - rich stars .",
    "the mgii  and siii  doublets at 4481  and at 6347.1 and 6371.3  were seen in all cases , but siii  only marginally so in 84937 and 19445 .",
    "once the diagnostics began to converge , iterative adjustments were made to the kurucz mid - uv atomic - line parameters .",
    "first , gf - values were modified for atomic lines identified in the laboratory .",
    "the relative contribution of identified lines to a blend was ascertained from the behavior of the blend in the hot star 128167 versus the cooler ones , and in the higher - gravity stars such as 19445 versus the lower - gravity ones .",
    "damping constants were changed in some cases to match line profiles .",
    "damping constants rather than gf - values were changed for the strong resonance lines well - observed in the interstellar medium for which gf - values are tabulated by @xcite .",
    "next , for lines lacking identification , the laboratory line list was searched for transitions close enough in wavelength to perhaps be responsible .",
    "the gf - value of a nearby identified line was increased by up to 4.5 in the log , and the calculation repeated .",
    "this line was dropped if still not strong enough ; otherwise its gf - value was adjusted to match .",
    "the high resolution of the  and solar spectra showed that most such identifications were very well matched in wavelength , and thus likely to be correct , when based on increases of @xmath19 2.5 in the log .",
    "for the two most metal - poor stars , these steps were sufficient to enable the continuum to be defined unambiguously throughout most of the mid - uv region .",
    "its definition in more metal - rich stars was hampered by line crowding , yielding a pseudocontinuum that the modeling did not properly reproduce .",
    "much of this pseudocontinuum mismatch appeared to be due to individual transitions missing from the line list .",
    "this was indicated by the very common occurrence throughout the mid - uv of unmodeled absorption features found at the same wavelengths in all stars , features whose strength steadily increased in going from weak - lined to strong - lined spectra .",
    "most of these transitions are weak , consistent with the fact that the intrinsically strongest transitions of each species are the ones most likely to have been detected in the laboratory .    except just redward of the mgi  edge at 2512 ,",
    "most missing lines are probably due to iron .",
    "its abundance is high and the spectra are rich in lines of fei  and feii , which are well - populated species in solar - temperature stars . of the elements with similar first ionization potentials , only magnesium and silicon have comparable abundances ; the mid - uv spectra of their low - ionization stages",
    "are generally much less complex , as are those of the more abundant cno elements . while iron - peak elements such as cr , mn , and ni have many transitions throughout the mid - uv , iron dominates because it is twenty or more times as abundant . in most halo stars above one - tenth solar metallicity , the relative abundances of these elements with respect to iron are within 0.2 dex of those of the sun .",
    "the mismatch that will result from assigning missing lines of these elements to iron should be mild .    in the region",
    "immediately redward of the bound - free mgi  opacity edge at 2512 , the probability is significant that missing lines may be due to magnesium rather than iron .",
    "redward of the edge there are a very large number of transitions to known highly excited levels of the mgi  atom , and presumably a very large number of similar transitions to closely - spaced highly excited levels that are as yet unidentified in the laboratory . if many weak transitions redward of 2512  are due to magnesium but have been assigned to iron instead , our calculations will underestimate the absorption in this region in metal - rich alpha - enhanced populations .",
    "we see below that this region is poorly modeled in any case once metallicity exceeds one - tenth solar .",
    "the modeling then proceeded iteratively by assigning tentative identifications and transition probabilities to each missing feature , then recalculating until an acceptable match was achieved or deemed unattainable with existing data ( as for the regions just redward of 2550  and 2640  in the solar spectrum ) .",
    "features were attributed to either low - excitation fei , moderate - excitation fei , or feii , whose line strengths depend differently on stellar temperature and gravity ( pressure ) because of the boltzmann and saha equations . with a  @xmath21000  higher than those of other moderately weak - lined stars , 128167 proved exceptionally useful in making these assignments .",
    "the higher resolution of the spectra of the strong - lined stars 128620 =   and the sun was essential in discerning the wavelengths of the many features emerging above one - third solar metallicity .",
    "a brief examination was made of the gf - value changes for low - excitation fei   lines , namely those identified in the laboratory with ( air ) wavelengths falling between 2600  and 3000 , and with a lower level of 6000 ",
    "10000   and an upper level of 40000  50000 .",
    "sixty - five such fei  lines have gf- values from the laboratory measurements of @xcite ; 52 were not changed , while 13 were changed by from @xmath20 to @xmath21 dex .",
    "nine lines have gf - values from the laboratory measurements of @xcite ; five were unchanged , and four changed by from @xmath22 to @xmath23dex .",
    "thus the mid - uv gf - values found in this work generally concur with the mid - uv laboratory measurements .",
    "in contrast , fifteen lines have theoretical gf - values from @xcite ; four were not changed , but 11 were changed by from @xmath24 to @xmath25dex , all but one decreased .",
    "the theoretical gf - values of @xcite are seen to be subject occasionally to very large errors , usually overestimates .",
    "this can be attributed to the finite size of the cray computer used in those calculations , which dictated that the number of levels included be truncated , and so upper levels were preferentially omitted from the model atom . because the sum of the gf - values of transitions arising from a given lower state is normalized to unity",
    ", gf - values for the transitions included in the calculation will be overestimated because of the exclusion of others arising from the same level . thus the calculations will overestimate the gf - value by increasing amounts as the fraction decreases of the actual possible upper states that are included in the atomic model .",
    "this fraction decreases to the blue , because higher upper levels are involved for a given lower level .",
    "indeed , the severity of overestimates appears to increase to the blue : all the above changes made to the @xcite gf - values were @xmath26 or lower below 2650 , but redward of this only one change this negative was required .",
    "the overestimates among the @xcite fei  gf - value calculations are thus seen to be due to incompleteness and not to more fundamental difficulties .",
    "undoubtedly many of the weaker mid - uv transitions are missing entirely from the predicted list .    for the hydrides ,",
    "separate treatment was required , as the lines are naturally associated into bands , and the kurucz hydride calculations are now several decades old . for oh , the theoretical calculations of @xcite ( communicated in august 2000 by m. bessell ) were used wherever possible . for ch , the lifbase data ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ) were used ( communicated in august 2000 by m. bessell with lines cross - identified ) . since these cover only the strongest bands",
    ", calculations must still rely on the kurucz values for the others , notably the 4 - 3 band of oh with many weak but discernible lines in the sun .",
    "a comparison of the kurucz oh transition probabilities against those of @xcite showed strong trends , with discrepancies increasing at high rotation number j. to place them on approximately the same scale , the kurucz transition probabilities for the oh and ch lines were decreased by an amount @xmath27 = @xmath28dex .",
    "once missing atomic lines were largely filled in , a comparison was feasible of calculated oh and ch line strengths against those of the sun and stars .",
    "because solar oh lines were otherwise modeled too strong , all the transition probabilities were reduced by an additional 0.15 dex uniformly . in part because weak oh lines in the sun were reasonably well modeled but strong ones were still too strong , a chromospheric mitigation of the surface temperature drop was invoked as described shortly . as illustrated below in figs .",
    "3@xmath29 and @xmath30 , these changes suffice to reproduce both strong and weak 0 - 0 oh features in stars as well as the sun .",
    "the calculations were first run using @xcite models , but the very metal- poor stars showed a  deduced from  as much as 200  higher than that from fitting the mid - uv .",
    "that discrepancy was removed by adopting @xcite models , models in which convective overshoot has been turned off .",
    "we did not use the alpha - enhanced @xcite models , as they are available for only a single value of the alpha - element abundance enhancement .    like the @xcite models",
    ", the @xcite models we used were calculated with  = 2  and a logarithmic solar iron abundance of @xmath31 with respect to the abundance by number of hydrogen plus helium , which amounts to @xmath32 with respect to hydrogen alone .",
    "these choices are about 1  higher in  than the @xmath21  typically found for the solar flux spectrum , and about 0.15dex higher in iron abundance than indicated by the meteoric iron abundance and by several recent determinations for the sun ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus both sets of models were calculated with higher line blanketing than expected for a solar - type star of the nominal model metallicity , since iron lines dominate the uv and optical spectrum , and the higher  increases the strengths of moderately strong lines of every species .",
    "for each star including the sun , a @xcite model was interpolated to the nearest 50  in  ( 25  for the sun ) , 0.1dex in , and 0.05dex in [ fe / h ] .",
    "the microturbulent velocity  was changed at all depths to the value indicated for each star in the table and figures below . to minimize the overblanketing effect , our models were interpolated to a nominal grid abundance 0.10  0.15dex lower than that desired . to set abundances ,",
    "the abundance of the interpolated model was then raised to the desired value and the relative abundance of iron dropped by 0.15 dex .",
    "the specific light - element abundance elevations required by the optical observation were adopted , or assumed to be zero for the sun and , and all species equilibria were recalculated .",
    "this procedure incorporates the specific  and iron and light - element abundances set for the model in calculating both the ionization and molecular equilibria and the line and continuous opacities for its spectrum .",
    "concerning the model structure , the procedure compensates for the effects of overblanketing due to the high choice of iron abundance , but not for the light - element ratio nor for the microturbulence .",
    "we anticipate very mild errors in model colors and temperature structure until spectra become dominated by molecular lines or otherwise are considerably stronger - lined than any of these .",
    "the comparison of model and observed colors (  6 ) bears out this expectation .",
    "for the sun , a model with  = 5775 ,  = 4.4 , [ fe / h ]  = 0 ,  = 0 , and  = 1.0 , was interpolated in the above way . for",
    "128620 =  we adopted a similarly interpolated model with  = 5800 ,  = 4.3 , [ fe / h ]  = + 0.15dex ,  = 0 ,  = 1.0 .",
    "while @xcite found  = 5830  and [ fe / h ]  = 0.25dex , most other analyses have derived somewhat lower  and [ fe / h ]  values . at  = 5800  and  = 1.0",
    ", [ fe / h ]  = 0.15dex provides a better match to the mid - uv spectrum of .    even with the use of @xcite models interpolated as above , another major type of mismatch persisted in all strong - lined stars : cores of lines formed near the surface appeared too strong in the calculations , especially in extremely strong mid - uv lines such as those of mgii  and mgi  or feii  and fei .",
    "this is definitely not due to wayward gf - values or damping constants , because of the trend seen in the mismatch .",
    "profiles calculated for the strongest lines in the most metal - poor spectra generally matched or were somewhat too high in the core , but were somewhat too low in the core in stars of intermediate line strength , and became too low across the the central ten ngstroms or more in the strongest - lined stars .",
    "( see fig .",
    "3@xmath33 below for residual trends of this nature . )",
    "as noted above , a related mismatch was seen within the oh spectrum itself : in any given strong - lined spectrum , notably that of the sun for which the model parameters are extremely well known , weak oh lines were matched at a higher oxygen abundance than strong lines .",
    "the possibility discussed in  5 that the solar continuum may be drawn too low would lead to a mismatch of opposite sign . to the extent that the gf - values are reliable",
    ", then , this indicates an error in the temperature structure of the model .",
    "the most obvious possibility is a chromosphere , which is not incorporated in flux - constant , static models such as those of synthe .",
    "the solar chromosphere , for example , is seen in images of the limb and evident from emission reversals in the cores of strong spectral lines such as mgii .",
    "it is generally modeled by an increase in temperature in relatively shallow layers of the atmosphere ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . any of several non - radiative heating sources extending from the photosphere through the chromosphere into the corona could be responsible ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we consequently changed the temperature of individual points in each interpolated stellar model with [ fe / h ]  @xmath34 , beginning just below the point where the model becomes optically thin at 5000  ( typically at depth number 51 or 52 ) .",
    "( we tried this for the more metal - poor models as well , but the profiles of all the strong lines became much too high near the core , so we left these models as they were . )",
    "to best fit both optical and mid - uv spectra simultaneously , we increased the temperature at model depths 28 through 48 by 10 , 20 , 30 , 40 , 50 , 60 , 70 , 80 , 90 , 100 , 110 , 120 , 130 , 140 , 150 , 150 , 140 , 120 , 90 , 60 , and 30  respectively .",
    "this temperature enhancement may be considered an approximate chromosphere , though it is based entirely on empirical fits of one - dimensional spectral line calculations to observed spectral line profiles .",
    "it incorporates neither energy transport considerations nor matches to spatially resolved structures , both of which lie beyond the scope of this work .",
    "the degree to which our mid - uv and optical spectral calculations match spectra of real stars is illustrated in the figures .",
    "the first three show mid - uv spectra , and the last , optical . within a figure ,",
    "panels are ordered by wavelength .",
    "flux ( central intensity for the solar mid - uv spectrum ) is plotted versus wavelength in air . the spectrum calculated for each star ( light line )",
    "is plotted on top of that observed ( heavy line ) .    in figure 1 , the global mid - uv fit is shown for the nine stars with absolute fluxes .",
    "all spectra have been gaussian smoothed to a fwhm resolution of 500 ( 550 for 128127 and ) .",
    "each spectrum is displaced vertically by @xmath220% from the one below . for each star a single mid - uv continuum normalization constant",
    "was adopted , as listed on the left . on the right",

    "( the latter four are grouped together wherever they are the same . )",
    "while the fits are generally good , serious discrepancies are noted in  at the bottom of the figure near 2550  2600  and 2640  2710 , regions of relatively little line absorption in the more metal - poor spectra .",
    "figure 2 illustrates the effect on mid - uv fits when model parameters are changed somewhat .",
    "two of the stars of fig .",
    "1 are depicted : the moderately weak - lined 94028 ( top two spectra ) and the rather strong - lined 184499 ( bottom three ) . star and model identifications and normalization constants are indicated as in figure 1 . the lower plot for each star represents its best fit , a replot of that star s comparison in figure 1 .    comparing the bottom plot to the middle plot shows the effect for 184499 of decreasing  by 0.3dex to the solar  ratio .",
    "although minimized by the adoption of a normalization constant 11% higher , the mismatch is still evident .",
    "the strengths of the wings of the strong mgii  doublet at 2800  ( and of mgi  at 2852 ) are poorly reproduced , as is the overall pseudocontinuum level near and below the bound - free edge of mgi  at 2512 .",
    "similar calculations run for 94028 show a more dramatic effect in the mgii  and mgi  line wings , which are weak enough that little renormalization is possible , but a smaller effect near 2512 , where the h@xmath36 opacity is dominant because of the reduced magnesium abundance .    comparing the plot just above the best fit for each star to the best fit",
    "itself shows the degeneracy of the mid - uv spectra with respect to a simultaneous change in ,  and [ fe / h ]  designed to preserve overall line strength and ionization equilibrium . for each plot just above the best fit ,",
    "was decreased by 100 , [ fe / h ]  and  both concurrently decreased by 0.1dex , and the spectrum renormalized accordingly .",
    "this change is very difficult to detect from fitting the mid - uv slope alone at these metallicities and this resolution .",
    "the increased metallicity reduces the blue pseudocontinuum relative to the red at the same time that the increased   raises it .",
    "the change is marginally detectable in 94028 from the mismatch of low - opacity windows , but not in 184499 because the overall match is less satisfactory .",
    "such a change does lead to a reduction in the normalization parameter , by 11% for 94028 and 17% for 184499 . in principle",
    "this might be detected by other means , but only if  is properly modeled . for as seen above , taking  = 0 ( as in the kurucz flux distributions ) can largely compensate in stars such as 184499 that show a light - element enhancement .",
    "our conclusion , then , is that if the mid - uv normalization constant is treated as a completely free parameter ( as here ) , the mid - uv flux distribution by itself can currently be used to set  only in msto stars with [ fe / h ]  @xmath37 .",
    "while the mid - uv was useful in demonstrating the need for models with no convective overshoot and with an approximate chromosphere , our determinations of  for the more metal - rich msto stars have relied on the optical spectra instead .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "4 below that the balmer line profiles and the strengths of other high - excitation lines are well matched in the optical spectra of all stars at the same  as the best - fit mid - uv spectrum , and in  5 that model colors match observations as well , so that  is indeed very well established here .",
    "however , our goal of  determination for turnoff stars of all metallicities from mid - uv spectra alone is not yet met .",
    "we are not able to calculate the low - opacity windows blueward of 2900  accurately enough at near - solar metallicity , as we now demonstrate .",

    "no `` missing '' lines are strong enough to merit explicit identification at the top of the figure .",
    "true continuum is reached in each spectrum , but fleetingly , near 3102.5 ; its placement is sensitive to the treatment of adjacent weak lines .",
    "an unblended 0 - 0 oh line appears at 3101.230 , next to a near- continuum high point ; both are modeled well in all spectra .",
    "the strong atomic lines are well reproduced , as are two moderately strong ch lines at 3100.120 and 3100.170 .",
    "3@xmath29 offers a further picture of how well both continuum and oh features are modeled .",
    "another continuum window appears near 3084.7 , but again with a weak line superimposed in the solar and  spectra . the relatively unblended oh 0 - 0 band line at 3084.896 , used in several oxygen - abundance investigations , is well reproduced over the factor - of-100 metallicity range of the stars in whose spectra it is detected , including the sun itself .",
    "nearby at 3085.2  is a blend dominated by a stronger 0 - 0 oh line ; it too is reasonably well matched in all stars .",
    "recall that to achieve this agreement , the @xcite theoretical gf - values for oh were reduced by @xmath40dex ; otherwise these features and that of fig .  2@xmath30 , plus the overwhelming majority of other oh lines , would be too strong in the sun . that is , unless the solar continuum were raised .",
    "the solar continuum appears to be well defined , and the oh lines of all bands matched to @xmath20.1dex , throughout the 3000  3100  region .",
    "because there are so few continuum windows , however , we can not rule out a systematic underestimate of the continuum in  and the sun of perhaps 5% or 10% . roughly speaking , raising the  mid - uv continuum",
    "would allow it to be modeled at an [ fe / h ]  value more consistent with that of @xcite , while raising the solar continuum might eliminate the present need to reduce the theoretical oh gf - values by 0.15dex . as noted at the end of  6",
    ", it would also bring the mid - uv normalization constants of the sun and  closer to their expected values . a definite answer",
    "could be obtained by deriving the stellar parameters of  from an optical spectrum in the same way as for the other stars , and from modeling an improved spectrum of the solar near - uv .",

    "3@xmath39 that of 128167 may also be too low .",
    "such variations might also be present in the 128620 =  spectrum as well , but remain undetected because of the difficulty of matching its multitude of lines .",

    "the number of missing lines added remains small , and agreement is nearly as good .",
    "oh lines are less important , being generally minor constituents of blends .",
    "however , windows of true continuum have disappeared from the solar and  spectra , and are fleeting at best in the echelle spectra of lower resolution that were acquired for mildly metal - poor stars .",
    "continuum placement depends not so much on oh features but rather on whether all missing lines have been spotted .",
    "clearly that is not the case at solar metallicity , where weak missing lines apparently overlap to the extent that they can not be distinguished as individuals . although the cumulative effect of their neglect on the total absorption is small , is it significant for the continuum placement , which consequently can not be determined as well as was the case above from fits such as this .",

    ", the high - resolution spectra of the  and the sun reveal that too few missing lines have been added , often too strong and in the wrong places . for the adjacent region from 2645 to 2700 , the sheer number of missing lines precluded their reliable identification at the low resolution of the low - metallicity stellar spectra . because many were simply omitted , the calculations overestimate the spectral flux in that region  mildly in moderately metal - poor stars but seriously at and above solar metallicity , according to fig .  1 .    from fig .  3@xmath33",
    ", it is clear that these difficulties are reduced in regions dominated by strong atomic lines . there",
    "the fit is dictated more by the ability of the calculations to match the cores and the damping wings of strong lines , and not by modeling the weak or missing features .",
    "these are largely suppressed : although the region shown is blueward of that of panel @xmath38 , only one missing line is noted in it . the wings of the strong lines are reproduced well in the four top spectra but begin to be somewhat too broad near the core in 106516 and 201891 .",
    "the entire @xmath31  about the core is too deep in   and the sun .",
    "this could perhaps be remedied by continuing the temperature enhancement to shallower surface layers than those indicated in  4 .",

    "the  profile is relatively insensitive to gravity in this case : calculations adopting a model that differed from the best - fit model only in having  0.2dex larger produced a profile that deviated only near 6560  and 6565 , by about the thickness of the heavy line . similar calculations showed no sensitivity of the  profile to the chromospheric elevation of temperature , nor to changes of 0.3dex in iron abundance or light - element ratio .",

    "it would be valuable to do so given the constraints this would offer on alternative measurements of the fundamental properties of these standard stars , for example parallaxes from hipparcos and other space missions . however , the following comparisons of observed and model fluxes indicate that the  values are good to @xmath30.1dex as they stand .",
    "we first compare the uv normalization constant with that expected . according to @xcite ,",
    "the ratio of observed to emitted stellar flux is @xmath46 , where the angular diameter @xmath47 = 2@xmath48/@xmath49 , @xmath48 being the stellar radius and @xmath49 its distance . for each star",
    "we calculate @xmath50 in solar units as @xmath51 , assuming masses @xmath52 = 0.8  for for the metal - poor stars based on stellar isochrones @xcite and 1.15  for 128167 , and adopting 1.16  for  as derived from its orbit by @xcite .",
    "the distance in solar units is found from the parallax , and the theoretical flux normalization constant follows from @xmath53 times 4.2545 @xmath54 to convert to square steradians .",
    "the ratio of this theoretical constant to that actually used to scale the observations in figs .  1 and 3 is listed in column 7 of table 1 .",

    "indeed , @xcite saw this in their 1995 mid - uv  hst observations with ghrs : relative to earlier ghrs and iue observations of , `` our fluxes are lower ( by factors of 5.6 and 4.8 for the mgii  and feii  spectra , respectively ) , presumably because of the star s being misplaced at the edge of the small aperture . '' from a visual comparison with fig .  1 of @xcite , the fluxes we are using for the @xcite stis  spectrum should be raised by a factor of 2.1 .",
    "this brings the  ratio to 0.96 , and results in an average of the nine stellar ratios of 1.06 @xmath3 0.05 , with an individual standard deviation of 0.15 . for the sun ,",

    "these  and solar ratios would be closer to unity were the continuum levels for their spectra drawn higher by 5%  10% , a possibility raised in  5 .",
    "as matters stand , errors in continuous opacity are limited to @xmath1110% nonetheless .    the apparent @xmath5 magnitude",
    "may also be compared to that expected from the model . from the @xmath5 magnitudes tabulated with the model colors , we calculated the difference in the stellar model @xmath5 with respect to the solar model , added this and @xmath55 to the observed solar @xmath5 = @xmath56 , then subtracted this from the observed stellar @xmath5 magnitude .",

    "the resulting calculations provide a good fit for turnoff stars of all metallicities redward of 2900 .",
    "previous discrepancies in fitting the solar pseudocontinuum ( noted in  1 ) are attributed not to missing continuous opacity , which is good to @xmath1110% near 3100 , but rather to missing or miscalculated line opacity .    to improve the accuracy of the mid - uv gf - values , damping constants , and line identifications derived here , we have determined temperatures , gravities , microturbulence , and abundances for eight stars by calculating fits to optical as well as uv spectra . for stars more metal - poor than one - thirtieth solar ,",
    "the fit to the mid - uv spectrum was satisfactory using laboratory lines alone , and can by itself determine . for the more metal - rich stars , lines missing from the laboratory list compromise the goodness of fit of the mid - uv spectrum . a 100  increase in  is seen to be difficult to detect from mid - uv spectra alone , as long as [ fe / h ]  and  are increased by 0.1dex to compensate .",
    "this -[fe / h ]  degeneracy parallels the age - metallicity degeneracy in elliptical galaxies @xcite . as with galaxies , it is reduced here by considering the balmer lines , with the advantage that stellar models need not include balmer - line emission nor composite populations . here  was set for stars with [ fe / h ]  @xmath57 by matching the  line profile and the strengths of other high - excitation features .    for all the metal - poor stars ,",
    "the excellent match between calculations and observations of both optical and mid - uv spectra , and between model and observed colors , indicates an uncertainty of @xmath350  in an individual   determination , and a similar uncertainty in the  scale .",
    "moreover , the stellar @xmath5 magnitudes generally agree to 0.1mag , and the mid - uv normalization constants to 10% , with those expected from the stellar angular diameter found from the observed parallax and the model , assuming reasonable masses .    in this process",
    ", it was found that these optical diagnostics and the slope of the mid - uv continuum could only be fit simultaneously when using models of @xcite in which convective overshoot has been turned off .",
    "our work thus agrees with that of @xcite , who found that their models better reproduce the balmer profiles in the sun than do those of @xcite . downloading the @xcite models from the kurucz web site at http://cfaku5.harvard.edu",
    "is recommended for all work where the results depend upon the temperature structure in deep continuum - forming regions .",
    "residual discrepancies in fitting the profiles of very strong atomic lines , and the strengths of strong versus weak solar oh lines in the 3000  3100   region , are reduced here by mimicking a chromosphere towards the surface of every model with [ fe / h ]  @xmath58 @xmath59 .",
    "as described at the end of  4 , the model temperature was raised in the region just above the depths where optical continuum and weak lines are formed . while this procedure was necessary to match strong - line cores and oh line strengths over a very broad range of metallicity with a single set of gf - values , it is definitely an oversimplification .",
    "energy and stability considerations remain to be examined .",
    "fits might be improved with a different choice of temperature enhancement .",
    "indeed , a two - stream model might be found necessary . in the meantime",
    ", line cores also will be subject to uncertainties due to the presence of chromospheric emission .",
    "@xcite demonstrate that mgii  emission is always present in solar - temperature stars , with a strength that increases with increasing metallicity .",
    "emission also increases with increasing stellar activity @xcite . since activity in turn",
    "is associated with rapid rotation , stronger mgii  emission appears commonly among young stars and close binaries .",
    "consequently , no single quiescent chromosphere appears capable of modeling the very core of the profile of a strong line in all turnoff stars .",
    "the reliability of our  values and the good match achieved for oh lines enable a second look at the oxygen abundances of metal - poor stars , which are still uncertain as noted in  1 .",
    "our values for  are intermediate , suggesting that  is not the sole cause of the oxygen discrepancies .",
    "we defer a more detailed discussion to a future paper by @xcite , who compare oxygen abundances derived from the oh lines with those from the permitted and forbidden lines of atomic oi  in these stars .",
    "the manual addition of lines to the model line list , to match otherwise missing features seen in the observed spectrum , is clearly necessary for even an approximate representation of the mid - uv spectrum of solar - temperature stars of one - tenth solar metallicity and higher .",
    "nonetheless the procedure has its important limitations .",
    "one is that as overall line strength increases , the proportion of missing lines goes up dramatically ; disentangling them requires a broader range of spectra of high quality , as discussed below .",
    "another is that the excitation or ionization of the transition could be misjudged ; the ramifications are discussed in the next paragraph .",
    "a third is that many missing lines may not be due to iron as assumed , but to other elements .",
    "as discussed in  4 , this is potentially serious redward of the bound - free absorption edge of mgi  near 2512 . elsewhere",
    "the effect should be minimal , because although other iron - peak elements contribute significant line absorption throughout the mid - uv , the relative abundances of all other iron - peak elements with respect to iron change little from one late f or early g main - sequence star to another in both halo and disk populations in our galaxy . to be sure ,",
    "the list generated by this procedure can not be expected to reproduce the spectrum of a peculiar a or f star , for example a cr - enhanced star , in which the iron - peak ratio has been dramatically altered @xcite .    more generally , the list is not suitable for modeling stars whose parameters lie well outside the range of those analyzed here . in such cases ,",
    "any difference becomes important between the assigned and the actual excitation ( and ionization ) potential of the transition responsible for a line , leading to a significant misrepresentation of its strength .",
    "consequently , the present list can not be expected to reproduce the spectra of stars hotter than early f nor cooler than early g , nor giants , as well as stars of metallicity substantially higher than solar for which lines are still missing .",
    "the list could be made suitable for those stellar types by extending the present analysis to include such stars , provided high - resolution , high s / n mid - uv spectra are available in which mismatches induced by errors in the list can be visually identified and corrected .",
    "we discuss this further below .",
    "conversely , the list as it stands should do as well as indicated by fig .  1 and fig .",
    "3 in reproducing the mid - uv spectra of any other late f or early g star of solar metallicity or less , provided a suitable model atmosphere is chosen .",
    "this holds because once the gf - value and damping constant of a line transition are set , elemental abundance and the boltzmann and saha equilibria at each point in the atmosphere fully determine line strength in quiescent stars such as these .",
    "dynamical effects can be ignored , and non - equilibrium effects ( if any ) are slowly - varying functions of spectral type , hence absorbed into the gf - value determinations .",
    "the only exception is the chromospheric emission noted above .",
    "were the line list improved to the point that a reliable match is achieved to the mid - uv spectra of f and g stars of solar metallicity and above , we could expect to use the mid - uv slope to at least constrain age and metallicity , regardless of its overall level or the appropriate light - element abundance ratio , as these could be incorporated in a grid of calculations covering the entire relevant parameter space .",
    "spectral indexes offer an alternative means by which mid - uv spectral calculations alone might constrain metallicity and  of a star or age of a stellar system .",
    "the principle is to construct indexes based on spectral regions dominated by features whose behavior breaks the age / metallicity degeneracy and elucidates the alpha enhancement , examples of which are the balmer lines and ratios of fei / feii  and mgi / mgii  line strengths .",
    "spectral indexes have indeed been used as diagnostics of age and metallicity in ellipticals by several of the groups mentioned in  1 .",
    "for example , @xcite have compared mid - uv and optical line indexes they calculated from kurucz flux distributions against mean values observed for the stars considered by @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , poor agreement was seen for all but two mid - uv indexes , the slope of the pseudocontinuum between 2600  and 3100 , and blended absorption near 2538 .",
    "we should be able to improve upon some of those index calculations immediately .",
    "as figs .",
    "1 and 3 illustrate , the current spectral calculations should be reasonably reliable at all metallicities in spectral regions redward of 2900 , and for those dominated by strong lines blueward of that .",
    "this includes several indexes already in use , notably the mgii  and mgi  lines at 2800  and 2852  and line blends in the 3000 +  region .",
    "we plan to begin such index calculations shortly , and make them generally available .",
    "blueward of 2900 , however , our calculations are not yet reliable enough .",
    "1 shows that our calculated spectra of solar - metallicity stars substantially overestimate the true fluxes in those wavelength regions not dominated by strong lines .",
    "somewhat ironically , our calculations thus suggest that neither of well - behaved @xcite indexes is currently reliable at near - solar metallicity .",
    "the problem undoubtedly is lines still missing from the line list . as seen in fig .  3",
    ", missing lines often overlap in the solar spectrum to such an extent that they could not be individually discerned , and so their species and wavelength assignments became arbitrary .",
    "this was true especially in the 2550  2600   and the 2640  2710  regions , where we did not complete the process .",
    "this is the reason for the excess flux seen in the calculations at solar metallicity in these regions .",
    "this could be remedied were spectra obtained of the same quality as that of  for stars of the line strength of 184499 that span a range of properties , notably @xmath60 .",
    "for example , the spectra of 184499 and a hyades f star with  @xmath26500  should have about the same overall line strength : the hyades star s higher abundance , [ fe / h ]  @xmath2 + 0.15 , is offset by its higher @xmath45 at the rate of 0.1dex per 100 , as fig .  2 illustrates .",
    "because line crowding is much lower than in , comparing high - resolution mid - uv spectra of 184499 and a sharp - lined hyades f star could show where the strongest lines are that are missing at solar metallicity and suggest their identities from the changes observed with @xmath61 .",
    "the  and solar spectra could then be used to fill in the rest . analyzing an additional star closer in  to 184499 but",
    "with  = 0 would show explicitly which transitions are due to magnesium in the 2550   region , and whether oh has been properly characterized throughout the 2900  3100  domain .    at that point",
    ", the full arsenal of indexes representing the strengths of mid - uv features could be calculated from the spectra , and their behavior with , , [ fe / h ] , and  assessed explicitly .",
    "this is a major advantage of calculations from first principles over empirical libraries , which are confined to the spectra of stars available nearby .",
    "it is a major goal of this project .",
    "indexes should result with significant diagnostic power for the integrated - light spectrum of an old stellar system .",
