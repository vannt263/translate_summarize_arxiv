    "since the suggested association between a gamma - ray burst ( grb ) and supernova 1998bw ( galama et al .",
    "1998 ) , the possible general connection between grbs and sne has been discussed ( cen 1998 , wang et al .",
    "in contrast , kippen et al .",
    "( 1998 ) found no evidence for a grb - sne connection , and grazianni , lamb & marion ( 1998 ) even conclude that not all sn ib , c / ii can be associated with grbs , although a fraction might be . on the other hand ,",
    "wang et al .",
    "( 1998 ) found seven candidate sn - grb correlations while bloom et al .",
    "( 1998 ) estimated these sn - grb isotropic explosion energy range from @xmath11 erg / s , and suggested that a subclass of grbs is associated with supernova ib , c / ii .",
    "jets have been introduced to solve two problems raised in the grb - sn united picture since 1 ) the great difference between the batse - inferred grb rate with a narrow luminosity function ( @xmath12 h@xmath13 mpc@xmath14 yr@xmath15 ) ( kommers et al .",
    "1999 ; schmidit 1999 ) and the supernova rate ( @xmath16 h@xmath13 mpc@xmath14 yr@xmath15 ) , and 2 ) the great difference between the explosion energy of grbs and supernovae . with a jet",
    "the total energy necessary to produce the observational fluxes will be reduced by a factor @xmath17 ( @xmath18 is the lorentz factor of a relativistic jet ) , and the total rate will be greater by a factor @xmath19 ( cen 1998 ; wang et al .",
    "1998 ) . were a wide grb luminosity function or jet to operate , batse - detected grbs would only be a small fraction of all grbs that occur .    in this letter , we compare grb rates derived from supernova rates and density evolution to that of the measured rates from the fourth batse catalog of grbs to investigate possible constraints on the grb luminosity function and jet parameters .",
    "we also discuss two other related interesting questions : 1 ) can the special relativistic effects of a jet provide by itself an acceptable luminosity function for grbs ?",
    "2 ) can the large amount of undetected bursts contribute to the observational gamma - ray background near 100 kev for an acceptable grb luminosity function ? the former provides an alternative way to test if the gamma - ray burst emission is isotropic or random in the jet s comoving frame .",
    "if supernovae are the mysterious sources of grbs , then the grb `` equivalent isotropic '' explosion energy could be within a relatively large range : from @xmath20 erg / s , deduced for grb 990123 ( kulkarni et al 1999 ) to @xmath21 erg / s estimated from sn ib / c - grbs associations ( wang & wheeler 1998 ; bloom et al .",
    "we assume the unknown intrinsic luminosity distribution follows a power - law : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the normalization factor .",
    "we fix @xmath24 erg / s .",
    "we find that varying @xmath25 from @xmath26 to @xmath27 erg / s affected our results only slightly ; @xmath28 was allowed to vary in the range @xmath29 - @xmath25 . observed spectra of grbs can be approximated as a power - law : @xmath30 with spectral index @xmath31 ( mallozzi et al .",
    "for source density , we adopt the broken power - law function we have used before as a rough description for sn ib / c evolution ( che et al . 1999 ) :    @xmath32    where @xmath33 is the comoving grb density at redshift @xmath34 per mpc@xmath35 yr@xmath15 .",
    "we set @xmath36 , @xmath37 ( lilly 1996 ) , and @xmath38 ( madau 1998 , sadat 1998 ) .",
    "we will assume a universe where the calculations are particularly simple : a flat friedmann universe with cosmological constant @xmath39 .",
    "we do not expect the results would differ significantly in universes with a significant @xmath40 . in our asssumed universe ,",
    "the number of observed gamma - ray bursts peak flux brighter than p is :    @xmath41    the observed peak flux of a grb at redshift @xmath42 with intrinsic luminosity @xmath43 is : @xmath44 where we fixed the spectral index to be @xmath45 ( mallozzi et al .",
    "1996 ) , and @xmath46 erg @xmath47 s@xmath15 @xmath48 photon @xmath47 s@xmath15 .",
    "@xmath49 where @xmath50 is measured in kev and @xmath51 is proper motion distance .",
    "the total number of bursts we observe every year is @xmath52 as derived from eqn .",
    "we selected the 939 bursts with peak flux greater than @xmath53 from the fourth batse grb catalog ( batse 4b ) to get the measured log @xmath5 - log @xmath6 relation that will be used for comparison .",
    "we compared this log @xmath5 - log @xmath6 to grbs following the evolving supernova rate , finding the best fits to the luminosity function range parameter @xmath28 and slope parameter @xmath3 .",
    "the rate was normalized by @xmath54 as given in eq .",
    "we searched the acceptable range of @xmath28 and @xmath3 with the k - s confidence level @xmath55 .",
    "the luminosity function width was allowed to vary from @xmath56 , while the luminosity function slope was allowed to vary from @xmath57 .",
    "the search result is shown in figure 1 : the acceptable range of luminosity function widths were @xmath58 , while the acceptable rage for the luminosity function slope was @xmath59 .      setting the @xmath60 yr@xmath15 , which is the batse yearly rate corrected for the duty cycle ( meegan et al .",
    "1992 ) , and constraining log @xmath4 and @xmath3 from equation ( 5 ) , we can find lines of constant rate ( @xmath61 ) in the @xmath3 - log @xmath4 frame .",
    "if we further suppose that grbs are connected with supernovae , then for the fireball model , the grb event rate should follow the supernovae rate @xmath16 h@xmath13 mpc@xmath14 yr@xmath15 . for a jet with a lorentz factor @xmath62 ,",
    "however , the grb rate will decrease to @xmath12 h@xmath13 mpc@xmath14 yr@xmath15 .",
    "two lines of constant grb rate are plotted in figure 1 and labeled as lines ii and iii , representing isotropically emitting fireball grbs and grbs beamed into a @xmath63 jets respectively . to the left of these two lines , grbs will have a higher event rate than detected by batse .",
    "for the fireball model , line ii traverses the k - s test acceptable region at around @xmath64 erg / s , which is enough to produce a gamma - ray burst by shock , but is quite close to the hypothesized theoretical minimum ( meszaros 1999 ) .",
    "therefore , grbs occurring at the supernova rate are not in conflict with the isotropic fireball model .",
    "line iii shows that the minimum isotropic explosion energy of grbs from a jet is @xmath65 erg / s . from lines ii and iii",
    ", it is not possible to discern whether a jet is preferred from isotropic emission , since both cross the allowed k - s fit region .",
    "most grbs in the jet model , however , expend more energy than those in an isotropic fireball model , possibly indicating that jet models are more likely to be related to massive stars ( woosley 1998 , sari 1999 ) or hypernovae ( paczynski , 1998 ; iwamoto et al .",
    "1998 ; woosley et al . 1998 ; wheeler et al . 1999 ) .",
    "as the luminosity function width @xmath8 increases , the fraction of undetected bursts become larger , which leads to more grb photons contributing to the diffuse gamma - ray background near 100 kev .",
    "quantitatively , this can be written as : @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the average luminosity of individual sources , and @xmath68 represents the observational gamma - ray background intensity .",
    "we can deduce the required @xmath33 from this equation and estimate the required minimum grb rate from the observation of cosmic ray background ( watanabe et al 1998 , comastri 1998 ) .",
    "this result is shown by line i in figure 1 .",
    "line i lies outside of k - s test region which indicates that grbs can not dominate the diffuse cosmic gamma - ray background .",
    "a relativistic jet or fireball has been considered as a way to solve the enormous energy release of grbs ( paczynski & xu 1994 ; rees & meszaros 1994 ; sari & piran 1997 ; pilla & loeb 1998 ) .",
    "though the models of shocks ( internal or external ) for producing a gamma - ray burst usually assume a magnetic field and relativistic particle acceleration ( meszaros et al 1994 ; panaitescu et al 1999 ) , the gamma - ray burst radiation should be confined within the beam .",
    "the simple assumption that the grb radiation direction is random in the rest frame of the shocks can not be excluded absolutely . in this section",
    ", we test this assumption by checking if the grb luminosity function can be induced by a purely special relativistic effect .",
    "we assume that the angle between the line of sight and beaming axis is @xmath69 , the velocity of beaming is @xmath70 and @xmath71 is the intrinsic luminosity of grb in the beaming comoving frame , then the observational flux come from a source at redshift z is ( blandford & konigl 1979 ) : @xmath72 @xmath73 where @xmath74 , the lorentz factor .",
    "we assume the beaming - induced @xmath75 , here @xmath76 corresponds to the biggest viewing angle @xmath77 we can see a burst .",
    "@xmath78 , seen by the observer within the beam , @xmath79 .",
    "the induced luminosity function @xmath80 is : @xmath81 @xmath82 with @xmath83 , the induced luminosity function index is constrained to be @xmath84 , far below the required index for log @xmath5 - log @xmath6 .",
    "we indicate this allowed region in figure 1 .",
    "we note that this allowed region does not intersect the allowed region created by the necessity of fit to the measured batse log @xmath5 - log @xmath6 .",
    "this contradiction implies that the grb luminosity function is not created by purely special relativistic bulk motion .",
    "perhaps the real luminosity function of grbs has only a component due to beaming .",
    "if so , the beaming induced luminosity function can not dominate but modulate the intrinsically wide luminosity function . for this to be true",
    ", the intrinsic dynamic range induced by beaming must be quite modest . from inspection of figure 1",
    ", we see that it if beaming creates only @xmath85 , it will not dominate the wider intrinsic luminosity function . from eqn .",
    "7 , we see that if the gamma - ray burst is beamed into an angle of @xmath86 , then the extra amount of beaming generated by relativistic motion will generate an @xmath85 for @xmath87 , and so could be hidden by the intrinsic luminosity function of grbs .",
    "this result can be tested by detecting the off - axis x - ray emissions from beamed grbs , caused by purely special relativistic effects , proposed by woods and loeb ( 1999 ) .",
    "up to now , the sources for grbs remain mysterious .",
    "though some observations suggest that grbs are associated with supernovae type ib , c / ii , we need more information to confirm this kind of connection . however , the nature of the intrinsic luminosity function is a more general problem . in this letter",
    ", we have studied the luminosity function from various aspects and given a clearer sketch on how the luminosity function dynamic range is constrained by the gamma ray burst rate , and what contradictions exist between the observationally favored luminosity and a beaming - induced luminosity function .",
    "our results are based on the assumption of connection between grbs and sne .",
    "our results show 1 ) if a model for grbs is considered for the consistence with grb rate , we can not ignore the possible intrinsic dynamic range of luminosity function to the rate .",
    "2 ) if we consider the source density evolution of grbs , the required width of luminosity function , log @xmath4 can not be less than 2 .",
    "3 ) the required minimum explosion energy for grbs from the relative grb rate , the limits on the width of the grb luminosity function , and the exclusion of special relativistic motion as the cause of the luminosity function may turn out to be helpful to those studying the grb radiation and progenitor mechanisms .",
