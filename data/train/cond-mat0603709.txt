    "at the heart of the quantum theory lies the fundamental principle of describing physically observable quantities as hermitian operators acting on hilbert space of quantum states .",

    "the uncertainty principle characterizes the statistical spread of the distributions corresponding to two different observables .",
    "if the operators representing the observables do not commute , the statistical variations of their observed distributions , frequently called uncertainties , can not generally be arbitrarily small in a given state . however , the statistical variation of a single observable is not limited in any way by the uncertainty principle . for",
    "two given non - commuting observables , a state in which the lower limit of the uncertainty principle is reached is called a minimum uncertainty state . decreasing the uncertainty with respect to one observable results in the increase of the uncertainty of the other .",
    "the transfer of uncertainty from one observable to another with respect to the minimum uncertainty values is referred to as squeezing .",
    "the squeezing of quantum fluctuations was first studied and experimentally verified in quantum optics , where the components of quantized electric field served as the squeezed observables.@xcite since then the phenomenon has been observed in superconducting circuits,@xcite and more recently , there has been a promising efforts to realize the squeezing in nanomechanical structures.@xcite    due to the technological advances , the development in mesoscopic physics has been rapid in last decades , and many interesting quantum phenomena have been experimentally verified for the first time . also a number of new and important measuring devices , necessary to observe elementary quantum phenomena , have been invented . in this paper",
    "we study the phenomena of the quantum squeezing in a mesoscopic superconducting quantum interference device ( squid ) , with emphasis on the creation and consequences of the squeezing .",
    "however , the squeezing is an example of a manipulation of quantum fluctuations which could have direct applications in a practical quantum measurement .",
    "experimentally the squeezing of the quantum fluctuations has been demonstrated in microwave frequencies by constructing a josephson parametric amplifier,@xcite with a 40% reduction of the vacuum noise .",
    "theoretically the squeezing has been studied in a similar squid ring we consider here.@xcite the squeezing mechanism we study is different from one studied in ref . which was based on a rapid decrease of an external magnetic flux to switch on the josephson coupling .",
    "we consider a parametric instability in a harmonic regime,@xcite a well - known procedure to create the squeezing and applicable in various different systems.@xcite it can be realized with an elementary flux control in an rf squid . in the limit of a negligible dissipation",
    "the magnitude of the squeezing is exponential in short times and , it rotates between the charge and the magnetic flux of the squid .",
    "a strong dissipation compensates the resonant driving and leads to a rotating quasistationary state where uncertainties periodically go below their groundstate values .",
    "we calculate the noise spectrum of periodic squeezed states and discuss the measurement problem by analyzing a setup where the squid is coupled to a transmission line .",
    "the parametric resonance is a well - known physical phenomena in a classical harmonic oscillator ( ha).@xcite a periodic time - dependent perturbation can lead to large effects , which are most significant when the period of the perturbation is twice the resonance frequency . driven in resonance , the energy of the system grows exponentially in time .",

    "<S> we study rotating squeezed quantum states created by a parametric resonance in an open harmonic system . as a specific realization of the phenomenon we study a mesoscopic squid loop where the state preparation procedure is simple in principle and feasible with currently available experimental methods . by solving dynamics and calculating spectral properties </S>",
    "<S> we show that quantum fluctuations of squid observables can be reduced below their groundstate value . </S>",
    "<S> the measurement is introduced by coupling the squid to a transmission line carrying the radiation to a secondary measurement device . besides the theoretical interest , our studies are motivated by an opportunity for a practical quantum noise engineering . </S>"
