    "lattice qcd calculations of baryon masses are based on the analysis of 2-point correlation functions , defined by @xmath1 where @xmath2 are color - singlet baryon source fields .",

    "an effective mass is calculated from @xmath5 .",
    "ideal sources maximally overlap the states of interest : @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is an intermediate state . by using the orthogonality relation of basis vectors spanning irreducible representations ( irs ) of the cubic group , one can attempt to realize this relation by taking @xmath2 to be a linear combination of source operators that have a good overlap with state @xmath7 .",
    "there are 48 discrete spatial rotations that conserve the cubic symmetry of spin @xmath8 objects , and they form a group , called `` double covered octahedral group '' , or @xmath9 .",
    "the reduction of the group @xmath9 falls into three spinorial irs : @xmath10 , and @xmath11 with respective dimensions 2 , 2 , and 4 .",

    "since lattice calculations preserve cubic symmetry , different irs do not admix .",
    "however , each ir is an admixture of different total angular momenta .",
    "total angular momentum is not a `` good '' quantum number on the lattice because continuous rotational symmetry is broken .",
    "it is expected that higher spin states have higher masses , therefore within a given ir the lowest spin state dominates at large @xmath4 .",
    "a general expression of three - quark baryon operator would be written as @xmath12 where @xmath13 , and @xmath14 are dirac indices , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 are color indices , and @xmath21 , and @xmath22 are spatial displacement vectors .",
    "@xmath23 is the gauge link connecting the spatial path from @xmath3 to @xmath24 .",
    "the coefficients tie together a set of spatial displacement vectors @xmath21 , and @xmath22 , and dirac indices @xmath13 , and @xmath14 in such a way as to yield gauge invariant operators that transform according to irs of @xmath25 and definite isospin .    in order to have sources that are commensurate with the size of baryons ,",
    "it is appropriate to smear the sources , using for example , gaussian smearing , @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the smearing width , @xmath28 is an integer , and @xmath29 is the gauge - covariant three - dimensional laplacian operator . for different radial distributions ,",
    "additional powers of laplacian operators are used , e.g. , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and so on .",
    "the simplest nonlocal operator has @xmath32 , @xmath33 . applying spatial rotations of the cubic group to this operator",
    "leads to @xmath34 dimensional representations , where six is for the directions of @xmath35 and eight for the three spin degrees of freedom .",
    "reduction of these representations results in 6 @xmath0 s , 2 @xmath36 s , and 8 @xmath11 s . from these `` one - link '' constructions ,",
