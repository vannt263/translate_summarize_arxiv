    "it is not gross exaggeration to assert that conception of the phase transition is one of fundamental ideas of contemporary physics .",
    "related picture is based on the landau scheme , according to which a thermodynamic system , driven by slow and monotonic variations of state parameters of heat bath , rebuilds its macroscopic state if thermodynamic potential gets one or more additional minima in a state space @xcite . from mathematical point of view",
    ", such a phase transition represents the simplest bifurcation that results in doubling thermodynamic steady states .",
    "as is known , thermodynamic phase transition is a special case of self - organization process in the course of which three principle parameters , being order parameter , its conjugate field and control parameter , very in self - consistent manner @xcite . roughly speaking ,",
    "a generalization of thermodynamic picture due to passage to synergetic one is stipulated by extension of set of state parameters from single parameter to three ones , being above pointed out .",
    "it might hope that such a generalization allows one to describe not only the simplest landau - like bifurcation , but much more complicated hopf one , when a limit cycle is created to be continuous manifold instead of discrete one @xcite .",
    "our considerations of this problem have shown @xcite that using the whole set of universal deformations within standard synergetic scheme does not arrive at stable limit cycle , whereas running out off the standard scheme of self - organization has allowed us to obtain the limit cycle shown in fig.1 @xcite .",
    "$ ] , @xmath1 with @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 @xcite.,width=453 ]    in this connection , the question arises : what is the physical reason that self - organization scheme may not represent the hopf bifurcation ?",
    "this paper is devoted to the answering above question .",
    "it is appeared , main reason is that a description of a limit cycle demands using both potential and force of a field conjugated to an order parameter , whereas standard synergetic scheme uses an force of this field only .",
    "following @xcite , we show in section 2 that fast revolving of the state point in the phase plane induces a gauge field , whose potential is reduced to relative velocity of movement of interior domain of the limit cycle with respect to the exterior .",
    "such a picture allows us to study , in section 3 , a revolving phase plane with a set of limit cycles , using an analogy with revolving vessel containing superfluid he@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "section 4 concludes our consideration .",
    "we consider hamiltonian dynamics determined by the equations of motion @xmath5 for both fast and slow coordinates @xmath6 , @xmath7 and conjugate momenta @xmath8 , @xmath9 , respectively ( hereafter , the dot over a symbol denotes time derivation ) .",
    "related hamiltonian @xmath10 is splitted into the slow term @xmath11 and the fast one @xmath12 , latter of which depends on the slow coordinate also .    in accordance with standard scheme @xcite",
    "it is naturally to pass from the fast variables @xmath6 , @xmath8 to canonical ones , being fast alternating angle @xmath13 and slow varying action @xmath14 .",
    "this passage keeps invariant the first term of the hamiltonian ( [ 1 ] ) and transforms the second one according to relation @xmath15 whose explicit form is determined with generating function @xmath16 to be defined by the following constrains : @xmath17 due to fast variations of the angle @xmath13 , it is naturally to consider the term ( [ 3 ] ) @xmath18 being averaged over this variations .    to find related hamiltonian one has to use one - valued generating function @xmath19 instead of many - valued one , @xmath16 .",
    "then , the last factor in eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) is determined by the relation @xmath20 that expresses the chain rule .",
    "its using gives the averaged term ( [ 4 ] ) in the following form : @xmath21    as a result , usage of the canonical angle - action representation derives to the transformation of the averaged hamiltonian ( [ 1 ] ) : @xmath22 where the first term @xmath23 depends on slow varying values only .    to find equations of motions for above slow variables one has to issue from the extremum condition for effective action @xcite @xmath24{\\rm d}t   \\label{10}\\ ] ]",
    "whose form is determined by the hamiltonian ( [ 8 ] ) ; @xmath25 , @xmath26 are initial and final points of the time .",
    "variation of this expression with respect to the momentum derives to the equation of motion @xmath27 keeping initial form ( [ 0 ] ) ( hereafter , we suppose that slow variables are vector quantities with components @xmath28 , @xmath29 ) . on the other hand , variation of the action ( [ 10 ] ) over the slow coordinate",
    "arrives at the equation @xmath30 that is prolonged due to an effective field with the force given by antisymmetric tensor @xmath31 and vector potential @xmath32 as usually , we use the einstein summation rule over repeated index @xmath33 .    above relations ( [ 12])([14 ] ) arrive at the conclusion of fundamental importance : fast variations of coordinates whose values depend on slow variables induces an effective gauge field @xcite . for case of the hopf bifurcation , it means that such a bifurcation , in the course of the system evolution , arrives at the revolving not only of the configuration point , but of the whole domain of the phase plane that is bounded by the limit cycle . in other words ,",
    "the physical picture of the hopf bifurcation means the phase plane behaves as a real object , but not a mathematical one .",
    "we consider a round phase plane that is spanned on the axes of both coordinate @xmath6 and momentum @xmath8 and revolves with the angle velocity @xmath34 and a moment of inertia @xmath35 . from the physical point of view",
    ", the value @xmath34 determines the frequency of external influence , whereas the quantity @xmath35 is reduced to total action of the system under consideration . if the phase circle revolves as a solid plane , a phase point with coordinate @xmath36 has the linear velocity @xmath37 $ ] .",
    "according to above consideration , the hopf bifurcation results in the limit cycle creation that induces a gauge field with the vector potential ( [ 14 ] ) and the strength ( [ 13 ] ) , which are reduced to linear and angle velocities , @xmath38 and @xmath39 , respectively .",
    "these are not equal to normal values @xmath40 and @xmath34 because a region bounded by the limit cycle revolves with different velocities due to the gauge field effect . indeed , if one represents the limit cycle creation as an ordering with a complex parameter @xmath41 , then the phase gradient @xmath42 , where @xmath43 , @xmath44 being an elementary action , affects in such a manner to compensate a rotation within a domain bounded by the limit cycle : @xmath45 .",
    "in this way , the relative velocity @xmath38 appears as a gradient prolongation : @xmath46 , being caused by the gauge field @xmath38 . in opposition to the case of the solid plane revolving , ordering arrives at non - linear relation @xmath47 between the angular and linear components of the revolving velocity .",
    "well - known example of such type behaviour represents the case of revolving superfluid he@xmath48 @xcite . along this line , an effective potential density of the revolving phase plane , including a set of limit cycles , has the following form @xcite @xmath49 within the phenomenological scheme , the density of the potential variation due to limit cycle creation is given by the landau expansion @xmath50 whose form is fixed by parameters @xmath51 , @xmath52 .",
    "the second term of eq.([15 ] ) determines heterogeneity energy with the gradient , being prolonged by the vector potential @xmath38 of the gauge field .",
    "the last term is the kinetic energy of the revolving phase plane .    under an external influence with frequency @xmath34",
    ", the system behaviour is defined by the effective potential density @xmath53 whose value is determined with respect to the revolving plane that is characterized with the angular momentum @xmath54 .",
    "steady state distributions of the order parameter @xmath55 and the relative velocity @xmath56 are given by extremum condition of the total value of the effective potential @xmath57 where integration is fulfilled over the whole area of the phase plane .",

    "is characterized with the effective energy density @xmath63 , whereas an ordered phase being bounded by this cycle relates to the value @xmath64 . as a result , the condition @xmath65 of the phase equilibrium gives a characteristic value of the revolving velocity @xmath66 to determine an energy scale @xmath67 .",
    "moreover , it is useful to introduce two lengths @xmath68 , @xmath69 and their ratio @xmath70 to be determined by the following relations : @xmath71 then , measuring the energy density @xmath72 in units @xmath73 , the order parameter @xmath74  in @xmath75 , the angle velocity @xmath39  in @xmath76 , the linear velocities @xmath40 , @xmath38  in @xmath77 , the angular moment @xmath78  in @xmath79 , and the distance @xmath80  in @xmath68 , one reduces the energy density ( [ 17 ] ) to the simplest form @xmath81 inserting this equality into the total energy ( [ 18 ] ) and variating the functional obtained , one finds the following equations of motion : @xmath82 @xmath83    as is known @xcite , the form of solutions of these equations is fixed with the parameter @xmath84 given by two last eqs.([23 ] ) . in usual case ,",
    "the phase plane is so small to be realized the condition @xmath85 , and a single limit cycle ( type of shown in fig.[fig.1 ] ) can be created with the form and size determined by the external frequency @xmath86 .",
    "much more rich situation is realized in the case of the so large phase plane that inverted condition @xmath87 is fulfilled .",
    "then , within the interval @xmath88 , bounded with the limit velocities @xmath89 @xmath90 the mixed state is realized to be a set of round limit cycles periodically distributed over surface of the revolving phase plane .",
    "each of these cycles has elementary action @xmath91 to reach the maximum value @xmath92 of the cycle density per unit of area at @xmath93 . with falling down external velocity near the upper boundary",
    "@xmath94 the limit cycle density decreases according to the equality @xmath95 where average over the phase plane @xmath96 is connected with the revolving velocity @xmath86 by the equality @xmath97 the average value @xmath98 is smaller than external value @xmath86 in a quantity being equal to the average of the plane polarization @xmath99 the maximum value of a revolving velocity is reached in cores of limit cycles , and the minimum one @xmath100  in the centers of triangles formed by cycles .",

    "these cycles can be treated independently .",
    "taking into account that @xmath105 varies at distances @xmath106 and @xmath107 does at @xmath108 , the relative velocity are determined by eq.([25b ] ) with @xmath109 and @xmath110 : @xmath111 where @xmath112 is the hankel function of imaginary argument .",

    "one has @xmath116 at @xmath117 and @xmath118 at @xmath119 .",
    "the dependence @xmath120 is of steadily increasing nature : at @xmath121 it has the vertical tangent and with @xmath86 growth it asymptotically approaches to the straight line @xmath122 .",
    "effective energy per one limit cycle is @xmath123 , the @xmath124 value in a cycle center is twice as large as @xmath103 .",
    "within hamiltonian formalism , combined consideration of both fast and slow sets of dynamical variables shows that averaging over the angle of the canonical pair angle - action induces an effective gauge field if fast coordinates depend on slow ones . for case of the hopf bifurcation , it means that such a bifurcation , in the course of the system evolution , arrives at the revolving not only of the configuration point , but the whole region of the phase plane being bounded by the limit cycle .",
