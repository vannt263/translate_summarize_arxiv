    "the modelling of natural language relies on the idea that languages are compositional , i.e. that the meaning of a sentence is a function of the meanings of the words in the sentence , as proposed by @xcite . whether or not this principle tells the whole story , it is certainly important as we undoubtedly manage to create and understand novel combinations of words .",
    "fuzzy set theory has long been considered a useful framework for the modelling of natural language expressions , as it provides a functional calculus for concept combination @xcite .",
    "a simple example of compositionality is hedged concepts .",
    "hedges are words such as ` very ' , ` quite ' , ` more or less ' , ` extremely ' .",
    "they are usually modelled as transforming the membership function of a base concept to either narrow or broaden the extent of application of that concept .",
    "so , given a concept ` short ' , the term ` very short ' applies to fewer objects than ` short ' , and ` quite short ' to more .",
    "modelling a hedge as a transformation of a concept allows us to determine membership of an object in the hedged concept as a function of its membership in the base concept , rather than building the hedged concept from scratch @xcite .",
    "linguistic hedges have been widely applied , including in fuzzy classifiers @xcite and database queries @xcite .",
    "using linguistic hedges in these applications allows increased accuracy in rules or queries whilst maintaining human interpretability of results @xcite .",
    "this motivates the need for a semantically grounded account of linguistic hedges : if hedged results are more interpretable then the hedges used must themselves be meaningful .    in the following",
    "we provide an account of linguistic hedges that is both functional , and semantically grounded .",
    "in its most basic formulation , the operation requires no additional parameters , although we also show that the formulae can be generalised if necessary .",
    "our account of linguistic hedges uses the label semantics framework to model concepts @xcite .",
    "this is a random set approach which quantifies an agent s subjective uncertainty about the extent of application of a concept .",
    "we refer to this uncertainty as _ semantic uncertainty _",
    "@xcite to emphasise that it concerns the definition of concepts and categories , in contrast to stochastic uncertainty which concerns the state of the world . in @xcite",
    "the label semantics approach is combined with conceptual spaces @xcite and prototype theory @xcite , to give a formalisation of concepts as based on a prototype and a threshold , located in a conceptual space .",
    "this approach is discussed in detail in section [ sec : bkg ] .",
    "an outline of the paper is then as follows : section [ sec : lh ] discusses different approaches to linguistic hedges from the literature , and compares these with our model .",
    "subsequently , in section [ sec : results ] , we give formulations of the hedges ` very ' and ` quite ' .",
    "these are formed by considering the dependence of the threshold of a hedged concept on the threshold of the original concept .",
    "we give a basic model and two generalisations , show that the models can be composed and investigate the behaviour in the limit of composition .",
    "section [ sec : disc ] compares our results to those in the literature and proposes further lines of research .",
    "prototype theory views concepts as being defined in terms of prototypes , rather than by a set of necessary and sufficient conditions .",
    "elements from an underlying metric space then have graded membership in a concept depending on their similarity to a prototype for the concept .",
    "there is some evidence that humans use natural categories in this way , as shown in experiments reported in @xcite .",
    "fuzzy set theory @xcite was proposed as a calculus for combining and modifying concepts with graded membership , and extended these ideas in @xcite to linguistic variables as variables taking words as values , rather than numbers .",
    "for example , ` height ' can be viewed as a linguistic variable taking values ` short , ' ` tall ' , ` very tall ' , etc .",
    "the variable relates to an underlying universe of discourse @xmath0 , which for the concept ` tall ' could be @xmath1 .",
    "then each value @xmath2 of the variable is associated with a fuzzy subset of @xmath0 , and a function @xmath3 $ ] associates with each @xmath4 the value of its membership in @xmath2 .",
    "prototype theory gives a semantic basis to fuzzy sets through the notion of similarity to a prototype , as described in @xcite . in this context",
    ", concepts are represented by fuzzy sets and membership of an element in a concept is quantified by its similarity to the prototype . in this situation",
    "the fuzziness of the concept is seen as inherent to the concept .",
    "an alternative interpretation for fuzzy sets is random set theory , see @xcite for an exposition . here",
    ", the fuzziness of a set comes from uncertainty about a crisp set , i.e. semantic uncertainty , rather than fuzziness inherent in the world .",
    "this second approach is the stance taken by @xcite , and which we now adopt in this paper .      _",
    "conceptual spaces _ are proposed by grdenfors in @xcite as a framework for representing information at the conceptual level .",
    "grdenfors contrasts his theory with both a symbolic , logical approach to concepts , and an associationist approach where concepts are represented as associations between different kinds of basic information elements .",
    "rather , conceptual spaces are geometrical structures based on quality dimensions such as weight , height , hue , brightness , etc .",
    "it is assumed that conceptual spaces are metric spaces , with an associated distance measure .",
    "this might be euclidean distance , or any other appropriate metric .",
    "the distance measure can be used to formulate a measure of similarity , as needed for prototype theory - similar objects are close together in the conceptual space , very different objects are far apart .    to develop the conceptual space framework ,",
    "grdenfors also introduces the notion of integral and separable dimensions .",
    "dimensions are integral if assignment of a value in one dimension implies assignment of a value in another , such as depth and breadth .",
    "conversely , separable dimensions are those where there is no such implication , such as height and sweetness .",
    "domain _ is then defined as a set of quality dimensions that are separable from all other dimensions , and a _ conceptual space _ is defined as a collection of one or more domains .",
    "grdenfors goes on to define a _",
    "property _ as a convex region of a domain in a conceptual space .",
    "concept _ is defined as a set of such regions that are related via a set of salience weights .",
    "this casting of ( at least ) properties as convex regions of a domain sits very well with prototype theory , as grdenfors points out .",
    "if properties are convex regions of a space , then it is possible to say that an object is more or less central to that region . because the region is convex",
    ", its centroid will lie within the region , and this centroid can be seen as the prototype of the property .",
    "the label semantics framework was proposed by @xcite and related to prototype theory and conceptual spaces in @xcite . in this framework",
    ", agents use a set of labels @xmath5 to describe an underlying conceptual space @xmath0 which has a distance metric @xmath6 between points .",
    "in fact , it is sufficient that @xmath6 be a pseudo - distance .",
    "when @xmath7 or @xmath8 is a set , say @xmath9 , we take @xmath10 . in this case , the set @xmath9 is seen as an ontic set , i.e. , a set where all elements are jointly prototypes , as opposed to an epistemic set describing a precise but unknown prototype , as described in @xcite .",
    "each label @xmath11 is associated with firstly a set of prototype values @xmath12 , and secondly a threshold @xmath13 , about which the agents are uncertain .",
    "the thresholds @xmath13 are drawn from probability distributions @xmath14 .",
    "labels @xmath11 are associated with neighbourhoods @xmath15 .",
    "the neighbourhood can be seen as the extension of the concept @xmath11 .",
    "the intuition here is that @xmath13 captures the idea of being sufficiently close to prototypes @xmath16 .",
    "in other words , @xmath17 is sufficiently close to @xmath16 to be appropriately labelled as @xmath11 providing that @xmath18 .",
    "given an element @xmath4 , we can ask how appropriate a given label is to describe it .",
    "this is quantified by an appropriateness measure , denoted @xmath19 .",
    "we are intentionally using the same notation as for the membership function of a fuzzy set .",
    "this quantity is the probability that the distance from @xmath7 to @xmath16 , the prototype of @xmath11 , is less than the threshold @xmath13 , as given by :    @xmath20    we also use the notation @xmath21 , according to which @xmath22 . the above formulation",
    "provides a link to the random set interpretation of fuzzy sets .",
    "random sets are random variables taking sets as values . if we view @xmath23 as a random set from @xmath1 into @xmath24 , then @xmath19 is the single point coverage function of @xmath23 , as defined in @xcite , and also commonly called a contour function @xcite .",
    "labels can often be semantically related to each other .",
    "for example , the label ` pet fish ' is semantically related to the labels ` pet ' and ` fish ' , and the label ` very tall ' related to the label ` tall ' .",
    "this prompts two questions : firstly , how the prototypes of each concept are related to each other , and secondly , how the thresholds of each concept are related .",
    "two simple models for the relationships between the thresholds are given in @xcite . the _ consonant model _ takes all thresholds as being dependent on one common underlying threshold .",
    "so , all thresholds have the same distance metric @xmath25 and are related to a base threshold @xmath26 by the dependency that @xmath27 for increasing functions @xmath28 . in contrast , the _ independence model _ takes all thresholds as being independent of each other .",
    "this might hold when labels are taken from different conceptual spaces .    between these two extremes , we model dependencies between thresholds as a bayesian network - i.e. , a directed acyclic graph whose edges encode conditional dependence between variables .",
    "the key property of this type of network is that the joint distribution of all variables can be broken into factors that depend only on each individual variable and its parents .",
    "so , for example , the network in figure [ fig : bn ] can be factorised as @xmath29 .",
    "this enables calculation of the joint distribution and therefore marginal distributions in an efficient manner .",
    "one intuitively easy example is where the dependency of one threshold @xmath30 on another @xmath31 is that @xmath32 .",
    "this could be taken to model the dependency of the threshold of the concept ` very tall ' on the threshold of ` tall ' .",
    "the label ` very tall ' should be appropriate to describe fewer people than the label ` tall ' .",
    "therefore , the threshold for describing someone as ` very tall ' will be narrower than the threshold for describing someone as ` tall ' , i.e. @xmath33 .",
    "this simple model will form part of the approach to modelling linguistic hedges , as outlined in the sequel .",
    "linguistic hedges have been given varying treatments in the literature . in this section",
    "we summarise these different approaches and state the approach that we wish to take , discussing properties that hedge modifiers may need .",
    "we give two specific approaches from the literature with which we will compare our results .    in @xcite",
    "the idea of linguistic hedges as operators modifying fuzzy sets was introduced , so that the membership function @xmath34 of a hedged concept , @xmath35 , is a function of the membership of the base concept @xmath2 , i.e. @xmath36 .",
    "furthermore , truth can be considered as a linguistic variable and hence a fuzzy set @xcite , so that the application of a hedge can be seen as modifying the truth value of a sentence using that concept @xcite .",
    "this second view is useful in approximate reasoning , and allows for an algebraic approach to investigating the properties of linguistic hedges , as introduced in @xcite , and expanded upon in @xcite .",
    "the approach we take , however , is to view a hedge as modifying the fuzzy set associated with a concept directly , as taken by @xcite . rather than examining the algebraic properties of hedges or their role in reasoning",
    ", we look at how hedges are semantically grounded and argue that our approach provides a particularly clear semantics .",
    "we will propose a set of operations that may be used for both expansion and refinement of single concepts .",
    "this is in contrast to the work presented in @xcite in which information coarsening is effected by taking disjunctions of labels .",
    "the idea of a hedged concept has some similarities to that of the bipolar model of concepts described in @xcite , since if it is appropriate to describe someone as ` very tall ' , it must be appropriate to describe them as ` tall ' , and similarly describing someone as ` quite tall ' implies that it is not entirely inappropriate to describe them as ` tall ' .",
    "however , we see the concepts derived by application of hedges as labels in their own right which can be used to describe data or objects .",
    "zadeh divides hedges into two types .",
    "a type 1 hedge can be seen as an operator acting on a single fuzzy set .",
    "examples are ` very ' , ` more or less ' , ` quite ' , or ` extremely ' @xcite . type 2 hedges are more complicated and include modifiers such as ` technically ' or ` practically ' . in @xcite concepts are considered as made up of various different components , with the membership function a weighted sum of the memberships of the individual components .",
    "type 1 hedges operate on all components equally , whereas type 2 hedges differentiate between components . for example , the hedge ` essentially ' might give more weight to the most important components in a concept .",
    "type 2 hedges are further explored in @xcite , where components of a concept are categorised as _ definitional _ , _ primary _ or _ secondary _ , and the hedges ` technically ' , ` strictly speaking ' and ` loosely speaking ' are analysed in terms of these categories .",
    "although in the following we restrict ourselves to consideration of type 1 hedges only , the treatment of concepts as having different components is mirrored by the conceptual spaces view , where each component might be seen as a dimension in the conceptual space .",
    "further development of the framework may therefore allow a treatment of type 2 hedges .",
    "a further distinction between types of hedge lies in the difference between powering or shifting modifiers .",
    "powering modifiers are of the form @xmath37 , where @xmath35 refers to the hedged concept and @xmath38 is some real value , and shifting modifiers are of the form @xmath39 .",
    "zadeh introduces both types of modifier in his discussion of type 1 hedges @xcite , however his powering modifiers are most frequently cited .",
    "these are the _ concentration _ operator @xmath40 , and the _ dilation _ operator @xmath41 , which are often taken to implement the hedges ` very ' and ` quite ' , ( alternatively ` more or less ' ) , respectively .    the operators @xmath42 and @xmath43 leave the core , @xmath44 , and support @xmath45 , of the fuzzy sets unchanged , which is often argued to be undesirable @xcite .",
    "in particular , @xcite argue that in a fuzzy database , if a concentrating hedge is being used to refine a query that is returning too many objects , the hedge needs to reduce the number of objects returned , and hence narrow down the core .",
    "furthermore , @xcite find that classifiers using the @xmath42 and @xmath43 operators ( classical hedges ) do not perform as well as those with hedges that modify the core and support of the fuzzy sets .",
    "in contrast , zadeh himself argues that the core should not be altered .",
    "the application of a modifier ` very ' to a property given by a crisp set should leave that property unchanged : ` very square ' is the same as ` square ' .",
    "a fuzzy set is made up of a non - fuzzy part , the core , and a fuzzy part , @xmath46 .",
    "since the core of a fuzzy set is a crisp set , it should be left unchanged .",
    "the use of classical hedges does improve performance over non - hedged fuzzy rules in expert systems @xcite , so the argument against classical hedges is a matter of degree .",
    "the use of the @xmath42 and @xmath43 operators to model the hedges ` very ' and ` quite ' is further criticised on the basis that the modifiers are arbitrary and semantically ungrounded .",
    "no justification is given for these modifiers other than that they have what seem to be intuitively the right properties @xcite .",
    "grounding hedges semantically is important for a theoretical account of what happens when we use terms like ` very ' and also for retaining interpretability in fuzzy systems . @xcite both ground modifiers using a resemblance relation which takes into account how objects in the universe are similar to each other .",
    "@xcite takes a horizon shifting approach .    in @xcite",
    "the class of finite numbers is used as an example of the horizon shifting approach .",
    "some numbers are certainly finite , however as numbers get larger , finiteness becomes impossible to verify .",
    "mapping this idea onto the concept ` small ' , we can say that there is a class of numbers that are definitely small , say @xmath47 $ ] .",
    "as numbers get larger than @xmath48 we approach the horizon past which the concept ` small ' no longer applies , expressed as @xmath49 .",
    "so :    @xmath50 \\\\ 1 - \\epsilon(x)(x - c ) & \\text{if } x \\geq c \\end{cases}\\ ] ]    now , to implement the hedge ` very ' , the horizon @xmath48 is shifted by a factor @xmath51 and the membership function altered thus :    @xmath52 \\\\ 1 - \\epsilon(x , \\sigma)(x- \\sigma c ) & \\text{if } x \\geq   \\sigma c \\end{cases}\\ ] ]    in @xcite , examples of different kinds of membership functions that might be used to implement this idea are given .",
    "a linear membership function gives @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the upper limit of the membership function . to implement the hedge , the function @xmath55 is introduced , giving [ eqn : novak ] @xmath50 \\\\ 1 - \\frac{x - c}{a - c } & \\text{if } x \\in [ c , a]\\\\ 0 & \\text{otherwise } \\end{cases}\\ ] ] and @xmath52 \\\\ 1 - \\frac{x- \\sigma c}{\\sigma(a - c ) } & \\text{if } x   \\in [ \\sigma c , \\sigma a]\\\\ 0 & \\text{otherwise } \\end{cases}\\ ] ]    @xcite both ground their approaches in the idea of looking at the elements near a fuzzy set in order to contract or dilate the set",
    "the two approaches are similar , so we restrict ourselves to that of @xcite .",
    "this approach introduces a fuzzy resemblance relation on the universe of discourse , and either a @xmath56-norm in the case of dilation , or a fuzzy implicator for concentration . the modifier",
    "is then implemented as follows .",
    "consider a fuzzy set @xmath57 and a proximity relation @xmath58 which is approximate equality , parametrised by a fuzzy set @xmath59 .",
    "as described in @xcite , @xmath60 is modelled by @xmath61 , where @xmath59 is a fuzzy interval centred on @xmath62 with finite support . in terms of a trapezoidal membership function , @xmath59 can be expressed as @xmath63 .",
    "therefore , if @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 are judged to be approximately equal , i.e. @xmath67",
    ". the set @xmath57 is dilated by @xmath68 , where @xmath56 is any @xmath56-norm , @xmath69 being the standard .    to understand the effect that this has on a fuzzy set @xmath57 ,",
    "suppose that @xmath57 has a trapezoidal membership function @xmath70 where @xmath71 $ ] is the core of @xmath57 and @xmath72 $ ] , @xmath73 $ ] the support , and that @xmath59 similarly is @xmath63 , with the t - norm @xmath69 used",
    ". then @xmath74 .",
    "concentration is effected in a similar way : @xmath75 , where i is a fuzzy implication . if @xmath57 and @xmath59 are as above with the condition that @xmath76 , and @xmath77 is the gdel implication , then @xmath78 = @xmath79 .",
    "for example , suppose we start with a set @xmath57 described in trapezoidal notation as @xmath80 , and an approximate equality function parametrised by @xmath81 .",
    "the dilation of the set @xmath57 using t - norm @xmath69 is then :    @xmath82    the concentration of the set @xmath57 using the gdel implication is :    @xmath83    these effects are illustrated in figure [ fig : bosc_plot ] .",
    "the intuitive idea behind this approach is that if an object @xmath84 resembles another object @xmath85 that is @xmath2 , then @xmath84 can be said to be ` quite @xmath2 ' .",
    "conversely , object @xmath85 that is @xmath2 can be said to be ` very @xmath2 ' only if all the objects @xmath7 that resemble it can be said to be @xmath2 .",
    "this formulation alters both the core and support of the fuzzy set @xmath2 , which has been argued to be a desirable effect .    following @xcite",
    ", we will propose linguistic modifiers that are semantically grounded rather than attempting to show their utility in classifiers , reasoning or to examine the algebra of modifiers .",
    "our approach to linguistic modifiers arises very naturally from the label semantics framework , and the primary result does not require any parameters additional to the original membership function of the concept .",
    "we also show similarities between our model and the two detailed above .",
    "we present three formulations of linguistic hedges with increasing levels of generality .",
    "the first assumes that prototypes are equal .",
    "secondly , we show that an analogue holds where prototypes are not equal , and thirdly that these hold in the case where the second threshold is a function of the first .",
    "we go on to show similarities between our model and those of @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we show that hedges are compositional , and look at their behaviour in the limit of composition .",
    "as described in section [ sub : lsem ] , @xmath86 denotes a finite set of labels @xmath87 that agents use to describe basic categories .",

    "in this section we have shown that our general model can capture some of the many approaches found in the literature as special cases .",

    "[ exa : extremely ] suppose the label @xmath2 is as described in example [ exa : dil_plot ] , i.e. @xmath2 has prototype @xmath105 , and threshold @xmath106 uniform@xmath107 $ ] .",

    "we have contrasted the effect of the composed hedges with @xmath235 .",
    "since these hedges can be composed only an integral number of times , we can not obtain the differences in grade that could be achieved with using various powers in a powering modifier , e.g. @xmath236 .",
    "however , in section [ sub : f ] we discuss how to tune the intensity of hedges by using dependencies on functions of thresholds .",
    "we have further shown in section [ sub : det ] how to derive powering and shifting modifiers within our framework .",
    "it would be interesting to explore how other examples of hedges can be expressed in this framework .    we have shown that when multiple hedges of the forms seen in theorems [ thm : dil ] and [ thm : con ] are used , @xmath237 can be expressed purely in terms of the appropriateness of the label directly preceding it .",
    "we have not been able to find a closed form solution for this recurrence , however , we can investigate the fixed points of the recurrence and examine what happens to the values of @xmath237 as @xmath238 .",
    "we have also shown that deterministic hedges can be composed , and we go on to look at their behaviour in the limit of composition .",

    "we ca nt have @xmath244 , since we assume that @xmath254 and the sequence is strictly increasing .",
    "therefore , we must have @xmath257 and therefore @xmath242 .",

    "@xmath264 , @xmath265 .",

    "also , if @xmath250 then @xmath251 @xmath249 , and for @xmath254 , @xmath266 is a strictly decreasing sequence .    if a limit @xmath260 exists , then @xmath267    so either @xmath261 or @xmath268 . if @xmath268 then @xmath263 , which is impossible since @xmath254 and the sequence of @xmath19 is strictly decreasing . therefore    @xmath269",
    "we have shown here that in the limit , the result of applying dilation or contraction modifiers multiple times is to create a crisp set . in the case of dilation ,",
    "the crisp set includes the whole support of the fuzzy set associated with the original label , whereas in the case of contraction , the concept reduces to include only its prototype .",
    "when deterministic hedges are used , i.e. @xmath157 , the behaviour of the limit depends on the behaviour of the function @xmath224 and its properties in the limit as @xmath238 of @xmath270 .",
    "[ exa : detcom ] suppose @xmath271 . applying this hedge multiple times will result in @xmath272 . as @xmath273 , @xmath274 , except where @xmath275 .",
    "therefore , @xmath276    on the other hand , if @xmath277 , @xmath278 . as @xmath273 , @xmath279 , and hence @xmath280 @xmath98 .",
    "the behaviour of the hedges given in example [ exa : detcom ] is therefore different from those in theorems [ thm : dilcom ] and [ thm : concom ] , since the concept either shrinks to a single point , in the case of contraction , or , in the case of dilation , expands to fill the entire space @xmath0 .",
    "we have presented formulae for linguistic hedges which are both functional and semantically grounded .",
    "the modifiers presented arise naturally from the label semantics framework , in which concepts are represented by a prototype and threshold .",
    "our hedges have an intuitive meaning : if i think that the threshold for a concept ` small ' is of a certain width , then the threshold for the concept ` very small ' will be narrower . on the other hand , the threshold for the concept",
    "` quite small ' will be broader .",
    "the hedges proposed are examples of ` type 1 ' hedges , i.e. they operate equally across all dimensions of the fuzzy set associated with a concept .",
    "the first result presented is somewhat similar to a powering modifier since the core and support of the set remain the same . in @xcite , it is argued that this property is undesirable for hedges used in fuzzy expert systems , since if a query is returning too large a set of answers , this type of contraction hedge does not reduce this overabundance . however , although the hedges we propose do not at their simplest address the overabundance issue , we argue that they address another problem associated with powering hedges , in that they have a clear semantic grounding that the powering modifiers lack .",
    "@xcite also propose modifiers that are semantically grounded , using the idea of resemblance to nearby objects .",
    "their formulations have the properties that the core and support of the fuzzy set are both changed , thereby addressing the issue of overabundant answers @xcite . in our most specific case , since the prototype is not altered , the core and support of the fuzzy set representing the concept remain the same . however , our initial proposal can be generalised , as in section [ sub : diff ] , to apply to the case where @xmath281 . specifying a semantically meaningful way of altering the boundaries of the prototype",
    "would answer the objection that the core and support of a set should change under a linguistic hedge .    the most general result ( section [ sub : f ] ) shows that the formula still applies when @xmath155 , or @xmath146 .",
    "combined with a distribution @xmath199 such that the lower bound of the distribution is not zero , the core and support of the fuzzy set are modified . with the condition @xmath157 , we are able to recreate the result given in @xcite for linear membership functions , and show how the model proposed by @xcite has strong similarities to our own . in this case",
    "we have introduced additional parameters , so the simplicity of the original result is lost . however , the further parameters introduced are no more than those introduced by @xcite , and arguably fewer than those introduced by @xcite , who require that a resemblance relation be specified , using two additional parameters , and also , that a @xmath56-norm or fuzzy implication need to be specified",
    ". there are various choices of operator that could be used for either of these , and it is not obvious that any one is better than the others .    we have also shown that the basic case operators ` very ' and ` quite ' can be composed , which is not immediately obvious from the formulae ( section [ sub : comp ] ) .",
    "further , we show that in the limit of composition the membership of any object in the fuzzy part of @xmath2 , i.e. @xmath282 , increases to 1 in the case of ` quite ' or decreases to 0 in the case of ` very ' ( section [ sub : limits ] ) .",
    "this is similar to the limit of applying the powering modifiers , but differs from what would happen with the modifiers proposed by @xcite . in that case , the limit of ` very ' would shrink to a single point and the limit of ` quite ' would expand to encompass the whole universe of discourse .",
    "this can be modelled using the deterministic hedges described in section [ sub : det ] .",
    "although behaviour differs slightly , in fact human discourse does not apply modifiers infinitely , so the difference in behaviour is arguably not important .",
    "our formulation has the benefit that it can be applied in more situations than simply linguistic hedges .",
    "for example , the concept ` apple green ' has a prototype different to that of just green , and the threshold for ` apple green ' is likely to be smaller than the threshold for simply ` green ' .",
    "our model can take account of this .",
    "we have presented formulae for two simple linguistic hedges , ` very ' and ` quite ' .",
    "these formulae are functional , hence easy to compute , but also semantically grounded , in that they arise naturally from the conceptual framework of label semantics combined with prototype theory and conceptual spaces theory , and in the most specific case require no additional parameters .",
    "we have also shown that two other formulations @xcite , can be derived from this framework with equal or fewer parameters .",
    "we have shown that the hedges can be composed and have described their behaviour in the limit of composition .",
    "further work could look at testing the utility of these hedges in particular classifiers to compare their performance with the classical hedges and with the hedges used by e.g. @xcite , and also to examine a trade - off between accuracy and the number of parameters used .",
    "alternatively , investigating semantically grounded ways of expanding or reducing prototypes could have a similar impact .",
    "the model could also be extended to the more complicated type 2 hedges such as ` essentially ' , or ` technically ' , by treating dimensions of the conceptual space heterogeneously .",
    "this requires using some type of weighting or necessity measure on the dimensions , work which is currently ongoing .",
