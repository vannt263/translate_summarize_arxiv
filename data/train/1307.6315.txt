    "the ab - blg becomes upside - down ab - stacked blg ( ba - blg ) .",

    "2 ) , in good agreement with previous studies  @xcite . as these two modes involve with the interlayer interaction as well as the crystal symmetry , the sliding motion of two graphene will imprint its effect on these modes .",

    "first , we find that the sliding in ab - blg lifts the degeneracy of optical phonon modes immediately with the splitting size depending on both the sliding geometries and the symmetry of the phonon modes [ fig . 2 ] .",
    "the degeneracy is recovered when the sliding ends up in aa - blg [ fig .",
    "this finding is readily understood from the crystal symmetry of ab- and aa - blg that guarantee the degeneracy of to and lo modes for e@xmath16 and e@xmath15 phonons .",
    "however , e@xmath15 and e@xmath16 phonon modes exhibit completely different responses to the sliding because of their atomic motions ( one in - phase and the other out - of - phase ) .",
    "the frequencies of ir - active e@xmath16 phonon modes are apparently split into two modes upon sliding with a strong dependence on the sliding vectors [ fig . 2 ] . on the other hand ,",
    "the frequencies of raman - active e@xmath15 modes are seemingly unaffected at all by the sliding motion although the exact degeneracy does not hold any more as fig .",
    "2 illustrates .",
    "we observe that the splitting between to and lo phonons is as large as 20 @xmath17 for e@xmath16 mode but no more than 1 @xmath17 for e@xmath15 mode .",
    "to understand the intriguing behavior of optical phonons upon the sliding , we construct a minimal model of the phonon modes in sliding blg . from our _",
    "ab initio _",
    "calculations for in - plane atomic displacements , we find that the interlayer ion - ion interaction energy changes very little ( less than 10% ) compared with the interlayer ion - electron interaction .",
    "so , additional force constants that account for the renormalization of in - plane phonon frequencies by the interlayer electronic hopping are sufficient to include into the conventional force - constant model . within the harmonic approximation",
    ", the phonon frequency of blg ( @xmath22 for @xmath23 mode ) at @xmath14-point can be expressed as @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the frequency of @xmath26 phonon modes of slg and @xmath27 is the effective force constant for the @xmath23 phonon - renormalization owing to the interlayer electron hoppings in blg ( @xmath28 g is the mass of carbon atom )  @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian for blg with a sliding vector @xmath29  @xcite can be written as @xmath30 where the intralayer hamiltonian is @xmath31 and interlayer interaction @xmath32 . here",

    "@xmath58 are the valley and spin degeneracy , respectively , and @xmath59 is half the bz area accounting the valley degeneracy  @xcite . in eq .",
    "( 1 ) , the intralayer electron - phonon contribution [ @xmath60 of two graphene layers is subtracted from the energy of blg with phonons [ @xmath56 ] to obtain the renormalized interlayer force constant only since @xmath62 is assumed to be already renormalized intralyer phonon frequency .",
    "the interlayer force - constant @xmath63 becomes negligible for @xmath12 phonon modes regardless of sliding , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath64 .",
    "this can be demonstrated easily by shifting @xmath65 to @xmath66 and @xmath67 for lo and to @xmath12 modes in eq .",
    "( 1 ) , respectively .",
    "so , this explains the reason why sliding does not change the frequency of @xmath12 modes .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath13 modes of ab - blg without sliding , we find @xmath68 so that @xmath69 in a good agreement with our calculation in fig .",
    "2 . with sliding along @xmath70 ( @xmath71 ) , we find that @xmath72 for the lo ( to ) @xmath13 mode ( here @xmath73 is a dimensionless constant ) , which shows the splitting of two degenerate ir - active modes upon sliding as shown in fig .",
    "these calculations explain the different responses of raman - active and ir - active phonon modes in sliding blg .",
    "having understood the origin of the anomalous optical phonon splittings upon sliding , we investigate their spectroscopic consequences .",
    "our calculations readily indicate that the sliding systems have different ir reflectivity and raman spectrum when it is placed on insulating substrates with top or bottom gates .",
    "the single fano - like ir spectra of gated blg  @xcite will turn into the double - peak spectrum upon sliding because of the splitting in @xmath13 phonon frequencies . also , its anomalous splitting in raman g - band  @xcite due to mixing between @xmath12 and @xmath13 modes will be affected by sliding .",
    "the splitting of raman g - band ( or spectral transfer between opposite parity optical phonon modes ) of gated blg is known to originate from the inversion - symmetry breaking by the gate electric field  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we expect that the splitting in @xmath13 mode upon sliding will generate a more complex raman spectrum in the gated structure , _",
    "e.g. _ , a three - peak structure . while the gated structure is the most straightforward way to observe the sliding - induced splitting of optical phonons , more generic ways are desirable of detecting tiny sliding on arbitrary substrates without the need of heavy doping using the field - effect transistor structure .",

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the position of raman g - band of sliding blg does not change at all for all sliding configurations , but the change in the crystal symmetry produces very interesting movement of the raman intensity .",
    "in order to calculate the non - resonant stocks raman intensity of g - band , we used the placzek approximation for the raman intensity ( @xmath76 ) as @xmath77 is the raman tensor , @xmath78 and @xmath79 are the polarization of the incident and scattered lights , respectively  @xcite .",

    "we directly calculate the derivative of @xmath86 with respect to the atomic displacements corresponding to the @xmath84-th modes .",
    "assuming an incident light with an energy of 2.41 ev , calculated raman tensors for various sliding geometries are summarized in table i together with corresponding crystal - symmetry groups and vibrational symmetries  @xcite .",
    "our calculations of raman tensors for ab - blg and aa - blg reproduce the well - known results with @xmath12 and @xmath26 symmetries  @xcite . upon sliding ,",
    "changes in the crystal symmetry produce correspondingly distinctive raman tensors . with @xmath89 , the polarized raman intensity for ab - blg",
    "is given as @xmath90 so that the intensity does not depend on the polarization angle @xmath91 [ fig .",
    "3(a ) ]  @xcite .",
    "this behavior is also the same for aa - blg while with a different intensity .",
    "when the sliding direction ( @xmath92 ) is along @xmath93 , the polarized raman intensity is given as @xmath94 ( @xmath95 , and @xmath96 are given in table i and @xmath97 is a constant ) .",
    "@xmath98 has an elliptic shape for @xmath99 or quadrupolar form otherwise as shown in fig .",
    "3 . when @xmath2 deviates from the direction of @xmath100 , the polarized intensity tends to rotate as shown in fig .",
    "in case that the overall shape of the polarized intensity looks similar , its magnitude has a strong dependence on the sliding size [ fig.3 ( b ) ] .    , ( b ) @xmath101 , and ( c ) @xmath102 directions .",
    "the panels in the left show the raman intensity normalized to that of ab - blg as a function of polarization angle ( @xmath91 ) and small rectangular pannels on the right show corresponding polar plots . ]",
    "in conclusion , we have shown theoretically that tiny sliding of the layers in blgs can induce anomalous splitting of optical phonon that changes the spectroscopic features significantly .",
    "we have shown that the frequencies of the degenerate in - phase optical phonons ( @xmath103 mode ) are hardly changed irrespective of sliding distance and direction .",
    "on the other hand , the polarization - dependent raman intensity associated with @xmath103 mode is modified strongly so that the sub - angstrom misalignment between two graphene layers can be resolved by spectroscopic methods .",
    "we expect that this study will provide essential information for spectroscopic measurements and for linking local atomic structures to novel electronic properties of stacked 2d atomic crystals .",
    "we calculated electronic structures and phonon dispersions of the sliding blgs using first - principles methods with a plane - wave basis set  @xcite .",

    "the basis - set superposition errors were removed by including two ghost atoms in the unit cell  @xcite .",
    "a semi - empirical correction of van der waals ( vdw ) forces is added to all our calculations following grimme s proposal , which is essential to obtain the correct interlayer distance of sliding blgs  @xcite .",
