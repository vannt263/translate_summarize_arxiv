    "the @xmath0 vertices of the original ( `` basic '' ) @xmath0-gon will be called _ corners _ , and they will be denoted ( say , clockwise ) by @xmath7 ( with arithmetic modulo  @xmath0 in the first index , so that @xmath8 ) .",

    "the set of triangulations of a point set @xmath15 will be denoted by @xmath16 .",
    "triangulations of ( structures equivalent or related to ) subdivided convex polygons have appeared in earlier work .",
    "hurtado and noy @xcite considered triangulations of _ almost convex polygons _ , which turn out to be equivalent to subdivided convex polygons according to our terminology .",
    "they dealt with the non - balanced case  that is , @xmath0-gons whose sides are subdivided , but not necessarily into the same number of points . in particular , hurtado and noy derived an inclusion - exclusion formula for the number of triangulations of a subdivided convex @xmath0-gon whose sides are subdivided by @xmath17 points , and they showed that this number is independent of the specific distribution of the subdivisions among the sides of the basic @xmath0-gon .",
    "on the other hand , bacher and mouton  @xcite considered triangulations of more general _ nearly convex polygons _ defined as infinitesimal perturbations of subdivided convex polygons .",
    "they derived a formula for the number of triangulations of such polygons in terms of certain polynomials that depend on the shape of chains .",
    "the main purpose of the present paper is to present enumeration formulas and precise asymptotic results for the number of triangulations of a subdivided convex polygon in the balanced case , that is , where each side of the polygon is subdivided into the same number of points .",
    "our enumeration formulas are more compact than those of hurtado and noy or of bacher and mouton when specialised to the balanced case",
    ". we shall as well provide formulas for some non - balanced cases .",

    "for @xmath18 our configuration is just a convex @xmath0-gon , and , thus , @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the @xmath21th catalan number .",
    "it is easy to find @xmath22 for small values of @xmath0 and @xmath2 by inspection .",
    "for example , we have @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 ; see figure  [ fig : b24 ] ( there , symmetries must also be taken into account ; for each triangulation it is shown how many different triangulations can be obtained from it under symmetries ) .",
    "values of @xmath22 for @xmath26 , @xmath27 are shown in table  [ tab : values ] ; the meaning of these values for @xmath28  the central binomial coefficients  will be explained in section  [ sec : formula ] ( see the remark after the proof of theorem  [ thm : formel ] ) .",
    "the sequence @xmath29 is oeis / a086452 , while the sequence @xmath30 is oeis / a087809  @xcite .    in the next section ,",
    "we derive our formulas for the numbers @xmath22 .",
    "they are given in the form of double sums , see theorem  [ thm : formel ] , thus answering an open question posed in  @xcite .",
    "these formulas come from a representation of @xmath22 in terms of a complex contour integral ( see proposition  [ prop : formel ] ) , when interpreted as a coefficient extraction formula .",
    "we use this integral representation to prove in section  [ sec : gf ] that the  vertical \" generating functions @xmath31 as well as the  horizontal \" generating functions @xmath32 are all algebraic .",
    "more precisely , we find explicit expressions for these generating functions in terms of roots of certain ( explicit ) polynomials .",
    "we devote a separate section , section  [ sec : k=3 ] , to the special case @xmath33 , since in that case several alternative formulas that are more attractive than the formulas in theorem  [ thm : formel ] are available .",
    "moreover , in section  [ sec : abc ] we also consider the _ non - balanced _ case of @xmath33 : we count triangulations of a triangle whose sides are subdivided by @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 points , respectively . the resulting compact formulas are presented in propositions  [ prop : abc_all ] and  [ prop : abc_bl ] .",
    "then , in section  [ sec : asy ] , we determine the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath22 as @xmath2 and/or @xmath0 tend to infinity , see theorems  [ thm : rinf ] and  [ thm : kinf ] .",
    "this is achieved by transforming the contour integral into a complex integral along a line in the complex plane parallel to the imaginary axis that passes through the saddle point of the integrand . in the final section  [ sec : dc ] ,",
    "we connect our results with a well - known open problem from computational geometry : the problem of determining a planar set of @xmath21 points in general position with the minimum number of triangulations .",
    "we show that our results support a conjecture of aichholzer , hurtado and noy @xcite that this minimum is attained by the so - called _",
    "double circle_.    [ tab : values ]",
    "in this section we derive two  very similar  double sum formulas for @xmath22 , given in and .",
    "starting point for finding these double sum expressions is the inclusion - exclusion formula , which is equivalent to that found in  @xcite and in  @xcite .",
    "we include its derivation for the sake of completeness .",
    "we start by `` inflating '' .",
    "that is , we replace its strings by slightly curved circular arcs so that a set of @xmath6 points in convex position is obtained .",
    "we keep the labels for these points .",
    "denote this point set by @xmath37 .",
    "it is easy to see that each triangulation of is transformed into a triangulation of @xmath37 , see figure  [ fig : ex_hex_inj ] .     from @xmath38",
    "to @xmath39    more formally , this  inflation \" defines a natural injection @xmath40 from @xmath38 to @xmath41 : for each @xmath42 , triangulation @xmath43 uses the diagonals with the same labels as @xmath44 .",
    "thus @xmath22 is the size of the image of @xmath45 .",
    "we say that a triangulation of @xmath46 is _ legal _ if it belongs to the image of @xmath45  that is , corresponds to a ( unique ) triangulation of .",
    "it is easy to see the following .",
    "[ obs : legal_tr ] let @xmath47 be a triangulation of @xmath46 .",
    "@xmath47 is legal if and only if it uses no diagonal whose endpoints belong to the same string ( that is , to the set @xmath48 for some @xmath49 ) .",
    "we call the diagonals mentioned in observation  [ obs : legal_tr ] _ forbidden _ , and we need to exclude triangulations that contain them from the set of all the triangulations of @xmath46 .",
    "notice , however , that , if a triangulation of @xmath46 uses some forbidden diagonal , then it necessarily ( also ) uses a forbidden diagonal that connects two points at distance @xmath50 along the boundary of @xmath46 .",
    "therefore , the characterization of legal triangulations from observation  [ obs : legal_tr ] can be simplified as follows .",
    "[ obs : legal_tr_2 ] let @xmath47 be a triangulation of @xmath46 .",
    "@xmath47 is legal if and only if it uses no diagonal of the form @xmath51 with @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "we call the diagonals mentioned in observation  [ obs : legal_tr ] _ essentially forbidden_. figure  [ fig : ex_forb_diag ] shows ( a ) forbidden and ( b ) essentially forbidden diagonals of @xmath54 .    . ]",
    "thus , we need to exclude triangulations of @xmath46 that use essentially forbidden diagonals .",
    "the total number of essentially forbidden diagonals is @xmath55 , but the neighbouring essentially forbidden diagonals ( that is , @xmath51 and @xmath56 for some @xmath49 and @xmath57 with @xmath52 and @xmath58 ) can not coexist in the same triangulation of @xmath46 .",
    "thus , the number of possible choices of @xmath59 essentially forbidden diagonals from the same string , where @xmath60 , equals the number of @xmath59-subsets of @xmath61 that do not contain adjacent numbers .",
    "this is a simple exercise in elementary combinatorics , and the answer is @xmath62 .",
    "therefore , the number of ways to choose @xmath63 pairwise non - crossing essentially forbidden diagonals in @xmath46 is @xmath64 \\left(\\sum_{\\ell = 0}^{\\lfloor r/2 \\rfloor } \\binom{r-\\ell}{\\ell } x^{\\ell } \\right)^k,\\ ] ] where @xmath65f(x)$ ] denotes the coefficient of @xmath66 in the polynomial of formal power series @xmath67 .",
    "once @xmath63 essentially forbidden diagonals of @xmath46 are chosen , we are left with a convex @xmath68-gon to be triangulated .",
    "therefore , the number of illegal triangulations that use at least @xmath63 essentially forbidden diagonals is @xmath69 . at this point",
    "we can apply the inclusion - exclusion principle and obtain @xmath70    next , we observe that @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the @xmath2th chebyshev polynomial of the second kind .",
    "thus , @xmath73 \\left ( x^{r/2 } \\ , u_r\\left ( \\frac{1}{2 \\sqrt{x}}\\right ) \\right)^k,\\ ] ] and can be rewritten as @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the generating function for catalan numbers .",
    "since an explicit form of @xmath72 is @xmath76 it follows that @xmath77    using cauchy s integral formula , we may write this expression in terms of a complex contour integral , namely as @xmath78 where @xmath79 is a small contour encircling the origin once in positive direction .",
    "next we perform the substitution @xmath80 , in which case @xmath81 .",
    "this leads us to the following integral representation of our numbers @xmath22 .",

    "the above described substitution in , we arrive at @xmath85 where @xmath86 is a(nother ) contour close to the origin encircling the origin once in positive direction . in order to obtain the more symmetric form ( with respect to the substitution @xmath87 ) in",
    ", we blow up the contour @xmath86 so that it is sent to infinity . while doing this , we must pass over the pole @xmath88 of the integrand .",
    "( the point @xmath89 is a removable singularity of the integrand . )",
    "this must be compensated by taking the residue at @xmath88 into account .",
    "the integrand is of the order @xmath90 as @xmath91 , and even of the order @xmath92 if @xmath2 is odd .",
    "together , this means that the integrand is of the order @xmath93 as @xmath94 for @xmath82 .",
    "hence , the integral along the contour near infinity vanishes .",
    "thus , we obtain @xmath95 where @xmath79 is a contour close to @xmath84 , which encircles @xmath84 once in positive direction .",
    "we have thus obtained two ( slightly ) different expressions for @xmath22 , namely and .",
    "thus , @xmath22 is also equal to their arithmetic mean .",
    "if this is worked out , after having substituted @xmath96 for @xmath97 in , one arrives at .",
    "we are now in the position to derive explicit formulas for @xmath22 in terms of binomial double sums .",

    "indeed , one can construct a bijection between such triangulations and balanced sequences over @xmath109 using the same idea as in the proof of theorem  [ prop : abc_all](1 ) below .",
    "see figure  [ fig : cbc ] which illustrates this bijection for @xmath110 .    .",

    "however , this is not the case for triangulations : in  @xcite , aichholzer , hurtado and noy presented a configuration , which they called _",
    "double circle _ , and which has less triangulations than sets of the same size ( that is , with the same number of points ) in convex position .",
    "indeed , as was shown by santos and seidel in  @xcite , the double circle of size @xmath21 has @xmath331 triangulations .",
    "it was proven by exhaustive computations  @xcite that , for @xmath332 , ( only ) the double circle of size @xmath21 has the minimal number of triangulations over all point sets of size @xmath21 in general position .",

    "recently proved that , for all point sets of size @xmath21 in general position , the number of triangulations is @xmath333 ( the first result of this kind , @xmath334 , was proven in  @xcite ) .",
    "next we recall the definition of the double circle of size @xmath21 , which we denote by @xmath335 . for the sake of simplicity , we restrict ourselves to even @xmath21 . in this case , @xmath335 consists of @xmath336 points , denoted by @xmath337 , in convex position ; and @xmath338 points , @xmath339 , such that for each @xmath49 , @xmath340 , @xmath341 lies in the interior of the convex hull of @xmath342 , very ( `` infinitesimally '' ) close to the midpoint of @xmath343 . ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : dc](a ) shows @xmath344 and one of its triangulations .",

    "therefore we refer to them as _",
    "unavoidable edges_. in figure  [ fig : dc ] , unavoidable edges are shown in blue colour . this observation leads to a simple bijection between @xmath347 and @xmath348 : given a triangulation of @xmath335 , move all the points @xmath341 `` outwards '' , until they lie on the segments @xmath343 .",
    "thus , from this point of view , triangulations of @xmath335 are equivalent to triangulations of @xmath349 , and the above cited bound @xmath350 is a special case of our theorem  [ thm : kinf ] for @xmath137 , @xmath351 .",
    "our goal was to investigate whether the number of triangulations can decrease if one inserts more points between the corners .",
    "a similar idea , applied to the so - called _",
    "double chain _",
    ", led to an improvement of the lower bound on the _ maximum _ number of triangulations  @xcite and of perfect matchings  @xcite .",
    "let us define our construction precisely . for fixed @xmath0 and @xmath2 , we take @xmath352 and slightly pull the inner points of the strings into the convex hull so that , after this transformation , they lie on circular arcs of sufficiently big radius .",
    "this radius is chosen so that the orientation of triples of points which do not belong to the same string is not changed .",
    "see figure  [ fig : dc](b ) for an illustration .",
    "we refer to this construction as _",
    "indented @xmath352 _ and denote it by @xmath353 .",

    "the analysis of the number of triangulations of @xmath353 is now easy : we have @xmath357 . by our asymptotic result in theorem  [ thm : kinf ]",
    ", we see that the exponential growth factor of the number of triangulations of @xmath352 as @xmath327  and thus the total number @xmath358 of points tends to infinity  is @xmath359 . rather than for @xmath360 . ]",
    "hence the growth factor for the number of triangulations of @xmath353 equals @xmath361 .",
    "this expression is minimal for @xmath137 , that is , for the double circle . if , on the other hand , we keep @xmath0 fixed and let @xmath2 tend to infinity",
    " so that again the total number @xmath358 of points tends to infinity  then similar reasoning using our asymptotic result in theorem  [ thm : rinf ] leads to the conclusion that the exponential growth factor of the number of triangulations of @xmath353 is  @xmath362 .",
    "thus , somewhat disappointingly , the asymptotic count of @xmath363 attained by @xmath364 can not be improved by using balanced generalizations of the double circle , in whatever way @xmath365 .",
    "let us return to the case of fixed @xmath2 and @xmath360 .",
    "as stated above , the exponential growth factor in this case is @xmath366 . as @xmath367",
    ", we have @xmath368 and @xmath369 , in both cases monotonically for @xmath5 .",
    "thus , the fact @xmath370 can be interpreted intuitively as follows : when we pass from @xmath18 to @xmath137 , the former expression decreases , while the @xmath0 regions in convex position are just triangles with the unique ( trivial ) triangulation , and so there is no extra factor . on the other hand , for @xmath371 these @xmath0 regions",
    "are convex quadrilaterals with two triangulations , and , as calculations above show , their `` positive '' contribution to the total number of triangulations already dominates over the `` negative '' contribution of the central region . for @xmath372 ,",
    "this tendency holds monotonically , and , thus , @xmath373 has its minimum at @xmath137 .",
    "however , if one extends the expression @xmath373 for _ real _ values of @xmath2 by using the gamma function in the definition of catalan numbers ( namely , @xmath374 ) , one can observe that @xmath373 has its minimum not at @xmath137 but rather at @xmath375 .",
    "this may lead to the idea that , perhaps , we may get less triangulations if we ",

    "we denote this partially subdivided polygon by @xmath379 , and its number of triangulations by @xmath380 .",
    "( recall from the introduction that , by @xcite , this number does not depend on the specific distribution of the subdivisions among the sides of the polygon . )    proceeding in analogy with the inclusion - exclusion argument in section  [ sec : formula ] , we observe that the number of ways to choose @xmath63 pairwise non - crossing essentially forbidden diagonals in @xmath379 is @xmath381 .",
    "once @xmath63 essentially forbidden diagonals of @xmath379 are chosen , we are left with a convex @xmath382-gon to be triangulated .",

    "we apply the inclusion - exclusion principle to get @xmath384 thus , the analogue of in the current context reads @xmath385 where @xmath79 is a small contour encircling the origin once in positive direction .",
