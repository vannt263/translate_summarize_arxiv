    "based on relativistic simulations incorporating force - free electromagnetic fields , @xcite suggest that mergers of supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) which occur in the presence of an accretion disk may have significant poynting flux",
    ". this poynting flux may be detectable as an electromagnetic ( em ) counterpart to the gravitational wave ( gw ) signature of the merger ( other mechanisms have been proposed as direct and indirect electromagnetic signatures of merger ; see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "these mergers will also produce gw signatures , accessible to the _ laser interferometer space antenna _ ( _ lisa _ ) ( for bh masses @xmath5 in the range @xmath6m_\\odot$ ] ) and for exceptionally low masses to ground - based gw detectors ( @xmath7 ; see , e.g. , @xcite ) . whether measured via gw or em ,",
    "the measured merger history will strongly constrain our understanding of the formation and evolution of supermassive black holes ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .    only recently",
    "have radio surveys moved beyond inhomogeneous archival data sets to systematic examinations of the variable sky ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the situation will continue to improve .",
    "advances in receivers and digital processing make instantaneous fields - of - view of @xmath8 possible at ghz frequencies , enabling repeated surveys of wide areas of the sky .",
    "these technologies are being implemented as part of square kilometer array pathfinders under construction @xcite .    while all searches for compact object mergers have so far been negative ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the improving performance of both gravitational ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and electromagnetic surveys increases the discovery potential for a wide range of events . in this _",
    "letter _ we consider the detectability of the merger event with radio surveys centered near frequencies of 1ghz .",
    "we show that the flare itself is very unlikely to be detected in the current generation of radio surveys , largely independent of the amount of em flux emitted .",
    "however , prior to the flare there could be other modulation present which may be detectable . in what follows ,",
    "we use a flat @xmath9cdm cosmology with @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "@xcite simulated the merger of two @xmath12 bhs . they found a flare of poynting flux ( with @xmath13 over @xmath14 hours ) that occurred at the same time as the gw emission peaked .",
    "they also found lower - level emission before the flare ( @xmath15 ) . @xcite interpreted the pre - merger secular emission as two steady jets powered by the motion of each black hole through the background magnetic field , with luminosity @xmath16 .",
    "for unequal masses , we physically expect the luminosity to be provided by the faster , smaller black hole moving through the magnetic field .",
    "using the model of @xcite , if the more massive black hole has mass @xmath5 and the less massive has mass @xmath17 , we expect a luminosity @xmath18 .",
    "the choice of magnetic field directly affects the electromagnetic luminosities inferred from these simulations .",
    "conservatively , @xcite chose a magnetic field that limited their jet luminosity to a small fraction @xmath19 of the eddington luminosity at merger . ) is substantially smaller than the magnetic field created by the magneto - rotational instability ( mri ) at the inner edge of the circumbinary disk , which we estimate to be @xmath20 @xcite . rather than adopt this large circumbinary field",
    ", we implicitly absorb uncertainties into the ill - determined efficiency @xmath21 . ]",
    "we adopt the same assumption : a jet luminosity limited to a small fraction @xmath22 of the eddington limit at the merger event : @xmath23 for @xmath24 , while for other mass ratios we assume that @xmath25 .",
    "given the expected range of magnetic fields ( @xmath26 g , with black hole masses going from @xmath27 to @xmath28 ) , electrons advected with the flow might emit synchrotron radiation near 1 ghz , as mentioned by @xcite .",
    "thus , the merger flare could be a distinctive radio signature out to cosmologically significant distances : @xmath29 ( corresponding to @xmath30 ) where for simplicity we assume @xmath31 . in this expression , rather than model the emission mechanism ( i.e. , spectrum , beaming ) in detail , we assume a fraction @xmath32 of this energy is emitted isotropically in radio frequencies .",
    "given the modest lorentz factor and magnetic field , beaming is not likely to be too strong . as much as possible in what follows , we attempt to give results that are independent of @xmath32 .",
    "though the emission _ spectrum",
    "_ is uncertain , the emission _ duration _ is not : it scales with the total mass of the system , as it depends on the orbital timescale near merger . based on @xcite",
    ", we estimate the merger flare duration by @xmath33 we adopt this estimate for all mass ratios , since the orbital ( and hence merger ) timescale is determined by the more massive bh .      to assess the visibility of merger flares , we employ a merger rate distribution that depends on black hole masses and redshift .",
    "as each comparable - mass merger doubles the black hole mass , given the masses and growth timescales over which they assemble , the supermassive black hole merger rate must be both low , less than @xmath34 , and strongly biased towards low - mass mergers : only a few merger events occur per year on our past light cone .",
    "the assembly of smbhs is reconstructed through monte - carlo merger simulations , following the hierarchical structure formation paradigm .",
    "these models evolve the bh population starting from bh `` seeds , '' through accretion episodes triggered by galaxy mergers , and include the dynamical evolution of smbh - smbh binaries .",
    "the smbh population is consistent with observational constraints , e.g. , the luminosity function of quasars at @xmath35 , the @xmath36 relation and the bh mass density at @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "we adopt two of the fiducial merger distributions used in @xcite : models le and se , where s versus l refers to the seed size ",
    "large or small  and e refers to `` efficient '' accretion ; see @xcite .",
    "these models are representative of a range of plausible smbh growth scenarios . as with uncertainties in @xmath32",
    ", we attempt to make our conclusions robust to specific merger assumptions .",
    "figure [ fig : mergers ] shows the total merger rate as a function of bh mass , integrating over redshifts 010 . only a few mergers per year are expected , even from low - mass ( @xmath38 ) systems . this rate is relevant to untriggered searches by all - sky detectors such as gw observatories ( ligo , _ lisa _ ) , which survey the entire sky with roughly uniform sensitivity at high duty cycle . for simplicity , in what follows we will provide quantitative results primarily for the le model ; results from the two models are comparable for the purposes of this discussion    for limited - aperture surveys , other factors limit the detectable fraction of events ( see the discussion in @xcite , for example ) . ignoring any flux limits , two effects are important . first , surveys only cover a fraction of the sky @xmath39 , with smaller coverage in each pointing .",
    "for example , the curvature of the earth restricts telescopes at temperate latitudes to @xmath40% ; individual surveys will cover less .",
    "second , surveys return to the same area of the sky with a specific cadence @xmath41 . a telescope which surveys a single area continuously ( i.e.",
    ", field - of - view @xmath42 ) has @xmath43 .",
    "more commonly @xmath44 and the telescope spends time doing other tasks . for instance , a survey might cover @xmath45 with 333 pointings of @xmath46 , each lasting @xmath47 .",
    "the survey finishes in @xmath48 ( the smallest possible cadence ) .",
    "if the survey returns to each individual pointing 24hr later , the cadence is @xmath49 .    with such a survey ,",
    "the fraction of events that can be detected is the fraction that happen to occur when observations are ongoing : @xmath50 $ ] , assuming @xmath51 is much longer than both each pointing and any dispersive delay across the bandpass ( see   [ sec : gw ] ) and simplifying the flare emission as either on or off ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : mergers ] we illustrate how this simple cadence cutoff reduces the fraction of low - mass merger flares that could be found on the past light cone of a survey with cadences @xmath52 1 day , 1 hour , and 10 seconds .",
    "though many low - mass mergers should occur , the short durations of their merger flares makes them nearly impossible to identify .    in the le ( se ) model",
    ", the total number of mergers on our past light cone ( summing over all redshifts , mass ratios , and masses ) is about 24 ( 39 ) per year .",
    "a survey with @xmath53s cadence would recover most of the events , as even the short low - mass events are sufficiently stretched by cosmology that they would be visible for @xmath54 .",
    "however , a 1h survey is only expected to see 3 ( 2 ) mergers per year out to @xmath55 over the whole sky ; surveys with finite area will see correspondingly fewer . restricting the cadence to 1d reduces the accessible number further , to @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "so far , we have only counted the number of mergers on the light cone of our survey . using the predicted luminosities from @xcite",
    ", we provide in figure  [ fig : mergersflux ] the cumulative rate of events greater than a flux threshold for a limiting cadence of 1s ( to make the numerous low - mass mergers visible ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : mergersflux ] shows that merger flares are rare events ; the flux density corresponding to @xmath58 over the whole sky is only 0.13mjy ( assuming efficiencies of @xmath59 and @xmath22 ) .",
    "the brightest events ( tens of mjy ) are extremely rare and come from high - mass mergers , generally at moderately high redshift .    in this figure , we have also limited the maximum possible duration of a merger flare to @xmath60s ( roughly 12 days ) .",
    "longer events are both rare  excluding them changes little  and will be increasingly difficult to localize in time and separate from systematic trends .",
    "because high - mass mergers are rare ( though long - lasting ) and low - mass mergers produce short and faint flares ( though common ) , the rate of potentially detectable merger flares is small .",
    "even with optimistic choices for the efficiencies @xmath32 and @xmath21 , we expect @xmath3 merger per year with the surveys to be conducted in the next decade , consistent with zero detections to date",
    ". greater flux sensitivity will not increase the detectable rate substantially , as the finite numbers and short timescales limit detectability .",
    "our results depend only weakly on the assumed merger rate : while the low - mass and low - redshift merger rates are weakly constrained observationally , their merger flares will rarely be visible .    in the radio ,",
    "ongoing and planned wide - field surveys have instantaneous fields - of - view of @xmath61 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) at ghz frequencies ( this increases to several hundreds or even 1000deg@xmath62 at a few hundred mhz ) . some have relatively frequent sampling , and cover the same area of the sky on timescales from minutes to months , but generally only cover a total of @xmath63 .",
    "surveys that cover a wider area will likely have a cadence of at least 1day .",
    "none has the combination of a very rapid cadence ( ideally @xmath64min ) and very wide sky coverage ( @xmath65 ) that are likely necessary to detect a flare blindly , especially with a required sensitivity of @xmath66mjy .",
    "since the instantaneous fields - of - view and cadences of planned optical surveys are typically less than or comparable to those of radio surveys and the cadence considerations are independent of wavelength , optical surveys will be unlikely to discover events like these . only at x - ray and @xmath67-ray energies would planned instrumentation be well - suited to the timescales and rates of merger flares , although the low fluxes ( @xmath68 at a redshift of 0.1 ) might require a next - generation mission to be detectable .",
    "while figure  [ fig : mergersflux ] suggests that radio flares associated with mergers will be difficult to detect , next - generation surveys may reach limits more amenable to detections .",
    "we should consider how merger flares could be identified as such and what physics may be learned from them .",
    "unlike many proposed counterparts to smbh mergers , this prompt emission mechanism might allow coincident detection of electromagnetic and gw signals from the same event , even though the circumbinary disk is evacuated and no accretion onto the compact objects takes place .",
    "spatial and temporal coincidence can confirm that a radio transient is indeed the signature of a binary smbh merger .",
    "as reviewed in @xcite , coincident electromagnetic and gravitational signals provide an independent cosmological distance ladder , if accessible at cosmological distances @xcite .",
    "additionally , nearby em counterparts might be localized to individual host galaxies , allowing study of galaxy - smbh relations @xcite .",
    "in contrast with electromagnetic surveys , gw detectors have roughly uniform all - sky sensitivity at all times and a signal that is visible long before merger . using the gw signal as a trigger , electromagnetic observations would be freed of the need to survey the whole sky continuously ; followup observations would be limited by flux thresholds alone . here ,",
    "the large pointing uncertainties on current - generation gw facilities ( ideally @xmath69 for a @xmath70 smbh merger with signal - to - noise of 8 ; e.g. , @xcite ) will make optical follow - up difficult ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but are well suited to the fields - of - view of instruments such as askap @xcite . moreover , the gw signal may allow identification of an impending merger well in advance . for prime _",
    "lisa_-scale sources ( @xmath71 ) , the sky location of an inspiralling binary can be located to within @xmath72 hours to weeks before the merger event ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . for the merger trees discussed in this paper ,",
    "this translates to several events per year ( slightly less than @xmath73 of all _ lisa_-detectable events ) that can be localized this precisely @xcite . for an optimistic conversion of electromagnetic to radio energy , followup pointings will identify all _ lisa _ events with a flare only if they reach a flux sensitivity @xmath74 .",
    "less sensitive followup observations will recover only a fraction of events : roughly @xmath75 $ ] events per year for @xmath76 and our fiducial efficiencies , including all mass ratios .    for lower - mass mergers ( @xmath77 ) , ground - based gw detectors will not identify a sky location before the gw merger signal . nonetheless , if quickly processed , their sky localization can still help target em followup , as dispersion delays the em signal .",
    "plasma dispersion will occur in the milky way , in the host galaxy of the smbh , and along the line - of - sight in the intergalactic medium .",
    "for cosmological sources the total dispersion measure ( dm , the integral of the electron column density ) may reach @xmath78 @xcite .",
    "this implies a time delay @xmath79 , requiring rapid localization and repointing . even for short flares with modest dispersions",
    ", such a delay would be hard to detect , but it is possible if the radio cadence is sufficiently short or the observing frequency low",
    ". it may also be possible to detect dispersion within the radio data itself , by measuring the relative delays of different frequencies across a bandpass of width @xmath80 ( @xmath81 ) .",
    "this is more difficult , since across a finite bandpass the relative delay is even smaller , but is routinely done ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in fact , for very low mass events @xmath82 dispersive smearing will exceed @xmath51 , but this will not greatly change figure  [ fig : mergers ] .",
    "however , matching this `` internal '' delay with that relative to gw observations could prove a powerful confirmation of the nature of the event .",
    "second - generation ground - based gw detectors will be sensitive to the lowest - mass mergers ( @xmath83 ) out to a strongly mass- and orientation- dependent threshold @xmath84 .",
    "the associated em flares will be short ( dispersion - limited ) and faint . with the most optimistic efficiencies @xmath85 , radio surveys would have comparable reach to gw surveys at @xmath86 ( eqn .",
    "[ eq : scalefac ] ) ; with less efficient conversion or followup , fewer coincident events can be found . unfortunately , unlike smbh mergers , observations",
    "do not directly constrain such merging binaries . the low - mass mergers",
    "to which ground - based detectors are sensitive simply may not occur .",
    "even if they do , both gw and radio observations are sensitive to a minute fraction of the universe ( not true for third - generation gw detectors ; @xcite ) . that said ,",
    "if radio surveys can distinguish short ( @xmath64s ) flares in targeted observations , ground - based gw detectors working in concert with radio telescopes can rule out extremely optimistic ( @xmath87 ) low - mass smbh merger rates and efficiencies .      while the rate of potentially detectable mergers is small , other em emission associated with binary smbh inspiral could be detectable .",
    "em emission from smbhs is well known across a range of wavelengths ; radio emission from active galactic nuclei is common .",
    "we differentiate between generic agn emission and that associated with an orbiting pair of smbh through the time domain .",
    "agn do vary intrinsically but mostly aperiodically ; detecting such periodic behavior in a radio light curve would be a strong indication of an inspiralling smbh pair ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; we defer additional methods for confirmation to a forthcoming paper ( oshaughnessy et al .",
    "2011 , in prep . ) .",
    "a number of binary agn are known or suspected ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "most of these have evidence from a resolved pair of bright spots or a double set of emission lines , but they all probe systems far from actual merger @xcite .",
    "we consider what might happen as the systems approach merger .",
    "variability will happen over a range of timescales .",
    "first , even before the merger the em flux of the system is expected to increase as @xmath88 @xcite , where @xmath89 traces the increasing orbital speed during inspiral , going to a maximum of @xmath90 at the innermost stable circular orbit , and with a singularity at merger ( @xmath91 ) .",
    "the flux increase will be secular and may be detectable , but the timescales over which it changes appreciably are likely either too long ( during the lengthy inspiral ) or too short ( right before merger ) , and will be difficult to identify uniquely .    a promising candidate is variability induced by precession ( also see @xcite for a related discussion ) .",
    "if there is a poynting flux associated with a jet , as in @xcite , the axis of this jet could precess if the bh spins are not aligned with the orbital angular momentum .",
    "this would presumably cause the em signal to vary on that timescale ( although it could be more complicated ; @xcite ) .",
    "the precession timescale is expected to be @xmath92 @xcite .",
    "the scale of the variations is not known ( it depends on the anisotropy of the emission ) , but could easily be @xmath93% .",
    "while a full treatment is beyond the scope of this paper , we are drawn to consider the detectability of precessing jets in binary smbhs for two reasons .",
    "first , the time spent at a moderate velocity @xmath94 compared to the duration of the merger itself is large , scaling as @xmath95 . a much larger number of systems exist in this state compared to those merging ; their timescales are more amenable to detection .",
    "second , a system will undergo many precession cycles , so periodic modulation may be detectable ( along with other changes , such as secular increase or orbital modulation ) ; we expect @xmath96 periods to be visible in a roughly logarithmic velocity range .",
    "precession has likely been seen in galactic bh binaries @xcite , and does have observational consequences for the jet emission . in a future paper ( oshaughnessy et al .",
    ", in prep ) , we will discuss the detectability of binary smbh jet precession in detail .",
