    "<S> we report on new broad band spectral and temporal observations of the magnetar 1e 2259 + 586 , which is located in the supernova remnant ctb 109 . </S>",
    "<S> our data were obtained simultaneously with the _ nuclear spectroscopic telescope array ( nustar ) _ and _ swift _ , and cover the energy range from @xmath0  kev . </S>",
    "<S> we present pulse profiles in various energy bands and compare them to previous _ </S>",

    "<S> the _ nustar _ </S>",
    "<S> data show pulsations above @xmath1  kev for the first time and we report evidence that one of the pulses in the double - peaked pulse profile shifts position with energy . </S>",
    "<S> the pulsed fraction of the magnetar is shown to increase strongly with energy . </S>",
    "<S> our spectral analysis reveals that the soft x - ray spectrum is well characterized by an absorbed double - blackbody or blackbody plus power - law model in agreement with previous reports . our new hard x - ray data , </S>",
    "<S> however , suggests that an additional component , such as a power - law , is needed to describe the _ nustar _ and _ swift _ spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> we also fit the data with the recently developed coronal outflow model by beloborodov ( 2013a ) for hard x - ray emission from magnetars . </S>",
    "<S> the outflow from a ring on the magnetar surface is statistically preferred over outflow from a polar cap . </S>"
