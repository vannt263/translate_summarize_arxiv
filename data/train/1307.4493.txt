    "trapped fermionic atoms with tunable interactions have opened up possibilities to study novel phenomena in quantum fluids .",
    "in particular , superfluidity in strongly - interacting fermion systems is one of the most important areas of research due to its relevance to high-@xmath2 superconductivity , neutron matters , and so on .",
    "so far @xmath3-wave feshbach resonances have been widely used to study the crossover between a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) and a bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) superfluid @xcite .",
    "recently , it has become possible to derive the thermodynamic properties of uniform fermions with a divergent @xmath3-wave scattering length from the thermodynamics of a harmonically trapped system , enabling the direct comparison of experimental results with many - body theories @xcite .",
    "not only can the strength and the sign ( repulsive or attractive ) of the interactions in an @xmath3-wave channel be controlled , it is possible to control the atomic interaction in a collision with non - zero angular momentum . it is known that superfluidity with non - zero partial wave pairing arises in several condensed - matter systems @xcite .",
    "an ultracold atomic gas is a unique system to study @xmath0-wave superfluids since a fermion system with purely @xmath0-wave interactions can be prepared using a @xmath0-wave feshbach resonance in a single component fermi gas of atoms .",
    "therefore , it is considered with confidence that the superfluidity emerges due to the formation of @xmath0-wave pairs in such a system .",
    "furthermore , the tunability of @xmath0-wave interactions will enable exploration of the evolution of superfluid properties from a bec of @xmath0-wave molecules to a bcs superfluid @xcite . with precise control of experimental parameters and the capability of direct observation of the motions of single atoms through absorption imaging",
    ", we may be able to deepen our understanding of the microscopic mechanism of pair formation and the emergence of @xmath0-wave superfluidity in a strongly - interacting fermion system .",
    "however , strong inelastic collision losses near @xmath0-wave feshbach resonances have made the realization of a @xmath0-wave superfluid one of the biggest challenges in the field of trapped fermi gases @xcite .",
    "interactions among ultracold atoms through a @xmath0-wave channel can be described by the low - energy expansion of the @xmath0-wave scattering amplitude given by the effective - range theory @xcite : @xmath4 here , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the scattering volume and the second coefficient in the effective - range expansion , respectively .",
    "@xmath5 has the form of a resonance @xmath7 $ ] near a feshbach resonance , with @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 being the background scattering volume , resonance width , and resonance magnetic field , respectively @xcite .",
    "typically , the transition temperature of a @xmath0-wave superfluid is higher for a larger @xmath0-wave scattering volume @xcite .",
    "since the background @xmath0-wave scattering volume is not large enough to achieve a realizable critical temperature , it is important to utilize a feshbach resonance to increase the scattering volume .",
    "however , a single - component fermi gas of atoms near a @xmath0-wave feshbach resonance suffers from three - body inelastic collision losses , which shows a clear contrast to the fact that a two - component fermi gas of atoms near an @xmath3-wave feshbach resonance is highly stable against three - body collision losses because of the pauli principle . since the enhancement of elastic collisions and strong inelastic collision losses",
    "are inextricably linked near a feshbach resonance , it is necessary to determine precisely the @xmath0-wave scattering parameters and find the optimum experimental conditions to realize @xmath0-wave superfluidity . in this paper , we report the experimental determination of the scattering parameters for the @xmath0-wave feshbach resonance in a single component fermi gas of @xmath1li atoms in the lowest spin state at 159 g @xcite .",
    "the magnetic - field dependence of the @xmath0-wave elastic scattering cross section is measured by a widely - used cross - dimensional relaxation method @xcite . by applying a theory which takes into account an inhomogeneous density profile and atomic momentum distribution",
    ", we determine the scattering parameters from the measured magnetic - field dependence of the @xmath0-wave elastic scattering cross sections .",
    "this article is organized as follows .",
    "section ii describes our experimental setup for the preparation of a single - component degenerate fermi gas of @xmath1li atoms in the lowest spin state . in section iii",
    ", we discuss the observation of the @xmath0-wave feshbach resonance from an atomic loss feature and describe how we determine the scattering parameters for the @xmath0-wave feshbach resonance from the elastic scattering cross sections measured in the cross - dimensional relaxation method . in section iv , we present a summary and outlook of this work .",
    "in our experiment , we employed an all - optical method of creating a degenerate fermi gas of @xmath1li atoms in the hyperfine ground state of @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "atoms in a magneto - optical trap were compressed by reducing the cooling laser detuning and increasing the magnetic field gradient within 20 msec , and were then transferred into a cavity - enhanced optical dipole trap @xcite .",
    "a cavity - enhanced optical trap was realized by placing a 400 mm cavity in a confocal configuration .",
    "the 1064 nm laser power in the cavity was enhanced by factor of 100 to create a trap depth of @xmath13 1 mk with a beam waist of 260 @xmath14 m .",
    "we then transferred the atoms into a single - beam optical trap with a beam waist of 35 @xmath14 m .",
    "a radio - frequency ( rf ) field was applied to make the population equal in the @xmath15 and @xmath16 states .",
    "evaporative cooling was performed at 300 g where the absolute value of the scattering length between @xmath15 and @xmath16 states is at a local maximum .",
    "a temperature of @xmath17 with @xmath18 atoms was achieved .    to prepare a single - component fermi gas of @xmath1li atoms in the @xmath19 state , we adiabatically ramp the magnetic field to 215 g where the @xmath20 @xmath0-wave feshbach resonance is located , and remove the atoms in the @xmath21 state by enhanced three - body collision loss for @xmath21 state atoms .",
    "we checked that we prepared atoms purely in the state @xmath22 using a conventional stern - gerlach measurement .",
    "the number of remaining atoms in @xmath23 was confirmed to be less than 0.1% of the number of atoms in @xmath22 state .",
    "after the preparation of pure @xmath19 state atoms , we set the magnetic field to @xmath24 @xmath0-wave feshbach resonance at around 159 g.    since the current provided by a commercial power supply typically has ripple noise in the order of 0.1 % , the magnetic field created by the current has the same amount of fluctuation . in order to reduce the magnetic field fluctuation , we stabilize the current running in the coils by controlling the current in bypass circuit added in parallel to the coils . with the stabilization , the current fluctuation is reduced to @xmath25 of the current value , which corresponds to a magnetic field fluctuation of 8 mg .",
    "+      figure [ atomic_loss ] shows the atomic loss measured when atoms in state @xmath22 are held in a trap for various magnetic fields .",
    "since atoms are purely in the lowest energy state @xmath22 , atomic loss is only due to three - body collisions .",
    "the vertical axis shows the fraction of atoms remaining after the 50 ms holding time , and the horizontal axis shows the magnetic field detuning from the @xmath0-wave feshbach resonance at @xmath26 g @xcite .",
    "@xmath27 was determined from the frequency to drive an rf transition from @xmath22 to @xmath23 at the feshbach resonance magnetic field .",
    "data for five different temperatures : 1.3 @xmath14k , 1.7 @xmath14k , 2.3 @xmath14k , 2.7 @xmath14k and 3.6 @xmath14k , are shown with black crosses , red closed circles , green open circles , blue open squares and orange open triangles , respectively . since atom pairs with high relative momentum ( namely high collision energy )",
    "have a higher feshbach resonance field , an asymmetry appears in the loss feature due to the spread of atomic energy distribution .",
    "when we increase the temperature of the atoms , the atomic loss feature broadens only toward the higher magnetic - field side .",
    "the edge of the loss feature in the lower magnetic - field side is always sharp for all temperatures as shown in fig .",
    "[ atomic_loss ] .",
    "the sharp edge of the loss feature corresponds to the @xmath0-wave feshbach resonance for the atomic pairs with zero kinetic energy .",
    "we determine the @xmath0-wave feshbach resonance magnetic field from the sharp edge at the lower magnetic - field side of the atomic loss feature .      in order to determine the unknown scattering parameters , @xmath28 , and @xmath6 in the scattering amplitude function ( eq .  ( [ scattering_amplitude ] ) ) , we measure the @xmath0-wave elastic scattering cross section near the @xmath29 @xmath0-wave feshbach resonance .",
    "the elastic scattering cross section is given by the scattering amplitude as @xmath30 . in our experiment",
    ", we determine the elastic scattering cross section using a cross - dimensional relaxation method @xcite . in this measurement",
    ", we first prepare a dipole - trap laser with an elliptical beam waist so that the trap frequencies in the two radial directions are different by 20 % . when we modulate the trapping - laser intensity with a frequency exactly twice the trap frequency in one of two radial directions",
    ", we can excite the atomic motion in the resonant radial direction , such that there is additional kinetic energy in one direction , resulting in an anisotropic momentum distribution . at this time , absorption images after the time - of - flight ( tof ) show anisotropic expansion of the cloud .",
    "when we hold the atoms in the trap after the parametric excitation , we see the time evolution of the aspect ratio of the cloud reaching unity .",
    "this is because the inter - atomic scattering transfers the kinetic energy from one direction to another , forcing the system to reach thermal equilibrium .",
    "the time of this thermalization is determined by the elastic collision cross section , and therefore the measurement of this energy - transfer rate as a function of the magnetic field gives us information about the scattering parameters .",
    "it is known that a p - wave feshbach resonance has a doublet structure which originates from a magnetic dipole - dipole interaction between two atoms in a p - wave molecular state @xcite .",
    "since the splitting of the two resonances is predicted to be small ( in the order of mg @xcite ) compared with the width of the resonance and smearing of the resonance in the magnetic field due to the momentum spread of the atoms , we treat the p - wave feshbach resonance as a single resonance in this work .",
    "+    figure [ time_chart ] shows the experimental sequence for the magnetic field in the measurement of the elastic scattering cross sections . after the preparation of the atoms in the @xmath31 state ,",
    "the magnetic field is above the @xmath0-wave feshbach resonance @xmath10 .",
    "we sweep the magnetic field to somewhere far below @xmath10 ( where the inter - atomic @xmath0-wave interaction is negligibly small ) as fast as possible to avoid adiabatic creation of @xmath0-wave feshbach molecules @xcite . then the trapping - laser intensity is modulated with twice the trap frequency in one direction for @xmath32 = 3  msec which increases the kinetic energy of the atoms in one of the two radial directions . after holding the system for 5  msec to let the atomic motion dephase , the magnetic field is changed quickly to @xmath33 where the thermalization time is measured .",
    "measurement of the atomic momentum distribution is done by absorption imaging after releasing the atoms from the trap when the magnetic field is turned off .",

    "[ aspect_ratio](b ) , the expanded cloud becomes elliptical , indicating that the resonant modulation of the trapping laser intensity increases the kinetic energy of the atoms in the vertical direction . after holding the atoms long enough to reach thermal equilibrium due to inter - atomic @xmath0-wave scattering , the kinetic energies in the vertical and horizontal directions become equal and the momentum distribution of the atoms becomes isotropic again ( fig .",
    "[ aspect_ratio](c ) ) .",
    "figure [ aspect_ratio](d ) shows the typical time evolution of the aspect ratio of the atomic cloud in the absorption images .",
    "the red markers show the experimental data and the solid curve shows the fitting result with an exponential decay curve to the data .",
    "the aspect ratio gradually decreases due to thermalization by @xmath0-wave scatterings and finally reaches unity after a long holding time .",
    "the time evolution of the aspect ratio can be described by @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is an amplitude of excitation and @xmath36 is a thermalization rate .",
    "the ratio of kinetic energies in the two orthogonal directions is proportional to the square of the aspect ratio , @xmath37 .",
    "therefore the thermalization rate @xmath36 actually indicates the rate of energy transfer from one radial direction to the other .",

    "the offset values for the thermalization rate are finite because the anharmonicity of the trapping potential causes mixing of the motions in the two radial directions which in turn creates an offset thermalization rate .",
    "this anharmonicity effect is larger when the trapping potential is tighter .",
    "since we control the temperature of the atoms by changing both the tightness of the trap potential and the extent to which we conduct evaporative cooling , the effect of anharmonicity depends on the experimental conditions as does the offset value of the thermalization rate . from the fitting , we find @xmath61 [ g ] and @xmath62 .",
