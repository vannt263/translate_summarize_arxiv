    "<S> the divergences of both the length and time scales , at the magnetization- reversal transition in ising model under a pulsed field , have been studied in the linearized limit of the mean field theory . </S>",
    "<S> both length and time scales are shown to diverge at the transition point and it has been checked that the nature of the time scale divergence agrees well with the result obtained from the numerical solution of the mean field equation of motion . </S>",
    "<S> similar growths in length and time scales are also observed , as one approaches the transition point , using monte carlo simulations . </S>",

    "<S> has recently been investigated @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the pulse can be either `` positive '' or `` negative '' . at temperatures @xmath0 below the critical temperature @xmath1 of the corresponding static case ( without any external field ) , </S>",
    "<S> the majority of the spins orient themselves along a particular direction giving rise to the prevalent order . in the following , </S>",
    "<S> we denote by positive ( or negative ) pulse an external field pulse applied along ( or opposite ) the direction of the existing order . </S>",
    "<S> the effects of a positive pulse can be analyzed by extending appropriately the finite size scaling technique to this finite time window case @xcite , and it does not involve any new transition or introduce any new thermodynamic scale into the problem . the negative field pulse , on the other hand , induces a new dynamic `` magnetization - reversal '' transition , involving completely new length and time scales @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , we believe , the spontaneously occurring dynamic symmetry - breaking transition in ising models under ( high frequency ) external oscillating fields @xcite occurs actually during this `` negative '' pulse period ( and not during the `` positive '' pulse period ; compared to the instantaneous existing order in the system ) , and the universality classes of these two transitions are identical . </S>",
    "<S> we report here the results of an investigation on the nature of the characteristic length and time scales involved in this dynamic magnetization - reversal transition in an ising model under the negative pulsed field .    in the absence of any symmetry breaking field , for temperatures below the critical temperature of the corresponding static case ( @xmath2 ) , </S>",
    "<S> there are two equivalent free energy minima with average magnetizations @xmath3 and @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> if in the ordered state the equilibrium magnetization is @xmath3 ( say ) and a very weak pulse is applied in the direction opposite to the existing order , then temporarily during the pulse period the free energy minimum with magnetization @xmath4 will be brought down compared to that with @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> if this asymmetry is made permanent , then any non - vanishing field ( strength ) , which is responsible for the asymmetry , would eventually induce a transition from @xmath3 to @xmath4 ( in the limit of vanishing field strength ) . instead </S>",
    "<S> , if the field is applied in the form of a pulse , the asymmetry in the free energy wells is removed after a finite period of time . in that case , the point of interest lies in the combination of the pulse height or strength ( @xmath5 ) and its width or duration ( @xmath6 ) that can give rise to the transition from @xmath3 to @xmath4 . </S>",

    "<S> . a crucial point about the transition is that it is not necessary that the system should attain its final equilibrium magnetization @xmath4 during the presence of the pulse ; the combination of @xmath5 and @xmath6 should be such that the final equilibrium state is attained at any subsequent time , even a long time after the pulse is withdrawn ( see fig . </S>",
