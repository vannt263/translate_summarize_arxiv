    "neutrino experiments have established the existence of lepton flavour violation ( lfv ) . on the one side ,",
    "the results of super - kamiokande yield an almost maximal mixing between @xmath7 and @xmath8 @xcite and also the latest results of sno @xcite suggest that also the @xmath9 sector contains a large mixing , whereas the third mixing between @xmath10 and @xmath8 has to be small @xcite . on the other side ,",
    "there are stringent constraints on lfv in the charged lepton sector , the strongest being @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "others are @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 .",
    "the standard model can account for the lepton flavour conservation in the charged lepton sector , but has to be extended to account for neutrino masses and mixings , e.g.  by the see - saw mechanism and by introducing heavy right - handed majorana neutrinos @xcite .    in general ,",
    "a gauge and supersymmetric invariant theory does neither conserve total lepton number @xmath15 nor individual lepton number @xmath16 , @xmath17 or @xmath18 .",
    "one usually invokes r - parity symmetry , which forces total lepton number conservation but still allows the violation of individual lepton number , e.g.  due to loop effects in @xmath1 @xcite . the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) with r - parity conservation embedded in a gut theory induces lfv @xcite at the weak scale .",
    "this is a consequence of having leptons and quarks in the same gut multiplet and of the quark flavour mixing due to the ckm matrix .",
    "a general analysis of flavour changing neutral ( fcnc ) effects in k- and b - meson as well as in lepton physics was recently performed in @xcite .",
    "moreover , in the mssm a large @xmath7-@xmath8 mixing can lead to a large @xmath19-@xmath20 mixing via renormalisation group equations @xcite .",
    "this leads to clear lfv signals in slepton and sneutrino production and in the decays of neutralinos and charginos into sleptons and sneutrinos at the lhc @xcite and at future lepton colliders @xcite .",
    "signatures due to @xmath21-@xmath22 mixing were discussed in @xcite . in all these studies , it has been assumed that only one lepton flavour violating term dominates .    in this contribution , we present the results of @xcite where we have studied the consequences of lfv in the sfermion sector at future @xmath0 colliders , and we give additional new results . assuming the _ most general _ mass matrices for sleptons and sneutrinos",
    ", we demonstrate that large signals are expected while at the same time respecting present bounds on rare lepton decays .",
    "the most general charged slepton @xmath23 mass matrix including left - right mixing as well as flavour mixing is given by : @xmath24 with @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the indices @xmath27 characterize the flavors @xmath28 . @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the soft susy breaking mass matrices for left and right sleptons , respectively .",
    "@xmath31 are the trilinear soft susy breaking couplings of the sleptons and higgs bosons .",
    "the physical mass eigenstates states @xmath32 are given by @xmath33 with @xmath34 .",
    "similarly , one finds for the sneutrinos @xmath35 with the physical mass eigenstates @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the relevant interactions for this study are given by : @xmath38 with @xmath39 where we have chosen the basis where the charged lepton yukawa coupling is diagonal @xmath40 .",
    "@xmath41 is the neutrino mixing matrix , @xmath42 diagonalises the neutralino mass matrix in the basis @xmath43 and @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the mixing matrices of the charginos .",
    "the first two terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : coupchisfermion ] ) give rise to lfv signals whereas the last one will give rise to the susy background .    as mentioned above",
    ", most studies so far consider the case where only one of the flavour mixing entries in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : sleptonmass ] ) and/or ( [ eq : sneutrinomass ] ) is non - zero .",
    "it is the purpose of this study to allow for all possible flavour violating entries in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : sleptonmass ] ) and ( [ eq : sneutrinomass ] ) which are compatible with the present bounds on lepton number violating processes , such as @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 . for definiteness",
    ", we have taken the first of the msugra points of snowmass 01 @xcite : @xmath50  gev , @xmath51  gev , @xmath52  gev , @xmath53 and sign@xmath54 .",
    "note that @xmath55 has to be multiplied by the yukawa couplings to get the @xmath31 parameters of eq .",
    "( [ eq : sleptonmass ] ) .",
    "this leads to the following slepton mass parameters at the electroweak scale : @xmath56 = 138.7  gev , @xmath57 = 136.3  gev , @xmath58 = 202.3  gev , @xmath59 = 201.5  gev and @xmath60 = -257.3  gev .",
    "some typical masses are : @xmath61  gev , @xmath62  gev , @xmath63  gev , @xmath64  gev , @xmath65  gev , @xmath66  gev , @xmath67  gev , @xmath68  gev , @xmath69  gev and @xmath70  gev ( the remaining masses are given in  @xcite ) .",
    "we keep all parameters fixed except for the slepton parameters @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 where all entries are varied in the whole range compatible with the experimental constraints .",

    "one of the mass squared parameters is at least one order of magnitude larger than all the others .",
    "however , there is a sizable part in parameters where at least two of the off - diagonal parameters have the same order of magnitude as shown in fig .",

    "we have generated 8000 points consistent with the experimental data , varying the parameters randomly on a logarithmic scale : @xmath83  gev , @xmath84  gev@xmath76 .",
    "we consider the following susy processes : @xmath85 as well as stop and higgs production .",
    "we take into account all possible susy and higgs cascade decays .",
    "we have taken into account isr- and susy - qcd corrections for the production cross sections .",
    "the main sources for the lfv signal stem from production of sleptons , sneutrinos and their decays , for example : @xmath86 moreover , also the decays of the second lightest neutralino give an important contribution as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : chi2decays ]",
    ". there are two main reasons for the large flavour violating branching ratios of @xmath87 in some parts of the parameter space : ( i ) there is no negative interference terms with a @xmath88boson exchange as in the case of flavour conserving decays into leptons .",
    "( ii ) the squarks are substantially heavier than the sleptons in this scenario .",
    "the cross section for the lfv signal @xmath2 can go up to 250 fb if both beams are polarized leading to about @xmath89 events with a luminosity of 100  fb@xmath90 . in the case of two leptons with different flavors and 2 jets we find cross sections up to 1.5  fb @xcite , we have put a veto on b - jets because of the large background stemming from @xmath91-quark production .",
    "for the background we take into account all possible susy cascade decays faking the signal and the standard model background from @xmath92-boson pair production , @xmath91-quark pair production and @xmath93-lepton pair production .",
    "the sm background has been calculated with the program whizard @xcite .",
    "a susy background reaction is , for example , the chain @xmath94 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : signal1 ] we show the cross section of @xmath95 and the corresponding ratio signal over square root of the background ( @xmath96 ) as a function @xmath97 assuming an integrated luminosity of 100  fb@xmath90 .",
    "although no cuts have been applied , there is in most cases a spectacular signal . the cases where the ratio @xmath96 is of order 1 or smaller should clearly improve , once appropriate cuts are applied .",
    "for example , a cut on the angular distribution of the final state leptons will strongly reduce the @xmath98 background .",
    "further cuts as applied in the study of slepton production @xcite will enhance the ratio @xmath96 .",
    "the accumulation of points in fig .",
    "[ fig : signal1 ] along a band is due to a large @xmath21-@xmath99 mixing which is less constraint by @xmath47 than the corresponding left - left or left - right mixing .",

    "it has been shown that the additional r ",
    "parity breaking contributions to processes such as @xmath1 are negligible @xcite so that the same ranges of flavour violating parameters as in the study above are allowed .",
    "thus the same sources for the various signals plus additional leptons stemming from the lsp decays ( see e.g.  @xcite ) are present .",
    "this clearly will lead to even larger signals , in particular those containing additional jets .",
    "in conclusion , we have shown that the most general flavour violating structure of the slepton and sneutrino mass matrix may lead to large lepton flavour violating signals at a future @xmath0 collider  despite the strong constraints on rare lepton decays .",
