    "during the past decade much experimental and theoretical progress has been made in the study of the trinucleon system  the first non - trivial test of the adequacy of phenomenological @xmath11 potentials .",
    "especially instructive tests are provided by photo- and electro - disintegration reactions .",
    "for example , carlson _",
    "_ et al.__@xcite recently reviewed the status of the @xmath0he quasielastic response functions measured in inclusive electron scattering far from the elastic scattering peak . in this complementary work",
    "we report upon the status of the kinematic region near the break - up threshold of @xmath12 mev .",
    "in the early seventies the electrodisintegration of the deuteron near break - up threshold was recognized@xcite as a decisive test of the understanding of meson exchange in the traditional picture of the _ nn _ force .",
    "this reaction is unusually informative because the wave functions of the initial and final states are relatively simple and well - known and , if the electron is deflected to far - backward angles , the break - up is dominated by a pure _ _",
    "m__1 , @xmath13 transition .",
    "the contribution of meson exchange currents ( mec ) generally grows with increasing three - momentum transfer @xmath10 : at @xmath14 @xmath4 mec raise the threshold cross section by about a factor of @xmath15 ; near @xmath16 @xmath4 mec account for nearly 100% of the transverse cross section due to destructive interference between the one - body transition amplitudes .",
    "although the threshold electrodisintegration of @xmath0he aroused similar interest , it took another three decades before viviani _ _",
    "et al.__@xcite were finally able to confirm the importance of mec in the trinucleon break - up .",
    "earlier , hadjimichael _ _ et al.__@xcite had established the need for mec in the elastic cross sections , but due to the requirement of knowing not just the ground state wave functions , but also those of the continuum , the break - up poses a more challenging test .",
    "following quickly on the paper by viviani _",
    ", additional evidence for mec was given in two letters@xcite reporting asymmetry measurements for longitudinally - polarized electrons scattered from a polarized @xmath0he target .",
    "the first@xcite of these measurements was performed near the quasielastic peak , where mec effects are small .",
    "stronger evidence for mec was given in a subsequent paper@xcite on the threshold region , where measurements at @xmath17 and @xmath18 @xmath4 were presented .",
    "near threshold the effect of mec on the spin - dependent asymmetry is calculated to be large , and although the measurements strongly support this prediction , the agreement is not exact . on the other hand ,",
    "spin - dependent asymmetries represent an especially demanding test of nuclear theory .",
    "the delayed confirmation of significant mec effects in the trinucleon break - up stems from the recent parallel developments in precise empirical _ nn _ potentials and powerful theoretical methods for calculating exactly the @xmath7 wave function .",
    "these requirements have now been met , with such success that we can now claim a detailed understanding of most of the basic properties of the trinucleon , at least at low - to - moderate energies and momenta .",
    "the advances in _ nn _ potentials were allowed by high - quality measurements and analyses of _ pp _ and _ np _ scattering .",
    "precise non - relativistic potentials@xcite were constructed that fit the vast databases with @xmath19-per - datum values close to unity .",
    "in addition to the usual charge - independent parts , charge - dependence and asymmetry terms were introduced to account for _ pp _ and _ np _ scattering simultaneously .",
    "the electromagnetic parts of these potentials contain coulomb , darwin - foldy , vacuum polarization , and magnetic moment terms with finite - size properties .",
    "although the calculations shown in this paper rely upon just one@xcite of these potentials , the argonne av18 , for the properties investigated here little sensitivity would be expected to the differences between these modern potentials .",
    "the theoretical techniques devised to solve the three - body schrdinger equation are described in two comprehensive reviews@xcite .",
    "monte carlo methods , faddeev techniques , and variational procedures that utilize correlated hyperspherical harmonics have all been successfully employed . because theoretical predictions for the trinucleon electrodisintegration are sensitive@xcite to final state interactions , precise representations are needed not only for the ground state , but also for the final continuum states .",
    "the calculations of viviani _ _ et al.__@xcite , made within the pair - correlated hyperspherical harmonics scheme , use the av18 two - nucleon potential , supplemented by the urbana - ix three - nucleon interaction@xcite .",
    "because the calculations assume a _ pd _ final state , they are confined to the narrow excitation region between the two- and three body break - up thresholds at @xmath20 and @xmath21 mev .",
    "both longitudinal and transverse response functions were calculated for @xmath0he at @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 @xmath4 , three - momentum transfer values that correspond to experimental results obtained by retzlaff _ _ et al.__@xcite at the mit - bates accelerator .",
    "the effect of mec is largest at the highest momentum transfer , @xmath25 @xmath4 , where the predicted transverse response function @xmath5 is doubled by including mec . even though the experimental points have @xmath26% uncertainties , the scale of the mec enhancement is so large that the importance of exchange currents is firmly established .",
    "in this study we present : ( 1 ) a new measurement of the threshold transverse response function of @xmath0he , made at the highest momentum transfer probed by retzlaff _",
    "et al . _ , but with uncertainties that provide a more rigorous test of the theoretical predictions ; ( 2 ) theoretical calculations that include both two- and three - body break - up .",
    "these include a self - consistent treatment of final - state interactions and exchange currents ; ( 3 ) additional inclusive scattering measurements at @xmath27 and @xmath3 @xmath4 , a kinematic region sometimes speculated to mark the onset of the transition to quark - gluon dynamics ; and ( 4 ) a new appraisal of the threshold longitudinal response function , facilitated by the improved information on the transverse .",
    "the new measurements were made at the mit - bates linear accelerator center at electron scattering angle @xmath28 , an angle where the cross section is dominantly transverse .",
    "useful continuum data were obtained at effective incident beam energies of @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 mev , corresponding to three - momentum transfers at the two - body break - up threshold of @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 @xmath4 .",
    "many of the details of this experiment have been previously published in a report on the @xmath0he elastic magnetic form factor@xcite .",
    "to recapitulate , the target system contained 4000 stp liters of @xmath0he cooled to @xmath32 k and pressurized to @xmath33 atm . in order to mitigate variation in the @xmath0he density due to beam heating ,",
    "the gas flow was highly turbulent , an enlarged beam spot was used , and the beam current was held constant at @xmath34a .",
    "scattered electrons were detected in a magnetic spectrometer system that included drift chambers for trajectory information , a gas cerenkov detector and lead - glass shower counter for particle identification , and three layers of plastic scintillators for triggering and timing .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows the threshold cross section measured with @xmath35 mev incident electrons , plotted as a function of excitation energy .",
    "experimental backgrounds have been removed , and corrections applied for dead - time losses and detector inefficiencies .",
    "the @xmath9he elastic peak and its calculated radiative tail have also been subtracted . as may be seen , in this kinematic region",
    "the elastic radiative tail is small .",
    "the two- and three - body break - up thresholds are indicated on the figure . due to the experimental energy resolution , which results mainly from the straggling of electrons travelling different paths within the thick gas target ,",

    "near - threshold cross section for @xmath9he , measured with @xmath35 mev incident electrons .",

    "the two sets of points show the cross section before and after continuum radiative corrections .",
    "arrows indicate the two- and three - body break - up thresholds . ]    to expedite the comparison of the data to theoretical predictions , corrections were also made for energy lost by the electron in radiative processes , occurring before , after , or during the primary electro - nuclear interaction . in our experiment the overall effect of these processes is to decrease the cross sections measured near threshold .",
    "radiation corrections were applied using the continuum unfolding procedure of mo and tsai@xcite as implemented by miller@xcite . even though our target material is low-_z _",
    ", the radiative corrections turn out to be large . in principle , these are precisely calculable , but this requires data more extensive than our limited measurements .",
    "hence we have , in part , had to rely on approximations and models to evaluate the radiative corrections .",
    "nevertheless , the uncertainties in the calculated corrections are expected to be always smaller than the statistical uncertainties of the data .",

    "in this section we examine the systematic dependence of available experimental information on @xmath5 as a function of incident beam and excitation energies .",

    "chertok _ _ et al.__@xcite published one additional @xmath38 spectrum , however this lacks continuum radiative corrections , and , in any case , is superseded by the later measurements of jones _",
    "made at the same laboratory .",
    "additional spectra were obtained by kan _ _ et al.__@xcite , but at smaller scattering angles where the longitudinal response function is more strongly weighted than the transverse .    for @xmath38 electron scattering",
    "the longitudinal response function is negligible and the transverse response can be deduced using @xmath39 note that the response obtained in this way is given as a function of incident beam energy @xmath40 , not the three - momentum transfer @xmath10 .",
    "however , for the electron beam energies considered here , @xmath10 changes slowly in the vicinity of the break - up threshold .    at the @xmath41 angle of our bates data , longitudinal contributions to the ( _ e_,__e__@xmath42 ) cross section",
    "are still small . based on the results of retzlaff _ et al . _ and our new calculations , longitudinal contributions to the spectrum measured at @xmath29 mev are @xmath43% .",
    "these estimated components have been subtracted from the data .",
    "no similar allowance has been made for longitudinal contributions to data obtained at @xmath30 and @xmath31 mev , but according to our calculations these are even smaller .",
    "selected results for @xmath5 are compiled as a function of @xmath10 and @xmath44 in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . as noted above , for the results of jones _ _ et al.__@xcite and our @xmath41 bates experiment , the value of @xmath10 changes slowly with @xmath44 , decreasing by about @xmath45 @xmath4 between the break - up threshold at @xmath46 mev and @xmath47 mev . for these results the @xmath10-values indicated on the plot",

    "systematics of near - threshold cross sections measured in three experiments .",
    "all spectra are radiatively corrected .",
    "the results of retzlaff _ et al . _ are for a constant value of three - momentum transfer @xmath10 .",
    "as discussed in the text , for the other spectra @xmath10 changes slowly with @xmath44 . for these spectra",
    "the indicated @xmath10-values correspond to the three - body break - up threshold of @xmath21 mev . ]    in the threshold region @xmath5 peaks at @xmath48 @xmath4 , and by @xmath49 @xmath4 has decreased by 4 orders of magnitude . for @xmath50 @xmath4 there is a tendency for @xmath5 to be broadly peaked in the range @xmath51 mev .",
    "this resembles the distribution of resonant e1 strength seen in photoabsorption measurements , and which is convincingly explained by very recent faddeev calculations@xcite that use the av18 _ nn _ potential .",
    "indeed , e1 strength will also be large in inclusive electron scattering at @xmath52 @xmath4 , although , at low-@xmath10 multipoles other than e1 are predicted to make sizeable near - threshold contributions .",
    "for example , early calculations of two - body electrodisintegration by heimbach _ _ et al.__@xcite indicated considerable m2 strength in the region @xmath53 mev at @xmath54 @xmath4 .",
    "additional smaller contributions were obtained from the m1 and m3 multipoles .    for @xmath55 @xmath4 ,",
    "the near - threshold @xmath5 increases monotonically with increasing @xmath44 . at still higher momentum transfers",
    "quasifree scattering becomes the dominant reaction mechanism and , notwithstanding resonance effects , final - state interactions , and phase - space suppression close to threshold , the monotonic rise seen in the data taken at @xmath56 and @xmath31 mev has the _ appearance _ of the high - momentum tail of the quasielastic peak .",
    "this tail is of considerable interest since it provides information on elusive high - momentum components of the nuclear wave function@xcite . in order to test the quasielastic hypothesis we examined the data to see if the cross section scales with @xmath57 , the initial momentum component parallel to * q",
    "* that would be carried by a quasielastically scattered nucleon .",
    "such scaling is the signature of quasifree scattering@xcite . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , even though the momentum transfer is sufficiently high , our results lie outside the band that corresponds to asymptotic @xmath57-scaling .",
    "we conclude that , even at the relatively large @xmath10 of our measurements at @xmath30 and @xmath31 mev , excitation energies of @xmath58 mev are insufficient to assure the dominance of quasifree scattering .",
    "present data , converted to the quasielastic scaling function @xmath59 , where @xmath57 is the initial momentum component parallel to * q * that would be carried by a quasielastically scattered nucleon@xcite .",
    "large values of @xmath57 correspond to large @xmath44 .",
    "our results lie outside the indicated narrow band@xcite corresponding to asymptotic @xmath57-scaling , indicating that quasifree scattering is not dominant in our kinematic range . from lowest to highest beam energies , the average four - momenta transfer for the data are @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 ( gev / c)@xmath63 . ]      the non - relativistic calculations to which we compare our new spectra are similar to those presented in a previous paper@xcite . as described there , bound and continuum _ pd _ and _ ppn _ wave functions were obtained by solving faddeev - like integral equations in momentum space .",
    "all final - state interactions are rigorously included .",
    "the present calculation is improved in two ways .",
    "first , rather than the older - generation bonn potential , we use the updated argonne av18 _ nn _ interaction , and second , we include mec contributions , evaluated using riska s prescription@xcite .",
    "most importantly , for these calculations the final - state interactions and exchange currents are fully consistent with the _ nn _ interaction potential .",
    "the theoretical calculations were performed on the cray sv1 of the nic in jlich , germany and the nersc computational facility , usa . despite the computational power of these facilities , the long cpu times required for the calculations limited what could be achieved .",
    "the main results are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] . for @xmath35",
    "mev the agreement with the data could scarcely be better .",
    "these new theoretical predictions may also be compared to the _ pd _ breakup calculations by viviani _ _ et al.__@xcite that utilize the same _ nn _ potential , but which were carried out by means of pair - correlated hyperspherical harmonics , not by solving faddeev equations . motivated by the data of retzlaff _ _ et al.__@xcite , viviani _ et al , _",
    "s calculations were performed for a momentum transfer @xmath64% higher than that of our @xmath35 mev measurements . nevertheless , when this difference is taken into account using the @xmath10-dependence given by viviani _",
    ", it is found that the faddeev and hyperspherical harmonic calculations , both with and without mec , are almost indistinguishable in the @xmath65 mev range where comparison is valid .",
    "it is reassuring to note that our new faddeev calculation of the three body final state continues to agree well with the data up to the highest excitation energy . according to an earlier calculation@xcite based on the previous - generation bonn b interaction ,",
    "the three - body contribution to @xmath5 grows relatively slowly above threshold : at @xmath66 mev and @xmath67 @xmath4 , it amounts to just half the two - body contribution .",

    "the agreement of the two calculations , in addition to the agreement with the data , does more than simply confirm the importance of mec in the @xmath0he break - up  it underscores how accurate these modern calculations can be  to a point . as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , the theoretical prediction is less satisfactory for the higher beam energy of @xmath30 mev . here",

    "mev the interference is constructive ; below @xmath69 mev it is strongly destructive .",
    "( this contrasts strongly with the effect of mec on the @xmath35 mev spectrum . )",
    "although this leads to the correct shape , the predicted @xmath5 is about a factor of @xmath70 too low throughout the threshold region .",
    "several factors may account for this discrepancy .",
    "for example , the use of non - relativistic dynamics is questionable at such energies . to investigate this we performed an exploratory calculation in which the one - body current only was treated relativistically , and even this in a manner formally inconsistent with the _ nn _ interaction .",
    "figure  [ fig4 ] shows that this device leads to an even poorer prediction of the data .",
    "moreover , the momentum transfers of our @xmath30 and @xmath31 mev spectra probe small wave function components well beyond the fermi momentum .",
    "these components are usually negligible , but their effects can be magnified in scattering at large @xmath10 , as shown in an analysis of quasifree scattering by sick , day , and mccarthy@xcite . from this work",
    "it was deduced that the `` exact '' @xmath9he wave functions obtained from realistic _ nn _ interactions have high - momentum components that are too small .",
    "a further indication of theoretical difficulties at large @xmath10 is evident in the observation@xcite that the first diffraction minimum in the elastic magnetic form factor of @xmath0he is located near @xmath71 @xmath4 , somewhat higher than predicted by current theories .",
    "viviani _ _ et al.__@xcite have calculated the @xmath10-dependence of @xmath5 at a fixed @xmath72 mev excitation above the _ pd _ threshold",
    ". however , due to the small size of the experimental cross section near threshold , it is unpractical to compare to this prediction .",
    "a more reliable comparison may be made by integrating @xmath5 in the range @xmath73 mev , where break - up is confined to the _ pd _ channel evaluated by viviani .",
    "our integration of the theory assumes a linear dependence for @xmath5 on @xmath44an assumption supported by the near - threshold calculations .",

    "[ fig5 ] . with the exception of the two high-@xmath10 points ,",

    "the experimental error bars include systematic uncertainties in the cross sections , as well as uncertainties in @xmath44 . where not shown , the errors are comparable to the size of the points .",
    "additional experimental information on @xmath5 was obtained by kbschall _ _ et al.__@xcite , but close to threshold these results have very large uncertainties . ]    the change in the interference from constructive to destructive agrees with our new theoretical predictions , as indicated in fig .",
    "but note that the destructive interference is confined to low excitation energies : at large @xmath44 the interference remains constructive , a prediction confirmed by the data .",
    "unlike the slow and monotonic rise of the transverse response function , the longitudinal response rises abruptly in the first @xmath70 mev above threshold@xcite , a feature attributed@xcite to a @xmath75 coulomb monopole transition .",
    "this behaviour is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , which reproduces the experimental results of retzlaff _ _ et al.__@xcite , obtained at @xmath25 @xmath4 .",
    "our calculation for this momentum transfer has the right shape , but exceeds the data by about a factor of @xmath70 . in part",
    ", this is attributed to our neglect of the coulomb barrier that would suppress the emission of low - energy protons . indeed , as shown in the figure , the calculation of the _ pd _ electrodisintegration by viviani _",
    "_ et al.__@xcite , which includes the coulomb term , lies closer to the data .",
    "still better agreement is obtained by including two - body charge operators . as noted by viviani _",
    ", these operators have relativistic origins and should properly be evaluated by including , in a self - consistent way , relativistic effects in both the interaction models and the nuclear wave functions .",
    "lacking such a method , the only recourse is to perform a model - dependent calculation .",

    "as the plot shows , for @xmath8 @xmath4 the agreement between experiment and theory is generally excellent , while the significance of the discrepancy with retzlaff s point at @xmath25 @xmath4 has been discussed in some length .",
    "the disagreement for the lowest-@xmath10 point of kan _ et al .",

    "for @xmath79 @xmath4 , exact non - relativistic calculations using the best available _ nn _ potentials give a very good description of measurements of the @xmath0he threshold electrodisintegration . at low momentum transfer one - body matrix elements predominate , but as @xmath10 increases the two - body contribution grows significant , particularly in the transverse part of the cross section .",
    "for example , at @xmath1 @xmath4 , corresponding to one of the three new measurements reported here , the inclusion of two - body terms raises the predicted @xmath5 by a factor of two , bringing the theory into close agreement with the data  proof that our understanding of mec is accurate .    according to the near - threshold theoretical predictions for @xmath5 , at @xmath80 @xmath4 the interference between one- and two - body terms switches from constructive to destructive .",
    "this is supported by our two other measurements , made at @xmath81 @xmath4 .",
    "these points fall about a factor of @xmath82 below the one - body prediction , but the destructive interference with two - body current terms lowers the prediction . that it still exceeds the data by a factor of two suggests the need for a more complete interference , but other factors can not be overlooked .",
    "for example , the high-@xmath10 measurements are in a kinematic region sensitive not only to relativistic effects , but also to high - momentum wave function components , which , as indicated by quasifree scattering results , may be too small in `` exact '' wave functions obtained from realistic _ nn _ interactions . a pointed indication of the importance of relativistic effects is found in the analysis of viviani _ _ et al.__@xcite of the longitudinal response function at @xmath25 @xmath4 .",
    "close to threshold there exists a factor - of - two disagreement between the one - body predictions and experimental values of @xmath6 .",
    "this disagreement is reduced , but not entirely resolved , by considering two - body charge matrix elements .",
    "these are equivalent to relativistic corrections . at this time estimates of these corrections are model - dependent : the discovery of a rigorous , self - consistent procedure for evaluating relativistic effects poses a considerable challenge . as has been repeatedly noted , a relativistic formulation of effective hadronic theory is essential for a satisfactory understanding of the transition from hadron to quark regimes .",

    "<S> cross sections were measured for the near - threshold electrodisintegration of @xmath0he at momentum transfer values of @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 @xmath4 . from these and prior measurements the transverse and longitudinal response functions @xmath5 and @xmath6 were deduced . </S>",
    "<S> comparisons are made against previously published and new non - relativistic @xmath7 calculations using the best available _ nn _ potentials . in general , for @xmath8 @xmath4 these calculations accurately predict the threshold electrodisintegration of @xmath9he . </S>",
    "<S> agreement at increasing @xmath10 demands consideration of two - body terms , but discrepancies still appear at the highest momentum transfers probed , perhaps due to the neglect of relativistic dynamics , or to the underestimation of high - momentum wave - function components . </S>"
