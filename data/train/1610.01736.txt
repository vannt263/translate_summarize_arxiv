    "two - dimensional superlattices and moir structures have recently received renewed attention because of the possibility of using them to engineer the electronic structure of stacked two - dimensional materials .",
    "it is , for instance , possible to introduce an electronic length scale comparable to the magnetic length in a strong field , helping to create situations like the hofstadter butterfly @xcite . due to the particularly important role of graphene in this type of transport phenomena",
    ", attention has mostly focused on hexagonal moir structures @xcite , such as the one formed between ( bilayer ) graphene and hexagonal boron nitride ( hbn ) @xcite , ir(111 ) @xcite or sic(0001 ) @xcite ; or , between single layer mos@xmath0 and au(111 ) @xcite .",
    "the effect of the moir structure on the electronic structure of the two - dimensional material varies strongly for the different cases , depending on the orbital character of the bands involved and the interlayer interaction .",
    "for graphene on hbn or ir(111 ) , for instance , the interaction leads to replicas and band gap openings near the boundaries of the superstructure brillouin zone , but no such effects are observed for graphene on sic or mos@xmath0 on au(111 ) .",
    "a situation closely related to the moir of two hexagonal lattices already arises in the so - called herringbone reconstruction of the clean au(111 ) surface @xcite . in this reconstruction a moir - like superstructure is formed between the topmost layer of atoms , which undergoes a uniaxial compression by 4.55% , and the second layer with a perfect hexagonal structure .",
    "this reconstructed surface hosts a free electron - like surface state @xcite that has been intensely studied using angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) and scanning tunnelling microscopy ( stm ) , revealing phenomena such as spin - orbit splitting of surface states @xcite , quasiparticle interference in the presence of spin - polarised bands @xcite , surface state lifetimes @xcite , and lifetimes in spin - split systems @xcite . despite the major surface reconstruction ,",
    "arpes data show only very minor effects of the atomic arrangement on the observed surface state dispersion @xcite and cross section @xcite .",
    "this is hard to reconcile with several indications from stm @xcite and theory @xcite that the reconstruction has a non - negligible effect on the surface state wave function .",
    "here we show that the surface reconstruction does indeed have a major influence on the dispersion probed by arpes , but only on the dispersion measured away from normal emission in a surface brillouin zone ( sbz ) center corresponding to a higher diffraction order .",
    "the uniaxial compression of the lattice directly affects the reciprocal lattice and thus the position of the higher order zone centers . together with the three rotational domains present on the surface",
    ", the measured dispersion turns from a simple parabolic state with a circular fermi contour to a complex dispersion with constant energy surfaces resembling a trefoil knot .",
    "we emphasize that this dominating fermi contour does not simply consist of replicas caused by the overall moir periodicity but rather by displaced dispersions induced by the local lattice distortion .",
    "the au(111 ) surface was cleaned by standard methods @xcite .",
    "the cleanliness and presence of the surface reconstruction were corroborated by stm .",
    "arpes data were taken at the sgm-3 beamline of the synchrotron radiation facility astrid2 in aarhus @xcite .",
    "the energy and angular resolution were better than 30  mev and 0.2@xmath1 , respectively .",
    "the sample temperature was 100  k. the synchrotron radiation was linearly polarized in the @xmath2 plane ; incident direction and electron analyzer enclosed an angle of 50@xmath1 .",
    "figure [ fig:1 ] illustrates the effect of the herringbone reconstruction when arpes data is taken in a higher order sbz for two photon energies , 42.5  ev and 61.0  ev .",
    "data taken around normal emission ( fig . [ fig:1](a)-(c ) ) show the expected free electron - like dispersion of the state with the two spin - split bands clearly discernible and a fermi contour consisting of two concentric circles , in excellent agreement with earlier results @xcite . note that the bands are not quite as clearly resolved as in some previous publications , notably in the direction perpendicular to the slit of the electron analyzer ( along @xmath2 ) .",
    "this is mostly due to the high photon energy used here , which results in an inferior @xmath3-resolution .",
    "while the periodicity of the moir structure in other systems has been observed to lead to weak replicas and band gap openings in arpes data at low temperature and with low photon energies around normal emission @xcite , this is not observed here , presumably because these replicas are too weak .",
    "[ fig:1](d)-(f ) and ( g)-(i ) show a measurement of the electronic structure around the @xmath4 point in the adjacent sbz where a much more complex picture emerges .",
    "the dominating features are three versions of the original dispersion centred around different points , with fermi contours forming a trefoil knot of spin - split circles , best seen in fig . [",
    "fig:1](d ) .",
    "this results deviates in subtle but important ways from the previously discussed case of replicas induced by the moir superstructure @xcite , where one would expect the observation of one dominating dispersion and six very weak replicas .",
    "by contrast , the trefoil knot contour can be explained by the local uniaxial compression along @xmath5 directions in three domains of the moir superstructure .",
    "in fact , the observed dispersions are not `` replicas '' in the sense of features resulting from scattering by the moir periodicity , but rather are the dispersions centred around the first order reciprocal lattice points of different domains .",
    "this has the interesting consequence that two of the three dispersions stem from one domain each , in contrast to the domain averaged dispersion around @xmath6 .",
    "the accepted structural model for one domain of the reconstruction is given in fig .",
    "[ fig:2](a ) @xcite .",
    "the top layer is compressed along the @xmath7 direction , such that 23 lattice spacings of the top layer fit on 22 lattice spacings of the second layer .",
    "this results in a rectangular superstructure unit cell which is 22 times longer than the original lattice vector in one direction and @xmath8 times this lattice vector in the other .",
    "the key to understanding the findings in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] is not this overall periodicity but the change in the local geometry required to obtain it : as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2](a ) and ( b ) , the compression of the first layer leads to a slight distortion of the lattice in this layer ( in red ) compared to the underlying crystal ( in black ) , giving rise to an oblique lattice in contrast to the underlying hexagonal lattice .",
    "the corresponding reciprocal lattices for the first layer and the underlying lattice are given in fig .",
    "[ fig:2](c ) .",
    "due to momentum conservation , the photoemission from solids always involves the lattice - periodic potential and the photoemission cross section connecting a final state at wave vector @xmath9 with an initial state at @xmath10 is proportional to fourier coefficient @xmath11 of the lattice - periodic potential ( @xmath12 is a reciprocal lattice vector ) @xcite .",
    "we therefore expect to observe the au(111 ) surface state not only around normal emission but around all reciprocal lattice vectors @xmath12 with a finite @xmath13 .",
    "we call these points @xmath14 . for the limiting cases of a surface state only located in the first layer ( deeper layers )",
    ", these @xmath14 points would correspond to the red ( black ) reciprocal lattice points in n fig . [",
    "fig:2](c ) and one would expect to observe dispersions centered there .",
    "if the surface state wave function follows both the periodicity of the truncated bulk _ and _ that of the first layer , the @xmath14 points for the combined reciprocal lattice and the corresponding @xmath15 can be obtained using the convolution theorem of fourier transformation @xcite .",
    "the @xmath15 can be assumed to predict the relative intensities from the surface state dispersions .",

    "[ fig:2](d ) is significantly different from that previously used to account for the replica bands around normal emission . in ref . @xcite ,",
    "such replicas are explained by an interaction of the surface state with the long - range moir pattern .",
    "the expected @xmath14 points for this case can also be calculated , using the large scale moir structure rather than the nearly equal competing periodicities of first and deeper layers ( see appendix ) .",

    "however , the models are distinctly different for the situation close to @xmath24 . for an interaction with a large - scale moir structure",
    ", one would expect to observe six replicas around _ every _ reciprocal lattice point of the undistorted lattice and the replicas around @xmath24 would be even weaker than those around @xmath23 . while the intensity of the six moir - induced replicas around each original reciprocal lattice point is exactly symmetric in our simple model , this would not strictly need to be so in an arpes experiment because of @xmath3-dependent matrix element variations .",

    "[ fig:1](g ) , ( h ) .",
    "the many bands and their overlap can make the direct comparison difficult but some of the details are better seen when comparing the model to second derivatives of the photoemission data ( see appendix ) .",
    "the spectral function around @xmath4 is dominated by three dispersions for all photon energies studied here .",
    "the replica bands , represented by the grey dispersions , are very weak and only barely observed for @xmath2561  ev .",
    "no dispersions at the `` bottom '' of the hexagon ( i.e. , closer to the @xmath6 point , as would be expected for the dispersion resulting from the presence of the moir ) are ever observed .",
    "the model of fig .",
    "[ fig:2](d ) also predicts that the two outer dispersions ( around @xmath16 and @xmath17 ) should stem from different domains , implying that there can not be any gap openings at the crossing points of the @xmath16 and @xmath17 parabolas , and this is confirmed by the data ( see appendix ) .",
    "the two scenarios in fig . [ fig:2](d ) and ( e ) are merely limiting cases and not mutually exclusive , but the strength of the effects is very different .",
    "the competing periodicities in the first and second layer leading to the trefoil knot fermi contour are present on a short range : if the surface state wave functions are influenced by the first layer periodicity , this immediately leads to a significant component in the fourier spectrum .",
    "the effect of the overall moir periodicity , on the other hand , may be weak because of the weak fourier coefficients for this modulation , the finite number moir periodicities in one domain and the finite quantum coherence of the wave function @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "both models predict six weak replicas around @xmath23 and the results reported here are therefore consistent with those of ref .",
    "even the observation of initial state gaps between the centre dispersion and these replicas is not in contradiction to the findings here - gap openings would only be prevented between neighboring replicas as these stem from different domains of the reconstruction .",
    "previous arpes results from au(111 ) have shown that the consequences of herringbone reconstruction can be detected but that the effect is quite weak @xcite .",
    "this was in puzzling contrast to results by stm @xcite and density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite which show that the surface state wave functions ( or the kohn - sham orbitals ) are strongly influenced by the reconstruction .",
    "in particular , dft can track the surface state wave function , showing a strong localization of the state in the first layers and a periodicity that follows both the first and the lower layers .",
    "we show here that this does also lead to a strong effect in arpes , but only as regards the surface state in a higher brillouin zone .",
    "the separation of the trefoil knot fermi surfaces is expected to increase still more when going to even higher order @xmath26 points .",
    "it is also worth noting that introducing the reconstruction in dft shifts the surface state band at @xmath26 in binding energy from 350 to 490  mev , and thereby brings it into excellent agreement with the experimental results .",
    "when the reconstruction is lifted , for example by sulphur adsorption , this binding energy is again reduced to 376(10 )  mev and the trefoil knot fermi contour disappears ( see appendix ) .",
    "we note that the approach of calculating the maps in fig . [ fig:2](d ) and ( e ) by just two competing periodicities is , of course , a simplification . on a local scale",
    ", stm indicates a stronger binding of the surface state electrons in the hexagonally closed packed regions between first and second layer @xcite , suggesting a complex interplay between surface state and local structure .",
    "moreover , the compression of the atoms in the first layer is not entirely uniform @xcite .",
    "however , an estimate of this imperfect periodicity s effect on the expected diffraction pattern shows that it only induces minor changes ( see appendix ) .",
    "we also note that the simple picture presented here does not account for final state effects .",
    "an interesting consequence of our findings is that it is possible to observe the surface state dispersion in a single domain , such as around @xmath16 and @xmath17 , instead of the average from all three domains around @xmath6 or @xmath4 .",
    "this opens the possibility to test the non - parabolicity of the state .",
    "indications of this effect have previously been detected by stm on cu(111 ) and ag(111 ) @xcite and recently even by arpes on au(111 ) for the domain - averaged fermi contour around @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "a more practical consequence relates to the importance of the au(111 ) surface state for the calibration of spin detectors .",
    "such a calibration is routinely done using the surface state around @xmath6 @xcite but there might be advantages to using the dispersion of a single domain instead .",
    "in conclusion , trefoil knot - like constant energy surfaces have been found for the au(111 ) surface state when performing arpes in a higher order sbz , solving the long - standing discrepancy between , on one hand , the strong effect of the reconstruction observed in stm @xcite and dft @xcite and , on the other hand , its near absence in arpes data .",
    "the approach of probing higher order sbz should be generally applicable to probe similar effects of strain in interfaces between two - dimensional materials and other moir structures .",
