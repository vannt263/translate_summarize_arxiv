    "since the end of the seventies it has been realized that for high rates of accretion , @xmath0 , the advection of energy with the accretion flow can play a crucial role in the inner parts of an accretion disk around black holes .    in the last few years",
    "a set of papers were published , where it was shown that neglecting the advective heat transport at high @xmath0 leads to qualitatively wrong conclusions about the topology of the family of solutions to the system of disk structure equations ( see for example abramowicz et al 1995 ; chen et al 1995 ; artemova et al 1996 ) .",
    "the disk structure equations without advection give rise two branches of solutions : optically thick and optically thin , which do not intersect for @xmath1 for @xmath2 and @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the eddington luminosity ( artemova et al 1996 ) . for larger luminosities",
    "there are no solutions of these equations extending continuously from large to small radii .",
    "it was argued by artemova et al ( 1996 ) , that for luminosities larger than @xmath5 , advection becomes important and induces a transition from the optically thick to the optically thin disk in the global solution .",
    "thus , if we were to take advection into account , solutions to the disk structure equations should also exist at @xmath6 . in that case",
    "the disk should consist of an optically thin inner part , smoothly connected to an optically thick outer part .",
    "the goal of this _ letter _ is to construct explicitly accretion disk models taking advective heat transport into account _ self - consistently _ and to demonstrate in such a way the correctness of our hypothesis , as proposed in the paper by artemova et al ( 1996 ) .",
    "we use from now on geometric units with @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and use @xmath9 as the radial coordinate scaled to @xmath10 .",
    "in describing accretion disks when advective cooling is important , one can use the following model : we assume that advective cooling is added in a _ self - consistent _ way to other ( local ) cooling mechanisms in a keplerian , geometrically thin disk .",
    "we neglect the radial momentum equation and suggest that the disk thickness is everywhere small .",
    "this simplification is not too serious because neglecting these factors leads to quantitative corrections only , while neglecting advection cooling leads to qualitatively different solutions .",
    "this was discussed in detail by abramowicz et al ( 1995 ) and chen et al ( 1995 ) .",
    "their treatment of advective cooling was not _",
    "self - consistent _ , however , as their advection parameter , @xmath11 , was assumed to be constant throughout the disk as well as being independent of the accretion rate .",
    "thus we assume that the disk is geometrically thin and the rotational velocity is keplerian under the pseudo - newtonian potential proposed by paczyski and wiita ( 1980 ) , @xmath12 .",
    "we normalize the accretion rate as @xmath13 , where @xmath14 .",
    "the non - relativistic disk structure equations without advection , in the case of the newtonian potential , together with the method of their solutions have been described earlier ( see artemova et al 1996 ) . here",
    "we will outline the main difference related to the use of the potential of paczyski and wiita and to the inclusion of the advective cooling process in the energy balance .",
    "paczyski and bisnovatyi - kogan ( 1981 ) were the first to describe a method to account for the advective cooling in the disk accretion problem .    the angular velocity for the paczyski and wiita potential is @xmath15^{1/2}$ ] .",
    "recall that conservation of angular momentum for a steady - state accretion in the @xmath16-disk model can be written as    @xmath17    where the factor , @xmath18 , accounts for the boundary condition at the inner edge of the disk , @xmath19 . neglecting advection we have @xmath20 .",
    "the half thickness of the disk is denoted by @xmath21 , and @xmath22 is the total pressure in the equatorial plane of the disk .    the viscous heating rate per unit area , @xmath23 ,",
    "is given by the formula ( see e.g. bisnovatyi - kogan , 1989 ; frank , king & raine , 1992 ) @xmath24    the advection cooling rate can be written in the form ( see chen and taam 1993 ) : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the temperature , @xmath27 is the specific entropy , and @xmath28 is a factor which characterizes the advective cooling .",
    "this factor can be written in the form : @xmath29 , \\label{eq : g3}\\ ] ] where , @xmath30 is the energy per unit mass of the gas , @xmath31 is the matter density and @xmath32 .",
    "the energy equation has the form @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the rate of all local cooling processes ( see artemova et al 1996 ) .",
    "all other equations are the same as in artemova et al ( 1996 ) .",
    "the principal difference here is that now the energy balance is described by a differential equation rather than an algebraic one .",
    "the boundary conditions for this system are the following : at large , @xmath35 , the solution must coincide with the solution obtained without advection , and at the inner disk boundary we should not require that @xmath36 , but rather we treat @xmath37 as an eigenvalue of the problem and allow it to be less than @xmath38 .",
    "we solved this system of equations by the method of subsequent iterations , with fixed @xmath39 and @xmath16 , and varying @xmath37 to obtain a _ self - consistent _ solution .",
    "we did this in two steps : started one calculation from large radii and another at the inner edge of the disk and adjusting @xmath37 until the solutions matched near @xmath40 .",
    "we will compare the solutions with and without advection cooling .    in figure 1",
    "we plot the optical depth @xmath41 ( @xmath42 , the disk surface density ) as a function of radius , @xmath9 , for the case @xmath3 , @xmath2 ; for various values of @xmath39 , without taking into account the advection cooling , i.e. we set @xmath43 . for accretion rates",
    "@xmath44 , ( corresponding to @xmath45 ) , there are two families of solutions which are continuous from large radii to the inner disk edge . for @xmath46",
    "there are no solutions for a range of radii around @xmath47 , thus for such high accretion rates there are no solutions extending continuously from large to small radii .",
    "( see also the discussion in the paper artemova et al , 1966 ) .      in figure 2",
    "we compare the solutions for @xmath50 and @xmath51 without advection , ( @xmath43 ) , and with self - consistent advection , @xmath52 .",
    "the functions @xmath53 for the cases @xmath54 and @xmath55 are shown in figure 3 .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath37 are correspondingly : @xmath56 ; @xmath57 .    in figure 4",
    "we plot the distribution of pressure @xmath58 for @xmath54 and @xmath55 in the case @xmath54 the solution changes quantitatively , but not qualitatively .",
    "the solution is optically thick everywhere in the disk .    for the value",
    "@xmath59 there was no solution extending continuously from large to small radii without advection , i.e. when @xmath43 ( see fig.1 ) . with the _ self - consistent _ advection term @xmath60 ( see fig .",
    "3 ) there is a solution which consists of an optically thin inner part that continuously turns into an optically thick outer part ( see fig .",
    "_ self - consistent _ solutions in this case of course also exist for higher values of @xmath39 .",
    "thus , the results presented here demonstrate that the hypothesis proposed in the paper by artemova et al ( 1996 ) is correct , namely that for @xmath61 there are solutions to the disk structure equations with self - consistent advective cooling and with transitions from optically thick to optically thin regions .",
    "schemes showing the topology of the families of disk solutions without advection or with _ self - inconsistent _ advection ( @xmath62 , for example ) should be revised .",
    "the advection term , @xmath63 , crucially depends on @xmath9 and @xmath64 ( recall fig .",
    "3 ) . the opposite conclusion that @xmath11 does not depend very much on @xmath39 was obtained in the paper by chen ( 1995 ) .",
    "we note also that there are solutions for @xmath61 with _ self - consistent _",
    "@xmath28 , with optically thick inner part and an optically thin outer region of the disk .",
    "we will address these solutions as well as the more general solution , including the radial pressure gradient and angular velocities of the gas , in future work .",
