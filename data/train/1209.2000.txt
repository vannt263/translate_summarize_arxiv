    "systems of this type was first considered in @xcite and later on by several other authors @xcite , as a prototypical example of a non - strictly hyperbolic system .",

    "this system also has similarities to a model of chromatography @xcite and to a model describing polymer flooding in porous media @xcite .",

    "the presence of repeated eigenvalues shows that the system is not strictly hyperbolic .    due to the nonlinearity",

    "@xmath23    it is well known that weak solutions may be discontinuous and they are not uniquely determined by their initial data .",
    "consequently , an entropy condition must be imposed to single out the physically correct solution .",

    "the existence was proved by showing the convergence of the singularly perturbed problems @xmath32 to an entropy solution as @xmath33 .",
    "the idea behind the existence proof was first to show the existence of a _ measure - valued _",
    "solution @xmath34 of the cauchy problem .",
