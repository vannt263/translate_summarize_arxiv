    "solar wind turbulence is anisotropic with respect to the direction of the magnetic field .",
    "for example , the magnetic field correlation length has been shown to vary depending on the angle of observation with respect to the field direction @xcite .",
    "the magnetic field power and spectral indices are also observed to be anisotropic : power at a fixed scale increases with angle to the magnetic field @xcite and the spectral index varies from @xmath2 at small angles to between @xmath1 and @xmath0 in the field perpendicular direction @xcite .",
    "these observations are consistent with theories of critically balanced magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) turbulence , for example , that of @xcite , which predicts anisotropic fluctuations ( @xmath3 ) and the @xmath2 and @xmath0 spectral indices .",
    "many simulations of plasma turbulence have been performed , most of which have used the equations of incompressible mhd . when a strong mean magnetic field is present , the spectral index of the total energy is closer to @xmath1 than @xmath0 @xcite , although a limited inertial range and the bottleneck effect @xcite make this number hard to determine precisely @xcite .",
    "anisotropy has also been measured in mhd simulations .",
    "early 2d simulations showed that the turbulence develops wavevector anisotropy so that the fluctuations have @xmath3 @xcite , and this was later confirmed in 3d simulations @xcite .",
    "the anisotropy was found to be scale - dependent , such that @xmath4 @xcite , in agreement with the critical balance predictions @xcite .",
    "an important point noted in these studies , and also in solar wind measurements @xcite , was that the anisotropic scaling is with respect to the scale - dependent local mean field and not the global mean field .",
    "the theory of @xcite was modified by @xcite by including a phenomenon called scale - dependent dynamic alignment . in this theory ,",
    "the velocity and magnetic field fluctuations align to within a smaller angle at smaller scales and the perpendicular spectral index becomes @xmath1 .",
    "there is evidence for this scale - dependent dynamic alignment in the solar wind @xcite and some driven mhd simulations @xcite , although higher resolution simulations suggest that the alignment saturates at small scales @xcite .    to date",
    ", there has not been a measurement of the spectral index parallel to the local magnetic field in simulations .",
    "measurements of the perpendicular spectral index in the solar wind and in simulations are also not always in agreement .",
    "it is important to be sure that the same quantities are being measured in both the solar wind and simulations and the subject of this paper is such a comparative study .",
    "we apply a similar analysis technique to both solar wind data and reduced mhd ( rmhd ) simulations , to make a direct comparison of the anisotropic scaling . in section [ sec : sw ] we present the solar wind analysis , in section [ sec : sim ] we present the simulation analysis , in section [ sec : localvsglobal ] we compare the local and global mean field methods and in section [ sec : conc ] we present our conclusions .",
    "in this section , we apply the multispacecraft method of @xcite to obtain the power and spectral index anisotropy of inertial range turbulence in the slow solar wind at 1 au .",
    "the technique is applied to 65 1-hour intervals of data from the cluster spacecraft @xcite from december 2005 to april 2006 , when the typical separation between the four spacecraft was @xmath5 10,000 km .",
    "the selected intervals are from the parts of the cluster orbit where the spacecraft were in the free solar wind upstream of the bow shock at geocentric distances of between 15 @xmath6 and 20 @xmath6 .",
    "they contain no evidence of ion foreshock activity : signatures typical of the ion foreshock , such as enhanced magnetic field fluctuations and high - energy ions , are not present .",
    "the time series were also inspected visually to ensure that they are approximately stationary and do not contain shocks or magnetic clouds .    in the analysis",
    ", we use 4 s measurements of the magnetic field from the fluxgate magnetometer ( fgm ) @xcite and velocity and density moments from the cluster ion spectrometer ( cis ) @xcite .",

    "this is similar to the work of @xcite , except we bin the data with respect to the _ local _ field direction , since this appears to be the relevant mean field for the fluctuations , and we use many more intervals .",

    "this enables a direct comparison to be made between turbulence in the solar wind and in numerical simulations .",
    "the rmhd equations , originally derived by @xcite , have been used previously to simulate various aspects of mhd turbulence ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "they can be written in elsasser potentials @xcite : @xmath46 where @xmath47 , @xmath48 is the global mean field direction , @xmath49 is the alfvn  speed and the elsasser potentials are defined via @xmath50 .    equations ( [ eq : rmhd ] ) contain only the perpendicular fluctuations and are , therefore , suitable for simulating alfvnic  turbulence .",
    "they are also more efficient to simulate than mhd , since they involve only two scalar fields .",
    "although originally derived from mhd , it has been shown that rmhd holds for a collisionless plasma such as the solar wind and may , therefore , be more generally applicable @xcite .",
    "the rmhd derivation assumes anisotropy ( @xmath51 ) and a strong mean field ( @xmath52 ) , both of which are observed at the smallest scales of the solar wind inertial range .",
    "the simulation reported here solves the rmhd equations in a triply periodic cube of size @xmath53 with a resolution of @xmath54 .",
    "the alfvn  speed is set to @xmath55 ( making the alfvn  crossing time @xmath56 ) .",
    "it can be seen from equations ( [ eq : rmhd ] ) that if the alfvn  speed is scaled by a factor @xmath57 and the @xmath58 coordinate , which is the mean field direction , is also scaled by @xmath57 , the equations remain identical .",
    "this means that a given simulation corresponds to all values of @xmath57 , and therefore all values of @xmath59 if the box is also stretched in the @xmath58 direction .",
    "the units of length in the perpendicular and parallel directions are independent of each other because the anisotropy is formally infinite and the fluctuation level is infinitely small under the rmhd asymptotic expansion .",
    "different values of @xmath57 can be chosen , setting the anisotropy and fluctuation level so that the same simulation can be compared to a variety of real world situations .",
    "the equations are solved pseudospectrally in @xmath60 and @xmath61 , and using a centred finite difference scheme in @xmath58 .",
    "the time step is chosen so that the courant numbers based on both the fluctuation amplitude and the alfvn  speed are much less than unity . with dissipation and forcing terms the equations are @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath64 are the viscosity coefficients and @xmath65 is the forcing term . in the @xmath60 and @xmath61 directions ,",
    "a 4th order hyperviscosity dissipation term is used , while in the @xmath58 direction a very small laplacian viscosity is added to prevent the high @xmath66 modes becoming unstable .",
    "hyperviscosity is used so that the inertial range covers a wide enough range of scales to measure accurate scalings .",
    "the magnetic prandtl number is @xmath67 and the initial conditions are a straight mean field with no fluctuations : @xmath68 and @xmath69 .    the simulation is initially forced on large scales ( @xmath70 and @xmath71 ) with gaussian white noise forcing @xmath65 , i.e. the random forcing amplitude is refreshed at each time step .",
    "this means that the input power can be controlled ; it is set to unity in the code units to produce strong turbulence .",
    "we choose to force only the velocity to match possible sources of solar wind forcing , such as velocity shears or large scale alfvn  waves , so @xmath72 at all times .",
    "we do not force the magnetic field since there is no known mechanism of breaking magnetic flux conservation at large scales .",
    "after a while , the forcing is removed and the simulation is left to freely decay .    a time series of various simulation parameters is shown in fig .  [ fig : timeseries ] .",
    "after the simulation begins , the values take a few time units to settle down , which is roughly the turnover time of the largest eddies .",
    "the transition between the forced and decaying periods of the simulation can be seen by the change in behaviour of all the quantities at @xmath73 , marked by the dashed line .",
    "the top two panels show the root mean square ( rms ) values of the elsasser variables , velocity and magnetic field .",
    "their values up to @xmath73 are determined by the forcing power and after @xmath73 by the decay of the turbulence .",
    "one noticeable feature is the oscillation in the velocity and magnetic field rms values with a period @xmath74 .",

    ", it can be seen that when measured with respect to the global mean field , the spectral indices of both the magnetic field and velocity are much less anisotropic than when they are measured with respect to the local mean field , e.g. in the velocity at small @xmath37 the spectral index is @xmath109 using the global mean field compared to @xmath110 using the local mean field .",
    "this is because the magnetic field fluctuations are large enough that the local mean field direction seen by an eddy is not the same as the global mean field direction .",
    "if the fluctuations are in critical balance , the angle between the local and global mean fields is @xmath111 .",
    "this suggests that when using the global mean field , the parallel scaling can not be correctly distinguished from the perpendicular scaling , even for small @xmath92 , because the angle of measurement to the local mean field needs to be less than @xmath112 .",
    "this interpretation is in agreement with previous solar wind studies that have used local and global mean field methods .",
    "those that use the global mean field method do not detect spectral index anisotropy @xcite and those that use a local mean field method do detect it @xcite .",
    "a similar situation is also seen in simulations , where scaling anisotropy is detected when a local mean field is used @xcite but not when a global mean field is used @xcite . here",
    ", we have shown that when keeping all other parameters constant , it is indeed the use of the global or local mean field that determines whether the anisotropic scaling is measured .",
    "it seems , therefore , that the alfvnic  fluctuations , both in solar wind turbulence and forced rmhd turbulence simulations , are more sensitive to the local mean field at the scale of the fluctuations than the global large scale field .    in the decaying simulation ( not shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : localvsglobal ] ) , the local and global mean field methods are much more similar , with the parallel scaling being steeper than @xmath2 in all cases .",
    "one possible reason for this is that the scale separation between the global mean field and the fluctuations is not large , meaning that the global and local mean fields are similar .",
    "this , combined with the smaller fluctuation amplitudes in the decaying simulation , could account for the observed behaviour .",
    "this could be tested by performing a decaying simulation with a larger inertial range .",
    "in this paper , we measure the power and spectral index anisotropy of alfvnic  turbulence in the solar wind and rmhd simulations using second - order structure functions .",
    "the analysis technique is essentially the same for both , allowing us to make a direct comparison . in the slow solar wind , we find that the magnetic field power and spectral index are anisotropic with respect to the local magnetic field direction .",
    "this anisotropy has now been seen by several different methods in both fast and slow wind . in both forced and decaying simulations we also find that the power and spectral index are anisotropic in both the velocity and magnetic field .    in the solar wind , the perpendicular spectral index of the magnetic field is close to @xmath0 , in agreement with the theory of @xcite . in the forced simulation ,",
    "the perpendicular spectral indices are close to @xmath0 for velocity and @xmath1 for the magnetic field .",
    "we are not aware of any theory that can account for this difference , although it may be caused by the velocity forcing . in the decaying simulation ,",
    "the perpendicular spectral index is close to @xmath0 for both the velocity and magnetic field . in all cases , the spectral index steepens at small angles to the magnetic field .",
    "the parallel scaling obtained in the solar wind and forced simulations is close to @xmath2 , which agrees with the theories based on critical balance of both @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the parallel spectral indices in the decaying simulation are @xmath100 for the velocity and @xmath101 for the magnetic field , which are steeper than the critical balance predictions .",
    "we also find that when measuring the anisotropy of the fluctuations in the forced simulation with respect to the global magnetic field , rather than the local mean field , the spectral indices are much less anisotropic .",
    "this is expected for critically balanced turbulence and is also consistent with previous solar wind and simulation results : those that used the local mean field saw anisotropic scaling and those that used the global mean field did not .",
    "this work was supported by stfc and the leverhulme trust network for magnetized plasma turbulence .",
