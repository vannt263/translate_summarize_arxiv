    "although tev scale supersymmetry ( susy ) is well motivated , the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) suffers from the @xmath3 problem and the little fine - tuning problem @xcite .",
    "the simple replacement of the @xmath3-term of the mssm by a singlet superfield coupling to higgs superfields leads to a global axial @xmath4 symmetry whose breaking would lead to an unwanted axion . in the next - to - minimal superymmetric standard model ( nmssm ) a cubic singlet coupling",
    "is also assumed , which breaks the axial @xmath4 symmetry down to a discrete @xmath5 subgroup . in this way",
    "the nmssm solves the @xmath3 problem and the little fine - tuning problem @xcite .",
    "however when the @xmath5 symmetry of the nmssm is broken it leads to cosmological domain walls .",
    "one way to overcome such problems is not to add the cubic singlet term but to gauge the axial @xmath4 symmetry so that the would - be axion gets eaten by a higgs mechanism resulting in a massive observable @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "of course such models come at a price since the gauged @xmath4 symmetry must be made anomaly - free , and this generally involves adding additional fermions which are sometimes ignored in simple phenomenological applications such as in the ussm @xcite .",
    "the e@xmath1ssm @xcite is a non - minimal supersymmetric model based on an underlying high - energy e@xmath1 symmetry where an additional low - energy gauged @xmath4 is identified amongst the e@xmath1 generators , and to cancel anomalies , complete 27 dimensional e@xmath1 families are assumed to survive down to the tev scale .",
    "there are many possible choices of gauged @xmath4 @xcite , but the e@xmath1ssm @xcite is uniquely defined by a particular choice @xmath7 under which the right - handed neutrinos are neutral , and so may become heavy , allowing naturally small physical neutrino masses .",
    "as in the nmssm , the e@xmath1ssm superpotential does not have an explicit @xmath3-term for the higgs doublets but instead contains a trilinear term that represents the interaction between the higgs doublets and an additional standard model singlet field @xmath8 .",
    "when this singlet field obtains a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) the trilinear term reduces to an effective @xmath3-term , thus providing a solution to the @xmath3 problem of the mssm .",
    "the e@xmath1ssm also contains an additional low - energy @xmath4 gauge symmetry which , as in ussm models , can be considered to be a gauged peccei - quinn symmetry . this local @xmath4 symmetry prevents the presence of an unwanted goldstone boson once the singlet field obtains its vev , which is eaten by the higgs mechanism resulting in a massive @xmath6 . for this @xmath4 group to be anomaly free , the entire matter content of the ( three families of ) @xmath9 multiplets of e@xmath1 are assumed to survive to low - energies ( apart from the right - handed neutrinos ) .",
    "each @xmath9 multiplet contains one generation of quarks and leptons ( including a right - handed neutrino ) , up and down type higgs doublet fields ( as well as their coloured partners ) , and a standard model singlet .",
    "the e@xmath1ssm thus contains the particle spectrum of the mssm plus two additional mssm higgs families , three families of coloured partners to the three higgs families , and three singlet fields . to achieve gauge coupling unification at the gut scale ,",
    "the e@xmath1ssm also contains two additional electro - weak doublets from a @xmath10 and @xmath11 incomplete multiplets of e@xmath1 which are sterile in the e@xmath1ssm superpotential . in a minimal version of the e@xmath1ssm , with string scale unification , these additional states are not present @xcite .",
    "the e@xmath1ssm @xcite , in common with the mssm and nmssm , is subject to the usual flavour problems to do with the unexplained spectrum of fermion ( including neutrino ) masses and mixings of the one hand , and the absence of flavour changing neutral currents ( fcncs ) generically expected in susy models on the other hand .",
    "in fact , the e@xmath1ssm also faces additional fcnc challenges due to the three higgs and singlet families .",
    "these challenges are resolved in the e@xmath1ssm by invoking a @xmath2 symmetry which only allows the third family of higgs and singlet to couple to quarks and leptons , with the first two higgs and singlet families being inert ( having zero vevs ) and fermiophobic ( not coupling to quarks and leptons ) .",
    "while this is perfectly acceptable from the phenomenological point of view , from a theoretical standpoint the @xmath2 symmetry looks rather _ ad hoc _ and adds an additional complication to the flavour problem of the e@xmath1ssm not present in the mssm or nmssm .    the discovery of neutrino mass and approximately tri - bimaximal lepton mixing @xcite suggests some kind of a non - abelian discrete family symmetry might be at work , at least in the lepton sector , and , assuming a gut - type of structure relating quarks and leptons at a certain high energy scale , within the quark sector too .",
    "the observed neutrino flavour symmetry may arise either directly or indirectly from a range of discrete symmetry groups @xcite .",
    "examples of the direct approach , in which one or more generators of the discrete family symmetry appears in the neutrino flavour group , are typically based on @xmath12 @xcite or a related group such as @xmath13 @xcite or @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "models of the indirect kind , in which the neutrino flavour symmetry arises accidentally , include also @xmath15 @xcite as well as @xmath0 @xcite and the continuous flavour symmetries like , e.g. , @xmath16 @xcite or @xmath17 @xcite which accommodate the discrete groups above as subgroups @xcite . in this letter",
    "we show how a @xmath0 family symmetry can resolve all the flavour problems of supersymmetric standard models containing three higgs families such as the e@xmath1ssm @xcite , including the fermion mass and mixing puzzle present in the sm , the fcnc problems introduced by the mssm and the additional puzzle of the origin of the @xmath2 symmetry peculiar to models such as the e@xmath1ssm .",
    "the @xmath0 family symmetry is chosen rather than , for example , @xmath13 or @xmath12 , since it allows complex representations whereas @xmath13 and @xmath12 only contain real representations .",
    "complex representations are required in family symmetry models in which the left - handed matter fields @xmath18 and right - handed matter fields @xmath19 both transform in triplet representations .",
    "this is to avoid the trivial combination @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the higgs field . to be concrete",
    "we focus on the e@xmath1ssm where , under the discrete non - abelian @xmath0 family symmetry , we shall assume that the quarks , leptons and higgs fields of the e@xmath1ssm all transform in triplet representations so that the family symmetry commutes with a possible high energy e@xmath1 symmetry .",
    "it is known that such a family symmetry can account for various yukawa couplings responsible for the masses of quarks and leptons , and serves to predict tri - bi - maximal mixing for leptons @xcite .",
    "it is also known that such family symmetries when applied to supersymmetry can provide a solution to the susy flavour and cp problems @xcite .",
    "the qualitatively new feature here is that such a family symmetry can solve the flavour changing neutral current problems introduced by extended higgs sectors by controlling the higgs couplings , similar to the @xmath22 symmetry of the e@xmath1ssm . as a consequence , we shall find predictions for the mass structure of the three families of higgs and higgsino fields and coloured d - fermions of the e@xmath1ssm .",
    "we remark that in a recent paper @xcite we also considered a non - abelian @xmath0 family symmetry in e@xmath1ssm models @xcite , however the higgs fields ( and d - fermions ) were taken to be singlets of the family symmetry , rather than triplets , and the @xmath22 symmetry was simply assumed .",
    "the outline of this letter is as follows . in the next section",
    "we describe how the @xmath0 family symmetry is applied to the e@xmath1ssm .",
    "this section is split up into subsections which look at how each term in the e@xmath1ssm superpotential is generated from higher - order operators once we apply the @xmath0 symmetry . in section 2.1",
    "we introduce the e@xmath1ssm renormalizable superpotential , in the absence of any family symmetry . in section 2.2",
    "we introduce the vacuum alignment required for the various @xmath0 flavon fields .",
    "then in section 2.3 we describe the non - renormalizable operators allowed by @xmath0 and other symmetries that lead to the quark and lepton yukawa interactions with the higgs fields .",
    "we also describe the types of messenger fields that are integrated out to generate the higher - order operators , and illustrate how the @xmath22 symmetry of the e@xmath1ssm effectively emerges from the high - energy theory . in section 2.4 we discuss how tri - bi - maximal mixing is generated in our model from the @xmath0 family symmetry and sequential dominance and then , in section 2.5 , we describe how the effective @xmath3-term of the mssm is generated and discuss the mass structure of the lsps that are formed from the inert higgsinos and singlinos . in sections 2.6 and 2.7 the mass structure of the d - fermions is explained and their decay channels are discussed . finally , in section 3 , we summarize our findings .",
    "the quark and lepton yukawa couplings in the e@xmath1ssm are derived from the e@xmath1 tensor product @xmath23 where @xmath24 label the three generations . to better understand where the yukawa couplings come from it",
    "is useful to re - write the superpotential in terms of the pati - salam subgroup of e@xmath1 under which each @xmath9 multiplet decomposes to the following representations : @xmath25 where @xmath18 contains the left - handed quark and lepton fields , @xmath26 contains the charge conjugated quark and lepton fields , @xmath21 contains up and down higgs - like fields , @xmath27 are the colour triplet partners of the higgs fields , and @xmath8 are standard model singlets though they are charged under the gauged @xmath7 symmetry which is broken at low energies @xcite . in this pati - salam notation",
    "the e@xmath1 tensor product @xmath28 from which the e@xmath1 superpotential is formed , decomposes in the following way , dropping all couplings and indices for clarity : @xmath29 the part of the e@xmath1ssm superpotential that contains the yukawa interactions for the quarks and leptons is @xmath30 and is the subject of the section 2.3 . in section 2.5",
    "we discuss the superpotential term @xmath31 from which the mssm effective @xmath3-term is generated .",
    "section 2.6 describes the term @xmath32 from which the exotic d - fermion states get mass , and section 2.7 looks at the operators @xmath33 which provide decay channels for the exotic d - fermions .",
    "although the above operators are written in a pati - salam notation we only do this for ease of notation .",
    "the model presented in this letter is in fact based on the standard model gauge symmetry rather than a pati - salam symmetry . for the rest of this letter we use a pati - salam notation unless stated otherwise .",
    ".this table illustrates how all the flavon fields and pati - salam states of the three copies of a @xmath9 e@xmath1 multiplet transform under the @xmath0 family symmetry and the additional constraining @xmath34 symmetry .",
    "an r - symmetry is also applied to the model which breaks to an r - parity once @xmath35 obtains a vacuum expectation value . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      in this letter we add a @xmath0 family symmetry which is broken via the vevs of the flavon triplets @xmath36 introduced in table 1 . a number of different triplet flavon fields with different expectation value directions in @xmath0 space are required to produce the desired mass structure for the e@xmath1ssm particles .",
    "four different types of directions for the flavon vevs are used in this letter ( dropping the vev brackets ) : @xmath37 in the case of direct models , in which one or more generators of the discrete family symmetry appears in the neutrino flavour group , the usual mechanism of vacuum alignment of flavon fields is based on f - term alignment which exploits driving fields in the superpotential as discussed in @xcite .",
    "this mechanism is also available to indirect models , in which the neutrino flavour symmetry arises accidentally , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "however , in the case of indirect models , an additional and elegant possibility for vacuum alignment becomes available that is not possible for direct models , namely d - term vacuum alignment introduced in @xcite as discussed below .",
    "one advantage of the d - term method is that the terms required to achieve vacuum alignment originate from the khler potential and so are not restricted by the symmetries which are introduced to control the terms in the holomorphic superpotential .",
    "thus the required terms may always be present independent of the symmetries of the model . in the case of the present model we shall use the d - term vacuum alignment method to generate the above flavon vevs , following largely the discussion in @xcite .    an elegant way to obtain the alignments of eq.[eq : vevs ]",
    "is to start with a flavon scalar potential of the form @xcite : @xmath38 where the index @xmath39 labels the components of a particular flavon triplet @xmath36 and : @xmath40 in a supersymmetric theory the quartic terms may arise from @xmath27-terms , after which this vacuum alignment mechanism is named @xcite , which take the form : @xmath41_d}{m_p^4 } \\rightarrow   \\frac{f_{\\chi}^2}{m_p^4 } ( \\phi^{\\dagger } \\phi \\phi^{\\dagger } \\phi ) \\sim \\frac{m_{3/2}^2}{m_p^2}(\\phi^{\\dagger } \\phi \\phi^{\\dagger } \\phi ) \\ ] ] where the f - component of the @xmath0 singlet @xmath42 acquires a susy breaking vev @xmath43 , leading to a gravitino mass @xmath44 .",
    "hence supersymmetry is broken and the scalar potential @xmath45 gets a contribution of the type @xmath46 with small @xmath47 .",
    "the quadratic mass term originates also from a soft supersymmetry breaking mass term , and this term is thus expected to have a soft mass squared @xmath48 .",
    "we suppose that the flavon mass squared @xmath49 is positive at the ( reduced ) planck scale @xmath50 which prevents symmetry breaking at @xmath50 ( if @xmath51 at @xmath50 then we would expect a vev given by @xmath52 ) .",
    "then we assume that the soft mass squared @xmath49 of a given flavon is driven negative by radiative corrections at some scale @xmath53 , which triggers a vev for that flavon set by the scale @xmath54 , a mechanism which has been widely used in different contexts ( see for example @xcite ) . to see this explicitly here",
    ", we may approximate the potential , including radiatively corrected logarithmically running masses , to be of the form @xmath55 , dropping the small quartic terms .",
    "the first derivative of the potential with respect to @xmath56 is @xmath57 $ ] which is zero for @xmath58 . as the different flavons have different superpotential couplings to heavy states , and since the soft masses run logarithmically with energy scale , the @xmath54 scales defined above may differ greatly for the different flavons .",
    "thus a hierarchy between the vevs of various flavon fields is possible , and also stable , in the framework of the radiative breaking mechanism @xcite .    only the term @xmath59 in eqs.[eq : d - term],[eq : deltav ] determines the alignment , where @xmath60 , and the sign of @xmath61 is undetermined . for @xmath62",
    "we obtain the alignment along the direction of the vev of @xmath63 , while @xmath64 can give rise to that of @xmath65 .",
    "the configuration @xmath66 can then be generated using a leading higher order term that requires that the vev is orthogonal to both @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "all these operators can be used to generate the vev configurations of the flavons in eq.[eq : vevs ] .",
    "a more detailed discussion on this subject can be found in @xcite , where the vacuum alignment operators required for the flavon fields that are used in this letter is provided except for the flavon fields @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "we assume the same vacuum alignment operators used in @xcite which align all the flavon fields except for @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "for these additional flavon fields to get the required direction of vacuum expectation values , we use the following d - terms ( omitting @xmath73 factors ) : @xmath74 and @xmath75 both with negative coefficients , and similarly for the @xmath71 and @xmath72 flavons .",
    "these terms cause @xmath70 and @xmath69 to get vevs in the same direction as the pre - aligned fields @xmath76 and @xmath77 respectively .",
    "note that the leading order potential , including @xmath59 , is invariant under a product of global @xmath4 symmetries , one for each flavon component .",
    "however this symmetry is broken explicitly by superpotential terms including the yukawa superpotential discussed in the following subsection .",
    "it is also broken by higher order terms in the scalar potential involving purely flavon superfields as indicated by the dots in eq.[eq : d - term ] .",
    "an example of such a term in the potential which is invariant under all the symmetries in table  1 but which would violate the additional global @xmath4 symmetries is @xmath78 .",
    "inserting flavon vevs of order @xmath54 , such a term would lead to pseudo - goldstone - boson ( pgb ) square masses of order @xmath79 , where generally we expect @xmath80 leading to pgb masses below the tev scale ( and perhaps much lighter ) with possible interesting phenomenological and astrophysical implications beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "similarly , inserting the flavon vevs of order @xmath54 , one sees that this additional eighth order term gives a contribution to the potential suppressed relative to the previous quartic terms by a factor of @xmath81 so that , assuming @xmath80 , it will not perturb the previous vacuum alignment arguments appreciably .",
    "it may seem surprising that both the symmetry breaking and vacuum alignment are governed by quartic terms with very small coefficients @xmath47 .",
    "in particular one may worry that other quartic operators with larger coefficients are present in the theory and that they could destabilize the symmetry breaking and alignment scheme described above .",
    "however , given the field content and symmetries assumed for the model , in particular the gauged @xmath7 and the @xmath82 symmetries , it is not possible to write down any operators which would lead to terms in the flavon potential with competing or larger coefficients than those of the quartic terms above and which would destabilize the vacuum , and so the quartic terms considered above are the dominant ones .",
    "on the other hand , we have seen that such symmetries imply approximate global @xmath4 symmetries which are only broken by higher order operators , leading to pgb masses below the tev scale and possibly much lighter .",
    "the presence of such pgbs seems to be generic to the type of radiative symmetry breaking associated with d - term vacuum alignment , and this observation appears to be robust although it has not been remarked upon before .      under the @xmath0 family symmetry",
    "the @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath21 transform as triplets so that the superpotential @xmath83 becomes @xmath84 where @xmath24 are now @xmath0 indices .",
    "table 1 describes how all the pati - salam states from a @xmath9 representation and the flavons transform under the family symmetry and the additional symmetries that constrain the model such as @xmath85 symmetry which distinguishes the higgs and @xmath27 fields ( but unlike @xmath22 treats all three higgs families identically ) .",
    "the lowest order yukawa superpotential consistent with the symmetries of table 1 is :    @xmath86    @xmath87    @xmath88    @xmath89    @xmath90    where all order 1 coupling constants are suppressed .",
    "@xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath63 , @xmath65 are all anti - triplets of the @xmath0 family symmetry , @xmath93 is a triplet of @xmath0 , @xmath94 is a singlet of @xmath0 but a @xmath95 of the @xmath96 subgroup of e@xmath1 , and @xmath97 is some messenger scale that is discussed further in section 2.3.2 . the @xmath92 field is taken to transform under the @xmath85 symmetry so that all of the above operators respect this symmetry .",
    "we assume that this flavon field and @xmath65 get a vev in the third component of @xmath0 , @xmath91 gets an equal but opposite vev in the second and third components of @xmath0 , and @xmath63 gets an equal vev in the first , second and third components of @xmath0 .",
    "the vacuum alignment of these fields was discussed in section 2.2 .",
    "for ease of notation we denote @xmath36 as a field that transforms as @xmath98 under @xmath0 and @xmath99 as a field that transforms as a @xmath100 .",
    "in addition to the @xmath0 family symmetry , table 1 also contains the vertical symmetries @xmath101 .",
    "these symmetries prevent interactions that would otherwise be allowed by the @xmath0 symmetry and would introduce certain phenomenological issues to the model . in particular , the @xmath85 symmetry is used to differentiate certain superfields including the higgs from others , and is instrumental in preventing flavour changing neutral currents due to the extended higgs sector of the model , as discussed further in the following section .",
    "the @xmath102 is introduced in section 2.5 and is primarily used to lead to a non - renormalizable operator that reduces to an effective @xmath3-term at the soft susy scale , while forbidding other operators .",
    "note that @xmath102 also forbids the renormalizable operator @xmath103 but this is not a crucial requirement and similar terms are generated at higher order .",
    "the @xmath104 symmetries are invoked to allow only certain combinations of flavon fields , as in @xcite .",
    "for example , the @xmath4 symmetry prevents the effective yukawa operator @xmath105 from appearing in eq.[eq:1 ] . finally , the @xmath82 symmetry is an r - symmetry that is assumed to reduce to r - parity allowing the lsp of the model to be stable .      as discussed in the introduction ,",
    "the e@xmath1ssm @xcite is subject to the `` usual '' fcnc and cp problems generically expected in susy models , due to susy loop diagrams with off - diagonal soft mass insertions , as well as `` additional '' fcnc challenges arising from tree - level higgs exchange due to the three higgs and singlet families .",
    "the introduction of a family symmetry , together with the idea of spontaneous cp violation by the flavons , leads to a natural suppression of the `` usual '' fcnc and cp violating operators and provides a solution to the susy flavour and cp problems @xcite .",
    "the impact of the higher order khler operators has been systematically explored for @xmath17 in @xcite and the results there are directly applicable to the present model based on @xmath0 . in the exact @xmath0 family symmetry",
    "limit the soft masses are universal : @xmath106 however , in this limit , the yukawa couplings and trilinear terms vanish .",
    "in reality the @xmath0 family symmetry has to be broken , leading to violations of universality .",
    "for example , the soft masses allowed by the @xmath0 family symmetry can be written as : @xmath107 where the generic subscript @xmath108 runs over all the relevant flavon species .",
    "the above off - diagonal soft mass terms are suppressed by @xmath109 factors from the ratios of the flavon vevs and the messenger masses . in @xcite",
    "it was rigorously shown that off - diagonal terms from flavons of the type in table  1 lead to suppressed fcncs concistent with present experimental limits .",
    "the family symmetry thus naturally suppresses the `` usual '' type of induced fcncs due to off - diagonal soft masses and can therefore provide a resolution to the generic susy fcnc problem .",
    "in addition to the fcncs associated with the soft susy potential , fcncs can also originate from models with the extended higgs sectors , leading to `` additional '' fcnc problems arising from tree - level higgs exchange .",
    "however , as we shall now show , the @xmath85 symmetry , in combination with the @xmath0 family symmetry , suppresses fcncs due to tree - level higgs exchange in the present model .",
    "this can be understood by noting that , since @xmath69 transforms under @xmath85 , it will couple to the higgs fields but not to the quarks and leptons .",
    "this can be understood by considering the messenger diagrams of the above higher - order operators where @xmath69 will only be allowed to attach itself to the higgs fields ( and the higgs - like messenger fields ) if all the messenger fields are even under @xmath85 .",
    "this is illustrated by figure  1 .",
    "once @xmath69 gets a vev , only the third generation of the up and down higgs fields @xmath110 are allowed to couple to the quarks and leptons .",
    "it is these up and down higgs fields which we therefore take to obtain electro - weak scale vevs , and thus act like the up and down higgs fields of the mssm .",
    "the @xmath85 and @xmath0 symmetries prevent the first and second generation of higgs fields from interacting with the quarks and leptons at tree - level and so there can be no tree - level fcnc processes involving the neutral scalar components of these fields . in the e@xmath1ssm a @xmath111 symmetry called @xmath22",
    "is applied to all the @xmath9 fields except for the third generation of higgs fields and singlet fields to prevent the first and second generation of higgs fields from interacting with the quarks and leptons at tree - level .",
    "the @xmath85 in this letter is therefore acting as the @xmath22 symmetry of the e@xmath1ssm even though it does not distinguish between the different higgs fields .",
    "the @xmath22 symmetry in the e@xmath1ssm is broken by an additional discrete @xmath111 symmetry that forbids the colour triplets of the higgs fields causing rapid proton decay @xcite .",
    "this additional discrete symmetry will not break the @xmath85 symmetry here , however any misalignment of @xmath69 will play the role of @xmath22 breaking , as discussed later .      the messenger fields @xmath112 that are responsible for the suppression factors in eq.[eq:1 ] include fields that transform in the same way as quarks and leptons under the standard model gauge group and as singlets , triplets and anti - triplets of @xmath0 .",
    "we refer to these type of messenger field as quark and lepton - like messengers @xmath113 .",
    "in addition there are also messengers that are singlets of @xmath0 and transform in the same way as higgs fields under the standard model gauge group .",
    "we refer to these messenger fields as higgs - like messengers @xmath114 .",
    "all these messenger fields are taken to carry positive @xmath85 parity , and we assume that the higgs - like messengers @xmath114 are heavier than the quark and lepton - like messengers @xmath113 so that the latter dominate the messenger diagrams .",
    "we further assume that the right - handed quark and lepton messengers @xmath115 are heavier than their left - handed counterparts @xmath116 so that the former dominate over the latter .",
    "the messenger diagrams are illustrated by figure 1 .    to create a smaller hierarchy in the down quark sector compared to the up quark sector , we take the mass of the @xmath100 and @xmath98 up and down higgs messengers @xmath117 to be equal , but the up right - handed quark messengers @xmath118 that are @xmath100 and @xmath98 and singlets of @xmath17 to have a mass @xmath119 that is greater than the right - handed down quark messengers @xmath120 by approximately a factor of three .",
    "for the top yukawa coupling constant to be greater than the bottom yukawa coupling constant we take the @xmath65 flavon to transform as a @xmath121 of the @xmath122 subgroup of @xmath123 and choose its vev so that @xmath124 as in @xcite . in terms of these messenger masses ,",
    "the vev scales for the various flavon fields are then taken to be the following : 0.8 ,   _ u ,   ^2_u where @xmath125 . at the gut scale the yukawa coupling for the top and bottom quark is expected to be about @xmath126 in third family yukawa unification models based on the mssm with large @xmath127 @xcite .",
    "we therefore assume that @xmath128 . by comparison , in @xmath0 models in which the higgs is a singlet and",
    "there is a messenger - scale suppression factor to the second power , @xmath129 is assumed to be about @xmath130 @xcite .",
    "note that if @xmath129 was taken to be exactly or very close to @xmath131 then higher - order operators would be no - more suppressed than lower - order operators , so such large expansion parameters are of some concern , and in this respect the model is on a similar footing to that @xcite .    in order to avoid problems with unification , we assume that the mass of the above messenger fields have masses close to the conventional gut scale , which suggests that the @xmath0 family symmetry is also broken close to gut scale . in principle",
    "this could lead to gut scale threshold effects , but we do not consider this further here . below the gut scale",
    "the particle content of the model below the gut scale is then the equivalent to that of the e@xmath1ssm , with the possible inclusion of additional sm singlet flavon fields close to the gut scale that will not affect the running of the gauge coupling constants . as in the e@xmath1ssm , below the gut scale",
    "there are three copies of complete @xmath9 representations of e@xmath1 plus two additional electroweak doublets with masses of order the tev scale , with the gauge coupling constants predicted to unify at the conventional gut scale but with a larger unified gauge coupling constant than in the mssm @xcite .    in section 2.5",
    "we also discuss the messenger fields which are responsible for the higher - order operators that generate the effective @xmath3-term .",
    "these particular messengers include higgs - like messengers and messengers that transform as singlets of the standard model gauge group .    .",
    "]      inputting the above flavon vevs into the superpotential given by eq.[eq:1 ] generates the following effective yukawa matrices for the quarks and leptons : @xmath132 where @xmath133 , and @xmath134 at the gut scale @xcite .",
    "the above form of yukawa matrices have been shown to produce a realistic ckm matrix and realistic mass hierarchies for the up and down quarks @xcite .",
    "the @xmath94 higgs field in the superpotential eq.[eq:1 ] is used to generate the georgi - jarlskog relations in the down quark and charged lepton matrices so that the correct hierarchy in the charged leptons is generated at the electroweak scale @xcite .      to generate tri - bi - maximal mixing we use constrained sequential dominance @xcite in which the right - handed neutrinos have a hierarchy in mass .",
    "this hierarchy is generated by the following operators : @xmath135    @xmath136    @xmath137    where @xmath138 and @xmath139 are triplets of @xmath0 , and @xmath140 is from a @xmath141 of e@xmath1 and a @xmath98 of @xmath0 .",
    "the above operators together with the dirac operator involving the left - handed and right - handed neutrinos from the superpotential @xmath142 create a conventional type i see - saw mechanism which generates an effective majorana mass matrix for the left - handed neutrinos .",
    "due to form of the right - handed majorana mass matrix , and the dirac mass matrix from eq.[eq:1 ] , the effective majorana matrix for the left - handed neutrinos is of a form that is diagonalized by a tri - bi - maximal matrix ( see @xcite for more details ) .",

    ", this superpotential term reduces to @xmath145 where @xmath146 and @xmath147 denote up and down higgs fields . in this letter",
    "we take the singlet fields @xmath148 , like the higgs fields , to transform as a triplet of the @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "we also take them to be odd under a @xmath102 symmetry and even under the @xmath85 symmetry . the operator @xmath145 is thus forbidden and is instead generated by the following higher - order operators :    @xmath149    @xmath150    @xmath151    where the flavons have the charges shown in table 1 and we take the scale of these flavon vevs to be such that @xmath152 , @xmath153 and @xmath154 where @xmath155 is the mass scale of the singlet - like messengers and @xmath156 is the mass scale of the higgs - like messengers .",
    "the messenger diagrams responsible for generating the above higher - order operators are represented by figure 2 .",
    "the first operator in eq.[eq : shh ] is responsible for generating an effective @xmath3-term for the third family of higgs fields once the flavons fields and the third family singlet field @xmath35 obtain vevs . since we assume that only the third family of higgs obtains a vev , this effective @xmath3-term acts like the @xmath3-term of the mssm higgs fields .",
    "the effective @xmath3-term will have a value @xmath157 , which will be approximately @xmath158 if @xmath159 , which is consistent with the experimental bound for the mass of a @xmath6 . if we assume a radiative symmetry breaking explanation for the third family singlet field s vev then it will be related to the singlet s soft mass term .",

    "this results in a mixing between all of these states which is represented by the following matrix : @xmath160 this matrix is written in the basis @xmath161 so that @xmath162 are @xmath163 matrices where @xmath164 . because of the anti - symmetric tensor in the eq.[eq : shh ] we find that @xmath165 , whereas @xmath166 is given by the following : a_21 = (    ccc 0 & _ s _ h s^3 & _ s h^3_u + _ s _ h s^3 & 0 & _ s h^3_d + _ s h^3_u & _ s h^3_d & 0    ) , where this matrix couples the states @xmath167 to the states @xmath168 . in the limit of exact @xmath85 and @xmath102 symmetry",
    "these higgsino and singlino states will decouple from the usual inert ussm states such as the third family of higgsinos , singlinos , wino and hypercharge bino fields .",
    "see @xcite for a full discussion on the mixing between the usual ussm states and the additional e@xmath1ssm states where it is also shown that the mixing between the @xmath7 bino and higgsino and singlino fields is expected to be small .",
    "the above higgsino and singlino neutral states combine to form two degenerate lsp states , approximately consisting of a dirac state formed from ( dropping the tildes ) @xmath169 and @xmath170 , together with two generally heavier approximately degenerate dirac states formed from @xmath171 and @xmath172 on the one hand and @xmath173 and @xmath174 on the other hand . with exact r - parity",
    "the dirac lsp state formed from @xmath169 and @xmath170 becomes a dark matter candidate .",
    "however the masses of the degenerate lsps @xmath169 and @xmath170 can be split if the first and second generation of higgs and singlet fields are distinguished from one another .",
    "one way of achieving this is to assume that the flavon field @xmath69 gets small vacuum expectation values in its first and second components of @xmath0 such that @xmath175 where @xmath176 .",
    "this might be expected to occur from higher - order operators that affect the vacuum alignment of the fields .",
    "two wimps that are almost degenerate in mass have been recently used to explain the dama data @xcite .",
    "note that although the @xmath85 and @xmath102 symmetries of this model have combined to operate in a similar manner to the original @xmath22 symmetry of the e@xmath1ssm , they allow fewer operators than the latter .",
    "the operators allowed by the original @xmath22 symmetry but which are not present in this model are @xmath177 , @xmath178 and @xmath179 . such operators are responsible for the @xmath180 and @xmath181 matrices being non - zero in the e@xmath1ssm .",
    "for the @xmath7 group of the e@xmath1ssm to be anomaly free , all the colour partners @xmath182 of the higgs fields from the three @xmath9 multiplets must have masses lower than the energy scale of @xmath183 .",
    "these masses come from the pati - salam superpotential @xmath32 which is derived from the e@xmath1 superpotential of the e@xmath1ssm given by eq.[eq : w ] . in terms of a standard model gauge symmetry",
    "we represent this operator as @xmath184 where @xmath27 is a triplet of the strong force gauge group @xmath185 but @xmath186 is an anti - triplet .    in this letter",
    "we assume that the exotic particles @xmath182 , like the higgs fields transform as a triplet of @xmath0 and have odd @xmath85 parity but even @xmath102 parity .",
    "the allowed higher order operator thus mirrors the allowed operators that provide effective @xmath3-terms for the higgs fields : @xmath187    @xmath188    @xmath189    the mass scale for the exotic - like messengers @xmath190 responsible for the operators in eq.[eq : sdd ] however need not be the same as the higgs messengers .",
    "we define the messenger scales such that @xmath191 , @xmath192 , @xmath193 and @xmath194 .",
    "we also assume that the exotic - like messengers , like the higgs - like messengers only have even @xmath85 parity but can carry either even or odd @xmath102 parity .",
    "the messenger diagrams that are assumed to be responsible for generating the higher - order operators in eq.[eq : sdd ] are analogous to those in figure 2 but with the higgs fields and higgs - like messenger fields replaced with exotic fields and exotic - like messenger fields respectively .",
    "the d - fermions thus obtain mass once the flavons and @xmath35 obtain an expectation value .",
    "we write these masses in matrix form @xmath195 where @xmath196 is the following : @xmath197 the parameters @xmath198 , @xmath199 and @xmath200 can then be chosen for the exotic masses to be larger than the experimental bound of @xmath201 .",
    "two of the exotic states are predicted to be degenerate in mass with the third also being degenerate in the approximation that @xmath202 and @xmath203 .",
    "this mass structure is in stark contrast to the hierarchical structure of the quarks and leptons despite all the states being triplets of the family symmetry .",
    "if the exotic @xmath27 particles are taken to have the same @xmath0 , @xmath85 and @xmath102 quantum numbers as the higgs fields @xmath21 , then they can decay @xcite via the following non - renormalizable operators : @xmath204    @xmath205    @xmath206    @xmath207    however not all these operators can be allowed otherwise this would lead to very rapid proton decay .",
    "thus , we assume either the @xmath208 or @xmath209 discrete symmetries that are used in the e@xmath1ssm @xcite , where these symmetries differentiate between different fermion @xmath210 components . under the @xmath208 symmetry the leptons and",
    "d states are odd whereas , under the @xmath209 symmetry , only the leptons are odd and all other particles are even . these discrete symmetries remove some of the above operators , such that the remaining operators correspond to the d - states coupling as either diquarks or leptoquarks .",
    "this effectively prevents the proton from decaying due to couplings with the d - states , but still allowing the latter states to decay , thus avoiding any nucleosynthesis difficulties @xcite .",
    "note that this discrete symmetry breaks the pati - salam gauge symmetry but respects the standard model gauge symmetry assumed in this letter .    in the limit that @xmath211 exactly , the decay channels of the exotic states in the model used in this letter will be different to those of the e@xmath1ssm since only the third generation of the exotic states couples directly to quarks and leptons , whereas all three generations of the exotic states in the e@xmath1ssm interact directly with the quarks and leptons .",
    "the difference between the two models occurs because we have taken the exotic states to transform under @xmath85 , which results in an effective @xmath22 symmetry for only the first and second generation of exotic states . in the e@xmath1ssm",
    "however all three generations transform under @xmath22 .",
    "this application of the @xmath85 symmetry results in the decay products of the first and second generation of exotic states always involving a singlet field @xmath148 .",
    "if instead @xmath212 as discussed in section 2.5 , then all the @xmath0 components of the exotic states will mix via the mass terms presented in section 2.6 .",
    "this results in the same exotic decay channels as used in the e@xmath1ssm but with some being more suppressed since @xmath213 .",
    "in this letter we have shown how fcnc s due to models with three families of higgs fields may be tamed by the same family symmetry which predicts tri - bi - maximal lepton mixing and provides a solution to the susy fcnc and cp problems . to be concrete",
    "we have focussed on the e@xmath1ssm where we have shown how the flavour problem can be solved by using a @xmath0 family symmetry .",
    "the three 27 dimensional families of the e@xmath1ssm , including the three families of higgs fields , transform in a triplet representation of the @xmath0 family symmetry , allowing the family symmetry to commute with a possible high energy e@xmath1 symmetry .",
    "the @xmath0 family symmetry breaking considered here , together with a vertical @xmath85 symmetry which does not distinguish between the three families , gives rise effectively to the @xmath2 symmetry of the e@xmath1ssm , which solves the flavour changing neutral current problem of the three families of higgs fields .",
    "the main phenomenological predictions of the model are tri - bi - maximal mixing for leptons , two almost degenerate lsps and two almost degenerate families of colour triplet d - fermions , providing a clear prediction for the lhc . in addition",
    "the d - term vacuum alignment mechanism described here leads to pgbs with masses below the tev scale , and possibly much lighter , which appears to be a quite general and robust prediction of any model based on the d - term vacuum alignment mechanism .",
