    "the anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) make a small , but unique group ( 5 or 6 ) in the x - ray pulsars ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "their characteristics are as follows ( see @xcite for a review ) ; ( 1 ) much softer x - ray spectra than the more common high mass x - ray binary pulsars , ( 2 ) the steady spin - down on the timescales of @xmath4 yrs , ( 3 ) spin periods narrowly range in @xmath5 s. axps are mysterious , since their energy source is still unknown .",
    "first of all , they can not be rotation - powered , because observed x - ray luminosities ( @xmath6 ergs / s ) exceed the spin - down energy loss rates of the neutron stars ( @xmath7 ergs / s ) .",
    "secondly , they are unlikely accretion - powered , because any binary companion stars , which provide the accreting mass to the neutron stars , have not been detected .",
    "the most plausible and exotic hypothesis is that axps are isolated neutron stars with ultra - strong magnetic field ( @xmath8 g ) , so - called `` magnetar '' ( @xcite ) . in this model",
    "the x - ray photons are produced by the release of strong magnetic energy stored in the neutron star crust ( @xcite ) . due to the strong magnetic field ( @xmath9 g ) , exotic qed processes",
    "are predicted : photon splitting and vacuum polarization , etc .",
    "there are another type of magnetar candidate : soft gamma - ray repeaters ( sgrs ) .",
    "axps and sgrs exist on a similar region in @xmath10@xmath11@xmath12 diagram .",
    "the persistent x - ray luminosities of sgrs are also much larger than their spin - down luminosities .",
    "in contrast to axps , sgrs show occasional short bursts , and have relatively harder spectra ( @xmath13 ) and stronger magnetic fields than those of axps ( @xcite ) .",
    "1e 1841 - 045 was discovered as a compact x - ray source centered in a supernova remnant ( snr ) kes 73 ( g27.4 + 0.0 ) by _ einstein _ hri @xcite .",
    "the kinematic distance toward the snr was determined to be between 6 and 7.5 kpc , by using the h i absorption data obtained with the vla ( @xcite ) .",
    "the x - ray pulsation of @xmath14 s period was discovered with _",
    "asca _ @xcite and the central source has been identified as an anomalous x - ray pulsar .",

    "the source was placed on the nominal target position of acis - s3 , a back - illuminated ccd on the spectroscopic array ( acis - s ) with good charge transfer efficiency and spectral resolution ( @xcite ) .",

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      to search for possible spectral variations as a function of the pulse phase , we have divided the data into six phase intervals : off - pulse ( 0.0@xmath110.2 ) , rising ( 0.2@xmath110.4 ) , top of the first pulse ( 0.4@xmath110.6 ) , valley ( 0.6@xmath110.7 ) , top of the second pulse ( 0.7@xmath110.9 ) , and off - pulse ( 0.9@xmath111.0 ) ( see figure [ fig : pf ] ) .",
    "we have fitted all phases with absorbed power - law function plus blackbody model , where the column density @xmath25 at each phase is fixed to the best value obtained in   [ subsec : phase - integrated ] . due to the limited photon statistics ,",

    "[ fig : pf ] , the blackbody normalizations are shown as the radii of the emission region on the neutron star surface , assuming a distance of 7.0 kpc .    we have repeated the similar procedure for the absorbed two blackbody model .",
    "we obtained essentially the same result with the previous model , where the normalization of the power - law component is replaced with the higher temperature blackbody component in the bottom panels of figure [ fig : pf ] .",
    "we fit the one - dimensional cc mode image with a model consisting of a point source ( pulsar ) and a constant background ( snr ) , and evaluated the normalizations of the two components . to simulate the point source",

    "v4.0 and input the best - fit power - law plus blackbody model spectrum , obtained in   [ subsec : phase - integrated ] . the model with the best - fit normalizations is shown in figure [ fig : 1d ] .",
    "the residual from the model is largest at @xmath41 arcsec , indicating that the image is more extended than the point spread function by @xmath42 arcsec ( @xmath43 pixel ) .",
    "we , however , do not consider this spatial extent to be significant , because the image is constructed with dithering and rotation , and is unavoidably blurred to an order of 1 pixel .",
    "we then estimated the upper limits for a possible pulsar nebula flux .",
    "we fit the image with a model including a point source , extended nebula , and constant background .",
    "the nebula is simulated by _",
    "marx _ v4.0 as a sphere filled with uniform emissivity centered on the point source , and the spectrum is the absorbed power - law model with a photon index of @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "we obtained upper limits for the nebula with radii of 1.0 and 3.0 arcsec to be @xmath46 ergs @xmath28 @xmath29 and @xmath47 ergs @xmath28 @xmath29 in the energy range of 0.6@xmath117.0 kev , respectively .",
    "thanks to the unprecedented spatial resolution of _ chandra _ , the pulsar spectrum is clearly discriminated from the surrounding snr for the first time . before this observation , this source is only fitted with a power - law function , then resulting in the power - law index of @xmath48 by _ asca _ ( 0.9@xmath118.0 kev ) @xcite and @xmath49 by _ rxte _ ( 2@xmath1110 kev ) @xcite .    in our analysis",
    ", we find that the power - law plus blackbody model is preferred to a single power - law function , where the best spectral parameters are @xmath0 , @xmath1 kev , and @xmath2 . this spectral model may be typical for axps , because four axps , 1e 2259 + 586 , 4u 0142 + 61 , 1e 1048.1 - 5937 , and 1rxs j170849.0 - 400910 are also fitted with this model ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the blackbody temperature of 1e 1841 - 045 is similar to these four axps , but the power - law index is significantly flatter than that of others ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "this value is close to that of sgrs ( @xmath51 ) , and its estimated dipole magnetic field ( @xmath52 g ) is also close to that of sgrs ( @xcite ) ; @xmath53 g for sgr 1900 + 14 and @xmath54 g for sgr 1806 - 20 . from these aspects , 1e 1841 - 045",
    "is the closest object to sgrs among axps .",
    "the radius of the blackbody emission region is @xmath55 km .",
    "this is smaller than the whole neutron star surface , but yet much greater than the polar cap hot spot expected for magnetically channeled accretion .",
    "furthermore , the blackbody radius varies with pulse phases in sinusoidal form , suggesting the inhomogeneous distribution of the temperature on the neutron star surface , which might be caused by non - isotropic heat conduction ( @xcite ) , or heating due to magnetic field decay .",
    "spectral hardening at the second peak is found for the first time .",
    "this feature could be attributed to an excess of the power - law component at that phase , when fitted with a power - law plus blackbody model .",
    "since the phase of maximal normalization of the power - law component is different from the blackbody maximum , the emission region of the power - law component is clearly displaced from the hot thermal region .",
    "we also obtained a good fit for a two - blackbody model .",
    "therefore , we can interpret those that there are two emission regions with different energy spectra ; one is a hot spot on the neutron star surface which emits lower temperature blackbody radiation , and the other is a non - thermal source presumably in the magnetosphere , or another hot spot on the neutron star surface with a higher temperature ."
