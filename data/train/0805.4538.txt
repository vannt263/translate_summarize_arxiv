    "the cross section for nuclear reactions between charged particles at low energies is mainly determined by the penetration probability through the coulomb barrier , which results in a steep exponential decrease towards lower energies . at sufficiently low energies , however , this decrease is slowed down due to screening the coulomb barrier by the inevitable presence of surrounding electrons .",
    "the electron screening was originally taken into account for nuclear reactions preceding in dense astrophysical plasmas in the interior of stars @xcite where the nuclear reaction rates can be increased even by many orders of magnitude . for laboratory investigations of nuclear reactions at very low energies , this effect was theoretically described @xcite and experimentally observed in different fusion reactions on gas targets , e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the corresponding enhancement of the nuclear cross section could be explained by the gain of electron binding energies between the initial distant atoms and the final fused atom .",
    "this was attributed to the raise of the kinetic energy of colliding nuclei and called electron screening energy . for the first time , the electron screening effect resulting from much more important for astrophysical applications free electrons was investigated in the d+d fusion reactions taking place in metallic environments @xcite .",
    "the experimentally determined screening energies for some heavier metals were one order of magnitude larger than the gas target value @xcite and larger by a factor of about four than the theoretical predictions @xcite .",
    "these experimental results were also confirmed by other authors @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , the electron screening effect in the d+d fusion reactions has been studied for over 50 different metals and some insulators @xcite allowing , in principle , for a systematic study of the target material dependence of the electron screening energy . unfortunately , there are some discrepancies between experimental values obtained by different groups @xcite .",
    "they probably arise from some experimental systematic uncertainties connected with oxidation of the target surface or with a high mobility of the implanted deuterons under beam irradiation , which can lead to unstable deuteron density profiles within the target .",
    "both effects play a crucial role for the experimental determination of the screening energies @xcite .",
    "the basic quantity received from the experiment is the nuclear reaction yield which is given for a thick target as an integral over the range of the projectiles @xmath2dx$ ] with the target nuclei density distribution @xmath3 and the cross section @xmath4 .",
    "so deviations in the observed yield have the two principal causes : changes in the deuteron density profile and modification of the cross section , probably by the screening effect , which are merged in the integrant product @xmath5 $ ] .",
    "some standard experimental difficulties have been already discussed in our preceding paper @xcite where an especially adapted data acquisition and analysis method , allowing us to discern between changes in @xmath3 and @xmath4 , has been presented in a systematic manner . based on this method ,",
    "we report here some new experimental results and estimate experimental uncertainties of previous experiments .",
    "we additionally compare data obtained by different groups and discuss systematic errors of applied experimental and analytical methods .    from the theoretical point of view",
    ", the large number of experimental data corrected for the discussed experimental uncertainties enables a comparison with theoretical predictions .",
    "the first ab - initio quantum mechanical calculation of the screening energy in a crystal environment has been recently performed using realistic wave functions @xcite",
    ". however , the results are still unsatisfying because of the very high demand for computational power limiting the model accuracy .",
    "thus , the self - consistent dielectric function theory developed previously @xcite will be used here for the calculation of the screening energy contributions coming not only from free electrons but also from bound electrons of reacting nuclei and host metals .",
    "additionally , the interaction with the crystal lattice will be included .",
    "the theoretical results will be extended for comparison with the last experimental studies of the electron screening in nuclear reactions between heavier nuclei @xcite and in radioactive decays @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "it has recently been suggested that the enhanced electron screening can be explained within the classical debye - hckel model @xcite .",
    "the idea has been supported by an observation of the predicted inverse proportionality of the experimental screening energies to the square root of the absolute target temperature @xcite . as a consequence",
    "one could expect a magnification of the @xmath6 and @xmath7 decay rates when radioactive sources would be put in metals at cryogenic temperatures .",
    "even though the debye screening can not be applied to strongly coupled electron plasmas , as metals at moderate temperatures are , the suggestion has found much public interest @xcite .",
    "thus , both experimental and theoretical aspects of the temperature effect of the electron screening will be subject of a critical discussion clearly showing the inapplicability of the debye - hckel model for these issues .",
    "the experiments have been carried out at an accelerator optimized for low energy beams . fig .",
    "[ fig : experiment ] illustrates the principal set - up and the data acquisition system .",
    "the accelerator consists of a radio frequency ion source , an acceleration line powered by a highly stabilized @xmath8 supply and subsequent electric quadrupoles for focusing and a magnetic dipole for beam analysis .",
    "the beam impinges onto a faraday cup just inside the target chamber where beam adjustment can be done without disturbing the deuteron density in the targets .",
    "a horizontal magnetic steerer is used to deflect the beam onto the target , such removing neutral particles and contaminations carried along by the beam . a cylinder box set to a negative",
    "potential surrounds the target in order to suppress secondary electrons .",
    "the isolated target holder is connected to a current integrator .",
    "the targets were disks made from different pure metals becoming self - implanted deuterium targets under the beam irradiation .",
    "four si - detectors at the laboratory angles of 90@xmath9 , 110@xmath9 , 130@xmath9 and 150@xmath9 were used for the detection of all charged particles , p , t , @xmath1he , of the reactions @xmath0h(d , p)t and @xmath0h(d , n)@xmath1he .",
    "the detectors needed to be shielded from the backscattered deuterons in order to prevent a congestion of them and the data acquisition system . therefore grounded al - foils of thicknesses from @xmath10 were placed in front of the detectors .",
    "the thickness is sufficient to block deuterons up to @xmath11 while all other ejectiles could pass .",
    "the detector voltage pulses travel through pre - amplifiers and spectroscopic amplifiers .",
    "the signals are digitized by four adcs in an embedded vme system connected to a computer which automatically integrates the proton lines of the spectra in fixed time intervals limited by the serial line ] and records the four differential counting numbers @xmath12 and the charge @xmath13 of the integrated beam current at the target in a file which then can be further processed .",
    "an example spectrum is shown in fig  [ fig : experiment ] ; all ejectile lines are clearly identifiable . due to the anisotropic angular distribution of the ejectiles of the d+d fusion reactions",
    "even at the lowest energies , a total counting number @xmath14 is calculated providing the tabulated function @xmath15 which is the basic quantity for the further data analysis .",
    "correspondingly , the experimental reaction yield is given by @xmath16 where the number of impacting projectiles is already substituted by their charge , @xmath17 is the detector efficiency and @xmath18 the charge state of the projectile . on the other hand",
    "the yield can be calculated for an infinitely thick target ( regarding the projectile range @xmath19 ) by @xmath20 with the number density of the target nuclei @xmath3 and the cross section @xmath4 . unlike other chemical compounds",
    "the small hydrogen atoms are not trapped in firm chemical bonds with metals .",
    "the hydrogen density is not bound to a fixed stoichiometric ratio and can and indeed does change under ion irradiation .",
    "changes in the yield may now originate from both the deuteron density and the cross section and need to be discriminated .",
    "the density is here a function of the target depth , the projectile energy , the implanted charge , the beam flux and other target material dependent and environmental conditions .",
    "the tabulated function @xmath15 provided by our data acquisition system makes it possible to retain the differentiation in ( [ m : yieldexp ] ) and thereby gain information on the charge development of a depth averaged density @xmath21 . so assuming depth homogeneity of the deuteron density in ( [ m : yieldtheo ] ) the depth @xmath22 can be substituted by the projectile energy @xmath23 with the stopping power differential equation @xcite @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the stopping power coefficients in the metal and in hydrogen , @xmath27 the appendant hydrogen density . applying this substitution one arrives at a motivation and an expression for the _ reduced yield _",
    "@xcite @xmath28{0.6}{\\frac{n(q)}{c_{m}+\\frac{n(q)}{n_{d}}c_{d}}}}\\times f\\left(e\\right)\\;.\\label{m : redy}\\ ] ] since both the cross section in the metallic environment and the deuteron density are unknown the yield need to be set in relation to a known gas target cross section .",
    "we therefore chose the parameterization from @xcite because it has the highest precision .",
    "it forms together with the low energy function ( @xmath29 ) of the stopping power ( [ m : abbdgl ] ) the integral in the denominator on the right hand side .",
    "the gray printed expression is per se a constant .",
    "so if the reduced yield is not constant it is based on deviations of the prescribed progression in the cross section or in the functional dependence of the stopping powers or changes in the density .",
    "it is a sensitive measure for such deviations but the distinction of the possible reasons is a matter of reasonable interpretation .",
    "[ fig : expprocedure ] shows plots of the reduced yield at two different energies .",
    "analysis procedure at the example of zirconium at @xmath30    one can see long term changes in the individual measurements indicated by the straight lines .",
    "these are attributed to changes in the deuteron density profiles scattered by the counting statistics , of course .",
    "in contrast , the large discontinuities of the reduced yield at the switching of the beam energy result from a modification of the cross section .",
    "this is taken into account by the enhancement factor @xmath31 in ( [ m : redy ] ) . since the absolute quantity of the deuteron density is unknown for the practical analysis a normalized enhancement factor",
    "is defined @xmath32 with the normalization energy @xmath33 which is chosen to be @xmath34 for the monitor measurements .",
    "the gray rectangles indicate the points from which the experimental error for @xmath35 is inferred .",
    "thus not only errors from the counting statistics but also from long term changes of the density are included .",
    "results obtained for different projectile energies are displayed in fig .",

    "the correction becomes only important for far lower beam energies .",
    "] the factor 2 arises from the cm - lab - transformation .",
    "so @xmath38 is an enhancement factor for thick targets in analogy to the enhancement factor for thin targets from @xcite @xmath39 using the s - factor parametrization of the cross section with the sommerfeld parameter @xmath40 in the second line and applying an approximation in the third line , which demonstrates its qualitative behaviour as a roughly exponential increase for decreasing energies .",
    "the corresponding curve in fig .  [ fig : fnx ] obtained for a fitted value of @xmath36 supports the screening hypothesis .",
    "our data analysis procedure is thus independent of the absolute value of the deuteron densities inside the targets and the stopping power coefficients which otherwise would introduce errors of @xmath41 .",
    "the functional dependency of the stopping powers on the energy @xmath29 has been repeatedly confirmed , see @xcite and references therein .",

    "[ fig : expprocedure ] are density estimates for that areas .",
    "this is in brief the basic experimental procedure as of @xcite .",
    "for the study of the electron screening effect two experimental campaigns were executed . since the special physico - chemical properties of the hydrogen compounds and the beam induced chemical reactions at the target",
    "heavily influence the obtained results @xcite , the second more extensive campaign needed to investigate these interfering effects ( * ? ?",
    "4 ) which are sketched in a concise survey in the next section [ sec : expspecial ] .",
    "the investigation of nuclear reaction cross sections on deuterium in metals should be performed at the lowest possible energies .",
    "this means that the composition of the topmost atomic layers of the metallic target is of crucial importance because of the quickly decreasing range of the beam ions , considerably below @xmath43 .",
    "this exactly is unusual for experimental nuclear physics .",
    "the usual set - ups in experimental nuclear physics are constructed in high vacuum technology .",
    "but here the contained water vapour from the surfaces of all materials leads under ion impact to a progressing oxidation of the target metal because of the stronger electron negativity of oxygen in comparison to hydrogen .",
    "hence , hydrogen is contained in metal oxides only in segregation at low and unstable densities .",
    "consequently , the oxidation diminishes and eventually destroys the screening effect with the growing thickness of the metal oxide layer .",
    "carbon hydrides contained in hv systems pose another problem leading to carbon layers on the target as will be discussed below .",
    "in such a way generated alterations in the depth profile of the deuteron density distribution in the target is the singular dominating error source for the observed enhancement and the inferred screening energies .",
    "our vacuum system is made of aluminium with elastomer gaskets pumped by turbo molecular pumps with auxiliary oil lubricated two stage rotary vane pumps and ln@xmath44 cooled cryogenic traps ( * ? ? ?",
    "* fig .  1 ) .",
    "a residual gas analyzer ( rga ) was used in order to monitor the composition of the residual gas in the vacuum .",
    "this is here merely a concise presentation ; for a more extensive description see @xcite .    in accordance to the literature about hv systems the main constituent of the residual gas is water .",
    "water vapour is due to its extraordinarily high dipole moment very adhesive to solids and is hence chemisorbed to surfaces .",
    "now under the ion irradiation several processes are enabled . via heating and phonon excitation at the surface",
    "the beam provides the activation energy for dissociative chemisorption of the water molecule , i.e.  the protons are splitted off and the remaining oxygen radical forms a chemical bond to the metal atoms .",
    "essentially , the same happens by direct impact excitation of the water molecule by the ions .",
    "the hydrogen implantation into the metal causes aside from the usual surface deterioration a in depth destruction of the crystal integrity of the material known as embrittlement which always occurs if the hydrogen loading rate is too high and not proceeding in thermal equilibrium @xcite .",
    "thus , the surface is fractalized and the oxidation can progress into the bulk of the metal quickly creating a thick metal oxide layer .",
    "[ fig : emic ] contains as an example for it a picture of the surface of an al target which turned into a sponge like structure .    scanning electron microscopic pictures of target surfaces .",
    "left : symptoms of embrittlement for al .",
    "right : beginning layer formation for ta in island growth mode . ]",
    "the rate of the oxidation process depends on the concrete form of the mutual interaction potential between the water molecule and the surface atoms , establishing a material dependency .",
    "the energy supply of the beam enables these processes even for the noble metals .",
    "albeit generally spoken , more reactive metals apt more to oxidation and embrittlement while for the latter the structural difference between the metal and the metal hydride is more important . aside from the overall beam heating",
    "the energy of the projectiles is also important because lower energy projectiles are more effective at the surface @xcite .",
    "the partial pressure of water in hv is so high that there are ample supplies for the surface chemical reactions .",
    "the hit rate of water molecules with a sticking coefficient of almost one is in comparable orders of magnitude as usual beam currents of @xmath45 .",
    "this implies a dependence on the ion flux , too .",
    "there are two counteracting processes : sputtering and thermal or ion stimulated desorption .",
    "the sputtering yield of the lightweight deuterons is far too low in order to keep the surface clean with the resulting sputtering rate .",
    "one would expect that an increased temperature of the surface would increase the desorption rate of the water molecules . if the activation energy barrier for dissociative chemisorption of water is positive an increased temperature yet proliferates the oxidation .",
    "similar is valid for ion stimulated desorption / chemisorption .",
    "such again depends on the interaction potential but usually oxidation prevails . unless uhv systems equipped for entire baking are used the oxidation can not be avoided .",
    "a deuteron irradiation of only @xmath46 is enough to produce a considerable metal oxide layer , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* fig .  6 ) .",
    "there is , however , a process that is nonetheless able to prevent oxidation : large carbon hydride molecules , e.g.  backstreaming from the forepumps , can be physisorbed at the surface , cracked up and the carbon atoms can react with the oxygen radicals to carbon monoxide keeping in that way the surface clean . differently from water ,",
    "carbon hydrides are physisorbed to surfaces",
    ". the strength of this weaker bond increases with growing molecular mass .",
    "the ratio of absorption and desorption under the ion irradiation has similar dependencies .",
    "an evidence for this chemical surface reaction is the detection of a considerable co fraction by the rga which was below the detection threshold without beam irradiation ( * ? ? ?",

    "these processes were thoroughly explored by the regulated infusion of decane with monitoring feedback as the main part of the second experimental campaign .",
    "the surface can only be kept clean if the fraction of water and carbon hydrides in the residual gas are in an equilibrium which is of course also dependent on prementioned parameters .",
    "if the fraction of carbon hydrides is too low the surface will oxidize .",
    "if it is too high a carbon layer will build up .",

    "although the measurements scatter by 1 - 2% , no systematic enhancement of the decay rate can be seen for the metallic uranium . as can be seen from the aforementioned cern measurement @xcite the effect",
    "will be small anyway even for high screening values but an evidence would be a great contribution to a better understanding of the screening mechanism from a very different approach .",
    "we presented some new experimental electron screening energies for d+d reactions taking place in different target material environments .",
    "we applied a differential data analysis method which gains the maximum information from the raw data .",
    "the method is independent of the unprecise stopping power coefficients and the actual absolute value of the deuteron number density in the targets .",
    "it enables the on - line monitoring of the deuteron densities and the observation of short time deuteron density profile changes .",
    "thus , it allows for the recognition and rejection of measurements with unwanted shifts in the density depth distribution profile .",
    "therefore , it adequately considers the special situation of potentially highly mobile hydrogen in solid states where neither a homogeneous nor a stable density distribution can be presupposed any longer .",
    "the problem of the density dynamics is entangled with the effects from the actual target composition , i.e.  the undesirable density profile changes occur in targets with low hydrogen binding ability , like many of the transition metals , at elevated temperatures and heterogeneous targets with metal oxide or carbon layers or different ( relatively ) thin metal layers .",
    "the formation of metal oxide layers is inevitable in common high vacuum systems used in experimental nuclear physics while the other unpropitious environments were produced deliberately .",
    "thorough investigation of the contamination layer formation showed their momentousness and assured together with the differential analysis method that our screening energy values ranging between @xmath74 represent lower limits .",
    "in addition the alteration of the inferred screening energies due to layer formation under beam irradiation depends on many parameters . logically it makes no sense to measure larger portions of the periodic table since any observed material dependence results from differences in the chemical reactivity and related physico - chemical properties for the contamination layer formation , unless this problem is reliably solved .",
    "different to the other two groups our high screening energy results were achieved at high densities in the proximity of the chemical stoichiometric ratio clearly without evidence for short time density profile shifts . whereas the high screening results of the other groups were exclusively attained at low densities yielded from the customary analysis of the total yields of the measurements which is blind for the then happening density dynamics .",
    "the target diagnosis methods are unusable because of their too bad resolution and off - line application .",
    "so the inferred screening energies are conjecturally simulated by the density dynamics .",
    "utilization of explorative statistics to the data sets including the temperature measurements sustains this explanation while on the other hand the debye - hckel hypothesis is clearly falsified .",
    "it is likewise falsified from the theoretical side since calculations performed within an improved dielectric function theory predict only a weak material dependence of @xmath36 on the valence electron density .",
    "the quantitative scale of the phenomenon is not yet understood , since our analytical model still fails to describe the values by at least a factor of 2 .",
    "so further unidentified effects play a role . consequently any conclusion based on",
    "the alleged material dependence of the inferred screening energies is premature . for it",
    "the precise determination of the screening energies is demandable which is only feasible in an ultra high vacuum system with pressures well below @xmath75 , where only hydrogen and noble gases are in the residual gas , and equipped with in - situ target diagnosis techniques .",
    "we performed the first measurements under uhv conditions , whose results confirm the previous measurements and the framework of surface physics and chemical effects @xcite .    nuclear reactions with heavier nuclei embedded in metallic environments gave evidence for an alike enhanced screening effect .",
    "however , there are analogue problems .",
    "the results for deuterated metals with @xmath1he projectiles are contradictory , most probably due to deuteron dynamics .",
    "the data for li nuclei are partially conflicting between the tohoku and the bochum group , which used different target preparation techniques , and can be attributed to inhomogeneous densities and inadequate diagnosis techniques as well .",
    "the results , however , confirm theoretical predictions based on the dielectric function theory concerning the free electron density of the target material .",
    "the screening energy data for the heavier nuclei v and lu were obtained from a comparison between a metal and a metal oxide powder target ignoring the hollow spaces in the powder and its strong influences on beam stopping , thus disabling conclusions .",
    "as discussed , the predictions of the debye - hckel hypothesis given by the bochum group for the temperature dependence of the radioactive decay of embedded nuclei could not be verified by their own experiments ; the measured values are orders of magnitude below their predictions .",
    "moreover , their experimental results are in contradiction to all other experiments , in particular the ltno measurements of the past 30 years .",
    "a material dependence is conceivable though a small effect .",
    "otherwise it would have been already discovered given that nuclei of importance for nuclear technology have been investigated in multiple chemical compounds including pure metals for decades ."
