    "one of the most distinctive features of the supergiant cd - type galaxies found at the centers of rich environments is the very obvious presence of huge populations of old - halo globular clusters ( gcs ) , often numbering above 10,000 gcs in a single system and spanning radii upwards of 100 kpc ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "these `` high specific frequency '' ( `` high-@xmath9 '' ) globular cluster systems ( gcss ) provide a platform for statistical studies of halo cluster properties that can not be carried out in any other environment . despite their rarity",
    ", they are therefore prime targets for both observations and interpretive modelling on the formation and evolution of gcs and their host galaxies .",
    "the gcss in cd galaxies ( most of which are also `` brightest cluster galaxies '' or bcgs ) have been used to identify a new correlation between gc luminosity ( or mass ) and color ( or metallicity ) . while the cluster metallicity distribution function ( mdf ) usually has a bimodal shape ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* among many others ) , recent photometric work suggests that the more metal - poor gcs ( those in the `` blue sequence '' ) have higher heavy - element abundance at progressively higher luminosity . this _ mass - metallicity relation _",
    "( mmr ) was first discovered in eight giant bcgs by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter h06 ) and in the virgo giants m87 and ngc 4649 @xcite .",
    "the same trend can be seen for the gcs around the giant sa galaxy ngc 4594 @xcite , and @xcite find evidence for a similar mmr in their extensive sample of virgo cluster survey galaxies by combining their gc data into groups by host galaxy luminosity . as h06 discuss ,",
    "a clear trace of this trend had already been found for the fornax cd ngc 1399 by @xcite and @xcite , who noted that the bright end of the gc population appeared broadly unimodal rather than bimodal . as we now realize , this effect comes about essentially because the blue and red sequences merge at the top end .",
    "intriguingly , the more metal - rich `` red '' sequence is not seen to exhibit a mmr of its own in any galaxy so far .",
    "that is , for the more metal - rich gcs , metallicity is independent of mass .",
    "the basic interpretation proposed by h06 is that the blue - sequence clusters formed primarily in dwarf - sized pregalactic clouds while the first stage of hierarchical merging was beginning . in these sites ,",
    "more self - enrichment could occur within the more massive dwarfs where more of the enriched gas from supernova ejecta could be held back .",
    "these same higher - mass dwarfs would also , on average , produce the most massive gcs @xcite . by contrast , the more metal - rich gcs on the red sequence formed later , perhaps in major mergers , and at a stage when all the material could be held in the much deeper potential well of the final big galaxy . in that stage",
    ", enrichment would have been more independent of gc mass .",
    "@xcite discuss a similar view .",
    "@xcite use semi - analytic galaxy formation models to test a different approach , namely the contribution of stripped dwarf nuclei to the mmr .",
    "they find that a mmr along the blue sequence appears naturally with a standard model prescription for star formation and enrichment rates in semi - analytic models",
    ". an integral part of their interpretation is that many of the massive blue gcs are actually the dense nuclei of stripped dwarfs ( de , n or ucd objects ) .",
    "still more intriguingly , at least one clear anomaly is already known to exist : although the mmr along the blue sequence has now been found unequivocally in many galaxies , it does not seem to occur in the well studied virgo giant ngc 4472 , where both the red and blue gc sequences run vertically .",
    "this result has been confirmed in several studies and in a variety of photometric bandpasses @xcite .",
    "@xcite find that increasing the efficiency of supernova feedback for heating in dwarfs can produce this effect , leaving the blue gc sequence without a mmr .",
    "but it is not yet clear what underlying physical or environmental conditions would cause this to occur . in short , the existence of the mmr is beginning to provide rich new insights into the early formation era of large galaxies .",
    "ngc 3311 , the central cd galaxy in the hydra cluster a1060 , has long been an attractive target for gcs studies because it is relatively nearby ( @xmath10 mpc for a hydra redshift @xmath11 km s@xmath12 and @xmath13 km s@xmath12 mpc@xmath12 ) and has an enormously populous gcs comparable with the largest known , such as m87 in virgo or ngc 4874 in coma . its ranking among the high-@xmath9 systems was established with the early photometric survey by @xcite .",
    "further ground - based imaging in the washington system @xcite indicated that its gcs was moderately metal - rich with a hint of bimodality , and that its spatial distribution was similar to the shape of the cd envelope light .",
    "hubble space telescope imaging with the wfpc2 camera @xcite in the frequently used @xmath14 color index was employed to argue that the mdf for its clusters was more like the `` standard '' pattern in giant ellipticals  that is , a probable bimodal structure with metal - poor and metal - rich sequences at their usual mean metallicities .",
    "the most recently published study @xcite combined the _",
    "wfpc2 _ @xmath15 data with _",
    "nicmos _ imaging in f160w ( approximately the @xmath16band ) to gain a first rough estimate of the metallicity and age distributions through models in the @xmath17 two - color diagram .",
    "none of these earlier studies have given a satisfactory picture of the system .",
    "the hst - based studies @xcite are hampered by the small fields of view of wfpc2 and nicmos , yielding very incomplete spatial coverage of this big cd galaxy , and thus relatively small gc samples to work with .",
    "by contrast , the initial study of @xcite in the pre - ccd photographic era covered a wide field but penetrated to only quite shallow photometric limits by today s standards .",
    "relatively shallow limits and photometric calibration problems also affected the first ccd - based imaging @xcite . to study this",
    "unusually attractive gcs further , we need to draw from a new photometric study that combines depth with wide field .",
    "as part of a new program ( gemini gs-2006a - q-24 ) intended to obtain deep multicolor imaging of globular cluster systems around cd galaxies , we obtained ( @xmath18 ) images of ngc  3311 and the central hydra cluster field using the gmos imager on gemini south , which has a @xmath19 field of view ( fov ) and a scale of 0.146@xmath20 after @xmath21 binning .",
    "the raw observations were taken on the nights of 2006 february 8 and march 23 , under dark skies and photometric conditions , with an average seeing of @xmath22 . in each waveband , 13 individual exposures were taken , which we then reregistered and median - combined to create the final , deep images in ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "the total integration time in each filter was 3900s .",
    "the preprocessing of the raw exposures was completed with the gemini package in iraf . in the @xmath24 frames ,",
    "a small amount of night - sky fringing was present , which we successfully removed with a calibration fringe frame from the gemini archives .",
    "after subtracting the fringe frame and then median combining all 13 @xmath24-band frames , the resulting fringe signal contributes only 0.3 percent to the background fluctuations .",
    "for the photometric calibration , we used exposures of landolt standard stars @xcite taken adjacent to our program - field images during photometric conditions .",
    "we transformed the landolt standard - star indices in @xmath25 to ( @xmath18 ) using the conversion equations of @xcite .",
    "since our standard star exposures covered only a small range in airmass , we used the ngc 3311 images taken within just the same airmass range , and taken during the same night within one hour of the standard - star exposures .",
    "this calibration was suitable only for establishing a mean zero - point value for our ngc 3311 frames , and not for a more complete evaluation of the coefficients in airmass or color .",
    "we therefore regard the calibration as only a preliminary one , to be refined when a larger network of standards can be obtained .",

    "we used an extensive series of artificial - star tests with the _ addstar _ component of _ daophot _ to evaluate the internal photometric detection completeness as a function of magnitude : stars were added to each the @xmath39 and @xmath24 images in groups of 500 over a wide range of magnitudes , the images were then remeasured in the same way as the original frames , and the fraction @xmath40 of stars recovered in each magnitude bin was then determined .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ completeness ] .",
    "the limits of our data , defined as the magnitudes at which @xmath40 drops to 0.5 , are @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "the trend of @xmath40 with magnitude is well matched by a pritchet interpolation function @xcite , @xmath43.\\ ] ] which has two free parameters : the limiting magnitude @xmath44 , and a parameter @xmath27 giving the steepness of the dropoff .",
    "for these images we find @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "as will be seen below , the limiting magnitudes @xmath47 and @xmath48 are deep enough to be comparable with the gc luminosity function turnover point of ngc 3311 . within the bright bulge of ngc 3311 , the photometry depth diminishes due to the increased local sky noise at small radii .",
    "however , for radii larger than @xmath49 from ngc 3311 , which include the vast majority of our data , we find no change in the completeness limits @xmath50 .",
    "the random uncertainties of the photometry , as determined from _ daophot / allstar _ and from the same artificial - star tests , are well approximated by the interpolation curves @xmath51 they show little variation from place to place within the gmos field , indicating that crowding is unimportant , and that background light from ngc 3311 and ngc 3309 has little influence except near their very centers .",
    "on the basis of these error curves , we would expect the gc sequences to start being noticeably ` broadened ' in color , purely because of random uncertainties in the photometry , for levels @xmath52 .",
    "lastly , the artificial - star tests show that any _ systematic _ error ( net bias ) in the photometry is less than 0.02 mag in each filter for @xmath53 .    throughout the following discussion",
    "we adopt a distance modulus @xmath54 for ngc 3311 and foreground reddening @xmath55 , as we did in @xcite .",
    "after carrying out the photometry in @xmath39 and @xmath24 with _ daophot _ we used the additional code sextractor @xcite to help reject obvious nonstellar objects from the detection lists ( at @xmath56 seeing and at the distance of the hydra cluster , globular clusters appear indistinguishable from the starlike psf . under hst - type resolution of @xmath57 ,",
    "the profiles of the very biggest gcs can , however , be resolved ; see wehner & harris 2007 ) .",
    "detections from the two wavebands were then correlated , and only those objects found in both were kept for the final analysis .",
    "the final color - magnitude measurements for 8108 starlike objects across the entire gmos field are shown in figure [ cmd ] .",
    "the globular cluster population is readily visible as the dominant concentration of points in the color range @xmath58 .",
    "fainter than @xmath59 the field contamination and photometric scatter increase markedly , but brighter than this , the gc population is well defined .",
    "evidence of the standard `` blue '' and `` red '' sequences can already be seen and will be discussed more quantitatively below through objective bimodal fits .",
    "on the red - sequence side ( approximately in the range @xmath60 ) a distinctive bright extension to high luminosity can be seen that , intriguingly , does not exist for the blue gc sequence .",
    "this bright - end feature extends up into the gc mass range @xmath61 that overlaps with the regime of the `` ultra - compact dwarfs '' ( ucds ) .",
    "we have discussed these objects in our previous paper @xcite .    to date , not much other photometry of globular cluster systems in the @xmath62 indices has been published that we can make comparisons with . @xcite present @xmath63 data taken with the gmos camera on gemini north for the virgo giant ngc 4649 .",
    "the bimodal fit they obtain to its gc color distribution has mean values @xmath64 for the blue and red sequences which are @xmath65 mag _ redder _ than our calibrated and dereddened colors for ngc 3311 .",
    "we would expect _ a priori _ , however , that the colors of the two sequences would be quite similar from one galaxy to the next ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with only a modest trend due to the parent galaxy luminosity .",
    "for the present , we do not regard this difference as significant , because ( as emphasized above ) we regard our zeropoint calibration as a preliminary one , which still needs a separate series of observations especially to establish the photometric color terms .",
    "notably , forbes et al . also regard their own zeropoint calibration as preliminary .",
    "what is perhaps more important at this stage , and equally worth noting , is that the mean color _ difference _",
    "@xmath66 between the red and blue sequences that we find for ngc 3311 ( see the discussion below ) is identical with the separation btween those two sequences measured for ngc 4649 by @xcite .",
    "in sections 4.1  4.2 we use our gmos data to discuss the spatial distribution of the gcs around both ngc 3311 and 3309 , including the radial and azimuthal components .",
    "a continuing theme in this analysis is the relative contribution of the two galaxies to the gc population we see on our images . in section 4.3 , we discuss the color ( metallicity ) distribution of the gcs by radius around ngc 3311 , and in sections 4.4  4.5 we discuss the gc luminosity function and specific frequencies .",
    "the core of the hydra cluster contains several other large galaxies in addition to the central supergiant that was our primary target . of these others",
    ", the closest in projection and by far the most luminous is the giant elliptical ngc 3309 , just @xmath6 away from the center of ngc 3311 .",
    "its integrated magnitude ( @xmath67 ; see below ) places it 0.9 magnitude fainter than ngc 3311 ( @xmath68 ) , though the true total luminosity of ngc 3311 is estimated to be about 1.3 mag brighter than that of ngc 3309 because of its extended cd envelope .",
    "nevertheless , we might expect that ngc 3309 would contribute significant numbers of gcs of its own to the population of objects in the field . by using starcounts around each of the two galaxies on the sides opposite to the other galaxy , @xcite and",
    "@xcite both argued that ngc 3309 was likely to be contributing no more than a few percent of the gcs in the hydra core field , with ngc 3311 acting as the dominant contributor .",
    "even though ngc 3311 is clearly a high-@xmath9 elliptical like many cds , such claims might mean that ngc 3309 would have unusually low @xmath9 for a giant elliptical in a rich cluster . a better and more quantitative estimate of the relative populations , as well as the spatial structures of the two gcss , is possible from our deeper data .",
    "to quantify our analysis , let us assume that the projected number density of gcs on the sky from each of the two galaxies can be modelled by a circularly symmetric function @xmath69 giving the number of gcs per unit projected area ( we justify the assumption of symmetry below ) .",
    "then , the total number density of counted objects at a point @xmath70 anywhere in the field is given by @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the distance of the given point @xmath70 from the center of ngc 3311 , @xmath73 is its distance from the center of ngc 3309 , and @xmath74 are the two radial functions specifying the gcs around each galaxy .",
    "finally , @xmath75 is the uniform background density of whatever contaminating objects fall within our selected sample .",
    "our goal is to deduce , from a fit to the observed gc distribution in the field , the best - estimate parameters for @xmath76 and @xmath77 _",
    "simultaneously_.    to perform the fit , we adopt two possible models for the distribution :    \\(a ) a standard hubble profile , @xmath78 which is a power law with an added core profile of core radius @xmath79 .",
    "\\(b ) a generalized sersic profile , @xmath80\\ ] ] where @xmath81 @xcite to guarantee that @xmath82 will be the half - light radius , and for typical e galaxies , the exponent @xmath83 is found observationally to fall in the range @xmath84 .",
    "the case @xmath85 recovers the standard de vaucouleurs law .    to carry out the actual numerical fit , we divide up the observed area into @xmath86 boxes , each of area @xmath87",
    "; we use the model parameters to predict how many objects @xmath88 should be found in each box at position @xmath89 ; and then calculate the residuals ( observed @xmath90 predicted ) in each box . a standard goodness of fit based on poisson statistics",
    "can then be formed , @xmath91 the outline of the model is shown in figure [ grid ] for the @xmath92 grid that we used for the final reductions .",
    "an advantage of this procedure is that it uses the information everywhere in the frame , not just the counts within some arbitrary radius centered on ngc 3311 . in practice , we ignored any boxes located at the centers of the two galaxies and at one very bright foreground star , as well as the boxes under the shadow of the camera guide probe ( lower right part of fig .  [ grid ] ) and at the vignetted corners of the field . to reduce field contamination from the outset",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ cmd ] ) , we used the sample of 4393 objects within the restricted range @xmath93 , expecting that this sample would be dominated by gcs .",
    "when we fit eq .",
    "[ fiteqn ] to the data , in principle we have a total of six free parameters . for the hubble profile model ,",
    "these six are @xmath94 , and the relative amplitude @xmath95 . for the sersic model , they are @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "once a particular ratio @xmath95 is chosen , the actual values of both @xmath98 and @xmath99 individually are automatically set by the condition that the _ total _ predicted population of objects in the field must precisely equal the observed total .",
    "the same applies to @xmath100 and @xmath101 for the sersic model .    in practice ,",
    "the background density @xmath75 is extremely hard to determine by the fitting procedure alone , because the ngc 3311 gcs is so extensive that it dominates the starcounts even near the edges of our gmos field .",
    "an external constraint on @xmath75 is therefore desirable . lacking any remote `` control field '' to rely on",
    ", we use the distribution of stars in the cmd itself ( fig .",
    "[ cmd ] ) to estimate the background .",
    "the background contamination will be due to a combination of foreground milky way stars and faint , small remote galaxies .",
    "we can estimate the number and color distribution of possible field stars using the galactic stellar population synthesis models of @xcite . using a @xmath19 field centered on ngc 3311 ,",
    "the models find only 13 stars , suggesting contamination from galactic foreground stars is small at these latitudes .",
    "using a larger field of view , such as a square degree , results in over 2 thousand stars with a color distribution leaning blueward of the blue peak of the gcs distribution .",
    "our main source of contamination , as indicated by the initial fov search , is most likely distant background galaxies . without a control field",
    ", we can not specifically quantify these background galaxies .",
    "if we assume that their distribution of colors is roughly uniform over the interval @xmath102 , we can use the numbers of objects with colors in the ranges @xmath103 and @xmath104 to predict how many background objects are in our selected midrange of @xmath105 .",
    "for @xmath106 we count 860 objects total that are bluer or redder than the gc color range .",
    "normalizing to the same color interval , we then estimate that 570 of the 4393 objects within @xmath105 ( or about 13% ) are background contamination , equivalent to @xmath107 arcmin@xmath108 . in the numerical fitting procedure we adopted this background throughout and treated only the 5 remaining parameters in each model as free .    for the hubble profile model ,",
    "we obtain a best - fit set of parameters @xmath109 and @xmath110 for ngc 3311 ; and @xmath111 and @xmath112 for ngc 3309 .",
    "the ratio @xmath113 is @xmath114 . for this set of parameters",
    "the minimum reduced @xmath115 value was 1.44 .",
    "we experimented with different grid sizes and found that the results were not sensitive within broad limits to the fineness @xmath116 of the chosen grid .",
    "given the simple nature of the model , and other factors not accounted for such as the necessarily patchy sampling across the grid , the internally uncertain adopted level of the background , and possible clumpiness ( clustering ) in the background population , the fit is successful at accomplishing our main goal to evaluate the relative contributions of the two giant galaxies .",
    "a very slightly better overall fit ( minimum @xmath117 ) is obtained with the generalized sersic model . for the ngc 3311 gcs",
    ", we find @xmath118 and @xmath119 , while for ngc 3309 @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "the ratio of the two amplitudes is @xmath122 .    for comparison , the scale sizes of the underlying halo _ light _ of each galaxy",
    "are significantly smaller : @xcite find @xmath123 kpc for ngc 3309 and @xmath124 25 kpc for ngc 3311 from an integrated - light study in the gunn @xmath125 filter .",
    "these effective radii are not strictly comparable to our solutions for the gcss , because they assume a classic de vaucouleurs profile ( @xmath85 in the sersic model ) ; but they confirm that the gcs is spatially more extended , as has usually been found for giant galaxies @xcite .",
    "one very evident result of this numerical exercise is that ngc 3309 contributes only a minor part of the gc population in our field ( 2 to 3 percent ; see section 4.5 below ) . as a consequence ,",
    "its gcs shape parameters are quite weakly constrained . assuming that the detected objects in the field belong _",
    "entirely _ to ngc 3311 and ignoring ngc 3309 completely ( that is , setting @xmath126 in the numerical fitting ) yields a minimum @xmath127 negligibly worse than the two - galaxy fit .",
    "we quantify the relative importance of the two galaxies a bit further below .",
    "a rough comparison of the two model fits is shown in figure [ radial ] , where we simply plot the number density of objects in each grid box as a function of distance from the center of ngc 3311 .",
    "the best - fit hubble and sersic models _ for ngc 3311 alone _ are shown overplotted , verifying the first - order description of the entire population in the field as belonging to the central cd . the same grid plot , but this time centered on ngc 3309 , gives a radically different impression , similar to picking just a random point somewhere away from ngc 3311 .",
    "that is , no significant concentration towards ngc 3309 is evident",
    ".    a significant improvement in this estimate of the two gcs spatial structures will be possible if a better external measurement of the background can be obtained .",
    "the ngc 3311 system is so extensive , however , that photometry at projected radii @xmath128 ( 150 kpc ) will be necessary for a control - field location .",
    "@xcite also attempted to measure the ellipticity of the ngc 3311 gcs and to compare it with the shape of its cd envelope .",
    "we can , in principle , make a better test with our much larger measured population . in this case",
    ", for our test sample we take all 3544 measured objects within radii @xmath129 of ngc 3311 ( the outer circle is the largest complete one fitting within the gmos frame boundary ) and within the photometric limits @xmath93 .",
    "this sample is subdivided into @xmath130 sectors and plotted against azimuthal angle @xmath131 of the sector , as shown in figure [ azimuth ] .",
    "the two sectors containing the center of ngc 3309 and the guide probe shadow are shown as open symbols in fig .",
    "[ azimuth ] and are ignored .",
    "it is evident that there is no strong trace of ellipticity in the residuals about the mean level of @xmath132 objects per sector after background subtraction .",
    "although there are sector - to - sector differences larger than the internal statistical uncertainties , they can not easily be made to match an approximate double - cosine curve that would be the mark of a modestly elliptical distribution @xcite .",
    "the integrated halo light of ngc 3311 has a small but definite ellipticity of @xmath133 and major axis at @xmath134 @xcite .",
    "if the formation of the gcs is closely associated with the galaxy halo , we should expect no large differences in their intrinsic shapes and orientations .",
    "contrarily , a dramatic difference in the gcs shape or orientation relative to the halo light would be a signal of a more fundamental difference in the gcs formation era or its internal dynamical evolution .",
    "we have carried out a solution for @xmath135 and @xmath136 with our gcs data , using the formalism of @xcite .",
    "they show that for an intrinsically elliptical distribution of points sampled in _",

    ", we have @xmath140 ( for the hubble profile fit described above , we found @xmath141 , but if we remove the core - radius parameter @xmath79 , we require a flatter overall power law to match the whole profile adequately ) .",
    "we then vary the assumed @xmath135 and @xmath136 till the residuals about this model are minimized .",
    "the best - fit solution we find is for @xmath142 and @xmath143 , shown as the solid curve in fig .",
    "[ azimuth ] .",
    "the corresponding major axis line is thus @xmath144 .",
    "( in fig .  [ grid ] , the major axis would run vertically . )",
    "the best - fit solution is weakly determined with a shallow minimum at @xmath145 , and indeed solutions with @xmath146 are scarcely worse than this one .",
    "our deduced ellipticity is lower than for the integrated light , and our solution for @xmath136 falls @xmath147 eastward of the integrated halo light , though its uncertainty is large enough that there is no formal disagreement . in short ,",
    "we appear to be confronted with no difficulties by assuming first - order circular symmetry .    for comparison , we show one of the solutions by @xcite as the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ azimuth ] ; this clearly does not match our solution very well .",
    "@xcite performed solutions for two different magnitude ranges ( @xmath148 , @xmath149 ) and for the more slightly more restricted radial range @xmath150 . for @xmath148 , they found @xmath151 , @xmath152 , while for @xmath149 they found @xmath153 , @xmath154 ( this latter one is shown in our fig .",
    "[ azimuth ] ) .",
    "they comment that `` the uncertainty in @xmath136 is at least @xmath155 '' .    both of the mclaughlin et al .",
    "solutions differ from ours ; we find a distinctly smaller ellipticity and a position angle between their two solutions ( although , again , it is not clear that any genuine formal disagreement exists ) . to attempt to trace down causes for the evident differences",
    ", we rebinned our data to magnitude ranges corresponding more closely to theirs , and also restricted to exactly the same radial range as they used . for these numerical trials",
    "we also included objects at all colors , as they did .",

    "( @xmath164 , @xmath165 ) .",
    "unfortunately , we are not yet in a position to place heavy significance on this , simply because the solution for the best - fit position angle is extremely uncertain if the ellipticity is very small .",
    "if the difference is verified with deeper and cleaner samples , it will , perhaps , be a tantalizing hint that the gc accretion or destruction histories differed in second - order ways from the field stars .      with the knowledge that the vast majority of gcs in this field belong to ngc 3311",
    ", we can also investigate their color distribution as a function of galactocentric distance .",
    "in many gcss within large ellipticals , a color gradient can be found in the sense that the mean color of the gcs ( averaging together both the red and blue ones ) conventionally decreases with increasing @xmath166 .",
    "however , beginning especially with the key work of @xcite on ngc 4472 , it became clear that ( in geisler et al.s concise wording ) `` most of this gradient appears to be due to the varying radial concentrations of the two populations '' . that is , the metal - poor , blue gc population is less centrally concentrated than the metal - richer population and thus contributes a higher proportion of clusters at larger radius , generating an overall declining metallicity gradient in the gc population as a whole .",
    "notably , each of the two metallicity components shows little or no color ( metallicity ) gradient of its own .",
    "very much the same conclusion had already become clear long ago ( albeit with a much smaller sample of gcs than can be found in giant ellipticals ) for the milky way gcs @xcite .    in figure [ radcolor ]",
    "we show the color indices for the objects in the ngc 3311 field ( in order to minimize field contamination , we restrict the sample to the 1360 objects brighter than @xmath167 ) .",
    "a broad range in color is present at all radii , but no strong radial gradient in color is evident for either the red or blue subpopulations , a similar result to other galaxies . in order to determine whether there was a trend in color versus radius , we binned the clusters in radius and performed a fit using rmix ( a fitting code discussed in detail in section 6 ) .",
    "the locations of the red and blue peaks are shown as diamonds in figure [ radcolor ] .",
    "a comparison between the cumulative distributions of the red and blue clusters ( shown in the lower panel of the figure ) indicates that any difference has weak significance , at least within the regions our data are sampling .",

    "deep imaging from galaxies of all types now shows that the luminosity distribution of their gcs follows a roughly universal shape that has most often been approximated by a gaussian distribution in number of gcs per unit magnitude ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "ideally , a determination of the gclf for our target ngc 3311 would best be done by taking the lf of an adjacent `` control field '' , observed under identical conditions , and subtracting it from the lf of the objects in our @xmath172wide central field . lacking this ,",
    "a second - best alternative is to use the outer parts of our gmos field as a `` background '' .",
    "in fact , much of the outer zone is still populated by gcs , and so by defining it as background we will partially subtract some of the gc population as well as the true background . however , as long as no large changes in the gclf with radius exist , the residual gclf we obtain this way will be systematically correct even if a bit oversubtracted .",
    "an inevitable limitation of using the outer parts of the image field to define the background level is that the background estimate @xmath75 is much more uncertain numerically than if we had a large , remote control field to work with .",
    "we divide our field into two regions : an inner annulus of inner radius @xmath173 , outer radius @xmath72 , and area @xmath174 ; and an outer zone of inner radius @xmath72 and outer boundary set by the edge of the frame , and area @xmath175 .",

    "the only significant free parameter we have to define these two zones is the mid - radius @xmath72 .",
    "the residual gc population within @xmath174 after background subtraction will clearly be @xmath177 where , by hypothesis , the background @xmath75 is constant across the field and subtracts cleanly out after the area normalization .",

    "but if @xmath72 is too small , then so is @xmath181 , and again the relative uncertainty in the residual population becomes large .",

    "the inner radius @xmath173 is set at @xmath182 .",
    "we then calculated the resulting relative uncertainty @xmath178 as a function of @xmath72 , where we let @xmath72 vary from just slightly larger than @xmath173 out to almost the borders of the field .",
    "the optimum @xmath72 turns out to be roughly halfway from the center of ngc 3311 to the edge of the field , given the geometry of this system , but the relative uncertainty goes through a very shallow minimum near this point and the precise choice is not critical . for the following discussion ,",

    "a gaussian curve with that peak magnitude and with @xmath196 mag is shown superimposed on the observed gclf in fig .",

    "our photometry does not reach far enough past the turnover to permit any kind of useful test of more sophisticated numerical models , such as the asymmetric schechter - like function explored in depth by @xcite from the virgo cluster survey .",
    "however , in a broader sense our data clearly show that imaging with ground - based 8m - class telescopes is capable of penetrating deep into the globular cluster populations of galaxies in the 50-mpc distance range and even beyond .",
    "recent interest has followed the possibility that the gclfs may differ between the redder and bluer metallicity groups of clusters . if the underlying",
    "_ mass _ distributions of both types of clusters are similar , then the gclf turnover magnitude should differ between photometric bandpasses by typically @xmath197 mag purely because of differential bolometric correction @xcite",

    "they conclude that it is unclear whether any true underlying mass differences are required to explain this mean difference .",
    "ngc 3311 has large numbers of both red and blue clusters , and using the same numerical technique as described above , we determined their gclfs separately .",

    "the results are shown in figure [ gclf_color ] , where we display only the residual lfs and not the raw numbers before background subtraction .",
    "the blue population falls close to the same roughly - gaussian curve describing the system as a whole . for the red population ,",
    "the small excess of very luminous clusters @xmath201 is evident , but the most striking difference is in the range @xmath202 , where a noticeable dip is seen just around the nominal turnover point .",
    "we are , however , reluctant to conclude that this effect is real given the uncertainties in the background correction and the determination of residuals . a standard kolmogorov - smirnov two - sample test shows that the two lfs differ over the range @xmath203 at more than 99% confidence , but the strongest statement we feel is justified from the present data",
    "is that the bright - end slope for the red clusters is somewhat flatter than for the blue ones .",
    "a better control field , and perhaps even better selection of gcs versus field contamination , will be needed to carry this discussion any further .      finally , we use the radial distributions we have derived for ngc 3311 and ngc 3309 to estimate the total cluster populations around each one , and thus their specific frequencies .",
    "we use the best - fit sersic profile parameters given above , and integrate them outward to large enough radius @xmath204 that the gc population totals converge . for ngc 3309 , the particular choice of @xmath204 is quite unimportant , since its profile is steep and negligible numbers of gcs are added for @xmath205 . however , the much more extended profile for ngc 3311 requires us to integrate outward to @xmath206 or about 140 kpc , beyond which the sersic model profile adds negligible numbers of gcs .",
    "this large radius is , however , quite consistent with the existing surface photometry @xcite which shows that ngc 3311 extends detectably to @xmath207 kpc . with these parameters in mind ,",
    "we find total gc populations brighter than @xmath208 equal to @xmath209 and @xmath210 .",
    "evaluating the actual population totals requires correcting for the magnitude limit and the fraction of gcs fainter than that limit . assuming a gaussian - like gclf",

    "this part of the gclf includes a fraction @xmath215 of the total population .",
    "we therefore estimate the total gc population for ngc 3311 as @xmath216 , where the main uncertainty is the necessary extrapolation to large radius .    for ngc 3309 we find @xmath217 ; here , the relatively large internal error is dominated instead by the large uncertainty in the ratio @xmath122 for the two - function fit described above . in this case",
    "our calculation may be a slight underestimate , not because of what may be present at larger radius , but because of the uncertain _ inward _ extrapolation into the central @xmath218 .",
    "its gcs core radius is both smaller and considerably more uncertain ( by a factor of two ; see above ) , and our profile integration may not have accounted for a significant part of the total .",

    "it should be noted , however , that these total magnitudes are extrapolations to large radius of the @xmath224 profiles that were found to fit the inner regions , and for ngc 3311 at least a part of the excess cd envelope light would be missed .",

    "however , it is not clear that the luminosity should be increased without also making a similar adjustment to the total cluster population , since we might have missed some of the gcs by using only the extrapolation from the inner profile . for the present time , and pending a more quantitative measurement of the cd envelope light , we use @xmath228 , while @xmath229 should be considered an extreme lower limit .    by contrast , ngc 3309 has a remarkably low deduced cluster population , even with the uncertainties about the core population .",

    "all studies to date agree , however , that a mmr exists for the blue clusters brighter than about @xmath286 , and that this seems to be a nearly universal phenomenon .    comparing our mmr for ngc 3311 with those found",
    "previously for other large galaxies requires transformations between photometric systems , since h06 used @xmath287 , whereas @xcite and @xcite used @xmath288 .",
    "ideally , we would like to convert @xmath63 to either one of these other indices , but transformations based directly on observations of standard globular clusters ( the milky way clusters , for example ) do not yet exist . for the purposes of a preliminary comparison , we choose instead to transform the observed blue - sequence slope @xmath289 into a metallicity scale @xmath290[fe / h ] through the use of models .",
    "representative calculations of integrated colors for ssp systems are given by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "for the range with [ m / h ] @xmath291 , these two sets of models agree well with each other and give @xmath292 } = 0.18 \\pm 0.03 $ ] for the metallicity regime we are concerned with , i.e.  [ m / h ] @xmath293 .",
    "then , converting color index to metallicity , and magnitude to luminosity and hence mass , we find that the mmr for the blue sequence in ngc 3311 corresponds to a heavy - element abundance scaling with cluster mass @xmath294 . as we did in @xcite",
    ", we assume that @xmath295 does not change systematically with luminosity in order to convert @xmath296 to @xmath297 and thus derive the scaling . by comparison",
    ", h06 found a mean scaling @xmath298 for their sample of eight giant galaxies .",
    "@xcite found @xmath299 for their virgo galaxy sample .",
    "our results for ngc 3311 are entirely consistent with the other studies within measurement uncertainties .    as an additional check of the @xmath63 analysis",
    ", we perform the same kinds of bimodal gaussian fits to the wfpc2 data in @xmath14 . here",
    ", the smaller size of the @xmath14 sample , and its lower sensitivity to metallicity , prevent us from tracing out mean color trends with magnitude with any confidence , so we use a color histogram defined from only a single magnitude range @xmath300 over which the field contamination and photometric scatter are minimized .",
    "as before , we exclude the region within @xmath252 of ngc 3309 .    the histogram of 1730 such objects is shown in figure [ wfpc2_hist ] .",
    "we ran rmix under similar assumptions as described above ( two gaussians , with means , dispersions , and proportions determined by the fit ) .",
    "for the blue , metal - poor component we find @xmath301 , @xmath302 , and proportion of the total population @xmath303 .",
    "for the red , metal - rich component , @xmath304 , @xmath305 , and @xmath306 , with an overall @xmath307 .",
    "the relative proportions of the two components are quite uncertain  again , a direct result of the insensitivity of @xmath308 to metallicity and thus the heavy overlap between the two components  but agree nominally with the near - equal proportions we found from the @xmath63 solutions ( fig .  [ mdf_4panel ] ) . for comparison purposes",
    ", we also tried a fit of a single gaussian curve to the entire data : this yielded a best - fitting mean @xmath309 and dispersion @xmath310 , with goodness - of - fit @xmath311 .",
    "the bimodal fit performs better at matching the data .    although @xmath14 is less sensitive to metallicity , it has the advantage over the sdss indices that its conversion to [ fe / h ] is more well determined . with @xmath312",
    ", we have @xmath313 and @xmath314 . adopting a conversion @xmath315 [ fe / h ]",
    "@xmath316 @xcite based on calibration from the milky way and m31 clusters then gives [ fe / h ] @xmath317 for the blue sequence and @xmath318 for the red sequence .",
    "these mean metallicities should be taken only as rough estimates , since the red - sequence mode in particular requires an extension of the conversion equations into a high - metallicity regime that the calibrating gcs in m31 and the milky way do not adequately cover .",
    "however , the mean @xmath319 values themselves are close to what would be predicted from the established correlations with host galaxy luminosity @xcite , namely @xmath320 for @xmath321 these relations predict @xmath322 and 1.19 for the blue and red modes respectively , in good agreement with our observed mean colors .",
    "supergiant ellipticals such as this one are the most logical places to search for gcs of super - solar metallicity , although higher quality spectra than currently exist will be required to establish their abundances accurately .",
    "we have presented an extensive new photometric study of the large globular cluster system around ngc 3311 , the central cd galaxy in the hydra cluster .",
    "the relatively wide field and deep limiting magnitude of our data from the gemini / gmos camera has allowed us to analyze the gcs with a sample of several thousand globular clusters ; our data reach to @xmath323 , just beyond the turnover point of the gc luminosity function . among our findings are these :    * the classic metal - poor blue gc sequence and the metal - richer red sequence are both present at their expected colors , and with nearly equal populations .",
    "we show the color distributions both from our gmos @xmath63 photometry and from hst wfpc2 archival data in @xmath14 .",
    "* bimodal fits to the complete color distribution , subdivided by magnitude , confirm that the blue sequence has the same correlation of progressively increasing metallicity with gc mass that was previously found in many other large galaxies ; the correlation we find corresponds to a scaling of gc metallicity with mass of @xmath4 .",
    "* by contrast , the red sequence shows no change of mean metallicity with mass , though it does extend upward to much higher than normal luminosity into the ucd - like range , strengthening the potential connections between massive gcs and ucds . * confirming previous but much more preliminary investigations , we find that the gcs in ngc 3311 falls definitively into the `` high specific frequency '' category inhabited almost uniquely by supergiant ellipticals ( cd s or bcg s ) at the centers of rich clusters .",
    "ngc 3311 has an estimated total population of about 16,000 clusters and a specific frequency @xmath228 .",
    "* at the core of the hydra cluster , another giant elliptical ngc 3309 is sitting projected just @xmath6 from the cd ngc 3311 .",
    "we use our database to solve simultaneously for the spatial structure and total gc populations of both galaxies at once .",
    "the results show that ngc 3309 contributes only a few percent of the gc population over the entire field , and has an unusually ( though not unprecedentedly ) low value @xmath8 .",
    "the central cd is completely dominant in the central hydra region . *",
    "the gc luminosity function , which we measure down to the `` turnover '' point at @xmath5 , also has a normal structure relative to other giant ellipticals .",
    "additional observations that could make clear improvements to the understanding of the ngc 3311 system would include imaging with a still wider field ( to establish a true `` control '' field for background measurement ) , and multicolor photometry with still more sensitive color indices to improve the definition of the metallicity distribution function .",
    "the resources held by this enormous and fascinating gc system are far from being exhausted .",
    "the authors would like to thank the anonymous referee for their helpful comments in improving this paper .",
