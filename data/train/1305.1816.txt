    "furthermore , synchronization with driving was considered by zhirov and shepelyansky , who discussed the effect of a driven resonator in the cases of both one @xcite and two superconducting qubits @xcite .",
    "these works explore the phenomena of forced synchronization , usually referred to as entrainment , in the quantum regime where the system synchronizes with the external driver instead of following its natural frequency .",
    "the presence of driving out of equilibrium does also favor quantum effects @xcite .    on the other hand , _ spontaneous _ or mutual synchronization between detuned coupled systems is the coherent dynamic phenomenon of rhythm adjustment without any external driver taming the evolution .",
    "the emergence of spontaneous quantum synchronization has been recently considered for dissipative harmonic oscillators with two major breakthroughs : ( i ) the possibility to have synchronization induced by dissipation in a linear system and ( ii ) the full quantumness of this phenomenon ( reported for vacuum fluctuations ) @xcite .",
    "synchronous dynamics has been reported during the relaxation process , in spite of the diversity of the natural frequencies of a pair of oscillators @xcite , due to the occurrence of a slowly decaying mode responsible for synchronization accompanied by robust and asymptotic quantum correlations in the system @xcite .",
    "interestingly , if the oscillators experience losses in separate baths , synchronization does not emerge , independently of the strength of their coupling @xcite .",
    "when more than two detuned oscillators are considered and depending on the environment correlation length , synchronization and robust quantum correlations can arise not only in a transient but even @xmath0 @xcite , associated with the presence of some decoherence - free normal mode of the system , as reported even for random networks @xcite .",
    "a main open question is about the possibility to induce synchronization in the presence of a different kind of coupling to the environment , giving rise to dephasing rather than dissipation . in this paper",

    "another question that naturally arises about synchronization in the quantum regime is whether it is related to the appearance of entanglement or of more general quantum correlations , measured , e.g. , by quantum discord whose dynamics has been studied extensively for a detuned spin pair in a common environment ( see , for instance , refs .",
    "@xcite ) .    comparing with previous works on synchronization in the quantum regime @xcite , an important difference is that we are going to consider spins that are not directly coupled to each other , so that spontaneous synchronization as well as quantum correlations only arise due to the indirect , bath - mediated coupling .",

    "it is important to remark here that , in general , the bloch - redfield second order master equation is known to provide neither a completely positive nor a positive map ( see , for instance , @xcite for a review ) .",
    "however , usually , if the system - bath coupling is weak enough , as compared to the energy scales of the system , positivity is not violated .",
    "for all the results presented hereafter , we have numerically checked the positivity of the reduced density matrix of the system from the beginning of the evolution ( where system and bath are assumed to be uncoupled ) until the system reaches or is very close to reaching a final state that can be stationary or oscillating depending on the existence of noise - free channels .      in the following section",
    ", we will show the occurrence of a _ significant _ time window in which the local observables of the two spins show synchronized oscillations before equilibration takes place .",
    "we will require this transient regime to be robust enough ( e.g. , to last for a very long time ) , and this will be linked to the appearance of slowly decaying solution of the bloch - redfield master equation ( [ roab ] ) .    in this respect",
    ", it is well known that special instances exist in which equilibration does not fully take place because some state of the system happens to be robust against decoherence @xcite , and that this can lead to asymptotic quantum correlations @xcite . indeed , despite the presence of a thermal environment , there are cases where a noiseless evolution can be observed , provided that the full hamiltonian possesses some special symmetry and that the initial state of the system belongs to a given _ decoherence free _ subspace .",
    "such subspaces are found to exist for the cases of ( a ) identical spins ( @xmath44 ) , or ( b ) purely dephasing dynamics ( @xmath18 ) . in the second case , in particular , the model hamiltonian becomes exactly solvable and its solution describes the only instance in which the system is not totally dissipative .",

    "according to refs .",
    "@xcite , the emergence of synchronization can be explained by considering that , because of dissipation , after a transient time , only the least - damped dynamical eigenmode survives . in order to find a quantitative link between synchronization and the existence of such a transient phase during which only one of the eigenmodes is active",
    ", we analyzed the behavior of the eigenvalues of the redfield tensor , represented as a @xmath122 matrix ( @xmath123 ) , as a function of the detuning @xmath62 and of the anisotropy @xmath22 .",

    "these real eigenvalues only influence decays and do not play any role as far as oscillatory dynamics is concerned ; then , we shall focus only on the complex ones",
    ".    all of the eigenmodes are damped , and the asymptotic dynamics is governed by the least damped one , with the eigenvalue s real part closest to zero .",
    "a significant synchronization window , then , should occur in the case in which the two ( pairs of ) eigenvalues with largest real parts ( smallest in absolute value ) , say @xmath126 and @xmath127 , satisfy the relation @xmath128 .    in general",
    ", however , monitoring the two smallest real parts of the eigenvalues of @xmath117 is not enough as , in many cases the corresponding eigenmodes do not give a relevant contribution to the expression for the local observables .",
    "an explicit and noteworthy example of such a situation occurs for the purely dephasing dynamics that is unable to give rise to synchronization despite the presence of decoherence - free modes .",
    "then , we considered the two pairs of eigenmodes having more influence on the specific observables we are interested in ; and , specifically , among the real parts of the three eigenvalues giving rise to the slowest decays , we selected the two entering @xmath129 and @xmath130 with the highest weights .",
    "the difference between the two decay rates selected in such a way , @xmath131 , is plotted in fig . [",

    "[ fig5 ] , we observe that there is a very good qualitative agreement between @xmath112 and @xmath131 , which confirms our understanding of the emergence of synchronization as a result of the presence of a slowly decaying mode giving a substantial contribution to local spin components .",
    "since synchronization is due to the robustness of an eigenmode of the bloch - redfield tensor , the synchronization frequency @xmath132 of the two spins is expected to be ( very close to ) the imaginary part of the corresponding eigenvalue .",
    "the agreement between the imaginary part of the eigenvalue corresponding to the mode that decays more slowly and the synchronization frequency is very good also in the presence of relatively strong detuning .",

    "[ fig5 ] , it becomes clear that there is a qualitative difference between a dephasing - dominated and a dissipative interaction with the environment ( roughly corresponding to positive and negative values of @xmath22 ) .",
    "a fully analogous behavior will be found when discussing classical and quantum correlations in sec .",
    "we observe that , when dissipative effects are strong ( @xmath139 ) the system is able to synchronize in a time @xmath112 that is shorter if @xmath62 is small and longer for large detunings . as a consequence , if @xmath62 is too big ( with respect to @xmath24 ) , the system reaches its steady state before synchronization can take place .    on the other hand ,",
    "observing the right parts of figs . [ fig5](a ) and [ fig5](b ) , we can conclude that if dephasing effects prevail ( @xmath140 ) synchronization does not take place , independently of the detuning .",
    "for pure dephasing , in particular , this can be seen directly by looking at the structure of eq .",
    "( [ romn ] ) , which implies a common decay factor for both @xmath108 and @xmath109 and the persistence of the two oscillation frequencies @xmath24 and @xmath141 in the whole transient regime .",
    "one could argue about the dependence of the synchronization diagram of fig . [",
    "fig5](a ) on the initial state .",
    "actually , given the role played by dissipation , the phenomenon is robust against changes in the initial conditions .",
    "synchronous dynamics only arises after the relaxation has washed out any sign of the initial state .",
    "another possible issue concerns the dependence of synchronization on the bath temperature . while in the case of harmonic oscillators described in ref .",
    "@xcite the decay rates of the master equation are temperature - independent , this is not true for the spin master equation discussed in this paper . given the connection between decay rates and synchronization , temperature could be imagined to play a role in determining synchronization times .",
    "we analyzed this issue in detail by studying various thermal regimes , but found no qualitative changes with respect to the physical picture given above .",
    "in particular , an increase in temperature ( with respect to the case @xmath101 of fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) would lead to an increase of @xmath112 , but only for large values of the detuning .",
    "so , short synchronization times would be almost unaffected , while long synchronization times would become longer by increasing the temperature of the bath .",
    "having established the regimes in which synchronization takes place in the open dynamics of our spin pair , we now explore a possible connection between the emergence of synchronous oscillations of the two subsystems and the appearance of asymptotic quantum correlations between them .",
    "we will measure the correlations using either entanglement or quantum discord ( whose definitions are briefly recalled below ) to show that their connection with synchronization is guaranteed by dissipation being progressively lost when dephasing overcomes losses .",
    "various indicators have been proposed for the degree of quantumness of the state of a bipartite system . among them , the entanglement of formation @xmath142 is a well established measure that quantifies the number of singlet states that are necessary to prepare a given entangled state using only local operations and classical communication @xcite . for the case of two qubits , it enjoys an analytic expression thanks to its monogamic relationship with the concurrence @xcite .",

    "the presence of dissipation induces a time scale separation in the decay rates of the eigenmodes of the redfield tensor , which govern the system s evolution .",
    "this allows one to observe spontaneous synchronization between the local observables of the two spins . when the precessions of the two spins are synchronous , long - time classical and quantum correlations ( as measured by quantum discord ) are found for the spin pair , which become more and more robust against decoherence as the synchronization time gets shorter ( which is the case for small detunings ) .",
    "on the other hand , a channel in which dephasing prevails is not able to generate any time scale separation and can not support any kind of dynamical synchronization .",
