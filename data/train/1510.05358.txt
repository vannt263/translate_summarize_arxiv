    "* the quantum dot sample . * the quantum dot ( qd ) sample is prepared on a semi - insulating ( 100 ) gaas substrate with a veeco gen - ii solid source molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe ) system . as illustrated in supplementary figure 1 ,",
    "the structure consists of a distributed bragg reflector ( dbr ) with @xmath103 periods of @xmath104 al@xmath65ga@xmath66as / gaas as the bottom mirror , a @xmath96-thick cavity in the center , and @xmath6-periods al@xmath65ga@xmath66as / gaas dbr as the top mirror .",
    "an inas qd layer with an ultra - low density of approximately @xmath105 @xmath106 is at the center of the @xmath96 planar cavity .",
    "this qd layer is grown @xmath6 nm above the al@xmath72ga@xmath73as layer to blue shift the emission wavelength to approximately @xmath7 nm . note that there are other ways to tune the emission of qds to @xmath7 nm , for example , using algainas qds @xcite or nonlinear frequency conversion ( @xmath107 to @xmath108 external conversion efficiency ) @xcite . we just have used the method that is more suitable for our experiment .      * the photoluminescence spectrum . * as shown in figure 2(a ) in the main text , there is a single peak in the photoluminescence spectrum .",
    "two reasons may explain this result .",
    "one reason may be that the other peaks are filtered or weakened by the dbr microcavity .",
    "the reflection spectrum of the dbr microcavity is shown in supplementary figure 2(a ) . to derive this spectrum , a thermal light source with a wide spectrum",
    "is used to irradiate a mirror and the sample , respectively , and two spectra are obtained .",
    "next , the latter spectrum is divided by the former spectrum to obtain the relative - intensity spectrum . in this figure ,",
    "the background is subtracted .",
    "we find that a sharp dip appears at the position of @xmath109 nm .",
    "this dip shows the cavity mode . when the light is resonant with the cavity mode , it is more likely to transmit through the dbr cavity , resulting in the dip in the reflected signal .",
    "the full width of half maximum ( fwhm ) is @xmath86 nm , so other peaks are very likely to be weakened , whereas this peak will be definitely strengthened by the dbr cavity because of the improvement of the collection efficiency .",
    "supplementary figure 2(b ) shows the logarithmic plot of the intensity versus excitation power for this single peak . the pink line is the linear fit for the data .",
    "the slope is fitted to be @xmath110 . according to the rate equations of the carriers in qd",
    ", the populations of the exciton and biexciton will increase linearly and quadratically , respectively , as the excitation power increases .",
    "therefore , the slope should be @xmath0 for the exciton and @xmath19 for the biexciton .",
    "the intermediate value indicates that this peak is probable to be a trion @xcite .",
    "this may be the second reason because the exciton line and biexciton line always appear as a pair , but the trion could have only a single line .",
    "the reason for this behavior is that there are two pairs of hole - electrons in a biexciton but only one pair in a trion ( and an additional electron or hole ) . in the experiment ,",
    "the generation of the trion is possible . because the mass of the hole is much larger than that of electron , when they are excited , the electron moves faster than the hole .",
    "this unbalanced carrier capture enables a trion to be produced more easily .",
    "we also perform the polarization dependent emission measurements for this qd using a quarter - wave plate ( qwp ) and a polarizer .",
    "the polarization state of the trion emission is supposed to be a mixture of @xmath111 , where @xmath91 , @xmath92 denote the horizontal and vertical polarization states , respectively .",
    "therefore , when only a polarizer is used in the measurement , the polarization spectrum is calculated to be a constant @xmath112 ; and when a qwp is inserted before the polarizer , the polarization spectrum is derived as @xmath113 , with @xmath114 representing the polarizer s angle and @xmath115 associated to the qwp s angle .",
    "the experimental results of these two situations are shown in supplementary figure 2(c ) and supplementary figure 2(d ) , respectively , which are then well fitted with the corresponding theoretical formulas .",
    "the fitting results show the ratio @xmath116 to be @xmath117 .",
    "furthermore , we measure the polarization - resolved photoluminescence ( pl ) spectra of this peak using a linear polarizer and a piezo driven etalon with a free spectral range ( fsr ) of @xmath118 ghz and a bandwidth of @xmath78 ghz . the results are shown in supplementary figure 2(e ) .",
    "the black dots and the pink dots correspond to single - photon emissions detected when the polarizer is set to the directions of @xmath119 and @xmath120 ( the definitions of these notations can be referred in @xcite ) , respectively .",
    "if the qd contains an exciton or a biexciton , the exchange interaction will cause a fine structure splitting ( fss ) between these two polarization - resolved spectra ; whereas , if the qd contains a trion , the exchange interaction will vanish , so the fss will also vanish @xcite . here by fitting our results respectively with lorentz function @xcite ( the black and pink lines in the figure corresponding to the data represented with the same - color dots , respectively ) , we derive the difference of the centers of these two polarization - resolved spectra , which is @xmath121 @xmath122ev .",
    "this value is much less than the fss reported in the previous works ( typically tens of @xmath122ev to greater than @xmath2 @xmath122ev ) @xcite .",
    "therefore , to some extent we can conclude that our qd contains a trion within the accuracy of the experiment .",
    "the non - vanished value of the splitting may be caused by the imperfect optical mirrors and windows of the cryostat .    although we suppose that our qd may contain a trion , we note that this is not an essential issue in this work .",
    "exciton , biexciton and trion are equivalent here since they all emit true single photons . with this property at hand , reliable quantum repeaters can be constructed @xcite .",
    "furthermore , when specific carriers are used in our configuration , more advanced quantum applications will be realized .      *",
    "the local heating . * supplementary figure 3(a ) shows a sketch of how the heating laser is directed to the vicinity of the selected qd ( side view of the sample ) .",
    "first , the laser is focused to the cleaved edge of the qd sample using a 50x long working distance ( @xmath1 mm ) objective with n.a . of @xmath123 .",
    "next , the objective is moved along the @xmath124 axis until the dbr microcavity is found .",
    "in this situation , the dbr mirrors acts as a waveguide for the heating laser with the @xmath124 direction restricted @xcite . the separation between these two dbr is approximately @xmath0 @xmath122 m .",
    "meanwhile , the dispersion in the @xmath125 direction is estimated to be less than @xmath98 mm due to the high refractive index ( approximately @xmath126 ) of the sample and considering the height ( along @xmath127 axis ) of the sample of @xmath86 mm .",
    "next , we move the objective along @xmath125 axis to find the selected qd with the wavelength - shift effect becoming closer to optimal . finally , the distance between the objective and the sample in @xmath127 direction can also be tuned slightly to make the focused spot be closer to the qd .",
    "notably , other qds exposed by this laser are also heated , but because the volume of the heating area is very small , the global sample remains cool ; therefore , the inconvenience caused by heat expansion can still be avoided .    in this experiment ,",
    "a high - power @xmath11-nm laser was used as the heating laser , which has a photon energy below the bandgap of gaas . however , the sample does not appear absolutely transparent for this light .",
    "there exists a weak absorption which may be due to the imperfections of the material of the sample , for example , the defect centers generated during the sample growth , which can absorb the heating photons and convert the energy into phonons .",
    "this phenomenon also appears in other systems , for example , the absorption of @xmath128-nm light in a silicon spherical microcavity @xcite . in our situation ,",
    "the laser power is high ( @xmath12 mw ) ; therefore , we can observe the heating effect clearly .",
    "we also use a @xmath129-nm laser to repeat the local - heating process , with the result shown in supplementary figure3(b ) .",
    "we find the power of the laser should be much larger than that in the @xmath11-nm case .",
    "approximately @xmath118 mw is required to shift the peak to @xmath7 nm , whereas the ratio of the coupling efficiencies to the dbr waveguide for the @xmath11-nm and @xmath129-nm lasers is estimated to be not more than @xmath130 .",
    "this result can be explained by the fewer defect centers that are able to be excited by the @xmath129 nm photons because of the smaller photon energy .",
    "there are other technologies to finely tune the wavelength of the qd s emission , such as electric field , strain , or magnetic field . compared with these methods ,",
    "local heating is more suitable for us .",
    "the first reason is that local heating is simple .",
    "only a high - power laser is required , without the complex sample fabrication procedures , the requirement of piezoelectric actuators placed in the cryostat , or the use of a superconducting magnet .",
    "the second reason is the dbr mirrors that are used for improving the collection efficiency of single photons are just right used as a waveguide for the heating laser to flow to the selected qd .      *",
    "the preparation of the atomic frequency comb . *",
    "the atomic frequency comb ( afc ) technique is utilized to realize reversible quantum state transfer between single photons and atomic excitations @xcite .",
    "the afc protocol requires a tailored absorption profile composed of a series of periodic and narrow absorbing peaks separated by @xmath26 .",
    "the input single photons can be absorbed and diffracted by the afc .",
    "a collective echo emission is retrieved after a storage time @xmath131 in the crystals .",
    "the pump light for establishing afc comes from a frequency stabilized ti : sapphire laser ( mbr-110 , coherent ) . using the double - pass configured acousto - optic modulator",
    "( aom2 in figure 1 of main text ) , the pump laser frequency is swept over @xmath2 mhz in each @xmath132 @xmath122s cycle , and its amplitude is modulated periodically to give a comb structure ( supplementary figure 4 ) .",
    "this pump sequence is continuously repeated in the preparation phase to produce an optimized afc structure .",
    "the afc bandwidth prepared with the aom is approximately @xmath2 mhz and is limited by the effective bandwidth of the double - pass configured aom . to further extend the memory bandwidth , the output light of the aom is directed into a fiber - coupled high - speed electro - optic phase modulator ( eom in figure 1 of the main text , where the fibers are not sketched ) that creates first and second - order sidebands @xcite .",
    "the comb at the carrier frequency is copied twice on each side . to ensure zero frequency detuning for the copied combs , the driver frequency for the eom",
    "is chosen as @xmath2 mhz . the radio frequency ( rf )",
    "power for driving the eom is experimentally optimized to optimize the storage efficiency . in this way ,",
    "an overall comb width of approximately @xmath23 mhz is achieved in our experiment . during the @xmath13-ms preparation time",
    ", the pump laser is sent to the nd@xmath3:yvo@xmath4 crystals to prepare the afc by pumping ions with certain frequencies to the auxiliary state ( see the inset of figure 1 in the main text ) .",
    "the lifetime of the ground state and the auxiliary state is @xmath133 ms , much longer than the @xmath6-ms storage - and - retrieval time .",
    "this feature ensured that the single photons can be successfully stored in the storage - and - retrieval procedure when the pump laser is turned off in order to reduce the pump noise .",
    "* the spectral , temporal and photon correlation characteristics of the input and output photons . * here we primarily discuss the situation of narrow single - photon pulses , which attracts more interest in this work .",
    "the linewidth of the qd emission is approximately @xmath134 ghz , which is determined using a piezo tunable etalon with a fsr of @xmath118 ghz and a bandwidth of @xmath78 ghz .",
    "the lifetime of this emission is @xmath135 ns , which means its natural linewidth is less than the detected linewidth .",
    "this lifetime is derived by using a picosecond pulse laser to excite the qd , and a picosecond time analyzer ( pta ) to obtain the time spectrum , which is then fitted with the exponential decay function ( see supplementary figure 5(a ) ) .",
    "the line broadening was mainly caused by spectral diffusion .",
    "resonant excitation can be used to reduce the linewidth in the future works ( at best , @xmath136-mhz linewidth of the qd emission has been achieved using resonant excitation @xcite , which is much narrower than the memory bandwidth here ) . after passing through the filters and the etalons ( see figure 1 in main text ) ,",
    "the linewidth of the single photons is reduced to @xmath81 mhz , which is determined by the bandwidth of the etalons .",
    "the memory bandwidth is @xmath23 mhz ; therefore , the linewidth of the retrieved single photons is limited to @xmath23 mhz .",
    "the memory bandwidth is possible to be extended to several @xmath137 by using one aom and more eoms to prepare the afc .",
    "the temporal widths of the input and output photons can be derived by fitting the first peak ( transmitted photons ) and the second peak ( stored photons ) in figure 4(a ) in main text , respectively , with gaussian function .",
    "the fitting results are @xmath138 ns and @xmath139 ns for the first and second peaks , respectively .",
    "the temporal width of the stored single - photon pulse is approximately @xmath140 times of that of the input pulse .",
    "this ratio is approximately equal to that of the linewidths of the input photons over the output photons ( @xmath81 mhz@xmath141 mhz@xmath142 ) .",
    "supplementary figure 5(b ) shows the screenshot of a fast oscilloscope ( tektronix , dpo4104b ) with a resolution of @xmath31 ps . the yellow line is the signal of the excitation laser detected by a fast photodetector ( thorlabs , det02afc ) with @xmath143 ghz bandwidth and @xmath80 ps rise time",
    "the excitation laser is modulated to narrow pulses using a @xmath6 ghz eom driven by a synchronized high - speed pulse generator ( tektronix , awg7082c ) , which supplies a series of @xmath95-ns electric pulses .",
    "the fwhm of the excitation pulse is measured to be @xmath22 ns ( the difference may be caused by the imperfect cables ) , which is less than the qd s lifetime of @xmath135 ns .",
    "therefore , the qd can be excited only once per pulse , i.e. , only one photon exists in the pulse .",
    "the hanbury brown - twiss ( hbt ) experiment also illustrates this point , as shown in supplementary figure 5(c ) . during this hbt experiment ,",
    "the electric pulses are supplied with the temporal width of @xmath95 ns ( as it is in the memory experiment ) and the period of @xmath144 ns . the integration time is @xmath145 hours .",
    "the missing peak at the zero delay demonstrates there is only one photon per pulse .",
    "the autocorrelation is estimated to be @xmath146 .",
    "in the output pulses , there will also be one photon per pulse at most because the memory process will not increase the photon number .",

    "<S> wait time , the @xmath6-ms storage and retrieval procedure begins . </S>",
    "<S> the pump laser is blocked by chopper1 , and single photons come out . </S>",
    "<S> the modulation of single photons is achieved by modulating the @xmath62-nm excitation laser using aom1 ( figure 1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this method can reduce the loss of single photons . </S>",
    "<S> the storage and retrieval period is denoted as @xmath15 , and the width of the modulated excitation laser pulse is denoted as @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> the single photons hence become a series of pulses as well , with a period of @xmath15 and a pulsewidth slightly larger than @xmath21 due to the qd s lifetime . </S>",
    "<S> the single photons are then focused on the nd@xmath3:yvo@xmath4 crystals by the same lens2 and in the same site as the pump laser to be absorbed by the frequency - tailored ions . </S>",
    "<S> the spot size of the pump laser is tuned to @xmath24 times of that of the single photons , creating good spatial overlap of these two light beams in the non - collinear configuration . </S>",
    "<S> this experimental setting sufficiently reduces the noise while maintaining the memory efficiency . </S>",
    "<S> next , after a time of @xmath16 , which is determined by the period of the frequency comb , the retrieved single photons are re - emitted as a result of the collective interference among all of the ions that are in phase . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the single photons are collimated by lens3 and detected by the sspd , which is immersed in liquid helium and operated at @xmath88 k. its detection efficiency for our single photons is approximately @xmath94 , and the dark count rate is roughly @xmath88 s@xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> the time spectra are obtained by sending the sspd signals to a time - correlated single photon counting ( tcspc ) system . </S>",
    "<S> the electrical pulses that are synchronized with the excitation light pulses ( @xmath62 nm ) are used as the trigger signal . </S>",
    "<S> the integration range was chosen to be the same as @xmath15 , and the time interval was chosen to be @xmath0 ns for figure 3(b ) and @xmath95 ns for figure 4 .    </S>",
    "<S> pbs1 , hwp1 , pbs2 , hwp2 and the phase plate are used for the polarization - qubit - memory experiment , the configurations of which have been introduced in the results section . </S>",
    "<S> hwp2 is rotated to the angle where the photon count is maximized when figure 3(b ) and figure 4 are measured . </S>",
    "<S> hwp1 does not affect the maximum value of the photon count , but affects that at which angle of hwp2 the maximum count will appear .    * brief summary about the snr improvement . * first </S>",
    "<S> , the qd is grown in a @xmath96 planar dbr microcavity . </S>",
    "<S> the vertical mode of this microcavity is centered on approximately @xmath7 nm ( see supplementary note 1 and supplementary note 2 for details ) . </S>",
    "<S> this structure makes the qd preferentially emit vertically , where the single photons are collected , in contrast with the @xmath97-solid - angle emission corresponding to a free qd @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> second , we use a high n.a . </S>",
    "<S> ( @xmath63 ) aspheric lens ( lens1 ) placed in the cryostat to collect the single photons instead of a long working distance objective , which has a typical n.a . of approximately @xmath98 . </S>",
    "<S> the photon count is approximately @xmath99 per second with continue - wave excitation . </S>",
    "<S> third , the intensity modulation is performed on the excitation laser instead of on the single photons directly . </S>",
    "<S> this method prevents signal loss during the generation of the time sequence . </S>",
    "<S> fourth , in the quantum memory experiment , we use a non - collinear configuration for the pump light and the signal photons . </S>",
    "<S> this configuration prevents the single - photon loss that occurs during the combination of the signal light beam and the pump light beam , which is required in the collinear configuration . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the spot size of the focused pump light is @xmath24 times that of the single photons , allowing the memory efficiency in the non - collinear configuration to be as high as that in the collinear configuration . </S>",
    "<S> the non - collinear configuration also greatly suppresses the noise induced by the pump laser . </S>",
    "<S> finally , an sspd is used instead of a silicon single - photon avalanche diode . </S>",
    "<S> the dark count rate of the sspd can be as low as @xmath88 s@xmath71 .    </S>"
