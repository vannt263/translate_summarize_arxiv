    "one of the purposes of spintronics is to control the magnetization direction of a ferromagnet by using electric currents instead of an external magnetic field .",
    "recently the magnetization reversal due to spin - transfer - torque effect @xcite has been intensively investigated , which requires multilayer structures such as spin valves , tunnel junctions or domain walls . on the other hand ,",
    "another method to switch magnetization direction , which is due to the spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) , was suggested theoretically @xcite and verified experimentally @xcite .",
    "for instance , a giant spin torque is observed in an asymmetric ferromagnetic metal layer alo@xmath0/co / pt , and a current - driven magnetic field of @xmath1 t for a driven current @xmath2 a/@xmath3 is reported @xcite .    in the above systems , the rashba - type spin splitting is dominant owing to the interplay between the asymmetric structure and a strong soc derived from the pt atom .",
    "rashba systems @xcite under an external electric field or a current injection become spin - polarized because the spin distribution on the fermi surfaces becomes imbalanced . in ferromagnetic metals ,",
    "on the other hand , there exists an exchange coupling between conduction electrons spins and localized spins . under the non - equilibrium state ,",
    "magnetization in ferromagnetic rashba systems is macroscopically given a spin torque .",
    "now if we assume a single - domain ferromagnet , the stability of magnetic ordering is characterized by the anisotropic field .",
    "thus the magnetization can be reversed when the spin torque overcomes the anisotropic field .",
    "contrary to a spin - transfer torque , there is no transfer of spin angular momentum from outside .",
    "rather , orbital angular momentum in a crystal is converted to spin angular momentum via the spin - orbit coupling , and is transfered to a ferromagnet .",
    "this mechanism is intrinsic to the band structure and does not require two non - collinear ferromagnets .",
    "moreover , it is theoretically reported that compared with some systems with the spin - orbit coupling due to impurities or luttinger spin - orbit bands , the rashba system presents a giant spin torque to reverse the magnetization owing to the inversion asymmetry @xcite .",
    "therefore , a spin torque due to the rashba spin - orbit coupling attracts many interests as a realistic candidate in spintronic applications .    in this paper , we explore possibility of the current - induced magnetization reversal by examining three - dimensional models with the rashba soc ( 3d rashba models ) theoretically , and compare the results with the 2d rashba models .",
    "we focus on the low - density regime where only the lower band lies on the fermi energy .",
    "this low - density regime has not been studied for 2d rashba models , either .",
    "this low - density regime becomes realistic when the rashba parameter is large , e.g. in the recent discovery of the new bulk rashba semiconductor bitei @xcite .",
    "in this material , the rashba effect is induced by the structural inversion asymmetry in the bulk crystal structure , and therefore the rashba soc is much stronger than the typical value of the rashba soc in 2d semiconductor heterostructures @xcite or that in metal surfaces @xcite .    as we vary the fermi energy , the topology of the fermi surface changes .",
    "correspondingly , we found that the spin torque as a function of the fermi energy @xmath4 behaves differently between the both sides of the topological transition .",
    "moreover , we examine the spin - torque efficiency which is the spin torque divided by the applied electric current , in order to discuss how to enhance the efficiency in association with the current - induced magnetization reversal .",
    "we calculate the spin torque on the magnetization of a ferromagnet driven by the spin polarization of conduction electrons in systems with a strong soc .",
    "we consider three - dimensional models with the rashba effect , i.e. , 3d rashba models @xcite .",
    "we take the direction of structural inversion symmetry breaking as @xmath5 axis and conduction electrons move in three dimensions . in our model , we also include localized spins coupled to the conduction electrons via the exchange coupling .",
    "our hamiltonian is thus described by @xmath6 where @xmath7 represent the effective masses of conduction electrons with the @xmath8 plane and along the @xmath5 axis respectively , @xmath9 represents the rashba parameter , @xmath10 is an exchange coupling between conduction electrons and magnetization , @xmath11 is the direction of magnetization and @xmath12 is the pauli matrices .",

    "equations ( [ es ] ) and ( [ wf ] ) look similar to 2d rashba models , but the shape of fermi surfaces is nontrivial in 3d rashba models as shown in fig .",
    "[ fs ] ( a ) .",
    "in the regime of strong exchange coupling , i.e. , @xmath19 , the fermi surfaces are mainly governed by the zeeman splitting , where @xmath20 denotes the fermi wave number . when the fermi energy crosses both the upper and lower bands ( which we refer to as the high - density regime ) , the system has a larger and a smaller ellipsoidal fermi surfaces .",
    "when the fermi energy lies on only the lower band ( which we refer to as the low - density regime ) , the system has a single ellipsoidal fermi surface . in the regime of weak exchange coupling ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath21 , on the other hand , the fermi surfaces are mainly determined by the rashba - type spin splitting . in the high - density regime ,",

    "their contributions are expected to cancel partially .",
    "now we have assumed the constant relaxation - time approximation for both limiting regimes . since the relaxation time generally depends on the fermi energy , the relaxation times @xmath98 in the expressions of the spin torque and the electric conductivity",
    "are replaced by @xmath99 .",
    "however , the spin - torque efficiency is independent of the fermi energy in the low - density regime because the spin torque and the electric current are both proportional to the relaxation time @xmath100 . in particular",
    ", the spin - torque efficiency in the low - density regime does not alter for the above replacement @xmath101 . according to the formalism by schliemann and loss @xcite ,",

    "finally we suggest methods to realize the magnetization reversal in 3d rashba systems experimentally .",
    "one way is to synthesize ferromagnetic bulk rashba semiconductors by doping magnetic impurities into bulk materials with a strong soc , e.g. , bitei .",
    "nevertheless , synthesis of a new ferromagnetic semiconductor is quite difficult , which would be a challenging and promising issue for materials science . on the other hand",
    ", it is known that wide - gap semiconductors such as mn - doped gan , co - doped zno and v - doped zno present ferromagnetism even over the room temperature @xcite .",
    "gan and zno have wurtzite - type crystalline structure and are conventional rashba semiconductors .",
    "since these semiconductors present much smaller rashba spin splitting ( about @xmath117 mev@xmath118 in zno and @xmath119 mev@xmath118 in gan ) @xcite , bitei is suitable for demonstrating the magnetization reversal to fabricate ferromagnetic rashba semiconductors .",

    "we take bitei doped with magnetic element as an example , and use the values @xmath120 and @xmath121 for bitei @xcite . for numerical estimate , we assume mn as dopant , and take the saturation magnetization @xmath122 and the anisotropy field @xmath123 adopted from mn - doped semiconductors @xcite .",
    "the estimated maximum spin - torque efficiency is @xmath124 for the low - density regime , which is realized for the optimal condition @xmath125 if the fermi energy lies in the vicinity of the band bottom .",
    "therefore , the critical electric current density is evaluated as @xmath126 , which is much lower than that observed in the 2d rashba system such as pt / co / alo@xmath127 junction @xcite .",
    "we have investigated a spin torque and its efficiency induced by the rashba spin - orbit coupling in three dimensions using the boltzmann transport theory .",
    "it was shown that in the high - density regime , the increase of the spin torque as a function of the fermi energy is slower than that in the low - density regime .",
    "it is because in the high - density regime , there occurs cancellation between the two spin - split bands .",
    "we also found that high spin - torque efficiency is achieved when the fermi energy lies on only the lower band and there exists an optimal value for the rashba parameter .",
    "the spin - torque efficiency becomes maximum when the rashba spin - splitting energy is comparable to the exchange energy with the localized spins , and then its maximum values are determined by the rashba momentum .",
