    "the same problem in the model of random geometric graphs was analyzed by mller and sereni  @xcite , and foucaud and perarnau  @xcite studied the same problem in random @xmath62-regular graphs .",

    "the cardinality of the set of vertices at a certain graph distance from a given vertex @xmath13 does not differ much for various @xmath13 .",

    "if these two groups are roughly of the same size , then a typical vertex added to the resolving set distinguishes a lot of pairs of vertices , and hence the metric dimension is small . if , on the other hand , these two groups are very different in size , a typical vertex distinguishes those few vertices belonging to the second largest group from the rest .",
    "the number of other pairs that are distinguished is negligible and hence the metric dimension is large .",

    ", the number of vertices at graph distance @xmath66 increases more and more , and at some point this number is comparable to the number of vertices at graph distance @xmath24 .",

    "as before , the largest error term for the expectation appears for the largest possible value of @xmath11 .",
    "the concentration follows from  ( [ chern ] ) , and thus ( again , exactly as before ) the error term in the concentration result is the largest for @xmath143 . using that @xmath163 , the expected number of pairs @xmath164 for which the statement fails for @xmath143 is , by applying  ( [ chern ] ) with @xmath165 , at most @xmath166 provided @xmath167 for some function @xmath168 tending to infinity with @xmath51 .",

    "next , we shall concentrate on @xmath175 and shall obtain a slightly better error term for the case @xmath143 .",
    "it is well known ( and can be easily shown using markov s inequality ) that a.a.s .",

    "conditioning on this we get from part ( i ) that @xmath177 and the result holds for @xmath143 , since @xmath178 . as before , the error term is maximal for @xmath143 : indeed , for @xmath179 we already showed that the expectation of @xmath180 can be estimated in the same way as the expectation of @xmath181 , since its size is not affected by disregarding @xmath160 .",
