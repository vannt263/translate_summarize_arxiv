    "the study of typical continuous functions has been one of the most popular topics in classical real analysis .",
    "several people have also investigated typical behaviour in other families of functions , such as those of bounded functions of baire class  @xmath0 , of bounded darboux functions of baire class  @xmath0 , and of bounded derivatives , where the topology is given by the supremum norm .",
    "kostyrko and alt @xcite proved a theorem , applicable to general families of bounded functions , on the continuity points of typical functions .",
