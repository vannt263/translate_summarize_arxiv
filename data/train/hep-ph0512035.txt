    "since the beginning of the quest of quark matter deep changes have developed in our concept in understanding its properties . in table [ table.1 ] the ideas are collected , which dominated at the beginning of quark matter research .",
    "the present status of these ideas are also displayed .",
    "although theoretical models supported the early concept , but the experimental data forced to change these speculations step by step .",
    "thus the picture of a static , weakly interacting gaseous quark - gluon plasma was substituted by the more dynamic , strongly interacting fluid - like quark - gluon matter , where the ingredients gained an effective mass during the intense microscopical interactions .",

    "the value of @xmath3 is @xmath4 for hadron gas in equilibrium , and @xmath5 for the quark gluon plasma , the measured @xmath6 value is near to 3 .",
    "however , in the constituent quark coalescence scenario ( alcor ) one can also expect a @xmath4 value .",
    "the idea of quark coalescence can be applied at relatively large momenta and the hadron spectra at high-@xmath7 can be investigated successfully  @xcite . in this kinematic region , especially at @xmath8 gev , the mass of the light and strange quarks can be neglected , @xmath9 , and the calculations are simplified . assuming",
    "that the most dominant kinematic window is overwhelming , then @xmath10    the expression for the meson emission spectrum  @xcite : @xmath11    a similar expression is valid for the baryon emission spectrum : @xmath12    these two equations lead to an interesting consequence : since the momentum distribution of constituent quarks is expected to behave as an exponentially decreasing function of transverse momentum , there are more partons at @xmath13 than at @xmath14 .",
    "@xmath15    from that follows , that we have more baryons than mesons in the momentum range where hadrons are produced by coalescence .",
    "this explains the surprising momentum dependence of the observed proton to meson ratio  @xcite .",
    "this description also implies the conservation of quark and antiquark numbers in the hadronization process .      _ mass distribution of quarks _    since the effective mass of quarks are determined by their interaction with the neighborhood , and the matter in the fireball is not smooth and homogeneous , the granulated structure of the fireball is reflected in the effective mass distribution of the quarks .",

    "the calculated meson and baryon source functions and their space - time integrals in eq.([coal1 ] ) yield theoretical spectra comparable to experimental data @xcite . in figure [ spect_pion ] we display our results for pion production together with the experimental data on @xmath39 and @xmath40 production at mid - rapidity in au+au collisions at @xmath41 agev .",
