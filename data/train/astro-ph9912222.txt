    "[ all_spectrum ] . all four spectra agree with each other within @xmath13 in energy .",
    "it should be noted that the energy assignment in each experiment has been done separately by each group .",
    "the fly s eye experiment measures the longitudinal development of electrons above the observation level and is calorimetric .",
    "the yakutsk group determined the energy conversion relation experimentally by measuring not only the lateral distributions of electrons and muons but also the energy loss of electrons above the observation level from the erenkov lateral distribution at the observation level .",
    "the haverah park experiment used water - erenkov detectors and the agasa uses plastic scintillation detectors , the energy conversions of both experiments rely on different simulation codes .",
    "however , the energy assignment is in fairly good agreement as shown by the water tank experiment at akeno @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , cronin @xcite argued that the agasa energy spectrum should be about 30% higher in energy , if the energy is assigned in each experiment according to the simulation results based on the mocca program with the sibyll hadronic interaction model . according to their simulation ,",

    "that is , the agasa energy spectrum results in much higher intensity than other experiments at the same energy .",
    "recently kutter pointed out that the difference is due to the large contribution of low energy photons @xcite in the scintillators in case of agasa . though the energy loss of electrons and photons in scintillator ( @xmath15 ) in units of a vertically traversing muon is independent of scintillator thickness , the ratio of @xmath15 to the number of charged particles ( r@xmath16 ) depends on the core distance .",
    "r@xmath16 is about 1.1 within 100 m from the core and agrees with the experiment @xcite .",
    "however , it increases as the core distance increases .",
    "it becomes about 1.2 around 600 m from the core in case of mocca ( sibyll ) and 1.4 in case of corsika ( qgsjet ) simulations .",
    "the difference between the simulation code is due to the difference of energy spectra of low energy photons and electrons far from the core .",
    "this ratio r@xmath16 depends also on the number of charged particles which increases as the cutoff energy of electromagnetic component decreases .    therefore , it is important to evaluate the energy conversion factor eq .",
    "[ eq - energy1 ] used in agasa experiment with simulation programs other than the cosmos simulation , by taking into account the energy losses of low energy photons and electrons in scintillator .",
    "since the total number of muons in an extensive air shower with a fixed primary energy depends on the chemical composition , the possibility of discriminating heavy particles from protons has been extensively studied by many authors .",
    "for example , dawson _",
    "et al_. @xcite argues that the muon density at 600 m from the core , @xmath4(600 ) , vs. energy relation observed at akeno can be consistently explained by the change of composition from heavy around 10@xmath0 ev to light around 10@xmath12 ev , which is claimed by the fly s eye group @xcite .",
    "however , they avoided the discussion of change of composition around 10@xmath0 ev which is a point of disagreement between the fly s eye experiment and the akeno experiment . according to their simulation result @xcite",

    "as the arrival directions of observed eas are inclined from the zenith , it is necessary to convert @xmath18(600 ) , where @xmath19 represents the zenith angle , to @xmath2(600 ) . for zenith angles less than 45@xmath20 ( @xmath211.4 ) , @xmath22 \\label{zenith - dep1}\\ ] ]",

    "this was derived , in @xcite , between @xmath29 ev and @xmath30 ev . since this attenuation with zenith angle is related closely to the properties of hadronic interactions at ultra - high energy and to the composition of primary cosmic rays , the interpretation of the present result by simulation result",
    "is important .    in this article",
    ", we use the eas simulation program corsika ( cosmic ray simulation for kascade ) @xcite which was developed at karlsruhe and is now widely distributed and used by various experiments from tev gamma - rays to the highest energy region .",
    "recently the program was improved to be used effectively at the highest observed energy @xcite . by employing the effective thin sampling procedure , the computing time is considerably reduced and hence various combinations of simulation conditions with different energies",
    "have been realized in this study .",
    "the agasa is the akeno giant air shower array covering over 100 km@xmath10 area in operation at the village of akeno about 130 km west of tokyo , to study ultra high energy cosmic rays ( uhecr ) above 10@xmath12 ev @xcite .",
    "the lateral distribution of electrons and the shower front structure far from the core , which are important to obtain @xmath18(600 ) , are determined with the numerous detectors of 1 km@xmath10 array ( a1 ) when showers hit inside the akeno branch .",

    "it is important to examine with simulations whether such an energy independence can be understood with a pure proton composition of the primary particles .      at agasa ,",
    "muons of energies above 0.5 gev are measured under the lead / iron or concrete shielding . at the first stage of agasa experiment ,",
    "the lateral distribution of muons far from the core was determined with eight muon detectors of 25 m@xmath10 each ( threshold muon energy : 1 gev ) in the central part of the akeno observatory triggered by the agasa scintillation detectors on the surface .",

    "[ equi_e_mu600 ] , the attenuation of @xmath81(600 ) , which consists of electrons above 1 mev and muons above 10 mev , does not depend on primary energy and composition .    as is described before , @xmath2(600 ) must be evaluated as @xmath15(600 ) , energy deposit in a scintillator in units of v@xmath69 , at various zenith angles taking into account the increase of scintillator thickness with zenith angle .",

    "if we evaluate the density measured by scintillator of 5 cm thickness as @xmath2(600 ) by taking into account similar conditions as in the experiment , the conversion relation from @xmath2(600 ) to the primary energy can be written as @xmath86 = 2.15 \\times 10^{17 } s_0(600)^{1.015}.\\ ] ] this means that the energy assignment of the agasa experiment is shifted to higher energies , if we estimate it using corsika .    the slope of @xmath4 vs. @xmath2(600 ) relation in the experiment is flatter than that in simulations of any hadronic model and primary composition .",
    "the situation may not be changed even by taking into account the primary energy spectrum and fluctuations of @xmath4 and @xmath2(600 ) .",
    "since the slope seems to be constant in a wide primary energy range , we need to study this relation over a wide energy range .",
    "otherwise the composition may be interpreted as heavier than iron or lighter than proton outside the narrow investigated energy region .",
    "there is a disagreement of the attenuation length determined at agasa and that by corsika simulation , even if we take into account the particle incident angle to the scintillator .",
    "if we take into account the experimental error in zenith angle determination and @xmath2(600 ) determination , the disagreement increases .",
    "since the experimental data used in the present analysis is still preliminary , we better wait for the publication of new experimental values for further discussions .",
