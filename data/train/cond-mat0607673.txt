    "the decay process for a metastable system received considerable attention for long time . by using the wkb analysis of the fokker - planck ( fp ) equation , van kampen@xcite investigated the role of fluctuations in thermal diffusion process under a symmetric bistable system and found that the system s ergodicity enables a brownian particle to escape over the potential barrier . in asymptotic time regime",
    ", he also obtained the astonishingly accurate formula for the so - called kramers escape rate , i.e. , the rate at which a brownian particle escapes from a potential well over the single - humped barrier .",
    "later , caroli et al.@xcite explored the asymmetric bistable system using a path integral ( instanton ) formalism .",
    "the separation of the time scale required for the kramers rate treatment was investigated by kapral@xcite by using the projection operator approach . for a langevin equation with spatially- and time - correlated colored noise in the case of weak damping , the staggered - ladder spectra of the corresponding fp equation are found@xcite .",
    "recently , nicolis and co - workers@xcite studied the decay in the system with a metastable intermediate state in the context of the protein crystallization , and within the rate equation treatment they gave an important suggestion that the existence of the intermediate state can enhance the nucleation rate under some parameter range .",
    "we note that one - dimensional treatment of chemical reaction along the reaction coordinate in the free energy landscape is very useful to describe the above problem .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the role of an intermediate state in nucleation phenomenon based on the wkb analysis of fp equation for the one - dimensional order parameter , and present a doubly - humped - barrier counterpart of the kramers rate@xcite .",
    "the decay rate is given as the 1st excited eigenvalue of the fp operator .",
    "as is well known , fp equation is transformed into the associated schrdinger equation and in the case that a well - defined thermal equilibrium does exist , eigenvalues of fp equation are exactly the same as those of schrdinger equation@xcite .",
    "further , in the low - temperature case we can apply the wkb analysis to the system with a triple - well potential and extend kramers escape rate to the situation with a doubly - humped barrier .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we reduce the fp equation into the schrdinger equation and obtain the wkb quantization condition for a system with triple - well potential .",
    "section 3 is concerned with the evaluation of the tunneling integral , leading to the extended kramers formula for the doubly - humped potential barrier . in section 4",
    "the condition for the enhancement of nucleation rate caused by the intermediate state is revealed . in section 5",
    "we numerically check the validity of our new formula for the nucleation rate .",
    "appendix is devoted to the alternative evaluation of the nucleation rate in the case of a shallow middle well , within the standard framework of the mean - first - passage time problem .",
    "relaxation process responsible for a homogeneous nucleation is described by fp equation as @xmath0 @xmath1 is the viscosity and @xmath2 is the temperature .",
    "hereafter we assume @xmath3 for simplicity . in order to specify the problem",
    ", we consider the symmetric triple - well potential proposed by nicolis _",
    "@xcite , @xmath4 with @xmath5 , which has two potential minima at @xmath6 , two maxima at @xmath7 and one local minimum at @xmath8 as shown in fig.1(a ) .",
    "this potential mimics the barrier accompanied with a cave on the top of the double - well potential , which represents the presence of the intermediate state . by the separation anzats",
    "@xmath9 , the fp equation is transformed into the associated schrdinger equation , @xmath10 with the effective potential @xmath11 and @xmath12 corresponding to @xmath13 in quantum mechanics with planck constant @xmath14 and mass @xmath15 . equation ( [ assosch ] )",
    "has the self - evident lowest - eigenvalue @xmath16 with the eigenfunction @xmath17 and the remaining eigenvalues satisfy @xmath18 .",
    "the problem of the time evolution of the probability density @xmath19 initially distributed in the left well reduces to that of finding the lowest few eigenvalues of eq.([assosch ] ) .",
    "eventually the decay rate @xmath20 is given by the first - excited eigenvalue .",
    "as shown in fig.1(b ) , @xmath21 has also symmetric three wells and two barriers .",
    "we note : even if the central well is shallow in the original potential @xmath22 ( see fig.2(a ) ) , the effective potential @xmath21 is negative at the corresponding local minimum ( @xmath23 ) , and for the original triple - well potential the effective potential @xmath21 has three potential minima , all with negative values ( fig.2(b ) ) .",
    "thus _ the lowest three eigenvalues of eq.([assosch ] ) including @xmath16 experience all the three potential minima and two maxima _ ( see figs.1(b ) and 2(b ) ) .",
    "we are particularly interested in the situation where the lowest eigenvalues in each of three wells are almost degenerate without tunneling through barriers .",
    "then , by applying the wkb method we shall remove the degeneracy by incorporating the tunneling effects .",
    "let us denote the regions bordered by the classical turning points @xmath24 as @xmath25 , and @xmath26 ( see fig.1(b ) ) .",
    "the wave functions in each regions @xmath27 are connected by the connection formula ,    @xmath28    where @xmath29 denotes a classical turning point .",
    "the wave function in the left - most region @xmath30 , is written as @xmath31 , since it does not contain a term which exponentially diverges in the region @xmath32 . by using the connection formula",
    ", we can successively connect the wave functions until @xmath33 in the right - most region as @xmath34 @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the action and tunneling integrals in each well @xmath37 and barrier @xmath38 , respectively .",
    "hereafter , wherever necessary , we use the abbreviated notation @xmath37 to indicate the wells @xmath39 , and @xmath26 , respectively .",
    "since @xmath33 in the right - most well should not contain a term , @xmath40 , connecting to the term which exponentially diverges in the region @xmath41 , we obtain the following relation as @xcite @xmath42 due to the small transparency of each barrier , actions are approximately quantized as @xmath43 and one sees @xmath44 since our interest lies in the low - lying energy levels , we consider the case @xmath45 . in this case , for low - lying eigenvalue @xmath46 , action is evaluated as @xmath47 and substituting ( [ cot ] ) into ( [ quantization ] ) , one obtains the equation in the form of cubic polynomials of eigenvalue @xmath46 ,    @xmath48    here @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 defined for each well @xmath52 imply the `` vacuum energy '' , ( approximate ) potential minimum and the frequency , respectively .",
    "the precise solutions of eq.([energy ] ) constitute the lowest three eigenvalues with the lowest one being the ground state energy @xmath16 . to reach the goal",
    ", the evaluation of tunneling integrals for each well is necessary . in the problem under consideration",
    ", the potential is assumed symmetric and thus @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 .",
    "the tunneling integrals are perturbatively estimated with use of small parameter @xmath12 .",
    "the classical turning points gives the interval @xmath56 $ ] on which the tunnel integration is performed .",
    "as shown in figs.1 and 2 , the interval contains only one local maximum at @xmath57 of the original potential @xmath58 . in this case",
    "the tunnel integral is calculated as follows : we divide the integral @xmath59 into three parts and perform the integration as @xmath60 we choose @xmath61 so that the above - used taylor expansions , @xmath62 are possible .",
    "equation ( [ energy ] ) is solved as follows : when the barrier heights are large enough , the terms including the exponentially - small tunneling factors are negligible on the left - hand side of ( [ energy ] ) , giving a set of the lowest eigenvalues at each of separate wells , @xmath63 and @xmath64 . when the effect of the small transparency due to tunneling will be incorporated",
    ", these three levels show a splitting and shifts ( see figs . [ levelsplit ] and [ levelsplit2 ] ) .    in such a case one can as yet suppress the fourth term on the left - hand side of ( [ energy ] ) , which is a product of two tunneling terms and is almost vanishing , and one obtains the exact eigenvalues : @xmath65 where @xmath66 stands for @xmath16 .",
    "the decay rate is given as the difference of two low - lying eigenvalues , @xmath67 .",
    "depending on the depth of the middle well of @xmath21 , there are two typical cases , + case ( a ) : @xmath68 ; + case ( b ) : @xmath69 . +    the cases ( a ) and ( b ) corresponds to deep and shallow middle wells , respectively . the energy splitting and shifts in each of these cases are illustrated in figs .",
    "[ levelsplit ] and [ levelsplit2 ] .",
    "our principal interest lies in the case ( a ) that the unperturbed three levels without tunneling terms are almost degenerate . in this case",
    "the first term in the square root in eq.([exact - sol ] ) is negligible and the decay rate is dominated by the tunneling term as    @xmath70    with the turning points @xmath71 and the maximum point @xmath72 in the tunneling integration .    using the harmonic approximation @xmath73 for the curvature of each well of @xmath21 , (",
    "[ tunnel - a ] ) is rewritten in the lowest order of @xmath12 as @xmath74 where @xmath75 and @xmath76 are the height of potential barriers at the top measured from the bottom of the left - most well and from the bottom of the middle cave , respectively . @xmath77 and @xmath78 are the curvatures at the cave , at the barrier top and at the the bottom of the left - most well , respectively .",
    "these quantities are illustrated in fig.[meaning ] . in deriving ( [ wkb ] ) from ( [ tunnel - a ] ) we used the expressions valid in the lowest order of @xmath12 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "the result in eq.([wkb ] ) is a doubly - humped - barrier counterpart of the kramers escape rate for a single barrier , since _ the potential - barrier height and the curvatures of a well in kramers rate are replaced by the arithmetic mean of higher(or outer ) and lower(or inner ) partial barriers ( @xmath83 and @xmath84 ) and the geometric mean of curvatures of the initial and intermediate wells ( @xmath78 and @xmath85 ) , respectively _",
    "( see fig.[meaning ] ) .",
    "the result in eq.([wkb ] ) can not be obtained within the standard framework of the mean - first - passage time problem .",
    "on the other hand , in the case ( b ) , one can taylor - expand the formula in eq.([exact - sol ] ) in the small tunneling term , finding @xmath86 . in this case",
    "the decay rate is given by @xmath87 although in the case of a shallow middle well the difference of harmonic energy levels can not be written in terms of original potential , the activation energy , @xmath88 with @xmath89 is nearly equal to the barrier height at the barrier top measured from the bottom of the left - most well and the conventional kramers escape rate is recovered . as is proved in appendix , the result in eq.([kramers ] ) can be confirmed by alternatively solving the corresponding rate within the standard framework of the mean - first - passage time problem .",
    "we proceed to investigate the possibility of enhancement of nucleation process due to the existence of an intermediate state on the basis of the low - temperature formula for the doubly - humped barrier version of kramers rate .    in the case of a symmetric double - well potential in fig.[figg6 ] , @xmath90 , the decay rate",
    "is calculated @xcite in the same way as in the previous section and is given by @xmath91 with a potential barrier @xmath92 ( see fig.[figg6 ] ) .",
    "we note that a faster decay due to the existence of an intermediate state is guaranteed under the following conditions : + ( i ) the boltzmann factor for a doubly - humped barriers is larger than that for a single barrier ; + ( ii ) provided that two kind of boltzmann factors are identical , the pre - exponential factor for a doubly - humped barriers is larger than that for a single barrier .",
    "+    the condition ( i ) implies that the mean barrier height @xmath93 for triple wells is less than the single - barrier height for the double - well @xmath94 . to be explicit ,",
    "the condition ( i ) is given by @xmath95    on the other hand , in the case ( ii ) the quasi - equality @xmath96 leads to @xmath97 namely , @xmath98 is almost a function of @xmath99 and @xmath100 . for the pre - exponential factors to satisfy @xmath101 , we have @xmath102 equations ( [ quasi - eq ] ) and ( [ pr - exp ] ) satisfy the condition ( ii ) .    in the same way ,",
    "enhancement of the nucleation due to the intermediate state is also expected in the case of the sixth - order double - well landau potential , @xmath103 .",
    "for instance , the condition ( i ) is now given by @xmath104",
    "to verify the results in the previous sections , we shall investigate the decay rate numerically by calculating the second - lowest eigenvalue of the associated schrdinger operator @xmath105 in eq.([assosch ] ) @xcite . by using the eigenvectors of the harmonic oscillator together with the annihilation - creation operator representation of @xmath106 and @xmath107 ,",
    "@xmath108 is diagonalized straightforwardly @xcite . for the system with a triple - well potential ,",
    "the decay rate is obtained numerically in the parameter range @xmath109 , @xmath110 , which is compared with the formula in eq.([wkb ] ) in the case of a deep middle well ( fig.7 ) . in fig.7(a ) , there certainly exists a coincidence region where the decay rates @xmath20 in both the numerical and analytical results ( eq.([wkb ] ) ) coincides ( see fig.7(a ) ) .",
    "the best agreement can be seen along the coincidence line . in the vicinity of the coincidence region ,",
    "the curvatures of the left - most and the middle wells are almost the same in the original landau potential @xmath22 , and the harmonic levels for each of three wells in the effective potential @xmath21 are almost degenerate , satisfying the condition for the case ( a ) below eq.([exact - sol ] ) .",
    "thus one can see the doubly - humped barrier counterpart of kramers formula to be justified near the coincidence line ( see fig.7(b ) ) in the present context .",
    "in the case of a shallow central well lying far from this coincidence region , the degeneracy condition is no longer satisfied . at @xmath111 , for instance , the middle cave is astonishingly shallow . here , instead of eq.([wkb ] ) , the formula in eq.([kramers ] ) explains the numerical boltzmann factor . in appendix",
    ", we alternatively derive the doubly - humped barrier counterpart of kramers rate as the inverse of the first passage time . due to the saddle point approximation",
    ", however , this method is valid only in the case of a shallow central well .",
    "with use of the wkb method , we have analyzed the homogeneous nucleation phenomenon in systems with an intermediate state , and obtained the decay rate for the thermal diffusion over a doubly - humped barrier .",
    "the analytic result is applicable for a wide range of depth and curvature of the intermediate middle well . in the case of a deep middle",
    "well , in particular , the decay rate becomes a doubly - humped - barrier version of the kramers escape rate : the barrier height and curvature of the initial well in the kramers rate are now replaced by the arithmetic mean of higher(or outer ) and lower(or inner ) partial barriers and the geometric mean of curvatures of the initial and intermediate wells , respectively .",
    "we have confirmed the presence of the coincidence region ( almost a narrow strip ) in the parameter space for the landau potential where this universal formula holds well , and also revealed the condition for the intermediate state to enhance the nucleation rate . in the case of a shallow middle cave far from the coincidence parameter region , however , we find a less - essential modification of the kramers rate , which is also verified by an alternative study based on the standard framework of the mean - first - passage time problem .",
