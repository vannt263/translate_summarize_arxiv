    "one of the implications from the data collected by the iras mission , combined with extensive radio surveys , is a nearly universal and tight correlation between the far - infrared thermal dust emission and the optically - thin total radio continuum emission ( mixing thermal and synchrotron components ) in normal star - forming galaxies . @xcite",
    "have reached this conclusion comparing 60@xmath1 m fluxes with 6.3 cm fluxes from the effelsberg dish , @xcite comparing 40120@xmath1 m fluxes with 21 cm fluxes from westerbork .",
    "although the correlation is generally expressed between luminosities , it holds when they are normalized to cancel size and distance effects , and is valid for a very broad range of star formation rate densities ( review by @xcite ) . at centimeter wavelengths ,",
    "the radio emission is dominated by non - thermal processes .",
    "all models accounting for the constancy of the infrared to radio flux ratios invoke the star formation process as the indirect source of both types of emission , via a production rate of cosmic rays by type - ii supernov  proportional to the production rate of heating photons .",
    "additional coupling mechanisms are needed , such as between the interstellar medium density and the magnetic field intensity @xcite , or between the star formation rate and the magnetic field amplification @xcite .",
    "various physical mechanisms can lead to these couplings , among which differential rotation , or turbulence driven by massive star formation amplifying the magnetic field .",
    "in addition , given that the various timescales involved in the underlying mechanisms are very different ( heating of dust by massive and then intermediate - mass stars , explosion of supernov , acceleration , diffusion and decay of the relativistic electrons , variations of the magnetic field strength ) , some variation in infrared to radio flux ratios with the star formation recent history is to be expected",
    ".    there are naturally known exceptions to the general correlation .",
    "a fraction of galaxies hosting non - stellar nuclear activity have excess radio continuum emission , from cosmic rays accelerated in jets from the nucleus @xcite .",
    "star - forming galaxies in cluster environments can also have radio excess @xcite , perhaps triggered by external magnetic field compression due to the intracluster gas pressure or to interactions with neighbor galaxies .",
    "two pairs of colliding galaxies with excess synchrotron emission originating from a bridge between the disks were studied by @xcite and @xcite , to illustrate the importance to the correlation of regulated cosmic ray escape .",
    "@xcite also discovered excess synchrotron in an interacting galaxy , due to external compression of the magnetic field .",
    "some statistical studies found high far - infrared to radio ratios in compact galaxy groups @xcite and in lenticular galaxies @xcite , but may suffer from photometric errors ( confusion problem for iras fluxes in galaxy groups , as pointed out by @xcite , and extended radio emission missed by interferometric observations ) .    for dwarf galaxies",
    ", metallicity effects can lower the dust emission , and the radio spectra of many are dominated by thermal emission .",
    "@xcite found that the far - infrared to radio ratio tends to be lower in blue compact galaxies than in spirals , while @xcite found similar ratios in both .",
    "using the radio fluxes of @xcite and new iras fluxes measured with _",
    "@xcite , it seems in fact that there is a continuum of infrared to radio ratios from very low to very high values , i.e. with a much larger dispersion than in spirals , perhaps depending on two competing effects : reduction of the dust emission by metal deficiency , and reduction of the synchrotron emission by a lack of supernov  or by fast escape of cosmic rays .    variations also exist inside spiral galaxies : @xcite found higher 60@xmath1 m to 11 cm flux ratios in the central regions of large angular size spirals than in their disks , following the @xmath2 ratio , an average dust temperature indicator .",
    "this is likely because the scale length of the synchrotron emission is larger than in the infrared , due to cosmic ray propagation far from the site of their acceleration , located in star formation regions hosting hot dust @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we study three nearby galaxies ( an amorphous galaxy , an early - type spiral and a late - type spiral ) which are strongly deficient in radio emission with respect to their dust emission , trying to identify the cause of their peculiarity . in normal galaxies ,",
    "the synchrotron radiation comes mainly from electrons having left the supernova remnants which have accelerated them , and propagating in the interstellar magnetic field @xcite .",
    "a lack of synchrotron emission may thus have its origin in either an unusually low strength of the magnetic field , or a reduced supernova rate in the recent past . with non - detections in the synchrotron emission ,",
    "the magnetic field strength is extremely difficult to estimate .",
    "however , we address the star formation properties using an array of new observations , and thereby approach indirectly the issue of magnetic fields .",
    "we will argue that these galaxies have a high star formation rate associated with a low supernova rate , reflecting a starburst in a very early stage occurring after a long period of quiescence , since supernov  begin to explode a few myr after the birth of their progenitors .",
    "if this interpretation is valid , these galaxies could provide the opportunity to observe the properties of the earliest stages of a starburst , and to understand better the regulation of the galactic infrared and radio emission .",
    "although such galaxies are apparently quite rare , they may exist in greater numbers at more primitive epochs of star formation .",
    "they must therefore be taken into account when using high - redshift radio surveys to study the star formation history , and when using high - resolution radio observations to identify faint infrared or submillimeter sources .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in section  [ review ] we discuss existing data and assemble comprehensive information about ngc1377 , ic1953 and ngc4491 ; section  [ effelsberg ] presents and analyses new radio continuum observations ; in section  [ mid_ir ] we describe and exploit near - infrared spectroscopic observations , extract estimates of the star formation rate from the dust emission and discuss the excitation and apparent cooling rate of the interstellar medium ; section  [ sest ] examines results from single - dish molecular gas observations in ngc1377 ; section  [ n4418 ] is a brief discussion of some common properties of ngc4418 with the three galaxies studied above ; section  [ scenarios ] lists and discusses the various physical scenarios which could account for the observed synchrotron deficiency .",
    "these scenarios are related either to a very low cosmic ray density stemming from a low supernova rate , or to a very low magnetic field intensity ; we conclude in favor of the former , as would be expected in a nascent starburst .",
    "section  [ stat_highq ] then compares the statistics of synchrotron - deficient galaxies to those of nascent starbursts , and discusses possible triggering mechanisms .",

    "ngc1377 and ic1953 were identified as radio synchrotron - deficient galaxies among the iras bright galaxy sample mapped with the vla @xcite .",
    "ngc4491 , which is fainter , was also found to be synchrotron - deficient in a search among the small sample of @xcite , based on mid - infrared colors ( see sect .",
    "[ irsed ] ) .",
    "all three galaxies are low - mass and quite unremarkable at first sight , if it were not for their high dust temperatures .",
    "being both faint and hot in their dust emission , they are very peculiar with respect to the average local @xmath3@xmath2 function , especially ngc1377 @xcite .",
    "the average @xmath2 ratio at their infrared luminosities is only @xmath4 , and they deviate from this by about @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "although ic1953 seems to have a very close companion ( fig .  [ images ] ) , this galaxy is at much higher redshift ( see section  [ envir ] ) .",
    "ngc1377 is classified as a lenticular or amorphous galaxy , and does not present any apparent disturbance .",
    "its only peculiarity , noted by @xcite , is a central dust lane along the southern part of the minor axis , visible in the b - band isophotes .",
    "ngc4491 is a barred dwarf sa galaxy @xcite whose shape is also regular , with a tenuous outer disk .",
    "ic1953 is a strongly barred sd galaxy ( the bar is short but straight and narrow , connecting at right angles to the spiral arms ) .",
    "it has an unsually bright and well - defined core for its late type ( very prominent in the mid - infrared dust emission ) .",
    "one of the arms winds to join the opposite end of the bar , and the other arm , winding for more than 360 , offers the aspect of three distinct branches .",
    "the mid - infrared emission of ngc1377 and ngc4491 , in the isocam maps at 7@xmath1 m and 15@xmath1 m , is dominated by the central regions , of apparent sizes respectively about 2.3kpc and 800pc , and the dust emission of ic1953 is also more concentrated ( in a 1.5kpc region ) than in other galaxies of its late - type morphology ( fig .",
    "[ images ] ) . decomposing the surface brightness profile of ngc1377 at 7@xmath1 m",
    ", we find an unresolved source ( at the resolution of isocam , with a point spread function of @xmath7 ) contributing about 60% of the total flux or more .",
    "for ngc4491 , the central region is also unresolved in the mid - infrared , and superimposed onto a very diffuse component .",
    "the 7@xmath1 m brightness profile decomposition yields a point source accounting for about 65% of the flux of the infrared core , and 38% of the total flux .",
    "an unresolved source is also seen in the 7@xmath1 m brightness profile of ic1953 , containing about 65% of the flux of the circumnuclear regions .",
    "ngc1377 and ic1953 are both members of the eridanus galaxy group . according to @xcite ,",
    "this is a small group ( 54 members brighter than @xmath8 ) in a young dynamical state , since it has an irregular and subclustered aspect , is rich in spiral galaxies , and forms with the fornax cluster a bound system which is not yet virialized . in the soft x - ray maps of @xcite ( 0.10.9kev ) , eridanus is not detected .",
    "ngc1377 and ic1953 do not belong to any subcondensation , but to the same loose sub - group lying in projection in the center , and are close to each other both spatially and in radial velocity .",
    "ngc4491 seems also to be part of a dynamically young system , the core named group a in the virgo cluster , containing m87 and 100 to 300 members , and which is described by @xcite as a `` turbulent core with a long tail of low velocities '' .",
    "ngc4491 belongs to this tail , with a large velocity with respect to the systemic velocity of @xmath9kms@xmath10 .",
    "none of the three galaxies shows any morphological disturbance , but they have likely interacted with the ambiant medium , since they are deficient in atomic gas .",
    "we did not find any published hi mass measurement for ngc1377 , but a spectrum from the hipass survey , conducted with the parkes telescope @xcite .",
    "this spectrum has a sensitivity of about 10mjy per spectral channel , and implies that m(hi@xmath11m@xmath12 .",
    "compared with the s0/a - sab galaxies in @xcite , the logarithmic hi deficiency of ngc1377 , normalized by the dispersion in the field reference sample , is higher than 1.0 .",
    "this value is @xmath13 for ic1953 and @xmath14 for ngc4491 @xcite , and a galaxy can be considered hi - deficient when @xmath15 .",
    "ic1953 has two small - mass neighbors , eso548-g040 , a very low - surface brightness galaxy at about 2.6 arcmin in projected distance to the nw , and eso548-g036 , at about 6 arcmin to the se .",
    "eso548-g040 has a much higher receding velocity ( 4061kms@xmath10 ) than the members of the eridanus group ( @xmath16kms@xmath10 ) , and is therefore most likely a background galaxy . on the contrary",
    ", the velocity of eso548-g036 ( 1480kms@xmath10 ) identifies it as a true neighbor of ic1953 , with a velocity difference of 400kms@xmath10 and a physical distance @xmath17kpc .",
    "it is thus tempting to consider eso548-g036 a candidate for tidal interaction with ic1953 , which could be responsible for the peculiar arm structure of ic1953 .",
    "the closest neighbor to ngc4491 is the blue compact dwarf ic3446 at 6.3 arcmin to the w , and the closest galaxy of comparable mass is ngc4497 , at about 12 arcmin to the nw .",
    "their velocities are 760 and 610kms@xmath10 larger than that of ngc4491 .      in order to build a reference for far - infrared to radio flux ratios , obtained with homogeneous iras and vla data , we chose the sample of 69 nearby spiral galaxies studied by @xcite , with mid - infrared and other data already at hand , and which comprises two of the three galaxies examined here , ngc4491 and ic1953 .",
    "we measured iras fluxes using the _ scanpi _ tool @xcite with default parameters . only for ngc4491 at 100@xmath1 m was the baseline fitted over a 30  range replaced by a baseline fitted over the central 14  only , where it is reasonably flat .",
    "given the brightness of the three target galaxies , we used as a flux estimator for them the template amplitude , except for ic1953 which is slightly extended at 25 and 60@xmath1 m ( we used the flux integration of the scan between the first zero crossings ) .",
    "radio continuum fluxes or upper limits at 21 cm were measured from nvss maps @xcite , with a beam fwhm of 45  and a detection limit of the order of 1mjy .",
    "we obtain an upper limit for ngc1377 which is equal to that given by the more sensitive survey of @xcite in a 21-beam .",
    "@xcite defined a logarithmic ratio of far - infrared to radio flux densities as : + @xmath18 $ ] , where all flux densities , @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21(21 cm ) , are expressed in the same unit . in the reference sample , excluding radio upper and lower limits , we find an average ratio @xmath22 .",
    "the dispersion is the same as that obtained by @xcite for the iras bright galaxy sample .",

    "five galaxies turn out to have far - infrared to radio flux ratios @xmath23 : ngc1377 ( @xmath24 ) , ngc4491 ( @xmath25 ) and ic1953 ( @xmath26 ) , with far - infrared to blue luminosity ratios higher than 1.5 ; ngc4580 ( @xmath27 ) and ngc4394 ( @xmath26 ) , two virgo galaxies having @xmath28 . the latter two",
    "are most clearly separated from the first three by their average dust temperature ( fig .",
    "[ q_temp ] ) : they have @xmath2 of respectively 0.26 and 0.23 , and also low mid - infrared colors @xmath29 of 0.9 to 1 , whereas ngc4491 and ic1953 have @xmath30 , and the flux density spectrum of ngc1377 peaks at 60@xmath1 m .    the lack of radio synchrotron emission can be accounted for easily in the cool - dust galaxies .",
    "if their star formation rate is presently very low , as indicated by their dust emission properties ( low colors and low surface brightnesses ) , then the far - infrared - emitting dust can be expected to be heated mainly by low - mass stars , well in excess of the emission produced by the star formation activity .",
    "after the production of cosmic rays has ceased , the timescale for synchrotron emission decay is less than @xmath31years @xcite , so that the @xmath32 ratio should increase on this timescale after an exhaustion of the star formation .",
    "the whole disk of ngc4394 is extremely diffuse in h@xmath33 @xcite and in the mid - infrared as well @xcite .",
    "this is true also of ngc4580 outside its inner pseudo - ring .",
    "however , the high @xmath2 ratios of ngc1377 , ngc4491 and ic1953 exclude such an explanation for their lack of synchrotron emission .    the correlation between far - infrared and radio continuum luminosities",
    "is known to be non - linear , the radio emission rising faster or decreasing faster than the dust emission @xcite .",
    "faint galaxies such as those studied here are thus expected to have higher @xmath32 ratios than brighter galaxies .",
    "however , @xcite found evidence of a small decrease of @xmath34(20 cm ) when the average dust temperature @xmath2 rises , along with an increase of the radio brightness temperature . to linearize and tighten the relationship between infrared and radio fluxes , @xcite apply an empirical correction which assumes that the radio emission is a good measure of the star formation rate , and decreases the @xmath32 ratio in proportion to @xmath35(20 cm ) , the blue to radio flux ratio .",
    "although they find that variations in @xmath2 can not account for the dispersion in @xmath32 , @xmath2 is correlated with @xmath36 , and the trend of decreasing @xmath32 with increasing @xmath2 exists in our sample also ( particularly illustrated in fig .",
    "[ q_temp ] by the behavior of ngc4580 and ngc4394 ) .",
    "ngc1377 , ngc4491 and ic1953 manifestly break this trend .",
    "if we apply the correction of @xcite to our data , as shown in fig .",
    "[ q_qb ] , then the peculiarity of ngc1377 , ngc4491 and ic1953 with respect to the other galaxies is not destroyed : they still lie at @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 above the new mean @xmath40 .",
    "the only other galaxy having @xmath41 is ngc1022 ( @xmath42 ) , an amorphous starburst with @xmath43 .",
    "we note that the correction proposed by @xcite , based on the blue to infrared luminosity ratio , can not be appropriate , since @xmath32 as a function of @xmath44 shows no defined trend .",
    "the high @xmath2 and low @xmath45 ratios signal the existence of a dust component with high temperatures and thus high heating intensities , which could be due to an extensive star formation burst or non - stellar activity , or both @xcite . in this respect , the spectral indices between 25 and 60@xmath1 m of ngc1377 and ngc4491 , -1.5 and -2.1 , are ambiguous @xcite .",
    "the broadband spectral energy distributions of the three galaxies are shown in fig .",
    "j , h and ks - band fluxes are derived from images built for the 2mass large galaxy atlas @xcite , with a preliminary photometric calibration valid for the cit system .",
    "the u , v and i - band fluxes of ngc1377 come from the colors given by @xcite .",
    "other optical data were found in the ned database .",
    "we measured the 45@xmath1 m fluxes of ngc1377 and ic1953 in isocam maps .",
    "it appears that the dust emission spectrum of ngc1377 can not be reproduced by any empirical sed of @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ sed ] ) , ajusted to a sample of normal galaxies , and parametrized by the @xmath2 ratio ( note however that the color bin of ngc1377 comprises only two galaxies ) .",
    "the emission from transiently - heated dust particles , from 7 to 25@xmath1 m , is well in excess of what is expected for the large grain temperature ( as estimated by the @xmath2 ratio ) , by up to 8@xmath46 .",
    "@xmath47 is expected to decrease steadily with rising dust temperature , and then starts to increase again at the highest @xmath2 ratios , but ngc1377 overdevelops this trend ( fig .",
    "[ mirsfir ] ) . for @xmath48 , which in normal galaxies shows less dispersion than @xmath49 , the same remark applies .",
    "the mid - infrared spectral shape between 2.5 and 11@xmath1 m , observed with isophot in @xmath50  @xcite , is quite unusual : instead of the typical spectrum of aromatic bands observed in most star - forming galaxies @xcite , a broad asymmetric feature between 6 and 8.5@xmath1 m contributes the bulk of the emission .",
    "this is reminiscent of some ultraluminous galaxies @xcite .",
    "such a broad feature , accompanied by very weak 6.2 and 11.3@xmath1 m bands , is also observed in the peak e of the smc hii region n66 by @xcite , in proto - planetary nebul@xcite , and bears some resemblance with the signature of anthracite , used by @xcite to reproduce proto - planetary nebula spectra .",
    "all this suggests that the aromatic band carriers have not been processed in the same way as in normal star - forming galaxies , and that the dust responsible for the emission is subjected to hard radiation .",
    "since it contributes the same part in the infrared energy budget as in quiescent galaxies , this dust must be more resilient in order not to be destroyed .",
    "the abrupt fall - off of the spectrum from 9 to 11@xmath1 m further suggests that the absorption by silicates may be substantial , but such an interpretation is very hazardous , because optically - thin spectra of normal galaxies also have a minimum in this region .",
    "dust heating can not be provided by a shock , in particular because one would then observe either a prominent silicate emission feature , or a negligible mid - infrared emission with respect to the far - infrared emission , depending on the gas density @xcite .",
    "@xcite , on the basis of this spectrum , propose that ngc1377 contains a buried seyfert nucleus . however , several arguments suggest otherwise : + * 1 ) * the continuum emission at 34@xmath1 m and 911@xmath1 m is near zero , contrary to what is observed in seyfert nuclei . the short - wavelength continuum , in particular , which is not affected as much by extinction , is now routinely used as a diagnostic of the contribution of an active nucleus to the energy budget @xcite . among the sample of @xcite ,",
    "the spectrum of ngc1377 resembles much more that of iras02530 + 0211 , a galaxy of starburst type , than that of any of the seyfert galaxies .",
    "one could argue that the broad feature seen between 6 and 8.5@xmath1 m is similar to that seen in centaurusa @xcite , and is produced by a continuum strongly absorbed longward of 8@xmath1 m by silicates ; however , the similarity is superficial , since the spectra of centaurusa and other seyfert nuclei rise steeply longward of 10@xmath1 m and are brighter at 11.5@xmath1 m than at 8@xmath1 m , whereas the 11.5@xmath1 m flux of ngc1377 is near zero .",
    "this is a strong argument against pure silicate absorption , because the red wing of the absorption band would otherwise be exceptionally wide . trying a quantitative fit of the 8@xmath1 m to 100@xmath1 m data , with the extinction law of @xcite (",
    "some variants exist , but introduce differences essentially shortward of 8@xmath1 m , which is why we exclude short wavelengths ) , @xmath51 is required in order to reproduce the 810@xmath1 m isophot spectrum with an absorbed dust continuum , but no good fit can be performed : the solution is too high in the 1011.5@xmath1 m range ; one can obtain a simultaneous fit of the 12@xmath1 m , 25@xmath1 m , 60@xmath1 m and 100@xmath1 m data with the sum of two blackbodies of 370k and 100k , but the fit at 15@xmath1 m is then much higher than the observed flux , which is impossible to fix by adding a new dust component . we thus conclude that the broad feature between 6 and 8.5@xmath1 m may contain a genuine emission band , and may not be exclusively caused by absorption is adopted , then the emission of hot small grains up to @xmath52@xmath1 m would have to be boosted by a factor five to obtain the intrinsic small grain luminosity . since the complementary power observed in the far - infrared is only 1.2 times the observed power of small grains , at least @xmath53 would have to be re - emitted at longer wavelengths , in the submillimeter , which is inconceivable . and this would only exacerbate the difficulty to account for the dust luminosity of ngc1377 in the total absence of activity in the radio window ( this will be developed in sect .",

    "a high central absorption could flatten the profiles , but this is unlikely , because 2mass data indicate that the j - h and h - k colors of the central 10  are not different from the global colors within the error bars .",
    "h - k is relatively `` blue '' compared to the other galaxies in @xcite , and j - k is very blue compared to the ultraluminous galaxies in @xcite ( like the bluest starbursts and liners ) , or to the 2mass extended sources brighter than @xmath56 @xcite . the power emitted by dust between 4.5 and 100@xmath1 m is only 1.8 times the total stellar power between 3600  and 4.5@xmath1 m , and about twice more considering the center alone .",
    "this means that the luminosity - weighted extinction can not be high enough to hide a deep stellar potential well .",

    "x - ray data would be useful to rule out seyfert activity , but to our knowledge , none exist for ngc1377 .",
    "the 7 to 25@xmath1 m emission of ngc4491 is somewhat in excess of the corresponding sed of @xcite , but not significantly .",
    "the blue - band surface brightness profile of @xcite is exponential , with no central peak , and so are the near - infrared profiles .",

    "since the disk infrared emission in ic1953 is significant , and well resolved in isocam maps , we decomposed the spectral energy distribution into a disk component and a circumnuclear region ( cnr ) component , which we identify to the core with a high @xmath29 ratio . to do this , we estimated typical disk infrared colors using the isocam and iras fluxes of ngc4027 @xcite , which has high signal to noise ratios and whose entire body can be assimilated to a disk : @xmath58 ( the small 7@xmath1 m excess in the disk of ic1953 being ascribed to stellar emission ) , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "the result , shown in fig .",
    "[ sed]d , outlines the fact that part of the peculiarity of ic1953 is hidden by normal disk properties : the center has hotter dust and higher infrared to optical ratios than the galaxy as a whole .",
    "the radio deficiency is likely more severe in the center ; using the radio measurement of @xcite inside 21  and the above decomposition , we obtain @xmath63 .    the position of a galaxy in a mid - infrared surface brightness  color diagram ( @xmath64(15@xmath1 m ) versus @xmath29 ) can give some sense of the relative contribution of stellar populations of different ages , on a timescale of several @xmath31 years , in the dust heating @xcite .",

    "if indeed a larger fraction than usual of the ionizing photons are absorbed by dust in ngc1377 , then this will have the simultaneous effect of decreasing the free - free emission and enhancing the infrared emission , with respect to a normal galaxy with the same star formation rate .",
    "thermal opacity is an alternative explanation for the non - detection of the free - free emission . the upper limit at 3.55 cm however places very stringent a constraint in this case : with @xmath73mjy , the effective opacity is @xmath74(3.6@xmath75 , or @xmath74(21@xmath76 .",
    "assuming a simple geometry and uniform electronic density , such a value would imply that the scale of the emitting region be less than 28pc , and the electronic density higher than 2700@xmath77 .",
    "since this is unrealistic , the free - free opacity explanation is dismissed .    assuming a normal initial mass function and no dust emission excess , the starburst must have produced approximately @xmath78 o stars ( see section  [ sfrate ] ) .",

    "the size of the starburst region is rather of the order of 100pc ( 1 ) or larger .",
    "the emission region may thus be truly more extended than the vla a - configuration beam . to trigger star",
    "formation quasi - instantaneously over such a scale perhaps needs a merger with a satellite galaxy , which does not necessarily produce morphological disturbances , but should be visible in the gas kinematics .    the dust mass required to produce the observed far - infrared emission is @xmath79m@xmath12 , according to the dust emissivity derived by @xcite for the galaxy , with @xmath80k ( which produces an emission excess from small dust grains of 76% at 25@xmath1 m ) .",
    "using instead a blackbody fit , only @xmath81m@xmath12 of dust are needed . assuming that the gas to dust mass ratio is similar to the galactic value of @xmath0 @xcite , the gas mass associated with the starburst in ngc1377 is then of the order of @xmath82 to @xmath83m@xmath12 , which represents much less than 10% of the observed stellar mass in the whole central region .",

    "it is consistent with normal free - free emission provided that about 65% of the flux comes from a region larger than 0.3 , i.e. 30pc , which is very likely , since the lower limit on the size of the starburst , obtained for a blackbody of 70k matched to the cnr far - infrared emission , is 46pc .      only for ngc4491",
    "does a flux measurement at another radio wavelength exist .",
    "@xcite measured @xmath21(2.8@xmath93mjy , with the effelsberg telescope , in a 69-beam .",
    "since the observed flux density at 3.6 cm in ngc4491 ( @xmath94mjy ) , confirming the measurement of @xcite at 2.8 cm , is in good agreement with what is expected from the spectra of normal galaxies ( 4.9mjy for a non - thermal index of -0.75 between 3.6 cm and 21 cm ) , and the free - free emission can contribute only of the order of 20% of the total emission at this wavelength , we have evidence that ngc4491 produces synchrotron emission .",

    "ngc4491 was not detected either in the ( much less sensitive ) 12.6 cm survey of @xcite .",
    "source confusion could be responsible for this inconsistency . using the 8.4ghz source counts of @xcite , which indicate @xmath96 , and a beam of 80",
    ", the probability of observing a confusing source at 3.6 cm lies between 1/360 and 1/800 .",
    "given that the radio positions at 3.6 cm and 6.2 cm are in good agreement with the optical center , as well as the position at 6.2 cm of a bright quasar seen to the sw in the nvss map , and that the observed flux coincides with the flux expected from the infrared emission , confusion is unlikely .",
    "as ngc4491 lies only 54.5  away from m87 , which emits about 220jy at 20 cm , it is possible that the nvss map does not retrieve the correct flux density of ngc4491 , due to imperfect cleaning of the beam sidelobes which can generate negative sources . to evaluate this effect , we selected a random sample of 50 nvss fields ( centered on ned extragalactic sources ) , at distances to m87 between 52.5  and 56.5 , and looked in each one for the minimum brightness .",
    "the histogram of the minima forms a smooth distribution down to -6.52mjy per beam , and two outliers at @xmath97 and -16mjy per beam .",
    "the latter are characteristically associated with a chain of other deep negative points , of amplitude scaled by about one third . since",
    "this pattern is not present in the ngc4491 map , we are confident that such a deep negative component can not be superimposed onto ngc4491 ( furthermore , it would have to coincide accurately with the galaxy s position , the probability of which is low ) .",
    "we thus adopt as an absolute upper limit to any missing flux density the value 6.52mjy , and we derive @xmath98mjy .",
    "we will use this limit in the following discussion , but we insist that deeper observations at 20 cm are needed to set any more significant limit .    the new infrared to radio flux ratio is only constrained to be @xmath99 .",
    "however , the spectral indices are very flat : @xmath21([3.66.2cm]@xmath100 and @xmath21([6.220cm]@xmath101 with @xmath102 .",
    "the second value is very uncertain , but the [ 3.66.2 cm ] index is more reliable . from radio continuum studies carried out at high angular resolution @xcite ,",
    "several starburst galaxies , e.g. ngc2146 , ngc4214 , ngc5253 , he2 - 10  for the most part with wolf - rayet signatures and being either irregular , amorphous , blue compact or merging dwarf galaxies  have been found to contain sources with flat or inverted radio spectra , revealing optically - thick free - free emission regions .",
    "however , we find that considering _ total _ infrared and radio fluxes , all of these galaxies have normal @xmath32 ratios ( between 2.23 and 2.67 ) . moreover , ngc4491 emitting synchrotron emission at 3.6 cm , it is much more difficult to explain the shape of its radio spectrum by free - free absorption , for the thermal electrons would have to fill a very compact distribution , and at the same time encompass the relativistic electrons . assuming nevertheless that this is the case",
    ", the effective opacity at 20 cm would have to be larger than 0.7 .",
    "@xcite found three ultraluminous galaxies with @xmath103 , which are argued to be compact starbursts in merging systems , and whose radio - quiescence is best explained by high free - free opacity .",
    "however , these very luminous objects are not comparable at all with the galaxies studied here . for two of them",
    "do stellar continuum observations exist , and their 60@xmath1 m to near - infrared power ratios are more than 20 to 40 times greater than in ngc1377 , ngc4491 and ic1953 .",
    "furthermore , the required free - free opacities are only 0.50.7 at 20 cm .",
    "thus , ngc4491 is more likely intrinsically deficient in synchrotron emission rather than opaque at 20 cm .",
    "the hypothesis of non - stellar activity powering the infrared and radio emission will be discussed in section  [ seyfert ] .",
    "another possibility is that the population of relativistic electrons is very young , so that no significant energy losses occurred yet .",
    "we address here the likelihood of such a scenario .",
    "the median spectral index of radio supernova remnants , which are the likely sites of cosmic ray acceleration , is about @xmath104 ( with a total distribution between @xmath105 and @xmath106 ) , independent of age @xcite .",
    "this is significantly flatter than the spectral index of diffuse synchrotron emission in galactic disks , @xmath106 on average @xcite .",
    "very flat indices of supernova remnants can be reproduced in diffusive shock acceleration models , when second - order fermi acceleration is also included @xcite or when backreaction on the shock due to the pressure of the relativistic particles is taken into account @xcite . since the lifetime of radio supernova remnants is short , @xmath107  years @xcite , and they normally account for a small fraction of the total synchrotron emission in a galaxy , it is unrealistic to assume that the radio continuum emission of ngc4491 be due predominantly to flat - spectrum supernova remnants .",
    "steepening of the energy spectrum is a natural effect of synchrotron and inverse compton losses , once the relativistic electrons have escaped their acceleration sites , but it gradually takes place over their whole lifetime of several @xmath87  years . cosmic - ray diffusion also contributes to steepen the radio spectrum : with a diffusion length scaling as @xmath108 for @xmath109gev @xcite , the spectral index is decreased by @xmath110 .    the flat radio spectrum of ngc4491 can therefore be explained if any old population of cosmic rays has completely decayed , and a fresh population has started building up within the last few myr .",
    "this is consistent with the observations presented in section  [ n4491_pifs ] . assuming constant spectral indices between each measurement pair , the total radio power of ngc4491 between 3.6 cm and 20 cm",
    "is of the order of 74% of the radio power expected of a normal spectrum , or less , owing to the 20 cm upper limit and to the fact that unobserved frequencies lower than 1.4ghz were not included in the computed power .",
    "it is thus conceivable that not all cosmic rays were yet released by supernova remnants and that the interstellar medium of ngc4491 is out of equilibrium ( in which case the assumption of equipartition between cosmic ray and magnetic energy densities is invalidated ) .",

    "although the 611@xmath1 m spectrum of ngc1377 reveals that the dust responsible for the emission in this range is peculiar , the star formation rate derived from @xmath153 agrees to within 3% with that derived from the total dust emission for ngc1377 ( table  [ sfr ] ) .    to further characterize the star formation activities in the central regions of ic1953 and ngc4491 , a comparison of their mid - infrared data with those of circumnuclear starbursts and merging galaxies , for which ionizing photon flux densities derived independently are available , can be instructive . using the circumnuclear regions of the galaxy sample of @xcite , the starburst galaxies m82 , ngc253 and ngc1808 , and the merging systems arp220 and ngc6240 to span a range of more than five orders of magnitude in star formation surface density , we found a well - defined relationship between the mid - infrared color and the ionizing photon flux density @xcite .",
    "7@xmath1 m fluxes show no appearance of saturation and remain valid star formation tracers up to ionizing photon flux densities as high as @xmath154s@xmath10pc@xmath135 , but decline steadily above that threshold @xcite .",
    "the colors of ic1953 and ngc4491 suggest that their star formation is more compact than in the m82 core",
    ". if this assumption is correct , this corresponds to ionizing photon flux densities above @xmath155s@xmath10m@xmath135 . combined with star formation rates derived from the total infrared emission ,",
    "upper limits on the sizes of the star - forming cores can be inferred : diameters of less than 125pc and 70pc are respectively obtained . in the blackbody assumption , we obtain lower limits of 46pc and 35pc .",
    "the derived star formation rates are only of the order of 0.32m@xmath12.yr@xmath10 . however , the three galaxies have low masses . comparing these rates with the underlying stellar mass , as traced by the ks - band light , we find that the timescale to build up an equivalent mass is only of the order of 0.52gyr in the central @xmath156  of ngc1377 , ic1953 and ngc4491 ( using @xmath157 , as found by @xcite , with ks@xmath158mag , from @xcite ) . as a comparison ,",
    "this timescale is similar for the starburst in ngc4102 ( 1.7gyr ) and much longer in the bright star - forming center of the normal spiral ngc4535 ( of the order of 10gyr ) .",
    "the star formation activity in the three galaxies can thus be truly identified with starbursts .    using the star formation rate range derived from dust emission , and comparing it with the extinguished star formation rate derived from the h@xmath33 line , we derive an absorption in h@xmath33 between 4.3 and 4.9 for the circumnuclear region of ic1953 .",
    "if the [ nii ] to h@xmath33 ratio were unusually high such as in ngc1377 , then the nebular absorption could be even higher .    for ngc4491",
    ", we have measured the star formation rate from near - infrared hydrogen recombination lines in the pifs field of view .",
    "the 7@xmath1m - emitting region may be larger than this , but the strong discrepancy between the recombination estimate and the dust estimate ( table  [ sfr ] ) points to either a major fraction of the nebular emission being completely screened , or an overestimation of the star formation rate by the infrared emission , unless photospheric absorption from a young stellar population strongly affects the hydrogen line strengths .",
    "far - infrared lines due to collisional excitation in photodissociation regions and ionized regions were observed by iso - lws with an effective beam of 78  ( lws handbook ) .",
    "this beam is much larger than the size of the infrared emission of ngc1377 and ngc4491 , but encompasses only 60% of the total 7@xmath1 m emission of ic1953 .",
    "fluxes are collected in table  [ lws ] .    the [ cii]157.7 line is the major coolant of photodissociation regions . since aromatic band carriers dominating the emission in the 7@xmath1 m bandpass are of planar structure",
    ", they are thought to be more efficient sources of photoelectric heating than three - dimensional dust grains @xcite .",

    "these values are typical of normal star - forming galaxies , and argue for near - solar metallicities , since metal - deficient galaxies will have much higher ratios @xcite .",

    "the species responsible for the 7@xmath1 m emission in ngc1377 is thus either not easily photoionized , because already highly ionized in its equilibrium state , or is heated mainly by low - energy photons , which is unlikely owing to the observed high dust temperatures in this galaxy , or is not an efficient purveyor of photoelectrons if its structure is not planar .",
    "c@xmath162 is collisionally de - excited above relatively low densities , such that the [ cii ] deficiency of ngc1377 could be due to increased density ; but [ oi]63 remains an efficient cooling agent at densities 100 times higher . since the @xmath163}/f_{\\rm fir}$ ] ratio of ngc1377 is also low compared to the values it takes in @xcite , this explanation can be ruled out .",

    "a plausible origin of the [ cii ] deficiency in ngc1377 is thus a radiation field intense enough to highly ionize the small dust particles emitting in the mid - infrared , which then can not heat the interstellar medium , and different structural properties of these particles than in normal galaxies . alternatively , since hii regions seem to be absent in ngc1377 ( sect .",

    "ngc1377 was observed in the co(1 - 0 ) and co(2 - 1 ) lines at the sest in january 2003 , during three sessions of 7h each , as part of the eso time share .",
    "important details on the observations can be found in appendix  [ app_sest ] .",
    "the measurements and results are given in table  [ tabco ] .",

    "@xcite similarly found very low co(2 - 1 ) to co(1 - 0 ) brightness ratios in starburst galaxies , that suggest that most of the emission comes from low - density and very clumpy gas @xcite , while the star - forming cores are probably hidden by their envelopes .",

    "the far - infrared to co flux ratio is about seven times higher than the average for normal galaxies , but within the broad range observed for starbursts @xcite , which is not surprising owing to the high dust temperature and emissivity in ngc1377 .",

    "the timescale to consume all the molecular gas , including the mass of helium and metals , at the current star formation rate derived from the far - infrared emission , can be estimated to only @xmath171myr .",
    "the co(1 - 0 ) line was also observed in ic1953 , ngc4491 and ngc4418 ( see below a discussion of this galaxy ) , with smaller signal to noise ratios @xcite . in all cases , the velocity profile is very narrow ( approximate fwhm of 120 , 80 and 120kms@xmath10 ) , and the direct effect of rotation invisible , which argues for a concentration of the molecular gas in a small central area .",
    "the size of the molecular disk , even if it can not be directly estimated , can be coarsely constrained by indirect arguments .",
    "if one assumes that ngc1377 must follow the same schmidt law as characterized by @xcite from normal spirals to starbursts , within the observed scatter , then the diameter of the gas disk should be ( @xmath172)pc .",
    "dynamics can be used to set an independent constraint , but one has to make the unverified assumption that the co disk is coplanar with the stellar disk , which could be false if the gas was accreted from another galaxy .",
    "the maximum velocity , corrected for inclination , is about 90kms@xmath10 . in case",
    "the gas is decoupled from stars ( i.e. the stars are distributed in a much more extended structure with a significant plane - perpendicular scale height ) , the diameter is about 330pc .",
    "if the gas is confined within this region , then it accounts for a large fraction of the total enclosed mass : at least a quarter , estimating the stellar mass from the ks image .",
    "we now compute the toomre parameter for local gravitational stability , @xmath173 @xcite , in the same manner as usually done for galactic centers , i.e. assuming a gas density @xmath174 equal to the average , and the epicyclic angular velocity @xmath175 in the linear part of the rotation curve .",
    "the sound speed @xmath176 is chosen of the order of 10kms@xmath10 , and the diameter 4  ( 400pc ) . in these conditions , @xmath177 , which means that the gas is locally very unstable .",
    "we neglected stars , although they influence the gas stability , but they are expected to only decrease it @xcite .",
    "the parameters entering @xmath178 are all ill - constrained , and there is no guarantee that the gas is distributed in a thin disk , but if it is the case , since values close to unity are routinely found in the literature ( indicating gravitational stability allowing the mild growth of perturbations ) , it is at least likely that the molecular gas disk of ngc1377 be overcritical .",
    "this would explain the instantaneous trigger of a starburst throughout @xmath0pc .",
    "sound evidence clearly requires more detailed data , difficult to obtain owing to the low brightness of ngc1377 .    finally , the co flux can be coupled with the h@xmath116 line measurements described in section  [ n1377_pifs ] , to estimate the mass fraction of hot molecular gas .",
    "the h@xmath116(1 - 0)s(0 ) upper limit does not bring any useful constraint , but the lower limit on the h@xmath116(1 - 0)s(1 ) / h@xmath116(2 - 1)s(1 ) flux ratio implies temperatures below 1500k . with standard assumptions ( due to lack of constraints by the observations ) ,",

    "@xcite show that its mid - infrared spectrum presents a broad feature similar to that observed in ngc1377 , but with strong ice absorption bands superposed , which are almost never observed .",

    "ngc4418 is also deficient in [ cii ] , but @xmath159}/f_7 $ ] is only constrained to be more than @xmath185 below the average ratio in @xcite .",
    "there are two other major differences with respect to ngc1377 : ngc4418 has much lower mid - infrared to far - infrared flux ratios , in agreement with the predictions from its high dust temperature , and a very compact radio source is detected at its nucleus , with a brightness temperature of @xmath186@xmath187k both at 2.3ghz inside 0.1  @xcite and at 1.49ghz inside @xmath188 @xcite .",
    "ngc4418 is not detected in x - rays @xcite .",
    "although the compactness and extreme extinction in ngc4418 suggest the presence of a seyfert nucleus , a highly compact starburst is also plausible , and the nuclear 2.2@xmath1 m emission is shown to be more extended than the psf by @xcite .",
    "the 3.55 cm radio continuum , observed with the vla in a @xmath68  ( j.j .",
    "condon , unpublished ) confirms that the radio source is extended , with a size of @xmath189 .    during our radio continuum observations of ngc1377 ,",
    "ngc4491 and ic1953 at effelsberg , we also mapped ngc4418 ( fig .",
    "[ sed_radio ] ) .",
    "we measured ( @xmath190)mjy at 6.2 cm and ( @xmath191)mjy at 3.6 cm ( the beam including the source located 1.25  eastward ) .",
    "combined with the nvss flux at 21 cm , ( @xmath192mjy ( with the contaminating eastward source added to ngc4418 ) , this indicates a pronounced spectral bend from a steep index at high frequencies ( @xmath193 } \\propto \\nu^{-0.94}$ ] ) to a flat index at low frequencies ( @xmath194 } \\propto \\nu^{-0.30}$ ] ) .",
    "the implied high free - free opacity is consistent with the high extinction and compactness of ngc4418 .",
    "we find that the combined effect of both thermal opacity and a reduction of the intrinsic synchrotron emission ( with respect to the level expected from the far - infrared emission ) provides the best fit to the spectrum .",
    "the lowest possible opacity and most reasonable non - thermal spectral index , @xmath74(21@xmath195 and @xmath196 , are obtained for an intrinsic deficit of synchrotron emission of about 50% .",
    "diminishing the synchrotron deficit in the model causes the opacity to rise and the spectral index to become steeper ; assuming no deficit , @xmath74(21 cm ) would have to be as high as 1.6 and @xmath197 as low as -1.57 .",
    "condon obtained with the vla - a a higher flux at 3.6 cm : 27.4mjy , including the contaminating eastward source . using this measurement instead of the single - dish flux ,",
    "we obtain a maximum opacity @xmath74(21@xmath198 , the steepest possible non - thermal spectral index is @xmath199 , and in such conditions , the intrinsic synchrotron emission is reduced by 70% with respect to a galaxy with normal @xmath32 ratio .    based on this new result , and on the other existing evidence , we argue that the infrared emission of ngc4418 originates from a very young and compact starburst .",
    "seyfert activity is not necessary to explain the data .",
    "the emission line properties of ngc4418 are also strikingly similar to those of ngc1377 .",
    "it was observed with the pifs spectrograph by @xcite , who detected neither pa@xmath113 , br@xmath114 nor [ feii]1.644 , but a clear h@xmath116(1 - 0)s(1 ) line .",
    "this fact strengthens the similarity between the two galaxies , and suggests a common excitation mechanism ; since ngc4418 is a synchrotron source , though , it must have reached a later evolutionary stage than ngc1377 , and is possibly a composite source containing both a nascent starburst and a more evolved component .",
    "we now discuss plausible physical scenarios to account for the high infrared to radio ratios of the three galaxies we have studied .",
    "if they are due to a deficit of radio emission , then the primary possibility is a lack of cosmic rays , which would follow either from a nascent starburst or from an initial mass function biased towards low - mass stars ; the alternative is a very weak magnetic field .",
    "if the radio emission is not depressed , then it might be absorbed , pointing to optically - thick 20 cm emission .",
    "finally , we discuss the possibility of non - stellar activity providing dust heating but remaining radio - quiet .",
    "the hypothesis that we favor to explain the infrared activity and the radio deficiency of ngc1377 , ngc4491 and ic1953 is the onset of a star formation burst in their centers . in this view",
    ", the synchrotron weakness derives from a lack of relativistic electrons , which can happen if the previous major star formation episode occurred more than @xmath200 years ago , and the current episode started less than a few ( 1 to 7 ) myr before the epoch of observation . in ngc1377 and the central region of ic1953 ,",
    "no synchrotron component is detected , which implies in this scenario that no or very few supernov  have yet been produced . in ngc4491 ,",
    "the synchrotron component does exist but has a much flatter than usual spectral index .",
    "we interpret this as due to an energy distribution of cosmic rays inflated with high energies , rather than the effect of free - free opacity ; the number of relativistic electrons released by supernov  is significant , but may still be rising , and the near - infrared spectroscopic results indicate that shocks are weaker than expected from a steady - state situation .",
    "other observations consistent with this scenario are : the high dust temperatures , indicating starburst - like radiation intensities ; the extreme @xmath29 flux ratios of ngc4491 and ic1953 , suggesting that very young stellar populations are dominating the dust heating ; the mid - infrared spectrum of ngc1377 , which suggests that dust nanoparticles have not been processed into classical aromatic components radiating in normal star - forming galaxies .",
    "since the mass spectrum of stars able to heat the dust extends to much lower values than that of stars producing supernov , high infrared to radio flux ratios could be achieved if the initial mass function had a very steep slope , making high - mass stars rarer than in normal galaxies . in this hypothesis",
    ", the extreme dust temperatures would however require extreme stellar densities . to be compatible with the 21 cm upper limit of ngc1377",
    ", the cutoff of a truncated salpeter imf would have to be less than @xmath201 , since supernov  have to be totally suppressed .",
    "however , according to the model of @xcite , the @xmath2 ratio of ngc1377 implies an average radiation field about 400 times higher than the solar neighborhood field throughout the dust emission region . reaching this radiation field with only @xmath202 stars is impossible to reconcile with the data , as we will show with a simplistic model assuming a uniform stellar distribution .",
    "the ks - band image gives us a constraint on the stellar mass density .",
    "the h@xmath203[nii ] map of @xcite , of better resolution than the infrared maps , delineates a central region of radius @xmath156 . using the model of @xcite , we computed the bolometric power per unit of stellar mass produced by a star formation episode lasting 10myr ( imf - truncated ) and by an older population of 1gyr , as well as their mass to light ratios in the ks band ( close to 1m@xmath204 ) , and then the resulting radiation field in the center as a function of the mass fraction of the younger population . using the value of the solar neighborhood radiation field given by @xcite , we find that the radiation field is high enough only if more than 80% of the mass is locked in the imf - truncated starburst , hence the mass of any old stellar population is negligible .",
    "since this is unrealistic , an abnormal imf is unlikely to cause the observed synchrotron deficiency in ngc1377 . in ic1953 , the average radiation field intensity implied by the dust temperature is only 100 times the solar neighborhood value ( in fact more than 200 times in the circumnuclear region , according to the decomposition shown in fig .",
    "[ sed ] ) , but the required stellar density is still much higher than that observed , unless more than 65% of the central mass had been generated by a recent starburst .",
    "the hypothesis of a weak magnetic field remains difficult to rule out .",
    "however , if the magnetic energy density of some galaxies happened to be 1040 times lower than in normal galaxies , it would be difficult to explain why this is so rare and why this deficiency is connected with high dust temperatures , which are observed in all high-@xmath32 galaxies , unless it is causally linked with the occurrence of a starburst .",
    "if the magnetic pressure is unusually low , then cloud collapse is more efficient and a starburst can be triggered at relatively low gas densities ; however , the question remains of what caused the low magnetic pressure , and why the starburst was not triggered before .",
    "it is also possible , if magnetic fields are usually amplified by a starburst due to increased turbulence , that there is a time delay for the adjustment of the magnetic field ; this would become a likely scenario if we detected significant shock excitation by supernov  by means of the [ feii ] emission line .",
    "note however that the radio spectra of ngc4491 , ngc4418 and the disk of ic1953 bring evidence of a normal magnetic field strength , because they show substantial synchrotron emission , and that no signs of supernova shocks exist yet for ngc1377 .",
    "random magnetic fields of a few @xmath1 g , about half the typical strength of total magnetic fields in spiral galaxies , are expected from turbulence alone , even in the absence of large - scale dynamo action .",
    "field strengths of several @xmath1 g are easily obtained in elliptical galaxies although they are devoid of rotation @xcite , comparable to strengths in spirals .",
    "unbiased statistical information about synchrotron emission of ellipticals is uneasy to find , but they are much weaker radio emitters than spirals , and their activity is mostly due to seyfert nuclei @xcite ; their star formation rates are too low to produce enough cosmic rays .",
    "magnetic field amplification by large - scale dynamo processes occurs on timescales as large as @xmath205  years @xcite .",
    "however , the growth of random fields requires much less time . depending on the turbulence characteristics , in particular the cut - off scale , the fastest - growing modes in a predominantly neutral medium may develop on timescales as small as @xmath78  years , according to @xcite .    as pointed out by @xcite , the fact that quiescent galaxies and starbursts follow the same infrared - radio correlation , despite the large expected differences in inverse compton losses , suggests that the total magnetic field grows subsequent to a starburst .",
    "if inverse compton losses are dominant over synchrotron losses , the lifetime of relativistic electrons is inversely proportional to the radiation energy density . assuming a size of 100pc for the infrared - emitting region of ngc1377 ( see sect .",
    "[ n1377 ] ) , the radiation energy density integrated between 3 and 120@xmath1 m , at the surface of the region , is of the order of @xmath206jm@xmath207 . in the ultraluminous compact starbursts studied by @xcite ,",
    "the typical radiation energy density is estimated to be six times higher than this , and yet they are strong radio continuum emitters , so that synchrotron losses must at least balance inverse compton losses : mechanisms at work to amplify magnetic fields seem to conspire to produce a constant ratio of magnetic energy density to radiation energy density .",
    "this must occur on timescales comparable to or shorter than the growth time of the supernova rate , otherwise significant deviations from the correlation would be observed .",
    "the issue of magnetic field strength is unsettled for ngc1377 , but we would like to stress that a weak field is not required to explain the synchrotron deficiency , since it is easily achieved by lack of cosmic rays , consistent with the fact that no supernova activity is observed .",
    "furthermore , a separate cause has to be sought to explain the absence of free - free emission , which is unaffected by the magnetic field strength .",
    "alternatively , if the magnetic field in a galaxy were amplified beyond normal values , it would cause more intense radio emission for the same injected population of cosmic rays , since the synchrotron emissivity scales as a large power of the field strength ( index between 2 and 4 ) . as a result ,",
    "the infrared - to - radio ratio would decrease , but the radio emission would fade faster after an episode of star formation . if the magnetic field became so strong that the cosmic rays decayed very fast , the synchrotron emission would appear in intense bursts followed by periods of radio quiescence . in a steady - state situation , allowing some uncertainty range for the imf slope , one would expect from the infrared luminosity of ngc1377 a type - ii supernova explosion , on average , at least every 100 years . thus , cosmic rays should be injected into the interstellar medium , after a time delay , at this average rate . for the lifetime of cosmic - ray electrons to be reduced to 100 years or less at ghz frequencies , a magnetic field of the order of 50 mg would be required over large portions of the interstellar medium @xcite , that is to say @xmath208 times higher than the typical strength in spiral galaxies @xcite .",
    "no amplification mechanism is known to achieve such a result on large spatial scales , and such a strong field would clearly not be confined @xcite . invoking such absurd values of the magnetic field is much less credible than the nascent starburst hypothesis . as a comparison , @xcite estimate fields strengths up to 350@xmath1 g in the radio - loud galaxy cygnus  a , using the assumption of minimum energy density for the sum of cosmic rays and magnetic fields .",
    "starburst galaxies may have magnetic fields of a few 10@xmath1 g , generally calculated under the same mimimum - energy assumption ; for instance , @xcite derived an equipartition total field of 50@xmath1 g in m82 .",
    "we can discard high opacity at 21 cm as the reason for radio weakness , because it would require ngc1377 and ic1953 to have respectively @xmath74(21@xmath209 and @xmath74(21@xmath210 , only in order to have an intrinsic @xmath32 of @xmath211 , and ngc4491 would have to feature an unrealistic geometry .",
    "high opacities are very unlikely , since the high-@xmath32 ultraluminous compact starbursts studied by @xcite ( with @xmath212 ) , much more active and dense , have estimated opacities of only 0.50.7 .",
    "the infrared - radio properties of ngc1377 and ngc4491 may be suggestive of the presence of active nuclei in these galaxies .",
    "however , spectral diagnostics do not support this view , since emission lines are either absent or very weak and narrow .",
    "two indirect arguments can be put forward to support the presence of a seyfert nucleus : warm infrared colors , and the compactness of the infrared emission .",
    "we consider the argument of deep silicate absorption in the 911@xmath1 m range in ngc1377 speculative , especially since the continuum emission longward of 11@xmath1 m has not been observed , and because it would be difficult to reconcile with the moderate dust to stellar emission power ratio ; diagnostics based on optical spectroscopy can not be applied .",
    "however , the above two characteristics support equally well the hypothesis of a young starburst .",
    "the mid - infrared spectrum is an extremely ambiguous diagnostic , since it does not show the aromatic bands associated with star formation , but does show an unusual emission feature , in place of the continuum expected in a pure seyfert nucleus . concerning the infrared broadband colors , @xcite , for instance , have shown that they are not valid discriminants between starburst and seyfert activities  even if a larger percentage of energetically - dominating seyfert galaxies is found in any sample pre - selected to have warm colors , than in a sample with cooler colors .",
    "the concentration factor is not a strong argument either , since a young starburst will be compact ( to trigger a star formation burst instantaneously over a large area requires uncommon conditions ) ; the data for ngc1377 suggest that the size could be as small as @xmath0pc , i.e. 1(sect .",
    "[ n1377 ] ) , and is smaller than @xmath213 , i.e. 200pc ( sect .  [ n1377_pifs ] ) .",
    "in addition , seyfert nuclei powerful enough to dominate dust heating tend to occur in massive galaxies with a deep potential well , whereas ngc1377 is a low - mass galaxy and with a shallow potential .",
    "but perhaps the most problematic fact for seyfert activity is the radio deficiency .",
    "many active nuclei are known to be radio - quiet . however , their @xmath32 ratios are the same as in normal galaxies .",
    "for instance , the infrared - loud and radio - quiet quasar studied by @xcite has an observed @xmath214 , even if it is strongly absorbed at 20 cm . in the sample of @xcite , containing a large number of radio - quiet active nuclei ,",
    "no nucleus has a @xmath32 ratio significantly higher than the average for normal galaxies ; all the seyfert - type galaxies which are not detected at 20 cm are not detected by iras either .",
    "we have further verified this fact by selecting in the ned database all galaxies in the quasar category with @xmath215jy and no mention of a radio association ; on the 53 objects thus selected , 7 were excluded for lack of any radio observations , and all the others have either normal or low @xmath32 ratios .",
    "the infrared brightness of ngc1377 thus presents serious difficulties for the hypothesis of a radio - quiet active nucleus .",
    "an examination of the energetics provides another argument against the production of the infrared power of ngc1377 by an active nucleus . assuming that the radiated power is equal to the eddington limit , @xmath216 ( m@xmath12 ) , and that it goes entirely into dust heating , an upper limit on the black hole mass provides an upper limit on the infrared power .",
    "for a given black hole mass , the radio loudness can vary considerably ( e.g. @xcite ) ; but for radio - quiet active nuclei exclusively , estimating black hole masses from reverberation mapping techniques , @xcite found a correlation between the black hole mass and the radio power , with a lower envelope of all their data of the form @xmath217 . using the 20 cm upper limit for ngc1377",
    ", the alleged black hole can not be more massive than @xmath218m@xmath12 .",
    "using alternatively the kinematic information derived from the h@xmath116 emission line ( sect .",
    "[ n1377_pifs ] ) , another limit can be set . with a velocity gradient below 40kms@xmath10 ,",
    "the inclination - corrected rotation velocity is less than 25kms@xmath10 ( with a signal to noise ratio of @xmath156 throughout the central 2 ) .",
    "assuming virial equilibrium , and provided the h@xmath116 lies in the plane of the galactic disk , we then do not expect more than @xmath219m@xmath12 to be enclosed in the central parsec .",
    "using the first upper limit , we thus find that the maximum infrared power ( in extremely unrealistic conditions ) radiated by an active nucleus is @xmath220w .",
    "in fact , it is expected to be a factor of several below this value , because the dust heating efficiency can not be 100% .",
    "the infrared luminosity of ngc1377 being @xmath221w , an active nucleus can not easily account for it .",
    "the absence of synchrotron emission might be attributed to lack of magnetic field ( sect .",
    "[ magfield ] ) , or extreme inverse compton losses , due to the high radiation field intensity in ngc1377 .",
    "nevertheless , an active nucleus must also produce some free - free emission , which is not detected either . inside the region where dust grains are sublimated ,",
    "the lyman continuum photons are free to ionize the gas , contrary to the situation in an embedded starburst .",
    "@xcite have compiled spectral energy distributions of quasars and estimated , in particular , the ionizing photon flux and the total power between 1000  and 100@xmath1 m .",
    "the ratio between these two quantities is @xmath222s@xmath10w@xmath10 ( or @xmath223 ) . taking the infrared luminosity of ngc1377 as a lower limit to @xmath224 and assuming that the ionizing photon flux available in the dust - free region is equal to @xmath225 , the free - free emission at 3.6 cm , where thermal opacity is negligible , should amount to @xmath226mjy ( with @xmath227k ) .",
    "it would thus have been detected , especially by the sensitive observation with the vla in the a configuration .",
    "the single - dish upper limit is 2mjy , and the vla upper limit is 0.13mjy .",
    "although we can not rule out completely the presence of an active nucleus , because the properties of ngc1377 remain challenging , the above arguments rather support our hypothesis of a nascent starburst .",
    "the properties of ngc4491 may in turn be indicative of non - stellar activity , because some active nuclei are known to have flat radio spectra .",
    "dust heating by an active nucleus is however very unlikely , owing to the following facts : ngc4491 has no bulge ; the velocity gradient inferred from the pa@xmath113 line ( see section  [ nirspec ] ) is much less than 100kms@xmath10 , which confirms that there is no central gravitational cusp ( the inclination on the line of sight is about 62 ) ; optical and near - infrared emission lines do not give any indication of an active nucleus ; the dust spectral energy distribution is fully consistent with the properties of star - forming galaxies , whereas one would expect a high mid - infrared to far - infrared power ratio if dust were heated by an active nucleus .",
    "other high-@xmath32 galaxies , deviating by more than @xmath127 from the average infrared to radio flux ratio , are known , though ngc1377 is the most extreme case . among the sample studied by @xcite in a series of papers , comprised of galaxies",
    "whose flux density is higher at 60@xmath1 m than at 100@xmath1 m , 31 lie in the nvss sky coverage ( including ngc1377 ) ; of these 31 , we find that five galaxies satisfy the above high-@xmath32 criterion .",
    "of the 40 very luminous galaxies belonging to the iras bright galaxy sample ( @xmath228jy and log(@xmath229 ) , @xcite have found three more high-@xmath32 galaxies , which are distant ( 200 to 300mpc ) and whose flux densities peak at 60@xmath1 m ; they classify them as compact starbursts .",
    "the activity of two of them is obviously driven by on - going mergers , with double nuclei separated by less than 5  @xcite , and the third galaxy presents a strong warp @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite claim that their radio deficiency is best explained by high free - free opacity at 20 cm , rather than a lack of cosmic rays .",
    "nine galaxies with @xmath230 are mentioned by @xcite in a complete sample of 1809 galaxies with @xmath231jy ( i.e. with an occurrence rate of 0.5% ) , two of which in common with @xcite . however , reexamining these galaxies , we find that five of them are false high-@xmath32 detections , due partly to confusion affecting iras fluxes , and partly to nvss catalog fluxes missing low - surface brightness or extended structures . on the other hand , @xcite have missed ngc1377 , ngc4491 and two galaxies of the sample of @xcite , which , according to the selection criteria of @xcite , must be part of their sample and have @xmath230 .",
    "because of inevitable errors due to automatic handling of very large samples , the census of high-@xmath32 galaxies they provide is therefore uncertain .",
    "the two new high-@xmath32 galaxies that they found have @xmath2 ratios of @xmath232 and 1.44 .    in view of the above numbers",
    ", it seems that the most efficient way of finding synchrotron - deficient galaxies is to select high dust temperatures ( @xmath233 for all known high-@xmath32 galaxies ) , and that the infrared luminosity matters much less .",
    "the occurrence rate in the color - selected sample of @xcite is as high as 16% .",
    "60@xmath1m - peakers being scarce objects , however , the implied probability for a random local galaxy to be synchrotron - deficient must be very low .",
    "the flux - limited sample of @xcite and @xcite ( 500 galaxies with @xmath228jy ) contains at least 6 high-@xmath32 galaxies identified in the above various samples , which implies a rate of the order of 1% .",
    "the incidence of high dust temperatures is an additional argument in favor of the nascent starburst hypothesis that we have developed for ngc1377 , ic1953 and ngc4491 . in this scenario ,",
    "the scarcity of high-@xmath32 galaxies derives naturally from the timescales involved .",
    "the likelihood for a galaxy to have a high @xmath32 ratio is the product of the probabilities of two occurrences : it has to have been quiescent for at least @xmath31  years , and a starburst has to have started less than 34myr before the epoch of observation .",
    "less than @xmath234% of optically - selected galaxies have infrared color excesses indicative of on - going intense star formation , as apparent from the analysis of @xcite ( of their `` hp sample '' ) ; from this we may infer that galaxies spend , on average , less than 15% of the time in starburst events .",
    "given a typical starburst duration of @xmath235myr , with @xmath236 , the second probability listed above is necessarily lower than @xmath237 .",
    "while the probability of the first occurrence ( quiescence for @xmath31  years ) is difficult to assess , it is sufficiently unlikely that high-@xmath32 systems should be rare , consistent with the statistics .",
    "however , at high redshifts , before the epoch of maximum star formation density , the probability of observing radio - deficient galaxies may be higher .",
    "it is unknown beyond what redshift metallicity effects , reducing the amount of dust and thus of infrared emission , will start to compete with the nascent starburst effect .",
    "@xcite recently estimated @xmath32 ratios of distant galaxies ( @xmath238 up to 1.3 ) and found no significant deviation of the average from the local value .",
    "the data shown in this paper are consistent with the high infrared to radio flux ratios being caused by a delay in either the magnetic field strength or the cosmic ray density , in either case a consequence of a nascent starburst .",
    "in contrast to the above infrared - luminous galaxies , ngc1377 , ngc4491 and ic1953 have a shallow potential well , such that the triggering mechanism of a central starburst is not obvious . in ic1953 , tidal interaction ,",
    "likely at work , could be responsible for strengthening the bar perturbation ( which seems unusually strong for the morphological type of ic1953 ) and causing massive gas inflow due to the bar potential .",
    "in this view , we would be witnessing the first burst caused by the bar , and ic1953 will likely have an earlier - type aspect afterwards .",
    "ngc4491 is also strongly barred , and this bar may also have grown due to tidal forces with other virgo galaxies .",
    "however , no evidence of a bar nor of an intrusion exists in the most extreme galaxy of the three , ngc1377 .",
    "are tidal interactions experienced by galaxies in clusters and groups efficient at producing gas inflows inside them , even in the absence of any visible potential perturbation  ?",
    "other hi - deficient and non - seyfert virgo galaxies , besides ngc4491 , indeed have surprisingly high mid - infrared colors in their centers : n4293 , n4569 , n4579 @xcite .",
    "note that all these galaxies either lie close to m87 in projection and have radial velocities more than 600kms@xmath10 away from the velocity centroid @xcite , or lie at the periphery of the cluster in projection , which could mean that they are part of a very turbulent subsystem .",
    "@xcite found such an environmental effect in the virgo unrelaxed subsystem called w , where blue compact dwarf galaxies are more numerous and have hotter dust than in the rest of the cluster .",
    "hidden perturbations are best revealed by observing the hi morphology and velocity structure , but ngc1377 seems to have too little hi gas for such a diagnostic to be applied .",
    "an assessment of the nature and cause of the activity seen in the three galaxies will have to wait for complementary data .",
    "in order to understand the cause of the synchrotron deficiency observed in the three closest high-@xmath32 galaxies , we have presented and analysed extensive data in several windows : broadband dust emission , radio continuum at several frequencies , emission line diagnostics of photon ionization , supernova shocks and hot molecular gas excitation , and emission of the cold molecular gas .",
    "we argued that the galaxies are seen at the very onset of a starburst episode , following a long period of quiescence , based on these data , and consistent with the statistics of high-@xmath32 galaxies inferred from starburst timescales . in this scenario ,",
    "cosmic rays generated by past star formation had the time to decay , and massive stars produced by the current star formation episode have not evolved into supernov  yet ( ngc1377 , central region of ic1953 ) or , in the case of ngc4491 , the supernova rate is still rising and the cosmic ray population is in its formative stages .    all three galaxies host unusually hot dust , requiring an intense radiation field consistent with that produced by a young starburst .",
    "ngc1377 , whose properties are the most peculiar , is not only devoid of synchrotron radiation , but also of free - free emission .",
    "we propose that the starburst is so young that massive stars are still accreting material , preventing the development of hii regions . along the same line",
    ", dust emission in the mid - infrared has an unusual spectral signature , suggesting that grains were processed differently from grains found in almost every other star formation environment ; the molecular gas disk may be overcritical , which would explain the quasi - instantaneous trigger of a starburst . while this is the most likely explanation ,",
    "the properties of ngc1377 remain very intriguing .",
    "we can rule out abnormal initial mass function , electron opacity and fast synchrotron losses as causes of the depressed radio continuum .",
    "other scenarios are not formally ruled out , but create serious difficulties : radio - quiet seyfert activity is unlikely owing to the energetics arguments discussed in section  [ seyfert ] ; a weak magnetic field ( relevant only for ngc1377 ) is possible , but difficult to explain in light of what is known of turbulent field amplification , and still requires a young starburst after a period of quiescence .",
    "we would like to stress that the galaxies studied in this paper are not akin to irregular or blue compact dwarf galaxies , which would at first sight be easily susceptible of synchrotron deficiency for various reasons : fast cosmic ray escape and interstellar medium disruption and loss ; evidence of optically - thick free - free emission in some of them .",
    "although these galaxies seem to have much more dispersed infrared to radio flux ratios than spirals , they follow the same average relationship and none of them is known to deviate from it significantly .    among galaxies of the iras bright galaxy sample , selected by their 60@xmath1 m flux ,",
    "the occurrence rate of high-@xmath32 galaxies ( in our interpretation nascent starbursts ) is of the order of 1% or slightly more .",
    "the best way to select these galaxies is to search for high dust temperatures ; no other simple criterion is evident .",
    "although very few examples are known , from this phenomenon arises a potential problem for the identification of distant infrared galaxies with high - resolution radio observations , especially with possibly changing star formation timescales at high redshifts .",
    "the galaxies studied here offer a unique glimpse at starbursts during a critical period of their evolution , and will allow us to address questions concerning the pre - starburst accumulation of molecular material , the triggering mechanisms , the spatial development of a starburst , and the start , build - up and evolution of a cosmic ray population .",
    "we are grateful to antonio garca - barreto for providing us his ( h@xmath33+[nii ] ) and i - band maps of ic1953 , to sangeeta malhotra for mentioning the peculiar infrared properties of ngc4418 , thereby arousing our curiousity , to the persons who assisted us in the observations at effelsberg , palomar and la silla , and to james brauher for communicating us some fluxes in advance of publication .",

    "system temperatures ranged between 200k and 400k at 230ghz and between 230k and 460k at 115ghz .",
    "the beam width is 45at 115ghz and 23  at 230ghz .",
    "baseline fitting and removal in each separate spectrum , and averaging of spectra obtained at the same position were performed with the class software , which is developed by the observatoire de grenoble and iram .",
    "we used main beam efficiencies of 0.7 at 115ghz and 0.5 at 230ghz , and a forward efficiency of 0.9 .",
    "pointing corrections were determined on the closest bright sio masers , o  ceti and orion  sio , twice per observing session , at the beginning and after sunset .",
    "these sources are respectively about 15  and 30away from ngc1377 in azimuth , and about 15  away to the north . due to these large distances ,",
    "the pointing accuracy is likely degraded with respect to the quoted value of 3  rms in azimuth and elevation .",
    "furthermore , a hardware limit obliged us to rotate the antenna by 360  in azimuth once per night ; because the co(2 - 1 ) spectrum obtained on the center of ngc1377 before the rotation was not reproduced within the error bar after the rotation , we suspect that this introduced additional pointing errors , and we discarded the redundant data obtained after rotating the antenna .    in order to know whether the co source is extended , we performed minimal mapping , integrating on the galaxy center and eight adjacent positions stepped by half the co(2 - 1 ) beam width .",
    "the spectra are shown in figure  [ co_maps ] .",
    "the resulting eighteen total flux measurements were least - squares - fitted with a gaussian source of adjustable width , allowing for some random pointing errors of up to 3  at each position , plus some systematic larger pointing errors after each large rotation of the antenna . if no systematic errors are allowed , then the fit is not acceptable ( normalized @xmath240 ) .",
    "we can reproduce the data provided these systematic pointing errors are of the order of 5  or slightly more .",
    "the best fit is then always obtained for the smallest source size of the explored grid . due to the large beams ,",
    "this parameter is not well constrained , but the derived total fluxes are robust results .",
