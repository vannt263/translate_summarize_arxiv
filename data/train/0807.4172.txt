    "when light passes though any gain medium , it will acquire noise through spontaneous emission ( se ) @xcite .",
    "the se noise sets a fundamental limit on the linewidth of a laser . for a continuous wave laser ,",
    "this schawlow - townes limit is due to phase jitter @xcite .",
    "the situation with modelocked lasers is more complicated .",
    "a mode - locked laser produces a train of pulses , regularly spaced in time , and the frequency spectrum is a series of narrow comb lines .",
    "the width of each comb line depends on the timing and phase jitter of the pulse train .",
    "the laser dynamics are characterized by four pulse parameters : the pulse energy , the central or carrier frequency , the central pulse time , the phase , and in addition a fifth parameter : the round - trip gain . in all mode - locked lasers , strong nonlinearities couple amplitude and frequency fluctuations into timing and phase jitter .",
    "the quantum - limited noise properties of mode - locked lasers were first treated by haus and mecozzi in @xcite , hereafter referred to as hm . until recently , subsequent work focused mainly on quantum - limited timing jitter . with the development of femtosecond frequency",
    "combs @xcite , the more general problem of timing and phase jitter has received more attention @xcite . while hm calculated the timing and phase jitter rather than the comb linewidths , that paper contains almost all of the information needed to calculate the linewidths .",
    "more recent work has included making extensions to the hm approach to determine the linewidths when bounded contributions to the timing and phase jitter can be ignored @xcite , developing more elaborate models of pulse propagation in the laser @xcite , including technical noise contributions @xcite , and including the effects of gain dynamics @xcite .",
    "a major unknown in all theoretical efforts to date was the strength of couplings between pulse parameters .",
    "theoretical predictions carry large uncertainties and depend on the details of the laser design , including dispersion management .",
    "recently , we quantitatively measured the linear response of the pulse energy , the central frequency , the round - trip gain @xcite , the timing and the phase @xcite of a mode - locked ti : sapphire laser .",
    "the motivation for that work was to quantitatively predict the se - limited noise properties of the laser , the subject of this paper .",
    "when considering the shape of the comb lines of a mode - locked laser , there is a fundamental distinction between the case of a free - running laser and the case of a laser locked to an external oscillator . in the former case , when the noise source is se noise or any other white noise source , the central time and the phase of the mode - locked pulse undergo a random walk , and the comb lines have a stationary shape . in the latter case , again assuming white noise , the central pulse time and the phase are bounded , and there is no stationary line shape ; the measured line width is inversely proportional to the measurement time .",
    "however , the phase noise spectrum of each comb line is stationary , and that spectrum  not the frequency spectrum  is physically meaningful .",
    "any clock or frequency measurement system consists of an oscillator and a counter @xcite .",
    "the clock s performance depends on the frequency noise of the oscillator and the phase noise of the counter .",
    "virtually all theoretical calculations to date of the noise properties of passively mode - locked lasers have focused on the frequency spectrum of a free - running laser , but in modern time and frequency metrology applications , these lasers are part of the counting system @xcite , so it is their phase noise spectrum after they are locked to an oscillator that is important . here , we calculate the se - limited noise properties of a ti : sapphire laser , comparing the comb line shape of the free - running laser and the residual phase noise of comb lines of the phase - locked laser , using experimentally - derived parameters for the linear response of the laser to noise perturbations .",
    "the laser is characterized by the pulse energy @xmath3 , the gain @xmath4 , the central frequency @xmath5 , the central pulse time @xmath6 , and the phase @xmath7 , where @xmath8 denotes the equilibrium value of each quantity and @xmath9 the fluctuation about equilibrium . defining @xmath10 as the round trip time",
    ", we have the repetition rate @xmath11 . without loss of generality",
    ", we may choose @xmath12 and @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the equilibrium carrier - envelope offset frequency .",
    "we define the phase with respect to a common reference rather than the pulse envelope .",
    "consequently , @xmath15 is related to the carrier - envelope phase slip @xmath16 by @xmath17 .",
    "the linear response of the laser to perturbations is @xcite @xmath18",
    "where @xmath19 ( @xmath20 denotes the transpose ) , @xmath21 is a vector of noise sources for each parameter , and @xmath22 is a matrix of coefficients that describe the linear response of each parameter to changes in itself or the others . once @xmath22 and @xmath21 are known , one can calculate the timing and phase jitter @xcite , which leads to the optical frequency comb line shapes @xcite .",
    "the noise sources perturb all five parameters , and also add energy into a continuum of dispersive modes , but these modes must be damped in order for a passively mode - locked laser to be stable .",
    "consequently , the noise contributions to those modes do not affect the linewidths .    to calculate the frequency or phase noise spectrum , we use the formalism of stochastic differential equations @xcite .",
    "the second - order moment equations for the laser parameters are @xmath23 where @xmath24 is one of the dynamical variables and @xmath25 relates @xmath21 to a matrix @xmath26 of noise drivers .",
    "for the 5 dynamical parameters introduced above , there are thus 15 differential equations describing the response of the second - order moments to the noise sources .",
    "the quantum noise drivers @xmath27 were found using a generalized perturbation theory for gaussian pulses in a dispersion managed soliton laser @xcite . defining the cavity lifetime @xmath28 , the fluorescence lifetime @xmath29 , the equilibrium photon number @xmath30 , the equilibrium upper state population @xmath31 , and the pulse width @xmath32 , they are @xmath33\\frac{1}{\\tph}\\frac{\\hbar \\omeq}{\\weq } , & d_{\\om\\om } = & t_p^{-2 } \\frac{1}{\\tph}\\frac{\\hbar \\omeq}{\\weq } , \\\\ d_{\\theta\\theta } = & 2 f(t_p ) \\frac{1}{\\tph}\\frac{\\hbar \\omeq}{\\weq } , & d_{\\tau\\tau } = & t_p^2\\frac{1}{\\tph}\\frac{\\hbar \\omeq}{\\weq } , \\label{drivers } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 is a dispersion management parameter .",

    "these central frequency fluctuations are driven mostly by the direct term @xmath68 .",
    "the noise is dominated by timing jitter over most of the spectrum , suggesting the importance of minimizing the cavity dispersion for comb applications .",
    "also note that the correlation term @xmath69 leads to a shift in the frequency of minimum linewidth from the central frequency .",
    "this shift is especially important for the kerr effect , which affects both phase and timing @xcite .",
    "in metrological applications of femtosecond frequency combs , the comb is phase - locked to a frequency standard , and this has a profound effect on the lineshape .",

    "the second term corresponds to residual phase noise , the shape of which depends on the laser dynamics and the details of the feedback system . in metrology applications ,",
    "the residual phase noise leads to uncertainty in frequency measurements @xcite .    in optical frequency",
    "metrology @xcite or optical clock development and comparison @xcite , @xmath54 is measured and locked using self - referencing and @xmath53 is locked to a microwave frequency standard or to a heterodyne beat between a comb line and a laser line locked to an optical atomic transition . because it depends on the phase with respect to the envelope , @xmath54 depends on both @xmath55 and @xmath15 . in general",
    ", the phase of a comb line depends on both parameters as well , so each feedback system , for both @xmath54 and @xmath53 , will measure and act on fluctuations in both @xmath55 and @xmath15 .",
    "if , for simplicity , one assumes that the feedback mechanism  a cavity mirror on a piezoelectric transducer or an acousto - optic modulator controlling the pump power  acts on @xmath75 and @xmath76 , rather than some other linear combination of @xmath77 and @xmath78 , one can proceed by defining a linear transformation which goes from the @xmath79 basis to the @xmath80 basis .",
    "each feedback loop acts on the latter pair of variables , and the inverse transformation determines how the feedback affects @xmath55 and @xmath15 .",
    "we have modeled a feedback system with parallel proportional and integrator stages because it is simple enough that analytical solutions can still be found .",
    "the parameters we choose give a servo bump at about 1 khz .",
    "we assume a simple radio frequency @xmath53 lock rather than a lock using an optical heterodyne beat .",
    "we have found that shot noise in the detection of beats used for locking the laser introduces a negligible amount of noise through the feedback loops because the bandwidth of a typical feedback system is approximately two orders of magnitude smaller than @xmath53 .",
    "we note that when the feedback bandwidth becomes comparable to the dynamical frequencies in the laser , the laser dynamics participate in the feedback mechanism @xcite .",

    "the phase noise spectrum contains all the information needed to determine the uncertainty in a frequency measurement .",
    "there has been recent work on how best to estimate uncertainty from measurements using modern frequency counters , which use interpolation to increase their accuracy over older style counters @xcite .",
    "counting of zero - crossings is well - described by the allan variance , whereas the uncertainty in measurements using modern counters is better described by the _ triangle variance _ @xcite .",
    "we have calculated both uncertainty estimates using the se - limited phase noise spectrum and found that , in the center of the spectrum where the noise is smallest , the allan ( triangle ) deviation is 8@xmath82 ( 8@xmath83 ) for 1 second averaging time . the large difference between the two arises from the triangle variance s stronger rejection of high frequency ( compared to the gate time ) noise .",
    "for a comb line 200 thz away from the center of the spectrum , we find that the allan ( triangle ) deviation is 1@xmath84 ( 1@xmath85 ) for 1 second averaging time .",
    "note that these values depend strongly on the feedback parameters .",
    "combs have already been shown to be comparable with 1-s allan deviation on the order of 10@xmath86 fractional uncertainty @xcite .",
    "the calculations presented here are of the same order of magnitude , but we caution that our calculation is specific to the laser studied in @xcite and @xcite , using the simple feedback model we considered .",
    "we note that our approach applies to technical noise sources as well , if one adds them to the driving terms contained in @xmath26 . using that information , coupled with experimentally - derived parameters for @xmath22 and a detailed and accurate model of the feedback system",
