    "the present review has evolved from two courses i have taught several times at the johannes gutenberg - universitt , mainz .",
    "the first course was an introduction to chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) which only covered the purely mesonic sector of the theory . in the second course",
    "the methods were extended to also include baryons .",
    "i have tried to preserve the spirit of those lectures in this article in the sense that it is meant to be a _ pedagogical introduction _ to the basic concepts of chiral perturbation theory . by this",
    "i do not mean that the material covered is trivial , but that rather i have deliberately also worked out those pieces which by the `` experts '' are considered as well known . in particular , i have often included intermediate steps in derivations in order to facilitate the understanding of the origin of the final results .",
    "my intention was to keep a balance between mathematical rigor and illustrations by means of ( numerous ) simple examples .",
    "this article addresses both experimentalists and theorists ! ideally , it would help a graduate student interested in theoretical physics getting started in the field of chiral perturbation theory .",
    "however , it is also written for an experimental graduate student with the purpose of conveying some ideas why the experiment she / he is performing is important for our theoretical understanding of the strong interactions .",
    "my precedent in this context is the review by a.  w.  thomas @xcite which appeared in this series many years ago and served for me as an introduction to the cloudy bag model .",
    "finally , this article clearly is not intended to be a comprehensive overview of the numerous results which have been obtained over the past two decades . for obvious reasons ,",
    "i would , right at the beginning , like to apologize to all the researchers who have made important contributions to the field that have not been mentioned in this work .",
    "readers interested in the present status of applications are referred to lecture notes and review articles as well as conference proceedings @xcite .",
    "the present article is organized as follows .",
    "chapter 1 contains a general introduction to the empirical and theoretical foundations which led to the development of chiral perturbation theory .",
    "many of the technical aspects mentioned in the introduction will be treated in great detail later on .",
    "chapter 2 deals with qcd and its global symmetries in the chiral limit and the concept of green functions and ward identities reflecting the underlying chiral symmetry is elaborated . in chap .",
    "3 the idea of a spontaneous breakdown of a global symmetry is discussed and its consequences in terms of the goldstone theorem are demonstrated .",
    "chapter 4 deals with mesonic chiral perturbation theory and the principles entering the construction of the chiral lagrangian are outlined .",
    "various examples with increasing chiral orders and complexity are given .",
    "finally , in chap .",
    "5 the methods are extended to include the interaction between goldstone bosons and baryons in the single - baryon sector with the main emphasis put on the heavy - baryon formulation . at the end , the method of infrared regularization in the relativistic framework is discussed . some technical details and simple illustrations are relegated to the appendices .      in the 1950 s a description of the strong interactions in the framework of quantum field theory seemed to fail due to an ever increasing number of observed hadrons as well as a coupling constant which was too large to allow for a sensible application of perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "the rich spectrum of hadrons together with their finite sizes ( i.e. , non - point - like behavior showing up , e.g. , in elastic electron - proton scattering through the existence of form factors ) were the first hints pointing to a substructure in terms of more fundamental constituents .",
    "a calculation of the anomalous magnetic moments of protons and neutrons in the framework of a pseudoscalar pion - nucleon interaction gave rise to values which were far off the empirical ones ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "on the other hand , a simple quark model analysis @xcite gave a prediction @xmath0 for the ratio @xmath1 which is very close to the empirical value of @xmath2 .",
    "nevertheless , the existence of quarks was hotly debated for a long time , since these elementary building blocks , in contrast to the constituents of atomic or nuclear physics , could not be isolated as free particles , no matter what amount of energy was supplied to , say , the proton . until the early 1970 s it was common to talk about `` fictitious '' constituents allowing for a simplified group - theoretical classification of the hadron spectrum @xcite , which , however , could not be interpreted as dynamical degrees of freedom in the context of quantum field theory .    in our present understanding ,",
    "hadrons are highly complex objects built from more fundamental degrees of freedom .",
    "these are on the one hand matter fields with spin 1/2 ( quarks ) and on the other hand massless spin-1 fields ( gluons ) mediating the strong interactions .",
    "many empirical results of medium- and high - energy physics @xcite such as , e.g. , deep - inelastic lepton - hadron scattering , hadron production in electron - positron annihilation , and lepton - pair production in drell - yan processes may successfully be described using perturbative methods in the framework of an su(3 ) gauge theory , which is referred to as quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) @xcite . of particular importance in this context",
    "is the concept of asymptotic freedom @xcite , referring to the fact that the coupling strength decreases for increasing momentum transfer @xmath3 , providing an explanation of ( approximate ) bjorken scaling in deep inelastic scattering and allowing more generally for a perturbative approach at high energies .",
    "sometimes perturbative qcd is used as a synonym for asymptotic freedom . in refs .",
    "@xcite it was shown that yang - mills theories , i.e. , gauge theories based on non - abelian lie groups , provide the only possibility for asymptotically free theories in four dimensions . at present ,",
    "qcd is compatible with all empirical phenomena of the strong interactions in the asymptotic region .",
    "however , one should also keep in mind that many phenomena can not be treated by perturbation theory .",
    "for example , simple ( static ) properties of hadrons can not yet be described by _ ab initio _ calculations from qcd and this remains one of the largest challenges in theoretical particle physics @xcite . in this context",
    "it is interesting to note that , of the three open problems of qcd at the quantum level , namely , the `` gap problem , '' `` quark confinement , '' and ( spontaneous ) `` chiral symmetry breaking '' @xcite , the yang - mills existence of a mass gap has been chosen as one of the millennium prize problems @xcite of the clay mathematics institute . from a physical point of view",
    "this problem relates to the fact that nuclear forces are strong and short - ranged .",
    "one distinguishes among six quark flavors @xmath4 ( up ) , @xmath5 ( down ) , @xmath6 ( strange ) , @xmath7 ( charm ) , @xmath8 ( bottom ) , and @xmath9 ( top ) , each of which coming in three different color degrees of freedom and transforming as a triplet under the fundamental representation of color su(3 ) .",
    "the interaction between the quarks and the eight gauge bosons does not depend on flavor , i.e. , gluons themselves are flavor neutral . on the other hand , due to the non - abelian character of the group su(3 ) ,",
    "also gluons carry `` color charges '' such that the qcd lagrangian contains gluon self interactions involving vertices with three and four gluon fields . as a result ,",
    "the structure of qcd is much more complicated than that of quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) which is based on a local , abelian u(1 ) invariance .",
    "however , it is exactly the non - abelian nature of the theory which provides an anti - screening due to gluons that prevails over the screening due to @xmath10 pairs , leading to an asymptotically free theory @xcite .",
    "since neither quarks nor gluons have been observed as free , asymptotic states , one assumes that any observable hadron must be in a so - called color singlet state , i.e. , a physically observable state is invariant under su(3 ) color transformations .",
    "the strong increase of the running coupling for large distances possibly provides a mechanism for color confinement @xcite . in the framework of lattice qcd",
    "this can be shown in the so - called strong coupling limit @xcite .",
    "however , one has to keep in mind that the continuum limit of lattice gauge theory is approached for a weak coupling and a mathematical proof for color confinement is still missing @xcite",
    ".    there still exists no _ analytical _",
    "method for the description of qcd at large distances , i.e. , at low energies .",
    "for example ,",
    "how the asymptotically observed hadrons , including their rich resonance spectrum , are created from qcd dynamics is still insufficiently understood .",
    "this is one of the reasons why , for many practical purposes , one makes use of phenomenological , more - or - less qcd - inspired , models of hadrons ( see , e.g. , ) .    besides the _ local",
    "su(3 ) color symmetry , qcd exhibits further _ global _ symmetries .",
    "for example , in a strong interaction process , a given quark can not change its flavor , and if quark - antiquark pairs are created or annihilated during the interaction , these pairs must be flavor neutral . in other words",
    ", for each flavor the difference in the number of quarks and antiquarks ( flavor number ) is a constant of the motion .",
    "this symmetry originates in a global invariance under a direct product of u(1 ) transformations for each quark flavor and is an exact symmetry of qcd independent of the value of the quark masses .",
    "other symmetries are more or less satisfied .",
    "it is well known that the hadron spectrum may be organized in terms of ( approximately ) degenerate basis states carrying irreducible representations of isospin su(2 ) . neglecting electromagnetic effects , such a symmetry in qcd results from equal @xmath4- and @xmath5-quark ( current ) masses .",
    "the extension including the @xmath6 quark leads to the famous flavor su(3 ) symmetry @xcite which , however , is already significantly broken due to the larger @xmath6-quark mass .",
    "the masses of the three light quarks @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 are small in comparison with the masses of `` typical '' light hadrons such as , e.g. , the @xmath11 meson ( 770 mev ) or the proton ( 938 mev ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the eight lightest pseudoscalar mesons are distinguished by their comparatively small masses . within the pseudoscalar octet ,",
    "the isospin triplet of pions has a significantly smaller mass ( 135 mev ) than the mesons containing strange quarks .",
    "one finds a relatively large mass gap of about 630 mev between the isospin triplets of the pseudoscalar and the vector mesons , with the gap between the corresponding multiplets involving strange mesons being somewhat smaller .    in the limit in which the masses of the light quarks go to zero ,",
    "the left - handed and right - handed quark fields are decoupled from each other in the qcd lagrangian .",
    "at the `` classical '' level qcd then exhibits a global @xmath12 symmetry .",
    "however , at the quantum level ( including loops ) the singlet axial - vector current develops an anomaly @xcite such that the difference in left - handed and right - handed quark numbers is not a constant of the motion . in other words , in the so - called chiral limit , the qcd - hamiltonian has a @xmath13 symmetry .    naturally the question arises , whether the hadron spectrum is , at least approximately , in accordance with such a symmetry of the hamiltonian .",
    "the @xmath14 symmetry is connected to baryon number conservation , where quarks and antiquarks are assigned the baryon numbers @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "mesons and baryons differ by their respective baryon numbers @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "since baryon number is additive , a nucleus containing @xmath19 nucleons has baryon number @xmath20 .",
    "on the other hand , the @xmath21 symmetry is not even approximately realized by the low - energy spectrum .",
    "if one constructs from the 16 generators of the group @xmath22 the linear combinations @xmath23 and @xmath24 , @xmath25 , the generators @xmath26 form a lie algebra corresponding to a su(3)@xmath27 subgroup @xmath28 of @xmath29 .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that , in the chiral limit , the ground state is necessarily invariant under the group @xmath28 , i.e. , the eight generators @xmath26 annihilate the ground state . the symmetry with respect to @xmath28 is said to be realized in the so - called wigner - weyl mode . as a consequence of coleman s theorem @xcite",
    ", the symmetry pattern of the spectrum follows the symmetry of the ground state .",
    "applying one of the axial generators @xmath30 to an arbitrary state of a given multiplet of well - defined parity , one would obtain a degenerate state of opposite parity , since @xmath30 has negative parity and , by definition , commutes with the hamiltonian in the chiral limit .",
    "however , due to coleman s theorem such a conclusion tacitly assumes that the ground state is annihilated by the @xmath30 .",
    "since such a parity doubling is not observed in the spectrum one reaches the conclusion that the @xmath30 do _ not _ annihilate the ground state . in other words ,",
    "the ground state is not invariant under the full symmetry group of the hamiltonian , a situation which is referred to as spontaneous symmetry breaking or the nambu - goldstone realization of a symmetry @xcite . as a consequence of the goldstone theorem @xcite ,",
    "each generator which commutes with the hamiltonian but does not annihilate the ground state is associated with a massless goldstone boson , whose properties are tightly connected with the generator in question .",
    "the eight generators @xmath31 have negative parity , baryon number zero , and transform as an octet under the subgroup su(3)@xmath27 leaving the vacuum invariant .",
    "thus one expects the same properties of the goldstone bosons , and the light pseudoscalar octet ( @xmath32 ) qualifies as candidates for these goldstone bosons .",
    "the finite masses of the physical multiplet are interpreted as a consequence of the explicit symmetry breaking due to the finite @xmath4- , @xmath5- , and @xmath6-quark masses in the qcd lagrangian @xcite .    of course , the above ( global ) symmetry considerations were long known before the formulation of qcd . in the 1960 s they were the cornerstones of the description of low - energy interactions of hadrons in the framework of various techniques , such as the current - algebra approach in combination with the hypothesis of a partially conserved axial - vector current ( pcac ) @xcite , the application of phenomenological lagrangians , and perturbation theory about a symmetry realized in the nambu - goldstone mode @xcite .",
    "all these methods were equivalent in the sense that they produced the same results for `` soft '' pions @xcite .",
    "although qcd is widely accepted as the fundamental gauge theory underlying the strong interactions , we still lack the analytical tools for _ ab initio _ descriptions of low - energy properties and processes .",
    "however , new techniques have been developed to extend the results of the current - algebra days and _ systematically _ explore corrections to the soft - pion predictions based on symmetry properties of qcd green functions .",
    "the method is called chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) @xcite and describes the dynamics of goldstone bosons in the framework of an effective field theory .",
    "although one returns to a field theory in terms of non - elementary hadrons , there is an important distinction between the early quantum field theories of the strong interactions and the new approach in the sense that , now , one is dealing with a so - called _ effective _ field theory .",
    "such a theory allows for a _ perturbative _ treatment in terms of a momentum  as opposed to a coupling - constant  expansion .",
    "the starting point is a theorem of weinberg stating that a perturbative description in terms of the most general effective lagrangian containing all possible terms compatible with assumed symmetry principles yields the most general @xmath33 matrix consistent with the fundamental principles of quantum field theory and the assumed symmetry principles @xcite .",
    "the proof of the theorem relies on lorentz invariance and the absence of anomalies @xcite and starts from the observation that the ward identities satisfied by the green functions of the symmetry currents are equivalent to an invariance of the generating functional under _ local _ transformations @xcite .",
    "for that reason , one considers a _ locally _ invariant , effective lagrangian although the symmetries of the underlying theory may originate in a global symmetry . if the ward identities contain anomalies , they show up as a modification of the generating functional , which can explicitly be incorporated through the wess - zumino - witten construction @xcite .",
    "all other terms of the effective lagrangian remain locally invariant .    in the present case ,",
    "the assumed symmetry is the @xmath13 symmetry of the qcd hamilton operator in the chiral limit , in combination with a restricted @xmath34 symmetry of the ground state . for center - of - mass energies below the @xmath11-meson mass , the only asymptotic states which can explicitly be produced are the goldstone bosons . for the description of processes in this energy regime one organizes the most general , chirally invariant lagrangian for the pseudoscalar meson octet in an expansion in terms of momenta and quark masses .",
    "such an ansatz is naturally suggested by the fact that the interactions of goldstone bosons are known to vanish in the zero - energy limit .",
    "since the effective lagrangian by construction contains an infinite number of interaction terms , one needs for any practical purpose an organization scheme allowing one to compare the importance of , say , two given diagrams . to that end , for a given diagram , one analyzes its behavior under a linear rescaling of the _ external _ momenta , @xmath35 , and a quadratic rescaling of the light quark masses , @xmath36 . applying weinberg s power counting scheme @xcite , one finds that any given diagram behaves as @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is determined by the structure of the vertices and the topology of the diagram in question . for a given @xmath39 , weinberg s formula unambiguously determines to",
    "which order in the momentum and quark mass expansion the lagrangian needs to be known .",
    "furthermore , the number of loops is restricted to be smaller than or equal to @xmath40 , i.e. , weinberg s power counting establishes a relation between the momentum expansion and the loop expansion .",
    "is an even number . ]",
    "effective field theories are not renormalizable in the usual sense .",
    "however , this is no longer regarded as a serious problem , since by means of weinberg s counting scheme the infinities arising from loops may be identified order by order in the momentum expansion and then absorbed in a renormalization of the coefficients of the most general lagrangian .",
    "thus , in any arbitrary order the results are finite .",
    "of course , there is a price to pay : the rapid increase in the number of possible terms as the order increases .",
    "practical applications will hence be restricted to low orders .",
    "the lowest - order mesonic lagrangian , @xmath41 , is given by the nonlinear @xmath42 model coupled to external fields @xcite .",
    "it contains two free parameters : the pion - decay constant and the scalar quark condensate , both in the chiral limit .",
    "the specific values are not determined by chiral symmetry and must , ultimately , be explained from qcd dynamics .",
    "when calculating processes in the phenomenological approximation to @xmath41 , i.e. , considering only tree - level diagrams , one reproduces the results of current algebra @xcite . since tree - level diagrams involving vertices derived from a hermitian lagrangian are always real , one has to go beyond the tree level in order not to violate the unitarity of the @xmath33 matrix .",
    "a calculation of one - loop diagrams with @xmath41 , on the one hand , leads to infinities which are not of the original type , but also contributes to a perturbative restoration of unitarity . due to weinberg s power counting ,",
    "the divergent terms are of order @xmath43 and can thus be compensated by means of a renormalization of the most general lagrangian at @xmath43 .",
    "the most general , effective lagrangian at @xmath43 was first constructed by gasser and leutwyler @xcite and contains 10 physical low - energy constants as well as two additional terms containing only external fields . out of the ten physically relevant structures ,",
    "eight are required for the renormalization of the infinities due to the one - loop diagrams involving @xmath41 .",
    "the finite parts of the constants represent free parameters , reflecting our ignorance regarding the underlying theory , namely qcd , in this order of the momentum expansion .",
    "these parameters may be fixed phenomenologically by comparison with experimental data @xcite .",
    "there are also theoretical approaches for estimating the low - energy constants in the framework of qcd - inspired models @xcite , meson - resonance saturation @xcite and lattice qcd @xcite .    without external fields ( i.e. , pure qcd ) or including electromagnetic processes only , the effective lagrangians @xmath41 and @xmath44 have an additional symmetry : they contain interaction terms involving exclusively an even number of goldstone bosons .",
    "this property is often referred to as normal or even _ intrinsic _ parity , but is obviously not a symmetry of qcd , because it would exclude reactions of the type @xmath45 or @xmath46 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , witten discussed how to remove this symmetry from the effective lagrangian and essentially re - derived the wess - zumino anomalous effective action which describes the chiral anomaly @xcite .",
    "the corresponding lagrangian , which is of @xmath43 , can not be written as a standard local effective lagrangian in terms of the usual chiral matrix @xmath47 but can be expressed directly in terms of the goldstone boson fields . in particular , for the above case , by construction it contains interaction terms with an odd number of goldstone bosons ( odd intrinsic parity ) .",
    "in contrast to the lagrangian of gasser and leutwyler , the wess - zumino - witten ( wzw ) effective action does not contain any free parameter apart from the number of colors .",
    "the excellent description of the neutral pion decay @xmath45 for @xmath48 is regarded as a key evidence for the existence of _ three _ color degrees of freedom .",
    "chiral perturbation theory to @xmath43 has become a well - established method for describing the low - energy interactions of the pseudoscalar octet . for an overview of its many successful applications the interested reader",
    "is referred to refs .   .",
    "in general , due to the relatively large mass of the @xmath6 quark , the convergence in the su(3 ) sector is somewhat slower as compared with the su(2 ) version .",
    "nevertheless , chpt in the su(3 ) sector has significantly contributed to our understanding of previously open questions .",
    "a prime example is the decay rate of @xmath49 which current algebra predicts to be much too small . in ref .  @xcite it was shown that one - loop corrections substantially increase the theoretical value and remove the previous discrepancy between theory and experiment .    for obvious reasons ,",
    "the question of convergence of the method is of utmost importance .",
    "the so - called chiral symmetry breaking scale @xmath50 is the dimensional parameter which characterizes the convergence of the momentum expansion @xcite .",
    "a `` naive '' dimensional analysis of loop diagrams suggests that this scale is given by @xmath51 , where @xmath52 denotes the pion - decay constant in the chiral limit and the factor @xmath53 originates from a geometric factor in the calculation of loop diagrams in four dimensions .",
    "a second dimensional scale is provided by the masses of the lightest excitations which have been `` integrated out '' as explicit dynamical degrees of freedom of the theory  in the present case , typically the lightest vector mesons . in a phenomenological approach",
    "the exchange of such particles leads to a propagator of the type @xmath54 , where the expansion only converges for @xmath55 .",
    "the corresponding scale is approximately of the same size as @xmath56 . assuming a reasonable behavior of the coefficients of the momentum expansion leads to the expectation that chpt converges for center - of - mass energies sufficiently below the @xmath11-meson mass",
    "of course , the validity of such a statement depends on the specific process under consideration and the quantum numbers of the intermediate states .    clearly , for a given process , it would be desirable to have an idea about the size of the next - to - leading - order corrections . in the odd - intrinsic - parity sector",
    "such a calculation is at least of order @xmath57 , because the wzw action itself is already of order @xmath43 .",
    "thus , according to weinberg s power counting , one - loop diagrams involving exactly one wzw vertex and an arbitrary number of @xmath41 vertices result in corrections of @xmath57 .",
    "several authors have shown that quantum corrections to the wess - zumino - witten classical action do not renormalize the coefficient of the wess - zumino - witten term .",
    "furthermore , the one - loop counter terms lead to conventional chirally invariant structures at @xmath57 .",
    "there have been several attempts to construct the most general odd - intrinsic - parity lagrangian at @xmath57 and only recently two independent calculations have found the same number of 23 independent structures in the su(3 ) sector @xcite . for an overview of the application of chpt to anomalous processes , the interested reader is referred to ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in general , next - to - leading - order corrections to processes in the even - intrinsic - parity sector are of @xmath43 . however , there are also processes which receive their leading - order contributions at @xmath43 . in particular ,",
    "the reactions @xmath58 and @xmath59 @xcite have received considerable attention , because the predictions at @xmath43 @xcite and @xcite , respectively , were in disagreement with experimental results ( @xcite and @xcite , respectively ) . in the case of @xmath58 loop corrections at @xmath57 lead to a considerably improved description , with the result only little sensitive to the tree - level diagrams at @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "the opposite picture emerges for the decay @xmath59 , where the tree - level diagrams at @xmath57 play an important role .",
    "a second class of @xmath57 calculations includes processes which already receive contributions at @xmath60 such as @xmath61 scattering @xcite or @xmath62 @xcite . here",
    ", @xmath57 calculations may be viewed as precision tests of chpt .",
    "the first process is of fundamental importance because it provides information on the mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking in qcd @xcite .",
    "the second reaction is of particular interest because an old current - algebra low - energy theorem @xcite relates the electromagnetic polarizabilities @xmath63 and @xmath64 of the charged pion at @xmath43 to radiative pion decay @xmath65 .",
    "corrections at @xmath57 were shown to be 12% and 24% of the @xmath43 values for @xmath63 and @xmath64 , respectively @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , experimental results for the polarizabilities scatter substantially and still have large uncertainties ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) and new experimental data are clearly needed to test the accuracy of the chiral predictions .    in the su(3 ) sector",
    ", the first construction of the most general even - intrinsic parity lagrangian at @xmath57 was performed in ref .  @xcite .",
    "although it was later shown that the original list of terms contained redundant structures @xcite , even the final number of 90 + 4 free parameters is very large , such that , in contrast to the lagrangian @xmath44 of gasser and leutwyler , it seems unlikely that all parameters can be fixed through comparison with experimental data .",
    "however , chiral symmetry relates different processes to each other , such that groups of interaction terms may be connected with each other and through comparison with experiment the consistency conditions of chiral symmetry may be tested .",
    "furthermore , the same theoretical methods which have been applied to predict the coefficients of @xmath43 may be extended to the next order @xcite which , however , involves much more work .",
    "chiral perturbation theory has proven to be highly successful in the mesonic sector and , for obvious reasons , one would like to have a generalization including the interaction of goldstone bosons with baryons .",
    "the group - theoretical foundations for a nonlinear realization of chiral symmetry were developed in refs .",
    "@xcite , which also included the coupling of goldstone bosons to other isospin or , for the more general case , su(@xmath66)-flavor multiplets .",
    "numerous low - energy theorems involving the pion - nucleon interaction and its su(3 ) extension were derived in the 1960 s by use of current - algebra methods and pcac . however , a _ systematic _ study of chiral corrections to the low - energy theorems has only become possible when the methods of mesonic chpt were extended to processes with one external nucleon line @xcite .",
    "the situation turned out to be more involved than in the pure mesonic sector because the loops have a more complicated structure due to the nucleon mass which , in contrast to the goldstone boson masses , does not vanish in the chiral limit .",
    "this introduces a third scale into the problem beyond the pion decay constant and the scalar quark condensate .",
    "in particular , it was shown that the relativistic formulation , at first sight , does not provide such a simple connection between the chiral expansion and the loop expansion as in the mesonic sector @xcite , i.e. , higher - order loop diagrams also contribute to lower orders in the chiral expansion of a physical quantity .",
    "this observation was taken as evidence for a breakdown of power counting in the relativistic formulation .",
    "subsequently , techniques borrowed from heavy - quark physics were applied to the baryon sector @xcite , providing a heavy - baryon formulation of chpt ( hbchpt ) , where the lagrangian is not only expanded in the number of derivatives and quark masses but also in powers of inverse nucleon masses .",
    "the technique is very similar to the foldy - wouthuysen method @xcite .",
    "there have been many successful applications of hbchpt to `` traditional '' current - algebra processes such as pion photoproduction @xcite and radiative pion capture @xcite , pion electroproduction @xcite , pion - nucleon scattering @xcite , to name just a few ( for an extensive overview , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in all these cases ,",
    "chpt has allowed one to either systematically calculate corrections to the old current - algebra results or to obtain new predictions which are beyond the scope of the old techniques .",
    "other applications include the calculation of static properties such as masses and various form factors of baryons @xcite .",
    "the role of the pionic degrees of freedom has been extensively discussed for real compton scattering off the nucleon in terms of the electromagnetic polarizabilities . the new frontier of virtual scattering off the nucleon @xcite has also been addressed in the framework of chpt @xcite . as in the mesonic sector ,",
    "the most general chiral lagrangian in the single - baryon sector is needed which , due to the spin degree of freedom , is more complicated @xcite .    in the baryonic sector ,",
    "the @xmath67 resonance plays a prominent role because its excitation energy is only about two times the pion mass and its ( almost ) 100 % branching ratio to the decay mode @xmath68 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the formalism of the so - called small scale expansion was developed , which also treats the nucleon - delta mass splitting as a `` small '' quantity like the pion mass .",
    "subsequently , the formalism was applied to compton scattering @xcite , baryon form factors @xcite , the @xmath69 transition @xcite and virtual compton scattering @xcite .",
    "while the heavy - baryon formulation provided a useful low - energy expansion scheme , it was realized in the context of the isovector spectral function entering the calculation of the nucleon electromagnetic form factor that the corresponding perturbation series fails to converge in part of the low - energy region @xcite .",
    "various methods have been suggested to generate a power counting which is also valid for the relativistic approach and which respects the singularity structure of green functions .",

    "@xcite decomposes one - loop diagrams into singular and regular parts .",
    "the singular parts satisfy power counting , whereas the regular parts can be absorbed into local counter terms of the lagrangian .",
    "this technique solves the power counting problem of relativistic baryon chiral perturbation theory at the one - loop level and has already been applied to the calculation of baryon masses in su(3 ) chpt @xcite , of form factors @xcite , pion - nucleon scattering @xcite as well as the generalized gerasimov - drell - hearn sum rule @xcite . at present",
    ", the procedure has not yet been generalized to higher - order loop diagrams . in ref .",
    "@xcite another approach , based on choosing appropriate renormalization conditions , was proposed , leading to the correct analyticity structure and a consistent power counting , which can also be extended to higher loops .",
    "finally , the techniques of effective field theory have also been applied to the nucleon - nucleon interaction ( see , e.g. , refs .   ) .",
    "clearly this is a very important topic in its own right but is beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) provides a systematic framework for investigating strong - interaction processes at _ low _ energies , as opposed to a perturbative treatment of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) at high momentum transfers in terms of the `` running coupling constant . ''",
    "the basis of chpt is the global @xmath70 symmetry of the qcd lagrangian in the limit of massless @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 quarks .",
    "this symmetry is assumed to be spontaneously broken down to @xmath34 giving rise to eight massless goldstone bosons . in this chapter",
    "we will describe in detail one of the foundations of chpt , namely the symmetries of qcd and their consequences in terms of qcd green functions .",
    "the group su(3 ) plays an important role in the context of strong interactions , because on the one hand it is the gauge group of qcd and , on the other hand , flavor su(3 ) is approximately realized as a global symmetry of the hadron spectrum ( eightfold way @xcite ) , so that the observed ( low - mass ) hadrons can be organized in approximately degenerate multiplets fitting the dimensionalities of irreducible representations of su(3 ) .",
    "finally , as will be discussed later in this chapter , the direct product @xmath21 is the chiral - symmetry group of qcd for vanishing @xmath4- , @xmath5- , and @xmath6-quark masses .",
    "thus , it is appropriate to first recall a few basic properties of su(3 ) and its lie algebra su(3 ) @xcite .    the group su(3 )",
    "is defined as the set of all unitary , unimodular , @xmath71 matrices @xmath47 , i.e.@xmath72 , dimensions .",
    "it should be clear from the respective context which dimensionality actually applies . ] and @xmath73 .",
    "in mathematical terms , su(3 ) is an eight - parameter , simply connected , compact lie group .",
    "this implies that any group element can be parameterized by a set of eight independent real parameters @xmath74 varying over a continuous range .",
    "the lie - group property refers to the fact that the group multiplication of two elements @xmath75 and @xmath76 is expressed in terms of eight _ analytic _ functions @xmath77 , i.e.  @xmath78 , where @xmath79 .",
    "it is simply connected because every element can be connected to the identity by a continuous path in the parameter space and compactness requires the parameters to be confined in a finite volume .",
    "finally , for compact lie groups , every finite - dimensional representation is equivalent to a unitary one and can be decomposed into a direct sum of irreducible representations ( clebsch - gordan series ) .",
    "elements of su(3 ) are conveniently written in terms of the exponential representation @xmath80 with @xmath81 real numbers , and where the eight linearly independent matrices @xmath82 are the so - called gell - mann matrices , satisfying @xmath83 an explicit representation of the gell - mann matrices is given by @xmath84 the set @xmath85 constitutes a basis of the lie algebra su(3 ) of su(3 ) , i.e. , the set of all complex traceless skew hermitian @xmath86 matrices .",
    "the lie product is then defined in terms of ordinary matrix multiplication as the commutator of two elements of su(3 ) .",
    "such a definition naturally satisfies the lie properties of anti - commutativity @xmath87=-[b , a]\\ ] ] as well as the jacobi identity @xmath88+[b,[c , a]]+[c,[a , b]]=0.\\ ] ] in accordance with eqs .",
    "( [ 2:1:uexp ] ) and ( [ 2:1:gmme1 ] ) , elements of su(3 ) can be interpreted as tangent vectors in the identity of su(3 ) .",

    "<S> this article provides a pedagogical introduction to the basic concepts of chiral perturbation theory and is designed as a text for a two - semester course on that topic . </S>",
    "<S> chapter 1 serves as a general introduction to the empirical and theoretical foundations which led to the development of chiral perturbation theory . </S>",
    "<S> chapter 2 deals with qcd and its global symmetries in the chiral limit ; the concept of green functions and ward identities reflecting the underlying chiral symmetry is elaborated . in chap .  </S>",
    "<S> 3 the idea of a spontaneous breakdown of a global symmetry is discussed and its consequences in terms of the goldstone theorem are demonstrated . </S>",
    "<S> chapter 4 deals with mesonic chiral perturbation theory and the principles entering the construction of the chiral lagrangian are outlined . </S>",
    "<S> various examples with increasing chiral orders and complexity are given . </S>",
    "<S> finally , in chap .  </S>",
    "<S> 5 the methods are extended to include the interaction between goldstone bosons and baryons in the single - baryon sector , with the main emphasis put on the heavy - baryon formulation . at the end , the method of infrared regularization in the relativistic framework is discussed . </S>"
