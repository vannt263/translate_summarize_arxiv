    "dichroism is the property of a material to absorb photon beams of different polarization with different cross - sections . in particular , x - ray magnetic circular dichroism ( xmcd ) originates from excitations of core electrons to unoccupied spin - split conduction states , giving rise to different absorption behavior of left and right polarized light .",
    "xmcd , together with x - ray absorption spectroscopy ( xas ) , is one of the most effective tools for obtaining information about magnetic systems .",
    "it exhibts different capabilities of characterizing these systems which can not be afforded by traditional magnetic techniques . among the advantages of xmcd",
    ", it is worth mentioning its high sensitivity and chemical selectivity , the latter being an essential property to study magnetism in alloys , oxides , impurities , surfaces , and interfaces .",
    "moreover , it represents one of the few methods which can discriminate between orbital and spin contribution to the total magnetic moment .",
    "information about spin and orbital magnetic moments , associated to the photo - absorbing atom are extracted from xmcd spectra , exploiting two specific sum rules @xcite which allow to extract the expectation value of the orbital and spin angular momentum operators , @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "we have developed a package for the calculation of x - ray absorption spectra at the k- , l- , and m - edges for left and right circularly polarized light in the wien2k code @xcite . more specific , we have extended the wien2k optic package @xcite , which allows to calculate optical properties .",
    "the matrix elements , which define the dependence of the photo - absorption cross - section on the polarization of light and on the sample magnetization , are calculated within the dipole approximation .    in the following",
    ", we will give an extensive description of the formulae behind the method .",
    "as prototypical examples , we have investigated dichroic and absorption spectra at the @xmath1 and @xmath0 edges of cerium in @xmath5 , which demonstrate the applicability of our code to such core excitations .",
    "xmcd is determined by the difference in absorption between left and right circularly polarized light , where left and right are referred to the propagation direction of incoming radiation with respect to the magnetization axis of the system . in particular ,",
    "photons are left ( right ) polarized or , equivalently , their helicity is @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) , when the direction of propagation is anti - parallel ( parallel ) with respect to the magnetization .    the absorption of a photon with polarization vector @xmath8 results in the excitation of a selected atom from an initial state @xmath9 into a final state @xmath10 . in the framework of the electric - dipole approximation ,",
    "the cross section @xmath11 for x - ray absorption is given by fermi s golden rule : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the matrix element of the momentum operator @xmath14 between the initial and final states of energy @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",

    "later , the same authors derived a second sum rule for the spin moment using graphical angular momentum techniques @xcite .",
