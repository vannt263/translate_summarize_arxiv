    "the standard approach to searching for the properties of subsystems of unstable particles makes use of more or less accurate approximate methods to solve evolution equation for such subsystems .",
    "a typical example of such methods are weisskopf  wigner ( ww ) approximation @xcite or lee  oehme  yang ( loy ) approximation @xcite .",
    "all intermediate steps of ww or loy approximations leading to the final formulae describing the time evolution of unstable particles are rather far from mathematical precision .",
    "what is more , attempts to confront the predicted properties of the considered systems , obtained within the use of such approximate methods , with those following from the analytical properties of the exact solutions of the quantum evolution equation are rather sporadic .",
    "these analytical properties can be extracted from properties of the transition amplitudes @xmath4 where @xmath5 , @xmath6 is the hilbert state space of the total system considered , and @xmath7 is the total unitary evolution equation solving the schrdinger equation @xmath8 ( we use @xmath9 units ) , @xmath10 is the unit operator in @xmath11 , @xmath12 @xmath13 is the initial state of the system , ( in our case @xmath14 ) , and @xmath15 is the total ( selfadjoint ) hamiltonian , acting in @xmath6 .",
    "amplitudes @xmath16 can be expressed in terms of the energy ( mass ) densities @xmath17 as follows @xmath18 assuming that the exact properties of real systems containing unstable particles are described by the exact solutions of eq .",
    "( [ schrod ] ) , properties of amplitudes @xmath16 following , eg . , from symmetries of the system under considerations can be used to examine properties of some parameters describing the unstable particles and obtained by means of @xmath16 following from approximate methods of calculations .",
    "a typical example is a subsystem of neutral mesons and properties of @xmath16 following from @xmath19 or @xmath20 invariance of @xmath15 , @xcite . moreover amplitudes @xmath16 are convenient for numerical simulations of time evolution of the states considered : it is sufficient to assume the form of the densities @xmath21 and then to use computer methods to find @xmath22 as a function of time @xmath1 .    in the case of neutral kaons ( neutral mesons in general )",
    "all known properties including cp and hypothetically possible cpt  violation effects in such complexes are described by solving the schrdinger  like evolution equation @xcite  @xcite , @xmath23 for @xmath24 belonging to the subspace @xmath25 , e.g. , spanned by orthonormal neutral kaons states @xmath26 , @xmath27 , ( then states corresponding to the decay products belong to @xmath28 ) , and nonhermitian effective hamiltonian @xmath29 obtained usually by means of the loy approach ( within the ww approximation ) @xcite , @xmath30 where @xmath31 are @xmath32 matrices , @xmath33 is the mass matrix and @xmath34 is the decay matrix .    within the ww approximation for a single particle subsystem the evolution equation has a similar form to ( [ l1 ] ) , @xmath35 where @xmath36 and _ dim _ @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 @xmath40 is the ww effective hamiltonian governing the time evolution in one dimensional subspace of states ( @xmath41 is the energy of the system in the state @xmath42 and @xmath43 is the decay width ) . in this case",
    "the amplitude @xmath16 , ( [ cmst - rho ] ) , can be replaced by @xmath44 and @xmath17 by @xmath45 , and here @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "the analysis of the models of the decay processes shows that the loy and ww effective hamiltonians appearing in ( [ l1 ] ) and ( [ ww-1 ] ) describe properties of two particle or single particle complexes to a very high accuracy for a wide time range @xmath1 : from @xmath1 suitably later than some @xmath47 but @xmath48 up to @xmath49 and smaller than the transition time @xmath50 , where @xmath51 denotes the time @xmath1 for which the nonexponential deviations of the survival probability begin to dominate .    in @xcite assuming that the spectrum of @xmath15 must be bounded from below , @xmath52 , and using the paley ",
    "wiener theorem @xcite it was proved that in the case of unstable states there must be @xmath53 for @xmath54 . here",
    "@xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "this means that the decay law @xmath57 of unstable states decaying in the vacuum can not be described by an exponential function of time @xmath1 if time @xmath1 is suitably long , @xmath58 , and that for these lengths of time @xmath59 tends to zero as @xmath2 more slowly than any exponential function of @xmath1 @xcite . from the model analysis it follows that in the general case the decay law @xmath59 takes the inverse power  like form @xmath60 , ( where @xmath61 ) , for suitably large @xmath62 .",
    "not long ago this effect was confirmed experimentally : in the experiment described in @xcite , the evidence of deviations from the exponential decay law at long times was reported .",
    "the conclusion is that the loy , ww and similar effective hamiltonians can not be used when one analysis a very long time properties of unstable systems .",
    "the aim of this paper is to analyze more accurate approximations for the effective hamiltonians governing the time evolution in subspace of unstable states than those given loy or ww formulae and to analyze very long time properties of the effective hamiltonian for an one particle subsystem .",
    "the approximate formulae for @xmath63 have been derived in @xcite  @xcite using the krolikowski ",

    "now let us consider a general case of @xmath0dimensional subspace @xmath91 .",
    "vectors from such subspaces describe states of @xmath0level ( @xmath0particle ) subsystems .",
    "the only problem is to calculate @xmath92 $ ] in ( [ v||=approx ] ) for the case of @xmath93 .",
    "note that it is convenient to consider such @xmath91 as the subspace spanned by a set of orthonormal vectors @xmath94 , @xmath95 .",
    "then the projection operator @xmath96 defining this subspace can be expressed as follows @xmath97    the operator @xmath98 is selfadjoint , so the @xmath99 matrix representing @xmath98 in the subspace @xmath100 is hermitian matrix . solving the eigenvalue problem for this matrix , @xmath101 one obtains the eigenvalues @xmath102 , and eigenvectors @xmath103 , @xmath104 . here for simplicity we assume that @xmath105 , etc .. in other words it is assumed that all @xmath106 are nondegenerate and thus all @xmath107 by means of these eigenvectors one can define new projection operators , @xmath108 the property ( [ l - jk ] ) of the solution of the eigenvalue problem for @xmath98 considered implies that @xmath109 and that the completeness requirement for the subspace @xmath110 @xmath111 holds .",

    "the simplest case is when the operator @xmath98 has @xmath0fold degenerate eigenvalue @xmath122 , that is when @xmath123 .",
    "then @xmath124 which gives @xmath125    the most interesting cases seem to be the cases when the eigenvalues @xmath106 of @xmath98 are @xmath126fold degenerate , where @xmath127",
    ". then the form of @xmath128 differs from ( [ v - n - fin ] ) and ( [ v - l-0 ] ) .",
    "so , let @xmath129 be the nondegenerate eigenvalues for @xmath98 and @xmath130",
    ". then @xmath131 ( here @xmath112 is given by the formula ( [ p - j ] ) ) and @xmath132 using this last relation and the general formula ( [ v||=approx ] ) for @xmath89 and then taking @xmath133 one finds @xmath134      let us pass on to @xmath136 case , i.e. to the case of two  dimensional subspace @xmath91 , which can be applied to neutral meson complexes .",
    "so , if @xmath137 , then the projector @xmath96 is defined by @xmath138 in the loy approach it is assumed that vectors @xmath139 , @xmath140 considered above are eigenstates of @xmath141 for a 2fold degenerate eigenvalue @xmath142 : @xmath143 where @xmath141 is the so called free hamiltonian , @xmath144 , and @xmath145 denotes weak and other interactions which are responsible for transitions between the eigenvectors of @xmath141 , i.e. , for the decay process .",
    "if @xmath15 has the following property @xmath146 that is for @xmath147 , the approximate formula ( [ v||=approx ] ) for @xmath115 leads to the following form of @xmath148 , @xmath149 and thus to @xmath150 which leads to @xmath151 this means that in the case ( [ p - h12=0 ] ) @xmath152 and @xmath153 .    on the other hand ,",

    "hence , by ( [ h||=def ] ) , @xmath163 . it should be emphasized that all components of the expressions ( [ v - jk ] ) are of the same order with respect to @xmath164",
    ".    formulae ( [ v - jk ] ) for matrix elements @xmath165 become much simpler if @xmath166 . also the symmetries of the system lead to simpler form of @xmath165 ( see eg .",

    "for example , these calculations show that the amplitude @xmath183 exhibits inverse power  law behavior at the late time region : @xmath189 .",
    "the same can be done for the derivative of @xmath177 and then using ( [ h(t ) ] ) a general asymptotic form of @xmath174 can be found .",
