    "the phenomenology of heavy flavour production attracts considerable theoretical and experimental interest .",
    "the theoretical framework for the description of heavy flavour production is the qcd improved parton model . besides the well - established nlo corrections to the inclusive production of heavy quark in hadron - hadron@xcite , hadron - photon@xcite , and photon - photon collisions@xcite ,",
    "much theoretical work has been done in the resummation of contributions enhanced in certain regions of phase space : the sudakov region , the large transverse momentum region and the small-@xmath0 region .",
    "the theoretical effort involved is justified by the large variety of applications that heavy quark production physics has , in top , bottom and charm production .",
    "besides the need of modeling these processes , heavy quark production is an important benchmark for testing qcd and parton model ideas , due to the relative complexity of the production process , the large range of masses available , and the existence of different production environments , like @xmath1 annihilation ,",
    "hadron - hadron , photon - hadron and photon - photon collisions .",
    "although the order of magnitude of the total cross sections , and the shape of differential distribution is reasonably predicted , in some areas large discrepancy are present , especially for @xmath2 production .",
    "top production@xcite has been a most remarkable success of the theoretical model .",
    "the measured cross section has been found in good agreement with theoretical calculations , as shown in fig .",
    "[ topxsec ] .",
    "resummation of soft gluon effects@xcite reduces the theoretical uncertainty in the cross section , pushing it toward the high side of the theoretical band .",
    "it remains , however , inside the theoretical band of the fixed order calculation , thus showing consistency with the estimated error .",
    "recently , the hera - b experiment has provided a new measurement of the @xmath3 total cross section@xcite .",
    "their result is in good agreement with previous findings@xcite .",
    "more details on this measurement have been given in saxon s talk@xcite . here",
    "i will only make some remarks on the theoretical aspects .",
    "this experiment is sensitive to the moderate transverse momentum region , where the bulk of the total cross section is concentrated . since the production is ( in a certain sense ) close to threshold , resummation of sudakov effects is important also in this case , and brings about a considerable reduction of the theoretical uncertainty@xcite .",
    "the hera - b result is compatible with the central value prediction , with the @xmath2 pole mass around @xmath4 gev .",
    "higher precision may constrain further the @xmath2 quark mass .",
    "the tevatron has had a longstanding disagreement with qcd in the @xmath2 transverse momentum spectrum .",
    "a recent publication of the @xmath5 differential cross section by cdf@xcite has quantified the disagreement as a factor of @xmath6 in the ratio of the measured cross section over the theoretical prediction .",
    "this discrepancy has been present since a long time , and it has been observed both in cdf and d0 .",
    "some authors@xcite have argued that the discrepancy could be interpreted as a signal for supersimmetry .    because of the large theoretical uncertainties , this discrepancy has been often downplayed .",
    "in fact , several effects may conspire to raise the @xmath2 cross section to an appropriate value : small-@xmath0 effects@xcite , threshold effects@xcite and resummation of large @xmath7 .",
    "it is not however clear whether these effect can be added up without overcounting .",
    "furthermore , they are all higher order effects , and thus should not push the cross section too far out of the theoretical band , which includes estimates of unknown higher order effects .    recently , a small-@xmath0 formalism@xcite has been implemented in a monte carlo program@xcite ( the cascade monte carlo ) , and it has been claimed that this programs correctly predicts the @xmath2 spectrum at the tevatron@xcite .",
    "although encouraging , this result should be regarded with a word of caution .",
    "the formalism involved only accounts for leading small @xmath0 effects , and does not correct for the lack of leading terms , that are known to be important for heavy flavour production at the tevatron regime .",
    "experience with other contexts where resummation techniques have been applied has taught us that it is not difficult to overestimate the importance of resummation effects , and much study is needed to reliably assess their importance@xcite .",
    "it has been observed since some time that an improper understanding of fragmentation effects may be one of the causes of the tevatron discrepancy .",
    "this possibility stems from the fact that @xmath2 quark cross sections are in reasonable agreement with the tevatron measurements of the @xmath8 meson spectrum , while the cross section obtained by applying a standard fragmentation function of the peterson form@xcite with @xmath9 to the quark cross section yields too soft a spectrum .",
    "it was suggested@xcite to study @xmath2 quark jets rather than @xmath8 meson s distributions .",
    "in fact , the jet momentum should be less sensitive to fragmentation effects than the hadron momentum .",
    "a d0 study @xcite has demonstrated that by considering @xmath2 jets instead of @xmath8 hadrons the agreement between theory and data improves considerably .    it was recently shown@xcite that an accurate assessment of fragmentation effects brings about a reduction of the discrepancy from the factor of 2.9 quoted by cdf to a factor of 1.7 .",
    "this remarkable reduction is essentially due to recent progress in fragmentation function measurements by lep experiments and the sld@xcite ( the current status of fragmentation measurements has been reviewed in boccali s talk@xcite ) , and by a particular method for extracting the relevant information about non - perturbative fragmentation effects from the @xmath1 data . here",
    "i will not enter in the details of the method , that have been described in@xcite .",
    "i will instead try to give an overall illustration of the main features of the method .",
    "first of all , strictly speaking , the description of fragmentation effects in terms of a fragmentation function ( i.e. , a probability distribution for an initial quark to hadronize into a hadron with a given fraction of its momentum ) is only valid at very large transverse momenta .",
    "one could then extract the fragmentation function from lep data , and use it in high @xmath10 @xmath8 production at the tevatron .",
    "unfortunately , the regime of large transverse momenta is not quite reached at the tevatron .",
    "for example , the differential cross section @xmath11 at the tevatron , for @xmath12 , computed at the nlo level including mass effects is @xmath13 , while in the massless approximation ( i.e. , neglecting terms suppressed as powers of @xmath14 ) is @xmath15 . at @xmath16",
    "we have @xmath17 for the full massive , and @xmath18 for the massless limit , which starts to approach the asymptotic value . as a rule of thumb ,",
    "the massless approximation starts to approach the massive one around @xmath19 .",
    "it does therefore make no sense to use any massless approach for @xmath20 . in earlier work on heavy quark production at large transverse momentum@xcite",
    ", this fact went unnoticed , since large higher order terms ( i.e. beyond the nlo level ) in the fragmentation function approach accidentally compensated for the lack of mass terms , thus giving the impression that the massless approach is good down to @xmath21 .",
    "in order to perform a calculation that is reliable in both the low and the high transverse momentum regime , we have thus to merge the massive nlo calculation with the fragmentation function approach .",
    "the merging point must therefore be around @xmath22 .",
    "a summary of the theoretical tools that have lead to the matched ( so called fonll ) approach are summarised as follows :    * single inclusive particle production in hadronic collisions@xcite .",
    "single hadron production are described in term of nlo single parton cross section convoluted with a nll fragmentation function ; * heavy quark fragmentation function@xcite ; a method for the computation of the heavy quark fragmentation function at all orders in perturbation theory is developed , and applied at nll .",
    "several applications in @xmath1 physics have appeared @xcite . * single inclusive heavy quark production at large @xmath23@xcite ; item 1 and 2",
    "are combined to give a nll resummation of transverse momentum logarithms in heavy quark production ; * fonll calculation of single inclusive heavy quark production ; item 3 is merged without overcounting with standard nlo calculations . this procedure has been implemented both in hadroproduction@xcite and in photoproduction@xcite .",
    "a summary of comparison of the fonll calculation with data is given in fig .",
    "[ bhadcn ] .",
    "more details on the cdf measurement have been given in saxon s talk .",
    "the comparison with d0 data ( still preliminary ) shows very good agreement , compared to the discrepancy of a factor of order 3 found in the d0 publication .",
    "the theory of heavy flavour production seems to give a good qualitative description of the available data . in the case of top production ,",
    "the comparison between theory and experiment is satisfactory also at a quantitative level .",
    "recent progress has taken place in the field of @xmath2 hadroproduction .",
    "the hera - b experiment has provided a cross section for @xmath2 production at relatively low cm energy .",
    "some progress in understanding the role of fragmentation has considerably reduced the longstanding problem of the @xmath2 momentum spectrum at the tevatron .",
    "major problems do remain in the ( perhaps less developed ) areas of bottom production in @xmath24 and @xmath25 collisions .",
    "discussion of these problems were reported in saxon s and achard s talk in this conference@xcite . in both contexts , while charm production seems to be reasonably well described by qcd , there is an excess of bottom production , which seems to be far out of the theoretical uncertainty band .",
    "these problems have been around for sometimes now . on the positive side ,",
    "the recent zeus measurements presented in@xcite seem to show a smaller discrepancy than previously found .",
