    "the discovery of magnetically induced electric polarization@xcite revealed a new aspect and a great application potential of geometrically frustrated spin systems.@xcite frustration often leads to complex incommensurate ( ic ) magnetic structures , which can break the inversion symmetry and thus overcome a fundamental restriction for the macroscopic electric polarization .",
    "depending on the magnetic order , the magnetoelectric ( me ) effect is associated with two types of exchange interaction . in collinear spin",
    "structures the me coupling is explained by changes of the isotropic exchange interaction leading to the exchange striction,@xcite whereas in spiral spin structures the antisymmetric part of the anisotropic exchange interaction is held responsible.@xcite despite the generally accepted phenomenological description,@xcite the microscopic picture of the me mechanism is much more complex and still lacks a unified explanation .",
    "in this paper we focus on the mechanism of the me coupling in fete@xmath0o@xmath1br,@xcite where electric polarization in the long - range ordered elliptical ic amplitude - modulated ( amod ) magnetic state was suggested to originate from phase shifts between the exchange - coupled amod magnetic waves and thus argued to differ from conventional me mechanisms .",
    "the system adopts a layered structure of [ fe@xmath3o@xmath4@xmath5 tetramer clusters connected via te@xmath6 ions.@xcite the magnetic lattice is composed of alternating antiferromagnetic fe@xmath7 ( @xmath8=5/2 ) spin chains coupled by frustrated interactions,@xcite which amount to @xmath91/3 of the dominant intrachain interaction @xmath10@xmath919k .",
    "two subsequent magnetic transitions were identified.@xcite the first , from paramagnetic to the high - temperature ic magnetic state ( ht - ic ) with a constant wave vector * q*@xmath11=(@xmath120.4660 ) , occurs at @xmath13=11k and is rapidly followed at @xmath14=10.5k by the second one into the low - temperature ic multiferroic state ( lt - ic ) .",
    "the elliptical ic amod order in the lt - ic phase is characterized by long axis of the ellipsis along the ( 1,@xmath151,0.2 ) direction in the @xmath16 orthonormal system ( used throughout the paper),@xcite and the magnetic wave vector that progressively changes from * q*@xmath11 to * q*@xmath17=(@xmath120.4630 ) , where it settles below @xmath18@xmath96k.@xcite the accompanying electric polarization , ascribed to the exchange striction of the interchain interactions , points along the @xmath19-axis.@xcite in contrast to the lt - ic state , the magnetic ordering in the ht - ic phase is still unknown and thus hampers the understanding why the electric polarization is absent in this phase and why it develops in the lt - ic phase.@xcite    using combined nuclear magnetic and quadrupolar resonance ( nmr and nqr , respectively ) , spherical neutron polarimetry ( snp ) , and neutron diffraction techniques , we solved the magnetic structure in the ht - ic phase . here",
    "the magnetic moments are , like in the lt - ic phase , sinusoidally modulated , but are now almost completely collinear with the @xmath20 axis .",
    "furthermore , our nqr results indicate changes of the electric - field gradient ( efg ) at the br sites below @xmath14 ( in the multiferroic lt - ic phase ) , corroborating the minute displacements of the te@xmath6 ions that manifest as a bulk electric polarization.@xcite comparison with the lt - ic magnetic structure implies that in the ht - ic state the phase shifts between certain magnetic amod waves are suppressed in accordance with the proposed me coupling mechanism.@xcite these phase shifts are thus most likely responsible for the lack of the electric polarization above @xmath14 .",
    "nmr and nqr measurements were performed on high - quality single crystals @xcite with an average size of @xmath21mm@xmath22 on a home - build spectrometer in the temperature range between 4 and 300k in zero magnetic field and at 4.7 and 9.4 t .",
    "spherical neutron polarimetry ( snp ) was performed at 10.7k on the same crystals using a mupad device on the triple axis spectrometer tasp ( @xmath23=3.2 ) at the swiss neutron spallation source ( sinq ) , paul scherrer institute ( psi ) , switzerland .",
    "intensities of the magnetic reflections at temperatures between 9.2 and 11k were collected at the same location using the single - crystal diffractometer trics ( @xmath23=2.32 ) .",
    "local - probe nqr and nmr experiments on @xmath24br and @xmath25br nuclei with the spin @xmath26=3/2 were chosen because , ( i ) in addition to a standard dipolar magnetic moment through which they detect the local magnetism , ( ii ) they also possess a quadrupole moment , making them sensitive to efg and thus highly susceptible even to the tiniest structural deformations . from the experimental point of view",
    ", however , this makes it very difficult to find the resonant frequency , since efg can vary within several orders of magnitude , depending on the details of the local br environment .",
    "in addition , in fete@xmath0o@xmath1br there are two crystallographically inequivalent br sites ; br@xmath27 that is coupled to a single magnetic fe@xmath7 ( @xmath8=5/2 ) ion , and br@xmath0 , interacting with three magnetic fe@xmath7 ions [ inset to fig.[nmr](b ) ] .      [ ! ]    .upper panel : dft calculated components of the electric - field gradient ( efg ) tensor @xmath28 given for the br@xmath27 and br@xmath0 sites in the @xmath16 coordinate system in units of 10@xmath29v / m@xmath30 .",
    "lower panel : the corresponding quadrupole splitting @xmath31=@xmath32 and axial asymmetry parameters @xmath33=@xmath34@xmath15@xmath35 .",
    "[ tabefg ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     encouraged by a very good agreement between the neutron scattering results and nqr data for the br@xmath27 site , we focus now on the more complicated br@xmath0 nqr spectrum .",
    "applying the same procedure , i.e. , fitting of the lt - ic nqr spectrum by adjusting the hyperfine coupling tensor ( the efg is reduced by 14% compared to dft calculations ) and considering the coupling with three different fe@xmath7 sites , each with its own hyperfine - coupling tensor , we manage to reproduce the main features of the br@xmath0 nqr spectrum as well [ bottom panel in fig.[fignqrsim](b ) ] . to ensure a proper scaling of the efg tensor , spectra for both isotopes",
    "were fitted simultaneously .",
    "our fitting results get even greater value when one considers that during such a broad frequency sweep the measured nqr intensity may significantly vary due to frequency - dependent sensitivity of the spectrometer and the use of several experimental setups .",
    "in addition , we note that the discrepancy between the experimental and the calculated spectrum can be also due to tiny modulation of the @xmath36 , which can result from the weak ic structural modulation found in snp study of the lt - ic phase.@xcite this further complication is beyond the scope of our simulations , but may explain why the @xmath24br@xmath0 and @xmath25br@xmath0 nqr spectra scaled by @xmath37 s do not match perfectly even when reduced @xmath36 in the lt - ic phase is considered [ inset in fig.[nqrhtltcomp](b ) ] .",
    "nevertheless , the derived hyperfine coupling tensors ( table[tabhyp ] ) can reproduce the width and the main spectral singularities also for the ht - ic phase [ black lines in the top panel in fig.[fignqrsim](b ) ] when the efg is increased by 2% compared to the lt - ic phase , in accordance with our previous observations [ figs.[nqrhtltcomp](b),(d ) ] .    for comparison , we plot also calculated spectra corresponding to the lt - ic magnetic structure with appropriately scaled magnetic moments to match the ht - ic values .",
    "for these the discrepancy from the experimental data is much more pronounced for both br sites [ light lines in fig.[fignqrsim ] ] .",
    "the overall agreement between the neutron diffraction and the nqr results thus offers a confirmation of the proposed magnetic structures in the lt - ic and the ht - ic phases .",
    "it also shows that the simplicity of the br@xmath0 nqr spectra in the ht - ic phase originates from a smaller size of the ordered magnetic moments and a changed orientation of spins , and not from the higher symmetry of the magnetic structure . finally , we note that the similarity between @xmath38 and @xmath39 for @xmath40=1,3 , i.e. , between the sites , related by the inversion symmetry , implies that even though the inversion symmetry is broken already by * q*@xmath11 , the system effectively reduces this effect by matching the relevant phases .",
    "the most important experimental finding of our study is that all crystal - symmetry relations are broken already by the ht - ic magnetic order , which should thus , in principle , also allow for the establishment of the electric polarization .",
    "this is in line with the first - order nature of the transition , suggested by the coexistence of the ht - ic and the paramagnetic phase in a narrow temperature range around @xmath13 ( fig.[fignqrspec ] ) .",
    "surprisingly , the electric polarization does not develop until the second magnetic transition into the lt - ic phase .",
    "in addition , the lack of the symmetry relations removes all limitations regarding its orientation , leaving no clue why the actual polarization points along the @xmath19 axis . the observed response , therefore , deviates from other multiferroics where the multiferroic phase evolves in two subsequent [ or one as in rbfe(moo@xmath3)@xmath0]@xcite continuous magnetic transitions and thus allows to exploit the phenomenological description of the me coupling to its full extent.@xcite in particular , in contrast to our case , continuous transitions preserve certain relations between the magnetic ordering in the multiferroic phase and the symmetries of the crystallographic space group , which enables predictions of the direction of the emergent electric polarization.@xcite    in fete@xmath0o@xmath1br , the electric polarization could , in principle , be associated with the reorientation of the magnetic moments from the ( 1 - 10 ) direction in the lt - ic phase towards the ( 010 ) direction in the ht - ic phase .",
    "however , such scenario would be most probably associated with the simultaneous reorientation of the electric polarization , which contradicts our previous results ( ref . ) showing that the orientation of the electric polarization is temperature independent in the entire lt - ic phase .",
    "a second possibility is that electric polarization is associated with the ellipticity in the lt - ic magnetic structure , which is again not very likely , as our refinement shows finite ellipticity also in the ht - ic phase .    to understand the absence of the electric polarization in the ht - ic phase",
    ", we thus compare the lt - ic and ht - ic magnetic structures in respect to the so - called _ magnetic - phase - shift _ me coupling mechanism , which predicts electric polarization @xmath42@xmath43@xmath44.@xcite here @xmath45 are the magnetic order parameters corresponding to a pair of the exchange - coupled amod magnetic waves , while @xmath46 denotes the phase shift between the two .",
    "generally , each of the six possible exchange interaction @xmath47 ( @xmath48=1 - 6)@xcite can be involved in the me coupling mechanism .",
    "we find , however , that on heating from the lt - ic to the ht - ic state @xmath46 changes towards @xmath49 or to 0 , i.e. , leading to @xmath42@xmath500 , only for @xmath48=4 .",
    "similar , but significantly weaker , trend is noticed for @xmath51 , which has been also highlighted before as the most likely candidate to drive the exchange striction.@xcite on the other hand , all changes corresponding to other @xmath48 s are rather irregular .",
    "these observations are further supported by the fact that the nqr spectrum for br@xmath0 , which is coupled to the @xmath52-bridging te@xmath3 ion , shows a pronounced change of @xmath36 and thus reveals tiny structural transformations , most likely related to the onset of the electric polarization .",
    "the above argumentation , therefore , suggests that the most coherent explanation of the magnetic ordering and its relation to the me coupling is provided by the  magnetic phase shift ",
    "mechanism involving @xmath52 and possibly @xmath51 exchange pathways .",
    "we have investigated the magnetic ordering in the ht - ic phase of the fete@xmath0o@xmath1br system by combining complementary neutron diffraction , nuclear quadrupolar and magnetic resonance techniques .",
    "we find that due to the first - order transition from the paramagnetic phase all crystal symmetries are broken already in the ht - ic phase , which makes it , from the symmetry point of view , equivalent to the multiferroic lt - ic phase .",
    "however , the ellipticity in the ht - ic phase is significantly reduced and the magnetic moments with sinusoidally modulated amplitudes align almost exactly along the @xmath20 axis .",
    "furthermore , the phase shifts between the magnetic amod waves , corresponding to the @xmath52 exchange interaction , converge towards @xmath53 or @xmath49 , which according to the _ magnetic - phase - shift _ me coupling mechanism@xcite yields @xmath54@xmath500 , and could thus explain why the electric polarization vanishes in the ht - ic phase.@xcite in addition , changes of the efg at the br@xmath0 site in the lt - ic phase imply minute displacements of the te@xmath6 ions , which must be associated with the emergent electric polarization .",

    "usually the nmr and nqr absorption lines are calculated for the two limiting cases . in case of nmr experiment , zeeman term in the nuclear spin hamiltonian",
    "is typically taken as the dominant one , whereas electric quadrupole effects are considered as a perturbation .",
    "on the other hand , for nqr , so - called zeeman perturbed electric quadrupole hamiltonian is assumed . in the case of fete@xmath0o@xmath1br , however , the nqr frequencies are comparable to the nmr ones and thus exclude the possibility to use simple perturbative approaches . therefore , our approach to calculate the resonance frequencies and their intensities is based on the exact diagonalization@xcite of the complete hamiltonian for magnetic resonance of quadrupolar nuclei @xcite @xmath55 here @xmath56 denotes the zeeman term , @xmath57 the quadrupole interaction , and @xmath58 and @xmath59 the influence of the hyperfine and dipolar fields , respectively .",
