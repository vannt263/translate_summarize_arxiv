    "in those areas of particle phenomenology which require addressing non - perturbative effects , lattice qcd plays an increasingly significant role , being a first - principles method .",
    "the rapid advances in computational performance as well as algorithmic techniques are allowing for better control of various errors associated with lattice calculations .    in this paper",
    "we address the phenomenology of @xmath3 decays .",
    "one of the long - standing puzzles is the `` @xmath0 rule '' , which is the observation that the transition channel with isospin changing by 1/2 is enhanced 22 times with respect to transitions with isospin changing by 3/2 .",
    "the strong interactions are essential for explaining this effect within the standard model .",
    "since the energy scales involved in these decays are rather small , computations in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) have to be done using a non - perturbative method such as lattice qcd .",
    "namely , lattice qcd is used to calculate hadronic matrix elements of the operators appearing in the effective weak hamiltonian",
    ".    there have been so far several other attempts to study matrix elements of the operators relevant for @xmath0 rule on the lattice  @xcite , but they fell short of desired accuracy .",
    "in addition , several groups  @xcite have studied matrix elements @xmath4 , which describe only @xmath5 , not @xmath0 transition . in the present simulation ,",
    "the statistics is finally under control for @xmath0 amplitude .",
    "our main work is in calculating matrix elements @xmath6 and @xmath7 for all basis operators ( introduced in sec .",
    "[ sec : framework ] ) .",
    "this is enough to recover matrix elements @xmath8 using chiral perturbation theory in the lowest order , although this procedure suffers from uncertainties arising from ignoring higher orders ( in particular , final state interactions ) .",
    "the latter matrix elements are an essential part of the phenomenological expressions for @xmath0 and amplitudes , as well as @xmath1 .",
    "the ratio of the amplitudes computed in this way confirms significant enhancement of @xmath0 channel , although systematic uncertainties preclude a definite answer .",
    "in addition , we address a related issue of @xmath1  the direct cp - violation parameter in the neutral kaon system . as of the day of writing ,",
    "the experimental data are somewhat ambiguous about this parameter : the group at cern ( na48 )  @xcite reports @xmath9 while the fermilab group  @xcite has found @xmath10 there is a hope that the discrepancy between the two reports will soon be removed in a new generation of experiments .    on the theoretical side , the progress in estimating @xmath1 in the standard model",
    "is largely slowed down by the unknown matrix elements  @xcite of the appropriate operators .",
    "the previous attempts  @xcite to compute them on the lattice did not take into account operator matching . in this work",
    "we repeat this calculation with better statistics and better investigation of systematic uncertainties .",
    "we are using perturbative operator matching .",
    "in some cases it does not work , so we explore alternatives and come up with a partially non - perturbative renormalization procedure .",
    "the associated errors are estimated to be large .",
    "this is currently the biggest stumbling block in computing @xmath1 .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in the section  [ sec : framework ]",
    "we show the context of our calculations , define the quantities we are looking after and discuss a number of theoretical points relevant for the calculation .",
    "section  [ sec : lattice details ] discusses issues pertaining to the lattice simulation . in section  [ sec : di12 ] we present the results and discuss systematic errors for @xmath0 rule amplitudes . in section  [ sec : pert ] we explain how the operator matching problem together with other systematic errors preclude a reliable calculation of @xmath1 , and give our best estimates for this quantity in section  [ sec : epsp_res ] .",
    "section  [ sec : conclusion ] contains the conclusion . in the appendix",
    "we give details about the quark operators and sources , and provide explicit expressions for all contractions and matrix elements for reference purposes .",
    "the standard approach to describe the problems in question is to use the operator product expansion at the @xmath11 scale and use the renormalization group equations to translate the effective weak theory to more convenient scales ( @xmath12  24  gev ) . at these scales the effective hamiltonian for @xmath13 decays is the following linear superposition  @xcite : @xmath14 o_i ( \\mu )    \\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are wilson coefficients ( currently known at two - loop order ) , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 are basis of four - fermions operators defined as follows : @xmath19 here @xmath20 and @xmath21 are color indices , @xmath22 is quark electric charge , and summation is done over all light quarks .",
    "isospin amplitudes are defined as @xmath23 where @xmath24 are the final state interaction phases of the two channels .",
    "experimentally @xmath25    direct cp violation parameter @xmath26 is defined in terms of imaginary parts of these amplitudes : @xmath27 experiments are measuring the quantity @xmath28 , which is given by @xmath29 , \\ ] ] where @xmath30 with @xmath31 , and where @xmath32 takes into account the effect of isospin breaking in quark masses ( @xmath33 ) . @xmath34 and @xmath35 are isospin 0 and 2 parts of the basis operators .",
    "their expressions are given in the appendix for completeness .",
    "the effective hamiltonian given above is obtained in the continuum theory in which the top , bottom and charm quarks are integrated out .",
    "( in particular , the summation in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : ops3][eq : ops10 ] ) is done over @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 quarks . )",
    "this makes sense only when the scale @xmath39 is sufficiently low compared to the charm quark mass . as mentioned in ref .",
    "@xcite , at scales comparable to @xmath40 higher - dimensional operators can contribute considerably .",
    "then one should consider an expanded set of operators including those containing the charm quark .",
    "lattice treatment of the charm quark is possible but in practice quite limited , for example by having to work at much smaller lattice spacings and having a more complicated set of operators and contractions .",
    "therefore we have opted to work in the effective theory in which the charm quark is integrated out .",
    "since we typically use @xmath41  gev in our simulations , this falls into a dangerous region .",
    "we hope that the effects of higher - dimensional operators can still be neglected , but strictly speaking this issue should be separately investigated .",
    "as was shown by martinelli and testa  @xcite , two - particle hadronic states are very difficult to construct on the lattice ( and in general , in any euclidean description ) .",
    "we have to use an alternative procedure to calculate the matrix elements appearing in eqs .",
    "( [ amp],[p0],[p2 ] ) .",
    "we choose the method  @xcite in which the lowest - order chiral perturbation theory is used to relate @xmath43 to matrix elements involving one - particle states : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the lowest - order pseudoscalar decay constant .",
    "the masses in the first of these formulae are the physical meson masses , while the quark masses and the momenta in the second and third formulae are meant to be from actual simulations on the lattice ( done with unphysical masses ) .",
    "these relationships ignore higher order terms in the chiral expansion , most importantly the final state interactions .",
    "therefore this method suffers from a significant uncertainty .",
    "golterman and leung  @xcite have computed one - loop correction for @xmath5 amplitude in chiral perturbation theory .",
    "they find this correction can be large , up to 30% or 60% , depending on the values of unknown contact terms and the cut - off .",
    "eqs .  ( [ eq : chpt1][eq : chpt3 ] ) handle unphysical @xmath46 mixing in @xmath47 by subtracting the unphysical part proportional to @xmath7 .",
    "this is equivalent to subtracting the operator @xmath48 as shown by kilcup , sharpe _",
    "et al . _ in refs .",
    "@xcite , these statements are also true on the lattice if one uses staggered fermions . a number of ward identities discussed in these references show that lattice formulation with staggered fermions retains the essential chiral properties of the continuum theory . in particular , @xmath49 defined in eq .",
    "[ eq : subop ] is the only lower - dimensional operator appears in mixing with the basis operators .",
    "( lower - dimensional operators have to be subtracted non - perturbatively since they are multiplied by powers of @xmath50 . )",
    "we employ the non - perturbative procedure suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath51 where @xmath52 are found from @xmath53 this procedure is equivalent to the lattice version of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : chpt1][eq : chpt3 ] ) and allows subtraction timeslice by timeslice .    throughout our simulation",
    "we use only degenerate mesons , i.e. @xmath54 . since only negative parity part of @xmath49 contributes in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sub2 ] ) , one naively expects infinity when calculating @xmath52 .",
    "however , matrix elements @xmath7 of all basis operators vanish when @xmath55 due to invariance of both the lagrangian and all the operators in question under the cps symmetry , which is defined as the cp symmetry combined with interchange of @xmath38 and @xmath37 quarks .",
    "thus calculation of @xmath52 requires taking the first derivative of @xmath7 with respect to @xmath56 . in order to evaluate the first derivative numerically",
    ", we insert another fermion matrix inversion in turn into all propagators involving the strange quark .",
    "detailed expressions for all contractions are given in the appendix .",
    "according to eqs .",
    "( [ eq : sub1],[eq : sub2 ] ) , we need to compute three diagrams involving four - fermion operators ( shown in fig .",
    "[ diagrams ] ) and a couple of bilinear contractions .",
    "the `` eight '' contraction type ( fig .",
    "[ diagrams]a ) is relatively cheap to compute .",
    "it is the only contraction needed for the @xmath5 amplitude .",
    "the `` eye '' and `` annihilation '' diagrams ( fig .",
    "[ diagrams]b and  [ diagrams]c ) are much more expensive since they involve calculation of propagators from every point in space - time .      the parameters of simulation are listed in the table  [ tab : parameters ] .",
    "we use periodic boundary conditions in both space and time .",
    "our main `` reference '' ensemble is a set of quenched configurations at @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "in addition , we use an ensemble with a larger lattice volume ( @xmath59 ) , an ensemble with @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) for checking the lattice spacing dependence , and an ensemble with 2 dynamical flavors ( @xmath62 ) generated by the columbia group , used for checking the impact of quenching .",
    "the ensembles were obtained using 4 sweeps of @xmath63 overrelaxed and 1 sweep of @xmath63 heatbath algorithm .",
    "the configurations were separated by 1000 sweeps , where one sweep includes three @xmath63 subgroups updates ."
