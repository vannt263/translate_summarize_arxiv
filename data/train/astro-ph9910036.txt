    "seyfert nuclei are typical active galactic nuclei ( agn ) in the nearby universe and their central engine is thought to be gas accretion onto a supermassive black hole ( e.g. , rees 1984 ; blandford 1990 ) .",
    "the seyfert nuclei have been broadly classified into two types based on the presence or absence of broad emission - line region ( blr ) in their optical spectra ( khachikian & weedman 1974 ) ; seyferts with blr are type 1 ( hereafter s1 ) while those without blr are type 2 ( s2 ) .",
    "these two types of seyfert nuclei are now unified by introducing the viewing angle dependence toward the central engine given that a geometrically and optically - thick , dusty torus surrounds the central engine ( antonucci & miller 1985 ; see for a review antonucci 1993 ) .",
    "in addition to typical s1s and s2s , narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxies ( nls1s ) have also been recognized to comprise a distinct class of seyfert nuclei since davidson & kinman ( 1978 ) noticed their particular observational properties [ koski 1978 ; phillips 1978 ; osterbrock & pogge 1985 ( hereafter op85 ) ; halpern & oke 1987 ; van groningen & de bruyn 1989 ; puchnarewicz et al",

    "it is necessary to understand what nls1s are and their relation to typical s1s and s2s .    in this paper , we give a summary of important observational properties of nls1s ( section 2 ) and possible models for nls1s ( section 3 ) .",
    "several observational tests are made in section 4 .",

    "as summarized in section 3 , there are seven possible models for the nls1s .",
    "since there are many interesting observational properties of the nls1s as summarized in section 2 , we can make various observational tests to reject some models .",
    "the distant - blr model requires that the radial distance of the blr is more distant than the typical value for bls1s ; i.e. , @xmath41 pc ( e.g. , peterson 1993 ) .",
    "if we adopt a radial distance of the blr of nls1s @xmath42 pc , we obtain a maximum line width fwhm@xmath43(blr ) @xmath44 km s@xmath20 where @xmath45 is the keplerian rotational velocity and @xmath46 is the mass of the supermassive black hole in units of @xmath47 .",
    "thus this model explains the narrow line widths of the blr emission .",
    "however , robinson ( 1995 ) found that the profiles of blr emission of nls1s are generally different from those of bls1 ; i.e. , a normal broad - line profile has a more dominant core than a nls1 profile [ o2 ] .",
    "this property can not be explained by the distant - blr model .",
    "the optical monitoring observations of nls1s promoted by giannuzzo and coworkers have shown that there is no significant difference between the optical variability properties of nls1s and bls1s [ o4 ] .",
    "this provides also evidence against the distant - blr model .",
    "recently , wandel & boller ( 1998 ) proposed a theoretical basis for the distant - blr model ; a stronger photoinizing continuum present in nls1s can be responsible for the ionization of blr clouds at larger radii where the keplerian velocities are lower .",
    "however , in their model , it is not well understood why only nls1s have such stronger - photoinizing continua .",
    "therefore , in order to accept this model , one will have to explain the origin of the stronger continuum emission .",
    "furthermore , if we adopt this model , the number ratio between nls1s and bls1s can be attributed to a variety of the radial distance of blr in seyfert nuclei",
    ". there may be many parameters to determine @xmath48 in each seyfert ; the dynamical stability of a rotating gaseous disk ( or a ring ) around a smbh , the angular momentum of the blr gas , the phase of gas accretion , and so on .",
    "therefore , at present , this model may not give a self - consistent explanation of nls1s .",
    "it has been considered that the intense soft x - ray emission can prevent the formation of the blr clouds close to the central engine ( guilbelt , fabian , & mccray 1983 ; white , fabian , & mushotzky 1984 ) . however , although there is no evidence for the blr in the optical spectra of nls1s , rodrguez - pascual et al .",
    "( 1997 ) found the blue wing emission in uv emission lines , ly@xmath24 and c iv@xmath91549 [ u2 ] . since the line widths of the blue wing emission amount to @xmath21 5000 km s@xmath20 , it turns out that the nls1s observed by them have the blr",
    "accordingly , we can reject the no - blr model .",
    "however , one problem remains .",
    "why do only uv lines show evidence for the blr while there is no evidence for the blr in the optical ?",
    "since the uv blr shows the blue wing emission , it is likely that the uv blr is associated with some outflow activity .",
    "this means that there are two kinds of blr ; one is the disk - like blr which emits optical blamer lines and the other is the jet - like blr which emits uv blr emission lines like ly@xmath24 and c iv ( see section 7.2 for more detail ) .",

    "then we obtain an intrinsic fwhm of the blr in bls1s ,    @xmath64    it is noted that this intrinsic fwhm is almost comparable to a typical fwhm of the double - peaked blr ( eracleous & halpern 1994 ) .",
    "we examine whether or not the simple keplerian rotation is responsible for this line width .",
    "if we adopt @xmath65 and @xmath66 pc , we obtain fwhm@xmath43(blr ) = 2 @xmath67 km s@xmath20 where @xmath46 is the black hole mass in units of @xmath47 and @xmath68 is the radial distance of the blr from the galactic nucleus in units of 0.01 pc .",
    "the mass of supermassive black holes in bls1s lies in a range between @xmath47 and @xmath52 ( e.g. , miyoshi et al . 1995 ; greenhill et al . 1996 ; nishiura & taniguchi 1998 and references therein ) .",
    "if we adopt @xmath69 , we obtain    @xmath70    the following combinations also give the same fwhm@xmath43(blr ) ; ( @xmath36 , @xmath48 ) = ( @xmath47 , 0.001 pc ) , and ( @xmath71 , 0.003 pc ) . therefore , the intrinsic fwhm for the blr appears to be explained by the disk rotation without invoking other motions .",
    "next we consider why fwhm(blr ) @xmath72 km s@xmath20 for nls1s for the following two cases : 1 ) the pole - on view model , and 2 ) the low-@xmath36 model .",
    "\\1 ) the pole - on view model : this model implies that the observed narrow fwhms for nls1s are attributed to smaller viewing angles toward the blr .",
    "therefore , given the intrinsic fwhm of the blr in s1s fwhm@xmath43(blr ) @xmath19 12000 km s@xmath20 with the typical fwhm(blr ) @xmath19 1000 km s@xmath20 for the nls1s , we obtain a critical viewing angle toward nls1s @xmath73 sin@xmath20 ( 1000 km s@xmath20/12000 km s@xmath20 ) @xmath74 ; i.e. , @xmath75 for nls1s . on the other hand , if we adopt the maximum value of fwhm(blr ) @xmath19 2000 km s@xmath20 for nls1s ( vaughan et al .",
    "1999 ) , we obtain @xmath76 .",
    "this seems to be a more appropriate estimate .",
    "\\2 ) the low-@xmath36 model : if we adopt @xmath77 , we obtain fwhm@xmath43(blr ) @xmath78 km s@xmath20 .",
    "since the optical reverberation mapping shows that the shortest variability timescale is about one week , i.e. , corresponding to a linear dimension @xmath40 0.01 pc ( e.g. , peterson 1993 ) , the mass of smbhs is required to be less massive than @xmath79 . the dynamical mass of nuclei has been estimated for a number of bls1s ( wandel & yahil 1985 ; padovani & rafanelli 1988 ; padovani , burg , & edelson 1989 ; padovani 1989 ; koratkar & gaskell 1991 ) and for s2s with the hidden blr ( nishiura & taniguchi 1998 ) . however , there is no dynamical estimate for the nuclei of nls1s .",
    "recently hayashida et al . (",
    "1998 ; see also hayashida 1997 ) proposed a new method to estimate the central black hole masses based on the x - ray flux variability .",
    "they obtained @xmath80 for one of nls1s , ngc 4051 . this mass is smaller by two or three orders of magnitude than the typical mass of seyfert nuclei",
    "indeed , the recent reverberation mapping gives @xmath81 for ngc 4051 ( wandel , peterson , & malkan 1999 ) .",
    "it is noted that their method tends to give a smaller mass than the dynamical method ( e.g. , koratkar & gaskell 1991 ) .",
    "for example , hayashida et al . (",
    "1998 ) obtained @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 for ngc 4151 , ngc 5548 , and 3c 273 , respectively . on the other hand ,",
    "koratkar & gaskell ( 1991 ) obtained @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and @xmath87 for the same galaxies .",
    "although we do not know which method is more reliable , it will be necessary to estimate the black hole mass for both bls1s and nls1s with a consistent manner .",
    "stephens ( 1989 ) show that nls1s share @xmath21 10% of s1s based on optical spectroscopy of 65 hard x - ray selected agn .",
    "the number of nls1s has been increasing by means of soft x - ray surveys of agn ( puchnarewicz et al .",
    "1992 , 1996 ; bbf96 ; xu et al . 1999 ) . indeed ,",
    "nls1s comprise about half of the agn in soft x - ray selected samples ( grupe et al .",
    "1999 ; edelson et al .",
    "1999 ) . however , since soft x - ray photons are easily absorbed by dense gas clouds in nuclear regions of seyfert galaxies ( e.g. , awaki et al .",
    "1991 ) , any soft x - ray selected samples tend to miss such obscured agn , giving rise to the overabundance of both nls1s and bls1s .",
    "hard x - ray , radio , or optical surveys are more useful for any statistical considerations .",
    "therefore , we adopt the fraction obtained by stephens ( 1989 ) .      if we adopt the pole - on view model for nls1s , the fraction of nls1s gives a critical viewing angle to nls1s statistically by the following relation ,    @xmath88    where @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and @xmath91 are the numbers of nls1s , bls1s , and s2s , respectively . according to stephens ( 1989 ) , we have    @xmath92    the number ratio between s1s and s2s is obtained by the following surveys ; 0.125 ( osterbrock & shaw 1988 ) , 0.20 ( salzer 1989 ) , and 0.435 ( huchra & burg 1992 ) .",
    "note that these ratios are corrected for the completeness of the individual surveys .",
    "the simple average of the three surveys gives @xmath93 .",
    "it is noted that this ratio gives a critical viewing angle to bls1s is @xmath94 .",
    "this value is almost consistent with the opening angle of nlrs ; @xmath95 ( pogge 1989 ) , @xmath96 ( wilson & tsvetanov 1994 ) , and @xmath97 ( schmitt & kinney 1996 )",
    ". therefore , the above average ratio appears reasonable .",
    "since nls1s are included in the samples of s1s , we adopt    @xmath98    using equations ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) , and ( 3 ) , we obtain @xmath99 .",
    "although this value is slightly larger than the previous estimate based on the kinematical considerations [ @xmath100 for fwhm(blr ) = 1000 km s@xmath20 and @xmath101 for fwhm(blr ) = 2000 km s@xmath20 ] , there may be no serious inconsistency between the two estimates if the observational ambiguities in both the estimates are taken into account .",
    "if we adopt the low-@xmath36 model , the number ratio between nls1s and bls1s can be attributed to the mass function of smbhs in seyfert nuclei .",
    "therefore , a direct way to prove this model is to show that nls1s have systematically lower black hole masses than bls1s .",
    "however , as mentioned in section 5.3 , there is no reliable comparison of the black hole mass between nls1s and bls1s .",
    "recent high - resolution optical spectroscopy observations have shown that smbhs with @xmath104 are present in nearby galaxies and there is a relationship between the smbh mass and the spheroidal mass of galaxies ; i.e. , @xmath105 ( kormendy et al . 1998 ) .",
    "it will become important to compare the spheroidal mass between nls1s and bls1s host galaxies .",
    "as described in section 4 , it is hard to discriminate which model is more plausible among the two , the pole - on view model or the low-@xmath36 one . here",
    "it is remembered that there are two important correlations ( section 2 ) ; [ o7 ] the correlation between fe ii / h@xmath3 intensity ratio and the fwhm of h@xmath3 emission ; weak fe ii emitters always have larger fwhms but stronger fe ii emitters have either larger or smaller fwhms , and [ x2 ] the correlation between the soft x - ray spectral index and the fwhm of h@xmath3 emission ; s1s with larger fwhm(h@xmath3 ) ( i.e. , bls1s ) always have flat spectra but s1s with smaller fwhm(h@xmath3 ) ( i.e. , nls1s ) emitters have either steep or flat spectra .",
    "if we adopt the low-@xmath36 , a tunable parameter is only the black hole mass .",
    "it seems difficult to explain the above two correlations by tuning only @xmath36 . on the other hand ,",
    "the pole - on view model has the viewing - angle dependence which is known to affect the visibility of some emission line components because of the effect of selective obscuration .",
    "although it is natural that there is a scatter in @xmath36 from galaxy to galaxy , we try to find a possible model adopting the viewing angle as the primary parameter .",
    "we begin our model with a question ; `` where is the fe ii emitting region ? \"",
    "the reason for this is that the fe ii emission is unusually strong in nls1s with respect to bls1s [ o7 ] .",
    "it has been often considered that the fe ii emission arises from partly ionized regions heated by x - ray photons ( ferland & netzer 1979 ; kwan & krolik 1981 ) .",
    "since s2s show no fe ii features in the optical spectra , the current unified model for seyfert nuclei suggests that the fe ii emitting regions should be inside the dusty tori .",
    "therefore , the most natural place is considered to be optically - thick ionization - bounded clouds located in the blr ( collin - souffrin & lasota 1988 ; collin - souffrin , hameury , & joly 1988 ; marziani et al .",
    "1996 ; dultzin - hacyan et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "one of the important observational properties of nls1s is the evidence for the blue wing emission in uv emission lines , ly@xmath24 and c iv@xmath91549 [ u2 ] .",
    "since their line widths amount to @xmath21 5000 km s@xmath20 , there is a highly - ionized blr ( hereafter hi - blr ) even in nls1s .",
    "it has been suggested that the hi - blr is associated with the jet - like blr ( marziani et al .",
    "1996 ; dultzin - hacyan et al .",
    "1999 ; see also sulentic et al .",
    "marziani et al .",
    "( 1996 ) present the first direct comparison between the hi - blr ( e.g. , c  iv ) and the low - ionization blr ( hereafter li - blr ) ( e.g. , h@xmath3 ) for a sample of 52 radio - quiet agn .",
    "they found the following correlations ; the c  iv equivalent width ew(c  iv ) decreases with ( a ) increasing blueshift of c  iv relative to h@xmath3 ( broad component ) , ( b ) increasing strength of the optical fe  ii multiplets , and ( c ) increasing strength of the optical - uv continuum .",
    "these correlations and the systematic nature of the c  iv blueshift relative to h@xmath3 suggest a model where : ( i ) c  iv emitting clouds show a predominance of radial motion ( outflow because it is assumed that the far side is obscured ) in a bi - conical ( and/or disk wind ) structure with a wide opening angle ; i.e. , the jet - like blr .",
    "( ii ) fe  ii optical emission arises in a flattened distribution ( possibly an accretion disk ) ; i.e. , the disk - like blr , and ( iii ) h@xmath3 arises in a different and less flattened distribution .    taking these properties into account , we adopt the following simple two - component blr model in the later discussion ; 1 ) the disk - like blr in which fe ii and h@xmath3 arise , and 2 ) the jet - like blr in which c iv and ly@xmath24 arise ( see figure 1 ) . even in the disk blr ,",
    "the gas is distributed in a clumpy form because the volume filling factor in the blr is generally low ; e.g. , @xmath106 ( peterson 1997 ) .",
    "if we assume that each blr cloud has a spherical form , the outer surface facing to the central engine is highly ionized ( e.g. , pier & voit 1995 ) . therefore , it is considered that the fe ii emitting region is partly ionized zones which are shaded by highly- and intermediately - ionized zones from the central engine .",
    "a possible formation mechanism of partly - ionized regions in the disk - like blr will be discussed in section 7.4 .",
    "there is no direct information about the optical depth from the central engine toward the fe ii emitting region .",
    "however , we can infer it using observations and theoretical considerations on infrared ca ii triplet lines at 8498  , 8542  , and 8662    ( persson 1988 ; ferland & persson 1989 ; joly 1989 ) which are also considered to arise from the same partly - ionized regions as those of the fe ii emission ( dultzin - hacyan et al .",
    "1999 ; taniguchi et al .",
    "1999 ) . comparing photoionization models with the observations , ferland & persson ( 1989 ) found that optically thin clouds with column densities @xmath107 @xmath1 can not reproduce the observed ca ii triplet line ratios regardless of density and ionization parameters .",
    "the observed ca ii spectra can be reproduced if @xmath0 @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , the visibility of the partly - ionized regions is expected to be strongly viewing - angle dependent .",
    "if we observe this disk - like blr from an inclined viewing angle ( e.g. , @xmath108 ) , the fe ii emitting region located in the far - side half disk can not be seen entirely because of the large optical depth . on the other hand ,",
    "the h@xmath3 emission can be seen from the entire blr disk because the ionized hydrogen is located in the outer surfaces of blr clouds . on the other hand ,",
    "if we observe the disk - like blr from a nearly pole - on view , we can see both fe ii and h@xmath3 , resulting in a higher fe ii / h@xmath3 ratios together with narrower line width with respect to those observed from an inclined viewing angle ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "this explains the anti - correlation between the fe ii / h@xmath3 ratio and the fwhm(h@xmath3 ) [ o7 ] .",
    "however , we note that the present model explains only a factor of two difference in the fe ii / h@xmath3 ratio while the observed ratio lies in a wider range between @xmath40 0.1  @xmath40 3 ( e.g. , joly 1991 ) .",
    "as mentioned before , the fe ii emitting regions are thought to be very optically thick . in order to explain the observed range",
    ", sophisticated photoionization models will be necessary ( see section 7.4 ) .",
    "another concern is that the present model can not explain directly why there are nls1s with both weaker fe ii / h@xmath3 ratios and narrower line widths although it explains the anti - correlation [ o7 ] .",
    "here it is again noted that the fe ii emitting regions are expected to be optically very thick .",
    "it seems difficult to observe the fe ii emitting regions in some nls1s even if we see the disk - like blr from a nearly pole - on view .",
    "alternatively , some nls1s may have a smaller volume of the partly - ionized region in the blr .",
    "although we can not rule out another possibility that a variety in fwhm(h@xmath3 ) is partly controlled by the mass of smbhs ; i.e. , some s1s have lower @xmath36 than typical s1s ( the low-@xmath36 model ) , it is not necessarily to introduce this idea to explain the observed relationship between the fe ii / h@xmath3 ratio and fwhm(h@xmath3 ) .      in this section",
    "we consider where the major emitting region of soft x - ray photons is .",
    "several mechanisms may be responsible for the excess production of soft x - ray emission .",
    "it has been often considered that the soft x - ray emission arises from the accretion disk ( madau 1988 ; ross , fabian , & mineshige 1992 ; ross & fabian 1993 ) .",
    "for example , in an optically - thick , geometrically - thin accretion disk , madau ( 1988 ) take the occultation of the innermost disk region due to self - shadowing and the reflection effect of photons off the funnel wall into account and then find that uv and soft x - ray emission is enhanced if we observe this accretion disk from a nearly pole - on view . however , walter & fink ( 1993 ) suggested that spectral energy distributions between uv and soft x ray predicted by such accretion disk models appear inconsistent with the observations .",
    "one of very important observational properties of nls1s related to the soft x - ray emitting region is the discovery of evidence for the relativistic outflow in three nls1s ; 1h 0707@xmath109495 , iras 13224@xmath1093809 , and pg 1404 + 226 ( leighly et al .",
    "these outflows are probed by the broad absorption features around 1 kev ; the inferred blueshifts lie in a range between 0.2@xmath110 and 0.57@xmath110 .",
    "in addition to these three , vaughan et al .",
    "( 1999 ) find other three nls1s ( ton s180 , pg 1244 + 026 , and ark 564 ) also have such unusual absorption features .",
    "moreover , there are three nls1s with usual warm absorber ( ngc 4051 , iras 17020 + 45 , and iras 20181@xmath10922 ) ; o vii and o viii edges at 0.74 and 0.87 kev . in summary , among the 22 nls1s analyzed by vaughan et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , the above nine nls1s show absorption features .",
    "see iwasawa , brandt , & fabian ( 1998 ) for the x - ray absorption in one of the strong - fe ii nls1s , mrk 507 .",
    "it is remarkable that the nls1s with the absorption have narrower h@xmath3 line widths ; an average fwhm @xmath21 800 @xmath111 180 km s@xmath20 .",
    "on the other hand , the remaining nls1s have an average fwhm @xmath21 1290 @xmath111 320 km s@xmath20 .",
    "we examine the difference of the frequency distribution of fwhms between the nls1s with absorption features and nls1s without them .",
    "we adopt the null hypothesis that the nls1s with and without absorption features come from the same underlying distribution . applying the kormogrov - smirnov ( ks ) statistical test",
    ", we obtain the probability of randomly selecting the fwhms from the same underlying population as @xmath112 .",
    "therefore , the difference in fwhm between the two samples appears statistically real .",
    "vaughan et al . ( 1999 ) suggested that this property can be understood in terms of the pole - on view model ; e.g. , if the absorbing material originates in an outflow from the disk , it would only be seen in low inclination systems .    since relativistic outflows of plasma",
    "are expected to produce synchrotron emission in the radio , they may be identical to relativistic radio jets .",
    "indeed , nuclear radio jets have been found in most seyfert galaxies ( e.g. , ulvestad & wilson 1989 ) .",
    "furthermore , recent detailed morphological studies of inner regions of the nlr in some nearby seyfert nuclei have shown that the optical nlrs are associated with the radio jet ( bower et al .",
    "1995 ; capetti et al . 1995 , 1996 ) .",
    "these observations have strongly suggested that the nlr associated with the radio jet may be formed by the ionizing fast shock driven by the radio jet rather than the photoionization ( dopita & sutherland 1995 , 1996 ; dopita et al .",
    "1997 ; bicknell et al . 1998 ; falcke , wilson , & simpson 1998 ; wilson & raymond 1999 ; see also daltabuit & cox 1972 ; wilson & ulvestad 1983 ; norman & miley 1984 ) .",
    "although it is still uncertain that the majority of the nlr of seyfert nuclei are formed by the ionizing shock ( laor 1998 ; evans et al . 1999 ) , the spatial coincidence between the radio jets and the optical emission - line gas means that the ionizing shock works in part .",
    "if the radio jet interacts with the dense ambient gas in very close to the central engine , this can be responsible for the formation of hot plasma , giving rise to the production of x - ray photons ; note that the energy of 0.1 kev corresponds to the kinetic temperature @xmath113 k.    here we consider what happens when a radio jet interacts with the dense ambient gas following norman & miley ( 1984 ) .",
    "the jet is characterized by the jet luminosity @xmath114 , the jet velocity @xmath115 , and the solid opening angle of the jet @xmath116 . the pressure exerted on the ambient gas by the radio jet",
    "is estimated as    @xmath117    where @xmath118 is the radial distance of the jet .",
    "if we assume that the ambient gas clouds can cool and reach pressure equilibrium in the cocoon of the jet , we obtain a kinetic temperature of the gas    @xmath119    where @xmath120 is the electron density . for typical seyfert nuclei ,",
    "@xmath114 is of the order of @xmath121 erg s@xmath20 at most ( e.g. , wilson , ward , & haniff 1988 ) .",
    "although large - scale radio jets ( i.e. , kpc jets ) have jet velocities of the order of 10@xmath122 km s@xmath20 ( e.g. , wilson & ulvestad 1983 ; gallimore , baum , & odea 1996 ) , the inner jet velocities inferred from the broad absorption features in soft x - ray spectra is of the order of 10@xmath123 km s@xmath20 ( leighly et al .",
    "an important question is where the soft x - ray emitting region is along the jet .",
    "the soft x - ray excess is generally observed in s1s ( e.g. , mushotzky , done , & pounds 1993 ) .",
    "the unified model suggests that the soft x - ray emitting region is hidden by a dusty torus in s2s .",
    "since the typical half height of dusty tori is of the order of 0.1 pc ( taniguchi & murayama 1998 and references therein ) , we estimate a typical radial distance of the soft x - ray emitting region is @xmath40 0.01 pc or less ; we thus adopt @xmath124 0.01 pc .",
    "this is almost comparable to that of the disk blr .",
    "however , it is noted that the jet develops toward a direction perpendicular to the accretion disk ( i.e. , to the blr disk ) .",
    "therefore , electron densities in such ambient matter may be lower than those in the disk blr and be similar to those in the warm absorber region ( war ) ; we thus adopt the typical electron density of the war , @xmath125 @xmath56 ( e.g. , nishiura & taniguchi 1998 and references therein ) .",
    "then we obtain a typical kinetic temperature of the jet - driven shocked region    @xmath126    this temperature is high enough to produce soft x - ray photons and appears consistent with the estimated black - body temperatures for the nls1s , @xmath40 0.1 kev ( pounds et al . 1995 ; puchnarewicz et al .",

    "we note that we can obtain @xmath4 k if we adopt @xmath127 0.001 pc and @xmath128 @xmath56 .",
    "we investigate whether or not this idea is responsible for the steep soft x - ray spectra observed in nls1s .",
    "our model assumes that the excess soft x - ray emission is attributed to the thermal emission made by jet - driven shocks .",
    "therefore , the soft x - ray spectrum is characterized by the black body radiation with @xmath4 k. since the soft x - ray spectra of nls1s are dominated by the so - called soft excess emission over the underlying power - law continuum ( e.g. , vaughan et al .",
    "1999 ) , it seems reasonable to assume that the specific flux in the soft x - ray is described by the planck function ;    @xmath129    where @xmath130 . the spectral index at a frequency @xmath131",
    "is given by    @xmath132    since @xmath133 , the photon index @xmath8 is related to the spectral index as    @xmath134    introducing the following parameter    @xmath135    we obtain a relation    @xmath136    in table 2 , we give values of @xmath8 as a function of @xmath137 at an energy of @xmath138 = 1 kev ; i.e. , @xmath139 .",

    "first , we consider why s1s with larger fwhm(h@xmath3 ) ( i.e. , bls1s ) have flatter spectra . since bls1s are viewed from intermediate orientations , the brightening due to the kinematic doppler effect is generally weak .",
    "therefore the soft x - ray excess emission is less dominant than that in nls1s .",
    "we also have to take account that bls1s with larger fwhm(h@xmath3 ) tend to be observed from more inclined viewing angles if the intrinsic fwhm(h@xmath3 ) is not so different from s1 to s1 .",
    "thus , the extinction of soft x - ray photons due to dust grain above the dusty tori are expected to more serious on average for the bls1s than for the nls1s .",
    "these two orientation effects can be responsible for the flatter soft x - ray spectra of the bls1s .",

    "if the jet velocity is not so highly relativistic although the jet can cause shocked regions with @xmath4 k , or if the volume of the shocked region is fairly small , the blackbody radiation to the power law continuum luminosity ratio is small .",
    "since the viewing angle dependence due to the kinetic doppler effect is also small , the soft x - ray spectrum is dominated by the power - law continuum and thus @xmath196 regardless of fwhm(h@xmath3 ) .",
    "thirdly , we consider why there is a large scatter in @xmath32 of the nls1s .",
    "this observed scatter can be attributed either to a variety in @xmath197 ( see table 3 ) or to the relative predominance of the black body radiation with respect to the power - law continuum or both . in order to investigate",

    "the black body temperatures estimated by them are shown by filled circles with different colors .",
    "note that a black body temperature of @xmath200 k is assumed in the fitting for both i zw 1 and mrk 507 because of relatively poor s / n of the spectra ( vaughan et al .",
    "we construct two - component models in which the black body radiation and the power - law continuum are taken into account . here",
    "we adopt the canonical hard x - ray photon index for nls1s @xmath201 ( vaughan et al .",
    "1999 ) for the power - law continuum .",
    "our model results are also shown in figure 2 by thick curves as a function of @xmath197 .",
    "although the spectral fitting by vaughan et al . ( 1999 ) leads to a variety of @xmath197 by a factor of three [ i.e. , @xmath202 ( 1  3 ) @xmath6 k ] , our model results suggest that the majority of the nls1s have @xmath202 ( 0.7  1 ) @xmath6 k. although these values are slightly lower than our previous estimates based on table 3 [ i.e. , @xmath202 ( 1  2 ) @xmath6 k ] , this slight difference is due to that our previous estimates do not include the contribution of the power - law continuum .",
    "it is likely that @xmath203 seems to be evaluated more accurately than @xmath197 in the spectral fitting by vaughan et al .",
    "( 1999 ) because @xmath204 is estimated by integrating the soft excess emission while the estimate of @xmath197 is sensitive to the peak in the soft x - ray part of the spectra which has often poorer s / n .",
    "therefore , the observed scatter in @xmath32 of the nls1s is attributed mainly to the relative predominance of the black body radiation .",
    "here a question arises as what determines the black body temperature .",
    "since the origin of the black body radiation is attributed to the jet - driven shocks in our model , the temperature is determined by the ratio between the mechanical luminosity of the jet and the gas mass of the shocked region if we neglect the relativistic effect of the jet velocity . in figure 3",
    ", we show a diagram between @xmath32 and the soft x - ray luminosity to the radio jet power at @xmath9 = 6 cm for the vaughan et al.s ( 1999 ) nls1 sample .",
    "the radio continuum data are taken from ulvestad et al .",
    "the data set is too small to obtain any statistically significant results .",
    "however , it is interesting to see a trend that nls1 with steeper @xmath32 have higher @xmath205 ratios [ see also figure 9 in walter & fink ( 1993 ) ] .",
    "this tendency may be interpreted by that nls1s with a lot of dense ambient gas have higher soft x - ray luminosities because of relatively larger volume of the shocked region but the temperature of the shocked region does not increase significantly , giving rise to steeper @xmath32 . unfortunately , the black body temperature is available only for three nls1s . in order to verify this possibility , more sensitive , soft and hard x - ray spectroscopy as well as deep radio - continuum mapping for a larger sample of s1s will be recommended . in figure 4 , we also show a diagram between @xmath32 and @xmath206 for the nls1s studied by bbf96 ( upper panel ) and the s1s ( nls1s + bls1s ) studied by walter & fink ( 1993 ) ( lower panel ) .",
    "it is shown that there is a clear , positive correlation only for the nls1s ; its correlation coefficient is 0.66 .",
    "this implies that nls1s with higher @xmath206 have a larger volume of the shocked region but have a lower black body temperature ; note that the soft x - ray luminosity due to the black body radiation is estimated to be @xmath207 where @xmath208 is the stephan - boltzmann constant if the shocked region has a spherical form with a radius of @xmath209 .",
    "finally we mention about a typical size of the soft x - ray emitting regions .",
    "the variability timescale observed in the soft x ray is of the order of one day or less ( bbf96 ) , corresponding to a linear size of @xmath210 cm @xmath40 0.001 pc .",
    "the soft x - ray emitting region is located at a distance of @xmath40 0.01 pc from the central engine in our model .",
    "however , the above timescale suggests that a typical size of the soft x - ray emitting region is as small as @xmath40 0.001 pc .",
    "as mentioned before , we have an alternative option ; the soft x - ray emitting region is located at a distance of @xmath40 0.001 pc from the central engine and a typical size of the soft x - ray emitting region is also as small as @xmath40 0.001 pc .",
    "we have described the pole - on view model is responsible for the two important correlations , [ o7 ] ( section 7.2 ) and [ x2 ] ( section 7.3 ) . in this section ,",
    "we investigate how these two correlations are linked physically .",
    "it is widely accepted that the blr is photoionized by the nonthermal continuum from the central engine although shock heating models are also sometimes discussed ( e.g. , rees 1984 ; blandford 1990 ) . as discussed in section 7.2 , optically - thick , partly ionized regions from which the fe ii emission arises are mainly heated by x - ray photons ( ferland & netzer 1979 ; kwan & krolik 1981 ) .",
    "high energy photons formed by the synchrotron self compton effect are associated with relativistic outflows and thus are thought to be highly beamed .",
    "the direction of the beaming is believed to be perpendicular to the accretion disk .",
    "therefore , it is unlikely that these high energy photons are responsible for the ionization of the disk - like blr .",
    "indeed wang et al . ( 1996 ) showed that nls1s with strong fe ii emission have lower x - ray luminosities at 2 kev and thus suggested that the fe ii emitting region can not be heated by x rays with energies of @xmath40 2 kev .",
    "instead , the optically - thick accretion disk around a supermassive compact object is also thought to play an important role in the ionization of the disk - like blr .",
    "the optically - thick condition leads to that gas particles dissipate their energy locally because of the viscosity . in this case",
    ", we can approximate the local emission as blackbody .",
    "since the accretion disk has a temperature gradient , superposition of such blackbody emission with various temperatures can mimic to the power - law like continuum emission .",
    "the temperature of such an accretion disk around a schwarzschild supermassive black hole can be written as    @xmath211^{-3/4 } ~~ { \\rm k } ~~ \\nonumber \\\\   & & \\makebox[11em ] { } ( { \\rm for } ~~ r \\geq 3 r_{\\rm s}),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath212 is the accretion rate , @xmath213 is the eddington accretion rate , @xmath51 is the black hole mass in units of @xmath52 , and @xmath214 is the schwarzschild radius ( e.g. , peterson 1997 ) .",
    "therefore , this radiation is mainly emitted in the uv region , responsible for the photoionization of the disk - like blr . however , since this continuum emission does not contain a lot of higher energy photons , it is unlikely that this continuum creates a huge volume of partly ionized regions in the disk - like blr ( see upper panel of figure 6 ) .",
    "therefore , it is expected that a dense gas cloudlet immersed in the disk - like blr consists of both a fully - ionized zone facing to the continuum and a neutral zone .",
    "this means that fe ii emission can not arise from this cloudlet efficiently .",
    "as shown in figure 4 , there is the clear correlation between @xmath32 and the soft x - ray luminosity .",
    "in addition , wang et al .",
    "( 1996 ) showed that there is a positive correlation between @xmath32 and the fe ii @xmath94570/h@xmath3 ratio .",
    "the simplest interpretation for these correlations is that the stronger fe ii emission is attributed to the soft x - ray excess emission ; i.e. , fe ii emitting regions in the disk - like blr are photoionized by the soft x - ray excess emission .",
    "we have shown that jet - driven shocks lead to the formation of hot regions with @xmath215 k. since this emission is approximated by the blackbody radiation , soft x - ray photons are emitted isotropically ; note , however , that the shocked region are thought to be moving a relativistic velocity and thus the radiation field is modulated by this effect .",
    "these soft x - ray photons irradiate the disk - like blr .",
    "the outer surfaces of cloudlets in the disk - like blr are photoionized by these photons .",
    "if these cloudlets are ionization - bounded , there are neutral regions inside the cloudlets .",
    "since some high energy photons can penetrate into the inner regions , it is expected that partly ionized regions are made there . in figure 5",
    ", we show a diagram between the fe ii / h@xmath3 ratio and the black - body radiation to power - law continuum luminosity ratio in the hard x ray which is estimated by vaughan et al .",
    "although the data points show a large scatter , there is a marginal tendency that nls1s with larger fe ii / h@xmath3 ratios tend to have higher @xmath216 ratios .",
    "we thus propose that this is the formation mechanism of the fe ii emitting region in the disk - like blr ( see lower panel of figure 6 ) .",
    "although we are not going to give more detailed photoionization modeling , the new idea presented here appears to explain the origin of the fe ii emitting region qualitatively .",
    "our new model was constructed to explain the two most important correlations ; between the fe ii / h@xmath3 intensity ratio and the fwhm(h@xmath3 ) [ o7 ] and between the soft x - ray photon index @xmath8 and the fwhm(h@xmath3 ) [ x2 ] .",
    "although these two correlations are explained by the viewing angle dependence without invoking other mechanisms , there are a number of other important observational properties of nls1s summarized in section 2 .",
    "therefore , in this section , we investigate whether or not our new model is also consistent with them .",
    "the equivalent widths of blamer lines of nls1s are on average lower by a factor of @xmath21 2 than those of bls1s [ o3 ] .",
    "this is consistently explained by the difference of the average viewing angle between the nls1s and the bls1s if the optical continuum emission arises mainly from the optically - thick accretion disk .",
    "the optical polarization of nls1s is interpreted by the dust scattering [ o9 ] .",
    "this may be caused either at the inner wall of dusty tori or the dusty nlr clouds ( netzer & laor 1993 ; wolf & henning 1999 ) .",
    "robinson ( 1995 ) suggested that the profiles of blr emission of nls1s are generally different from those of bls1 ; i.e. , a normal broad - line profile has a more dominant core than a nls1 profile [ o2 ] .",
    "since there are two kinds of blr ( i.e. , a disk - like and a jet - like blr in a seyfert galaxy ) , it is expected that the relative contribution of these two components to the total flux may be different from seyfert to seyfert .",
    "therefore , it may not be surprising to observe various kinds of balmer emission - line profiles .",
    "the anti - correlation between fe ii @xmath94570/h@xmath3 and [ o iii]@xmath95007/h@xmath3 [ o8 ] can be understood if the nlr has a significant amount of dust grains ( netzer & laor 1993 ) because the nls1s are viewed from lower viewing angles and thus the effect of extinction on the [ o iii ] emission could be more serious than that for the bls1s .",
    "since the hi - blr emission lines are thought to arise from the jet - like blr , there can be little difference in the uv emission line properties ( [ u1 ] and [ u2 ] ) between the nls1s and the bls1s .",
    "since the uv  soft x - ray emitting regions in nls1s are moving toward us at relativistic velocities , the uv part of the continuum emission is blueshifted to the soft x - ray regime and thus the uv luminosities of nls1s are expected to be less luminous than those of bls1s systematically [ u3 ] .",
    "this effect may also contribute to the softer hard x - ray spectra observed in nls1s [ x3 ] .",
    "walter & fink ( 1993 ) found the positive correlation between @xmath32 and the uv ( 1375 )-to - x ray ( 2 kev ) flux ratio for s1s and nls1s follow this correlation [ x8 ] . in our model",
    "the uv continuum is mainly supplied by the optically - thick accretion disk . in order to explain this correlation",
    ", it will be necessary to construct a more general model including the accretion disk emission .",
    "it is worth noting the radio continuum image of one of nls1s , mrk 766 ( ulvestad et al . 1995 ) .",
    "since this nls1 is a very nearby object , this is fortunately resolved spatially in the 3.6 cm and 6 cm radio continuum maps .",
    "the linear size is 60 pc although the shape is slightly elongated in position angle of @xmath217 .",
    "a typical linear size of the radio jets in bls1s is 350 pc ( ulvestad & wilson 1989 ) .",
    "if the small radio size of mrk 766 is attributed to the inclination effect , we obtain a viewing angle toward the jet is @xmath18 = sin@xmath20 ( @xmath218 ) @xmath219 , being consistent with those derived from the kinematical and statistical considerations . since most nls1s are not resolved in the observations of ulvestad et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , the pole - on view model appears consistent with the radio observations in this respect [ r2 ] .",
    "however , the following observations are not interpreted easily ; two nls1s ( mrk 766 and mrk 1126 ) have radio major axes perpendicular to the optical polarization while the remaining one ( mrk 957 ) has a radio major axis parallel to the optical polarization [ r3 ] .",
    "it has been shown that the optical polarization position angles tend to align with the radio - jet structure in type 1 agn while be perpendicular to the radio - jet structure in type 2 agn ( antonucci 1983 , 1984 , 1992 ) . if nls1s belong to a subclass of s1s , we would obtain that all the above three nls1s have radio major axes parallel to the optical polarization .    as mentioned in section 5.2 briefly , accretion disks in agns",
    "have been probed by the very broad fe k@xmath24 emission ( tanaka et al .",
    "1995 ; fabian et al . 1995 ; mushotzky et al . 1995 ; iwasawa et al . 1996 ; nandra et al . 1997 ; reynolds 1997 ) .",
    "nandra et al .",
    "( 1997 ) presented a systematic analysis of the hard x - ray spectra of 18 bls1s .",
    "they fitted the fe k@xmath24 emission profiles and derived the most probable inclination angles ; @xmath220 .",
    "although these estimates are subject to a number of fitting parameters , it is interesting to note that most of the bls1s are viewed from such intermediate viewing angles .",
    "it has been often claimed that the soft excess emission in nls1s is similar to the observational property of the high state of galactic black hole candidates ( gbhcs ) like cyg x-1 ( tanaka 1990 ; pounds et al .",
    "1995 ; hayashida 1997 ) .",
    "these gbhcs are known to show a dramatic change in spectral shape from a normal agn - like power law to a state where the soft x - ray emission dominates , perhaps being attributed to the thermal emission from the accretion disk .",
    "although the power - law spectrum can still be seen in this high state , it is often observed to be steeper than before as a result of the increased electron cooling from the enhanced soft x - ray photons .",
    "this spectral change may be caused by an increase in the accretion rate ; the accretion rates in the gbhcs are thought to be close to the eddington limit .",
    "however , as discussed in section 7.3 , the soft x - ray luminosities of nls1s are extrinsically more enhanced by the kinematical doppler factor than those of bls1s .",
    "therefore , it is not necessary to interpret that nls1s have higher gas accretion rates than bls1s .",
    "bbf96 also noted the following difficulty for the gbhc model ; gbhcs tend to be less variable while in their ultra soft states , while nls1s do not show reduced variability .",
    "as discussed in section 5.3 , the pole - on view model implies that the observed narrow fwhms of nls1s are attributed to smaller viewing angles toward the blr .",
    "a critical viewing angle toward nls1s is @xmath73 sin@xmath20 ( 1000 km s@xmath20/12000 km s@xmath20 ) @xmath74 or @xmath76 if we adopt the maximum value of fwhm(blr ) = 2000 km s@xmath20 for nls1s ( vaughan et al .",
    "1999 ) . since s1s with fwhm(blr ) @xmath19 2000 km s@xmath20 are often classified as nls1s , the latter viewing angle seems a more appropriate estimate .",
    "therefore , we adopt @xmath221 .      after introducing the dusty torus model for seyfert nuclei ( antonucci & miller 1985 ) , many arguments have been made to estimate the critical viewing angle between s1s and s2s ( osterbrock & shaw 1988 ; salzer 1989 ; miller & goodrich 1990 ; huchra & burg 1992 ; pogge 1989 ; wilson & tsvetanov 1994 ; schmitt & kinney 1996 ; murayama et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "\\a ) the statistical method : the critical viewing angle @xmath222 can be estimated from the number statistics of s1s and s2s if we observe seyfert nuclei from random orientations on the statistical ground ,      where @xmath224 and @xmath91 are the observed numbers of s1s and s2s , respectively ( miller & goodrich 1990 ) .",
    "the three different optical surveys of seyfert galaxies give the following critical angles ; @xmath225 ( osterbrock & shaw 1988 ) , 34@xmath226 ( salzer 1989 ) , and 46@xmath226 ( huchra & burg 1992 ) .",
    "\\b ) the opening angle of nlr : the nlr of s2s often exhibits conical morphologies , which are due to shadowing of the nuclear ionizing continuum by the torus . the observed semi - opening angle of the cone @xmath227 is thereby equal to the semi - opening angle of the torus @xmath228 as noted in section 6.2 briefly .",
    "this angle can be close to the critical viewing angle to bls1s .",
    "the statistical results from observations of conical nlrs give the following opening angle ; @xmath229 ( pogge 1989 ) , @xmath96 ( wilson & tsvetanov 1994 ) , and @xmath97 ( schmitt & kinney 1996 ) .",
    "\\c ) the mid - infrared diagnostic : since the @xmath35-band ( 3.5 @xmath34m)-to - iras 25 @xmath34 m flux ratio is sensitive to the orientation of dusty tori , this ratio can be used to estimate the viewing angle to the dusty tori although dusty torus models are necessary to perform this analysis ( taniguchi et al .",
    "1997 ; murayama et al .",
    "murayama et al .",
    "( 2000 ) found that the critical viewing angle toward bls1s is about @xmath61 .",
    "s2s are also classified into the following two classes ; 1 ) s2s with the hidden blr ( hereafter s2@xmath15 ) , and 2 ) s2s without the hidden blr ( hereafter s2@xmath15 ) ( e.g. , miller & goodrich 1990 ; tran 1995 ) .",
    "now let us assume that the s2@xmath15s are viewed at an angle intermediate between s1s and s2@xmath17s ( heisler , lumsden , & bailey 1997 ) .",
    "we can estimate a critical viewing angle which distinguishes s2@xmath15 from s2@xmath17 ( @xmath231 ) ,      using this relation together with the observed number ratio between s2@xmath15 and s2@xmath17 , @xmath233 = 10/40 = 0.25 , taniguchi & anabuki ( 1999 ) obtained @xmath234 .",
    "this means that seyfert galaxies viewed from @xmath235 are identified as s2@xmath17s .",
    "the above arguments lead us to propose a viewing - angle - dependent unified model for seyfert nuclei ; 1 ) @xmath12 for nls1s , 2 ) @xmath13 for bls1s , 3 ) @xmath14 for s2@xmath15s , and 4 ) @xmath16 for s2@xmath17s .",
    "this is schematically illustrated in figure 7 .",
    "finally , it seems important to note that the nls1 phenomenon is also observed in some radio - quiet quasars ( laor et al .",
    "1994 , 1997 ; fiore et al . 1998 ; xu et al .",
    "therefore , it is strongly suggested that the class of nls1s is the radio - quiet equivalent of the class of blazers in radio - loud agn ( see for unified models for radio - loud agn , urry & padovani 1995 ) .",

    "<S> narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxies ( nls1s ) have been recognized to comprise a distinct class of the seyfert activity in addition to type 1 and type 2 seyfert galaxies ( s1s and s2s , respectively ) ; the nls1s show strong optical fe ii emission lines as well as high - ionization lines without optical broad emission lines . </S>",
    "<S> recently growing evidence has been accumulated that the nls1s are viewed from nearly pole - on viewing angles . </S>",
    "<S> however , there has been no theoretical model which explains the following important correlations ; 1 ) weaker optical fe ii emitters always have wider emission - line widths but stronger optical fe ii emitters have either wider or narrower line widths , and 2 ) s1s with wider line widths always have flatter soft x - ray spectra but s1s with narrower line widths have either steeper or flatter soft x - ray spectra .    </S>",
    "<S> photoionization models predict that the partly - ionized zone in the broad line region ( blr ) with a disk - like configuration , in which the optical fe ii emission is thought to arise , is very optically thick ; e.g. , the hydrogen column density is required to be as high as @xmath0 @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the visibility of the partly - ionized regions is expected to be strongly viewing - angle dependent . if we observe this disk - like blr from an inclined viewing angle </S>",
    "<S> ; e.g. , @xmath2 [ a typical viewing angle for broad - line s1s ( hereafter bls1s ) ] , the fe ii emitting region located in the far - side half disk can not be seen entirely because of the large optical depth while almost all the h@xmath3 emission can be seen because the ionized hydrogen is located in the outer surfaces of blr clouds . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> if we observe the disk - like blr from a nearly pole - on view , we can see both fe ii and h@xmath3 , resulting in a higher fe ii / h@xmath3 ratio together with a narrower line width with respect to those observed from an inclined viewing angle . </S>",
    "<S> this explains the first important correlation .    </S>",
    "<S> recent discovery of relativistic outflows in some nls1s suggests that the nuclear radio jet interacts with the dense ambient gas very close to the central engine . </S>",
    "<S> we show that this can be responsible for the formation of hot plasma with kinetic temperatures of @xmath4 k , giving rise to the production of soft x - ray photons . </S>",
    "<S> the black - body radiation from the hot plasma explains the observed steeper photon indices in the soft x ray if @xmath5 ( 1  2 ) @xmath6 k and @xmath7 0.2  0.7 . </S>",
    "<S> the kinetic doppler effect increases the soft x - ray luminosities if we observe s1s from a nearly pole - on view given the above range of @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> these explain why nls1s tend to have steeper soft x - ray spectra together with higher soft x - ray luminosities . </S>",
    "<S> since the pole - on view model for nls1s implies that bls1s are viewed from intermediate orientations , the brightening due to the kinematic doppler effect is generally weak for the bls1s and thus the soft x - ray excess emission in the bls1s is less dominant than that in the nls1s . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the extinction of soft x - ray photons due to dust grain above the dusty tori are expected to more serious for the bls1s than for the nls1s . </S>",
    "<S> we thus suggest that these orientation effects are responsible for the second important correlation . </S>",
    "<S> it is also understood why soft x - ray surveys tend to pick up nls1s preferentially .    </S>",
    "<S> it is known that there is a correlation between the soft x - ray photon index ( @xmath8 ) and the fe ii @xmath94570/h@xmath3 ratio for both nls1 and bls1s . </S>",
    "<S> we also newly find another correlation between @xmath8 and the soft x - ray luminosity for the nls1s studied by boller , brandt , & fink . </S>",
    "<S> these correlations suggest that the strength of fe ii emission is intimately related to the soft x - ray emission . since the ultraviolet continuum emission from the optically - thick accretion disk with @xmath10 k can not create partly - ionized regions in the disk - like blr efficiently , we suggest that soft x - ray photons from the jet - driven shocked regions with @xmath11 k are responsible for the formation of the fe ii emitting regions . </S>",
    "<S> this provides a causal relationship between the strong fe ii emission and the excess soft x - ray emission .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we propose a viewing - angle - dependent unified model for seyfert nuclei ; 1 ) @xmath12 for nls1s , 2 ) @xmath13 for bls1s , 3 ) @xmath14 for type 2 seyferts with the hidden blr ( s2@xmath15s ) , and 4 ) @xmath16 for type 2 seyferts without the hidden blr ( s2@xmath17s ) where @xmath18 is the viewing angle toward the blr disk around the central engine . since the nls1 phenomenon </S>",
    "<S> is also observed in radio - quiet quasars , it is strongly suggested that the class of nls1s is the radio - quiet equivalent of the class of blazers in radio - loud active galactic nuclei . </S>"
