    "[ fig : epsilon1sigma1](b ) ] . a smaller gap of @xmath47  mev at 8  k can be revealed from the observed suppression of optical conductivity,@xcite in addition to a larger superconducting gap at @xmath4820  mev that was resolved by arpes.@xcite the preformed gap associated with the quasiparticles in the @xmath9 band",

    "hence in the @xmath50 and @xmath28 samples the smaller gap is already suppressed .",
    "the constant suppression of the optical conductivity below @xmath10 is a result of the opening of a superconducting gap whose energy is out of the investigated frequency range .",
    "the observation of the metal - to - insulator , gap formation , and superconducting transition temperatures as a function of sulfur content enables us to establish a phase diagram with orbital - selective mott , metallic , preformed - gap , and superconducting phases , as displayed in fig .",
