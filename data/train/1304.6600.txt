    "the spin dynamics of free electrons in zinc - blende - type quantum wells ( qws ) is largely determined by the electron subband spin - orbit splitting which can be fruitfully treated as a wavevector - dependent effective magnetic field acting upon the spins of individual electrons  @xcite .",
    "the field occurs due to the lack of space inversion symmetry in a particular qw and can originate from bulk , structure , or interface inversion asymmetry , or their joint action .",
    "the field direction and magnitude depend on the qw crystallographic orientation and design as well as external gate voltage  @xcite , which opens a way towards the spin manipulation and spin - based semiconductor devices . of special interest",
    "are qws grown on the ( 110 ) substrate .",
    "the effective magnetic field caused by bulk inversion asymmetry ( dresselhaus field ) in such structures points along the growth direction and , therefore , does not cause the precession of electron spins oriented along the qw normal  @xcite .",
    "this enables the observation of very long electron spin lifetimes up to hundreds of nanoseconds at low temperatures which are unfeasible for two - dimensional structures of other crystallographic orientations  @xcite .",
    "the electron spin lifetime in ( 110)-grown qws at low temperature is likely to be limited by the spin precession in the homogeneous rashba field present in asymmetric qws or unavoidable fluctuating rashba field that emerges due to domain structure formation or inhomogeneous distribution of charged impurities in doped structures  @xcite .",
    "the rashba field lies in the qw plane and starts up the spin dephasing .",
    "the previous theoretical studies of electron spin dephasing in ( 110)-grown qws with the homogeneous  @xcite or fluctuating  @xcite rashba field were limited to the collision - dominated regime of spin dynamics , where the scattering time is much smaller than the spin precession period in the effective magnetic field .",
    "such a consideration is inapplicable for qws with high electron mobility and/or strong spin - orbit coupling , which are now technological available . in this paper",
    ", we develop the microscopic theory of electron spin dephasing for arbitrary ratio between the scattering time and the spin precession period .",
    "we show that the interplay of rashba and dresselhaus fields leads to dynamic coupling of the in - plane and out - of - plane spin components .",
    "the dependence of the spin lifetime on the electron mobility is nonmonotonic and reaches the minimum in qw structures where the scattering time is comparable to the period of spin precession in the effective magnetic field . in high - mobility qws",
    ", the dresselhaus field efficiently suppresses the spin dephasing allowing one to reach very long spin lifetimes .",
    "first , we consider asymmetric ( 110)-grown qws with a spatially homogeneous rashba field . the linear in the wavevector spin - orbit splitting of the electron subband in such qws ( @xmath0 point group ) is generally described by three linearly independent parameters @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3  @xcite ( see also refs .",
    "the corresponding hamiltonian has the form @xmath4 where @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) are the pauli matrices , @xmath7 are the components of the electron wavevector , @xmath8 $ ] and @xmath9 $ ] are the in - plane axes , and @xmath10 $ ] is the qw normal . the parameters @xmath1 and @xmath2 are nonzero in qws with structure inversion asymmetry only , while @xmath3 requires bulk inversion asymmetry and describes the dresselhaus splitting in ( 110)-oriented qws .",
    "the difference between @xmath1 and @xmath2 is usually small because it is caused by an interference effect between cubic structure of the crystall lattice and qw structure inversion asymmetry  @xcite .",

    "the fact that the plane of the @xmath18 vectors does not contain the growth direction @xmath20 nor is perpendicular to @xmath20 is a feature of low - symmetry qws and leads to the coupling of the in - plane and out - of - plane spin components .",
