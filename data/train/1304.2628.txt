    "these high - frequency components that enter due to collective effects instead lead to dephasing of the oscillations , as can be seen in the curves for systems larger than three sites . for large chain lengths",
    "@xmath131 , this dephasing , combined with some averaging over chains of different length , is sufficient to account for the rate of damping seen in the experiment . in practice , other sources of dephasing , e.g. , due to the harmonic confinement or noise , will also contribute to damping in the experiment .",

    "<S> we observe significant shifts of the tunneling parameter arising from interactions , and collective effects in the oscillations arising from the effective constraint in the model . </S>",
