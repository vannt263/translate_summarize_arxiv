    "the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon @xmath3 is among the most precisely known quantities in the standard model ( sm ) , and therefore , provides us with a sensitive probe of new physics beyond the sm ( bsm )  @xcite .",
    "there is a long - standing @xmath4 discrepancy between the sm prediction  @xcite and the measured value of @xmath5  @xcite : @xmath6 the uncertainties in the experimental measurement , which come from the e821 experiment at bnl  @xcite , can be reduced by about a factor of four in the upcoming muon @xmath7 experiment at fermilab  @xcite . if comparable progress can be made in reducing the uncertainties of the sm prediction  @xcite , we will have a definite answer to the question whether or not @xmath8 is evidence for bsm physics .",
    "thus from a theoretical point of view , it is worthwhile investigating simple bsm scenarios which can account for the @xmath0 anomaly , should this endure , and at the same time , have complementary tests in other ongoing and near future experiments . with this motivation , we discuss here a simple @xmath9 interpretation of the @xmath0 anomaly .",
    "a sufficiently muonphilic @xmath9 can address the @xmath0 discrepancy  @xcite ; however , in order to avoid stringent bounds from the charged lepton sector , while being consistent with a sizable contribution to @xmath0 , the @xmath9 coupling must violate lepton universality .",

    "@xcite for the most recent attempts to explain some of these anomalies . in this work",
    "we concentrate on @xmath0 and only comment on @xmath11 . ] for instance , a sizable @xmath9 coupling to electrons is strongly constrained over a large range of @xmath9 masses from @xmath12 measurements at lep  @xcite , electroweak precision tests  @xcite , @xmath13 ( with @xmath14 ) at babar  @xcite , @xmath15 at na48/2  @xcite , the @xmath7 of the electron  @xcite , and neutrino - neutrino scattering in supernova cores  @xcite .",
    "similarly , a sizable flavor - diagonal @xmath1 coupling to muons is strongly constrained from neutrino trident production @xmath16  @xcite using the ccfr data  @xcite .",
    "in addition , charged lepton flavor - violating ( lfv ) processes , such as @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , constrain all the lepton - flavor - diagonal couplings of the @xmath9 , as well as the flavor off - diagonal couplings to electrons and muons  @xcite .",
    "there also exist stringent lhc constraints from di - lepton resonance searches : @xmath23  @xcite , @xmath24  @xcite and @xmath25  @xcite .",
    "all these constraints require the flavor - diagonal @xmath1 couplings , as well as the flavor off - diagonal couplings involving electrons to be very small , or equivalently , push the @xmath9 mass scale to above multi - tev range  @xcite .",
    "we propose a simplified leptophilic @xmath9 scenario with _ only _ a flavor off - diagonal coupling to the muon and tau sector [ see eq .",
    "below ] , which trivially satisfies all the above - mentioned constraints , and moreover , can be justified from symmetry arguments , as discussed below .",
    "in such a scenario , we find that the most relevant constraints come from leptonic @xmath26 decays in low - energy precision experiments , and to some extent , from the leptonic decays of the sm @xmath27 boson at the lhc .",
    "in particular , we show that the @xmath0 anomaly can be accounted for only with @xmath28 and by allowing a larger @xmath9 coupling to the right - handed charged - leptons than to the left - handed ones , whereas the lighter @xmath1 scenario ( with @xmath29 ) is ruled out completely from searches for @xmath30+invisible decays .",
    "we emphasize that the entire allowed range can likely be tested in future low - energy precision measurements of lepton flavor universality in @xmath26 decays at belle 2 , as well as in the leptonic decay of the @xmath27 boson at the lhc . a striking four - lepton collider signature consisting of like - sign di - muons and like - sign di - taus",
    "can be probed at the high luminosity phase of the lhc ( hl - lhc ) as well as at a future electron - positron collider running at the @xmath31 pole .",
    "we also point out an interesting possibility for the detection of our flavor - violating @xmath9 scenario by the scattering of ultra - high energy neutrinos off lower - energy neutrinos , which leads to characteristic spectral absorption features that might be observable in large volume neutrino telescopes like icecube and km3net .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : model ] , we present our phenomenological model lagrangian , which can be justified in a concrete bsm scenario . in section  [ sec : gm2 ] , we show how the @xmath0 anomaly can be resolved in our lfv @xmath1 scenario .",

    "our simplified model lagrangian for the @xmath1 coupling exclusively to the muon and tau sector of the sm is given by @xmath32 where @xmath33 are the chirality projection operators .",
    "due to @xmath34 invariance , the couplings of the left - handed neutrinos and charged leptons are identical , whereas we do not introduce right - handed neutrinos in order to keep the model minimal . the left - handed and right - handed couplings @xmath35 and @xmath36 could in principle contain @xmath37 violating phases .",
    "we will take into account the complex nature of these couplings in all the equations below ; in our numerical analysis however , we will take them to be real for simplicity .",
    "we allow different lfv couplings of the @xmath1 to left- and right - handed charged leptons , which will be crucial for the @xmath0 explanation .",
    "we assume the @xmath1 can acquire mass from the spontaneous breaking of some extra @xmath38 symmetry , under which it is charged .",
    "the details of the mechanism that generates the @xmath9 mass are irrelevant for our phenomenological purposes , and we treat @xmath39 as a free parameter in the following . since @xmath40 is the only flavor - blind @xmath41 symmetry that is anomaly - free with the sm field content , the advantage of the extra @xmath38 is that the associated @xmath1 can couple differently to different sm fermion families .    as mentioned above ,",
    "most of the existing experimental constraints involve first generation fermions , which may be regarded as more ` fundamental ' in the sense that these comprise ordinary matter around us .",
    "thus , we assume that the couplings of the @xmath9 to the first generation fermions are vanishingly small or non - existent  @xcite , so that all these stringent experimental constraints are readily avoided .",
    "symmetry  @xcite , which is in fact the only anomaly - free @xmath41 group with nonzero charge assignments to sm neutrinos that can lead to an experimentally viable light @xmath1 without requiring the addition of any exotic fermions .",
    "another possibility is a @xmath41 group charged under only muon or tau number , but this requires new chiral fermions charged under both @xmath34 and @xmath40 , as well as under the new @xmath42 or @xmath43 group . ]",
    "if the @xmath1 does not couple universally to quarks , there will be no glashow - iliopoulos - maiani ( gim ) suppression of the flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) processes in the quark sector , and the current experimental bounds on neutral meson mixing , such as @xmath44  @xcite , as well as fcnc decays of the top , bottom and strange quarks  @xcite will force the @xmath1 couplings to be rather small .",
    "therefore , we will assume that the @xmath1 in our case is leptophilic , and more specifically , couples only to second and third generation leptons .",
    "the phenomenological lagrangian in eq .   can then be justified by imposing an exact discrete symmetry under which  @xcite @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are respectively the usual @xmath34 lepton doublets and singlets in the sm in the gauge eigenstate basis and @xmath48 is the @xmath40 gauge field .",

    "the resonance energy could be lowered significantly if we consider interactions of the high - energy neutrinos with other relativistic neutrinos naturally available , e.g. supernovae neutrinos ( after they have oscillated into muon and tau flavors ) which have a typical energy @xmath234 in the mev range  @xcite . in this case",
    ", the center - of - mass energy of the system is @xmath235 , and the resonance condition   gets modified to @xmath236 , independent of the light neutrino mass , thus lowering the resonance energy down to the tev scale .",

    "[ fig:7 ] for two choices of @xmath212 gev ( blue solid curve ) and 10 gev ( blue dashed curve ) . below the tev scale",
    ", it will be difficult to observe the resonance feature , since it will be swamped by the atmospheric neutrino background .",
    "the neutrino number density at the supernova core surface is much larger , e.g. @xmath237 for sn1987a  @xcite .",
    "hence , the mfp can be much smaller , thus allowing for the possibility of observing the absorption feature from both galactic and extragalactic sources , provided the incoming high - energy neutrinos encounter a supernova core collapse en route to earth .",
    "the likelihood of such an arrangement somewhat depends on the origin of the high - energy neutrino source , and can not be excluded at the moment .",
    "the lfv interactions could also alter the ratio of astrophysical neutrino flavors at detection on earth from the standard expectation of @xmath238 .",
    "the detailed predictions for the event rate and the track - to - shower ratio will depend on many parameters , including the source neutrino flux normalization and spectral index , redshift , as well as the pdf uncertainties , but in spite of all these uncertainties , the anomalous features could plausibly be measured  @xcite by icecube or next generation neutrino telescopes like icecube - gen2 , thereby opening a new era of ` cosmic neutrino spectroscopy ' .",
    "we have discussed a simple new physics interpretation of the long - standing anomaly in the muon anomalous magnetic moment in terms of a purely flavor off - diagonal @xmath1 coupling only to the muon and tau sector of the sm .",
    "we have discussed the relevant constraints from lepton flavor universality violating tau decays for @xmath239 and from @xmath240 invisibles decay for @xmath241 , as well as the latest lhc constraints from @xmath242 searches .",
    "we find that for a @xmath1 lighter than the tau , the low - energy tau decay constraints rule out the entire @xmath0 allowed region by many orders of magnitude .",
    "however , a heavier @xmath1 solution to the @xmath0 puzzle is still allowed , provided the @xmath1 coupling to the charged leptons has both left- and right - handed components , and the right - handed component is larger than the left - handed one .",

    "<S> we find that the @xmath0-favored region for a @xmath1 lighter than the tau lepton is totally excluded , while a heavier @xmath1 solution is still allowed . </S>",
    "<S> some testable implications of this scenario in future experiments , such as lepton - flavor universality - violating tau decays at belle 2 , and a new four - lepton signature involving same - sign di - muons and di - taus at hl - lhc and fcc - ee , are pointed out . </S>",
