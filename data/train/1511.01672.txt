    "recently , quantum - transport calculations have become an important tool for investigating the physics and chemistry of nanoscale systems because they are expected to exhibit considerably different transport properties from those of classical conductors .",
    "owing to the complexity of the problem , such studies are strongly dependent on the existence of reliable numerical treatments based on first - principles approaches .",
    "a number of first - principles methods for calculating the electron - transport properties of nanoscale systems have been proposed so far .",
    "they are roughly categorized into two approaches .",
    "one approach uses the nonequilibrium green s function ( negf ) .",
    "the relation between the conductance and green s function has been derived within the nonequilibrium keldysh formalism.@xcite this approach has been used extensively in connection with tight - binding models and first - principles methods employing localized basis sets consisting of either atomic orbitals@xcite or gaussians.@xcite the other approach is to use a wave - function - matching method , in which the transmission and reflection coefficients of scattering wave functions are computed .",
    "this approach has been employed by combining it with techniques in which real - space grids and/or plane - wave basis sets are used to describe wave functions and potentials .",
    "when these two approaches are compared , it is advantageous to treat the charge density in the equilibrium regime of energy by the procedure of the green s function method with the energy of a nonreal number . on the other hand , the scattering wave functions computed in a wave - function - matching method",
    "provide a direct real - space picture of the scattering process .",
    "one of the present authors has demonstrated that the wave - function - matching methods are related to the green s function method in mathematically strict manner@xcite and can be combined straightforwardly in the real - space finite - difference ( rsfd ) approach,@xcite which is one of the methods using real - space grids .",
    "in addition , recent cutting - edge computers worldwide rely on massively parallel architectures , and the rsfd approach is one of the most promising methods of executing large - scale simulations on massively parallel computers .",
    "thus , it is important to develop rigorous and efficient numerical schemes combining the advantages of the green s function and wave - function - matching methods based on the rsfd approach to perform large - scale first - principles electron - transport calculations .    in the green s function formalism",
    ", the perturbed green s functions of the transition region sandwiched between electrodes are computed using self - energy terms of electrodes . in our previous study,@xcite",
    "we proposed a procedure to obtain the self - energy terms from the ratio matrices , which are constituted by the generalized bloch waves of electrodes and originally introduced in one of the wave - function - matching methods , the overbridging boundary - matching method,@xcite for the rsfd approach .",
    "although the computational cost for the self - energy terms is greatly reduced , this procedure requires all the generalized bloch waves of electrodes , and the calculation of rapidly varying evanescent waves is computationally demanding and numerically unstable.@xcite srensen _ et al._@xcite proposed a method in which rapidly varying evanescent waves are excluded by introducing a cutoff for evanescent waves @xmath1 in the construction of self - energy terms because rapidly varying evanescent waves included in the generalized bloch waves do not contribute to electron transport .",
    "they demonstrated the efficiency of their method by calculating the transport properties of small molecules .",
    "however , in the case of large systems , the convergence of conductance with respect to @xmath1 is slow . to perform large - scale calculations in the rsfd approach , we employ very large matrices for which self - energy terms are calculated .",
    "in addition , to avoid the problem of reduced accuracy arising from the incompleteness of the basis sets in the methods using localized basis sets , the size of the matrices is also increased .",
    "therefore , fast and accurate computation of the self - energy terms for large systems is indispensable to ensure the reliability of transport calculations .    in this paper",
    ", we propose an efficient numerical technique to calculate the self - energy terms of electrodes for first - principles transport calculations .",
    "using the orthogonal complement vectors of the space spanned by the bloch waves containing the propagating waves and moderately varying evanescent waves , we can overcome the numerical difficulty in treating rapidly varying evanescent waves and in constructing self - energy terms .",
    "the computational accuracy of transport properties is significantly improved by the present technique . as an application to demonstrate the potential power of the present technique ,",
    "the transport properties of a stone - wales ( sw ) defect@xcite in graphene and silicene are examined .",
    "in addition to industrial and scientific interest in two - dimensional materials with a honeycomb structure , the comparison between graphene and silicene is of importance because the electron - transport properties of an sw defect in silicene have not been intensively investigated so far in spite of its advantages over graphene . a sharp dip due to resonance scattering of the sw defect",
    "is observed in the conductance spectrum of silicene because the @xmath0 state lies near the fermi energy , while there are no strong dips in the spectrum of graphene in the calculated energy range .",
    "in addition , there are two conduction channels near the fermi energy in graphene and silicene .",
    "one conduction channel is less sensitive to the sw defect at the fermi energy while the electrons of the other channel are significantly scattered by the defect .",
    "this characteristic behavior of the transport properties of these two conduction channels is explained by the bonding arrangement of the bilattice of the honeycomb structure .",
    "owing to the excellent accuracy of the transmission coefficients obtained using the present technique , we can distinguish the different behaviors of these two conduction channels .",
