    "semiconductor physics and magnetism are established subfields of condensed matter physics that continue to reveal a rich variety of new phenomena , often in new types of solid state materials .",
    "the properties of semiconductors are extraordinarily sensitive to impurity atoms , defects , and charges on external gates .",
    "magnetism is a collective electronic phenomenon with an ordered state that is often stable to exceptionally high temperatures .",
    "magnetic order , when it is present , has a large impact on other material properties including transport and optical properties . in both semiconductor and magnetic cases , sophisticated and economically important technologies have been developed to exploit the unique electronic properties , mainly for information processing in the case of semiconductors and for information storage and retrieval in the case of magnetism .",
    "the realization of materials that combine semiconducting behavior with robust magnetism has long been a dream of material physics .",
    "one strategy for creating systems that are simultaneously semiconducting and magnetic , initiated in the late 1970 s @xcite , is to introduce local moments into well - understood semiconductors .",
    "the result is a new class of materials now known as diluted magnetic semiconductors ( dmss ) . over the past fifteen years , building on a series of pioneering publications in the 1990 s @xcite , it has been established that several ( iii , v ) compound semiconductors become ferromagnetic when heavily doped with mn , and that the ferromagnetic transition temperatures can be well above 100  k. in semiconductors like gaas and inas , mn has been shown to act both as an acceptor and as a source of local moments .",
    "these ( iii , mn)v materials are examples of ferromagnetic semiconductors , a phrase we reserve for magnetic systems in which ferromagnetism is due primarily to coupling between magnetic element moments that is mediated by conduction - band electrons or valence - band holes .",
    "this definition implies that in ferromagnetic semiconductors , magnetic properties can be influenced by the same assortment of engineering variables that are available for other more conventional semiconductor electronic properties . in the best understood arsenide dmss ,",
    "semiconductor valence - band carriers participate in the magnetic order .",
    "the materials require participation of valence band holes for the formation of a ferromagnetic state .",
    "efforts to increase their critical temperatures further run into incompletely understood fundamental limits on the ratio of the magnetic transition temperature to the fermi temperature of the free - carrier systems and the role of disorder in these heavily doped materials .",
    "the tension between achieving high curie temperatures and the desire for low , and therefore gateable , carrier densities , is among the major issues in the study of these materials .    in this article",
    "we review the considerable theoretical progress that has been made in understanding the very broad range of properties that occur in ( iii , mn)v ferromagnetic semiconductor epilayers in different regimes of mn content and defect density .",
    "the main focus of this article is on the extensively studied ( ga , mn)as ferromagnetic semiconductor , but we also make frequent comments on other ( iii , mn)v dmss . comparisons to experimental data are made throughout the article . in section",
    "i we review progress that has been achieved in the effort to realize useful dms materials for spintronics ( or magnetoelectronics ) . in section",
    "ii we discuss the properties of dilute mn atoms in a ( iii , v ) crystal , and the various mechanisms that can couple the orientations of distinct moments and lead to ferromagnetism . in section",
    "iii we discuss several different strategies that can be used to elevate material modeling from a qualitative to a more quantitative level .",
    "sections  iv - vii address a variety of different characteristics of ( iii , mn)v layers , including their structural , magnetic , magneto - transport , and magneto - optical properties . finally in section  viii",
    "we discuss the ferromagnetic ordering physics in ( iii , mn)v dmss in the broad context of magnetic interactions in systems with coupled local and itinerant moments , and then extrapolate from ( iii , mn)v materials to comment on the effort to find high temperature ferromagnetism in other dms materials .",
    "we conclude in section  ix with a brief summary .",
    "to partially remedy omissions in the bibliography that originate from our incomplete coverage of this topic , we refer to an extended database of published work and preprints maintained at http://unix12.fzu.cz/ms .",
    "the structure of the database is similar to the structure of this review and we encourage the reader in need of a more detailed bibliography to use this resource .",
    "a number of review articles on various aspects of the physics of dmss have been published previously and may help the reader who seeks a broader scope than we are able to supply in this review .",
    "the extensive body of research on dmss in the 1980 s , focused mostly on ( ii , mn)vi alloys , is reviewed in @xcite .",
    "several extended papers cover the experimental properties of ( iii , mn)v dmss , particularly ( ga , mn)as and ( in , mn)as , interpreted within the carrier - mediated ferromagnetism model @xcite .",
    "theoretical predictions based on this model for a number of properties of bulk dmss and heterostructures are reviewed in @xcite .",
    "a detailed description of wide band gap and oxide dmss can be found in @xcite .",
    "we also mention here several specialized theoretical reviews focusing on the predictions of density functional first principles calculations for ( iii , mn)v dmss @xcite , on mn - doped ii - vi and iii - v dmss in the low carrier density regime @xcite , and on effects of disorder in ( ga , mn)as @xcite .      iii - v materials are among the most widely used semiconductors .",
    "there is little doubt that ferromagnetism in these materials would enable a host of new microelectronics device applications if the following criteria were met : i ) the ferromagnetic transition temperature should safely exceed room temperature , ii ) the mobile charge carriers should respond strongly to changes in the ordered magnetic state , and iii ) the material should retain fundamental semiconductor characteristics , including sensitivity to doping , electric fields produced by gate charges , and sensitivity to light . for more than a decade these three key issues have been the focus of intense experimental , and theoretical research into the material properties of mn - doped iii - v compounds . at first sight ,",
    "fundamental obstacles appear to make the simultaneous achievement of these objectives unlikely .",
    "nevertheless , interest in this quest remains high because of the surprising progress that has been achieved .",
    "highlights of this scientific endeavor are briefly reviewed in this introductory chapter .      under equilibrium growth conditions the incorporation of magnetic mn ions into iii - as",
    "semiconductor crystals is limited to approximately 0.1% . beyond this doping level ,",
    "surface segregation and phase separation occur . to circumvent the solubility problem a non - equilibrium ,",
    "low - temperature molecular - beam - epitaxy ( lt - mbe ) technique was applied and led to first successful growth of ( in , mn)as and ( ga , mn)as dms ternary alloys with more than 1% mn .",
    "since the first report in 1992 of a ferromagnetic transition in @xmath0-type ( in , mn)as at a critical temperature @xmath1  k @xcite , the unfolding story of critical temperature limits in ( iii , mn)v dmss has gone through different stages .",
    "initial experiments in ( in , mn)as suggested an intimate relation between the ferromagnetic transition and carrier localization , reminiscent of the behavior of manganites ( perovskite ( la , a)mno@xmath2 with a = ca , sr , or ba ) in which ferromagnetism arises from a zener double exchange process associated with d - electron hopping between mn ions @xcite .",
    "( we comment at greater depth on qualitative pictures of the ferromagnetic coupling in sections  [ micro - general ] and [ discussion - general ] . )",
    "this scenario was corroborated by a pioneering theoretical ab - initio study of the ( in , mn)as ferromagnet @xcite and the mechanism was also held responsible for mediating ferromagnetic mn - mn coupling in some of the first ferromagnetic ( ga , mn)as samples with @xmath3 s close to 50  k @xcite .    in 1998",
    "the tohoku university group announced a jump of @xmath3 in @xmath0-type ( ga , mn)as to 110  k @xcite and pointed out that the critical temperature value was consistent with the kinetic - exchange mechanism for ferromagnetic coupling , also first proposed by zener ( see section  [ micro - general ] ) . in its simplest form , ferromagnetism in this picture",
    "follows @xcite from ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yosida ( rkky ) indirect coupling between mn @xmath4-shell moments mediated by induced spin - polarization in a free - hole itinerant carrier system ( see sections  [ micro - general ] , [ bulk - mag - tc - sw ] and [ discussion - general ] ) .",
    "zener proposed this mechanism originally for transition metal ferromagnets for which the applicability of this picture is now known to be doubtful because of the itinerant character of transition metal @xmath4-electrons .",
    "the model of mn(@xmath5 ) local moments that are exchange - coupled to itinerant @xmath6-band carriers does however provide a good description of mn - doped iv - vi and ii - vi dmss @xcite . the key difference between ( iii , mn)v materials like ( ga ,",
    "mn)as and iv - vi and ii - vi dmss is that mn substituting for the trivalent cation ( ga ) is simultaneously an acceptor and a source of magnetic moments .",
    "theoretical critical temperature calculations based on the kinetic - exchange model predict room temperature ferromagnetism in ( ga , mn)as with 10% mn content . in spite of these optimistic predictions , the goal of breaking the 110  k record in ( ga , mn)as remained elusive for nearly four years . only recently has progress in mbe growth and in the development of post - growth annealing techniques @xcite made it possible to suppress extrinsic effects , pushing @xmath3 in ( ga , mn)as up to 173  k @xcite .",
    "@xmath3 trends in current high quality ( ga , mn)as epilayers are consistent with the zener kinetic - exchange model @xcite . the current @xmath3 record should be broken if dms material with a higher concentration of substitutional mn ions can be grown .",
    "based on the few experimental and theoretical studies reported to date , ( iii , mn)sb dmss are expected to fall into the same category as ( ga , mn)as and ( in , mn)as dms .",
    "the kinetic - exchange model calculations predict @xmath3 s that are small compared to their arsenide counterparts @xcite .",
    "this difference , confirmed by experiment @xcite , is caused by the weaker @xmath7 exchange and smaller magnetic susceptibility ( smaller effective mass ) of itinerant holes in the larger unit - cell antimonides .",
    "also consistent with the kinetic - exchange model is the remarkable observation of an increase of @xmath3 in ( in , mn)sb by 25% induced by the applied hydrostatic pressure @xcite .    moving in the opposite direction in the periodic table towards ( iii , mn)p and ( iii",
    ", mn)n appears to be the natural route to high @xmath3 ferromagnetic semiconductors .",
    "the kinetic - exchange model predicts @xmath3 s far above room temperature in these smaller lattice constant materials , in particular in ( ga , mn)n @xcite . also the solubility limit of mn is much larger than in arsenides , making it possible in principle to grow highly mn - doped dmss under or close to equilibrium conditions .",
    "however , the nature of the magnetic interactions in mn - doped phosphides and nitrides is not completely understood either theoretically or experimentally @xcite .",
    "as the valence band edge moves closer to the mn @xmath4-level and the @xmath7 hybridization increases with increasing semiconductor gap width and decreasing lattice constant , charge fluctuations of the @xmath4-states may become large @xcite . with increasing ionicity of the host crystal , the mn impurity may also undergo a transition from a @xmath5 divalent acceptor to a @xmath8 trivalent neutral impurity @xcite . in either case",
    ", the picture of ferromagnetism based on the zener kinetic - exchange model needs to be revisited in these materials .",
    "experimental critical temperatures close to 1000  k have been reported in some ( ga , mn)n samples @xcite .",
    "it is still unclear , however , whether the high - temperature ferromagnetic phase should be attributed to a ( ga , mn)n ternary alloy or to the presence of ferromagnetic metal precipitates embedded in the host gan lattice .",
    "reports of ( ga , mn)n epilayers synthesized in cubic and hexagonal crystal structures , of p - type and n - type ferromagnetic ( ga , mn)n , and of multiple ferromagnetic phases in one material all add to the complex phenomenology of these wide - gap dmss @xcite .",
    "uncertainties apply also to the interpretation of ferromagnetism seen in the ( ga , mn)p samples studied to date , which have been prepared by post mbe ion - implantation of mn followed by rapid thermal @xcite or pulse laser melting annealing @xcite . experiments in these materials have not yet established unambiguously the nature of magnetic interactions in the ( iii , mn)p compounds . however ,",
    "a comparative study of ( ga , mn)p and ( ga , mn)as prepared by the post mbe ion - implantation and pulse laser melting annealing suggests carrier mediated origin of ferromagnetism in the ( ga , mn)p material @xcite .    our current understanding of the material physics of ( iii , mn)v dms epilayers suggests that synthesis of room temperature ferromagnetic semiconductor will require a level of doping and defect control comparable to what has now been achieved in high quality ( ga , mn)as samples , mn densities of order 10% , and may require the use of wider gap iii - v alloys .",
    "finally , we note that efforts to enhance curie temperature in mn - doped ( iii , v ) semiconductors have also led to material research in more complex semiconductor heterostructures with highly mn - doped monolayers ( @xmath9-doped layers ) , showing promising results @xcite .",
    "spintronic devices exploit the electron spin to manipulate the flow of electrons and therefore require materials in which the charge and spin degrees of freedom of carriers are strongly coupled @xcite .",
    "the most robust , and currently the most useful , spintronic devices rely on the collective behavior of many spins in ferromagnetic materials to amplify the coupling of external magnetic fields to electronic spins , a coupling that is very weak for individual electrons .",
    "the intrinsically large spin - orbit interaction in iii - sb and iii - as valence band states makes these hosts ideal candidates for exploring various spintronic functionalities . in ( ga ,",
    "mn)as dms epilayers , for example , the measured anisotropic magneto - resistance ( amr ) effect ( the relative difference between longitudinal resistivities for different magnetization orientations ) can reach @xmath10% @xcite .",
    "a particularly strong manifestation of valence - band spin - orbit coupling occurs in the antisymmetric off - diagonal element of the resistivity tensor .",
    "the anomalous hall effect ( ahe ) shown in fig .",
    "[ ahe_nott ] , which completely dominates the low - field hall response in ( ga , mn)as and some other iii - v dmss , has become one of the key tools used to detect the paramagnetic / ferromagnetic transition @xcite . its large value is due to the spin - polarization of holes and provides strong evidence for the participation of mobile charge carriers in the ordered magnetic state of these dmss .    in metals ,",
    "the current response to changes in the magnetic state is strongly enhanced in layered structures consisting of alternating ferromagnetic and non - magnetic materials .",
    "the giant magneto - resistance effect @xcite which is widely exploited in current technology , for example in field - sensors and magnetic random - access memories , reflects the large difference between resistivities in configurations with parallel and antiparallel polarizations of ferromagnetic layers in magnetic superlattices or trilayers like spin - valves and magnetic tunnel junctions @xcite .",
    "the effect relies on transporting spin information between layers and therefore is sensitive to spin - coherence times in the system . despite strong spin - orbit coupling which reduces spin coherence in dmss ,",
    "functional spintronic trilayer devices can be built , as demonstrated by the measured large mr effects in ( ga , mn)as based tunneling structures @xcite .",
    "the coercivities of individual dms layers can be tuned via exchange - biasing to an antiferromagnet @xcite which is a standard technique used in metal giant - magnetoresistance devices @xcite .",
    "dms ferromagnets possess all the properties that are exploited in conventional spintronics .",
    "they qualify as ferromagnetic semiconductors to the extent that their magnetic and other properties can be altered by the usual semiconductor electronics engineering variables .",
    "the achievement of ferromagnetism in an ordinary iii - v semiconductor that includes several per cent of mn demonstrates on its own the sensitivity of magnetic properties to doping .",
    "remarkably , doping profiles and , correspondingly magnetic properties can be grossly changed , even after growth , by annealing .",
    "early studies of ( ga , mn)as indicated that annealing at temperatures above the growth temperature leads to a reduction of magnetically and electrically active mn ions and , at high enough annealing temperatures , to the formation of mnas clusters @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "annealing at temperatures below the growth temperature can substantially improve magnetic and transport properties of the thin dms layers due to the out - diffusion of charge and moment compensating defects , now identified as interstitial mn @xcite .",
    "( in , mn)as based field effect transistors were built to study electric field control of ferromagnetism in dmss .",
    "it has been demonstrated that changes in the carrier density and distribution in thin film dms systems due to an applied bias voltage can reversibly induce the ferromagnetic / paramagnetic transition @xcite .",
    "another remarkable effect observed in this magnetic transistor is electric field assisted magnetization reversal @xcite .",
    "this novel functionality is based on the dependence of the width of the hysteresis loop on bias voltage , again through the modified charge density profile in the ferromagnetic semiconductor thin film .",
    "experiments in which ferromagnetism in a ( iii , mn)v dms system is turned on and off optically add to the list of functionalities that result from the realization of carrier - induced ferromagnetism in a semiconductor host material @xcite .",
    "the observed emission of circularly polarized light from a semiconductor heterostructure , in which electrons ( holes ) injected from one side of the structure recombine with spin - polarized holes ( electrons ) emitted from a dms layer @xcite , is an example of phenomena that may lead to novel magneto - optics applications .",
    "tunneling anisotropic magnetoresistance ( tamr ) is another novel spintronic effect observed in ( ga , mn)as @xcite .",
    "tamr , like amr , arises from spin - orbit coupling and reflects the dependence of the tunneling density of states of the ferromagnetic layer on the orientation of the magnetization with respect to the current direction or the crystallographic axes .",
    "the larger characteristic electronic length scales in dmss compared to ferromagnetic metals make it possible to lithographically define lateral structures with independent magnetic areas coupled through depleted regions that act as tunnel barriers and magnetic weak links .",
    "the electrical response to magnetization reversals in these spintronic nanodevices can lead to mr effects with magnitudes of order 1000% @xcite , as shown in fig .",
    "[ point_cont ] , and with a rich phenomenology @xcite .",
    "wider lateral constrictions have been used to demonstrate controlled domain - wall nucleation and propagation in dms stripes @xcite , a prerequisite for developing semiconductor logic gates based on magnetic domain manipulation @xcite .",
    "( ga , mn)as nanoconstrictions with lateral side gates have revealed a new effect , coulomb blockade anisotropic magnetoresistance , which reflects the magnetization orientation dependence of the single - electron charging energy @xcite .",
    "these spintronic single - electron transistors offer a route to non - volatile , low - field , and highly electro- and magneto - sensitive operation .",
    "the magnetic dipole - dipole interaction strength between two discrete moments separated by a lattice constant in a typical solid is only @xmath11 1 kelvin , relegating direct magnetic interactions to a minor role in the physics of condensed matter magnetic order .",
    "relativistic effects that lead to spin - orbit coupling terms in the hamiltonian provide more plausible source of phenomena that are potentially useful for spintronics .",
    "although these terms are critical for specific properties like magnetic anisotropy , they are rarely if ever crucial for the onset of the magnetic order itself .",
    "instead the universal ultimate origin of ferromagnetism is almost always the interplay between the electronic spin degree of freedom , repulsive coulomb interactions between electrons , and the fermionic quantum statistics of electrons .",
    "the pauli exclusion principle correlates spin and orbital parts of the many - electron wavefunction by requiring the total wavefunction to be antisymmetric under particle exchange .",
    "whenever groups of electrons share the same spin state , the orbital part of the many - body wavefunction is locally antisymmetric , lowering the probability of finding electrons close together and hence the interaction energy of the system . because magnetic order is associated with the strong repulsive coulomb interactions between electrons",
    ", it can persist to very high temperatures , often to temperatures comparable to those at which crystalline order occurs .",
    "ferromagnetism can be as strong as chemical bonds .",
    "very often the quantum ground state of a many electron system has non - zero local spin - density , either aligned in the same direction in space at every point in the system as in simple ferromagnets , or in non - collinear , ferrimagnetic , or antiferromagnetic materials in configurations in which the spin direction varies spatially .",
    "although this statement on the origin of magnetic order has very general validity , its consequences for a system of nuclei with a particular spatial arrangement , are extraordinarily difficult to judge . because ferromagnetism is a strong - coupling phenomenon , rigorous theoretical analyses are usually not possible .",
    "there is no useful universal theory of magnetism .",
    "understanding magnetic order in a particular system or class of systems can be among the most challenging of solid state physics problems @xcite .",
    "for most systems , it is necessary to proceed in a partially phenomenological way , by identifying the local spins that order , and determining the magnitude and sign of the exchange interactions that couple them by comparing the properties of simplified ( often ` spin - only ' ) model hamiltonians with experimental observations .",
    "one approach that is totally free of phenomenological parameters is density functional theory ( dft ) , including its spin - density functional ( sdf ) generalizations in which energy functionals depend on charge and spin densities .",
    "although dft theory is exact in principle , its application requires that the formalism s exchange - correlation energy functional be approximated .",
    "approximate forms for this functional can be partially phenomenological ( making a pragmatic retreat from the _ ab initio _ aspiration of this approach ) and are normally based in part on microscopic calculations of correlation effects in the electron gas model system .",
    "this is the case for the often - used local ( spin ) density approximation ( l(s)da ) @xcite . for many magnetic metals ,",
    "in which correlations are somewhat similar to those in the electron gas model system , _ ab initio _ lsda theory provides a practical and sufficiently accurate solution of the magnetic many - body problem @xcite .",
    "this is particularly true for elemental transition metal ferromagnets fe , co , and ni and their alloys @xcite . in practice lsda theory functions as a mean - field theory in which the exchange - energy at each point in space increases with the self - consistently determined local spin density . with increasing computer power ,",
    "lsda theory has been applied to more complex materials , including dmss .    as we discuss below , both phenomenological and dft approaches provide valuable insight into ( iii , mn)v ferromagnetism .",
    "model hamiltonian theories are likely to remain indispensable because , when applicable , they provide more transparent physical pictures of ferromagnetism and often enable predictions of thermodynamic , transport , and other properties that are sometimes ( depending on material complexity ) , beyond the reach of _ ab initio _ theory techniques .",
    "of particular importance for dmss is the capability of model hamiltonians to describe localized electronic levels coincident with an itinerant - electron band which , strictly speaking , is beyond the reach of the effectively one - particle band theories of solids that emerge from lsda theory @xcite .",
    "interpreting experiments with model hamiltonian approaches can , on the other hand , be misleading if the model is too simplified and important aspects of the physics are absent from the model .",
    "what s more , even simplified models usually leave complex many - body problems that can not be completely solved .",
    "magnetism in ( ga , mn)as and some other ( iii , mn)v ferromagnets originates from the mn local moments .",
    "( as already pointed out , mn - doped phosphides and nitrides dmss are less well understood , however , local mn moments are likely to play an important role in these materials as well . ) the dependence of the energy of the system on the relative orientation of mn moments is generally referred to as an _ exchange _ interaction .",
    "this terminology is part of the jargon of magnetism and recognizes that fermi statistics is the ultimate origin .",
    "several types of qualitative effects that lead to exchange interactions can be separately identified when addressing magnetic order in ( iii , mn)v dmss ; the applicability of each and the relative importance of different effects may depend on the doping regime and on the host semiconductor material . in this section",
    "we first introduce the jargon that is commonly used in the magnetism literature , by briefly reviewing some of the effects that can lead to magnetic coupling , most of which have been recognized since near the dawn of quantum mechanics .    for spins carried by itinerant electrons ,",
    "exchange interactions are often most simply viewed from a momentum space rather than a real space point of view .",
    "stoner s _ itinerant - exchange _",
    "@xcite favors spontaneous spin - polarization of the entire electron gas because electrons are less likely to be close together and have strongly repulsive interactions when they are more likely to have the same spin .",
    "because the band energy is minimized by double - occupation of each bloch state , the stoner ferromagnetic instability occurs in systems with a large density of states at the fermi energy .",
    "this helps to explain , for example , why ferromagnetism occurs in the late _ 3d _ transition elements .",
    "a large density of states makes it possible to gain exchange energy by moving electrons from one spin - band to the other while keeping the kinetic energy cost sufficiently low .",
    "since the key spins in many ( iii , mn)v dms materials are localized the stoner mechanism does not drive ferromagnetism , although we will see in section  [ bulk - mag - tc ] that it still plays a minor supporting role .    in many systems , including ( iii , mn)v dmss , both the local nature of the moments and strong local coulomb interactions that suppress charge ( valence ) fluctuations play a key role and have to be included even in a minimal model .",
    "many mechanisms have been identified that couple localized spins in a solid .",
    "the origin of heisenberg s _ direct - exchange _ @xcite between two local spins is the difference between the coulomb energy of a symmetric orbital wavefunction ( antisymmetric singlet spin wavefunction ) state and an antisymmetric orbital wavefunction ( symmetric triplet spin wavefunction ) state .",
    "kramer s _ super - exchange _",
    "interaction @xcite , applies to local moments that are separated by a non - magnetic atom . in a crystal environment",
    ", an electron can be transferred from the non - magnetic atom to an empty shell of the magnetic atom and interact , via direct exchange , with electrons forming its local moment .",
    "the non - magnetic atom is polarized and is coupled via direct - exchange with all its magnetic neighbors . whether the resulting super - exchange interaction between the local moments is ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic depends on the relative sign of the two direct - exchange interactions @xcite . in ( iii , mn)v materials , superexchange gives an antiferromagnetic contribution to the interaction between mn moments located on neighboring cation sites .",
    "zener s _ double - exchange _",
    "mechanism @xcite also assumes an intermediate non - magnetic atom . in its usual form , this interaction occurs when the two isolated magnetic atoms have a different number of electrons in the magnetic shell and hopping through the intermediate non - magnetic atom involves magnetic - shell electrons .",
    "combined with the on - shell hund s rule , double - exchange couples the magnetic moments ferromagnetically .",
    "parallel spin alignment is favored because it increases the hopping probability and therefore decreases the kinetic energy of the spin - polarized electrons .",
    "a version of double - exchange , in which mn acceptor states form an impurity band with a mixed @xmath12-character , has often been referred to in the ( iii , mn)v literature . in this picture electrical conduction and mn - mn exchange coupling",
    "are both realized through hopping within an impurity band .",
    "the potential importance of double - exchange is greater at lower mn doping and in wider - gap ( iii , mn)v materials .    finally , we identify zener s _ kinetic - exchange _ @xcite or indirect exchange interaction .",
    "it arises in models with local , usually @xmath4-shell or @xmath13-shell , moments whose coupling is mediated by s- or p - band itinerant carriers .",
    "the local moments can have either a ferromagnetic direct exchange interaction with band electrons on the same site and/or an antiferromagnetic interaction due to hybridization between the local moment and band electrons on neighboring sites @xcite .",
    "polarization of band electrons due to the interaction at one site is propagated to neighboring sites . when the coupling is weak ( the band carrier polarization is weak , _",
    "e.g. _ , at temperatures near curie temperature ) , the effect is described by rkky theory which was originally applied to carrier mediated indirect coupling between nuclear moments @xcite and between local @xmath4-shell moments in metals @xcite .",
    "the range of this interaction can be long and the interactions between separate local moments can be either ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic and tend to vary in space on the length scale of the itinerant band s fermi wavelength . unlike the double - exchange case , magnetic order in this case does not lead to a significant change in the width of the conducting band .",
    "this type of mechanism certainly does play a role in ( iii , mn)v ferromagnetism , likely dominating in the case of strongly metallic ( ga , mn)as , ( in , mn)as , and mn - doped antimonides .",
    "there is no sharp distinction between impurity band double - exchange and kinetic - exchange interactions ; the former is simply a strong coupling , narrow band limit of the latter .    the starting point for developing a useful predictive model of ( iii , mn)v ferromagnetism is achieving a full understanding of the electronic state of a single mn impurity in the host lattice .",
    "we need to fully understand the character of the isolated local moments before we can critically discuss how they are coupled .",
    "the character of the local moment need not be the same in all ( iii , mn)v materials .",
    "the remaining subsections will focus on properties of a mn impurity in gaas and on the nature of ferromagnetic coupling in ( ga , mn)as and related arsenide and antimonide dmss . at the end of this section",
    ", we comment on how things might change in wider - gap hosts like gap and gan .      among all ( iii , v ) hosts ,",
    "mn impurity has been studied most extensively in gaas .",
    "the elements in the ( ga , mn)as compound have nominal atomic structures [ ar]@xmath14 for ga , [ ar]@xmath15 for mn , and [ ar]@xmath16 for as .",
    "this circumstance correctly suggests that the most stable and , therefore , most common position of mn in the gaas host lattice is on the ga site where its two @xmath17-electrons can participate in crystal bonding in much the same way as the two ga @xmath17-electrons .",
    "the substitutional mn@xmath18 , and the less common interstitial mn@xmath19 , positions are illustrated in fig .  [ mn_ga ] . because of the missing valence @xmath20-electron , the mn@xmath18 impurity acts as an acceptor . in the electrically neutral state , labeled as @xmath21 , mn@xmath18 has the character of a local moment with zero angular momentum and spin @xmath22 ( lnde g - factor @xmath23 ) and a moderately bound hole .",
    "the local moment is formed by three occupied @xmath24 bonding states with dominant @xmath25 ( @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 ) character and by two occupied @xmath29 ( @xmath30 , @xmath31 ) orbitals that are split from the @xmath25 states by the tetrahedral crystal field and do not strongly hybridize with the @xmath6-orbitals .",
    "all occupied @xmath4-orbitals have the same spin orientation and together comprise the @xmath22 local moment .",
    "the weakly bound hole occupies one of the three antibonding @xmath24 levels with dominant as 4@xmath0 character .",

    "other length scales that are characteristic for the physics of interest in these materials , like the fermi wavelengths of the valence band carriers , are also longer than the atomic length scale on which dft theory interrogates matter .",

    "an effective spin hamiltonian can be extracted from this approach if it is assumed that the interactions are pairwise and of heisenberg form . even when these assumptions are valid , the interaction extracted from these calculations is the sum of the interactions at a set of separations connected by the supercell lattice vector .",

    "this is particularly true in the very low - density isolated mn limit , _",

    "research to date has only scratched the surface of the volume of possibilities - we are truly still at the beginning of the road in studying diluted moment magnetism in semiconductors .",
    "each system brings its new challenges .",
    "the interpretation of simple magnetic and transport characterization measurements is often not immediately obvious , in particular because of the possibility that the moments will segregate into crystallites of one of a variety of available dense moment minority phases which are often thermodynamically more stable .",
    "in addition , magnetic properties will certainly depend in general not only on the dilute moment density , which normally is well controlled and variable , but also on the partitioning of local moments among many available sites in the host crystal which is not always known and is usually much harder to control .",
    "the search for promising dms materials would be simplified if _",
    "ab initio _ dft methods had reliable predictive power .",
    "unfortunately this luxury appears to be absent in many cases because of extreme sensitivity of magnetic properties to details of the electronic structure and because of strong correlation effects that are often present in these systems .",
    "we mention briefly in the following paragraphs some of the other classes of diluted magnetic semiconductors which have been studied .",

    "examples include p-(zn , mn)te : n @xcite and p-(be , mn)te : n @xcite .",
    "these materials differ from ( ga , mn)as mainly because the local moments and holes are provided by different types of impurities and can be controlled independently .",

    "the mn moment is charged and attracts holes .",
    "the tendency of holes to have a higher density near mn sites tends to increase the effective strength of the @xmath7 exchange interaction .",
    "this effect is magnified when two mn moments are on neighboring cation sites . in ( ga",

    "( for a discussion of the interplay between electrostatic and magnetic interactions see @xcite . ) in p - doped ( ii , mn)vi materials , competition between antiferromagnetic near neighbor interactions and the longer range carrier - mediated ferromagnetic interactions suppresses the magnetic ordering temperature .",

    "substitutional mn@xmath19 is particularly important in ( ga , mn)as because it reduces the number of free moments and reduces the density of the hole gas that mediates ferromagnetism .",
    "learning how to remove defects that are detrimental to strong magnetic order is key to creating useful materials .",
    "these two steps have been largely achieved in ( ga , mn)as . there is every reason to believe that if the same progress can be made in other dms materials , some will be even more magnetically robust .    we have reviewed in this article a number of theoretical approaches that shed light on what controls key properties of ferromagnetic ( iii , mn)v semiconductors .",
    "first principles electronic structure calculations give a good overview of fundamental material trends across the series and explain many of the structural characteristics of these alloys .",
    "semi - phenomenological microscopic tight - binding models provide a convenient way to use experimental information to improve the quantitative accuracy of the description .",
    "another phenomenological description that successfully models magnetic , magneto - transport , and magneto - optical properties is a single parameter theory that adopts a @xmath431 description for the host semiconductor valence bands , and assumes that the exchange interaction between local moments and band electrons is short - ranged and isotropic .",
    "the single exchange parameter that appears in this theory can be determined by fitting to known properties of an isolated mn local moment , leading to parameter - free predictions for ferromagnetism .",
    "qualitative models which focus on what kind of physics can occur generically for randomly located local moments that are exchange coupled to either localized or itinerant band electrons , also provide useful insights for interpreting experiments .    the most important properties of ( iii , mn)v materials are their curie temperature and ferromagnetic moment which reflect both the strength of the coupling between mn local spins and its range . the highest ferromagnetic transition temperatures in ( ga",
    ", mn)as epilayers have so far been achieved with substitutional mn@xmath18 fractions in the neighborhood of 5% by post - growth annealing which eliminates most of the interstitial mn ions .",
    "achieving @xmath3 values close to room temperature in ( ga , mn)as , which is expected to occur for 10% mn@xmath18 doping , appears to be essentially a material growth issue , albeit a very challenging one . in",
    "optimally annealed samples , experiment and theoretical considerations indicate that the mn - mn exchange interactions are sufficiently long range to produce a magnetic state that is nearly collinear and insensitive to micro - realization of the mn@xmath18 spatial distribution .",
    "magnetization and curie temperatures in these systems are well described by mean - field theory .",
    "the magnetic and transport properties of high - quality ( ga , mn)as materials are those of a low - moment - density , low - carrier - density metallic ferromagnet , with a few special twists . because of the strong spin - orbit interactions in the valence band , metallic ( ga , mn)as shows a large anomalous contribution to the hall effect and the source of magnetic and transport anisotropies is the more itinerant electrons , unlike the transition metal case in which anisotropies originate primarily in @xmath4-electron spin - orbit interactions . the small moment densities lead to a large magnetic hardness reflected in a single - domain - like behavior of many ( ga , mn)as thin films . they also explain a large part of the orders of magnitude reduction in the current densities required for transport manipulation of the magnetic state through spin - momentum - transfer effects .",
    "the low - carrier density of the itinerant holes responsible for magnetic coupling means that they are concentrated around a particular portion of the brillouin - zone in the valence band which has a large oscillator strength for optical transitions to the conduction band .",
    "this property opens up opportunities for optical manipulation of the magnetic state that do not exist in transition metal ferromagnets and have not yet been fully explored .",
    "the research which we have reviewed here that is aimed at an understanding of the optical properties of ( ga , mn)as ferromagnets is still incomplete , particularly for the most interesting ideal annealed materials , and will be important in setting the ground work for the exploration of new effects .",
    "these conclusions do not necessarily apply to all ( iii , mn)v ferromagnets .",
    "for example , material trends suggest that wider band - gap hosts would have stronger exchange scattering that would lower the conductivity , shorten the range of mn - mn exchange interactions , and increase the importance of quantum fluctuations in mn and band hole spin orientations .",
    "this could eventually lead to curie temperatures significantly below the mean - field estimates . in the opposite limit , when the exchange interaction is weak enough to be treated perturbatively , sign variations in the rkky mn - mn interaction are expected to lead to frustration and weaken ferromagnetism at large carrier densities .",
    "one of the important miracles of ( ga , mn)as ferromagnetism is that this effect is much weaker than would naively be expected because of the complex valence band structure . in ( ga , mn)as , incipient frustration that limits magnetic stiffness may be responsible for the weak dependence of ferromagnetic transition temperature on carrier density .",
    "this property of ( ga , mn)as suggests that little progress on the @xmath3 front is likely to be gained by non - magnetic acceptor co - doping .",
    "disorder is an inevitable part of the physics of all dms ferromagnets because of the random substitution of elements possessing moments for host semiconductor elements . even in metallic , ideal annealed samples",
    "that have only substitutional mn@xmath18 impurities , randomness in the mn microstructure leads to both coulomb and spin - dependent exchange potential scattering . for ( ga , mn)as",
    ", coulomb scattering dominates over exchange potential scattering , limiting the conductivity to @xmath455 .",
    "frustration and disorder are certainly very important near the onset of ferromagnetism at low mn density , where the network of exchange interactions that lead to long range order is still tenuous .",
    "studies of well characterized materials with low mn fraction near the metal - insulator transition are now possible because of progress in understanding the role of defects and are likely to exhibit complex interplay between disorder , and coulomb and exchange interactions .",
    "we thank all colleagues who have given us the permission to show their results in this review . among the many stimulating discussions we would like to especially acknowledge our interactions with experimentalists at the university of nottingham .",
