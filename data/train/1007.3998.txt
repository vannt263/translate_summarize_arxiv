    "umeda @xmath8 nomoto ( 2002 , 2005 ) and tominaga , umeda @xmath8 nomoto ( 2007 ) show that these trends can be related to the variations of explosion energy of core - collapse sne , i.e , high [ zn , co / fe ] and low [ cr , mn / fe ] can be explained by a high energy sn ( hypernova ) , while low [ zn , co / fe ] and high [ cr , mn / fe ] by a normal sn . on the other hand ,",
    "heger @xmath8 woosley ( 2008 ) studied the evolution and parameterized explosions of pop iii stars with masses ranging from 10 to 100 @xmath6 .",
    "they have concluded that the emp stars do not show the need for a hn component , and that explosion energies less than 1.2 b seem to be preferred , though their models tend to underproduce co and zn .",
    "these previous works do not include any contribution from hot bubbles in the innermost region of sne .",
    "however , recent multi - dimensional simulations have shown that both the neutron - rich and proton - rich matter in hot - bubbles are ejected from the hot - bubble regions ( e.g. , janka et al .",
    "this innermost matter with various @xmath0 and entropy is considered to be the origin of the heavier elements than zn , but also can be the important site for the lighter elements ( e.g. , hoffman et al .",
    "heger @xmath8 woosley ( 2008 ) suggest that co and zn in their models can be enhanced by this innermost matter .",
    "our previous work , izutani , umeda @xmath8 tominaga ( 2009 ) have studied nucleosynthesis of lighter neutron - capture elements ( weak r - process elements ) , sr , y , and zr by considering small amount of mass ejection from below the conventional mass - cut , or from the hot - bubble regions . in that paper",
    ", we assumed that the `` hot - bubble '' matter has the same entropy with the supernova shock , though in reality it may have higher entropy ( e.g. , in janka et al . 2003",

    "we have found that hn models with neutron - rich matter can reproduce these elements , but normal sn models can not when we assume the same entropy with the supernova shock for the matter below the mass - cut .",
    "however , from the observational trends of [ zn / fe ] and [ sr / fe ] ( see figure 15 and discussion in izutani et al .",
    "2009 ) , it is highly possible that the main origin of the weak r - process is normal sne .",
    "in addition to it , some weak r - process stars have also mo , ru , and rh , though hn model can not reproduce those elements .",

    "we discuss whether normal sne with the high - entropy hot - bubble component can reproduce the observations of emp stars especially paying attention to fe - peak elements .",

    "therefore , the trends of their values are similar with the ones seen in figure 2 , but on the other hand , their exact values are different between figure 2 and figure 3 because the total ejecta includes the incomplete si - burning region where fe is produced , but co and zn are not .",
    "for example , [ zn / fe ] is @xmath5 0.6 , and [ co / fe ] is @xmath5 0.2 in the total ejecta of hn3 ( open cyan triangle in figure 3 ) , while [ zn / fe ] is @xmath5 0.9 , and [ co / fe ] is @xmath5 0.4 in the complete si - burning region ( blue and magenta horizontal lines in figure 2 ) .",
    "the gradient of [ co / fe ] vs. [ zn / fe ] in emp stars is larger than that of the normal sn models with hot - bubble component .",

    "[ co / fe ] becomes higher , and the hn models reproduce the observations well .",
    "for example , [ zn / fe ] is @xmath5 0.6 , and [ co / fe ] is @xmath5 0.2 in the hn3 model with @xmath0 = 0.50 ( cyan open triangle with letters `` hn3 0.50 '' in figure 3 ) , while [ zn / fe ] is @xmath5 0.6 , and [ co / fe ] is @xmath5 0.3 in the hn3 model with @xmath0 = 0.5001 ( cyan open triangle with letters `` hn3 0.5001 '' in figure 3 ) .",
    "in this letter we have confirmed that only hypernova type mass ejection can reproduce abundance of fe - peak elements in emp stars , and neither neutron- or proton - rich high - entropy matter ejection can help .",
    "this also means that if normal sne eject hypernova - like matter below @xmath15 , then even normal sne can reproduce [ co , zn / fe ] in emp stars .",
    "more quantitatively , we find that the observations require ejection of as much as 0.06 @xmath20 matter with @xmath0 @xmath19 0.500 - 0.501 with @xmath3/@xmath4 @xmath5 15 - 40",

    "therefore , this solution seems too contrived , though sn explosion mechanism is still uncertain and thus we can not conclusively deny such a possibility .",
    "here we discuss the additional cases with the different timescales , the time it takes the flow to cool from some temperature to lower temperature . as a result ,",
    "[ co / fe ] is changed by the timescale below @xmath25 = 4 @xmath23 10@xmath26 k ( pruet et al . 2005 ) .",
    "the timescale below @xmath25 = 4 @xmath23 10@xmath26 k multiplied by a factor of 1/2 and 2 gives [ co / fe ] @xmath5 0.5 and 0.2 , respectively , while [ co / fe ] @xmath5 0.4 in the case with the original timescale as mentioned in section 5 .",
    "however , ye range and ejected mass needed is not so changed ; the upper limit of ye becomes a little larger , ye @xmath5 0.502 , and ejected mass , a little smaller @xmath5 0.03 @xmath6 .",
    "there is another reason why sn models are not favored to explain large [ co , zn / fe ] stars .",
    "as mentioned in introduction , [ co / fe ] decreases with higher metallicity , and many stars show [ co / fe ] @xmath5 0 when [ fe / h ] @xmath17 -2.5 . at this age , only core - collapse sne are considered to contribute to interstellar matter from the observation of [ @xmath11-elements / fe ] .",
    "if the typical value of [ co / fe ] in normal sn is @xmath5 0.3 , [ co / fe ] does not decrease to @xmath5 0 at [ fe / h ] @xmath5 -2.5 . on the other hand ,",
    "imf average of the supernova ejecta can be [ co , zn / fe ] @xmath5 0 even though hn models have large [ co , zn / fe ] ( tominaga et al . 2007 ) .",
    "therefore , we suggest that co and zn in emp stars originated from hne , not from normal sne . as for weak r - process elements ,",
    "it is not clear that sr - zr rich weak r - process stars are always mo - rh rich .",
    "observational data of both sr - zr and mo - rh are obtained in only two weak r - process stars hd122563 and hd88609 ( honda et al .",

    "of course , this work is only parametric search , and some other possibilities may exist in reality .",
