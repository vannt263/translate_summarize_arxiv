    "let us consider the following system of differential equations @xmath0 where @xmath1 are the functions of variables @xmath2 .",
    "if we know the jacobi multiplier @xmath3 defined by @xmath4 and know @xmath5 independent first integrals @xmath6 , we can integrate this system by quadratures .",
    "namely , according to the euler - jacobi theorem , in this case we can introduce new variables @xmath7 by rule @xmath8 in @xmath9-variables the initial system of equations has the following form @xmath10 or @xmath11 using the definition ( [ y - mera ] ) of the jacobi multiplier @xmath12 @xmath13 we can prove that @xmath14 is the total differential .",
    "so , there is one more independent first integral @xmath15 of course , this only a formal definition of the integral , which may be not well defined on the whole phase space .    nevertheless , it is well - known that any @xmath16-dimensional dynamical system with the functionally independent @xmath17 first integrals and with the jacobi multiplier @xmath12 may be rewritten in the hamiltonian form @xmath18 according to the valle - poussin theorem on functional determinants @xcite . here",
    "@xmath19 is a rank - two poisson bivector and @xmath20 is a function on @xmath21 , see details in @xcite .",
    "for instance , we can put @xmath22 so that @xmath23 and @xmath24 other brackets are equal to zero .",
    "the corresponding rank - two bivector @xmath19 is the poisson bivector iff @xmath25 if we choose variables @xmath7 so that the ratio @xmath26 is independent of @xmath27 , then the hamiltonization of dynamical equations ( [ eqy - ham ] ) is equivalent to the existence of an invariant measure because @xmath28=0\\,,\\qquad\\leftrightarrow\\qquad \\sum_{i=1}^k \\dfrac{\\partial \\mu x_i}{\\partial y_i}=0\\,.\\ ] ] here @xmath29 $ ] is a schouten bracket .",
    "such rank - two poisson structures for many nonholonomic systems are well - studied @xcite . moreover , there are some examples of rank - four poisson structures for other nonholonomic systems @xcite .",
    "the main aim of this note is to discuss rank - two and rank - four poisson structures for the nonholonomic stbler model , which describes rolling without sliding of a uniform ball on a cylindrical surface .",
    "let us consider a homogeneous ball with mass @xmath30 , radius @xmath31 and tensor of inertia @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is a unit matrix .",
    "we are going to study the case when the ball rolls without sliding on the surface having only one point in common with it during the entire motion .",
    "in rigid body dynamics it is customary to introduce a body - fixed frame of reference .",
    "however , while studying the motion of a homogeneous ball , it is more convenient to write the equations of motion with respect to a certain frame of reference fixed in space @xcite .",
    "the surface is defined by the equation @xmath34 and the rolling ball is subject to two kinds of constraints : the holonomic constraint of motion on the surface and no slip nonholonomic constraint associated with the zero velocity at the point of contact @xmath35 where we denote the velocity of the ball s center by @xmath36 , the angular velocity of the ball by @xmath37 and the vector joining the ball s center with the contact point by @xmath38 .",
    "if @xmath39 is the reaction force at the contact point , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the external force and its moment with respect to the contact point , then the conservation principles of linear and angular momentum read as @xmath42 substituting @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is a normal to the surface , and eliminating the reaction force @xmath39 , one gets the following equations of motion @xmath45 which define vector field @xmath46 on the six - dimensional phase space with local coordinates @xmath47 . here",
    "@xmath48 and the vectors @xmath37 and @xmath49 are functions of @xmath50 defined by the following relations @xmath51 remind that all the vectors are expressed in the space frame @xcite .",
    "if external force @xmath40 is a potential force associated with potential @xmath52 , then @xmath53 and equations ( [ ball - eqm ] ) possess first integrals @xmath54 below we consider a homogeneous ball rolling on the inner side of the cylindrical surface .",
    "apparently routh and stbler were first to explore this problem @xcite .",
    "following @xcite let us consider ball on a cylindrical surface .",
    "as before , , the ball has only one poimt of the contact with the surface and , as usual , it is assumed that there is no slipping .",
    "r0.3     let us choose a fixed frame of reference , with the axis @xmath55 directed along axis forming the cylinder .",
    "in this case the symmetry group @xmath56 consists of the ball s rotations and of parallel translations along the @xmath55 axis .",
    "we can add potential @xmath57 depending only on the coordinate @xmath58 without loss of integrability of the system .",
    "so below we will consider ball in a gravitational field with potential @xmath59 the vector of a normal to a surface at a point of contact looks like @xmath60 the projections of the normal @xmath61 and of the vector of the center of mass of the ball @xmath62 onto the normal cross - section satisfy to evident geometrical relations @xmath63 hence , we conclude that @xmath64 is parallel to @xmath65 , i.e. @xmath66 the factor @xmath67 is completely determined by the geometry of the cylinder s cross - section and does not depend on the angular velocity .    in this",
    "case equations ( [ ball - eqm ] ) look like [ cyl - eqm ] & = & ( m , e_z)-mge_z , d = m^2r , +   + & = & e_z,=(m , e_z).here @xmath68 is a unit vector along the axis @xmath55 , where @xmath69 .",
    "equations of motion ( [ cyl - eqm ] ) define the six - dimensional vector field @xmath46 with the invariant volume form [ mu - cyl ] = f()ddzdm , with three polynomial integrals of motion @xmath70 and two rational integrals @xcite [ cyl - int ] j_k = v_1^(k)m_1+v_2^(k)m_2-,k=1,2 .",
    "of course , multiplying these integrals by @xmath71 , we obtain polynomial integrals of motion .    if @xmath72 then the functions @xmath73 in the two last integrals of motion [ cyl - v ]    l v_1^(k)=_2 ^ 3/2l^(k)(-,,_1),v_3^(k)=d , +   + v_2^(k)=1_2 ^ 3/2(+1 ) ( l^(k)(+12,32,_1)-_1(_2 ^ 2(+1)+1)l^(k)(-12,32,_1 ) ) +    are expressed by the associated legendre functions of the first and second kinds @xmath74 and their integrals .",
    "in fact any solution of ( [ cyl - eqm ] ) may be obtained from the solution of a single equation [ phi - eqm ] = ad^-1(1-^2 ) f ( ) , where @xmath38 is a value of the integral of motion @xmath71 and @xmath75 is a smooth bounded @xmath76-periodic function .",
    "other variables are functions of @xmath77 and of the values of integrals of motion .",
    "let us pass from variables @xmath78 to variables @xmath79 by the rule @xmath80 in the new variables the initial system of the equations ( [ cyl - eqm ] ) has the form ( [ eqy - in ] ) and the corresponding functions @xmath81 are independent on the hamiltonian @xmath82 .",
    "so , we can introduce the rank - two poisson bivector @xmath19 ( [ y - poi ] ) , which allows us to identify initial vector field @xmath46 ( [ cyl - eqm ] ) @xmath83 with the hamiltonian vector field @xmath84 .    according to the construction of the poisson bivector @xmath19 , its casimir functions are equal to @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 @xmath88 whereas geometric integral of motion @xmath89 is not a casimir function and by definition ( [ y - poi ] ) we can prove that the poisson bracket @xmath90 is equal to the density of the invariant measure .",
    "so , we have some `` non physical '' rank - two poisson structure , which allows us to rewrite initial vector field in the hamiltonian form @xmath91      let us present poisson brackets associated with the obtained poisson bivector @xmath19 , in the special case @xmath92 here @xmath93 is the radius of the circular cylinder . in this case we can easily express the initial @xmath50 variables via auxiliary ( formal ) variables @xmath9 : _",
    "1&=&y_1,_2=y_2,m_3=y_4 , +   + m_1&= & + +   + & + & , + m_2&= & + +   + & + & +   + z&=&-(y_3 + - . +   + & + & .+).it allows us to get an explicit form of the poisson brackets for the initial @xmath50-variables . for instance , one gets \\{_1,z}_y&=&-++ , +   + \\{_1,m_1}_y&=&- + -,[poi21 ]",
    "+   + \\{_1,m_2}_y&= & -+ + .other brackets are more bulky and we will omit here their explicit expressions for brevity .",
    "so , we obtain sufficiently complicated second - rank poisson structure using the euler - jacobi theorem . of course",
    ", for the stbler problem with five integrals of motion we can get a few such poisson structures .",
    "a little more conventional from the kinematic point of view poisson brackets may be obtained in the following way .",
    "using reduction by the geometric integral of motion @xmath94 we can consider a vector field on the five - dimensional phase space with coordinates @xmath95 and only after that change variables @xmath96 : @xmath97 in this case equation ( [ phi - eqm ] ) for a circular cylinder looks like @xmath98 in contrast with the previous case the integral of motion @xmath99 is not a casimir function .",
    "the corresponding poisson brackets for the initial @xmath50 variables are : @xmath100 and \\{,z}_y&=&,\\{m_3,z}_y=- , + \\{z , m_1}_y&= & + & - & , +   + \\{z , m_2}_y&= & + & - & , + \\{m_3,m_1}_y&=&r_c(^2 - 1)(m_1-m_2)+ , +",
    "\\{m_3,m_1}_y&=-&r_c(^2 - 1)(m_1-m_2)+.we have to emphasize that one gets poisson brackets rational in momenta depending on the potential , in contrast wits all the known poisson brackets for other nonholonomic systems @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , this rank - two poisson structure also allows us to identify the initial vector field with the hamiltonian vector field .",
    "let us come back from the circular cylinder to the generic cylindrical surface .",
    "in order to get a rank - four poisson structure in this paper we use the brute force approach proposed in @xcite .    as above",
    "we start with the euler - jacobi theorem .",
    "namely , six equations of motion ( [ cyl - eqm ] ) possess four integrals of motion @xmath101 and the invariant measure ( [ mu - cyl ] ) and , therefore , they are integrable by quadratures according to the euler - jacobi theorem .    if we identify the common level surfaces of integrals @xmath102 with the lagrangian foliation of symplectic leaves of some unknown rank - four poisson bivector @xmath103 , then the following equations must hold : @xmath104=0\\,,\\qquad \\{h_k , h_m\\}=\\sum_{i , j=1}^6 p_{ij}\\,\\dfrac{\\partial h_k}{\\partial x_i}\\dfrac{\\partial h_m}{\\partial x_j}=0\\,,\\qquad k , m=1,\\ldots,4,\\ ] ] where @xmath29 $ ] is the schouten bracket . remind , that the schouten bracket @xmath105 $ ] of two bivectors @xmath106 and @xmath107 is a trivector whose entries in local coordinates @xmath50 on @xmath108 are @xmath109_{ijk}=-\\sum\\limits_{m=1}^{dim\\ , \\mathcal m}\\left(b_{mk}\\dfrac{\\partial a_{ij}}{\\partial x_m } + a_{mk } \\dfrac{\\partial b_{ij}}{\\partial x_m}+\\mathrm{cycle}(i , j , k)\\right).\\ ] ] if @xmath110=0 $ ] , bivector @xmath103 is a poisson bivector .",
    "the brute force method consists of a direct solution of equations ( [ geom - eq ] ) with respect to entries of the bivector @xmath103 using an appropriate anzats .",
    "recall that apriory these equations have infinitely many solutions @xcite and using an anzats we can obtain some partial solutions in a constructive way .",
    "below we use the following simple anzats @xmath111 where @xmath112 and @xmath113 are unknown functions of @xmath44 and @xmath58 .    in this class of bivectors ( [ p - anz ] ) equations ( [ geom - eq ] ) have nontrivial solutions if and only if @xmath114 in this case there are two nontrivial solutions [ cyl - p ] p^(k)=(_1,_2,z ) (    cc 0 & _",

    "rank - four poisson bivectors are more interesting .",
    "remind that if we identify the common level surfaces of integrals of motion with lagrangian foliation with respect to some poisson bivector later we can try to identify the common level surfaces of integrals of motion with bi - lagrangian foliation with respect to some poisson pencil and then with some subvariety of the jacoby variety associated with some algebraic curve related with this pencil .",
    "of course , in this concrete model we can directly solve equations of motion without of these sophisticated mathematical tools ."
