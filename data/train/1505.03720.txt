    "[ ! ]    * signatures of multiple magnetic transitions . * in agreement with the published results @xcite , our magnetic susceptibility data @xmath12 above 80k for * b*@xmath18 yield ferromagnetic character [ @xmath13=2.7(1)k ; see methods ] as well as a clear maximum at much higher temperature of 14(1)k ( fig.[bulk]a ) . similarly , specific - heat results show a pronounced hump at 12(1)k ( fig.[bulk]b ) , which corresponds to the magnetic part of the specific heat @xmath19 that develops on top of the usual lattice contribution @xmath20 @xcite ( see methods ) , as expected for a low - dimensional system . at lower temperatures ,",
    "distinct @xmath21-type anomalies are observed at @xmath15 and @xmath17 , whereas the kink at @xmath16 is more subtle ( fig.[bulk]d ) . when the magnetic field of 3 t is applied along the @xmath22 axis",
    ", the anomaly at @xmath17 disappears , implying that the zero - field magnetic ground state is suppressed .    [ !",
    "]    this corroborates with the magnetization measured for the same orientation of the magnetic field at 1.7k , i.e , well below @xmath17 , which exhibits two distinct anomalies at @xmath23=2.8 t ( fig.[bulk]c ) and at @xmath24=18.7 t and finally reaches full saturation at @xmath25=21.5 t ( fig.[pd]c ) .",
    "a detailed inspection reveals an additional inflection point at @xmath26=4.5(4)t ( fig.[bulk]c ) . evidently , below @xmath17 , @xmath0-tevo@xmath1 undergoes three magnetic - field - induced transitions before reaching full magnetization saturation .",
    "* incommensurability revealed by neutron diffraction .",
    "* neutron experiments disclose a zero - field spiral magnetic ground state existing below @xmath17 that can be described with a single magnetic wave vector * k*=(@xmath27  0  0.423 ) ( fig.[nd]a ) ( see methods ) .",
    "the observed incommensurability is a clear signature of the magnetic frustration .",
    "therefore , the modelling of @xmath12 with the bonner - fisher model of the simple nn spin-1/2 chain @xcite is not appropriate . considering the zigzag - chain structure ( fig.[pd]b ) ,",
    "the frustration in @xmath0-tevo@xmath1 must originate from the competition between the nn and the nnn exchange interactions , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "indeed , the nn bond is similar to the corner - sharing v@xmath14o@xmath14v bridge in cdvo@xmath28 @xcite and may carry ferromagnetic exchange @xcite .",
    "the nnn bridge , on the other hand , involves the te@xmath11 lone - pair cation , capable of bridging sizable antiferromagnetic exchange interactions @xcite .",
    "the pitch angle between two nn spins in a zigzag chain is classically defined as @xmath29=arccos(@xmath30 ) @xcite , reflecting in @xmath31=@xmath32 .",
    "however , since the two nn v@xmath11 ions in @xmath0-tevo@xmath1 lie in the same unit cell , i.e. , @xmath33 associates nnn spins , the experimentally determined @xmath33=0.423 must be scaled by 1/2 , which yields the nn pitch angle @xmath34=0.423@xmath35 and thus @xmath36@xmath371 . taking into the account the experimentally determined curie - weiss temperature @xmath13=2.7(1)k ( methods ) , which is even smaller than the ordering temperature @xmath15=4.65k , the competing @xmath3 and @xmath4 interactions must have different signs ( @xmath38@xmath37@xmath141 ) .",
    "in fact , to assure the competition @xmath3 must be ferromagnetic and @xmath4 must be antiferromagnetic .",
    "in contrast to the chain ( @xmath10 ) direction , the two neighbouring spins along the @xmath22 axis lie in the neighbouring unit cells .",
    "the experimentally derived @xmath39@xmath37@xmath40 thus yields a similar pitch angle along the @xmath22 axis , @xmath41@xmath37@xmath42 .",
    "the v@xmath14o interchain distance [ @xmath43@xmath442.81(5) , see methods ] is much larger than the typical v@xmath14o exchange leg in vanadates , @xmath372.0(1) @xcite , hence , the interchain exchange most likely proceeds via te@xmath11 ions , as frequently found in oxyhalide tellurites @xcite . in this respect ,",
    "two very similar interchain v@xmath14o@xmath14te@xmath14o@xmath14v exchange paths exist ( see methods ) , suggesting that the interchain interactions are also frustrated and that the exact relation between @xmath41 and @xmath34 is nontrivial .    *",
    "quantitative determination of the exchange interactions . * in order to place our system in the general zigzag spin - chain phase diagram ( fig.[pd]a ) @xcite , we still need to determine the magnitude of the exchange interactions .",
    "this can be determined from modeling of @xmath12 .",
    "we fit @xmath12 using the exact - diagonalization results for the isolated zigzag chain @xmath45 @xcite with an additional interchain exchange within a mean - field approach @xcite , @xmath46=@xmath47 . here",
    "@xmath48 , @xmath49 is the interchain coupling to @xmath50 spins on the neighbouring chains , @xmath51 is the avogadro constant , @xmath52 is the bohr magneton , and @xmath53=2.01(1 ) is the gyromagnetic factor for v@xmath11 ( see methods ) .",
    "an excellent agreement with the experiment is obtained for @xmath38=@xmath54 , with @xmath3=38.34k and @xmath55=4.46k ( fig.[bulk]a ) , which is in good agreement with the classical estimate @xmath38@xmath37@xmath141 derived from the experimentally determined @xmath33 .",
    "we note that the increased @xmath36 value is an expected effect of quantum fluctuations for spin-1/2 systems @xcite . on the other hand , fitting with @xmath38@xmath50 yields unrealistically large @xmath56@xmath5@xmath57 .",
    "moreover , the calculated curie - weiss temperature @xcite @xmath13=@xmath58 + 1)@xmath59= @xmath60[2(@xmath3+@xmath4)+@xmath55]=5.4k is in fair agreement with the experimental value @xmath13=2.7(1)k , considering an order of magnitude larger exchange interactions . finally , using @xmath62 @xcite for the same @xmath3 , @xmath4 and adding it to the lattice contribution @xmath63 within the debye model ( see methods )",
    ", we obtain an excellent fit of the specific heat data ( fig.[bulk]b ) , thus affirming the extracted exchange parameters .    [ ! ]    * determination of the magnetic phase diagram . * to explore all magnetic phases of @xmath0-tevo@xmath1 we performed detailed temperature- and magnetic - field - dependent neutron diffraction experiments , focusing on the strongest magnetic reflection ( fig.[nd ] ) . in zero field ,",
    "the reflection emerges at @xmath15=4.5(1)k at * k*=(@xmath64  0  0.413 ) and shifts to larger @xmath65 and @xmath66 with decreasing temperature . at @xmath16=3.1(1)k , the main * k * reflection",
    "is accompanied by an additional weak reflection appearing at * k*=(@xmath67  0  0.442 ) .",
    "on further cooling , this reflection shifts towards the main one and at @xmath17=2.20(3)k they finally collapse into a single peak at * k*=(@xmath27  0  0.423 ) .",
    "this peak does not shift with temperature at least down to 1.6k ( fig.[nd]c ) , indicating the stability of the magnetic ground state .",
    "very similar response is observed below @xmath17 when magnetic field is applied along the @xmath22 axis . above @xmath23 , the weak * k",
    "* reflection separates from the main * k * reflection and eventually disappears at @xmath2@xmath37@xmath26 ( fig.[nd]b ) .",
    "it thus appears that both external controlling parameters , i.e. , the temperature and the applied magnetic field , drive the system through the same magnetic phases .",
    "further details of the three magnetic phases are provided by zero - field spherical neutron polarimetry . in our study",
    "we focused on the strongest magnetic ( @xmath27  0  0.423 ) reflection ( see methods ) .",
    "in particular , we measured the full polarization matrix at 1.6k and then followed the temperature evolution of chiral @xmath68 and non - chiral @xmath69 terms ( table[tabsnp ] ) .",
    "measurements in the ( @xmath7000)/(00@xmath71 ) scattering plane reveal a significant chiral term below @xmath17 , indicating an imbalance in the chiral - domain population .",
    "above @xmath17 , on the contrary , the chiral term is almost completely suppressed , implying that chirality is either dramatically reduced or the plane of the spiral is reoriented along the scattering plane .",
    "this complies with the behavior of the non - chiral term , which above @xmath17 significantly increases , indicating a reorientation of the magnetic moments .",
    "measuring the same reflection in the ( @xmath7202@xmath70)/(0@xmath310 ) scattering plane allows probing a different projection of the magnetic structure factor .",
    "we find that the chiral term is now absent in the entire temperature range ( table[tabsnp ] ) , while the non - chiral term again increases above @xmath17 .",
    "we can thus conclude that ( i ) the plane of the spiral , existing below @xmath17 , is very close to the ( @xmath7202@xmath70)/(0@xmath310 ) scattering plane , ( ii ) at @xmath17 magnetic moments reorient and ( iii ) above @xmath17 magnetic order remains incommensurate , but is dominated by amplitude modulation ( sdw ) .

    "<S> motifs of periodic modulations are encountered in a variety of natural systems , where at least two rival states are present . in strongly correlated electron systems such behaviour has typically been associated with competition between short- and long - range interactions , e.g. , between exchange and dipole - dipole interactions in the case of ferromagnetic thin films . here </S>",
    "<S> we show that spin - stripe textures may develop also in antiferromagnets , where long - range dipole - dipole magnetic interactions are absent . a comprehensive analysis of magnetic susceptibility , high - field magnetization , specific heat , and neutron diffraction measurements unveils @xmath0-tevo@xmath1 as a nearly perfect realization of a frustrated ( zigzag ) ferromagnetic spin-1/2 chain . </S>",
    "<S> strikingly , a narrow spin stripe phase develops at elevated magnetic fields due to weak frustrated short - range interchain exchange interactions possibly assisted by the symmetry allowed electric polarization . </S>",
    "<S> this concept provides an alternative route for the stripe formation in strongly correlated electron systems and may help understanding other widespread , yet still elusive , stripe - related phenomena .    </S>",
    "<S> stripe patterns appear in remarkably diverse materials , ranging from biological to strongly - correlated electron systems @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the common driving force behind stripe formation is a natural tendency of a system to balance two or more rival phases that appear due to competing interactions . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , in ferromagnetic thin films spin - up and spin - down magnetic domains form stripe textures due to opposing short - range exchange and long - range dipole - dipole interactions @xcite . in antiferromagnets , however , there is no finite magnetization that could mediate long - range interactions between magnetic domains , so the stripe formation is not expected . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , stripe modulation may develop also due to the coupling between different order parameters that is mediated solely by short - range forces , as has been observed in some biological membrane systems @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> similar mechanism can be active also in antiferromagnets and may be relevant to other strongly correlated electron systems , e.g. , to high - temperature superconductors , where the competition between charge - stripe ordering @xcite and superconductivity has become increasingly apparent @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , any evidence of stripe formation in the absence of long - range interactions in strongly correlated electron systems is of utmost importance .    [ ! ]    a convenient system to search for this intriguing phenomenon is a frustrated ( zigzag ) quantum spin-1/2 chain , because of its extremely rich phase diagram . </S>",
    "<S> most importantly , the energy difference between collinear and spiral spin states can be accurately tuned by the applied magnetic field , @xmath2 , @xcite . in particular , </S>",
    "<S> when the nearest - neighbour ( nn ) interaction ( @xmath3 ) is ferromagnetic and the next - nearest - neighbour ( nnn ) one is antiferromagnetic ( @xmath4@xmath50 ) , i.e. , in the case of a frustrated ferromagnetic zigzag chain , a vector - chiral ( vc ) ground state is at elevated magnetic fields succeeded by collinear spin - density - wave ( sdw ) phases @xcite , with two- ( @xmath6=2 ) or three - magnon ( @xmath6=3 ) bound states ( fig.[pd]a ) . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , when magnetization @xmath7 approaches saturation ( @xmath8=1 ) , intriguing multipolar orders develop @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although several coper - oxide @xcite and vanadate @xcite compounds possess the `` zigzag '' chain topology , high saturation fields , anisotropy effects , or sizable interchain interactions hamper experimental investigation in most cases .    here </S>",
    "<S> we highlight @xmath0-tevo@xmath1 where chains of distorted corner - sharing vo@xmath9 pyramids run along the @xmath10 axis @xcite . so far , this compound has been treated as a simple v@xmath11 spin-1/2 chain system with only nn antiferromagentic interaction [ @xmath3=21.4(2)k ] @xcite , as the maximum in the magnetic susceptibility , @xmath12 , at 14k can be described by the bonner - fischer model @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , high - temperature susceptibility yields a very small positive ( ferromagnetic ) curie - weiss temperature @xmath13 , varying from 1.6 to 4.4k , depending on the magnetic field orientation @xcite , which implies the importance of both the nn v@xmath14o@xmath14v and the nnn v@xmath14o@xmath14te@xmath14o@xmath14v exchange interactions ( fig.[pd]b ) and their opposite sign . </S>",
    "<S> finally , three subsequent magnetic transitions were reported at @xmath15=4.65k , @xmath16=3.28k , and @xmath17=2.28k @xcite , signifying several energetically almost equivalent magnetic states  a signature of competing magnetic interactions and strong frustration .    in this work we present magnetic susceptibility , magnetization , specific heat , neutron diffraction , and spherical neutron polarimetry measurements , which reveal that competing ferromagnetic nn and antiferromagnetic nnn interactions in @xmath0-tevo@xmath1 are comparable in magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> the derived magnetic phase diagram corroborates main features of the theoretical one ( fig.[pd ] ) , thus making @xmath0-tevo@xmath1 a nearly ideal realization of the frustrated ferromagnetic spin-1/2 chain model , where quadrupolar / spin - nematic phase is predicted already at 18.7 t . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , a striking new stripe phase has been discovered between the theoretically - predicted vc and sdw phases . in the corresponding magnetic field range </S>",
    "<S> , the strength of the interchain interaction matches the energy difference between these two parent phases and thus allows for the establishment of the nanoscale modulation of the magnetic order even in the absence of sizable long - range dipole - dipole magnetic interactions . </S>",
    "<S> possible electric polarization that is in the vc state allowed by symmetry may further assist the stripe formation . </S>",
    "<S> this makes @xmath0-tevo@xmath1 an intriguing manifestation of the spin - stripe modulation in an antiferromagnet , where stripe formation appears to be driven by the coupling between order parameters , a mechanism so far almost exclusively attributed to biological systems . </S>"
