    "over the past years , the study of synchronization and consensus of multiple interconnected systems has received considerable attention from both the control and physics communities , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this interest has been primarily motivated by the many potential applications of synchronization and consensus , which span from rendezvous @xcite to distributed optimization @xcite , @xcite , power networks @xcite and biochemical systems analysis / control @xcite .    over the past few years",
    ", several sufficient conditions have been devised ensuring , under different technical assumptions and using different approaches , synchronization / consensus of complex networks .",
    "examples of such approaches include passivity - based techniques @xcite , input - output stability @xcite , lyapunov techniques @xcite , convergent systems @xcite , incremental stability , @xcite , contraction theory @xcite and the master stability function(mainly used within the physics community ) @xcite .",
    "an assumption that is often made in literature is that the network of interest is _ noise - free_. this assumption is not realistic for most real world applications of synchronization and consensus , where noise plays a key role in destroying or generating those coordinated behaviors . a class of networks where noise can not be neglected is the one where the network nodes _ interact _ with the environment .",
    "such networks are relevant to many applications in nature and technology , with examples ranging from synchronization of biochemical reactions to coordination of smart devices connected over the internet of things ( iot ) .",
    "this paper is concerned with the study of synchronization and consensus in networks where nodes interact with the external environment .",
    "this interaction results in a perturbation of the nodes intrinsic dynamics by some external ( white ) _",
    "noise_. specifically , we will consider networks where nodes dynamics are nonlinear and where the diffusion of noise depends on the nodes state . by using stochastic lyapunov techniques @xcite ,",
    "we present a sufficient condition ensuring that the network synchronizes ( or achieves consensus ) in the presence of the external noise .",
    "we will also show that our condition , which links together network topology , coupling strength , node and diffusion dynamics , has to two interesting interpretations .",
    "first , as expected , the condition implies that in order for the network to achieve synchronization / consensus , the nodes need to be _ strongly connected _ together so as to overcome a _ threshold _ generated by noise . on the other hand ,",
    "our result also offers a perhaps counter - intuitive interpretation as it shows that , under certain assumptions , noise drives the network to achieve synchronization and consensus . in turn",
    ", this implies that , if properly _ designed _ , noise can be turned into a _ distributed control input _ to induce synchronization / consensus .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we start with introducing the notation and mathematical preliminaries in section [ sec : math_prel ] .",
    "then , in section [ sec : probl_stat ] , we formalize the problem statement while , in section [ sec : net_synch ] , we provide a sufficient condition for network synchronization / consensus . finally , in section [ sec : applications",
    "] , we apply our result to study collective decision processes .",
    "the problem of analyzing / controlling synchronization and consensus in continuous - time networks affected by noise is attracting many researchers .",
    "for example , recently , in @xcite , the consensus problem has been studied for a network of integrators when the information exchanged between nodes is corrupted by some white noise .",
    "also , in @xcite , a similar model ( i.e. the so - called drift - diffusion model , _ ddm _ ) is used to study the dynamics of collective decision processes . in order to devise their results , in such papers",
    "it is assumed that the noise affecting each node is additive with constant diffusion rate and that the dynamics at the network nodes are linear @xmath0-dimensional systems or integrators .",
    "recently , the assumptions on the nodes dynamics have been relaxed in @xcite .",
    "specifically , in this paper , an approach to study synchronization in networks of nonlinear nodes subject to additive noise has been presented .",
    "however , in order to obtain their results , the authors recast the synchronization problem as a stochastic optimization problem and then apply numerical methods to solve it .",
    "interestingly , a large body of literature is emerging which is devoted to study network dynamics when the external disturbance acting on the nodes is not a white noise but it is rather the output of some exogenous system , see e.g. @xcite and @xcite . in this case , as shown in e.g. @xcite ( see also references therein ) , nonlinear nodes dynamics can be considered , with the external disturbance affecting the dynamics via some possibly nonlinear function .",
    "in this paper , we will denote with @xmath1 the @xmath2 identity matrix and with @xmath3 the @xmath4 matrix having all of its elements equal to @xmath0 .",
    "the vector / matrix frobenius norm will be denoted with @xmath5 and the vector / matrix euclidean norm will be denoted with @xmath6 .",
    "the trace of a square matrix , say @xmath7 , will be denoted with @xmath8 .",
    "finally , we will denote by @xmath9 the @xmath10-dimensional subspace spanned by the vector @xmath11 .",
    "consider an @xmath10-dimensional stochastic differential equation of the form @xmath12 where : ( i ) @xmath13 is the state variable ; ( ii ) @xmath14 belongs to @xmath15 ; ( iii ) @xmath16 belongs to @xmath17 ;",
    "( iv ) @xmath18^t$ ] is a @xmath19-dimensional brownian motion . throughout this paper",
    "we will assume that both @xmath20 and @xmath21 obey the local lipschitz condition and the linear growth condition , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "this implies that for any given initial condition @xmath22 , @xmath23 , equation ( [ eqn : ito_gen ] ) has a unique global solution .",
    "we will also assume that @xmath24 and the solution @xmath25 will be said the _ trivial solution _ of ( [ eqn : ito_gen ] ) .",
    "following @xcite , @xcite , we say that a sequence of stochastic variables , @xmath26 converges almost surely ( a.s . ) to the stochastic variable @xmath27 if @xmath28 that is , the sequence converges to @xmath27 with probability @xmath0 .",
    "we are now ready to give the following definition which characterizes stability of the trivial solution , see @xcite .    the trivial solution of ( [ eqn : ito_gen ] )",
    "is said to be almost surely exponentially stable if for all @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 .",
    "let @xmath32 , @xmath33 , i.e. @xmath34 is twice differentiable with respect to @xmath35 and differentiable with respect to @xmath36 . by the ito formula",
    "we have : @xmath37 where : ( i ) @xmath38;(ii ) @xmath39 $ ] ; ( iii ) @xmath40 is the @xmath2 dimensional matrix having as element @xmath41 @xmath42 ( where @xmath43 and @xmath44 ) . in the rest of the paper we assume that the diffusion function @xmath45 is linear in @xmath35 . the following result from @xcite",
    "provides a sufficient condition for the trivial solution of ( [ eqn : ito_gen ] ) to be almost surely exponentially stable .",
    "[ thm : stability_ito ] assume that there exists a non - negative function @xmath33 and constants @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , such that @xmath50 and @xmath51 : ( * h1 * ) @xmath52 ; ( * h2 * ) @xmath53 ; ( * h3 * ) @xmath54 .",
    "then : @xmath55 , @xmath31 . in particular ,",
    "if @xmath56 , then the trivial solution of ( [ eqn : ito_gen ] ) is almost surely exponentially stable .      throughout this paper , we will consider systems interacting over some graph , @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the set of vertices ( or nodes in what follows ) and @xmath59 is the set of edges .",
    "we assume all the graphs in this paper are undirected and denote the edge between node @xmath60 and node @xmath61 as @xmath62 .",
    "we will denote with @xmath63 the set of neighbors of node @xmath60 , i.e. @xmath64 . let @xmath65 be the number of nodes in the network .",
    "then ( see e.g. @xcite ) the laplacian matrix associated to the graph , @xmath66 , is the @xmath67 symmetric matrix defined as @xmath68 , where : ( i ) @xmath7 is the adjacency matrix of @xmath69 ; ( ii ) @xmath70 is the graph degree matrix .",
    "the following lemma from @xcite will be used in this paper .",
    "[ lem : laplacian ] denote with @xmath66 the laplacian matrix of an undirected network .",

    "throughout this paper , we will consider stochastic networks described by the following stochastic differential equation : @xmath74dt + g(t , x_i)db , \\ \\ \\",

    "the goal of this paper is to address the so - called _",
    "synchronization problem_. this is formalized with the following definition .",
    "let @xmath84 .",
    "we will say that network ( [ eqn : network ] ) achieves stochastic synchronization if @xmath85    that is , stochastic synchronization essentially means that all the network nodes converge towards a synchronous solution that _ averages _ the noise diffusion within the network .",
    "also , note that in the case where nodes dynamics are integrator dynamics , then the definition of stochastic synchronization simply becomes a definition for consensus .",
    "equations similar to ( [ eqn : network ] ) naturally arise when modeling networked systems from iot and biochemical applications .",
    "for example , as outlined in figure [ fig : model ] ( top panel ) , iot applications are typically deployed by interconnecting a number of _ smart _ devices .",
    "each device of the networked system consists of some intrinsic _ agent _ dynamics , which is controlled by a local control algorithm .",
    "typically , the control algorithm also takes information / data from the external environment and this leads the controller to be affected by an environmental noise .",
    "this is the case of many complex cyber - physical systems , @xcite , with applications ranging from the coordination of team of quadricopters , @xcite , to supervisory human control , @xcite and decision - making processes , @xcite .",
    "another important instance where equations similar to ( [ eqn : network ] ) arise is when the agents of a networked system are made up by a number of compartments ( see the bottom panel of figure [ fig : model ] ) , with one of the compartments being affected by an external noise .",
    "these _ compartmental _ models are widely used in pharmacology and many other biochemical applications . for examples , for a biochemical network , each of the compartments might be a subset of biochemical reactions or even macro - systems , like an organ or blood , @xcite .",
    "the two classes of networked systems described above can be recast into equations of the form ( [ eqn : network ] ) .",
    "specifically , the function @xmath86 would model the noise free component of the @xmath60-th agent in a networked system ( i.e. the dynamics of a device or the noise - free compartment ofa compartmental system ) , while the function @xmath87 would model the sub - components of the nodes dynamics which are affected by the external noise ( i.e. the @xmath60-th local controller taking inputs from the external world or a compartment of a compartmental system which is affected by environmental noise ) .",
    "let @xmath88 . the following result provides a sufficient condition ensuring stochastic synchronization of network ( [ eqn : network ] ) .",
    "[ thm : network_nodes ] assume that the following conditions hold for network ( [ eqn : network ] ) :    1 .",

    "@xmath97 .    then , ( [ eqn : network ] ) achieves stochastic synchronization .",
    "let @xmath98 .",
    "we have @xmath99 and therefore : @xmath100 since by assumptions the function @xmath45 is linear in @xmath35 , we have that : @xmath101 thus , in compact form : @xmath102 from ( [ eqn : network ] ) and ( [ eqn : sync_sol ] ) we can then get the stochastic differential equation for @xmath103 .",
    "namely : @xmath104dt + \\left[\\tilde g(t , e)\\right]db,\\ ] ] where :    * @xmath105 ; * @xmath106 .",

    "now , hypothesis @xmath132 of theorem [ thm : network_nodes ] can be characterized in therms of the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath145 .",
    "specifically , let @xmath151 and @xmath152 be the largest ( time - varying ) eigenvalue of @xmath149 and @xmath145 , respectively . then : @xmath153 where the last inequality follows from the fact that @xmath149 is a block diagonal matrix .",
    "therefore , we have that @xmath154 ; * while hypothesis @xmath138 allows the noise to be _",
    "persistent_. again , such a condition can be expressed in terms of the eigenvalues of @xmath145 .",
    "specifically , it can be shown that in this case @xmath155 , where @xmath156 is the smaller eigenvalue of @xmath145 ; * finally , hypothesis @xmath140 links together the algebraic connectivity of the network graph and coupling strength between nodes .",
    "specifically , such a condition implies that synchronization is attained if @xmath157 . the threshold @xmath158 depends on the dynamics of the node on noise .",
    "interestingly , this hypothesis is implying that noise can potentially be helpful for synchronization . specifically , if @xmath159 , then the effect of noise is that of lowering @xmath158 , thus helping synchronization rather than being disruptive .",
    "we will build upon this idea in section [ sec : applications ] , where we will show that a common opinion among a set of agent can be forced by _ inducing _ a noise of sufficiently high intensity within the network .",
    "the problem we consider in this section is that of understanding whether a population of interconnected agents which are affected by some external disturbance is able to achieve a common decision .",
    "recently , this problem has become particularly relevant in iot applications when , based on the local collection of data ( observations ) , a group of diffusively coupled objects , with possibly differing likelihoods , is in charge of detecting the occurrence of a given event among two alternatives .",
    "this networked system can be modeled with the following differential equation : @xmath160 and finding conditions for the onset of a collective decision is equivalent to devising synchronization conditions for the network above .",
    "in such a network , the intrinsic dynamics of the nodes is a bistable system ( i.e. @xmath161 ) and nodes are diffusively coupled . in the equation above , the intrinsic dynamics of the nodes is perturbed by some external white noise , @xmath162 and , in particular , the term @xmath163 can be decomposed as @xmath164 .",
    "that is , @xmath163 consists of a noise - free component , @xmath165 , and of a term which is affected by noise and hence acts as a perturbation on the node dynamics",
    ". the equation above can be therefore recast as the following stochastic differential equation : @xmath166dt + \\left[\\sigma_n x_i\\right]db.\\ ] ]    equations similar to ( [ eqn : dec_making ] ) also arise in the context of the study of human performance in a two alternative decision making process .",
    "specifically , the formation process of an individual can be modeled by the _ drift diffusion model _ ( ddm ) , see e.g. @xcite , @xcite and references therein : @xmath167 , where @xmath168 is the drift rate , @xmath169 is the diffusion rate and @xmath170 is the opinion at time @xmath36 .",
    "recently , in the remarkable work @xcite the ddm has been extended to study collective decisions . in order to do so , the authors used the coupled version of the ddm : @xmath171dt + \\sigma_b db_i $ ] , where : ( i ) @xmath172 is the aggregate evidence of the @xmath60-th agent in the network ; ( ii ) @xmath173 models the ( external ) noise affecting the data collected by @xmath60-th agent ; ( iii ) @xmath174 models the strength of noise diffusion on each network node .",
    "we will now use theorem [ thm : network_nodes ] to study the effects of noise on the capability of network ( [ eqn : dec_making ] ) to achieve a common decision . the first step to apply theorem [ thm : network_nodes ] is to compute the parameters @xmath89 , @xmath93 and @xmath95 .",

    "analogously , in order to compute @xmath95 it suffices to note that @xmath183 and therefore @xmath184 .",
