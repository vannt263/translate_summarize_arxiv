    "binary mixtures of bose - einstein condensates are of great interest due to their complex dynamical features and their role in the emergence of macroscopic quantum phenomena .",
    "mixtures are usually made up of two species , that can also be hyperfine states of the same alkali atom @xcite .",
    "they generally display repulsive self - interaction and are confined by different potentials .",
    "depending on the inter - species interaction , two classes of stable configurations are possible : mixed and separated .",
    "the latter are more interesting , since they allow the observation of phenomena such as symmetry breaking , e.g.  in harmonic potentials , and macroscopic quantum tunnelling @xcite .",
    "binary mixtures in harmonic traps have been investigated in a number of interesting experiments @xcite .",
    "different approaches are possible in order to study the ground state of these systems .",
    "the binary mixture of two species of bosons can be rigorously described in a second - quantization formalism @xcite . however ,",
    "if the number of particles in the condensate is very large compared to the number of particles in the excited states , the fields associated to the two species can be treated as classical wave functions .",
    "this approach leads to the gross - pitaevskij equations @xcite , that are obtained by minimizing the zero - temperature grand - canonical energy of the system .",
    "the ground state of the system can be thus determined by solving the gross - pitaevskij equation @xcite , or equivalently by analytically or numerically minimizing the grand - canonical energy functional @xcite .",
    "analytical results are obtained only in particular cases , such as confinement by a hard wall trap @xcite , harmonic or lattice potentials @xcite and axisymmetric traps @xcite .",
    "a simplified approach is often used , based on the thomas - fermi ( tf ) approximation , that consists in neglecting the kinetic energy with respect to the self- and inter - species interaction energies @xcite .",
    "this reduces the problem of finding the ground state of the binary mixture of condensates to a classical problem , related to the stability of a system of two interacting fluids .    in this article",
    "we shall investigate this problem by adopting the following approach : given a system of two interacting condensates , confined in a generic external potential ( that can be different for the two species ) , we will find _ general _ tools to determine the ground state of such system in the tf approximation .",
    "the article has the following structure . in we set up the problem and introduce notation . in",
    "we find a threshold value of the inter - species interaction parameter , above which mixed configurations can not be the ground state of the system . in",
    "we establish those conditions that determine which one of the possible separated configurations is the ground state .",
    "we conclude with an outlook in . throughout this article ,",
    "both cases of i ) fixed numbers of particles and ii ) fixed chemical potentials will be considered .",
    "we consider a system made up of two species of indistinguishable particles , labelled 1 and 2 , confined by generally different external potentials @xmath0 and @xmath1 . self interaction and inter - species interaction",
    "are assumed to be repulsive .",
    "an example of such a system is a mixture of alkali atoms in two different hyperfine states @xcite .",
    "the two subsystems are described in a quantum field theoretical framework , by associating to each species the field operators @xmath2 and @xmath3 . however , since we are searching for the zero - temperature ground state , we assume that all particles condense in the same wave function , and thus apply a bogolubov shift @xcite and treat @xmath4 and @xmath5 as classical fields , normalized to the average numbers of particles @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the grand - canonical energy functional is @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 is the dimension of the system . by requiring that the energy is stationary , one obtains the coupled gross - pitaevskij ( gp ) equations @xmath11 in the above equations @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the self - interaction parameters between atoms of the same species , while @xmath14 is associated to inter - species interaction .",
    "each of these parameters is assumed to be positive , since we are considering repulsive interactions .",
    "the solutions of - depend on the value of the chemical potentials @xmath15 and @xmath16 , which are lagrange multipliers .",
    "if @xmath15 and @xmath16 are fixed , the average particle numbers are free to vary . if , on the other hand , the particle numbers @xmath6 and @xmath7 are fixed , the chemical potentials are chosen in such a way that the wave functions satisfy the normalization constraints @xmath17 , for @xmath18 .    for the sake of simplicity",
    ", our analysis will be focused on one - dimensional systems , with the main results generalizable to higher dimensions .",
    "moreover , it will be assumed that the potentials be continuously differentiable , @xmath19 .",
    "this class of potentials schematizes very well those used in trapping cold atoms .",
    "the thomas - fermi ( tf ) approximation , which will be applied in the following , consists in neglecting the kinetic energy contribution @xmath20 to the energy functional .",
    "this approximation is justified if the number of particles is sufficiently high , since the self - energetic parts in eq .",
    "are respectively @xmath21 and @xmath22 , while the kinetic energy is @xmath23 @xcite . as a consequence of the tf approximation",
    ", the grand - canonical energy becomes dependent only on the densities @xmath24 and @xmath25 , and will be indicated in the following as @xmath26 .",
    "notice that , without loss of generality , one can reduce the analysis to the particular case @xmath27 . indeed , by the scaling @xmath28 one gets @xmath29 with @xmath30 and @xmath31 incidentally , notice that the above reduction to a single parameter @xmath32 applies also to the full energy functional ( [ engcpsi ] ) , by scaling also the masses @xmath33 .",
    "the critical points of the thomas - fermi grand - canonical energy functional are the solutions to the algebraic equations , @xmath34 and will be called the tf density profiles . moreover , for fixed particle numbers @xmath35 , they are supplemented by the normalization conditions @xmath36 which fix the values of the chemical potentials @xmath37 .    in the following the supports of the tf densities @xmath38 will be denoted by @xmath39 . by assuming that @xmath40 , in @xmath41 , where both condensates are present , the tf density profiles are @xmath42    in the regions @xmath43 and @xmath44 , occupied by only one of the two species , the solutions are respectively @xmath45 and @xmath46 the tf density profiles  are defined independently of the dimensionality of the system .",
    "notice that the tf equations uniquely determine the functional dependence of the densities at a point @xmath47 on the external potentials at the same point , the chemical potentials and the interaction parameters , _ once _ the supports @xmath48 and @xmath49 are given .",
    "on the other hand large freedom is left in the choice of the supports of the density profiles , for which uniqueness fails .",
    "thus , extremely irregular configurations can be solutions of the tf equations . among all possible solutions",
    ", one should pick up the minimizers .",
    "the rest of this paper will be devoted to deriving general rules for finding the minimizing configuration of the supports , in order to determine the ground state of the system , both if the numbers of particles or the chemical potentials are fixed .",
    "the configurations of the binary mixture can be divided in two fundamental parts : separated and mixed .",
    "the tf densities are _ mixed _ in @xmath41 , where both species are present , and are _ separated _ in @xmath50 , where only one species is present at one time .",
    "a configuration is said to be separated if it does not contain mixed parts , and mixed otherwise . in this section",
    "we will show that @xmath51 plays the role of a threshold value , above which separated configurations become energetically favored , both in the case of i ) fixed numbers of particles and ii ) fixed chemical potentials .",
    "this threshold holds independently of the particular external potentials @xmath52 .",
    "we proceed by treating separately cases i ) and ii ) .",
    "we will first prove that under the assumption that the @xmath53 potentials are confining , that is @xmath54 with @xmath18 , all tf density profiles are compactly supported .",
    "we will see that this is a straight consequence of the positivity of the densities @xmath55 we will prove that the supports @xmath39 are bounded , by separately considering the sets with separated phases , @xmath43 and @xmath44 , and that with mixed phases , @xmath56 . by requiring that the solutions ( [ tfa1 ] ) and ( [ tfa2 ] ) be nonnegative we get @xmath57 , \\nonumber\\\\ s_{22}\\subset\\{x\\in\\mathbb{r } \\,|\\ , v_2(x)\\leq \\mu_2 \\ } = v_2^{-1}(-\\infty,\\mu_2 ] , \\label{eq : musep}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which are bounded by hypothesis . on the other hand , from ( [ tfamix1 ] )",
    "we get that every point @xmath58 satisfies the conditions @xmath59 they are easily proved to be equivalent to @xmath60 which in turn imply that @xmath61 \\cap v_2^{-1}(-\\infty,\\mu_2 ] , \\label{eq : mumix}\\ ] ] so that @xmath62 is compact . as a consequence @xmath63 and @xmath64 are compact .",
    "if the numbers of particles @xmath6 and @xmath7 are kept fixed , the chemical potentials are functionally dependent on the density profiles , since they have to be tuned in order to preserve the normalization conditions  ( [ eq : normcond ] ) .",
    "the search for the zero - temperature ground state of the system reduces to the minimization of the tf grand - canonical energy functional  ( [ eq : tfenergy ] ) , that evaluated at the tf solutions reduces to the internal energy functional  ( [ eq : intenergy ] ) .",
    "a simple lemma will be now introduced ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "consider a binary mixture confined in an infinite square well , corresponding to a bounded interval @xmath65 $ ] ( with @xmath66 ) of the real axis .",
    "let @xmath67 be the ( finite ) length of the well .",
    "since in this case @xmath68 and the tf density profiles are flat , @xmath69 , the internal energy of the completely mixed configuration in @xmath70 is @xmath71 on the other hand , a separated configuration with @xmath6 particles of the first species in a subset @xmath72 and @xmath7 particles of the second in @xmath73 has densities @xmath74 and internal energy @xmath75 which is in fact a function of the length @xmath76 .",
    "the minimum of @xmath77 is attained for supports @xmath78 and @xmath79 such that @xmath80 condition can be also expressed in terms of the densities in the separated configuration : @xmath81 since the value of the internal energy at is @xmath82 the minimizing separated configurations are energetically favorite if @xmath83 , while the mixed configurations are less energetic than all separated configurations if @xmath84 . for a binary mixture in a square well ,",
    "this proves the role of eq .   as a threshold value .",
    "notice that the minimizers ( [ densratio ] ) have a very high degeneracy , since every sets @xmath78 whose measures satisfy ( [ partvol ] ) correspond to possible tf configurations . among them , despite the regularity of the potentials , there are extremely irregular configurations with highly entangled supports and infinitely many points of discontinuity ( _ domain walls _ ) .",
    "however , such a phenomenon is a consequence of the tf approximation that , by neglecting the kinetic energy part @xmath20 in ( [ engcpsi ] ) , is also deprived of its regularizing effect on the densities .",
    "the kinetic term favors smooth density profiles .",
    "indeed , due to the presence of the kinetic energy , the grand - canonical energy functional ( [ engcpsi ] ) is defined on functions with square integrable ( distribution ) derivatives , and tf solutions are approximations thereof . in particular , in the 1-dimensional situation , a domain wall is a discontinuous approximation of a ( absolutely ) continuous function that changes between two values in a very short transition region with a large derivative .",
    "thus , each domain wall of the tf solution would correspond to an additional cost , in terms of kinetic energy of the true solution , and the above - mentioned degeneracy would be lifted : among the tf degenerate minimizers , @xmath20 would select those one(s ) with the minimum number of domain walls . in the following",
    "we will make use of this _ selection principle _ and , in particular , we will only consider densities in the class of piecewise differentiable functions , @xmath85 .",
    "that means that there is a finite subdivision of @xmath39 such that the restriction of @xmath38 to each subinterval @xmath86 $ ] is continuously differentiable .",
    "incidentally , notice that the potentials themselves can be assumed to be piecewise differentiable , without modifying our results .",
    "going back to the square - well case , by the selection principle , for @xmath87 , we end up with only two degenerate minimizers : one with @xmath88 $ ] , where @xmath89 , and the other with @xmath90 $ ] , where @xmath91 .",
    "both configurations are separated and have a single domain wall .",
    "we now extend the above result to the case in which the mixture is not confined in a square well , but rather by generic continuously differentiable confining potentials @xmath52 with @xmath18 .",
    "we will prove that , if @xmath83 , the ground state of the system can not be a mixed configuration , and thus we can restrict our attention to the separated ones .",
    "let the tf densities have a mixed configuration in @xmath92 , given by eq .",
    "( [ tfamix1 ] ) . since the densities @xmath38 are assumed to be piecewise continuously differentiable , and their supports are compact",
    ", @xmath62 is the union of a finite number of compact intervals in which the @xmath38 are @xmath93 .",
    "choose a segment @xmath94 $ ] of length @xmath95 included in some of those intervals .",
    "the interval @xmath96 contains @xmath97 particles , where @xmath98 denotes the average on @xmath96 .",
    "since the potentials are @xmath93 , we can express them in @xmath96 as @xmath99 for some @xmath100 .",
    "since the @xmath38 are continuous in @xmath96 , two points @xmath101 exist in this segment , in which the functions equal their averages : @xmath102 moreover , since the density functions are continuously differentiable in @xmath103 $ ] , taking into account we can express them in each point of the segment as @xmath104 for some @xmath105 . the first derivatives appearing in - are all bounded in @xmath96 .",

    "since @xmath62 is compact , we can find a finite subdivision @xmath119\\cup \\dots \\cup [ x_{n-1},x_{n}]$ ] , such that the above construction can be performed in each segment @xmath120 $ ] .",
    "thus , the minimizers are separated configurations , if the particle numbers are fixed .",
    "analogously , one can show that if @xmath84 the internal energy of a separated configuration is always larger than the energy of a mixed configuration with the same particle numbers .",
    "thus , even in the case of varying external potentials the value acts as a threshold between mixed and separated ground states .",
    "if the chemical potentials @xmath15 and @xmath16 are fixed , the average particle numbers are free to vary . in order to find the ground state of the system",
    ", one has to find the minimizers of the grand - canonical energy @xmath26 . as in the case of fixed particle numbers , the elementary case of a binary mixture in an infinite square well will be analyzed first .",
    "then , we will try and find general results in the case of different piecewise continuously differentiable confining potentials .",
    "it is clear from  that fixing the chemical potentials corresponds to fixing the density functions , with the choice of the supports leading to different numbers of particles .",
    "we will neglect an inessential annoying constant in  ( [ eq : tfenergy ] ) by setting @xmath121 .    in the simple case of an infinite square well @xmath70 with @xmath122 inside the well ,",
    "the only values of the chemical potentials that have physical meaning are the positive ones , as it emerges from ( [ eq : musep ] ) and ( [ eq : mumix ] ) .",
    "let us first consider a completely mixed configuration in the well with density profiles @xmath123 such a configuration has a physical meaning if both densities are non negative .",

    "the boundaries coincide , and the densities are well defined for all @xmath32 .",
    "note that condition exactly corresponds to the minimum condition of the internal energy in the separated phase , since , by taking into account - , it implies @xmath127 if the solutions are plugged in the definition of the grand canonical energy , it is possible to express it in terms of interaction parameters and chemical potentials @xmath128 .\\ ] ] if instead separated solutions are considered , with the first condensate confined in a region @xmath48 and the second in @xmath73 , the grand - canonical energy is a function of the length @xmath76 and reads @xmath129 since is linear in the length @xmath76 , it is clear that its minimum value is @xmath130 hence , if @xmath131 , the minimum of the grand - canonical energy for separated configurations corresponds to @xmath132 , while if @xmath133 , it corresponds to @xmath134 . in both cases ,",
    "the minimizer is in fact a _ single condensate _ configuration .",
    "only if holds , separated configurations are allowed . moreover , their energy is stationary with respect to changes in the partition of @xmath70 .",
    "the energy in the mixed configuration and that in the minimizing separated configuration will be now compared in detail , as @xmath32 varies from zero to infinity , in the cases @xmath135 and @xmath136 , since if @xmath133 the physical situation is specular with respect to the first case .",
    "we remark that the energy of each separated configuration is always independent of @xmath32 .    in the case",
    "@xmath131 , if the inter - species interaction is absent , @xmath137 , the mixed configuration is favorite , since its energy @xmath138 reads @xmath139 if @xmath32 increases , the energy of the mixed configuration grows , until it reaches a local maximum at @xmath140 , which marks the beginning of the nonphysical region . at this point",
    "the density of the second species vanishes , and thus the energies of the mixed and separated configurations are equal : they are in fact both single - condensate configurations , whose energy is @xmath141 for @xmath142 , the separated ones ( not only the minimizing one ) are the only configurations that have a physical meaning . if @xmath143 , the mixed configurations become physical again , but their energy @xmath144 is higher than that of the single - condensate configuration @xmath145 the single - condensate configuration remains energetically favored for @xmath146 , since its energy is constant , while the energy of the mixed configuration ( [ engcm ] ) vanishes as @xmath147 .",
    "we now consider the case @xmath136 . it was observed that this is the only case in which real separated states minimize the grand - canonical energy @xmath148 , and thus it is possible for such configurations to be the ground state of the system .",
    "moreover , we stressed that if condition holds , there is no nonphysical region for the mixed configurations , as @xmath32 varies from zero to infinity . by plugging condition in , we find that the grand - canonical energy in this case is never singular , and reads @xmath149 if is compared with ( [ engcs ] ) , that for @xmath150 reads @xmath151 and is independent of the partition , mixed configurations are found to be favorite if @xmath84 , while separated configurations have smaller energy if @xmath117 .",
    "thus , even in the case of fixed chemical potentials and infinite square well external potential , the value proves to be the discriminant value between mixed and separated ground states .",
    "consider tf density profiles @xmath152 .",
    "in @xmath43 we get ( with the convention @xmath121 ) @xmath153 and in @xmath44 @xmath154 therefore @xmath155 with @xmath156 in @xmath41 we get @xmath157 compare a mixed tf configuration in a set @xmath70 with a configuration with only one species , say @xmath158 , @xmath159 thus , when @xmath117 one gets @xmath160 and separated configurations are energetically favorite",
    ". therefore , in this condition , we have to search for the ground state among the separated configurations , which is the aim of the next section .      from the results obtained in this section",

    "[ sec : selprinc ] , the following analysis will be restricted to piecewise continuously differentiable solutions of the tf equations , @xmath163 , whose discontinuities can be due to the presence of a finite number of interfaces .",

    "we will now find a way to determine which of these configurations is the ground state of the system , and which can be regarded to be locally stable or unstable .",
    "we shall again discuss separately the cases of fixed numbers of particles and fixed chemical potentials , underlining analogies and differences between them .",
    "when only piecewise continuously differentiable density profiles are considered , a separated configuration can be characterized by the property that the supports @xmath48 and @xmath49 do not intersect , except at a finite set of points .",
    "the intersection points correspond to a set of domain walls separating the first and the second species . @xmath48 and @xmath49 ,",

    ", one gets @xmath180 the stationarity condition is obtained by setting to zero the derivatives with respect to all the positions of the @xmath169 domain walls , yielding @xmath181 these are clearly analogous to the minimum conditions in the case of an infinite potential well . if the densities in are expressed as functions of the external potentials and the chemical potentials , it becomes clear that the position of the domain walls in a stationary configuration are characterized by the fact that the potential @xmath182 is equal for all @xmath179 : @xmath183 let us consider the equation @xmath184 with @xmath185 a constant .",
    "the number of its solutions fixes the maximal number of walls in a stationary configuration .",
    "it is particularly interesting the case in which the external potentials for the two species are proportional , @xmath186 with @xmath187 .",
    "this happens , e.g.  when the two condensates feel the same potential before the scaling  ( [ eq : scaling ] ) , and in such a situation @xmath188 in the case of proportional potentials ( [ propv ] ) , if the equation @xmath189 , with @xmath190 a constant , has @xmath169 solutions , there can not exist stationary configurations with more than @xmath169 domain walls . in this case , the domain walls are placed at positions characterized by the same potential , which must be equal to @xmath191 as a consequence , the densities of the same species must be equal at the edge of each domain wall .",
    "the values of the densities at the edge of all domain walls in the case of proportional potentials will be indicated as @xmath192 .",
    "henceforth , we shall call _ maximal stationary configurations _ those ones in which a domain wall is placed in each of the real solutions of , except for the case in which one of the solutions is a stationary point for @xmath193 .",
    "two different examples of such configurations are shown in .        in the following",
    ", it will be shown that for @xmath194 the ground state of the system is usually in a maximal configuration .    in order to determine",
    "if the stationary configurations are in fact minima of , the hessian matrix @xmath195 at the stationary solution has to be computed . by deriving",
    "once more with respect to @xmath179 , we find that @xmath196 has two contributions : the first one is related to the dependence of the external potentials on the point @xmath179 , the second one to the dependence of the chemical potentials on the position of the domain walls @xmath172 . on the other hand , if is derived with respect to @xmath197 with @xmath198 , only the second one of the above mentioned contributions survives . by taking into account conditions ,",
    "the diagonal elements of the hessian matrix in the stationary configurations reads @xmath199 while the non diagonal elements are @xmath200 for large numbers of particles , so that @xmath201 are sufficiently large , all terms depending on the inverse length can be neglected , and conditions for the hessian matrix to be positive definite , and hence for the corresponding stationary configuration to be a local minimum , are easy to find : @xmath202 for smaller numbers of particles the complete hessian matrix has to be diagonalized ( e.g.  in a numerical way ) .",
    "a simpler and relevant case is that of equal external potentials , in which we have already remarked that in a stationary configuration the values of the densities of each species must be equal at all the domain walls .",
    "we obtain @xmath203 where we have taken into account that @xmath204 and defined @xmath205 as the intensive and purely diagonal part , and @xmath206 as the lenght - dependent term , which vanishes for large numbers of particles . in this limit , when @xmath207 the condition for a stationary configuration to be locally stable is that the potential @xmath193 be increasing at _ all _ the @xmath179 s which are the upper ( right ) border of an interval containing particles of the first species ( @xmath177 ) , and decreasing at _ all _ the @xmath179 s which are the lower ( left ) border of an interval of the same kind ( @xmath208 ) . intuitively , the less self - interacting condensate [ since we supposed that @xmath207 in eq .",

    "first , since @xmath211 for all pairs of indices , then @xmath212 which implies that only one of the @xmath213 , say @xmath214 , can be nonpositive for a stable configuration , and moreover @xmath215 on the other hand , by applying on the other hand the necessary condition @xmath216 , another constraint can be established , @xmath217 with the upper bound vanishing in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "there are two kinds of maximal stationary configurations : the first one is characterized by the fact that the external potential at each point of @xmath48 is smaller than the potential at each point of @xmath49 , while the second one is characterized by the opposite situation .",
    "the latter , however , is not stable , since the diagonal part of its hessian matrix contains @xmath218 for all @xmath219 .",
    "we can thus limit our attention to the first kind of profiles , which we call the _ maximal stable configurations _",
    "( see ) . we will now prove that if a locally stable configuration is not maximal , there are conditions ensuring that it can not be the ground state of the system . the proof is based on the fact that in a non - maximal and locally stable configuration one of the following situations emerges : either the potential at a point of @xmath48 is greater than the potential at the domain walls , or the potential at a point of @xmath49 is smaller than its value at the domain walls .",
    "examples of non - maximal configurations are represented in .     in the domain walls . in",
    "( b ) the second species occupies one of the minima of the external potential , where it is lower than the value @xmath190 in the domain walls .",
    "]    we remark that both these situations can be present in the same configuration .",
    "we start by considering the first one .",
    "let @xmath220 be the potential at the domain walls .",
    "assume that the potential at a point @xmath221 be such that @xmath222 we exclude the case @xmath223 , implying a vanishing density at @xmath224 .",
    "( this case will be eventually considered as a limit . )",
    "we now consider a subinterval @xmath225 of @xmath49 of length @xmath226 , with a domain wall as one of its edges , and an interval @xmath227 of length @xmath228 , which is a neighborhood of @xmath224 , and impose that the number of first - species particles in @xmath227 be equal to @xmath229 and that of second - species particles in @xmath225 be @xmath230 . since the potential is regular and the densities are supposed to be regular between each pair of domain walls , one gets @xmath231 this equality implies a relation between the length of the considered intervals , depending on the ratio of the densities , which can be expressed in terms of the potentials by using condition : @xmath232 the potential energy of the two selected intervals is given by the sum of the contributions @xmath233 we now replace the original density profiles with flat density profiles which preserve the numbers of particles . in particular , we fill @xmath225 , which initially belonged to @xmath49 , with the first - species condensate with a density @xmath234 and @xmath227 with the second - species particles with a density @xmath235 with these new density profiles , the internal energy of the intervals becomes the sum of the terms @xmath236 the total variation of the internal energy induced by this change is @xmath237 since @xmath207 , we find that if @xmath238 , i.e. , up to first order in @xmath239 , @xmath240 and it is always possible , for sufficiently small @xmath239 , to find a density profile that preserves the numbers of particles , whose energy is smaller than the energy of a non - maximal stable configuration .",
    "it can be observed that if the limit @xmath241 is taken , condition is certainly satisfied .",
    "this means that in the ground - state configuration the intervals of the support @xmath48 of the less self - interacting species can not be bordered by a zero .",
    "if the case in which there exists a point in @xmath242 where the external potential is lower than its value in the domain walls , @xmath243 we find , with the same procedure as in the previous case , that if the following inequality is satisfied @xmath244 the considered non - maximal configuration can never be the ground state of the system .",
    "since usually @xmath245 ( see , e.g. , the hyperfine states of @xmath246 , @xcite ) , conditions - set a very stringent limitation on the possibility that a non - maximal stable configuration be the ground state of the binary mixture .      the results in the case of fixed chemical potentials is very similar to that of fixed numbers of particles , in the thermodynamical limit . the functional to be minimized by separated configuration is ( we set @xmath121 ) @xmath247 an important difference with respect to the previous case is that , since the chemical potentials are fixed and not subject to normalization conditions , the tf density functions are completely independent of the positions of the domain walls .",
    "thus , the functional depends on @xmath172 only through the domains of integrations , which are determined by the supports of the density profiles , and it can be seen again as a function of the domain wall positions : @xmath248 the stationarity conditions are exactly the same as in the case of fixed numbers of particles , since the first derivative with respect to a generic @xmath179 reads @xmath249 however , the hessian matrix in the stationary configurations is diagonal , as in .",
    "the absence of the non - diagonal part lies in the fact that the first derivative depends on the position of the domain walls only through the external potentials .",
    "the stability criterions for a stationary density profile are the same as in the case of fixed numbers of particle , if the thermodynamical limit is considered : a configuration is stable if and only if conditions are satisfied for all @xmath250 .",
    "if the two species lie in the same external potential , these conditions reduce to @xmath251 .    even in the case of fixed chemical potentials ,",
    "it is possible to show that if the potentials are proportional ( [ eq : propv ] ) , there are limitations on the possibility that a non - maximal stable configuration be the ground state . indeed ,",
    "if at the domain walls we have @xmath252 , it can be shown that if there exist a point in @xmath48 , where the potential is @xmath253 and satisfies @xmath254 then the grand - canonical energy of the configuration is higher than the energy of another configuration corresponding to the same chemical potentials .",
    "we observe that the stationarity condition ( with the chemical potentials _",
    "independent _ of @xmath172 ) implies that the chemical potential @xmath16 be greater than @xmath15 .",
    "thus , the left hand side of is an increasing function of @xmath255 .",
    "moreover , the equality is saturated for @xmath256 .",
    "we remark that if the limit @xmath257 is considered , that is if the density profile of the first species condensate has a zero , condition is certainly verified , and then such a configuration can not be the ground state of the system . on the other hand , if there exist a point in @xmath49 where the potential is @xmath258 , satisfying @xmath259 then there exist another configuration corresponding to the same chemical potentials , which has a lower grand - canonical energy . in this second case ,",
    "the left hand side of is a decreasing function of @xmath260 , and the equality is again satisfied by @xmath261 .    here , we sketch the proof in the first case , the second case being analogous .",
    "let us suppose that at a given point @xmath221 the potential satisfies @xmath262 , and consider two intervals @xmath96 and @xmath263 of the same length @xmath239 , @xmath96 lying in @xmath49 and bordered by a domain wall , and @xmath263 lying in @xmath48 and containing @xmath224 .",
    "the chemical potentials are fixed , thus the functional form of the density functions does not depend on the positions of the domain walls .",
    "we now replace in @xmath96 the first species with the second one , and in @xmath263 the second species with the first one , using again tf density functions . taking into account condition @xmath264 , we find that the difference between the energy of the final and the initial configurations is @xmath265+\\or(\\epsilon^2 ) \\,.\\ ] ] for sufficiently small @xmath239 , the final configuration is energetically favored with respect to the initial one , if condition applies .",
    "we finally note that , unlike in - , the conditions - are independent of the value of @xmath190 . even in this case , since usually @xmath266 , conditions - preclude any non - maximal stable configuration from being the ground state .",
    "we have studied the thomas - fermi equations , for a system of two bose - einstein condensates confined in generic potentials . we have emphasized the role of the limiting value @xmath267 in determining if the ground state of the system is a mixed configuration or a stationary one , by assuming that the external potentials be regular .",
    "we then determined a set of conditions to be satisfied by locally stable separated configurations .",
    "then we looked for the ground state among the possible locally stable configurations , and found that those with a maximal numbers of domain walls are usually energetically favorite .",
    "the results presented in this article enable us to find the ground state of binary mixtures in multi - well potentials , given either the numbers of particles or the chemical potentials .",
    "it would be interesting to analyze the changes that a correction to the tf approximation , including the kinetic energies , would introduce in such a picture .",
    "if the numbers of particles are sufficiently high , the tf approximation is very accurate . nonetheless , tf density profiles correspond to diverging kinetic energy , due in particular to the discontinuities at the domain walls .",
    "the kinetic parts intervenes by regularizing the tf solutions , at the expense of an increase in the potential energy , especially in a neighborhood of a domain wall .",
    "this could lead to an inversion in the energetic diagram , in which configurations with few domain walls could become energetically favorite with respect to maximal stable configurations .",
    "this inversion has already been numerically studied in the simple case of a harmonic potential @xcite , but the tools introduced in this article uncover the possibility of extending this kind of analysis to generic multi - well potentials , such as arrays of optical traps , which are now within experimental reach ."
