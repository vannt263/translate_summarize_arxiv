    "one of the most remarkable results in the 3-yr data release from the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) experiment @xcite was the detection of large - scale e - mode polarization at millimeter wavelengths .",
    "this was interpreted as the theoretically predicted signature of reionization , and allowed the wmap team to set new and tighter constraints on the optical depth of reionization @xmath2 . in turn ,",
    "the well - known degeneracy between @xmath2 and the spectral index of primordial scalar perturbations @xmath3 was broken .",
    "the final outcome was a claimed detection of @xmath4 at a statistical significance of almost @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "one should bear in mind , however , the great potential for systematics effects in both the temperature and polarization measurements .",
    "for instance , the precise level of power contribution from unresolved point sources affects @xmath3 directly .",
    "an independent analysis of this particular issue by @xcite showed that the initial point source amplitude quoted by the wmap team was indeed too high , which biased @xmath3 to low values .",
    "similarly , on large scales the likelihood approximation used by the wmap team was biased high @xcite , which also biased @xmath6 low .",
    "after these corrections , the statistical significance of @xmath7 dropped to @xmath8 .    for polarization the situation may be even more serious due to the strong sensitivity of @xmath2 and @xmath6 on the low-@xmath1 ee spectrum , combined with the low signal - to - noise ratio of the wmap data .",
    "systematic effects , both from the instrument itself @xcite and from non - cosmological foregrounds @xcite , are much more likely to affect the results , and we are also much less likely to detect them .",
    "it is therefore imperative to carefully check both the data and the analysis methods , in order to build up confidence in the final cosmological results . in this letter",
    ", we start this task by computing the low-@xmath1 ee , eb , bb and foreground template amplitude posterior distributions from the wmap data .",
    "we use a previously introduced gibbs sampling framework ( jewell et al .  2004 ,",
    "wandelt et al .",
    "2004 , eriksen et al .  2004 ,",
    "larson et al.2007 ; hereafter jwel ) to estimate the posterior distributions . for full details on the method , we refer the interested reader to the quoted papers , and only summarize the principles here .",
    "first we define our notation .",
    "the desired distribution is denoted @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the cmb signal , @xmath11 is the cmb power spectrum , @xmath12 is a set of foreground template amplitudes , and @xmath13 are the data .",
    "the gibbs sampler is a markov chain monte carlo method , and , as such , maps out the full posterior by drawing samples from it .",
    "while direct evaluation or sampling from the posterior @xmath14 requires inversion of a prohibitively large matrix , the gibbs sampling scheme @xcite uses the conditional densities of the joint posterior @xmath15 which is computationally feasible to sample from .",
    "the algorithm may thus be described by the following sampling steps , @xmath16 here the symbol @xmath17 indicates sampling from the conditional distribution on the right hand side , which can be accomplished without inverting the signal - plus - noise covariance matrix ( see jwel for details ) . for the foreground template amplitude distribution",
    ", we note that the required algorithm is identical to that employed for sampling monopole and dipole amplitudes @xcite .",
    "we consider only the low - resolution foreground - corrected 3-yr wmap polarization data in this letter , as provided on lambda . these come in the form of three healpix sky maps , pixelized at @xmath18 , each having 3072 pixels in both",
    "stoke s q and u. the wmap p06 sky cut is imposed on the data , leaving only 2267 pixels for the analysis .",
    "two frequency bands are included , namely q - band ( 41 ghz ) and v - band ( 61 ghz ) .",
    "in addition , we analyze the co - added map ( denoted qv ) , and also the two frequency maps jointly but not co - added ( denoted q+v ) . all maps are provided with a full noise covariance matrix @xcite , appropriately corrected for the p06 sky cut and removal of foreground templates .",
    "the units used in this paper are thermodynamic @xmath19 .    for foreground marginalization",
    ", we adopt two individual templates .",
    "first , we use the k ",
    "ka difference map , smoothed to @xmath20 fwhm resolution to reduce noise contributions , as a tracer of synchrotron emission .",
    "second , for dust emission we adopt the low - noise template developed by the wmap team for their foreground correction procedure @xcite .",
    "note that the specific shape of these templates are of minor importance ; if the provided sky maps are free of foregrounds , they should not correlate significantly with any non - cmb map .",
    "we compare our results to the official wmap likelihood code , also available from lambda . to map out the appropriate posteriors , we have written a special - purpose mcmc wrapper around this likelihood code .",
    "the first case considered is that adopted by the wmap likelihood code , namely the co - added qv map . for this analysis , we fix the eb and bb spectra to zero , and map out the corresponding marginalized ee posteriors @xmath1-by-@xmath1 , both with the gibbs sampler and by the wmap - based mcmc code .    the results from this exercise are shown in figure [ fig : ee_comparison ] .",
    "the agreement between the two approaches is very good , and this is an important validation of the wmap data processing method : first , we analyze the data at their native @xmath18 resolution , while the wmap team analyze maps downgraded to @xmath21 .",
    "second , they marginalize over a single total foreground template , while we marginalize over the k ",
    "ka difference map and a dust template .",
    "third , we use a gibbs sampler for the numerical work , while the wmap team uses a brute - force likelihood evaluator .",
    "none of these differences affects the low-@xmath1 ee spectrum peak visibly , as will be quantified more precisely in the next section .",
    "lcccc    wmap & @xmath22 & @xmath23 & & + qv - band & @xmath24 & @xmath25 & & + q+v - band & @xmath26 & @xmath27 & & + q - band & @xmath28 & @xmath29 & & + v - band & @xmath30 & @xmath31 & & + wmap & @xmath32 & @xmath33 & @xmath34 & @xmath35 + qv - band & @xmath26 & @xmath36 & @xmath37 & @xmath38 + q+v - band & @xmath26 & @xmath39 & @xmath40 & @xmath41 + q - band & @xmath42 & @xmath43 & @xmath44 & @xmath45 + v - band & @xmath46 & @xmath47 & @xmath48 & @xmath49 + qv - band & @xmath50 & @xmath51 & @xmath52 & @xmath53 + q+v - band & @xmath54 & @xmath55 & @xmath56 & @xmath53 + q - band & @xmath57 & @xmath58 & @xmath59 & @xmath60 + v - band & @xmath61 & @xmath62 & @xmath63 & @xmath64    having validated the numerics and data processing steps in both procedures , we now expand the analysis and allow for non - zero eb and/or bb spectra .",
    "we also compute the posteriors for each frequency band separately and jointly .",
    "for presentational reasons , we report only band powers in ee and bb between @xmath656 and @xmath6520 , respectively .",
    "cases of special interest are treated separately in subsequent sections .    in order to achieve good convergence ,",
    "@xmath66 samples were generated for the non - zero eb , @xmath6520 cases .",
    "for all other cases , @xmath67 samples were generated .",
    "the cpu time to generate one sample was @xmath68 seconds .",
    "the results from these computations are summarized in table [ tab : band_power ] .",
    "the ee posteriors with fixed eb = bb = 0 are shown in figure [ fig : ee_bin_power ] . again ,",
    "note the excellent agreement between the wmap results and the qv and q+v cases in the two top sections .",
    "however , even though the joint qv analyses agree well , the picture is considerably less clear when it comes to single bands and relaxed eb constraints . on the one hand",
    ", there appears to be more ee power in the v - band data than in the q - band data . on the other hand",
    ", there may seem to be small traces of bb power in the q - band data .",
    "the bb posteriors develop a peak away from @xmath69 in the eb@xmath70 case .",
    "this is not surprising .",
    "since the signal covariance matrix is positive definite , one must have @xmath71 .",
    "therefore , when marginalizing over @xmath72 , a non - zero peak emerges in both the ee and bb spectra individually .      in figure",
    "[ fig : foregrounds ] we show the foreground template amplitude posteriors for the q- , v- and qv - band data , for the case with fixed eb = bb = 0 . although no signs of significant residual foregrounds are observed in the co - added qv band , apparently confirming the fits made by the wmap team , the same is not true for each band individually . on the contrary ,",
    "non - zero correlations are seen in both the q- and v - band data individually .    for the q - band data , the marginal best - fit k ",
    "ka amplitude is @xmath73 , different from zero at @xmath74 .",
    "the best - fit dust amplitude is @xmath75 . for the v - band data , the best - fit dust amplitude is @xmath76 , 2.3@xmath77 away from zero .",
    "ka amplitude is @xmath78 .",
    "these results may be compared to table 4 of @xcite .",
    "the main difference between the two analyses is that while we apply the conservative p06 mask to the data , @xcite apply the much more aggressive processing mask described by @xcite .",
    "the two analyses remove 26.4% and 5.7% of the sky , respectively .",
    "considering that all cosmological analyses are carried out with the p06 mask , and that variations in the synchrotron spectral index are observed between the galactic plane and the high latitudes @xcite , it is not immediately clear to us why the more aggressive mask was chosen for this task by the wmap team .",
    "the improvement in raw @xmath79 after further correcting the `` cleaned '' wmap maps for these residuals is -5.4 for the q - band and -3.3 for the v - band , respectively .",
    "two other , minor differences are that we take into account both the full noise and cmb covariance matrices , while the wmap team includes only a white noise covariance approximation .",
    "note that this carries no extra cost within the gibbs sampling framework .",
    "we find evidence for a non - zero eb correlation in the v - band sky map .",
    "this spectrum is shown in figure [ fig : eb_correlation ] for the q- and v - band sky maps individually , together with the pseudo-@xmath81 eb qv - band spectrum computed by the wmap team .",
    "note the consistently negative correlation observed in the v - band .",
    "although the significance of the negative correlation is not more than a few tenths per multipole , and the joint significance is not more than 1 to 2@xmath77 depending on binning scheme , it is observed consistently in every multipole up to @xmath82 . a similar , though weaker , trend is seen in the pseudo - spectrum computed by the wmap team from the qv combination .",
    "we have performed a bayesian analysis of the low - resolution foreground - corrected 3-yr wmap polarization data using a previously described methodology based on the gibbs sampler . by doing so",
    ", we validated the numerical implementation of the official wmap likelihood code , as well as their procedure for degradation of map resolution .",
    "however , when generalizing the analysis to allow for non - zero eb and bb power spectrum components , and also considering individual frequency bands , we found several issues that may be important for the cosmological interpretation of these data .",
    "first and foremost , when relaxing the constraints on eb and bb , noticeable differences between the q- and v - band posteriors are observed .",
    "specifically , we find generally more ee power in the v - band data than in the q - band data , but also perhaps some hints of bb power in the q - band data . at the same time",
    ", we have also found a negative eb correlation in the v - band map , as well as residual foregrounds in both maps .",
    "if these tentative findings are confirmed by future experiments or additional years of wmap observations , significant shifts in cosmological parameters could be the result .",
    "for example , if the v - band data alone were used for the wmap3 analysis instead of the qv combination , the amplitude of the @xmath656 ee detection would increase by 2050% , depending on whether bb is allowed to vary or not . consequently",
    ", @xmath2 could increase from 0.09 to @xmath83 , and @xmath84 by a percent or two , comparable to its current nominal statistical uncertainty of 0.015 , from @xmath85 to @xmath86 .    as discussed in the introduction , systematics are a serious concern for both the temperature and polarization data for both @xmath2 and @xmath6 .",
    "it is important to bear in mind that the currently quoted uncertainties on these quantities often found in the literature are statistical only .",
    "the unknown systematic uncertainties may turn out to be non - negligible for the currently available data sets , and , in particular , we believe it is too early to draw any firm conclusions concerning the precise value of @xmath6 . fortunately , planck will clarify these issues in the near future .",
