    "the galaxy luminosity function ( lf ) characterizes the number density of galaxies as a function of luminosity , or absolute magnitude .",
    "the faint end of the lf tells us the abundance of dwarf galaxies , accurate knowledge of which is important for constraining models of both galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "the optical galaxy luminosity function has traditionally been fit by a schechter @xcite function : @xmath0 for galaxies more luminous than a characteristic luminosity @xmath1 , @xmath2 drops exponentially with luminosity ; for galaxies fainter than @xmath1 @xmath2 approaches a power - law with slope @xmath3 .",
    "the quantity @xmath4 represents an overall normalisation of the luminosity function .",
    "most local galaxy surveys ( eg . @xcite ) have found a value of @xmath3 that lies in the range @xmath5 , giving a `` flat '' faint - end slope when the lf is plotted as a function of absolute magnitude . however , there is recent evidence that the faint end of the lf is not well fit by a schechter function :    1 .",
    "an analysis of the cfa redshift survey by marzke _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite finds that although the best - fit schechter function has @xmath6 , there is a significant excess of galaxies above the schechter fit at magnitudes @xmath7 of 100 km s@xmath8 mpc@xmath8 ] .",
    "2 .   for the las campanas redshift survey , lin _ et al . _",
    "@xcite measure a faint - end slope of @xmath10 in the gunn-@xmath11 band . however , all of their data points fainter than @xmath12 lie above this schechter fit .",
    "3 .   in their analysis of the eso slice project ( esp )",
    "redshift survey , zucca _ et al . _",
    "@xcite find that the @xmath13 luminosity function is best fit by a flat faint - end schechter function for @xmath14 and a power - law of slope @xmath15 at fainter magnitudes .",
    "given the importance of the number - density of local dwarf galaxies for theories of galaxy formation and evolution , it is extremely desirable to better constrain the faint - end of the luminosity function .",
    "the problem is that most galaxies in flux - limited surveys have @xmath16 and measuring galaxy redshifts to fainter magnitudes does not increase the number of dwarf galaxies _ relative _ to the number of bright galaxies .",
    "there is no substitute for surveying large numbers of faint galaxies to constrain the faint - end of the lf .",
    "thus we require either to carry out large redshift surveys , such as 2df  @xcite and sdss  @xcite , or to estimate galaxy redshifts from their photometric colours or clustering properties .    in the following section",
    "i will describe how one can constrain the space density of dwarf galaxies from counts of faint galaxies around bright galaxies of known redshift .",
    "i will then review the properties of galaxies which dominate the faint - end of the lf and discuss future prospects for measuring the field galaxy lf .",
    "if one has a large , photometric galaxy sample , and redshifts for a subset of these galaxies , one can make use of the fact that excess galaxies seen close in projection to galaxies of known redshift are likely to be at the same distance .",
    "this is a statistical generalization of the method used to determine the luminosity function of galaxies in clusters in which one assumes that all galaxies in a cluster are at the same distance from the observer . due to the large numbers of galaxies",
    ", one can estimate @xmath17 to faint luminosities @xcite .      consider in turn each redshift survey ( centre ) galaxy at distance @xmath18 :    * count galaxies in bins of projected separation @xmath19 ( where @xmath20 is the angular separation ) and apparent magnitude @xmath21 about each centre .",
    "* the excess counts above a random distribution gives an estimate of the product @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the projection of the spatial correlation function @xmath24 along the line of sight : @xmath25    one then averages @xmath26 over all centre galaxies with minimum - variance weighting and divides @xmath26 by an _ assumed _",
    "@xmath23 to obtain a final estimate of @xmath17 .",
    "= 0.6      the above analysis was carried out using 2.4 million apm galaxies and 1787 centre galaxies from the stromlo - apm redshift survey @xcite .",
    "the estimated lf is shown in figure  [ fig : lumx ] , where we have counted faint galaxies to a projected separation @xmath27 and we have assumed that the galaxy correlation function is given by the power - law @xmath28 .",
    "we see two major differences from a flat faint - end schechter function :    1 .   the estimated lf drops below a flat faint - end schechter function in the luminosity range @xmath29 .",
    "this is most likely due to the fact that this analysis assumes galaxies cluster independently of their luminosity , whereas we know that sub-@xmath1 galaxies are more weakly clustered than @xmath30 galaxies @xcite .",
    "2 .   faintward of @xmath31 , the lf steepens and exceeds a flat faint - end schechter function by @xmath32 .    to model the observed @xmath17 ,",
    "we have fitted a modified form of the schechter function , with an additional faint - end power law : @xmath33 .",
    "\\label{eqn : dpschec}\\ ] ] in this formulation @xmath4 , @xmath1 and @xmath3 are the standard schechter parameters , @xmath34 is a transition luminosity between the two power - laws and @xmath35 is the power - law slope of the very faint - end .",
    "no physical interpretation is intended by this choice of formula , it is merely a convenient way of modeling the observed @xmath2 over this extended range of luminosity and for estimating the faint - end slope .",
    "the line in figure  [ fig : lumx ] shows the best - fit `` double power - law '' luminosity function , which has parameters : @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 ( not @xmath41 as erroneously stated in @xcite ) .",
    "although this fit is poor over the range @xmath42 , our @xmath17 estimate is almost certainly biased low over this range by the weaker clustering of galaxies fainter than @xmath1 .",
    "clearly , the faint - end slope @xmath43 can not extend to indefinitely low luminosities , but it shows no obvious signs of flattening brightward of @xmath44 .",
    "since we are essentially measuring the product of the galaxy luminosity function @xmath17 with the projected correlation function @xmath23 , then any dependence of @xmath23 on galaxy luminosity can bias our estimate of @xmath17 .",
    "thus the faint - end turn up could be due to a genuine increase in the local density of dwarf galaxies or an artifact caused by strong clustering of dwarf galaxies around @xmath1 galaxies .    however , one can place a lower limit on the space density of dwarf galaxies by making the extreme assumption that they only exist close to @xmath30 galaxies .",
    "we see an excess of dwarf galaxies up to a projected separation of at least @xmath45 from @xmath30 galaxies @xcite .",
    "thus a limit may be estimated by assuming that they occur with the measured space density only within @xmath45 of an @xmath30 galaxy . integrating ( [ eqn : dpschec ] ) over the magnitude range @xmath46 , we measure a space density @xmath47",
    ". a lower limit on the average mean density of dwarf galaxies is then given by multiplying this by the fraction of space within @xmath45 of an @xmath30 galaxy ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "we thus arrive at a limit on the space density of dwarf galaxies , here defined to lie in the luminosity range @xmath46 , of @xmath49 .",
    "this is a factor of two higher than the density @xmath50 inferred from the extrapolation of a @xmath51 schechter function @xcite .",
    "in fact , the true space density of dwarf galaxies is likely to be significantly higher than this , for a number of reasons .",
    "first , our estimator assumes that galaxy clustering is independent of luminosity , whereas we know that sub-@xmath1 ( @xmath52 ) galaxies are less strongly clustered than more luminous galaxies @xcite .",
    "if this luminosity segregation extends to dwarf ( @xmath53 ) galaxies , then we will have underestimated their space density .",
    "second , analysis of simulations @xcite shows that our estimator tends to underestimate the faint - end slope of @xmath17 slightly , possibly due to a malmquist - type bias .",
    "third , as discussed by numerous authors ( eg . @xcite and references therein ) , most galaxy surveys are likely to be missing a substantial fraction of low surface brightness galaxies , many of which will be dwarfs .",
    "for example , sprayberry _ et al . _",
    "@xcite find a pronounced upturn in the luminosity function for their sample of low surface - brightness galaxies .",
    "thus the true space density of dwarf galaxies in the magnitude range @xmath46 could be significantly higher than @xmath54 .    a high space density of dwarf galaxies , assuming that they are predominantly late - type , blue galaxies ( see following section ) , which suffer smaller @xmath55-correction dimming than redder",
    ", early - type galaxies , helps provide a natural explanation for the steep observed number counts of faint galaxies .",
    "gronwall and koo @xcite were able to match observations of galaxy number counts in the @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 bands , as well as colour and redshift distributions , for a mild evolution model by assuming that the faint end of the galaxy luminosity function is dominated by blue galaxies ( @xmath58 ) , and rises significantly above a schechter function with flat faint - end slope .",
    "the gronwall & koo model total luminosity function is plotted in figure  [ fig : lumx ] , and one sees remarkably good agreement with our observations .",
    "these results thus support the argument of gronwall & koo ; there is no need to invoke exotic forms of galaxy evolution to explain observed galaxy number counts at faint magnitudes .    as a final caveat",
    ", i would stress that all existing data on the lf of galaxies fainter than @xmath31 comes from galaxies within a distance of @xmath59 ( within @xmath60 for @xmath61 ) and so the estimated faint - end lf is susceptible to sampling fluctuations .",
    "more data is certainly needed before we can really claim to have nailed down the faint end of the galaxy luminosity function .",
    "in this section i review measurements of the luminosity function of galaxy samples selected by morphological and spectral type , colour , surface brightness and star - formation activity to investigate the properties of galaxies that dominate the faint - end of the lf .",
    "the faint - end slope @xmath3 in what follows refers to a standard schechter function ( [ eqn : schec ] ) fit performed by the respective authors .",
    "morphology : :    marzke _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have measured the luminosity function of    galaxies in the cfa redshift surveys selected by morphological type .",
    "they find that the lf of galaxies with hubble types ranging from e to    sd all have a flat faint - end slope , but that the lf of magellanic    spirals and irregulars has faint - end slope    @xmath62 .",
    "very similar results are found from a    recent analysis of the southern sky redshift survey ( ssrs , @xcite ) ,    in which the lf of irregular / peculiar galaxies has faint - end slope    @xmath63 .",
    "spectral type : :    bromley _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have classified galaxies in the las campanas    redshift survey by spectral type . the faint - end slope    @xmath3 is seen to steepen systematically and    significantly from earliest ( @xmath64 ) to latest    ( @xmath65 ) spectral classification .",
    "these authors    also find that the faint - end slope steepens with local density for    early type - galaxies ; for late - type galaxies there is no significant    luminosity - density relation .",
    "a steepening of faint - end slope with    later spectral types is also seen in a preliminary analysis of data    from the 2df redshift survey @xcite .",
    "colour : :    marzke & da costa @xcite have subdivided the ssrs into blue and red    samples at @xmath66 . the blue sample is well - fitted    by a schechter function with faint - end slope    @xmath67 ; the red sample with    @xmath68 .",
    "surface brightness : :    sprayberry _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have measured the luminosity function from    an apm survey of low surface brightness ( lsb ) galaxies .",
    "fitting a    schechter function to their lf they measure    @xmath69 .",
    "however , their data is better fit by a    schechter function with @xmath70 for galaxies    brighter than @xmath71 and a power law with slope    @xmath72 for fainter galaxies .",
    "they find that the space    density of lsbs exceeds that of `` normal '' high surface - brightness    galaxies for @xmath73 .",
    "star formation activity : :    several authors have recently measured the lf of galaxies selected by    star - formation activity .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite subdivided the las    campanas redshift survey into two using the equivalent width of the    @xmath74 3727 $ ] line and found that star - forming galaxies    ( @xmath75 ) have    @xmath76 versus    @xmath77 for non star - forming galaxies .",
    "the    later spectral types of @xcite also correspond to strong    emission - line galaxies . similarly , zucca _ et al . _",
    "@xcite find a    significantly steeper faint - end slope for galaxies with detected    @xmath74 $ ] in the esp survey .",
    "we @xcite have recently    measured the lf of galaxies in the stromlo - apm survey selected by    equivalent width of both  and  lines .",
    "the lfs for the  selected    samples are shown in figure  [ fig : lf_ha ] ; we see very similar results    for the  selected samples .",
    "we find that galaxies with significant    star - formation dominate the luminosity function fainter than    @xmath78 .",
    "= 0.6    it is thus apparent that the faint - end of the field galaxy luminosity function is dominated by galaxies which tend to be of late morphological and spectral type , blue in colour , of low surface - brightness and which are currently undergoing significant star - formation .",
    "these results strongly suggest that it is dwarf irregular galaxies , rather than dwarf ellipticals , that dominate the faint end of the luminosity function in the field .",
    "this contrasts with dwarf galaxies in cluster environments , which are mostly dwarf ellipticals ( trentham , these proceedings ) .",
    "= 0.6    in the near future , two large new redshifts surveys will have a dramatic impact on measurement of the field lf .",
    "the anglo - australian telescope 2df galaxy redshift survey @xcite will measure redshifts for @xmath79 galaxies to @xmath80 and for 100,000 galaxies to @xmath81 .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss @xcite ) will image @xmath82 sr of the northern sky in 5 colours to @xmath83 and measure redshifts for @xmath84 galaxies .",
    "i have made five simulations of the sdss main galaxy spectroscopic sample ( 900,000 galaxies to @xmath85 ) assuming a schechter lf with @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "the lf for each simulation was estimated using the stepwise maximum likelihood estimator @xcite and in figure  [ fig : sdss ] i show the mean estimated lf along with the rms dispersion between the simulations .",
    "one can see that we can expect to measure a reliable lf to @xmath88 , or even fainter if the lf does indeed have a steeper faint - end slope .",
    "one would expect to be able to determine the lf to @xmath89 by measuring the clustering of faint galaxies in the sdss about galaxies with measured redshifts",
    ". the large sdss dataset and accurate photometry will enable the clustering of galaxies as a function of luminosity as well as separation @xmath90 to be accurately determined .",
    "thus the uncertainty in the luminosity - dependence of the correlation function , which dominates the errors in constraining the space density of dwarf galaxies described in ",
    "[ sec : clust ] , will be avoided .",
    "photometric redshifts estimated from the five sdss colours ( eg .",
    "@xcite ) will be extremely important for studying evolution of the lf , but of limited use for the local faint - end since the uncertainty in photometric redshift @xmath91 .",
    "possibly the best determination of the faint - end of the field galaxy lf will come from spectroscopic followup of faint @xmath92 galaxies selected from the sdss .",
    "as emphasized elsewhere @xcite , galaxies of different morphological or spectral type have different luminosity functions , and the lf for each galaxy type should be measured independently .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey will provide a wealth of morphological , colour and spectral information for each galaxy and thus enable a careful study of the dependence of the lf on galaxy properties .",
    "the simulated lf in figure  [ fig : sdss ] assumes that the sdss galaxy sample will be purely flux - limited . in practice of course",
    ", surface brightness also plays an important role in galaxy detection .",
    "for example , sprayberry _ et al . _",
    "@xcite argue that most existing local galaxy catalogues have missed a substantial fraction of ( lsb ) galaxies .",
    "since the sdss imaging will be carried out in drift - scan mode , detection of lsb objects will be limited by photon statistics rather than flat - fielding errors .",
    "we expect to be able to detect at @xmath93 a @xmath94 galaxy with a scale - length of @xmath95 and a central surface brightness of 27.5 mag arcsec@xmath96 @xcite . even though we will not be able ( or even attempt ) to measure redshifts for most galaxies of this surface brightness",
    ", the surface brightness selection criteria will be very well defined and therefore correctable .",
    "1 .   evidence is building that a single schechter function can not fit the observed lf over a wide range of magnitudes .",
    "this is at least partly due to the fact that galaxies of different morphological type have differing lfs .",
    "several surveys are finding excess galaxies above a schechter function at the faint end .",
    "3 .   these excess galaxies tend to be of late morphological and spectral type , blue in colour , of low surface - brightness and undergoing significant star - formation .",
    "the faint - end of the field lf is thus dominated by dwarf irregular rather than dwarf elliptical galaxies .",
    "a turnup in the lf of dwarf galaxies can help reconcile faint galaxy number counts and redshift distributions without the need to invoke exotic evolutionary models .",
    "5 .   future surveys , such as the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , will enable us to measure the field galaxy lf to @xmath97 , provided proper account is taken of surface brightness selection effects .",
