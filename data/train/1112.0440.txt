    "the physical nature of scattering processes which control transport represents one of the most fundamental properties for any material . at the lowest temperatures the thermal excitations are few , and elastic impurity scattering dominates .",
    "raising the temperature introduces two basic pathways to modify transport .",
    "first , elastic scattering can acquire a temperature dependence either through the modified screening of the impurity potential , or through dephasing processes.@xcite this general mechanism encapsulates the physical content of all `` quantum corrections ''  both in the diffusive and the ballistic regime  predicted within the fermi liquid framework .",
    "indeed , careful and precise experiments have confirmed the validity of this physical picture for many good metals with weak disorder .",
    "@xcite physically , it relies on the existence of long - lived quasiparticles within a degenerate electron gas .",
    "the second route comes into play in instances where correlation effects due to electron - electron interactions are significant . here , the fermi liquid regime featuring degenerate quasiparticles is often restriced to a very limited temperature range @xmath5 , well below the `` coherence temperature '' @xmath0 , which itself is much smaller than the fermi temperature @xmath6 . in such materials , which include rare - earth intermetallics,@xcite many transition metal oxides,@xcite and several classes of organic mott systems,@xcite a broad intermediate temperature regime emerges @xmath7 where _ inelastic _ electron - electron scattering dominates all transport properties .",
    "such scattering directly reflects the thermal destruction of landau quasiparticles  a situation describing the demise of a coherent fermi liquid . in these materials , in the relevant temperature range ,",
    "the electron - phonon scattering is much weaker than the electron - electron one .    when a material is tuned to the vicinity of any metal - insulator transition,@xcite both disorder and electron - electron interactions",
    "are of _ a priori _ importance .",
    "but which of these two scattering mechanisms  elastic or inelastic  dominates the experimentally relevant temperature range ?",
    "answering this question should provide important clues as to which of the localization mechanisms dominate in any given material .",
    "unfortunately , experimental systems permitting sufficiently precise tuning of control parameters are generally rather few .",
    "an attractive class of systems where a dramatic metal to insulator crossover is observed in a narrow parameter range is provided by two dimensional electron gases ( 2deg ) , such as silicon mosfets or gaas / algaas heterostructures.@xcite one of the most striking features observed in these systems is the pronounced resistivity drop on the metallic side of the transition . while conventional , relatively weak temperature dependence is found at high densities ( @xmath8 , very strong temperature dependence is found near the critical density @xmath9 , roughly in the same density range @xmath10 where other strong correlation phenomena were observed , e.g. large @xmath4 enhancement.@xcite here , pronounced resistivity maxima are observed at @xmath11 , followed by a dramatic resistivity drop at lower temperatures , whose physical origin remains a subject of much controversy and debate.@xcite    in this paper we argue that the electron - electron scattering dominates the transport in a broad concentration and temperature range on the metallic side of the metal - insulator transition ( mit ) in si mosfets and gaas / algaas heterostructures .",
    "this conclusion is reached by : ( i ) a detailed scaling analysis of the metallic resistivity curves ; ( ii ) establishing a similarity in the transport properties of the 2deg and well - studied strongly correlated materials near the interaction - driven mit ; ( iii ) making a comparison of the resistivity curves in 2deg with those in a simple model of the mott mit .",
    "our conclusions favor the interaction - driven ( wigner - mott ) scenario@xcite of the mit in 2deg and provide a guidance for the development of a microscopical theory of incoherent transport in diluted 2deg .",
    "the remaining part of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "our phenomenological scaling of the experimental data is shown in sec .",

    "is presented in sec .",
    "iv , and sec .",
    "v contains the conclusion and discussion .",
    "the experimental data reveal well defined trends in the density dependence of the resistivity maxima , suggesting a scaling analysis .",
    "while many different scenarios for the metal - insulator transition predict some form of scaling , its precise features may provide clues to what mechanism dominates the transport .",
    "all of the curves displaying a resistivity maximum have an almost identical shape [ fig .  [ pudalovdata ] ] , strongly suggesting that unique physical processes are responsible for a strong temperature dependence of the resistivity in a large range of concentrations .",
    "the resistivity maxima are typically observed at temperatures comparable to the fermi temperature , where a physical picture of long - lived quasiparticles is no more valid .",
    "complementary experiments@xcite on the same material have revealed that large effective mass @xmath4 enhancements are observed in the same density range .",
    "this behavior is a clear signature of strong correlation effects which , in all known examples , produce very strong inelastic electron - electron scattering in the appropriate temperature range .",
    "the electron - phonon scattering is negligibly small for @xmath12 k.@xcite since a strongly correlated system is typically characterized by a single characteristic energy scale @xmath13 , we expect the scaling function @xmath14 to assume a universal form , while the scaling parameters @xmath15 and @xmath1 to assume a simple , power - law dependence on the effective mass @xmath16 guided by these observations , in this section we introduce a scaling ansatz and perform a scaling analysis of the resistivity curves in si mosfets and gaas heterostructures .      in accordance to what is typically found in other examples of strongly correlated metals with weak to moderate",
    "disorder,@xcite we expect the resistivity to assume an additive form , @xmath17 . here , @xmath18 is the residual resistivity due to impurity scattering , and the temperature - dependent contribution @xmath19 is expected to be dominated by inelastic electron - electron scattering .",
    "based on these general considerations , we propose that the temperature - dependent term assumes a scaling form @xmath20 where @xmath21 .",
    "to test this phenomenological scaling hypothesis , we perform a corresponding analysis of experimental data in several systems displaying 2d - mit .",
    "we start with the si mosfet data@xcite analyzed in ref .  .",
    "we concentrate on metallic curves below the separatrix c. in the range of concentrations , @xmath22 , the resistivity curves have a clear maximum , and nicely collapse with the proposed scaling ansatz , fig .  [",
    "scaledexp](a ) .",
    "in fact , we can use the scaling ansatz to collapse also the data for @xmath23 , where @xmath24 and @xmath1 are determined from the least square fit to the scaling curve .",
    "clearly all eight resistivity curves belong to the same family ( have the same functional form ) , and thus must be explained by a _ single dominant transport mechanism_. this conclusion is even more convincing if we apply the same analysis to several different materials , including an ultra high mobility gaas sample , fig .",
    "[ scaledexp](b ) .",
    "while the diffusive physics can not possible apply in such a broad parameter range , we see that the scaling form we propose proves to be an extremely robust feature of all available 2d - mit systems .",
    "this result is very significant , because disorder effects must be significantly weaker in these ultra - clean materials , while the interaction effects are expected to be even stronger .",
    "having demonstrated data collapse , we are now in a position to examine the critical behavior of the relevant crossover scale .",
    "we thus examine the behavior of @xmath24 and @xmath1 as a function of reduced concentration @xmath25 and effective mass @xmath26 ( as determined by complementary experiments ) .    for different realizations of 2deg , @xmath24 shows approximately power law dependence on the reduced concentration [ fig .",
    "[ n - nc_scaling](a ) ] and even the exponents are similar . @xmath24 in our physical picture has a clear physical interpretation as a coherence temperature - the temperature when the inelastic electron - electron scattering time becomes comparable to @xmath27 , leading to incoherent transport .",
    "the resistivity maximum , however , shows less universal form .",
    "it varies a lot in different physical systems .",
    "this does not come as a surprise since the resistivity shows nonuniversal features also in three dimensional strongly correlated materials near the mott transition .",

    "we further analyze the critical behavior for si mosfet using the data for the effective mass as determined by shashkin _",
    "et al._@xcite from magnetoresistance measurements in a parallel magnetic field .",
    "we find that @xmath24 is inversely proportional to the effective mass @xmath26 .",
    "this behavior is typical to all systems near the mott mit , where the coherence temperature is inversely proportional to the effective mass , as a landmark of strong correlations .",
    "we have successfully collapsed resistivity curves in a broad temperature and concentration range and for several physical realizations of 2deg .",
    "the physical picture behind the proposed scaling is that the 2d mit is an interaction - driven ( wigner - mott ) mit,@xcite and that the dominant temperature dependence in the resistivity originates from strong electron - electron scattering .",
    "another proposed scenario envisions disorder as the principal driving force for localization,@xcite while the interactions are most important above the critical density and at low temperatures , where they suppress the tendency to localization . an appropriate theory , based on a fermi",

    "the authors point out , though , that this prediction is expected to be valid only within the diffusive regime , where the thermal energy @xmath30 is smaller than the elastic scattering rate @xmath31 . according to this picture , a different ( ballistic ) mechanism for transport",
    "is expected outside the diffusive regime , presumably leading to a different temperature dependence , so the proposed scaling no longer holds .",
    "this analysis was applied to the experimental data of ref . , but was accordingly restricted to only three densities closest to the transition .",
    "indeed , if the scaling formula is applied in a broader range of concentrations , the resistivity curves clearly do not collapse [ fig .  [ pfscaling ] ] . while the fermi liquid renormalization group calculations are very important in order to answer a fundamental question of necessary conditions for a true mit at zero temperature",
    ", our analysis emphasizes that the understanding of various diluted 2deg in a broad range of parameters requires the physics beyond the conventional fermi liquid framework .",
    "the strong temperature dependence of resistivity is a well known feature of many strongly correlated materials .",
    "a pronounced resistivity maximum is observed in heavy fermions,@xcite and charge - transfer organic salts,@xcite where the correlation strength is tuned by applying an external pressure .",
    "the essential mechanism of transport in these materials relies on strong inelastic electron - electron scattering , and the fermi liquid behavior is restricted to the lowest temperatures . as the temperature increases ,",
    "the electron mean free path becomes comparable to , or smaller than the lattice spacing , and the transport becomes incoherent .",
    "the electron - phonon scattering is here much weaker than the electron - electron one .",
    "the temperature of the resistivity maximum can be taken as a definition of the coherence temperature @xmath32 .",
    "it is inversely proportional to the effective mass , and much smaller than the bare fermi temperature , @xmath33 . the same scaling ansatz as given by eq .",

    "remarkable similarity in resistivity curves in such diverse physical systems like si mosfets , gaas heterostructures , heavy fermions and charge - transfer organic conductors is , in our view , a manifestation of the same physical processes in the vicinity of the interaction - driven mit .",
    "having phenomenologically established precise and well defined scaling behavior of the experimental curves on the metallic side of the 2d mit for temperatures near @xmath32 , we now address its microscopic origin .",
    "more precisely , we would like to understand just how robust this result is .",
    "does it depend on subtle details describing the interplay of disorder and interactions of 2deg materials , as suggested in ref .  , or is it a generic feature of strong correlation near interaction - driven mit . to answer this important question",
    "we deliberately focus on the simplest microscopic model for interaction - driven mit : the clean single - band hubbard model at half - filling .",
    "accurate and quantitatively precise results can be obtained for temperature - dependent transport for this model within the dmft approximation.@xcite while the dmft reproduces fermi liquid behavior at the lowest temperatures , it is particularly useful in the studies of `` high temperature '' incoherent transport .",
    "results of such calculation , obtained by the continuous time quantum monte carlo ( ctqmc ) impurity solver@xcite followed by the analytical continuation by the maximum entropy method@xcite , can be analyzed using precisely the same scaling procedure we proposed for experimental data .",

    "while consistent with simple model calculations for strongly correlated electronic systems , our work does not directly address specific microscopic mechanism responsible for current dissipation , a process that in 2deg systems should be facilitated by impurities and imperfections.@xcite still , it provides very strong motivation to develop a more realistic microscopic theory of incoherent transport in the strongly correlated regime of diluted 2deg .",
