    "the most important property of general relativity in 2 + 1 dimensions is the lack of local degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "there are not enough dimensions to support gravitational waves , which transmit the gravitational interaction .",
    "the theory is not completely `` void '' however .",
    "one can introduce so called topological degrees of freedom by choosing a spacetime manifold that is not simply connected .",
    "the study of these cosmological models was greatly facilitated by the observation that 2 + 1-dimensional gravity is equivalent to a chern - simons theory of the poincar group @xcite .",
    "the physical degrees of freedom can be described by wilson loops .",
    "also a great deal of progress was made in the quantization of these models , although it is still not clear whether all approaches result in equivalent quantum theories @xcite .",
    "another group of degrees of freedom are usually introduced as punctures in the surface . to these punctures",
    "one can attach a parameter , the mass , by adding a particle lagrangian to the einstein hilbert action .",
    "it consists of a kinetic term and a constraint , which puts the particle on a mass shell . because of the topological nature of the interaction , the curvature vanishes everywhere except at the location of the particle .",
    "the effect of the mass is to cut out a wedge from spacetime in such a way that the particle is located at the tip of a cone . for a static particle for instance ,",
    "the deficit angle of this cone is @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the mass of the particle .",
    "newtons constant @xmath3 has the dimension of an inverse mass in three dimensions .",
    "multi particle models are well understood at the level of classical equations of motion @xcite . at the quantum level",
    ", it is possible to calculate the exact scattering amplitude for two gravitating particles @xcite , but a consistent multi particle hilbert space has not been found .",
    "the fact that point particles in 2 + 1 dimensional gravity are non - trivial objects was demonstrated only recently by t  hooft @xcite .",
    "he suggested that the momentum of the particle , which is canonically conjugate to the distance from an arbitrary origin , is actually an angle .",
    "this fact was exploited to perform an unusual quantization .",
    "he defined the momentum on a sphere and the energy on a circle , resulting in non - commuting operators for the coordinates .",
    "the schrdinger equation became a dirac equation on some kind of spacetime lattice .",
    "this was not the first time that someone proposed to use a curved momentum space however . back in 1946",
    "snyder @xcite proposed to use de - sitter or anti - de - sitter space as momentum space . in any case",
    ", the deviation from flat momentum space will not be noticeable at small energy scales .",
    "however , at large energy scales , the deviation influences the short distance behaviour in spacetime .    in this article",
    ", we want to derive the phase space of a gravitating particle from first principles .",
    "we start from the first order einstein hilbert action for 2 + 1 dimensional gravity and add a particle term to it , which is chosen such that the neighbourhood of the particle looks like a cone with a deficit angle of @xmath4 .",
    "we also have to add a boundary term to the action , in order to render the lagrangian finite and to obtain the correct equations of motion at spatial infinity .",
    "this procedure will , almost automatically , introduce an additional degree of freedom into the system , which can be associated with an observer sitting at infinity . as a result , the gravitational field , which itself has no local degrees of freedom , describes the interaction of the particle with an external observer .    after dividing out the gauge degrees of freedom , we arrive at a finite dimensional reduced phase space , which is spanned by position and momentum coordinates .",
    "the position is a vector in minkowski space , which can be interpreted as the location of the particle measured in the rest frame of the external observer .",
    "so far , the description is the same as that of a relativistic point particle in flat minkowski space .",
    "however , the momentum of the particle is not a vector , but an element of the spinor representation of the lorentz group @xmath0 .",
    "so , the momentum space is indeed curved , but it is not a sphere . instead , it is locally isomorphic to anti - de - sitter space .",
    "its cotangent space is the algebra @xmath5 , which is isomorphic to minkowski space , and thus to the position space of the particle .",
    "hence , all together the phase space becomes the cotangent bundle @xmath6 .",
    "this has some consequences for the poisson algebra and the symmetries of the phase space .",
    "for example , the components of the position vector will not commute with each other . at the quantum level , this leads to a new kind of uncertainty relation , which states that it is not possible to localize the particle within a region that is smaller than the planck size .",
    "we can also say that the quantized particle lives in a `` non - commutative '' spacetime .",
    "it is important to note that this comes out as a result .",
    "we do not start from a non - commutative structure of spacetime or anything like that _ a priori_. to see what such a non - commutative spacetime looks like , we set up a quantum representation that is very similar to the euclidean angular momentum hilbert space in three dimensions .",
    "the basic symmetry group that acts on the reduced phase space , and then also on the quantum hilbert space , turns out to be the poincar group .",
    "this is not unexpected , because the position coordinate of the particle lives in minkowski space .",
    "however , and this is a somewhat surprising effect , this group is not represented in the ordinary way . in particular ,",
    "a translation is not represented as a simple shift of the position coordinates , but as a more complicated deformed translation , which also involves the momenta . only for small momenta",
    ", it reduces to an ordinary translation . that the poincar group naturally acts on the reduced phase space can also be seen from the fact that the latter is , as a manifold , a special representation thereof , @xmath7 , and the natural action is the adjoint action of this group onto itself .",
    "the absence of the ordinary translation symmetry has some consequences for the quantum theory as well .",
    "it turns out that there is a distinguished point in spacetime .",
    "the light cone emerging from this point divides the quantum spacetime into regions with quite different structures .",
    "space and time are discrete in the causal past and future of this point , whereas in the region that is spacelikely separated from this point , space is continuous but time is still discrete .",
    "moreover , there is a smallest distance to this origin , in the sense that the particle can not be localized in a region of spacetime that is closer than one planck length from the origin .",
    "another peculiar effect is that spacetime has an inherent orientation . at the classical level",
    ", this shows up in the poisson brackets of the position coordinates , which involves a levi civita symbol . at the quantum level",
    ", it manifests itself in the fact that , if we try to localize the particle in a small region , then we have to give it a certain angular momentum as well , which has to point into a fixed direction .",
    "both the distinguished origin of spacetime and its orientation can be considered as parameters of the theory that have to be determined `` by experiments '' .",
    "they can take any value , but it is not possible to remove them completely .",
    "the dynamics of the particle can be described by a mass shell constraint , which is very similar to that of a relativistic point particle . at the quantum level , it becomes a kind of klein gordon equation , which is however not a second order differential equation , but a second order difference equation .",
    "this is due to the discretization of time , which implies that the time evolution equation has to be a step equation . in the limit where the planck length goes to zero",
    ", it becomes the usual klein gordon equation .",
    "this is actually true for everything derived from the reduced phase space structure .",
    "if we insert the correct physical units , and then switch off the gravitation by making the planck length ( or newtons constant ) small , we recover the usual description of a relativistic point particle .",
    "all these unfamiliar effects can therefore be thought of as gravitational corrections to the relativistic point particle and its quantization , and they result from the combination of quantum mechanics and general relativity .",
    "we are aware that this is just a one particle model and the hope is that in a more sophisticated , multi particle model , some of the details will become somewhat clearer .",
    "for example , the origin of spacetime might be removed and the absolute position vector of the particle , refering to this origin , be replaced by the relative position between two particles .",
    "the shortest distance would then act as a natural cutoff of the theory .",
    "some progress has been made towards this goal at the level of the classical phase space @xcite , and a simple model has been worked out in the quantum case @xcite , but a full understanding is still lacking .",
    "for the purpose of this article , it is most convenient to use the dreibein representation of einstein gravity .",
    "the basic field variables are then the dreibein @xmath8 and the @xmath9 spin connection @xmath10 . here , greek indices @xmath11 are tangent indices of the spacetime manifold @xmath12 , and latin indices @xmath13 , taking the values @xmath14 , are three dimensional minkowski space indices , transforming under the vector representation of the lorentz group @xmath15 . they are raised and lowered by the metric @xmath16 , and the levi - civita symbol @xmath17 is defined such that @xmath18 .    a brief introduction into notations and conventions , the structure of the lorentz group",
    ", its spinor representation @xmath0 , and the associated lie algebras is given in [ lorentz ] .",
    "a special feature of the three dimensional lorentz algebra is that it is , as a vector space , isomorphic to minkowski space itself , and thus the vector representation of the lorentz algebra is equivalent to its adjoint representation .",
    "we can use this to convert the dreibein as well as the spin connection into @xmath5 valued one - forms , defined by _",
    "= e_ _ a , _ = 14 _ ab ^a ^b . the gamma matrices are those introduced in , and bold letters are used to denote @xmath19 matrices . as a general convention",
    ", we shall always use the same symbols , either with vector indices attached or in bold face , to denote the same physical quantity in different representations .",
    "the dreibein can be considered as a map from the tangent bundle of the spacetime manifold @xmath12 into a minkowski space , or @xmath5 bundle over @xmath12 .",
    "a tangent vector @xmath20 at some point @xmath21 is mapped onto a vector @xmath22 in a `` local lorentz frame '' , or simply a `` local frame '' at @xmath23 .",
    "the scalar product of two such vectors is given by 12 = 12 ^ ^ = g _",
    "^ ^. this defines the spacetime metric @xmath24 , which is required to be invertible .",
    "equivalently , the dreibein determinant has to be non - zero , and without loss of generality we can restrict it to be positive , = 112 ^ > 0 .",
    "this condition implies that the dreibein provides an isomorphism between the tangent bundle of @xmath12 and the local frame bundle .",
    "so , in order to get an invertible metric , the latter has to be isomorphic to the tangent bundle of the given manifold @xmath12 .",
    "we shall see that , for our special model , the tangent bundle of the spacetime manifold is trivial .",
    "let us therefore in the following assume that this is the case .",
    "the bundle of local frames is then also trivial , and we can consider the dreibein as an @xmath5 valued one - form on @xmath12 .",
    "the same holds for the spin connection , which defines the covariant derivative of vectors in the local frames , _",
    "= _ + [ _ , ] . from this",
    ", we derive the following useful quantities .",
    "the field strength is defined by [ _ , _ ] = [ _ , ] _",
    "= _ _ - _ _ + [ _ , _ ] . moreover , given a curve in @xmath12 , connecting two points @xmath23 and @xmath25",
    ", we define the `` transport operator '' ( x , y ) = xy s _ s , where @xmath26 is the pullback of @xmath27 on the curve .",
    "the path ordering is such that factors corresponding to lower parameters @xmath28 , that is , closer to @xmath23 , appear to the left .",
    "the matrix @xmath29 describes the parallel transport from the local frame at @xmath23 along the given curve into the local frame at @xmath25 .",
    "a vector @xmath30 is mapped onto @xmath31 , where @xmath32 .",
    "note that , at this point , it is important that the tangent bundle of @xmath12 is trivial . otherwise we had to introduce transition functions into the definition , whenever the curve enters a new coordinate chart .    under a lorentz transformations of the local frames , parametrized by an @xmath0 valued field",
    "@xmath33 , a vector in the local frame at @xmath23 transforms as @xmath34 . for the dreibein and the spin connection",
    ", we have _ ^-1 _ , _ ^-1 ( _ + _ ) .",
    "the metric is invariant , and the transport operator transforms as ( x , y ) ^-1(x ) ( x , y ) ( y ) .",
    "such transformations will be considered as gauge symmetries .",
    "they are however not the most general transformations that leave the metric @xmath24 invariant . a priori",
    ", the invariance group of the metric is @xmath35 . due to the determinant condition",
    ", the symmetry is reduced to @xmath15 . however , only covers its connected component @xmath36 consisting of time oriented proper lorentz transformations , of which the spinor representation @xmath0 is a two - fold covering .",
    "if we only consider this as the gauge group , then the dreibein contains more physical information than the metric . this extra `` bit '' of information",
    "has to do with the time orientation of spacetime .",
    "we can use the dreibein to distinguish between the future and the past of a point in @xmath12 . a timelike or lightlike vector @xmath37 points towards the future , if its image in the local frame @xmath38 is causal , that is , positive timelike or lightlike .",
    "this defines a global time orientation of spacetime , which is invariant under gauge transformations of the type",
    ".    the definition of the time orientation of spacetime by the dreibein will be quite useful in the adm formalism , which we are going to use for the hamiltonian formulation and quantization of our model .",
    "spacetime is then decomposed into @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is some two dimensional space manifold , and @xmath41 is a time coordinate .",
    "this time coordinate should point into the same direction as the physical time . if the surface @xmath40 is spacelike , and the dreibein determinant is positive , then this is equivalent to the statement that the normal vector of the adm surface , which is given by @xmath42 , is negative timelike",
    ". we shall refer to this as the `` adm condition '' .",
    "the einstein equations in the dreibein formalism can most conveniently be derived from the first order , palatini type einstein hilbert action ^3x ^ .",
    "the dreibein @xmath43 has the dimension of length , and the field strength @xmath44 is dimensionless , so newtons constant @xmath3 must have the dimension of an inverse energy , or inverse mass .",
    "this explains why there is a natural mass scale in three dimensional gravity .",
    "the vacuum einstein equations derived from this action , and these are in fact the only ones we need , are the `` torsion equation '' stating that the dreibein is covariantly constant , and the `` curvature equation '' requiring the field strength of the spin connection to vanish , ^ _ _ = 0 , ^ _",
    "together they imply that the metric is flat , which means that there are no local gravitational degrees of freedom in the theory .",
    "in particular , gravitational waves can not exist , and there is no gravitational force . nevertheless ,",
    "if we insert matter into the universe , there will be effects that very much look like gravitational attraction or scattering .",
    "the general solution to the vacuum einstein equations is well known @xcite . within a simply connected region @xmath45",

    "= 12 , = 112 ^ , and the transport operator for a curve that entirely lies inside @xmath48 is given by ( x , y ) = ^-1(x ) ( y ) . from these relations",
    "we infer the following physical interpretation for @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "the map @xmath47 provides an isometric embedding of @xmath48 into minkowski space .",
    "the metric on @xmath48 is equal to the metric induced by the embedding , and @xmath47 is locally one - to - one , provided that the determinant is positive , which is equal to the jacobian of @xmath47 .",
    "hence , every simply connected region of spacetime looks like a piece of minkowski space .",
    "there is also an interpretation for @xmath46 .",
    "consider the expression for the transport operator above .",
    "the parallel transport is independent of the path , and it is carried out in two steps .",
    "a vector ( or spinor ) in the local frame at @xmath23 is first mapped into a `` background frame '' by @xmath49 , and from this background frame it is then mapped into the local frame at @xmath25 by @xmath50 .",
    "the field @xmath46 identifies all the local frames inside @xmath48 with a single background frame , which is the one associated with the embedding minkowski space .",
    "so , we can say that the pair @xmath51 provides an embedding of the complete bundle of local frames over @xmath48 into minkowski space .",
    "every quantity , for example a vector @xmath30 in the local frame at @xmath23 , can be equivalently represented in the background frame as @xmath52 . to see that this is consistent , consider a local lorentz transformation . applying this to",
    ", we find that , .",
    "hence , the embedding of spacetime into minkowski space is not affected .",
    "the vector @xmath53 in the background frame is also unchanged , because under a local lorentz transformation we have @xmath54 .",
    "the background space is invariant under local lorentz transformations .",
    "but there is another symmetry group that naturally acts on it .",
    "the right hand sides of are invariant under rigid poincar transformations , ^-1 , ^-1 ( - ) , where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are _ constants_. an isometric embedding of a piece of flat spacetime into minkowski space is only determined up to such a transformation . if we think of the background space as a rest frame of some , say , external observer , then it is the location and the orientation of this observer that is changed by .",
    "the freedom to perform a rigid poincar transformation shows that the background frame , or the observer associated with it , has no particular physical meaning .",
    "it is just an auxiliary construction , which was used to write down the solutions to the vacuum einstein equations .",
    "if we parametrize these solutions by @xmath46 and @xmath47 , then the poincar transformations should be considered as gauge symmetries .",
    "this will change when we derive the action for the particle model in . in order to obtain a well defined action , we have at add an observer to the universe , which will essentially be described by such an embedding , and this observer will become a physical reality .",
    "that is , the action will explicitly depend on the fields @xmath46 and @xmath47 , so that the background frame is no longer a gauge degree of freedom .",
    "let us now turn to the description of a point particle . in three dimensional einstein gravity , spacetime in the neighbourhood of a massive , pointlike",
    "particle has the shape of a cone , with the particle sitting at the top .",
    "as already mentioned in the introduction , the deficit angle @xmath57 of the cone is related to the mass @xmath2 of the particle by @xmath1 . to obtain a dimensionless parameter @xmath2 , and to avoid unnecessary factors in the formulas , we set @xmath58 in the following , so that @xmath59 . in the neighbourhood of the world line of such a particle",
    ", we can introduce cylindrical coordinates @xmath60 , such that the metric becomes s^2 = - t^2 + r^2 + ( 1 - ) ^2 r^2 ^2 . here",
    ", we have @xmath61 , and the angular coordinate @xmath62 is periodic with a period of @xmath63 .",
    "the total angle of this conical singularity is @xmath64 , which is the ratio of the circumference and the radius of a small circle centered at @xmath65 .",
    "so , the deficit angle is indeed equal to @xmath66 .",
    "there are some special values for the mass which restrict the `` physically reasonable '' range of the parameter @xmath2 .",
    "first of all , the deficit angle of a cone can not be larger than @xmath63 , and thus the mass should not exceed @xmath67 .",
    "in fact , we can restrict the parameter @xmath2 in to be less than or equal to @xmath67 , without loss of generality , because replacing @xmath2 with @xmath68 does not affect the metric .",
    "on the other hand , the mass of the particle should also be non - negative .",
    "the allowed range for the parameter @xmath2 is therefore @xmath69 .    to see that negative masses lead to `` unphysical '' situations , consider the metric for @xmath70 . in this case , the total angle of the conical singularity is larger than @xmath63 .",
    "this implies that there is negative curvature , and thus a negative energy density at the top of the cone . as a consequence ,",
    "the particle is gravitationally repulsive .",
    "two parallel geodesics , interpreted as test particles , passing the particle on opposite sides , are bent away from each other after they have passed the singularity . in other words , they are repelled from the matter source .    another question is whether we should include the bounds @xmath71 and @xmath67 into the range of @xmath2 or not . if we consider the metric given above , then both cases are somewhat problematic . for @xmath72 , we recover flat minkowski space , and the particle disappears completely . for @xmath73 ,",
    "the metric becomes singular and the cone degenerates to a line .",
    "however , in both cases , this is only due to the special coordinate system .",
    "it describes the particle in its own rest frame .",
    "we should expect that , for @xmath72 , the world line of the particle becomes lightlike , so that a rest frame no longer exist .",
    "this will in fact be the case , and , quite surprisingly , the same will happen at the upper bound @xmath73 .    for a proper description of a pointlike particle within the framework of matter",
    "coupled einstein gravity as a field theory , we somehow have to get rid of the curvature singularity at @xmath65 .",
    "there are basically two known ways to deal with this problem .",
    "the first possibility is to introduce a _ puncture_. that is , one excludes the world line of the particle from the spacetime manifold .",
    "the metric is then regular everywhere on the remaining manifold , and the particle is described by an appropriate set of boundary conditions imposed on the fields in the neighbourhood of the puncture .",
    "the second possibility is to _ regularize _ the matter source , for example by replacing the pointlike particle by some , sufficiently smooth , cylindrical matter source centered around the world line",
    ". then one does not need to impose boundary conditions , but instead one has to deal with more complicated , matter coupled einstein equations , and in the end one has to take a limit where the radius of the cylinder shrinks to zero .    here",
    "we shall use a new method which is somehow a mixture of these , and which makes as much as possible use of the advantages of both methods .",
    "it has in common with the puncture method that it essentially converts the matter degrees of freedom carried by the particle into topological degrees of freedom of the gravitational field , associated with a non - contractible loop that surrounds the puncture . on the other hand",
    ", it also works somewhat like the second method .",
    "the world line of the particle is smeared out , in a way which is sufficient to remove the singularity .",
    "it is however not necessary to take any kind of limit to remove the regularization . in particular",
    ", the metric in the neighbourhood of the world line will not be affected by the regularization .",
    "the basic idea is quite simple .",
    "consider the covariant metric given by . as it stands , it is not immediately obvious that there is a singularity",
    ". it is given as a smooth function of the coordinates @xmath60 and their differentials .",
    "the _ curvature _ singularity can not be seen because there is also a _ coordinate _ singularity at @xmath65 .",
    "to get rid of the curvature singularity , it might be sufficient to remove the coordinate singularity .",
    "this can be done , by changing the topology of spacetime . instead of interpreting the cylindrical coordinates in the usual way",
    ", we do not identify the points with different @xmath62 at @xmath65 . as a result , spacetime is no longer an @xmath74 , but a manifold with a _ cylindrical boundary_. this boundary represents the world line of the particle , which is thus , in a sense , smeared out .",
    "but there is also a non - contractible loop surrounding the particle , so that topological degrees of freedom of the gravitational field can arise .    on the modified spacetime manifold ,",
    "it is now rather obvious that the metric becomes a smooth second rank tensor .",
    "the coordinate system @xmath60 is everywhere regular .",
    "the pullback of the metric on the boundary , where @xmath75 are the standard coordinates on a cylinder , is given by @xmath76 .",
    "so , the only problem is that the metric is singular on the boundary .",
    "it is of rank one instead of two , which is the dimension of the boundary .",
    "this reflects the fact that the _ two dimensional _ cylindrical boundary actually looks like a _ one dimensional _ world line of a particle . in the dreibein formulation of gravity , exactly these kinds of singular metrics can be consistently included",
    ". a possible dreibein representation of is given by _",
    "t = _ 0 , _",
    "r = _ 1 + _ 2 , _ = ( 1 - ) r ( _ 2 - _ 1 ) .",
    "it is chosen such that the determinant is positive , the adm condition holds ( with @xmath77 ) , and the spin connection takes the simplest possible form , _",
    ". obviously , all these fields are smooth , and they provide a solution to the _ vacuum _ einstein equations on the modified spacetime manifold .",
    "the curvature singularity is completely removed , although the ( smeared ) world line of the particle is still included in the spacetime manifold .",
    "we can summarize this as follows . a suitable way to include point particles into the dreibein formulation of gravity",
    "is to consider their world lines as cylindrical boundaries of spacetime .",
    "as we are , within this article , only interested in a universe containing exactly one such particle , we can fix the spacetime manifold to be @xmath78 .",
    "the cylindrical coordinates @xmath60 then form a global coordinate system on @xmath12 .",
    "it is also easy to see that @xmath12 satisfies the assumption made in the previous section , namely , that its tangent bundle is trivial .",
    "the only transition function , arising due to the identification @xmath79 , is the identity .",
    "the only necessary modification to the definition of dreibein gravity in the previous section is that we have to weaken the determinant and adm conditions sightly . to allow singular metrics on the boundary",
    ", we have to require @xmath80 in the _ interior _ of @xmath40 only .",
    "the metric can then be of a lower rank on the boundary , and it will in fact be forced to be of rank one by the field equations .",
    "the same also holds for the adm condition , saying that the normal vector of the hypersurfaces of constant time coordinate should be negative timelike . for",
    ", this vector vanishes on the boundary as well , so that the adm condition also applies in the interior of @xmath40 only .",
    "the vacuum einstein equations are not sufficient to make the boundary of @xmath12 look like a world line of a point particle with a given mass .",
    "we need some additional field equations on the boundary .",
    "one of them has to ensure that the metric on the boundary is of rank one , so that it looks like a line",
    ". we shall refer to this as the `` point particle condition '' .",
    "let us first deal with this , and then return to the mass of the particle later on .",
    "if we want a cylinder to look like a line , then its circumference has to vanish .",
    "this means that all @xmath62-components of the covariant metric have to vanish at @xmath65 , or , equivalently , |_= 0 . here",
    ", the bar is used to denote the value of a field on the boundary .",
    "obviously , the dreibein satisfies this condition .",
    "but what is the general solution to and the einstein equations ? for the vacuum einstein equations , we know this already . inside a simply connected region , it is given by an embedding @xmath51 of spacetime into minkowski space .",
    "now , the neighbourhood of the particle is not simply connected , but we can cover it by a simply connected region . if we introduce a cut along , say , the plane at @xmath81 ( see ) , then we can write the general solution to the einstein equations in the neighbourhood of the boundary as in ,",

    "their values at @xmath81 , denoted by @xmath85 and @xmath86 , are not independent .",
    "they need not be equal , but the one - forms @xmath43 and @xmath27 must be continuous , which means that the right hand sides of at @xmath87 must coincide with those at @xmath88 .",
    "we saw that this is the case if and only if the fields @xmath46 and @xmath47 are related by a poincar transformation .",

    "now , @xmath93 and @xmath94 are constants , and therefore the time derivative of this equation implies that the time derivative of @xmath95 must commute with @xmath93 . all vectors that commute with a given group element @xmath89 are proportional to its `` projection '' @xmath96 into the algebra ( see ) .",
    "this vector @xmath97 is also the `` axis '' of the lorentz transformation represented by @xmath93 .",
    "it can be obtained by expanding the matrix @xmath93 in terms of the unit and gamma matrices , and then dropping the contribution proportional to the unit matrix , = + _ a ^a = _ a ^a .",
    "taking all this together , we find that the most general function @xmath47 is , on the boundary , of the form |(t , ) = + ( t ) , where @xmath98 is some constant and @xmath99 is an arbitrary real function of time .",
    "obviously , this reminds of the description of a relativistic point particle in minkowski space .",
    "the particle has a momentum @xmath97 , and it passes through the point @xmath100 . indeed , with the interpretation of @xmath47 as an embedding of spacetime into minkowski space , @xmath101 is the position of the particle in this background space .",
    "if it is considered as the rest frame of an external observer , then he sees the particle moving along the world line .",
    "the arbitrary function @xmath102 has physical interpretation as well .",
    "consider the time component of the dreibein on the boundary , |_t = |^-1 _ t | |= _ t |^-1 | .",
    "it represents the tangent vector of the world line , or the velocity of the particle , in the local frames on the boundary .",
    "its length is given by = | _ t | , and this is the quotient of the physical time elapsing on the world line divided by the coordinate time .",
    "the function @xmath99 is thus , up to a factor , the eigentime of the particle .    to see that the vector @xmath97 , or rather the group element @xmath93 from which it is derived , behaves very much like the momentum of a relativistic point particle , let us now , before we come back to the solution of the field equations in the neighbourhood of the particle , consider the second boundary condition to be imposed",
    "so far , we havent fixed the mass of the particle .",
    "it should be related to the deficit angle by @xmath59 , and , like the point particle condition , we want to write this `` mass shell condition '' as a local field equation , that is , it should involve the fields on the boundary only .    at first sight , it is not so obvious how this can be achieved , because the deficit angle , defined as the missing circumference of a small circle , is a property of the metric _ in the neighbourhood _ of the particle .",
    "however , if we slightly change the definition of the mass , we can express it as a function of the spin connection _ on the boundary_. the idea is that , instead of measuring the radius and circumference of a circle , we can also perform a parallel transport of a vector ( or spinor ) around the particle .",
    "if the deficit angle is @xmath66 , then the result should be that the vector is rotated by @xmath66 .",
    "the parallel transport along a given curve is described by the transport operator .",
    "provided that the curvature vanishes , this is invariant under smooth deformations of the curve .",
    "if we are interested in the effect of transporting a vector or spinor around the particle , we can , in particular , perform this transport on the boundary .",
    "let us therefore define an @xmath0 valued field @xmath103 , which describes the transport of a spinor once around the boundary , on a circle of constant @xmath83 , starting and ending at the point @xmath62 . for later convenience ,",
    "we choose the `` clockwise '' , that is , negative @xmath62 direction .",
    "the `` holonomy '' of the particle is then given by |^-1(t , ) = |_(t , ) .",
    "independently of whether the spin connection is flat or not , this is a well defined field on the boundary .",
    "it is , by definition , covariantly constant with respect to @xmath62 , _",
    "|= _ |+ [ |_,| ] = 0 , but there is , a priori , no relation between the values of @xmath104 at different times @xmath83 .",
    "we can therefore think of @xmath104 as a function on the world line of the particle , which `` essentially '' depends on @xmath83 only .",
    "the dependence of @xmath104 on @xmath62 is only due to the fact that the same physical quantity is represented in different local frames on the boundary .    if the einstein equations are satisfied , then @xmath104 is covariantly constant with respect to @xmath83 as well .",
    "the physical quantity represented by @xmath104 is thus a constant of motion .",
    "it is in fact the same as the constant @xmath93 introduced above , which we interpreted as the _ momentum _ of the particle .",
    "the relation between @xmath104 and @xmath93 , or that between their projections @xmath97 and @xmath105 , is found to be |= |^-1 | ,   = = - .",
    "this is not the same as .",
    "the two particles can be distinguished physically , by transporting a spinor around them .",
    "the resulting spinors will differ by an overall sign .",
    "the second particle is , using the terminology of the previous section , an _ antiparticle _ with mass @xmath106 .",
    "we have seen that this has the same deficit angle as a particle with mass @xmath2 , so that the metric in the neighbourhood is the same .    from this we conclude , and this will be rather important later on , that the whole physical information about the particle is encoded in the _ spinor _ representation of the holonomy @xmath107 .",
    "it is not sufficient to consider the vector representation , because then we can not distinguish between particles and antiparticles .",
    "but on the other hand , it is also not appropriate to consider its representation in any `` higher '' covering of @xmath0 as a physical quantity .",
    "this would no longer be invariant under general local lorentz transformations , because the last equality in no longer holds .",
    "this is why @xmath0 will become to the `` momentum space '' of the particle in the next section , and not a covering thereof .",
    "when quantizing a gauge theory , there are two roads between which one has to choose .",
    "either one can quantize the full theory , including gauge degrees of freedom , and use operator constraint equations on the hilbert space , or one can divide out the gauge degrees of freedom at the classical level , and then quantize . in the case of a topological field theory ,",
    "the number of physical degrees of freedom that remain after such a phase space reduction is finite , and therefore it is more convenient to first reduce and then quantize .",
    "this is the road we will follow in this article .",
    "we shall however , in a first step , not divide out all gauge symmetries .",
    "instead , we only consider those that are generated by the `` kinematical '' constraints , ^ij _ ij = 0 , ^ij _",
    "i_j = 0 , |_= 0 .",
    "if we do so , then there is only one constraint left , the mass shell constraint , and this will become a `` dynamical '' constraint , in the sense that it generates the time evolution of the particle seen by the observer at infinity . the resulting _ reduced phase space _",
    "@xmath108 will , strictly speaking , only be a partially reduced phase space , but it will already be finite dimensional .    with the preparation made in the previous section ,",
    "the actual phase space reduction is quite simple .",
    "the first thing we need is an appropriate set of coordinates on the `` constraint surface '' , which is defined by as a subset of the extended phase space @xmath109 .",
    "this is not very complicated .",
    "all we need to do is to take the embedding of spatial infinity @xmath51 , and extend it to the whole space manifold , such that , everywhere on @xmath40 , we have _",
    "i = ^-1 _ i , _",
    "i = ^-1 _ i .",
    "as we already found in , the point particle constraint implies that @xmath47 is constant on the particle boundary .",
    "there is thus a one - to - one relation between field configurations satisfying the kinematical constraints and embeddings of @xmath40 , cut along the radial line at @xmath81 , with the condition that @xmath110 is independent of @xmath62 .    using the variables @xmath46 and @xmath47 as coordinates",
    ", we can compute the pullback of the symplectic form @xmath111 on the constraint surface .",
    "it is actually simpler to first compute the pullback of the symplectic potential @xmath112 , and then use that @xmath113 .",
    "all we need to do is to insert into the expression for @xmath112 .",
    "thereby , we can use the following trick .",
    "we know that the full expression is independent of @xmath114 , provided that @xmath114 is large enough , which means that the fall off condition must hold .",
    "but now , this is fulfilled for any @xmath114 . in particular",
    ", we can take @xmath115 .",
    "doing so , the first integral vanishes because the integration range shrinks to a set of measure zero .",
    "the second integral also vanishes , because @xmath110 is constant and therefore @xmath116 at @xmath65 .",
    "only the last term remains , and there we can replace @xmath117 with @xmath95 , because this is now also evaluated at @xmath65 .",
    "all together , this gives = - 12 .",
    "the hamiltonian also takes a rather simple form .",
    "as all constraints except the mass shell constraint have been solved , this is the only term that remains , = ( 12 - ) . here",
    ", we also used the relation @xmath118 , to replace @xmath104 with @xmath93 .",
    "thus , the only variables that remain are @xmath119 and @xmath89 .",
    "these are the only `` observables '' , that is , the only quantities that are invariant under the gauge transformations generated by the kinematical constraints .",
    "we can also reexpress everything in terms of a reduced lagrangian , which only depends on these variables , = - 12 - ( 12 - ) . to check our calculations",
    ", we can rederive the equations of motion from this .",
    "of course , the multiplier @xmath120 still provides the correct mass shell condition . under a variation of @xmath95 , we get = 12 = 0 , and varying @xmath93 gives = 12 = 12 . here , we used @xmath121 , and @xmath122 . as a result",
    ", we find the evolution equations = 0 , = , which are in agreement with what we found in .",
    "in particular , the momentum @xmath93 is constant , and the world line of the particle in the embedding space is given by , with the evolution of the eigentime @xmath99 given by the multiplier @xmath120 .    the physical interpretation of the observables @xmath95 and @xmath93 is now also rather obvious .",
    "we found that the value of @xmath47 on the particle boundary was the position of the particle in the embedding minkowski space .",
    "this space is now identical with the reference frame of the observer at infinity , and therefore @xmath95 is the _ position _ of the particle , seen by this observer .",
    "similarly , @xmath93 , or its projection into the algebra @xmath97 , is the _ momentum _ of the particle , measured by the same observer .",
    "together they span the reduced phase space @xmath123",
    ".    we can now forget about the rather long derivation of reduced phase space @xmath108 from einstein gravity , and summarize the result as follows .",
    "the model effectively describes a point particle from the point of view of an external observer .",
    "it has many features in common with a relativistic point particle .",
    "the phase space @xmath108 is six dimensional , with the basic variables being the position and the momentum of the particle , and the physical subspace of @xmath108 is defined by a mass shell constraint .",
    "the dynamics of the particle will be described in the same way , namely as a gauge symmetry generated by the mass shell constraint .",
    "there is however one crucial difference .",
    "the phase space @xmath108 is not a six dimensional vector space , but the product of a group manifold with its lie algebra , which is the same as the cotangent bundle of the group manifold , @xmath124 .",
    "such phase spaces are well known .",
    "they typically appear as the phase spaces of , say , particles moving on a curved manifold , or field theories with curved target spaces .",
    "but here the situation is somewhat different .",
    "it is not the _ position _ variable that lives on the curved manifold , but the _ momentum _ , and this will lead to some very uncommon features of this model , especially in the quantum theory .",
    "many of these features can already be seen at the classical level , and most of them follow immediately from the poisson structure on @xmath108 . exploiting the cotangent space structure , it is more or less straightforward to derive the poisson bracket",
    ". let us expand the position variable @xmath95 in terms of the gamma matrices and rewrite the symplectic potential as = - 12 ^a .",
    "the one - form @xmath125 is the dual of the left invariant vector field @xmath126 on the group manifold , which is defined by _",
    "a = 12 _ a. it is therefore reasonable to assume that the action of @xmath127 under the poisson bracket is associated with this vector field . with this ansatz , and",
    "using the jacobi identity , it is not difficult to derive the basic poisson brackets , which turn out to be = ^a , = 2^ab_c ^c . an alternative way to derive this bracket , without using the cotangent space structure , is to consider the components @xmath128 and @xmath127 as independent variables , and insert the expansion @xmath129 , with @xmath130 , into the expression for the symplectic potential .",
    "it then becomes = - ^a _ a , ^a = ( ^ab + ^abc _ c - ^-1 ^a^b ) _ b. hence , it has the canonical form , and the brackets can then be derived from the condition = 0 , = _ ab , = 0 . the result is = _ ab + _ abc _ c , = ^b .",
    "this also follows from , by taking taking the trace or projecting it onto the gamma matrices , and vice versa it implies that @xmath127 acts on @xmath93 by right multiplication with @xmath131 . as a `` proof '' , we rederive the time evolution equations from the hamiltonian , = = 0 , ^a = = 12 = ^a . as @xmath120 is a free parameter",
    ", this is actually a gauge transformation , generated by the mass shell constraint . once again , this is the same situation as for the relativistic point particle .",
    "it is also the reason why we did not divide out all gauge symmetries from the very beginning .",
    "we want to keep the remaining gauge freedom when we quantize the model , because we can then easily compare the result to the quantized relativistic point particle .    before coming to this",
    ", we shall however stick to the classical description for a moment and see what the basic _ physical _ properties of the reduced phase space @xmath108 are .",
    "the most apparent feature of the poisson algebra is of course that the components @xmath127 of the position of the particle have non - vanishing brackets .",
    "the fact that the corresponding quantum operators do not commute will have profound consequences for the quantum theory .",
    "for example , they add another uncertainty relation to the quantum mechanics , which implies that the particle can not be localized",
    ".    we should emphasize that this `` non - commutativity of spacetime '' is not the result of any choice .",
    "the interpretation of the `` observable '' @xmath95 as the position of the particle with respect to the observer at infinity is forced upon us , as a consequence of the definitions made at the _ field theoretical _ level in the beginning . at this point ,",
    "the description of the particle was completely independent from that of the observer .",
    "the only connection between them was the gravitational field , and its dynamics is described by the einstein hilbert action .",
    "so , the fact that the position coordinates do not commute turns out to be an effect of einstein gravity .",
    "the last issues we want to investigate at the classical level are the symmetries and their noether charges .",
    "a transformation is a symmetry if the lagrangian is invariant up to a total time derivative .",
    "if this is the case , then the symmetry is realized on phase space as a canonical transformation , and we should find the associated noether charge that generates the symmetry via the poisson bracket .",
    "as a symmetry also leaves the hamiltonian invariant , which in this case means that its generator commutes with the mass shell constraint , it represents an observable of the system .",
    "the algebra of the noether charges is therefore simultaneously the observable algebra , which will play a central role in the quantum theory .",
    "let us first consider lorentz transformations .",
    "it is easily checked that the reduced lagrangian is invariant under ^-1 , ^-1 , where @xmath55 is a constant . at the extended phase space level",
    ", this corresponds to a ridig lorentz transformation of the embedding minkowski space at spatial infinity .",
    "infinitesimally , the transformation can be written as = 12^a [ , _ a ] , = 12^a [ , _ a ] . to find the noether charge corresponding to this symmetry",
    ", we need a function @xmath132 satisfying = 12 [ , _ a ] , = 12 [ , _ a ] .",
    "the action of @xmath132 on @xmath93 is the sum of the left and right invariant vector fields , defined by _ a = 12 _ a , _ a = - 12 _ a .",
    "they form two commuting copies of an @xmath9 lie algebra , [ _ a , _ b ] = _ ab _ c , [ _ a , _ b ] = _ ab _ c , [ _ a , _ b ] = 0 . moreover ,",
    "the right invariant vector fields can be written as @xmath133 , where @xmath134 is the vector representation of @xmath93 ( see ) . using this , it is not difficult to identify the angular momentum as _ a = 12 ( _ ab _ b - _ a ) .",
    "as expected , its components form an @xmath9 algebra under the poisson bracket , = -_ab _ c. if we write it as a matrix , we find that the angular momentum is , up to a factor , the same as the parameter @xmath94 appearing in the boundary condition , which is related to the position and momentum of the particle by , ^a _ a = 12 ( ^a_b ^b - ^a ) _ a = 12 ( ^-1 - ) = - 12",
    ". we can also express @xmath132 as a function of the components of the position and the momentum vector .",
    "it then becomes _ a = _ abc ^b ^c + 2 _ [ a _ b ] ^b . this expression is different from what one would expect naively , namely @xmath135 . only in the `` low momentum '' limit , where @xmath128 is small compared to @xmath136 , it reduces to the standard expression .",
    "if we look at the action of @xmath132 and @xmath137 on @xmath93 , we find that there is a remarkable similarity .",
    "if @xmath138 is some function on @xmath0 , then we have = - 2_a f , = ( _ a+_a ) f. the left and right invariant vector fields @xmath126 and @xmath139 span an @xmath140 lie algebra .",
    "this is the symmetry algebra of anti - de - sitter space .",
    "indeed , at least locally , our momentum space looks like anti - de - sitter space .",
    "if we use the coordinates @xmath141 , then they obey _ a _",
    "b ^ab = -1 , ^ab=(-1,1,1,-1 ) .",
    "hence , it is the unit hyperboloid in @xmath142 , and its isometries are generated by the vector fields _ ab = 12 ( _ a - _ b ) . if we split them into _ ab = 12 ( _ a - _ b ) , _ a = 12 ( + _ a ) , then it is not difficult to verify that = -2 _ a f - _ abc _ bc f , = _ abc _ bc f , where @xmath138 is considered as a function of the components @xmath143 .",
    "hence , @xmath137 and @xmath132 generate the isometries of momentum space .",
    "this is again analogous to the relativistic point particle .",
    "there , the momentum space is minkowski space , its isometry group is @xmath144 , and the components of the position and angular momentum vectors are the generators of translations and lorentz transformations .",
    "here , the situation is exactly the same , except that the isometry group of momentum space is @xmath145 .",
    "this is the reason why the algebra of the position and angular momentum components is different .",
    "the idea of momentum space being anti - de - sitter is actually not new .",
    "it was proposed in 1946 ( ! ) by snyder in the context of relativistic point particles in 3 + 1  dimensions @xcite .",
    "he realized that this implies that the components of the position vector of a particle can no longer commute with each other .",
    "quite remarkably , it also introduces a shortest distance into the quantum theory , without breaking the lorentz symmetry , as it typically happens when a lattice structure is introduced on spacetime . in other words , it is possible to introduce a cutoff in spacetime in a covariant way . at the quantum level",
    ", we shall find that our model has all these features as well .",
    "so far , we considered the isometries of the _ momentum _ space .",
    "but what about those of the _ position _ space , or the _ spacetime _ in which the particle lives . as this is flat minkowski space , we should expect that there is an @xmath144 symmetry group , and using the analogy to the relativistic point particle , the symmetries should be generated by the components of the momentum @xmath128 and the angular momentum @xmath132 .",
    "indeed , these quantities form a poincar algebra , = 0 , = - _ ab _ c , = - _ ab _",
    "c. we know already that @xmath132 is the noether charge associated with lorentz transformations .",
    "so , we should expect that @xmath128 is the generator of a translation of the particle .",
    "let us contract the momentum with an arbitrary vector @xmath146 , and compute the bracket with the position coordinate .",
    "what we get is = ^a - ^abc _ b_c .",
    "as the @xmath147 s themselves have vanishing brackets with each other , we can easily exponentiate this transformation , and write down the action of the symmetry on the basic phase space variables , parametrized by a vector @xmath148 , , + + [ , ] . this does not look like an ordinary translation @xmath149 .",
    "maybe the reason for this is that the components of the momentum @xmath97 are just not the correct generators . to see that this is not the case ,",
    "consider the transformation of the lagrangian under an ordinary translation .",
    "it is given by - 12 , and this is not a total time derivative .",
    "so , the ordinary translations are _ not _ symmetries of the action .",
    "one can also easily see that the poisson bracket is not invariant under ordinary translations .",
    "but the deformed translations are canonical transformations , and the lagrangian is invariant . only in the low momentum limit , where we can neglect the last term in and set @xmath136",
    ", the deformed translations tend to the usual ones .",
    "let us close the classical part with this somewhat peculiar observation .",
    "the model that we derived is , for large momenta , not invariant under ordinary translations , although the position of the particle lives in flat minkowski space .",
    "there is however , and maybe this is even more remarkable , still a poincar group of canonical transformations acting on the phase space , which is generated by the components of the momentum and angular momentum .",
    "it is thus not the isometry group itself that is `` deformed '' , but only its action on the phase space variables . under a translation ,",
    "the particle is not shifted into the direction of the translation , but it receives an additional shift into a direction determined by its momentum . at the quantum level , this absence of the ordinary translational symmetry will show up even more drastically .",
    "we now want to go over to a quantum description of the point particle , based on the classical reduced phase space formulation .",
    "we shall first consider the quantization of the phase space @xmath108 itself , without imposing the mass shell condition .",
    "the philosophy behind this is that we would first like to study the quantum spacetime on which the particle lives . typical questions that we would like to answer are :    * what is the spectrum of the operators @xmath137 , @xmath128 , and @xmath132 ? * how are the uncertainty relations modified ? * does a shortest length scale show up in the model ?",
    "later we will consider the dynamics of the particle by imposing the mass shell constraint , which translates into a kind of klein gordon equation , or even a schrdinger like time evolution equation .",
    "we have seen in the previous sections that the phase space @xmath108 is the cotangent bundle @xmath6 , or @xmath150 . a point in that space",
    "was represented by a pair @xmath151 , where @xmath89 is the momentum and @xmath119 the position of the particle .",
    "the most remarkable feature of the poisson structure on @xmath108 was that the components of @xmath95 , and hence the coordinates of the particle , do not commute .",
    "this implies that we can not represent quantum states as wave functions in spacetime .",
    "we can however set up a momentum representation in which the wave function depends on @xmath93 .    from the mathematical point of view , this is the most natural way to quantize the given phase space , which is the cotangent bundle of the momentum space .",
    "hence , we take as our hilbert space @xmath152 , where @xmath153 is the haar measure .",
    "a state @xmath154 is then represented by a wave function @xmath155 . using the bra - ket notation , we can write @xmath156 , where @xmath157 are the momentum eigenstates , @xmath158 . they are orthonormal and complete , = ( _ 1_2 ) , = 1 . using this ,",
    "we can write the scalar product and the expansion in terms of a wave function as = ^ * ( ) ( ) , = ( ) . to define an operator representation for phase space functions , we demand that real functions should be represented by hermitian operators , and that for the basic variables we have ab = c ab = -i c. in particular , we want that = - _ a = i _",
    "a. from this we infer that @xmath137 has to act on the basis states as _ a = - 2i _ a , where the @xmath159 are the left invariant vector fields acting on @xmath93 , as defined in .",
    "the haar measure is invariant under the action of the left and right invariant vector fields , so that the operator @xmath137 is hermitian .",
    "similarly , we can derive the operator for the angular momentum from = 12[,_a ] = -12 i ( _ a - _ a ) , which gives _ a = i ( _ a+_a ) .",
    "clearly , this is again hermitian .",
    "we can express it in terms of @xmath127 and @xmath93 as i(_a + _ a ) = i(_a - _",
    "ab_b ) = 12 ( _ ab _ b - _ a ) , which is the same as the classical expression .",
    "there are no ordering ambiguities , because @xmath160=0 $ ] .",
    "to derive the spectrum of the operators @xmath137 , @xmath128 , and @xmath132 , we have to make things a bit more explicit . for this purpose , we switch to a slightly different representation . actually , we only change the naming of the basis states . instead of using the matrix @xmath93 to label the state @xmath161",
    ", we use the euler angles as coordinates on the group manifold .",
    "the state @xmath162 is then the same as @xmath163 , where = .",
    "the periodicity of the coordinates can then be expressed in the relations = = . to write down the scalar product and the wave function expansion ,",
    "we need the haar measure in terms of these coordinates , which is given by = ( 2 ) hence , we have = ( 2 ) ( , , ) , and the scalar products of two such states is given by = ( 2 ) ^ * ( , , ) ( , , ) .",
    "of course , the states @xmath162 are still momentum eigenstates , and the eigenvalues are given by , _ 1 , ^0 , _ 2 .",
    "now , let us consider the @xmath71-components of the position and the angular momentum operator . physically , these correspond to the time @xmath164 and the spatial angular momentum @xmath165 , which is the momentum associated with spatial rotations . to find their action on the basis states , we can use that = ( ^0 - ^0 ) , = ( ^0 + ^0 ) . from this",
    "we infer that = i ( - ) , = i .",
    "the eigenstates of these operators are then easily found to be = ( 2 ) ( ) , where @xmath166 is an arbitrary function that depends on @xmath167 only .",
    "the eigenvalues are = , = . both quantum numbers @xmath168 and @xmath169 have to be integers , because both @xmath170 and @xmath171 have a period of @xmath63 . for the spatial angular momentum @xmath172 , this is of course what we should expect .",
    "it is quantized in units of @xmath173 .",
    "the quantization of the eigenvalues of @xmath174 is however more interesting .",
    "it implies that time is quantized .",
    "it only takes values which are integer multiples of @xmath173 . in our units with @xmath175 ,",
    "@xmath173 also has the dimension of a length or time .",
    "we define this to be the planck length , @xmath176 , and use the symbol @xmath177 in the following instead of @xmath173 whenever it appears as a length or time scale .",
    "besides the discreteness , there is another peculiar feature of the spectrum of @xmath174 .",
    "it starts at @xmath178 , and not , say , at @xmath179 or @xmath180 .",
    "what is so special about the integer values of @xmath168 ?",
    "the answer is that there is actually nothing special .",
    "the origin of the spectrum is due to an ambiguity in the definition of the hilbert space , or rather the operator representation introduced above , which we ignored so far .",
    "the classical phase space is not simply connected . as a result , there is an phase ambiguity in the definition of the basis states @xmath162 .",
    "they have to be periodic in @xmath170 .",
    "however , instead of , it is sufficient ro require = , for some real number @xmath99 .",
    "doing so , it is not difficult to see that the spectrum of @xmath174 is shifted and becomes @xmath181 , instead of @xmath182 .",
    "we can shift it wherever we like by choosing a suitable `` quantization parameter '' @xmath99 .",
    "but the time steps will always have the same size @xmath177 . for simplicity",
    ", we shall restrict to @xmath183 .",
    "although the details of the `` spectrum of spacetime '' to be derived in the following depend on @xmath99 , the _ qualitative _ behaviour will always be the same , and this is what we are mainly interested in .    to derive something like a position representation for the particle , we should try to diagonalize as many @xmath184-variables as possible .",
    "we can not diagonalize all three components , because they do not commute .",
    "but we can at least achieve to find eigenstates of two functions thereof .",
    "in fact , there is an obvious second function that commutes with @xmath164 , and can be diagonalized simultaneously .",
    "as the position operators obey an algebra that is similar to the euclidean angular momentum algebra , it is not surprising that this is the `` casimir '' @xmath185 .",
    "it is invariant under lorentz transformations , so it also commutes with @xmath165 , and we can stick to the quantum numbers @xmath168 and @xmath169 .",
    "on the @xmath93-eigenstates , the operator @xmath186 acts as = - 4 ^ 2 _ a ^a = - 4 ^ 2 , where @xmath187 is the laplace beltrami operator , which is equal to the square of the left ( or right ) invariant vector fields .",
    "this leads us to the harmonic analysis on @xmath0 . without going too deep into the mathematical details ,",
    "we give a brief derivation of the basic results in [ harmonic ] .",
    "they are summarized as follows .",
    "the eigenstates can be split into two classes , the continuous and the discrete series . for the continuous series",
    ", we have states labeled by a positive real quantum number @xmath188 , and the two integers @xmath168 and @xmath169 , such that = ( ^2 + 1 ) ^2 .",
    "the discrete series is labeled by another integer @xmath189 , and the eigenvalues are given by = - ( - 2 ) ^2 . here , the range of the quantum numbers @xmath168 , @xmath169 and @xmath189 are restricted as follows . for a fixed @xmath168 , the positive integer @xmath189 only takes finitely many values , namely 2 || , ( 2 )",
    "hence , for even @xmath168 we have @xmath190 , and @xmath191 for odd @xmath168 .",
    "there are no discrete states for @xmath168 equal to @xmath192 , @xmath71 , or @xmath193 .",
    "the values for @xmath169 are also restricted . for given @xmath168 and @xmath189",
    ", we must have -12(- ) 2 , 12(- ) -2 .",
    "now , observe that the continuous series has positive eigenvalues of @xmath186 , starting at @xmath194 .",
    "this corresponds to _ spacelike _ vectors @xmath127 .",
    "the discrete series has zero and negative eigenvalues and corresponds to _ lightlike _ or _ timelike _ vectors @xmath127 .",
    "we can illustrate the situation as follows . in a commutative spacetime",
    ", we could set up a position representation of the hilbert space , in which each point in spacetime corresponds to one basis state .",
    "here , we can no longer assign a basis state to every point in spacetime .",
    "we can only fix the values of @xmath195 and @xmath164 . alternatively",
    ", we may also use the quantity @xmath196 instead of @xmath186 .",
    "its spectrum is strictly positive , = ( ^2+^2 + 1)^2 , = ( ^2-(-2))^2 , and a fixed value of @xmath197 defines a _ circle _ in space .",
    "hence , we can not associate states with points in spacetime , but at least with circles , labeled by the time coordinate @xmath174 and the spatial radius squared @xmath197 .",
    "this reflects the fact that a state can not be localized in spacetime , due to the commutator relation and thus the uncertainty relation between the coordinates .    ' '' ''    a picture of this quantum spacetime is shown in .",
    "it shows a circle for each allowed value of @xmath197 and @xmath174 , for @xmath198 .",
    "we get discrete layers of states , corresponding to the discrete eigenvalues of @xmath174 . outside the light cone",
    ", we have the continuous spectrum of @xmath197 , starting at @xmath199 , a little bit off the light cone . on the light cone",
    ", we have the discrete lightlike states for @xmath200 , and inside the light cone the discrete timelike states which exist for @xmath201 . each ring in this picture corresponds to an infinite tower of states , labeled by the angular momentum quantum number @xmath169 . in the spacelike region , where the continuous set of rings forms a plane ,",
    "any value of @xmath169 is allowed . on the light cone and in the timelike region",
    ", @xmath169 has a lower limit . on the innermost rings , where @xmath202",
    ", @xmath169 must be positive or zero .",
    "the further we go away from the time axis towards the light cone , the more negative values are allowed for @xmath169 . in the past light cone , the situation is just the reverse .",
    "there , only negative @xmath169 are allowed on the innermost rings , and more and more positive ones are mixed in if we move towards the light cone .",
    "this semi discrete structure of spacetime is a consequence of the fact that the coordinates @xmath127 do not commute . in this sense , can be thought of as a picture of a non - commutative spacetime .",
    "there is also a new kind of uncertainty relation in the theory .",
    "it is impossible to determine any two of the three @xmath127 simultaneously with infinite precision .",
    "for example , we have = 2 i ^0 = 2i 2 .",
    "this tells us that it is not possible to find a state that is localized inside a spacelike circle with a radius smaller than @xmath203 .",
    "this is exactly the behaviour of the innermost rings in the timelike region of . the radius of the ring that is closest to the time axis , and therefore represents the `` most localized '' state at the time @xmath174 , grows with the square root of @xmath174 .",
    "note , however , that the only completely localized state that would be allowed by the uncertainty relation above , namely at the `` origin of spacetime '' @xmath204 , does not exist . for low values of @xmath174",
    "the uncertainty is therefore even stronger .",
    "we already saw at the classical level that the theory is not invariant under ordinary translations @xmath149 . at the quantum level , this can be seen in the spectrum of spacetime , which is far from being invariant under translations .",
    "the origin seems to play a special role , in the sense that it is the light cone emerging from _ this _ point that splits the spectrum into the discrete and the continuous series .",
    "the picture is also not invariant under lorentz transformations .",
    "however , this is only due to our choice of a special time axis and not of a physical nature .",
    "we have the same situation for the angular momentum eigenstates in three dimensional euclidean space .",
    "there one also has to pick out a special @xmath205-axis to introduce the @xmath206 and @xmath207 quantum numbers , and this brakes the rotational invariance .",
    "however , the origin of angular momentum space is a well defined physical concept .",
    "it corresponds to a system that does not rotate .",
    "but what is the physical meaning of the special point in spacetime ?",
    "first of all , we should note that this special point is a _",
    "parameter _ that enters the action .",
    "implicitly , it shows up in the definition of the boundary term , which we added to the lagrangian to render it finite .",
    "this term was actually determined up to a constant only , that is , up to a term that does not depend on the regularization parameter @xmath114 .",
    "there is not much choice for such a term , if we demand that it is linear in the velocities , that the lorentz symmetry is not broken , and that the equations of motion are not modified .",
    "what we then still can do is to replace the embedding field @xmath47 by @xmath208 .",
    "it results in a redefinition of the lagrangian , + 12 .",
    "this does _ not _ change the classical equations of motion .",
    "it _ does _ however change the poisson structure on the phase space and thus the algebra of the quantum operators .",
    "the consequence is that the origin of the spectrum shown in the figure is shifted to the point @xmath209 .",
    "we can also see that the transformation exactly cancels , which resulted from an ordinary translation of the position coordinates .",
    "the ordinary translations are , in a sense , represented as a kind of `` metasymmetry '' .",
    "the lagrangian itself is not invariant , but it contains a parameter , and changing this parameter compensates for the translation",
    ". we should view upon this as a parameter of the theory , to be determined by `` experiments '' .",
    "so , we can shift this origin of spacetime wherever we like , but we can not avoid that there is such a special point . on the other hand , we saw that , even with the origin fixed , there is a perfectly well defined action of the poincar group on the classical phase space @xmath108 , realized by the lorentz rotations and the deformed translations .",
    "of course , these symmetries are also realized as unitary transformations on @xmath210 , generated by the operators @xmath132 and @xmath128 .",
    "however , the deformed translations mix the position and momentum variables in a somewhat strange way , so that the result is not a simple shift of the spectrum of spacetime . one could interpret this as a `` deformed principle of relativity '' .",
    "if one observer sees a classical state @xmath151 , or a quantum state @xmath211 , then another observer , which is located at a different point in spacetime , sees a different state , and this state is not obtained by a simple shift in @xmath95 but by a deformed translations , or its quantum analogue .",
    "this would restore the translational invariance , and it also provides a physical interpretation of the origin , which becomes the position of the observer .    of course , all these statements are somewhat counterintuitive . a different way out of this dilemma might be to consider multi particle models . for a system of",
    "finitely many particles , it turns out that the poisson structure on the reduced phase space is very similar to , except that now the variables @xmath95 and @xmath93 become the _ relative _ coordinates .",
    "they represent the relative distance between two particles , and something like their relative momentum @xcite . as a result",
    ", one finds that the spectrum of the relative coordinates looks like the one shown in .",
    "the origin then has a well defined meaning .",
    "it corresponds to a state where the two particles are at the same point in spacetime .",
    "the fact that there is no such state in the quantum spectrum , and that for the state that is closest to the origin we have @xmath194 , implies that the particles can not come closer to each other than one planck length .    another issue , which is also due to an ambiguity in the definition of the boundary term at infinity , concerns the inherent orientation of spacetime . at the classical level",
    ", this is already apparent from the basic brackets between the coordinates @xmath127 .",
    "the appearance of the levi civita symbol indicates that the theory is not `` @xmath212 '' invariant .",
    "the lagrangian is not invariant with respect to the substitutions @xmath213 ( or @xmath214 ) and @xmath215 .",
    "again , this broken symmetry can be seen quite nicely in the quantum spacetime picture . on the discrete rings in the future light cone which are closest the time axis , only positive values of the spatial angular momentum occur .",
    "the further we go away from the time axis , the more negative angular momenta mix in . in the past light cone , the situation is reversed . slightly sloppy",
    "speaking , if we want to localize the particle on such a ring , then we have to give it an angular momentum in a certain direction .",
    "this orientation results from another freedom in the definition of the boundary term .",
    "we can replace @xmath117 by a linear combination of @xmath117 and @xmath216 , which leads to a more general reduced lagrangian , whose kinetic part is parametrized by a real number @xmath217 , = - 12 - 12 ( 1- ) . again",
    ", this does not change the equations of motion , but it does affect the poisson structure . replacing @xmath217 with @xmath218 corresponds to a `` @xmath212 '' transformation @xmath219 , @xmath220 , so that this symmetry is also realized as a kind of metasymmetry .",
    "unfortunately , the value @xmath221 , which would remove the handedness of spacetime , is the only value for @xmath217 for which the classical equations of motion are no longer reproduced fully . this can be seen by repeating the derivation of the evolution equations with the modified lagrangian .",
    "so , we have to take the same point of view here as well .",
    "the orientation of spacetime is a parameter which has to be determined by experiments . for simplicity ,",
    "let us stick to @xmath222 in the following .",
    "let us now consider the dynamics of the particle on the quantum spacetime , which is described by the mass shell constraint .",
    "classically , it was given by = - = 0 .",
    "let us see how the corresponding operator acts in the euler angle representation .",
    "we find that = ( - ) = ( - ) .",
    "if we expand a generic state as in , = 12 ^ 2 ( 2 ) ( , , ) , then the wave function has to satisfy ( - ) ( , , ) = 0 .",
    "it states that @xmath223 has support on the mass shells only , and defines the physical state space @xmath224 as a subset of @xmath210 .",
    "we can use @xmath171 and @xmath167 as coordinates on the mass shells , and write the general solution to the mass shell constraint as ( , , ) = _ ( - ) ( ) _ ( , ) . here",
    ", @xmath225 , with @xmath226 , is a pair of arbitrary functions .",
    "we have @xmath227 for particles and @xmath228 for antiparticles .",
    "the theta function , which is @xmath71 for negative arguments and @xmath193 for positive , ensures that @xmath229 for particles and @xmath230 for antiparticles .    as for the relativistic point particle , we are faced with the problem that the physical state space @xmath224 is actually not a subspace of the hilbert space @xmath210 .",
    "the wave functions are not normalizable .",
    "the problem can be solved in the standard way , by introducing a new scalar product , which is , up to a constant , uniquely determined if we require it to be lorentz invariant . in other words ,",
    "we want the operators @xmath132 and @xmath128 to remain hermitian under the new product .    to find this physical product explicitly , we note that the wave function @xmath225 in transforms as a scalar under lorentz transformations .",
    "the left hand side is a scalar function of @xmath231 , and the argument of the delta function is also a scalar , because it is equal to @xmath232 .",
    "hence , to define a lorentz invariant scalar product , we need a lorentz invariant measure on the mass shell in terms of the coordinates @xmath167 and @xmath171 .",
    "this is found to be = 14 ^ 2 _ ^ * _ ( , ) _ ( , ) .",
    "it becomes a more familiar expression , if we replace the polar coordinates @xmath233 by the components of the spatial momentum vector @xmath234 .",
    "explicitly , we have _ 1 = , _ 2 = , and this implies = = .",
    "on the mass shell , @xmath235 is equal to @xmath236 , so that the expression for the scalar product becomes formally the same as for the relativistic point particle in the momentum representation , = 14 ^ 2 _ ^ * _ ( ) _ ( ) .    as a next step",
    ", we would like to see in which sense the mass shell constraint can be interpreted as a time evolution equation for the quantum state . to explain what we are going to do ,",
    "let us consider a relativistic point particle in flat spacetime for a moment .",
    "there we have the mass shell constraint in momentum space , ( _ a ^a + ^2 ) ( ) = 0 . clearly , to see that this is actually a time evolution equation , we only need to fourier transform to the position representation .",
    "but what if there was no such representation , as in our model ?",
    "we can then still see that it is a time evolution equation , if we diagonalize another set of operators , such that one of them is the time operator @xmath164 .",
    "let us choose as the other two operators the absolute length of the spatial momentum @xmath237 , and the spatial angular momentum @xmath238 .",
    "they commute with each other and both commute with @xmath239 . if we now write the transformed wave function as @xmath240 , where @xmath241 , @xmath242 , and @xmath243 , then the mass shell constraint becomes a second order differential equation in @xmath168 , - ^2 ( , ; ) =",
    "( ^2+^2 ) ( , ;) .",
    "so , without transforming completely to the position representation , we find this `` klein gordon equation '' .",
    "we can convert it into a schrdinger equation , if we decompose the solutions into particle and antiparticle states . the general solution to",

    "( , ; ) = _ ( , ; ) .",
    "we chose this somewhat skew representation , because in our model we can diagonalize exactly the same operators .",
    "we did this already in , which was the most general eigenstate of @xmath174 and @xmath172 .",
    "let us define = , and expand the state in this basis , = _ _ 2 ( 2 ) ( , ; ) .",
    "as the rapidity @xmath167 is related to the spatial momentum by @xmath245 , this is essentially the same representation as the one considered above for the relativistic point particle . to write the mass shell constraint as an equation for the wave function @xmath246",
    ", we need to know how @xmath247 acts on the new basis states , = = 12 ( + ) . using this",
    ", we can write the klein gordon equation as ( + 1 , ; ) + ( -1 , ; ) = 2 ( , ;) . this is not a second order",
    "_ differential _",
    "equation , but a second order _ difference _ equation .",
    "we should have expected something like this , because the eigenvalues of @xmath174 are discrete .",
    "the fact that it is such a nice nearest neighbour equation is a result of the appearance of @xmath248 in the constraint .",
    "it is not difficult to see that it reduces to the ordinary klein gordon equation in the limit @xmath249 . to do this , we set @xmath250 , and then make the replacements 4 , 4 , / , to restores the physical units .",
    "if we then expand for small @xmath177 , but finite @xmath173 , and use that @xmath251 , we recover in the leading order , which is @xmath252 .",
    "we can also convert the discretized klein gordon equation into a schrdinger equation , if we split the wave function into a particle and an antiparticle wave function .",
    "this becomes more or less straightforward , if we first write the step equation as ( + 1 , ; ) + ( -1 , ; ) = ( + ^-1 ) ( , ;) , where @xmath253 is found to be = .",
    "this is a complex unit , so it acts on wave functions as a unitary operator .",
    "we can now write the general solution to the second order difference equation as a sum of solutions to the following first order difference equations , ( , ; ) = _ _ ( , ; ) , _ ( + 1 , ; ) = ^ _ ( , ; ) .",
    "this is very similar to the time evolution equation in ordinary quantum mechanics , -it ( t ) = ( t ) ( t+ ) = ( t ) .",
    "the only difference between our time evolution equation and the schrdinger equation is that we can not write it as a differential equation , because we do not have a continuous time .",
    "we can however use it to read off what the energy of our particle is . for this purpose",
    ", we have to write the unitary operator @xmath254 , which moves us forward one unit in time , as the exponential of an hermitian operator , ^= = + i. if we compare this to , we find that @xmath255 is determined by = , > 0 .",
    "these are exactly the equations that determine the value of the euler angle @xmath170 on the mass shell .",
    "so we have , on the mass shell , @xmath256 , and we recover , at the quantum level , exactly what we already found at the classical level in the end of .",
    "the energy of the particle is given by the euler angle @xmath170 , which is related to the deficit angle of the particle , measured in the rest frame of the observer .",
    "a peculiar feature of this quantum energy is however that it is only determined up to a multiple of @xmath63 ( times the planck energy ) , because @xmath170 is an angular variable .",
    "clearly , this is because , at the quantum level , the energy of the particle is actually its _ frequency _ , and if time is discrete , than this can only be determined up to a multiple of @xmath63 , divided by the time step .",
    "finally , we would like to discuss the question how to extract physical information about the particle from the state @xmath211 .",
    "for this purpose , we need a complete set of _ observables _ , that is , operators that commute with the mass shell constraint , and for which we have a physical interpretation of the corresponding classical phase space function .",
    "this is quite obvious for the operators @xmath128 and @xmath132 , representing the momentum and angular momentum of the particle .",
    "they are in fact complete , but not independent .",
    "the momentum obeys the mass shell condition , @xmath257 , and for the angular momentum we have @xmath258 . as a set of independent observables we could choose the spatial components @xmath259 and @xmath260 ( @xmath261 ) , but there is another set which has a more natural physical interpretation .",
    "the position operators @xmath127 are not observables as they do not commute with the constraint .",
    "but we can use them to construct an observable which represents the position of the particle at a fixed time @xmath99 .",
    "classically , this is given by @xmath262 , which is easily found to have a vanishing bracket with the constraint .",
    "to make it a hermitian operator , we choose the symmetrized ordering _",
    "i ( ) = _ i - ( _ 0 + ) - ( _ 0 + ) = _ i - ( _ 0 + ) + i this looks again similar to the analogue of the relativistic point particle , except the the usual `` newton wigner term '' @xmath263 is replaced by a more complicated expression . however , in the low momentum limit , it reduces to the usual one , because we can neglect @xmath264 compared to @xmath136 .    now , the operators @xmath265 , for fixed @xmath99 , and the spatial components of the momentum @xmath259 form a complete set of independent observables .",
    "classically , they fix the initial condition for the particle at time @xmath99 .",
    "to set up a position representation , we should diagonalize the observables @xmath265 . unfortunately , this is still not possible , because they do not commute .",
    "if we consider the operators @xmath265 as representing the position of the particle at time @xmath99 , then the space on which the particle is moving is non - commutative , like to the non - commutative spacetime that we encountered before we imposed the mass shell condition . to see the similarity , let us compute the commutator of the @xmath266 operators and consider the resulting uncertainty relation .",
    "for the classical phase space functions @xmath265 , we find = 2_ij ( + ) . hence , assuming that the same holds up to higher order corrections for the quantum operators , we find that the minimal uncertainty in the position coordinates of a particle centered at the origin grows with the square root of @xmath99 .",
    "this is exactly the same behaviour as that of the innermost rings in .",
    "so , we can reproduce the same result at the level of observables , that is , with the gauge degrees of freedom completely divided out .",
    "what we can not reproduce at this level is the discretization of time .",
    "this is because there is no observable that corresponds to the measurement of time .",
    "note , for example , that the observable @xmath265 is constructed by a kind of interpolation , and it is defined for every real value of @xmath99 .",
    "the integers do not play any special role . to reproduce the discreteness of time",
    ", one should introduce an additional degree of freedom , for example a clock associated with the particle , and then consider the eigenvalues of the operator corresponding to the measurement `` read off the clock at external time @xmath99 '' .",
    "such an operator is expected to have a discrete spectrum , because it is `` canonically conjugate '' to the mass of the particle , which is restricted to a finite interval .",

    "we define a scalar @xmath247 and a vector @xmath128 such that = + _ a ^a ^2 - _ a ^a = 1 , where the last equations results from the condition that @xmath283 .",

    "the angle @xmath171 becomes redundant , whereas @xmath170 is always regular .",
    "all together , they form a kind of `` cylindrical '' coordinate system , with radial coordinate @xmath167 , polar angle @xmath171 , and @xmath170 playing the role of the `` @xmath205''-coordinate , which is however winded up .",
    "the coordinates @xmath170 and @xmath167 are shown as the grid lines in .",

    "the sign in the exponent fixes the _ direction _ of the rotation .",
    "in contrast to three dimensional euclidean space , in minkowski space we can distinguish between rotations in positive and negative direction .",
    "the second sign appears because @xmath93 is an element of the _ spinor _ representation of the lorentz group , whereas `` rotation by @xmath66 '' refers to the _ vector _ representation .",

    "this equation is still invariant under @xmath302 , or @xmath220 , it still does not fix the direction of the rotation .",
    "this ambiguity remains in the description of the particle , and it becomes a kind of particle  antiparticle duality .",
    "here , we shall briefly derive the basic results of the harmonic analysis on the group manifold @xmath0 . for a more detailed treatment of the subject we refer to @xcite .",
    "we start with the general @xmath164 and @xmath165 eigenstates @xmath303 , where @xmath166 is function the euler angle @xmath167 , which is essentially the spatial momentum and commutes with @xmath174 and @xmath172 ( see ) .",

    "_ 1 i_2 + 12 ( _ 1 i_2 ) .",
    "they act on @xmath93 eigenstates as _",

    "+ _ - = 14 + ( + 12)(+12- ) , _ - _ + = 14 + ( + 12)(+12 + ) .",
    "we also need the commutator relations = 2 _ , = 0 , = _ , = _ .",
    "now , let @xmath307 be a normalized eigenstate of @xmath174 , @xmath172 , and @xmath186 , with eigenvalues @xmath308 , @xmath309 , and @xmath310 , respectively .",

    "the left hand sides of are now always positive , and we do not get any algebraic restrictions on the quantum numbers . but can we realize these states as square integrable functions on @xmath0 ? if we write the eigenstate as @xmath317 , with a wave function @xmath318 , then we can study the behaviour of @xmath166 for @xmath319 . for large @xmath167 ,",
    "the eigenvalue equation of the laplace beltrami operator becomes ( ) ~(^2 + 1 ) ( ) ( ) ~a + b .",
    "we get a superposition of an ingoing and outgoing wave with wavelength @xmath320 .",
    "they fall off with @xmath321 .",
    "this is exactly the right behaviour for @xmath166 to become normalizable under the scalar product , like usual plane waves in @xmath322 .",
    "as @xmath167 is a radial coordinate , there must be a balance between ingoing and outgoing waves , and instead of two we only get one solution for @xmath166 for any fixed set of quantum numbers @xmath168 , @xmath169 and @xmath311 .",
    "so we have the following continuous series of eigenstates , = ^2(^2 + 1 ) , , , _ + .",
    "next we consider the case @xmath313 .",
    "this time we repace @xmath311 by a real number @xmath189 , such that @xmath323 , and for the moment we take @xmath324 .",
    "we then get some algebraic restrictions on the quantum numbers from .",
    "they are violated if @xmath325 or @xmath326 .",
    "so we can not have any states with @xmath325 .",
    "but the inequalities are never saturated , and so we can change @xmath168 by any multiple of two , using the @xmath327 operators .",
    "this excludes all odd values for @xmath168 . on the other hand ,",
    "if there is an eigenstate @xmath307 for some even @xmath168 , then we can use the raising and lowering operations to arrive at a state @xmath328 , and the wave function @xmath166 has to obey ",
    "( ) + 2 ( 2 )  ( ) = ( 2- ) ( ) .",
    "it is then not difficult to show that a solution to this differential equation can never be square integrable and smooth at the origin @xmath287 .",
    "so there are no states with eigenvalues @xmath313 .    finally , let us study the case @xmath314 .",
    "here we also use the parameter @xmath189 such that @xmath323 , but now we take @xmath329 .",
    "then we find the following condition on the quantum numbers , ( + 2 ) ( -2 ) ( - 2 ) ( -2 ) .",
    "as @xmath329 , this is equivalent to the somewhat simpler condition - , now assume that @xmath189 is _ not _ an integer",
    ". then these inequalities will never be saturated , which in turn means that starting from any state we can build up an infinite tower of states in both @xmath168-directions , by acting on it with the @xmath327 operators .",
    "thereby , we can increase or decrease @xmath168 by any multiple of @xmath269 .",
    "however , at least one of these values will lie in the region between @xmath189 and @xmath330 , which is forbidden .",
    "so @xmath189 has to be an integer .",
    "but even then we can create towers of states with elements falling into the forbidden region , unless the series terminates .",
    "the only way to build up such a terminating tower is to start on the boundary , with quantum number @xmath331 or @xmath332 , and then act on this state with @xmath333 or @xmath334 , respectively .",
    "note that it is @xmath335 that annihilates the state at @xmath331 and vice verse , so what we get are two infinite towers , one with @xmath336 and the other one with @xmath337 . for a fixed @xmath168",
    ", we therefore get the restriction that 2 || ( 2 ) .",
    "there are no states for @xmath178 and @xmath325 . with a similar argument",
    ", we can determine the range of @xmath169 for fixed @xmath189 and @xmath168 .",
    "the result is 12 ( - ) 2 , - 12 ( - ) -2 .",
    "hence , for each value of @xmath338 , we have two `` ground states '' @xmath339 and @xmath340 , and all other states can be generated by acting with @xmath333 and @xmath341 onto @xmath342 , and similarly with the @xmath334 and @xmath343 onto @xmath344 .",
    "note that thereby also negative values for @xmath169 occur in the positive series and vice verse , because @xmath333 _ decreases _ @xmath169 and @xmath334 _ increases _ it .",
    "studying the asymptotic behaviour and of these states , we find that ( ) ~a + b .",
    "for this to be square integrable , we must have @xmath345 .",
    "thus , there is again only one state for each set of quantum numbers , and the whole discrete series of eigenstates is given by = ^2 ( 2- ) , = 2,3,4,  which splits into a positive and a negative series with = , + 2,+4 , ",
