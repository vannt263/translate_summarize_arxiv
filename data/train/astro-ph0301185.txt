    "the draco dwarf spheroidal companion to the milky way , at a distance of about 82 kpc @xcite , was discovered fifty years ago from examination of palomar observatory sky survey schmidt plates @xcite .",
    "the horizontal branch for this dwarf galaxy is located at @xmath2 and it covers more than 1/3 of a square degree on the sky .",
    "draco is one of the nearest of the galaxy s known dwarf spheroidal companions and is among the faintest known galaxies , with a luminosity of @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "dwarf spheroidal galaxies typically contain many variable stars , predominately the rr lyrae variables typical of older , metal - poor stellar populations @xcite .",
    "draco is no exception .",
    "the first extensive study of draco by @xcite found 138 variable stars in the central part of draco .",
    "they determined that all but five of these variables were rr lyraes .",
    "the five remaining variables were deemed to be  anomalous \" cepheids .",
    "these cepheids have a shorter period and so do not obey the period - luminosity relation for type ii cepheids @xcite .",
    "these  anomalous \" cepheids have been found in other dwarf spheroidals since their discovery in draco @xcite .",
    "five carbon stars have also been found in draco by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "more recent compilations of variables in draco are underway @xcite .",
    "the first detailed photometric survey of the draco dwarf spheroidal galaxy was created by @xcite . since then draco has become one of the best studied dwarf galaxies with several more recent photometric surveys .",
    "we have created our own catalog of stars in draco using data from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) .",
    "we present wide area , @xmath4 ccd observations of draco down to about @xmath5 , and construct a color magnitude diagram .",
    "we combine our catalog of sdss stars in draco with previously published photometric data in draco , from : @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite to create a heterogeneous catalog of draco stars , with multiple epochs of observation which allow us to identify variable candidates .",
    "the ccd imaging observations of draco are taken from sdss runs 1336 and 1339 , which were obtained 2000 april 4 with the sdss mosaic imaging camera @xcite .",
    "the majority of the stars in the dwarf spheroidal fall on two frames of data in the same camera column ( one continuous stream of drift - scan data ) . since the precise calibration for the sdss filter system is still in progress , magnitudes in this paper are quoted in the @xmath6 system , which approximates the final sdss system @xcite .",
    "these systems differ absolutely ( with negligible color terms ) by only a few percent in @xmath7 , and no more than 10% in @xmath8 .",
    "see @xcite and @xcite for further information on the filter system and the overall survey , respectively .",
    "the data were reduced with photo ( lupton et al . in preparation ) version 5.1.7 .",
    "@xcite describes the astrometry and astrometric accuracy of the software .",
    "@xcite describes our monitoring program for photometricity .",
    "these data are included in the public early data release ( edr ) @xcite .    in the course of commissioning a survey ,",
    "the images are reduced several times as the software evolves .",
    "the data presented here have been reduced three times . the first reduction is called  rerun 0 , \" and second is  rerun 1 . \"",
    "most of the data included in this paper are from  rerun 1 , \" with some exceptions which are noted in the text below .",
    " rerun 2 \" was the version released in the edr , and differs from  rerun 1 \" only in a small overall calibration offset .",
    "since we recalibrate all of the photometry ourselves , the difference is not important .",
    "so , an object which is listed in the catalog by the sdss i d 1336 - 1 - 5 - 60 - 950 ( run - rerun - cameracolumn - field - objectid ) is the same object as 1336 - 2 - 5 - 60 - 950 in the edr .",
    "the seeing for the draco scans was typically 1.8  fwhm .",
    "intercomparison of objects detected twice in overlapping scans is a good indication of relative photometric error , and for objects with @xmath9 , rms error for stellar sources is typically @xmath10% . for objects between @xmath11 ,",
    "typical errors are 8% , growing to 20% at @xmath12 , near the detection limit . for reference ,",
    "blue stars with @xmath13 have a sdss @xmath1 magnitude approximately equal to their johnson @xmath14 magnitude , while stars with @xmath15 have @xmath16 . in general , @xmath17 @xcite .    in order to obtain the best measurements at faint magnitudes , we used photometry derived from fits of the pointspread function ( psf ) to stellar profiles .",
    "the sdss code determines the psf as a function of position in each ccd frame ( 1361 x 2048 pixels , or @xmath18 x @xmath19 ) .",
    "while we were studying the stellar populations within draco , we noticed a systematic shift in the color of the giant branch as a function of position within the draco field .",
    "further analysis showed that this result could be explained by systematic inaccuracies in the ( psf ) photometry as modeled in the edr reductions of the data ( these systematics are corrected in later data releases ) .",
    "since the code used to create the edr did not accurately track rapidly varying point - spread functions , the psf magnitudes in some regions of the sky were systematically shifted brighter or fainter by up to a tenth of a magnitude .",
    "for this study , we were able to correct the edr psf magnitudes using the aperture magnitudes for bright objects .",
    "although aperture magnitudes are quite noisy for faint stars , they are accurate for bright stars and not affected by the error in the calculated psf .",
    "we used the brighter stars to calculate a correction to the psf magnitudes , as a function of row and column in each frame .",
    "we fit a second degree polynomial to the deviations between the aperture and psf magnitudes ( mag(@xmath20)@xmath21mag(@xmath22 ) ) vs. ccd row and column for stars brighter than magnitude 19.5 .",
    "we then used this polynomial to correct the photometry of _ all _ stars in the frame to the mean of the aperture photometry for that frame .",
    "the assumption here is that the aperture magnitudes are correct , and their calibration does not vary as the psf varies across rows or columns .",
    "this is a good assumption if we capture practically all of the light in each object , even in the sections of data with poorer seeing .",
    "the results of this correction procedure are shown in figure 1 .",
    "the left panel shows the color - magnitude diagram for draco , using psf magnitudes , and the right panel shows the same diagram after correcting the psf magnitudes . though we did not use any information about the giant branch of draco , notice that the giant branch of the dwarf galaxy is significantly narrower after correction",
    "this is evidence that the correction technique significantly improved the accuracy of the photometry .",
    "in order to generate a useful catalog of stars in the draco dwarf galaxy , we first selected from the sdss database those objects with @xmath23 and @xmath24 , which were marked as unsaturated , and which were far enough from the edge of the frame that they were completely contained on a single ccd detector .",
    "this latter criterion effectively eliminates only quite extended galaxies near the edges , since there is enough overlap between frames that point sources are completely contained on at least one frame .",
    "we also removed duplicate measurements of the same astronomical object , either by multiple observation or multiple software measurements of the same observation , by choosing only observations marked in the sdss as ` primary . ' for each direction in the sky , only one observation and instance of processing is considered ` primary , ' so this flag effectively removes duplicates .    to determine a centroid of our elliptical region , stars in our original data set were binned into boxes of area 0.05 degrees on a side",
    "then , we fit an elliptical gaussian ( right ascension and declination of the center , major and minor axes , a position angle , and sky ) , to the binned data .",
    "the adopted center of the distribution is : @xmath25 ( j2000 ) .",
    "the exact center of the fit shifted by ten arcseconds depending on how we weighted the fit , which yields an error bar on our chosen center .",
    "other sources such as @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite report the center of draco as : @xmath26 17:20:13 @xmath27 57:55:11 ( j2000 , converted from b1950 ) , @xmath26 17:20.3 @xmath27 57:55.1 ( j2000 , converted from b1950 ) , and @xmath26 17:20:12.39 @xmath27 57:54:55.3 ( j2000 ) respectively .",
    "these positions for draco s center are in good agreement with the value we found in right ascension , and off by about ten arcseconds in declination .",
    "the major axis of the ellipse fit is nearly constant in declination ( pa @xmath28 ) with gaussian sigma 0.122 degrees ( corrected for @xmath29 ) .",
    "the minor axis is 0.082 degrees in the declination direction implying an ellipticity of 1 - 0.082/0.122=0.33 in agreement with hodge ( 1964 ) who found an ellipticity of @xmath30 , and also in excellent agreement with @xcite who find an ellipticity of 0.331 for draco .    to increase the fraction of cataloged stars which are associated with the dwarf galaxy , we included only those stars in an elliptical region centered on the draco dwarf galaxy ( see figure 2 ) , which extends to about one third of the tidal radius measured by @xcite . of the 7417 objects within the area of this 2-sigma ellipse for our draco catalog , 5492 were brighter than our adopted magnitude limit of 23.005 ( this odd effective limit is due to rounding before the limit was applied ) .",
    "the actual number of sdss objects in the final catalog , 5634 , is slightly different , as 15 objects with suspicious sdss photometry ( mostly on bright star bleed trails ) were removed , and 157 objects were added from previous data reductions of the same astronomical images .",
    "positions on the sky of cataloged sdss stars are displayed in figure 2 .",
    "faint sdss detections ( @xmath31 ) are shown as small black dots , while brighter stars are larger black dots .",
    "galaxies ( objects which the sdss software determined to be extended ) are not included in the plot .",
    "the catalog presented in this paper overlaps several previously published photometric surveys of the draco dwarf galaxy .",
    "the footprints of the five surveys which are cross - referenced to sources in our catalog are shown in figure 2 .",
    "our catalog also includes the fainter ten of the twelve draco stars with accurate photometry from @xcite .",
    "their sdss ids , from brightest to faintest , are : 1339 - 1 - 5 - 62 - 26 , 1336 - 1 - 5 - 61 - 148 , 1336 - 1 - 5 - 61 - 119 , 1339 - 1 - 5 - 61 - 384 , 1336 - 1 - 5 - 61 - 478 , 1339 - 1 - 5 - 61 - 366 , 1336 - 1 - 5 - 61 - 370 , 1336 - 1 - 5 - 61 - 294 , 1336 - 1 - 5 - 61 - 685 , and 1336 - 1 - 5 - 61 - 1227 .",
    "since there are so few , we do not include a separate column in the catalog table . in the remainder of this section",
    ", we describe the construction of a catalog of draco stars with cross - references to the other catalogs .",
    "ultimately , the overlapping catalogs are used to generate a list of possible variable stars .",
    "we list in table 1 a summary of stars detected in each previous survey , along with numbers of matches to sdss detections . the main data product of this paper , with format specified in table 2 , is contained in the ( electronic ) table 3 .",
    "table 3 contains identifications , magnitudes , colors and cross - references to other surveys for stars in draco .",
    "the sdss j2000 right ascension ( in degrees ) , declination ( in degrees ) , sdss i d ( run - rerun - cameracolumn - field - objectid ) , @xmath1 magnitude , and @xmath32 colors of each object are listed as columns 1 through 8 of table 3 , respectively .",

    "a flag indicating classification of the object as stellar (  s \" ) , a resolved galaxy (  g \" ) or of an indeterminant extent (  f \" for faint ) is indicated in column 34 of table 3 .",
    "all stars with @xmath31 are classified as  faint . \"",
    "the 5766 lines in this table include the 5634 individual objects detected in the sdss database , 19 objects from the baade - swope dataset which were not matched to sdss objects , and 113 duplicate entries in cases where there exist piatek objects in both the e1 and co fields .",
    "the additional baade - swope entries were apparent in the sdss images , so we were able to provide approximate astrometric positions even though no automated photometry was generated .",
    "we included multiple lines for piatek duplicates to avoid adding yet four more columns to an already large table .      the survey of area of @xcite ( hereafter bs61 ) , approximately covering a circular region of radius @xmath38@xmath39 centered at r.a .",
    "@xmath40 , dec . @xmath41@xmath42@xmath43 ( b1950 ) , is completely contained within our catalog .",
    "since the individual right ascensions and declinations were not included for each star in the bs61 catalog , the stars were matched by comparing the finding charts with sdss images .",
    "of the 624 stars in table c of bs61 , 563 were cross - identified with an object in the sdss catalog , available in the sdss early data release ( edr ) .",
    "an additional 24 objects were measured in a previous software reduction ( rerun 0 ) of the same data , and were included in our catalog .",

    "the process of cross - referencing catalogs through visual identification of stars in finding charts and images is inherently prone to errors . to reduce and evaluate the error rate ,",
    "several checks were performed .",
    "we plotted @xmath44 vs. @xmath45 for a set of magnitude ranges ( figures 3a and 3b ) . here",
    ", @xmath1 is the sdss magnitude which is most similar to v. except in unusual cases , stellar photometry should produce an approximately linear relationship between @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",

    "the derived color relations ( sdss dereddened values compared to bs61 undereddened values ) are : @xmath46 @xmath47 this transformation is only slightly different from that found in @xcite ( hereafter f96 ) , based on preliminary sdss filter transmission design .",
    "outliers on the @xmath44 vs. @xmath45 plots were checked for mis - identification matches between sdss and bs61 , and several were found and corrected . using the derived color transformations , the magnitudes of the detections of the same objects were directly compared in magnitude and color .",
    "stars with significant differences in computed magnitudes or colors between different catalog observations are either variable , have unusual spectra which do not lead to linear color transformations , or are errors in either the sdss or bs61 measurements .",
    "the outliers in magnitude are marked with diamonds in figure 4a , and those outliers in color by diamonds in figure 5a .",
    "note that the photometry of bs61 is systematically shifted by several tenths of a magnitude at the faint end .",
    "we compared the photometry between catalogs only for objects which are classified in the sdss as stellar ( column 34 of table 3 ) . since the fraction of the light measured for galaxies differed between datasets , the inclusion of extended sources in the outlier detection process led to a large number of objects which appeared to vary in brightness from one observation to the next .",
    "this data cut did not have a large effect on the results from the bs61 data , since bs61 pre - selected only stellar objects , but is of greater import in comparing objects in other catalogs discussed below .",
    "of the 586 bs61 objects matched to sdss objects , only 25 were classified as galaxies by the sdss , and 6 were fainter than @xmath48 magnitude in @xmath1 ( and thus are classified only as  faint \" in table 3 ) .",
    "stellar objects with a significant calculated photometric difference between sdss and bs61 are flagged in column 13 of table 3 .",

    "the survey area of @xcite ( hereafter cs86 ) is broken up into two overlapping fields : field 1 and field 2 . the total area ( 27 square arcminutes ) of these two fields is completely contained within our catalog .",
    "each of the two fields covers @xmath50@xmath51 in declination and @xmath52@xmath53 in right ascension and an outline of the field boundaries is drawn in figure 2 . each field",

    "the two fields overlap by 3.4 square arcminutes ( 26% ) .",
    "an x and y value ( in pixels ) is given for each star in the two fields .",
    "to convert these x and y values to right ascension and declination , we created a transformation for each field .",
    "these transformations are accurate within about 1 arcsecond ( rms ) .",
    "the transformation for field 1 is :    @xmath54    @xmath55    and for field 2 the transformation is :    @xmath56    @xmath57    about half of the stars in each of the two fields were faint ( v @xmath58 @xmath59 ) , and were not matched to the sdss data .",
    "370 of the 547 field 1 stars were matched to sdss detections , and 292 of the 423 field 2 stars were matched .",
    "most of the stars that were not identified had @xmath60 ) .",
    "since the unmatched stars were not clumped in position on the sky , we believe that the coordinate transformation is not responsible for the fact that many of stars are not found in common between the catalogs .",
    "almost all of the unmatched cs86 stars were either fainter than 23rd magnitude in v or close enough to brighter stars that the sdss deblender did not identify them as isolated sources .",
    "we used the same method to reduce and evaluate the error rate in cs86 data as we did in bs61 data .",
    "the transformation from b , v photometry to @xmath61 photometry was different , however .",
    "the transformation from f96 was a good match to the data , so it was adopted : @xmath62 @xmath63 the computed @xmath1 values would differ by a few percent if we used the transformations derived in @xcite from comparisons of sdss standard stars to landolt standards .",
    "a comparison of our photometry with the corresponding photometry from ten stars in @xcite support the claim that the @xcite transformations are a better match to modern ccd photometry than the theoretical transformations of f96 .",
    "since we are using the transformations only to look for outliers , it does nt matter if the overall transformation is off by a few percent ( either due to the transformation or the fact that our magnitudes are dereddened and cs86 data is not ) .",
    "figures 3e , 3f , 4c and 5c show the photometric comparisons between sdss and cs86 data , and the outliers chosen as candidate variables .",

    "note that the numbering system for the bs61 variable stars is separate from the photometric table with which we matched our data ; we did not match the photometry for the variable star list .",
    "we recover 82 ( 60% ) of the 135 bs61 variables , which are identified in the last column of table 4 .",
    "we also recover 28 numbered bs61 variables outside the inner eight arcminutes , and three bs61 variables which were not given a number .",
    "since most of the variables were detected from only two epochs of photometry , we would not expect to recover all of the variable objects in draco from this technique .",

    "a matched catalog of 5634 objects in the draco dwarf field , extending over four times the area of the @xcite catalog and reaching to approximately one third the new tidal radius of @xcite , has been assembled .",
    "we selected five color data from the sdss with @xmath92 , within the elliptical region @xmath93 ^ 2 + [ ( \\delta-57.913)/0.164]^2 < 1 $ ] , where @xmath94 and @xmath95 are in j2000 degrees .",
    "this sdss data was merged with several existing data sets to produce our final catalog .",
    "the data sets include : @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .    using only stellar sources with @xmath96",
    ", we identify 142 candidate variable stars , of which 113 were identified as variables in bs61 , one is a known carbon star , and two are known qsos .",
    "since the sdss observations were taken nearly simultaneously in all filters , the catalog colors and distance to the draco dwarf can be used to identify potential rr lyrae stars .",
    "nearly @xmath97 of the candidate variable objects have colors consistent with those of rr lyrae variables .",
    "only 6 ( 23% ) of the 26 objects which do not have previous identifications are classified as rr lyrae candidates on the basis of their colors .",
    "we report all astrometric and photometric transformations used to compare our data with previous catalogs .",
    "we would like to thank carl j. grillmair for sending his unpublished data , and hugh harris for providing us with the positions of bs61 variables outside of the central eight arcminutes of draco .",
