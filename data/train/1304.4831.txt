    "the isolation of flakes of single - layer and few - layer graphene@xcite has triggered a huge burst of interest on two - dimensional layered materials because of their structural and electronic properties .",
    "due to its huge electronic mobility , graphene has been in the last years the main focus of the research in the field .",
    "however , a drawback in engineering graphene - based electronic device is the absence of a gap in the monolayer samples , and the difficulty in opening a gap in multilayer systems without affecting the mobility . as an alternative route , recent research is exploring the idea of multilayered heterostructures built up from interfacing different twodimensional materials.@xcite along this perspective , semiconducting dichalcogenides such as mos@xmath0 , mose@xmath0 , ws@xmath0 , etc .",
    "are promising compounds since they can be easily exfoliated and present a suitable small gap both in single - layer and in few - layer samples .",
    "quite interestingly , in few - layer mos@xmath0 the size and the nature of the gap depends on the number @xmath1 of mos@xmath0 layers , with a transition between a direct gap in monolayer ( @xmath2 ) compounds to a smaller indirect gap for @xmath3 .",
    "@xcite in addition , the electronic properties appear to be highly sensitive to the external pressure and strain , which affect the insulating gap and , under particular conditions , can also induce a insulator / metal transition .",
    "@xcite another intriguing feature of these materials is the strong entanglement between the spin and the orbital / valley degrees of freedom , which permits , for instance , to manipulate spins by means of circularly polarized light.@xcite moreover , in mose@xmath0 , a transition between a direct to an indirect gap was observed as a function of temperature.@xcite    on the theoretical level , the description of its low - energy electronic properties is enormously facilitated by the the availability of a paradigmatic hamiltonian model for the single - layer in terms of few tight - binding ( tb ) parameters@xcite ( actually only one , the nearest neighbors carbon - carbon hopping @xmath4 , in the simplest case).@xcite the well - known dirac equation can thus be derived from that as a low - energy expansion .",
    "crucial to the development of the theoretical analysis in graphene is also the fact that model hamiltonians for multilayer graphenes can be built using the single - layer tb description as a fundamental block and just adding additional interlayer hopping terms.@xcite different stacking orders can be also easily investigated .",
    "the advantage of such tight - binding description with respect to first - principles calculations is that it provides a simple starting point for the further inclusion of many - body electron - electron effects by means of quantum field theory ( qft ) techniques , as well as of the dynamical effects of the electron - lattice interaction .",
    "tight - binding approaches can be also more convenient than first - principles methods such as density functional theory ( dft ) for investigating systems involving a very large number of atoms .",
    "although dft methods are currently able to handle systems with hundreds or even thousands of atoms@xcite , and have been thoroughly applied to large scale graphene - related problems@xcite , they are still computationally challenging and demanding .",
    "therefore , tb has been the method of choice for the study of disordered and inhomogeneous systems@xcite materials nanostructured in large scales ( nanoribbons , ripples)@xcite or in twisted multilayer materials.@xcite    while much of the theoretical work of graphenic materials has been based on tight - binding - like approaches , the electronic properties of single - layer and few - layer dichalcogenides have been so far mainly investigated by means of dft calculations.@xcite , despite early work in non - orthogonal tight binding models for transition metal dichalcogenides.@xcite few simplified low - energy hamiltonian models has been presented for these materials , whose validity is however restricted to the specific case of single - layer systems .",
    "an effective low - energy model was for instance introduced in refs . to discuss the spin / orbital / valley coupling at the k point .",
    "being limited to the vicinity of the k point , such model can not be easily generalized to the multilayer case where the gap is indirect with valence and conduction edges located far from the k point .",
    "an effective lattice tb hamiltonian was on the other hand proposed in refs .",
    ", valid in principle in the whole brillouin zone .",
    "however , the band structure of the single - layer lacks the characteristic second minimum in the conduction band ( see later discussion ) that will become the effective conduction edge in multilayer systems , so that also in this case the generalization to the multilayer compounds is doubtful .",
    "in addition , the use of an overlap matrix makes the proposed hamiltonian unsuitable for a straightforward use as a basis for qft analyses .",
    "this is also the case for a recent model proposed in ref . , where the large number ( ninetysix ) of free fitting parameters and the presence of overlap matrix make such model inappropriate for practical use within the context of quantum field theory .",
    "in this paper we present a suitable tight - binding model for the dichalcogenides valid both in the single - layer case and in the multilayer one . using a slater - koster approach,@xcite and focusing on mos@xmath0 as a representative case",
    ", we analyze the orbital character of the electronic states at the relevant high - symmetry points . within this context",
    "we show that the transition from a direct gap to an indirect gap in mos@xmath0 as a function of the number of layers can be understood and reproduced in a natural way as a consequence of a momentum / orbital selective interlayer splitting of the main relevant energy levels .",
    "in particular , we show that the @xmath5 orbital of the s atoms plays a pivotal role in such transition and it can not be neglected in reliable tight - binding models aimed to describe single - layer as well as multi - layer systems . the tight - binding description here introduced can represent thus the paradigmatic model for the analysis of the electronic properties in multilayer systems in terms of intra - layer ligands plus a finite number of interlayer hopping terms . such tight - binding model , within the context of the slater - koster approach , provides also a suitable tool to include in an analytical and intuitive way effects of pressure / strain by means of the modulation of the interatomic distances . the present analysis defines , in addition , the minimum constraints that the model has to fulfill to guarantee a correct description of the band structure of multi - layer compounds .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in section [ s : dft ] we present dft calculations for single - layer and multi - layer ( bulk ) mos@xmath0 , which will be here used as a reference for the construction of a tight - binding model . in section [ s:1l ]",
    "we describe the minimum tight - binding model for the single - layer case needed to reproduce the fundamental electronic properties and the necessary orbital content . the decomposition of the hamiltonian in blocks and the specific orbital character at the high - symmetry points is discussed .",
    "the extension of the tight - binding model to the bulk case , taken as representative of multilayer compounds , is addressed in section [ s : bulk ] .",
    "we pay special attention to reveal the microscopic origin of the change between a direct - gap to indirect - gap band structure . in section [",
    "s : disc ] we summarize the implications of our analysis in the building of a reliable tight - binding model , and we provide a possible set of tight - binding parameters for the single - layer and multilayer case .",
    "in the construction of a reliable tb model for semiconducting dichalcogenides we will be guided by first - principles dft calculations taht will provide the reference on which to calibrate the tb model .",
    "we will focus here on mos@xmath0 as a representative case , although we have performed first - principle calculations for comparison also on ws@xmath0 .",
    "the differences in the electronic structure and in the orbital character of these two compounds are , however , minimal and they do not involve any different physics . the structure of single - layer and multilayer mos@xmath0 is depicted in fig .",
    "[ f - structure ] .",

    "we denote @xmath6 as the distance between nearest neighbor in - plane mo - mo and s - s distances , @xmath7 as the nearest neighbor mo - s distance and @xmath8 as the distance between the mo and s planes . the mos@xmath0 crystal forms an almost perfect trigonal prism structure with @xmath7 and",
    "@xmath8 very close to the their ideal values @xmath9 and @xmath10 . in our dft calculations ,",

    "the in - plane brillouin zone is thus characterized by the high - symmetry points @xmath15 , k@xmath16 , and m@xmath17 .",

    "the electronic dispersion for the single - layer mos@xmath0 is nowadays well known .",

    "as we will see , thus , the inclusion of the @xmath5 orbitals in the full tight - binding hamiltonian is not only desirable for a more complete description , but it is also _ unavoidable _ to understand the evolution of the band structure as a function of the number of layers .",

    "further distant atomic bonds , in single - layer systems , start from hopping between second nearest neighbor mo - s atoms , with interatomic distance @xmath77  , and they will be here discarded .",

    "( [ hmatr11 ] ) , in two main blocks , with different symmetry with respect to the mirror inversion @xmath115.@xcite this task is accomplished by introducing a symmetric and antisymmetric linear combination of the @xmath28 orbital of the s atoms on the top / bottom layers .",
    "more explicitly , we use the basis vector    @xmath116    where @xmath117 , @xmath118 . note that our basis differs slightly with respect to the one employed in ref . because we have introduced explicitly the proper normalization factors to make it unitary . in this basis",
    "we can write thus @xmath119 where @xmath120 is a @xmath121 block with even ( e ) symmetry with respect to the mirror inversion @xmath115 , and @xmath122 a @xmath123 block with odd ( o ) symmetry .",
    "we should remark however that such decoupling holds true only in the single - layer case and only in the absence of a @xmath31-axis electric field , as it can be induced by substrates or under gating conditions . in the construction of a tight - binding model that could permit a direct generalization to the multilayer case",
    ", the interaction between the band blocks with even and odd symmetry should be thus explicitly retained .",
    "the association between dft energy levels and tight - binding eigenstates is now further simplified on specific high - symmetry points of the brillouin zone .",
    "most important are the @xmath124 and the @xmath61 points , which are strictly associated with the direct and indirect gap in monolayer and multilayered compounds .",
    "we present here a detailed analysis of the eigenstates and their orbital character at the @xmath61 point .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , we discuss separately the blocks with even and odd symmetry with respect to the inversion @xmath115 .",
    "the identification of the dft levels with the tight - binding eigenstates is facilitated by the possibility of decomposing the full hamiltonian in smaller blocks , with typical size @xmath125 ( dimers ) or @xmath126 ( monomers ) .",
    "in particular , the @xmath121 block with even symmetry can be decomposed ( see appendix [ app_blocks ] for details ) as : @xmath127 here each matrix , @xmath128 , @xmath129 represents a @xmath130 block where the indices describe the orbital character of the dimer .",
    "in particular , @xmath128 involves only @xmath131 mo - orbitals and @xmath132 s - orbitals , whereas @xmath129 involves only the @xmath133 mo - orbital and the @xmath5 s - orbital .",
    "as it is evident in ( [ hgamma66 ] ) , the block @xmath128 appears twice and it is thus double degenerate .",
    "similarly , we have @xmath134 where the doubly degenerate block @xmath135 involves only @xmath136 mo - orbitals and @xmath132 s - orbitals , while @xmath137 is a @xmath126 block ( monomer ) with pure character @xmath5 .",

    "the suffix `` e '' here reminds that the level @xmath140 belongs to the even symmetry block , and it is useful to distinguish this state from a similar one with odd symmetry ( and different energy ) .",

    "the association between the dft energy levels and the tight - binding eigenstates is reported also for the k point in table [ t - block ] .      as discussed above ,",
    "another special point determining the electronic properties of mos@xmath0 is the q point , halfway between the @xmath61 and k points in the brillouin zone , where the conduction band , in the single - layer system , has a secondary minimum in addition to the absolute one at the k point .",
    "unfortunately , not being a point of high - symmetry , the tight - binding hamiltonian can not be decomposed in this case in simpler smaller blocks .",
    "each energy eigenvalue will contain thus a finite component of all the mo and s orbitals .",

    "a first interesting issue is about the minimum number of orbitals needed to be taken into account in a tight - binding model for a robust description of the electronic properties of these materials .",
    "a proper answer to such issue is , of course , different if referred to single - layer or multilayer compounds . for the moment we will focus only on the single - layer case but we will underline on the way the relevant features that will be needed to take into account in multi - layer systems .    in single - layer case , focusing only on the band edges determined by the states ( a ) and ( b ) at the k point",

    "a similar phenomenological model was proposed in ref . . however , the full microscopic description here exposed permits to point out the inconsistency of such a model .",

    ", no direct gap can be possibly established in this framework .",
    "it is worth to mention that a spin - orbit coupling can certainly split the dirac cone to produce a direct gap at the k point , but it would not explain in any case the direct gap observed in the dft calculations without spin - orbit coupling .    we should also mention that , in the same reduced 3-band model keeping only the @xmath25 and @xmath19 mo orbitals , the secondary maximum ( c ) of the valence band would have a pure @xmath25 orbital character .",
    "as we are going to see in the discussion concerning the multilayer samples , this would have important consequences on the construction of a proper tight - binding model .    a final consideration concerns the orbital character of the valence band edge , @xmath48 .",
    "this state is associated with the third @xmath125 block of ( [ hk66 ] ) and it results from the hybridization of the chiral state @xmath153 of the mo @xmath33 orbitals with the chiral state @xmath157 of the s @xmath28 orbitals .",

    "the possibility of such entanglement , dictated by group theory , was pointed out in ref . .",
    "a similar feature is found for the conduction band edge , @xmath47 .",
    "so far , this state has been assumed to be mainly characterized by the @xmath55 , and hence without an orbital moment . however , as we can see , this is true only for the mo @xmath33 part , whereas the s @xmath28 component does contain a finite chiral moment . on the other hand , the spin - orbit associated with the s atoms as well as with other chalcogenides ( ex . : se ) is quite small , and taking into account also the small orbital s weight , the possibility of a direct probe of such orbital moment is still to be explored .",
    "in the previous section we have examined in detail the content of the orbital character in the main high - symmetry points of the brillouin zone of the single - layer mos@xmath0 , to provide theoretical constraints on the construction of a suitable tight - binding model .",
    "focusing on the low - energy excitations close to the direct gap at the k point , we have seen that a proper model must take into account at least the three mo orbitals @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 and the two s orbitals @xmath95 , @xmath59 . on the other hand ,",
    "our wider aim is to introduce a tight - binding model for the single - layer that would be the basilar ingredient for a tight - binding model in _ multilayer _ systems , simply adding the interlayer coupling .    for the sake of simplicity we focus here on the bulk 2h - mos@xmath0 structure as a representative case that contains already all the ingredients of the physics of multilayer compounds .",
    "the band structure for the bulk compound is shown in fig .",
    "[ f - bandsdftmos2bulk ] .",
    "as it is known , the secondary maximum ( c ) of valence band at the @xmath61 point is shifted to higher energies in multilayer systems with respect to the single - layer case , becoming the valence band maximum . at the same time",
    "also the secondary minimum ( d ) of the conduction band , roughly at the q point , is lowered in energy , becoming the conduction band minimum .",
    "all these changes result in a transition between a direct gap material in single - layer compounds to indirect gap systems in the multilayer case .",
    "although such intriguing feature has been discussed extensively and experimentally observed , the underlying mechanism has not been so far elucidated .",
    "we will show here that such topological transition of the band edges can be naturally explained within the context of a tight - binding model as a result of an orbital selective ( and hence momentum dependent ) band splitting induced by the interlayer hopping .",
    "the orbital content of the bulk band structure along the same high - symmetry lines as in the single - layer case is shown in fig .",
    "[ f - bandsdftmos2bulk ] .",
    "we will focus first on the k point , where the single - layer system has a direct gap .",
    "we note that the direct gap at k is hardly affected .",
    "the interlayer coupling produces just a very tiny splitting of the valence band edge @xmath48 , while the conduction band edge @xmath47 at k becomes doubly degenerate .",
    "things are radically different at the @xmath61 point . the analysis of the orbital weight @xmath55 in fig .",
    "[ f - bandsdftmos2bulk ] shows indeed that there is a sizable splitting of the @xmath39 level , of the order of @xmath173 ev",
    ". a bit more difficult to discern , because of the multi - orbital component , but still visible , is the splitting of the secondary minimum ( d ) of the conduction band in q. this is clearest detected by looking in fig .",
    "[ f - bandsdftmos2bulk ] at the @xmath19 and @xmath25 characters , which belong unically to the e block .",
    "one can thus estimate from dft a splitting of this level at the q point of @xmath174 ev .",
    "we are now going to see that all these features are consistent with a tight - binding construction where the interlayer hopping acts as an additional parameter with respect to the single - layer tight - binding model . from the tight - binding point of view , it is clear that the main processes to be included are the interlayer hoppings between the external s planes of each mos@xmath0 block .",
    "this shows once more the importance of including the s @xmath28 orbital in a reliable tight - binding model .",
    "moreover , for geometric reasons , one could expect that the interlayer hopping between the @xmath5 orbitals , pointing directly out - of - plane , would be dominant with respect to the interlayer hopping between @xmath95 , @xmath59 .",
    "this qualitative argument is supported by the dft results , which indeed report a big splitting of the @xmath39 level at the @xmath61 point , with a 27 % of @xmath5 component , but almost no splitting of the degenerate @xmath37 at @xmath175 ev , with 68 % component of @xmath58 , @xmath59 .",
    "we can quantify this situation within the tight - binding description by including explicitly the interlayer hopping between the @xmath28-orbitals of the s atoms in the outer planes of each mos@xmath0 layer , with interatomic distance @xmath176  ( see fig .",
    "[ f - structure ] ) .",
    "these processes will be parametrized in terms of the interlayer slater - koster ligands @xmath177 , @xmath178 .",
    "the hilbert space is now determined by a 22-fold vector , defined as : @xmath179 where @xmath180 represents the basis ( [ basistilde ] ) for the layer 1 , and @xmath181 the same quantity for the layer 2 .",
    "the corresponding hamiltonian , in the absence of interlayer hopping , would read thus : @xmath182 where @xmath183 , @xmath184 refer to the intralayer hamiltonian for the layer 1 and 2 , respectively .",
    "note that the hamiltonian of layer 2 in the 2h - mos@xmath0 structure is different with respect to the one of layer 1 . from a direct inspection",
    "we can see that the elements @xmath185 of layer 2 are related to the corresponding elements of layer 1 as : @xmath186 where @xmath187 , @xmath188 , and @xmath189 if the orbital @xmath68 has even symmetry for @xmath190 , and @xmath191 if it has odd symmetry .",
    "we note that both effects can be re - adsorbed in a different redefinition of the orbital basis so that the eigenvalues of @xmath184 are of course the same as the eigenvalues of @xmath183 .    taking into account the inter - layer s - s hopping terms , we can write thus : @xmath192 where @xmath193 is here the interlayer hopping hamiltonian , namely : @xmath194 where @xmath195 and @xmath196 @xmath197 @xmath198 @xmath199    the analytical expression of the elements @xmath200 as functions of the slater - koster interlayer parameters @xmath177 , @xmath178 is provided in appendix [ app_elements ] .",
    "note that , in the presence of interlayer hopping in the bulk mos@xmath0 , we can not divide anymore , for generic momentum @xmath99 , the @xmath201 hamiltonian in smaller blocks with even and odd symmetry with respect to the change @xmath115 .",
    "the analysis is however simplified at specific high - symmetry points of the brillouin zone .",
    "in particular , for @xmath202 ( @xmath203 ) , we can easily see from ( [ hperpbulk ] ) that the block @xmath204 ( @xmath205 ) with even symmetry and the block @xmath206 ( @xmath207 ) with odd symmetry are still decoupled .    exploiting this feature , we can now give a closer look at the high - symmetry points .",
    "in section [ s:1l ] we have seen that at the @xmath61 point the hamiltonian can be decomposed in @xmath125 blocks . particularly important here is the block @xmath208 whose upper eigenvalue @xmath39 , with main orbital character @xmath55 and a small @xmath5 component , represents the secondary maximum ( c ) of the valence band .",
    "a first important property to be stressed in bulk systems is that , within this ( mo @xmath65)+(s @xmath60 ) tight - binding model , the interlayer coupling at the @xmath61 point does not mix any additional orbital character .",
    "this can be seen by noticing that the interlayer matrix @xmath209 is diagonal at the @xmath61 point .",
    "focusing on the @xmath210 levels , we can write thus a @xmath211 reduced hamiltonian ( see appendix [ app_blocks ] ) : @xmath212 where @xmath213 represents the interlayer hopping mediated by @xmath177 , @xmath178 between @xmath5 orbitals belonging to the outer s planes on different layers .",
    "( [ hzd_0bulk ] ) is important because it shows that the qualitative idea that each energy level in the bulk system is just split by the interlayer hopping is well grounded . in particular , under the reasonable hypothesis that the interlayer hopping is much smaller than intralayer processes , denoting @xmath214 , @xmath215 the two eigenvalues with primary @xmath25 components , we get : @xmath216 \\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\gamma_{zz } \\left",

    "most important , tracking the dft levels by means of their orbital content , we can note that both levels @xmath220 and @xmath221 undergo a quite large splitting @xmath222 ev , and the level @xmath41 a splitting @xmath223 ev , whereas the levels @xmath217 , @xmath218 are almost unsplit .",
    "this observation strongly suggest that , as expected , the interlayer hopping between @xmath95 , @xmath59 orbitals is much less effective than the interlayer hopping between @xmath5 .",
    "similar conclusion can be drawn from the investigation of the energy levels at the k point , although the analysis is a bit more involved .",
    "the properties of the bulk system at the k point are dictated by the structure of the interlayer matrix @xmath209 which , in the basis defined in eq .",
    "( [ tilde2 ] ) , at the k point reads : @xmath224    as discussed in detail in appendix [ app_blocks ] , the electronic structure is made more transparent by using an appropriate chiral basis , which is a direct generalization of the one for the single - layer .",
    "we can thus write the even and odd parts of the resulting hamiltonian in the form : @xmath225 where    @xmath226    we can notice that eq .",
    "( [ epd_2bulk ] ) has the same structure as ( [ hzd_0bulk ] ) , with two @xmath125 degenerate sub - blocks hybridized by a non - diagonal element ( @xmath227 in this case ) .",
    "this results in a splitting of the single - layer levels @xmath228 , @xmath229 .",
    "the two levels @xmath230 , @xmath231 , by looking at their orbital character , can be identified in dft results in the small splitting of the ( b ) @xmath48 level , confirming once more the smallness of the interlayer @xmath36-@xmath36 hopping .",
    "less straightforward is the case of the @xmath232 block @xmath233 where the hybridization term @xmath234 mixes two different @xmath130 sub - blocks , @xmath163 and @xmath167 . in this case ,",
    "a mixing of the orbital character will result .",
    "we note , however , that the block @xmath233 appears twice in ( [ hebulk ] ) , so that each energy level will result double - degenerate , in particular the minimum ( a ) of the conduction band at k. note , however , that the negligible shift of such energy level in the dft calculations with respect to the single - layer case is an indication that also the interlayer hopping element @xmath235 , between @xmath5 on one layer and @xmath95 , @xmath59 on the other one , is negligible .",
    "an analytical insight on the electronic structure at the q point was not available in single - layer systems and it would be thus even more complicate in the bulk case .",
    "a few important considerations , concerning the minimum ( d ) , can be however drawn from the dft results .",
    "in particular , we note that in the single - layer case this energy level had a non - vanishing @xmath5 component . as we have seen above , the interlayer hopping between @xmath5 orbitals appears to be dominant with respect to the interlayer hopping between @xmath36 and @xmath36 and with respect to the mixed interlayer hopping @xmath5-@xmath36 .",
    "we can thus expect a finite sizable splitting of the ( d ) level , containing a finite @xmath5 component , with respect to the negligible energy shift of @xmath236 ( a ) , which depends on the mixed interlayer process @xmath235 .",
    "in the previous section we have elucidated , using a tight - binding model , the orbital character of the band structure of mos@xmath0 on the main high - symmetry points of the brillouin zone .",
    "we have shown how a reliable minimal model for the single - layer case needs to take into account at least the @xmath95 , @xmath59 orbitals of the s atoms in addition to the @xmath65 orbitals of mo .",
    "a careful inspection of the electronic structure shows also that the band edges at the k point defining the direct band gap in the single - layer case are characterized not only by a chiral order of the @xmath33 mo orbitals , as experimentally observed , but also by an entangled chiral order of the minor component of the @xmath36 s orbitals .",
    "an important role is also played by the @xmath5 orbitals of the s atoms . in single - layer systems ,",
    "the @xmath5 orbital character is particularly relevant in the ( c ) state , characterizing a secondary maximum in the valence band at the @xmath61 point , and in the ( d ) state , which instead provides a secondary minimum in the conduction band at the q point .",
    "the @xmath5 component becomes crucial in multilayer compounds where a comparison with dft results shows that the interlayer coupling is mainly driven by the @xmath5-@xmath5 hopping whereas @xmath36-@xmath237 @xmath5-@xmath36 are negligible .",
    "this results in an orbital - selective and momentum - dependent interlayer splitting of the energy levels , being larger for the ( c ) and ( d ) states and negligible for ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "this splitting is thus the fundamental mechanism responsible for the transition from a direct ( a)-(b ) gap in single - layer compounds to an indirect ( c)-(d ) gap in multilayer systems .",
    "controlling these processes is therefore of the highest importance for electronic applications .",
    "note that such direct / indirect gap switch is discussed here in terms of the number of layers . on the other hand ,",
    "the microscopical identification of such mechanism , which is essentially driven by the interlayer coupling , permits to understand on the physical ground the high sensitivity to pressure / strain effects , as well as to the temperature , via the lattice expansion .",
    "finally , in order to show at a quantitative level how the orbital content determines the evolution of the electronic structure from single - layer to multilayer compounds , we have performed a fitting procedure to determine the tight - binding parameters that best reproduce the dft bands within the model defined here .",
    "the task was divided in two steps : @xmath69 ) we first focus on the single - layer case to determine the relevant slater - koster intra - layer parameters in this case ; @xmath238 ) afterwards , keeping fixed the intralayer parameters , we determine the interlayer parameters . to this purpose",
    "we employ a simplex method@xcite to minimize a weighted mean square error @xmath239 between the tb and dft band energies , defined as @xmath240 ^ 2,\\ ] ] where @xmath241 is the dispersion on the @xmath69-th band of the 11 band block under consideration , @xmath242 the corresponding tight - binding description , and @xmath243 a band / momentum resolved weight which can be used to improve fitting over particular @xmath99-regions or over selected bands . in spite of many efforts , we could not find a reliable fit for the whole electronic structure including the seven valence bands and the four lowest conduction bands.@xcite as our analysis and our main objective concerns the description of the valence and conduction bands that define the band gap of these systems , we focus on finding a set of parameters that describe properly these bands .",
    "since both the lowest conduction and highest valence band belong to the electronic states with even @xmath115 symmetry , the fit was performed in the @xmath121 orbital space defined by this symmetry .",
