    "in current theories of cosmological structure formation , the cold dark matter and baryon fluid undergoes gravitational collapse , leading to virialized filaments and roughly spherical `` halos '' on a variety of scales .",
    "collisionless shocks play a critical role in this process by converting the kinetic energy of in - falling baryonic material to thermal energy .",
    "this heating leads to large reservoirs of @xmath0 gas that fills and surrounds massive structures , directly tracing the formation and evolution of cosmic structure .",
    "observational probes of this gas are generally sensitive only to the electron component of the plasma .",
    "typically , theoretical studies assume that the electrons are in thermal equilibrium with the surrounding ions . however , this is not a good approximation in the low - density outskirts of galaxy clusters due to the extended timescale for electrons to reach equilibrium via coulomb collisions @xcite . in the pre - shock intergalactic medium , the bulk of the kinetic energy",
    "is carried by the heavier ions .",
    "since the electrons and ions are only weakly coupled , this leads to an electron temperature in the post - shock plasma that is significantly lower than that of ions .",
    "the post - shock electrons and ions gradually relax to a single equilibrium temperature .",
    "the low emissivity of gas at densities of @xmath1 has heretofore limited x - ray spectroscopic temperature measurements to regions where electrons are expected to have reached equilibrium @xcite .",
    "advances in the sensitivity of x - ray instruments are pushing the limit of icm temperature measurements to a significant fraction of the virial radius ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "such measurements remain expensive with the current generation of instruments , however .    in recent years the thermal sunyaev zeldovich effect ( sze ) has been suggested as a possible probe of gas in this phase ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , due to its weaker density dependence .",
    "observations using the next generation of sz experiments are ongoing , and are expected to provide accurate measurements of the electron pressure beyond the virial radius .",
    "large samples of massive clusters with profile measurements beyond the virial radius should therefore become available in the near future .",
    "in this work we consider the impact of the two - temperature structure of the intracluster medium ( icm ) on the thermal sze .",
    "we employ high resolution simulations of clusters which improve on previous studies @xcite by combining the efficient shock - capturing properties of eulerian adaptive mesh refinement with high mass and spatial resolution such that both the large - scale accretion shocks and internal , merger - driven shocks are well captured .",
    "we show that the lower electron temperature in the cluster outskirts leads to a significant underestimate of the gas pressure when derived through the sze .",
    "we also demonstrate that the two - temperature structure of the icm is sensitive to recent accretion history through internal merger - driven shocks and discuss the relative importance of these shocks to the sze .",
    "the simulations were performed using the art code @xcite , which was modified to model a two temperature electron - ion plasma .",
    "following @xcite , we divide the plasma into two components , electrons and ions , which are assumed to be individually in local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) with separate maxwellian velocity distributions defined by temperatures @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "the separation into only two species , electrons and ions , each in separate equilibrium is reasonable , since the self - equilibration timescales for each specie , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , are considerably shorter than the electron - ion equilibration timescale , @xmath6 @xcite .. ] when an electron - ion plasma passes through a shock , most of the kinetic energy goes into heating the heavier ions , causing @xmath7 . after the shock ,",
    "electrons and ions slowly equilibrate via coulomb interactions , each converging to the mean gas temperature , @xmath8 , over a typical electron - ion equilibration timescale , @xmath6 .",
    "the evolution of the electron temperature is given by , @xmath9 where the second term accounts for adiabatic compression heating and cooling .",
    "the timescale for equipartition between two charged species is given by @xcite , @xmath10 where @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 are the mass , temperature , and charge of each specie , respectively , @xmath14 is the number density , and @xmath15 is the coulomb logarithm . for the fully ionized icm ,",
    "including contributions from both protons and he@xmath16 , the timescale for equilibration is , @xmath17 note that this timescale can be comparable to the hubble time in regions with @xmath18  k and overdensities @xmath19 with respect to the cosmic mean .",
    "while our model assumes negligible electron heating within shocks , some non - adiabatic heating due to plasma instabilities is likely .",
    "however , theoretical expectations for the amount and source of electron heating in these shocks vary widely ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * for a recent review ) , ranging from a constant fraction @xmath20 of the pre - shock kinetic energy @xcite to a constant post - shock electron temperature and inverse - square scaling with shock velocity @xmath21 @xcite . in either case",
    "we expect the electron heating in the high mach number accretion shocks to be small .",
    "there are some indications of more rapid electron equilibration in shocks with lower mach number in the icm @xcite , however , the process is not yet well constrained by observations to date",

    "the recent mergers in cl101 generate both internal and external shocks , and these shocks are responsible for the significant quantity of non - equilibrium electrons throughout the cluster .",
    "non - equilibrium electrons are found mostly in the cluster outskirts for the relaxed systems ( cl104 and cl6 ) , and electrons and ions in the inner regions are mostly in equilibrium .",

    "the electron temperature becomes increasingly smaller than the mean gas temperature , and the magnitude of the bias is inversely proportional to the icm temperature : @xmath2 is biased low by 5% at @xmath39 for cl104 and @xmath40 for cl6 .",
    "the bias reaches its maximum at the virial shock , @xmath41 r_{200}$ ] . beyond the shock radius ,",
    "electrons and ions in the unshocked gas are largely in equilibrium , with a slight departure from equilibrium due to the accretion shocks of large - scale filaments .",

    "the non - equilibrium electrons at small radius are primarily generated by internal shocks associated with the recent merger ( see also figure  [ figure : projected ] ) .",
    "production of non - equilibrium electrons by internal shocks within the virialized regions of clusters is illustrated in figure  [ figure : evolution ] , which shows the evolution of @xmath33 for cl6 during the period immediately following a nearly equal mass merger around @xmath25 ( see also figures  1 and 2 in * ? ? ?",
    "the final coalescence generates a strong internal shock which propagates out from the cluster center exciting a thin , trailing layer of non - equilibrium electrons .",
    "although at fixed radius this is a transient phenomenon , lasting for only about @xmath46 due to the short equilibration timescale within the high - density icm , the shock propagation occurs on a dynamical timescale .",
    "this leads to non - equilibrium electrons in the cluster center for @xmath47 during the merger .",
    "these internal shocks can therefore introduce a significant temperature bias on considerably smaller scales than the accretion shocks .",
    "the suppression of the electron temperature also leads to a bias in the hydrostatic mass estimate , @xmath48 , as shown in figure  [ figure : hydrostatic ] .",
    "we follow the procedure described in @xcite for computing the hydrostatic mass profiles .",
    "briefly , we reduce spurious fluctuations in the numerical derivatives by removing gas in bound substructures and then smooth the resulting profile with a savitzky - golay filter . at small scales , @xmath49 , the deviation from the hydrostatic mass estimated",
    "using @xmath37 is small for all three clusters , and remains @xmath50 for the relaxed clusters out to @xmath51 .",
    "the bias in the hydrostatic mass is quite large for clusters undergoing recent major mergers ( e.g. , cl101 ) , where the hydrostatic mass is underestimated by @xmath52 in the radial range @xmath53~r_{200}$ ] .",
    "note that this effect is in addition to the bias introduced by the non - thermal pressure due to random gas motions @xcite .",
    "these biases in temperature due to non - equilibrium electrons have important implications for the interpretation of sunyaev - zeldovich effect ( sze ) observations .",
    "this is illustrated in the bottom panel of figure  [ figure : profiles ] , which shows that the presence of non - equilibrium electrons leads to significant suppression of the sze signal at large cluster - centric radius .",
    "we define the bias to be the ratio of the compton - y parameters , defined as @xmath54 , computed alternately using @xmath2 and @xmath37 .",
    "again the bias is largest for the unrelaxed system , and is as large as @xmath55 in the radial range @xmath56r_{200}$ ] .",
    "the bias is more moderate ( @xmath57 ) for the other two relaxed systems in a similar radial range .",
    "the integrated compton - y parameter , @xmath58 ( or sz flux ) , is also affected by the non - equilibrium electrons .",
    "but , the biases are much smaller since the effect is averaged over the entire cluster and is dominated by the central regions where electrons are in equilibrium .",
    "examining the evolution of the bias in @xmath58 within the spherical region of @xmath59 for all three simulated clusters , we find the bias is no larger than 6% , which occurs during periods of major mergers ( e.g. , cl101 since the last major merger at @xmath60 or cl6 at @xmath61 as shown in fig  [ figure : evolution ] ) .",
    "the bias reaches 9% during the same period when measured within the larger radius , @xmath62 .",
    "this process may also affect the scatter in the mass - observable relations . at various times during the last cl101 merger , however , the cluster lies both above and below the mean y - m relation , while the bias due to non - equilibrium electrons always acts to suppress the sz signal .",
    "large samples of simulated clusters are therefore needed to adequately address this effect . for comparison , we computed the bias in x - ray spectroscopic temperature using the _ spectroscopic - like _ formula of @xcite .",
    "the resulting bias is negligible , even during mergers , since it is strongly weighted to gas at higher densities and correspondingly shorter @xmath6 .",
    "we use simulations of cosmological cluster formation to explore the two temperature structure of the icm and its effects on the sunyaev - zeldovich effect .",
    "we show that electron temperatures are lower than the ion ( or mean gas ) temperature in the low - density outskirts of galaxy clusters , where coulomb collisions are insufficient to keep electrons and ions in thermal equilibrium .",
    "this leads to a decrease in the sze relative to predictions which assume electron - ion equilibrium .",
    "the suppression of electron pressure in turn leads to an underestimate of the hydrostatic mass .",
    "our simulations also show that the magnitude of the non - equipartition between electrons and ions depends sensitively on the cluster dynamical state .",
    "the electron temperature ( or pressure ) is smaller than the mean gas temperature by about 5% at @xmath39 for relaxed clusters , but the bias could be as large as 30% for unrelaxed systems , in which populations of non - equilibrium electrons are created within the virial regions of cluster by internal , merger - driven shocks .",
    "although these are short - lived in the high - density icm , these non - equilibrium electrons can affect global properties , such as the integrated compton - y or the mass weighted temperature , by about 5% .",
    "x - ray spectroscopic temperature , on the other hand , is not significantly affected even during the merger periods , since it is strongly weighted to gas at higher densities and correspondingly shorter @xmath6 .",
    "these biases are the sources of systematic uncertainties that will need to be taken into account for the interpretation of upcoming large - scale sze experiments , including act , planck , and spt .",
    "we lastly note that the details of electron equilibration will affect the ability to detect virial shocks using the sz @xcite by smoothing the electron temperature profile in the region of the shock .",
    "successful detections of accretion shocks by alma can be used to place strong constraints on the otherwise uncertain physics operating at these shocks .",
    "we will explore this possibility in an upcoming paper .",
