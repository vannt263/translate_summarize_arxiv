    "there have been several attempts to incorporate the present stage of cosmic acceleration into standard cosmology , the most notably being the introduction of an `` exotic '' matter termed dark energy ( de ) which is believed to have a huge negative pressure , however , its nature and origin is still a mystery despite extensive research over the past one and a half decades .",
    "several de models have been proposed in the literature but observational data from various sources such as supernovae type ia ( sne ia ) , cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , and baryon accoustic oscillations ( bao ) have established that the cosmological constant @xmath13 is the most viable candidate among them .",
    "the cosmic concordance @xmath13cdm model in which the universe is believed to contain a cosmological constant @xmath13 associated with de , and cold ( i.e. , pressureless ) dark matter ( abbreviated cdm ) fits rather well the current astronomical data .",
    "nevertheless , there are severe drawbacks corresponding to a finite but incredibly small value of @xmath13 such as the fine - tuning problem which leads to a discrepancy of @xmath14 to @xmath15 orders of magnitude with respect to its observed value which is about @xmath16 . then there is the coincidence problem which is related to the question of `` why are the energy densities of pressureless matter and de of the same order precisely at the present epoch although they evolve so differently with expansion ? ''",
    "several models such as decaying vacuum models , interacting scalar field descriptions of de , and a single fluid model with an antifriction dynamics have been proposed with a view to alleviate such problems .",
    "moreover , in order to solve the flatness and horizon problems , an inflationary stage for the very early universe was introduced but this again gave rise to several new problems , like the initial conditions , the graceful exit , and multiverse problems .",
    "other attempts to explain the late time accelerating stage are modified gravity models , inhomogeneous cosmological models etc . but",
    "each one of them comes with several problems that are yet to be settled . because of these said difficulties in various cosmological models ,",
    "another well known proposal has been suggested  the gravitationally induced particle creation mechanism .",
    "schrodinger @xcite pioneered the microscopic description of such a mechanism which was further developed by parker and others based on quantum field theory in curved spacetimes @xcite .",
    "prigogine and collaborators @xcite provided a macroscopic description of particle creation mechanism induced by the gravitational field .",
    "a covariant description was later proposed @xcite and the physical difference between particle creation and bulk viscosity was clarified @xcite .",
    "the process of particle creation is classically described by introducing a backreaction term in the einstein field equations whose negative pressure may provide a self - sustained mechanism of cosmic acceleration . indeed , many phenomenological particle creation models have been proposed in the literature @xcite .",
    "it has also been shown that phenomenological particle production @xcite can not only incorporate the late time cosmic acceleration but also provide a viable alternative to the concordance @xmath13cdm model .    despite rigorous investigation of various aspects of particle creation mechanism ,",
    "its thermodynamic implications have never been explored .",
    "such a study has been undertaken in this paper and the essence of this work is that the particle creation rate has been considered arbitrary , not a phenomenological one .",
    "the conclusions drawn from the present analysis are valid for any expression of the creation rate , constant or otherwise .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 contains a brief discussion of the gravitationally induced adiabatic particle creation scenario , section 3 along with subsections a , b , and c are dedicated to detailed thermodynamic analysis of the process , while section 4 provides a short discussion and possible scope for future work .",
    "let us consider a spatially flat , homogeneous and isotropic friedmann - lemaitre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) universe with matter content endowed with the mechanism of particle creation .",
    "the dynamics of such a model is governed by the friedman equations given by , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 , as well as @xmath20 are unity . ]",
    "@xmath21 in the above equations , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the energy density and thermostatic pressure of the cosmic fluid respectively and they are related by the equation of state ( eos ) @xmath3 with @xmath4 , @xmath24 is the hubble parameter [ @xmath25 is the scale factor of the universe ] , and @xmath26 is the creation pressure related to the gravitationally induced process of particle creation .",
    "the lower bound on @xmath27 ensures that the perfect fluid does not become exotic , or equivalently , the strong energy condition remains valid . as a consequence ,",
    "the energy conservation law gets reduced to @xmath28    now , the non - conservation of the total number @xmath29 of particles in an open thermodynamic system produces an equation given by @xmath30 in eqs .",
    "( [ ece ] ) and ( [ pce ] ) , @xmath31 is the fluid expansion scalar which turns out to be @xmath32 in our case , @xmath2 denotes the rate of change of the number of particles ( @xmath33 ) in a comoving volume @xmath34 , and @xmath35 is the number density of particles .",
    "so , a positive @xmath2 implies production of particles while a negative @xmath2 indicates particle annihilation .",
    "further , a non - zero @xmath2 produces an effective bulk viscous pressure @xcite of the fluid and hence non - equilibrium thermodynamics comes into the picture .    using eqs .",
    "( [ ece ] ) and ( [ pce ] ) , and the gibb s relation @xmath36 we can obtain an equation relating the creation pressure @xmath26 and the creation rate @xmath2 , which can be expressed as @xmath37 under the customary assumption that the specific entropy @xmath38 ( in other words , the entropy per particle ) is constant , i.e. , the process is adiabatic ( or isentropic ) .",
    "thus , a dissipative fluid is equivalent to a perfect fluid with a non - conserved particle number .",
    "( [ fr2 ] ) now reduces to @xmath39    the deceleration parameter @xmath40 takes the form @xmath41 and the effective eos parameter for this model ( denoted by @xmath42 ) becomes @xmath43 which represents quintessence era for @xmath44 and phantom era for @xmath45 , while @xmath46 corresponds to a cosmological constant , owing to the fact that @xmath47 .",
    "in the following subsections , we shall study the first law , the generalized second law ( gsl ) , and thermodynamic equilibrium for an arbitrary particle creation rate @xmath2 .",
    "we shall consider an apparent horizon as our thermodynamic boundary , since , unlike the event horizon , a cosmic apparent horizon always exists and it coincides with the event horizon in the case of a last de sitter expansion .",
    "moreover , in a flat flrw universe , the apparent horizon coincides with the hubble horizon @xmath48 .",
    "so , the apparent horizon can be considered to be located at @xmath49 and its first order derivative with respect to the cosmic time @xmath50 can be evaluated as @xmath51 the ( bekenstein ) entropy and ( hawking ) temperature of the apparent horizon are given by @xmath52 and @xmath53 respectively .",
    "the first law of thermodynamics at the horizon is governed by the clausius relation @xmath54 the differential @xmath55 of the amount of energy crossing the apparent horizon can be evaluated as ( see eq . ( 27 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath56    again , using the expressions of @xmath57 and @xmath58 given in eqs .",
    "( [ sa ] ) and ( [ ta ] ) , the expression @xmath59 becomes @xmath60 where we have used relation ( [ dra ] ) .    from the above analysis",
    ", we find that the first law holds at the apparent horizon whenever @xmath61 , or loosely speaking , whenever @xmath62 .",
    "according to thermodynamics , the equilibrium configuration of an isolated macroscopic physical system should be the maximum entropy state , consistent with the constraints imposed on the system .",
    "thus if @xmath63 is the total entropy of the system , the following conditions should hold  ( a ) @xmath64 [ i.e. , the entropy function can not decrease ( the second law of thermodynamics ) ] , and ( b ) @xmath65 [ i.e. , the entropy function attains a maximum ( thermodynamic equilibrium ) ] . in our context , the universe bounded by an apparent horizon and filled with some cosmic fluid forms an isolated macroscopic physical system for which the above inequalities can be generalized as @xmath66 respectively , where @xmath67 is the entropy of the cosmic fluid contained within the horizon . the inequality ( i )",
    "is sometimes called the gsl .",
    "the gibb s equation can be rewritten in the form @xmath68 where @xmath5 is the temperature of the cosmic fluid respectively , and @xmath69 is the energy of the fluid .",
    "now , the assumption of a constant specific entropy leads us to an evolution equation for the fluid temperature given by ( see the second relation in eq .",
    "( 35 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath70 noting from eq .",
    "( [ dh / doth ] ) that @xmath71 , the above equation leads to the integral @xmath72 on integration , we obtain , @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the constant of integration . note",
    "that @xmath2 does not appear explicitly in the equation .",
    "( [ geq ] ) , the differential of the fluid entropy can be obtained in the following form : @xmath75 the differential of the total entropy can then be evaluated as @xmath76dt.\\ ] ] it can be easily seen from the previous equation that gsl holds if @xmath77 , or equivalently , if @xmath7 . therefore , the gsl is not consistent with the phantom fluid .",
    "furthermore , @xmath78 is a constant of motion when @xmath46 , i.e. , when @xmath47 , a cosmological constant .",
    "another remarkable fact is that eq .",
    "( [ st ] ) gives us an opportunity [ by replacing @xmath79 by @xmath80 and using eq .",

    "( [ sth ] ) lies in the fact that the particle creation rate @xmath2 does not occur explicitly in the equation . requiring that the total entropy be always positive , we can ,",

    "( [ to ] ) implies that we can also impose a lower bound on the fluid temperature @xmath5 as @xmath85 for radiation era ( i.e. , @xmath86 ) and matter dominated era ( i.e. , @xmath87 ) , the lower bounds on @xmath5 become @xmath88 and @xmath89 respectively . using maple software ,",

    "thus , thermodynamic equilibrium in this case is inconsistent with the cosmological constant as well as the phantom fluid .    from different observational sources",
    ", it has been well established that the radiation phase was followed by a matter dominated era which eventually transited to a second de sitter phase .",
    "accordingly , it can be expected that in the radiation dominated era , the entropy increased but the thermodynamic equilibrium was not achieved @xcite .",
    "if this were not true , the universe would have attained a state of maximum entropy and would have stayed in it forever unless acted upon by some `` external agent . ''",
    "however , it is a well known fact @xcite that the production of particles was suppressed during the radiation phase , so in this model , there would be no external agent to remove the system from thermodynamic equilibrium",
