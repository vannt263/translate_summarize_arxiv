    "quantum coin flipping ( qcf ) @xcite , a.k.a . quantum coin tossing , is aimed to provide a method for two separated parties alice and bob to generate a random bit value @xmath0 or @xmath1 remotely , while they do not trust each other .",
    "if the parties have opposite desired values , e.g. , alice wants @xmath2 while bob wants @xmath3 , then it is called weak qcf . or",
    "if their desired values are random , then it is called strong qcf . here",
    "we concentrate on strong qcf only .",
    "such a qcf protocol is considered secure if neither party can bias the outcome , so that @xmath0 and @xmath3 will both occur with the equal probability @xmath4 , just as if they are tossing an ideal fair coin .",
    "qcf is an essential element of cheat - sensitive protocols qi150,qi442,hesr .",
    "it is also closely related with quantum bit commitment ( qbc ) and quantum oblivious transfer @xcite , which are the building blocks for more complicated quantum multi - party secure computation protocols @xcite .",
    "however , it is widely believed that unconditionally secure qcf is impossible .",
    "more rigorously , let @xmath5 denote the bias of a qcf protocol , such that the dishonest party can force the outcome @xmath0 or @xmath3 to occur with probability @xmath6 .",
    "unconditional security requires that @xmath5 should be able to be made arbitrarily small by increasing some parameters in the protocol , without relying on any computational assumption or experimental constraint .",
    "but there were proofs claiming that this can never be achieved .",
    "instead , a lower bound of the bias exists , which is @xmath7 @xcite , qi58,qbc46,qi145,qi146,qi76,qi817,qbc37,qbc54,qi246,qbc132,qbc19,qbc106,qbc112 .",
    "these no - go proofs are considered as casting very serious doubt on the security of quantum cryptography in the so - called post - cold - war  applications @xcite .",
    "all previously proposed qcf protocols ( e.g. , refs .",
    "qi132,qi148,qbc29,qbc76,qbc81,qbc117,qbc131  and the references therein ) are , unfortunately , limited by this bound .",
    "nevertheless , we find that this negative result is not sufficiently general to cover all qcf protocols . here",
    "we will propose an unconditionally secure qcf protocol , and show one - by - one why the no - go proofs @xcite , qi58,qbc46,qi145,qi146,qi76,qi817,qbc37,qbc54,qi246,qbc132,qbc19,qbc106,qbc112 fail to apply to our protocol .",
    "since it is an important theoretical problem whether unconditionally secure qcf exists in principle , here for simplicity , we only consider the ideal case without practical imperfections , such as transmission errors , detection loss or dark counts , etc .",
    "let us denote the state of a qubit as @xmath8 , where @xmath9 indicates the basis while @xmath10 distinguishes the two orthogonal states in the same basis .",
    "that is , @xmath11 and @xmath12  are the eigenstates of the @xmath13  basis , while @xmath14 and @xmath15  are the eigenstates of the @xmath16  basis .",
    "our protocol is built around the solutions to the following problem .",
    "_ lie - detecting problem : _",
    "alice sends bob @xmath17 qubits @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "then bob announces his fake  measurement result @xmath20 for each @xmath18 , which is allowed to be different from his actual measurement result @xmath21 .",
    "that is , it can be either of the following three types of lies : @xmath22    now the question is : how many lies can alice detect ?",
    "more precisely , suppose that types @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 lies occur with frequencies @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively .",
    "our task is to express the total number of alice s detected lies with the parameters @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath17 .",
    "note that it does not matter bob measures each qubit before or after he announces @xmath29 .",
    "even if he announced without measuring it , he can still measure it later and obtain @xmath30 , then compares it with @xmath31 to learn the type of lies that it belongs to . in this case , if @xmath32  is randomly chosen , then the values of @xmath33 and @xmath34  do not have a fixed relationship with @xmath32 and @xmath35 , which is equivalent to announcing a type @xmath23 , @xmath24 or @xmath25 lie or a honestly result with the equal probability @xmath36 .",
    "else if bob chooses @xmath37  ( @xmath38 ) , then the type @xmath23 lie and the honest result ( the type @xmath24 and @xmath25  lies ) occur with the equal probability @xmath4 .",
    "either way , bob is still able to control the values of @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "meanwhile , from alice s point of view , some lies can be identified even though bob has not measured .",
    "for example , if bob announces @xmath39 while alice knows that she actually sent @xmath40 , she knows for sure that this @xmath41 must be a lie no matter bob has performed the measurement or not .",
    "when bob has not measured the corresponding @xmath18 , this result means that even if he later decides to measure it in the basis @xmath42  honestly , he can only obtain @xmath43 so that his announced @xmath44 ends up as a type @xmath23 lie .",
    "else if he uses @xmath45 as the measurement basis , then @xmath46 will inevitably become a type @xmath24 or @xmath25  lie . in any case , he can never obtain the result @xmath47 so that he can not make @xmath46 an honest announcement . therefore , alice can detect lies as usual even if bob delays his measurement .      a very intuitive and ordinary solution of the problem is as follows .    _ the state _ :",
    "alice determines the values of @xmath48 and @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) beforehand , and prepares the initial state of each @xmath18 as a pure state @xmath51 non - entangled with any other system .",
    "_ lie - detecting strategy _ : after bob announced @xmath46 , alice compares it with @xmath51 . whenever she finds @xmath52 while @xmath53 , she knows that bob told a lie .",
    "this is because in the ideal setting , once bob chose the basis @xmath32 correctly ( i.e. , it matches alice s @xmath48 ) , he should never find a wrong @xmath54 value in his measurement .",
    "thus if he announces @xmath55  as @xmath31 honestly , there should not be @xmath56 while @xmath57 .",
    "on the other hand , if @xmath58 alice will not be able to judge bob s announcement .",
    "this is because when bob chose the wrong basis to measure the qubit , any result is possible due to quantum uncertainty .",
    "_ result _ : the total number of lies that alice detected with this algorithm can be evaluated as follows .",
    "whenever bob did not lie , alice has no way to claim that he did .",
    "so we need to concentrate only on the qubits for which bob indeed lies . since bob chooses the actual measurement basis @xmath59 randomly , for about @xmath60 qubits bob will choose the correct basis @xmath61 by chance . among these qubits ,",
    "all type @xmath23 lies will inevitably be detected by alice , while no types @xmath24 and @xmath62 can be judged for the reason stated above .",
    "therefore alice finds about @xmath63  lies .",
    "meanwhile for the rest @xmath60 qubits which bob measured with the wrong basis @xmath64 , the probabilities of finding @xmath65  or @xmath66  are both @xmath4 .",
    "therefore when bob tells a type @xmath24 or @xmath25 lie , the announced basis @xmath67 becomes the correct basis so that the condition @xmath52 is satisfied , and @xmath56  occurs with probability @xmath4 .",
    "thus alice finds about @xmath68  lies . but",
    "no @xmath69 @xmath23 will be detected in this case since announcing @xmath70 will then be recognized by alice as the wrong basis . all in all , the total number of lies detected by alice is about @xmath71note that alice needs not to know the values of @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "she simply follows the above lie - detecting strategy and this number can automatically be reached .",
    "this algorithm is called semi - classicalbecause the quantum property of the qubits is not fully utilized , except for the quantum uncertainty involved in the measurement .",
    "now we shall see that if alice further makes use of quantum entanglement , the problem can be solved more efficiently .",
    "suppose that at the beginning , alice introduces an ancillary system @xmath72 entangled with each @xmath18 .",
    "she sends bob @xmath18 and keeps @xmath73 at her side .",
    "since bob s actual result @xmath74 has four possible values @xmath11 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 , the general form of the state of @xmath78 can be taken as@xmath79by choosing different combinations of the superposition coefficients @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 , we find that the following three algorithms are especially useful for our current purpose .      _ the state _ : alice takes @xmath84which is the maximally entangled state of @xmath78 . here and in the following context @xmath85 and @xmath86",
    "are taken to be orthogonal to each other .    _",

    ": after bob announced @xmath46 , alice measures @xmath73 in the basis which forces @xmath18 to collapse to @xmath33 .",
    "( note that the measurement of alice and bob on the entangled state is permutable .",
    "therefore , though the actual case could be that bob has measured @xmath18 and caused @xmath73 to collapse before alice performs her measurement , it is equivalent to the case where alice has measured @xmath73 and caused @xmath18 to collapse first . )",
    "that is , if @xmath87 , she measures @xmath73 in the basis @xmath88 so that @xmath18 collapses to @xmath89 or @xmath40 . else",
    "if @xmath45 , she measures @xmath73 in the basis @xmath90 so that @xmath18 collapses to @xmath91 or @xmath92",
    ". as a result , the real initial  basis @xmath48 of the qubit @xmath18 always equals to bob s announced basis @xmath93 .",
    "then alice knows that bob told a lie whenever she finds @xmath56 .",
    "_ result _ : since @xmath48 always equals to @xmath33 in this algorithm , it can be seen that the probability for any type of lies to be detected by alice is doubled when comparing with that of the semi - classical  algorithm , where @xmath94  occurs at half of the cases only .",
    "therefore , if alice measures all @xmath73 s in the @xmath17 pairs of entangled states , the total number of lies that she can detect is @xmath95 . on the other hand , if she is required to detect @xmath96 ( defined by eq .",

    "the other @xmath60 pairs of entangled states can be left intact .",
    "in fact , the semi - classical  algorithm can be written in an equivalent form , in which the initial state is also prepared as eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) , but alice always picks a random basis @xmath48 for measuring @xmath73 , instead of choosing @xmath48 according to bob s @xmath93 . then to detect @xmath97 lies , she has to measure all the @xmath17 entangled states . in this sense ,",
    "the current quantum algorithm is more efficient than the semi - classical  one as less @xmath73 is measured .",
    "although the above algorithm is the best we found for alice to detect as much lies as possible , it is not the most efficient one if only @xmath97 lies are required to be detected . with other forms of @xmath98 , the number of @xmath73 that alice needs to measure can be further reduced .    _",

    "bob also generates a bit @xmath231 in step ( 7 ) which serves as a flip of the final @xmath25 , so that alice s biasing the states before this step will be in vain as different values of @xmath231 could bias the final towards opposite directions . therefore ,",
    "to prove that the protocol is unconditionally secure , we only need to prove that bob does not know alice s @xmath222 ( and therefore @xmath122 ) before step ( 7 ) , while alice can not change @xmath222 ( and therefore @xmath122 ) after step ( 7 ) .",
    "consider bob s case first .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) indicates that bob s own operation that maximize his information on @xmath49 is the one that distinguishes the reduced density matrix @xmath232 from @xmath233 .",
    "calculations show that the maximal probability for bob to learn @xmath49 correctly is @xmath234 .",
    "also , from fig.1 we know that type @xmath24 lies and honest results stand a higher chance to be included in set @xmath108 than in set @xmath122 , while type @xmath25 lies do the opposite",
    ". however , step ( 10 ) shows that @xmath25 depends on the parity of the number of @xmath1 s in @xmath49  ( @xmath235 ) .",
    "bob s wrong guess on a single @xmath49  value could completely change this parity .",
    "therefore , bob can not rely on the probabilistic guess on @xmath222 and @xmath122 . if he can not learn the complete string @xmath236 precisely , the relationship between his guess on the parity of @xmath237 and the actual value will be completely random , so that he can not determine the correct @xmath231 value to announce in step ( 7 ) that leads to his desired @xmath25 .",
    "the only exception is type @xmath24 lies , as they never present in set @xmath122 .",
    "therefore once bob tells a type @xmath24 lie and alice does not announce it as an element of set @xmath133 in step ( 5 ) , bob knows with certainty that the corresponding @xmath103 has to be included in set @xmath108 , and he knows this @xmath49 from his own @xmath238 as they are equal .",
    "so we must limit the total number of type @xmath24 lies in the protocol . in step ( 4 )",
    "alice checks @xmath239  which indicates @xmath219 . as eqs .",
    "( [ sizen ] ) and ( [ sizeu ] ) show that the total number of type @xmath24 lies in @xmath240 is @xmath241 , we have@xmath242also , since set @xmath133 is announced in step ( 5 ) , bob knows every @xmath49 ( @xmath243 ) .",
    "therefore , the total number of @xmath49 s that bob knows exactly is @xmath244 .",
    "this result means that there are more than @xmath198 bits of the @xmath17-bit string @xmath222 remaining uncertain to bob . from the definition of set @xmath194 in step ( 1 ) we can see that knowing less than @xmath245 bits of @xmath222 is insufficient for bob to determine which codeword it is .",
    "that is , the requirement @xmath246  guarantees that bob does not have enough information on @xmath222 in step ( 7 ) to determine the parity of @xmath226 .",
    "the operations after step ( 7 ) are merely the security checks against alice s cheating .",
    "there is no more operation for bob to affect the coin - flip outcome .",
    "thus we see that the protocol is unconditionally secure against dishonest bob",
    ".    now consider alice s cheating .",
    "note that bob s lying frequencies @xmath26 , @xmath247 and @xmath28  are never announced to alice directly throughout the protocol .",
    "if alice follows algorithm iii honestly , the sizes of her announced sets @xmath108 , @xmath133 , @xmath122 will meet  eqs .",
    "( [ sizeu ] ) , ( [ sizel ] ) and ( [ sizen ] ) automatically .",

    "on the other hand , suppose that she prepared the states following eq .",
    "( eq2 ) , but after bob announced @xmath248 in step ( 3 ) , she does not like the relationship between @xmath222 and @xmath210 as they will not lead to her desired @xmath25 value .",
    "then to alter @xmath25 , she needs to announce some elements of @xmath122 as the elements of @xmath108 instead , or vice versa .",
    "but it is well - known that entanglement can not be created locally . once alice measured @xmath249 in @xmath78 ( i.e. , @xmath250 ) , it is no longer entangled with @xmath18 .",
    "if she tries to claim that it is an element of the unmeasured set @xmath108 , there is a non - trivial probability that in step ( 9.4 ) when bob measures @xmath73 and compares it with his measurement on @xmath18 , he will find a non - correlated result .",
    "for example , suppose that for a certain @xmath103 , bob has announced @xmath251 , and in step ( 8) alice claims that @xmath227 which implies that @xmath252  and @xmath73 has not been measured .",
    "if bob has measured the corresponding @xmath18 and the actual result is @xmath253 , then from eq .",

    "@xmath255  is the normalization constant , and we fixed @xmath256  in the protocol . to check alice s announcement , in step ( 9.4 )",
    "bob can measure this @xmath72 in the basis @xmath257 , where @xmath258 denotes the state orthogonal to @xmath259 .",
    "if dishonest alice already measured @xmath73 in the basis @xmath88 or @xmath160was not prepared as eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) , then bob has a non - trivial probability to find the measurement result as @xmath260 and thus detect her cheating .",
    "specially , if bob has left a portion of @xmath18 s unmeasured before step ( 9.4 ) ( note that we elaborated before algorithm i that this will not prevent bob from controlling the values of @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 ) and the current @xmath18 happens to belong to this portion , then he can perform a collective measurement on @xmath78  to see whether they can be projected to the state in eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) .",
    "alice s announcing an element of @xmath108 as that of @xmath122 is also detectable . for @xmath261 , bob",

    "take @xmath123  for example . if bob announced @xmath39 , eq .",
    "( [ basis0 ] ) shows that @xmath249 should collapse to @xmath259 if @xmath29 is not a lie .",
    "so if alice measures @xmath73 in the basis @xmath263 and the result is @xmath264 , she knows that bob lies .",
    "but if bob tells a type @xmath24 lie , i.e. , his actual result is @xmath265 , eq .",
    "( basis1 ) shows that @xmath73 actually collapsed to @xmath266 .",
    "it has a non - trivial probability to be detected as @xmath259 since they are not orthogonal .",
    "that is , type @xmath24 lies can not be detected with probability @xmath267 when @xmath155 , in contrast to the case @xmath107 .",
    "consequently , if alice picks an element of @xmath108 and wants to claim that it belongs to @xmath122 instead , eq .",
    "( [ sizeu ] ) shows that she stands probability @xmath268  to come across a type @xmath24 lie , and she can not always distinguish it even if she measures @xmath73 .",
    "as it was shown in algorithm iii that @xmath122 should not contain any type @xmath24 lies , alice s claiming @xmath235 will immediately be caught as cheating .",
    "thus it is shown that either alice announces a single element of @xmath122 as that of @xmath108 , or vice versa , she stands a non - trivial probability @xmath5 to be detected .",
    "more importantly , while altering one single element of @xmath122 and @xmath108 ( i.e. , changing one single @xmath49  value ) could be sufficient for changing the parity of @xmath226 and thus affect the final coin - flip outcome @xmath25 , in our protocol the string @xmath222 is required to be a codeword of @xmath194",
    ". as the minimal distance between codewords is @xmath198 , changing one or few @xmath49 s of a codeword will result in @xmath269 and be detected in step ( 9.1 ) . consequently",
    ", dishonest alice has to alter at least @xmath270 bits of @xmath222 ( suppose that she started with a @xmath222 lying half way between two codewords ) to cheat successfully .",
    "but then the total probability for escaping the detection will be at the order of magnitude of @xmath271 . by choosing a very high @xmath17 value in our protocol , the @xmath198 value can also be increased , so that alice s probability for successfully biasing the coin - flip result can be made arbitrarily close to zero .",
    "thus our protocol is also unconditionally secure against dishonest alice .",
    "currently there are many references on the no - go proofs of unconditionally secure qcf @xcite , qi58,qbc46,qi145,qi146,qi76,qi817,qbc37,qbc54,qi246,qbc132,qbc19,qbc106,qbc112 . among them , ref .",

    "@xcite : this reference proved that ideal qcf ( i.e. , the bias @xmath273 equals to @xmath205 precisely , instead of being arbitrarily close to @xmath205 ) is impossible .",
    "as seen from the proof of its theorem 2 in page 8 , their approach is to argue that if an ideal qcf can be done in @xmath122 rounds of communication , then it can be done in @xmath274 rounds . by repeating this induction",
    ", it seems that qcf can be done without any communication  which is an absurd result that can easily be disproved .",
    "but our protocol is non - ideal qcf .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath122 to @xmath274 rounds induction obviously can not apply to our protocol .",
    "for example , step ( 9 ) of our protocol is a security check .",

    "thus the induction approach does not work in our case .",
    "@xcite : this paper showed that to achieve a bias of at most @xmath273 , a qcf protocol must use at least @xmath275 rounds of communication . according to the proof of its lemma 12 on page 14 , to bias the coin towards @xmath205 , alice just runs the honest protocol with her starting state being @xmath276  instead of @xmath277 . here",

    "@xcite : according to its definition 8 , any qcf protocol is treated as a series of alice s and bob s unitary transformations @xmath282 s and @xmath283 s ( @xmath284 ) on the hilbert space , and their final measurements @xmath285 and @xmath286 for finding the coin - flip outcome @xmath287 while the protocol does not abort .",
    "its lemmas 10 and 11 suggested that the optimal strategy of bob trying to force outcome @xmath1 is the solution to the primal semidefinite program ( sdp ) in its eqs .",
    "( 29)-(31 ) , whose dual sdp is given by its eqs .",
    "( 32)-(34 ) .",
    "note that its eqs .",

    "this result is very similar to the case of ref .",
    "@xcite below , where the optimal cheating strategy exists but the cheater can not reach it",
    "@xcite : this proof recovered kitaev s bound @xmath291 for strong qcf @xcite with a different presentation . in brief , as shown in its page 8 , suppose @xmath292 is honest - alice s strategy and @xmath293 is honest - bob s co - strategy in a qcf protocol , corresponding to the outcomes @xmath205 , @xmath1 and @xmath294 , respectively .",
    "the definition of qcf implies@xmath295let @xmath296 be the maximum probability that a cheating bob can force honest - alice to output a fixed @xmath297 .",
    "then its theorem 9 implies that there must exist a strategy @xmath298 for alice such that @xmath299 .",

    "( [ eq132 ] ) indicates that there is a cheating strategy @xmath298 which can maximize @xmath307 to @xmath1 , which is alice s probability for forcing the output .    however , the question is whether alice knows this @xmath298 .",
    "note that the task of @xmath298 is not merely producing alice s desired @xmath25 value , but also bringing her through the security checks successfully . in our protocol , to obtain the output @xmath25 , bob s strategies are not limited to one single @xmath308 . even if he always announced the same values of @xmath248 s and @xmath231 in steps ( 3 ) and ( 7 ) , his choice on the actual measurement bases @xmath309 can be different , resulting in different locations and types of his lies .",
    "also , in step ( 9.4 ) bob has the freedom on choosing the measurement bases @xmath310 for checking @xmath249 s in set @xmath108 .",
    "that is , even for the same @xmath46 s and @xmath311 he still has many different strategies , each of which is corresponding to a different choice of @xmath312 and @xmath313 , so we can denote it as @xmath314 . while @xmath312 and @xmath313 do not affect @xmath25 , they determine what kinds of alice s states can pass bob s security checks . therefore , alice strategy @xmath298 has to match bob s @xmath314 , so we can denote it as @xmath315 .    as each @xmath32 has two possible values , there are totally @xmath316  different choices for @xmath312 , leading to at least @xmath316different strategies @xmath314 .",

    "that is why the proof in ref .",
    "@xcite does not apply to our protocol .    ref .",
    "@xcite : as can be seen from its section 4.2 , its no - go proof on strong qcf is based on that of @xcite . thus it does not apply to our protocol for the same reason that we elaborated above .",
    "it is also worth pinpointing out a problem which may hurt the generality of this proof , though it does not related directly with our protocol .",
    "that is , footnote 4 on its page 3 is incorrect .",
    "it said that the players can always add a final round to check if they have the same value and output the dummy symbol if the values differ .",
    "but if there is a secure qcf protocol without this round , then adding such a round will make it insecure , because a dishonest party will be able to bias the output by always announcing the value he preferred as what he obtained from the protocol , regardless what is the actual output value .",
