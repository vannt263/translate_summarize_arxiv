    "the interest of physicists and mathematicians towards complex systems arising in social and economical sciences has been constantly growing in the last years , as attested by the number of published papers . among the subjects these papers deal with",
    ", one finds opinion formation dynamics ( see for example @xcite ) , relaxation processes to steady wealth and income distributions @xcite , mechanisms of financial markets and other out - of - equilibrium economic and financial phenomena @xcite .",
    "these topics share the common fact of referring to systems ( populations ) composed by a large number of interacting elements ( individuals ) . and",
    "this is why methods and tools from statistical mechanics and kinetic theory have been and are being adapted and employed to investigate them .    in a recent paper ,",
    "@xcite , one of the present authors introduced a general framework , suitable for the construction of models of taxation and redistribution in a closed society .",
    "this framework originates from a discrete active particle kinetic approach @xcite and is expressed by a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations .",
    "the equations are as many as the classes , each one characterized by its average income , in which the population can be divided .",
    "each equation gives the variation in time of the fraction of individuals belonging to a certain class .",
    "the framework provides a description of the evolution of the wealth distribution over the population and aims at explaining emerging collective features , based on the knowledge of the individual interactions . as a case study , also a specific model was formulated in @xcite . to this end",
    ", the general mathematical framework was exploited and a particular choice for the values of some of its parameters was made .",
    "the well - posedness of the model as well as the existence of two conserved quantities , corresponding to the total population and the global wealth , was then established .",
    "several simulations were carried out for the case in which the number @xmath0 of income classes ( and of differential equations ) is equal to @xmath1 .",
    "specific attention was devoted in @xcite to the differences , detectable from the shape of the long - time income distributions , among systems with different taxation rates .",
    "the result was that increasing the difference between the maximum and the minimum tax rate leads , at the asymptotic equilibrium , to the growth of the middle classes , to the detriment of the poorest and the richest classes .",
    "this is a reasonable feature which encourages , in spite of the naiveness and roughness of the model , a thorough investigation .",
    "a natural observation is that the study of the model in the particular case with 5 income classes does not allow for example to recover the pareto - law which is observed in real world economies . as a matter of fact",
    ", @xmath2 is too small a number for a tail of the steady income distribution to show up . in view of that",
    ", we started performing a great deal of computational simulations relative to the model with greater values of @xmath0 . we tried and considered several choices of the model parameters , expressing e.g. different characterizations of the incomes or of the tax rates .",
    "with the aim of treating reasonable cases , as far as possible comparable with real world ones , we focused our attention on realistic initial population distributions , where the majority of individuals belongs to lower income classes , while higher classes are less densely populated ( see section @xmath3 for details ) .",
    "the numerical solutions systematically show that for any fixed value of the total wealth a unique asymptotic stationary distribution exists , independently of the random choice of the initial population distribution ( subjected only to the just mentioned realisticrequirement ) .",
    "the asymptotic stationary distribution exhibits the following patterns : the density of the low income classes is smaller than for the low - medium classes , the maximal density is achieved by the low - medium classes and the density progressively decreases for the higher income classes . in fact , the asymptotic distributions exhibit salient features of empirical distributions ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) . at a closer look , one also finds that the tails of the distributions have indeed a power law behavior @xcite .",
    "an analysis of the shape of the tails and its relation with the parameters of the model is the subject of the present paper .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section @xmath4",
    ", we review for the convenience of the reader the framework and the model introduced in @xcite .",
    "section @xmath3 focuses on the existence of asymptotic stationary distributions and on their properties .",
    "in particular , pareto tails @xcite are found to occur and their pareto indices are calculated in some different cases . the last section provides a short summary of the content of the paper and a brief mention of possible future developments .    before starting",
    ", it may be of interest comparing certain features of our models with those of others available in the econophysics or classicalmathematical economics literature .",
    "some immediately evident differences concern the mathematical formulation of the income distribution problem . a first class of works ( see @xcite for a review )",
    "develop a statistical analysis of the population by means of montecarlo simulations of the interactions of a large number of individuals . in these models",
    "the interaction rules can be defined with great freedom , because they are applied in a straightforward way through the simulation algorithm . at the same time , the method is not based upon evolution equations .",
    "therefore it lacks general mathematical theorems which should keep account of specific hypotheses on the interactions . to draw a comparison , within our framework we are free to fix several parameters ( interaction frequency , taxation rates , etc . ) , but for the models to be conservative , some terms in the transition probabilities expressing income class changes must be proportional to the reciprocal of the income difference @xmath5 . if one changes this dependence , supposing for instance that the transition probability is proportional to the reciprocal of @xmath6 , then the conservation of the total wealth ceases to be valid .",
    "the dependence of the model on the details of the interactions is also typical of the approaches based on the boltzmann equation @xcite . in the application of this equation to the kinetic theory of gases",
    "the interactions are determined to a large extent by physical conservation laws and symmetry principles . in the applications to econophysics there is some more freedom as for the definition of the interactions . within this approach it is possible proving powerful general results concerning the moments of the distribution function @xmath7 and the pareto index of the stationary asymptotic distribution .",
    "it has to be noticed however that the structure of the boltzmann equation requires advanced mathematical tools for his treatment : the partial time derivative of the income distribution function @xmath7 is given by an integral operator acting on @xmath7 and also involves an average on some stochastic variables .",
    "the time evolution is usually computed through some approximate discretization method .",
    "similar approximations are also employed in the classical economics theory @xcite . there , the time evolution equations are not derived from hypotheses on the microscopicinteractions , but from variational principles and other general macroscopicconsiderations .",
    "of course , the classical approach is characterized by a more realistic description of the dynamics of a complex economy , taking into consideration also different kinds of assets , financial transactions , government intervention etc .. our framework introduces from the beginning a discretization of the distribution function .",
    "we suppose that the individuals belong to income classes and pass from one class to another with certain probabilities . in our case",
    ", the equivalent of the classical distribution function could be written as a liner combination of dirac delta - functions : @xmath8 the quantities which evolve in time are discrete , like the individuals in a montecarlo simulation , but in fact they express already averages , weighed with certain probabilities , much like the matrix elements of a wavefunction in quantum mechanics .",
    "the formalism is familiar to physicists , since it reminds of the schroedinger equation of an atomic system expanded on a basis of states .",
    "this approach was previously devised to describe problems of opinion formation @xcite , for which the state of an individual can be reasonably represented by a discrete rather than real variable .",
    "it provides some advantages , however , also for the treatment of income distributions .",
    "it allows , for instance , a very natural definition of different taxation rates for different income classes , and a division of the population in classes with incomes that increase non - linearly . in turn",
    ", this enables a better representation of the  super - rich  classes in a population .",
    "in this section we shortly describe the general mathematical framework introduced in @xcite for the modelling of the dynamical process of taxation and redistribution in a closed trading market society .",
    "we then construct a particular family of models , by attributing specific values to the parameters in the framework .      before writing down the system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations which constitute the framework",
    ", we briefly describe the context and introduce some notation .",
    "consider a population of individuals belonging to a finite number @xmath0 of classes , each one characterized by its average income .",
    "let @xmath9 denote the average incomes of the @xmath0 classes , ordered so that @xmath10 , and let @xmath11 , where @xmath12 for @xmath13 , denote the fraction at time @xmath14 of individuals belonging to the @xmath15-th class . in the following , the indices @xmath16 , etc . will always belong to @xmath17 .",
    "what produces the dynamics is a whole of pairwise interactions of economic nature , subjected to taxation .",
    "call @xmath18 the fixed amount of money that people may exchange during their interactions .",
    "any time an individual of the @xmath19-th class has to pay a quantity @xmath18 to an individual of the @xmath20-th class , this one in turn has to pay some tax corresponding to a percentage of what he is receiving .",
    "this tax is quantified as @xmath21 , where the tax rate @xmath22 depends in general on the class of the earning individual . since the amount of money corresponding to the tax @xmath21 should go to the government ,",
    "which then is supposed to use the money collected through taxation to provide welfare services for the population , we interpret the welfare provision as an income redistribution . ignoring the passages to and from the government",
    ", we adopt the following equivalent mechanism as the mover of the dynamics : in correspondence to any interaction between an @xmath19-individual and a @xmath20-individual , where the one who has to pay @xmath18 to the other one is the @xmath19-individual , as a matter of fact the @xmath19-individual pays to the @xmath20-individual a quantity @xmath23 and he pays as well a quantity @xmath21 , which is divided among all @xmath24-individuals for @xmath25.-th class constitute an exception is a technical one : if an individual of the @xmath0th class would receive some money , the possibility would arise for him to advance to a higher class , which is impossible . ] accordingly , the effect of taxation and redistribution is equivalent to the effect of a quantity of interactions between the @xmath19-individual and each one of the @xmath24-individuals for @xmath25 , which are inducedby the effective @xmath19-@xmath20 interaction . to fix notations",
    ", we may distinguish between directinteractions ( @xmath19-@xmath20 ) and indirectinteractions ( @xmath19-@xmath24 for @xmath25 ) .",
    "now : any direct or indirect economical interaction yields as a consequence a possible slight increase or slight decrease of the income of individuals .    to translate in mathematical terms all that , we introduce    @xmath26 the ( table of the ) _ interaction rates _ @xmath27 expressing the number of effective encounters per unit time between individuals of the @xmath19-th class and individuals of the @xmath20-th class ;    @xmath26 the ( tables of the ) _ direct transition probability densities _",
    "@xmath28 satisfying for any fixed @xmath19 and @xmath20 @xmath29 which express the probability density that an individual of the @xmath19-th class will belong to the @xmath15-th class after a direct interaction with an individual of the @xmath20-th class ;    @xmath26 the ( tables of the ) _ indirect transition variation densities _ @xmath30}^i   \\ , :    { \\bf r}^n \\to { \\bf r }   \\vb\\ ] ] where the @xmath31}^i(x)$ ] with @xmath32 are continuous functions , satisfying , for any fixed @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath33 @xmath34}^i(x ) = 0 \\pb\\ ] ] these functions account for the indirect interactions and express the variation density in the @xmath15-th class due to an interaction between an individual of the @xmath19-th class with an individual of the @xmath20-th class .",
    "if the interactions rates @xmath35 are chosen for simplicity all equal to @xmath36 , the evolution of the class populations @xmath11 is governed by the following differential equations , in which , of course , the contribution of both direct and indirect interactions is present : @xmath37}^i(x ) { \\big ) } x_h x_k      -     x_i   \\sum_{k=1}^n x_k \\pb \\label{evolution eq eta = 1}\\ ] ]    this is a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations .",
    "for instance , if the values of the elements @xmath31}^i$ ] are chosen as in the next subsection , the r.h.s .",
    "of the equations @xmath38 is a polynomial of third degree .      in order to design within",
    "the general framework just discussed a specific model ( or a specific family of models ) , we need to further characterize the expressions of the direct transition probability densities @xmath39 and the indirect transition variation densities @xmath31}^i(x)$ ] .",
    "a conceivable choice is given next .",
    "as done in the previous subsection , we take all the interaction rates @xmath35 to be equal to one .",
    "this corresponds to assuming that all the encounters between two individuals occur with the same frequency , independently of the classes to which the two belong .",
    "we represent the direct transition probability densities @xmath39 as @xmath40 where the term @xmath41 expresses the probability density that an @xmath19-individual will belong to the @xmath15-th class after an encounter with a @xmath20-individual , when such an encounter does not produce any change of class and the term @xmath42 expresses the density variation in the @xmath15-th class of an @xmath19-individual interacting with a @xmath20-individual .",
    "accordingly , the only nonzero elements @xmath41 are @xmath43    to define the elements @xmath42 , we introduce the matrix @xmath44 , whose elements @xmath45 express the probability that in an encounter between an @xmath19-individual and a @xmath20-individual , the one who pays is the @xmath19-individual . admitting also the possibility",
    "that to some extent the two individuals do not really interact , we have @xmath46 and , furthermore , @xmath47 .",
    "there is some arbitrariness in the construction of the matrix @xmath44 .",
    "what is important is putting each element in the first row , as well as each element but the very last one in the last column , equal to zero . indeed , since there is not a class lower than the first nor one higher than the @xmath0-th , we can not admit the possibility for @xmath36-individuals [ respectively , for @xmath0-individuals ] to move back to a lower class [ respectively , to advance , passing in a higher class ] . observing that also in the presence of interactions between individuals of the same class , the average wealth of the class itself decreases because of payment of taxes",
    ", we assume that individuals of class @xmath36 never pay ( nor even @xmath36-individuals ) while individuals of class @xmath0 can only receive money from other @xmath0-individuals .",
