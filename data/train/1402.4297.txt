    "<S> the system may well describe the tci thin film made of pb@xmath0sn@xmath1te with an appropriate choice of phenomenological mass parameters . </S>",
    "<S> then we break the mirror symmetry by introducing a perpendicular electric field @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> the conductance is calculated in the presence of @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> the conductance is switched off by the electric field . </S>",
    "<S> namely , it acts as a topological field - effect transistor ezawaapl . by attaching two independent gates to the sample </S>",
    "<S> , we can separately control the right and left edge states . </S>",
    "<S> the conductance can be 0 , 1 and 2 , which forms a multi - digit topological field - effect transistor , where the conductance is quantized and topologically protected . </S>",
    "<S> our results open a new way to electric - field controllable topological electronics . </S>"
