    "since wilson s first numerical renormalization group ( rg ) analysis of su(2 ) gauge theory @xcite , there have been many monte carlo rg studies of non - perturbative @xmath7-functions ( see ref.@xcite and references therein ) . in these analysis indirect information about the @xmath7 function , such as @xmath8 ,",
    "has been obtained @xcite .",
    "recent progress of lattice techniques @xcite allows us to estimate directly the rg flow in multi - coupling space @xcite .",
    "we study renormalization effects by means of a blocking transformation which changes the lattice cut - off but leaves the long range contents of the system invariant .",
    "a new blocked action @xmath9 as a function of blocked link variables @xmath10 s is constructed from the original action @xmath11 as e^-s(v ) = u e^-s(u ) ( v - p(u ) ) , where @xmath12 defines the blocking transformation .",
    "the action @xmath9 includes the renormalization effects induced by blocking . in the space of coupling constants ,",
    "the blocking transformation makes a transition from a point corresponding to @xmath13 to a new point , @xmath9 . repeating the blocking transformation , we obtain trajectories in coupling space which define the so called renormalization group flow .",
    "there is a special trajectory , i.e. renormalized trajectory ( rt ) , which starts at the ultra - violet fixed point . on the rt ,",
    "the long range information corresponding to continuum physics is preserved .",
    "recently hasenfratz and niedermayer have stressed that the action on the rt can indeed be considered as a `` perfect action '' @xcite .",
    "therefore if we find a rt corresponding to a blocking transformation , it provides an action which gives accurate results corresponding to the continuum limit .",
    "even if it is an approximate one , it serves as a well - improved action . in this sense",
    ", a pioneering work has been done by iwasaki more than ten years ago @xcite .",
    "he estimated a rt by matching wilson loops based on a perturbative approximation , and proposed an improved action which we will call below iwasaki action .    in this work ,",
    "we analyze numerically the rg flow in two coupling space , @xmath14 , of su(3 ) lattice gauge theory and clarify the structure of the renormalization group flow .",
    "the action is restricted to the following form ; @xmath15 here @xmath16 and @xmath17 correspond to @xmath2 and @xmath3 loops , respectively .",
    "the main purpose of the present work is to perform an extensive study of the rt beyond a perturbative analysis .",
    "it is a non - trivial fact whether the rt locates near the two coupling space , i.e. in the @xmath18 plane .",
    "if no remnant of the rt can be seen in this plane , the two coupling space is insufficient to obtain good improved actions . in this sense ,",
    "a global analysis of the rg flow from weak to strong coupling regions is indispensable .",
    "parts of our analysis were reported in refs.@xcite , and in this paper we present much more data which are enough to confirm the existence of rt .",
    "our analysis is performed in the fourth quadrant of the coupling space .",
    "we examine renormalization effects induced by swendsen s factor two blocking on the plaquette action as well as on some improved actions .",
    "in addition , we try to clarify the global structure of the rg flow .",
    "an evidence that the rt sits close to the two coupling space is provided by the fact that the flow runs quickly towards a narrow attractive stream .",
    "characteristic features of the flow in the strong and weak coupling regions are also found .",
    "the observed features are reproduced by a model flow equation which incorporates a marginal coupling ( asymptotic scaling term ) , an irrelevant coupling and a non - perturbative attraction towards the strong coupling limit .",
    "based on the flow structure , we examine the scaling properties of several actions defined in this two coupling space .",
    "tests are made for the rotational invariance and the scaling of @xmath19 .",
    "near the attractive stream , we find good restoration of the rotational invariance .",

    "here we describe the basic framework to study the rg flow for su(3 ) gauge fields on the lattice .",

    "[ fig : flow ] , the shape of the attractor is less clear above @xmath105 .",
    "this suggests that the distance to the rt grows in this region .",
    "another point is that the resulting couplings @xmath106 obtained through the truncation into two coupling space after blocking give larger lattice spacing ( roughly 40 - 60 % ) than that of the original blocked lattice .",
    "one possible reason is the choice of a minimal set of loops in the schwinger - dyson equation . but this effect might also be due to the truncation of the space of couplings .",

    "no sizable value of @xmath109 is generated for points on the attractor .",
    "on the other hand , if we start from the points @xmath114 , a negative @xmath109 is induced .",
    "this indicates that the attractor in three coupling space sits below the @xmath115 sector in this region .",

    ", we adopted the demon method .",
    "although both methods give similar results , the schwinger - dyson algorithm is more echonomical because in case of the demon formula we need an additional monte carlo simulation for each configuration .",
    "moreover the schwinger - dyson method uses larger loops to determine the couplings .",
    "analyses are performed in the fourth quadrant of the coupling space and reveal the presence of an attractive stream .",
    "trajectories are first attracted towards this stream and afterwards they move towards the origin along it .",
    "the stream converges to a parabolic curve in the strong coupling region .",
    "these features indicate that the rt locates close to the two coupling space and the attractive stream traces the rt .",
    "a model flow equation which consists of asymptotic scaling , an irrelevant coupling and a non - perturbative force corresponding to the area law can reproduce the observed features .    in this paper",
    "we have compared several actions in the two coupling space by measuring the restoration of the rotational symmetry and the scaling of @xmath19 . in the regions of @xmath6 , iwasaki and dbw2 actions , which are near to rt , are superior to tree - level symanzik and plaquette actions .",
    "although `` improveness '' of all actions are indistinguishable at smaller lattice spacing within the present statistics , this indicate that nonperturbative study of rg flows is valuable to design an improved action at intermediate lattice spacing .",
    "it is highly desirable to pursue the same analysis for fermion actions .",
    "the effect of truncation to a space with only two couplings is partly examined and it is found that renormalization effects outside the two coupling space are small and the attractive stream in this space gives hence a good starting point for improvement .",
