    "symmetry breaking is a fundamental concept which has been quite fruitful in many physical applications @xcite . for a fluid",
    "the simplest way to break symmetry is to introduce helicity . in that case , the velocity covariance tensor is still expressible in terms of the magnitude of the distance between points , i.e. , the fluid still has isotropic statistics , but mirror symmetry is broken whereby the covariance matrix has an anti - symmetric component which can be shown to be proportional to the total helicity @xmath10 , which is defined as the correlation between the velocity @xmath11 and its curl , the vorticity @xmath12 .",
    "helical structures abound in nature , from macroscopic organisms to elastomers ; helical structures can cause erosion in river bends @xcite , and alter nutrient mixing properties in estuaries , in particular when interacting with tidal flows @xcite .",
    "helical flows are observed as well in the atmosphere , in dust devils , tornadoes and hurricanes @xcite .",
    "helicity is an invariant of motion of the non - dissipative fluid equations involving the topology of field lines @xcite , including in the presence of rotation , but not with stratification , where instead potential vorticity is invariant and is essential in determining structures such as sharp jets in planetary atmospheres @xcite .",
    "invariants are known to play a fundamental role in turbulence , since the nonlinear terms have to preserve such invariants at the level of triadic interactions in the incompressible case .",
    "however , helical ( corkscrew ) motions do not seem to alter the dynamics of homogeneous isotropic turbulence in the absence of both rotation and stratification , with the kinetic energy and helicity spectral densities ( respectively @xmath13 and @xmath14 , with @xmath15 and @xmath16 ) both following a kolmogorov spectrum .",
    "this implies a slow @xmath17 decay of the relative helicity in fourier space @xmath18 with @xmath19 the degree of alignment between velocity and vorticity in configuration space .",
    "however , it is straightforward to show that helicity is created point - wise by the alignment of vorticity and pressure or shear gradients @xcite , and it is observed to be strong ( @xmath20 ) in the vortex filaments that are ubiquitous in isotropic fluid turbulence at small scale .",
    "invariants are also the stepping stone to determine inertial range behavior in turbulent flows ; this principle is at the basis of statistical mechanics that has proven useful in predicting , for example , the inverse cascade of energy for a two - dimensional fluid @xcite . in fact",
    ", a recent direct numerical simulation of the ideal three - dimensional fluid equations in the absence of waves , showed that , at intermediate times , a kolmogorov spectrum develops at large scale , the effective dissipation for the large - scale fluid being produced by the eddy viscosity emanating from the small - scale equilibrated modes @xcite .",
    "however , non - conserved quantities can also play an important role through other mechanisms such as interactions with waves and large - scale hydrostatic and geostrophic balance @xcite .",
    "when the fluid is conducting , magnetic helicity is an invariant in the ideal case and is central to minimum energy equilibria in plasmas such as in spheromaks , or in solar coronal mass ejections @xcite .",
    "it is also known that the generation of large - scale magnetic fields occurs due to small - scale mechanic helicity @xmath21 , and that in the presence of both rotation and stratification , helicity is created and thus a dynamo is facilitated in a wide variety of astrophysical settings @xcite . in the context of this work , it is important to note that although in this case the mechanic helicity is not an invariant any longer , it still plays an essential role in determining the scaling of the fields at large scales .",
    "rotating stratified turbulence is important in the atmosphere and oceans , playing a crucial role in their dynamics . in the presence of waves ,",
    "advective nonlinear interactions responsible for the complexity of turbulent flows have to compete with the waves and an equilibrium can be reached at some scale and broken at others , the best known example perhaps being the difference between the garret - munk and the phillips spectra in internal waves in lakes or the oceans @xcite , where wave coupling in resonant triads leads to mixing ( like in coastal currents @xcite ) , to vertical dispersion @xcite , and to enhanced dissipation @xcite .",
    "a particular set of modes plays a major role , in the so - called slow manifold for which the frequency of the waves tends to zero , and only turbulent interactions and standing potential vorticity modes remain . when rotation ( only ) is present in the fluid , strong relative helicity can alter the scaling of the distribution of energy among scales and lead to the occurrence of helical long - lived structures @xcite .",
    "what happens when stratification is also included ? in the remainder of this paper , we address the question of rotating stratified turbulence in the absence of forcing , as studied for example in @xcite , but concentrating on the creation of helicity and on the link between the evolution of helicity and is crucial for weather forecasting and simulations of climate change .",
    "however , the consequences of , as far as helical motions are concerned , have been mostly ignored except for the pioneering work of hide @xcite . in spite of this",
    ", helicity was hypothesized to be important in the atmosphere in the dynamics and persistence of rotating convective storms @xcite on the basis of the weakening of non - linear interactions in the so - called lamb vector @xmath22 .",
    "it is also interesting that helicity is measured in the context of forecasting storms and tropical tornadoes , in particular in the presence of strong shear , and it can be used as an indicator of storm occurrence @xcite .",
    "note that it has been shown that in some cases ( using a specific fully helical beltrami forcing function ) , shear is created at large - scale in a rotating flow @xcite .",
    "since helicity in rotating and stratified flows is no longer an invariant even in the absence of dissipation , its presence in these atmospheric storms can be accounted for but the physical mechanisms governing its creation , and the structures associated with it , remain unclear . in this paper , we perform a parametric study using direct numerical simulations in which we vary both rotation and stratification . in that framework , we show that a strongly rotating stratified flow can spontaneously create helicity at large scales .",
    "we integrate the incompressible boussinesq equations in the rotating frame , with constant ( solid body ) rotation @xmath23 and gravity @xmath24 , anti - aligned in the vertical ( @xmath25 ) direction , with @xmath26 the buoyancy ( in units of velocity ) , @xmath27 the vertical velocity , @xmath28 the pressure , @xmath29 the viscosity , and @xmath30 the diffusivity : @xmath31 we write @xmath32 and we take a unit prandtl number , @xmath33 .",

    "[ [ section ] ]    as mentioned in the introduction , helicity is not conserved in a rotating and stratified flow , and thus helicity can in principle be created by the flow evolution . in this section",
    "we briefly show how a balance of the forces at large scales can result in net helicity of a preferred sign in the flow .",
    "we start from the primitive boussinesq equations given above and simplify them using several hypotheses .",
    "assuming stationarity , weak nonlinearities and small dissipation at large scales , it results that the equilibrium level of helicity in rotating stratified turbulence is proportional to @xmath4 and to the correlation between buoyancy and vertical shear .",
    "a result consistent with this behavior was originally obtained by hide @xcite .    with strong",
    "rotation and stratification , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 alone essentially determines the total helicity .",
    "for example , measurements of @xmath85 ( where the subindices @xmath86 and @xmath25 indicates the averages are volume averages performed in the horizontal and vertical directions ) found in modeling simulations of hurricanes are seen to be two orders of magnitude larger than @xmath87 @xcite . note also that the @xmath84 density is proportional to the so - called ( cell - relative ) environmental helicity , when integrated over the vertical ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we thus conclude that , , the production of helicity in strongly rotating stratified turbulence is such that its equilibrium level is directly proportional to @xmath4 , and results from between rotation and stratification . in the limit of @xmath88 ( no stratification ) ,",
    "helicity is exactly conserved . in the limit of @xmath89 , stratification dominates and the evolution of helicity can only be governed by the nonlinear terms , the buoyancy and the dissipation @xcite .",
    "indeed , in that case dissipation is known to play a role in the overall dynamics , e.g. , in the changes of potential vorticity once gravity waves start to break @xcite . finally , it is interesting that @xmath4 scaling has also been advocated , for example , in the context of statistical mechanics of non - dissipative geophysical flows @xcite .      with these assumptions broken when overturning takes place .",
    "for example , it is known that in three - dimensional turbulence without waves , the rate of energy dissipation can be evaluated phenomenologically as @xmath90 , no matter how high the reynolds number ; this has been demonstrated using highly - resolved direct numerical simulations @xcite up to grids of @xmath91 points ( for the case of a coupling to a magnetic field , in which case alfvn waves are present and interact with the flow , see @xcite in two dimensions ( 2d ) , and @xcite in 3d ) .",
    "similarly , there is a vast literature which concerns itself with the weak non - linear coupling of waves , e.g. , through resonant interactions @xcite , through weak turbulence theory ( see @xcite for the rotating case , and @xcite for the stratified case ) , through turbulence closures @xcite , and more recently through asymptotic approaches @xcite . in all cases , when the rotation or stratification is not strong enough , and/or when the reynolds number is high enough , a situation described by both the buoyancy and what can be called the inertial reynolds number @xmath92 being large enough , nonlinear couplings will take place between eddies and waves , sufficiently so that the energy will be transferred to small scales in a self - similar manner .",
    "let us note here that in the following ( see also table [ tab1 ] ) , @xmath93 are evaluated at the peak of enstrophy , using dynamical variables , i.e. , based on the so - called integral scale @xmath94/e_v$ ] .    in these cases , that we will broadly call wave turbulence , the scaling laws for either rotating or stratified flows have been deduced both phenomenologically and analytically in the framework of the aforementioned closures and theories , and a continuous power - law spectrum is expected , steeper than a kolmogorov spectrum , because of the weakening of interactions in the presence of waves .",
    "thus , we are in the presence of turbulence , but not the classical kolmogorov turbulence , rather a wave turbulence regime that breaks down at small scales ( beyond the ozmidov scale )",
    ". two typical cases of the isotropic energy spectra are shown in fig .",
    "[ spect ] .",
    "we observe well developed kinetic energy spectra , rather steep for @xmath80 ( @xmath95 ) , whereas the power law is closer to a kolmogorov law for @xmath96 . in both cases , the dissipation scale @xmath97 ( evaluated using a kolmogorov spectrum )",
    "is barely resolved : one finds @xmath98 and @xmath99 for the case where @xmath100 , and @xmath101 with @xmath102 for the case where @xmath103 .",
    "note that in the latter case , the turbulence is stronger and the spectra are not quite as well resolved , but the point of this study is not to examine kolmogorov turbulence ; in the presence of waves , one can simulate higher reynolds numbers at a given resolution than in the absence of waves , again the set of governing parameters being @xmath93 rather than @xmath79 .",
    "note that we do not intend to perform a detailed analysis of wave - mode and vortical - mode perpendicular and parallel energy and helicity spectra here , but rather show that turbulence and helicity develop in the flows we study .",
    "there are several examples in the literature of such studies at high resolution for the energy ( i.e. , @xmath104 , see for example @xcite for the purely stratified case , and @xcite for rotating turbulence ) . in our case , the choice of isotropic spectra is sufficient to show that there is indeed for these parameter regimes power - law spectra that develop through nonlinear mode coupling . these spectra may display intermittency at small scale , a phenomenon that would require substantially higher numerical resolutions to study .",
    "therefore , we can expect that for very small values of the control parameters , and for flows for which the geostrophic and hydrostatic balance holds , the latter implying @xmath105 , the helicity should remain zero .",
    "as fluctuations develop , and as weak nonlinear perturbations come into play , small departures from geostrophy will develop allowing for non - zero correlations between buoyancy and vertical velocity , as appears in eqs .",
    "( [ moffatt2 ] ) and ( [ moffatt2bis ] ) and as can also be expressed in two - scale turbulence closure formalisms . in that case",
    ", we can expect helicity to develop .",
    "helicity should be created at large scales , where rotation and stratification dominate over the nonlinear term , and may be transferred to smaller scales .",
    "we have performed nine runs on grids of @xmath52 points , and 36 runs on @xmath50 grids , up to the peak of dissipation and beyond , with similar ( but not identical ) random initial conditions and @xmath106 $ ] .",
    "figure [ temp ] gives the temporal evolution of helicity ( top and middle ) for several runs at either fixed @xmath38 or fixed @xmath39 , and of kinetic enstrophy @xmath41 ( bottom ) for several flows at fixed @xmath38 ; the potential enstrophy @xmath107 shows a behavior similar to @xmath41 , with slightly smaller values .",
    "note that in all quantities the oscillations are due to gravity waves because of the fact that our initial conditions are chosen to be unbalanced , and their periods are proportional to @xmath1 . across all runs ,",
    "the maximum of @xmath41 varies from 30 ( for weak waves ) to @xmath108 , corresponding to the smallest froude number considered .",
    "the time to reach this maximum varies from 1.5 to 3.2 @xmath109 .",
    "the growth of enstrophy is typical of a turbulent flow , and is due to vortex stretching .",
    "the growth in the presence of waves is weaker , a characteristic of a weak turbulence regime .",
    "the overall structures in this type of flows are shown in fig .",

    "the 3d rendering puts in evidence the stratification and the presence of large - scale layers ; small - scale features with curved ribbons also occur for the run with smaller stratification .",
    "the run with @xmath110 shows strong turbulent fluctuations , whereas the run with @xmath111 is smoother , with weaker small - scale fluctuations .",

    "the generation of helicity requires an interplay between stratification and rotation , and when stratification dominates , vertical and horizontal motions are less correlated .",
    "the fact that rotating stratified flows can spontaneously produce large - scale helicity opens new lines of research and questions .",
    "for example , is there a detailed role to be played by potential vorticity conservation on the emergence of helicity ?",
    "how would the inclusion of either shear , radiation , moisture , or some general forcing in eq .",
    "( [ eq : temp ] ) modify these results ? and finally , how would turbulence affect significantly the creation of helicity , as the reynolds numbers are further increased ?",
    "indeed , mixing is thought to have two transitions in terms of @xmath135 : in the presence of an imposed shear , it was shown in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) that below 7 , molecular diffusion is observed , with basically no turbulence ; the intermediate regime @xmath136 follows a linear osborn diffusion law @xcite , and above that value , a new regime is reached with diffusivity scaling as @xmath137 .",
    "the latter regime is of course what matters for geophysical flows with @xmath138 , such as in the meridional overturning circulation , central to climate dynamics , but is it affected by the production of helicity ?",
    "we thus plan to pursue this study concerning the role of helicity in rotating stratified turbulence in order to help decipher the different mechanisms at play , a study that will eventually lead to better sub - grid scale models of such flows that are needed to obtain a more accurate representation of enhanced diffusivities in weather and climate models .",
    "we thank an anonymous referee for remarks that led to clarifications and improvements of the paper .",
