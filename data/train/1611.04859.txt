    "* ) the developed statistical methods basically involve : ( i ) dividing the full range of magnitude and colour of a given cmd into a grid whose cells have axes along the magnitude and colour directions , ( ii ) computing the expected number - density of field stars in each cell based on the number of comparison field stars with magnitude and colour compatible with those of the cell , and ( iii ) subtracting randomly the expected number of field stars from each cell .",
    "although the methods reapply the cleaning procedure using different cell sizes in the cmds , they are fixed each time , i.e. , they do not vary across the cmds .    from our experience in cleaning the field star contamination in the cluster cmds ,",
    "we have identified some situations which still need our attention .",
    "it frequently happens that some parts of the cmds are more populated than others , so that fixing the size of the cells in the cmds becomes a difficult task .",
    "small cells do not usually carry out a satisfactory job in cmd regions with a scarce number of fields stars , while big cells fail in populous cmd regions .",
    "thus , relatively bright field red giants with small photometric errors could not be subtracted and , consequently , the cluster cmd could show spurious red giant features .",

    "the cluster has been previously studied from 2mass and @xmath1 photometry . however , a relatively lower photometric accuracy and shallower limited magnitude , in combination with a not much pinpointed treatment of field decontamination led those studies to discordant results . in section 2",

    "the latter has a significantly higher throughput as compared with the standard washington @xmath9 filter so that @xmath8 magnitudes can be accurately transformed to yield @xmath9 magnitudes @xcite .",
    "we used a series of bias , dome and sky flat - field exposures per filter to calibrate the ccd instrumental signature .",
    "we also utilised images for the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) cluster lindsay106 , which was previously observed at la silla ( eso , chile ) with the @xmath7 and @xmath10 filters @xcite .",

    "they did not include haffner9 , although they made their @xmath1 photometry publicly available .",
    "the camera used to obtain those data was equipped with an sta 4064@xmath54064 ccd with 15-@xmath11 m pixels , yielding a scale of 0.289@xmath12/pixel and a field - of - view ( fov ) of 20@xmath13@xmath520@xmath13 .",
    "the ccd was operated without binning , at a nominal gain of 1.44 e-/adu , implying a readout noise of 7 e- per quadrant ( four amplifiers ) .",
    "their available photometry add significant value to our study , because of the larger fov and the fainter magnitude limit reached using a different telescope / photometric system setup .",

    "* hereafter h08 ) and concluded that the former needs to be corrected by :    @xmath14    @xmath15    @xmath16    in order to match the latter .",
    "as for the h08 photometry , we used the ridgelines in their cmds -thought to be the mean locus of the fiducial cluster sequence- , since the data are not available from the authors .",
    "we finally merged our washington @xmath0 and the corrected available @xmath1 data sets into only one master table , which we use in our subsequent an analysis .",
    "the pipeline followed in the analysis of the present photometric data sets involved : i ) define the cluster central coordinates and trace its stellar density radial profile ; ii ) derive the cluster structural parameters ; iii ) decontaminate the cluster cmd from field stars and ; iv ) estimate the cluster fundamental parameters .      in order to obtain the stellar density radial profile of haffner9 , we started by estimating its geometrical centre .",
    "we did that by fitting gaussian distributions to the star counts in the @xmath17 and @xmath18 directions .",
    "the number of stars projected along the @xmath17 and @xmath18 directions were counted within intervals of 20 , 40 , 60 , 80 , 100 pixel wide , and the gaussian fits repeated each time .",
    "the fits of the gaussians were performed using the ngaussfit routine in the stsdas / iraf package .",
    "we adopted a single gaussian and fixed the constant to the corresponding background levels ( i.e. stellar field density assumed to be uniform ) and the linear terms to zero .",
    "the centre of the gaussian , its amplitude , and its @xmath19 acted as variables .",
    "finally , we averaged the five different gaussian centres with a typical standard deviation of @xmath20 40 pixels ( @xmath20 16.0@xmath12 ) .",
    "the estimated geometrical centre was then used to built the cluster stellar density profile from star counts performed within boxes of 60 pixels per side distributed throughout the whole observed field .",
    "the chosen box size allowed us to statistically sample the stellar spatial distribution .",
    "thus , the number of stars per unit area at a given radius @xmath21 can be directly calculated through the expression :    @xmath22    where @xmath23 and @xmath24 represent the number of stars and boxes , respectively , included in a circle of radius @xmath21 .",
    "the advantage of this method over the frequent counting of stars in annular regions around the cluster centre relies on the fact that is not required a complete circle of radius @xmath21 within the observed field to compute the mean stellar density at that distance .",
    "therefore , it is possible to estimate the background level with high precision using regions located far away from the cluster centre . with a good placement of the background level , the cluster radius ( @xmath25 ) results , in turn , in a more reliable estimate .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] shows with open and filled circles the observed and background subtracted density profiles -expressed as number of stars per arcsec@xmath6- , respectively , while the errobars represent the rms errors . in the case of the background subtracted density profile we added the mean error of the background star counts . the background level and the cluster radius ( @xmath25 = 200@xmath26 arcsec )",
    "are indicated by solid horizontal and vertical lines , respectively ; their uncertainties are in dotted lines .",
    "we fitted the background corrected density profile using both @xcite and @xcite models in order to get independent estimates of the cluster core ( @xmath27 ) , half - mass ( @xmath28 ) and tidal ( @xmath29 ) radii , respectively .",
    "we used a grid of @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 values spanning the known range of radii of open clusters @xcite and minimised @xmath30@xmath6 .",
    "we finally derived @xmath27 = 70 @xmath20 10 arcsec , @xmath28 = 125 @xmath20 15 arcsec and @xmath29 = 400 @xmath20 100 arcsec , respectively . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] we superimposed the respective king s and plummer s curves with blue and oorange solid lines , respectively .          because fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] reveals that both cluster and field star sequences are more or less superimposed , we must firstly separate the cluster stars from those belonging to the surrounding fields on a statistical basis in order to meaningfully use that cmd to estimate the cluster parameters .",
    "note that both cluster and field stars are affected by nearly the same interstellar reddening , which is indeed what causes the overlapping of their main sequences ( mss ) .",
    "this fact makes the cleaning of the cluster cmd even more challenging .",
    "to filter the field stars from the cmds , we applied a statistical procedure which consists , firstly , in adopting two cmds from different regions located far from the cluster .",
    "the dimension of each selected field region was @xmath31@xmath25@xmath6 and acted as references to statistically filter an equal circular area centred on haffner9 .",
    "secondly , by starting with reasonably large boxes  typically ( @xmath32(@xmath9),@xmath32(@xmath33 ) ) = ( 1.00 , 0.50 ) mag  centred on each star in both field cmds and by subsequently reducing their sizes until they reach the stars closest to the boxes centres in magnitude and colour , separately , we defined boxes which result in use of larger areas in field cmd regions containing a small number of stars , and vice versa . note that the definition of the position and size of each box involves two field stars , one at the centre of the box and another -the closest one to box centre - placed on the boundary of that box .",
    "@xcite have shown that this is an effective way of accounting for the local field - star signature in terms of stellar density , luminosity function and/or colour distribution .",
    "next , we plotted all these boxes for each field cmd on the cluster cmd and subtracted the star located closest to each box centre .",
    "since we repeated this task for each of the two field cmd box samples , we found that some stars have remained unsubtracted once or twice .",
    "finally , we adopted as the cluster cmd that built from stars that have not been subtracted any time . in order to illustrate the performance of the statistical cleaning procedure , fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] depicts a single field - star cmd ( left - hand panel ) for an annular region around haffner9 with an area equal to that of the cluster , and the cleaned cluster cmd superimposed to the observed ones represented by black and gray filled circles , respectively ( right - hand panel ) .",
    "as can be seen , differences in stellar composition become noticeable when comparing field and cleaned cluster cmds .",
    "particularly , the cluster evolved ms is now clearly seen .",
    "we present in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] the whole set of cmds and colour - colour ( cc ) diagrams for haffner9 that can be exploited from the present multi - band photometry .",
    "they include every magnitude and colour for the whole sample of observed stars , those located within the cluster radius and those considered cluster stars from the field star decontamination procedure plotted with grey , red and black filled circles , respectively . at first glance ,",
    "the cleaned cluster cmds resemble those of a cluster with a moderate age , projected on to a star field not easy to disentangle from the cluster .    the availability of three cmds and three different cc diagrams covering wavelengths from the blue up to the near - infrarred allowed us to derive reliable ages , reddenings and distances for haffner9 from the matching of theoretical isochrones . in order to enter the isochrones into the cmds and cc diagrams we used the following ratios : @xmath34/@xmath35 = 1.25 , @xmath36/@xmath35 = 3.1 @xcite ;",
    "@xmath37/@xmath35 = 1.97 and @xmath38/@xmath35 = 2.62 @xcite .",
    "we started by selecting theoretical isochrones @xcite with solar metal content in order to choose that which best match the clusters features in the cmds .",
    "in this sense , the shape of the ms , its curvature , the relative distance between the red giants and the ms turn - off ( msto ) in magnitude and colour separately , among others , are features tightly related to the cluster age , regardless their reddenings and distances .",
    "note also that , by considering the whole metallicity range of the milky way open clusters ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and by using the theoretical isochrones of @xcite , the differences at the zero age main sequence ( zams ) in @xmath39 colour is smaller than @xmath2 0.08 mag .",
    "this result implies that negligible differences between the zamss for the cluster metallicity and that of solar metal content would appear , keeping in mind the intrinsic spread of the stars in the @xmath40 vs @xmath39 cmd .    from our first choices , we derived the cluster reddening by shifting those isochrones in the three cc diagrams following the reddening vectors until their bluest points coincided with the observed ones .",
    "note that this requirement allowed us to use the three cc diagrams , even though the reddening vectors run almost parallell to the cluster sequence . finally , the mean @xmath35 colour excesse was used to properly shift the chosen isochrones in the three cmds in order to derive the cluster true distance modulus by shifting the isochrones along the magnitude axes .",
    "we iterated this procedure for different ages as well as for metallicities [ fe / h ] = -0.5 up to 0.2 dex .",
    "we found that isochrones bracketing the cluster age ( log(@xmath41 yr@xmath42 ) = 8.55 ) by @xmath32log(@xmath41 yr@xmath42 ) = @xmath200.05 and the cluster metallicity ( [ fe / h ] = 0.0 dex ) by @xmath32[fe / h ] = @xmath200.1 dex represent the overall age and metallicity uncertainties owing to the observed dispersion in the cluster cmds and cc diagrams . as for the cluster reddening and true distance modulus , we obtained @xmath35 = 0.60 @xmath20 0.05 mag and @xmath43 = 12.5 @xmath20 0.2 mag , respectively .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] shows the adopted best matched isochrone overplotted on to the cmds and cc diagrams with a blue solid line .",
    "the cluster mass and its present mass function ( mf ) were derived by summing the individual masses of stars not eliminated during the complete cleaning procedure .",
    "those individual masses were obtained by interpolation in the theoretical isochrone traced in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] from the observed @xmath9 magnitude of each star , properly corrected by reddening and distance modulus .",
    "we finally attained @xmath44 = 2.2 @xmath20 0.2 .",
    "the uncertainty comes from propagation of the @xmath9 magnitude errors in the mass distribution along the theoretical isochrone as well as from considering stars subtracted once in the field star cleaning procedure .",
    "note that , when building the stellar density profile from stars not eliminated at any time , we obtained a curve which matches the king s curve drawn in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] .",
    "this very good agreement implies that the cleaning procedure subtracted an appropriate number of stars according to the stellar density of the backgroung / foreground field , so that the mass uncertainty would be smaller if we did not considered stars subtracted once .",
    "the resulting mf is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig6 ] where the errorbars come from applying poisson statistics . for comparison porpuses we superimposed the relationship given by (",

    "we obtained @xmath48 = 16 @xmath20 2 myr .",
    "if we considered non - oberved stars with masses between 1 and 0.5 @xmath3 and the salpeter s mass function , the relaxation times would increase in @xmath2 10 per cent .",
    "note that , despite the advanced state of dynamical evolution of haffner9 ( @xmath49age/@xmath48@xmath50 = 22 ) , the cluster still keeps its mf close to that of salpeter s law ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig6 ] ) .            finally , we employed the ` asteca ` suit of functions @xcite to generate @xmath51 2.2@xmath510@xmath52 synthetic cmds of a star cluster covering ages from log(@xmath41 yr@xmath42 ) = 8.5 up to 8.6 ( @xmath32log(@xmath41 yr@xmath42 ) = 0.01 ) , metallicities in the range @xmath53 = 0.012 - 0.019 ( @xmath32@xmath53 = 0.001 ) , interstellar extinction between 0.55 and 0.65 mag ( @xmath32@xmath35 = 0.01 mag ) , distance modulus between 12.3 and 12.7 mag ( @xmath32@xmath54 = 0.05 mag ) and total mass in the range 100 - 250 @xmath3 ( @xmath32@xmath55 = 10@xmath3 ) , respectively .",
    "the steps by which a synthetic star cluster for a given set of age , metalicity , distance modulus , and reddening values is generated by ` asteca ` is as follows :",

    "this is an important probe , since previous detailed photometric studies of this object led to different fundamental parameters .",
