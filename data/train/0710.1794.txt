    "the quantum impurity models , like the kondo and anderson ones have attracted the solid state physics community due to their complex and rich behavior as well as due to their applications to many strongly correlated physical systems.@xcite in recent years , the attention into these models has increased due to the advances in nanotechnology , which for example made it possible to build ideal `` single impurity '' systems with one quantum dot ( qd ) in which the kondo physics was clearly displayed @xcite confirming predictions based on the anderson model.@xcite . in other fascinating experiments , quantum corrals assembled by depositing a close line of atoms or molecules on cu or noble metal ( 111 ) surfaces",
    "have been used to  project \" the kondo effect to a remote place.@xcite the anderson model used to describe these systems has the additional complication of the particular structure of the non - interacting states , which can not be described by a constant density of states.@xcite however , it has been shown that the non - interacting green s function can be written as a discrete sum of simple fractions.@xcite    more recently , systems of several impurities or qd s have become a subject of great interest . for example",
    "non - trivial results for the spectral density were observed when three cr atoms are placed on the ( 111 ) surface of au.@xcite systems of two,@xcite three,@xcite and more @xcite qd s have been assembled to study the effects of interdot hopping on the kondo effect , and other physical properties driven by strong correlations .",
    "particular systems have been proposed theoretically as realizations of the two - channel kondo model,@xcite the so called ionic hubbard model,@xcite and the double exchange mechanism.@xcite in the last years , transport through arrays of a few qd s @xcite and spin qubits in double qd s @xcite have been studied theoretically .",
    "last year , dias da silva _ et al . _",
    "@xcite proposed a system with one interacting qd ( 1 ) with a hopping term @xmath1 to another non - interacting qd ( 2 ) , which in turn is hybridized with conducting leads .",
    "this hybridization is in principle larger than the charging energy of qd 2 , in such a way that the latter can be considered as non interacting .",
    "the model is equivalent to an impurity anderson model in which the conduction band has a lorentzian density of states of width @xmath2 .",
    "this is one of the simplest variations of the model in which the effects of a non trivial structure of the conduction band can be studied .",
    "it can also be regarded as the simplification of the anderson model used to describe the quantum mirage @xcite or a tight binding model for a ring with a quantum dot @xcite when only the resonance at the fermi energy is included .",
    "this simplification is qualitatively valid when the separation in energy between resonances is larger than their width . in the case of a constant density of conduction states and on - site energy @xmath5 below the fermi energy @xmath6 , for large enough coulomb repulsion @xmath3 , the spectral density of the impurity shows two broad peaks ( called charge transfer peaks ) at @xmath7 and @xmath8 , and another peak near @xmath6 ( the kondo peak ) .",
    "previous calculations of the spectral density of the impurity in the model for the quantum mirage @xcite and in confined structures @xcite have shown that the kondo peak near the fermi energy splits in two for certain parameters .",

    "in fact previous calculations for the spectral density of an impurity inside a circular corral show split peaks in the non - interacting case @xmath13 that turn into one peak as @xmath3 is increased.@xcite the splitting condition is proposed to correspond approximately to the equality @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the kondo temperature .",
    "however , the results presented to support this reasonable statement are limited .",
    "the spectral density is shown only for three particular sets of parameters .",
    "moreover , the ability of the nrg to describe peaks far from the fermi energy might be questionable because due to the logarithmic discretization , the resolution at a given energy @xmath16 is proportional to @xmath17 .",
    "in addition , the spectral broadening affects the resolution.@xcite    in this paper we use perturbation theory in the coulomb repulsion @xmath3 ( ptu ) up to second order @xcite and a slave - boson mean - field approximation ( sbmfa ) @xcite to study in more detail the spectral density , the conditions for the appearance of split peaks near @xmath6 , and the evolution of the energy scale @xmath15 with the parameters of the model .",
    "we also compare with exact results in the limit @xmath18 , and derived from the friedel sum rule.@xcite as explained in the next section , both approximations take a simpler form in the symmetric anderson model considered , and the ptu works better in this case , allowing us to describe new physics , and obtain reasonably robust results with comparatively simple mathematics .    for the sbmfa we used a straightforward extension of the method proposed by kotliar and ruckenstein to the hubbard model.@xcite",

    "this result is quite consistent with the ptu one shown in fig .",
    "[ comp1 ] .",
    "for example , a lorentzian fit of a side peak obtained with ptu gives a center at @xmath255 , an area 0.284 , and a total width 0.0147 ( smaller but of the order of @xmath189 ) .",
    "furthermore , taking these four delta functions artificially broadened as it is usual in nrg calculations ( using eq .",

    "[ comp1 ] , which is very similar to that shown in fig . 2 ( c ) of ref . , with central split peaks of intensity near 2 and only very broad bumps replacing the side peaks near @xmath257 .",

    "[ comp2 ] . for the same reason discussed above ,",
    "we believe that the splitting and intensity of the peaks for @xmath259 within the sbmfa are exaggerated . as before ,",
    "the ptu results predict narrower peaks near the fermi energy than the nrg results . for the smallest value @xmath260",

    "in contrast to that case however , some structure remains even at the highest temperatures .",
    "this can be understood qualitatively from the behavior observed in the exactly solvable limit @xmath201 .    , @xmath184 , @xmath216 and several values of the temperature @xmath262 .",
    "]    in addition , the evolution of the side peaks with temperature is more marked than in the case of constant @xmath171 , probably due to the fact that the broadening effects of the temperature are more noticeable when the peaks are narrower .    at temperatures higher than @xmath263 ,",
    "there is little variation in the spectral density .",
    "the result for @xmath264 ( not shown ) coincides with that for @xmath263 within the width of the line in the figure .",

    "[ tkc ] ) the characteristic kondo peak in the spectral density @xmath0 of the interacting qd near the fermi energy splits in two .",
    "this splitting was reported before in the context of the mirage effect @xcite ( but not discussed in detail there ) and in recent calculations using the numerical renormalization group ( nrg).@xcite our calculations using perturbation theory in @xmath3 and a slave - boson mean field approximation ( sbmfa ) agree qualitatively with these results , but predict narrower split peaks .",
    "moreover , we find that the side peaks of @xmath0 near the charge transfer energies are much narrower and higher that in the usual case of a flat @xmath171 and than the results presented in ref . .",
    "in section iii f , we have provided several arguments that indicate that the above mentioned discrepancies are due to shortcomings of the numerical technique .",
    "these can be partially overcome if density matrix renormalization group is used in combination with nrg.@xcite another way of improving the nrg results which has been shown to lead to sharper charge transfer peaks is to calculate the self energy as a ratio of two green s functions @xmath269 , and replace the result in eq .",
    "( [ gdd]).@xcite this has the advantage that the effect of @xmath270 is taken into account exactly .",
