    "the work of wyner @xcite led to the development of the notion of secrecy capacity , which quantifies the maximum rate at which a transmitter can reliably send a secret message to a receiver , without an eavesdropper being able to decode it .",
    "more recently , researchers have considered secrecy for the two - user broadcast channel , where each receiver acts as an eavesdropper for the independent message transmitted to the other .",
    "this problem was addressed in @xcite , where inner and outer bounds for the secrecy capacity region were established .",
    "further work in @xcite studied the multiple - input single - output ( miso ) gaussian case , and @xcite considered the general mimo gaussian case .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that , under an input covariance constraint , both confidential messages can be simultaneously communicated at their respective maximum secrecy rates , where the achievablity is obtained using secret dirty - paper coding ( s - dpc ) . however , under an average power constraint , a computable secrecy capacity expression for the general mimo case has not yet been derived . in principle , the secrecy capacity for this case could be found by an exhaustive search over the set of all input covariance matrices that satisfy the average power constraint @xcite . clearly , the complexity associated with such a search and the implementation of dirty - paper encoding and decoding make such an approach prohibitive except for very simple scenarios , and motivates the study of simpler techniques based on linear precoding .",
    "while low - complexity linear transmission techniques have been extensively investigated for the broadcast channel ( bc ) without secrecy constraints , e.g. , @xcite-@xcite , there has been relatively little work on considering secrecy in the design of linear precoders for the bc case . in @xcite , we considered linear precoders for the mimo gaussian broadcast channel with confidential messages based on the generalized singular value decomposition ( gsvd ) @xcite .",
    "it was shown numerically in @xcite that , with an optimal allocation of power for the gsvd - based precoder , the achievable secrecy rate is very close to the secrecy capacity region .    in this paper , we show that for a two - user mimo gaussian bc with arbitrary numbers of antennas at each node and under an input covariance constraint , linear precoding is optimal and achieves the same secrecy rate region as s - dpc for certain input covariance constraints , and we derive an expression for the optimal precoders in these scenarios .",
    "we then use this result to develop a sub - optimal closed - form algorithm for calculating linear precoders for the case of average power constraints .",
    "our numerical results indicate that the secrecy rate region achieved by this algorithm is close to that obtained by the optimal s - dpc approach with a search over all suitable input covariance matrices .    in section [ secii ]",
    ", we describe the model for the mimo gaussian broadcast channel with confidential messages and the optimal s - dpc scheme , proposed in @xcite . in section [ seciii ]",
    ", we consider a general mimo broadcast channel under a matrix covariance constraint , we derive the conditions under which linear precoding is optimal and achieves the same secrecy rate region as s - dpc , and we find the corresponding optimal precoders .",
