    "the following results about thin striping were shown .",
    "some non - exceptional fabrics in all species can be perfectly coloured by the assignment of different colours to all strands .",
    "[ thm:1 ]    if no colour is common to warps and wefts in the assignment of a finite number of colours to the striping of an isonemal fabric , then the necessary conditions : the same number of colours are assigned to warps as to wefts , and the vertical and horizontal sequences of the colours of the stripes are periodic with the same period , are sufficient constraints on the colours to allow perfect colouring by thin striping .",
    "sections 5 and 6 of @xcite were written on the erroneous assumption , conflicting with earlier sections of that paper , that there will always be redundant cells in a colouring .",
    "that is of course only the case when there are perpendicular strands of the same colour .",
    "this section , which should have been in @xcite , takes up the interesting possibility where there are no such strands and so no redundancy , there being stripes of two colours in each direction , a total of four colours  not too many to make an attractive pattern .",

    "@xmath27    .",
    "@xmath28    .",
    "lemma 3.1 of @xcite gives the necessary and sufficient condition for an assignment of all different colours to a thick striping of a fabric to be perfect , namely preservation of the stripes by the symmetries , followed by the conditions on the symmetries to allow this .",
    "no mention is made of conditions on the striping , but striping almost always has to be done with some care , as was noted by roth @xcite . in particular , the striping of wefts dictates how the warps can be striped , as is illustrated with four colours in fig .",
    "[ fig : nr12]a and b. these diagrams show two ways in which the fabric of fig .  [ fig:40a]b can be thickly striped perfectly with two colours in each direction . in each case",
    ", the striping in one direction dictates the boundaries of the stripes in the other direction .",
    "what one can not do is to stripe the fabric with its horizontal stripes as in fig .",
    "[ fig : nr12]a and its vertical stripes as in fig .",
    "[ fig : nr12]b . not that this can not be woven , but warp - weft - interchanging symmetries can not take stripes to stripes .",
    "the same condition of lemma 3.1 suffices for the same finite number of colours in each direction repeating cyclically with no redundancy . while this condition is a slight relaxation of the conditions for striping with two colours",
    " and therefore unavoidably with redundancy , it still bans twills and twillins as in section 3 of @xcite .",
    "that eliminates species 110 , 12 , 14 , 16 , 18 , 20 , 23 , 24 , 26 , 28 , 31 , 32 , 34 , 36 , and 39 leaving 11 , 13 , 15 , 17 , 19 , 21 , 22 , 25 , 27@xmath29 , 29 , 30 , 33 , 35 , 37 , and 38 .",
    "any fabric of these species should be perfectly thickly colorable with any number of colours greater than 1 in each direction .",

    "these are all from species that can not be thickly 4-coloured with twilly redundancy .",
    "that they can not be thickly 4-coloured with twilly redundancy led to the erroneous remark in @xcite ( which assumed , as explained in footnote 1 , that redundancy was inevitable ) that fabrics of species 38 ( p.  50 ) and 3339",
    "( p.  54 ) can not be thickly coloured with four colours at all",

    ", one sees that none of the thick - striping restrictions on species is relevant . and",
    "any striping in both directions with no redundancy will do ; what can go wrong with thick stripes mentioned in the previous paragraph can not occur with thin stripes .",
    "unfortunately , since what can be coloured that way is just longer or shorter strips , no interesting motif of a single colour can emerge , and two - coloured motifs seem not to be of much interest.b i recognize immediately a red and blue braid motif but must search for the green and yellow one that perfect colouring ensures . a possible exception to this claim is the smallest possible two - colour motif , just two cells , illustrated in figure  [ fig : nr8]b . ] as examples i give a thinly striped version of the three fabrics used to illustrate thick striping ( there not being two essentially different thin stripings ) in figures  [ fig : nr8 ] and [ fig : nr79 ] .",
    "the remainder of this paper determines the constraints on the fabric designs to allow perfect colourings by thin striping with twilly redundancy and how to arrange them . in @xcite",
    "the following result is lemma 4.4 .",
    "the assignment of a finite number of colours to stripes of an isonemal fabric can be a perfect colouring only if the colours of the warps are the colours of the wefts or no colour is shared .",
    "[ lem:1 ]    the order of the colours does not need to be the same vertically as horizontally .",
    "for example , figure  [ fig:69ab ] shows a five - colouring otherwise of roth s @xcite example of species 34 , catalogue number 10 - 107 - 1 .",
    "this topic will not be pursued here .",
    "@xmath32    the centres of the cross motifs are redundant cells at which strands of the same colour cross . in order for the colouring to be a perfect colouring , roth s colouring theorem @xcite shows that the symmetry group @xmath0 of the fabric must leave the redundant cells / blocks invariant as a whole and each element of the group must permute them , if at all , in a consistent way",
    ". the group @xmath14 of the fabric must be a subgroup of the group @xmath14 of the pattern of redundant cells , as in figures  [ fig:8dea]a and b. for a specific colouring of the wefts , say , as illustrated in figure  [ fig:69ab]b , the positions of the redundant cells must be chosen in accordance with the consistency requirement .",
    "this choice determines the colouring of the warps .",
    "from now on , warps and wefts will be coloured with the same finite set of @xmath3 colours . for thin striping ,",
    "the redundant cells may be arranged as @xmath33 twills , and for @xmath34 as various other isonemal fabrics , 6 - 1 - 1 , 8 - 1 - 1 , 8 - 1 - 2 , and including in particular the square satins beginning with 5 - 1 - 1 .",
    "fabrics will have order five or more , and redundant cells will be arranged as twills ( figg .",
    "[ fig:8dea]a and b ) .",
    "there is reason to consider mostly isomenal fabrics with order more than four because those of order four and less are few and mostly exceptional , but in order to consider colourings with three colours , one needs  there being no choice  to begin with the 2/1 twill ( figure  [ fig:8dea]a ) as a redundancy pattern . mainly because of their aesthetic appeal , but also for practical reasons",
    ", i intend to use three colours to represent what can be done with a twilly pattern of redundant cells for any odd number of colours , four colours for a twilly redundancy pattern for any even number of colours congruent to 0 mod 4 , and six colours for a twilly redundancy pattern for even numbers of colours congruent to 2 mod 4 .",
    "also , because side - reversing symmetries ( mirrors and side - reversing glide - reflections , half - turns , and quarter - turns ) of a fabric relate its opposite sides and one sees fabrics one side at a time , side - reversing symmetries have less appeal in striped fabrics .",
    "emphasis will be on fabrics with side - preserving symmetries just because their symmetries are visible when the fabric is striped",
    ".    for three colours , perfect colouring of non - exceptional fabrics can be done only with a twilly arrangement of redundant cells .",
    "[ thm:3 ]    the same colours must be used for warp and weft because three is odd .",
    "the only isonemal design to serve as a redundancy pattern with order three and a single dark cell per order length is the 2/1 twill .    here",
    "three strands are not standing proxy , as they will later , for larger odd numbers .",
    "similarly , four strands in the next theorem are not standing proxy for more .",
    "these two numbers of colours , like two , are exceptional .    for four colours , perfect colouring of non - exceptional fabrics can be done either with no redundancy or with a twilly arrangement of redundant cells .",
    "[ thm:4 ]    two colours in each direction will colour with no redundancy . with redundancy , there is the 3/1 twill and the apparent exception , 4 - 1 - 1 ( figure  [ fig:8dea]c ) , which must be shown to be useless .",
    "this design is exceptional both in being of order four and in being a member of no genus .",
    "it is impossible for the group @xmath14 of an isonemal fabric to be a subgroup of the group @xmath14 of 4 - 1 - 1 for several reasons .",
    "the glide - reflection axes of 4 - 1 - 1 are horizontal and vertical , and those of other isonemal fabrics are all at @xmath35 to the horizontal .",
    "the mirrors of 4 - 1 - 1 are at the right angle to be potentially useful , but they are @xmath36 apart .",
    "any selection from them ( for genus i or ii ) will be an even number of @xmath23s apart , and the isonemality constraint of @xcite prevents such a selection from combining with a diagonal period of 4@xmath23 ( or multiple of 4@xmath23 ) . finally , the centres of rotation , as the diagram indicates , fall only on alternate strand boundaries , preventing an isonemal fabric from falling into genus iii , iv , or v.    this does not say that 4 - 1 - 1 can not be the pattern of redundant cells for a thin striping , only that the only isonemal fabric for which it is useful is itself . unfortunately , when a design that is suitable as a redundancy pattern is itself coloured , the result is just stripes .",
    "compare figure  [ fig : nr8]b , 4 - 1 - 1 4-coloured with no redundancy .",
    "all that changes with a different redundancy pattern is the order of the stripes . with 4 - 1 - 1",
    "the order of the colours of the stripes is different in the two directions , but with a twill as redundancy pattern the order is the same in the two directions .",
    "it is obvious in twilly cases that no fabric with quarter - turn symmetry can have @xmath14 a subgroup of the 2/1 or 3/1 twill  or of any other @xmath33 twill doubled or not , since these twills fall into species with no quarter - turns in their @xmath14s .",
    "( 2/1 is of @xmath37 , 3/1 is of @xmath38 , 6 - 3 - 1 is of @xmath39 , and 8 - 3 - 1 is of subspecies @xmath40 . ) accordingly , no fabric of species 3339 can be perfectly coloured thickly or thinly with the same three or four colours vertically and horizontally  or , with twilly redundancy , any number of colours greater than two . call this the quarter - turn ban .",
    "on the other hand , some fabrics from all other species are perfectly 3-colourable by thin striping .",
    "the @xmath0 of the redundant twill 2/1 for thin striping with three colours , of subspecies @xmath37 and illustrated in figure  [ fig:8dea]a , contains perpendicular glide - reflections with axes not in mirror position and mirrors , allowing the possibility of fitting axes of species 132 among them .",
    "as the characteristic feature of these twills is diagonal lines of , say , dark cells , axes of the fabric to be coloured can be specified as through , between , or perpendicular to the ` dark lines ' of the redundancy twill .",
    "as figure  [ fig:8dea ] indicates , there is no shortage of mirrors and axes of glide - reflections perpendicular to the dark lines ; they occur at every opportunity , a mirror and two axes not in mirror position through every cell .",
    "no ingenuity is required to fit axes in this direction , and little in the direction of the dark lines for various clumps of species .    for subspecies",
    "@xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 , successive glide - reflection axes not in mirror position an odd multiple @xmath44 of @xmath45 apart can be placed along the glide - reflection axes between the dark lines that have that spacing .",
    "an example of this treatment is figure  [ fig:9ab ] , where a species-@xmath41 fabric is 3-coloured this way ; the redundant cells run half - way between the fabric s axes of side - preserving glide - reflection , which are not in mirror position . since the length of the lattice unit in @xmath23 units is 5 and the number of colours 3 , the length of the lattice unit for fixed - colour translational symmetry is 15 .",
    "other ways of arranging the colouring of these and other subspecies ( @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 , for example ) are possible ; all that is being indicated here is that there are _ some _ fabrics of each species 132 that can be so coloured .    for species @xmath49 , @xmath50 , 3 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 , alternate glide - reflection axes in mirror position ( @xmath49 , @xmath50 , 3 ) or",
    "alternate mirrors ( @xmath51 , @xmath52 ) an odd multiple @xmath44 of @xmath53 apart can be placed along the mirrors in the dark lines that have that spacing .",
    "then the other axes will fall on intervening mirrors .",
    "glide - reflection axes can lie on these mirrors regardless of parity of glide .",

    "an example of species 32 ( with the spacing of @xmath37 ) is shown in figure  [ fig:12ab ] .",
    "the disappearance of the mirror symmetry and half of the half - turns makes such a pattern less attractive than one hopes for unless there is extraneous symmetry introduced , and there is hardly room here .",

    "4cd of @xcite ) and @xmath91 must have both doubled . as well , the lattice unit for species @xmath120 is interesting because , while its square lattice unit can simply be doubled in both directions , taking it from level 2 to level 4 , the square at the intermediate level 3 is sufficient to make the weaving work for a torus , as can be seen in figures 7 and 8 of @xcite .",
    "when we turn to more than two colours , we find that everything is as for thick striping but simpler .",
    "given a perfect @xmath3-colouring by thin striping of an order-@xmath147 isonemal design , one needs to choose a suitable period parallelogram .",
    "since the design is given , with its various period parallelograms , both @xmath147-by-@xmath147 and oblique lattice units of the side - preserving subgroup @xmath5 , it is just a question of how many copies are needed . in the @xmath147-by-@xmath147 case , the smallest @xmath144-by-@xmath144 choice must have @xmath144 be the lowest common multiple of @xmath147 and @xmath3 , since each stripe of the colouring is one cell wide .",
    "the size of a lattice unit must be inflated ( if at all ) similarly .",
    "the smallest period parallelograms of any colouring can of course be assembled to make others as large as one pleases .",
    "consider the example of figure  [ fig:9ab ] , a 3-coloured species-@xmath41 fabric of order @xmath148 .",
    "the lattice unit shown in figure  [ fig:9ab]a is too small to become a torus with the colouring of fig .",
    "[ fig:9ab]b because it is @xmath149 . while the pattern repeats with the same colour with a translation of @xmath53 in the direction perpendicular to the axes , the illustrated lattice unit has to be repeated three times along the axes to bring the colours as well as the pattern into phase , making the torus @xmath150 . in this case",
    ", the @xmath144-by-@xmath144 square of the first paragraph of the section would be 30 by 30 with area 900 since @xmath145 can be 1 , as against @xmath151 for the oblique rectangle .",
    "more interestingly , the @xmath152 square / torus has 10 thin stripes of each colour in each direction , whereas the rectangle / torus has only a single strand of each colour in each direction , each crossing the torus six times on account of the way the strand s ends in the rectangular lattice unit match up in the torus .",
    "because a woven flat torus is a link in the sense of knot theory , it is of interest how many strands there are  the same number of each colour in each direction . as an example of what happens ,",
    "let us pursue the example of the previous paragraph .",
    "when the @xmath153 @xmath5 lattice unit is replicated to make the @xmath154 torus , a translational symmetry subgroup is created , for the successive images of the @xmath153 lattice unit , while woven identically , must differ by a cyclic permutation of the colours .",
    "the behaviour now being discussed is independent of how the torus is woven but depends solely on the dimensions of the @xmath5 lattice unit . considering vertical strands and starting with the strand next to the bottom corner of the lattice unit marked in figure  [ fig:9ab]a , they are yellow , red , and blue cyclically left to right . when these three strands , which we can call a tricoloured _ band _ reaches the upper boundary of the lattice unit , they are identified with the next band to the right by the identification of boundaries , and then the next , and so on until eventually they emerge at the upper right boundary of the third copy of the lattice unit to be identified with the band entering the lower left boundary upward",
    "this is identified with the band with which we began .",
    "there is a single band in each direction and so a single strand of each colour .",
    "the multiple - of - three dimensions required for torus formation with colours in phase ensure that the bands of the previous paragraph can be chosen as units that will not be split up as they pass across the torus .",
    "the twilly redundancy of the colouring ensures that the colouring of the bands in one direction is a cyclic permutation of the colouring of the strands of the bands in the other direction , but there is no reason for them to be the same .",
    "the @xmath154 torus is by no means the only possibility with this lattice unit .",
    "the short dimension can be multiplied by any positive integer .",
    "five gives an interesting result for the @xmath155 square torus .",
    "the five bands that enter the lower right side of the period parallelogram (= the torus ) reach its upper right side together , are identified with the five bands entering the lower left side , and rise to the upper left side to be identified with themselves respectively . as happens with any square period parallelogram at @xmath35 to the horizontal , the bands  and so all the strands  remain separate .",
    "there are five bands of each colour in each direction .",
    "any multiple of five gives the same result .",
    "what about non - multiples of five ?",
    "if the @xmath154 period parallelogram is multiplied by 7 to be @xmath156 , then as the five bands at the lower right boundary rise up through copies of the lattice unit , we know that , as they cross the boundary between the fifth and sixth copies of the lattice unit , they fill it as they did the lower right side  as they did in the previous paragraph .",
    "the multiples like 7 can be taken _ modulo _",
    "5  or whatever makes a square .",
    "seven gives the same result as two .",
    "crossing only two of the @xmath154 rectangles brings the fourth and fifth bands to the left end of the upper left side , with the first , second , and third bands following on .",
    "as the permutation @xmath157 has period 5 like @xmath158 for just one @xmath154 , each supposed band passes through each position on its successive crossings of the torus , and so there is actually only one band .",
    "the same happens for multiples congruent to 3 and 4 _ modulo _ 5 , making congruence to zero quite special .",
    "the primality of 5 , the apparent number of bands entering the lower right side , makes one band be the almost uniform answer .    when the apparent @xmath2 bands entering one side of the smallest period parallelogram , which is an @xmath5 lattice unit perhaps replicated to put the colours in phase , reach the opposite side of the period parallelogram they are permuted by running into a perpendicular side .",
    "call that permutation @xmath82 .",
    "a square period parallelogram has actually @xmath2 distinct bands , the index of the identity in the cyclic subgroup of permutations , in the example @xmath159 .",
    "when @xmath2 is prime , we have seen that , because the index of the powers of @xmath82 other than @xmath160 is one , there is only one band . when @xmath2 is composite there is room for different indices and therefore numbers of bands different from 1 and @xmath2 .",
