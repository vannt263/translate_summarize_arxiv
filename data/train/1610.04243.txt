    "practical and accurate representations of fully correlated canonical density operators are essential for the determination of both thermodynamic and dynamic properties of many - body systems .",
    "the description of the thermodynamics of a system provides access to quantities like entropy , heat capacity , and various susceptibilities , which provide insight into , for example , the nature of equilibrium phase transitions . on the dynamical side , equilibrium time correlation functions , which require sampling from the full equilibrium boltzmann operator ,",
    "lie at the heart of the description of linear and nonlinear spectroscopy,@xcite the determination of transport coefficients in condensed phase systems @xcite , and the calculation of chemical rate constants @xcite .",
    "the development of schemes that accurately represent the canonical density operator has been the objective of a large number of theoretical efforts that have , in turn , produced an impressive spectrum of numerically exact @xcite and approximate methods @xcite .",
    "however , despite significant progress , the calculation of static and dynamical properties of many - body quantum systems remains a challenging task .",
    "for many complex systems , the phase space formulation of quantum mechanics , as encoded by the wigner distribution , has provided a particularly convenient platform for the investigation of both dynamics and thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "while the phase space formulation provides a rigorous , if generally impractical , protocol for the evolution of operators via the moyal bracket @xcite , its utility lies in its compatibility with the semi - classical hierarchy of techniques .",
    "the incorporation of the wigner approach into these approximate methods not only sidesteps the complications associated with the moyal bracket expansion , but also allows for the choice of the level of sophistication and accuracy necessary for dynamical calculations .",
    "indeed , this is an essential factor as the simple ehrenfest @xcite , surface hopping @xcite , and linearized semiclassical initial value representation @xcite ( lsc - ivr ) schemes become the only practical approaches for many complex systems .",
    "in addition , the phase space framework has also been an integral component in the development of successful hybrid schemes that combine numerically exact quantum approaches or traditional perturbation theories with classical time evolution @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the wigner transformation of the canonical density for complex systems can rarely be obtained analytically , and its numerical determination contends with the challenge of the highly oscillatory phase associated with the fourier transform @xcite . nevertheless , a variety of approximations have been developed .",
    "these range from the simple replacement of the quantum boltzmann operator with its classical counterpart , an approximation that is only appropriate at sufficiently high temperatures where the zero - point energy is negligible , to sophisticated path integral - based techniques @xcite .",
    "these approaches have proven useful in the investigation of , for instance , vibrational spectra and relaxation rates @xcite , proton transfer problems @xcite , and quantum diffusion in para - hydrogen @xcite and liquid neon @xcite .",
    "the benefits of these approximations notwithstanding , the general accuracy of approximate wigner transformed density operators in complex systems has been difficult to assess , especially when used in conjunction with dynamical calculations .",
    "here we show that for impurity - type problems where the system - bath coupling is linear in the bath coordinates and the bath can be approximated as harmonic , the wigner transform of the canonical density operator can be obtained analytically .",
    "for this reason , we focus on the simplest nontrivial model that captures the relaxation and dephasing of generic quantum systems coupled to a quantum bath with arbitrary coupling strength : the spin - boson ( sb ) model .",
    "of course , even for the sb model the integration of the bath degrees of freedom required by the wigner transformation can not be achieved without a hamiltonian splitting procedure , achieved in the path integral framework by means of the trotter approximation .",
    "naturally , the formalism provided here is not restricted to the sb model , but is also applicable to any generalization where the bath remains harmonic and the coupling linear in the bath coordinate . to ensure that the resulting density operator can be used in conjunction with quasi - classical methods such as the ehrenfest and surface hopping schemes as well as with conventional semi - classical methods , we implement only the partial wigner transform with respect to the bath degrees of freedom .",
    "extension to the full wigner transformation can be achieved simply through use of the mapping variable @xcite or coherent state @xcite formalisms .",
    "importantly , the present scheme provides a computationally simple approach to the calculation of thermodynamic data for sb - type systems . by providing a numerically exact representation for the initial conditions used in dynamical simulations",
    ", this method also represents a important benchmark for the use of approximate wigner transformed canonical densities both in the static and dynamic contexts .",
    "this property allows us to demonstrate that the current method converges rapidly with respect to the number of path integral slices for a large region of parameter space , and that proper rendering of the canonical density can dramatically influence the accuracy of both thermodynamic and dynamic quantities .",
    "interestingly , the analytical expression derived here reveals the canonical density as a linear superposition of bath distributions with weights determined by the paths allowed in configuration space .",
    "it bears remarking that moix , zhao , and cao have previously developed a related and highly efficient approach based on the influence functional formalism for the calculation of the reduced density matrix of a system coupled linearly to a harmonic bath @xcite .",
    "the reduced density matrix , which corresponds to the partial trace over the bath degrees of freedom of the full canonical density operator , permits the calculation of thermodynamic averages of any _ system _ operator , but precludes calculation of any non - system property .",
    "in contrast , by providing an analytical form for the _ full _ canonical density operator , our approach permits the calculation of _ any _ thermodynamic average , albeit at a higher computational cost .",
    "another advantage of the present work is that , as stated above , it can be used to efficiently and exactly sample the initial conditions required for quasi- or semi - classical calculations of equilibrium time correlation functions .",

    "the reason for these restrictions is that the current treatment relies on the influence functional approach , which formally eliminates the bath degrees of freedom in the path integral framework @xcite .",
    "while this restriction may seem severe , it is noteworthy that a wide spectrum of problems in the condensed phase may be mapped to such a hamiltonian .",
