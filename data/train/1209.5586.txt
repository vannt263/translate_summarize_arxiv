    "the method of computing the finite - size correction developed in i @xcite is applied to the probability to detect neutrinos in pion decay . since a neutrino , charged lepton , and pion",
    "are described by a many - body wave function that follows schrdinger equation , the kinetic energy at a finite time is not a constant and takes a wide range of values , as was shown in i. consequently these waves include broad spectrum and show a diffraction phenomenon that is non - uniform in space - time . since the speed of light is an accumulation point of the relativistic waves , a two - point correlation function has the light - cone singularity and the probability to detect the neutrino is subject to a finite - size correction .",
    "the neutrinos are very light and propagate with almost the light speed , hence the correction becomes unusual and depends , in fact , on absolute neutrino masses which are not found from oscillation experiments .",
    "thus the correction becomes extremely large in its magnitude and size and has universal properties for the neutrino .",
    "tritium beta decays @xcite  have been used for determining the absolute value but an existing upper bound for an effective electron neutrino mass - squared is of the order of @xmath0 $ ] and the mass is @xmath1 $ ] from cosmological observations  @xcite . in these neutrino experiments ,",
    "higher precision and more statistics have been achieved and will be improved more .",
    "weak decay processes have been studied using an s - matrix of plane waves with asymptotic boundary conditions , where particles in the initial and final states are regarded as free waves without correlations @xcite .",
    "a decay rate , average life time , and various distributions of charged leptons have been computed , and perfect agreements with experiments have been obtained @xcite .",
    "these facts proved that the standard theory of electro - weak interaction is correct .",
    "neutrinos have almost the light speed and are detected at a distant position , hence they are similar to an electrostatic potential of a moving body , which has a finite - size correction in a form of a retarded potential . due to its extremely small mass ,",
    "the probability to detect the neutrino may depend on the distance between a source and observation positions . to study position - dependent probabilities ,",
    "the standard s - matrix of plane waves that satisfies a boundary condition at @xmath2 , which gives the values at the asymptotic regions , is useless .",
    "an s - matrix that satisfies boundary conditions at a finite - time interval t , @xmath3 $ ] , and has a position dependence is appropriate . because boundary conditions for @xmath3 $ ] are different from those of @xmath4 $ ] , it reveals different properties form those of @xmath4 $ ] .",
    "we compute the finite - size corrections of transition probabilities with @xmath3 $ ] expressed by wave packets .",
    "the wave packets vanish at a position @xmath5 if the distance between @xmath5 and the center position @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and satisfy the boundary conditions of the experiments @xcite .",
    "hence they are appropriate to study the finite - size effect and are used here @xcite .",
    "a pion is produced in a proton reaction first and decays next .",
    "the whole process is expressed in fig.1 of i. the first reaction caused by strong interactions was studied in i and the second reaction caused by weak interactions is studied in ii . from i , a particle in the final state retains the wave nature in the region of @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is a distance between the initial sates and final state and a coherence length @xmath10 in a high - momentum region , @xmath11 ,",
    "is given by @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the particle s mass and becomes for a neutrino of mass @xmath14 [ /@xmath15 and energy @xmath14 [ ]",
    "@xmath16=   10^{2}-10^{3 }   [ \\text{m}],\\label{neutrino - coherence } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus @xmath10 of neutrino are macroscopic lengths .",
    "hence a measurement of neutrino process at a near - detector region may depend on a distance @xmath17 , where @xmath6 and @xmath18 are the positions of the nucleus in the detector and target .",
    "detecting neutrinos at @xmath6 of a distance @xmath19 is studied in a usual manner . since the neutrino in this region",
    "is expressed by a plane wave that behaves like a free particle , the neutrino s number and flux behave like those of classical particles and the production and detection of the neutrino are treated separately .",
    "the neutrino flux is determined by its distribution functions of the number and velocity that are determined by the decay process and is used for calculation of the scattering processes .",
    "measurements in @xmath20 , on the other hand , are not treated by particle dynamics but by wave dynamics .",
    "the entire processes should be taken into account and be studied either by time - dependent schrdinger equations or by position - dependent amplitudes defined with wave packets .",
    "the wave packets are necessary to measure the quantities in this region .",
    "since the particles are identified based on signals generated by their interactions with a nucleus , atom , or larger system of matter , this unit of detector has a finite size and is expressed by wave packets . using wave packet representations ,",
    "the amplitude of detecting neutrinos in a pion decay is computed . the probability to detect the neutrino depends on the distance @xmath17 ,",
    "hence a naive neutrino flux is not defined uniquely .",
    "the uniform flux defined by the classical particles is necessarily constant and is not used here",
    ". it might be reasonable to define the flux here based on the number of events that the neutrino gives rise to .",
    "the probabilities can be computed relatively easily with a set of simple wave packets such as gaussian wave packets and are equivalent in more general wave packets .",
    "although they depend upon not only the distance but also the wave packet size , they have universal properties .",
    "so it would make sense to define a neutrino flux from the probability computed with the gaussian wave packet .",
    "thus we define the neutrino flux in this region from the probability to detect the neutrino .",
    "the idea is similar to define the electric field from a force that a point particle receives .",
    "the finite - size effects are actually large in the processes of detecting neutrinos at a macroscopic distance .",
    "thus the corrections are important when the theoretical values are compared with the experimental values",
    ".     shows an interference pattern . ]",
    "it is instructive to see how a single neutrino interference is observed .",
    "a neutrino produced in a pion decay propagates a finite distance before it is detected .",
    "a position where a neutrino is produced varies , so a neutrino wave at the detector is a superposition of those waves that are produced at different space - time positions .",
    "if these space - time positions are inside of one pion , as in fig.@xmath21 , the waves keep their coherence and reveal interference patterns . a condition for the interference phenomenon to occur , for one dimensional motion of the pion that keeps a coherence within the region @xmath22 and a velocity @xmath23 is obtained in the following manner .",
    "let a neutrino be produced either at time @xmath24 or @xmath25 from the pion prepared at @xmath26 and travel for some period and be finally detected at @xmath27 , then the waves overlap if @xmath28 is met , where the speed of light is used for the speed of neutrino @xmath29 .",
    "so eq.@xmath30 is one of the necessary conditions for the neutrino interference to occur in the one - dimensional space . for a plane wave of pion @xmath31 and",
    "the above condition is satisfied . for a high - energy pion of a finite @xmath32 ,",
    "its speed is close to the speed of light and the left hand side of eq.@xmath30 becomes @xmath33 .",
    "hence this condition eq.@xmath30 is written in the form , @xmath34 .",
    "when this length @xmath35 is a macroscopic size , the interference phenomenon occurs at a macroscopic length .",
    "we estimated the lengths of these particles in appendix of i and confirmed that this condition in three - dimensional space is fulfilled in a macroscopic distance .    an amplitude",
    "to detect a neutrino is an integral of a product of wave functions of a pion , muon , and neutrino and a velocity of a space - time position of transition of the pion to the muon has a component of the light velocity and the neutrino has almost the light velocity .",
    "hence they overlap in wide space - time area and the amplitude and probability to detect the neutrino get a contribution of a large interference effect .",
    "a neutrino flux becomes distinct from the naive value obtained from the standard method of using an incoherent probability .",
    "this paper is organized in the following manner . in section 2 ,",
    "we study an amplitude of detecting a neutrino in a pion decay process and compute a position - dependent probability in section 3 .",
    "for a rigorous calculation of the position - dependent probability , a correlation function is introduced . using an expression with the correlation function and its singular structure at a light - cone region ,",
    "the finite - size correction is computed in section 4 .",
    "implication to neutrino experiments , features of the finite - size corrections , and summary and prospects are given in section 5 , 6 , and 7 .",
    "position - dependent probabilities of detecting a neutrino and a charged lepton in a pion decay process are computed with a schrdinger equation at a finite time @xmath36 and an s - matrix of a finite - time interval t. they have various properties different from those at the infinite time .",
    "especially the final states in ultraviolet energy regions couple and give a finite and universal contribution .    a neutrino or a charged lepton",
    "is detected with a detector that is located in a macroscopic distance from the position of the initial pion . since their properties",
    "are determined from their probabilities in experiments , the whole process is studied .",
    "the process is described with a many - body wave function of the pion and decay products .",
    "the neutrino and charged lepton in the final state is highly correlated with the pion in the initial state and have a kinetic energy different from the initial value at a finite @xmath36 due to a finite interaction energy .",
    "hence the many - body state retains wave natures and a finite - size correction to the probability to detect a neutrino is expected .",
    "the scattering matrix of the finite - time interval @xmath37 $ ] is applied and a finite - size correction is computed using the wave packet representation .",
    "we find that the position - dependent probability is computed in a unique manner and reveals unusual finite - size correction which is understood as neutrino diffraction .",

    "the wave function eq.@xmath61 is a superposition of states and is written as @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath64 is a two - particle state composed of the muon and neutrino of momenta @xmath65 and @xmath66 .    at the infinite t",
    ", the oscillation function is approximated with @xmath67 and the two particle state has the energy @xmath68 @xmath69 the norm of this state is proportional to @xmath70 and is given by , @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the average decay rate @xcite .",
    "a neutrino and muon exist with a same probability that is computed from the norm of wave function .",
    "we should bear in mind that this is the probability that the decay products exist and a connection with an observation is not clear . since an observation of a neutrino is made with a detector that is located at a different position and a distance between positions of the pion and detector is usually large , the probability to detect the neutrino at the detector is defined according a geometry of the experiments with the wave function at a finite t , which is affected by a finite time and retarded effect .    at a finite t ,",
    "the oscillation function is broad in @xmath73 and eq.@xmath74 does not hold @xmath75 and the two particle state eq.@xmath76 has the continuous kinetic energy @xmath77 . the wave of the entire process in this region is described by latexmath:[\\ ] ] are determined by the roots of @xmath157 and the behaviors of the @xmath73 around the roots .",
    "the roots are on the ellipse of @xmath637 @xmath638 where the direction of @xmath191 is chosen to the x - axis .",

    "next we study the roots of @xmath157 of @xmath648 .",

    "there exist other roots of @xmath654 , away from the above root , which have different properties .",
    "because the ellipse is extremely long , the derivative of @xmath73 along the normal direction in the second solution becomes @xmath655 this value is extremely small and @xmath167 varies extremely slowly in the normal direction and the integral over @xmath646 deviates from that obtained from the infinite region by an amount that is determined by the @xmath656 .",
    "this gives the finite - size correction in the region @xmath657 .",
    "the finite - size correction has the origin in the root of @xmath157 at @xmath658 , hence does not hold properties that are derived from the energy and momentum conservation .",

    "for the detection of the muon , on the other hand , the muon velocity @xmath659 replaces the neutrino velocity @xmath110 in eq.@xmath660 and the ellipse for the muon obtained from @xmath661 with @xmath662 does not have large major axis .",
