    "indirect dark matter ( dm ) searches aim at seeing an excess in cosmic rays from the annihilation or decay of dm in the galactic halo  @xcite . very often , indirect searches focus on _ secondary photons _ from the fragmentation of hadronic annihilation products .",
    "the corresponding spectra are rather broad and peak at energies much lower than the dm mass @xmath0 , which generically makes a convincing claim of a dm detection above the astrophysical backgrounds difficult . in many models , however ,",
    "_ pronounced spectral features _ are expected at the kinematic endpoint @xmath1 ; they include monochromatic gamma - ray lines @xcite , sharp steps or cutoffs @xcite as well as pronounced bumps @xcite .",
    "the type and strength of these features are intricately linked to the particle nature of dm ; a detection would thus not only allow a convincing discrimination from astrophysical backgrounds but also to determine important dm model parameters like the value of @xmath0 .",
    "so far , only line - signals have explicitly been searched for  @xcite  despite the fact that they are loop - suppressed and thus generically subdominant compared to other spectral signatures @xcite . here",
    ", we discuss a general method to search for sharp spectral features in gamma - ray observations . concentrating on dm models with a large internal bremsstrahlung ( ib ) component , and on observations with imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes ( iacts )",
    ", we derive projected limits and prospects to see such signatures with current and future instruments .",
    "the defining aspect of the above - mentioned spectral features is an abrupt change of the gamma - ray flux as function of energy .",
    "it is therefore possible to concentrate the search for spectral features on a small sliding energy window @xmath2 $ ] , with @xmath3 , and window sizes of the order of a few times the energy resolution of the instrument .",
    "an important advantage of considering only small window sizes is that astrophysical gamma - ray fluxes can be typically very well described by a simple power - law .",
    "limits on and the significance for dark matter induced fluxes can then be derived by standard statistical methods like the profile likelihood method .",
    "we are interested in deriving projected limits on the dark matter annihilation cross - section that follow from the spectral end - point features of different dark matter scenarios _ alone _ , _ i.e. _  without taking into account secondary photons , using the above method .",
    "we will focus on observations of the galactic center region with iacts , considering benchmark scenarios that roughly correspond to the telescope characteristics of the currently operating h.e.s.s .",
    "( iact1 )  @xcite , the future cta ( iact2 )  @xcite and  as the most optimistic choice for indirect dm searches  the proposed dark matter array ( dma , iact3 )  @xcite . for the background ,",
    "we take into account cosmic - ray fluxes of electrons and protons , the diffuse gamma - ray flux and the source hess j1745 - 290 at ( or very close to ) the galactic center .",
    "we adopt an einasto dark matter profile , and a relatively small target region @xmath4 around the galactic center .",
    "the energy window size is chosen such that the impact of a nonzero background curvature on our final results is less than @xmath5 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) .",

    "[ fig : dmspectra ]    we will discuss three types of typical endpoint features that arise from radiative corrections to the tree - level annihilation process : ( 1 ) the most striking spectral signature , in terms of a possible discrimination from a power - law background , is a _ gamma - ray line _ , which would result from the direct annihilation of dm into @xmath20 , @xmath21 or @xmath22 .",
    "generically , the annihilation rate is loop - suppressed and expected to be of the order of @xmath23 ( although in some cases much stronger line signals are possible ) .",
    "( 2 ) as an example for a step - like feature we use the gamma - ray spectrum expected from annihilating _ kaluza - klein ( kk ) dm _ in models of universal extra dimensions  @xcite .",
    "its total gamma - ray annihilation spectrum at high energies is dominated by final state radiation ( fsr ) off lepton final states , and the shape of the spectrum @xmath24 , with @xmath25 , turns out to be essentially independent of @xmath0 and other model parameters  @xcite .",
    "( 3 ) pronounced bump - like features at @xmath26 may arise from ib in the annihilation of _ neutralino dm _ @xcite . here",
    ", bm3 is a typical example for a neutralino in the stau co - annihilation region , where photon emission from virtual sleptons greatly enhances the photon spectrum at high energies ; bm4 refers to a situation in which ib from @xmath27 final states dominates .",
    "upper limits on @xmath28 for selected dm models , dm profiles and observational scenarios ; bands indicate the variance of these limits . _",
    "thin lines : _ spectral feature of dm signal has @xmath29 ( after convolution with energy dispersion ) .",
    "the _ left panel _ shows limits on gamma - ray lines , rescaled by a loop - factor of @xmath30 for better comparison . in the _ central panel _ , the gray band indicates the expected @xmath31 for kk dm , the black part being compatible with the observed relic density . in the _ right panel",
    ", we indicate the adopted neutralino benchmark points , and the _ dotted lines _ show the projected @xmath32 sensitivity .",
    "the benchmark experiments iact1 , iact2 and iact3 correspond roughly to h.e.s.s . , cta and dma , respectively , see text for details .",
    "the figure is taken from ref .",
    "@xcite . ]    in tab .",
    "[ tab : dm ] , we shortly summarize the properties of the dm benchmark models described above , including for completeness the actual dm mass and total annihilation rate needed to obtain the observed relic density for thermally produced dm .",
    "note , however , that we essentially treat these values as free parameters in our analysis and that we are rather interested in the spectral shape of the annihilation signal , represented by @xmath24 ; in fig .",
    "[ fig : dmspectra ] we show these spectra for a direct comparison .",
    "in fig .  [ fig : cs ] we show our results for the expected @xmath33 upper limits ( thick lines ) on the above dm models as well as the variance of these limits among the mock data sets .",
    "we find that in particular ib features in the spectrum ( right panel ) have the potential to constrain the annihilation rate at least down to values typically expected for thermal production , @xmath34 , already for modest assumptions about the dm distribution . for models with very large ib contributions like bm3",
    ", we find that our method would provide even stronger limits on @xmath28 than what was obtained by the hess analysis of the galactic center region assuming annihilation into @xmath35  @xcite .",
    "for the case of not too strongly pronounced endpoint features ( like line signals in most models or the step for kaluza - klein dm ) , secondary photons will usually be more powerful in constraining the total annihilation rate @xmath28 .",
    "however , in case of an adiabatically compressed profile our limits could improve by maybe two orders of magnitude , as demonstrated for gamma - ray lines in the left panel . as shown in the central panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : cs ] , the future cta should be able to place limits about one order of magnitude stronger than currently possible , and the proposed dma could further improve these by another factor of ten .",
    "finally , we would like to stress that our limits in general provide rather _ complementary information _ on the dm nature and can thus usually not easily be compared with limits on secondary photons . in any case , from the point of view of indirect dm searches , the _ detection _ of the kinematic cutoff will be much more interesting than the detection of secondary photons , because they would provide rather unambiguous evidence for the dm nature of the signal as well as allow to determine important parameters like the dm mass .",
    "an obvious extension of the approach presented here is to apply it to the _ discrimination _ of models @xcite .",
