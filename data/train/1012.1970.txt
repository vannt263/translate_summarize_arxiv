    "the other data samples were recorded with the mb trigger condition and with two additional trigger conditions : a high - tower ( ht ) and a jet - patch ( jp ) . the ht trigger condition required the proton collision signal in bbc coincidence with a transverse energy deposit @xmath36 in at least one barrel electromagnetic calorimeter ( bemc ) tower , covering @xmath37 in pseudorapidity @xmath38 and azimuthal angle @xmath39 .",

    "the values for negative @xmath38 are expected to be negligible and thus less sensitive  @xcite .",
    "the current experimental uncertainties are statistics limited . in 2009 , the data sample collected at star is about 10 times larger than the above analyzed data sample in 2005 , and it is expected that the @xmath91 coverage of @xmath0 measurement be doubled and have the ability to distinguish between different models of polarized fragmentation and parton distribution functions .     and @xmath25 spin transfer @xmath0 in polarized proton - proton collisions at @xmath92 gev for ( a ) positive and ( b ) negative @xmath38 versus @xmath6 .",

    "the horizontal lines show model predictions . ]    in addition to longitudinal spin transfer , the transverse spin transfer of hyperons from the proton is also of particular interest in @xmath33 collisions , as it can provide access to the transverse spin content of the nucleon , i.e. , the transversity distribution , which is chiral odd and still poorly known in experiment@xcite . the transverse spin transfer @xmath93 with respect to the production plane has been measured by the e704 experiment , and sizable spin transfer was observed at large @xmath94 region  @xcite .",
    "we have started looking at the transverse spin transfer of @xmath1 ( @xmath4 ) at mid - pseudorapidities with tpc at star .",
    "a forward hadron calorimeter ( fhc ) may be installed behind the available forward meson spectrometer ( fms ) in the future at star , which may enable the reconstruction of @xmath1 hyperons at large @xmath95 region via the decay channel to @xmath96 with @xmath97 detected by the fms and @xmath98 by the fhc .",
    "the transverse spin transfer measurements in the forward region are expected to be sizable and can provide valuable information for the transversity distribution of nucleon .",
    "in addition , the longitudinal spin transfer @xmath0 of @xmath1 ( @xmath4 ) in the forward region can provide additional sensitivity to the strange quark polarization@xcite .",
    "in summary , we reported our measurements on the longitudinal spin transfer to @xmath1 and @xmath2 hyperons in @xmath3 polarized proton - proton collisions for hyperon @xmath6 up to @xmath7 with star data taken in 2005 . the spin transfer is found to be @xmath8 for @xmath1 and @xmath9 for @xmath2 hyperons with @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the longitudinal spin transfer is sensitive to the polarized parton distribution and polarized fragmentation functions .",
    "the present results for @xmath1 and @xmath2 have uncertainties that are comparable to the variation between model expectations for the longitudinal spin transfer at rhic . with the 2009 data ,",
    "the @xmath91 coverage and the precision of @xmath0 measurement is expected to be improved significantly .",
    "the possibility of measuring both longitudinal and transverse spin transfer for @xmath1 ( @xmath4 ) hyperons in the forward region at star is also discussed .",
