    "<S> we study the relative importance of  top - speed \" ( long - term growth rate ) and  acceleration \" ( how quickly the long - term growth rate can be reached ) in the evolutionary race to increase population size . </S>",
    "<S> we observe that fitness alone does not capture growth rate : robustness , a property of neutral network shape , combines with fitness to include the effect of deleterious mutations , giving growth rate . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , we show that growth rate alone does not capture population size : regularity , a different property of neutral network shape , combines with growth rate to include the effect of higher depletion rates early on , giving size . whereas robustness is a function of the principal eigenvalue of the neutral network adjacency matrix , regularity is a function of the principal eigenvector . </S>",
    "<S> we show that robustness is not correlated with regularity , and observe _ in silico _ the selection for regularity by evolving rna ribozymes . despite having smaller growth rates , </S>",
    "<S> the more regular ribozymes have the biggest populations . </S>"
