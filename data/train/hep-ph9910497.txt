    "in this paper , we have analysed whether in gmsb , the soft susy breaking mass spectrum can be such that the ( up - type ) higgs ( mass)@xmath1 ( evaluated at the weak scale ) is _ in_sensitive ( or weakly sensitive ) to the scalar ( higgs and stop ) masses at the messenger scale ( _ i.e. _ , the boundary scalar masses )  this has been called `` focussing '' in @xcite where _ supergravity _ mediation was considered .",
    "then , the stop masses ( and also other squark masses since they are related ) can be multi - tev _ without _ leading to @xmath277 at the weak scale ( and the consequent fine - tuning in electroweak symmetry breaking ) .    in minimal gmsb ,",
    "the higgs mass at the boundary is too small compared to the stop masses so that this focussing does not happen .",
    "also in minimal gm , the gaugino ( especially the gluino ) masses will also be multi - tev if the scalars are multi - tev , resulting in fine - tuning of @xmath4 .",
    "thus , in order for multi - tev squarks to be natural in ( non - minimal ) models of gm , we require a ) additional contribution to the higgs mass ( or a non - minimal mesenger sector ) so that the ratio of the higgs mass to the stop mass at the boundary can be higher ( to achieve focussing ) and b ) suppression of gaugino masses ( or a larger wino mass relative to gluino mass ) so that even if the scalar masses are multi - tev , the gaugino masses do not result in fine - tuning .",
    "we discussed ( general ) ideas to satisfy these two requisites and also studied concrete models of gm which have multi - tev ( @xmath278 tev ) squarks without leading to fine - tuning in ewsb . in some cases ,",
    "these models have ( in addition to @xmath279 tev squarks ) wino and gluino with a mass of @xmath13 tev ( without fine - tuning ) and right - handed slepton mass @xmath244 gev ( so that right - handed sleptons can be detected at tev lepton colliders ) and ( for very low messenger scales ) lightest sm superpartner which decays _ inside _ the detector .",
