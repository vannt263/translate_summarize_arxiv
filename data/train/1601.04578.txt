    "the study of the properties of strongly interacting matter in magnetic field has become a research topic of contemporary interest @xcite .",
    "the applicability of field theoretical calculations with the introduction of magnetic field lies in the study of the phenomenology of compact stars which are laboratories of high density matter and fields with strengths as high as @xmath5 observed in some magnetars @xcite .",
    "in fact , the incorporation of the magnetic field effects to color superconducting phases in the core of such stars can provide new insight into the physics of neutron stars @xcite . on the other hand , the other domain , namely relativistic heavy ion collisions ( rhic )",
    "can hardly be overlooked .",
    "recently , it has been proposed that for off - central heavy ion collisions , the intensity of the magnetic field due to presence of charged species can be as high as @xmath6 ( at rhic ) and @xmath7 ( at lhc ) @xcite",
    ". it will not be out of context here to recall that in view of comparable mass scales of mesonic matter with field strengths , the study of pions @xmath8and @xmath9 begs further attention .",
    "many authors have studied pion properties either restricted to the symmetric nuclear matter or performed calculations in the non - relativistic framework @xcite . in a recent work , the authors of @xcite have shown pionic mode splitting in asymmetric nuclear matter ( anm ) . using the approximation of the hard nucleon loop and suitable density expansions , they have studied pion propagation in matter in the framework of chiral effective lagrangian model @xcite . in @xcite",
    "they presented the density and asymmetry dependent pion dispersion relations and effective masses for the various charged states of pion considering both pseudoscalar and pseudovector representation of pion - nucleon interactions .",
    "it was shown that the effective pion masses had large values in the pseudoscalar representation compared to pseudovector representation . but none of them considered magnetic field effect in calculation of the self energies . in the context of heavy ion collisions , pions in nuclear matter might carry a bulk amount of entropy which is explained by a modified pion spectrum @xcite .",
    "the pion - nucleon physics has been further explored in the works of anderson @xcite where chiral perturbation theory has been used for the systematic calculation of the leading loop corrections to the thermal mass and decay constant of pions at finite temperature and magnetic background .",

    "the reason for the cancellation is either due to odd number of @xmath41 matrices or off diagonal elements of the metric tensor .",

    "we have considered the case of weak magnetic field for the numerical evaluation of our results . we have used the condition that the field strength is much lower than the squared pion mass @xmath69 which is our consideration for the weak field limit of the field .",
    "the pseudoscalar coupling @xmath70 is @xmath71 @xcite and for the pseudovector case , we have taken the coupling @xmath72 as @xmath73 @xcite . here",
    ", we have used the relation @xmath74 .",
    "quantum fluctuations will invoke the possibility of the usage of the schwinger s proper time propagators in presence of external magnetic field .",
    "thus , we obtain the vacuum contribution which needs to be suitably renormalized to eliminate the divergences in the theory . we have adopted the method of addition of mass counterterms for the ps coupling and method of subtraction of terms for the pv coupling respectively .",
    "the details about the renormalization procedure for ps coupling is highlighted in the appendix ( a ) .",
    "the correction terms which are quadratic in field parameter @xmath40 contributes to the self energy of pions at one loop order and are devoid of any divergences .",
    "the modified pion masses @xmath75 and @xmath76 are defined by the position of the pole of the effective propagator and setting the three momentum label equal to zero .",
    "further , the dispersion relation of the pions are evaluated numerically by setting the @xmath77 component of momentum up to a maximum value of @xmath78 gev .",
    "the bare pion masses have been fixed as @xmath79 gev and @xmath80 gev .    at first",
    ", we will consider the case of ps coupling of pions .",
    "fig.([fig1 ] ) displays the effective mass of pion @xmath81 as a function of the background magnetic field and shows a significant decrease in the effective mass for both the neutral as well as charged pions in ps coupling . in addition , it is seen in the inset of fig.([fig1 ] ) that the rate of decrease of the pion mass with the magnetic field is greater for the neutral pion than the charged pion .    in fig.([fig2 ] ) , we present the graph of the dispersion relation of neutral pion ( left panel ) and charged pion ( right panel ) for ps coupling scheme . in both the graphs ,",
    "the trend is similar in nature . in the limit of low @xmath82 of momentum",
    ", there is a moderate increase of the energy variable for different perpendicular components of the momentum @xmath83 @xmath84 and @xmath85 @xmath86 coupled with field strengths @xmath87 @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "in contrast to ps coupling , it is observed that for pv coupling the effective pion masses increases slightly with the increase of external magnetic field strength as shown in fig.([fig3 ] ) .",
    "the dispersions of neutral pion ( left panel ) and charged pions ( right panel ) are displayed in fig.([fig4 ] ) at different magnetic field strengths and perpendicular component of momentum ( @xmath90 ) .",
    "we observe the increasing nature of pion energy similar to that in case of ps coupling .",
    "it is noticed that for a fixed @xmath91 the dispersion relations are insensitive to the magnetic field both for ps and pv couplings .",
    "in this work , we have re - visited the modification of the pion dispersion relations by the introduction of the external magnetic field on the charged and neutral pions . for our purpose ,",
    "we have used schwinger s proper time method of fermion propagator in presence of background magnetic field to effectively describe proton propagators in the one loop self energy corrections .",
    "the effect of the external magnetic field appears as corrections of order @xmath26 over the vacuum contribution to the pion self energy which are relevant for the study of neutron stars and relativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "the phenomenology of pions in nuclear matter is generally described by a chiral invariant pion - nucleon interaction which leads to the additional lagrangian term @xmath92 known as the weinberg - tomozawa term in the literature .",
    "we have calculated the contribution from this term to the pion self energy .",
    "we have found that the contribution for the corresponding diagram for the @xmath93 interaction vanishes at the @xmath40 and @xmath26 order of the external magnetic field . from the numerical estimates , we conclude decreasing nature of effective pion masses in case of @xmath28 coupling while an increasing nature is noticed for @xmath94 coupling .",
    "we re - confirm the result of the vacuum fluctuation free field contribution to the pion self energy with an earlier work @xcite .",
    "the values of the weak magnetic field is considered up to @xmath95 as relevant in the phenomenological scenario .",
    "however , we do not include the medium modifications in our calculation which will be reported soon in a future work .",
    "the results obtained here serve as a theoretical framework for study at finite density and/ or temperature in presence of arbitrary magnetic field @xcite .",
    "finally , it should be noted that we have not incorporated the nucleon s magnetic moment in the present work .",
    "inclusion of this will contribute in @xmath40 order .",
    "however , we intend to investigate this in future .",
    "as the free space contribution of the pion self energy is plagued with infrared divergences , we need to add counterterms with the original interaction lagrangian to make it finite .",
    "therefore , the counterterm lagrangian is written as @xcite , _ ct=-_1_.(^2+m_^2)._+_2_^2 [ countl ] the values of the counterterms @xmath96 and @xmath97 are determined from the renormalization conditions as , _ 1&=&()_q^2=m_^2 + _ 2&=&()_q^2=m_^2",
    "we have obtained the following counterterms for renormalisation of the vaccuum fluctuation part , _ 1 & = & - + [ pn ] _ 2 & = & -+ [ pn ] these two counterterms ensure that the pion propagators @xmath98^{-1}$ ] reproduces the physical mass of pions in free space .",
    "thus the renormalized pion self- energy for ps coupling is obtained as , _ * r*(q , m_)=(q)-_1(q^2-m_^2)-_2 which we have used in the calculation of eq.([renormvacps ] ) .",
    "in this appendix , we highlight some of the important steps required for calculation of the pion self- energy using the lagrangian for ps coupling . we start by calculation of the traces of the terms in the self- energy as , & & tr + & = & tr + & & t_1 + ( e b)[t_2 + t_3 ] + ( e b)^2[t_4 + t_5 + t_6 ] where , t_1 & = & tr[_5s^(0)_a(k)_5s_b^(0)(k+q ) ] + t_2 & = & tr[_5s^(0)_a(k)_5s_b^(1)(k+q ) ] + t_3 & = & tr[_5s^(1)_a(k)_5s_b^(0)(k+q ) ] + t_4 & = & tr[_5s^(1)_a(k)_5s_b^(1)(k+q ) ] + t_5 & = & tr[_5s^(0)_a(k)_5s_b^(2)(k+q ) ] + t_6 & = & tr[_5s^(2)_a(k)_5s_b^(0)(k+q ) ] @xmath99 gives the field free case for the pion self energy . as mentioned previously in the text , @xmath100 and @xmath101",
    "are individually zero as the traces vanish .",
    "the terms @xmath102 and @xmath103 contribute to the first order in field corrections which are quadratic in the magnetic field variable . using the standard procedure of feynman parametrization ( fp ) @xcite , the non- renormalized vacuum contribution to the self energy is obtained as eq.([pi00 ] ) .",
    "further , renormalization of eq.([pi00 ] ) gives eq.([renormvacps ] ) devoid of any divergences .",
    "@xmath104 is evaluated as , t_4 = tr[_5s^(1)_a(k)_5s_b^(1)(k+q ) ] as we are considering the proton loop in fig.([fig0](a ) ) , both the masses are to be considered as proton mass .",
    "therefore , we re - write the above equation as , t_4 & = & tr[_5_1_2(.k_||+m_p)_5_1_2 ( .(k+q)_||+m_p ) + & = & 4 + where we have used , _ 1_2(.k_||)&=&(.(k+q)_||)_1_2 + _ 1_2q/_1_2&=&2(.q)_-q/    using fp ( and substituting @xmath105 ) , we obtain , t_4=where , @xmath106 .",
    "solution of the momentum integral is as follows , & & t_4 + & = & 4_0 ^ 1x(1-x)dx in order to evaluate the above integration , we will use 4-momentum integrals involving the parallel and perpendicular components . here",

    "<S> in this work , dispersion relations of @xmath0 and @xmath1 have been studied in vacuum in the limit of weak external magnetic field using a phenomenological pion - nucleon @xmath2 lagrangian . for our purpose </S>",
    "<S> , we have calculated the results up to one loop order in self energy diagrams with the pseudoscalar @xmath3 and pseudovector @xmath4 pion - nucleon interactions . by assuming weak external magnetic field it is seen that the effective mass of pion gets explicit magnetic field dependence and it is modified significantly for the case of ps coupling . however , for the pv coupling , only a modest increase in the effective mass is observed . </S>",
    "<S> these modified dispersion relations due to the presence of the external field can have substantial influence in the phenomenological aspect of the mesons both in the context of neutron stars as well as relativistic heavy ion collisions . </S>"
