    "in experiments and in numerical studies of critical phenomena , it is essential to take into account finite - size effects in order to extract correct infinite - volume predictions from the data . therefore , in recent decades there have been many investigations of finite - size scaling , finite - size corrections , and boundary effects for critical model systems . in the quest to improve our understanding of realistic systems of finite extent , two - dimensional models play a crucial role in statistical mechanics as they have long served as a testing ground to explore the general ideas of finite - size scaling under controlled conditions .",
    "very few of them have been solved exactly , the ising model @xcite and the dimer model @xcite being the most prominent examples .",
    "the dimer model is a two - particle system .",
    "the main difference between it and one - particle systems such as ising , heisenberg , or potts models etc .",
    ", is that occupation of a given lattice site ensures that at least one of its nearest - neighbor sites is also occupied .",
    "it is well known that , due to this non - locality , the critical behavior exhibited by the dimer model can depend on the lattice structure and shape ( square , triangle , honeycomb , etc ) .",
    "previous studies have shown that finite - size corrections in the free energy can exhibit a strong dependence upon the parity of the lattice , and this has provoked controversial conclusions about the value of the central charge from @xmath5 to @xmath6 .",
    "one can expect that such unusual finite - size behavior should also hold for the dimer model on other lattices and here we investigate the triangular lattice in particular .",
    "we are particularly interested in the finite - size scaling behavior of the specific - heat pseudocritical point . in finite systems the counterparts of the singularities which mark higher - order phase transitions in the thermodynamic limit are smooth peaks the shapes of which depend on the critical exponents .",
    "in particular , let @xmath7 be the specific heat at a reduced temperature given by @xmath8 for a system of linear extent characterized by @xmath9",
    ". in the infinite - volume limit , @xmath10 diverges at the critical point @xmath11 . in finite volume ,",
    "the analog to the divergence is a finite peak the shape of which is characterized by ( i ) its position @xmath12 ( ii ) its height @xmath13 and ( iii ) its value at the infinite - volume critical point @xmath14 . in particular , the position of the specific heat peak , @xmath12 , is a pseudocritical point which approaches @xmath15 as @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is called the shift exponent . in most models exhibiting higher - order phase transitions , the shift exponent coincides with the inverse of the correlation - length critical exponent @xmath18 , but this is not a direct conclusion of fss theory is not always true .",
    "for example , for the ising model in two dimensions , ferdinand and fisher determined that behavior of the specific - heat pseudocritical point matches that of the correlation length with @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "however , ising models defined on two - dimensional lattices with other topologies have shift exponents which differ from the inverse correlation length critical exponent ( see ref.@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "this is despite the fact that the critical properties on such lattices are the same as for the torus in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "a question we wish to address here is the corresponding status of the shift exponent in the dimer model .",
    "in contrast to spin models , the critical behavior of dimer models are strongly influenced by the structure of the underlying lattice .",
    "for example the square lattice dimer model is critical with algebraic decay of correlators @xcite , while the dimer model on the anisotropic honeycomb lattice , which is equivalent to five - vertex model on the square lattice @xcite , exhibits a kdp - type singularity and the dimer model on the fisher - type lattice exhibits ising - type transitions @xcite .",
    "thus , it appears that the dimer model itself has not a single critical behavior , but several critical behaviors associated with different classes of universality .",
    "it has been shown explicitly @xcite that the free energy per site for the dimer model on the square lattice is insensitive to the precise form of the boundary conditions in the limit of a large lattice .",
    "this is in contrast to its finite - size counterpart , for which sensitivity to boundary conditions is notable feature , in particular to the parity of the number of lattice sites along a given lattice axis @xcite .",
    "similar statements hold for the dimer model on the honeycomb and triangular lattices .",
    "very recently , it has been shown @xcite that the finite - size corrections of the dimer model on planar @xmath20 square lattices also depend crucially on the parity of @xmath21 and the boundary conditions and such unusual finite - size behavior can be fully explained in the framework of the @xmath1 logarithmic conformal field theory .    our objective in this paper is to study the finite size properties of dimer model on the plane triangular lattice using the same techniques developed in papers @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we introduce the dimer model on the triangular lattice with periodic boundary conditions . in sec .",
    "iii we discuss the finite - size corrections for an infinitely long cylinder of circumference @xmath2 and find that the dimer model on the triangular lattice can be described by conformal field theory with central charge @xmath1 . in sec .",
    "iv we investigate the properties of the specific heat near the critical point and find that the specific - heat shift exponent @xmath17 depends on the parity of the number of lattice sites along the lattice axis @xmath2 . for odd @xmath2",
    "we obtain for the shift exponent @xmath3 , while for even @xmath2 we find that the shift exponent @xmath17 is infinity ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "our results are summarized and discussed in sec .",
    "in the present work , we consider the dimer model on @xmath22 triangular lattice under periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the partition function is given by     triangular lattice with dimer weights @xmath23 in the horizontal direction , @xmath24 in the vertical direction , and @xmath8 in the diagonal direction.,scaledwidth=42.0% ]    @xmath25    where summation is taken over all dimer covering configurations , where @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath8 are , respectively , dimer weights in the horizontal , vertical and diagonal directions , and where @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are , respectively , the number of horizontal , vertical and diagonal dimers ( fig.[fig1 ] ) .",
    "the dimer model on the triangular lattice undergoes phase transition at the point @xmath11 ( and likewise for @xmath23 and @xmath24 ) , where the partition function is singular .",
    "thus the general triangular lattice model is critical in the square lattice limit .",
    "the dimer weight @xmath8 plays a role similar to the reduced temperature in the ising model . in what follows",
    ", we will set @xmath29 .",
    "an explicit expression for the partition function of the dimer model on an @xmath0 triangular lattice wrapped on torus has been obtained by fendley , moessner and sondhi @xcite and can be written as @xcite @xmath30 , \\label{partf}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 , \\label{dt}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for even @xmath32 .",
    "the notation @xmath33 corresponds to periodic boundary conditions for the underlying free fermion in the @xmath2-direction while @xmath34 represents anti - periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the boundary conditions in the @xmath32-direction are similarly controlled by the parameter @xmath35 .",
    "since the total number of sites must be even if the lattice is to be completely covered by dimers , we will consider two cases , namely even - even ( ee ) case when @xmath36 and @xmath37 , and even - odd ( eo ) case when @xmath36 and @xmath38 .",
    "note that due to the symmetry of the lattice the odd - even case ( oe ) ( @xmath39 , @xmath40 ) can be obtained from even - odd case by simple transformation @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is a aspect ratio .    * a ) .",
    "dimers on @xmath43 lattices *    in the even - even case where @xmath44 , the second product in ( [ dt ] ) may be compactly written as @xmath45 where the function @xmath46 is given by @xmath47 .",

    "this case has to be treated separately since at this point ( @xmath56 ) the partition function @xmath62 vanishes . as a result , we have @xmath63 at the critical point @xmath56 we have @xmath64 \\right\\vert \\qquad \\mbox{for } \\quad ( \\alpha , \\beta ) \\ne ( 0,0 ) , \\label{a1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath65 . in the derivation of the eq.([a1 ] ) we have used the identity @xcite @xmath66}=4\\left|~\\!{\\sinh}\\left(m\\omega+i\\pi\\beta\\right)\\right|^2 .",

    "dimers on @xmath69 lattices *    in ref.@xcite , it has been shown that in the even - odd case , the partition function given by eq.([partf ] ) and eq.([dt ] ) can be written as @xmath70    note that eqs .",
    "( [ ee ] ) and ( [ eo ] ) in the case @xmath56 coincide with the corresponding expressions for the square lattice ( see ref.@xcite ) .",
    "thus we can see that partition function for the dimer model on triangular lattice under periodic boundary conditions can be expressed in terms of the only one subject , namely , @xmath71 with @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "conformal invariance of the model in the continuum scaling limit would dictate that the asymptotic finite - size scaling behavior of the critical free energy of an infinitely long two - dimensional strip of finite width @xmath74 has the form @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the bulk free energy , @xmath77 is a surface free energy and @xmath78 is constant . unlike the free energy densities @xmath79 and @xmath77 , the constant a is universal .",
    "the value of @xmath78 is related to the central charge @xmath80 and the highest conformal weight @xmath81 of the underlying conformal theory , and depends on the boundary conditions in the transversal direction .",
    "these two dependencies combine into a function of the effective central charge @xmath82 @xcite , @xmath83 let us now consider the dimer model on the infinitely long strip of width @xmath2 under periodic boundary conditions .    considering the logarithm of the partition function given by eq.([a1 ] ) , we note that it can be transformed as @xmath84}\\right| . \\label{lnzab}\\ ] ] the second sum here vanishes in the formal limit @xmath85 .",
    "the asymptotic expansion of the first sum can be found with the help of the euler - maclaurin summation formula @xmath86 where @xmath87 , @xmath88 is catalan s constant and @xmath89 are so - called bernoulli polynomials and @xmath90 .",
    "we have also used the symmetry property , @xmath91 , of the lattice dispersion relation @xmath92 and its taylor expansion @xmath93 where @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , etc .",
    "thus one can easily write down all the terms of the exact asymptotic expansion for the @xmath97 @xmath98    from @xmath99 , we can obtain the asymptotic expansion of the free energy per bond of an infinitely long cylinder of circumference @xmath2 . since the expression for the partition function is different for even @xmath2 and odd @xmath2",
    ", we will consider these two cases separately .",
    "for even @xmath2 ( @xmath40 ) , we have @xmath100 and for odd @xmath2 @xmath101    from eq.([free2n ] ) using eq.([asymptoticexpansion1 ] ) one can easily obtain that for even @xmath74 the asymptotic expansion of the free energy is given by @xmath102 while for odd @xmath74 from eqs.([free2n1 ] ) and ( [ asymptoticexpansion1 ] ) one can obtain @xmath103 the bulk free energy @xmath104 is the same for @xmath2 even and odd cases .",
    "thus we find that the finite - size corrections in a crucial way depend on the parity of @xmath2 .",
    "in particular it means that due to the certain non - local features present in the dimer model , a change of parity of @xmath2 induces a change of boundary condition .",
    "the similar situation also happen in the dimer model on the square lattice , see @xcite , where a detailed analysis of boundary conditions and parity dependence effects has been carried out in this context .    since the effective central charge merely determines some combination of @xmath80 and @xmath81",
    ", one can not obtain the values of both without some assumption about one of them .",
    "this assumption can be a posteriori justified if the conformal description obtained from it is fully consistent . surprisingly , there are two consistent values of @xmath80 that can be used to describe the dimer model , namely @xmath1 and @xmath105 .",
    "for example for the dimer model on an infinitely long cylinder of even circumference @xmath2 one can obtained from eqs.([freeenergystrip ] ) , ( [ aperiod ] ) and ( [ 2nper ] ) that the central charge @xmath80 and the highest conformal weight @xmath81 can take values @xmath6 and @xmath106 or @xmath1 and @xmath107 . for the dimer model on an infinitely long cylinder of odd circumference @xmath2 one can obtained from eqs.([freeenergystrip ] ) , ( [ aperiod ] ) and ( [ 2n1per ] ) that the central charge @xmath80 and the highest conformal weight @xmath81 can take values @xmath6 and @xmath108 .",
    "it turns out in this case that another consistent conformal description exists , with @xmath1 and @xmath106 @xcite .",
    "in particular , it has been shown ( for more details see @xcite ) that although the dimer model is originally defined on a cylinder with odd circumference @xmath2 , it shows the finite - size corrections expected on a strip and must really be viewed as a model on a strip .    thus from the finite size analyzes we can see that two conformal field theories with the central charges @xmath105 and @xmath1 can be used to described the dimer model on the triangular lattice .",
    "but since the general triangular lattice model is critical in the square lattice limit and the dimer model on the square lattice belongs to @xmath1 universality class @xcite , we come to the conclusion that the dimer model on the triangular lattice can also be described by conformal field theory having central charge @xmath1 .",
    "let us now consider the behavior of the specific heat near the critical point .",
    "the specific heat @xmath109 of the dimer model on @xmath0 triangular lattice is defined as @xmath110 where @xmath111 is free energy of the system @xmath112 and where @xmath113 is the lattice area .",
    "the pseudocritical point @xmath12 is the value of the temperature at which the specific heat has its maximum for finite @xmath0 lattice .",
    "one can determine this quantity as the point where the derivative of @xmath109 vanishes .",
    "the pseudocritical point approaches the critical point @xmath15 as @xmath114 in a manner dictated by the shift exponent @xmath17 , @xmath115 is the characteristic size of the system .",
    "the coincidence of @xmath17 with @xmath18 , where @xmath116 is the correlation lengths exponent , is common to most models , but it is not a direct consequence of finite - size scaling and is not always true .",
    "since the expression for the partition function is different for even @xmath2 and odd @xmath2 , we consider these two cases separately .",
    "let us start with case of odd @xmath2 ( @xmath117 ) .",
    "expanding the expression ( [ specificheat ] ) about the critical point @xmath56 with the help of eqs.([ident1 ] ) , ( [ ident2 ] ) and ( [ eo ] ) yields @xmath118 where @xmath119 is the critical specific heat , and @xmath120 .",
    "we have @xmath121 from eq.([expansion specific heat1 ] ) , the first derivative of the specific heat on a finite lattice near the infinite volume critical point can be found , and it seen to vanish when @xmath122 to find the exponent @xmath17 one need the finite - size corrections to @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "the exact asymptotic expansions of @xmath123 and @xmath124 can be found along the same lines as in ref.@xcite and leading finite size behavior is @xmath125 expressions eq.([expansiont1 ] ) and ( [ expansiont2 ] ) now gives the fss of the pseudocritical point to be @xmath126 where @xmath127 is the characteristic size of the system .",
    "thus from eqs .",
    "( [ lamb ] ) and ( [ expansionmupseudo ] ) we find that the shift exponent is @xmath3 for odd @xmath2 . in fig .",
    "2(a ) and 2(b ) we plot the @xmath8 dependence of the specific heat for @xmath128 lattice .",
    "we can see from fig .",
    "2(b ) that the position of the specific heat peak is shifted from zero .    for even @xmath2 ( @xmath40 )",
    ", one can see from eqs.([ee ] ) , ( [ ident1 ] ) , ( [ ident2 ] ) , ( [ specificheat ] ) and ( [ freeenergymn ] ) that the partition function @xmath129 and the specific heat @xmath109 are an even function with respect to its argument @xmath8 @xmath130 the partition function given by eq .",
    "( [ partitionfunctiondimer ] ) is a polynomial function of its argument @xmath8 . in the case of even @xmath131 and @xmath132",
    "the partition function is an even function with respect of its argument @xmath8 and hence the number of diagonal bonds @xmath28 also should be even .",
    "there is also a simple geometrical explanation why , in the case of even - even lattices , the number of diagonal dimers should be even .",
    "let us consider an even - even ( @xmath133 ) lattice with periodic boundary conditions in the vertical and horizontal directions .",
    "such a lattice can be divided into two sublattice a and b , as shown in fig .",
    "each sublattice consists of @xmath134 sites in a such way that every horizontal or vertical edge connects a site in sublattice a to one in sublattice b , while diagonal edges connect two sites within sublattice a or two sites within sublattice b. note that such a division into a and b sublattices is impossible for even - odd ( @xmath135 ) lattices with periodic boundary conditions , since in that case , one can always find a horizontal or vertical edge which connects two sites in the same sublattice a or b. thus , in the even - even case , each horizontal or vertical dimer occupies one site from sublattice a and another site from sublattice b , while diagonal dimer occupies two sites from sublattice a or b. if one diagonal dimer occupies two sites from sublattice a one should have another diagonal dimer which occupies two sites of sublattice b in order to insure that remaining sites can be occupied by horizontal and vertical dimers .",
    "in the case of even m and n , only even number of diagonal bonds are allowed .",
    "similar geometrical considerations for the dimer model on @xmath136 lattice with free boundary conditions lead to the conclusion that for both even - even and even - odd lattices the number of diagonal bonds should be even .",
    "thus the first derivative of @xmath109 vanishes exactly at @xmath137 in fig .",
    "4(a ) and 4(b ) we plot the @xmath8 dependence of the specific heat for a @xmath138 lattice .",
    "we can see from fig .",
    "3(b ) that the position of the specific heat peak @xmath139 is equal exactly to zero .",
    "to2.0 in    ' '' ''    to3.0 in    ' '' ''    to2.0 in    ' '' ''    therefore the maximum of the specific heat ( the pseudocritical point @xmath12 ) always occurs at vanishing reduced temperature for any finite @xmath140 lattice and coincides with the critical point @xmath141 at the thermodynamic limit . from eqs .",
    "( [ lamb ] ) and ( [ expansionmu0 ] ) we find that the shift exponent is @xmath4 for even @xmath2 .",
    "thus we have found that the shift exponent @xmath17 for the specific heat depend in a crucial way on the parity of the number of lattice sites along the lattice axis @xmath2 . for odd @xmath2",
    "we obtain for the shift exponent @xmath3 , while for even @xmath2 we have found that the shift exponent @xmath17 is infinity ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "we analyze the partition function of the dimer model on @xmath0 triangular lattice wrapped on torus obtained by fendley , moessner and sondhi @xcite . from a finite - size analysis",
    "we have found that the dimer model on the triangular lattice can be described by conformal field theory having central charge @xmath1 .",
    "thus we have shown that the dimer model on the triangular lattice belongs to the same universality class as the dimer model on the square lattice , while the dimer model on the honeycomb lattice belongs to another @xmath105 universality class .",
    "in addition , we have found that the shift exponent @xmath17 depends in a crucial way on the parity of the number of lattice sites along the lattice axis @xmath2 : for odd @xmath2 we obtain @xmath3 , while for even @xmath2 we have found that @xmath4 . in the former case , therefore ,",
    "the finite - size specific - heat pseudocritical point is size dependent , while in the latter case it coincides with the critical point of the thermodynamic limit .",
    "this adds to the catalog of anomalous circumstances where the shift exponent is not coincident with the correlation - length critical exponent .",
    "the present circumstance manifests the additional feature that the shift - exponent is boundary - condition dependent .",
