    "the association of a permutation of @xmath1 with its graph provides a geometric viewpoint in which to consider pattern avoidance .",
    "thus , for example the permutation avoids @xmath2 if the points to the left of the highest point , all lie above the points to the right , and this condition is true recursively of the points to the left and to the right of the highest point .",
    "this condition is illustrated in figure [ 132diagram ] .",
    "likewise any set of @xmath3 points in the plane , no two of which lie on a horizontal or vertical line can be associated with a permutation of @xmath1 . in that case",
    "we can represent the geometric information about @xmath2 avoidance as a picture , with a point for the maximum , and two bounding rectangles to its left and right , the former lying above the latter , together with an implicit understanding that the structure within the rectangles is to be similar .",
    "these associations provide a geometrical context in which to consider pattern avoidance , and are a common tool in understanding the class of permutations that avoid one or more patterns .",
    "we explore some ramifications of this viewpoint in the very simple situation of @xmath0 avoiding permutations ( which we denote by @xmath4 ) .",
    "[ 132diagram ]    the main purpose of this paper then , is to show how the geometric context provides a simple method to obtain more detailed enumeration results about @xmath0 avoiding permutations than have hitherto been available .",
    "moreover , these results are obtained uniformly in some sense .",
    "the underlying technique consists of identifying a suitable geometric configuration which must be attained or avoided , and then using the structural constraints which that implies in order to compute the generating function , often multivariate , of the associated collection of permutations .",
    "this technique has applications beyond the scope of @xmath0 avoidance , a few of which we consider in the final sections of the paper .",
    "thought of as a set of points , a permutation avoids @xmath0 if it does not contain three points , every pair of which determines a line segment of negative slope .",
    "of course it is also the case that any @xmath0 avoiding permutation is the merge of two increasing sequences .",
    "it is easy to see that one of these sequences can be taken as the sequence of left to right maxima , that is , those elements which dominate all of their predecessors .",
    "these elements now determine a sequence of vertical and horizontal ranges in which the remaining elements of the permutation must lie .",
    "the situation is illustrated in figure [ basicdiagram ] .",
    "subject to having a fixed number of left to right maxima , the possible @xmath0 avoiding permutations that can be formed are in one to one correspondence with assignments of non - negative integers to the cells of that diagram , so that no two cells whose centres are connected by a segment of negative slope are assigned positive labels .",
    "we refer to this diagram , with the cells containing positive labels simply marked ( but the labels themselves suppressed ) as the _ skeleton _ of the permutation .    as is well known , the total number of 132 avoiding permutations of length @xmath3 and the total number of 321 avoiding permutations of length @xmath3 are the same , both being equal to the @xmath3th catalan number .",
    "however , the schematic representation of the @xmath2 avoiding permutations makes the correspondence between them and plane binary trees clear and hence also the equation satisfied by the generating function of the class , while the corresponding diagram for the @xmath0 avoiding permutations does not . in some sense @xmath4 is a class which exhibits more subtle structure than @xmath5 does .",
    "[ basicdiagram ]    alternatively we might replace each cell in figure [ basicdiagram ] with its central point , producing a triangular subset of the integer grid .",
    "given a @xmath0 avoiding permutation , the points corresponding to cells with positive labels determine a path in this grid , lying on or below a diagonal line and having steps which are of the form @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are non - negative integers , not both @xmath9 .",
    "this path is also shown in figure [ basicdiagram ] .",
    "such paths are enumerated in @xcite and @xcite , the former of which also provides a bijective interpretation of the relationship between their enumeration and that of standard delannoy and schrder paths .",
    "our objective is to find the enumeration via generating functions of various subsets of the @xmath0-avoiding permutations .",
    "generally we will aim to obtain a multivariate generating function ( in fact , at most bivariate ) say in @xmath10 and @xmath11 where the coefficient of @xmath12 might be the number of @xmath0-avoiding permutations of a certain type having @xmath3 left to right maxima and @xmath13 other elements .",
    "then simple substitutions will allow us to compute either the associated univariate generating functions , or permutations of size @xmath3 having @xmath13 left to right maxima , or other similar variations .",
    "whenever possible , the name of a generating function will reflect the name of the class that it enumerates , so that for example the univariate generating function for the class @xmath4 will be @xmath14 , while a bivariate form might be @xmath15 .    to carry out the enumerations of various structurally defined subsets of the collection of all @xmath0 avoiding permutations",
    "we will make use of the structural relationships that hold between the subsets and the class as a whole , and the corresponding algebraic relationships which hold for the generating functions .",
    "that is , our methodology is firmly in the school represented by @xcite , or @xcite .    in the next section",
    "we rederive equations describing the basic generating functions for @xmath0 avoiding permutations by defining a context - free language whose elements are in one to one correspondence with @xmath0 avoiding permutations .",
    "this method is used because it is no longer than extending the results of @xcite to the bivariate case , and also because it represents a technique of wider applicability in the field of pattern class enumeration .",
    "the following section then applies the results to the problem of enumerating the subsets of @xmath0 avoiding permutations consisting of : plus irreducible , minus irreducible , plus indecomposable , and absolutely irreducible permutations .",
    "these terms , and their significance for enumeration questions are defined below . in the univariate case ,",
    "only the last of these is definitely new , although we have not found detailed expositions of the others in the literature .",
    "in the penultimate section we make use of the enumeration of the absolutely irreducible @xmath0 avoiding permutations to enumerate another class , built from @xmath0 avoiding permutations by a recursive construction based upon the wreath product introduced in @xcite .    in the final section",
    "we try to foreshadow future applications of the methods illustrated here , and mention some connections with other work in the area of pattern classes .",
    "in figure [ latticepathdiagram ] we rotate the triangular grid from figure [ basicdiagram ] clockwise by @xmath16 , and then reflect it through the @xmath10-axis .",
    "the paths we then obtain begin from @xmath17 , and travel through lattice points ( the sum of whose coordinates is even ) along segments of slope lying between @xmath18 and @xmath19 inclusive .",
    "we will introduce a grammar which describes such paths .",
    "the purpose of transforming the original diagram is purely psychological .",
    "the grammar which we describe is the language accepted by a certain deterministic pushdown automaton , and the lattice path then models the number of elements held in the stack of this automaton as the word is processed . given our overlying motivation of considering pattern classes this also provides a nice link to the generation of @xmath20-avoiding permutations using a stack .",
    "allowing path segments of arbitrary rational slope in @xmath21 $ ] would obviously be a problem in a finite language .",
    "we avoid this problem by adding marks to the end of each path segment , and then replacing each segment by a horizontal segment followed by one at an inclination of @xmath22 .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ latticepathdiagram ] .",
    "[ latticepathdiagram ]    we now describe a context free grammar which generates a language that describes all , and only , the lattice paths which correspond to marked subsets of the triangular grid of size @xmath3 for some @xmath3 . constructing this grammar is relatively straightforward .",
    "we use four terminal symbols , three of which stand for unit segments in the path , and one of which represents a vertex in the set : h  for * h*orizontal segments , u  for * u*pward segments , d  for * d*ownward segments , and m  for * m*arking a vertex of the original path .    informally words in the language are described as follows :    * any change of direction after a d  or a u  requires an intervening m. * h s may only occur in blocks immediately following an m  or at the beginning of a word . * in any initial segment there must be at least as many u s as d s , but in the whole word the total number of each is the same . * m s can occur anywhere .",
    "this description is easily formatted into a grammar , modelled on the standard grammar corresponding to dyck paths ( which do not allow horizontal steps , and do not require marks ) .",
    "each non - terminal symbol in the grammar represents an excursion , that is a path starting and ending at the same level and not passing below that level .",
    "these excursions are sometimes restricted by the immediately preceding symbol .",
    "@xmath23    as in @xcite each non - terminal symbol of the grammar",
    "is associated with a generating function ( denoted by the same symbol ) in variables @xmath24 .",
    "this generating function is obtained by taking the sum of the monomials corresponding to words represented by that non - terminal .",
    "the grammar above is clearly unambiguous since in each rule the initial symbols of differing productions differ from one another .",
    "so , it is a simple matter to obtain a system of equations satisfied by the generating functions of the non - terminals , namely : @xmath25    using a symbolic algebra package or , in a pinch , by hand , this system can be solved .",
    "we are interested principally in the function @xmath26 describing words of the language , and this is described as @xmath27 where : @xmath28    given a word in the language , the number of left - to - right maxima in the @xmath0 avoiding permutation of which it is the skeleton is equal to one more than the sum of the number of h s and the number of u s . also , the size of the set that it encodes is equal to the number of m s .",
    "so , we can reduce to the generating function @xmath29 where the coefficient of @xmath12 is the number of skeletons with @xmath3 left to right maxima , and @xmath13 internal marked cells through the following substitutions : @xmath30 followed by multiplication by @xmath10 ( and addition of 1 for the empty graph ) .",
    "this yields : @xmath31 the first of these equation can be solved for @xmath32 , with the result being substituted in the second . after some further simplification this yields : @xmath33 by substituting @xmath34 we will obtain the total number of allowed markings .",
    "so , defining @xmath35 : @xmath36 the discriminant of the latter equation is @xmath37 illustrating a connection between these numbers and the schrder numbers ( sequence a001003 of @xcite ) . in fact : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the @xmath3th schrder number .",
    "this sequence of coefficients also arises as the number of _ non - crossing graphs _ , that is , graphs with @xmath3 vertices arranged as the vertices of a convex polygon , with straight edges connecting these vertices subject to the condition that no two edges should intersect at an interior point .",
    "this result is due to @xcite , with a more modern derivation , as well as other related results , given in @xcite .    if we consider the @xmath40 cells of the original grid as the vertices of a graph , @xmath41 , two vertices being adjacent if they are connected by a line of negative slope , then the coefficient of @xmath42 in @xmath43 counts the independent subsets of @xmath41 .",
    "the number of non - crossing graphs is also the number of independent sets in a graph .",
    "namely , take as vertices of the graph the possible edges two such vertices being adjacent if the segments which they represent meet internally . in this graph",
    "@xmath44 , a non - crossing graph corresponds to an independent set .",
    "so , the generating function for independent subsets of the sequence of graphs @xmath41 and @xmath45 are the same .",
    "in fact , inspection of the results in @xcite together with a little algebra shows that this is also true of the bivariate generating functions which mark the sizes of the independent subsets .",
    "that is :    for every @xmath3 and every @xmath13 , @xmath41 and @xmath45 have exactly the same number of independent subsets of size @xmath13 .",
    "however , it is easy to see that for @xmath46 , @xmath41 and @xmath45 are not isomorphic . for , @xmath41 has exactly four isolated vertices , while @xmath45 has @xmath47 isolated vertices .",
    "detailed expressions for the coefficients in @xmath43 and @xmath29 can be found in @xcite ( theorem 2 , part ( ii ) ) as well as discussions of their asymptotic expansions .",
    "before turning to the enumeration of various subsets of the @xmath0 avoiding permutations we begin with some remarks about the full class ( whose enumeration is , of course , already well understood beginning apparently from @xcite ) .    in our original setting ,",
    "the marked cells arose by considering a @xmath0 avoiding permutation having @xmath3 left - to - right maxima .",
    "we argued that any such permutation corresponded to a labelling of marked cells with positive integers representing the number of elements of a permutation contained in a particular cell .",
    "let @xmath15 be the generating function for @xmath0 avoiding permutations where the exponent of @xmath10 denotes the number of left to right maxima , and that of @xmath11 the number of remaining elements .",
    "since we obtain a @xmath0 avoiding permutation from its skeleton by replacing a single cell , marked by a @xmath11 in @xmath29 , by a positive integer , marked therefore by @xmath48 for some @xmath49 , we obtain : @xmath50 we can also make this substitution in the equation that @xmath26 satisfies and then simplify to obtain : @xmath51 on the other hand , it is perhaps more natural to count permutations of a common size .",
    "so , using @xmath52 to denote the generating function where the coefficient of @xmath12 is the number of @xmath0 avoiding permutations of length @xmath3 having @xmath13 left to right maxima , we obtain : @xmath53 by algebraic manipulation this function also satisfies a quadratic equation with coefficients polynomial in @xmath10 and @xmath11 namely : @xmath54 a further reduction in complexity occurs when we substitute @xmath34 in @xmath52 ( or @xmath55 in ( [ eqa1 ] ) ) giving : @xmath56 thus confirming , in a rather roundabout way , that the total number of @xmath0 avoiding permutations of length @xmath3 is enumerated by the catalan numbers .",
    "the coefficient of @xmath12 in @xmath57 , which is non - zero only for @xmath58 is a _ narayana number _ , @xmath59 a = \\frac{1}{n } { n \\choose k } { n \\choose k-1}.\\ ] ] these numbers also arise in @xcite , but not as a direct translation of this result since we are no longer in the context of path counting .",
    "they also arise in a number of other contexts including the enumeration of @xmath13-way trees ( @xcite ) and as the number of non - crossing partitions of @xmath3 ( @xcite ) .",
    "we now turn to the enumeration of various subsets of @xmath4 .",
    "first let us define those classes and the symbols used to specify them :    let @xmath60 be a permutation ( in @xmath4 ) . then :    ( @xmath61 ) : :    @xmath60 is _ plus irreducible _ if it does not contain a    subword of the form @xmath62 , ( @xmath63 ) : :    @xmath60 is _ minus irreducible _ if it does not contain a    subword of the form @xmath64 , ( @xmath65 ) : :    @xmath60 is _ plus indecomposable _ if it does not have a    proper initial segment whose values form an initial segment of    @xmath66 $ ] , ( @xmath67 ) : :    @xmath60 is _ minus indecomposable _ if it does not have a    proper final segment whose values form an initial segment of    @xmath66 $ ] , ( @xmath68 ) : :    @xmath60 is _ absolutely irreducible _ if it does not have a    proper subword of length greater than 1 whose values form an interval    in @xmath66 $ ] .    the irreducible or indecomposable elements of a collection of permutations can ( under suitable closure properties ) be thought of as components in the construction of the other elements of that class . again , granted certain closure and uniqueness assumptions , this can allow enumeration of the entire set based on an enumeration of one of the collections of components , or vice versa .",
    "this particular exposition of a general combinatorial theme is explored in @xcite .",
    "we note that the results in that paper could be used to derive the univariate generating function for the plus irreducibles and plus indecomposables in @xmath4 ( results which we will rederive here as a result of obtaining the bivariate form ) .",
    "furthermore , the only minus decomposable permutations that avoid @xmath0 are of the form : @xmath69 so we will not concern ourselves with that case .",
    "the condition of absolute irreducibility is a new one , and we will see its application in the next section .",
    "the definition is not so unnatural as it might appear to be at first sight . in terms of the graph of a permutation",
    "it says that if some proper , non - singleton , part of the permutation is bounded by a rectangle , then there must be at least one element of the permutation outside of the rectangle but in either the vertical strip or the horizontal strip determined by it .",
    "enumeration results in this section generally take equation ( [ eqs ] ) as their starting point .",
    "recall that this provides the generating function @xmath29 for skeletons of @xmath0 avoiding permutations , with the exponent of @xmath10 marking the number of left to right maximals , and that of @xmath11 the number of occupied cells .",
    "so , all the generating functions we compute will be in the form where the coefficient of @xmath12 marks the number of permutations of that type having @xmath3 left to right maxima and @xmath13 other elements . as usual ,",
    "a simple change of variable , replacing @xmath10 by @xmath70 and @xmath11 by @xmath10 would produce the function enumerating by total number of elements , and number of left to right maxima .",
    "if @xmath60 is a plus irreducible member of @xmath4 then no cell can be occupied by more than one element . among the diagrams that meet",
    "this criteria , the plus reducible elements contain sequences of more than one left to right maximum such that the vertical and horizontal bands which they determine are otherwise empty .",
    "suppose then that we knew the generating function @xmath71 for the plus irreducible members of the class .",
    "the preceding sentences imply that we would obtain the generating function @xmath29 by replacing @xmath10 in @xmath71 by @xmath72 .",
    "so , since the inverse of sending @xmath10 to @xmath72 is to send it to @xmath73 : @xmath74 substitution and simplification in equation [ eqs ] then yields : @xmath75 the corresponding univariate form is : @xmath76    an element @xmath60 of @xmath4 can only be minus reducible if some left to right maximum @xmath13 is followed immediately by @xmath77 .",
    "so @xmath78 for some @xmath79 ( with @xmath80 of course having all its values increased by @xmath13 ) .",
    "we can make this decomposition unique by requiring @xmath13 , @xmath77 to be the first pair of elements witnessing minus reducibility .",
    "then @xmath81 is minus irreducible , while @xmath80 could be any @xmath0-avoiding permutation .",
    "thus we obtain : @xmath82 or , solving for @xmath83 : @xmath84 the bivariate algebraic equation for @xmath63 is not very pretty , but the univariate form is more presentable : @xmath85    enumerating plus indecomposables is easier and standard .",
    "every element of @xmath4 is either of length @xmath9 or of the form @xmath86 where each @xmath87 is a plus indecomposable , shifted upwards by the sum of the lengths of the preceding @xmath81 s .",
    "since this decomposition is unique , then using @xmath65 to enumerate the non empty plus indecomposables , we obtain : @xmath88 which can then be readily solved for @xmath65 .",
    "finally we come to absolute irreducibility . since the absolutely irreducibles form a subset of the collection of plus indecomposables , and of the plus irreducibles , we begin with the form of the skeleton function which is like that for plus indecomposables .",
    "this already reduces us to permutations that are plus indecomposable , and plus irreducible in their non left to right maxima . @xmath89",
    "which , by now standard manipulations , satisfies : @xmath90    consider which non empty rectangles in the diagram associated to an element of @xmath91 might not contain other elements inside the vertical and horizontal strip which they define . in order for this to hold ,",
    "the top edge of the rectangle can not cross a vertical line in the triangular grid of cells , nor can the left edge cross such a horizontal line .",
    "so , the upper right and lower left corners lie outside of the grid .",
    "such a rectangle is illustrated in figure [ badrectanglediagram ] .",
    "the vertical area above the rectangle is automatically empty as is the horizontal area to the left .",
    "so problems can occur only when we have a non - empty sequence of left to right maxima such that there are no marked cells in the horizontal or vertical strip which they define .",
    "[ badrectanglediagram ]    if we knew the function @xmath92 how could we compute @xmath93 ?",
    "an element of the latter class could be obtained beginning from an element of @xmath92 by inflating some of the left to right maxima into a sequence of such maxima , adding no additional elements in the horizontal or vertical strips which they determine .",
    "if we imagine in figure [ badrectanglediagram ] that the illustrated rectangle ( and subrectangles of it ) are the only ones which cause a violation of absolute indecomposability , then that permutation has been constructed by inflating the left to right maximum just to the left of the rectangle into six such maxima . as we ve already insisted on plus indecomposability , a rectangle whose leftmost boundary is to the left of the first maximal can not be problematic , and so there always is an available maximal to inflate .",
    "there is just a single exception .",
    "the permutation @xmath19 is absolutely indecomposable , but when we inflate it we do not obtain plus indecomposable permutations .",
    "thus , beginning from @xmath94 , we should replace @xmath10 by @xmath72 in order to obtain @xmath93 .",
    "inverting this replacement we get : @xmath95 carrying out these substitutions and manipulations on the equations satisfied by the generating function yields : @xmath96 or in univariate form : @xmath97 in fact , this does not quite get us _",
    "all _ the irreducibles as it omits 1 , 12 , and the empty permutation . adjusting the equations to include this one comes at considerable cost to their appearance , so we prefer to leave the equation as it stands , adding the necessary @xmath98 to the generating function _ post facto_. table [ gfcoeffs ] summarizes the sizes of these subsets of @xmath4 .",
    "[ gfcoeffs ]    .sizes of @xmath4 and some of its subsets [ cols=\"<,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     .",
    "as an application of the final results of the preceding section we will show how the knowledge of the generating function for @xmath68 can be used to compute that of a much more complicated class . at the risk of further abusing a term which has suffered much abuse",
    "already we would like to introduce the class @xmath99 of _ fractal @xmath0-avoiders_. these are permutations which , from a distance , appear to avoid @xmath0 but which on closer inspection are made up of blocks , arranged in a @xmath0-avoiding pattern where each block appears to avoid @xmath0 but perhaps on closer inspection is in fact made up out of blocks ",
    "that is , @xmath100 if either , @xmath101 , or @xmath102 where    * the values occurring in each @xmath87 form an interval , * the permutation represented by @xmath87 is in @xmath99 , and * the relative ordering of the @xmath87 , interpreted as a permutation of length @xmath103 is in @xmath4 .",
    "many well - known permutation classes can be defined as fractal classes in this way , or occasionally as natural subclasses of such fractal classes .",
    "for example , the class of separable permutations is precisely the fractal class generated from the finite base class @xmath104 .",
    "there is a complementary bottom up description of @xmath99 .",
    "namely , this class is the closure of the class consisting just of @xmath19 under the operation of replacing an element of a permutation by a @xmath0-avoiding block .",
    "for example : @xmath105 where we initially replace @xmath19 by @xmath106 and then replace the element @xmath107 by the permutation @xmath20 while retaining its relative order within the entire permutation .",
    "geometrically , we begin with the graph of @xmath106 and then expand the vertex representing @xmath107 into a copy of the graph of @xmath20 .",
    "such replacements could just as easily be applied to each element of a permutation and , in some sense , they already have been , only @xmath19 has been replaced by @xmath19 in three instances .",
    "thus the two descriptions are equivalent  the permutation @xmath108 consists of blocks @xmath109 whose relative order is @xmath0-avoiding , and where each block is in @xmath99 ( in this instance , in fact in @xmath4 ) .",
    "we could also define @xmath99 algebraically using the wreath product operator of @xcite as the smallest non - empty class @xmath110 satisfying the equation @xmath111 where @xmath112 .",
    "this corresponds to the bottom up description , while the top down one would suggest @xmath113 .",
    "consider the first equational description of @xmath110 .",
    "since @xmath110 contains @xmath114 we also get that @xmath110 contains @xmath115",
    ". then also @xmath110 contains @xmath116 and so on . letting @xmath117 for @xmath118 , and @xmath119 we obtain @xmath120 on the other hand , the right hand side is contained in its wreath product with @xmath114 , and so by the definition of @xmath110 :",
    "@xmath121 the second equational definition can be manipulated in the same way and in fact , as the wreath product is associative , leads to the same equation , thus confirming that the two approaches are indeed equivalent .",
    "such an algebraic representation suggests that we ought to be able to transfer our knowledge of generating functions for @xmath114 to similar knowledge about @xmath122 .",
    "there is though , a small complication .",
    "this arises from the fact that the choice of blocks to witness the fact that a permutation belongs to @xmath99 is not uniquely defined .",

    "we include here the assumption that the relative ordering of @xmath142 through @xmath143 forms an absolutely irreducible permutation . if @xmath144 then @xmath142 is a subword of @xmath145 by the maximality of @xmath145 .",
    "now take the least @xmath146 such that @xmath147 contains @xmath145 .",
    "then in fact we must have @xmath148 for otherwise the values in @xmath145 and @xmath149 form overlapping intervals , and so the values in @xmath147 form an interval , contradicting the maximality of @xmath145 ( @xmath150 since @xmath60 is neither @xmath126 nor @xmath139-decomposable ) .",
    "however , @xmath148 contradicts the absolute irreducibility of the relative ordering of the @xmath80 s .",
    "so @xmath151 .",
    "but now the same argument implies that @xmath152 and , inductively that in fact @xmath153 and @xmath154 for all @xmath155 .",
    "we now return to the analysis of @xmath99 .",
    "let @xmath100 be given .",
    "suppose that it is neither @xmath126-decomposable nor @xmath139-decomposable . by the proposition above , @xmath156 for some subwords",
    "@xmath87 whose values form intervals , and whose relative ordering forms an absolutely irreducible permutation .",
    "since @xmath60 has some decomposition into subwords whose relative ordering avoids @xmath0 , and since the proof of the proposition above shows that the @xmath81 s form the coarsest possible proper partition of @xmath60 into subwords whose values form intervals , it must be the case that the relative ordering of the @xmath87 avoids @xmath0 .",
    "of course , we also have that each @xmath87 belongs to @xmath99 .",
    "conversely , given @xmath87 in @xmath99 , shifted to have relative order equal to some absolutely irreducible element @xmath123 of @xmath4 , then , by the very definition of @xmath99 , the permutation @xmath157 belongs to @xmath99 .",
    "let @xmath158 be the generating function for @xmath99 , taken to have constant term @xmath9 , and @xmath159 be the univariate generating function for the absolutely indecomposable members of @xmath4 of length greater than or equal to 3 .",
    "from the above we see that @xmath160 is the generating function for the elements of @xmath122 of length at least 3 which are neither @xmath126-decomposable nor @xmath139-decomposable .",
    "let @xmath161 denote the generating function for the @xmath126-indecomposable elements of @xmath122 , and @xmath162 that of the @xmath139-indecomposable elements of @xmath122 , again taken with constant term @xmath9 .",
    "then @xmath163 enumerates the @xmath126-decomposable members of @xmath122 while @xmath164 enumerates the @xmath139-decomposables .",
    "further relations arise from the observation that a @xmath126-indecomposable is either @xmath139-decomposable or both @xmath126- and @xmath139-indecomposable , and similarly for minus indecomposables .",
    "we thereby obtain the system of equations : @xmath165 solving this system for @xmath122 gives : @xmath166    we can use the work of the previous section to obtain a radical expansion of @xmath68 : @xmath167 then substitution in ( [ eqfrac ] ) and elimination of radicals gives : @xmath168 the first few terms of the associated power series are : @xmath169 and the exponential constant governing the growth rate , is the reciprocal of the radius of convergence of this series .",
    "this radius is the least positive root of the discriminant of ( [ eqfrac2 ] ) , which is an irreducible polynomial of degree @xmath170 . the value of the exponential constant is approximately @xmath171 , compared to @xmath172 for the underlying class @xmath4 .",
    "we began this paper with an explicitly constructed grammar to describe the skeletons of @xmath0 avoiding permutations .",
    "in general there is a close connection between combinatorial classes with algebraic generating functions and unambiguous context free languages .",
    "this connection can either be used , as here , to provide an explicit enumeration of a class , or to provide a `` soft '' proof that the generating function of a class is in fact algebraic .",
    "the former approach has become much more attractive with the ready availability of symbolic algebra packages since the algebraic manipulations necessary to solve the equations arising from the grammar are undeniably tedious .",
    "the latter approach has been used in @xcite to provide algebraicity results for a family of pattern classes .",
    "it can also be used in the context of generating functions for generating trees , thereby generalizing a number of the theorems in @xcite about the existence of algebraic generating functions .",
    "it must be noted though that the results of that paper and similar results in @xcite provide much more explicit detail concerning the generating functions that they produce .",
    "one of the striking features of the equations for the various irreducible and indecomposable subsets of @xmath4 is their simplicity . in some sense then the enumerative coincidences that we observed are not so startling , since there is a relatively limited supply of simple quadratic equations . because of the simple form of these equations , one could apply lagrange inversion to obtain explicit formulae for many of the coefficients , as is done for example in @xcite , or indeed carry out detailed asymptotic analyses of these coefficients .",
    "we restricted ourselves to bivariate generating functions but the reader should note that the techniques employed can be naturally applied to produce other statistics of these permutations .",
    "for example , it would be a simple matter to produce , if one wished , a generating function @xmath173 where @xmath10 marked total size , @xmath11 marked left to right maxima , @xmath174 marked the number of occurences of @xmath175 among the left to right maxima , and @xmath176 that number among the remaining elements .",
    "the class @xmath4 is the simplest pattern class , in terms of the patterns which it avoids , that contains infinitely many absolutely irreducibles .",
    "the techniques used in the preceding section to solve ( in the sense of enumeration ) the wreath fixed point equation : @xmath177 apply , owing to proposition [ indecomposablepartition ] , completely generally to any base class @xmath114 in which the absolutely irreducibles can be enumerated . in particular for a positive integer @xmath3 let @xmath178 be the class of permutations which `` fractally have @xmath179 elements '' .",
    "that is , they are comprised of at most @xmath3 blocks , each of which is comprised of at most @xmath3 blocks , each of which  then @xmath178 is the solution of the fixed point equation : @xmath180 where @xmath181 is the class of permutations of size @xmath179 .",
    "since @xmath181 is finite equation ( [ eqfrac ] ) is simply a polynomial and we obtain :    each of the classes @xmath178 has an algebraic generating function .",
    "there is much further information to be gleaned from the representation of a class as a subclass of @xmath178 when this is possible , and we hope to explore these matters in a future paper .    one aspect of @xmath99 that has been notably omitted is a description in terms of minimal forbidden patterns .",
    "it appears that this set may be finite consisting of : @xmath182 but all that can be said with certainty at this point is that no further minimal forbidden patterns exist of length 12 or less .",
    "many of the connections between these problems and known results would have been missed without the electronic version of the encyclopedia of integer sequences ( @xcite ) .",
    "mike atkinson listened patiently to many preliminary , and incorrect , expositions , and also provided a key step in the proof of proposition [ indecomposablepartition ] .",
