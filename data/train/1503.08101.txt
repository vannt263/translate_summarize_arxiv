    "while many features of black hole spacetimes can be investigated in terms of the motion of ( massive and massless ) particles , wave propagation opens a perspective on additional phenomena such as interference effects , scattering of radiation at a black hole , its quasi - normal modes and black hole evaporation .",
    "scattering and interference patterns have proven to be very important tools in other branches of physics and yield observational properties of different physical systems . therefore , it is of great relevance to consider black - hole scattering as well and to describe the dynamics of fields in the presence of a black hole for different boundary and initial conditions .",
    "the central equation that describes the propagation of massless waves on schwarzschild background spacetime is the general ( time - dependent ) regge - wheeler equation which is a wave equation written in the usual schwarzschild time and the so - called tortoise coordinate .",
    "regge and wheeler found this equation for spin @xmath2 by investigating the stability of a schwarzschild black hole under gravitational perturbations in a linearized perturbation theory @xcite . to study electromagnetic wave propagation",
    "one can solve maxwell s equations on flat spacetime but consider a medium with specified constitutive relations @xcite .",
    "another possibility to derive the regge - wheeler equation for @xmath3 is to use the so - called debye equation , because the source - free maxwell equations reduce to this single scalar equation on a schwarzschild background @xcite . for scalar perturbations and their propagation",
    "the klein - gordon equation has to be employed and the regge - wheeler equation for @xmath4 follows from a straight - forward calculation @xcite . for each of the three different types of perturbations the respective regge - wheeler - type equation follows after an expansion of the fields into ( tensorial , vectorial and scalar ) spherical harmonics .",
    "assuming additionally a harmonic time dependence , i.e. , fourier expanding the solution of this wave equation , leads to a radial equation that is known as the stationary regge - wheeler equation .",
    "this radial equation is a schrdinger - type differential equation with a spin - dependent potential barrier . due to the form of this potential no exact solution",
    "is known as long as the tortoise coordinate is kept as the radial variable .",
    "changing the coordinate system and reconsidering the previous wave equations gives rise to new radial equations that admit analytic solutions in terms of series of special functions such as hypergeometric or coulomb wave functions , see e.g. ref .",
    "another very insightful method is to use the heun functions @xcite and the theoretical framework of singularity analysis to construct analytic ( local ) solutions to the radial equations .",
    "we will follow this strategy to a great extent in this article .",
    "we start with some necessary preparations in sec . [",

    "we combine the results to obtain the general regge - wheeler equation that has the form of the previously discussed wave equation in the tortoise coordinate and can , thus , be transformed to the respective wave equations in the other coordinate systems .    in sec .",

    "a lot about the phenomenology can be learned from this simplest form of the radial equation .",
    "we describe asymptotic solutions that fulfill the causal boundary condition at the horizon , the so - called in - mode for scattering and the qnm - asymptotics . here and in the following",
    ", qnm stands for quasi - normal modes .",
    "since there is no known exact analytic solution of the stationary regge - wheeler equation beyond the asymptotic behavior , approximations or numerical methods have to be used to obtain the full solutions of this equation .",
    "afterwards , we derive the radial equation in the usual schwarzschild coordinate , which was already considered e.g. by leaver @xcite and fiziev @xcite .",
    "we briefly summarize their results and give properties as well as local solutions of this radial equation .",
    "all these solutions have only finite and non - sufficient domains of convergence and there is no regular solution at the black hole horizon that allows to penetrate this radius .    in sec .",

    "the singly confluent heun equation ( che ) belongs to the remarkably large class of heun s differential equations .",
    "all members of this class can be derived from a single second order fuchsian differential equation of the form with four singularities , the general heun equation ( ghe ) , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "there are four different confluent cases which are obtained through ( consecutive ) confluence processes of regular singularities . in the case of the che , two regular singularities of the ghe , one of them located at infinity ,",
    "merge and form an irregular singularity .",
    "one standard form of this che is given by , where the coefficient functions are    [ eq : che ] @xmath15    and regular singularities are located at @xmath16 . by considering the transformation @xmath17 we find an irregular singularity at @xmath18 , i.e. , @xmath19 .",
    "the three singularities can be further characterized by their singular rank ( s - rank ) .",
    "the s - rank of a regular singularity is by definition always equal to one , so we only have to calculate the rank of the irregular singularity . for the equation in the form this s - rank",
    "is found to be two , where we follow the convention in ref .",
    "the generalized riemann scheme ( grs ) , in the form proposed by slavyanov and lay @xcite , is a very useful tool in the analysis of singular differential equations .",
    "it contains    * s - ranks and locations of all singularities ( 1st and 2nd row ) , * indicial ( characteristic ) exponents of the regular singularities ( 3rd and 4th row ) and * characteristic exponents of second kind for the irregular singularity ( 3rd row and following ) .",
    "the corresponding grs for the confluent heun equation in the form is @xmath20 and yields all necessary information about properties of local solutions at the singularities of the differential equation : around both regular singularities local frobenius - type solutions @xcite can be constructed using the entries of the first and second column of the grs and we can construct thom - type solutions ( asymptotic series ) at the irregular singularity with the help of the third column .      the two local frobenius solutions around the regular singularity at @xmath21 are    @xmath22    and those around the other regular singularity at @xmath23 are given by    @xmath24    the series expansion coefficients @xmath25 and @xmath26 can be obtained by inserting the respective solutions from above into the che and solving the resulting three term recurrence relations with chosen initial conditions . here and in what follows , we use the following notation : the superscript is either @xmath27 or @xmath28 to distinguish the two independent local solutions , while the corresponding singularity , at which the solution is constructed , is given in the argument after the semicolon .",
    "the local frobenius solutions @xmath29 are convergent within a circle in the complex plane , centered at the respective regular singularity with a radius that is the distance to the next neighboring singular point .",
    "hence , in each case the region of convergence is bounded by the unit circle centered at the considered singularity .",
    "we emphasize that at each regular singularity @xmath30 the solutions have the asymptotic behavior @xmath31 where the ( complex ) exponent @xmath32 is either @xmath33 or @xmath34 , depending on which of the two singularities is considered .",
    "another very useful canonical form of the che is obtained by choosing the coefficient functions in to be @xmath35 and , additionally , defining the two parameters @xmath36 and @xmath37 by    @xmath38    this form will be called the maple - form of the che in the following , since it is implemented in the computer algebra system maple @xcite . the grs for the differential equation in the form",
    "then changes to @xmath39 and yields the relations between the parameter sets @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "at a first glimpse , this looks like an unnecessary modification but it will prove very useful in the following .",

    "the major advantage is now that once the standard function @xmath5 is implemented together with the recurrence relation , the second frobenius solution at @xmath21 and even those two at the other regular singularity @xmath23 can be expressed using this single function @xcite .",
    "the second frobenius solution at @xmath21 can be represented as @xmath55 and the two frobenius solutions at @xmath23 are now given by    @xmath56    we will need these representations to construct solutions to the radial part of wave equations on schwarzschild background spacetime in sections [ sec : radialeqn1 ] and [ sec : radialeqn2 ] .",

    "follow , again , from recursion relations that can be derived by inserting @xmath60 into the differential equation .",
    "for the entire article we choose natural units such that the speed of light , newton s gravitational constant , planck s constant and boltzmann s constant are set to unity , i.e. , @xmath61 .",

    "<S> the propagation of ( massless ) scalar , electromagnetic and gravitational waves on fixed schwarzschild background spacetime is described by the general time - dependent regge - wheeler equation . </S>",
    "<S> we transform this wave equation to usual schwarzschild , eddington - finkelstein , painlev - gullstrand and kruskal - szekeres coordinates . in the first three cases , but not in the last one </S>",
    "<S> , it is possible to separate a harmonic time - dependence . </S>",
    "<S> then the resulting radial equations belong to the class of confluent heun equations , i.e. , we can identify one irregular and two regular singularities . using the generalized riemann scheme </S>",
    "<S> we collect properties of all the singular points and construct analytic ( local ) solutions in terms of the standard confluent heun function heunc , frobenius and asymptotic thom series . </S>",
    "<S> we study the eddington - finkelstein case in detail and obtain a solution that is regular at the black hole horizon . </S>",
    "<S> this solution satisfies causal boundary conditions , i.e. , it describes purely ingoing radiation at @xmath0 . to construct solutions on the entire open interval @xmath10,\\infty [ \\,$ ] , we give an analytic continuation of local solutions around the horizon . </S>",
    "<S> black hole scattering and quasi - normal modes are briefly considered as possible applications and we use semi - analytically calculated graybody factors together with the damour - ruffini method to reconstruct the power spectrum of hawking radiation emitted by the black hole . </S>"
