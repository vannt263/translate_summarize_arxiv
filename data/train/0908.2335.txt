    "recent successful preparation of a single layer of graphene has generated a lot of interest in this system as experimental and theoretical studies have shown that the nature of quasiparticles in this two - dimensional system is very different from those of conventional two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) systems realized in semiconductor heterostructures .",

    "the quasiparticles in graphene have a band structure in which electron and hole bands touch at two points in the brillouin zone . at",
    "these dirac points the quasiparticles obey the massless dirac equation .",
    "in other words , they behave as massless , chiral dirac fermions leading to a linear dispersion relation @xmath1 ( with the characteristic velocity @xmath2 .",
    "this difference in the nature of the quasiparticles in graphene from a conventional 2deg has given rise to a host of new and unusual phenomena such as the anomalous quantum hall effect@xcite with profound effects on transport in these systems .",
    "the transport properties of graphene are currently being explored in the presence of nonuniform potentials , such as in @xmath3 junctions@xcite , as well as in periodic potentials .",
    "effects of periodic potential on electron transport in 2d electron systems has been the subject of continued interest , where electrical modulation of the 2d system can be carried out by depositing an array of parallel metallic strips on the surface or through two interfering laser beams@xcite .",
    "more recently in graphene , electrostatic@xcite and magnetic@xcite periodic potentials have been shown to modulate its electronic structure in unique ways leading to fascinating physics and possible applications .",
    "periodic potentials are induced in graphene by interaction with a substrate@xcite or controlled adatom deposition@xcite .",
    "in addition , it was shown that periodic ripples in suspended graphene also induces a periodic potential in a perpendicular electric field@xcite .",
    "epitaxial growth of graphene on top of a prepatterned substrate is also a possible route to modulation of the potential seen by the electrons . in this work ,",
    "we complement these recent studies to discuss the effects of a weak electric modulation on the electrical conductivity in a graphene monolayer subjected to an external magnetic field perpendicular to the graphene plane .",
    "electric modulation introduces a new length scale , period of modulation , in the system giving rise to interesting physical effects on the transport response .",
    "commensurabiliy ( weiss ) oscillations , in addition to shubnikov de hass ( sdh ) oscillations , are found to occur as a result of commensurability of the electron cyclotron diameter at the fermi energy and the period of the electric modulation . in @xcite , on the same subject , diffusive contribution to magnetoconductivity was considered whereas in the present work we determine collisional and hall contibutions as well .",

    "<S> we have performed  a detailed investigation of the electrical properties of a graphene monolayer which is modulated by a weak one dimensional periodic potential in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the periodic modulation broadens the landau levels into bands which oscillate with @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the electronic conduction in this system can take place through either diffusive scattering or collisional scattering off impurities . </S>",
    "<S> both these contributions to electronic transport are taken into account in this work . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the appearance of commensurability oscillations in both the collisional and diffusive contributions , we find that hall resistance also exhibits commensurability oscillations . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the period and amplitude of these commensurability oscillations in the transport parameters and how they are affected by temperature are also discussed in this work . </S>"
