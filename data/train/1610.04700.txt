    "the goal of this paper is to study the dynamics of piecewise translation maps .",
    "these maps are special types of piecewise isometries on a region @xmath0 in the euclidean space .",
    "to define piecewise isometries , we partition @xmath0 into smaller regions @xmath1 such that these pieces intersect only at their boundaries .",
    "we also assume that the boundary of each piece has zero lebesgue measure .",
    "a map @xmath2 is called a _ piecewise isometry _ if the restriction of @xmath3 to any piece @xmath4 is an isometry , i.e. it preserves distance on each piece .",
    "piecewise isometries , especially piecewise translation maps , serve as models for many engineering applications , such as the second order digital filter @xcite , the sigma - delta modulator @xcite , the buck converter @xcite , the three - capacitance model @xcite , error diffusion in digital printing @xcite , and machine learning .",
    "+ one of the simplest examples of such piecewise translation can be formed using _ interval exchange transformations _ ( iet ) .",
    "these transformations are a generalization of a classical dynamical system  circle rotation . to define an iet ,",
    "let @xmath5 be partitioned into a finite number of distinct intervals .",
    "the map @xmath6 that permutes the intervals defines a piecewise isometry .    ]",
    "several nice properties of iet have been discovered . in particular",
    ", m. kean @xcite showed that every orbit of @xmath3 is dense in @xmath7 .",
    "he also proved that if the partition has only two or three intervals , then all minimal iets are also uniquely ergodic .",
    "the statement is not necessarily true if the number of intervals exceeds 3 .",
    "however , it was proven by masur @xcite and veech @xcite that almost every interval exchange transformation is uniquely ergodic .",
    "this motivates a generalized conjecture that most piecewise isometries ( restriction to the attractors ) are also uniquely ergodic .",
    "we can also consider a variation of interval exchange transformations , namely _ interval translation mappings _",
    "these mappings are introduced by m. boshernitzan and i. kornfeld in 1995 @xcite . for itm",
    ", the images of the intervals are not required to be disjoint .",
    "we classify itm into two types : finite and infinite . in the case",

    "we see that the map can only be of infinite type if there are more than two elements in the partition .",

    "figure [ fig : disk_example ] represents a piecewise translation of 3 branches on a 2-dimensional disk .",
    "these three branches intersect only at their boundaries , which have zero lebesgue measure .",
    "figure [ fig : disk_example ] is a simplified model of machine learning . in order for the machine to learn ,",
    "we need multiple inputs from the environment .",
    "each input is represented by a translation vector .",
    "the process of machine learning is modeled by the dynamics of applying the piecewise translation map many times .",
