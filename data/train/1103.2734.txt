    "this work pertains to the probabilistic study of euclidean combinatorial optimization problems .",
    "the starting point in this field is the celebrated theorem of beardwood , halton and hammersley @xcite about the traveling salesperson problem .",
    "its ensures that given a sequence @xmath3 of independent random variables on @xmath1 , @xmath4 with common law @xmath5 of bounded support , then almost surely @xmath6 here @xmath7 is a constant depending only on the dimension , @xmath8 is the density of the absolutely continuous part of @xmath5 and @xmath9 is the length ( for the canonical euclidean distance ) of the shorstest tour through the points @xmath10 . in the above formula @xmath11 stands for the set of permutations of @xmath12 .",
    "very informally , this result supports the following interpretation : when the number of points @xmath13 is large , for @xmath5 almost every @xmath14 , if the salesperson is at @xmath15 then the distance to the next point in the optimal tour is comparable to @xmath16 if @xmath17 and of lower order otherwise .",
    "this should be compared to the fact that the distance from @xmath15 to @xmath18 also stabilizes at the same rate .",
    "later , papadimitriou @xcite and steele @xcite have initiated a general theory of euclidean functionals @xmath19 that satisfy almost sure limits of this type .",
    "we refer the reader to the monographs of steele @xcite and yukich @xcite for a full treatment of this now mature theory , and present a short outline .",
    "it is convenient to consider multisets rather than sets , so throughout the paper @xmath20 will stand for a multiset ( the elements are unordered but may be repeated ) .",
    "the umbrella theorem in @xcite puts forward the following three features of a functional @xmath21 on finite multisets of @xmath1 :    * @xmath21 is @xmath22-homogeneous if it is translation invariant and dilation covariant : @xmath23 for all finite multisets @xmath24 , all @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "* the key assumption is subadditivity : @xmath21 is subadditive",
    "if there exists a constant @xmath27 such that for all multisets @xmath28 in the unit cube @xmath29^d$ ] , @xmath30 as noted by rhee in @xcite , this assumption implies that there is another constant @xmath31 such that for all multiset in @xmath29^d$ ] , @xmath32 hence the worst case for @xmath13 points is at most in @xmath33 and the above mentioned theorems show that the average case is of the same order . *",
    "the third important property is smoothness ( or regularity ) .",
    "a functional @xmath21 on finite multisets @xmath1 is smooth if there is a constant @xmath34 such that for all multisets @xmath35 in @xmath29^d$ ] , it holds @xmath36    these three properties are enough to show upper limits for @xmath21 , on the model of the beardwood , halton , hammersley theorem . to have the full limits , the umbrella theorem of @xcite also requires to check a few more properties of a so - called boundary functional associated with @xmath21 .",
    "next , let us present a classical optimization problem which does not enter the above picture .",
    "given two multi - subsets of @xmath1 with the same cardinality , @xmath37 and @xmath38 , the cost of the minimal bipartite matching of @xmath39 and @xmath40 is defined as @xmath41 where the minimum runs over all permutations of @xmath42 .",
    "it is well - known that @xmath43 coincides with the power of the @xmath44-wasserstein distance between the empirical distributions @xmath45 hence it is easily seen to tend to @xmath46 , for example when @xmath5 has bounded support .",
    "recall that given two finite measures @xmath47 , @xmath47 on @xmath48 with the same total mass , @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the set of measures on @xmath51 having @xmath47 as first marginal and @xmath52 as second marginal ( see e.g. @xcite for more background ) . note that for all finite multisets @xmath24 , @xmath53 in @xmath29^d$ ] with @xmath54 , @xmath55 and equality holds for some well - chosen configurations of any cardinal ( all elements in @xmath24 at @xmath56 and all elements in @xmath53 at @xmath57 ) .",
    "hence , an interesting feature of @xmath58 ( as well as others bipartite euclidean optimization functionals ) is that the growth bound assumption fails , hence it is not subadditive in the above sense .",
    "however dobri and yukich have stated the following theorem :    [ th : main ] let @xmath59 be an integer .",
    "assume that @xmath5 is a probability measure on @xmath48 having a bounded support .",
    "consider mutually independent random variables @xmath3 and @xmath60 having distribution @xmath5 .",
    "then , almost surely , @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the absolutely continuous part of @xmath5 and @xmath63 is a constant depending only on the dimension @xmath64 .",
    "when @xmath8 is not the uniform measure on the unit cube , there is an issue in the proof of @xcite that apparently can not be easily fixed ( the problem lies in their lemma 4.2 which is used for proving that the @xmath65 is at least @xmath66 ) . in any case , the proof of dobri and yukich is very specific to the bipartite matching as it uses from the start the kantorovich - rubinstein dual representation of the optimal transportation cost .",
    "it is not adapted to a general treatment of bipartite functionals .",
    "the starting point of our work was recent paper of boutet de monvel and martin @xcite which ( independently of @xcite ) establishes the convergence of the bipartite matching for uniform variables on the unit cube , without using the dual formulation of the transportation cost .",
    "building on their approach we are able to propose a soft approach of bipartite functionals , based on appropriate notions of subadditivity and regularity .",
    "these properties allow to establish upper estimates on upper limits . in order to deal with lower limits we adapt to the bipartite setting the ideas of boundary functionals exposed in @xcite .",
    "we are able to explicitly construct such functionals for a class of optimization problems involving families of graphs with good properties , and to establish full convergence for absolutely continuous laws .",
    "finally we introduce a new notion of inverse subadditivity which allows to deal with singular parts .",
    "this viewpoint sheds a new light on the result of dobri and yukich , that we extend in other respects , by considering power distance costs , and unbounded random variables satisfying certain tail assumptions .",
    "note that in the classical theory of euclidean functionals , the analogous question for unbounded random variables was answered in rhee @xcite and generalized in @xcite .",
    "let us illustrate our results in the case of the bipartite matching with power distance cost : given @xmath67 and two multi - subsets of @xmath1 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 , define @xmath68 where the minimum runs over all permutations of @xmath42 .",
    "note that we have the same result for the bipartite travelling salesperson problem , and that our generic approach puts forward key properties that allow to establish similar facts for other functionals . as mentioned in the title ,",
    "our results apply to relatively high dimension . more precisely ,",
    "if the length of edges are counted to a power @xmath69 , our study applies to dimensions @xmath70 only .",

    "then there are positive constants @xmath74 depending only on @xmath75 such that the following convergence holds almost surely @xmath76 moreover @xmath77 provided one of the following hypothesis is verified :    * @xmath5 is the uniform distribution over a bounded set @xmath78 with positive lebesgue measure . *",

    "we strongly suspect that @xmath83 but we have not been able to solve this important issue .",
    "also , assuming only @xmath84 , we can establish convergence in probability .",
    "a basic concentration inequality implies that if @xmath5 has bounded support the convergence holds also in @xmath85 for all @xmath86 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section  [ sec : general ] presents the key properties for bipartite functionals ( homogeneity , subadditivity and regularity ) and gathers useful preliminary statements .",
    "section  [ sec : cube ] establishes the convergence for uniform samples on the cube .",
    "section [ sec : upper ] proves upper bounds on the upper limits .",
    "these two sections essentially rely on classical subadditive methods , nevertheless a careful analysis is needed to control the differences of cardinalities of the two samples in small domains . in section [ sec :",
    "ex ] , we introduce some examples of bipartite functionals .",
    "the lower limits are harder to prove and require a new notion of penalized boundary functionals .",
    "it is however difficult to build an abstract theory there , so in section  [ sec : lower ] , we will first present the proof for bipartite matchings with power distance cost , and put forward a few lemmas which will be useful for other functionals .",
    "we then check that for a natural family of euclidean combinatorial optimization functionals defined in ",

    "it is clear from the proofs that some of our results hold assuming only geometric subadditivity ( upper limit for bounded absolutely continuous laws for example ) .",
