    "cosmic strings @xcite were introduced into cosmology by kibble @xcite , zeldovich @xcite and vilenkin @xcite as ( linear ) topological defects which may have been formed during phase transitions in the early universe .",
    "cosmic strings are considered as possible sources for density perturbations and hence for structure formation in the universe .",
    "the simplest geometry of a cosmic string is that of a straight infinite one , which may represent anyhow a generic cosmic string from close up .",
    "the straight infinite ( and static ) string is therefore a source of a static and cylindrically symmetric gravitational field .",
    "it is well - known @xcite that the general static cylindrically - symmetric vacuum solution of einstein equations is characterized by two free parameters .",
    "a simple representation of this is the so - called kasner solution :    @xmath0    where @xmath1 sets the length scale , @xmath2 will be discussed below and @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 satisfy the kasner conditions : @xmath6    a question of fundamental interest is the interpretation of these parameters and the connection between them and the internal properties of the matter distribution , i.e. of the cosmic string in the present context .",
    "( 1,0)210    @xmath7electronic address : verbin@oumail.openu.ac.il    the simplest model for a cosmic string is the so called `` gauge string '' @xcite which is an idealized cylindrical mass distribution with a finite radial extension having @xmath8 as the only non - vanishing components of the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "it is well - known by now that this string picks up from the kasner family a very simple solution namely @xmath9 which is evidently locally flat .",
    "however , there is a global non - trivial effect i.e. the geometry is that of a cone .",
    "the parameter @xmath2 represents a conic angular deficit @xcite which is also related to the mass distribution of the source .    the explicit relation between the angular deficit @xmath10 and the `` inertial mass '' ( per unit length ) @xmath11 , of a gauge string was found to be @xmath12 first @xcite in the linearized approximation assuming also an infinitesimally thin source , and then @xcite by solving the full non - linear einstein equations around a uniform source ( constant @xmath13 ) with a finite radius .",
    "the same relation was also derived @xcite for a non - uniform source . since the space - time around a gauge string is locally flat , this angular deficit is the only geometrical evidence of its existence .",
    "further study of the subject @xcite involved a more realistic model ( i.e. the abelian higgs model ) for the cosmic strings and the analysis of the full coupled field equations for the gravitational field and matter ( scalar + vector ) fields .",
    "it became clear that ( [ angdef ] ) is only an approximation and several corrections were calculated @xcite .",
    "the cosmic strings of the abelian higgs model are the simplest and most studied ones .",
    "if however , gravity is a scalar - tensor theory as suggested by string theory , one should examine the existence of cosmic strings in this case as well .",
    "this has been done already for brans - dicke theory and its extensions @xcite and for dilatonic gravity @xcite where an extra scalar field ( dilaton ) couples to the higgs system and to the metric tensor .",
    "cosmic string solutions were found and their characteristics were discussed .",
    "there exists yet another simple system which may give rise to cosmic strings where gravity is purely tensorial but couples non - minimally to the matter fields .",
    "it is the abelian higgs model where the charged scalar field has a ( non - minimal ) `` conformal '' coupling to gravity .",
    "it seems that cosmic strings of this model have never been discussed in the literature , although it is not much more complicated than the minimally coupled abelian higgs model .",
    "this paper contains therefore a verifications ( by construction ) of the existence of such solutions and a study of their characteristics . in order to have a basis for appreciating the new results ,",
    "the next section ( 2 ) concentrates in cosmic strings in the minimally coupled case .",
    "the most important features are presented - most of them well - known but some interesting novelties are added .",
    "section 3 contains the general analysis of the conformally coupled case and section 4 contains numerical results which establish the existence of the new kind of cosmic strings and a discussion of their main features .",
    "generally , they are found to be similar to the minimally coupled ones .",
    "the action which allows self - gravitating abelian flux tubes is    @xmath14    where @xmath15 is the ricci scalar , @xmath16 the abelian field strength , @xmath17 is a complex scalar field and @xmath18 is the usual gauge covariant derivative .",
    "we use units in which @xmath19 .    because of the cylindrical symmetry of the source we will use a line element of the form : @xmath20 and the usual nielsen - olesen ansatz for the + 1 flux unit : @xmath21 this gives rise to the following field equations for the abelian higgs flux tube : @xmath22 with the line element ( [ lineelement ] ) the components of the ricci tensor are : @xmath23    the source",
    "is described by the energy - momentum tensor with the following components : @xmath24 where @xmath25 for further use we define the magnetic field as : @xmath26    it turns out to be convenient to use einstein equations in the form : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the contracted energy - momentum tensor : @xmath29    by insertion of @xmath30 one obtains : @xmath31 @xmath32 @xmath33 and instead of the `` radial '' part of ( [ einsteinr ] ) we take the following combination : @xmath34 which is not an independent equation but serves as a constraint . in vacuum the right - hand - sides of these equations vanish and the first three of them are trivially integrated . in this way we may get back kasner s line element ( [ kasner1 ] ) .",
    "this is therefore the asymptotic form of the metric tensor around any ( transversally ) localized source and especially around an abelian higgs flux tube .",
    "moreover , it is easy to get convinced that due to the symmetry under boosts along the string axis , @xmath35 .",
    "the equations become more transparent if we express all lengths in terms of the scalar characteristic length scale ( @xmath36 , the `` correlation length '' in the superconductivity terminology ) .",
    "we therefore change to the dimensionless length coordinate @xmath37 and metric component @xmath38 which we still denote by @xmath39 .",
    "we also introduce the two parameters @xmath40 and @xmath41 . in terms of these new quantities",
    "we get a two parameter system of 4 coupled non - linear ordinary differential equations ( now of course @xmath42 ) :    @xmath43    @xmath44    we have also to keep in mind the existence of the constraint ( [ constraint ] ) which gets the following form : @xmath45    in order to get string solutions the scalar and gauge field should satisfy the following boundary conditions : @xmath46 and regularity of the geometry on the symmetry axis will be guarantied by the `` initial conditions '' : @xmath47    it is well - known that even in flat space these field equations can only be solved numerically .",
    "however , much can be said about the nature of the solutions even without explicitly solving the field equations @xcite .",
    "the first is that the abelian higgs string has a vanishing gravitational mass which means that the spacetime around the string is locally flat except in its core .",
    "however , there is a non - trivial global effect namely a conical structure of the space which is quantified by an angular deficit .",
    "this does not saturate all the possibilities .",
    "there are further types of solutions of ( [ systemno1])-([systeme2 ] ) with the same boundary ( and `` initial '' ) conditions which are not asymptotically flat but have interesting physical interpretation .",
    "thus , a point in the @xmath48-@xmath49 plane does not always represent a single solution .",
    "the various solutions are distinguished by their asymptotic geometries . here",
    "we will concentrate in the cosmic string solutions , i.e. those which are asymptotically conical .    for analyzing the solutions and obtaining the above - mentioned features and some additional ones , we introduce the tolman mass ( per unit length ) of this system , @xmath50 : @xmath51 where the last equality comes from the `` temporal '' einstein equation .",
    "the string angular deficit will be related to the `` angular '' einstein equation by defining : @xmath52 it is assumed of course that the integrals converge and the limits exist .",
    "this will be verified numerically later .",
    "the asymptotic form of the metric tensor is easily found by direct integration of the two einstein equations ( [ systeme1])-([systeme2 ] ) using the boundary conditions and the definitions of @xmath50 and @xmath53 .",
    "it is of the kasner form @xmath54 with : @xmath55 the constant @xmath56 appears free in the asymptotic solution , but it is uniquely fixed in the complete one by the boundary conditions on the metric .",
    "now we notice that the `` radial '' einstein equation , ( [ constraintmod ] ) can be used at @xmath57 to give in this case the following relation which is equivalent to the quadratic kasner condition in ( [ kasner2 ] ) : @xmath58 this immediately indicates the existence of two branches of solutions .",
    "@xmath59 corresponds to the cosmic string branch since @xmath9 .",
    "the other turns out to have non - flat asymptotic behavior ( @xmath60 ) , much like that of the melvin solution and we may call it the `` melvin branch ''",
    ". we will not focus on this branch since it is clear by its asymptotics that it can not represent cosmic strings",
    ". we will however refer to it on passing in order to complete the picture .",
    "in the cosmic string branch one can easily identify the angular deficit @xmath61 by : @xmath62    it is obvious that @xmath53 contains contribution not only from the inertial mass ( integral over @xmath63 ) , but also from the pressure terms so eq . ( [ angdef ] ) , @xmath64 , is valid only in circumstances when the transverse pressures are negligible .",
    "otherwise , one should replace @xmath11 by @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the appropriate integral over @xmath67 ( with @xmath68 absorbed in the measure ) .",
    "in short : @xmath69 recall also that @xmath59 . moreover , it is inconsistent to take @xmath70 since we have already made the choice @xmath71 in order to be able to treat on the same footing the solutions in both branches .",
    "this factor represents a red / blue - shift of time between infinity and the core of the string and adds its own contribution to the angular deficit .",
    "we have therefore a generalized vilenkin relation : @xmath72    actually this result does not depend upon the detailed properties of the model and is valid for any static matter distribution with cylindrical symmetry and boost symmetry along the string axis , provided it is localized enough so the relevant integrals converge . in the case of the minimally coupled abelian higgs model one may get a more explicit expression by use of eqs .",
    "( [ tmunu])-([densities ] ) .    the angular deficit may be written in an alternative form if we start from the following identity : @xmath73 which is obtained for @xmath74 from ( [ einstphi ] ) and ( [ constraint ] ) . if we now multiply both sides by @xmath75 and integrate we find after some manipulations ( integrations by parts etc . ) and use of @xmath59 that : @xmath76 note that the measure here is a purely two - dimensional one which is related to the induced metric of the constant time and constant @xmath77 surface .",
    "a `` predecessor '' of this relation was derived already by garfinkle and laguna @xcite although in a form where only the @xmath63 term of ( [ angledef3 ] ) was explicit and the second term was expressed in terms of the metric components .",
    "this result is also model - independent in the same sense as explained above .",
    "for the abelian higgs model we obtain the following explicit expression : @xmath78    an additional relation unnoticed so far is a simple connection between the angular deficit of an abelian higgs string and the central value of the magnetic field @xmath79 .",
    "one may prefer to use the dimensionless magnetic field @xmath80 . at any rate",
    "the relation is : @xmath81 this result is obtained from the following identity which amounts to an integration of one combination ( i.e. the difference ) of the two equations ( [ systeme1])-([systeme2 ] ) : @xmath82=0 . \\label{firstordercomb}\\ ] ] if we use this identity for the string branch at both @xmath83 and @xmath57 we get the following which directly leads from ( [ angdeflw ] ) to ( [ angdefb ] ) : @xmath84 this relation is easily generalized for the melvin branch : @xmath85 since now @xmath86 we may use the relation ( [ mw ] ) to solve for the mass and the @xmath53-parameter in terms of the single combination @xmath87 : @xmath88 note that in the case of the -1 flux unit the magnetic field changes sign so @xmath89 should actually be replaced in the above equations by @xmath90 in order to cover both cases .    as numerical analysis shows ( sec .",
    "4 ) , the angular deficit increases with @xmath49 and decreases with @xmath48 . an analytic demonstration for the @xmath49 dependence",
    "is obtained in the simplest solution for this system , namely the bogomolnyi solution @xcite which exists for @xmath91 . in this case",
    "the system is in a state where the repulsion due to vector exchange is exactly balanced by the attraction due to the scalar exchange .",
    "this is reflected by an identically vanishing gravitational potential , namely , @xmath92 .",
    "the field equations turn out to be equivalent to the following first order equations : @xmath93 using e.g. ( [ angdeflw ] ) and ( [ wb2 ] ) with @xmath94 ( which follows from ( [ bog2 ] ) ) , we find a simple expression for the angular deficit which was already noticed by linet @xcite : @xmath95 this linear increase is evidently associated with a maximal value of @xmath96 . beyond this value",
    "the solutions are closed , namely , outside the core of the string , @xmath97 decreases linearly and vanishes at a finite distance from the string axis .",
    "the geometry is still conic but of an inverted one where the apex of the cone is at the point where @xmath98 @xcite .    if we now return to arbitrary values of @xmath48 and @xmath49 and look back at ( [ angdefb ] ) we find a critical value for the central magnetic field of an abelian higgs cosmic string : @xmath99 note that for a given @xmath100 , say the electromagnetic value , the value of the critical magnetic field , @xmath101 is unique .",
    "however , the dimensionless critical magnetic field is given in terms of both @xmath48 and @xmath49 so there is a whole curve in the @xmath48-@xmath49 plane which corresponds to solutions with the same critical asymptotic behavior .",
    "the possibility of non - minimal coupling ( @xmath102 ) between gravity and scalar fields was investigated by many authors and the special coefficient of 1/12 was found to be of special interest due to the conformal symmetry associated with such a coupling @xcite .",
    "it is however quite surprising that the possibility of cosmic strings in this system has never been discussed in the literature .",
    "the action contains thus an additional term for the non - minimal `` conformal coupling '' :    @xmath103    the modification in the abelian higgs sector is only a `` renormalization '' of the self interaction coupling constant @xmath104 to @xmath105 which results from the identity @xmath106 on the other hand there are considerable modifications in the einstein equations due to the new energy - momentum tensor : @xmath107 or by using einstein equation : @xmath108 .",
    "\\label{conftmn2}\\ ] ] @xmath109 is of course the energy - momentum tensor of the minimally coupled system of the previous section .",
    "the same cosmic string ansatz gives now the following form of einstein equations : @xmath110 @xmath111 @xmath112 where we use the field equation for the scalar and define the combination : @xmath113 the radial constraint is now : @xmath114    a glance at the einstein equations for this case reveals that their structure is quite similar to that for minimal coupling .",
    "the main difference is the appearance of a `` field dependent gravitational constant '' , @xmath115 because of which we may expect more pronounced gravitational effects , since it is larger than @xmath116 .",
    "moreover , there seems to be a critical value of the scalar vacuum expectation value @xmath117 since @xmath118 is singular as seen for example from the `` renormalization '' of @xmath104 and from other results that will follow .",
    "we will thus concentrate in the region @xmath119 .    by subtracting ( [ einst3c ] ) from ( [ einst0c ] )",
    "one can show that the boost symmetry along the string axis is still valid hence @xmath35 .",
    "we also note that the last term in the right - hand side in each of ( [ einst0c])-([einst3c ] ) may be transferred to the left - hand - side to form a total derivative so we write :    @xmath120    @xmath121    it is also useful to write the equations explicitly in terms of the dimensionless variables : @xmath122 @xmath123    a first order equation analogous to ( [ firstordercomb ] ) is obtained from the difference ( [ einst0cidim])-([einstphicidim ] ) : @xmath124 = 0 . \\label{firstordercombcc}\\ ] ] the constraint ( [ constraintcc ] ) gets the form @xmath125    integration of ( [ einst0cidim ] ) and ( [ einstphicidim ] ) gives the following integral expressions for @xmath50 and @xmath53 : @xmath126 @xmath127 the asymptotic form of the metric tensor is still described by ( [ asymptkasner1])-([mw ] ) and the angular deficit is still given by ( [ angdeflw ] ) or ( [ angdefvil2 ] ) provided we use the appropriate energy - momentum tensor . since ( [ angledef3 ] ) is also still valid , an expression analogous to ( [ angledef3ah ] ) may be immediately found : @xmath128    a relation between the angular deficit and the magnetic field exists here as well .",
    "we can use eq .",
    "( [ firstordercombcc ] ) to obtain : @xmath129 from here we find that for the cosmic string branch @xmath130 and @xmath131 while for the melvin branch we get @xmath50 and @xmath53 in terms of the central magnetic field : @xmath132 note that although the relation between the central magnetic field and the angular deficit is modified , the critical magnetic field is still given by the minimal coupling expression , ( [ critb ] ) .",
    "we thus expect to find in the case of conformal coupling , cosmic string solutions that do not differ significantly from the minimally coupled ones",
    ". this will indeed be the main conclusion but there is one important exception : the bogomolnyi cosmic strings . as mentioned above",
    ", this is the case where there is a complete balance between the repulsive and attractive contributions ( to @xmath133 ) which is reflected by the fact that @xmath92 is a consistent solution .",
    "the straightforward way to study the analogous situation for conformal coupling is to examine whether the system still admits @xmath92 as a solution .",
    "it turns out that this is not the case , and @xmath92 is inconsistent with the field equations .",
    "one may arrive at this conclusion by a direct computation of the derivatives of @xmath134 at @xmath135 up to order @xmath136 ( exploiting all the field equations ) for any @xmath48 and @xmath49 and studying the possibility that they all vanish simultaneously .",
    "it is found that @xmath136 can not be greater than @xmath137 , namely , there can not exist a solution where all the first @xmath138 derivatives of @xmath134 at @xmath135 vanish .",
    "this evidently excludes the possibility of a constant @xmath134 .",
    "since high order derivatives are involved , the algebraic manipulations are rather cumbersome and they will not be shown here explicitly .    further study of the nature of the solutions is possible only by numerical analysis .",
    "the results are described in the next section .",
    "in this section the essential characteristics of the cosmic strings with conformal coupling to gravity are presented , mainly in a graphical manner . for comparison ,",
    "the corresponding characteristics for minimal coupling are also shown .",
    "the results were obtained by the mathematica package using an iterative procedure for solving the four coupled field equations . in order to insure the consistency of the results several checks",
    "were made using the constraints and relations like ( [ constraintccdim ] ) and ( [ wbcc ] ) and their minimal coupling analogues .",
    "the scalar and gauge field look generally as in flat space . the gauge field , or",
    "@xmath139 is sensitive to @xmath48 but does not depend very much on @xmath49 .",
    "it slightly concentrates toward the axis when @xmath49 is increased .",
    "fig.[figp ] depicts @xmath139 for @xmath140 . for each value of @xmath48 , @xmath49 takes values in steps of @xmath141 starting from @xmath142 ( flat space flux tube ) up to a maximal value which depends on @xmath48 : @xmath143 for the above values respectively .",
    "altogether there are 33 points in the @xmath48-@xmath49 plane represented in the figure .",
    "the fact that the vector field concentrates while @xmath48 increases , results from the fact that @xmath48 represents the ratio between the scalar and the vector characteristic length scales .",
    "one should however keep in mind that the behavior with respect to `` real '' distance , @xmath144 may be different since changes in @xmath48 and @xmath49 are associated with changes in @xmath104 and @xmath117 and an increase of those tends to expand @xmath145 .",
    "the scalar field is quite insensitive to changes in both @xmath48 and @xmath49 as can be learnt from fig.[figf ] : an increase of @xmath48 and decrease of @xmath49 have a similar weak effect of increasing the rate of approach of @xmath146 towards @xmath147 .",
    "equivalently , the slope of the scalar field on the axis increases with @xmath48 and decreases with @xmath49 .",
    "the @xmath146 curves correspond to the same 33 points in the @xmath48-@xmath49 plane mentioned above .",
    "fig.[figb ] presents the behavior of the magnetic field . for the sake of clarity only the extreme values of @xmath48 and @xmath49",
    "the general tendency is that the magnetic field increases with both @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "however , this tendency reverses for large @xmath148 since @xmath149 ( as well as the other fields ) approaches faster its vacuum value for larger values of @xmath48 .",
    "there is also a slight decrease of the magnetic field on the axis in the minimally coupled string for @xmath150 .",
    "the metric components are more sensitive to changes in @xmath48 and @xmath49 and there is a boundary in the @xmath48-@xmath49 plane beyond which no open solutions exist at all .",
    "a complete mapping of the @xmath48-@xmath49 plane is a matter for further analysis .",
    "a general idea as of the shape of this boundary ( i.e. along which @xmath151 ) may be obtained however from fig .",
    "[ figdeltaphi ] .",
    "the conformal coupling indirectly intensifies the gravitational effects with respect to the case of minimal coupling .",
    "the temporal metric component @xmath134 changes its behavior significantly ; especially for @xmath152 where @xmath134 is a decreasing function for all @xmath49 in the minimally coupled case but not so for conformal coupling . for @xmath153 , where the general form of @xmath134 is similar for both cases , the red / blue - shift factor",
    "@xmath68 is much larger for conformal coupling than for minimal coupling .",
    "these features are evident from fig.[fign0]-fig.[fign4 ] which present @xmath134 for several representative points in the @xmath48-@xmath49 plane .",
    "the most prominent feature of the cosmic string solutions is the angular deficit @xmath61 which is in one - to - one correspondence with the asymptotic value of the slope of the angular metric component @xmath97 .",
    "fig.[figl0]-fig.[figl4 ] show this function and short inspection shows that @xmath61 decreases with @xmath48 and increases with @xmath49 in both types of coupling .",
    "the angular deficit is always larger in the conformally coupled case .",
    "the @xmath48 and @xmath49 dependence of these two characteristics @xmath68 and @xmath61 is more clearly seen in fig.[figni ] and fig.[figdeltaphi ] which show a portion of the @xmath48-@xmath49 plane .",
    "note the very different behavior of the red / blue - shift factor @xmath68 in both cases . for minimal coupling",
    "the line @xmath154 is the bogomolnyi line which separates between @xmath155 and @xmath156 . a similar @xmath157 line exists for the conformal coupling ; however as the non - existence of bogomolnyi strings implies , it does not correspond to solutions with @xmath92 as happens for minimal coupling , but merely to the case of no red / blue - shift between infinity and the core of the string .",
    "the abelian higgs cosmic strings with conformal coupling seem therefore to be as respectable as their minimally coupled counterparts .",
    "both types share the same general tendencies and typical characteristics and most of the investigation may be done for both cases along parallel paths .",
    "the only significant difference is the non - existence of the bogomolnyi cosmic strings in the case of conformal coupling .",
