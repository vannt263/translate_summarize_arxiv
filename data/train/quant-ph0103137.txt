    "entanglement of composite quantum systems is central to both the peculiarities and promises of quantum information .",
    "consequently , the study of entanglement of bi- and multipartite systems has been the focus of research in quantum information theory .",
    "while pure state entanglement is fairly well understood , there are still many open questions related to the general case of mixed states . the furthest progress has been made in the study of systems of two qubits : it has been shown that a state of two qubits is separable if and only if its partial transpose is positive ( ppt - property ) @xcite and a closed expression for the entanglement of formation was derived @xcite",
    ". moreover , it was shown @xcite that all entangled states of two qubits can be _ distilled _ into maximally entangled pure states by local operations .",
    "this property of distillability is of great practical importance , since only the distillable states are useful for certain applications such as long - distance quantum communication , quantum teleportation or cryptography @xcite .    in higher dimensions",
    "much less is known : the ppt - property is no longer sufficient for separability as proved by the existence of ppt entangled states in @xmath0 systems @xcite .",
    "these states were later shown to be _ bound entangled _",
    "@xcite : even if two parties ( alice and bob ) share an arbitrarily large supply of such states , they can not transform ( `` distill '' ) it into even a single pure entangled state by local quantum operations and classical communication",
    ". meanwhile , a number of additional necessary or sufficient conditions for inseparability have been found for finite dimensional bipartite systems , which use properties of the range and kernel of the density matrix @xmath1 and its partial transpose @xmath2 to establish separability ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "when going from two to more parties , current knowledge is even more limited .",
    "pure multipartite entanglement was first considered in @xcite .",
    "a classification of @xmath3-partite mixed states according to their separability properties has been given @xcite .",
    "but even for three qubits there is currently no general way to decide to which of these classes a given state belongs @xcite .",
    "results on bound entanglement @xcite and entanglement distillation @xcite for multi - party systems have been obtained .",
    "recently increasing attention was paid to infinite dimensional systems , the so - called continuous quantum variables ( cv ) , in particular since the experimental realization of cv quantum teleportation @xcite .",
    "quantum information with cv in general is mainly concerned with the family of _ gaussian states _ , since these comprise essentially all the experimentally realizable cv states .",
    "a practical advantage of cv systems is the relative ease with which entangled states can be generated in the lab @xcite .",
    "first results on separability and distillability of gaussian states were reported in @xcite .",
    "one finds striking similarities between the situations of two qubits and two one  mode cv systems in a gaussian state : ppt is necessary and sufficient for separability @xcite , and all inseparable states are distillable @xcite .",
    "generalizing the methods reviewed in @xcite it was shown that for more than two modes at either side ppt entangled states exist @xcite . in @xcite a computable measure of entanglement for bipartite gaussian states was derived .",
    "the study of cv multipartite entanglement was initiated in @xcite , where a scheme was suggested to create pure cv @xmath3-party entanglement using squeezed light and @xmath4 beamsplitters .",
    "in fact , this discussion indicates that tripartite entanglement has already been created ( though not investigated or detected ) in the cv quantum teleportation experiment @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we provide a complete classification of tri - mode entanglement ( according to the scheme @xcite ) and obtain  in contrast to the finite dimensional case  a simple , directly computable criterion that allows to determine to which class a given state belongs .",
    "we show that none of these classes are empty and in particular provide examples of genuine tripartite bound entangled states , i.e. states of three modes @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 that are separable whenever two parties are grouped together but can not be written as a mixture of tripartite product states .",
    "before we can derive our results we need to introduce some notation and collect a number of useful facts about our main object of study : gaussian states .",
    "in quantum optics and in other scenarios described by continuous quantum variables , not all states on the infinite dimensional hilbert space are equally accessible in current experiments .",
    "in fact , the set of _ gaussian states _ comprises essentially all genuinely cv states that can currently be prepared in the lab .",
    "this , and the mathematical simplicity of these states are the reasons why cv quantum information has so far considered almost exclusively gaussian states , as will the present paper .",
    "this section summarizes results on gaussian states that we need in the following and introduces some notation .",
    "we consider systems composed of @xmath8 distinguishable infinite dimensional subsystems , each with hilbert space @xmath9 .",
    "these could be implemented quantum optically by different modes of the electromagnetic field , hence each of these subsystems will be referred to as a `` mode '' .",
    "to each mode belong the two canonical observables @xmath10 with commutation relation @xmath11=i$ ] . defining @xmath12 these relation",
    "are summarized as @xmath13=-ij_{kl}$ ] , using the antisymmetric @xmath14 matrix @xmath15 which plays an important role in the following calculations @xcite .    for such systems",
    ", it is convenient to describe the state @xmath1 by its characteristic function @xmath16.\\ ] ] here @xmath17 is a real vector , and @xmath18 the characteristic function contains all the information about the state of the system , that is , one can construct @xmath1 knowing @xmath19 .",
    "gaussian states are exactly those for which @xmath19 is a gaussian function of the phase space coordinates @xmath20 @xcite , @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a real , symmetric , strictly positive matrix , the _ correlation matrix _ ( cm ) , and @xmath23 is a real vector , the _",
    "displacement_. note that both @xmath22 and @xmath24 are directly measurable quantities , their elements @xmath25 and @xmath26 are related to the expectation values and variances of the operators @xmath27 .",
    "a gaussian state is completely determined by @xmath22 and @xmath24 .",
    "note that the displacement of a ( known ) state can always be adjusted to @xmath28 by a sequence of unitaries applied to individual modes .",
    "this implies that @xmath24 is irrelevant for the study of nonlocal properties .",
    "therefore we will occasionally say , e.g. , that `` a cm is separable '' when the gaussian state with this cm is separable . also , from now on in this paper `` state '' will always mean `` gaussian state '' ( unless stated otherwise ) .",
    "not all real , symmetric , positive matrices @xmath22 correspond to the cm of a physical state .",
    "there are a number of equivalent ways to characterize physical cms , which will all be useful in the following .",
    "we collect them in    ( correlation matrices ) + [ physical ] for a real , symmetric @xmath29 matrix @xmath30 the following statements are equivalent :    [ physicalconds ] @xmath31 @xmath32 @xmath33 @xmath34 for @xmath35 symplectic @xcite and @xmath36 diagonal @xcite .",

    "+ a cm corresponds to a pure state if and only if ( iff ) @xmath40 , i.e.iff @xmath41 ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "it is easy to see from ( [ iv ] ) that for pure states ineq .",

    "it is clear from eq .",
    "( [ iv ] ) that for every cm @xmath22 there exists a pure cm @xmath43 such that @xmath44 .",
    "this will allow us to restrict many proofs to pure cms only .",
    "note that for a pure @xmath29 cm @xmath22 it holds that @xmath45 .",
    "a very important transformation for the study of entanglement is partial transposition @xcite .",
    "transposition is an example of a positive but not completely positive map and therefore may reveal entanglement when applied to part of an entangled system . on",
    "phase space transposition corresponds to the transformation that changes the sign of all the @xmath46 coordinates @xmath47 @xcite and leaves the @xmath48 s unchanged . for @xmath22 and @xmath24",
    "this means @xmath49 . using this",
    ", the npt - criterion for inseparability @xcite translates very nicely to gaussian states .",
    "consider a bipartite system consisting of @xmath50 modes on alice s side and @xmath8 modes on bob s ( @xmath51-system in the following ) .",
    "let @xmath22 be the cm of a gaussian @xmath51-state and denote by @xmath52 the partial transposition in a s system only .",
    "then we have the following criterion for inseparability :    ( npt criterion ) + [ nptcrit ] let @xmath22 be the cm of a @xmath53 system , then @xmath22 corresponds to a inseparable state if and only if @xmath54 is not a physical cm , i.e.  if and only if @xmath55 we say that @xmath22 `` is npt '' if ( [ npt ] ) holds .",

    "( [ npt ] ) and write @xmath58 .    for states of at least two modes at both sides condition  ( [ npt ] ) is still sufficient for inseparability , but no longer necessary as shown by werner and wolf , who have considered a family of @xmath59 entangled states with positive partial transpose @xcite . in the same paper",
    ", it was shown that    ( separability of gaussian states ) + [ wernersepth ] a state with cm @xmath22 is separable iff there exist cms @xmath60 such that @xmath61    it is observed in @xcite that if ineq .",

    "that while theorem  [ wernersepth ] gives a necessary and sufficient condition for separability , it is not a practical criterion , since to use it , we have to prove the existence or non - existence of cms @xmath60 . instead , a criterion would allow to directly calculate from @xmath22 whether the corresponding state is separable or not .",
    "theorem  [ wernersepth ] and its extension to the 3-party situation are the starting point for the derivation of such a criterion for the case of three - mode three - party states in the following main section of this paper .",
    "when systems that are composed of @xmath65 parties are considered , there are many `` types '' of entanglement due to the many ways in which the different subsystems may be entangled with each other .",
    "we will use the scheme introduced in @xcite , to classify three - mode tripartite gaussian states .",
    "the important point is that from the extension of theorem  [ wernersepth ] we can derive a simple criterion that allows to determine which class a given state belongs to .",
    "this is in contrast to the situation for three qubits , where up until now no such criterion is known . in particular , we show that none of these classes are empty and we provide an example of a genuine tripartite bound entangled state , i.e.  a state of three modes @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 that is separable whenever two parties are grouped together but can not be written as a mixture of tripartite product states and therefore can not be prepared by local operations and classical communication of three separate parties .",
    "the scheme of @xcite considers all possible ways to group the @xmath3 parties into @xmath66 subsets , which are then themselves considered each as a single party .",
    "now , it has to be determined whether the resulting @xmath50-party state can be written as a mixture of @xmath50-party product states .",
    "the complete record of the @xmath50-separability of all these states then characterizes the entanglement of the @xmath3-party state .    for tripartite systems ,",
    "we need to consider four cases , namely the three bipartite cases in which @xmath67 , @xmath68 , or @xmath69 are grouped together , respectively , and the tripartite case in which all @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 are separate . we formulate a simple extension to theorem  [ wernersepth ] to characterize mixtures of tripartite product states + * theorem [ wernersepth] * _ ( three - party separability ) + a gaussian three - party state with cm @xmath22 can be written as a mixture of tripartite product states iff there exist one - mode correlation matrices @xmath70 such that @xmath71 such a state will be called _ fully separable_. _",
    "the proof is in complete analogy with that of theorem  [ wernersep ] in @xcite and is therefore omitted here .",
    "a state for which there are a one - mode cm @xmath72 and a two - mode cm @xmath73 such that @xmath74 is called @xmath75 _ biseparable _ ( and similarly for the two other bipartite groupings ) . in total",
    ", we have the following five different entanglement classes :    class 1 : :    _ fully inseparable states _ are those which are not separable for any    grouping of the parties . class 2",
    ": :    _ 1-mode biseparable states _ are those which are separable if two of    the parties are grouped together , but inseparable with respect to the    other groupings .",
    "class 3 : :    _ 2-mode biseparable states _ are separable with respect to two of the    three bipartite splits but inseparable with respect to the third .",
    "class 4 : :    _ 3-mode biseparable states _",
    "separable with respect to all three    bipartite splits but can not be written as a mixture of tripartite    product states .",
    "class 5 : :    the _ fully separable _ states can be written as a mixture of tripartite    product states .",
    "examples for class 1 ( the ghz - like states of @xcite ) , class 2 ( two - mode squeezed vacuum in the first two and the vacuum in the third mode ) , and class 5 ( vacuum state in all three modes ) are readily given ; we will provide examples for classes 3 and 4 in subsection [ pptessec ] below .",
    "how can we determine to which class a given state with cm @xmath22 belongs ?",
    "states belonging to classes 1 , 2 , or 3 can be readily identified using the npt - criterion ( theorem  [ nptcrit ] ) . denoting the partially transposed cm by @xmath76",
    ", we have the following equivalences :    ( classification)[classific ] @xmath77 where the @xmath78 reminds us to consider all permutations of the indices a , b , and c.    the proof follows directly from the definitions of the different classes and theorem  [ nptcrit ] .",
    "what is still missing is an easy way to distinguish between class 4 and class 5 .",
    "thus to complete the classification we now provide a criterion to determine whether a cm @xmath22 satisfying ineqs .",
    "( [ openq ] ) is fully separable or 3-mode biseparable , that is we have to decide whether there exist one - mode cms @xmath79 such that ( [ fullsepdef ] ) holds , in which case @xmath22 is fully separable . in the next subsection",
    "we will describe a small set consisting of no more than nine cms among which @xmath72 is necessarily found if the state is separable .",
    "this subsection contains the main result of the paper : a separability criterion for ppt @xmath80 gaussian states , i.e. states whose cm fulfills ineqs .",
    "( [ openq ] ) .",
    "we start from theorem  [ wernersepth] and obtain in several steps a simple , directly computable necessary and sufficient condition .",
    "the reader mainly interested in this result may go directly to theorem  [ fullsepth ] , from where she will be guided to the necessary definitions and lemmas .    since the separability condition in theorem  [",
    "wernersepth] is formulated in terms of the positivity of certain matrices the following lemma will be very useful throughout the paper .",
    "we consider a self - adjoint @xmath81 matrix @xmath82 that we write in block form as @xmath83 where @xmath84 are @xmath85 , and @xmath86 matrices , respectively .",

    "( [ fullsep1 ] ) ; in the latter , one can find a solution among the intersections of the borders of the sets @xmath211 . that these are given by the @xmath212 is shown in appendix [ app ] .",
    "if a cm @xmath22 belongs to a separable state according to the above theorem then the point @xmath201 provides us with a pure one - mode cm @xmath72 such that @xmath213 . by construction @xmath214",
    "is a separable @xmath59 cm and by repeating a similar procedure as above with @xmath215 we can calculate a pure product - state decomposition of the original state with cm @xmath22 .",
    "in this section we construct states belonging to classes 3 and 4 .",
    "our construction makes use of ideas that were first applied in finite dimensional quantum systems to find ppt entangled states ( pptes ) @xcite and then generalized in @xcite to construct so - called _ edge states _ , i.e.  states on the border of the convex set of states with positive partial transpose .",
    "similarly , one can define `` edge cms '' as those that lie on the border of the convex set of ppt cms ( they are called `` minimal ppt cms '' in @xcite ) .",
    "this section is divided into three subsections . in the first one",
    "we define `` edge cms '' and characterize them . in the second and third subsections we present two different families of cms which contain edge cms .",
    "we also show that within those families we have cms belonging to all classes .      in the following",

    "note that a state with an edge cm automatically belongs to class 4 ( i.e.  edge cms correspond to 3-mode biseparable states ) . in order to fully characterize them",
    ", we will need the following definition .",
    "let us consider the complex vector space @xmath221 of dimension @xmath24 spanned by the vectors belonging to the kernels of all @xmath222 ( @xmath223 ) .",
    "we will define @xmath224 as a real vector space which is spanned by the real parts and imaginary parts of all the vectors belonging to @xmath225 . more specifically ,",
    "let us denote by @xmath226 a basis of @xmath225 , such that @xmath227 and @xmath228 are real .",
    "we define @xmath229 that is , the real span of the vectors @xmath227 and @xmath228 .",
    "note that this definition does not depend on the chosen basis @xmath6 [ as it is pointed out in appendix [ app2 ] , @xmath224 coincides with the real vector space spanned by all the vectors in the kernels of @xmath230 .",
    "we then have the following    ( characterization of @xmath80 edge cms ) + a cm @xmath22 fulfilling ( [ cond1 ] ) is an edge cm if and only if there exist no cms @xmath79 such that @xmath231 and @xmath232 .",
    "we will use the fact @xcite that , given two positive matrices @xmath233 , there exists some @xmath88 such that @xmath234 iff ran(@xmath6)@xmath235 ran(@xmath5 ) . according to the def .",
    "[ edgecmdef ] we can not subtract any real positive matrix from @xmath22 without violating the conditions ( [ cond1 ] ) .",
    "this is equivalent to imposing that there is no real vector in the intersection of the ranges of the matrices @xmath222 .",
    "this is again equivalent to saying that there is no real vector orthogonal to all the ker(@xmath236 , which in turn is equivalent to @xmath232 , since that vector should be orthogonal to all the real and imaginary parts of the vectors spanned by those kernels .",
    "now , if @xmath22 corresponds to an entangled state it is clear that @xmath237 .",
    "conversely , if @xmath237 was separable , then there must exist some real positive @xmath219 such that @xmath238 is separable , and therefore fulfills ( [ cond1 ] ) , which is not possible .    note that this theorem generalizes easily to the cases of more than three parties and more than one mode at each site .    in the construction of the following two examples of tripartite bound entangled states we are going to use this theorem .",
    "the idea is to take a cm @xmath43 of a pure entangled state [ which , of course , does not fulfill ( [ cond1 ] ) ] and add real positive matrices until the conditions ( [ cond1 ] ) as well as @xmath232 are fulfilled .",
    "if the resulting cm is not of the form @xmath239 then theorem 4 implies that it is an edge cm .",
    "in fact , we can add more real positive matrices keeping the state entangled [ and fulfilling ( [ cond1 ] ) ] . in order to see how much we can add",
    ", we can use the criterion derived in the previous section .",
    "this method of constructing cms belonging to class 4 also indicates how the corresponding states may be prepared experimentally . adding a positive matrix @xmath219 to the cm @xmath43 corresponds to the following preparation process :",
    "start with an ensemble of states with cm @xmath43 , displace them randomly by @xmath24 according to the gaussian probability distribution with covariance matrix given by the inverse of @xmath219 .",
    "this is a _ local _ operation ( that potentially needs to be supplemented by classical communication ) on each individual mode .",
    "the state produced by this randomization has cm @xmath240 @xcite .      in the first example",
    "we start out with an entangled state between the two parties alice and bob and the vacuum state in charlie and add two projectors to the corresponding cm .",
    "more specifically , we consider the cms of the form @xmath241 , where @xmath242 and @xmath243 with @xmath244 and @xmath245 can take any value different from zero . here , @xmath246 and @xmath247 , where @xmath248 and @xmath249 .",
    "in order to explain why the cm @xmath250 achieves our purposes , let us first consider the two  mode case in which the correlation matrix is @xmath251 .",
    "we denote now by @xmath252 [ where @xmath253 and @xmath254 the eigenvector corresponding to the negative eigenvalue of @xmath255 @xcite .",
    "since @xmath256 we have that the eigenvector corresponding to the negative eigenvalue of @xmath257 is @xmath258 . by adding a sufficiently large multiple of the projectors onto those vectors , we obtain a cm whose partial transposes are positive .",
    "note that in this case ( just two modes ) this would already make the state separable .    in the case of three modes",
    "with a correlation matrix @xmath22 the same argumentation applies , namely that by adding some projectors we can make the partial transposes with respect to a and b positive",
    ". however , we have to involve @xmath7 and thereby smear out the initial entanglement between @xmath5 and @xmath6 among all three parties .",
    "this is exactly what is achieved by adding the projectors @xmath259 and @xmath260 .",
    "if we choose now , for instance , @xmath261 , @xmath262 , and @xmath263 , then one can show that the set @xmath264 defined as in eq .",

    "[ extmssfig ] we illustrate to which class @xmath250 belongs as a function of the parameters @xmath267 . in order to determine this ,",
    "we have used the criterion derived in the previous section .",
    "it is worth noting that @xmath250 never becomes separable .",
    "this follows from theorem  [ fullsepth ] and the fact that both @xmath268 for all values of @xmath267 , as can be easily verified .",
    "this implies that the two ellipses [ c.f .",
    "( [ ellipse ] ) ] are just two points [ which coincide with the centers given in eq .",
    "( [ fullsep1 ] ) ] .",
    "thus , the only possibility that the circle and the two ellipses intersect is that the centers of the ellipses are the same and lie inside the circle .",

    "it is clear that for @xmath276 the state is fully inseparable , i.e. , it belongs to class @xmath277 , whereas for @xmath278 the state will be fully separable ( class @xmath279 ) .",

    "the ellipses must always lie inside the circle ( since if they where outside it would never be possible to obtain a separable state even for @xmath298 ) .",

    "@xcite for qubits , it is easy to see that gaussian states in classes 3 and 4 can not be distilled at all and are therefore bound entangled . for this , we consider @xmath3 copies of a class 3 state @xmath1 , and apply an arbitrary local quantum operation @xmath305 consisting of a classically correlated sequence of operations of the form @xmath306 .",
