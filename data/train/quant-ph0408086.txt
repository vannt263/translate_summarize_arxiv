    "understanding and quantifying the properties of quantum many - body systems is a central goal of theoretical condensed matter physics .",
    "progress is often hindered by an incomplete understanding of the highly non - classical entangled states that occur naturally as the ground and thermal states of many systems .",
    "entanglement is perhaps the most counter - intuitive feature of quantum mechanics , and results in stronger correlations than can be present in any classical system @xcite .",
    "recently , entanglement has been recognized as an important resource in the emerging field of quantum information science  @xcite , which has led to new tools that may enhance our understanding of the role of entanglement in quantum many - body systems .",
    "much recent work has focused on quantifying the entanglement naturally present in the ground state of standard models of coupled quantum systems , particularly spin chains . in @xcite",
    "the role of entanglement in a _ quantum phase transition _",
    "@xcite is investigated . in one - dimensional chains , the amount of entanglement between a length of spins and the rest of the chain appears to depend only on the universality class of the model at the phase transition  @xcite .",
    "various quantities associated with entanglement have been shown to display universal scaling behavior at phase transitions in one dimension @xcite .",
    "also , it appears that properties of entanglement between spins , such as the entanglement length defined in @xcite , are sometimes able to characterize phases of the system better than any correlation length  @xcite .    restricting to many - body systems where each system interacts with only a finite local neighborhood ( which we refer to as _",
    "local _ interactions ) very strongly constrains the quantum states that must be considered .",
    "for example , there exist quantum states that are far from the ground state of any local - interaction hamiltonian  @xcite . for finite systems with local interactions and an energy gap",
    "it was shown in @xcite that there are strong bounds on both the correlations and the entanglement in the ground state .",
    "the fact that local interactions strongly limit the entanglement that can occur for hamiltonian systems with local interactions on a line or a plane has been used to develop new approximation schemes for simulating quantum dynamics @xcite .",
    "there is now a large literature on the entanglement properties of the ground states of hamiltonian systems ; we refer the reader to @xcite and references therein .",
    "although the ground state plays an essential role in understanding physical systems , at finite temperature it is the thermal state that is of the greatest interest .",
    "the nature of entanglement in the thermal state of condensed matter systems was first studied by nielsen @xcite , who investigated how entanglement in the thermal state varied with temperature and other parameters of simple systems consisting of two coupled spins .",
    "subsequent work has investigated similar questions for quantum many - body systems @xcite .",
    "a recent experiment demonstrates that entanglement can affect thermodynamic properties of a system at high temperature @xcite .",
    "thus , it seems that many physical phenomena involving just the ground or thermal states in condensed matter systems may be associated with the nature of entanglement in the system , and it is important to investigate new techniques for understanding and quantifying the role of entanglement in such systems .",
    "desirable features of these techniques include that they be easily computable , even for large systems , that they be applicable at finite temperature and that they be in principle easy to measure and related to known physics .",
    "because most quantum systems are described by mixed states , these criteria lead naturally to the theory of mixed state entanglement .",
    "surprisingly , even the question of whether a mixed state of a quantum system is entangled or not is a difficult and much studied question .",
    "we refer the reader to the many reviews for the literature on the so - called separability problem @xcite .",
    "the difficulty of this problem is one of the reasons why computing measures of entanglement can be so challenging and why it is important to find more tractable ways of understanding the entanglement in real physical systems . in this work",
    "apply results from the theory of the separability problem to study the entanglement of quantum many - body systems .",
    "this investigation leads both to an understanding of the kind of hamiltonians possessing strongly entangled thermal and low energy states and also to interesting connections with properties of spins systems studied in more conventional condensed matter approaches .",
    "the specific concept that we use from the theory of separability is that of an _ entanglement witness _ : an observable whose expectation value is positive if the state of interest is not entangled but for which a negative expectation value indicates that the state is entangled .",
    "an example of such an observable is the bell observable which describes the outcomes of a test for the violation of bell inequalities . in this paper",
    "we explore the idea of interpreting hamiltonians with entangled ground states as entanglement witnesses .",
    "this point of view has attracted interest recently . during the preparation of this paper , related investigations appeared by brukner and vedral @xcite and by tth @xcite in which this type of entanglement witness is studied . as emphasized by brukner and vedral @xcite , because energy is a macroscopic thermodynamic property it is reasonable to expect that it could be measured in experiment .    in this paper",
    ", we develop the idea of using energy as an entanglement witness for quantum many - body systems .",
    "we introduce two related concepts inspired by the theory of entanglement witnesses , and discuss their relevance to both ground - state and finite - temperature properties of quantum many - body systems .",
    "the first is the _ entanglement gap _ : the difference in energy between the ground - state energy and the minimum energy that any separable ( unentangled ) state may attain .",
    "if the entanglement gap of a system is non - zero , then the entanglement of certain mixed states is detected simply by measuring their energy to be below this threshold . roughly speaking ,",
    "if the entanglement gap is small then a separable state can be a good approximation to the ground state , and we expect approximation schemes based on separable states to produce reliable results .",
    "we investigate how large this gap can be for two - spin systems and how this gap depends on the coordination number for lattices of coupled spins .",
    "one advantage of using ideas from studies of mixed - state entanglement is that it is possible to investigate systems at finite temperature .",
    "the second concept we introduce is the use of temperature as an indicator of entanglement in the thermal state . by comparing the thermal energy with the entanglement gap",
    "we obtain a temperature threshold , the _ entanglement - gap temperature _ , below which the thermal state is certainly entangled and we may expect entanglement to influence thermodynamic properties . we show that this temperature can become arbitrarily large as the dimension of two interacting spins increases even if the energy range of the system is kept fixed .",
    "we begin in sec .  [",
    "sec : hamentwit ] with the observation that hamiltonians with entangled ground states may be viewed as entanglement witnesses .",
    "we introduce the notion of entanglement gap and provide necessary and sufficient conditions for this gap to be non - zero .",
    "we construct a one - to - one mapping between hamiltonians with non - zero entanglement gap and entanglement witnesses .",
    "we prove a theorem that identifies a set of hamiltonians with the largest possible gap ; for spin-1/2 particles , one such hamiltonian is the heisenberg antiferromagnet .",
    "we then formally define the entanglement - gap temperature and investigate conditions that lead to a high value of this temperature .",
    "somewhat counterintuitively , the hamiltonians with the largest entanglement gap do not have the largest entanglement - gap temperature in general .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : multipartite ] we study the entanglement gap in many - body systems , in particular spin models on lattices .",
    "we prove a general result that the entanglement gap must go to zero with increasing coordination number on a bipartite lattice with a fixed local interaction .",
    "this result is suggestive of a relationship to the success of mean - field theory on lattices with high coordination number . in sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] , we conclude by investigating the dependence of the entanglement gap on frustration for the heisenberg antiferromagnet . we show that for such systems it is possible to determine that the system is entangled even when the reduced state of nearest neighbor spins is not entangled .",
    "we also investigate how the entanglement gap behaves near the quantum phase transition in the @xmath1 model and discuss its relationship to previous studies of entanglement at this transition .",
    "in this section we establish a formal connection between hamiltonians with the property that all low - energy states up to a certain energy are entangled , and entanglement witnesses .",

    "if @xmath14 has an entangled non - degenerate ground state @xmath19 then any separable state written in terms of the eigenstates of the hamiltonian must contain contributions from higher energy states and must therefore have higher energy than @xmath17 .",

    "conversely a non - zero entanglement gap requires that @xmath20 and so there can be no pure product state in the ground - state manifold because such a state would have energy @xmath17 .",

    "note that if @xmath29 and @xmath14 differ only by an additive constant they lead to the same entanglement witness .",

    "_    the entanglement gap quantifies the range of energies over which all states are necessarily entangled .",
    "note , however , that higher energy states may still be entangled .",
    "so , for example , the thermal state for @xmath14 must be entangled for all temperatures such that the thermal energy is below @xmath16 but at higher temperatures the thermal state may or may not be entangled .    in appendix",
    "[ app : semidefentgap ] we describe an efficient numerical procedure , a sequence of semidefinite programs , for evaluating the entanglement gap and discuss the concept of bound entanglement in this context .",
    "having defined the entanglement gap it is natural to identify hamiltonians that have the largest possible entanglement gap for a given multipartite quantum system .",
    "we proceed by proving two lemmas , one that the entanglement gap is invariant under local unitary transformations of the hamiltonian , and the other regarding the optimal arrangement of the energy levels .",
    "we use these two lemmas to prove the main theorem of this section , which is that a set of hamiltonians with maximum possible entanglement gap are those with a non - degenerate maximally entangled ground state and all other eigenstates at equal energy .",
