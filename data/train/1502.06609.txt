    "broad absorption line quasars ( balqs ) are a subtype of quasars , characterized by the presence of broad and blueshifted absorption features @xcite .",
    "the intrinsic fraction of quasars that are balqs is estimated to be typically @xmath320 per cent ( @xcite ; cf .",
    "@xcite ) , and ranges from @xmath34 per cent in blue , strong  emission quasars , to @xmath330 per cent in red , weak  emission quasars ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter blh13 ) .",
    "although there are several differences in emission properties between balqs and non - balqs , the two subtypes appear to be drawn from the same population @xcite .",
    "the  broad absorption line ( bal ) spans a large range in depth , width and the velocity shift ( ) of maximum absorption depth ( ) among different balqs .    what produces the large diversity of  bal properties ?",
    "the maximal outflow velocity of  bal has a clear correlation with the quasar luminosity in x - ray weak objects @xcite .",
    "the  bal absorption is on average stronger in balqs that also show lower ionization bals @xcite .",
    "recently , blh13 studied the median absorption properties of balqs , and found that the width and  of  bal are set by the  @xmath41640 emission equivalent - width ( ew ) , while the bal depth is controlled by the uv continuum slope in the 17003000    range ( ) .",
    "the explored bal profiles in blh13 are _ median _ profiles , derived from composite spectra of balqs from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; @xcite ) data release 7 ( dr7 ; @xcite ) .    in this paper , we extend the study of blh13 , and explore the dependence of the  bal profile on the  ew and  for _ individual _ absorption features in balqs from the same sdss dr7 sample ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "we find that in contrast with the median  bal profiles which have @xmath6  km  s@xmath1 , the individual profiles are rather narrow with a median @xmath0  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "we also find that  has a significantly weaker effect on the bal depth , and that the  ew has a weaker effect on the bal fwhm , compared to the effects implied by the median profiles in blh13 .",
    "as we show below , these differences result from the strong dependence of  on both  and the  ew .    the motivation to use the  ew and",
    "is driven by both observational and theoretical considerations ( see blh13 for a more extensive discussion ) .",
    "observationally , balqs are reported to have a weaker  ew @xcite and a redder  compared to non - balqs @xcite .",
    "theoretically , the ew of the  @xmath41640 recombination line is a measure of the continuum strength above 54  ev , compared to the near - uv continuum , and thus is indicative of the hardness of the ionizing spectral energy distribution ( sed ) .",
    "the uv slope is reported to correlate with other reddening indicators ( e.g.  @xcite ) , and is potentially indicative of our viewing angle , with objects observed closer to edge - on having a redder  ( blh13 ) .",
    "blh13 show that a small magellanic cloud extinction law with @xmath7  mag can explain the median reddening of balqs compared to non - balqs in a large range of @xmath8   , further supporting the interpretation of  as a dust - reddening indicator .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in section  [ sec : data_analysis ] , we describe the data analysis method .",
    "the results are presented in section  [ sec : results ] and discussed in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "section  [ sec : conclusions ] summarizes our conclusions .",
    "a complete description of the sample and the data analysis is provided in blh13 , and is briefly reviewed here .",
    "the data set is drawn from the sdss dr7 quasar catalogue of @xcite . in this catalogue , the balq classification is based on the @xcite balq catalogue for objects that are included in the sdss dr5 , and on a visual inspection of the  region for the remaining @xmath920 per cent of objects .",
    "an object is flagged as a balq by @xcite , if it has @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is a modified version of ` balnicity index ' ( bi ; @xcite ) . for @xmath11 , the integration over",
    "the normalized  starts at @xmath12 , rather than at @xmath13  km  s@xmath1  which is used for bi .",
    "we require the spectra to be in the @xmath14    range , i.e. @xmath5 for the sdss , which allows to cover the  bal and @xmath15    that is used for , and to exclude lobalqs using .",
    "this criterion produces a sample of 1691 balqs and 13,388 non - balqs .",
    "we further require the objects to have a signal - to - noise ratio s / n@xmath163 in the sdss _",
    "i_-filter , to avoid unusually low - s / n spectra , which excludes 39 balqs and 739 non - balqs .",
    "finally , we exclude 56 lobalqs with a  bal detection @xcite , and construct a sample of hibalqs only .",
    "the final data set is comprised of 1596 hibalqs and 12,649 non - balqs .",
    "it has been suggested that radio - loud ( rl ) balqs have different bal properties than radio - quite ( rq ) balqs ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast , @xcite find that rl and rq balqs are not fundamentally different objects . here , we use the radio loudness parameter @xmath17 provided in the @xcite catalogue , where @xmath18 is estimated from the first integrated flux density at 20  cm @xcite , assuming @xmath19 .",
    "objects with @xmath20 are classified as rl ( 89 balqs and 782 non - balqs in our sample ) .",
    "the fraction of rl objects is @xmath21 per cent in the balq and non - balq subsamples explored here , and thus has a little effect on our results . in the subsequent analysis , we mark rl balqs , but do not exclude them from our sample . as we show below , rl balqs have a preference toward a smaller  ew and a redder  compared to rq balqs , which results in a different ` typical ' bal profile .",
    "however , when rl and rq balqs are matched in the emission parameters ( see also @xcite , where the objects are matched in @xmath22 ) , there are no systematic differences in the  bal profile between the two subclasses .",
    "this implies that radio loudness has no direct effect on the bal properties .",
    "the following procedure is carried out for each object ( both a balq and a non - balq ) :    1 .",
    "the spectrum is smoothed by a 22 pixel - wide moving average filter , which is equivalent to @xmath91350  km  s@xmath1  ( i.e.  @xmath39 resolution elements ; @xcite ) .",
    "this relatively broad filter smooths out any narrow features ( @xmath23500  km  s@xmath1 ) superimposed on the  bal , and diminishes their effect on the measurement of maximum depth of the  bal ( see below ) .",
    "the spectrum is normalized by the mean  in the @xmath24    range .",
    "the  emission ew is measured by integrating the normalized  in the @xmath25    range , and approximating @xmath26 by a constant value of 1 between the normalization window and 1620   .",
    "this rough approximation of @xmath26 does not affect significantly our results ( see blh13 ) .",
    "the uv spectral slope  ( @xmath27 ) is measured between the 17001720 and 29903010    windows , using the mean  of each window .",
    "the accuracy of  is affected by the flux calibration of individual spectra .",
    "the flux is calibrated by matching the spectra of simultaneously observed standard stars to the magnitude of their point spread function , and it is accurate to a level of a few per cent for @xmath28    @xcite . for @xmath29   , @xcite report systematic excess light in the sdss dr7 spectra ( see also @xcite ) . since @xmath30    corresponds to @xmath31    for the lowest @xmath32 of our sample , the measurement of  is not affected by this systematic excess .",
    "we take from the @xcite catalogue the values of @xmath33   ) ,  fwhm and , which is evaluated using the @xcite prescription .",
    "we also calculate @xmath34 , where we use a bolometric correction factor of 5.15 from @xcite .",
    "the objects are binned based on the  ew and , into four bins for each parameter .",
    "the binning is such that each balq bin contains the same number of objects .",
    "the matching non - balq bins cover the same parameter range , but do not have equal number of objects per bin .",
    "[ fig : binning ] presents the distribution of  versus the  ew for the whole sample of balqs and non - balqs , and the boundaries that are used to define the bins .",
    "the  ew and  distributions for balqs and non - balqs within each bin can be somewhat different , but the difference in the median value of the parameter that is used for binning is below 10 per cent within each bin for all bins ( tables  [ tab : heii_bins ] and [ tab : auv_bins ] ) .",
    "there is no correlation between the  ew and  in balqs , and a very weak correlation in non - balqs .",
    "the spearman rank - order correlation coefficient is @xmath35 and @xmath36 for balqs and non - balqs , respectively .",
    "note that rl balqs ( fig .",
    "[ fig : binning ] , red triangles ) have a preference toward lower values of  ew and a red .",
    "we measure the maximum absorption depth ( cf ) , velocity shift of the maximum absorption depth ( ) and the fwhm for the deepest  bal trough of each balq . for brevity",
    ", we denote the maximum absorption depth as cf , noting that this notation is formally correct ( i.e.  implies the covering factor ) only if @xmath37 .",

    "the value of cf and the fwhm is estimated as follows :    1 .",
    "a non - balq composite is calculated for all the non - balq bins ( based on the  ew and ) . at a given  equals to the mean @xmath41 of 10 per cent of the objects above and below the median ( i.e.  20 per cent of objects in total ; see blh13 for details ) .",
    "] this composite is assumed to represent the intrinsically unabsorbed emission for the balqs which reside in that bin .",
    "each balq spectrum is divided by the non - balq composite .",
    "a power law is fit between 1600 and 1800   , and is extrapolated to @xmath42    ( using the 17003000    range for the fit produces similar results ) .",
    "4 .   the ratio spectrum [ from step ( ii ) ]",

    "the fwhm is the difference between these two values of .    measuring  from the emission - corrected absorption spectrum , i.e.  after steps ( i)(iv ) , rather than from the observed spectrum , does not change qualitatively the resulting trends which are explored below .",
    "the assumption in step ( i ) produces @xmath910 balqs per bin with cf smaller than 0.1 , which corresponds to @xmath45 ( i.e.  formally not a balq ) .",
    "however , we retain these balqs in our balq sample , since reclassifying the objects of the sdss dr7 quasar catalogue of @xcite is beyond the scope of our paper . excluding these balqs from the balq sample",
    "does not affect our results .",
    "as shown in blh13 , the selection by the  ew provides a well - matched  emission profile on the red side for balqs and non - balqs .",
    "the selection by  produces a balq / non - balq ratio spectrum with a weak pseudo - absorption at a level of @xmath230.05 for @xmath46 .",
    "a mismatch in the  emission profile has a very small effect on the measurement of bals with @xmath47  km  s@xmath1 , since the  emission is generally found at @xmath48  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "as we show below , the bals with @xmath49  km  s@xmath1  tend to have a @xmath50 that is well above 0.05 .",

    "<S> there is a large diversity in the  broad absorption line ( bal ) profile among bal quasars ( balqs ) . </S>",

    "<S> we find the following : ( i )  although the median  bal profile in the quasar rest - frame becomes broader and shallower as the uv continuum slope (  at 17003000   ) gets bluer , the median individual profile in the absorber rest - frame remains identical , and is narrow ( @xmath0  km  s@xmath1 ) and deep . </S>",
    "<S> only 4 per cent of bals have @xmath2  km  s@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> ( ii )  as the  emission equivalent - width ( ew ) decreases , the distributions of fwhm and  extend to larger values , and the median maximum depth increases . </S>",
    "<S> these trends are consistent with theoretical models in which softer ionizing continua reduce overionization , and allow radiative acceleration of faster bal outflows . </S>",
    "<S> ( iii )  as  becomes bluer , the distribution of  extends to larger values . </S>",
    "<S> this trend may imply faster outflows at higher latitudes above the accretion disc plane . </S>",
    "<S> ( iv )  for non - balqs , the  emission line decreases with decreasing  ew , and becomes more asymmetric and blueshifted . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests an increasing relative contribution of emission from the bal outflow to the  emission line as the ionizing spectral energy distribution ( sed ) gets softer , which is consistent with the increasing fraction of balqs as the ionizing sed gets softer .    </S>",
