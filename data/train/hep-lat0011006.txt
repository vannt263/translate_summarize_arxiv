    "in the last years , much effort has been paid to experimentally detect the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) in heavy - ion collisions . in these experiments , precise theoretical inputs about the nature of the transition and the equation of state ( eos ) of qgp",

    ", lattice qcd provides us with the most powerful method to compute thermodynamic properties of qgp from the first principles of qcd .    in the quenched approximation of qcd ,",
    "the study of finite temperature qcd is already well matured : computations of @xmath0 and eos have been made on lattices with several temporal lattice sizes @xmath1 , using both the standard plaquette action and various improved actions .",
    "continuum extrapolation to the limit of large @xmath1 has been performed with different actions to confirm good agreement within an accuracy of a few percent@xcite . for the pressure ,",
    "precise comparisons of the results from different calculation methods , i.e. the integral method@xcite and the derivative method@xcite , have also been made@xcite .",
    "the expected absence of the pressure gap at the first order deconfinement transition point has also been demonstrated through a new non - perturbative calculation of anisotropy coefficients@xcite .",
    "the quenched study is now entering a new stage : thermal effects on the pole mass have been studied by the qcdtaro collaboration using an anisotropic lattice@xcite .",
    "several groups are also trying to compute hadron spectral functions at finite - temperature applying the maximum entropy method@xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the study of full qcd at finite temperatures is still at the stage of development .",
    "until recently , eos with dynamical quarks has been computed only for the staggered fermion .",
    "the milc collaboration calculated eos in 2 flavor qcd with the standard staggered fermion on @xmath2 and 6 lattices@xcite .",
    "the bielefeld group computed eos for @xmath3 using an improved staggered fermion at @xmath2@xcite .",
    "this year , the bielefeld group extended the computation to @xmath4 and 3 and studied the @xmath5-dependence@xcite .",
    "a new development of this year is the first calculation of eos for a wilson - type fermion@xcite . using a renormalization group ( rg ) improved gauge action@xcite coupled with 2 flavors of clover - improved wilson quarks@xcite ,",
    "the cp - pacs collaboration performed a systematic study of the pressure and the energy density of qgp .    in this report , we concentrate on the development in finite temperature qcd with dynamical quarks , focusing on the topics of eos , and attempt a comparison of the results from different lattice fermions . in section [ sec :",

    "we then discuss new calculations of eos in section  [ sec : eos ] .",
    "a brief summary is given in section  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "= 8.0 cm    [ fig : phase ]      it has been difficult to study eos with wilson - type quarks due to several difficulties : one is the complicated phase structure due to the explicit violation of chiral symmetry and due to the appearance of the parity - flavor broken phase ( aoki phase)@xcite .",
    "therefore , a systematic study surveying a wide range of the parameter space is required .",
    "the second reason is that , when the standard plaquette gauge action and the standard wilson quark action are used , lattice artifacts are large on coarse lattices used in most finite temperature simulations , for example , unexpected strong phase transition is observed at intermediate quark masses in 2 flavor qcd@xcite .",
    "therefore , we have to use improved actions to suppress these lattice artifacts .",
    "the cp - pacs collaboration studied 2 flavor qcd with an rg - improved gauge action combined with a clover - improved wilson quark action@xcite .",
    "the first step is to clarify the phase structure for this combination of actions .",

    "the solid line @xmath6 is the location of the chilal limit at zero temperature",
    ". the pion mass decreases as @xmath7 is increased from small @xmath7 , and vanishes on the line @xmath6 .",
    "when @xmath1 is fixed as in most simulations , the temperature @xmath8 becomes higher as @xmath9 is increased .",
    "the dashed line @xmath10 is the pseudo - critical line for the finite temperature phase transition for @xmath2 .",
    "the region to the right of @xmath10 ( larger @xmath9 ) is the high temperature qgp phase , and that to the left of @xmath10 ( smaller @xmath9 ) is the low temperature hadron phase .",
    "the crossing point of the @xmath6 and the @xmath10 lines is the chiral phase transition point@xcite .    in the region above the @xmath6 line , a parity - flavor symmetry of the wilson - type quark action",
    "is broken spontaneously@xcite . at zero temperature ,",
    "the boundary of the parity - flavor broken phase ( the @xmath6 line ) is known to form a sharp cusp touching the free massless fermion point @xmath11 at @xmath12 .    at finite temperatures ,",
    "the parity - flavor broken phase retracts from the large @xmath9 region .",
    "the boundary of the parity - flavor broken phase at @xmath13 ( the @xmath14 line ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase ] for @xmath2 . as shown in this figure , the chiral transition point locates close to the cusp of the parity - flavor broken phase , the difference being at most of @xmath15 .",
    "this is consistent with the picture that the massless pion , i.e.   the goldstone boson associated with spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking , appears only in the cold phase .",
    "= 8.0 cm      an important step towards clarification of the qcd transition in the real world is the study of the finite temperature chiral phase transition in @xmath4 qcd .",
    "when the chiral transition in @xmath4 qcd is second order , the transition is expected to be universal to that in a 3-dimensional o(4 ) spin model : with the identifications @xmath16 for the magnetization , @xmath17 for the external magnetic field and @xmath18 for the reduced temperature , where @xmath19 is the chiral transition point , we expect the same scaling behavior as the o(4 ) spin model .",
    "therefore , confirmation of the o(4 ) scaling in qcd provides us with a test of the order of the chiral transition .",
    "the o(4 ) scaling was first tested with staggered fermion by karsch and laermann@xcite .",
    "the study was extended to a wider range of the quark mass and lattice sizes by the jlqcd collaboration@xcite and by the bielefeld group@xcite .",
    "however , an agreement of the critical exponents between the o(4 ) spin model and qcd with 2 flavors of staggered fermions was not obtained for @xmath2 .    for the case of wilson fermion ,",
    "et al._@xcite investigated the scaling relation ; @xmath20 using the rg gauge action combined with the standard wilson quark action .",

    "[ fig : o4 ] , qcd data is well described by the o(4 ) scaling ansatz also for this combination of actions .",
    "the best fit gives @xmath28 for the chiral transition point , with @xmath29 .",
    "this result suggests that the chiral transition is of second order for @xmath4 .",
    "this year , the milc collaboration published their final results of a study of scaling properties in qcd with standard staggered quarks@xcite .",
    "they found that the qcd data are inconsistent with the o(4 ) scaling , in accord with the previous results for the critical exponents@xcite . at the same time , a comparison of the results for @xmath212 suggests that the discrepancy with the o(4 ) scaling function may be removed when @xmath1 is sufficiently large .",
    "a different approach to clarify the origin of the unexpected results was proposed by kogut , laga and sinclair@xcite .",
    "they carried out a simulation at precisely zero quark mass by adding the additional , irrelevant four - fermi interaction to qcd . from their results obtained on @xmath2 and 6 lattices",
    ", they also suggested importance of simulations at larger @xmath1 .",
    "for staggered quarks , a comparison with an o(2 ) spin model is also important because the symmetry of the staggered quark action is o(2 ) at finite lattice spacings .",
