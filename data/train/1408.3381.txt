    "only two assumptions : newton s law and minkowskian space - time geometry suffice , according to our method , to derive the relativistic momentum and equation of motion ( with its invariance ) .",
    "we believe that the presented in this paper deductive approach to relativistic dynamics has some advantages over the standard one based on additionally introduced ad hoc postulates",
    ". it may be interesting for physicists aiming to understand the logical foundations of the form of the relativistic equation of motion and its direct connection with the space - time geometry and the definition of force ( newton s law ) .",
    "the main purpose of this work is to reveal a possibility of deriving the relativistic momentum and the relativistic law of motion purely by means of considering the dynamics of an accelerating body . assuming that the classical newton s second law @xmath2 is valid in any instantaneous inertial rest frame @xmath3 of moving body we get for a stationary system of coordinates @xmath4 the relativistic equation @xmath0 , with the relativistic momentum @xmath5 .",
    "also the general relation between the force @xmath6 and the force @xmath7 in the frame @xmath4 is derived .",
    "finally , a new approach to the transformation of force between two arbitrary frames is presented .",
    "the only relativistic assumption we need is that the space - time geometry is minkowskian , so that the lorentz transformation of coordinates is applied in our reasoning .",
    "there are several advantages of the method presented in this paper .",
    "the first is logical one : we do not need to introduce any unnecessary postulates that are used in the standard approaches . the traditional way [ 1,2 ] to derive the relativistic momentum",
    "requires the assumption that the relativistic momentum is a quantity conserved in elastic collisions independently of the inertial reference frame in which it is measured .",
    "this is quite non - trivial _ extra _ assumption which in fact should be verified by appropriate experiments .",
    "what is more , if the relativistic momentum is introduced in the traditional way , a second _ separate _",
    "postulate is needed to establish how a force influences the change of relativistic momentum .",
    "the proposed form of the relativistic equation of motion is @xmath0 because it fulfils two important requirements : a ) it reproduces the newtonian dynamics at the limit of small velocities , b ) this law is lorentz - covariant for the electrodynamic lorentz force .",
    "but it is merely a postulate to undergo further experimental investigation .",
    "it is evident that the requirement a ) may be satisfied by many other equations of motion that at the classical limit reduce to newton s second law . in turn",
    ", the requirement b ) refers solely to one kind of forces , i.e. the electromagnetic ones . instead of introducing an unfounded assumption",
    "we propose a more deductive method to arrive at the relativistic equation of motion .",
    "starting from the well - known and experimentally confirmed newton s law we show that _ for any kind of force _ the space - time geometry enforces a moving body to undergo just the _ relativistic _ law .",
    "furthermore , our attitude is quite _",
    "general_. we do not have to consider any sophisticated and uncommon thought - experiments ( i.e. specially arranged collisions with very small deflection of particles ) .",
    "let us note also that , as far as we know , in all cases the relativistic momentum is derived , authors examine only a collision of two _ identical _ bodies .",
    "the generality of conclusions obtained in such a way can not be satisfactory .",
    "moreover , according to our approach _ invariance _ of the relativistic equation of motion for any kind of accelerating force appears to be obvious and indispensable and no tensor formalism is necessary to prove it .",
    "let us notice also that invariance of the relativistic law of motion is shown in literature only for the electromagnetic forces .",
    "consider an accelerating body moving along a completely arbitrary trajectory .",
    "let in an instantaneous inertial rest frame @xmath3 of the body ( i.e. momentarily co - moving with the body ) a force @xmath6 causes within a time interval @xmath8 a change of its velocity @xmath9 .",
    "the force @xmath6 is a function depending on some features of the force - source and is determined by a force law established in the rest frame @xmath3 .",
    "let from the point of view of a stationary inertial frame @xmath4 the body possesses a velocity @xmath10 .",
    "due to the action of force the velocity @xmath10 changes in the frame @xmath4 in the direction parallel and perpendicular to @xmath10 according to the following equations , respectively [ 3 ] : @xmath11    @xmath12    because in the instantaneous rest frame @xmath3 the velocity of body @xmath13 is zero , the relativistic equation of motion in the frame @xmath3 has the form of the classical newton s law : @xmath14 remembering that @xmath15 and using eqs ( [ dvr ] ) and ( [ dvp ] ) we can rewrite this equation of motion valid in the rest frame @xmath3 separately for the direction parallel and perpendicular to the velocity @xmath10 : @xmath16    @xmath17    because @xmath18 , the equation ( [ row ] ) is formally identical to : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the value of the relativistic momentum of the body in the frame @xmath4 .",
    "we have introduced a vector @xmath21 to have this equation explicitly in vector notation .    in turn ,",
    "( [ prost ] ) can be written as : @xmath22 because : @xmath23\\frac{1}{v^2}=\\frac{1}{v}\\frac{(d\\vec{v})_\\perp}{dt}. \\label{dn}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that @xmath24 is perpendicular to @xmath25 , as expected .    collecting the results ( [ fr1 ] ) and ( [ fp1 ] )",
    "one can write them in the concise form : @xmath26 where @xmath27 .",
    "if we introduce a vector of relativistic momentum : @xmath28 which the time derivative can be written as : @xmath29 the result ( [ suma ] ) of the action of the force @xmath6 may be expressed as : @xmath30 the last equation may be rewritten in the commonly used in the standard relativity form of the _ relativistic equation of motion _ : @xmath31 where @xmath7 is called the force in the frame @xmath4 and is defined as follows : @xmath32 eq .",
    "( [ last ] ) is the correct ( known from the standard approaches ) relation between the force @xmath6 in the rest frame @xmath3 and the force @xmath7 measured in the system of reference @xmath4 .    in this way we have arrived at the desired relativistic equation of motion ( [ last ] ) .",
    "our method shows that if one considers an accelerating body moving in minkowskian space - time geometry , the form of the equation of motion indispensably must be given by eq .",
    "( [ last ] ) .",
    "moreover , the relativistic momentum defined in eq .",
    "( [ ped ] ) appears to be an inherent compound of this equation .",
    "since the frame @xmath4 is chosen completely arbitrarily , it straightforwardly follows also that the relativistic equation of motion ( [ last ] ) is the same for _ any _ frame of reference .",
    "its _ form _ remains invariant for any inertial system of coordinates .",
    "however , in each frame the force is different and depends on the velocity @xmath10 the body has just in this frame .",
    "( [ last ] ) shows that not only the value of @xmath10 is important .",
    "the _ direction _ of @xmath10 determines the decomposition of force @xmath6 on the directions parallel and perpendicular to @xmath10 by means of which the force @xmath7 in the frame @xmath4 is defined .",
    ". ( [ last ] ) offers us transformation of force @xmath6 from the instantaneous rest frame co - moving with a body to some inertial reference frame @xmath4 . from the practical point of view",
    "it is advantageous to express the force @xmath7 registered by an observer in the frame @xmath4 by a force @xmath33 from some other  stationary  system of reference @xmath34 .",
    "the reason is that it is troublesome to establish force @xmath6 in the rest frame of moving body .",
    "furthermore , some fundamental formulae describing forces are determined in such a system of coordinates , say @xmath34 , in which the _ source _ of force is at rest .",
    "the example is coulomb s law for the electrostatic interactions that describes the influence of a source - charge _ being at rest _ on other ( possibly moving ) charges .    to cope with this task we may use eq .",
    "( [ last ] ) two times : once for a system @xmath34 and again for the system @xmath4 .",
    "important is that in the both cases eq .",
    "( [ last ] ) contains the same force @xmath6 established in the rest frame @xmath3 .",
    "let in a system of coordinates @xmath34 an accelerated body has a velocity @xmath35 and the force in this frame is a function @xmath36 . according to our reasoning presented in the previous section the equation of motion in the frame @xmath34 is : @xmath37 with @xmath38 ; and using eq .",
    "( [ last ] ) the force @xmath6 registered in the rest frame of accelerated body is given by equality : @xmath39 note that the direction parallel and perpendicular are established with respect to the direction of vector @xmath35 .",
    "now , in some other system of coordinates @xmath4 the same body possesses a velocity @xmath10 .",
    "( [ last ] ) is valid and the force measured in this frame is @xmath7 . to express @xmath7 by means of @xmath36 again",
    "we refer to eq .",
    "( [ last ] ) .",
    "let us rewrite eq .",
    "( [ last ] ) specifying explicitly that the respective directions are related to the velocity @xmath10 :    @xmath40    on the basis of eq .",
    "( [ fnf ] ) @xmath6 it is a function of @xmath36 .",
    "( [ ffn ] ) together with eq .",
    "( [ fnf ] ) represents the desired ( implicit ) relation between forces @xmath7 and @xmath36 .    concluding , the procedure of finding the general relation between forces in different laboratory frames relies on the geometrical projections of the force @xmath36 on the directions of the respective velocities",
    "however , although eqs .",
    "( [ fnf ] ) and ( [ ffn ] ) look very simple , using them in particular cases requires some caution and practice .",
    "to show how the described procedure of transformation of force gives an explicit equation joining @xmath7 and @xmath36 let us consider simple but instructive example . it may be used to show that magnetic field can be derived straightforwardly solely from the coulomb law .",
    "we do not need to introduce neither the electric field transformation nor the relativistic effect of contraction leading to the change of density of charge .",
    "the presence of magnetic field is shown to be caused simply by movement of a charged point particle .",
    "additionally , this example teaches about the thomas rotation which must be kept in mind while the forces are transformed .    let a charge @xmath41 ( source of force ) be at rest in the frame @xmath42 .",
    "some other body having a charge @xmath43 moves in @xmath42 directly away in the direction of the @xmath44-axis with a velocity @xmath45 ( see fig .",
    "the force @xmath36 acting on the charge @xmath43 has a nonzero component only along the velocity @xmath45 , that is : @xmath46 where @xmath47 .",
    "let the axes of the rest frame @xmath3 be oriented along the respective axes of the system @xmath42 .",
    "certainly , also in @xmath3 the force has only the component along the velocity @xmath45 . from eq .",
    "( [ fnf ] ) we get the force @xmath6 in the rest frame of moving body : @xmath48    from the point of view of some other system @xmath4 the frame @xmath42 moves along the @xmath49-axis parallel to the @xmath50-axis with a velocity @xmath51 .",
    "the charge @xmath43 has then a velocity @xmath10 with respect to the frame @xmath4 . according to eq .",
    "( [ ffn ] ) to get the force @xmath7 we have to project the force @xmath6 on the directions parallel and perpendicular to @xmath10 .",
    "we emphasize that this operation must be made in the frame @xmath3 , so that we need to know the coordinates of the velocity @xmath10 as measured in this system of reference .",
    "first then from the well known general equations joining velocities in different systems we can find the velocity @xmath52 of the frame @xmath4 as registered in @xmath3 . since the relative velocity of frame @xmath42 with respect to the frame @xmath3 is @xmath53 and the frame @xmath4 has in the system @xmath42 the velocity @xmath54 perpendicular to @xmath55 , we have [ 3 ] : @xmath56 the relative velocity @xmath10 the system @xmath3 possesses with respect to the system @xmath4 has then in the system @xmath3 the components : @xmath57    from fig . 2 and with help of eq . ( [ wr ] )",
    "we see that : @xmath58 @xmath59    now , from eqs ( [ fninr ] ) and ( [ fninr ] ) and according to eq .",
    "( [ ffn ] ) the respective components of the force @xmath7 measured in @xmath4 parallel and perpendicular to @xmath10 are : @xmath60 @xmath61 more convenient is to have this force written by means of components along the axes of the system @xmath4 .",
    "first then we have to find the respective components of the velocity @xmath10 in the frame @xmath4 .",
    "because @xmath42 moves with respect to @xmath4 with the velocity @xmath51 and the velocity of body @xmath45 measured in @xmath42 is perpendicular to @xmath51 , the velocity in the frame @xmath4 is [ 3 ] : @xmath62 or @xmath63 note that the same relative velocity @xmath10 has different components in the frames @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( compare to eq .",
    "( [ wr ] ) ) .",
    "this effect is called the thomas rotation [ 4 , 5 ] and it means that the systems @xmath3 and @xmath4 appear to be rotated one with respect to the other ( see fig .",
    "3 ) .    according to fig .",
    "3 , eqs ( [ fins ] ) , ( [ fins ] ) and ( [ w ] ) we have : @xmath64 from eq .",
    "( [ w ] ) we get : @xmath65 one can then obtain after simple algebra that : @xmath66 and also from the definition of @xmath67 we have : @xmath68 inserting eqs ( [ gammy ] ) and ( [ beta ] ) into eq . ( [ fx1 ] ) and remembering that @xmath69 we get : @xmath70 similarly in an analogous way one can obtain that : @xmath71 because @xmath72 , we have @xmath73 . in this way the force @xmath7 may be expressed solely by variables used in @xmath4 : @xmath74 where we have used the relation ( [ w ] ) and substituted @xmath75 .",
    "the result ( [ sila ] ) is surprising . while in the frame @xmath42 the force has only one component along the @xmath44-axis ( eq . ( [ f ] ) ) , in the system @xmath4 ( having its axes pointed in the same direction as the axes of the frame @xmath42 ) there appears additionally a component along the @xmath49-axis . we recognize it as the magnetic part of the lorentz force : @xmath76 where the factor @xmath77 stands here for : @xmath78 it is the correct formulae on the magnetic induction satisfying the relativistically invariant maxwell equations . for a small velocity @xmath51 ( i.e. with @xmath79 ) it becomes the biot - savart expression on the magnetic induction produced in the frame @xmath4 at the location of the charge @xmath43 by the moving with velocity @xmath51 charge @xmath41 .    in turn , the @xmath80-component of the force @xmath7 given by eq .",
    "( [ sila ] ) has a form @xmath81 , where @xmath82 represents the electric field in the frame @xmath4 .",
    "note that it is properly transformed field @xmath83 from the frame @xmath42 to the frame @xmath4 , i.e. @xmath84 . finally then , if we ascribe a vector character to the field @xmath77 and assume it is a vector pointing along the @xmath85-axis of the frame @xmath4 , eq .",
    "( [ sila ] ) may be rewritten as : @xmath86 which shows that coulomb s force @xmath36 after the lorentz transformation has in the frame @xmath4 the form of the lorentz force .",
