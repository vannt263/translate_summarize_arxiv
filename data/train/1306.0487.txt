    "the quantum spin-1/2 dimer - plaquette or orthogonal - dimer chain @xcite represents one of the known examples of partially exactly solvable models with the dimerized ground state @xcite .",
    "originally it was suggested as a one - dimensional counterpart of the depleted square lattice @xcite or the shastry - sutherland lattice @xcite . despite its specific structure",
    "the shastry - sutherland model is related to a number of magnetic compounds ( srcu@xmath2(bo@xmath3)@xmath2 , tmb@xmath4 , tbb@xmath4 , etc . ) having either almost isotropic heisenberg or highly anisotropic ising interactions ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "magnetization curves of these compounds exhibit the set of fractional plateaux , which has not been firmly explained yet @xcite .",
    "a consistent explanation of the series of plateaux in a low - temperature magnetization curve of srcu@xmath2(bo@xmath3)@xmath2 remains the hot topic of the current research @xcite .",
    "the comprehensive study of the model is in general quite difficult and the only known exact result concerns the dimerized ground state for the sufficiently strong intra - dimer ( diagonal ) interactions @xcite . since the orthogonal - dimer chain or two coupled orthogonal - dimer chains @xcite can approximate to some extent the shastry - sutherland lattice , their study may reveal some basic features which are typical also for this frustrated two - dimensional model .",
    "for instance , the quantum spin-1/2 heisenberg orthogonal - dimer chain shows an infinite series of the magnetization plateaux @xcite . at the same time the heisenberg model of two coupled orthogonal - dimer chains considered in ref .",
    "@xcite exhibits a number of fractional plateaux and some of them are identical to the ones observed in the shastry - sutherland model .",
    "recently , a quite specific quantum spin-1/2 orthogonal - dimer chain with triangular @xmath1 heisenberg clusters coupled via the intermediate ising spins has been considered by ohanyan and honecker @xcite .",
    "this simplified ising - heisenberg orthogonal - dimer chain is exactly soluble by means of the transfer - matrix method and shows under certain conditions surprisingly good correspondence to the pure quantum model with all heisenberg interactions . in the present work",
    ", we will study another version of the spin-1/2 ising - heisenberg orthogonal - dimer chain , where the quantum heisenberg interactions are retained on all vertical and horizontal bonds coupled together through the ising interactions .",
    "this model preserves the @xmath0-component of the total spin on vertical heisenberg bonds ( dimers ) , which allows us to obtain exactly all ground states and thermodynamic properties . during the preparation of this work",
    ", we became aware of the similar work treating the same spin-1/2 ising - heisenberg orthogonal - dimer chain in an absence of the external field using somewhat different approach based on a direct algebraic mapping transformation @xcite .",
    "last but not least , let us provide some insight into an experimental background of our work . although the exactly solved ising - heisenberg models with alternating ising and heisenberg bonds could be regarded more as a mathematical curiosity rather than the realistic models of some actual magnetic materials , recent progress in the field of magnetochemistry has opened up new possibilities for a targeted design of magnetic materials with a very specific combination of magnetic interactions .",
    "a few eminent ising - heisenberg models have proved their usefulness by an explanation of the magnetic behavior of some real insulating magnetic materials such as [ ( cul)@xmath2dy][mo(cn)@xmath5 @xcite , [ fe(h@xmath2o)(l)][nb(cn)@xmath5[fe(l ) ] @xcite and dy(no@xmath3)(dmso)@xmath2cu(opba)(dmso)@xmath2 @xcite .",

    "it turns out that the antiferomagnetic superexchange coupling between dy@xmath8 and cu@xmath9 ions mediated by the oximate bridge is by far the most dominant coupling , whereas the superexchange mechanism for the double oxo - bridged dinuclear entities of dy@xmath8 ions and the macrocyclic dinuclear entities of cu@xmath9 ions transmit presumably much weaker ferromagnetic coupling @xcite .",
    "it can be clearly seen from fig.[fig_dy - cu](a ) that the magnetic structure of [ dy@xmath2cu@xmath2]@xmath7 implies a more complex ( asymmetric ) interactions between the spin-1/2 ising and heisenberg dimers , which involve in total four different exchange pathways between dy - dy , cu - cu and dy - cu magnetic ions ( see fig.[fig_dy - cu](b ) ) . for the sake of simplicity",

    "finally , the fully polarized triplet states on the vertical and horizontal heisenberg dimers become favorable for the special case of ferromagnetic intra - dimer @xmath65 coupling ( @xmath66 ) , whereas the nearest - neighboring vertical and horizontal heisenberg bonds are polarized in opposite direction . the boundary between the relevant phases",
    "can be readily calculated by comparing the ground - state energies @xmath67 of individual phases :    * sd - af : @xmath68 , * sd - maf : @xmath69 , * maf - af : @xmath70 .",

    "as it will be shown below , the ground - state boundary between maf and af has macroscopic degeneracy @xmath73 .",
    "the effect of non - zero magnetic field on the overall ground - state phase diagram is shown in fig .",
    "[ gs_pd2 ] for several values of the exchange anisotropy @xmath16 .",
    "consider first the particular case of antiferromagnetic heisenberg intra - dimer interaction with @xmath74 . under this condition ,",
    "the zero - field ground state can be either sd or maf phase depending on a mutual competition between the heisenberg intra - dimer and ising inter - dimer interactions @xmath15 and @xmath17 .",
    "however , the magnetic field of moderate strength destroys both sd and maf states due to energetic stabilization of the mfi phase , which is characterized by the alternating character of the non - magnetic singlets and fully polarized triplets on the vertical heisenberg bonds .",
    "consequently , this latter ground state manifests itself in a magnetization process as the intermediate one - quarter plateau , because there is no contribution to the total magnetization from the spins on the horizontal heisenberg bonds displaying a quantum antiferromagnetic order .",
    "a further increase in the external magnetic field leads to a presence of the sb phase , in which the non - magnetic singlets and the fully polarized triplets regularly alternate on the horizontal and vertical heisenberg bonds . as a result",
    ", the sb phase will cause a presence of the additional plateau at one - half of the saturation magnetization .",
    "finally , an extremely strong magnetic field naturally flips all spins to the external - field direction , which results in the fully polarized fm phase . to summarize our findings for the magnetization process",
    ", the zero - temperature magnetization curve displays two different intermediate plateaux at one - quarter and one - half of the saturation magnetization , which provide a macroscopic manifestation of two striking mfi and sb phases of purely quantum character .",
    "it should be noted that this picture does not qualitatively change for a more general case of the antiferromagnetic heisenberg intra - dimer interactions with @xmath19 .",
    "on the other hand , several topologies of the ground - state phase diagram are possible for the special case @xmath66 corresponding to the ferromagnetic heisenberg intra - dimer interaction . if @xmath75 , the new af phase can be detected in a low - field region of the ground - state phase diagram for sufficiently high values of the ising inter - dimer interaction @xmath17 . as a consequence , for sufficiently strong inter - dimer interactions",
    "the model exhibits a direct field - induced transition from the af phase towards the one - half plateau sb phase omitting the one - quarter plateau mfi phase .",
    "if the ising inter - dimer interaction @xmath17 is of moderate strength or sufficiently weak , the effect of external magnetic field is quite similar to the case discussed previously . the increasing magnetic field changes at the first transition field the ground state sd , maf or af to the one - quarter plateau mfi phase , then at the second transition field the mfi phase to the one - half plateau sb phase and finally , the sb phase at the saturation field to the fully polarized fm phase .",
    "accordingly , the one - quarter and one - half fractional plateaux are still present in the relevant zero - temperature magnetization curves .",
    "next , the vertical stripe corresponding to the maf phase completely disappears from the ground - state phase diagram for @xmath76 .",
    "finally , the ground - state phase diagram becomes quite simple for @xmath77 when the ferromagnetic heisenberg intra - dimer interaction of the easy - axis type supports the polarized triplet states only .",
    "the ground state in an absence of the magnetic field is created by the af phase and this order breaks at the saturation field to the fm phase .",
    "it is quite clear from the above argument that both intermediate fractional plateaux at one - quarter and one - half of the saturation magnetization vanish from the zero - temperature magnetization curve .    for completeness ,",
    "let us provide the expressions for boundaries between individual phases , which have been obtained by comparing the ground - state energies :    * sd - mfi : @xmath78 , for @xmath79 , macroscopic degeneracy @xmath80 in the limit @xmath81 ; * maf - mfi : @xmath82 , for @xmath83 , @xmath84 ; * mfi - sb : @xmath85 , @xmath73 ; * sb - fm : @xmath86 , @xmath87 ; * af - mfi : @xmath88 , for @xmath89 , @xmath80 ; * af - sb : @xmath90 , for @xmath89 , @xmath73 ; * af - fm : @xmath91 , for @xmath92 , @xmath87 .",
    "it is worthwhile to remark that the ground state at some phase boundaries is highly degenerate . to get the degeneracy ,",
    "we can apply the notion of counting the dimer coverings on a chain as used in ref .",
    "consider for instance the phase boundary between the sb and fm phases .",
    "the fm phase can be represented as a one - dimensional lattice of the gas where all sites are empty [ @xmath93 , while the sb phase corresponds to the configuration where each second site is occupied [ @xmath94 . here",
    ", the magnetized state of the heisenberg dimer is set to be an empty state , while the non - magnetic singlet state of the heisenberg dimer is represented by a filled state .",
    "as a result , the ground state at the relevant phase boundary between these two phases can be constructed from all configurations of particles with the following restriction : particles can not occupy neighboring sites , i.e. there is an infinitely strong nearest - neighbor repulsion between particles .",
    "such a system can be reformulated as a dimer problem , and the calculated degeneracy in the thermodynamic limit is given by @xmath95^n$ ] @xcite .",
    "it is noteworthy that the same value of the degeneracy is obtained at the boundary between the fm and af phases if the @xmath96 ( @xmath97 ) bond state is treated as an occupied site in latter case .",
    "similar representation can be constructed also at the sd - mfi and af - mfi boundaries .",
    "the only difference is that only vertical heisenberg bonds are involved into the lattice - gas picture .",
    "therefore , the degeneracy is @xmath95^{n/2}$ ] .",
    "all other boundaries have the degeneracy of monomers on a chain of size @xmath98 or @xmath99 or of the free ising spins .",
    "for instance , let us consider all possible configurations at the boundary between the maf and mfi states .",
    "the maf phase is consistent with the antiferromagnetic order of the vertical heisenberg bonds and can be schematically presented as [ @xmath100 . on the contrary ,",
    "the mfi phase shows on the vertical heisenberg dimers a regular alternation of the fully polarized triplet and non - magnetic singlet bonds [ @xmath101 . here",
    ", @xmath102(@xmath97 ) denotes the @xmath103 state and @xmath104 refers to the singlet state .",
    "both phases are two - fold degenerate . in this particular case ,",
    "the bond state on odd vertical heisenberg bonds coincides for both phases , while two different states ( either polarized or singlet ) are available for any even vertical heisenberg bond .",
    "two degrees of freedom of any even vertical heisenberg bond can be then identified as the fictitious ising spin @xmath14 and therefore , the ground state at the boundary between the maf and mfi phases has the macroscopic degeneracy @xmath105 .",
    "the special case of the af - sb boundary has the same picture as the maf - mfi boundary .",
    "the only difference is that the discussion concerns not only vertical , but all the bonds .",
    "thus , the macroscopic degeneracy at the af - sb phase boundary is proportional to @xmath106 .    the maf and af phases also have classical orderings ( antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic ) for the vertical bonds , i.e. [ @xmath100 and [ @xmath107 , [ @xmath108 correspondingly . at the ground - state boundary the energy of any random ordering of vertical bond configurations",
    "will be the same , which means that the ground - state degeneracy equals to @xmath106 for this particular case .",
    "the similar case is the phase boundary between the mfi and sb phases .",
    "the only difference with respect to the previous case is that @xmath97 on the vertical bonds must be changed to the singlet state @xmath104 .",
    "the rest of analysis is analogous and gives the degeneracy @xmath106 .    comparing the ground - state phase diagram of the spin-1/2 ising - heisenberg orthogonal - dimer chain with the analogous result for the spin-1/2 heisenberg orthogonal - dimer chain obtained by means of the extensive dmrg calculations ( see fig .",
    "9 of ref .  )",
    ", we observe that both phase diagrams contain the regions with the zero , one - quarter and one - half magnetization plateaux .",
    "the difference between phase diagrams becomes fundamentally distinct for the sufficiently strong inter - dimer coupling @xmath17 , when the dimer - plaquette phase evolves in the heisenberg model instead of the maf phase maintained by the ising - heisenberg model .",
    "this discrepancy is caused by an infinitely strong anisotropy of the ising inter - dimer interaction .",
    "in addition , the spin-1/2 heisenberg orthogonal - dimer chain exhibits the infinite series of magnetization steps between one - quarter and one - half magnetization plateaux @xcite , as well as , the continuous change of the magnetization from the one - half plateau to the saturation magnetization . on the other hand , the spin-1/2 ising - heisenberg orthogonal - dimer chain displays a high degeneracy at the saturation field that is accompanied with the respective magnetization jump instead .",
    "the macroscopic degeneracy found in the ground state may manifest itself in the low - temperature behavior of basic thermodynamic quantities such as entropy , specific heat or magnetization . at first",
    "one should notice that the entropy can take finite values at zero temperature whenever the ground state is macroscopically degenerate due to a phase coexistence .",
    "the entropy per site can be easily obtained using the thermodynamic relation @xmath109 , while the residual entropy on phase boundaries is related to the macroscopic degeneracy of the ground - state manifold according to the boltzmann s equation @xmath110 @xcite .",
    "thus , the residual entropy at the ground - state boundaries between different phases can be straightforwardly calculated from the results presented in section [ gs_section ] .",
    "bearing all this in mind , the residual entropy takes the value @xmath111 at the sb - fm and af - fm ground - state boundaries , @xmath112 at the sd - mfi and af - mfi boundaries , @xmath113 at the mfi - sb and af - sb boundaries , @xmath114 at the maf - mfi boundary . as one can see from fig .",
    "[ fig_entropy1 ] , the field dependence of the entropy indeed shows remarkable peaks at transition fields whose heights is in accordance with the reported values of the residual entropy ( the particular case shown in fig .",

    ".    it can be also clearly seen from fig .",
    "[ fig_entropy1 ] that even small temperature smooths the field dependence of entropy and thus destroys its distinct profile . besides",
    ", it is well known that quantum frustrated spin models may exhibit an enhanced magnetocaloric effect near the field - induced quantum critical point @xcite .",
    "we have therefore studied also the adiabatic demagnetization of the model under investigation , which can be easily understood from the density plot of entropy depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig_entropy2 ] .",
    "note that the curves of constant entropy determine the change of the temperature with the magnetic field during the adiabatic process . since the spin-1/2 ising - heisenberg orthogonal - dimer chain may have up to three critical fields accompanied with the macroscopic degeneracy of the ground state , the temperature rapidly decreases near a critical field whenever the entropy is selected close enough to the corresponding value of the residual entropy .",
    "this behavior may evidently promote a high adiabatic magnetocaloric rate @xmath115 .",

    "the specific heat near the mfi - sb border ( case of @xmath121 in fig .",

    "the specific heat for the other particular case of the ferromagnetic heisenberg intra - dimer coupling shown in fig .  [ fig_heat1](c ) has similar features .",
    "it should be nevertheless mentioned that the zero - field specific heat shows a very sharp low - temperature peak for the interaction parameters driving the investigated spin chain close to the maf - af ground - state boundary .",

    "contrary to this , the other particular case @xmath123 seems to be more robust against thermal fluctuations when the intermediate plateaux and magnetization jumps can not be discerned in the relevant magnetization curve just at slightly higher temperature .",
    "similar trends can be observed in the low - temperature magnetization curves of the investigated model with the ferromagnetic heisenberg intra - dimer interaction depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig_mag](b ) . under this condition , the magnetization curve may contain either one or two intermediate plateaux depending on an interplay between the interaction parameters .",
    "in general , it could be concluded that the rather rapid thermal smoothing can be attributed to the huge degeneracy of the ground state at critical fields .",

    "it has been shown that the ferromagnetic @xmath65 intra - dimer interaction may lead to the appearance of new phases in zero field and may substantially change the ground - state phase diagram in a non - zero magnetic field . in general , this kind of interaction leads to the vanishing of one - quarter and one - half plateaux .",
    "the ground state at the border between different phases may exhibit a high macroscopic degeneracy , which leads to the non - zero residual entropy .",
    "we have calculated the degeneracy and the residual entropy at all boundaries using the notion of the monomer or dimer covering of a chain @xcite .",
    "the degenerate or nearly degenerate ground state has turned out to basically affect the low - temperature thermodynamics of the model .",
    "we have calculated the entropy as a function of temperature and magnetic field , which evidences an enhanced magnetocaloric effect close to critical fields .",
    "the effect of spin frustration and magnetic field on temperature dependence of specific heat has been examined in detail .",
    "it has been found that the interplay of all factors may lead to the complex low - temperature behavior of the specific heat with several more or less separated maxima .",
    "the exact results for the magnetization curves have proved that even small temperature may destroy the step - like field dependence of the magnetization .",
    "we have also found that the ising - heisenberg model on the orthogonal - dimer chain exhibits some common features with the analogous pure heisenberg model , for instance a presence of the one - quarter and one - half magnetization plateaux .",
    "the main discrepancy between both models is as follows : when the heisenberg model shows step - like magnetization between one - quarter and one - half plateaux and a continuous change of the magnetization above the one - half plateau , the ising - heisenberg model can not capture those features as it possesses macroscopic degeneracy at critical fields only and shows just two intermediate plateaux .",
    "it could be expected , however , that the treatment of the quantum @xmath124 part of inter - dimer interaction within the perturbation theory for degenerate states could restore some features of the magnetization curve of the pure heisenberg model when starting from the exactly solved ising - heisenberg model .",
    "finally , it should be mentioned that there exist an extensive series of heterobimetallic coordination polymers [ ln(hfac)@xmath2(ch@xmath3oh)]@xmath2[cu(dmg)(hdmg)]@xmath2 @xcite with the magnetic structure similar to the considered model .",
    "in addition , the dysprosium - based member [ dy@xmath2cu@xmath2]@xmath7 of this series provides an interesting experimental realization of the spin-1/2 ising - heisenberg orthogonal - dimer chain owing to a strong magnetic anisotropy of dy@xmath8 ions . although a more complete description of the polymeric coordination compound [ dy@xmath2cu@xmath2]@xmath7 would require an analysis based on the more general ( asymmetric ) spin-1/2 ising - heisenberg orthogonal - dimer chain with four different exchange couplings , the af ground state reported for the symmetric spin-1/2 ising - heisenberg orthogonal - dimer chain with just two different exchange couplings already correctly reproduces the ferrimagnetic spin arrangement observed experimentally due to the antiferromagnetic inter - dimer and ferromagnetic intra - dimer interactions @xcite .",
    "moreover , the procedure elaborated in the present work can be rather straightforwardly adopted also for a theoretical treatment of the more general ( asymmetric ) spin-1/2 ising - heisenberg orthogonal - dimer chain , which would ensure a more correct description of the heterobimetallic complex [ dy@xmath2cu@xmath2]@xmath7 . in this direction",
    "we will continue our further efforts .",
