    "<S> we study de spectrum of primordial fluctuations and the scale dependence of the inflaton spectral index due to self - interactions of the field . </S>",
    "<S> we compute the spectrum of fluctuations by applying nonequilibrium renormalization group techniques .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we explore a mechanism to explain departures of the primordial fluctuations from the spectrum of a free inflaton field . </S>",
    "<S> this is important , because the spectrum of the inflaton field at the exit of the horizon is directly related with the level of inhomogeneity of the observed universe . </S>",
    "<S> the question we want to address is how the nonlinearities for an interacting field affect the predicted spectrum @xcite . to this end </S>",
    "<S> we will use a nonequilibrium renormalization group ( rg ) .    </S>",
    "<S> if the inflaton field were a free field , its spectrum would be of harrison - zeldovich type . at the horizon exit ( he ) of the mode with </S>",
    "<S> wave number @xmath0 it would be _ he . </S>",
    "<S> [ hz ] the spectral index @xmath1 measures deviations from this law . </S>",
    "<S> it is defined by [ spectral index ] _ he k^n(k)-1 . hence , the harrison - zeldovich spectrum ( [ hz ] ) has @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> present experiments show that the spectral index is close to one and that presumably it runs with the scale , n(k ) = 1 + ( k ) , just at the edge of the experimental precision @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we will compute the spectrum of the inflaton field for a toy model of inflation . </S>",
    "<S> the goal is to show how a rg defined for nonequilibrium problems can be used to predict the spectrum of an interacting inflaton field . </S>",
    "<S> we will assume a spatially flat robertson - walker metric with constant expansion rate @xmath3 , ds^2 = dt^2 - a^2(t ) ( dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2 ) , a(t ) = a_0 e^h t , and an inflaton field described by a massless @xmath4 action s [ ] = dt a(t)^3 . </S>",
    "<S> transforming to conformal coordinates = -(a h)^-1 , + a = _ c , [ conformal relation]and ignoring all the mass terms , the original theory is mapped into a scalar field theory in flat space - time with time coordinate @xmath5 , [ conformal action ] s[_c ] = d , where @xmath6 . we can show that if @xmath7 the expression ( [ espectro 0 ] ) is regained . </S>",
    "<S> note that when @xmath7 , the expectation value for the product of two conformal fields @xmath8 is given by the usual expression for a free field in flat space - time .using ( [ conformal relation ] ) , the expectation value for the original theory is . </S>",
    "<S> [ espectro 0 ] to obtain the spectrum , this expression must be evaluated when the mode @xmath0 exits the horizon . </S>",
    "<S> this happens when its physical wavelength @xmath9 equals the horizon size @xmath10 , that is , when a(t ) = k h^-1.[eta exit ] thus , replacing this value of @xmath11 in ( [ espectro 0 ] ) , eq . ( [ hz ] ) is recovered . </S>",
    "<S> we will use rg techniques to compute the spectrum when @xmath12 .    </S>",
    "<S> the basic idea of rg for systems in equilibrium ( where time does not enter in the description ) is the coarse graining of the original system , i.e. the change in the resolution with which the system is observed @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> given a system with a range of scales which goes up to wave number @xmath13 , if we are only interested in scales up to wave number @xmath14 , we can separate the original system in two sectors : a lower wave number sector , with @xmath15 , the relevant system , and a higher wave number sector with @xmath16 , the environment . once this division is done , </S>",
    "<S> the environment modes are eliminated from the description . in equilibrium </S>",
    "<S> , this is achieved by computing the coarse grained in - out effective action for the lower sector , complemented with a rescaling of the fields and momenta that restores the cutoff and the coefficient of the @xmath17 term in the action to their initial values . </S>",
    "<S> the elimination of the modes between @xmath13 and @xmath0 proceeds by infinitesimal steps . in this way </S>",
    "<S> , the calculation involves only tree and one loop diagrams , and the resulting equations form a set of differential equations for the parameters that define the effective action @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> essentially , the same scheme can be used for nonequilibrium systems . </S>",
    "<S> the main difference with the usual approach is that the time variable must enter in the description . </S>",
    "<S> we want to compute true expectation values at given times , not transition amplitudes between in and out asymptotic states , far away in the future and in the past . </S>",
    "<S> we want to follow the real and causal evolution of expectation values , for which the usual in - out representation is not appropriate . </S>",
    "<S> a suitable description of nonequilibrium systems is given within the closed time path ( ctp ) formalism @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the number of fields is doubled , path integrals are over two histories @xmath18 and @xmath19 , that coincide at the time of observation @xmath20 , which is a new dimensional parameter of the theory .    </S>",
    "<S> the possibility of couplings between the two histories enlarge the parameter space . </S>",
    "<S> notably , it includes noise and dissipation . written in terms of @xmath21 and @xmath22 , the free action for a scalar field in the ctp formalism is @xmath23 = \\displaystyle\\int_{0}^{t } \\!\\!dt \\displaystyle\\int\\ ! d^d\\!q \\;\\bigg [ & \\frac{1}{2 } \\dot\\phi \\ ; \\dot\\varphi - \\displaystyle\\frac{1}{2 } \\left(q^2 + m^2\\right ) \\phi\\cp \\label{the action 0 }   & - \\kappa \\ ; \\phi \\dot\\varphi+ \\displaystyle\\frac{i}2 \\nu \\ ; \\phi \\phi \\bigg ] . \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] [ @xmath24 , etc . ] here @xmath25 is associated to dissipation and @xmath26 to noise . for a given order @xmath27 in the fields , there are @xmath27 possible interaction terms . thus , for example , the quartic interactions that can appear in the ctp action are _ 0^t _ </S>",
    "<S> i=1 ^ 4 dt_i _ </S>",
    "<S> i=1 ^ 4 d^dq_i & . in principle </S>",
    "<S> , all the allowed couplings must be taken into account to compute the rg equations .    even when the initial action at scale @xmath13 is the usual , local , massless , @xmath28 action , which in the ctp representation reads [ original theory ] s_= _ 0^t dt , as short wave number modes are eliminated out , the rg flow generates all the possible terms , with an arbitrary number of fields and nonlocal dependencies ( but with certain constrains imposed by the ctp formalism ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , after a brief excursion , most of these terms will go to zero along with @xmath29 , except for a few terms in the free action . </S>",
    "<S> the effective action at scale @xmath0 will be given approximately by ( [ the action 0 ] ) , but its parameters will depend on both , the scale @xmath0 and the time @xmath20 </S>",
    "<S> s_k ~_0^t dt d^dq \\ { & - + & - ( ) ( k , t ) + ( ) ^2 ( k , t ) ^2 } . </S>",
    "<S> [ free theory ] here we have extracted from @xmath30 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 the factors merely induced by the rescaling . </S>",
    "<S> the influence of the environment on the spectrum of the long wave modes will manifest through these terms @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the flow of the rg drives the initial interacting theory ( [ original theory ] ) towards the free theory ( [ free theory ] ) , and allow us to find a relation between expectation values associated with each theory . </S>",
    "<S> the relation is [ relation ] g(k , t , ( , t ) ) = ( /k)^(k , t ) g ( , ( /k)^(k , t ) t , ( k , t ) ) . on the left hand side , @xmath31 is the two field expectation value computed for a mode @xmath0 at time @xmath32 , and @xmath33 stands for the set of parameters which define the action at scale @xmath13 . in our case the only parameter is the coupling constant @xmath29 . on the right hand side , @xmath31 is the expectation value of the theory defined by the set of parameters @xmath34 , reached after modes between @xmath0 and @xmath13 have been eliminated . </S>",
    "<S> the relevant parameters in @xmath34 are @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the exponents @xmath38 and @xmath39 depend on the trajectory followed by the action when it goes from scale @xmath13 to @xmath0 .    </S>",
    "<S> now we connect to the original problem for the power spectrum of an interacting inflaton field . </S>",
    "<S> we must feed the rg group equations with an initial condition at scale @xmath13 and then use the relation ( [ relation ] ) to obtain the expectation value for the mode @xmath0 as it exits the horizon . the initial condition , in terms of the conformal field , </S>",
    "<S> is given by the ctp action at scale @xmath13 , eq.([original theory ] ) , where @xmath32 has to be substituted by the conformal time @xmath40 . according to eq.([eta exit ] ) , the mode @xmath0 exits the horizon when = -k^-1 . </S>",
    "<S> if inflation starts at @xmath41 , the time that the mode @xmath0 spends inside the horizon is given by _ k = -k^-1 - ^*. for the interacting theory eq.([espectro 0 ] ) , reads _ he & = k^-2 g(k , _ k , ) . from eq.([relation ] ) , identifying @xmath32 and @xmath20 with @xmath42 , we get _ he & = k^-2 ( /k)^(k , _ k ) + & g ( , ( /k)^(k , _ k ) _ k , \\{m^2(k , _ k ) , ( k , _ k ) , ( k , _ k ) } ) . </S>",
    "<S> [ relation 2 ] here , the relevant elements of @xmath43 have been shown explicitly . </S>",
    "<S> the right hand side of eq.([relation 2 ] ) can be calculated using the @xmath31 corresponding to the action ( [ free theory ] ) g(k , t , \\{m^2 , , } ) = ( - ) e^-2 t + [ prop cg],where @xmath44 and @xmath45 @xcite .    the expressions for @xmath30 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 , and for the exponents @xmath38 and @xmath39 in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ relation 2 ] ) , as functions of @xmath0 and @xmath42 are given in @xcite . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 we show @xmath46 , defined in ( [ spectral index ] ) , as function of @xmath0 for a particular choice of @xmath29 and @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> ( we have chosen @xmath47 , large enough so the ratio @xmath48 can be about 100 , the expected ratio between the maximum and minimum length scales of the inhomogeneities . ) </S>",
    "<S> the main effects are introduced by the mass term .     </S>",
    "<S> as function of @xmath0 ( solid curve ) , with @xmath49 , and @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> the dashed curve shows @xmath46 once the rapidly oscillatory terms have been removed . </S>",
    "<S> the main departures from zero come from the mass term induced by the coarse graining.,width=415 ]    we have presented a toy model for computing the spectrum of the fluctuations of the inflaton field . at the present stage we do not pretend to derive quantitative conclusions from this model . our main concern was to show that the same arguments usually given in the context of the rg in equilibrium , can be extended to nonequilibrium problems using the ctp formalism , where noise and dissipation show up naturally .    </S>",
