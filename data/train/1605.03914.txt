    "epidemic spreading and opinion formation are two dynamical processes that have been atracted the interest of the scientific community in the last decades @xcite .",
    "the interest of physicists varies from theoretical aspects like critical phenomena @xcite , stochasticity @xcite , universality @xcite and multiple phase transitions @xcite , to practical questions like the detection of the zero patient @xcite , super spreaders @xcite , effects of self isolation @xcite and others .",
    "more recently , the coupling of epidemic and opinion models have also been considered @xcite .    regarding a vaccination campaign in a given population , the individuals consider some points in order to make the decision to take the vaccine or not .",
    "in the case when a considerable fraction of the population decides to not take the vaccine , the consequences for the whole population may be drastic .",
    "as an example , in 2010 the french govenment requested vaccine for h1n1 for 90 million individuals , but about 6 million of the vaccines were effectively used by the population , and in this case the disease has spread fast @xcite . in this case , one can see that the public opinion can be a key feature in the diffusion of a disease in a given population , promoting the occurrence or the lack of an outbreak .",
    "the public opinion about vaccination can be affected by economic factors .",
    "for example , we have a competition between the `` cost '' to become vaccinated ( collateral effects , required time to take the vaccine , ... ) and the injury caused by the disease when the individual did not take the vaccine ( medication , money , miss some days of work , ... ) . in this case , the usual approach is to consider game theory or epidemiological - economic models @xcite .",
    "however , usually the individuals / agents do not take into account only economic factors @xcite .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , _",
    "`` if individuals are social followers , the resulting vaccination coverage would converge to a certain level , depending on individuals initial level of vaccination willingness rather than the associated costs . '' _ in addition , in @xcite it is discussed that _",
    "`` assumptions of economic rationality and payoff maximization are not mandatory for predicting commonly observed dynamics of vaccination coverage such as the failure to reach herd immunity and oscillations between high and low levels of coverage '' . _",
    "related to social norms , the authors in @xcite propose that _",
    "`` including injunctive social norms will enable models of parental vaccinating behaviour for paediatric infectious diseases to better explain the whole range of observed vaccinating behaviour , including both vaccine refusal and the high vaccine coverage levels so commonly observed '' . _",
    "indeed , some other works have shown that individuals are influenced by their social contacts in the process of opinion formation about a vaccination process @xcite . in this case , in this work we consider an opinion formation process coupled with an epidemic dynamics where vaccination is taking into account .",
    "our target is to investigate how the density of infected individuals in short and long times is affected by the social pressure and the engagement of the individuals regarding the vaccination .",
    "thus , we are interested in answer some theoretical and practical questions :    * what is the effect of social pressure and engagement in the epidemic spreading process ? * what are the conditions for the occurrence of epidemic outbreaks in short times ? * what is the critical initial density of pro - vaccine individuals that can avoid the occurrence of such short - time outbreaks ?",
    "* the disease will survive in the long - time limit ?",
    "the answer for these questions are given in the next sections .",
    "an individual s willingness to vaccinate is derived from his perception of disease risk and vaccine safety .",
    "however , the interactions among individuals in small groups will also affect the decision of the individuals to take or not the vaccine . in this case",
    ", we will consider an epidemic dynamics coupled with an opinion dynamics regarding the vaccination .",
    "thus , we consider a fully - connected population with @xmath0 individuals or agents , that can be classified as follows :    * opinion states : pro - vaccine ( opinion @xmath1 ) or anti - vaccine ( opinion @xmath2 ) individuals ; * epidemic compartments : susceptible ( s ) , infected ( i ) or vaccinated ( v ) individuals ;    each opinion is supported by a given fraction of the population , namely @xmath3 and @xmath4 , representing the fraction of pro - vaccine and anti - vaccine agents , respectively .",
    "we define the initial density of @xmath5 opinions as @xmath6 , that is a parameter of the model , and in this case the density of @xmath7 opinions at the beginning is @xmath8 .",
    "there are many models of opinion dynamics in literature @xcite , and as a simple modeling of such dynamics we considered that the opinion changes are ruled by the majority - rule dynamics @xcite , i.e. , we choose at random a group of 3 agents .",
    "if there is a local majority ( @xmath9 ) in favor of one of the two possible opinions , the individual with minority opinion will follow the local majority . in this case",
    ", we are considering a mean - field formulation for the opinion dynamics . in the following we will see that the epidemic dynamics is also defined at a mean - field level . despite the simplicity of a mean - field approach , it allows us an analytical treatment , that is important to a better understanding of a new model .",
    "topologically , the mean - field approach corresponds to a fully - connected population , where each individual interacts with all others . in this case",
    ", it is also a realistic situation thanks to the modern communication networks @xcite .",
    "finally , it has been discussed that one can capture most of the dynamics of an epidemic on a real social network using only mean - field calculations @xcite .",
    "regarding the epidemic dynamics , we made some assumptions .",
    "first of all , the opinion of an agent about the vaccination process determines his behavior regarding the decision to take the vaccine or not @xcite . as discussed in @xcite , _ `` after conducting large scale studies on the acceptance of the influenza vaccine , chapman et al .",
    "@xcite conclude that perceived side - effects and effectiveness of vaccination are important factors in people s decision to vaccinate '' .",
    "_ we also considered that at the same time the disease is introduced in the population , a mass vaccination campaign is started .",
    "this is a realistic assumption , since usually the governements act fast in order to avoid disease outbreaks . for simplicity",
    ", we did not consider competition for doses .",
    "finally , we considered as some authors @xcite that both dynamics ( opinion and epidemic ) occurs at the same time scale , i.e. , the opinions evolve in the population due to interactions among agents , and at the same time a vaccination campaign occurs and the individuals may move among the epidemic compartments , that are defined in more details in the following .",
    "all these assumptions simplify the problem and makes the following analytical treatment easier .",
    "furthermore , they are realistic , and were also considered by some authors from epidemiologists to mathematicians @xcite .",
    "now , let us elaborate upon the coupling of the two distinct dynamics ( opinion and epidemic ) .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows an esquematic representation of the dynamics .",
    "the pro - vaccine agents ( opinion @xmath1 ) take the vaccine with probability @xmath10 .",
    "this parameter can be viewed as the engagement of the individuals regarding the vaccination campaign , i.e. , it measures the tendency of an agent to go to the hospital to take a dose of the vaccine . indeed",
    ", many times the individuals refuse to leave home to take a vaccine due to the time expended to conclude all the process . in this case",
    ", the complementary probability @xmath11 will represent this `` laziness '' . in the case",
    "a given individual does not take the vaccine , he can become infected with probability @xmath12 if he make a contact with an infected individual , as in a standard sis model @xcite .",
    "in the same way , an infected individual becomes susceptible again with probability @xmath13 .",
    "considering the vaccinated agents , we considered that the vaccine is not permanent , so a vaccinated agent becomes susceptible again with rate @xmath14 , the resusceptibility probability @xcite .",
    "summarizing , the individuals with opinion @xmath1 can undergo the following transitions among the epidemic compartments :    * @xmath15 : each susceptible and pro - vaccine individual becomes vaccinated with probability @xmath10 ; * @xmath16 : each susceptible and pro - vaccine individual becomes infected with probability @xmath17 if he is in contact with an infected agent .",
    "on the other hand , the agents against the vaccination process do not take the vaccine . in this case",
    ", they follow a standard sis dynamics , with infection probability @xmath12 and recovery probability @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "finally , the common transitions among states for both agents ( @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) are given by    * @xmath18 : each infected individual recovers and becomes susceptible again with probability @xmath13 ; * @xmath19 : each vaccinated individual becomes susceptible again with the resusceptibility probability @xmath14 , since the vaccine wears off @xcite .        as discussed above , as initial conditions we considered a fraction @xmath6 ( @xmath8 ) of individuals carrying the opinion @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) at @xmath20",
    "in addition , @xmath21 of the individuals start the dynamics in the infected state , and the remaining @xmath22 in the susceptible compartment .",
    "we considered synchronous update schemes for opinion and epidemic dynamics , i.e. , both the transitions among the opinions and among the epidemic compartments are updated in a parallel way . for each simulation time step , the algorithm is as follows :    * we visit every site @xmath23 in sequential order , and for each site @xmath23 we choose at random other two sites @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "then we apply the majority rule to each group of 3 agents ( @xmath26 ) . *",
    "the opinions are updated using a parallel scheme ; * after the opinion dynamics , we visit every site in a sequential order ; * we apply the epidemic dynamics rules to each agent ; * the epidemic states of the individuals are updated using a parallel scheme .    for the epidemic dynamics ,",
    "the numerical procedure is as follows . for a spontaneous transition ( with no contact , for example @xmath27 or @xmath28 ) , the associated probability ( @xmath10 and @xmath13 for the mentioned transitions , respectively )",
    "is compared with a uniformly distributed random number . in the case where a direct contact is needed ,",
    "for example if we take a susceptible agent , as we are considering a fully - connected network we choose at random another agent .",
    "if this agent is infected , the transition @xmath29 occurs with probability @xmath12 . for more details of the numerical procedure ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the mean - field equations for the model can be written as @xmath30 where @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the fractions of susceptibles , infected and vaccinated individuals , respectively .",
    "all the analytical calculations are performed in details in the appendix [ app ] . in the following section we discuss the main analytical results and the outcomes of our simulations .",
    "after the definition of the model , one can start to answer the four questions formulated at the end of the introduction . as we are considering a fully - connected network , we considered the above mean - field equations to analyze the system , eqs .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) - ( [ eq3 ] ) , with special attention to the stationary properties of the model .",
    "we also considered an agent - based modelling of the system , since the individuals ( agents ) are the primary subject in a social theory @xcite .",
    "for this purpose , we considered populations with @xmath34 agents , and for sake of simplicity and without loss of generality .",
    "is small in the dynamics ] , we fixed the recovery probability @xmath35 in all simulations .",
    "considering the stationary states of the model , all of our results are averaged over @xmath36 independent simulations in order to obtain better statistics .    in",
    "the following we will consider separately the short - time and the long - time behavior of the system .",
    "let s start with the short - time behavior of the model , which allows us to analyze the question ( i ) made in the introduction .",
    "as discussed in the previous section , our initial conditions are @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "thus , one can derive an analytical expression for the effective reproductive number @xmath42 through eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) ,    .",
    "we considered eqs .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) and ( [ eq7 ] ) with parameters @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath35 , and @xmath12 was varied from @xmath45 to @xmath46 . in this case",

    "in other words , eq .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) exhibits explicitly the coupling of the opinion and epidemic dynamics , including the usual dependence of the effective reproduction number @xmath42 on the initial condition @xmath51 . if @xmath52 we have the basic reproduction ratio @xmath53 that is defined as the average number of individuals one infectious person would infect ( over their entire period of infectiousness ) if everyone in the population were susceptible @xcite .",
    "looking for eq .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) , one can see that the occurrence of an outbreak decays for increasing values of @xmath10 and @xmath6 . in this case , the initial fraction of vaccine supporters and the people engagement are important keys in the prevention of outbreaks , that is a realistic feature of the model .",
    "observe that for @xmath54 ( no vaccination ) , the above expression ( [ eq5 ] ) recovers the usual sis result , @xmath55 .    in order to compare both expression for the effective reproductive number",

    "( [ eq5 ] ) as @xmath56    to avoid an epidemic outbreak , @xmath57 , which implies that @xmath58 . in this case",

    "red region ( @xmath61 ) : in this region the solution ( [ eq7 ] ) is mathematically valid but it presents no physical meaning .",
    "it indicates that the outbreak does not occur due to purely epidemic reasons , i.e. , we have @xmath62 since @xmath63 ; 2 .",
    "green region ( @xmath64 ) : in this region the initial minority is favorable to the vaccination .",
    "however , this minority can avoid the epidemic outbreak , and one can see the _ power of the initial minority in the short time _ @xcite .",
    "3 .   blue region ( @xmath65 ) : in this region , the initial majority is in favor of the vaccination .",
    "thus , depending on the engagement of such majority the outbreak can be avoided , and one can see the _ power of the initial majority in the short time _ @xcite .",
    "purple region ( @xmath66 ) : in this region the solution ( [ eq7 ] ) is also not physically acceptable .",
    "it indicates that the outbreak can not be avoided , even if @xmath67 of the population is in favor of the vaccination .",

    "those last results answer the questions ( ii ) and ( iii ) made in the introduction .      in this section",
    "we analyze the long - time behavior of the model , i.e. , its steady - state properties , and one can discuss the question ( iv ) pointed in the introduction .",
    "as we will see in the following , in opposition to what happend in the short - time case , the stationary behavior of the model depends on the resusceptibility probability @xmath14 . in this case",

    "first of all , one can see that , if the initial majority is in favor of the vaccination campaign ( @xmath76 ) , the disease disappears of the population in the steady state , independent of the values of @xmath10 and @xmath12 , as predicted analytically in eqs .",

    "if the the population is initially mainly dominated by individuals against the vaccination , the engagement has no effect on the disease propagation , and we have an endemic phase . in this case , the social pressure causes a negative effect on the disease spreading @xcite .",
    "however , one can see in figure [ fig7 ] an interesting result for the cases with @xmath75 : despite the mentioned negative effect of social pressure , a sufficient high engagement like @xmath96 can lead to the disease extinction in the stationary state , since the initial majority of anti - vaccine individuals is not much larger than the initial minority of pro - vaccince agents .",
    "this result can be observed in the three graphics of figure [ fig7 ] , and is more pronounced for the smaller values of the infection probability @xmath12 .",
    "these results can be seen as a kind of power of the minority in the long - time limit .",
    "all those results are realistic features of our model .",
    "in this work , we have studied a model of epidemic spreading coupled with an opinion dynamics .",
    "such opinion dynamics simulates the competition of two distinct positions regarding a vaccination campaign : pro - vaccine x anti - vaccine individuals . as a minimal model",
    ", we considered that this competition is represented in our case by the galam s majority - rule dynamics @xcite .",
    "in addition , the epidemic dynamics is governed by a compartmental model with 3 classes : susceptibles ( s ) , infected ( i ) and vaccinated ( v ) individuals .",
    "finally , we considered two distinct cases : the vaccine can give temporary or permanent immunity to the individuals .    for both cases , one can describe the model at mean - field level through ordinary differential equations .",
    "first , we analyzed the short - time behavior of the model , and we found that it does not depend on the resusceptibility rate @xmath14 , the probability for which a vaccinated individual becomes susceptible again .",
    "we calculated the effective reproductive number @xmath42 , that is given by @xmath140 .",
    "this expression shows that the occurrence or absence of an epidemic outbreak depends on the infection and recovery probabilities ( @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively ) , as usual , but it also depends on social parameters .",
    "the first one is the initial fraction @xmath6 of pro - vaccine individuals , and the other one is the engagement @xmath10 of those individuals .",
    "thus , the coupling of both dynamics ( opinion and epidemic ) affects directly the disease diffusion in the short time .",
    "based on the expression for @xmath42 , we discussed the range of values of @xmath6 for which different realistic scenarios can occur . in this case , we found evidences that even an initial minority in favor of the vaccination campaign ( @xmath75 ) can stop the disease spreading , since its engagement is sufficiently high ( the power of the initial minority ) .",
    "in addition , for the case where the pro - vaccine individuals are majority in the beginning ( @xmath76 ) , even the outbreak can be avoided , depending on the values of @xmath10 ( the power of the initial majority ) .    on the other hand ,",
    "the long - time behavior of the model depends on @xmath14 . for the cases where the immunity is temporary",
    ", we found all the stationary densities ( s , i and v ) .",
    "based on these results , we verified that the model undergoes phase transitions between disease - free and endemic phases , and the epidemic thresholds are different for the two cases of initial majorities ( @xmath75 and @xmath76 ) .",
    "thus , we found that for @xmath75 the transition does not depends on @xmath14 , which suggests that if the initial majority is against the vaccination process , the engagement does not influence the disease spreading . on the other hand , for @xmath76 the threshold depends explicity on @xmath14 , and we found that for sufficient high engagement the disease can disappear of the population in the long time , even for high infection rates .",
    "we also derived an analytical expression for the threshold value @xmath82 above which there is no endemic phase in the population .",
    "for the cases where the immunity is permanent , we only derived a closed analytical expression for the stationary density of susceptible agents @xmath120 .",
    "the expression for @xmath83 depends on @xmath121 , and we can conclude from that expressions only that there is a phase transition as in the previous case , and that if the initial majority is formed by pro - vaccine individuals ( @xmath76 ) , the disease will disapear after a long time , since the vaccine induces a permanent immunization and more agents become in favor of the vaccination during the evolution of the system due to the social pressure ( majority - rule dynamics ) .",
    "this is a positive effect of the social pressure .",
    "the remaining of the analysis for permanent immunization was done through monte carlo simulations . in this case , we also found distinct epidemic scenarios , with endemic and disease - free phases , and the occurrence or not of outbreaks .",
    "in addition , we verified that if there is initially an overwhelming majority of anti - vaccine agents ( @xmath141 ) , the engagement has no effect on the disease propagation , and we have an endemic phase , which can be interpreted as a negative effect of the social pressure on the disease spreading .",
    "however , even for @xmath75 a sufficient high engagement can lead to the disease extinction in the stationary state , since the initial majority of anti - vaccine individuals is not much larger than the initial minority of pro - vaccince agents .",
    "these results can be seen as a kind of power of the minority in the long - time limit .",
    "all these those results are realistic features of our model .    as discussed in @xcite the variation of the epidemic threshold as a result of immunization has important practical consequences . in our case , for @xmath68 ( temporary immunity ) , one can see in figure [ fig3 ] ( c ) that near the engagement threshold @xmath82 a small effort to increase the engagement of pro - vaccine individuals leads the system to a disease - free phase , or even to the absence of an endemic phase ( i.e. , there is no endemic phase even for @xmath142 ) .",
    "it means that in a given population where the initial majority supports the vaccination campaign ( @xmath76 ) , the focus of the government should be to promote a higher engagement of such initial majority .",
    "this conclusion corroborates the discussion in @xcite , that indicates that in general the better strategy in a vaccination campaign is not to direct `` battle '' with anti - vaccine individuals . on the other hand , for @xmath75 our results suggest that the increase of engagement should not be sufficient to eliminate the disease . in this case",
    ", the more efficient strategy is to change the initial conditions , i.e. , to convincing more floaters prior to the beginning of the public debate , as discussed by galam in @xcite . finally , for @xmath143 ( permanent immunity ) , the galam s strategy @xcite could present evident or neglibible results , depending on the initial fraction of pro - vaccine agents and on their engagement .",
    "summarizing , our results showed that for both analyzed cases ( permanent or temporary immunity ) the social pressure acts either positively and negatively over the epidemic spreading in our sis - like model , depending on the initial density of pro - vaccine individuals .",
    "other works @xcite also discussed that the social pressure acts as a double - edged sword in vaccination campaigns , but in the mentioned works the authors considered sir models and they did not take into account the two vaccination schemes considered here ( permanent or temporary immunity ) .",
    "as extensions of this work , one can simulate the model on complex topologies ( small world , scale free ) in order to analyze the impact of the neighborhood in the dynamics presented here in the fully - connected case .",
    "another interesting extension is to consider more sofisticated dynamics for the opinions changes , taking into account agents heterogeneities ( conviction , for example @xcite ) as well as other interesting models as the nonlinear voter model @xcite and the nonconsensus opinion model @xcite .",
    "the authors acknowledge financial support from the brazilian funding agencies cnpq , capes and faperj .                the steady state of the opinion dynamics is @xmath149 and @xmath150 @xcite , i.e. , all agents are anti - vaccine after a long time . for the epidemic states , the limit @xmath71 for eqs .",
