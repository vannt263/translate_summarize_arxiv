    "the fluid dynamic video illustrates the various interactions between a liquid water drop and a superhydrophobic surface .",
    "as well - known , a water drop will typically rebound from a superhydrophobic surface after impact ( first impact ) , thanks to a special wetting conditions , i.e. the so - called cassie - baxter state .",
    "+ however , if the impact speed reaches a value higher than the critical speed , the drop or a part of it may remains attached to the surface , unable to rebound .",
    "this is due to the wetting transition from the cassie - baxter to the wenzel wetting state ( second impact ) .",
    "both this phenomenon can be observed at room temperature .",
    "+ interesting phenomena , however , can be observed in an environment where the temperature falls below water freezing temperature , i.e. 0@xmath0c . in the third and last impact ,",
    "the environment , the drop and the surface are all at -16@xmath0c .",
    "as common sense would suggest , water should be frozen .",
    "however , ultra - pure liquid water can be kept supercooled without freezing . at -16@xmath0c ,",
    "the water drop is heavily supercooled but still liquid .",
    "interestingly , the supercooled liquid drop initially impacts on the superhydrophobic surface and bounces off , as for the impact case at room temperature .",
    "however , during the post - rebound flight , the drop freezes in mid - air , and re - impacts onto the surface for the second time in the form of an ice crystal , this time unable to rebound ."

    "<S> in this fluid dynamics video we show the trick played by a supercooled liquid water drop against a superhydrophobic surface . the water drop shows a double personality , impacting onto the surface the first time while still in the liquid state , and then re - impacting as a frozen ice crystal . </S>"
