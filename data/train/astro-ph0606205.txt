    "high spatial resolution imagery in recent years have revealed a number of well developed planetary nebulae that exhibit a fragmented appearance of their shells with clumps and radial spokes , as it is the case of the famous helix nebula , ngc 7293 ( vorontsov - velyaminov 1968 ; meaburn et al .",
    "1992 ; odell & handron 1996 ) .",
    "similar examples are the dumbbell nebula , ngc 6853 ( manchado et al.1996 ; meaburn et al",
    ". 2005a ) and ngc 2867 ( corradi et al .",
    "rayleigh - taylor instabilities have been some times invoked as the cause of this fragmentation but with limited success ( burkert & odell 1996 ) .",
    "alternatively , the effects of the ionizing radiation on the nebula have been shown by capriotti ( 1973 ) and also by garca - segura & franco ( 1996 ) and garca - segura et al.(1999 ) to be much more relevant in the fragmentation process of the nebular shell .    recently , meaburn et al .",
    "( 2005b ) have shown that the current kinematics of nebulae such as ngc 7293 can not be explained by the classic `` two - wind model '' ( kwok 1982 ) .",
    "since ngc 7293 shows emission in he  ii  and o  [ iii ]  at very low velocities close to the central star , meaburn et al .",
    "( 2005b ) concluded that only after the fast wind has switched off could this global velocity structure be generated .",
    "the absence of a fast stellar wind in ngc 7293 has been confirmed from observations with the iue satellite ( perinotto 1983 ; cerruti - sola & perinotto 1985 ) that failed to detect p - cygni profiles from their central stars ; likewise in the cases of ngc 6853 and ngc 2867 .",
    "furthermore , the lack of extended , soft x - ray emission from ngc 7293 ( guerrero et al . 2001 ) discards the presence of a `` hot bubble '' and the shocked , fast wind . in general ,",
    "cerruti - sola & perinotto ( 1985 ) found that the hotter the central stars are the least likely to have fast stellar winds , a result indicative of the rapid fading of the stellar wind as the central star evolves .    in this letter we present numerical calculations which show that the decay of the fast stellar winds produces",
    "self - consistently the fragmented structures and kinematics observed in evolved planetary nebulae .",
    "there are several dynamical studies of the evolution of pns that include the effects of stellar evolution .",
    "recently , schnberner et al . (",
    "2005 ) have discussed the stellar evolution path for a @xmath1  post - agb , following the recommendation of pauldrach et al.(1988 ) for the parameters of the central stellar wind . a reimers wind ( reimers 1975 ) is assumed during the short transition region from the agb to the pn domain . in this model",
    "( see figure 1 in schnberner et al.2005 ) , the mass loss rate begins with several @xmath2  for a period of @xmath3 yr , decreasing down to @xmath4  , to finally reach values of @xmath5  after @xmath6 yr ; meanwhile the wind velocity increases from @xmath7 to @xmath6  .",
    "after @xmath6 yr the wind can be considered negligible ( turn - around point ) . as initial condition ,",
    "this calculation assume @xmath8  and @xmath9  for the agb wind .    also , villaver et al .",
    "( 2002a ) have used the paths from vassiliadis & wood ( 1994 ) for @xmath10  , @xmath11  , @xmath12  , @xmath13  , @xmath14  and @xmath15  , corresponding to initial values at the zams of 1 , 1.5 , 2 , 2.5 , 3.5 and 5  respectively .",
    "the vassiliadis & wood s ( 1994 ) models also use the pauldrach et al.(1988 ) theoretical results to compute the mass loss rates and wind velocities from the agb to the pn domain . in these models ( figure 2 in villaver et al .",
    "2002a ) , the fast wind is negligible ( turn - around point ) after @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 years respectively . the second model in villaver et al .",
    "( 2002a ) is almost identical to the model used in schnberner et al .",
    "the initial conditions ( see villaver et al .",
    "2002b ) corresponding to the end of the agb winds are taken from vassiliadis ( 1992 ) , and are in the range of @xmath22  , and @xmath23  .",
    "mellema ( 1994 ) has also used a model for a @xmath24  post - agb from schnberner ( 1983 ) , with similar stellar parameters as discussed above .",
    "given the range of possible parameters to consider in the stellar evolution tracks , stellar masses , mass loss rates and wind velocities , we have adopted in this study the following representative numbers : for the agb winds , we have adopted a @xmath25 , @xmath26 ( model a ) and @xmath27 ( model b ) . for the post - agb wind , @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "these choices give wind momentum ratios of 10 ( model a ) and 1 ( model b ) .",
    "we also have adopted 1,000 yr for the duration of the fast wind .",
    "the numerical experiment presented here ( model b)(garca - segura et al.2006 discusses model a ) includes two phases : in the first phase , a typical two - wind model scenario ( kwok 1982 ) where a fast wind sweeps up a slow wind is considered . for simplicity",
    ", this phase lasts 1,000 yr in the computation , but it could last longer or shorter depending of the particular track of stellar evolution . in the second phase ,",
    "the fast wind is switched off , and the dynamical evolution is computed for a total of 8,000 yr . in both phases",
    "the photoionization is considered following the approach of garca - segura & franco 1996 with a central star that emits @xmath30 ionizing photons .",
    "we have adopted this average value from villaver et al .",
    "( 2002a ) ( see their figure 4 ) , which is maintained for at least @xmath6 yr .",
    "we have not considered in detail the temporal variation of the ionizing photons . however , villaver s models show that the evolution of the nebulae are optically thick during the first few thousand years of the evolution . in this regime , our simple models provide a reasonable description of the location of the ionization front for the mass - loss rates that we have considered .",
    "a simple expanding spherical morphology is adopted for simplicity ( i. e. , no rotation , magnetic field , or anisotropic mass - loss events ) .",
    "the simulations are performed with the hydrodynamical code zeus-3d ( version 3.4 ) ( stone & norman 1992 ; clarke 1996 ) , and details about the set up can be found in garca - segura et al.(1999 ) , and garca - segura et al.(2005 ) for the self - expanding grid technique .",
    "we perform the two - dimensional simulation in spherical polar coordinates ( @xmath31 ) , with reflecting boundary conditions at the equator and the polar axis , and rotational symmetry assumed with respect to the latter .",
    "our grid consist of @xmath32 equidistant zones in @xmath33 and @xmath34 respectively , with a radial extent of 0.1 pc ( initially ) , and an angular extent of @xmath35 .",
    "the innermost radial zone lies at @xmath36pc from the central star .",
    "figures 1 and 2 show mosaics of snapshots of gas densities and photoionized gas densities covering 8,000 yr of the evolution for model b , each one separated by 1,000 yr . the first , top - left panel in figure 1 shows progressively , starting from the origin of the grid , the fast , free expanding wind region , the terminal or reverse shock , the hot , shocked bubble , the swept - up shell with an outer , forward shock , and the slow wind",
    "this is the classical view of a two - wind model .",
    "vishniac ( 1983 ) or thin shell instabilities give the corrugate appearance of the swept - up shell ( see garca - segura & mac low 1995 for further details ) .",
    "the rest of the panels show how the hot shocked bubble collapses after @xmath37 6,000 yr and also show the expansion of the photoionized gas , once that the fast wind is switched off .",
    "the fragmentation of the swept - up shell follows the pattern imposed by the vishniac instability , and its development and growth comes from the ionization - shock front instability ( garca - segura & franco 1996 ) .",
    "figure 3 is a mosaic with snapshots of the radial velocities counterparts of figure 1 and 2 .",
    "the last two panels ( bottom - right ) show the global kinematics of the ionized gas after the collapse of the hot bubble in which it can be clearly appreciated that the gas close to the central star presents very small velocities , reaching practically inert conditions there , as it is found in the helix nebula ( meaburn et al.2005b ) .",
    "notice that these low velocities reach the central star region , and are not only a projection effect along the line of sight , as in models where the low velocity emitting regions are located in the inner edges of the swept - up shells ( e. g. , marten & schnberner 1991 ; perinotto et al .",
    "the gas located at the border of the main nebula , shows larger velocities following the kinematics of a rarefraction wave .",
    "the last panel of figure 3 also shows that the neutral cometary globules immersed in the nebula present smaller velocities than the surrounding photoionized gas that has been accelerated by thermal pressure , while the extended sections of these neutral tails at further distances show larger velocities than the agb wind due to the acceleration by the ionization - shock front .",
    "model b is not shown in this letter , but it is discussed in garca - segura et al .",
    "( 2006 ) where similar results are found .    in the simulations ,",
    "the cometary globules originate in the neutral , swept - up shell of piled up agb wind , and so , they , or part of them must be excited by shocks .",
    "this is consistent with the detection of shock - excited molecular hydrogen in the dumbbell nebula ( see manchado et al .",
    "once that the wind is switched off , the head of the globules are no longer confined in the swept - up shell by the pressure of the wind , and so , they become engulfed in the nebula .",
    "this is a novel result that previous hydrodynamical works had not solved ( see for example garca - segura et al . 1999 ) .",
    "huggins et al.(1992 ) observed that the co cometary globules in the helix nebula show a smaller expansion velocity than the ionized gas , which is in line with our computations .",
    "however , the present numerical simulations are two - dimensional , and the limited resolution does not allow a quantitative analysis of the structures that are formed .",
    "thus , quantitative details about velocities of the globules , number , sizes and masses , as well as the spoke - like pattern and its spatial frequency developed in the simulations are beyond the scope of this letter .",
    "however , the qualitative resemblance with cases like the helix and the dumbbell nebulae is remarkable and encouraging .",
    "note for example , the cometary globules that develop in figure 2 , bottom - right , with bright photoionized heads , like the ones observed in the helix ( see also figure 16 in odell et al .",
    "2004 ) , and also the resemblance with the molecular , shock - exited long tails extending further out in the dumbbell ( manchado et al.2006 ) .    in this study",
    ", we have switched off the fast wind after the first 1000 years of evolution and followed the subsequent development finding for the first time a consistent representation of the fractured morphology and kinematic pattern often observed in planetary nebulae .",
    "the stellar wind is likely not to die - off as abruptly as in our simulations , although massive central stars evolve fast ( e.g. see fig 3 in villaver et al .",
    "2002 ) and the behavior computed here should be a good approximation for those cases , as in the helix nebula where the estimated central star mass is 0.93  ( grny et al . 1997 ) . for the case of the evolution of low mass central stars , those are expected to take place in much longer times than the dilution of their surrounding nebulae . if this is the case , there should be a direct correlation between the fragmentation of a planetary nebula with the mass of the central star , and an anticorrelation with the detection of extended soft x - rays .",
    "additional numerical simulations at higher resolution , taking detailed account of the time dependent stellar evolution effects will allow a quantitative analysis of the shell structure as a result of the termination of the fast wind .",
    "such calculations will be the subject of a future paper .",
