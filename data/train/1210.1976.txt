    "data from the atlas and cms collaborations  @xcite provide an essentially @xmath9 signal for a higgs - like resonance , @xmath10 , with mass of order @xmath5",
    ". meanwhile , the cdf and d0 experiments have announced new results @xcite , based mainly on @xmath11 associated production with @xmath3 , that support the @xmath12 higgs - like signal .",
    "while it is certainly possible that the observed signals in the various production / decay channels will converge towards their respective standard model ( sm ) values , the current central values for the signal strengths in individual channels deviate by about 12@xmath13 from predictions for the @xmath14 .",
    "one of the most significant deviations in the current data is the enhancement in the @xmath6 final state for both gluon fusion ( @xmath15 ) and vector boson fusion ( vbf ) production .",
    "such a result is not atypical of models with multiple higgs bosons in which the @xmath16 partial width of the observed @xmath10 is reduced through mixing with a second ( not yet observed at the lhc ) higgs boson , @xmath17 , thereby enhancing the @xmath6 branching ratio of the @xmath10  @xcite . in such models ,",
    "a particularly interesting question is whether one could simultaneously explain the lhc signal and the small ( @xmath18 ) lep excess in @xmath19 in the vicinity of @xmath20 @xcite using the @xmath17 with @xmath21 .",
    "we recall that the lep excess is clearly inconsistent with a sm - like higgs boson at this mass , being only about @xmath22 of the rate predicted for the @xmath14 .",
    "consistency with such a result for the @xmath17 is natural if the @xmath17 couples at a reduced level to @xmath23 , which , in turn , is automatic if the @xmath10 has substantial @xmath23 coupling , as required by the observed lhc signals .    in this paper",
    "we demonstrate that the two lightest cp - even higgs bosons  , @xmath0 and @xmath4 , of the next - to - minimal supersymmetric model ( nmssm ) could have properties such that the @xmath0 fits the lep excess at @xmath1 while the @xmath4 is reasonably consistent with the higgs - like lhc signals at @xmath12 , including in particular the larger - than - sm signal in the @xmath6 channel .",
    "the nmssm  @xcite is very attractive since it solves the @xmath24 problem of the minimal supersymmetric extension of the sm ( mssm ) : the ad hoc parameter @xmath24 appearing in the mssm superpotential term @xmath25 is generated in the nmssm from the @xmath26 superpotential term when the scalar component @xmath27 of @xmath28 develops a vev @xmath29 : @xmath30 .",
    "the three cp - even higgs fields , contained in @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath27 , mix and yield the mass eigenstates @xmath0 , @xmath4 and @xmath33 .",
    "a @xmath5 higgs state with enhanced @xmath6 signal rate is easily obtained for large @xmath34 and small @xmath35  @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . to describe the lep and lhc data the @xmath0 and @xmath4 must have @xmath36 and @xmath37 , respectively , with the @xmath0 being largely singlet and the @xmath4 being primarily doublet ( mainly @xmath31 for the scenarios we consider ) .",
    "in addition to the cp - even states , there are also two cp - odd states , @xmath38 and @xmath39 , and a charged higgs boson , @xmath40 .",
    "verification of the presence of the three cp - even higgs bosons and/or two cp - odd higgs bosons would establish a higgs field structure that goes beyond the two - doublet structure of the mssm .",
    "the main production / decay channels relevant for current lhc data are gluon fusion ( @xmath15 ) and vector boson fusion ( vbf ) with higgs decay to @xmath6 or @xmath41 .",
    "the lhc also probes @xmath42higgs with higgs decay to @xmath16 , a channel for which tevatron data is relevant , and @xmath43higgs with higgs@xmath44 .",
    "we compute the ratio of the @xmath15 or vbf induced higgs cross section times the higgs branching ratio to a given final state @xmath45 , relative to the corresponding value for the sm higgs boson , as r^h_i_gg(x ) , r^h_i_vbf(x ) , where @xmath46 is the @xmath47 nmssm scalar higgs , and @xmath14 is the sm higgs boson , taking @xmath48 . in the context of any two - higgs - doublet plus singlets model ,",
    "not all the @xmath49 are independent .",
    "for example , @xmath50 , @xmath51  ; however , these are small in our scenarios all of which have small to moderate @xmath35 values . ] and @xmath52 .",

    "specifically , we use points from scans performed using nmssmtools3.2.0  @xcite , which includes the scans of  @xcite supplemented by additional runs following the same procedure as well as specialized mcmc chain runs designed to focus on parameter regions of particular interest .",
    "all the accepted points correspond to scenarios that obey all experimental constraints ( mass limits and flavor constraints as implemented in nmssmtools , @xmath64 and 2011 xenon100 constraints on the spin - independent scattering cross section ) except that the susy contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon , @xmath65 , is too small to explain the discrepancy between the observed value of @xmath66  @xcite and that predicted by the sm . for a full discussion of the kind of nmssm model employed",
