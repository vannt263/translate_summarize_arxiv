    "in an earlier paper @xcite we considered the relationship between h i column density n(h i ) derived from the large - scale 21 cm h i sky surveys @xcite , and reddening  as derived from far ir dust emission by @xcite ( sfd98 ) .",
    "we traced n(h i ) and   around the sky at galactic latitudes @xmath11 and considered data at lower column densities @xmath12 mag , where the hydrogen should be in the form of neutral atoms and corrections to n(h i ) for saturation and @xmath8-formation are unimportant .",
    "we showed that the relevant value of the gas / reddening ratio is n(h i)/  @xmath3 mag@xmath4 , considerably larger than the usually - cited ratio n(h)/  @xmath13 mag@xmath4 derived from optical / uv absorption measurements toward stars by @xcite , where n(h ) = n(h i ) + 2n(@xmath8 ) .",
    "it is also larger than the values n(h",
    "i)/  @xmath14 mag@xmath4 that are consistently quoted for stellar reddening and  absorption toward early - type stars @xcite .",
    "in fact there are two mysteries in the disparity between radio / ir and optical / uv derivations of n(h)/. the first is the numerical discrepancy , which puts several 21 cm surveys and the work of sfd98 together on one side in opposition to   measurements by several groups using iue and copernicus and stellar reddening on the other .",
    "the second is the very nearly constant value for n(h i)/  quoted for the stellar data , as opposed to the radio - ir relationship shown in figure 1 of @xcite that had a very strong point of inflection to smaller n(h i)/   at  @xmath6 0.08 mag . in principle",
    "the inflection in the radio data could reflect either the influence of saturation of the 21 cm line profiles or the expected onset of @xmath8  formation as originally discovered in the uv absorption data @xcite .",
    "we noted a seemingly similar inflection in the iue results of @xcite , whereby much higher values of n(h i)/  were seen at @xmath15 mag ( their fig .",
    "4a ) , but this was not taken into account in their final result .",
    "it should also have been present in the earlier treatment of the iue results by @xcite , who derived very nearly the same numerical result as in the later work .",
    "this work is largely concerned with understanding the change in slope of the radio - ir defined n(h i)-  relationship , unravelling the possibly competing effects of 21 cm h i line saturation and @xmath8-formation . in section 2",
    "we discuss independent measures of 21 cm h i optical depth as a function of reddening , which can be employed to show that saturation corrections to 21 cm measurements of n(h i ) are small at least until @xmath16 0.3 mag . in that case",
    ", only @xmath8-formation can explain the observed inflection . in sect .",
    "3 we show that rather conventional models of @xmath8  formation in a low density diffuse molecular gas can reproduce the observed n(h i)-  relationship . in section 4",
    "we extend our analysis to lower galactic latitude  = 9- 20and show that that there are progressively higher values of n(h i)/  at all as  declines .",
    "section 5 is a brief summary and discussion .",
    "figure 1 shows an updated and annotated version of the n(h i)-  relationship first shown in @xcite , again using h i profiles from the lab ( leiden - argentina - bonn ) all - sky h i survey @xcite and  from the work of sfd98 . explaining the annotations and the rather modest saturation correction to n(h i ) that has been applied to the data is the subject of the current work . in passing ,",
    "please note that figure 1 of @xcite inadvertently displayed the data for only that half the sky at 0  @xmath17 , without affecting the numerical results .",
    "note also that the phenomenon of gas without dust , which manifests itself as high ratios of n(h i)/  at small , is not clearly present down to reddenings as small as 0.01 mag . also missing at small values of  is a downturn in n(h i ) that could have signalled the presence of in increasing fracion of warm ionized gas .      to understand the possible effects of saturation we began by binning the data in reddening ( averaging over all the data comprising fig . 1 ) and",
    "forming mean h i emission profiles as a function of reddening .",
    "figure 2 shows some of these for 0.025 mag @xmath18 mag and it is clear that imputing high optical depth to the profiles around  = 0.1 mag would require spin temperatures below 30 k for which there is no support in such diffuse gas .        the argument for modest optical depths",
    "may be made quantitative by considering the variation of measured 21 cm optical depth  = @xmath19 ( units of ) with reddening first discussed by @xcite using a combination of their own more recent vla data and that measured earlier by @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that there is a strong , nearly - linear relationship between  and  but with scant data at higher galactic latitude and with much scatter and sparse data - coverage at @xmath20 0.3 mag .",
    "this situation is alleviated by inclusion of the new results of @xcite as shown in fig .",
    "3 .    the error - weighted regression line in fig . 3",

    "the ratio /  changes by only 45% over the range 0.02 @xmath22 mag .",
    "h i absorption ( hence the presence of the cold neutral medium ) is not consistently detected below  = 0.02 mag .",
    "this was noted by @xcite who described the lack of h i absorption for n(h i ) @xmath23 .",
    "this implies a ratio n(h i)/  @xmath24 mag@xmath4 in keeping with the values found in our work but a more quantitative estimate can be derived from the table of  and optical - depth corrected n(h i ) of @xcite , from which it is found that @xmath20n(h i)/@xmath25 mag@xmath4 .",
    "note that fig .",

    "1 it may be inferred that there is a variation in the mean spin temperature with increasing , actually a decline leading to a saturation correction that increases with  as expected .    we began by deriving mean  values from binned h i profiles ( fig .",
    "2 ) across the range of , assuming the power - law -  relationship shown in fig .",
    "3 : these mean  are shown in the upper panel of fig .",
    "then we fit a smooth function to the variation of  with  and applied that to all h i profiles individually to correct them for the optical depth implied by their known reddening .",
    "this process is self - consistent in reproducing the power - law -  relationship when applied to the data at large .",
    "the power - law -  relation breaks down at  @xmath20 0.02 mag , n(h i ) @xmath23 , leading to an underestimation of the mean , but no correction for saturation is needed at such small n(h i ) anyway .",
    "fig . 4 at bottom shows the derived saturation correction as a multiplicative correction to the values of n(h i ) derived from the mean h i profiles in the limit of zero optical depth , n(h i ) @xmath26 with the integral expressed in units of k- .",
    "note that the  variation and the corrections shown are relevant only to the data that was considered .",
    "a different dataset might require a different variation of  with  ( see section 4 below ) and the magnitude of the correction that must be applied depends not only on but on the h i profile itself .",
    "when the profile integral is very small , even very small  do not result in a significant correction to the optically thin value of n(h i ) .",
    "as well , the derived  at a given  might be very different for different datasets without implying significantly different correction factors at that .",
    "the point is that  @xmath27 n(h i)/  by definition but n(h i ) depends on  only when the optical depth is high .    in any case , the correction factor relevant to the dataset shown in fig .",
    "1 is below 20% for  @xmath20 0.5 mag . in @xcite",
    "we used a constant  = 145 k but the important ramifications of the data are the same .",
    "there is no appreciable correction to n(h i ) at small , leading to a reliable value for n(h i)/. the correction for saturation is not responsible for the inflection in the plot of n(h i)/ , which must be ascribed to the onset of @xmath8-formation .    the relevance and accuracy of using a so - called isothermal correction to n(h i ) given the optical depth absorption profile has recently been examined by @xcite , who derive correction factors comparable to ours .",
    "the correction is described as isothermal because a single  is applied at each velocity to emission that is a blend of contributions from different gas phases .",
    "the correction does an excellent job of bounding even very large errors in n(h i ) that may occur at  = 1 - 10   when the optical depth is unknown .",
    "the method adopted here is broader because we use an implied optical depth integral  to derive a single value of across an entire line profile but the conclusions are the same .",
    "the empirical correction factors derived in sect . 2 were applied to the data in fig . 1 but a significant gap remains at @xmath6 0.1 mag between the observed , corrected n(h i ) and the straight line n(h i)/  @xmath3 mag@xmath4 that is applicable below  = 0.08 mag where @xmath8-formation does not occur @xcite .",
    "that is also the line of zero molecular fraction , and superposed on the data are ( dashed ) lines of constant molecular hydrogen fraction 2  = 1-n(h i)/n(h ) , indicating very high molecular fractions at high .",
    "also shown in fig .",
    "1 are the results of a model calculation of @xmath8-formation in a diffuse gas at low density n(h ) = 14@xmath28 .",
    "these are the same equilibrium heating / cooling/@xmath8-formation models we have used earlier in for instance @xcite to illustrate @xmath8  and co formation , but now with the remainder h i shown on the vertical axis .",
    "also , the models were calculated using the newly inferred value n(h)/  @xmath3 mag@xmath4 that provides less dust shielding and extinction at a given n(h ) .",
    "each leaf of the plot is for a separate cloud model having a central hydrogen column density n(h ) differing by a factor 2@xmath29 from its neighbors and the variation along each leaf represents the locus of column density seen at all impact parameters across the face of the model .",
    "the right - most points along each leaf correspond to sightlines passing closer to the center of the model and so would be observed with smaller probability in real observations .    in any case , the point is to demonstrate that although there seems to be little alternative to @xmath8-formation , that explanation also works in practice .",
    "1 shows that the data at latitudes at  @xmath5 20  fit together into a coherent whole with a single message about n(h i)/  over the galaxy and over a wide range of .",
    "this is not true of the sky at smaller , as will be discussed now .",
    "figure 5 at left shows the latitude variation of the mean reddening averaged around the sky .",
    "below about 15  much of the sky is well - described by the cosecant law expected for a plane - parallel stratified medium . at higher latitudes the latitude dependence progressively steepens with , finally , a cubic dependence ( actually , power - law -3.1 ) for  @xmath16 36 . given these gradients we worried that the larger h i beamsize of the lab survey might have artificially increased the values we derived for n(h i)/. the disparity in beamsizes ( 36  vs 6 ) would merely introduce scatter for a uniform sky , but the larger h i beam has a slightly lower intensity - weighted mean  when viewing a medium that is concentrated to the galactic equator .    numerical integration over the h i beam using the gradients shown in fig .",
    "5 suggested that the effect would not be important but as a test we recalculated our results comparing n(h i ) with  measured 9  and 18  closer to the galactic equator ( ie 50% and 100% of the radius of the h i beam ) .",
    "we found only that the mean n(h i)/  declined progressively below  = 8 , by a maximum of 5% at  = 4 .",
    "the vertical sky gradient should not have affected any of the conclusions drawn in this work .    at the right in figure 5",

    "when  from sfd98 is compared with 21 cm h i column densities at 0.015 @xmath20  @xmath20 0.075 mag where @xmath8-formation should be negligible , the stable ratio n(h i)/  = @xmath32 mag@xmath4 derived at  @xmath5 20   substantially exceeds the seemingly universal value n(h",

    "when such a transformation is used to rederive the present results , we find a high - latitude asymptote n(h i)/  @xmath36 mag@xmath4 , accounting for about half the effect noted , in the log sense .",
