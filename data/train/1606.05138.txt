    "they showed that for a fixed mass range , observed field galaxies are more likely to host less luminous agns .",
    "the probability that a field galaxy hosts an agn decreases with increasing agn luminosity .",
    "we adopt shen 2009 model for the hierarchical growth and evolution of smbhs assuming that agn activity is triggered in major mergers .",
    "this model uses a general form of light curve where bh first grows exponentially at constant luminosity eddington ratio of @xmath60=3 ( salpeter 1964 ) to l@xmath61 at t = t@xmath61 , and then the luminosity decays monotonically as a power - law ( yu @xmath5 lu 2008 ) .",

    "the input parameters for the shen 2009 model are m@xmath34 ( mass of the bh entering agn phase ) , l@xmath61 ( peak bolometric agn luminosity ) , and m@xmath62 ( bh mass in the postmerger halo m@xmath63 immediately after the agn phase ) . to match our nomenclature ,",
    "we have renamed m@xmath62 to m@xmath49 .    in our model ,",
    "values for the first parameter come from the numerical simulation combined with the semi - analytical modelling ( details in section 2.4 ) .",
    "we calculate m@xmath49 ( details in section 2.6 ) from m@xmath22 - @xmath50 relation ( kormendy @xmath5 ho 2013 ) where @xmath50 is the velocity dispersion of the stellar spheroid .",
    "@xmath50 is correlated with v@xmath30 by a constant ( ferrarese 2002 ) .",
    "we set this constant to a value which reproduces z = 0 ferrarese 2002 m@xmath22 - m@xmath23 relation .",
    "since m@xmath22 - @xmath64 relation is expected to be non - evolving , one can find m@xmath22 in m@xmath63 at any redshift .",
    "the outcome of this procedure is that the bh mass in high redshift halos , right after agn phase , is overestimated .",
    "this is expected to occur as bh grows first , followed by postmerger halo growth through minor mergers and diffuse matter accretion .",
    "as we go toward lower redshifts , dmh growth catches up to smbh growth to reproduce local ferrarese relation ( figure 6 ) .",
    "hence , we consider m@xmath49 to be the `` true '' final bh mass .",
    "l@xmath61 is the peak bolometric luminosity ( details in section 2.7 ) in the shen 2009 light curve model , set to the value which guarantees that the accretion onto m@xmath34 produces m@xmath49 .",
    "this is our ( l@xmath65 ) best fit model which reproduces the observed agn activity , luminosity function , duty cycle and bias factor .    after we demonstrate that our merger driven model reproduces observed agn statistics , we test if the observed agn activity in cosmos survey corresponds to the peak or to the declining activity .",
    "now , instead of l@xmath65 , values for the peak luminosity ( l@xmath45 ) are retrieved from the probability for a galaxy to host an agn of a given luminosity ( p(l@xmath15 ) ) in cosmos survey ( details in section 2.8 ) .",
    "we use this probability to seed galaxies with agns in 40,000 monte carlo realisations and grow smbhs according to shen 2009 model ( details in section 2.9 ) .",
    "the result is the probability that smbhs grown in cosmos agns match the true smbhs grown in our best fit model .",
    "we start by identifying major merger events in the merger trees of our cosmological n - body simulation .",
    "we define masses of merging halos as m@xmath17 and m@xmath18 at the time of the merger z@xmath16 ( figure 1 ) .",
    "we also check if merging halos had major mergers previously .",
    "dmh without previous major merger is an ancient halo hosting disk / spiral galaxy with a large cold gas reservoir and the central bh that most likely formed through direct collapse of a gas cloud ( bromm @xmath5 loeb 2003 , begelman , volonteri @xmath5 rees 2006 , begelman , rossi @xmath5 armitage 2008 ) .",
    "latest observations ( mortlock et al . 2011 ) showed that bh seeds had to be massive ( @xmath4 10@xmath20 - 10@xmath21@xmath1 ) in order to grow @xmath4 10@xmath66 bhs at redshift z @xmath4 7 .    the initial mass function ( imf ) and the mass range of the seed bhs are unknown .",
    "these bhs settle at the centres of disk / spiral galaxies but their masses do not correlate with any of the galaxy properties .",
    "growth of these initial bhs through accretion can occur even before they form a binary ( bhb ) , during the early stages of the galaxy merger as galaxies go through subsequent pericentric passages ( capelo et al .",
    "2015 ) . as the major merger of galaxies proceeds , gravitational torques generate large - scale gas inflows that drive the gas down to sub - pc scale where it can be accreted by the bh .",
    "hence , bhs grow in a modest amount even before they form a binary ( pre - bhb accretion ) .",
    "modelling of this growth is a subject of numerous numerical studies . however , limited resolution and disparate subgrid physics recipes led to a very different estimates of the bh accretion rates .",
    "latest results ( hayward et al . 2014 , capelo et al . 2015 ) show that bh accretes at the rate 10@xmath67 - 10@xmath68 for @xmath4 1 gyr before agn phase .",
    "after bh binary forms , accretion increases as bhs sink to overcome the last couple of kiloparsecs between them . during these",

    "this would mean that 10@xmath69 bh accretes at rate of 0.1 @xmath70 , while 10@xmath71 bh accretes at the rate of 1 @xmath70 ( over 100 myr ) .",
    "this `` bhb accretion '' phase finishes with bh binary coalescence into a new bh which enters an agn phase .",
    "unknown imf for bh seeds , and rate of `` pre - bhb accretion '' are the main sources of uncertainty in our modelling .",
    "we overcome this issue by considering two models with the idea of constraining lower and upper end of possible initial bh mass .",

    "next we ran 40,000 monte carlo realisations in each @xmath93-@xmath94 interval where we draw from the observed probability functions and we assign luminosities to the initial bh .",
    "we obtain 40,000 predicted bh masses which we compare to the `` true '' final bh mass .",
    "when m@xmath115 @xmath19 m@xmath47 , cosmos agn luminosity is the peak agn luminosity , corresponding to the peak agn luminosity in our best fit model .",
    "we calculate the percentage of realisations where m@xmath115 is at least as large as m@xmath47 .",
    "large percentage implies large probability for agns to be at their peak activity .",
    "small percentage means that agns are not observed at the peak but in the declining phase of their nuclear activity . in this manner",
    ", we distinguish `` peak '' agns ( recently merger triggered and hosted by star forming galaxies , green valley ) and `` faded '' agns ( merger triggered a long time ago and now residing in quiescent galaxies , red sequence ) .    at low redshift range ( z=[0.3 , 0.8 ] )",
    "all observed agns are in the declining phase of their nuclear activity , fading away ( figure 9 ) .",
    "the probability for being at their peak activity is @xmath3 10 @xmath9 for @xmath2 90 @xmath9 of agns in the most massive galaxies .",
    "agn luminosity would have to be very large to account for the smbh growth .",
    "but even if this highest possible luminosity was large enough to produce final smbh , it is also the least probable one .",
    "since the entire range of luminosities can not produce final smbh , then these luminosities do not correspond to the agn peak activity .",
    "the time of maximum nuclear activity when most of the mass was accreted has occurred in the past at higher eddington ratio when agn luminosity was larger and when agn was most likely hosted by star - forming galaxy ( green valley ) .",
    "logical conclusion is that the observed luminosities belong to the agn in the declining phase of its nuclear activity which places this particular agn in the quiescent galaxy ( red sequence ) .",
    "theoretical modelling of agn populations in hosts of various morphologies , mass ranges and redshifts , support the merger driven scenario for luminous agn activity . at the same time observations",
    "are split between existence of merger features ( schawinski et al .",
    "2010 , smirnova , moiseev @xmath5 afanasiev 2010 , koss et al .",
    "2010 , cotini et al . 2013 ) and the lack of them ( gabor et al .",
    "2009 , darg et al .",
    "2010 , cisternas et al .",
    "2011 , kocevski et al .",
    "2012 , villforth et al .",
    "villforth et al .",
    "2014 found no increase in the prevalence of merger signatures with agn luminosity ( in the redshift range z = [ 0.5 , 0.8 ] ) and concluded that major mergers either play only a very minor role in the triggering of agn in the luminosity range studied ( log l@xmath15 = [ 41 , 44.5 ] ) or time delays are too long for merger features to remain visible .",
    "our model shows that the merger driven scenario is still consistent with the observations even though there are no merger features in massive galaxies hosting low redshift agns and almost all of the agn hosts are quiescent galaxies .",
    "how can mergers explain agn activity in massive galaxies which have no merger features and no star formation to indicate recent galaxy merger ?",
    "since at z = [ 0.3 , 0.8 ] ( figure 9 ) the observed luminosities can not correspond to agns at their peak activity ( can not produce final smbh mass in the simulation ) , then they must be observed much later in their evolution long after the merger features can be detected . and our confirmation of bongiorno et al . 2012 results that almost all low redshift agns are in quiescent galaxies is a simple consequence of the drop in galaxy merger rates at z @xmath3 1 .",
    "since galaxy merger rates fall dramatically at low redshift , there are very few recently activated agns which would be hosted by star forming galaxies .",
    "so most of the observed agns are the fading agns activated in the old mergers which occurred at higher redshifts",
    ". since there are no new galaxy mergers , almost all observed agns are in non - star - forming galaxies .",
    "as we go toward higher redshifts , the probability for the agns being at their peak activity increases .",
    "there are more agns in star - forming green valley galaxies . at z=[1.5 , 2.5 ]",
    "the percentage of agns in star forming galaxies is comparable to the percentage of agns in quiescent galaxies .",
    "this can be seen in our figure 9 , bottom panels , and in figure 18 of bongiorno et al .",
    "2012 . again",
    ", this is a simple consequence of the large merger rate in galaxies at high redshift .",
    "the explanation for comparable number of star forming and quiescent agn hosts is that agns in star forming galaxies at high redshift have `` just '' been triggered by galaxy mergers while agns in quiescent galaxies at the same redshift have been merger triggered at some time in the past .",
    "schawinski et al .",
    "2014 had proposed a split of green valley transition into two paths .",
    "current understanding is that late type galaxies transition slowly from blue cloud to red sequence , while hosting low to intermediate luminosity agns driven by secular processes .",
    "early type galaxies transition fast , while hosting high luminosity agns driven by major mergers . in the context of galaxy evolution",
    ", our model addresses the evolution of early type galaxies which are produced in major mergers of gas - rich disk / spirals .",
    "these galaxies correspond to the massive , red galaxies in cosmos survey ( bongiorno et al . 2012 ) where they represent the majority of agn hosting galaxies . according to our model ,",
    "agns in massive galaxies of the cosmos survey , belong to the rapid transition channel ( schawinski et al .",
    "we find that , right after the merger , agns reach their peak activity ( green valley phase ) .",
    "this is a short phase ( @xmath4 100 myr ) during which star formation is quenched .",
    "then , galaxies enter red sequence phase with agns in the decline ( or at the end ) of their nuclear activity and low eddington accretion rate observed in cosmos survey .",
    "figure 2 shows that we are sampling the growth of smbhs @xmath2 10@xmath121 .",
    "for the most part , final smbhs are @xmath2 10@xmath122 .",
    "this is consistent with hopkins , kocevski @xmath5 bundy 2014 conclusion that at these masses merger driven agn activity dominates .",
    "there are a number of recent papers discussing possible biases in the local scaling relations of bhs and galaxies ( reines @xmath5 volonteri 2015 , van den bosch et al .",
    "2015 , shankar et al .",
    "2016 , greene et al .",
    "2016 , van den bosch 2016 ) . in support of this",
    ", we find that when @xmath50 is determined via v@xmath30 , the resulting m@xmath22 - m@xmath0 relation of figure 7 is very broad and even significantly below the kormendy @xmath5 ho 2013 relation .",
    "shankar et al .",
    "2016 found that the normalisation of the m@xmath22 - @xmath64 relation might be decreased by a factor of 3 .",
    "revising m@xmath22 - @xmath64 relation in our best fit model leads to smaller final bh masses .",
    "this in turn decreases bh mass functions and agn luminosity functions by a similar factor but still consistent with the observations .",
    "we have tested how this fact would influence our results and we found that the probability functions in figure 9 would shift toward higher probabilities but would not qualitatively change our results .    we conclude that merger driven scenario for agn activity is consistent with the observations and that the occupation fractions of the observed agns simply follow the evolution of galaxy merger rates .",
    "our model reproduces the observed trend that quiescent ( red sequence ) galaxies host almost all agns at low redshift due to the dramatic drop in galaxy merger rates at z @xmath3 1 .",
    "there are just few recently activated agns in star forming galaxies . instead",
    ", most agns are in their declining nuclear activity hosted by quiescent galaxies . as we go toward higher redshift ( z @xmath2 1 ) , galaxy merger rates increase , and there are more peak activity agns observed in star forming galaxies .",
    "the percentage of peak agns inhabiting star forming and the percentage of faded agns hosted by quiescent galaxies becomes comparable .",
    "we also confirm the observed trend with increasing galaxy mass . at larger galaxy masses",
    "there are more agns in quiescent galaxies",
    ".    our method for matching simulated dmh merger events with observations of field agns will be more accurate as the statistics improves with the future surveys . at this point ,",
    "limited statistics of the sample prevents more detailed investigations of the incidence of agn in galaxies as a function of redshift , stellar mass , star - formation rate and nuclear luminosity ( bongiorno et al .",
    "wide area surveys will be necessary to probe volumes at z @xmath2 1 comparable to that explored by sdss . at the low end of the galaxy mass distribution log [ 10.4 , 10.7 ] @xmath1 , and high redshift [ 1.5 , 2.5 ] , the probability functions in bongiorno et al .",
    "2012 do not have agns with log l@xmath15 [ erg / s ] @xmath11 44 .",
    "most likely missed in cosmos survey , since there are agns in this luminosity and galaxy mass range at lower redshifts . including lower luminosities would change probability functions in figure 14 of bongiorno et al .",
    "2012 , and would most likely shift agn occupation fractions toward lower probabilities .    even though we enforce criterion on agn hosts to be @xmath2 10@xmath123 in stellar mass , we must have some mixing of populations .",
    "we expect that a large majority of agns in these galaxies are merger driven .",
    "however , some percentage of agns is probably driven by secular processes .",
    "that being said , we would like to point out that we are not trying to show that mergers are definitely responsible for agn activity .",
    "we are arguing that observed agn activity ( at least in @xmath2 10@xmath123 galaxies ) is consistent with mergers as drivers .",
    "however , this does not exclude other mechanisms .",
    "in fact , one could imagine a scenario where all of the moderate to faint agns are secularly driven .",
    "two major concerns for our method are : precision in determining the mass of the agn host galaxy in observations , and detecting low luminosity agns .",
    "both concerns impact the relations between mass of the host galaxy and probability functions for agn incidence .",
