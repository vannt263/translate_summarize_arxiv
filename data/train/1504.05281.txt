    "previous works based on the cstar data have corrected some systematic effects and found many variable stars @xcite . in this paper",

    "section 7 concludes our work .",
    "cstar is the first antarctic telescope array designed and constructed by china .",
    "it contains four schmidt - cassegrain telescopes .",
    "each cstar telescope has a pupil entrance aperture of @xmath9 with a focal ratio of @xmath10 .",
    "the small aperture allows cstar to cover a large field of view of @xmath11 .",
    "each focal plane has a @xmath12 frame - transfer ccd with a pixel size of @xmath13 , giving a plate scale of @xmath14 .",
    "three of the cstar telescopes have fixed filters : @xmath15 , and @xmath16 , similar to those used by the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) .",
    "their effective wavelengths are @xmath17 , and @xmath18 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* table  1 ) .",
    "the fourth telescope has no filter .",
    "all the telescopes are fixed pointing at the direction near the celestial south pole .",
    "therefore , stars travel circularly in the fov .",
    "after tested at xinglong observatory in september 2007 , cstar was shipped to antarctica and commissioned at dome a in january 2008 .",
    "cstar has no mechanical shutter to minimize the risk .",
    "the exposure time was @xmath19 s before 2008 april 4 and @xmath20 s thereafter .",
    "no useful data in the g , r , and open bands were obtained because of intermittent problems with the cstar computers and hard disks @xcite .",
    "fortunately one telescope with @xmath16-band filter worked well from 2008 - 03 - 20 to 2008 - 07 - 29 . in polar nights observations were continuous for twenty - four hours .",
    "when the solar elevation angle gradually increased , observation error increased and decreased diurnally .",
    "technical problems resulted in two gaps in the observations , of 10 days and 15 days .",
    "finally more than @xmath21 images were taken with a total integration time of @xmath22 hours in 2008 @xcite .",
    "preliminary image processing and photometry include bias subtraction , flat - field , and fringe correction @xcite .",
    "dark current is negligible under low temperature conditions . due to the continuous , shutterless observation mode ,",
    "there are no real - time bias or daily flat field frames .",
    "they were created by using the images obtained during the four test - observation nights in xinglong observatory from september @xmath23 to @xmath24 , 2007 .",
    "the variations of flat - field are more complicated due to different observation sky areas and the lower temperature of antarctica .",
    "fortunately , it can be corrected by using all of the circular traces of the stars(see * ? ? ?",
    "the usno - b1.0 catalog @xcite contains well - calibrated magnitudes of the point sources in the observed field of cstar .",
    "@xcite have derived a transformation from usno - b1.0 magnitudes to sdss magnitudes .",
    "because filters of cstar are similar to those of sdss , usno - b1.0 catalog can be used to determine the photometric calibration directly .",
    "time calibration was taken by using the position of each star as a clock",
    ". corrected julian date ( jd ) at the mid - exposure point of every image was presented in each catalog .",
    "the accuracy can reach several seconds @xcite .",
    "@xcite correct the inhomogeneous effect of cloud on cstar photometry , including the high cirrus and the fog near the ground surface .",
    "@xcite correct the ghost images , which is caused by the schmidt - cassegrain optical structure .",
    "as cstar was fixed pointing to the celestial south pole , daily stellar movements in ccd will cause diurnal variation for each light curve due to the ccd unevenness .",
    "it has been removed by @xcite .",
    "after these corrections , the photometric precision can reach about 4 mmag at i=7.5 and 20 mmag at i=12 @xcite .",
    "about 20,000 sources down to 16 mag were detected .",
    "the revised cstar catalog and data of 2008 are available at http://explore.china-vo.org .",
    "the following work is based on the detrended light curves after these corrections .",
    "eclipsing binaries are not easy to be distinguished from other kinds of variables .",
    "therefore it is necessary to automatically search variables at first and then manually select out eclipsing binaries from the variables .",
    "however , false positives caused by contaminating stars and the observation mode of csta may appear variable signature .",
    "they should be removed from the variable candidates before confirming eclipsing binaries . in this section ,",
    "we describe the design of the eclipsing binary catalog .      in the first step ,",
    "periodic signals are extracted from each light curve .",
    "a bin size of five minutes has been adopted to filter out extremely high frequency noises because cstar has a very short cadence .",
    "periodic signals are recognized using three methods : lomb - scargle @xcite , phase dispersion minimization ( pdm ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and box least squares ( bls ; * ? ? ?",
    "we set the range of period scan from 0.1 to 30 days for pdm and bls method . while for lomb - scargle method the lower limit is increased to 1.05 day .",
    "for each light curve , we calculate its lomb - scargle signal - to - noise ratio r , pdm statistic @xmath25 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* equation ( 3 ) ) , and signal detection efficiency _ sde _",
    "( see * ? ? ?",
    "* equation ( 6 ) ) .",
    "a false alarm probability of @xmath26 is assigned to lomb - scargle method to get the power threshold @xmath27 .",
    "we set @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the power of the highest peak in the lomb - scargle periodogram .",
    "higher r value indicates more significant periodic signal .",
    "@xmath25 is between 0 and 1 .",
    "lower @xmath25 value indicates more significant periodic signal .",
    "_ sde _ can reflect the effective signal - to - noise ratio of eclipses .",
    "it has been discussed detailedly by @xcite .",
    "we choose the criteria @xmath30 where the subscript `` c '' represents `` criteria '' .",
    "lomb - scargle , pdm , and bls methods contribute 225 , 107 , and 244 variable candidates , respectively .",
    "93 of them are detected by two methods and 27 are detected by all the three methods .",
    "therefore there are totally 429 variable candidates when any one of the condition is met .",
    "false positives come from four sources .",
    "the first one is the diurnal variation .",
    "though very weak after detrending , it still should be taken into consideration .",
    "secondly , stars at the edges of the fov have regular gaps because stars move in and out of the fov repeatedly every day .",
    "it may cause additional periodic variations .",
    "thirdly , an exposure time of @xmath19 seconds or @xmath20 seconds is too long for a bright variable star , which can pollute its neighborhood .",
    "a typical phenomenon is the fact that they appear to have the same variations .",
    "therefore when two or more targets show nearly the same periods , it is necessary to check if they are very close and if their light curves vary simultaneously .",
    "additionally , a large plate scale of @xmath31 may also produce false eclipses induced by a nearby non - variable star .",
    "other sources of contamination include solar brightness or moonlight at some epoches and occasional aurora , all of which can brighten the sky background .",
    "images with high background have been discarded in the data reduction process .",
    "therefore such contaminations have little effects .",
    "all variable stars are checked in three ways .",
    "their positions , periods and variable trends are compared .",
    "false positives are confirmed if any one of the following conditions is met :    * distance less than ten pixels to a saturated star .",
    "* period equals one sidereal day or diurnal harmonics . *",
    "variable trend resemble that of its neighborhood .",
    "all remaining light curves after culling false positives are manually inspected to exclude variables with similar shapes as eclipsing binaries , e.g. @xmath32 doradus , @xmath33 scuti , rr lyrae , etc . to check",
    "if there exist eclipsing binaries in other types of variable stars , we subtract the strongest period of each variable star and analyze the residuals using the same method described above .",
    "a detached rs canum venaticorum variable is found as shown in figure [ rs ] .",
    "the visual inspection of variables is carried out by two groups of the authors ( m. yang et al . and s. wang et al . ) independently .",
    "eclipsing binaries are selected out and classified into four types according to their morphologies @xcite :    eclipsing detached binary ( ed )  neither component fills its roche lobe ;    eclipsing semi - detached binary ( esd )  only one component fills its roche lobe ;    eclipsing contact binary ( ec )  both components fill their roche lobes ;    ellipsoidal variable ( ell )  low - inclination binaries with close ellipsoidal components .",
    "ed light curves are nearly flat - topped with separate eclipses .",
    "esd light curves are continuously variable with a large difference in depth between the primary and the secondary eclipses .",
    "therefore detached and semi - detached systems are easy to be recognized due to their distinct eclipses . however , for a contact system with indistinct ingress and egress points of the eclipses , visual inspection is not reliable .",
    "challenges mainly come from @xmath33 scuti variables and ells . because both @xmath33 scuti and ell light curves exhibit sinusoidal variations . if a contact system appears approximately equal primary and secondary eclipses , it is difficult to distinguish the ec light curve from @xmath33 scuti and ell light curves .",
    "we take methods of frequency spectrum analysis and locally linear embedding ( lle ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) technique to solve the problem .",
    "the frequency spectrums of ecs and @xmath33 scutis are different .",
    "@xmath33 scuti light curves exhibit variations due to both radial and non - radial pulsations of the star s surface",
    ". therefore the frequency spectrum of a @xmath33 scuti usually contains more peaks caused by the multi - mode pulsations . whereas the frequency spectrum of an ec light curve contains only one strong signal and harmonics of the signal . for cstar data with a short cadence of @xmath3430 s , the harmonics are usually very weak .",
    "we calculate the frequency spectrums of all sinusoidal variables using lomb - scargle method from 0.025 day to 0.95 day for further reference .",
    "ell light curves exhibit sinusoidal variations due to the changing emitting area toward the observer .",
    "we adopt the lle method proposed by @xcite to distinguish ecs and ells .",
    "lle is a nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique .",
    "this method has been applied to _ kepler _ data to classify eclipsing binary light curves and it turns out to be successful .",
    "lle can remember the local geometry of a higher dimensional data set , and reconstruct a lower dimensional projection with the same local geometry .",
    "therefore light curves with similar features will stay adjacent to each other in the lower dimensional projection .",
    "we generate 1000 ec light curves and 1000 ell light curves using phoebe package , respectively .",
    "the amplitudes of these light curves are scaled to the [ 0,1 ] interval .",
    "the light curves are sampled at 100 equidistant phases ; in other words , each light curve can be treated as a point in a @xmath35 dimensional space .",
    "to preserve the local geometry , every light curve is characterized by a linear combination of its @xmath36 neighbors .",
    "we reduce the @xmath35 dimensional space to a @xmath37 dimensional space .",
