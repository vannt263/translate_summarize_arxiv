    "high - temperature superconductivity occurs in a state which is is frequently referred to as an ` rvb spin liquid ' .",
    "this state has no magnetic order , but strong short range antiferromagnetic correlations .",
    "undoubtedly the strong repulsion between electrons , which turns the system into a charge - transfer insulator at half - filling persists in the doped case , so that a description in terms of free - electron like slater - determinants is not really adequate .",
    "the problem then is , how to describe such a state theoretically . despite its frequently being referred to in the literature ,",
    "the rvb spin liquid is a rather elusive concept .",
    "for example the precise nature of its ground state and low lying elementary excitations is not known to any degree of certainty . in the following we want to address this problem by studying a disordered state for the @xmath1 heisenberg antiferromagnet @xmath2 on an 2d square lattice . here",
    "@xmath3 denotes a spin 1/2 operator on site @xmath4 .",
    "one might expect that this is a kind of stepping stone also for the doped case , in that the elementary excitations of the undoped spin liquid persist to some degree also for finite doping .",
    "+ perhaps the best - defined rvb spin liquid is the nearest neighbor rvb state@xcite - at least this wave function can be written down in compact form .",
    "we define the singlet generation operator on the bond @xmath5 @xmath6 where @xmath7@xmath8@xmath9 , are the constrained fermion operators , which do not allow the creation of a second electron on an already singly occupied site . introducing the operator @xmath10 where e.g. @xmath11 denotes the nearest neighbor of site @xmath4 in @xmath12-direction , the nearest neighbor rvb state on a 2d square lattice with @xmath13 sites can be written as @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a normalization factor .",
    "it corresponds to a superposition of all states which can be obtained by covering the plane compactly with nearest neighbor singlets , all with equal phase .",
    "covering the plane with singlets is equivalent to covering it with dimers , a well - known problem from statistical mechanics@xcite .",
    "we can therefore rewrite the state as @xmath16 where @xmath17 denotes a dimer covering of the lattice and @xmath18 the state obtained by putting singlets onto the dimers of @xmath17 .",
    "+ in the following , we want to examine the problem of the possible elementary excitations of such a singlet background , and set up an effective hamiltonian governing their dynamics .",
    "the idea of ` expanding ' around a suitably chosen vacuum state is realized in simplest form in linear spin wave theory .",
    "the general line of thought here is quite analogous to linear spin wave theory , with the sole exception that the role of the vacuum ( which determines the symmetries of the ground state ) is played by the ` singlet soup ' ( [ rvb ] ) instead of the nel state .",
    "a similar approach has previously been applied to dimerized planar heisenberg - type models@xcite to spin ladders@xcite , to strongly coupled heisenberg planes@xcite , and to spin - peierls - like spin chains@xcite .",
    "an example where the fluctuations are fermionic rather than bosonic in nature is provided by the kondo lattice@xcite . the main difference as compared to the present work is that in all of these works a rather unique and simple dimer covering of the system is given by the topology or the form of the hamiltonian - the complications that arise from the use of a disordered ` singlet soup ' such as ( [ rvb ] ) then can be avoided .",
    "+ while the technical complications arising from the use of a dimer basis are considerable , this approach also has some major advantages : in a site basis it is virtually impossible to even write down a disordered spin state , because one has to deal with the spin degeneracy on each single site .",
    "the calculation only becomes feasible if this site - degeneracy is lifted , for example by assuming strict nel order as in spin wave theory . on the other hand , the degeneracy is automatically taken care of in the dimer basis , because two interacting sites do have a unique ground state .",
    "a further considerable advantage of the dimer basis is , that it is easily enlarged by hole pairs on nearest neighbors , so as to describe a superconducting state .",
    "indeed , as will be seen below , the present description of the antiferromagnetic phase most naturally can be generalized to comprise also a superconducting phase , thereby providing a very simple microscopical picture for the so(5 ) rotations which smoothly connect antiferromagnetic and superconducting phase in zhang s theory@xcite of cuprate superconductors .",
    "the nearest neighbor - rvb state ( [ rvb1 ] ) has the symmetry properties expected for a homogeneous spin liquid : it is isotropic , translationally invariant , is an exact spin singlet and has no magnetic order . on the other hand , just as the nel state , it is not an eigenstate of @xmath19 .",
    "if we take one singlet configuration @xmath18 and act with the exchange term on a bond connecting two different singlets ( see figure [ fig1]a ) we can create a state which no longer can be represented as a superposition of only nearest neighbor singlets .",
    "such a state therefore represents a kind of fluctuation and as a first step we need to understand the character of these fluctuations .",
    "it might appear@xcite that the energetically most favorable fluctuation is the state shown in figure [ fig1]b : two nearest neighbor singlets are transformed into a configuration with only one nearest neighbor singlet and a second singlet connecting more distant sites .",
    "nominally the energy increases by only @xmath20 in this transition , because the only change is the loss of one nearest neighbor singlet .",
    "because singlet and triplet are degenerate for sites which are not connected by an exchange bond , we might as well consider the two spins connected by the ` long singlet ' as being unpaired ( see figure [ fig1]c ) .",
    "the transition from figure [ fig1 ] a@xmath21b could thus be viewed as pair creation of two unpaired spins .",
    "next , by acting with the exchange term on a bond which connects a dangling spin to another singlet ( see figure [ fig1]c ) , we can recouple the spins so as to form a new singlet and leave one of the formerly paired spins unpaired ( see figure [ fig1]d ) .",
    "this process corresponds to a propagation    = 7.0 cm    of the dangling spin .",
    "we would thus arrive at the conclusion that the fluctuations out of the nearest neighbor rvb state are unpaired spins , which carry a spin of @xmath22 and consequently must obey fermi statistics .",
    "clearly , these excitations should be identified with the ominous ` spinons ' .",
    "+ further reasoning shows , however , that the line of thought leading to the introduction of the ` spinons ' misses a small but crucial detail .",
    "the first reason is that the state in figure [ fig1]b is not orthogonal to the vacuum ,    = 4.0 cm    and thus can not represent a true fluctuation .",
    "more precisely , if we introduce ( see figures [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] ) ) @xmath23 ) that @xmath24@xmath8@xmath25 , in other words : after the ` transition ' figure [ fig1]a@xmath21b we remain in the original state , figure [ fig1]a , with a probability of @xmath26% .",
    "the problem of non - orthogonality is not restricted to the first step in figure [ fig1 ] : the states fig .",
    "[ fig1]c and [ fig1]d have an overlap of @xmath22 , and this generalizes to any two states which differ by one hopping process of a ` spinon ' .",
    "the non - orthogonality problem thus is omnipresent and severe .",
    "+ let us therefore return to the first step , figure [ fig1 ] a@xmath21b , and consider how we can remedy the problem .",
    "the most natural way to proceed is to form the orthogonal complement @xmath27 so as to see ` what is really new ' in the state @xmath28 .",
    "a straightforward computation shows that after normalization to unity the orthogonal complement is @xmath29 here we have introduced the operators@xcite @xmath30 which create the three components of the _ triplet _ on the bond @xmath31 .",
    "we arrive at the conclusion that the true fluctuation out of the nearest neighbor singlet background is not the creation of two fermionic ` spinons ' , but rather the creation of two excited dimers , which carry a spin of @xmath32 and consequently should be modeled by bond - bosons@xcite .",
    "the further evolution of the created triplets then is quite obvious ( see figure [ fig3 ] ) ( but completely different from that of the ` spinons ' ) : by exchange along bonds connecting the triplets with neighboring singlets the triplets can de - excite while simultaneously the singlet turns into a triplet - this process , which is very much reminiscent of the propagation of a frenkel - type exciton corresponds to the propagation of the excited dimer . note that unlike the ` spinon ' states in figure [ fig1 ] , all different states in figure [ fig3 ] are mutually rigorously orthogonal . as a matter of fact",
    "there are problems with non - orthogonalities also for the triplet states - these are ` inherited ' from the original nearest neighbor rvb state .",
    "they will be discussed in detail below and be shown to be much less severe than those for the ` spinon ' states .",
    "their main effect is to replace the simple excited dimer by a more delocalized object , which resonates between different orientations within a limited spatial region .",
    "= 7.0 cm    to be more precise , we now discuss the action of the heisenberg exchange on all possible configurations of nearest neighbor singlets and triplets .",
    "consider two _ nearest neighbor bonds _ @xmath31 and @xmath33 , and assume that they are connected by a single bond @xmath34 . denoting the heisenberg exchange along the latter bond by @xmath35 we have : @xmath36",
    "these equations show that if we start out from states containing nearest neighbor singlets or triplets on the l.h.s .",
    ", the exchange term only produces states which again consist of nearest neighbor singlets or triplets on the r.h.s ( had the two bonds been connected by exchange along another bond , @xmath37 , @xmath38 or @xmath39 , we would have obtained the same equations with the sole difference that in some cases the prefactors change their sign ) .",
    "this proves rigorously that acting with an arbitrarily high power of the hamiltonian onto the nearest neighbor rvb state produces only states which can be built up from _ nearest neighbor _ singlets or triplets .",
    "+ this ` theorem ' in fact holds true in a more general sense : on a single dimer @xmath40 , the @xmath41 states @xmath42 and @xmath43 do form a complete basis@xcite . thus , if we use a fixed dimer covering @xmath17 , the set of states obtained by placing singlets and triplets on the dimers of @xmath17 form a complete basis of the hilbert space . adding up such states obtained from _ all possible _ dimer coverings then clearly produces a highly overcomplete basis of the hilbert space , which therefore must automatically include states with singlets of arbitrary length .",
    "it follows that all states with longer - range singlets also can be represented as superpositions of states which are composed exclusively from nearest - neighbor singlets and triplets .",
    "these states are therefore redundant , and if we formulate a self - consistent theory in terms of nearest - neighbor singlets and triplets , we have automatically included these longer - ranged singlets .",
    "the fact that we are using a nearest - neighbor rvb state as the starting point for constructing our theory therefore means no loss of generality and in particular does by no means imply that we are considering only states with only very short - ranged antiferromagnetic correlations .",
    "in fact , it will be shown below that one can construct even states with infinite - range antiferromagnetic order by using exclusively nearest neighbor singlets and triplets .",
    "+ the preceding considerations suggest that we should model the excitation spectrum of the nearest neighbor singlet vacuum by bosonic excitations , which approximately correspond to excited dimers . assuming that the bonds in the system have been labeled in some way",
    ", we denote the triplet operator on bond @xmath4 by @xmath44 .",
    "then , we introduce the following basis states @xmath45 where @xmath46 is a normalization factor .",
    "they describe a certain number ( @xmath40 ) of triplets which are ` immersed into the singlet soup ' . thereby the singlets fill the space in between the triplets compactly in all possible ways . all states which can be generated by pair creation and propagation of triplet bonds ( such as the ones shown in figure [ fig3 ] ) can be represented in this way .",
    "we next consider the triplets as boson - like elementary excitations of the singlet - background , in precisely the same way as misaligned spins are considered as bosonic excitations in a ` nel background ' in antiferromagnetic spin wave theory .",
    "re - interpreting the state @xmath47 where the @xmath48 represent boson operators , we may expect to describe the dynamics of these bosons by a hamiltonian of the form@xcite @xmath49 where we have grouped the three triplet components into a 3-vector @xmath50 so as to stress manifest rotation invariance .",
    "the first term in ( [ heff ] ) corresponds to the energy of formation of the triplets , the second term describes pair creation processes as in figure [ fig3]a @xmath21 [ fig3]b , and the third term accounts for the propagation of the triplets , see figure [ fig3]c @xmath21 [ fig3]d .",
    "the matrix elements @xmath51 and @xmath52 should be obtained by computing matrix elements of the heisenberg hamiltonian @xmath19 between the corresponding states ( [ basis ] ) .",
    "of course one thereby has to assume that for example the matrix element for a triplet jumping from bond @xmath40 to bond @xmath15 does not depend significantly on the positions of the other triplets - otherwise a description in terms of a single - particle like hamiltonian would not be feasible .",
    "as is the case in spin wave theory , the @xmath53-bosons have to obey a hard - core constraint , and in fact presence of one boson prohibits the presence of another boson not only on the same bond , but also on all bonds which share a site with the original one . + in the following , we will first study the problem of a single excited dimer in the singlet background , in other words we want to compute the ` bare ' boson dispersion @xmath54 in ( [ heff ] ) . as our basis states",
    "we consequently choose ( suppressing the @xmath12 @xmath55 or @xmath56 spin - index of the triplet ) : @xmath57 where @xmath58@xmath8@xmath59 denotes the direction of the bond in real space , and @xmath60 a normalization factor .",
    "in this state one triplet is put onto the bond @xmath61 and the remainder of the lattice is covered compactly by singlets in all possible ways .",
    "next , we introduce the fourier transforms @xmath62 in the hilbert space of bond - bosons , this state would be denoted by @xmath63 .",
    "the procedure to be followed then is like this : in a first step we compute the @xmath64 overlap matrix @xmath65@xmath8@xmath66 and diagonalize it . denoting the resulting eigenvectors and eigenvalues by @xmath67 and @xmath68 , the states @xmath69 form an orthonormal basis set and",
    "hence can serve as effective single particle orbitals with momentum @xmath70 . since the boson operators which correspond to the original triplets obey@xcite @xmath71 = n_{\\alpha,\\beta}$ ] , the operators @xmath72 obey the canonical commutation relations for boson operators : @xmath73=\\delta_{\\nu,\\nu'}$ ] .",
    "they describe a triplet - like excitation which oscillates between @xmath12 and @xmath55-directed bonds within a certain spatial region whose extent is determined by the range of the real space overlap integrals @xmath74 . + next , we set up the @xmath64 hamilton matrix @xmath75@xmath8@xmath76 .",
    "diagonalizing @xmath77 , where @xmath78 denotes the expectation value of @xmath19 in the ` background ' state ( [ rvb1 ] ) , we obtain the desired dispersion relation of a single triplet boson .",
    "the pair creation matrix element is obtained in an analogous way .",
    "+ this procedure in fact is neither new nor unconventional : a completely analogous construction is performed e.g. in the construction of the @xmath79 model@xcite , which describes the dynamics of the ( non - orthogonal ) zhang - rice singlets on the different plaquettes of the cuo@xmath80 plane .",
    "the only difference is that here we have two different nonorthogonal objects ( bosons on bonds in @xmath12 and @xmath55-direction ) per unit cell , whereas it was only a single zhang - rice singlet / unit cell in the case of the cuo@xmath80 plane .",
    "apart from that the construction is precisely the same .",
    "+ in the next three sections we will calculate the dispersion relation , the pair creation matrix element , and discuss how these matrix elements depend on the density of triplets .",
    "readers which are not interested in these more technical parts are advised to proceed to section vi .",
    "to carry out our program we need to compute the real - space matrix elements @xmath81 and @xmath82 . in doing",
    "so the concept of a loop covering of the plane@xcite is of crucial importance . for two dimer coverings",
    "@xmath17 and @xmath83 the loop covering @xmath84 is obtained by drawing @xmath17 and @xmath83 ` on top of each other ' ( see for example figure 1 in ref .",
    "this produces a covering of the plane by closed loops @xmath85 , each of even length @xmath86 ( note that in the following we always measure the length of a loop @xmath87 ` in units of dimers ' ) .",
    "let us now consider each loop @xmath85 as an isolated 1d ring with @xmath86 sites .",
    "we assume that the sites along the ring are labeled such that the dimer covering @xmath17 corresponds to the state @xmath88 - the dimer covering @xmath83 then must correspond to @xmath89 . expanding the products we get @xmath90 different spin states from each covering , and there are precisely @xmath91 spin states which show up in both @xmath92 and @xmath28 namely the two possible nel states .",
    "we thus have @xmath93 .",
    "the same holds true for any other loop , whence , using @xmath94 , we find the scalar product of the two singlet distributions@xcite @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the total number of loops in the loop covering @xmath97 .",
    "+ let us now assume that the singlets on the bond @xmath40 in @xmath18 and on the bond @xmath15 in @xmath98 have been replaced by a @xmath56-like triplet ( due to the explicit rotational invariance of the ` singlet soup ' the result for an @xmath12-like or @xmath55-like boson will be precisely the same - we are choosing the @xmath56-like component because the ambiguous states in this case are again the ones with nel order along the loop ) . then",
    ", a necessary condition for the scalar product to be different from zero is that there is a single loop @xmath99 in the resulting loop covering @xmath100 which passes through both bonds @xmath40 and @xmath15 .",
    "the reason is that the time - reversal parity of the triplet is negative whereas that of the singlet is positive .",
    "a necessary condition for a loop @xmath85 to give a nonvanishing overlap is that the total time - reversal parities ` along the loop ' are equal for both states @xmath18 and @xmath101 .",
    "this , however , is only possible if the triplets in @xmath18 and @xmath101 are within the same loop .",
    "each loop in @xmath100 therefore must contain either no triplet or both of them .",
    "+ we can now split up the entire overlap integral @xmath102 into components which differ by the length and topology of the loop @xmath99 which passes through both triplets .",
    "the absolute numerical value of the overlap from this particular loop is identical to the case of pure singlet covering .",
    "the only change may be an extra minus sign , which originates because the singlets do have an orientation , whereas the triplets do not .",
    "we thus can rewrite the overlap as @xmath103 here @xmath104 is @xmath32 if the loop covering @xmath97 contains the loop @xmath85 and zero otherwise .",
    "we also note that @xmath105@xmath8@xmath32 , which fixes the normalization factor @xmath60 . with the exception of the @xmath106 all parts in ( [ over - real ] ) can be computed analytically .",
    "@xmath106 may be viewed as the norm of a nearest - neighbor rvb state which covers only the exterior of the loop @xmath85 , divided by the norm @xmath60 of the state which covers the exterior of a single bond .",
    "if we assume that the norm increases exponentially with the number of sites in the system , @xmath107 , with @xmath108 , one would estimate that @xmath109 .",
    "this suggests that @xmath106 is a quite rapidly decreasing function of @xmath87 . in the present work numerical values for @xmath106",
    "were obtained by exact calculations on finite clusters ( see the appendix ) .",
    "the @xmath106 thereby indeed turned out to decay rapidly with @xmath87 , so only contributions with @xmath87@xmath110@xmath91 were kept in the present calculation .",
    "it should be noted that the computation of the @xmath106 is no fundamental obstacle to the present scheme : it may well be possible to obtain essentially exact values for these parameters by using monte - carlo techniques on large lattices .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] then shows the    = 8.0 cm    pairs of bonds @xmath111 and @xmath112 which can be connected by loops of length @xmath91 and @xmath113 as well as the corresponding signs @xmath114 . in this way we find the overlap matrix @xmath115 with @xmath116@xmath8@xmath32 and @xmath117 we proceed to a calculation of the matrix elements of the hamiltonian .",
    "we first recall that for the nearest neighbor rvb state the expectation value of @xmath19 between two dimer coverings @xmath18 and @xmath101 can be decomposed into contributions from each individual loop in the loop covering @xmath100@xcite : @xmath118 \\;2^{p(a+b)-n } , \\nonumber \\\\",

    "@xmath122 is the number of nearest - neighbor bonds that can be formed from the sites covered by @xmath85@xcite .",
    "this formula implies that there is no    = 5.0 cm    contribution from bonds connecting _",
    "different loops_. the reason is that the exchange along a bond connecting different singlets can only lead to the pair creation of two triplets , see the first equation ( [ st ] ) . in order to maintain time reversal symmetry along each loop ,",
    "it is then necessary that both triplets belong to the same loop - which is not possible if the bond in question connects different loops .",
    "+ let us now again assume that the bond @xmath40 in @xmath18 and the bond @xmath15 in @xmath101 are occupied by a triplet , and consider the ` connected matrix element ' of @xmath19 between the two resulting states : @xmath123 .",
    "first , let us assume that we act with the exchange along a bond connecting @xmath40 and a neighboring bond @xmath124 ; the triplet can either propagate from @xmath40 to @xmath124 , or decay into two triplets on both @xmath40 and @xmath124 ( see the second equation ( [ st ] ) ) . neglecting the second possibility we obtain a nonvanishing contribution to the matrix element of @xmath19 only if there is a single loop @xmath125 which covers both , @xmath124 and @xmath15 .",

    "it is the difference of the two contributions ( [ bulk1 ] ) and ( [ bulk2 ] ) and occurs because the loop @xmath99 is fixed , whence the area covered by this loop is not available for resonating between different singlet coverings .",
    "for example we have @xmath159 i.e. this quantity is an additive renormalization of the energy of formation for a single triplet due to its being ` embedded into the singlet soup ' .",
    "numerical evaluation in a cluster shows that this additive correction is quite large - for one triplet in a pure singlet background we find @xmath160 . while this is surprising at first sight",
    "it should be noted that a similar large value ( @xmath161 ) was previously found in spin ladders@xcite .",
    "a fixed triplet obviously leads to a quite substantial loss of resonance energy .",
    "the numerical values of @xmath158 and @xmath78 were again obtained by cluster calculations ( appendix ) . introducing @xmath162@xmath8@xmath163",
    "we can write down the third part of the hamilton matrix : @xmath164 we can now add up the three contributions , ( [ eps1 ] ) , ( [ eps2 ] ) , and ( [ eps3 ] ) to obtain the total ` connected ' hamilton matrix @xmath165 .",
    "this is still expressed in terms of the non - orthogonal orbitals @xmath166 . what remains to be done",
    "therefore is to transform the hamilton matrix to the orthogonal orbitals ( [ ortho ] ) .",
    "to that end we take matrix elements of the form @xmath167 . introducing the @xmath64 transformation matrix @xmath168 the transformed hamiltonian",
    "then can be expressed as @xmath169",
    "in this section we proceed to a discussion of the pair creation amplitude @xmath170 in equation ( [ heff ] ) . as discussed in section ii , by starting from an arbitrary singlet covering of the plane and acting with the hamiltonian along a bond connecting two different singlets , we _ only _ create a state where both singlets are replaced by triplets , see the first of eqs .",
    "( [ st ] ) .",
    "the situation where the two singlets in question are ` parallel ' to each other , i.e. that the @xmath41 sites belonging to the @xmath91 singlets form a square with edge @xmath32 , requires special attention .",
    "as discussed above we have the identity @xmath171 i.e. the state with two parallel triplets can be expressed as a linear combination of the two perpendicular combinations of parallel singlet states .",
    "in other words : this state is already exhausted by the singlet background , and consequently must be omitted from our reduced hilbert space .",
    "the triplets thus have to obey the additional constraint of never being parallel to each other - one implication is that we must set the respective pair creation matrix element to zero .",
    "+ to compute the numerical value of the matrix element , let us consider the action of @xmath19 on the rvb state ( [ rvb ] ) .",
    "we have @xmath172 the first term on the rhs originates from processes where the hamiltonian has ` hit ' a bond covered by a singlet , the second one originates from processes where the exchange has acted along bonds connecting two singlets on bonds @xmath40 and @xmath15 ( the prime on the sum indicates that only pairs of bonds connected by a bond are summed over ) .",
    "the modulus of the respective matrix element is @xmath173 ( see equation ( [ st ] ) ) and there is an extra sign which depends on the relative orientation of the bonds @xmath40 and @xmath15 .",
    "the dependence of this sign on the orientation is shown in figure [ fig8 ] .",
    "also , we have approximated the normalization factor which is included in the definition of @xmath174 by @xmath175 the factor of @xmath176 remains from the definition of ( [ rvb ] ) . to obtain the pair creation matrix element we now form the overlap between ( [ hrvb ] ) and the state @xmath177 .    = 8.0 cm    defining the @xmath64 matrix @xmath178 and bearing in mind that @xmath179 , we find for the pair creation matrix : @xmath180 this completes the derivation of the single - particle terms of the triplet hamiltonian .",
    "before we proceed , let us briefly return to the problem of non - orthogonality .",
    "strictly speaking , the state with two triplets is not orthogonal to the singlet background either .",
    "the reason is that if one draws a loop passing through both triplets , the time reversal parities of the two triplets cancel , and the state has a nonvanishing overlap with a state where the loop is covered only by singlets ( see figure [ fig9 ] ) .",
    "= 4.0 cm    however , this overlap is rather small : in the case shown in figure ( [ fig9 ] ) it is for example @xmath181 , and obviously this is the most unfavorable case . for other relative orientations of the two triplets",
    "the overlap can be only achieved by a loop of length @xmath182 , whence these overlaps are @xmath183 .",
    "the non - orthogonalities thus are much more benign that those for the spinon - states , whence neglecting them altogether ( as we will do henceforth ) is probably quite justified .",
    "in the preceding sections we have computed the various overlap integrals and matrix elements for triplet propagation , pair creation and interaction . in all of these cases",
    "the matrix element could be factorized into a contribution from a ` local ' transition between different singlet / triplet coverings along a single or two neighboring loops , and a factor which describes the embedding of these active loops into the singlet background .",
    "thereby we have always given expressions for these ` embedding factors ' which are valid in the limit of vanishing triplet concentration , i.e. we have computed them as they would be for a pure singlet covering of the system . clearly , this is inappropriate for the real system , where quantum fluctuations have admixed a finite density of triplet bosons . in the following",
    "we want to discuss how we have to modify our theory to take the effect of a finite triplet concentration into account .",
    "it should be stressed from the very beginning that this is quite obviously a very complex problem and we will be forced to apply some relatively crude approximations . + if we want to derive single - particle like matrix elements for finite triplet concentration we should consider overlap integrals or matrix elements of @xmath19 of the type @xmath184 triplets stay unchanged , and only a single one ( which without loss of generality can be taken to be the first one ) changes its position ( but maintains its spin ) . in other words , we should calculate the embedding factors for singlet coverings containing a certain number of ` inert ' triplets .",
    "thereby we actually have to make the major _ assumption _ that the matrix element does not depend significantly on the positions of these inert triplets - otherwise , the very idea of a single particle - like propagation of the triplets would be invalid .",
    "one might then expect that approximate values can be obtained by distributing the @xmath40 inert triplets in all possible ways ( we call the number of possible distributions d(m ) ) over the system , and taking the average of the respective matrix elements computed for all d(m ) possible distributions . in this way",
    ", the embedding factors acquire a dependence on the density of triplets .",
    "+ the numerical calculation in a finite cluster then proceeds as follows : we choose @xmath40 bonds @xmath185 , which obey the various constraints on the relative positions of triplets , and evaluate the ground state norm and energy according to @xmath186\\;2^{p(a+b)-n}\\prod_{\\nu=1}^{m } \\delta_{a+b , i_\\nu}. \\label{hugo}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the calculation of the various embedding factors then proceeds in an entirely analogous fashion i.e. in ( [ over - real ] ) , ( [ etadef ] ) , and ( [ mats ] ) we replace @xmath187 in this way we obtain all embedding factors for fixed distribution of inert triplets , and the value for triplet concentration @xmath188 is obtained by averaging over all allowed distributions of the bonds @xmath185 . in practice",
    "this calculation requires quite a substantial numerical effort so this was performed only for the @xmath189 cluster .",
    "= 4.0 cm    one might expect , however , that the finite size effects are in fact smaller for the more relevant higher triplet concentrations : the main effect of the fixed triplets obviously is to reduce the importance of long loops .",
    "since the bonds occupied by the static triplets must be identical in the bra and ket state , loops of length @xmath190 which pass through these bonds are impossible .",
    "when the density of triplets gets appreciable , the probability to find enough space for forming longer loops becomes smaller and smaller . since longer loops may cause problems in the small clusters , a suppression of these may therefore even reduce finite - size effects .",
    "moreover , the suppression of longer loops is actually beneficial for our entire approach : it tends to eliminate the problems with the nonorthogonalities in the singlet soup and makes the truncation of the length @xmath191 a better approximation .",
    "+ as an illustration figure [ fig10 ] shows the dependence of @xmath192 , i.e. the additive renormalization of the energy of formation of a triplet ( see ( [ renorm ] ) , evaluated in the @xmath189 cluster .",
    "the concentration dependence is as expected : for low triplet concentration @xmath192 is large because an added triplets blocks many long loops along which resonance could have occurred . as the triplet concentration gets higher , these longer loops a blocked anyway , so adding a further triplet does not increase the energy too much any more . in the high - density limit",
    "the additive renormalization approaches zero , as expected .",
    "the figure shows , however , that the concentration dependence is quite significant , i.e. this effect should not be neglected .",
    "+ in addition to reducing the importance of longer loops , for a finite density of triplets we have to take care of the excluded volume constraint which the bond bosons have to obey . placing a triplet on one given bond @xmath40 blocks a total of @xmath193 other bonds , on which no more triplets can be placed ( see figure [ fig11 ] ) .",
    "= 4.0 cm    of these , @xmath194 bonds are blocked because they share a site with @xmath40 , the remaining @xmath91 are blocked because they are ` parallel ' to @xmath40 and the state with two parallel triplets is actually a linear combination of singlets ( see ( [ combo ] ) ) . in order to take care of this _ blocking effect _ ,",
    "we resort to a gutzwiller - type approximation . it has been shown by ogawa _",
    "et al._@xcite that the essence of the gutzwiller approximation is the neglect of the difference in phase between states where the particles in question are distributed in different ways over the lattice . with this approximation ,",
    "any real space distribution of @xmath40 bosons contributes the same number ( which without loss of generality can be taken to be @xmath32 ) to the norm of any state with @xmath40 bosons .",
    "the total norm of any such state then becomes simply the number of possible ways to distribute @xmath40 bosons over the plane , i.e. @xmath195 . in the present case , the situation is somewhat more complicated , because we still have to take into account the fact that due to the loop problem the norm of a state with @xmath40 fixed triplets is not @xmath32 ( unlike the case if the triplets were just ordinary bosons ) .",
    "we thus approximate the normalization factor of any state with @xmath40 triplets by @xmath196 where @xmath197 is the value obtained by averaging ( [ hugo ] ) over all allowed triplet configurations @xmath185 .",
    "clearly , this replacement will lead to a renormalization of the various embedding factors . to evaluate these",
    ", we usually have to consider a certain area @xmath198 , covered by one or two loops , in which the actual overlap , hopping or pair creation process takes place .",
    "we then determine ( again by simulation on the @xmath189 cluster ) the number of ways to distribute @xmath40 triplets over the exterior of the area @xmath198 .",

    "the elementary excitations is a triplet mode , which reaches its lowest energy at @xmath235@xmath8@xmath0 .",
    "such a triplet mode is the most natural generalization of an antiferromagnetic spin - wave to the spin - liquid state .",

    "as discussed above , an antiferromagnetic state may be thought of as being generated by condensing triplet - like spin excitations of the rvb spin - liquid into the state with momentum @xmath0 .",
    "the antiferromagnetic order parameter corresponds to the vector of condensation amplitudes of the three triplet species .",

    "moreover , the expectation value of the energy / bond , @xmath312 , is @xmath313 for @xmath314 , @xmath315 for @xmath316 ; the estimate for @xmath317 is @xmath318@xcite .",
    "all in all the data suggest that already the @xmath189 cluster gives reasonably accurate estimates for the different parameters .",
    "+ moreover , the data show that the @xmath319 and @xmath320 decrease quite rapidly with @xmath308 .",
    "truncation of the series after @xmath145 thus seems to be quite a reasonable approximation as well .",

    "<S> we discuss the excitation spectrum of a disordered , isotropic and translationally invariant spin state in the 2d heisenberg antiferromagnet . the starting point is the nearest - neighbor rvb state which plays the role of the vacuum of the theory , in a similar sense as the nel state is the vacuum for antiferromagnetic spin wave theory . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the elementary excitations of this state and show that these are not fermionic spin-1/2 ` spinons ' but spin-1 excited dimers which must be modeled by bond bosons . </S>",
    "<S> we derive an effective hamiltonian describing the excited dimers which is formally analogous to spin wave theory . </S>",
    "<S> condensation of the bond - bosons at zero temperature into the state with momentum @xmath0 is shown to be equivalent to antiferromagnetic ordering . </S>",
    "<S> the latter is a key ingredient for a microscopic interpretation of zhang s so(5 ) theory of cuprate superconductivity .    2 </S>"
