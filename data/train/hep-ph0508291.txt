    "qcd processes with many external legs are of much interest , both for testing qcd in different settings and as backgrounds for new physics processes at the fermilab tevatron and at the cern lhc .",
    "however , the estimation of multi - jet production cross sections as well as their characteristic distributions is a difficult task .",
    "perturbation theory based on feynman graphs runs into computational problems , since the number of graphs contributing to the amplitude grows like @xmath2 .",
    "the counting of the graphs itself becomes a problem let alone their evaluation and the computation of the color and helicity structures which is an additional source of computational inefficiencies . over the last few years , new recursive algorithms based on dyson - schwinger equations @xcite or on field equations @xcite have been developed in order to overcome the computational obstacles .",
    "very recently also on shell recursive equations have been proposed @xcite .",
    "the amplitude calculated using dyson - schwinger recursive equations , which avoid feynman diagrams , results in a computational cost growing asymptotically as @xmath0 . here ,",
    "the off - shell subamplitudes are introduced which are combinations of parts of feynman graphs .",
    "for those subamplitudes a recursion relation has been obtained which enables to express an n - particle amplitude in terms of all subamplitudes , starting from @xmath3 , @xmath4 , ... up to @xmath5 particles .",
    "the color and helicity structures corresponding to each subamplitude have a simpler form .",
    "moreover , they can be appropriately transformed so the usual summation can be replaced by the monte carlo one .    in this article",
    "the algorithm based on dyson - schwinger recursive equations is presented and used in order to efficiently obtain cross sections for arbitrary multi - jet processes .",
    "to illustrate how the algorithm works let us present a simple example , the gluon self - interaction : @xmath6 here @xmath7 represent the external momenta involved in the scattering process , taken to be incoming .",
    "the subamplitude with an off - shell gluon of momentum @xmath8 has contributions from three- and four - gluon vertices only . to reduce the computational complexity down to an asymptotic @xmath0 , we replaced the four - gluon vertex with a three - gluon vertex by introducing an auxiliary field represented by the antisymmetric tensor @xmath9 .",
    "the recursion for the gluons now changes only slightly .",
    "however , we have an additional equation for the auxiliary field .",
    "diagrammatically , the full content of dyson - schwinger equations is presented in fig .",
    "[ gluons ] and the corresponding equations have the following form : @xmath10 @xmath11 @xmath12@xmath13 @xmath14 @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the new auxiliary field - gluon - gluon vertex : @xmath17 and @xmath18 , and @xmath19 is the fermi sign factor .",
    "in order to be more transparent we will write explicitly the three - gluon vertex part as well as the auxiliary one , suppressing the color indices and using the light - cone representation : @xmath20 @xmath21 @xmath22 @xmath23 where all momenta are taken to be incoming .",
    "these equations , the off - shell fields , are the main building blocks of the gluon self - interaction , which is to be constructed iteratively .",
    "after @xmath24 steps , where @xmath1 is the number of particles under consideration , one can get the total amplitude @xmath25 where @xmath26 so that @xmath27 . the hat denotes functions given by the expression from the previous step except for the propagator term .",
    "this is because the outgoing momentum @xmath28 must be on shell and the propagator term is removed by the amputation procedure .",
    "the iteration begins with the initial condition for the external particles .",
    "for gluons we have @xmath29 where @xmath30 enumerates the external particles , @xmath31 , @xmath32 denotes the polarization vector and @xmath33 .    in order to label and systematically control the momenta of external particles and their relevant intermediate combination , we give all momenta in the binary representation , see _",
    "e.g. _ @xcite . for the process under consideration , and the external particles with momenta @xmath34 , @xmath35 we assign to the momentum @xmath36 a binary vector @xmath37 with components which are either @xmath38 or @xmath39 as follows : @xmath40 the binary vector can now be uniquely represented by the integer @xmath41 in particular , one can write : @xmath42 all subamplitudes can now be replaced by the corresponding integers @xmath43 @xmath44 this representation allows us to establish a natural ordering of the momenta based on the notion of level , defined simply as @xmath45 all external momenta are at the level @xmath39 , whereas the total amplitude corresponds to the unique level @xmath46 . with levels",
    "we can see the natural iteration path of the equations .",
    "we start from the subamplitudes at the level @xmath39 which are the external momenta together with the initial conditions , then go to the subamplitudes at the level @xmath47 and so on until we reach level @xmath46 .",
    "the fermi sign factor is also expressed in the integer number language @xmath48 and we use the following formula @xmath49 with @xmath50 where the hat means that this particular component is equal to @xmath38 if the corresponding external particle is a boson .",
    "this sign factor takes into account the sign change when two identical fermions are interchanged .",
    "contrary to orginal helac @xcite , the computational part consists of only one step , where couplings allowed by the lagrangian defined by fusion rules are only explored , see ref .",
    "@xcite for technical details .",
    "subsequently , the helicity configurations are set up .",
    "there are two possibilities , either exact summation over all @xmath51 helicity configurations , where @xmath52 is the total number of quarks , @xmath53 , the total number of antiquarks and @xmath54 , the total number of gluons ; or monte carlo summation .",
    "for example for a gluon the second option is achieved by introducing the polarization vector @xmath55 where @xmath56 is a random number . by integrating over @xmath57",
    "we can obtain the sum over helicities @xmath58 the same idea can be applied to the helicity of quarks and antiquarks .",
    "finally , the color factor is evaluated iteratively . once again , we have two options .",
    "either we proceed by computing all @xmath59 color configurations , where the gluon is treated as a quark - antiquark pair and @xmath60 is the number of quarks and antiquarks respectively , or particular configurations are chosen by the monte carlo method ( for more details see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    for the process",
    "@xmath61 which we are using through this section as an example the momenta involved in the various levels of calculation are the following :    @xmath62    @xmath63    @xmath64    @xmath65    @xmath66     @xmath67     @xmath68 .    note that we have chosen the particle number @xmath39 as our ending point and , therefore , we have only computed all the relevant momentum combinations where the momentum @xmath69 does not appear .",
    "this excludes all odd integers between @xmath39 and @xmath70 .",
    "the momentum @xmath69 is combined only once , in the last @xmath71th level .",
    "starting from the second level we get : @xmath72 @xmath73 @xmath74 @xmath75 @xmath76 @xmath77 at level @xmath78 : @xmath79 @xmath80@xmath81@xmath82 at the last , 4-th level , the total amplitude is computed by combining this subamplitude with the remaining one , which describes the momentum @xmath69 and is simply given by @xmath83",
    "[ n - jet ]    ._results for the total cross section from @xmath84 up to @xmath85 gluons , @xmath86 corresponds to summation over all possible color configurations , while @xmath87 corresponds to monte carlo summation . _ [ cols= \" < , < , < \" , ]     as an example the algorithm has been used to compute total cross sections for multiple jets production .",
    "the cms energy was chosen @xmath88 @xmath89 and the following cuts were applied @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the transverse momentum of a jet , @xmath92 is the pseudorapidity .",
    "many methods can be used to define what is meant by a jet of hadron .",
    "one commonly used is the cone description of a jet which is the transverse energy , @xmath93 , concentration in a cone of radius @xmath94 with @xmath95 all results are obtained with a fixed strong coupling constant calculated at the @xmath96 scale .",
    "there are several parameterizations for the parton structure functions , we used cteq6 pdf s parametrization @xcite . for the phase space generation we used either phegas @xcite or a flat phase - space generator rambo @xcite .    the results for the total cross section from @xmath84 up to @xmath85 gluons are listed above in table  [ n - jet ] .",
    "we give the exact result with summation over all possible color configurations ( @xmath97 generated events ) , @xmath98 as well as the result obtained with monte carlo summation over color ( @xmath99 generated events ) @xmath87 .",
    "in both cases a monte carlo over helicity is applied .",
    "the next result we present is an example of summation over all color configurations in comparison to monte carlo summation . in fig .  [ 4g_5g_flows ] , the x - axis variable is @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the square matrix element for one particular color configuration normalized to the sum of all possible is plotted .",
    "the agreement is easy visible .",
    "an efficient tool for automatic computation of helicity amplitudes and cross sections for multi - particle final states in qcd has been presented .",
