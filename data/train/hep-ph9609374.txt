    "the standard model ( sm ) is a theory of spin-@xmath0 matter fermions which interact via the exchange of spin-1 gauge bosons , where the bosons and fermions live in independent representations of the gauge symmetries .",
    "supersymmetry ( susy ) is a symmetry which establishes a one - to - one correspondence between bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom , and provides a relation between their couplings @xcite .",
    "relativistic quantum field theory is formulated to be consistent with the symmetries of the lorentz / poincar group  a non - compact lie algebra .",
    "mathematically , supersymmetry is formulated as a generalization of the lorentz / poincar group of space - time symmetries to include spinorial generators which obey specific anti - commutation relations ; such an algebra is known as a graded lie algebra .",
    "representations of the susy algebra include both bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom .",
    "the hypothesis that nature is supersymmetric is very compelling to many particle physicists for several reasons .    *",
    "it can be shown that the susy algebra is the only non - trivial extension of the set of spacetime symmetries which forms one of the foundations of relativistic quantum field theory . * if supersymmetry is formulated as a _",
    "symmetry , then one is necessarily forced into introducing a massless spin-2 ( graviton ) field into the theory .",
    "the resulting supergravity theory reduces to einstein s general relativity theory in the appropriate limit . *",
    "spacetime supersymmetry appears to be a fundamental ingredient of superstring theory .",
    "these motivations say nothing about the _ scale _ at which nature might be supersymmetric . indeed , there are additional motivations for _ weak - scale supersymmetry_.    * incorporation of supersymmetry into the sm leads to a solution of the gauge hierarchy problem .",
    "namely , quadratic divergences in loop corrections to the higgs boson mass will cancel between fermionic and bosonic loops .",
    "this mechanism works only if the superpartner particle masses are roughly of order or less than the weak scale .",
    "* there exists an experimental hint : the three gauge couplings can unify at the grand unification scale if there exist weak - scale supersymmetric particles , with a desert between the weak scale and the gut scale .",
    "this is not the case with the sm .",
    "* electroweak symmetry breaking is a derived consequence of supersymmetry breaking in many particle physics models with weak - scale supersymmetry , whereas electroweak symmetry breaking in the sm is put in `` by hand . ''",
    "the susy radiative electroweak symmetry - breaking mechanism works best if the top quark has mass @xmath1 gev .",
    "the recent discovery of the top quark with @xmath2 gev is consistent with this mechanism .",
    "* as a bonus , many particle physics models with weak - scale supersymmetry contain an excellent candidate for cold dark matter ( cdm ) : the lightest neutralino .",
    "such a cdm particle seems necessary to describe many aspects of cosmology .",
    "finally , there is a historical precedent for supersymmetry . in 1928 , p. a. m. dirac incorporated the symmetries of the lorentz group into quantum mechanics .",
    "he found as a natural consequence that each known particle had to have a partner particle  namely , antimatter .",
    "the matter - anti - matter symmetry was nt revealed until high enough energy scales were reached to create a positron . in a similar manner ,",
    "incorporation of supersymmetry into particle physics once again predicts partner particles for all known particles .",
    "will nature prove to be supersymmetric at the weak scale ?",
    "in this report , we try to shed light on some of the many possible ways that weak - scale supersymmetry might be revealed by colliders operating at sufficiently high energy .      the simplest supersymmetric model of particle physics which is consistent with the sm",
    "is called the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) .",
    "the recipe for this model is to start with the sm of particle physics , but in addition add an extra higgs doublet of opposite hypercharge .",
    "( this ensures cancellation of triangle anomalies due to higgsino partner contributions . ) next , proceed with supersymmetrization , following well - known rules to construct supersymmetric gauge theories . at this stage one",
    "has a globally supersymmetric sm theory .",
    "supersymmetry breaking is incorporated by adding to the lagrangian explicit soft susy - breaking terms consistent with the symmetries of the sm .",
    "these consist of scalar and gaugino mass terms , as well as trilinear ( @xmath3 terms ) and bilinear ( @xmath4 term ) scalar interactions .",
    "the resulting theory has @xmath5 parameters , mainly from the various soft susy - breaking terms .",
    "such a model is the most conservative approach to realistic susy model building , but the large parameter space leaves little predictivity .",
    "what is needed as well is a theory of how the soft susy - breaking terms arise .",

    "amundson , c. kolda , s. martin , t. moroi , s. mrenna , d. pierce , s. thomas , j. wells and b. wright _ ) .",
    "each section contains a brief description of the model , qualitative discussion of some of the associated phenomenology , and finally some comments on event generation for the model under discussion . in this way",
    ", it is hoped that this report will be a starting point for future experimental susy searches , and that it will provide a flavor for the diversity of ways that weak - scale supersymmetry might manifest itself at colliding beam experiments .",
    "we note that a survey of some additional models is contained in ref .",
    "@xcite , although under a somewhat different format .",
    "the currently most popular susy model is the minimal supergravity ( msugra ) model @xcite . here",
    "one assumes that susy is broken spontaneously in a `` hidden sector , '' so that some auxiliary field(s ) get vev(s ) of order @xmath29 .",
    "strength interactions then _ automatically _ transmit susy breaking to the `` visible sector , '' which contains all the sm fields and their superpartners ; the effective mass splitting in the visible sector is by construction of order of the weak scale , as needed to stabilize the gauge hierarchy . in _ minimal _",
    "supergravity one further assumes that the kinetic terms for the gauge and matter fields take the canonical form : as a result , all scalar fields ( sfermions and higgs bosons ) get the same contribution @xmath30 to their squared scalar masses , and that all trilinear @xmath3 parameters have the same value @xmath31 , by virtue of an approximate global @xmath32 symmetry of the sugra lagrangian @xcite .",
    "finally , motivated by the apparent unification of the measured gauge couplings within the mssm @xcite at scale @xmath33 gev , one assumes that susy - breaking gaugino masses have a common value @xmath34 at scale @xmath35 . in practice ,",
    "since little is known about physics between the scales @xmath35 and @xmath36 , one often uses @xmath35 as the scale at which the scalar masses and @xmath3 parameters unify .",
    "we note that @xmath28 parity is assumed to be conserved within the msugra framework .",
    "this ansatz has several advantages .",
    "first , it is very economical ; the entire spectrum can be described with a small number of free parameters .",
    "second , degeneracy of scalar masses at scale @xmath35 leads to small flavor - changing neutral currents .",
    "finally , this model predicts radiative breaking of the electroweak gauge symmetry @xcite because of the large top - quark mass .",
    "radiative symmetry breaking together with the precisely known value of @xmath37 allows one to trade two free parameters , usually taken to be the absolute value of the supersymmetric higgsino mass parameter @xmath38 and the @xmath4 parameter appearing in the scalar higgs potential , for the ratio of vevs , @xmath39 .",
    "the model then has four continuous and one discrete free parameter not present in the sm : @xmath40    this model is now incorporated in several publicly available mc codes , in particular isajet @xcite .",
    "an approximate version is incorporated into spythia @xcite , which reproduces isajet results to 10% .",
    "most susy spectra studied at this workshop have been generated within msugra ; we refer to the various accelerator subgroup reports for the corresponding spectra .",
    "one `` generically '' finds the following features :    * @xmath41 is large , well above the masses of the @xmath9 and @xmath12 gauginos .",
    "the lightest neutralino is therefore mostly a bino ( and an excellent candidate for cosmological cdm  for related constraints , see _",
    "e.g. _ ref .",
    "@xcite ) , and the second neutralino and lighter chargino are dominantly @xmath9 gauginos .",
    "the heavier neutralinos and charginos are only rarely produced in the decays of gluinos and sfermions ( except possibly for stop decays ) .",
    "small regions of parameter space with @xmath42 are possible . * if @xmath43 , all sfermions of the first two generations are close in mass .",
    "otherwise , squarks are significantly heavier than sleptons , and @xmath9 doublet sleptons are heavier than singlet sleptons .",
    "either way , the lighter stop and sbottom eigenstates are well below the first generation squarks ; gluinos therefore have large branching ratios into @xmath44 or @xmath45 quarks . *",
    "the heavier higgs bosons ( pseudoscalar @xmath3 , scalar @xmath46 , and charged @xmath47 ) are usually heavier than @xmath41 unless @xmath48 .",
    "this also implies that the light scalar @xmath49 behaves like the sm higgs .",
    "these features have already become something like folklore .",
    "we want to emphasize here that even within this restrictive framework , quite different spectra are also possible , as illustrated by the following examples .",
    "example a is for @xmath50 gev , @xmath51 gev , @xmath52 gev , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 gev ( pole mass ) .",
    "this yields @xmath56 gev , very similar to the @xmath9 gaugino mass @xmath57 at the weak scale , leading to strong higgsino ",
    "gaugino mixing .",
    "the neutralino masses are 60 , 91 , 143 and 180 gev , while charginos are at 93 and 185 gev .",
    "they are all considerably lighter than the gluino ( at 435 gev ) , which in turn lies well below the squarks ( at @xmath58 815 gev ) and sleptons ( at 750 - 760 gev ) . due to the strong gaugino ",
    "higgsino mixing , all chargino and neutralino states will be produced with significant rates in the decays of gluinos and @xmath9 doublet sfermions , leading to complicated decay chains .",
    "for example , the @xmath59 invariant mass spectrum in gluino pair events will have many thresholds due to @xmath60 decays .",
    "since first and second generation squarks are almost twice as heavy as the gluino , there might be a significant gluino `` background '' to squark production at the lhc .",
    "a 500 gev @xmath61 collider will produce all six chargino and neutralino states .",
    "information about @xmath62 and @xmath63 masses can be gleaned from studies of neutralino and chargino production , respectively ; however , @xmath64 1.5 tev is required to study sleptons directly .",
    "spectra of this type can already be modelled reliably using isajet : the above parameter space set can be entered via the @xmath65 keyword .    as example",
    "b , we have chosen @xmath66 gev , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 gev .",
    "note the large value of @xmath71 , which leads to large @xmath44 and @xmath72 yukawa couplings , as required in models where all third generation yukawa couplings are unified at scale @xmath35 . here",
    "the gluino ( at 517 gev ) lies slightly above first generation squarks ( at 480 - 500 gev ) , which in turn lie well above first generation sleptons ( at 220 - 250 gev ) .",
    "the light neutralinos ( at 83 and 151 gev ) and light chargino ( at 151 gev ) are mostly gauginos , while the heavy states ( at 287 , 304 and 307 gev ) are mostly higgsinos , because @xmath73 .",
    "the masses of @xmath74 ( 355 gev ) , @xmath75 ( 371 gev ) and @xmath76 ( 132 gev ) are all significantly below those of the corresponding first or second generation sfermions . as a result , more than 2/3 of all gluinos decay into a @xmath44 quark and a @xmath77 squark .",
    "since ( s)bottoms have large yukawa couplings , @xmath77 decays will often produce the heavier , higgsino - like chargino and neutralinos .",
    "further , all neutralinos ( except for the lightest one , which is the lsp ) have two - body decays into @xmath78 ; in case of @xmath79 this is the only two - body mode , and for the higgsino - like states this mode will be enhanced by the large @xmath72 yukawa coupling .",
    "chargino decays will also often produce real @xmath76 .",
    "study of the @xmath80 invariant mass spectrum will not allow direct determination of neutralino mass differences , as the @xmath81 are secondaries from tau decays .",
    "even @xmath82 pair events at @xmath61 colliders will contain up to four tau leptons !",
    "further , unless the @xmath83 beam is almost purely right - handed , it might be difficult to distinguish between @xmath76 pair production and @xmath84 pair production .",
    "finally , the heavier higgs bosons are quite light in this case , e.g. @xmath85 gev .",
    "there will be a large number of @xmath86 events at the lhc .",
    "however , because most susy events will contain @xmath72 pairs in this scenario , it is not clear whether the higgs signal will remain visible .",
    "at present , scenarios with @xmath87 can not be simulated with isajet , since the @xmath44 and @xmath72 yukawa couplings have not been included in all relevant decays .",
    "this situation should be remedied soon .",
    "we have seen that the standard msugra framework predicts a testable pattern of squark and slepton masses . in this section",
    "we describe a class of models in which a quite distinctive modification of the msugra predictions can arise , namely contributions to scalar masses associated with the @xmath88-terms of extra spontaneously broken gauge symmetries @xcite .",
    "as we will see , the modification of squark , slepton and higgs masses can have a profound effect on phenomenology .",
    "in general , @xmath88-term contributions to scalar masses will arise in supersymmetric models whenever a gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken with a reduction of rank .",
    "suppose , for example , that the sm gauge group @xmath89 is supplemented by an additional @xmath90 factor broken far above the electroweak scale .",
    "naively , one might suppose that if the breaking scale is sufficiently large , all direct effects of @xmath90 on tev - scale physics are negligible .",
    "however , a simple toy model shows that this is not so .",
    "assume that ordinary mssm scalar fields , denoted generically by @xmath91 , carry @xmath90 charges @xmath92 which are not all 0 . in order to break @xmath90",
    ", we also assume the existence of a pair of additional chiral superfields @xmath93 and @xmath94 which are sm singlets , but carry @xmath90 charges which are normalized ( without loss of generality ) to be @xmath95 and @xmath96 respectively .",
    "then vev s for @xmath93 and @xmath97 will spontaneously break @xmath90 while leaving the sm gauge group intact .",
    "the scalar potential whose minimum determines @xmath98 then has the form @xmath99",
    "^ 2.\\ ] ] here @xmath100 comes from the superpotential and involves only @xmath93 and @xmath97 ; it is symmetric under @xmath101 , but otherwise its precise form need not concern us .",
    "the pieces involving @xmath102 and @xmath103 are soft breaking terms ; @xmath102 and @xmath103 are of order @xmath104 and in general unequal .",
    "the remaining piece is the square of the @xmath88-term associated with @xmath90 , which forces the minimum of the potential to occur along a nearly @xmath88-flat direction @xmath105",
    ". this scale can be much larger than 1 tev with natural choices of @xmath100 , so that the @xmath90 gauge boson is very heavy and plays no role in collider physics .",
    "however , there is also a deviation from @xmath88-flatness given by @xmath106 , with @xmath107 , which directly affects the masses of the remaining light mssm fields . after integrating out @xmath93 and @xmath97",
    ", one finds that each mssm scalar ( mass)@xmath108 receives a correction given by @xmath109 where @xmath110 is again typically of order @xmath104 and may have either sign .",
    "this result does not depend on the scale at which @xmath90 breaks ; this turns out to be a general feature , independent of assumptions about the precise mechanism of symmetry breaking .",
    "thus @xmath90 manages to leave its  fingerprint \" on the masses of the squarks , sleptons , and higgs bosons , even if it is broken at an arbitrarily high energy . from a tev - scale point of view , the parameter @xmath110 might as well be taken as a parameter of our ignorance regarding physics at very high energies .",
    "the important point is that @xmath110 is universal , so that each mssm scalar ( mass)@xmath108 obtains a contribution simply proportional to @xmath92 , its charge under @xmath90 .",
    "typically the @xmath92 are rational numbers and do not all have the same sign , so that a particular candidate @xmath90 can leave a quite distinctive pattern of mass splittings on the squark and slepton spectrum .",
    "the extra @xmath90 in this discussion may stand alone , or may be embedded in a larger non - abelian gauge group , perhaps together with the sm gauge group ( for example in an @xmath111 or @xmath112 gut ) . if the gauge group contains more than one @xmath12 in addition to @xmath113 , then each @xmath12 factor can contribute a set of corrections exactly analogous to ( [ dtermcorrections ] ) .",
    "additional @xmath12 groups are endemic in superstring models , so at least from that point of view one may be optimistic about the existence of corresponding @xmath88-terms and their potential importance in the study of the squark and slepton mass spectrum at future colliders . it should be noted that once one assumes the existence of additional gauged @xmath12 s at very high energies , it is quite unnatural to assume that @xmath88-term contributions to scalar masses can be avoided altogether .",
    "( this would require an exact symmetry enforcing @xmath114 in the example above . )",
    "the only question is whether or not the magnitude of the @xmath88-term contributions is significant compared to the usual msugra contributions .",
    "note also that as long as the charges @xmath92 are family - independent , then from ( [ dtermcorrections ] ) squarks and sleptons with the same electroweak quantum numbers remain degenerate , maintaining the natural suppression of flavor changing neutral currents .",
    "it is not difficult to implement the effects of @xmath88-terms in simulations , by imposing the corrections ( [ dtermcorrections ] ) to a particular  template \" msugra model . after choosing the @xmath90 charges of the mssm fields , our remaining ignorance of the mechanism of @xmath90 breaking is parameterized by @xmath110 ( roughly of order @xmath104 ) .",
    "the @xmath115 corrections should be imposed at the scale @xmath116 where one chooses to assume that @xmath90 breaks .",
    "( if @xmath117 or @xmath118 , one should also in principle incorporate renormalization group effects due to @xmath90 above @xmath116 , but these can often be shown to be small . )",
    "the other parameters of the theory are unaffected .",
    "one can then run these parameters down to the electroweak scale , in exactly the same way as in msugra models , to find the spectrum of sparticle masses .",
    "( the solved - for parameter @xmath119 is then indirectly affected by @xmath88-terms , through the requirement of correct electroweak symmetry breaking . )",
    "the only subtlety involved is an apparent ambiguity in choosing the charges @xmath92 , since any linear combination of @xmath90 and @xmath113 charges might be used .",
    "these charges should be picked to correspond to the basis in which there is no mixing in the kinetic terms of the @xmath12 gauge bosons . in particular models where @xmath90 and/or @xmath113 are embedded in non - abelian groups ,",
    "this linear combination is uniquely determined ; otherwise it can be arbitrary .",
    "a test case which seems particularly worthy of study is that of an additional gauged @xmath120 symmetry . in this case",
    "the @xmath90 charges for each mssm scalar field are a linear combination of @xmath120 and @xmath121 . if this model is embedded in @xmath111 ( or certain of its subgroups ) , then the unmixed linear combination of @xmath12 s appropriate for ( [ dtermcorrections ] ) is @xmath122 .",
    "the @xmath123 charges for the mssm squarks and sleptons are @xmath124 for @xmath125 and @xmath95 for @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",
    "the mssm higgs fields have charges @xmath128 for @xmath129 and @xmath130 for @xmath131 . here",
    "we consider the modifications to a msugra model defined by the parameters @xmath132  gev , @xmath54 , and @xmath133 , assuming @xmath70 gev .",
    "the effects of @xmath88-term contributions to the scalar mass spectrum is illustrated in fig .  1 , which shows the masses of @xmath134 , the lightest higgs boson @xmath135 , and the lightest bottom squark @xmath75 as a function of @xmath110 .",
    "the unmodified msugra prediction is found at @xmath136 .",
    "a particularly dramatic possibility is that @xmath88-terms could invert the usual hierarchy of slepton masses , so that @xmath137 . in the test model , this occurs for negative @xmath110 ; the negative endpoint of @xmath110 is set by the experimental lower bound on @xmath138 .",
    "the relative change of the squark masses is smaller , while the change to the lightest higgs boson mass is almost negligible except near the positive @xmath110 endpoint where it reaches the experimental lower bound .",
    "the complicated mass spectrum perhaps can be probed most directly at the nlc with precision measurements of squark and slepton masses . since the usual mssm",
    "renormalization group contributions to scalar masses are much larger for squarks than for sleptons , it is likely that the effects of @xmath88-term contributions are relatively larger for sleptons .    at the tevatron and lhc , it has been suggested in these proceedings that susy parameter determinations can be obtained by making global fits of the msugra parameter space to various observed signals . in this regard it should be noted that significant @xmath88-term contributions could invalidate such strategies unless they are generalized .",
    "this is because adding @xmath88-terms ( [ dtermcorrections ] ) to a given template msugra model can dramatically change certain branching fractions by altering the kinematics of decays involving squarks and especially sleptons .",
    "this is demonstrated for the test model in fig .  2 .",
    "thus we find for example that the product @xmath139 can change up to an order of magnitude or more as one varies @xmath88-terms ( with all other parameters held fixed ) .",
    "note that the branching ratios of fig .",
    "2 include the leptons from two - body and three - body decays , e.g. @xmath140 and @xmath141 . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath142 is fairly insensitive to @xmath88-terms over most , but not all , of parameter space .",
    "since the squark masses are generally much less affected by the @xmath88-terms , and the gluino mass only indirectly , the production cross sections for squarks and gluinos should be fairly stable .",
    "therefore , the variation of @xmath142 is an accurate gauge of the variation of observables such as the @xmath44 multiplicity of susy events .",
    "likewise , the @xmath143 production cross section does not change much as the @xmath88-terms are varied , so the expected trilepton signal can vary like the product of branching ratios  by orders of magnitude .",
    "while the results presented are for a specific , and particularly simple , test model , similar variations can be observed in other explicit models .",
    "the possible presence of @xmath88-terms should be considered when interpreting a susy signal at future colliders .",
    "an experimental analysis which proves or disproves their existence would be a unique insight into physics at very high energy scales .    to facilitate event generation , approximate expressions for the modified mass spectra are implemented in the spythia monte carlo , assuming the @xmath88-terms are added in at the unification scale .",
    "sparticle spectra from models with extra @xmath88-terms can be incorporated into isajet simply via the @xmath144 keywords , although the user must supply a program to generate the relevant spectra via rge s or analytic formulae .",
    "we considered models in which the gaugino masses and/or the scalar masses are not universal at the gut scale , @xmath35 .",
    "we study the extent to which non - universal boundary conditions can influence experimental signatures and detector requirements , and the degree to which experimental data can distinguish between different models for the gut - scale boundary conditions .",
    "we focus on two well - motivated types of models :    @xmath145 superstring - motivated models in which susy breaking is moduli dominated .",

    "gaugino masses are generated by a chiral superfield @xmath93 that appears linearly in the gauge kinetic function , and whose auxiliary @xmath152 component acquires an intermediate - scale vev : @xmath154 where the @xmath155 are the gaugino fields .",

    "supersymmetry breaking must be transmitted from the supersymmetry - breaking sector to the visible sector through some messenger sector .",
    "most phenomenological studies of supersymmetry implicitly assume that messenger - sector interactions are of gravitational strength .",
    "it is possible , however , that the messenger scale for transmitting supersymmetry breaking is anywhere between the planck and just above the electroweak scale .",
    "the possibility of supersymmetry breaking at a low scale has two important consequences .",
    "first , it is likely that the standard - model gauge interactions play some role in the messenger sector .",
    "this is because standard - model gauginos couple at the renormalizable level only through gauge interactions .",
    "if higgs bosons received mass predominantly from non - gauge interactions , the standard - model gauginos would be unacceptably lighter than the electroweak scale .",
    "second , the gravitino is naturally the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) .",
    "the lightest standard - model superpartner is the next to lightest supersymmetric particle ( nlsp ) .",
    "decays of the nlsp to its partner plus the goldstino component of the gravitino within a detector lead to very distinctive signatures . in the following subsections the minimal model of gauge - mediated supersymmetry breaking , and the experimental signatures of decay to the goldstino , are presented .",
    "the standard - model gauge interactions act as messengers of supersymmetry breaking if fields within the supersymmetry - breaking sector transform under the standard - model gauge group .",
    "integrating out these messenger - sector fields gives rise to standard - model gaugino masses at one - loop , and scalar masses squared at two loops .",
    "below the messenger scale the particle content is just that of the mssm plus the essentially massless goldstino discussed in the next subsection .",
    "the minimal model of gauge - mediated supersymmetry breaking ( which preserves the successful predictions of perturbative unification ) consists of messenger fields which transform as a single flavor of @xmath473 of @xmath153 , i.e. there are triplets , @xmath252 and @xmath474 , and doublets , @xmath475 and @xmath476 .",
    "these fields couple to a single gauge singlet field , @xmath477 , through the superpotential @xmath478 a non - zero expectation value for the scalar component of @xmath477 defines the messenger scale , @xmath479 , while a non - zero expectation value for the auxiliary component , @xmath152 , defines the supersymmetry - breaking scale within the messenger sector . for @xmath480 ,",

    "the gaugino and scalar masses go roughly as their gauge couplings squared .",
    "the bino and right - handed sleptons gain masses only through @xmath113 interactions , and are therefore lightest .",
    "the winos and left - handed sleptons , transforming under @xmath489 , are somewhat heavier .",
    "the strongly interacting squarks and gluino are significantly heavier than the electroweak states .",
    "note that the parameter @xmath484 sets the scale for the soft masses ( independent of the @xmath490 for @xmath491 ) .",
    "the messenger scale @xmath492 , may be anywhere between roughly 100 tev and the gut scale .",
    "the dimensionful parameters within the higgs sector , @xmath493 and @xmath494 , do not follow from the ansatz of gauge - mediated supersymmetry breaking , and require additional interactions . at present",
    "there is no good model which gives rise to these higgs - sector masses without tuning parameters .",
    "the parameters @xmath119 and @xmath495 are therefore taken as free parameters in the minimal model , and can be eliminated as usual in favor of @xmath39 and @xmath496 .",
    "electroweak symmetry breaking results ( just as for high - scale breaking ) from the negative one - loop correction to @xmath497 from stop - top loops due to the large top quark yukawa coupling .",
    "although this effect is formally three loops , it is larger in magnitude than the electroweak contribution to @xmath497 due to the large squark masses . upon imposing electroweak symmetry breaking , @xmath119 is typically found to be in the range @xmath498 ( depending on @xmath39 and the messenger scale ) .",
    "this leads to a lightest neutralino , @xmath292 , which is mostly bino , and a lightest chargino , @xmath317 , which is mostly wino .",
    "with electroweak symmetry breaking imposed , the parameters of the minimal model may be taken to be @xmath499 the most important parameter is @xmath500 which sets the overall scale for the superpartner spectrum .",

    "the low energy spectrum is only weakly sensitive to @xmath503 , and the splitting between @xmath504 and @xmath505 may be neglected for most applications .      in the presence of supersymmetry breaking",

    "the gravitino is naturally the lightest supersymmetric particle .",
    "the lowest - order couplings of the spin-@xmath508 longitudinal goldstino component of the gravitino , @xmath509 , are fixed by the supersymmetric goldberger - treiman low energy theorem to be given by @xcite @xmath510 where @xmath511 is the supercurrent . since the goldstino couplings ( [ goldcoupling ] ) are suppressed compared to electroweak and strong interactions , decay to the goldstino",
    "is only relevant for the lightest standard - model superpartner ( nlsp ) .    with gauge - mediated supersymmetry breaking",
    "it is natural that the nlsp is either a neutralino ( as occurs in the minimal model ) or a right - handed slepton ( as occurs for a messenger sector with two flavors of @xmath512 ) .",
    "a neutralino nlsp can decay by @xmath513 , while a slepton nlsp decays by @xmath514 .",
    "such decays of a superpartner to its partner plus the goldstino take place over a macroscopic distance , and for @xmath515 below a few 1000 tev , can take place within a detector .",

    "the decay of the lightest standard - model superpartner to its partner plus the goldstino within a detector leads to very distinctive signatures for low - scale supersymmetry breaking .",
    "if such signatures were established experimentally , one of the most important challenges would be to measure the distribution of finite path lengths for the nlsp , thereby giving a direct measure of the supersymmetry - breaking scale .      in the minimal model of gauge - mediated supersymmetry breaking",

    "it is mostly gaugino and decays predominantly by @xmath516 . assuming @xmath28 parity conservation , and decay within the detector , the signature for supersymmetry at a collider is then @xmath517 , where @xmath123 arises from cascade decays to @xmath292 . in the minimal model",
    "the strongly interacting states are much too heavy to be relevant to discovery , and it is the electroweak states which are produced . at @xmath61 colliders @xmath292 can be probed directly by @xmath45-channel @xmath425 exchange , yielding the signature @xmath518 . at a hadron collider",
    "the most promising signals include @xmath519 , where @xmath520 .",
    "another clean signature is @xmath521 .",
    "one event of this type has in fact been reported by the cdf collaboration   @xcite . in all these signatures both the missing energy and photon energy are typically greater than @xmath522 .",
    "the photons are also generally isolated .",
    "the background from initial- and final - state radiation typically has non - isolated photons with a much softer spectrum .    in non - minimal models",
    "it is possible for @xmath292 to have large higgsino components , in which case @xmath523 can dominate . in this case",
    "the signature @xmath524 arises with the @xmath44-jets reconstructing @xmath525 in pairs .",
    "this final state topology may be difficult to reconstruct at the lhc  a systematic study has not yet been attempted .    detecting the finite path length associated with @xmath292 decay represents a major experimental challenge . for the case",
    "@xmath516 , tracking within the electromagnetic calorimeter ( emc ) is available .",
    "a displaced photon vertex can be detected as a non - zero impact parameter with the interaction region . for example , with a photon angular resolution of 40 mrad/@xmath526 expected in the cms detector with a preshower array covering @xmath527 @xcite , a sensitivity to displaced photon vertices of about 12 mm at the 3@xmath352 level results",
    ". decays well within the emc or hadron calorimeter ( hc ) would give a particularly distinctive signature . in the case of decays to charged particles , such as from @xmath528 or @xmath529 with @xmath530 , tracking within a silicon vertex detector ( svx ) is available . in this case",
    "displaced vertices down to the 100 @xmath119 m level should be accessible .",
    "in addition , decays outside the svx , but inside the emc , would give spectacular signatures .",
    "it is possible within non - minimal models that a right - handed slepton is the nlsp , which decays by @xmath531 . in this case",
    "the signature for supersymmetry is @xmath532 . at @xmath61 colliders",
    "such signatures are fairly clean . at hadron colliders",
    "some of these signatures have backgrounds from @xmath533 and @xmath534 production",
    ". however , @xmath535 production can give @xmath536 , which has significantly reduced backgrounds .",
    "in the case of @xmath537 production the signature is nearly identical to slepton pair production with @xmath538 with @xmath292 stable .",
    "the main difference here is that the missing energy is carried by the massless goldstino .",
    "the decay @xmath514 over a macroscopic distance would give rise to the spectacular signature of a greater than minimum ionizing track with a kink to a minimum ionizing track .",
    "note that if the decay takes place well outside the detector , the signature for supersymmetry is heavy charged particles rather than the traditional missing energy .      for event generation by isajet , the user must provide a program to generate the appropriate spectra for a given point in the above parameter space .",
    "the corresponding @xmath144 parameters can be entered into isajet to generate the decay table , except for the nlsp decays to the goldstino . if @xmath539 at 100% , the @xmath369 command can be used . since the @xmath540 particle is not currently defined in isajet ,",
    "the same effect can be obtained by forcing the nlsp to decay to a neutrino plus a photon .",
    "if several decays of the nlsp are relevant , then each decay along with its branching fraction must be explicitly added to the isajet decay table .",
    "decay vertex information is not saved in isajet , so that the user must provide such information . in spythia ,",
    "the @xmath540 particle is defined , and decay vertex information is stored .",
    "in this report we have looked beyond the discovery of supersymmetry , to the even more exciting prospect of probing the new physics ( of as yet unknown type ) which we know must be associated with supersymmetry and supersymmetry breaking .",
    "the collider experiments which disentangle one weak - scale susy scenario from another will also be testing hypotheses about new physics at very high energies : the susy - breaking scale , intermediate symmetry - breaking scales , the gut scale , and the planck scale .",
    "we have briefly surveyed the variety of ways that weak - scale supersymmetry may manifest itself at colliding beam experiments .",
    "we have indicated for each susy scenario how monte carlo simulations can be performed using existing event generators or soon - to - appear upgrades . in most cases",
    "very little simulation work has yet been undertaken . even in the case of minimal supergravity",
    "the simulation studies to date have mostly focused on discovery reach , rather than the broader questions of parameter fitting and testing key theoretical assumptions such as universality . clearly more studies are needed .",
    "we have seen that alternatives to the minimal supergravity scenario often provide distinct experimental signatures .",
    "many of these signatures involve displaced vertices : the various nlsp decays , lsp decays from @xmath28 parity violation , chargino decays in the 200 and o - ii models , and enhanced @xmath44 multiplicity in the 24 model .",
    "this observation emphasizes the crucial importance of accurate and robust tracking capabilities in future collider experiments .",
    "the phenomenology of some scenarios is less dramatic and thus harder to distinguish from the bulk of the msugra parameter space . in any event ,",
    "precision measurements will be needed in the maximum possible number of channels . in the absence of a `` smoking gun '' signature like those mentioned above ,",
    "the most straightforward way to identify variant susy scenarios will be to perform an overconstrained fit to the msugra parameters .",
    "any clear inconsistencies in the fit should point to appropriate alternative scenarios .",
    "more study is needed of how to implement this procedure in future experiments with real - world detectors and data .      for a review ,",
