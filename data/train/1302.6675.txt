    "totally asymmetric simple exclusion process ( tasep ) @xcite serves as a paradigmatic example of open non - equilibrium systems in one dimension ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "its practical realizations include quasi-@xmath0 motion of molecular motors along with microtubules in intra - cellular transport @xcite , protein synthesis @xcite or motion in geometrical confinement , e.g. , nuclear pore complex of cells @xcite .",
    "in contrast , symmetric exclusion process ( sep ) @xcite is a typical example of @xmath0 diffusion .",
    "well - known examples of sep include diffusion through artificial crystalline zeolites @xcite . in both passive ( sep ) and active ( tasep or tasep - like ) systems , prohibition of mutual passage of particles or _",
    "exclusion _ gives rise to nontrivial collective effects , whose details of course depend upon whether the dynamics in question is tasep or sep . active systems with open boundaries generally display spatially nontrivial steady state density distributions .    in this paper , we propose a closed model that consists of two overlapping rings with a common diffusive part ( sep ) and two parallel active ( driven ) channels ( marked @xmath1 and @xmath2 hereafter ) . in order to ensure competition between driven and diffusive dynamics , we consider a particular limit of the model .",
    "our principal result includes identification of a model parameter @xmath3 , having values between 0 and 1 ( see below ) , as a switch , by tuning which continuously keeping everything else unchanged ( i ) one may de - pin pinned domain walls ( dw ) and ( ii ) .",
    "our model should serve as a paradigmatic example of localisation - delocalisation transition in a @xmath0 closed model with coupled diffusive and driven dynamics .",
    "in addition to its direct theoretical relevance , it is phenomenologically motivated by the movement of molecular motors in closed compartments @xcite , the dynamics of colloidal particles in optical traps @xcite and the dynamics for multiple mrnas competing for finite resources ( ribosomes ) , where the ribosomes in turn are bounded by a certain trajectory and a diffusion rate outside the mrna ( during recycling )  @xcite . in both sep and tasep ,",
    "each lattice site has maximum unit occupancy for sep with open boundaries , the density profile is always linear with the slope being determined by the boundary conditions at the two ends @xcite .",
    "in contrast tasep with open boundaries displays three distinct phases @xcite characterized by their average densities ( low and high ) and a third phase marked by a maximal current ( mc ) . unlike with open boundary conditions , individual sep and tasep dynamics with closed boundaries ( say , closed rings ) exhibit only uniform density profile in the steady state due to spatial translational invariance . the rest of the paper is organised as follows : in sec .  [ model ] we discuss our model in details . then in sec .",
    "[ steady ] we set up our mean - field theory ( mft ) and discuss the steady state density profiles by using our mft , complemented by extensive monte - carlo simulation ( mcs ) studies . in sec .",
    "[ local ] we go beyond mft , and discuss domain wall fluctuations and delocalisation transition at @xmath4 . finally , in sec .",
    "[ conclu ] we summarize our results .",
    "to @xmath5 from lj to rj for @xmath6 and for sep from rj to lj , superscripts denote site numbers for the corresponding channel @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath7 , width=283 ]    our proposed @xmath0 model is a closed system of two overlapping rings consisting of three channels of equal number of sites designated by @xmath8 as shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig : model1 ] ) .",
    "dynamics of the two channels @xmath1 and @xmath2 are governed by tasep and the particles in the third channel execute sep .",
    "particles can hop to both direction with rate @xmath9 , whereas in @xmath1 and @xmath2 particles can only hop to its right neighbour if empty with rate unity setting the time scale . at the left junction of @xmath1 and @xmath2 particles can either enter from sep channel with rate @xmath10 and @xmath11 respectively if those sites are vacant or can hop to the other side with rate @xmath9 . if @xmath12 be the total number of particles then , the global particle density @xmath13 in this model , the three bulk parameters @xmath14 control different phase transitions .",
    "thus we observe _ bulk induced _ phase transitions unlike the usual tasep with open boundaries which display boundary induced phase transition .",
    "the steady state current in each of sep , @xmath1 or @xmath2 is a function of @xmath15 and is spatially constant .",
    "notice that our model is a variant and extension of that in ref .",
    "in particular , for @xmath16 or 0 , @xmath2 or @xmath1 is blocked and our model explicitly reduces to that of ref .",
    "@xcite . evidently , for @xmath17 and @xmath18 the behaviour of the two channels are simply interchanged .",
    "we use mean - field theory ( mft ) together with extensive monte - carlo simulation ( mcs ) of our model to obtain the steady state density profiles . in the mft ,",
    "the system is considered as a collection of three channels ( two tasep and one sep ) with effective entry and exit rates  @xcite . once these effective rates are determined from the condition of constancy of particle currents ,",
    "one may use them in conjunction with the known results for tasep and sep with open boundaries to obtain the density profiles here . since an isolated tasep in steady",
    "state can be in three different states , the low density ( ld ) , high density ( hd ) and maximal current ( mc ) phases , and we have two active ( tasep ) channels , there are a number of possibilities for the overall density profile of the two active channels . in order to ensure that the diffusive current does not vanish in the thermodynamic limit ( tl , see ref .",
    "@xcite , see below also ) we let diffusivity @xmath9 scales with system size @xmath5 and define a parameter @xmath19 which is the same for any arbitrary system size .",
    "thus steady states of the model are to be parametrised by @xmath20 .",
    "let us now set the notations : our main results are summarized in the phase diagrams ( parametrised by @xmath21 and @xmath22 ) for @xmath23 and @xmath24 , as shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig : theta.8_phase ] ) , for a representative value of @xmath25 , which are obtained by extensive monte - carlo simulations of our @xmath0 lattice - gas model and the corresponding @xmath0 mft ; see below for details . .",
    "for any value of @xmath3 ( except @xmath26 , when one of the active channels is closed ) , the phase diagrams of both @xmath1 and @xmath2 may display a combination of the usual ld , hd and mc phases and a region of co - existence of ld and hd phases , i.e. , when the density profiles show _ localised domain walls ( dw)_. the phase co - existence regions are _ non - overlapping _ for @xmath1 and @xmath2 , i.e. , they do not appear for the same values of @xmath22 and @xmath21 for a given @xmath27 .     for densities @xmath28 and @xmath29 for channels @xmath1 and @xmath2 respectively obtained from our mft and mcs ( circles , squares and triangles ) analysis . staying up to @xmath30",
    ", @xmath1 has four phases ( all marked by suffix a in the phase diagram ) , ld , ld - hd , hd and mc phase , where as , @xmath2 has only three phases ( marked by suffix b ) without any mc phase .",
    "the blue and the lines correspond to the phase boundaries obtained for @xmath1 , whereas the orange line for @xmath2 from mft calculations .",
    "the red circles and grey triangles correspond to the phase boundaries obtained from mcs for @xmath1 and the green squares for that of @xmath2.,width=283 ]    at @xmath4 , for which @xmath1 and @xmath2 are statistically symmetric , the density profiles @xmath23 and @xmath24 of @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively , are naturally identical .",
    "the crucial difference with @xmath27 is that the co - existence region now corresponds to _ delocalised dws _",
    ", i.e. , the fraction of the system size @xmath5 visited by a fluctuating dw _ does not _ vanish in tl @xmath31 .",
    "such delocalised dws appear in _ both _ @xmath1 and @xmath2 only for @xmath4 .",
    "thus as @xmath32 , the model undergoes a _",
    "delocalisation transition_. the phase diagram for @xmath4 are given in fig .",
    "( [ fig : theta.5_phase ] ) .     and",
    "@xmath2 for @xmath4 .",
    "there are four distinct phases ; @xmath1 and @xmath2 , being statistically identical , have identical phase behaviour ( see text ) .",
    "the ld - hd phases in both @xmath1 and @xmath2 now have _ delocalised _ dws .",
    "numerical data are shown by circles and triangles and the phase boundaries obtained analytically are shown by solid lines.,width=283 ]    to begin with , we denote densities at the junction site by for the active channels , and in the passive sep channel .",
    "the sep current then takes the well - known linear form , @xmath33 evidently , @xmath34 remains finite in tl provided @xmath9 scales with @xmath5 linearly , else , for a fixed @xmath9 the sep current @xmath34 vanishes for @xmath31 .",
    "this provides _ a posteriori _",
    "justification for the scale - dependent @xmath9 that we have mentioned before . noting that the current in each of @xmath1 and @xmath2 is given by @xmath35 ( assuming no boundary layer at @xmath36 , i.e. , @xmath37 are in their ld / coexistence phases ) and using conservation of total current at the left and right junctions for the individual incoming / outgoing currents to / from @xmath1 and @xmath2 from / to the sep channel we obtain @xmath38 next , the individual outgoing currents at the sites @xmath39 in @xmath1 and @xmath2 are ( again assuming that the channels are in ld or coexistence phase ) @xmath40 conservation of current then yields @xmath41 as expected , this holds so long as @xmath37 are in their ld or coexistence phase .",
    "in contrast , if @xmath37 are in their hd or coexistence phases the total outgoing current from @xmath1 and @xmath2 to the sep channel is given by @xmath42 conservation of total current at the right junction then yields ( assuming @xmath43 to be in hd or coexistence phases ) @xmath44    further , again assuming hd or coexistence phases for @xmath45 , and separately considering the currents from yields @xmath46  @xcite .",
    "this is corroborated by our mcs simulations ( see below ) .",
    "this immediately yields that the bulk currents are equal .",
    "this is possible only when the bulk currents in @xmath6 are controlled by rj , i.e. , @xmath1 or @xmath2 are both in hd or a combination of coexistence and hd phases . notice that the conditions obtained for by using current conservations at the respective sites do not hold simultaneously , unless @xmath47 or @xmath2 are in coexistence phases , such that there are no boundary layers at with @xmath45 being piecewise continuous . having defined _ effective _ entry and exit rates ( valid separately for ld / coexistence or hd / coexistence phases in @xmath6 ) for the active channels , we can now apply the known results of tasep here .",
    "one obtains the low ( high ) density phases in the periodic system equally and are characterized by a uniform density below ( above ) 1/2 and a boundary layer at the right ( left ) .",
    "however for @xmath48 , the boundaries are matched by a piecewise constant density profile with an intervening dw .",
    "for tasep with open boundaries , particle entry and exit events are uncorrelated , and as a result , the dw is delocalised and undergoes random walks covering the entire span of the system in the long time limit .",
    "however in the present model , as in ref .",
    "@xcite , entry and exit of particles are _ not uncorrelated _ ; they get correlated by the fact that the ends of the active channels are connected by the passive channel .",
    "consequently , as revealed by our monte carlo simulation studies , we find localised dw in the active channels , which is similar to ref .",
    "however , rather surprisingly for the special case of @xmath4 , i.e. , when each of the active channels carry equal current on average , we obtain delocalised dws in _ both _ channels .",
    "our mft formulated above may now be used to analyse the density profiles in the different channels of the model quantitatively .      first ,",
    "let us consider a situation when there is a dw in one of the active channels ( say @xmath1 with @xmath17 ) and the other active channel ( @xmath2 ) is in the ld phase with a uniform density @xmath49 ( within mft neglecting any boundary layer ) .",
    "following the phenomenology of tasep with open boundaries , we set @xmath50 as a requirement of a dw in @xmath1 .",
    "possibilities of simultaneous dws in @xmath1 and @xmath2 will be discussed later . within mft , @xmath28 may be represented by a heaviside function that connects the two regions of constant density through a localized dw at position @xmath51 ( say ) as , @xmath52 since @xmath2 is assumed to be in the ld region , density @xmath24 can be written as , @xmath53 neglecting the boundary layer at the right boundary . for the sep channel the linear density distribution gives ,",
    "@xmath54 further , the particle number conservation can be expressed as @xmath55,\\ ] ] following the conditions as above and disregarding the discontinuities at the right boundaries .",

    ", our model belongs to the class of models lacking translation invariance and without boundaries that displays a phase transition ( in the form of a delocalisation transition ) .",
    "our model may be extended in several new directions , e.g. , again motivating by ribosome movements along mrna , one may in our model consider particle exchanges between @xmath1 and @xmath2 , or between one of the active channels and passive channel ( representing ribosome attachments or detachments ) , allow defects along the active channels ( representing defects in the mrna ) , introduce a second control parameter at the exit ends of @xmath1 and @xmath2 that controls the relative outgoing currents to sep and unequal hopping rates in @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
