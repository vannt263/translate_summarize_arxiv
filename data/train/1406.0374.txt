    ". let @xmath3 be the set of all integers and @xmath4 be the set of all non - negative integers including zero . consider a continuous time markov chain ( ctmc ) @xmath5 with the following transition rates : given @xmath6 a component ( a spin ) @xmath7 increases by @xmath8 at the rate @xmath9 , where @xmath10 , @xmath11 and at the same time each positive component @xmath7 decreases by @xmath8 at constant rate @xmath8 .",
    "this birth - and - death dynamics belongs to a class of stochastic dynamics which is used in statistical physics to describe the time evolution of a system of interacting spins .",
    "our particular dynamics is motivated by adsorption - desorption processes , where adsorption rates depend on a local environment and an adsorbed particle can depart at a non - zero rate ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is closely related to a particle deposition on a discrete substrate and urn models with interaction ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , and  @xcite ) .",
    "recall also that a birth - and - death process on the non - negative integer half - line is a classic probabilistic model for the population size so that the markov chain can be used for modelling different types of interaction between populations , where a component @xmath12 can be interpreted as the size of a population which is located at @xmath13 at time  @xmath14 .",
    "if we assume that spins are bounded and consider the same birth - and - death dynamics then we will get a finite ergodic markov chain whose equilibrium distribution is a gibbs measure ( see remark  [ gibbs ] ) . a particular case of the model with bounded spins , where @xmath15 , was studied in  @xcite .",
    "for instance , if a spin takes values @xmath16 and @xmath8 only , and , in addition , @xmath17 , then we obtain a finite markov chain whose equilibrium distribution is a gibbs measure on @xmath18 which is equivalent to a particular case of the famous ising model on @xmath19 . the main goal in  @xcite was to study the asymptotic behaviour of the stationary distribution as  @xmath20 . in general , the asymptotic behaviour of such equilibrium distributions in thermodynamic limit , i.e. as graph @xmath21 expands , is of main interest in statistical physics .",
    "the aim of this paper , on the other hand , is to describe the asymptotic behaviour of the markov chain with _",
    "unbounded _ spins as time tends to infinity while the underlying graph remains fixed . in this case",
    "we deal with a countable markov chain that can be either recurrent ( or even ergodic ) or non - recurrent ( e.g. , transient , or even explosive ) depending both on the graph @xmath21 and the values of parameters  @xmath22 .",
    "it is easy to see that if @xmath23 then the structure of graph @xmath21 is irrelevant and the components of ctmc @xmath24 are independent identically distributed birth - and - death processes with values in @xmath4 . the well known results for birth - and - death processes ( e.g.  see  @xcite or  @xcite ) yield that if @xmath25 , then each component is an explosive mc .",
    "in turn , it implies that ctmc @xmath24 is explosive .",
    "moreover , independence of spins imply that their times to explosion are also independent and this allows to repeat the well known rubin s argument ( used in  @xcite in the case of classic polya urn scheme ) in order to obtain that with probability @xmath8 only a single component of @xmath24 explodes .",
    "notice that this fact can be also inferred from our theorem  [ t2 ] .",
    "a non - zero interaction does not change the explosive behaviour of the markov chain in the case @xmath26 but escape to infinity can happen in various ways which depend on both @xmath27 and @xmath21 .",
    "if @xmath28 , then cmtc @xmath24 is formed by a collection of independent ergodic markov chains .",
    "it is quite obvious that if both @xmath29 and @xmath30 then the markov chain remains to be ergodic .",
    "if @xmath31 , then one could intuitively expect that given @xmath29 there exists some critical value @xmath32 such that if @xmath33 , then the stable ergodic evolution of the system is still observed , and , in contrast , if @xmath34 , then the system becomes unstable , i.e. transient or even explosive .",
    "we compute this critical value explicitly in some cases .",
    "it turns out that @xmath35 , where @xmath36 in the case of a graph @xmath21 with the constant vertex degree @xmath37 and @xmath38 in the case of a star graph @xmath21 with @xmath39 vertices .",
    "the markov chain under consideration is reversible , therefore the computation of its invariant measure is straightforward .",
    "stationary probability distributions arising in positive recurrent cases are gibbs measures with unbounded positive spins on a finite graph with empty boundary conditions . consequently the model in positive recurrent cases",
    "is closely related to gibbs random fields with unbounded spins on graphs ( see  @xcite , @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "we give a detailed description of how the markov chain escapes to infinity in all the transient cases that we consider .",
    "we show that due to a rapid increase of birth rates in explosive cases , there are no death events in the system after some finite random moment of time , and the dynamics of the markov chain is that of a pure birth process , obtained by setting the death rates to zero",
    ".    we will start with results that are valid in the case of an arbitrary finite connected graph  @xmath21 ; they are presented in theorems  [ t1 ] ,  [ t2 ] and  [ t.no.triangle ] .",
    "we also study two special cases in more detail , namely constant vertex degree graphs and star graphs .",
    "the results for these two cases are found in theorems  [ t3 ] ,  [ t31 ] and  [ t4 ] .",
    "graphs with the constant vertex degree and star graphs are particular examples of spatially homogeneous graphs and of spatially inhomogeneous graphs , respectively .",
    "despite the obvious difference in the structure of these graphs the long term behaviour of the corresponding markov chains is similar to each other .",
    "the main features of the model dynamics are illustrated in section  [ exp ] by a model with graph  @xmath21 formed by just two neighbouring vertices .",
    "proofs are given in section  [ proofs ] .",
    "finally , we denote by @xmath40 or just @xmath41 various constants whose exact values are immaterial and can change from line to line .",
    "let @xmath21 be an arbitrary graph . given @xmath42",
    "define _ potential _ @xmath43 of a vertex @xmath44 as the following quantity @xmath45 notice the following identity @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the degree of vertex @xmath44 , i.e.  the number of edges incident to the vertex . throughout the paper we will also denote by @xmath48 the indicator of a set ( or event ) @xmath49 . in these notations , given @xmath50 a component @xmath7 jumps up by @xmath8 with intensity @xmath51 and",
    "the generator of the markov chain is therefore @xmath52 where @xmath53 is a configuration such that @xmath54 and @xmath55 for all @xmath56 ( addition of configurations is understood component - wise ) .",
    "recall that the embedded markov chain , corresponding to a continuous time markov chain ( ctmc ) , is a discrete time markov chain ( dtmc ) with the same state space , and that makes the same jumps as the continuous time markov chain with probabilities proportional to the corresponding jump rates .",
    "let  @xmath57 be the dtmc corresponding to ctmc  @xmath24 .",
    "the states of the embedded markov chain will be denoted by  @xmath58 and we will use the same symbol  @xmath59 to denote the discrete time .    it is easy to see that if @xmath23 then the components of ctmc @xmath24 are independent identically distributed birth - and - death processes in @xmath4 .",
    "it is easy to see that ctmc @xmath24 is ergodic , if @xmath29 , and is explosive if @xmath26 respectively . also , if both @xmath60 and @xmath23 then ctmc @xmath24 is formed by a collection of independent simple symmetric random walks in @xmath4 reflected at the origin .",
    "this ctmc is null recurrent if @xmath61 , and is transient if @xmath62 .",
    "we exclude these trivial cases in what follows .",
    "let us define the following function @xmath63 it is easy to see that @xmath64 for all @xmath44 and @xmath42 .",
    "this equation is a detailed balance condition which implies that the markov chain is time - reversible with invariant measure @xmath65 . according to e.g. theorem  1.2.4 in  @xcite ,",
    "an irreducible countable markov chain is positive recurrent ( i.e. ergodic ) if and only if there exists a stationary probability distribution , and if the latter exists then the distribution of the markov chain converges to it as time goes to infinity .",
    "therefore , if @xmath66 then ctmc @xmath24 is ergodic with the stationary probability distribution given by @xmath67    [ gibbs ] if a component of the markov chain takes values in @xmath68 , where @xmath69 , then the invariant probability distribution of the markov chain is defined similar to measure  ( [ inv ] ) .",
