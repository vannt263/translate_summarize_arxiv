    "the basic plan of the paper is as follows .",
    "we describe the model and its setup for our simulations in section [ sec : method ] , where we endeavor to provide enough details to facilitate reproduction of the results . in section [ sec : results ] we present the results of simulations initialized with different organized large - scale flow patterns , including the rest state . in this section",

    "we have also performed simulations in which the domain extends down to 100  bars and again verified that the basic behavior described in this paper is not affected .",

    "run4 is initialized with a flow containing three jets .",
    "note that the condition for run4 is very similar to the zonal average of the wind field of run1 at 50  planetary rotations .",
    "the jet profiles presented in figure  [ fig : uini ] are independent of height , as well as longitude .",
    "figure  [ fig : tlev22 ] shows the temperature and flow fields of the four runs at @xmath61 ( or @xmath62 ) .",

    "the figure illustrates the major point of this paper : given different initial states , there are clear , qualitative ( as well as quantitative ) differences between the different runs .",
    "qualitatively , there are some common features . for example",
    ", most of the runs exhibit a coherent quadrupole flow structure  two large cyclonic and anti - cyclonic vortex - pairs straddling the equator .",
    ": it is positive for a cyclone and negative for an anticyclone .",
    "] however , the _ location _ of an individual vortex is different in the runs  as is the temperature pattern . in run3 ,",
    "a distinct quadrupole pattern is not present but there are more vortices in this run compared to the other runs .",
    "the temperature distributions are different because they are strongly linked to the flow .",
    "consequently , the minimum - to - maximum temperature ranges vary from a moderately large 550  k ( run4 ) to only about 200  k ( run3 ) in the figure .",
    "the behavior just described is not restricted to a single altitude .",
    "figure  [ fig : tlev7 ] shows the fields corresponding to those presented in figure  [ fig : tlev22 ] , but at a higher altitude ( @xmath63  mbar pressure level ) .",
    "comparison of figures  [ fig : tlev22 ] and [ fig : tlev7 ] illustrates the structural differences in 3-d ( vertical ) , as well as in 2-d ( horizontal ) . in run2 and run4 ,",
    "the large - scale vortices are strongly aligned , forming columns through most of the height extent of the modeled atmosphere ; that is , the flow is strongly barotropic . in the other two runs ,",
    "the flow is not vertically aligned throughout in large parts of the modeled atmosphere  and , therefore , the flow is baroclinic",
    ". the two figures also point to the corresponding strong difference in 3-d temperature distributions , associated with the flow structures .",
    "this is more clearly seen in figure  [ fig : tvert ] .",
    "the figure shows the vertical ( height - latitude ) cross - section of the temperature at 0 degrees ( sub - stellar ) longitude from the runs presented in figures [ fig : tlev22 ] and [ fig : tlev7 ] . in figure",
    "[ fig : tvert ] , the hottest and coldest regions are at different locations in all the runs . near the equator , run1 exhibits a strong temperature inversion , while run2 and run4 do not .",
    "in addition , run2 and run4 exhibit generally strong decreases in temperature with height , while the others do not . as can be seen",
    ", the degree of temperature mixing varies strongly in the vertical direction among the runs  from @xmath64",
    "k contrast ( run3 ) to @xmath65  k contrast ( run4 ) . in general ,",
    "the vertical structure is of low order , containing usually a single inversion . in our study",
    ", some form of inversion appears to be a generic feature .",
    "preliminary steady state analysis of the primitive equations suggests that the basic behavior described above is due to the way in which the applied , @xmath66 , forcing projects onto the normal modes of the planetary atmosphere ; here , @xmath67 is the zonal wavenumber and @xmath68 is the total ( sectoral ) wavenumber of the spectral harmonics .",
    "in particular , a normal mode decomposition of the atmosphere into the vertical structure and hough functions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) indicates that the forcing projects mostly onto low - order baroclinic modes , when the initial state is at rest .",
    "in contrast , when the initial state contains large - scale jets , the forcing projects more strongly on the barotropic mode , compared to the runs started from rest .",
    "similar behavior has been observed in studies of the earth s troposphere under tropical forcing ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . a more detailed study of coupling between forcing and normal modes is currently being performed and will be described elsewhere .",
    "furthermore , it is important to note that all of the above features , both dynamical and thermal , can vary in time .",
    "all of these features are important for observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and spectral modeling ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "a thorough study of the long - time evolution ( over 1000  planetary rotations , or more than @xmath69 ) of the runs reveals a fundamental difference in their temporal behavior as well .",
    "for example , the flow pattern in run2 is characterized by two vertically aligned vortex columns in each hemisphere that translate longitudinally around the poles .",
    "the temperature in the upper altitude region is more strongly coupled to the flow than it is in the lower altitude regions .",
    "the flow pattern in run4 is also a set of vertically aligned vortex columns , but the columns oscillate in the east - west direction .",
    "the patterns in run1 and run3 are more complex , exhibiting a mixture of vortex splitting and merger and stationary states at different altitude levels .",
    "figure  [ fig : kine ] , which shows a time series of the total kinetic energy , gives a quantitative measure of the different temporal behavior of the simulations .",
    "when the flow field is time - averaged over a long period , the time - mean state is also significantly sensitive to the initial flow .",
    "this can be seen in figure  [ fig : t - tmean ] , which shows temperature cross - sections at an arbitrary longitude ( @xmath70 ) , averaged over 450 planetary rotations ( planet day 300 to 750 ) .",
    "the figure clearly shows that the variability observed is not simply a result of a phase shift in a quasi - periodic evolution .",
    "the flow and temperature structures in each run are fundamentally different from one another .",
    "interestingly , the full range of flow and temperature behavior described above has been previously captured qualitatively , using the one - layer equivalent - barotropic model @xcite .",
    "the equivalent - barotropic equations are a reduced , vertically - integrated version of the full primitive equations used in this study @xcite . in many situations ,",
    "the reduced model can be fruitfully used to study the dynamics of the full model by varying the rossby deformation radius to represent different heights ( or temperatures ) of the full multi - layer model ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and this also appears to be the case for hot extrasolar planets .      as might be expected from general nonlinear dynamics theory , in fact the evolution can be strongly sensitive to small differences in the initial flow state .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ fig : stir ] .",
    "there , two simulations are presented ( panels a and b ) , which are identical in all respects except for a minute difference in the initial flow .",
    "the simulation in the top panel ( run5 ) is started from rest .",
    "in contrast , the simulation in the bottom panel ( run1 ) is started with a small perturbation : the initial values of @xmath52 and @xmath53 at each grid point are set to a gaussian random distribution , centered on zero with a standard deviation of 0.05  m  s@xmath54 .",
    "note that the maximum initial wind perturbation magnitude is only about 0.02% of the typical root mean square flow speed in the frames shown ( @xmath71 500  m  s@xmath54 ) .",
    "the two panels in figure  [ fig : stir ] show temperature and flow distributions after @xmath72 ( or @xmath73 ) at the @xmath74  mbar level .",
    "the distributions in the two panels are clearly different . at times",
    "they may look more similar than shown here , but in general that is not the case .",
    "the two runs generally show a different temporal behavior . note that in figure  [ fig : stir]a , there is a high degree of hemispheric symmetry , particularly in the north - south direction .",
    "in contrast , figure  [ fig : stir]b shows a clear asymmetry in both the north - south and east - west direction .",
    "the small asymmetry in figure  [ fig : stir]a is entirely due to machine precision and is not physical , since there is no way to break the symmetry in the setup of the run .",
    "therefore , not surprisingly , some mechanism for inducing a noticeable symmetry breaking is necessary .",
    "the salient point here is , however , that even a tiny perturbation can lead to a marked difference in the flow and temperature distributions , even at relatively early integration times .",
    "it is important to understand that the dependence on the initial flow state is robust and the behavior is not limited only to the parameters , and the ranges , discussed thus far .",
    "the dependence has been verified for numerous model parameters and ranges .",
    "for example , figure  [ fig : tau42h ] shows that the strong dependence on the initial wind exists for much shorter @xmath37 , despite the strong forcing such drag times entail . in this case , @xmath75 .",
    "the upper panel is from run6 and the lower panel is from run7 .",
    "the former run is initialized with only small stirring and no organized jet .",
    "in contrast , the latter run is initialized with a westward equatorial jet , identical to the setup of run3 .",
    "at the shown time and height , there are clear differences between the flow and temperature patterns of the two simulations .",
    "the coldest area is advected east of the anti - stellar point in run6 , but west of the anti - stellar point in run7 . furthermore",
    ", all the vortices have different locations .",
    "in run7 , there is a fairly zonally symmetric jet at high latitudes , leading to a much more homogenized temperature distribution above the mid - latitudes than in run6 .",
    "while a weaker difference might be expected in this case , based on other studies ( e.g. , cooper & showman 2005 ) , the sensitivity is unabated in our simulations . and",
    ", this holds for the long time average behavior as well . for a time mean over 300 rotations ( e.g. , planet days 1200 to 1500 ) , at the level shown in figure  [ fig : tau42h ] , the location of the coldest region differs by 40 degrees in longitude between the two simulations shown in the figure .",
    "figure  [ fig : kine - tau42h ] shows a time series of the total kinetic energy in the two simulations , revealing their different evolution . even after integrating for a very long time ( 15,000 rotations )",
    ", we have checked that the differences between run6 and run7 are still present .",
    "note that this is a much longer integration time than that reported in any published studies of close - in planet circulation thus far .",
    "however , the flow at such long times is inexorably affected by cumulative numerical dissipation and phase errors and the result obtained should not be taken too literally ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , we have studied the dependence when the initial jet contains a vertical shear  i.e .",
    ", the jet distribution is baroclinic .",
    "simulations have been initialized with an eastward jet , which has zero magnitude at the bottom and increases linearly with height so that the lateral flow distribution in the top layer of the model is identical to that in run2 . in the baroclinic case",
    ", vortex columns evolve that extend throughout most of the atmosphere , as in run2 .",
    "however , unlike in run2 , the temperature structure here is also strongly barotropic .",
    "this appears to be related to the way the forcing projects onto the free modes of the system , as described in section [ sec : basic ] .    as alluded to in section [ subsec : eqns ] , the timescale of the fastest motions admitted by equations  ( [ eq : pe ] ) with the given boundary condition is @xmath76  minutes , for the planetary physical parameters used in this work .",
    "hence , a forcing with timescales of the same order or smaller is not entirely physically self - consistent with the use of equations  ( [ eq : pe ] ) .",
    "notably , such forcing introduces numerical difficulties . for the physically unrealistic drag time of @xmath37 = 1  hour , for which excessive numerical dissipation is required to prevent the code from blowing up or being inundated with numerical noise , the _ temperature _ evolution is only mildly sensitive to the initial condition , at long - time integrations .",
    "however , when such short drag times are only applied over a limited range in pressure  i.e .",
    ", @xmath37 is allowed to vary with @xmath29 the sensitivity to the initial condition is present even after long time integrations ( 7000 planet days ) .",
    "in this paper , we have shown that in a generic general circulation simulation of a tidally synchronized planet , the flow and temperature distributions depend strongly on the initial state . in all simulations initialized with a different jet configuration , large scale",
    "coherent vortices are formed ; but , their location , size , and number varies , depending on the initial wind .",
    "the temperature distribution is relatively homogenized by the flow , compared to the large temperature contrast in the forcing equilibrium temperature profile .",
    "but the degree of mixing , as well as locations of temperature extremes vary between differently initialized simulations . the time variability of the atmosphere  i.e . how vortices and associated temperature patterns move around the planet or whether they stay at fixed positions",
    " varies depending on the initial wind .",
    "the newtonian drag scheme used in this study is idealized and the `` correct '' parameters to use in the set - up are unknown , with many choices possible . explorations of different parts of the parameter space will be presented elsewhere . here , we have chosen the set - up to capture , as cleanly as possible , the effects of the initial flow in a regime of parameter space plausibly relevant for hot jupiters with strong zonally - asymmetric forcing .",
    "we have found that the strong dependence on the initial wind is valid for a wide range of thermal drag times ( @xmath37 = 0.510 planet days ) and with t21 , t42 , and t85 resolutions . some reduction in the sensitivity",
    "is sometimes observed for the very small @xmath37 and long time integration simulations , which require large numerical dissipation to prevent the fields from being dominated by small scale noise .",
    "this situation is , however , not physically realistic and numerically suspect",
    ".    the strong dependence on initial wind has implications for the use of general circulation models for interpretation of observations of extrasolar planet atmospheres .",
    "these results underline that , while numerical circulation models of the kind employed here are useful for studying plausible mechanisms and flow regimes , they are currently unsuitable for making `` hard '' predictions  such as exact locations of temperature extremes on a given planet .",

    "<S> we use a general circulation model to study the three - dimensional ( 3-d ) flow and temperature distributions of atmospheres on tidally synchronized extrasolar planets . in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we focus on the sensitivity of the evolution to the initial flow state , which has not received much attention in 3-d modeling studies . </S>",
    "<S> we find that different initial states lead to markedly different distributions  even under the application of strong forcing ( large day - night temperature difference with a short `` thermal drag time '' ) that may be representative of close - in planets . </S>",
    "<S> this is in contrast with the results or assumptions of many published studies . in general , coherent jets and vortices ( and their associated temperature distributions ) characterize the flow , and they evolve differently in time , depending on the initial condition . </S>",
    "<S> if the coherent structures reach a quasi - stationary state , their spatial locations still vary . </S>",
    "<S> the result underlines the fact that circulation models are currently unsuitable for making quantitative predictions ( e.g. , location and size of a `` hot spot '' ) without better constrained , and well posed , initial conditions . </S>"
