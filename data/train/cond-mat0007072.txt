    "it was realized long ago on theoretical grounds that most melting transitions should be first order,@xcite although exceptions include the possibility of defect - mediated melting in two - dimensional ( 2d ) crystals@xcite and the mean - field transition between the superconducting vortex lattice and the normal state in type - ii superconductors.@xcite as with most first - order transitions , there is no good simple theory of melting to compare with our theoretical understanding of many continuous phase transitions : a first - order transition occurs when the free energy of one phase as a function of temperature crosses the free energy of another phase ( see fig .  [ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "these two phases are qualitatively different and generally demand theoretical treatments with distinct approximations , such that a detailed comparison of free energies is not possible .",
    "the solid - liquid transition is a prime example of this problem .",
    "we can treat the solid phase well within elasticity theory , but this is not a useful description of the liquid .",
    "a common approach to this problem is to concentrate on the solid phase and calculate its stability limit@xcite ( a complementary method is to treat the liquid , e.g. within density functional theory,@xcite and find the lowest temperature for the liquid phase to exist ) .",
    "a plausible mechanism for the crystal instability comes from anharmonic effects that may soften the lattice when thermal fluctuations are large . to this end",
    "one can develop a self - consistent harmonic approximation ( scha),@xcite where an effective harmonic theory is used that better approximates the true anharmonic system for finite thermal fluctuations .",
    "we can then identify the limit to a self - consistent solution with the instability temperature of the solid . while it is unclear whether or not the instability point @xmath0 is close to the melting temperature @xmath1 , it does give an upper bound ( see section  [ sec : scha ] ) , and represents the first step to understanding the possible mechanisms of melting for a given system .",
    "= 6.5 cm    an example of this hunt for the anharmonic instability point occurred several years ago in the context of 2d melting .",
    "an early scha calculation by platzman and fukuyama@xcite for a 2d electron system found a dramatic stiffening of the wigner crystal as a function of temperature , and the anharmonic instability point was reached well above the dislocation - mediated melting temperature .",
    "later , fisher considered anharmonic corrections from a perturbation expansion around the harmonic theory , and could show that the lowest - order temperature correction to the shear modulus was downwards.@xcite the opposite result of the scha calculation comes from the fact that it misses contributions from odd anharmonicities .",
    "a series of papers by lozovik and coworkers@xcite emphasized this fact , and developed an alternative self - consistent procedure from the dyson equation for the two lowest order diagrams of the expansion .",
    "this alternative method was named the ( 3 + 4)-self consistent approximation ( sca ) .",
    "( the sca is distinguished from the scha in that self - consistency comes from the dyson resummation of a set of skeletal diagrams in the perturbation theory , rather than by using an effective harmonic theory to take averages over the true hamiltonian . )",
    "an important result of lozovik s work was that for long - range interactions in 2d , the anharmonic instability point lies below the dislocation mediated melting temperature , implying a first - order rather than continuous transition .",
    "our own interest in the melting problem originates in studies of the vortex system in high-@xmath2 superconductors ( see ref .   for a review .",

    "we have found , in agreement with lozovik , that the scha seriously underestimates the thermal softening of the vortex lattice ( see section  [ sec : vl ] ) .",
    "however , application of the diagrammatic ( 3 + 4)-sca did not lead to a good quantitative comparison , and so we have developed an improved self - consistent method that includes all diagrams in the ( 3 + 4)-sca and the scha . because the improved method uses an effective harmonic theory , but is equivalent to the dyson equation for all two - vertex diagrams , we call it the two - vertex - scha . the successful comparison of this new method to numerical results for the vortex lattice forms the main result of this paper .    the article is structured as follows .",
    "we first define the harmonic approximation for a generalized crystal . then in section  [",
    "sec : scha ] we describe the self - consistent harmonic approximation and its justification within a variational approach . in section  [ sec : pert ] we review the perturbation expansion about the harmonic approximation , look at the diagrams corresponding to the scha and see why this approximation can give such misleading results .",

    ". we can then use the general inequality@xcite for the free energy @xmath30 , @xmath31 so that for a given trial hamiltonian we get the best approximation to the free energy by minimizing the right hand side .",
