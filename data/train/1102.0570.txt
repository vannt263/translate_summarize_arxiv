    "observations of large amounts of dust present in high-@xmath0 galaxies with ages of less than 1 gyr , on the other hand , suggest that even though low - mass stars seem to be the dominant dust producers in the present universe , this might not always have been the case @xcite .",

    "* ) . however , a few intersting cases where significant amounts of dust are detected do exist , such as keplers supernova @xcite and cassiopeia a @xcite .",
    "there is also evidence for a significant amount dust ( @xmath2 ) surrounding eta carina @xcite . whether the dust present in the kepler and cas a sn remnants",
    "is produced by the sne themselves or the dust is formed from metals in the surrounding ism is unclear .",
    "it is also uncertain if the dust which can be formed in the winds of massive stars ( such as eta carina ) survive the shock wave of the subsequent sn explosion .",
    "however , it is not possible to rule out sne as significant dust producers , although a recent analysis of the existing observational constraints on dust productivity in sne has shown that , on average , sne seem to be converting a much smaller fraction of their metals into dust ( corresponding to a few times @xmath3@xmath4 of dust ) compared to agb stars @xcite .    assuming sne as the only source of dust in the early universe , @xcite",

    "this galaxy appears to contain an unexpectedly high dust mass ( given its redshift ) which has raised doubts about whether stars alone can produce so much dust in such a short time .",
    "@xcite argued that stellar sources can account for the dust detected by observations and show also that the contribution of agb stars to dust production in the early universe may be far from negligible .",
    "recently , @xcite reached a conclusion similar to that of @xcite , although their model includes also nonstellar sources of dust .",
    "however , the model by @xcite as well as that of @xcite assumes a gas mass that is much larger ( about an order of magnitude ) than the observed mass of molecular gas of @xmath8 @xcite",
    ". a more gas rich galaxy will obviously be able to hold a greater mass of dust , which led @xcite to suggest that the gas content of many dust rich galaxies at high redshifts may be greatly underestimated ( their preferred models has a few times @xmath9 of gas after 1 gyr ) .",
    "an intriguing discovery which has complicated the picture is that not all quasar host galaxies at high redshifts show significant dust components .",
    "in fact , some of them may be essentially dust free ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "quasars at high redshifts are powered by supermassive black holes with masses @xmath10 ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "this finding may lend some support to a hypothesis presented by @xcite , that dust may form in significant quantities in the outflows of quasars .",
    "in this paper it will be shown that the stellar dust production required to explain the observed dust mass in sdss j1148 + 5251 and in other high-@xmath0 galaxies is higher than what appears reasonable taking both theoretical and observational constraints into account .",
    "is some kind of secondary dust production , possibly associated with a quasar outflow , required to explain the detections of large dust masses ? or are the high dust - to - gas ratios at high redshifts simply an artefact due to incorrect calibration of conversion factors for gas and dust tracers ?",

    "galaxy formation at @xmath22 may thus be representative for when the vast majority of galaxies formed in the early universe .    according to the current cosmological paradigm ( see sect .",

    ", dust destruction in the ism is probably dominating over nucleation ( which rarely happens in the ism ) , and it is thus fair to assume that introducing an _ effective _ rate of dust destruction in the ism @xmath29 is sufficient in order to model the dust cycle .",
    "following @xcite the dust destruction time - scale is @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the gas mass , @xmath32 is the effective gas mass cleared of dust by each sn event , and @xmath33 is the sn rate , which may be approximated as @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the mass of the most massive sn - progenitors . the integral in eq .",

    "when considering the contribution from agb stars there is a time - lag due to the lifetimes of these stars and therfore the destruction of dust depends on how the sn rate evolves . if the rate of star formation has decreased sufficienly when the release of new dust from agb stars happens , the dust destruction by sne will be much less due to the lower sn rate .",

    "the first sub - set ( models 1 - 30 ) represents an attempt to reprouce the metals and dust assuming the star formation builds up to roughly the same stellar mass as in the simulation by @xcite , while still maintaining the lower - limit gas mass suggested by observations . with model 11 as the only exception",

    "[ quasar_zeta ] ) .    changing the imf from a normal @xcite imf ( @xmath74 ) to at top - heavy ditto ( @xmath75 ) increases both the amount of dust production as well as the dust destruction by sn shocks , as can be seen from models 31 - 60 .",
    "models 36 , 42 , 51 and 57 are all reproducing the expected range for the dust mass , while all models with higher dust destruction efficiency ( @xmath76 ) predict too much dust destruction due to the significantly increased sn - rate .",
    "the resultant dust masses are in those cases at most a few times @xmath77 .",
    "models 31 - 60 are essentially ruled out because the resultant metallicities are too high to be realistic ( @xmath78 at @xmath7 ) and inconsistent with the expected range of dust - to - metals ratios ( see fig .",
    "[ quasar_zeta ] ) .",
    "models 61 - 90 ( see fig .",
    "[ quasar_zeta ] , and table  [ parameters_g ] ) are analogous to the numerical model by @xcite in that they have similar stellar and gas masses ( a total baryon mass of @xmath79 ) and represent a closed - box scenario .",
    "the stellar dust yield referred to as the high yield ( see table  [ yields ] ) and corresponds to the model preffered by @xcite .",
    "the resultant gas mass ( @xmath80 ) is significantly higher than the mass inferred from observations ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . with this high gas mass , even the low ( observed ) dust yield ( see * ?",
    "* ) is sufficient to reproduce the observed dust mass , and the maximal yield leads to an over - production of dust in several cases ( models 71 - 73 and 86 - 88 ) .",
    "this is the main reason why the model by @xcite is marginally consistent with the high dust mass derived from observations without invoking dust growth in the ism or any other seconday dust source .",
    "more gas simply means more dust without resulting in unrealistic dust - to - gas ratios . but as one can see in fig .",
    "[ quasar_zeta ] , the total amount of metals is generally too high to have dust - to - metals ratios in the expected range .    applying observational constraints on both the gas mass and the stellar mass ( models 91 - 120 ) results in two plausible models .",
    "both are models without dust destruction in the ism and the maximal stellar yield ( see table [ yields ] ) . adding non - stellar dust production ( as it is implemeted here ) means no actual improvement for the models with lower yields .",
    "it essentially requires that all metals in the ism are turned into dust .    adding a top - heavy imf ( models 121 - 150 , see fig .",
    "[ quasar_sth ] ) leads to a result very similar to that of models 31 - 60 ( also with a top - heavy imf ) , i.e. , the over - all metal production is not sufficient to reproduce the expected range of dust to metals .      among the seven models of sdss j1148 + 525 that reproduce the expected dust mass and dust - to - metals ratio",
    "( see previous section ) , only two are infall models .",
    "one may note as well that all the closed - box models presented here ( and the model by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are conceptually inconsistent , since @xcite consider a galaxy being formed by a sequence of merger events , where the smaller progenitor galaxies are very metal poor and have had very little star formation ( @xmath81 ) .",
    "the infall models ( 16 - 30 , 46 - 60 , 76 - 90 , 106 - 120 and 136 - 150 ) are therefore more appropriate .",
    "this fact was indeed acknowledged by @xcite , although the exact consequences were not discussed .    from the present study it is clear , however , that infall models are not preferred over closed - box models in that they do not reproduce the dust mass and/or overall metallicity better than closed - box models .",
    "infact , a merger / infall scenario requires a higher stellar dust yield in order to produce the same dust mass , which is due to the effects of the dilution by pristine infall ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the fact that the dust destruction time scale is proportional to gas mass .",
    "the latter is important during the early phase of evolution , since in a closed - box scenario the initial gas mass is always equal to the total mass of baryons .",
    "the gas mass is never as high as during the initial phase of the gas mass evolution , which means that the dust destruction time scale is significantly longer at early times ( when the rate of dust production is at its highest ) compared to the infall scenario ( see eq . [ taud ] and the example in fig .",
    "[ taudplot ] ) .",
    "in the model of sdss j1148 + 525 , the intense star formation expected during the first 400 myr would produce a lot of stellar dust , while @xmath36 would still be relatively long on average in the closed - box case . as a consequence ,",
    "the effective dust production have to be higher . if an infall scenario is adopted , the gas mass during the early evolution is lower even if the final total mass of baryons is the same .",
    "for example , in models 1 - 30 the dust destruction time scale is about 15 times shorter for infall models compared to closed - box models and therefore infall models have a lower dust - formation efficiency .",
    "infall models always require a larger metal yield than the closed - box models in order to contain the same amount metals . as discussed above",
    ", the dust - to - metals ratio @xmath67 should be roughly that of dlas @xcite .",
    "the lower net - production of dust for a given stellar mass of infall models tends to result in higher @xmath67-values ( see fig .",
    "[ quasar_zeta ] ) .",
    "the infall models presented here are perhaps unrealistic in that they assume all gas ejected by evolved stars and all infalling gas is converted into new stars ( keeping @xmath82 ) . but the dust yield @xmath53 required to produce the estimated dust mass is at the high end and the star - formation efficiency will under all circumstances be high in quasar host galaxies at high redshifts .      as argued in sect .",
    "[ dustdep ] , the presence of a galactic wind driven by sne will have roughly the same effect on the dust mass as dust destruction by sne has , thus making it even harder to obtain the high dust masses in some high-@xmath0 galaxies .",
    "however , the outflows associated with quasars may also have a totally different effect .",
    "@xcite suggested that dust may be created in broad emission line clouds associated with quasar outflows .",
    "as opposed to the gas in the ism , these gas clouds could in principle ( remains to be proven ) have both nucleation and growth of dust grains .",
    "this fact makes quasar outflows a possible source for the missing dust in models of dust formation in high-@xmath0 quasar host galaxies .",
    "the models presented here suggest the efficiency of dust production must be quite high , i.e. , a large fraction of the atomic metals in the gas must be converted into dust ( essentially all the metals in the galaxy need to be in dust in many cases , see tables in appendix [ grid ] ) .",
    "this might be a problem , since one can only have as much metals as can be produced by the stars and the total gas mass in a quasar outflow is not likely to be very large .",
    "thus quasar outflows may contribute , but the contribution can be considered negligible ( see also modelling results by * ? ? ?",
    "there is a variety of evidence for top - heavy imfs in starburst environments ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite showed that in their model lim stars contributed about 80% of the dust , using a @xcite imf , which is similiar to that of @xcite except at low masses where the @xcite imf has a smooth turn - over .",
    "but with a top - heavy imf the situation is quite different .    from observations",
    "it seems lim stars are producing significantly more dust per stellar mass than hm stars ( cf .",
    "the observed yield in table [ yields ] ) .",
    "hence , a top - heavy imf would under these circumstances result in a lower total stellar dust yield @xmath53 .",
    "if the dust production is dominated by hm stars , on the other hand , a top - heavy imf leads to a significantly increased dust production @xcite .",
    "however , a larger fraction of hm stars also increases the sn - rate , which in turn leads to more interstellar dust destruction due to sn - shocks ( see sect .",
    "[ sdss ] , fig .",
    "[ quasar_zeta ] , models 31 - 60 and 121 - 150 in appendix [ grid ] ) .",
    "but if this type of dust destruction is negligible , an initially top - heavy imf may help to boost dust production in the early universe . in general , though , a top - heavy imf means no particular improvment since ( 1 ) dust destruction due sn - shocks is expected and ( 2 ) the dust - to - metals ratio changes in an unfavourable direction ( again , see fig .",
    "[ quasar_zeta ] , where it is clear that the ratios are too low ) .",
    "stars can only produce a limited amount of dust and the time - scale of survival of dust in the ism may not be long enough . thus , there are three fundamental reasons why stellar sources probably can not explain the dust masses observed at several high-@xmath0 objects :    1 .   stellar yields must under most circumstances be close to the theoretical maximum for simple dust evolution models to be consistent with dust masses derived from observations .",
    "2 .   a top - heavy imf means no paricular improvement since the sn - rate increases and therefore the rate of dust destruction increases as well .",
    "consequently the dust - to - metals ratio changes in an unfarvourable fashion .",
    "3 .   infall of gas ( which is more likely than a closed - box scenario ) may shorten the dust - destruction time scale and therby lower the effective stellar dust production .",
    "the simple analytical models presented in this paper suggest the dust - mass problem in high-@xmath0 galaxies can not be solved by only adding the contribution from agb stars .",
    "the inclusion of agb stars by made @xcite adds new and important information , but it does not provide a complete and viable solution to the dust production problem at high redshifts .",
    "@xcite have suggested dust may be created in broad emission line clouds in an outflowing quasar wind .",
    "one may also assume dust grains can form , or at least grow , in the interstellar gas of quasar host galaxies .",
    "however , neither hypotheses can properly solve the dust production problem , because the amount of metals needed as raw - material for dust formation can not be produced by stars alone in many cases .",
    "there is essentially only two ways out of the dilemma described above , is either significant non - stellar dust production ( e.g. , growth of dust grains in the ism or dust formation associated with quasar outflows ) or signifiant systematic errors in the dust and ( molecular ) gas masses derived from observations . in a few cases it may be sufficient to assume no dust destruction , but this can not solve the problem in general .",
