    "hadron decays of the tau lepton provide a prime scenario to study the hadronization of qcd currents in an energy region settled by many resonances .",
    "this task has a twofold significance .",
    "first , the study of branching fractions and spectra of those decays is a major goal of the asymmetric b factories ( babar , belle ) .",
    "these are supplying an enormous amount of quality data owing to their large statistics , and the same is planned for the near future at tau - charm factories such as bes - iii .",
    "second , the required hadronization procedures involve qcd in a non - perturbative energy region ( @xmath12 ) and , consequently , these processes are a clean benchmark , not spoiled by an initial hadron state , where we can learn about the treatment of strong interactions when driven by resonances",
    ".    analyses of tau decay data involve matrix elements that convey the hadronization of the vector and axial - vector currents . at present",
    "there is no determination from first principles of those matrix elements as they involve strong interaction effects in its non - perturbative regime .",
    "therefore we have to rely in models that parameterize the form factors that arise from the hadronization . a relevant",
    "one is the so - called khn - santamara model ( ks ) @xcite that , essentially , relies on the construction of form factors in terms of breit - wigner functions weighted by unknown parameters that are extracted from phenomenological analyses of data .",
    "this procedure , that has proven to be successful in the description of the @xmath13 final state , has been employed in the study of many two- and three - hadron tau decays @xcite .",
    "the ambiguity related with the choice of breit - wigner functions @xcite is currently being exploited to estimate the errors in the determination of the free parameters .",
    "the measurement of the @xmath2 spectrum by the cleo collaboration @xcite has shown that the parameterization described by the ks model does not recall appropriately the experimental features keeping , at the same time , a consistency with the underlying strong interaction theory @xcite .",
    "the solution provided by cleo based in the introduction of new parameters spoils the normalization of the wess - zumino anomaly , i.e. a specific prediction of qcd . indeed ,",
    "arbitrary parameterizations are of little help in the procedure of obtaining information about non - perturbative qcd .",
    "they may fit the data but do not provide us hints on the hadronization procedures .",
    "the key point in order to uncover the inner structure of hadronization is to guide the construction of the relevant form factors with the use of known properties of qcd .",
    "the tauola library @xcite is , at present , a key tool that handles analyses of tau decay data .",
    "though originally it comprehended assorted versions of the ks model only , it has been opened to the introduction of matrix elements obtained with other models .",
    "hence it has become an excellent tool where theoretical models confront experimental data .",
    "this or analogous libraries are appropriate benchmarks where to apply the results of our research .    at very low energies ( @xmath14 , being @xmath15 the mass of the @xmath16 resonance ) the chiral symmetry of massless qcd rules the construction of an effective field theory that allows a perturbative expansion in momenta ( @xmath17 ) and light quark masses ( @xmath18 ) , as @xmath19 , being @xmath20 the scale that breaks the chiral symmetry ; here @xmath21 is the pion mass and @xmath22 is the decay constant of the pion .",
    "indeed chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath23 ) @xcite drives the hadronization of qcd currents into the lightest multiplet of pseudoscalar mesons , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the application of this framework to the study of pion decays of the tau lepton was carried out in ref .",
    "@xcite though , obviously , it can only describe a tiny region of the available phase space .",
    "it is clear that , whatever the structure given to the form factors in the region of resonances , it should match the chiral constraint in its energy domain .",
    "in fact the parameterizations with breit - wigner functions that are at the center of the ks model fail to fulfill that condition already at @xmath27 in the chiral expansion @xcite .",
    "our knowledge of qcd in the energy region of the resonances is pretty poor .",
    "contrarily to the very low energy domain , we do not know how to construct a dual effective field theory of strong interactions for @xmath28 .",
    "there is a tool , though , that could shed light on the appropriate structure of a lagrangian theory that we could use .",
    "this is yielded by the large-@xmath29 limit of @xmath30 qcd @xcite , which introduces an expansion in inverse powers of the number of colours @xmath29 . the essential idea relevant for our goal that comes out from that setting",
    "is that at leading order in the expansion , i.e. @xmath31 , any amplitude is given by the tree level diagrams generated by a local lagrangian with an spectrum of infinite zero - width states .",
    "this frame , as we will see , can be used to establish a starting point in the study of the hadron resonance region and , consequently , in the hadron decays of the tau lepton .",
    "the setting recalls the role of the resonance chiral theory @xcite that can be better understood in the light of the large-@xmath29 limit @xcite .    at high energies ( @xmath32 ) , where the light - flavoured continuum is reached",
    ", perturbative qcd is the appropriate framework to deal with the description of strong interaction of partons . in particular ,",
    "a well known feature of form factors of qcd currents is their smooth behaviour at high transfer of momenta @xcite , thus it is reasonable to expect that the form factors match this behaviour above the energy region of the resonances .",
    "another related tool is the study of the operator product expansion ( ope ) of green functions of qcd currents that are order parameters of the chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "it is possible to evaluate these green functions within a resonance theory , and then perform a matching with their leading term of the ope expansion at high transfers of momenta  @xcite . in general ,",
    "the information coming from high energies is important to settle a resonance lagrangian .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that the effective couplings collect information coming from the energy region above the resonances , hence the described procedure should help to determine the corresponding coupling constants . indeed , this approach has proven to be capable of that task @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we considered all mentioned steps in order to analyse the @xmath33 hadron final state in the decay of the tau lepton . here",
    "we continue that undertaking by considering the @xmath2 channels that , as mentioned above , do not fit well within the ks model and the present tauola setup .",
    "contrarily to the @xmath33 final state , which is dominated by the hadronization of the axial - vector current , @xmath34 decays receive contributions from both vector and axial - vector currents . indeed , one of the goals of our work is to find out the relative weight of those contributions .",
    "fortunately we will be assisted in this task by the recent analysis of @xmath35 cross - section by babar @xcite where a separation between isoscalar and isovector channels has been performed .",
    "hence we will be able to connect both processes through cvc .    in section",
    "2 we introduce the observables to be considered and the framework settled by the procedure sketched above . then the amplitudes for @xmath2 decay channels are evaluated in section  3 .",
    "an analysis of how we can get information on the resonance couplings appearing in the hadronization of the currents is performed in section  4 .",
    "finally we explain our results in section  5 , and our conclusions are pointed out in section  6 .",
    "four technical appendices complete our exposition .",
    "the hadronization of the currents that rule semileptonic tau decays is driven by non - perturbative qcd . as mentioned in the introduction",
    ", our methodology stands on the construction of an action , with the relevant degrees of freedom , led by the chiral symmetry and the known asymptotic behaviour of form factors and green functions driven by large @xmath29 qcd .",
    "we will limit ourselves to those pieces of the action that are relevant for the study of decays of the tau lepton into three pseudoscalar mesons .",
    "hence we will need to include both even- and odd - intrinsic parity sectors .",
    "the large @xmath29 expansion of @xmath30 qcd implies that , in the @xmath36 limit , the study of green functions of qcd currents can be carried out through the tree level diagrams of a lagrangian theory that includes an infinite spectrum of non - decaying states @xcite .",
    "hence the study of the resonance energy region can be performed by constructing such a lagrangian theory .",
    "the problem is that we do not know how to implement an infinite spectrum in a model - independent way .",
    "however , it is well known from the phenomenology that the main role is always played by the lightest resonances .",
    "accordingly it was suggested in refs .",
    "@xcite that one can construct a suitable effective lagrangian involving the lightest nonets of resonances and the octet of goldstone bosons states ( @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 ) .",
    "this is indeed an appropriate tool to handle the hadron decays of the tau lepton .",
    "the guiding principle in the construction of such a lagrangian is chiral symmetry .",
    "when resonances are integrated out from the theory , i.e. one tries to describe the energy region below such states ( @xmath14 ) , the remaining setting is that of @xmath37pt , to which now we turn .",
    "the very low - energy strong interaction in the light quark sector is known to be ruled by the @xmath38 chiral symmetry of massless qcd implemented in @xmath37pt . the leading even - intrinsic - parity @xmath39 lagrangian , which carries the information of the spontaneous symmetry breaking of the theory , is  : @xmath40 where @xmath41 \\ , \\nonumber \\\\",

    "the goldstone octet of pseudoscalar fields @xmath43 is realized non ",
    "linearly into the unitary matrix in the flavour space @xmath44 which under chiral rotations transforms as @xmath45 with @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "external hermitian matrix fields @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath17 promote the global @xmath51 symmetry to a local one .",
    "thus , interactions with electroweak bosons can be accommodated through the vector @xmath52 and axial  vector @xmath53 fields .",
    "the scalar field @xmath50 incorporates explicit chiral symmetry breaking through the quark masses taking @xmath54 , with @xmath55 and , finally , at lowest order in the chiral expansion @xmath56  mev is the pion decay constant and @xmath57 .",
    "the leading action in the odd - intrinsic - parity sector arises at @xmath58 .",
    "this is given by the chiral anomaly @xcite and explicitly stated by the wess - zumino - witten @xmath59 $ ] functional that can be read in ref .",
    "this contains all anomalous contributions to electromagnetic and semileptonic meson decays .",
    "it is well known @xcite that higher orders in the chiral expansion , i.e.  even - intrinsic - parity @xmath60 with @xmath61 , bring in the information of heavier degrees of freedom that have been integrated out , for instance resonance states . as",
    "our next step intends to include the latter explicitly , to avoid double counting issues we will not consider higher orders in @xmath37pt . as we comment below , in order to fulfill this procedure at least , up to @xmath58 it is convenient to use the antisymmetric tensor representation for the @xmath62 fields .",
    "analogously , additional odd - intrinsic - parity amplitudes arise at @xmath63 in @xmath37pt , either from one - loop diagrams using one vertex from the wess - zumino - witten action or from tree - level operators @xcite .",
    "however we will assume that the latter are fully generated by resonance contributions @xcite and , therefore , will not be included in the following .",
    "the formulation of a lagrangian theory that includes both the octet of goldstone mesons and @xmath64 nonets of resonances is carried out through the construction of a phenomenological lagrangian @xcite where chiral symmetry determines the structure of the operators . given",

    "notwithstanding those form factors are given , in the @xmath66 decays , by a four - point green function where other quantum numbers might play a role , namely scalar and pseudoscalar resonances @xcite .",
    "however their contribution should be minor for @xmath67 .",
    "indeed the lightest scalar limit , the nonet of scalars corresponding to the @xmath68 is not considered .",
    "this multiplet is generated by rescattering of the ligthest pseudoscalars and then subleading in the @xmath1 expansion .",
    "] , namely @xmath69 , couples dominantly to two pions , and therefore its role in the @xmath70 final state should be negligible .",
    "heavier flavoured or unflavoured scalars and pseudoscalars are at least suppressed by their masses , being heavier than the axial - vector meson @xmath71 ( like @xmath72 that couples to @xmath73 ) .",
    "in addition the couplings of unflavoured states to @xmath74 ( scalars ) and @xmath70 ( pseudoscalars ) seem to be very small @xcite .",
    "thus in our description we include @xmath62 resonances only , and this is done by considering a nonet of fields @xcite  : @xmath75 where @xmath76 , stands for vector and axial - vector resonance states . under the @xmath77 chiral group , @xmath78 transforms as  : @xmath79 the flavour structure of the resonances is analogous to that of the goldstone bosons in eq .",

    "in fact it is necessary to use this representation if one does not include the @xmath87 in the lagrangian theory .",
