    "symbiotic stars are interacting binary systems formed by a red giant star and a hot source ( in most cases a white dwarf ) that ionizes the stellar wind from the cool component .",
    "they can be divided in three different infrared types , d , d@xmath8 and s , that are related to the nature of the cool giant in the system , orbital separation and physical conditions in the emitting nebulae ( see mikolajewska 1997 ) .",
    "the number of currently identified symbiotics is much smaller than the predicted one .",
    "the catalog of belczyski et al .",
    "( 2000 ) contains 173 galactic symbiotics , while the predicted number ranges from 3@xmath910@xmath10 to 4@xmath910@xmath11 ( allen 1984 ; kenyon et al .",
    "1993 ; munari & renzini 1992 ; magrini et al .",
    "recently , several surveys have discovered new symbiotic stars increasing their number .",
    "corradi et al .",
    "( 2008 , 2010 ) and rodrguez - flores et al .",
    "( 2014 ) discovered 12 s - type and 4 d - type new symbiotics by combining the iphas survey and the position of the candidate stars in the 2mass color - color diagram .",
    "miszalski et al . (",
    "2013 ) used the supercosmos h@xmath2 survey ( shs ) ( parker et al . 2005 ) , selected h@xmath2 emission candidates towards the galactic bulge , and discovered 13 s - type , 6 d - type , and 1 d@xmath8-type new symbiotics .",
    "miszalski & mikolajewska ( 2014 ) , also based on the shs catalogue , found 11 s - type and 1 d - type new symbiotics in the southern hemisphere .",
    "therefore , a total of 48 new symbiotic stars have been added to the 173 previously known ones .    among s - type symbiotic stars ,",
    "there is a group known as `` yellow type symbiotics '' in which the cool component is a k - type star rather than an m - type giant .",
    "yellow symbiotics are useful objects to probe whether mass transfer has taken place in the past of these binary systems",
    ". the atmosphere of the k - type component of yellow symbiotics will be free from the strong molecular opacities due to tio , cn and c@xmath12 absorption features that are present in the s - type symbiotics with an m - type giant , thereby enabling the determination of stellar abundances based on atomic lines .",
    "studies of chemical abundances in yellow symbiotics indeed show that these stars are enriched in s - process elements .",
    "because these stars are not luminous enough to be self - enriched in s - process elements , the observed enrichment can be attributed to mass transfer from the former agb star ( now the white dwarf ) of the system ( see smith et al 1996 , 1997 ; pereira & roig 2009 )",
    ". therefore , yellow symbiotics are valuable objects to test models of agb nucleosynthesis ( busso et al . 2001 ) .",
    "however , they are very rare objects : only 12 galactic yellow symbiotics are included in the catalogue of belczyski et al .",
    "( 2000 ) that represent only @xmath5 5.4% of the total number of 221 s - type symbiotics identified to date ( see above )",
    ". moreover , yellow symbiotics are members of the field galactic halo population ( schmid & nussbaumer 1993 ; jorissen 2003 ) .",
    "therefore , there is not a specific galactic direction where they can be surveyed and , in consequence , are very difficult to find . in fact , among the @xmath5 3.6 million stellar spectra obtained with the lamost survey ,",
    "only one new yellow symbiotic was found : lamost j12280490 - 014825.7 , a k3 star with a high radial velocity and at high galactic latitude ( li et al .",
    "2015 ) , similarly to some yellow symbiotics previously analyzed ( pereira & roig 2009 ) .    due to the rarity of these objects and absence of a particular galactic location , surveys to search for new yellow symbiotics were inhibited in the past . however , baella ( 2012 ) showed that combining their infrared properties and emission spectrum , yellow symbiotics are located in a particular region of the 2mass color - color diagram .",
    "this led to the discovery of ss383 as our first candidate yellow symbiotic that has been identified following the criteria above mentioned ( baella et al .",
    "2013 , hereafter bpm13 ) .",
    "in this work we report further spectroscopic results of our survey specifically dedicated to search and to identify new yellow symbiotics .",
    "our major result is the identification of sth@xmath263 as a new yellow symbiotic star .",
    "the selection of the candidates followed the same method as we applied for the identification of ss383 as a new candidate yellow symbiotic star ( bpm13 ) .",
    "basically our method rely on the two observed properties of the yellow symbiotic stars , the emission - line spectrum and the k - type continuum .",
    "it was already well stablished that symbiotics occupy particular regions in the 2mass @xmath13 _ versus _ @xmath14 diagram ( phillips 2007 ; corradi et al .",
    "2008 , 2010 ) .",
    "furthermore , baella ( 2012 ) showed that , after reddening correction , yellow symbiotics are clustered around @xmath14 @xmath5 0.2 and @xmath13 @xmath5 0.8 because their positions in the two color diagram are mainly determined by the k - type component and they are clearly separated from s - type symbiotics with m - type components . by using the emission line catalogs of stephenson & sanduleak ( 1977 ) , stephenson ( 1986 ) , schwartz , persson & hamamm ( 1990 ) and kohoutek & wehmeyer ( 1997 ) we have identified five more stars that are located in the region of yellow symbiotics of the 2mass color - color diagram and , therefore , are good candidates to be yellow symbiotics .",
    "table 1 lists the candidates and figure 1 show their position in the @xmath13 _ versus _ @xmath14 diagram .",
    "to determine the corresponding reddening value for each object , we used the galactic dust reddening and extinction service of irsa ( infrared science archive ) : http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/applications/dust/ to obtain the `` e(b - v ) reddening '' values , and converted e(b - v ) to a(j ) , a(h ) , and a(ks ) extinctions using the relationships given by bilir et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , which are used to draw the corresponding reddening vectors in figure1 .",
    "in particular , for sth@xmath263 we used a mean e(b - v)=0.14 ( schlafly & finkbeiner 2011 ; schlegel et al .",
    "1998 ) , and obtained a(j - h)=0.05 and a(h - ks)=0.03 .",
    "spectroscopic observations of the five targets in table 1 were performed on 2013 and 2014 with the cassegrain twin spectrograph ( twin ) attached to the 3.5 m telescope of the calar alto observatory ( spain ) , and with the goodman spectrograph attached to the 4.1 m telescope of the soar observatory ( chile ) .",
    "table 1 also includes the date of observations and the used spectrograph .",
    "twin includes two separate spectroscopic channels ( blue and red ) behind the common entrance slit aperture .",
    "the detectors were a site ccd 22b in the blue channel and a site ccd 20b in the red channel .",
    "we used gratings t08 ( blue ) and t04 ( red ) to cover the spectral ranges 32005800 and 55007600 , respectively , at a spectral resolution of 1.08pixel@xmath15 in both channels .",
    "the slit was oriented east  west and its width was 2@xmath16 .",
    "the goodman spectrograph was used with the farchild ccd 486 and three gratings : blue , mid , and red mode , covering the spectral ranges 35506300 , 45007250 , and 64009150 . respectively , at a spectral resolution of 0.65pixel@xmath15 in the three spectral ranges .",
    "the slit was oriented north  south and its width was 1@xmath16 .",
    "spectra of each target were obtained with several exposure times between 15 and 1200 seconds , the short exposures to avoid saturation of possibly strong emission lines ( e.g. , h@xmath2 ) , the long exposures to detected faint emission lines .",
    "the spectra were reduced using standard iraf tasks , from bias subtraction and flat - field correction , through spectral extraction and wavelength and flux calibration .",
    "spectrophotometric standards from massey et al .",
    "( 1988 ) and hamuy et al .",
    "( 1994 ) were also observed with the same instrumental configuration before and after the objects for flux calibration .",
    "figure 2 presents the spectrum of sth@xmath263 and table 2 lists the observed fluxes of the identified emission lines .",
    "the spectrum of sth@xmath263 shows recombination balmer , hei , and he ii@xmath174686 emission lines , and forbidden [ o iii]@xmath174363,4959,5007 emission lines .",
    "the absorption spectrum presents the tio bands at 6200 , 7125 , and 7160 , and absorption lines due to fei at 4202,5227,5269,5227,5415 , cai at 4226 , mgi at 5183 , cri at 5206 , nai at 5890 , and a strong absorption around 6500 that is due to contributions of several strong absorption lines of fei at 6494,6496 , baii at 6497 , and cai at 6499 .",
    "the spectrum clearly points to a symbiotic nature for sth@xmath263 .",
    "moreover , the spectrum is very similar to that of the yellow symbiotic cd-43@xmath1814304 with a k7 spectral type ( schmid & nussbaumer 1993 ; pereira et al .",
    "1999 ; mrset & schmid 1999 ) , and to that of the candidate yellow symbiotic ss383 with a spectral type k7m0 ( bpm13 ) .",
    "these similarities strongly suggest a k spectral type for sth@xmath263 and , in consequence , that sth@xmath263 is a yellow symbiotic .    to obtain a more precise estimate for the spectral type of sth@xmath263 we proceeded as we did for ss383",
    ": we measure the quantitative tio indexes ( kenyon & fernndez - castro 1987 ) and put sth@xmath263 in the [ tio]@xmath19[tio]@xmath12 diagram .",
    "figure 3 shows the position of sth@xmath263 in this diagram , which lies between those of ag dra and tv cvn , two stars with spectral types k4iii and k5.3iii , respectively ( kenyon & fernndez - castro 1987 ) . therefore , we estimate a spectral type between k4 and k6 for sth@xmath263 that confirms the yellow symbiotic nature of the object",
    ".    some physical parameters of sth@xmath263 , such as the color excess @xmath20 , optical depth in h@xmath2 ( @xmath21 ) , electron density ( @xmath22 ) , and infrared type based on hei line intensity ratios can be obtained directly from the observed spectrum . to obtain these parameters",
    "we follow the same basic procedures as outlined in bpm13 ( see also gutirrez - moreno & moreno 1996 , and proga et al .",
    "table 3 shows the results .",
    "the electron density derived from the [ oiii ] emission lines intensity ratio is @xmath23 @xmath5 8.4 ( see table 3 ) , a value that is typical of s - type symbiotics ( @xmath23 @xmath5 810 ) but larger than the values found in d - type symbiotics ( @xmath23 @xmath5 67 , e.g. , schmid & schild 1990 ; mikolajeska & kenyon 1992 ) . as for the infrared ( d or s ) type ( proga et al . 1994 ) , the line ratios @xmath24 and @xmath25 corrected for reddening are 0.31 and 0.78 , respectively .",
    "the value of the @xmath24 ratio is not typical for s - type symbiotics according to proga et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , although pu vul investigated in their sample also presents a similar ratio of 0.30 .",
    "the @xmath26 intensity ratio in sth@xmath263 is similar to that observed in the yellow symbiotic ag dra ( proga et al .",
    "1994 ) .",
    "finally , our spectrum allow us to analyze the position of sth@xmath263 in the [ oiii]5007/h@xmath27 _ versus _ [ o iii]4363/h@xmath28 diagnostic diagram that was previously used in our studies of planetary nebulae ( pereira & miranda 2005 ; pereira et al .",
    "2010 ) and of the yellow symbiotic ss383 ( bpm13 ) .",
    "the line intensity ratios ( see table 2 ) place sth@xmath263 in the region of the diagram occupied by s - type symbiotics ( see bpm13 , their figure5 ) thus further reinforcing our conclusion of the symbiotic nature for this object .",
    "figure 4 presents the spectra of the four candidates in table 1 that were rejected as symbiotics either due to the absence of emission lines or , when present , because they were not the appropriate ones to classify the star as a symbiotic .",
    "noticeably , [ kw97 ] 37 - 26 , [ kw97 ] 61 - 27 , and sth@xmath2116 do not show the h@xmath2 emission line even though the are included in h@xmath2 emission - line star catalogs ( see macconnel 1981 ; stephenson 1986 ; kohoutek & wehmeyer 1999 ) . in the cases of [ kw97 ] 61 - 27 and",
    "sth@xmath2116 we note that these two stars are characterized by very strong tio absorption bands ( figure 4 ) that produce an `` apparent emission peak '' around 6540 , bluewards the position of h@xmath2 , which may be confused with the h@xmath2 emission line in very low resolution ( objective - prism ) spectra .",
    "only ss360 , discovered as an emission - line star by stephenson & sanduleak ( 1977 ) , presents balmer emission lines .",
    "however , the other typical emission lines of symbiotics ( e.g. , [ oiii ] ) are absent , discarding a symbiotic classification .",
    "the spectrum of [ kw97 ] 37 - 26 ( = [ m81 ] i-734=bd+00@xmath184203 ) is very similar to those of hd1069 and hd26946 with k2i and k3iii spectral types , respectively ( jacoby et al . 1984 ) , if we apply to these two stars a reddening of 1.4 as used in figure 1 for [ kw97 ] 37 - 26 .",
    "this points out that [ kw97 ] 37 - 26 is an early k supergiant or giant star .",
    "a more precise classification is not possible because our spectra do not cover the oxygen line at 7774 , the calcium infrared triplet and/or the cn band at 7925 that are useful spectral features to discriminate among supergiants , giants and dwarf stars ( see pereira & miranda 2007 ) .",
    "the spectra of sth@xmath2116 ( = bd+14@xmath182953 ) and [ kw97 ] 61 - 27 are similar to that of sao 21753 , a k7iii star , whereas the spectrum of ss360 is similarities to that of the m3iii star sao63340 ( see jacoby et al .",
    "1984 for the spectra of the used comparison stars ) .",
    "as shown above , ss360 fullfils the two criteria used by us to select candidate yellow symbiotics but its spectrum rules out this classification .",
    "this suggests to look for additional constraints for a better selection of candidates .",
    "we have explored the data provided in the wise ( wide - field infrared survey explorer ) archive .",
    "the wise satellite scanned the whole sky in the 3.4 , 4.6 , 12 , and 22@xmath29 m bands ( wright et al . 2010 ) commonly named w1 , w2 , w3 and w4 , respectively .",
    "we used the w3w4 ( w34 ) index and created five histograms to analyze the possibility of distinguishing true s - type yellow symbiotics stars among the candidate objects in figure 1 .",
    "figure 5 shows these five histograms .",
    "histogram a presents a sample of about 340 k - giant stars with effective temperature between 3700 and 5200k ( hekker & melndez 2007 ) .",
    "it shows that the probability of finding k - giant stars with w34 @xmath30 0.4 is very low .",
    "histogram b presents the distribution of s - type symbiotic stars from belczynski et al .",
    "these objects cover the entire range of w34 values in the figure , although there is a small increase of the number of s - type symbiotics in the w34 0.40.8 range .",
    "this could be an indication that s - type symbiotics have an emission excess between 12@xmath29 m and 22@xmath29 m . to check this possibility",
    ", histogram c shows a sub - sample of objects of histogram b , namely , those s - type symbiotics that contain giant stars with effective temperatures higher than 3500k ; these symbiotics present w34 values higher than 0.4 .",
    "it is worth noting that effective temperatures higher than @xmath5 3500k are required for yellow symbiotics .",
    "histogram d shows a sample of nine true s - type yellow symbiotics .",
    "remarkably , they all have w34 @xmath30 0.4 , indicating that the difference between s - type yellow symbiotics and `` normal '' k - giants ( without symbiotic activity ) is the w34 value .",
    "this is probably due to the presence of a dust shell in true s - type yellow symbiotics .",
    "the dust shell could add an excess of emission between 12@xmath29 m and 22@xmath29 m , that is revealed through the w34 index that appears as an useful tool to distinguish between yellow symbiotic and `` normal '' k - giants .    to investigate these results further",
    ", we construct the histogram e with the five objects of table 1 and ss383 ( bpm13 ) .",
    "only ss383 and sth@xmath263 have w34 @xmath30 0.4 , which is compatible with the yellow symbiotic classification for sth@xmath263 , and provides further support for a yellow symbiotic nature of the candidate ss383 .",
    "moreover , ss360 has w34 @xmath5 0.21 and , therefore , it is not located in the region of yellow symbiotics , in agreement with its non - yellow symbiotic nature stablished above , even though it is an emission - line star and its position on the 2mass two color diagram favors such a classification . from these findings , we conclude that the w34 index can be used as a useful tool to identify candidate yellow symbiotics , in combination with emission - line star catalogs and the 2mass color - color diagram .",
    "in this work we presented spectroscopic observations of five emission - line stars that are candidates for yellow symbiotics on the basis of their position in the 2mass color - color diagram . only one of them , sth@xmath263 , has been positively identified as a new yellow symbiotic .",
    "its spectrum and position in the [ tio]@xmath19-[tio]@xmath12 diagram indicates a spectral type between k4 and k6 .",
    "in addition , hei emission line ratios , derived electron density , and position in the [ oiii]5007/h@xmath27 _ versus _ [ oiii]4363/h@xmath28 diagram provide further support for the yellow symbiotic nature of sth@xmath263 .",
    "the other four candidates are rejected as symbiotics because three of them do not show emission lines ( although they were classified as emission - line stars ) or one shows only balmer emission lines .",
    "our survey for yellow symbiotics based on their particular position in the 2mass color - color diagram and four emission - line star catalogs raised only six candidates ( ss383 and the five stars analyzed in this work ) .",
    "this small number is not surprising given the rarity of yellow symbiotics .",
    "two of them ( ss383 and sth@xmath263 ) have been identified as new yellow symbiotics , which provides strong support to our method of target selection .",
    "the success of this survey becomes more clear if one takes into account that three of the six selected objects were erroneously classified as emission - line stars .",
    "we used the wise archive to explore the possibility of distinguishing yellow symbiotic stars .",
    "we found that yellow symbiotics have a w3w4 ( w34 ) index @xmath30 0.4 and are clearly separated from `` normal '' k - giant stars .",
    "therefore , the w34 index is an useful tool to improve the selection of candidate yellow symbiotics .",
