    "the @xmath0 meson introduced by schwinger @xcite and gell - mann ",
    "levy @xcite has attracted great interest because there are good reasons to consider it as the higgs boson of strong interaction , an aspect which recently has been emphasized by several authors @xcite . the mass of the @xmath0 meson is predicted by the quark - level linear @xmath0 model ( qll@xmath0 m ) @xcite ( see also @xcite and references therein ) to be @xmath6 mev , whereas @xmath7-@xmath7 scattering analyses led to @xmath8 with @xmath9 mev and @xmath10 mev in one recent evaluation ( ccl)@xcite , or @xmath11 mev when tests of the stability of fits to data are taken into account @xcite .",
    "it certainly is extremely important to understand how these two masses are related to each other .",
    "the finding is that @xmath1 mev is the bare mass of the @xmath0 meson which is observed in space - like compton scattering @xmath3 , i.e. as a @xmath4-channel pole of compton scattering @xmath5 . for the electromagnetic polarizabilities",
    "space - like compton scattering is equally important as time - like compton scattering @xmath12 ( @xmath13-channel ) .",
    "the @xmath0 and non-@xmath0 components of the electromagnetic polarizabilities for the proton @xmath14 and the neutron @xmath15 are @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 in units of @xmath21 @xmath22 . on the quark level",
    "the reaction @xmath23 implies that two photons with parallel planes of linear polarization interact with @xmath0 mesons , being parts of the constituent quarks . in this sense",
    "it is justified to consider space - like compton scattering as an in - situ observation of the higgs boson of strong interaction .",
    "in addition to the specific aspects of the @xmath0 meson as outlined in the preceding paragraph this particle is of interest because it has been observed as an intermediate state in many reactions @xcite .",
    "therefore , there is no doubt that this particle exists and that it belongs to a scalar nonet ( @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 ) below 1 gev .",
    "a problem may appear due to the fact that there is also a scalar nonet above 1 gev .",
    "this has led to the assumption that the scalar nonet above 1 gev should be understood as @xmath28 states whereas the scalar nonet below 1 gev should be understood as @xmath29 states ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "other versions consider meson molecules and gluonic components ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it is hard to see that strict criteria can be found giving proof of the validity of one model and excluding the validity of an other .",
    "the best way to proceed is to start with a model for the low - mass scalar mesons where @xmath28 is a @xmath30 core state which may couple to other hadronic or gluonic configurations @xcite .",
    "then the essential properties as e.g. the two - photon width @xmath31 may be understood in terms of the @xmath28 core whereas other components may show up in hadronic reactions where scalar mesons appear as intermediate states .",
    "the present work is a continuation of a systematic series of studies @xcite on the electromagnetic structure of the nucleon , following experimental work on compton scattering and a comprehensive review on this topic @xcite .",
    "these recent investigations have shown @xcite that a systematic study of all partial resonant and nonresonant photo - excitation processes of the nucleon and of their relevance for the fundamental structure constants of the nucleon as there are the electric polarizability ( @xmath32 ) , the magnetic polarizability ( @xmath33 ) and the backward spin - polarizability ( @xmath34 ) is essential for an understanding of the electromagnetic structure of the nucleon .",
    "in addition it has been found that the structure of the constituent quarks and their coupling to pseudoscalar and scalar mesons is important for the understanding of the electric and magnetic polarizabilities and of the backward spin - polarizability .",
    "the main purpose of the present work is to prove that the method of calculating the @xmath4-channel contribution from the reaction @xmath3 where the properties of the @xmath0 meson are taken from the qll@xmath0 m is a precise procedure and largely superior to previous approaches where the combination of the two reactions @xmath35 and @xmath3 is exploited .",

    "the third variable @xmath97 is not taken into account because of the constraint given in ( [ 4 ] ) .",
    "the degrees of freedom of the nucleon including the structure of the constituent quarks enter into the invariant amplitudes via a cut on the real axis of the complex @xmath13-plane and in terms of pointlike singularities on the positive real axis of the @xmath4-plane .",
    "the @xmath13-channel cut contains the total photoabsorption cross section and through a decomposition in terms of excitation mechanisms the complete electromagnetic structure of the nucleon as seen in one - photon processes .",
    "the pointlike singularities on the positive real @xmath4-axis may be related to the structure of the constituent quarks which couple to all mesons with a nonzero meson - quark coupling constant . of these the @xmath98 and",
    "the @xmath0 meson are of special interest . on the one hand",
    "they couple to two photons with perpendicular and parallel planes of linear polarization , respectively , and on the other hand they enter into the qll@xmath0 m as described in section [ thedynamical ] . in a formal sense the singularities on the positive real @xmath4-axis correspond to the fusion of two photons with 4-momenta @xmath99 and @xmath100 and helicities @xmath101 and @xmath102 to form a @xmath4-channel intermediate state @xmath103 or @xmath104 from which  in a second step  a proton - antiproton pair is created .",
