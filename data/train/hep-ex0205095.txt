    "the standard model ( sm ) higgs boson is expected to be produced at lep mainly via associated production with a z boson , with small contributions from the w- and z - fusion processes .",
    "for this reason the production cross - section is expected to have a threshold behaviour at @xmath4 . for a 115 gev/@xmath2 higgs the production cross - section",
    "is expected to be about 60 fb at @xmath5=207 gev , corresponding to 30 signal events produced in the entire lep year 2000 data sample .",
    "a 115 gev/@xmath2 higgs boson decays mainly into @xmath6 final state ( br=74@xmath3 ) , other hadronic final states ( gg , @xmath7 , br=11 @xmath3 ) , @xmath8 ( br=7@xmath3 ) and w@xmath9w@xmath9 ( br=7@xmath3 ) .",
    "the final states that are searched for at lep are : the 4-jet final state where the higgs decays into @xmath6 and the z into @xmath10 , the missing - energy final state where the higgs decays into @xmath6 and the z into @xmath11 , the leptonic final state where the higgs decays into @xmath6 and the z into @xmath12 ( with @xmath13 or e ) and the @xmath14 final state where either the higgs or the z decays into @xmath8 .    of these channels the 4-jet has the largest sensitivity followed by the missing - energy , the leptonic and the @xmath8 .",
    "the b - tag is the main tool used to reject the background coming from other sm processes .",
    "this variable is very useful in the reduction of the ww , zz and @xmath10 backgrounds .",
    "other kinematic variables related to the production and decay of the scalar higgs boson are used in the selection ( i.e. , the production angle of the selected higgs candidate , the angle between the reconstructed jets , etc . ) .",
    "in addition to these variables the reconstructed higgs boson mass is used to reduce the background that is not compatible with the tested higgs boson mass hypothesis .    the method adopted by the four lep experiments consists in computing the statistical compatibility of the selected sample ( after a loose pre - selection ) with the two following hypothesis : the presence of the signal with mass @xmath15 ( referred to as @xmath16 hypothesis ) or the compatibility with the expected background ( referred to as @xmath17 hypothesis ) .",
    "this is done by means of a test statistics which takes into account the distributions of the reconstructed mass , used as the first discriminating variable , and of all the other selection variables , combined with neural - network ( nn ) or likelihood ( l ) techniques in the second discriminating variable .",
    "the test statistics used at lep is the likelihood - ratio ( lr)@xcite , the ratios of the likelihood of the selected samples being compatible with @xmath16 and @xmath17 hypothesis . for each tested higgs boson mass the confidence level of the observed test statistics being compatible with the two hypotheses",
    "are computed : cl@xmath18 and cl@xmath19 .",
    "signal like results will be characterised by very small values of ( 1-cl@xmath19 ) and by an average value of cl@xmath18 of 0.5 .",
    "background like results are characterised by small values of cl@xmath18 ( depending on the sensitivity to the tested mass hypothesis ) and by an average value of cl@xmath19 of 0.5 .",
    "the results reported here are based on about 2.5 fb@xmath0 of data collected by the four lep experiments at @xmath5 ranging from 189 to 209 gev .",
    "the most relevant sample is given by the 542 pb@xmath0 of data collected in year 2000 at @xmath20 gev .",
    "the combination is based on the results reported in refs .",
    "@xcite and described by the lep - higgs working group in @xcite . of these publications",
    "only the l3 one is final .",
    "the aleph collaboration has published in ref .",
    "@xcite its final findings that will be included in the ultimate lep combination .",
    "the outline of this paper is the following . in section two",
    "the combined lep results are presented . in section three a more detailed discussion of the systematic uncertainties",
    "in section four the most recent update from the aleph collaboration is reported .",
    "conclusions are drawn in section five .",
    "the lep combined lr as a function of the higgs mass hypothesis is shown in fig .",
    "the test statistics has a broad minimum around 115.6 gev/@xmath2 compatible with what is expected for an higgs boson with that mass ( cl@xmath18=0.44 ) .",
    "the compatibility with the @xmath17 hypothesis at that mass is of 3.4@xmath3 ( i.e. , a 2@xmath1 effect ) .",
    "the excess is mainly originating from the aleph 4-jet channel as can be seen in tables [ t1 ] and [ t2 ] where the values of cl@xmath18 and ( 1-cl@xmath19 ) are given for the four lep experiments and for the different channels separately .    0.1 in    .",
    "_ values of the combined cl@xmath18 and ( 1-cl@xmath19 ) for the four lep experiments and for an higgs mass hypothesis of 115.6 gev/@xmath2 .",
    "_ [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ t3 ]    these uncertainties are already included in the confidence levels quoted above by using the method described in@xcite .",
    "if these errors were added in quadrature a total change in the excess significance of less then 0.2@xmath1 would be obtained .",
    "this confirms the preliminary systematic uncertainty estimated in  @xcite .",
    "since the combined lep result is driven by the aleph 4-jet channel and since the final aleph publication confirms the findings of the preliminary results , the final lep combination is not expected to change drastically with respect to the results reported in section 2 .",
    "final lep results are expected by the summer 2002 .",
    "a preliminary combination of the lep results on the standard model higgs search shows a slight deviation from the @xmath17 hypothesis at the 2@xmath1 level ( 1-cl@xmath21 ) .",
    "a closer view to this effect shows that it mainly originates from the aleph 4-jet channel .",
    "this result is compatible with what expected for a sm higgs boson with a mass of 115.6 gev/@xmath2 and is robust against systematics uncertainties on the expected background , as described in the preliminary publications of the four lep experiments and as confirmed by the final aleph publication  @xcite .",
    "a final clarification on the nature of the observed effect should come from the hadron colliders tevatron and lhc .    by putting together the indirect constraints , coming from the electroweak fit to the sm observable measured at lep  @xcite ( with relevant contribution also from sld , tevatron and nutev ) , with the direct search results , the sm higgs boson mass is constrained in the range between 114 and 196 gev/@xmath2 at 95@xmath3 cl .",
    "this represents an enormous improvement on the knowledge of this fundamental observable with respect to the pre - lep era .",
    "i would like to thank all the members of the lep higgs working group , fabiola gianotti and roberto tenchini for the help that they gave me in the preparation of this talk .",
    "i also would like to thank the organisers of the conference for the high quality of the program , the wonderful organisation and the beautiful atmosphere in which this conference has been held ."
