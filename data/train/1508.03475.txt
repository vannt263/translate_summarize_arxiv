    "<S> these are the layered undoped cuprates la@xmath0cuo@xmath1 and nd@xmath0cuo@xmath1 @xcite , and the quasi one - dimensional ( 1d ) organic mott insulators of the tcnq family @xcite , in particular et - f@xmath0tcnq @xcite which will be the focus of our study . </S>",
    "<S> both undoped cuprates and et - f@xmath0tcnq reveal ultrafast picosecond charge recombination with some similarities : ( a ) the charged carriers created by the pump pulse above the mott - hubbard ( mh ) gap are holons and doublons , and their recombination requires the distribution of a large energy quantum ( the mh gap @xmath2ev ) into several final excitations with smaller energy @xmath3 . at low density of charges candidates for recipient bosons can be spin or phonon excitations . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) the decay is exponential in time . </S>",
    "<S> this excludes bi- and higher - molecular processes involving inelastic collision of several free charge carriers , and implicitly reveals the existence of an intermediate bound state of a holon and a doublon ( the mh exciton ) . in this respect a different observation has been obtained on ca@xmath0cuo@xmath4 from the 1d cuprate family , which is known to have negligible excitonic effects @xcite and thus shows a non - exponential decay @xcite .    from a theoretical viewpoint </S>",

    "<S> the system can be described by a high - temperature state with a sufficient density of excited charges , so that the creation of particle - hole pairs in the compressible background @xcite is the dominant decay channel , and @xmath3 is set by the kinetic energy of recipient excitations , as observed also within dmft @xcite . on the other hand , in real materials </S>",
    "<S> the final effective temperature is low , @xmath7 . for the case of 2d undoped cuprates , which are antiferromagnets at low @xmath8 </S>",
    "<S> , a theory has been presented @xcite where the fast charge recombination is explained via emission of spin excitations with the spin exchange energy , @xmath9 , as the relevant excitation scale . </S>",
    "<S> strong correlations and large @xmath10 at the same time lead to a nontrivial origin of the s - type bound state of holon and doublon @xcite , i.e. the mh exciton , being the intermediate state essential for the exponential decay .    in spite of similarities with 2d mott insulators , in quasi-1d </S>",
    "<S> mott insulators the scenario involving spin - excitations can not be effective neither for the mh exciton formation nor for the multi - boson emission due to the phenomenon of charge - spin separation . in the following </S>",
    "<S> we will show that a multi - phonon emission can be a viable recombination mechanism in 1d organic mott insulators , somewhat specific to organic materials with energetic intra - molecular vibrations and strong electron - phonon coupling @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the mechanism bears similarity with recently proposed multi - phonon exciton decay in semiconducting carbon nanotubes @xcite while in standard semiconductors such a scenario seems to be inefficient @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the prerequisite is again the existence of the 1d mh exciton @xcite , which can be stable in the case of longer range coulomb repulsion . </S>",
    "<S> since the photoexcited exciton is of the odd symmetry we will show that its decay becomes allowed only due to the electron - phonon coupling . </S>",

    "<S> we first compute the exciton , i.e. , the lowest bound state in the sector with one doublon and one holon . </S>",

    "<S> virtual hoppings give rise to the spin exchange @xmath13 , however , we shall neglected it in our calculation . </S>",
    "<S> such approximation is justified by the charge - spin separation specific for 1d , which makes the scattering of charges on spins ineffective ( since the hopping of holons and doublons only shifts the spin background ) , and by the hierarchy of energy scales @xmath14 for typical organic materials .    </S>",
