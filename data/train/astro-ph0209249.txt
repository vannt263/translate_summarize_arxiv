    "gravitational lensing has been used for nearly a decade to study faint , compact masses in our galaxy .",
    "although a large number of microlensing events have been detected , the lens masses and distances can not ( in most cases ) be determined , meaning that only statistical constraints on the lensing population may be derived from lensing surveys ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the determination of the lens mass and distance in individual events would be of great utility towards elucidating the nature of the microlenses .",
    "an example of this is the claim by @xcite and @xcite that three long - duration events are likely massive black holes , with @xmath1 . since individual masses could not be measured for these events , statistical arguments were employed to support the claim for large masses .",
    "if confirmed , @xcite have argued that these black holes would represent a new , significant population of black holes roaming the galactic disk .",
    "the measurement of mass in microlensing events requires the determination of two quantities describing the event : ( 1 ) the lens - source relative parallax , @xmath2 , and ( 2 ) the angular einstein radius , @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "measurement of the parallax , @xmath2 , requires the observation of the lensing event from viewpoints separated by @xmath3 au .",
    "one way to do this is to observe the event simultaneously from the ground and from a satellite in solar orbit ; the space interferometry mission ( sim ) is currently planned to do precisely this for a number of future microlensing events .",
    "it is also possible to measure @xmath2 for long - duration events , with event timescales @xmath4few months , using the earth s motion around the sun to provide a distant vantage point .",
    "since @xmath5 of lensing events towards the bulge have durations @xmath6 longer than 100 days , with high quality photometry the parallax may be measured for a significant fraction of events .",
    "the angular einstein radius is extremely difficult to measure , since typical values are @xmath7 milliarcsecond ( hereafter mas ) , defying resolution by even the largest telescopes . in very rare cases ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it is possible to measure @xmath0 during a caustic crossing , however generically @xmath0 can not be resolved by any single - aperture instrument .",
    "resolution of sub - milliarcsecond scales typically requires long baseline interferometers , and future instruments like sim should be able to determine @xmath0 for many events @xcite using narrow - angle astrometry .",
    "unfortunately , sim will not fly until later than 2009 . before sim flies ,",
    "a number of long baseline , highly sensitive interferometers will come online , for example the keck interferometer or the very large telescope interferometer ( vlti ) .",
    "these ground - based interferometers can study microlensing events in several different ways , which we will consider in this paper .",
    "@xcite discussed how keck and vlti can measure @xmath0 using narrow - angle astrometry .",
    "@xcite have pointed out that for massive microlenses , @xmath0 becomes comparable to the resolution @xmath8 mas for @xmath9 m , @xmath10 m .",
    "this allows the study of microlensing events via the partial resolution of the lensed images .",
    "one possible method , discussed by @xcite , is the measurement of the decrement in fringe visibility as the microlensed images become resolved . in this paper",
    ", we also investigate the use of closure phase to determine the angular einstein radius @xmath0 .",
    "closure phase is free of many of the calibration issues afflicting visibility amplitude , however other concerns do arise . in the next section ,",
    "we provide a review of the basics of microlensing .",
    "the following section gives an introduction to interferometry and closure phase .",
    "we then show how closure phase may be used to measure @xmath0 , and compare our method to other proposed techniques .",
    "since both keck interferometer and vlti have already observed first fringes , this method promises to be an exciting technique for the determination of @xmath0 and thereby the lens mass , in the next few years .",
    "in this section , we will focus on the case of a single lens and single ( unresolved ) source , since this describes the vast majority of lensing events .",
    "this situation was completely analyzed by @xcite , and we follow his notation here .",
    "consider the geometry shown in fig .",
    "[ lensgeom ] .",
    "this shows a source at distance @xmath11 behind a lens at distance @xmath12 .",
    "the lens has an angular einstein radius given by @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the lens mass and @xmath15 is the distance between lens and source . if the angular impact parameter between source and lens , in units of @xmath0 , is @xmath16 , then two images are produced on the sky along the lens - source axis at positions relative to the lens of @xmath17 these images are magnified relative to the intrinsic source brightness by factors @xmath18 respectively .",
    "the total magnification is the sum of these two terms , @xmath19    in general , the lens and source exhibit finite relative proper motion , meaning that the impact parameter is a function of time .",
    "usually , the relative motion is well approximated as linear in time , and can be written @xmath20 , measuring @xmath21 with respect to the time of smallest impact parameter @xmath22 .",
    "here , @xmath23 is the event timescale , the time it takes the lens to move one angular einstein radius relative to the observer - source line of sight , and @xmath24 is the unit vector on the sky along the relative velocity .",
    "eqns .  [ x ] and [ a ] then give @xmath25 and @xmath26 as a function of time .",
    "an example is shown in fig .",
    "[ lensgeom ] .    as noted by @xcite ,",
    "the center - of - light of the two images shifts relative to the unlensed source position by @xmath27 also , note that at any given time , the separation between the two images is @xmath28 and the ratio of magnifications is @xmath29 these also become functions of time .",
    "it is apparent that the magnitude of the image motion is comparable to the angular einstein radius . for a bulge event with @xmath30 , @xmath31 kpc and @xmath32 kpc ,",
    "this is roughly @xmath33 mas , and scales like @xmath34 . in comparison ,",
    "the resolution of the hubble space telescope is @xmath35 mas , while the largest single aperture telescope ( the 10 m keck ) has a resolution using adaptive optics of roughly @xmath36 mas . to have any hope of measuring @xmath0 , multi - element interferometric arrays will be required . in the next sections we describe how",
    "interferometers may be applied towards microlensing .",
    "a stellar interferometer combines starlight from two or more apertures ; the resulting interference fringes can be used to derive a great deal of information about the source being observed , including the source location ( astrometry ) and intensity distribution ( imaging ) .      for observations with a finite bandwidth",
    "a fringe pattern will be formed when the optical pathlengths from the star , through the instrument , to the beam combination have been equalized .",
    "given an aperture separation , called the baseline @xmath37 , and a star in the direction @xmath38 it follows from simple geometry that an additional delay @xmath39 must be introduced into one of the arms of the interferometer , given by @xmath40 where @xmath41 is any additional static delay internal to the interferometer .",
    "it follows that the differential delay @xmath42 between two stars can be used to determine the angle @xmath43 between them . using laser metrology systems it is possible to measure internal delay differences at the nanometer level , which for a long baseline interferometer corresponds to astrometric precision at the micro - arcsecond level .",
    "this is the basis for interferometric astrometry , which has been demonstrated to achieve 100 micro - arcsecond precision @xcite , and is expected in the next several years to produce measurement precision approaching 10 micro - arcseconds @xcite .",
    "the practical aspects of very high precision interferometric astrometry are beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "however , the technique is quite challenging and requires a rather complex instrument design .",
    "the instruments currently being designed and built are not expected to begin operations until at least 2004 - 2005 .",
    "in addition , due to the effects of atmospheric seeing , the very highest astrometric precision is likely only attainable by space - based interferometers .",
    "the fringe pattern measured by an interferometer can be described as a complex quantity called the visibility ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "it is related to the source brightness distribution on the sky ( @xmath45 ) via @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the wavelength of observation and @xmath38 points in the direction of the source .",
    "this relation is known as the van cittert - zernike theorem @xcite . in effect , the source intensity distribution and the the fringe visibility measured by an interferometer are related via a fourier transform .    in the case of a microlensing event , as long as the individual lensed images are unresolved by the interferometer , @xmath48 can be modeled as two point sources located at @xmath49 and @xmath50 . @xmath51 defining the intensity ratio @xmath52 and @xmath53 we find @xmath54    it is useful to write this visibility in a slightly different form @xmath55 where @xmath56 the quantity @xmath57 ( or simply @xmath58 ) is usually what is measured by an optical interferometer ; it corresponds to the contrast of the observed fringes .",
    "the phase of the complex visibility is given by @xmath59 however , the phase measured by a single pair of apertures is corrupted by the effects of atmospheric turbulence on very short timescales ( in the optical and infrared @xmath60 radian in @xmath61 milliseconds ) and contains no useful information , unless it is measured simultaneously with a phase reference source  that is in fact identical to the astrometry approach discussed in the previous section .",
    "it is also important to note that @xmath58 measurements are subject to a wide variety of error sources , and that most of these errors introduce _ bias _ in the measurement @xcite .",
    "that is to say that these error sources  which can include instrument vibrations , polarization mismatch , optical alignment errors , and the blurring effects of atmospheric turbulence  tend to _ reduce _ the measured fringe visibility amplitude .",
    "this makes calibration of measured visibilities quite challenging .",
    "modern optical interferometers measure @xmath58 for one or a few baseline orientations ; the precision attained is typically a few percent @xcite and in some cases as high as 0.3 % for bright stars under favorable conditions @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , it is not clear that the new generation of large - aperture interferometers equipped with ao systems and single - mode fiber spatial fibers will be able to attain such high visibility precision @xcite .",
    "despite the phase corruption introduced by the atmosphere , it is still possible to recover limited phase information without resorting to the technically complex phase referencing method , provided one interferometrically combines at least three apertures .",
    "in such a case one can form a quantity by multiplying the three complex visibilities formed over the three baselines . since the visibility is the fourier transform of the surface brightness distribution ( c.f .",
    "eqn  [ vcz ] ) , the product of three visibilities measured over a closed triangle is the surface brightness s bispectrum @xmath62 , evaluated at @xmath63 and @xmath64 corresponding to the legs of the triangle .",
    "the phase of the measured bispectrum is known as the closure phase @xcite .",
    "the closure phase is immune to many forms of atmospheric corruption , which can be illustrated as follows : above each aperture there is a column of atmosphere with time - variable parcels of differing indices of refraction and hence optical pathlength .",
    "thus the atmosphere above each aperture contributes a time - variable phase error , giving @xmath65 where @xmath66 and @xmath67 are the phase errors associated with apertures 1 and 2 respectively , and @xmath68 is an intrinsic phase associated with the source as measured by the 1 - 2 baseline .",
    "the bispectrum is thus @xmath69 we see that the atmospheric phase errors ( as well as many other aperture - dependent phase errors ) cancel .",
    "this is a well - known result , first applied in radio interferometry @xcite .",
    "however , it is not immediately obvious what the closure phase represents .",
    "below we derive an expression relating the observed closure phase to the binary point source representing a microlensing event .",
    "assume 3 apertures , resulting in 3 baselines @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "note that @xmath72 as before , we are looking at two point sources with intensity ratio @xmath73 and separation @xmath74 .",
    "on each baseline we measure a visibility @xmath75 given by equation  ( [ vcz ] ) .",
    "@xmath76\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the closure phase is thus @xmath77    there are a few things to note : the closure phase is always zero when @xmath78 , i.e. the source is symmetric .",
    "in addition , by taylor expanding the sine terms and recalling eqn .",
    "( [ zerosum ] ) it is easy to show that for the case when @xmath79",
    "@xmath80 this implies that a source must be resolved by the interferometer in order to produce a non - zero closure phase ; in the case of a partially resolved source the magnitude of the closure phase signal is very sensitive to the separation of the source components .    unlike @xmath58 , the phase measured by an optical interferometer is largely unbiased by measurement noise . in other words ,",
    "the phase noise is zero - mean , and can be reduced by averaging over a sufficiently long time .",
    "the snr for closure phase is given by @xcite @xmath81^{-1/2}\\ ] ] as compared to that for visibility and phase , @xmath82 in the photon - noise dominated regime ( @xmath83 ) , the snr for closure phase and visibility scales as @xmath84 .",
    "however , for photon - starved sources , the snr drops precipitously as @xmath85 , even worse than the @xmath86 scaling of the visibility snr .",
    "hence it is important to check whether microlensing sources will be photon - rich or photon - starved .    in the @xmath87-band ( @xmath88 m )",
    "a 15th magnitude source produces 0.16 photons @xmath89 .",
    "thus we would expect an 8-m class telescope to collect @xmath90 photons sec@xmath91 . assuming a coherence time @xmath92msec , and a typical photon efficiency of 5%",
    ", we have @xmath93 per integration , safely in the photon rich regime when using modern low - noise detectors . in the absence of systematic errors",
    "a 3-element interferometer should achieve a closure phase precision of @xmath94 radians in 250 seconds .",
    "however , it remains to be seen if such levels can be achieved . to date",
    ", closure phase measurements have been made in the optical and near - ir by 2 groups .",
    "coast achieves a closure phase precision of @xmath95 degrees @xcite , while npoi achieves phase drifts of @xmath61 degrees hr@xmath91 , which can be calibrated to the level of 1 - 4 degrees by looking at known single stars @xcite .",
    "recent progress in integrated optics  which due to their compact design are much less susceptible to systematic closure phase errors  may well yield a large improvement in the achievable accuracy @xcite .",
    "we suggest that a good method to correct for systematic closure phase errors would be to measure closure phase across a range of wavelengths .",
    "given that many systematic error mechanisms give errors with a characteristic wavelength dependence that varies from that of the observed source , it should be possible to separate the signals . to illustrate , consider the case of a physical pathlength mismatch in the interferometric beam combiner , applied only to the light from one pair of apertures",
    ". such a path mismatch will give a closure phase error that is inversely proportional to wavelength .",
    "now consider the typical microlensing event ; although the lens is achromatic , from equation  ( [ cubescale ] ) we see that the amplitude of the closure phase signal is inversely proportional to the cube of the wavelength .",
    "hence , measuring the closure phase at several wavelengths should allow one to solve for both the source closure phase and the internal closure phase error .",
    "clearly , this type of experiment would benefit from long baselines and wide bandwidth ; the vlti ( 200-m baseline ) and amber ( 3-aperture combination from 1 - 2.4@xmath96 m ) provide such a suitable combination @xcite .",
    "microlensing events are amenable to study by interferometers by all three methods described in the previous section .",
    "microlensing causes an astrometric excursion of the center of light of the two images given by eqn .",
    "( [ astrometric ] ) , which may be measured using narrow angle astrometry @xcite . similarly , as the secondary image brightens , the two images become distinguishable from a single point source , causing a decrement in the visibility amplitude @xcite .",
    "lastly , during the microlensing event the distribution of flux about the center of light becomes asymmetric , giving a signal in the closure phase . to measure @xmath0 by astrometry , multiple measurements are required to map out the microlensing ellipse , while visibility and closure phase can give @xmath0 from a single measurement .",
    "now let us consider the measurement of these signals in practice .",
    "an important point to recall is that typical microlensed sources , by interferometrists standards , are faint .",
    "this has several ramifications for the measurement of the signals in astrometry , visibility , and closure phase .",
    "as the application of these techniques to optical / ir wavelengths is still a relatively new field , there is considerable uncertainty regarding the measurement precision that will be achievable .",
    "thus we will define a range of likely precisions ( for the optimist and the pessimist ) and evaluate the usefulness of the technique for each case .",
    "astrometric measurements of faint sources require the presence of a bright ( @xmath97 ) phase reference within an isoplanatic patch , typically of order 20 arcseconds in the @xmath87 band .",
    "the probability of a @xmath97 star falling within @xmath98 is roughly 17% @xcite .",
    "narrow - angle astrometry at the 100 micro - arcsecond level has already been demonstrated at pti , and it is reasonable to expect the keck and vlti to produce the specified precision of 10 - 30 microarcseconds . however , narrow - angle interferometric astrometry is the least mature of the three techniques , and hence we will consider the utility of the technique for precisions of both 100 and 10 @xmath96as .",
    "next consider measurement of the visibility amplitude for faint sources .",
    "the precision with which @xmath99 can be measured with small apertures ( single-@xmath100 , where @xmath100 is the fried parameter ) can be as good as 0.3% .",
    "however , recall that in our estimate for the number of photons per coherence time , we assumed an aperture of 8 m .",
    "since a typical fried parameter for @xmath87 band is @xmath101 cm , adaptive optics ( ao ) are required to correct distortions in the wavefront . ideally , an ao system would completely flatten the wavefront , giving uniform path delays across the aperture .",
    "this would restore the point spread function ( psf ) to the familiar airy pattern .",
    "unfortunately , ao systems are not ideal , and in practice manage to get @xmath102 of the light into a tight core , and the remainder in a diffuse halo .",
    "this strehl ratio sets the upper limit to the ( squared ) visibilities an interferometer can achieve , unless a spatial filter such as a single - mode optical fiber is used .",
    "however , such a spatial filter increases the maximum achievable visibility amplitude at the expense of losing light ( max coupling efficiency @xmath103 , @xcite ) and introducing visibility biases which depend on the strehl ratio @xcite . in principle",
    ", these effects may be calibrated by observing point sources and monitoring the ao strehl ratio in real time . in practice ,",
    "such calibration is difficult and as yet unproven . at present",
    ", it is not known how well visibility amplitudes may be calibrated for large , ao - corrected apertures , but it may potentially be on the order of 5% . in summary , the expected precision in visibility amplitude ( @xmath99 ) for the keck and vlti will likely be between 0.5 and 5% ; we will consider the resulting measurement snr for both cases .",
    "lastly , we consider closure phase . as mentioned earlier ,",
    "closure phase is free of many of the error sources afflicting visibility amplitude and phase .",
    "however , other systematics can arise which we have not anticipated .",
    "the current generation of interferometers have demonstrated closure phase precision at roughly the 1-degree level .",
    "however , there is no obvious reason why performance at the 0.001 radian ( or 0.06 degree ) could not be achieved , in particular since the necessary high - precision phase - measurement equipment is being developed for differential - phase detections of hot exoplanets @xcite . in addition , @xcite has discussed the possibility of detecting hot exoplanets using differential closure phase at the vlti , an application which would require closure phase measurement precision on the order of @xmath104 radians . hence we will consider the closure phase snr for both pessimistic ( 1 deg ) and optimistic ( 0.001 rad ) cases .",
    "one of the differences between the study of microlensing via astrometry , as opposed to visibility or closure phase , is that the former does not rely upon resolving the two lensed images from each other . because of this , the signal itself is independent of wavelength .",
    "however , a single astrometric measurement alone does not suffice to measure @xmath0 . in principle",
    ", at least 3 astrometric measurements are required to measure the microlensing signal and disentangle it from proper motion of the source . since visibility and closure phase",
    "do involve resolving the two images , a single measurement does suffice to give @xmath0 , and the signal is a function of @xmath105 .    inserting eqns .",
    "( [ deltas ] ) and ( [ ratio ] ) into eqn .",
    "( [ vsq ] ) and expanding to lowest order in @xmath106 , we see that the visibility signal behaves as @xmath107 for @xmath108 . for a 3-element interferometer in an equilateral triangle , inserting eqns .",
    "( [ deltas ] ) and ( [ ratio ] ) into eqn .",
    "( [ phi123 ] ) gives to lowest order @xmath109 again for @xmath110 .",
    "figures  [ signal ] ,  [ example ] and  [ snr ] illustrate this .",
    "the steep dependence on the resolution means that there is a strong incentive to measure closure phase at the smallest possible wavelength .",
    "for example , the closure phase in @xmath111 band ( @xmath112 m ) is more than 10 times larger than that in @xmath87 band ( 2.2 @xmath96 m )",
    ".    an actual microlensing event will produce time - varying signals in astrometry , visibility and closure phase , analogous to the familiar time - varying photometric lightcurves .",
    "consider a typical microlensing event with a @xmath113 lens at distance @xmath114 kpc , giving @xmath115 mas .",
    "assume @xmath116 , so that the maximum magnification is @xmath117 , and the maximal brightness ratio of the images is @xmath118 .",
    "an interferometer with a 100 m baseline operating at 2.2 @xmath96 m ( @xmath87-band ) has a resolution of 4.5 mas .",
    "if we have three such baselines arranged in an equilateral triangle , they would observe the signals in astrometry , visibility , and closure phase shown in fig .",
    "[ example ] .",
    "the astrometric signal has a maximal amplitude of @xmath119 , which in this example is about 0.15 mas .",

    "however , vlti and keck can observe many more events than just those showing parallax , if there is justification to do so  for example , if such measurements could better constrain the lens properties .",
    "let us wildly speculate about a massive campaign from vlti to observe 100 events per year .",
    "the basic observable from such a campaign is the joint distribution of event timescales @xmath23 and angular einstein radii @xmath0 .",
    "an expression for @xmath164 is derived in the appendix in eqn .",
    "( [ dgdthedte ] ) . the resulting rate distribution is plotted in fig .",
    "( [ dgdthdt ] ) .    , spaced by decades . [ dgdthdt],scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "a massive survey can measure a noisy sample of this distribution . to estimate",
    "how well these measurements may be used to constrain the underlying lens properties , we use the fisher matrix @xcite . for a likelihood distribution @xmath165 ( here @xmath164 ) with parameters @xmath166 ,",
    "the covariance matrix of the parameters estimated by sampling @xmath165 is given by @xmath167 where the matrix * b * has elements @xmath168 and the angular brackets denote integration over possible observables ( here @xmath0 and @xmath23 ) weighted by @xmath165 .",
    "we vary eight parameters : the bulge velocity dispersion @xmath169 , mass function parameters @xmath170 , @xmath171 and @xmath172 , and the same parameters for the disk lenses .",
    "results are listed in table  [ fisher ] .",
    "we find that the corresponding disk and bulge parameters are somewhat degenerate , as may be expected , but that large numbers of events can allow constraints to be placed on the bulge parameters .",
    "for example , with @xmath173 lenses the error on the slope of the high end of the bulge mass function becomes @xmath174 , and the error on @xmath175 becomes @xmath176 , sufficient to detect a break in the mass function and to localize the break position .",
    "the caveat to this statement is that we have made several simplifying approximations , for example not exploring degeneracies between the mass function parameters and the density profile parameters .",
    ".errors on parameters from measuring @xmath164 .",
    "the second column lists the adopted values for each parameter , and the third column lists the measurement errors estimated using the fisher matrix .",
    "the errors values are to be multiplied by @xmath177 , where @xmath178 is the number of bright lens events observed by the interferometer . [ fisher ] [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "interferometry is poised to revolutionize the study of microlensing events . until now , microlensing has suffered the difficulty that masses of individual lenses can not be measured , severely limiting the information able to be extracted from lensing surveys .",
    "the problem has been that the two quantities needed to measure mass and distance , the relative parallax @xmath2 and the angular einstein radius @xmath0 , are not regularly measured .",
    "the parallax may be measured for long duration events with high quality photometry , however measurement of @xmath0 requires resolution on the order of a milliarcsecond , necessitating interferometers . the upcoming space interferometry mission ( sim )",
    "should measure masses and distances for a large sample of lenses , answering the question of the microlenses nature .",
    "well in advance of sim , however , ground - based interferometers can also provide useful measurements of lensing events .    as mentioned earlier , microlensed sources are generally much fainter than the typical sources studied by optical interferometers , meaning that large apertures ( @xmath179 m ) are required .",
    "both the keck interferometer and the vlti can measure visibility amplitude for microlensing events using their largest apertures , but only vlti can measure closure phase using 3 large apertures ; the keck would be required to employ one of the 1.8 m outrigger telescopes which collect considerably fewer photons .",
    "the signal measured by interferometers is a function of the einstein radius in units of the resolution , @xmath105 .",
    "because of this , there is great advantage to go to shorter wavelengths .",
    "however , shorter wavelengths require the use of adaptive optics ( ao ) systems .",
    "since ao makes the accurate calibration of visibility very difficult , but has a smaller impact on the calibration of closure phase , there are obvious advantages to using closure phase . for a numerical example",
    ", a microlensing event with @xmath180 mas could be observed at 10 @xmath96 m without ao , but @xmath181 giving a visibility signal of @xmath182 , which would be extremely challenging to distinguish from a point source .",
    "the same event observed at 2.2 @xmath96 m using ao has @xmath183 giving a closure phase signal @xmath184 which can already be measured .",
    "only a small fraction of events are expected to be bright enough ( @xmath185 ) to be observed interferometrically .",
    "however , certain fainter events may also be accessible to interferometers .",
    "if a bright ( @xmath97 ) star falls within the isoplanatic angle , then phase referencing may be employed to extend the coherence time significantly . as noted earlier , for sites with small isoplanatic patches",
    "the probability of finding a suitable bright star is poor .",
    "additionally , this technique is quite complex and as yet unproven , however in principle this could allow the study of microlensing events as faint as 20th magnitude , reaching the bright end of lmc events .",
    "phase referencing must be employed to perform narrow angle astrometry ; our results indicate that events for which phase referencing is possible may be more profitably studied with visibility or closure phase .",
    "we expect that @xmath186 events every year will be bright enough ( @xmath132 ) and have sufficiently long duration ( @xmath161 days ) to permit the measurement of mass and distance .",
    "we have shown that a fairly large fraction of events accessible to ground - based interferometers should allow measurement of @xmath0 with high signal to noise .",
    "we also investigated the prospects for a massive follow - up campaign by vlti , and found that statistical information on the @xmath0 distribution , even without individual mass measurements , can allow constraints to be placed on lens properties like their mass function .",
    "even if our estimates turn out to be overly optimistic , interferometers will still be able to elucidate the nature of claimed black hole candidates ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite have suggested that current microlensing data indicate the presence of a significant population of intermediate mass black holes roaming the galactic disk ; interferometers will be able to confirm or reject this possibility .    in this paper ,",
    "we have focused on ground - based interferometers , however our results apply also to space - based interferometers like the space interferometry mission ( sim ) .",
    "sim is primarily an astrometric instrument , however it can also measure fringe visibilities .",
    "nominally , the target precision expected for sim is 1% in @xmath58 ( m.  shao 2002 , priv .",
    "sim s baseline is 10 m , and typical wavelengths are @xmath187 m , giving resolution of about 12 mas .",
    "hence , sim can determine @xmath0 with snr@xmath188 from visibility alone , entirely independently of the astrometric determination , for events with @xmath189 mas . from figure  [ events ]",
    "we see that this comprises a large fraction of the events .",
    "the visibility measurements come for free with the astrometric measurements , and should significantly increase the precision of sim mass measurements , as long as effects such as crowding do not pose too great an obstacle .",
    "in addition to measuring @xmath0 , sim also determines @xmath2 , the lens parallax , by measuring the time of the peak of the photometric lightcurve . since the peak of the visibility signal coincides with the peak of the photometric signal , sim visibility measurements",
    "could also be used to determine @xmath2 . however , since the variation in @xmath190 is so shallow near the peak this method may not prove to be as precise as ordinary photometric parallax measurement .",
    "one of the most ( potentially ) exciting prospects is a topic we have not discussed in this paper , binary microlensing . for a binary lens system , complicated caustic structures can arise , leading in favorable cases to the production of 5 images of the source . for a spectacular example of this , see @xcite . during caustic crossings ,",
    "the magnification can get exceptionally large , e.g. factors of 30 , making these events bright enough to observe with interferometers .",
    "the five images are currently unresolvable from each other , however vlti and keck offer the prospect of imaging the multi - image pattern . with a multi - aperture system ( required for closure phase ) , one obtains several visibility measurements and one closure phase at the same time , possibly allowing the reconstruction of complex events such as caustic crossings .",
    "the microlensing optical depth @xmath191 is given by @xmath192 where @xmath193 is the mass function of lenses , normalized by @xmath194 , @xmath195 is the number density of lenses , @xmath196 is the average mass and @xmath197 is the mass density of lenses . from eqn .",

    "the optical depth distribution describes the instantaneous properties of lensing events at any given time , but we are interested in the distribution of all events .",
    "this is described by the lensing rate @xmath200 .",
    "if the transverse velocity distribution of source stars is @xmath201 , and that of the lenses is @xmath202 , we can write the lensing rate as @xcite @xmath203 where @xmath204 @xmath205 here , @xmath206 is the observer s velocity transverse to the line of sight , and @xmath207 .",
    "we assume all sources are bulge stars , with no net rotation and a velocity dispersion in each transverse direction of @xmath169 .",
    "lenses are assumed to reside either in the bulge or in the disk , with the latter population possessing a flat rotation curve @xmath160 , along with velocity dispersion in each transverse direction of @xmath208 . for bulge lenses ,",
    "this gives @xmath209 as usual , the angular integral gives a bessel function , but note that it is a modified bessel function due to the lack of an @xmath210 in the exponent .",
    "thus we have @xmath211}{(1+x^2)\\sigma_b^2 } \\int v^2 dv \\exp\\left(-\\frac{v^2}{2(1+x^2)\\sigma_b^2}\\right ) i_0\\left[\\frac{(1-x)v_cv}{(1+x^2)\\sigma_b^2}\\right]\\\\ & = & \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{2}}\\frac{e^{-\\frac{(1-x)^2v_c^2}{4(1+x^2)\\sigma_b^2 } } } { \\left(4(1+x^2)\\sigma_b^2 \\right)^{1/2 } } \\left[\\left ( ( 1-x)^2v_c^2 + 2(1+x^2)\\sigma_b^2\\right ) i_0\\left(\\frac{(1-x)^2v_c^2}{4(1+x^2)\\sigma_b^2}\\right)\\right.\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\left.\\hspace{2 in } + ( 1-x)^2v_c^2 i_1\\left(\\frac{(1-x)^2v_c^2}{4(1+x^2)\\sigma_b^2}\\right)\\right ] \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for disk lenses , the expression is similar , with @xmath212 and @xmath213 .    from eqn .",
