    "there are several ( quillen ) closed model structures on the category of bisimplical sets , see ( * ? ? ?",

    "this paper concerns two of them , namely , the so - called bousfield - kan and moerdijk structures , that we briefly recall below :    on the one hand , in the closed model structure by bousfield - kan , bisimplicial sets are regarded as diagrams of simplicial sets and then fibrations are the pointwise kan fibrations and weak equivalences are the pointwise weak homotopy equivalences . to be more precise , a bisimplicial set @xmath0 , @xmath1,[q])\\mapsto x_{p , q}$ ] , is seen as a  horizontal \" simplicial object in the category of  vertical \" simplicial sets , @xmath2 , @xmath3\\mapsto x_{p,*}$ ] and then , a bisimplicial map @xmath4 is a fibration ( resp . a weak equivalence )",
    "if all simplicial maps @xmath5 , @xmath6 , are kan fibrations ( resp .",
    "weak homotopy equivalences ) .    on the other hand , the moerdijk closed model structure on the bisimplicial set category is transferred from the ordinary model structure on the simplicial set category through the diagonal functor , @xmath7\\mapsto x_{n , n}$ ] .",
    "thus , in this closed model structure , a bisimplicial map @xmath4 is a fibration ( resp . a weak equivalence ) if the induced diagonal simplicial map @xmath8 is a kan fibration ( resp .",
    "a weak homotopy equivalence ) .",
    "several useful relationships between these two different homotopy theories of bisimplicial sets have been established and , perhaps , the best known of them is the following :    * theorem . *",
    "( bousfield - kan ) _ let @xmath4 be a bisimplicial map such that @xmath5 is a weak homotopy equivalence for each @xmath6 . then @xmath8 is a weak homotopy equivalence . _",
    "the purpose of this brief note is to state and prove a suitable counterpart to bousfield - kan s theorem for fibrations , namely :    * theorem 1*. _ let @xmath4 be a bisimplicial map such that @xmath8 is a kan fibration . then @xmath5 is a kan fibration for each @xmath6 . _",
    "note that the converse of theorem 1 is not true in general .",
    "a counterexample is given in the last section of the paper .",
    "the authors are much indebted to the referees , whose useful observations greatly improved our exposition .",
    "the second author is grateful to the algebra department in the university of granada for the excellent atmosphere and hospitality .",
    "we use the standard conventions and terminology which can be found in texts on simplicial homotopy theory , e. g. @xcite or @xcite . for definiteness or emphasis we state the following .",
    "we denote by @xmath9 the category of finite ordered sets of integers @xmath10=\\{0,1,\\ldots , n\\}$ ] , @xmath11 , with weakly order - preserving maps between them .",
    "the category of _ simplicial sets _ is the category of functors @xmath12 , where set is the category of sets .",
    "if @xmath13 is a simplicial set and @xmath14\\to[n]$ ] is a map in @xmath9 , then we write @xmath15 $ ] and @xmath16 . recall that all maps in @xmath9 are generated by the injections @xmath17\\to[n]$ ] ( cofaces ) , @xmath18 , which miss out the @xmath19th element and the surjections @xmath20\\to [ n]$ ] ( codegeneracies ) , @xmath21 , which repeat the @xmath19th element ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* vii ,  5 , proposition 2 ) ) .",
    "thus , in order to define a simplicial set , it suffices to give the sets of _ @xmath22-simplices _",
    "@xmath23 , @xmath11 , together with maps @xmath24",

    "the next lemma ( cf .",
    "* lemma 7.4 ) ) will be very useful in our development . for @xmath37",
    "any finite set , @xmath38 denotes its number of elements .    [ 1.1 ] let @xmath4 be a kan fibration .",

    "suppose @xmath43 . if @xmath44 , the statement is true since @xmath30 is a kan fibration .",
    "hence the statement holds for @xmath45 .",
    "we now proceed by induction : assume @xmath46 and the result holds for @xmath47 and assume @xmath48 and the result holds for @xmath49 .",
    "taking @xmath50 , i\\notin i\\}$ ] , we wish to find a simplex @xmath51 , such that the collection of simplices @xmath52 be @xmath30-compatible , since then an application of the induction hypothesis on @xmath53 gives the claim .",
    "to find such an @xmath54 , let @xmath55 $ ] be the subset @xmath56and let @xmath57 be the family of simplices defined by @xmath58 for @xmath42 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 for @xmath42 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 .",
    "this family is @xmath30-compatible , whence the induction hypothesis on @xmath63 gives the required @xmath54 , that is , a @xmath64-simplex of @xmath13 satisfying @xmath65 for @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "the category of _ bisimplicial sets _ is the category of functors @xmath0 .",
    "it is often convenient to see a bisimplicial set @xmath13 as a ( horizontal ) simplicial object in the category of ( vertical ) simplicial sets .",
    "if @xmath68\\to[p']$ ] and @xmath69\\to[q']$ ] are any two maps in @xmath9 , then we will write @xmath70 and @xmath71 for the images @xmath72 and @xmath73 respectively .",
    "in particular , the horizontal and vertical face and degeneracy maps are @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 .    by composing with the diagonal functor @xmath78 , @xmath10\\mapsto ( [ n],[n])$ ]",

    "now , using the bisimplex @xmath147 we construct the bisimplex    @xmath148    which , we claim , satisfies relations ( [ r ] ) . actually :    - for @xmath149 ,    @xmath100    lcp9.4 cm d_i^vx&=&@xmath150 + & = & @xmath151 + & = & @xmath152 + & = & @xmath153 + & = & @xmath154 + & = & @xmath155 + & = & @xmath156 + & = & @xmath157 + & = & @xmath158    @xmath100    - for @xmath145 ,    @xmath100    lcp9.4 cm d_i^vx&=&@xmath150 + & = & @xmath159 + & = & @xmath160 + & = & @xmath161 + & = & @xmath162 + & = & @xmath163 + & = & @xmath164 + & = & @xmath165 + & = & @xmath158    @xmath166    lcp9.4 cm fx&=&@xmath167 + & = & @xmath168 + & = & @xmath169 + & = & @xmath170 + & = & @xmath171 + & = & @xmath172    @xmath100    hence theorem 1 is proved .",
    "let us stress that theorem 1 not only says that , when @xmath8 is a kan fibration , all simplicial maps @xmath5 are kan fibrations , but that the simplicial maps @xmath173 are kan fibrations as well .",
    "this is a consequence of the symmetry of the hypothesis : ",
    "@xmath98 is a kan fibration \" , that is , the fact follows by exchanging the vertical and horizontal directions .",
    "it is possible that , for a bisimplicial map @xmath4 , all simplicial maps @xmath85 and @xmath174 , @xmath6 , be kan fibrations and , however , @xmath175 be not a kan fibration : take @xmath13 to be the double nerve of an suitable double groupoid ( i.e. a groupoid object in the category of groupoids ) ; then , all simplicial sets @xmath176 and @xmath177 are kan complexes ( since they are nerves of groupoids ) but , as we show below , the diagonal simplicial set @xmath178 is not necessarily a kan complex .",
    "we briefly recall some standard terminology about double groupoids ; see for example @xcite or @xcite .",
    "a double groupoid consists of objects @xmath179 , @xmath180 , ... , horizontal and vertical morphisms between them @xmath181 and squares @xmath182 , @xmath183 , etc . , of the form @xmath184_{f}b\\\\&\\sigma&\\\\d\\ar[uu]^{g'}&&\\ar[ll]^{f'}a\\ar[uu]_{g}}\\,.\\ ] ] these satisfy axioms such that the objects together with the horizontal morphisms as well as the objects together with the vertical morphisms form groupoids .",
    "furthermore , the squares form a groupoid under both horizontal and vertical juxtaposition , and in the situation @xmath185\\cdot&&\\cdot\\ar[ll]\\\\ & \\sigma & & \\tau&\\\\ \\ar[uu]\\cdot&&\\ar[ll]\\cdot\\ar[uu]&&\\ar[uu]\\cdot\\ar[ll ] \\\\ & \\gamma & & \\delta & \\\\ \\ar[uu]\\cdot&&\\ar[ll]\\cdot\\ar[uu]&&\\ar[ll]\\cdot\\ar[uu]}\\ ] ] horizontal and vertical composition commute in the sense that @xmath186 in addition to the vertical identity morphisms , there are horizontal identity squares for each vertical morphism .",
    "its horizontal edges are the identity arrows of the horizontal groupoid of arrows .",
    "similarly , there are vertical identity squares for each horizontal morphism with vertical identity arrows .",
    "these identity squares are compatible in the sense that vertical and horizontal identity squares for the vertical and horizontal identity morphisms are the same .",
    "given a double groupoid @xmath187 , one can construct its bisimplicial nerve ( or double nerve ) @xmath188 .",
    "a typical @xmath189 simplex of @xmath188 is a subdivision of a square of @xmath187 as matrix of @xmath190 horizontally and vertically composable squares of the form @xmath185\\cdot&&\\cdot\\ar[ll]&\\cdots&\\cdot&&\\ar[ll]\\cdot\\\\ & \\sigma_{11 } & & \\sigma_{21}&&&&\\sigma_{p1}&\\\\ \\ar[uu]\\cdot&&\\ar[uu]\\ar[ll]\\cdot&&\\ar[uu]\\cdot\\ar[ll]&\\cdots&\\ar[uu]\\cdot&&\\ar[uu]\\ar[ll]\\cdot   \\\\ & \\sigma_{12 } & & \\sigma_{22}&&&&\\sigma_{p2}&\\\\ \\ar[uu]\\cdot&&\\ar[uu]\\ar[ll]\\cdot&&\\ar[uu]\\cdot\\ar[ll]&\\cdots&\\ar[uu]\\cdot&&\\ar[uu]\\ar[ll]\\cdot\\\\ \\vdots&&\\vdots&&\\vdots&&\\vdots&&\\vdots\\\\ \\cdot&&\\ar[ll]\\cdot&&\\cdot\\ar[ll]&\\cdots&\\cdot&&\\ar[ll]\\cdot\\\\ & \\sigma_{1q } & & \\sigma_{2q}&&&&\\sigma_{pq } & \\\\\\ar[uu]\\cdot&&\\ar[uu]\\ar[ll]\\cdot&&\\ar[uu]\\cdot\\ar[ll]&\\cdots&\\ar[uu]\\cdot&&\\ar[uu]\\ar[ll]\\cdot } \\ ] ]    the bisimplicial face operators are induced by horizontal and vertical composition of squares , and degeneracy operators by appropriated identity squares .",
    "we picture @xmath188 so that the set of @xmath189-simplices is the set in the @xmath191-th row and @xmath192-th column .",
    "thus , the @xmath191-th column of @xmath188 , @xmath193 , is the nerve of the  vertical \" groupoid whose objects are strings of @xmath191 composable horizontal morphisms @xmath194 and whose arrows are depicted as @xmath185\\cdot&&\\cdot\\ar[ll]&\\cdots&\\cdot&&\\ar[ll]\\cdot\\\\ & \\sigma_{1 } & & \\sigma_{2}&&&&\\sigma_{p}&\\\\ \\ar[uu]\\cdot&&\\ar[uu]\\ar[ll]\\cdot&&\\ar[uu]\\cdot\\ar[ll]&\\cdots&\\ar[uu]\\cdot&&\\ar[uu]\\ar[ll]\\cdot } \\ ] ] and , similarly , the @xmath192-th row , @xmath195 , is the  horizontal \" groupoid whose objects are the length @xmath192 sequences of composable vertical morphisms in @xmath196 and whose arrows are sequences of @xmath192 vertically composable squares . in particular , @xmath197 and @xmath198 are , respectively , the nerves of the groupoids of vertical and horizontal morphisms of @xmath187 .",
    "then , let @xmath206 denote the double groupoid with only one object , say  @xmath207 \" , with horizontal morphisms @xmath208 the elements @xmath209 , with vertical morphisms @xmath210 are the elements @xmath180 of @xmath211 , both with composition given by multiplication in the group , and whose squares @xmath212_{a } \\cdot \\\\ & & \\\\\\cdot \\ar[uu]^{b'}&&\\ar[ll]^{a'}\\cdot\\ar[uu]_{b}}\\ ] ] are lists @xmath213 of elements @xmath214 and @xmath215 such that @xmath216 .",
    "compositions of squares are defined , in the natural way , by @xmath217 @xmath218 and identities by @xmath219 where @xmath220 is the neutral element of the group .",
    "so defined , we claim that the associated simplicial set @xmath221 is not a kan complex . to prove that , note that the hypothesis @xmath201 implies the existence of elements @xmath209 and @xmath222 such that @xmath223 can not be expressed in the form @xmath224 , for any @xmath225 and @xmath226 .",
    "now , the identity squares @xmath227 and @xmath228 can be placed jointly as in the picture : @xmath185_a\\cdot&&\\\\ & \\iota_{\\!a } & & & \\\\ \\ar@{=}[uu]\\cdot&&\\ar[ll]^{{a}}\\cdot\\ar@{=}[uu]&&\\cdot\\ar@{=}[ll ] \\\\ & & & \\iota_b & \\\\ & & \\cdot\\ar[uu]^b&&\\ar@{=}[ll]\\cdot\\ar[uu]_b}\\ ] ] this means that , regarded @xmath229 and @xmath230 as @xmath231-simplices of diagonal simplicial set @xmath221 , they are compatible , in the sense that @xmath232 therefore , if we assume that @xmath221 is a kan complex , we should find a diagonal bisimplex , say @xmath233 , such that @xmath234 and @xmath235 .",
    "this @xmath236-simplex @xmath237 of the nerve of the double groupoid , should be therefore of the form @xmath238_a\\cdot&&\\cdot\\ar[ll]\\\\ & \\iota_{a } & & & \\\\ \\ar@{=}[uu]\\cdot&&\\ar[ll]^{\\ { a}}\\cdot\\ar@{=}[uu]&&\\cdot\\ar@{=}[ll]\\ar[uu ] \\\\ & & & ~\\iota_b & \\\\\\ar[uu]^{a'}\\cdot & & \\ar[ll]^{b'}\\cdot\\ar[uu]_b&&\\ar@{=}[ll]a\\ar[uu]_b}\\ ] ] what is clearly impossible .",
    "hence , the diagonal of the bisimplicial nerve of @xmath239 is not a kan complex , in spite of the fact that this bisimplicial set is a pointwise kan complex in both vertical and horizontal directions .    for a last comment",
    ", we shall point out a fact suggested by a referee : the property proved in theorem 1 for diagonal fibrations is not true for diagonal trivial fibrations .",
    "for instance : let @xmath240 be the universal cover of a non - trivial discrete group @xmath200 , that is , the simplicial set with @xmath241 and faces given by @xmath242 , @xmath18 , and let @xmath243 , the bisimplicial set defined by @xmath244 .",
    "then , @xmath178 is contractible to a one point kan complex and , however , each simplicial set @xmath245 is homotopy equivalent to the constant simplicial set @xmath246 , and therefore it is not contractible . in conclusion",
