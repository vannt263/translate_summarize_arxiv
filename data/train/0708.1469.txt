    "dense hadronic matter is of interest to a number of fundamental problems that range from nuclear physics to astrophysics .",
    "qcd at finite baryon density is notoriously difficult : ( 1 ) the introduction of a chemical potential causes most lattice simulations to be numerically noisy owing to the sign problem ; ( 2 ) the baryon - baryon interaction is strong making most effective approaches limited to subnuclear matter densities .    in the limit of a large number of colors @xmath5",
    ", qcd is an effective theory of solely mesons where baryons appear as chiral skyrmions .",
    "dense matter in large @xmath5 is a skyrmion crystal with spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry at low density , and restored or stripped ( overhauser ) chiral symmetry at high density .",
    "while some of these aspects can be studied qualitatively using large @xmath5 motivated chiral models  @xcite , they still lack a first principle understanding .    the ads / cft approach has provided a framework for discussing large @xmath5 gauge theories at strong coupling @xmath9 from first principles  @xcite .",
    "a particularly interesting ads / cft construction is the holographic and chiral approach proposed by sakai and sugimoto  @xcite ( ss model ) . in the limit where @xmath10 , chiral qcd is obtained as a gravity dual to @xmath11 d8-@xmath1 embedded into a @xmath12 background in 10 dimensions where supersymmetry is broken by the kaluza - klein ( kk ) mechanism .",
    "the kk scale plays the role of the chiral scale .",
    "the ss model yields a first principle effective theory of pions , vectors , axials and baryons that is in good agreement with experiment  @xcite .",
    "the ss model at finite temperature has been studied in  @xcite and the bayrons in the context of skyrmion and instanton have been worked out  @xcite .",
    "recently we have suggested that the ss model can be used to analyze dense hadronic matter at large @xmath5 and strong coupling @xmath13 @xcite . at zero temperature ,",
    "the quark / baryon chemical potential @xmath14 ( or @xmath15 ) is introduced as the boundary value of the @xmath3 brane potential @xmath16 .",
    "the diagonalization of the vector modes in dense matter , enforces vector dominance and yields @xmath17 throughout where @xmath18 is given in  @xcite .",
    "while the mode decomposition of @xmath18 on the brane leads to a highly oscillating @xmath19 , we have argued in @xcite that only those modes in @xmath19 below the kk scale should be retained . as a result both brane and meson properties in holographic and dense baryonic matter were discussed .",
    "soon after the posting of this work , several studies appeared addressing the same issue of baryonic matter in holographic qcd including also temperature . in",
    "@xcite it was suggested that the @xmath19 field is instead fixed by the equation of motion on the brane by varying the pertinent dbi action . in the absence of brane `` charges '' the authors in  @xcite concluded that only a constant @xmath19 is a solution , with no baryonic effect at zero temperature .",
    "however , the conserved baryonic charge has to be mirrored by the `` charge '' of baryon vertex .",
    "the latter is obtained by considering brane wrapping of @xmath0 within d8-@xmath1 .",
    "the wrapping number is the bulk conservedcharge  which is at the origin of a non - constant @xmath19 in bulk .",
    "this point was further developed in  @xcite and used to discuss the phase structure of dense and hot holographic matter , albeit in a brane set up without chiral symmetry . in",
    "@xcite it was argued that the additional `` charges '' in bulk upset the smoothness of the dbi surface in bulk , leading to a spiky structure due to the force balancing condition  . as a result ,",
    "the embedded branes should _ always _ touch the horizon even for arbitrarily small temperature and/or density , thereby altering totally the phase diagram in  @xcite .",
    "this latter point is physically unintuitive .",
    "indeed , the `` charge '' or baryon vertex exists even at zero temperature with no need to connect to any horizon . at finite temperature through the insertion of a black hole this point is developed in details in  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we follow on the analysis in  @xcite in bulk and at zero temperature ( and low temperature before deconfinement phase transition ) . the dual `` charge '' or baryon vertex",
    "is inserted at the tip of the minimally embedded d8-@xmath1 surface . this way each of d8 , @xmath1 is shared equally , leading to a _",
    "baryon vertex .",
    "since no connecting string is involved , there is no spiky structure involved here . also , there is a one - to - one correspondence between the baryon vertex normalization and the wess - zumino term in the induced chiral dbi action .",
    "thus the boundary chiral skyrmions constructed from the induced dbi action , are dual to _",
    "static _ and _ point - like _ instantons in bulk .",
    "these conditions will be relaxed in a sequel . in many ways ,",
    "this approach complements the original discussion in  @xcite .    in section 2 , we briefly review the ss model and set up the notations . in section 3",
    ", we introduce the @xmath3 field @xmath20 in bulk and show how the baryon charge density @xmath4 affects its minimal profile . in section 3 and 4 , we construct the bulk hamiltonian and derive the energy density as a function of the identified baryon density .",
    "the energy density is found to grow about quadratically with the baryon density . in section 5 , we summarize the construction of the chiral effective action for pions , vectors and axials at zero density . in section 6 ,",
    "we show how this chiral effective action is modified by the finite `` charges '' in bulk .",
    "a number of meson properties are discussed as a function of the identified baryon number .",
    "our conclusions are in section 7 . throughout",
    ", the canonical formalism will be used .",
