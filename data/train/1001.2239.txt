    "the study of the in - medium baryon - baryon effective interactions is one of the fundamental problems in nuclear physics .",
    "while significant progress has been made in understanding the nucleon - nucleon interaction in nuclear medium , our knowledge on the hyperon - nucleon and hyperon - hyperon interactions in nuclear medium is very limited .",
    "the latter is important for understanding the properties of hypernuclei , the equation of state ( eos ) of dense baryonic matter , the properties of compact stars in which hyperons are expected to appear abundantly , and strangeness production in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "therefore , it is of great interest to develop an effective model for the hyperon - nucleon and hyperon - hyperon interactions in nuclear medium .",
    "the in - medium single - particle potential of a nucleon generally depends not only on the nuclear density and its momentum but also on its isospin .",
    "the isospin- and momentum - dependent mdi interaction is such an effective nuclear interaction based on the finite - range gogny interaction  @xcite .",
    "this interaction has recently been extensively used in studying the isospin and momentum - dependent effects in nuclear reactions and the properties of neutron stars ( for a recent review see ref .",
    "in particular , using this interaction in the isospin - dependent boltzmann - uheling - ulenback ( ibuu ) transport model with the isospin - dependent in - medium nucleon - nucleon scattering cross sections , a relatively stringent constraint on the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy at subsaturation densities was obtained from the isospin diffusion data in intermediate - energy heavy - ion collisions  @xcite .",
    "the resulting symmetry energy has been used to constrain the neutron skin thickness of heavy nuclei  @xcite and the properties of neutron stars  @xcite including the transition density , which separates the liquid core from the inner crust of a neutron star , and other properties of neutron stars by assuming that they only consist of nucleons , electrons , and muons  @xcite .    in this paper , we extend the mdi interaction to include nucleon - hyperon and hyperon - hyperon interactions .",
    "this is achieved by assuming that the nucleon - hyperon and hyperon - hyperon interactions have the same density and momentum dependence as the nucleon - nucleon interaction with the interaction parameters fitted to known experimental data at normal nuclear matter density . with this extended mdi interaction ,",
    "we then study , as an example , the properties of hybrid stars that not only consist of appreciable fraction of hyperons but also a possible quark matter in their dense core  @xcite . for the hadron - quark phase transition , we use the gibbs construction  @xcite with the quark phase described by a simple mit bag model  @xcite .",
    "in particular , we study the effects of attractive and repulsive @xmath0n interactions and different symmetry energies on the properties of hybrid stars .",
    "we note that there have been extensive studies on hybrid stars based on various approaches , such as the relativistic mean field ( rmf ) model  @xcite , the brueckner - hartree - fock theroy  @xcite , and phenomenological models  @xcite .",

    "a stiffer symmetry energy also increases the neutron chemical potential and thus leads to a larger total hyperon fractions at higher densities . since the total charge of the hypernuclear matter is conserved , an increase in the fraction of negatively charged hyperon results in an increasing fraction of protons and decreasing fraction of leptons .",

    "[ mdihpf ] , a stiffer symmetry energy leads to a larger number of hyperons , which results in a softer eos as a result of the lower pressure due to the presence of more degrees of freedom , and the effect of hyperons on the eos is smaller for a soft symmetry energy , as fewer hyperons are then present in the hypernuclear matter .",
    "one the other hand , the symmetry energy contribution to the pressure of the hypernuclear matter is larger for @xmath99 than @xmath98 . as a result , the eos of hypernuclear matter shows similar stiffness for different symmetry energy parameters .",

    "the difference between the results from @xmath98 and @xmath99 is not large except for the different starting density of the hadron - quark phase transition .",
    "since the eos is more sensitive to the value of bag constant than to the value of @xmath17 when the quark degrees of freedom are introduced , the bag constant @xmath12 is thus the main parameter in determining the eos of dense matter as reported in other work  @xcite .",
    "the energy density at the end of the hadron - quark phase transition is about @xmath188 gev/@xmath189 for @xmath176 mev and about @xmath190 gev/@xmath189 for @xmath181 mev , with the former closer to the value of about @xmath29 gev/@xmath189 obtained from the lattice qcd calculation  @xcite and extracted from heavy - ion collision experiments  @xcite .",
    "compared with the equation of state constrained by the collective flow data in heavy - ion collisions  @xcite , our results from both values of bag constants satisfy the empirical constraint .      in this subsection , we use the mdi - hyp interaction to study the properties of static hybrid stars with spherically symmetric mass distributions .",
    "in particular , we calculate the mass - radius relation of a hybrid stars using tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff ( tov ) equation  @xcite @xmath191 where @xmath192 is the gravitational mass inside the radius @xmath193 of the hybrid star given by @xmath194 with @xmath195 being the energy density . above equations",

    "is seen to be smaller as the eos of the hypernuclear matter is softer than that of the nuclear matter .",
    "the eoss at moderate densities play an important role in determining the maximum mass , as the m-@xmath206 relation shows that the neutron star mass can not increase even the central density reaches a very high value .",
    "the mass is larger when a repulsive @xmath0n interaction is used as a result of the smaller number of degrees of freedom and stiffer eos , as discussed in the previous subsection . for smaller values of @xmath207 a stiffer symmetry energy",

    "the nuclear symmetry energy is small , and the mass from @xmath98 is similar to that from @xmath99 because of the opposite effects from the symmetry pressure and the fraction of hyperons on the equation of state .",
