    "the history of single spin asymmetries  ( ssa ) can date back to the 1970s when significant ssa were observed in @xmath0  @xcite . in the early 1990s ,",
    "large asymmetries in @xmath1 were found at fnal  @xcite .",
    "however , there were no satisfactory theory to describe the phenomena , and pqcd theory had nothing to do then . in recent years",
    ", ssa phenomenon were also observed in semi - inclusive deep inelastic scattering  ( sidis ) processes , which had attracted many interests , particularly in the case where the transverse polarized targets are used .",
    "for example , hermes collaboration  @xcite has reported the observation of the azimuthal asymmetries in single - pion productions on both longitudinally and transversely polarized hydrogen targets .",
    "more recently , compass collaboration  @xcite has published their results off a transversely polarized deuterium targets as a complementary measurement to hermes experiment . on the theoretical side , by taking into the account of the transverse parton momenta inside the nucleon  @xcite , these asymmetries are now assumed to have correlations with the concept of transversity  @xcite which we are not familiar with so far .    the idea  ( though not the term ) of transversity was put forward by ralston and soper via the drell - yan process  @xcite , where they introduced the concept of parton transverse polarization .",
    "a clarification of transversity on the role of chiral - odd parton distributions and the general twist was provided by jaffe and ji in ref .",
    "detailed twist clarification for various parton distributions can be found in refs .",
    "now we know that at the leading twist  ( twist 2 ) , three fundamental quark distributions provide a complete description of quark momentum and spin in the nucleon . in the last forty years , two of them , the unpolarized and longitudinal polarized parton distributions(@xmath2 and @xmath3 )",
    "have been precisely measured , yet the third type , the `` transversity distribution ( @xmath4 ) '' , is still little known both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "the difficulty in experiments lies in its chiral - odd property . in the helicity basis",
    ", @xmath4 represents a quark helicity flip , which can not occur in any hard process for massless quarks within qed or qcd  @xcite .",
    "this chiral - odd property makes it inaccessible in inclusive deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) .",
    "however , several researches have shown that the transversity distribution can manifest itself in semi - inclusive deep inelastic scattering ( sidis ) reactions  @xcite , where the transversity distribution function couple with a chiral - odd fragmentation function  the collins function  @xcite .",
    "this was verified by observing the ssa in hermes and compass experiments recently .",
    "results from both hermes and compass have offered us a first glimpse at transversity distributions on u and d quarks in proton .    if studying ssa more explicitly , we would find that these asymmetries can be explained  @xcite in terms of both the sivers  @xcite and collins  @xcite effects .",
    "the sivers effect involves the so called sivers function and the ordinary fragmentation function , while the collins effect involves the transversity distribution function and the collins fragmentation function .",
    "the two competing contributions have different kinematic dependence .",
    "the collins effect depends on _ y _ and strongly correlated with _ z _ , but the sivers effect is independent of _ y _ and not strongly correlated with _",
    "z_. also , they have different azimuthal angle dependence : the sivers effect is proportional to @xmath5 , while the collins effect is proportional to @xmath6 , where the definition of @xmath7 and @xmath8 can be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "thus we can distinguish the two effects in experiment without much difficulty . in our paper",
    ", we are interested in the transversity information provided by ssa , so we only concentrate on the collins effect in this paper . in the collins effect",
    ", the transversity distribution function describes the correlation between the spin of quarks and spin of nucleons , and the so called collins function describes the fragmentation of transversely polarized quarks into unpolarized hadrons .",
    "both functions are important in our numerical calculations and will be discussed in the next section .    with this understanding ,",
    "a lot of studies  @xcite have attempted to explain the hermes measurement or to give more predictions .",
    "particularly , the article  @xcite predicted the collins azimuthal asymmetries ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) on a transversely polarized hydrogen target in hermes kinematics , yet the prediction is not consistent with the new released hermes results  @xcite .",
    "however , as the authors pointed out in the paper that the `` unfavored '' process might lead to a sizable effect , which is in conflict with our general understanding and might result in the inconsistency .",
    "recently , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite proposed that the polarized `` unfavored '' collins function is approximately equal to the `` favored '' one , but with an opposite sign .",
    "they fitted the hermes data  @xcite and obtained new sets of parametrization .",
    "we will shown in this paper that the updated results of ref .",
    "@xcite with these new parametrization of the collins function , are also consistent with the hermes data ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "both calculations imply that the `` unfavored '' collins function may play an important role in the fragmentation processes .    at jefferson lab  ( jlab ) , experiments e06010 and",
    "e06011 will perform the measurement of single spin asymmetries with a transversely polarized @xmath9he target which is an effectively transversely polarized neutron target , so it may provide a direct measurement of the neutron transversity distributions . in our paper , we will present the predictions of the azimuthal asymmetries in the jlab kinematics region .",
    "the influence due to the `` unfavored '' collins function is included in the prediction .",
    "we conclude that the comparison of the data with the prediction will be able to provide constraints on both the collins functions and transversity distributions , but not a pure measurement of the transversity distributions .",
    "at the leading twist , the differential cross section for a sidis reaction includes the contributions from the unpolarized part , the collins effect and the sivers effect .",
    "it can be written as @xmath10 where the beam is not polarized and the target is transversely polarized .    under the factorization assumption , the cross sections in eq .",
    "( [ duu ] ) can be expressed as product of parton distribution and fragmentation functions  @xcite .",
    "here we only give the unpolarized and the collins terms as follows , @xmath11 here @xmath12 is the target transverse polarization ; @xmath13 is the charge of the quark with flavor @xmath14 .",

    "the transversity distributions are given by @xmath35w_s(x)-\\frac{1}{6}d_v(x)w_v(x);\\nonumber\\\\ \\delta d_v(x)&=&-\\frac{1}{3}d_v(x)w_v(x).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the melosh - wigner rotation factors for spectator scalar and vector diquarks , which come from the relativistic effect of quark transversal motions  @xcite . for the pqcd based analysis , we adopt the parametrization @xmath38 where the superscripts `` th '' means the theoretical calculation in the pqcd analysis  @xcite , and `` para''means the input from parametrization .",
    "the cteq  @xcite parametrization is served as the input for both models to get the unpolarized parton distribution functions .",
    "detailed constructions of the quark distributions can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "both of the two models have successfully predicted the longitudinal polarized parton distribution functions  @xcite .",
    "but two models give different distribution functions at @xmath39 : the pqcd based counting rule analysis  @xcite predicts @xmath40 , while the su(6 ) quark - spectator - diquark model  @xcite predicts @xmath41 . in a recent literature  @xcite ,",
    "the author extracted the transversity distribution for @xmath42 and @xmath43 quarks from the now available data .",
    "they found that @xmath44 and @xmath45 turned out to be opposite in sign , with @xmath46 smaller than @xmath47 .",
    "this seems to be coincidence qualitatively with the su(6 ) quark - diquark model .",
    "but there it predicts @xmath48 when @xmath49 , which is coincidence quantitatively with neither models we used in our paper .",
    "the correctness of different parametrization is still unclear , and need to be checked by more experiments .    as to the ordinary fragmentation functions for @xmath50 , we follow the parametrization of @xmath51 given by kretzer , leader and christova  @xcite : @xmath52 and for @xmath53 , we have  @xcite @xmath54 where @xmath51 denotes the `` favored '' fragmentation function and @xmath55 denotes the `` unfavored '' one .    the collins fragmentation function @xmath56 , which describes the transition of a transversely polarized quark into a pion , is theoretically little known and has not yet been measured . in ref .",
    "@xcite , collins suggested a parametrization : @xmath57 where @xmath58 gev . in hermes analysis , @xmath59 gev is taken as a rough estimate  @xcite .",
    "the transverse momentum dependence of @xmath60 is assumed to have a gaussian type shape : @xmath61 one can obtain @xmath62 with @xmath63 , and @xmath64 being the mean square momentum that the detected hadron acquires in the quark fragmentation process with @xmath65 @xmath66 according to hermes  @xcite .",
    "recently , vogelsang and yuan suggested another model  @xcite which assumes a stronger constraint for the pion collins functions : @xmath67 if we consider the isospin and charge symmetry relations between the different fragmentation functions , we can have the following relations , @xmath68 . \\label{hu}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] substituting ( [ hu ] ) into ( [ h1 ] ) , one obtains @xmath69 which means that the `` unfavored '' collins function is approximately equal to the `` favored '' one , but with an opposite sign .",
    "this is in conflict with almost all the theoretical analysis before , and it still needs to be further checked by experiment . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the parametrization of collins functions is advanced in the forms , @xmath70 the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite fitted the parametrization to the hermes data  @xcite and obtained @xmath71    the difference between these two sets of parametrization is that in set i , both favored and unfavored collins functions are parameterized in terms of favored unpolarized quark fragmentation function , while in set ii the unfavored collins function is parameterized in terms of the unfavored unpolarized quark fragmentation function .",
    "also in the literature  @xcite , the authors provide their own parametrization to the collins functions , with more parameters compared to the parametrization in ref .  @xcite . as the author pointed",
    "that their parametrization is agree with the extractions obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , we will use the parametrization with less parameters provided in ref .",
    "@xcite in our paper .",
    "this parametrization was obtained from the pion data in ref .",
    "@xcite . in our paper , we assume that this parametrization is also right for the kaon case . in other words , we assume that with this parametrization , the information depending on the final hadron states is only contained in the ordinary fragmentation functions .",
    "figs .  [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] show our calculated results on hermes measurement as function of @xmath24 , using different sets of parametrization .",
    "first we find that the quark - diquark model and the pqcd based counting rule analysis give almost the same result in the intermediate region of _",
    "x_. fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] presents the results when we use the parametrization as eq .",
    "( [ col ] ) shows .",
    "however , the calculated results are overestimated compared to the experimental data . fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] presents the results when we use two sets of parametrization of collins functions given by ref .",
    "@xcite , which shows that our calculations fit the hermes data well .",
    "as @xmath42 quark dominates in the proton , so @xmath42 to @xmath72 is favored while @xmath42 to @xmath73 is unfavored .",
    "the calculation indicates that both the `` favored '' and `` unfavored '' processes have the sizable effect .",
    "this is the direct consequence of eq .",
    "[ set ] where the favored and unfavored collins functions have the approximately equal size but with the opposite signs .",
    "this is quite different from the ordinary fragmentation functions where the favored process plays much more important roles than the unfavored process .",
    "if we ignore the opposite sign , the numerator of formula ( [ a1 ] ) is nearly of the equal size for both the @xmath72 and @xmath73 productions , but the denominator is larger in the @xmath72 production case than that in the @xmath73 production case .",
    "so we expect a larger asymmetry in the @xmath73 production and this can also be seen from fig.[fig2 ] . besides these",
    ", we also notice that both the two sets of parametrization shown in eq .",
    "( [ set ] ) give similar predictions , so more precise experiments are needed to give the constraints .",
    "the jlab experiments e06010 and e06011 will measure the target single spin asymmetries in the semi - inclusive deep - inelastic reaction off a transversely polarized @xmath9he target for both @xmath50 and @xmath53 . duo to the special structure of @xmath9he , which can be considered as a nearly free polarized neutron , jlab will provide a measure of the neutron structure . applying the same technique ,",
    "we make predictions of azimuthal asymmetries @xmath74 for @xmath50 and @xmath53 productions at jlab kinematics .    at jlab ,",
    "the kinematics region is : @xmath75 the azimuthal asymmetry of @xmath9he target can be expressed by the neutron and proton asymmetries : @xmath76 where @xmath77 and @xmath78 are the effective polarizations of the proton and the neutron within the @xmath9he nucleus , and @xmath79 is the polarization of the @xmath9he target which is assumed to be @xmath80 in the experiment .",
    "a three - body fadeev calculation  @xcite shows that in inelastic scattering reactions , @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "@xmath83(@xmath84 ) in the above formula represents the ratio of @xmath85 events on neutron ( proton ) over the total @xmath9he@xmath85 events . at jlab ,",
    "one expects : @xmath86 and @xmath87 . for the case of kaon production",
    ", we adopt the same value as a rough estimate .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows the prediction of the asymmetry ( @xmath74 ) on proton target .",
    "compared to fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , we find that the predictions are almost the same .",
    "[ fig4 ] shows the neutron case , where @xmath43 quark dominates , so the neutron data will be more sensitive to the d quark in comparison with the hydrogen target .",
    "here @xmath43 to @xmath73 is favored and @xmath43 to @xmath72 is unfavored .",
    "again we get the result that the two processes both have the sizable effect , although the asymmetry in @xmath72 production seems not larger than that in the @xmath73 production as we argued in the above section due to the different electric charges between @xmath42 and @xmath43 quarks .",
    "[ fig5 ] is for the @xmath9he target , and we expect a similar prediction as the neutron case shown in fig",
    ".  [ fig4 ] , for @xmath9he can be considered as a nearly free polarized neutron .",
    "but the magnitude of the asymmetry is much smaller than the proton result as the hermes experiments showed , because some small coefficients should be multiplied according to eq .",
    "( [ he ] ) .",
    "this is the difficulty measuring the structure of neutron for there is no such a free neutron as a proton .",
    "we expect precise experiments that will be done at jlab can give us some information on neutron .    from fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] to fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , we find that the quark - diquark model and the pqcd based analysis still give similar predictions .",
    "also the two sets of parametrization predict similarly .",
    "so the pion case is insensitive to the models , thus can give constraints on both the collins functions and transversity distributions that are little known yet , rather than give direct information on transversity distributions .",
    "next we present the predictions on @xmath53 productions as fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] shows .",
    "@xmath88 comprises a @xmath42 and an @xmath89 quark , thus the main contribution for the @xmath88 production comes from the valence @xmath42 quark with the favored process and the valence @xmath43 quark with the unfavored process .",
    "this is quite similar to the case of @xmath72 production .",
    "but for @xmath90 , the result is quite different from the others .",
    "@xmath91 comprises a @xmath92 quark and an @xmath33 quark , so the favored process do not contribute for the case , because the transversity is mainly the behavior of valence quarks .",
    "consequently , the asymmetry of @xmath91 production only comes from the unfavored process .",
    "so the kaon production can give us information about the unfavored collins function , and we are looking forward to the measurement .    the predictions on kaon productions are shown in fig .",
    "this time , we can see clearly that the quark - diquark model and the pqcd based analysis still give similar results on @xmath88 , but the two different approaches of collins functions seem to have differences .",
    "thus we expect the experiments to give constraints on the collins functions through @xmath88 production . for the @xmath91 case ,",
    "not only the two different approaches of collins functions , but also the two models of distributions predict differently .",
    "so it is concluded that we can get information on collins functions through @xmath88 production , and then distinguish the two models of distributions through @xmath91 production .",
    "however we should notice that the asymmetries for kaon productions are very small , and the differences between the models are also small , approximately the same order as the asymmetries .",
    "since the measurements at jlab can not reach such precision , we have to admit that distinguishing models through experiments is still difficult , and high precision experiments are needed to clarify the details .",
    "the results of jlab on a polarized @xmath9he target can give complementary results to hermes hydrogen measurement .",
    "compared with compass deuterium measurement which is an indirectly measurement of neutron , jlab data will have a unique advantage because of the higher bjorken _ x _ , since the transversity property is mainly a valence behavior .",
    "in addition , we expect that jlab results will give more detailed information on fragmentation functions .",
    "using quark - diqurk model and pqcd based analysis for distributions , and new sets of parametrization of collins functions , we reanalyzed the hermes experiment and found that with the new parametrization of the collins functions advanced by  @xcite , the predictions are consistent with the new released hermes data  @xcite , which implies that the `` unfavored '' collins functions may play an important role .    furthermore , we calculated the azimuthal spin asymmetries of pion and kaon productions in semi - inclusive deep - inelastic scattering of an unpolarized charged lepton beam on a transversely polarized @xmath9he target in the jlab kinematics region . due to the lack of independent measurement of collins functions , it is difficult to obtain transversity distribution functions directly from the measurement on pion productions .",
    "the comparison of the data with the prediction can give constraints on both the collins functions and transversity distributions , but not a direct measurement of the transversity distributions .",
    "using different models for distribution functions and collins functions , we found that the @xmath88 production is sensitive to different sets of collins functions but insensitive to different models of distributions and the @xmath91 production is sensitive to both different approaches of distributions and collins functions .",
    "so we suggest distinguishing the quark - diquark model and pqcd based analysis through this process after the collins functions being constrained by the @xmath88 production .",
    "but due to the small magnitude of the asymmetry , the measurement through this suggestion can only be achieved by experiments with much higher precision compared to the coming jlab experiment .",
    "the @xmath50 productions are sensitive to neither the different approaches of distributions and collins functions , so they might not give much exciting results , but these processes can be useful to give constraints on the results .",
    "additionally , we point here that the asymmetry of @xmath91 production is contributed by pure unfavored processes , thus is an ideal process to study the unfavored collins functions .     for the semi - inclusive @xmath72 and @xmath73 productions in deep inelastic scattering of unpolarized charged lepton on a transversity polarized @xmath93 target in the hermes kinematics region , with the the parametrization for the collins function of ( [ col ] ) .",
