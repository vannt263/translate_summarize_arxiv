    "there are various lines of evidence for the existence of dark matter in the universe .",
    "one proposed solution for the dark matter problem comes in the form of weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) beyond the standard model  @xcite .",
    "it is known that for weak scale masses and interactions , thermal freeze out of wimp annihilation in the early universe can yield an acceptable relic abundance for dark matter , which is precisely measured by cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) experiments  @xcite .",
    "supersymmetry ( susy ) , which is a front - runner candidate to address the hierarchy problem of the standard model ( sm ) , can also provide candidates to explain the dark matter content of the universe .",
    "the supergravity motivated ( sugra ) models  @xcite have become the focus of major theoretical and experimental activities for the past two decades .",
    "the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) , provided that it is neutral and weakly interacting such as the lightest neutralino , is a natural candidate for thermal dark matter in these models . a simplified version of sugra , called minimal supergravity",
    "( msugra ) , which starts with universal supersymmetry breaking mass parameters at a high scale , has been studied extensively in this context . in particular , the allowed regions of msugra parameter space that yield acceptable dark matter abundance and are compatible with all phenomenological constraints have been determined . the prospect for discovery of these regions at the large hadron collider ( lhc )",
    "has also been studied  @xcite .",
    "one can go beyond msugra and obtain more realistic scenarios by relaxing the universality condition in msugra .",
    "for example , a partial relaxation is separating the higgs soft masses from those of sfermions . the dark matter allowed regions are in general different in these nonuniversal models .",
    "it is also possible to extend the sm gauge symmetries .",
    "a minimal extension , motivated by the nonzero neutrino masses , includes a gauged @xmath0 symmetry  @xcite ( @xmath1 and @xmath2 are baryon and lepton numbers respectively ) .",
    "anomaly cancellation then implies the existence of three right - handed ( rh ) neutrinos and allows us to write the dirac and majorana mass terms for the neutrinos to explain the light neutrino masses and mixings .",
    "the @xmath3 extension of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) provides new dark matter candidates : the lightest neutralino in the @xmath3 sector  @xcite and the lightest rh sneutrino  @xcite .",
    "if the @xmath0 is broken around tev , these candidates can acquire the correct thermal relic abundance .",
    "they have different qualitative features from the neutralino dark matter in mssm : due to the vectorial nature of @xmath3 symmetry there is no spin - dependent interaction between the dark matter and ordinary matter , and in some regions of the parameter space the dark matter annihilation rate can get enhancement via the sommerfeld effect  @xcite , which allows an explanation of the recent positron excess in the cosmic ray spectrum as observed by pamela  @xcite .",
    "the sneutrino dark matter is particularly interesting because it has a large scattering cross section off nucleons , which is correlated with the mass of @xmath4 in the @xmath3 model  @xcite .",
    "this @xmath5 can be searched for at the lhc .",
    "there are currently major experimental efforts for detection of dark matter particles .",
    "in particular , direct searches probe the scattering of the dark matter particle off nuclei inside underground detectors .",
    "a positive signal in direct detection experiments would prove the particle nature of the dark matter .",
    "very recently , results from one underground detection experiment , cdms , show 2 signal events with @xmath6 events expected as background  @xcite . due to low statistics",
    ", this result does not yet provide evidence for dark matter particle , but this can be a hint that the experiment may have started to see something . if these events turn out to be real signals , the direct detection cross section should not be far from the upper limit set by the experiment , @xmath7  pb for the dark matter mass around 70  gev , although there are still some uncertainties from hadronic factors determination , dark halo profile and galactic velocity distribution .",
    "another interpretation of the cdms result can be seen in ref .",
    "@xcite . in order to confirm the new findings",
    ", this result needs to be validated in the next results of the cdms experiment ( and its upgrades ) and other upcoming and future dark matter experiments : xenon 100  @xcite , edelweiss - ii  @xcite , cresst  @xcite , deap  @xcite , clean  @xcite , lux  @xcite and eureca  @xcite .",
    "a large number of similar events in the future will allow us to determine the scattering cross section and also the dark matter mass more precisely .",
    "the results from the lhc and the tevatron will also be used in tandem in the process of understanding the underlying physics beyond the sm . at this stage",
    "it is important to examine the implications of this positive signal for susy models that are vigorously searched for in other experiments .",
    "we will also examine the impact of using this result as exclusion limit to several susy models .    in this paper",
    "we discuss the prospects for susy dark matter in light of the cdms results .",
    "we consider three scenarios : neutralino dark matter in msugra models , neutralino dark matter in models with nonuniversal higgs masses , and sneutrino dark matter in the @xmath0 model , and discuss their predictions for the lhc , tevatron , icecube and pamela experiments .",

    "+   + we note that any sensible mass determination is impossible from just two events  @xcite .",
    "many more events are needed to determine the dark matter mass from the recoil spectrum due to the near degeneracy of the recoil spectrum for a wide range of masses ( determination of mass from the recoil spectrum suffers also from the uncertainty of wimp velocity distribution and halo models ) as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite and , therefore , there is no constraint on the dark matter mass at this point .",
    ".closest fits to @xmath143 gev and @xmath144 pb in the msugra and @xmath3 models .",
    "the corresponding limiting constraint is given in each case .",
    "for the low focus point models , the constraints are the chargino mass bound , @xmath68 , and the higgs mass bound ( 113.4  gev ) .",
    "the situation for nonuniversal models is more relaxed than that in the msugra case and is discussed in the text . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in table 1 we show closest fits for these models if the cdms results @xmath145  pb and @xmath146 gev ( which is obtained using the maximum experimental sensitivity or the lowest point of the curve ) are taken at face value .",
    "we find that the stau - neutralino coannihilation region of the msugra moodel can not accommodate cdms results .",
    "the problems are due to the higgs mass constraint ( for low @xmath49 ) and @xmath68/@xmath38 constraints ( for large @xmath49 ) .",
    "we show the results for higgs masses of 113.4 gev and 114.4 gev , since the theoretical calculation can have @xmath147 gev uncertainty .",
    "it is still possible to find a close fit in the focus point / hyperbolic branch region .",
    "for example , if we choose @xmath148 , @xmath149 gev and @xmath150 gev .",
    "for this point the lsp is a mixture of bino and higgsino and the mass can be @xmath151 gev .",
    "the @xmath152 is within a factor of 2 of the experimental value ( the theoretical uncertainties due to nuclear form factors can be bigger than 2 ) .",
    "since @xmath8 is large , the constraints from @xmath68 or @xmath38 do not apply .",
    "we find similar points for @xmath153 , but the cross section becomes larger . in the nonuniversal scalar mass models",
    "@xcite it is easier to find a solution for these cdms values , since the higgs mass constraint can be lifted by choosing larger @xmath11 values and the @xmath68 constraint can be relaxed by increasing the third generation sparticle masses .",
    "it is possible to have even smaller values of neutralino masses .",
    "for example , for @xmath140 , @xmath150 gev , @xmath154 gev , @xmath155 tev , we can find @xmath156 pb and @xmath157 gev .",
    "for this point , the third generation universal sfermion mass is @xmath158  gev to satisfy the @xmath68 constraint . finally , the @xmath3 model ( assuming that it does not explain the pamela excess ) does not have any problem with 70  gev mass for the dark matter , however the cross section , which is dictated by the @xmath4 mass limit from lep and tevatron , is small by a factor of 6 .",
    "this discrepancy could arise from the uncertainties in the detection rate due to galactic velocity distribution .",
