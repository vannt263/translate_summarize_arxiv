    "the ultimate aim of the next generation of neutrino experiments has to be the measurement of the cp phase of the mns mixing matrix , @xmath3 . assuming that high - energy electrons and positrons can not be distinguished by detectors , our only source of information in a neutrino factory experiment is the number of wrong- and right - sign muons , corresponding ( for neutrinos from muon decay ) to oscillation of @xmath8 and no oscillation of @xmath9 respectively .",
    "it has recently been realised that uncertainties in the electron density along the neutrino flight path may be sufficient to cause problems at long baselines and high energies .",
    "this talk is a summary of our recent work towards resolving the issue of optimal baseline and muon energy for the measurement of @xmath3 at a neutrino factory @xcite .",
    "we considered an indirect cp - violation experiment with @xmath10 useful muon decays and @xmath10 antimuon decays .",
    "taking into account all of the channels @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , we examined whether or not a hypothesis of cp phase equal to @xmath15 is rejected when the true value is @xmath3 . to test this hypothesis",
    ", we used a parameter @xmath16 as defined in @xcite .",
    "the electron number density as a function of distance from the source , @xmath17 , is an input for the oscillation probabilities but is not known exactly .",
    "the current best estimate of the density of the earth as a function of radius is the preliminary reference earth model , derived from seismological data @xcite .",
    "however , it is known that there are sizeable latitude - longitude dependent fluctuations in matter density and composition in the crust and upper mantle @xcite , so local deviations from this spherically - symmetric model may be considerable . to investigate the effect of the uncertainty in electron number density on the usefulness of an experiment",
    ", we introduced a parameter @xmath0 , the overall normalisation of the prem .",
    "hence @xmath16 is a function of six oscillation parameters ( 3 times @xmath18 , 2 times @xmath19 and @xmath3 ) , as well as @xmath0 , where @xmath20 corresponds to the model as given and fluctuations away from the prem can be represented by changing the value of @xmath0 .",
    "the background rate @xmath21 and systematic error on the background @xmath22 were also included in the analysis .",
    "to find the optimum energy and baseline , we used the quantity @xmath23 , defined as the minimum of @xmath16 when we simultaneously vary the mixing angles and mass - squared differences within the region allowed at the 90% confidence level by the atmospheric and solar neutrino data @xcite .",
    "the matter effect normalisation @xmath0 was varied by 5% between 0.95 and 1.05 .",
    "this minimum was found numerically using a ` downhill simplex ' method @xcite .",
    "using @xmath23 , we found the minimum data size @xmath24 , expressed in kt@xmath25yr , which is needed to reject a hypothesis @xmath26 at the 3@xmath27 confidence level when the true value of @xmath3 is @xmath28 .",
    "1.0 cm 1.0 cm",
    "the necessary data size as a function of @xmath29 and @xmath30 was found to have a minimum of around 60 kt@xmath25yr , but the optimal baseline and muon energy varied considerably with the values of @xmath3 , @xmath1 , @xmath21 and the threshold energy for neutrino detection , @xmath31 . at very high energies ,",
    "the contribution of the systematic error to the total error becomes large , and sensitivity is lost . also , the correlation ( @xmath32 ) becomes strong at long baselines , so the optimal @xmath29 is shorter than might otherwise be expected .",
    "the set of parameters @xmath332000 km , @xmath620gev gave the largest range of sensitivity to @xmath3 , down to @xmath7 for @xmath34 , @xmath35gev and a 500kt detector , as shown in fig .",
