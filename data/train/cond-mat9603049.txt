    "martensites , a generic term applied to diffusionless structural transformations producing long - lived metastable phases with characteristic morphologies , are observed in a wide variety of systems@xcite , ranging from metals , alloys and ceramics to organic crystals and crystalline membranes@xcite .",
    "although a substantial amount of empirical knowledge has been acquired over the years , a systematic theoretical study of the morphology and kinetics of martensites@xcite is lacking .",
    "analysis is made difficult by the fact that the formation of martensite is necessarily a non - equilibrium process .",
    "a theory of the martensitic transformation should , therefore , be able to describe the system for _ all _ times , @xmath4 , and strictly equlibrium ( @xmath5 ) descriptions are invalid . in this paper , we derive from microscopics a free energy functional capable of describing a droplet of growing martensite at intermediate times .",
    "we obtain several , empirically observed , morphological features of martensites by minimising the free energy functional subject to appropiate constraints .",
    "in the rest of this section we review relevant aspects of martensite phenomenology .",
    "we derive the droplet free energy functional in section @xmath6 . in section",
    "@xmath7 we use it to investigate the morphology of two - dimensional martensites .",
    "lastly , in section @xmath8 we discuss our results and conclusions .    as a typical example of a martensitic transformation consider the case of steel ( an alloy of iron , fe and carbon , c ) .",
    "pure fe at atmospheric pressures undergoes an equilibrium structural phase transition from the _ austenite _",
    "( @xmath9 ) phase , which has an fcc structure to a bcc , _ ferrite _ ( @xmath10 ) phase , at a temperature @xmath11c . a fast quench from @xmath12 to @xmath13 , produces , however , a rapidly transformed metastable phase called the _ martensite_. on nucleation , martensite `` plates '' grow with a constant front velocity ( @xmath14 in fe)@xcite which is comparable to typical acoustic speeds in solids .",
    "the plates consist of an array of twinned or slipped bcc crystals , having well defined orientational relations with each other and with the parent matrix .",
    "the miller indices of the _ habit plane _ ( the equatorial plane of the plates ) , are fixed relative to the parent .",
    "the morphology of the plates depends on the elastic moduli of the solid , ranging from `` lens - shaped '' discs ( typically @xmath15 ) with a high aspect ratio in the case of hard fe - based alloys to a region bounded by a single interface in the case of the softer in - tl alloys .",
    "if the elastic energy barriers are large , the plates stop on colliding with other plates .",
    "the resulting pattern displays a scale invariant size distribution of the plates@xcite .",
    "several empirical facts suggest that martensites are _ always metastable _ with respect to the ferrite .",
    "firstly , the detailed morphology of the plates is a sensitive function of the quench history .",
    "secondly , mechanical properties of martensites are dependent on _ aging _ and _ tempering _  metallurgical processes which consist of holding steel at elevated temperatures for specific periods of time to obtain required properties .",
    "lastly , martensites are never formed when steel is cooled sufficiently slowly , thus there is an intimate relation between the kinetics of cooling and the morphology  slow cooling nucleates a spherical droplet of the ferrite , while rapid quenching produces a martensite with a well - defined morphology .",
    "any theory of the martensitic transformation should therefore include variables that change slowly over time scales corresponding to the nucleation front propagation .",
    "such typical `` slow modes''of a solid@xcite undergoing a first - order structural transformation are the displacement field @xmath16 ( goldstone mode ) , the mass and momentum densities @xmath17 and @xmath18 ( conservation laws ) and the strain tensor @xmath19 ( the symmetry breaking order parameter ) .",
    "imagine , however , a grain of the product nucleating within a parent matrix at time @xmath20 .",
    "it is clear ( fig .  1 ) , that an atomic mismatch is generated at the parent - product interface@xcite as soon as the nucleus is formed .",
    "this mismatch appears as a discontinuity in the normal component of the displacement field across the parent - product interface@xcite ( a consequence of the fact that the @xmath21 structural transformation involves a spontaneous breaking of a discrete symmetry ) , @xmath22 , and leads to a local compression or dilation of the atomic environment at the interface . since in martensites ,",
    "the transformation front velocity , @xmath23 , is large compared to atomic diffusion times , @xmath24 appears as a _ new slow mode _ ( vacancy field ) .",
    "once formed , this new field , relaxes diffusively over a time scale @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the typical size of the grains .",
    "a langevin description of the dynamics of the front , requires a free - energy functional _ which describes all intermediate configurations between an austenite and a ferrite_. thus the free - energy functional should include configurations corresponding to crystalline inclusions of the @xmath10 phase in the @xmath9 phase , where the vacancy field @xmath2 appears explicitly .",
    "the usual elastic free - energy functional of a solid , @xmath27 , has to be augmented by an interfacial term@xcite , @xmath28 , describing the parent - product interface .",
    "it must be stressed that these droplet configurations do not affect equilibrium behaviour .",
    "thus the equilibrium ferrite will be obtained by minimising @xmath27 .",
    "the dynamics , however , is crucially altered by the inclusion of such fluctuations . in the next section",
    "we derive , starting from a microscopic density functional theory , a free energy functional which includes such droplet fluctuations .",
    "consider a droplet of the product phase of size @xmath26 within a parent matrix bounded by an interface of thickness @xmath29 .",
    "the presence of the droplet results in a strained parent crystal such that the strain varies from zero far away from the droplet to a limiting value at its center .",
    "the free - energy functional@xcite of this strained parent is given by , @xmath30 where @xmath31 represent the lattice vectors of the parent crystal , @xmath32 are the displacement fields ( deviation of each atom from the ( perfect ) lattice positions of the parent ) , and @xmath33 is the direct correlation function@xcite of the liquid at freezing .",
    "the above expression is exact at @xmath34 ; corrections are of the order of the r.m.s .",
    "fluctuations of the atoms about their perfect lattice positions , which are small in the solid phase .    since the range of @xmath35 is of order @xmath29 , the sum over @xmath36 in eq .",
    "[ eq : free ] , can be split into three parts  ( i ) @xmath37 , ( ii ) @xmath38 and ( iii ) @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "expanding @xmath41 about @xmath42 in the first two parts , leads to the usual bulk elastic free - energy functional @xmath27 .",
    "however , as argued above , the assumption of continuity breaks down in ( iii ) , and so _ such an expansion can not be carried out_. in the limit @xmath43 , the interface can be parametrized by a sharp surface @xmath44 , with @xmath42 and @xmath45 lying infinitesimally close to @xmath46 . across this interface ,",
    "the normal component of @xmath47 is discontinuous ; @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the unit normal to the interface .",
    "the discontinuity @xmath50 is the local vacancy field , while @xmath51 is the local density and @xmath52 is the density averaged over a unit cell of the parent . in the continuum limit ,",

    "\\label{eq : int}\\ ] ] the coefficient @xmath55 is clearly the inverse _ surface compressibility modulus _ of vacancies , @xmath2 .",
    "this is expected to be of the same order of magnitude as the other elastic moduli , and thus ranges from @xmath56 for soft materials ( e.g. , in - tl ) to @xmath57 for hard materials ( e.g. , fe - ni ) .",
    "since the strains @xmath58 are continuous across the interface , we replace the delta function in eq .  [ eq : int ] by a regulator @xmath59 $ ] , so that the final regulated free - energy functional which incorporates _ all the slow modes _ in the problem is , @xmath60    at the intial time ( @xmath20 ) , the transformed region ( product ) is simply obtained as a geometrical deformation of the parent , fig .  1 , which fixes the initial value of @xmath2 . having created this discontinuity @xmath2 at the parent - product interface , it will diffuse over a time @xmath61 .",
    "note the two time scales relevant to our kinetics  the quench rate @xmath62 and the vacancy relaxation time @xmath61 .",
    "accordingly , two extreme dynamical limits , suggest themselves  a `` slow quench '' , @xmath63 , where the @xmath2 field relaxes instantaneously ; and a `` fast quench '' , @xmath64 , where the @xmath2 field is `` frozen '' in the frame of reference of the moving nucleation front and @xmath2 relaxes only once the growth of the front stops@xcite .",
    "consequences of an infinitely _ slow _ quench is well known from standard classical nucleation theory@xcite since the @xmath2 field relaxes to zero instantaneously and hence does not contribute . in the next section we study infinitely",
    "_ fast _ quenches which produce martensitic morphologies in the simple setting of a two - dimensional first order structural transformation .",
    "we study the first - order structural transformation from a square ( austenite ) to a rhombus ( ferrite ) unit cell in two dimensions@xcite .",
    "our results , which can be easily extended to the tetragonal to orthorhombic transition ( essentially a 2-dim square to rectangular@xcite ) , are of relevance to structural transformations in alloys like in - pb , in - tl , mn - fe .",
    "this transformation involves a shear+volume deformation , and so the strain order parameter @xmath1 has only one nontrivial component @xmath65 .",
    "the bulk elastic free energy has three minima  one corresponding to the undeformed square cell ( @xmath66 ) and the other two corresponding to the two variants of the rhombic cell ( @xmath67 ) .",

    "the parameter @xmath74 is the degree of undercooling and plays the role of temperature .",
    "an infinitely fast quench implies that the @xmath2 field is `` frozen '' in the frame of reference travelling with the front , @xmath75 and @xmath76 , where @xmath77 denotes the derivitive with respect to time .",
    "quenching the solid across the structural transition , nucleates an inclusion which initially grows as a ferrite .",
    "further growth as a single - domain ferrite is discouraged by @xmath28 .",
    "the growing nucleus , gets around this problem by creating a twin .",
    "this costs interfacial energy which is however small .",
    "we use a variational strain profile to include specifically such twinned domains . for a start",
    ", let us consider a rectangular nucleus of length @xmath26 ( along the @xmath78-axis ) and width @xmath79 ( along the @xmath80-axis ) .",

    "the thickness of the austenite - ferrite interface along the @xmath78-axis ( @xmath80-axis ) is @xmath93 ( @xmath29 ) within which @xmath87 interpolates linearly between @xmath94 and @xmath91 ( or @xmath89 ) .",

    "the free energy , once minimized with respect to the widths , is a function of @xmath26 , @xmath79 and @xmath81 .",
    "as is aparent from eq.[rect ] , @xmath3 goes through a minimum as @xmath81 is varied , for every value of @xmath26 and @xmath79 .",
    "this is a consequence of the competition between the interfacial energy at the twin interface ( which disfavours twinning ) and the interfacial energy at the parent  -product interface which favours twinning since it reduces @xmath2 .",
    "minimising the free energy with respect to the number of twins @xmath81 immediately gives us , @xmath97 ( fig 3 ) .",

    "a relation similar to ours has been obtained ( with @xmath102 ) from equilibrium continuum elastic theory@xcite .",
    "it should be noted here , however , that the statement we make is stronger  we imply that @xmath97 _ for all times _ during the growth of a martensite plate as a consequence of demanding _ local _ equilibrium . our prediction for @xmath96 can be verified from in situ transmission electron microscopic studies of growing martensite fronts .    the free energy minimised with respect to _ all _ the `` fast '' variables ( viz .",
    "the interfacial widths and @xmath81 ) is plotted in fig .",
    "one observes that for @xmath103 ( fig 4 ) , the free energy , for all choices of @xmath26 , shows a minimum in @xmath79 for @xmath104 , so that the system will always prefer to have thin rectangular strips reminiscent of acicular martensites seen in fe - ni or fe - c systems . for @xmath105 there is no such minimum and the martensitic region would like to grow in both directions .",
    "once growth in one of the directions traverses the entire extent of the sample , growth will proceed thereafter only along a single interface .",
    "such single interface growth is seen in `` soft '' in - tl systems .",
    "the critical nucleus is obtained by locating the saddle point in each of these free energy surfaces . using the quantity @xmath106 as a measure of the sharpness of the interface ( indeed one can talk of a definite droplet shape only if the size of the droplet is larger than this measure )",
    ", we find that the critical nucleus is diffuse for both @xmath103 ( @xmath107 ) and @xmath105 ( @xmath108 ) .",
    "however , as the size of the droplet increases @xmath109 rapidly reduces to zero in both cases .    in summary , we have derived from microscopics a free energy functional @xmath110 $ ] capable of describing droplets of a martensitic product enclosed within a parent austenitic matrix .",
    "essential to this description is a new field @xmath24 viz .",
    "the geometric mismatch between the parent and the product at the austenite - martensite interface .",
    "this mismatch relaxes diffusively . for martensites ,",
    "the typical front velocities are empirically known to be very high so that @xmath24 fails to relax within the timescale of front motion .",
    "we have therefore minimised our droplet free energy functional , using a variational strain profile , subject to the constraint @xmath111 .",
    "we show that typical martensite morphologies drop out naturally from such a procedure",
    ". the condition of local equilibrium yields experimentally verifiable quantitative morphological features . in this context , it is worth noting that in practice , real martensites in `` hard '' systems ( eg .",
    "fe - ni ) do not occur as rectangular strips but as lens shaped objects .",
    "the following argument will show that a droplet in the form of `` convex - lens '' has , in fact , lower energy . the interfacial energy at either end of the rectangular strip ( where the interface is along the @xmath112 direction ) is @xmath113 , where @xmath114 is the width of the strip at @xmath115 .",
    "this can be reduced further by making @xmath114 ( and @xmath116 , the width of the strip at @xmath117 ) as small as possible .",
