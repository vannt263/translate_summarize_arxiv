    "clusters of galaxies are known to contain a large fraction of their mass in the form of x - ray emitting gas in the temperature range @xmath5  k. the primary x - ray emission from the intracluster medium ( icm ) is thermal bremsstrahlung and line emission due to this hot diffuse gas .",
    "however , the possibility that some of the emission may be nonthermal has been raised in the past ( e.g. bridle & feldman 1972 ; harris & romanishin 1974 ) .",
    "the most likely mechanism for nonthermal emission in the icm is inverse compton ( ic ) scattering of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons off relativistic ( gev ) intracluster electrons .",
    "the presence of such energetic electrons is even more likely within galaxy clusters that are known to have significant radio emission , as it is suggested that the same relativistic electron population produces the synchrotron emission . as a result , the power law slope of the nonthermal x - ray emission and that of the synchrotron radio emission are expected to be the same .",
    "whereas very high energy electrons with short lifetimes are required for synchrotron radio emission , lower energy electrons can scatter cmb photons up to x - ray energies ( felten and morrison 1966 ) . for an electron with energy @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the lorentz factor , the final frequency of a cmb photon ( @xmath8 ) after scattering off the energetic electron will be ( e.g. pacholczyk 1970 ) _",
    "x=4 ^2 _ b 3 .",
    "combining the x - ray inverse compton and the radio synchrotron emission fluxes , a lower limit to the magnetic field and an upper limit to the energy density of relativistic electrons can be derived _",
    "independent _ of equipartition or equal energy hypotheses .",
    "deriving a lower limit for the mean value of the magnetic field in the icm is particularly important for at least two reasons .",
    "first , it affects total mass and baryonic fraction estimates of the cluster because of the possibility of extra magnetic pressure support .",
    "this has important consequences for the underlying cosmological model and estimating the value of the cosmological parameter @xmath9 .",
    "for example , in the core of a2218 the x - ray mass estimate , under the assumption that the gas is supported by thermal pressure _ alone _ , is lower than the gravitational lensing estimate by a factor of @xmath10 .",
    "it has been suggested that nonthermal pressure support is a plausible explanation for the discrepancy ( loeb & mao 1994 ) .",
    "second , detection of nonthermal emission and estimates of magnetic field strength have important implications for cooling flows , since the presence of the field can suppress conduction and affect cooling of the gas .",
    "incidentally , we point out that it has been suggested that the luminous extreme - ultraviolet ( euv ) emission recently discovered in clusters of galaxies is also a result of inverse compton scattering of cmb radiation by low energy cosmic ray electrons ( @xmath11 ) in the intracluster medium ( sarazin & lieu 1998 ) .",
    "these particles have been suggested to be a relic population of cosmic rays produced by nonthermal activity over the lifetime of the cluster .",
    "aside from exploring nonthermal emission in clusters and deriving limits on the icm magnetic fields and relativistic electron energy density , hard x - ray observations are needed in the study of clusters that show evidence of extremely high temperatures .",
    "there is ample evidence that a component of extremely hot gas exists in some clusters ( e.g. abell 754 ) that can not be explained by the depth of the gravitational potential ( henriksen & markevitch 1996 ; roettiger , stone & mushotzky 1998 ) .",
    "such hard x - ray emission could be the result of hydrodynamical processes such as shocks .",
    "many clusters are believed to have formed through merger events as predicted in hierarchical large - scale structure models . as a result , due to the collision of subclumps and merging effects ,",
    "very high temperature shocked gas can be produced in the icm .",
    "there is evidence that abell 754 , a rich cluster of galaxies at @xmath12 , is a merger in progress .",
    "the x - ray emission is offset significantly from the bimodal galaxy distribution .",
    "furthermore , the intracluster medium is found to be nonisothermal ( henriksen & markevitch 1996 ) .",
    "its x - ray morphology is asymmetric and not centered on the galaxy distribution .",
    "our goal in observing this cluster with rxte is two - fold .",
    "one is to constrain the hottest temperature component of its icm using high energy data .",
    "this complements the softer x - ray studies with asca and provides further constraints for numerical models of cluster evolution that , in turn , are necessary to constrain the underlying physical processes in the icm .",
    "the second goal is to search for evidence of nonthermal emission in the integrated spectrum from the cluster and to constrain the magnetic field and relativistic electron energy density in the icm .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in  2 , we review the derivation of magnetic field and relativistic electron energy density limits from radio and x - ray observations . in  3 , we describe the x - ray observations and the data reduction procedure . in  4 , we present the results of the analysis .",
    "this includes results of spectral analysis using both isothermal and multi - temperature models ( constructed from numerical simulations ) , and constraints on nonthermal emission . in  5 , we discuss the implications of these results and present our conclusions .",
    "nonthermal x - ray emission in the intracluster medium is expected to arise as a result of the boosting of cmb photons to x - ray energies from scattering off relativistic electrons .",
    "this process is more likely in clusters with diffuse radio halos , since synchrotron radiation can be produced by this same population of relativistic electrons traversing the icm magnetic field . from synchrotron emission alone , it is difficult to decouple the relativistic electron density from the magnetic field strength without invoking the equipartition hypothesis . on the other hand ,",
    "the electron spectrum can be derived from the x - ray emission produced via inverse compton scattering by energetic electrons of cmb photons , independent of the knowledge of the magnetic field .",
    "the radio synchrotron emission measurement can then be used to derive limits on both the magnetic field strength and the electron energy density averaged along the line of sight .",
    "detailed calculations are given , for example , in harris & romanishin ( 1974 ) , harris & grindlay ( 1979 ) , and rephaeli ( 1977a , b ) with many of the fundamental formulae given in pacholczyk ( 1970 ) . here ,",
    "following henriksen ( 1998 ) , we review this technique from fundamental arguments .    the number density of relativistic electrons in the icm can be described by a power law distribution n()=n_0 ^ -p , _ min _ max where @xmath13 is the electron lorentz factor , and @xmath14 is the amplitude coefficient . for this electron distribution , the synchrotron and inverse compton emission fluxes",

    "abell 754 was observed with the _ proportional counter array _ ( pca ) and the _ high energy x - ray timing experiment _ ( hexte ) instruments on board _ rxte _ during december of 1997 for a total duration of 70  ks .",
    "the pca ( jahoda et al . 1996 ) has a total collecting area of 6500  @xmath38 , an energy range of @xmath39  kev , and energy resolution of @xmath40 at 6  kev .",
    "the collimator field of view is approximately circular ( @xmath41 diameter ) with fwhm of @xmath42 .",

    "furthermore , each cluster `` rocks '' along mutually orthogonal directions to provide background measurements away from the source .",
    "we used the most recent pca background estimator program _ pcabackest _",
    "( version  2.0c ; l7 model ) provided by the _ rxte _ gof ( guest observer facility ) to estimate the background .",
    "in addition to the intrinsic instrument background , and the cosmic x - ray background ( cxb ) , additional counts are induced via saa ( southern atlantic anomaly ) passages .",
    "a754 observations were performed during non - saa orbits and therefore the activation induced background was estimated to be zero by _ pcabackest_.    we used the data taken when all 5 detectors of the pca were on and the elevation angle from the limb of the earth was greater than @xmath45 .",
    "this reduced the good time interval for the purpose of analysis to @xmath46  ks . for this time duration , the background subtracted count rate over the @xmath47  kev band was @xmath48 .",
    "the background subtracted count rate over the @xmath49  kev energy band was @xmath50 and @xmath51 for hexte clusters a and b , respectively .",
    "the total on - source integration time for the hexte detectors was 20  ks .",
    "x - ray images of a754 from the rosat pspc archive indicate that the radio galaxy 26w20 , a member of the cluster , lies in the field of view of rxte .",
    "since one of the goals of our investigation is to search for evidence of nonthermal emission in the icm , we need to investigate the contribution of this galaxy to the integrated nonthermal emission from the cluster .",
    "the pspc data , obtained in november 1992 , reveal this source to be approximately @xmath52 from the center of a754 , with a spectrum which is well - described as a power - law with a hydrogen column density of @xmath53 @xmath54 , and photon index of @xmath55 .",
    "the @xmath56 kev flux of this source is @xmath57 ergs @xmath54 s@xmath58 , with a nominal 10% error . with this spectrum",
    ", the @xmath59 kev flux would correspond to @xmath60 ergs @xmath54 s@xmath58 , a factor of @xmath61 smaller than the integrated flux of a754 in the same band .",
    "furthermore , at the position of the source in the field of view of pca , the transmission is only about a third of the full response at the center of the field of view .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the contribution of 26w20 to the total integrated flux from a754 ( particularly in the @xmath59 band ) is negligible and does not affect the temperature determination of this cluster . on the other hand , the @xmath62  kev flux of this galaxy would correspond to @xmath63 ergs @xmath54 s@xmath58 .",
    "since only about a third of this flux will get transmitted through the collimator , its contribution in the @xmath62  kev band will be @xmath64 ergs @xmath54 s@xmath58 .",
    "we discuss its effect on the detection of nonthermal ic radiation in  4.3 .",
    "in addition to rxte data , we have extracted _ ginga _  lac and _ asca _",
    "gis2 spectra from archival observations of this cluster with exposure times of 10 and 20  ks , respectively . the background subtracted count rate for the lac over the @xmath65  kev range was @xmath66 , while for the gis2 over @xmath67  kev was @xmath68 . in",

( 1988 ) for the extended radio source they associate with a possible diffuse ( @xmath69 ) halo in a754 has a flux density of 137  mjy .",
    "the synchrotron flux can then be written as @xmath70 , where we have used the @xmath71 reported by mills , hunstead , & skellern ( 1978 ) and jaffe and rudnick ( 1979 ) at 408 mhz and 610 mhz , respectively , since it is expected that the lowest frequency data should have the least contamination from discrete radio sources .",

    "can then be written as f_s=1.1 10 ^ -12 ^-1.3 ergs s^-1 cm^-2 hz^-1 .",
    "we will use this flux relation in  4.3 to estimate a lower limit for the magnetic field and an upper limit for the relativistic electron energy density .",
    "we first attempt to fit the a754 spectrum with the redshifted , optically thin collisional ionization equilibrium plasma model of raymond and smith ( raymond & smith 1977 ) . for comparison purposes",
    ", we first fit the spectra from rxte pca , ginga lac , and asca gis2 independently over the @xmath75  kev range ( the overlapping energy band in all 3 instruments ) with an isothermal model .",
    "table  1 summarizes the fit parameters and the field of view of each instrument .",
    "note that a754 has a diameter of approximately @xmath76 , and fits within the field of view of all the above - mentioned instruments .",
    "reassuringly , the fitting results are consistent for all instruments within their respective error bars .",
    "we then fit the pca / lac / gis2/hexte spectra simultaneously in the @xmath1  kev energy band .",
    "figure  1 shows the results of the fit , while table  2 summarizes the best fit parameters .",
    "the fit is satisfactory and the derived average temperature of @xmath0  kev is consistent ( within error bars ) with the temperature derived from each individual instrument .",
    "it is also consistent with the emissivity - weighted average temperature previously derived using asca data ( henriksen and markevitch 1996 ) .",
    "the simultaneous pca / hexte fit also yields similar results within error bars ( although the size of the error bars are larger than the ones quoted in table  2 ) .",

    "two clusters are allowed to merge under the influence of their mutual gravity , having been given an initial relative velocity of 270 @xmath77 parallel to the line connecting the centers of the two subclusters and 100 @xmath77 perpendicular to this direction .",
    "this results in a slightly off - axis merger with an impact parameter of @xmath78120 kpc and final impact velocity of @xmath79 .",

    "figure  2a shows the fractional distribution ( by volume ) of gas at a given temperature within a 2 mpc box centered on the x - ray emission .",
    "the cooler peak ( at @xmath80  kev ) represents the initial primary cluster temperature .",
    "all gas hotter than @xmath787 kev has been heated by the merger .",
    "in particular , the extended high temperature tail is the result of a shock along the leading edge of one of the subclusters to the nw .",
    "figure  2b shows the fractional distribution of the emission measure of the gas at a given temperature within the same region described for panel ( a ) .",
    "the two peaks in ( a ) have merged into one near 7.5  kev .",
    "the effective emission - weighted temperature within this region is @xmath789 kev similar to that derived from observations .",
    "we implemented this model by summing a series of redshifted multi - temperature raymond - smith plasma components of fixed temperature and relative emission measure following that presented in figure  2b , and fitted the data allowing the column density @xmath81 and metal abundance  assumed identical for all temperature components  to vary . the goodness - of - fit ( @xmath82 for 636 d.o.f . )",
    "to the simultaneous rxte / asca / ginga data for this model is slightly poorer but comparable to that of the isothermal model . the best fit hydrogen column density and abundances for this model are also similar , @xmath83 @xmath54 and @xmath84 solar , respectively .",
    "essentially , this model is indistinguishable from the isothermal model in moderate energy resolution integrated x - ray spectra .",
    "this point can be further illustrated in figure  3 where we have plotted the expected flux for the isothermal ( dashed line ) and multi - temperature model ( solid line ) , respectively , using the pca response function .",
    "the two models are nearly indistinguishable up to about 15  kev . above 20",
    "kev the difference in the hard tail widens .",
    "however , at 40  kev , the multi - temperature model differs from the isothermal model flux by approximately @xmath85 . this difference is smaller than @xmath86 or the fluctuations on cosmic x - ray background ( cxb ) per rxte beam at 40  kev . since any high temperature gas present in the cluster , as predicted in numerical merger simulations , has a small emission measure compared to that of the bulk of the gas , the integrated spectra of the two models are indistinguishable with current instruments .      to constrain the nonthermal emission in hard x - rays , we fit the rxte data ( pca and hexte ) with an isothermal plus a power law model .",
    "we assumed that the power law photon index in the x - ray model is that obtained from the radio observations (  3.2 ) . to model the contribution of 26w20 in the field of view ( 40 away from the center as discussed in  3.1 )",
    ", we included a fixed power law component of photon index 2 with a flux of @xmath87 in the @xmath62 kev band . at the 90% confidence limit",
    ", the combined thermal plus power law fit to the data gives only an upper limit of @xmath88 for the nonthermal flux at 20  kev .",
    "integrated over the @xmath62  kev band , the flux upper limit is @xmath89 . at the 99.7% confidence limit ( or @xmath90 level ) , the above upper limits increase to @xmath91 and @xmath92 , respectively .",
    "the above result neglects the effect of cxb fluctuations in the spectrum .",
    "however , these fluctuations have been determined to be about 8% rms of the mean cxb ( gruber 1998 ) per rxte field of view . using the energy flux ( in units of @xmath93 ) f(e)=7.9 e^-0.29 ( -e/41.13kev ) , 3kev < e < 60 kev , for the cxb ( gruber 1992 )",
    ", the fluctuation amplitude amounts to @xmath94 per rxte field of view at 20 kev .",
    "since this value is comparable to the nonthermal upper limit derived for a754 , the effect of cxb fluctuations on modeling of the data can not be neglected . to determine a more accurate upper limit , we modeled the fluctuation spectrum by equation ( 13 ) and fixed its amplitude in our spectral modeling . at the 90% confidence limit ,",
    "a positive full amplitude fluctuation ( i.e. 8% of the cxb ) yields an upper limit of @xmath95 for the nonthermal flux at 20  kev and an integrated flux of @xmath96 in the 10 - 40  kev band . at the 99.7% confidence limit ,",

    "note that the electron energy range over which we integrated equation ( 10 ) corresponds to radio emission in the range @xmath110  mhz ( @xmath111 ; @xmath112 , which is the frequency of maximum synchrotron emission ( pacholczyk 1970 ) .",
    "our calculations , therefore , assume that the radio spectrum extends down to 16  mhz with the same spectral index .",
    "we note that from simultaneous analysis of heao-1 and asca data , henriksen ( 1998 ) finds a lower limit of @xmath113  @xmath4 g for this cluster .",
    "we have presented x - ray observations and data analysis of abell 754 , a cluster in the process of a merger event .",
    "in addition to the newly obtained rxte pca / hexte data , we obtained archival asca gis and ginga lac data of this cluster and simultaneously fitted the spectra from all 4 instruments .",
    "we found that the integrated spectrum of the whole cluster in the @xmath1  kev energy band can be fitted well with an isothermal collisional ionization equilibrium plasma model ( raymond & smith 1977 ) of temperature @xmath0  kev , consistent within the error bars with previous temperature measurements of this cluster .",
    "we then fitted the data with a multi - temperature model derived from numerical simulations of two merging subclusters with conditions similar to those found in abell 754 ( roettiger et al .",
    "the average emission weighted temperature from the simulations was @xmath0  kev , similar to that found from observations . in this model ,",
    "the emission measure from the very hot gas , shock - heated in the merger , is relatively small . as a result ,",
    "this model produces a fit to the data of similar quality to that of the isothermal model .",
    "calculation of the resultant spectrum from the two models indicates that the two spectra are nearly indistinguishable below @xmath114  kev and it is only above 20  kev that the hard x - ray tails from the two models depart .",
    "however , the difference between the two models at 40  kev is less than @xmath115 , lower than the amplitude of the cxb fluctuations at that energy per rxte field of view .",
    "hence , the two models are indistinguishable with the obtained rxte spectrum .    to search for evidence of nonthermal emission from the cluster",
    ", we added a power law to the isothermal model with the photon index fixed at the value obtained for the radio emission power law .",
    "no significant nonthermal emission was found .",
    "however , the rxte data implies an upper limit ( 90% confidence limit ) of @xmath116 for the nonthermal flux at 20  kev , where the lower and upper numbers are those derived assuming a full positive and negative cxb fluctuation amplitude as discussed in  4.3 , respectively . using the upper limit flux integrated over the @xmath62  kev band and the radio emission data from andernach et al .",
    "( 1988 ) , we find an upper limit of @xmath108 for the relativistic electron energy density and a lower limit of @xmath109 g for the magnetic field strength in the intracluster medium , where the given ranges represent the inclusion of positive and negative cxb fluctuations .",
    "the magnetic field would have to be two orders of magnitude greater than this lower limit in order for the average magnetic pressure to be comparable to the average thermal pressure in the hot gas . in regions of higher than average density where the field would be expected to be compressed to higher values ,",
    "the thermal pressure is enhanced by a comparable factor .",
    "therefore , there is no evidence for dynamically important magnetic fields in a754 .",
    "the upper limit to the magnetic field derived assuming energy equipartition of the magnetic field with the relativistic electrons is @xmath117 g , below ( or comparable ) to the lower limit field strength derived from combining radio and x - ray observations ( depending on the unknown level of the cxb fluctuations for that region of the sky ) .",
    "if it is the case that the equipartition field is lower than that observed , one interpretation is that since abell 754 is undergoing a merger , magnetic fields are being amplified in the merger process and the ensuing turbulence .",
    "this interpretation has been confirmed in numerical simulations of cluster mergers where the field is observed to be amplified by several factors in localized regions ( roettiger , stone , & burns 1998 ) .",
    "unfortunately , it is difficult to draw any firm conclusions regarding the relation between the equipartition value and the actual strength of the magnetic field in a754 based on the available data .",
    "higher resolution vla 90 cm radio images of the extended emission and higher spatial resolution x - ray images ( e.g. with axaf ) are needed to make more definitive statements",
    ".    there have been several lines of speculation on magnetic field generation in the icm .",
    "one school of thought is that galactic wakes power a dynamo ( e.g. jaffe 1980 ; roland 1981 ) .",
    "however , as shown by goldman & rephaeli ( 1991 ) and de young ( 1992 ) , galactic wakes do not adequately produce the observed fields .",
    "it has been suggested that more powerful sources such as cluster mergers could be responsible ( e.g. de young 1992 ) . since both magnetic field amplification and reacceleration of energetic particles is expected in cluster mergers from the resulting shocks and turbulence , large scale radio halos are likely to be formed around these clusters .",
    "however , while the magnetic reconnection time in the intracluster medium , t_rec 2 10 ^ 9 ( 0.1)^-1 ( l_t 1kpc ) ( b ) ^-1(n_p 0.1 cm^-3)^1/2 yr , is long ( where the reconnection proceeds with an average velocity of @xmath118 and @xmath119 ; soker & sarazin 1990 ) , the inverse compton energy loss time given by t_ic = m_e c^2 _ t c",
    "^2 u_cmb 4.8 10 ^ 8 ( 4800)^-1 yr for an electron of energy @xmath120  kev ( @xmath121 ) is comparatively short . this may be the underlying reason for radio halos to be a transient phenomenon and the fact that they are usually associated with cluster mergers or dynamically young clusters ( tribble 1993 ) .",
