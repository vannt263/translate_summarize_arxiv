    "non - equilibrium statistical physics presents fundamental questions that may require the use of approaches and quantities which has no analogue in equilibrium context .",
    "one of these quantities is the production of entropy , which vanishes in equilibrium and is positive in non - equilibrium and may thus characterize a system out of thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "the time derivative of entropy @xmath4 of a system can be decomposed into two components @xcite as @xmath5 where one has the entropy production rate , @xmath6 , and entropy flux , @xmath7 .",
    "the former is the contribution to the entropy by the system itself and is always non - negative .",
    "the latter , the entropy flux , is the contribution due to the environment , and can have either signs : the flux is positive if the entropy leaves the system .",
    "these functions distinguish different dynamics regimes , since in the stationary state they are equal , @xmath8 ( but not necessarily zero ) ; furthermore , in equilibrium state , they both vanish , @xmath9 .    equation ( [ 1 ] ) is useful in the study of models in statistical mechanics as long as we know the statistical definitions of the quantities @xmath4 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 for systems out of equilibrium .",
    "here we are interested in models described by a continuous time markovian process , that is , governed by the master equation @xcite @xmath10 , \\label{4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is the probability of finding the system in state @xmath12 at time @xmath13 and @xmath14 is the transition rate from state @xmath15 to state @xmath12 .",
    "the definition of entropy @xmath4 in thermodynamic equilibrium or out of equilibrium is given by the boltzmann - gibbs expression @xmath16 and the entropy production rate is given by @xcite @xmath17 \\ln\\frac{w_{ij}p_{j}(t)}{w_{ji}p_{i}(t ) } , \\label{5}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] an expression that has been considered by several authors@xcite .    from the time derivative of entropy , @xmath18 \\ln\\frac{p_{j}(t)}{p_{i}(t ) } , \\label{7}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] obtained by the use of the master equation , and the definition of @xmath6 , we find from ( [ 1 ] ) that the entropy flux is given by @xmath19 \\ln\\frac{w_{ij}}{w_{ji}}. \\label{6}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is seen that the entropy production rate given by expression ( [ 5 ] ) is non - negative .",
    "moreover , it vanishes in thermodynamic equilibrium , in which case detailed balance condition is fulfilled , that is , @xmath20 .",
    "the expression analogous to ( [ 5 ] ) has also been obtained for systems described by a fokker - planck equation @xcite .",
    "the calculation of the production of entropy of lattice models has been done in several models ; in some cases , by the use of numerical simulations @xcite . in this paper",
    "we consider a system of particles moving along a one - dimensional lattice with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "they hop to the right or to the left with distinct rates denoted by @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively , so that in the stationary state the system is not in thermodynamic equilibrium and the entropy production rate is non - zero .",
    "we analyse two models : the first is a system of non - interacting particles in which case the problem is reduced to solving the master equation for just one - particle that performs an asymmetric random walk along a chain of @xmath21 sites . the second model is a system of exclusion particles that hop to the right and left with transition rates @xmath0 and @xmath1 along a chain of @xmath21 sites . in addition , they may be created in pairs , with rate @xmath22 , and annihilated in pairs , with rate @xmath23 .",
    "both models are solved exactly , the second with the condition @xmath24 , but we have also analysed the case without this constraint in pair approximation . from the solutions , we have determined the entropy production rate . in the stationary state we show that it can be written in the bilinear form @xcite @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 is the current of particles which is shown to vanish when @xmath28 as @xmath29 .",
    "therefore , near thermodynamic equilibrium , which occurs when @xmath30 , the entropy production rate vanishes as @xmath31 .",
    "a one - dimensional diffusive particle will be considered here .",
    "the state of this particle can be identified with the ( discrete ) position @xmath32 it can occupy over a chain .",
    "the distribution probability @xmath33 is governed by the master equation , @xmath34 , \\label{me}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 is the transition rate from state @xmath36 to @xmath32 , given by @xmath37 in this setup , the particle jumps to the right with rate @xmath0 and to the left with rate @xmath1 .",
    "the parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 will be taken to be both strictly positive .",
    "the transition is short - ranged in the sense that the particle moves to one of its neighbour site per movement .",
    "the master equation for this model can be restated as @xmath38 which can be solved exactly . if the initial condition is taken to be @xmath39",
    ", the probability distribution is @xmath40 where @xmath41 stands for modified bessel function ( first kind ) .",
    "we start by calculating the entropy flux .",
    "applying formula ( [ 6 ] ) to the present case , one has @xmath42\\ln\\frac{p}{q } + \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{n}\\big [ q p_{n}(t ) - pp_{n-1}(t)\\big]\\ln\\frac{q}{p } , \\label{phi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and it is straightforward to see that @xmath43 note that this value for the entropy flux does not depend on time and is a non - negative quantity .    instead of using formula ( [ 5 ] ) to calculate the entropy production rate , we determine the entropy derivative @xmath44 and sum to @xmath7 to get @xmath45 . now from formula ( [ 7 ] ) we have @xmath46 \\ln\\frac{p_{n}(t)}{p_{n+1}(t)}. \\label{dsdt}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] replacing ( [ pn ] ) into ( [ dsdt ] ) we may calculate @xmath44 .",
    "the graphs of @xmath44 calculated numerically from ( [ dsdt ] ) together with @xmath7 given by ( [ phi_p ] ) and @xmath45 are shown in figure 1 , where one can see that the entropy production has the tendency to match the entropy flux with time , which leads the time derivative of entropy , @xmath44 , to zero , as expected .",
    "the system converges to a stationary state , and the way it reaches is discussed in the next section , where a continuous version of the model is analysed by means of a fokker - planck equation .    , entropy flux @xmath7 and time variation of entropy @xmath44 versus time . in this example , @xmath47 and @xmath48 . ]    in the steady state @xmath8 so that from ( [ phi_p ] ) we find the result for the entropy production rate @xmath49 now the current of particles is @xmath50 and we may write @xmath51 where @xmath52 .      in the continuous case , which means a ( biased ) random walk on the real line , one can pass from the master equation ( [ me_dif ] ) to a fokker - planck equation .",
    "the continuous limit of the master equation is obtained as follows .",
    "we assume that the possible positions of the particle are @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the spacing between consecutive positions .",
    "writing @xmath55 and expanding @xmath56 and @xmath57 up to quadratic terms in @xmath54 , we get @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "the parameter @xmath61 is the diffusion constant and @xmath62 controls the drift of the particle to the right if @xmath63 or to the left if @xmath64 .",
    "therefore , @xmath65 corresponds to @xmath30 in the previous discrete model and @xmath66 to positive values of @xmath62 .",
    "defining the function @xmath67 the fokker - planck equation can be casted as @xmath68 which is a continuity equation and @xmath27 can be interpreted as a probability current . in this formulation ,",

    "\\label{p_fp}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the evaluation of entropy from the probability distribution , given by ( [ p_fp ] ) , yields @xmath74 note that the time derivative of the entropy is @xmath75 which decreases algebraically with time .",
    "inserting the probability distribution ( [ p_fp ] ) into ( [ pi_fp ] ) and ( [ phi_fp ] ) gives , respectively , the entropy production rate , @xmath76 the entropy flux , @xmath77 and shows that the entropy flux is independent of time as in the discrete case , and vanishes only if @xmath65 .",
