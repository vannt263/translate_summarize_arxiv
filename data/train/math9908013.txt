    "in this note we study an @xmath0-invariant matrix model with the following partition function @xmath5 where the action is @xmath6 here @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are hermitian @xmath10-matrices over the field @xmath11 , @xmath12 .",
    "we assume the summation over the repeating indices and @xmath13 is the coupling constant .",
    "the measure @xmath14 our investigations are motivated by a paper of arefeva and volovich @xcite in which the authors proved the following theorem .",
    "[ th1000 ] the set of connected feynman diagrams for the model ( [ eq003 ] ) in the limit @xmath15 and @xmath3 is in one - to - one correspondence with the set of alternating knot diagrams .",
    "the generating function for the alternating knot diagrams is given by the expression @xmath16    theorem [ th1000 ] can be regarded is an application of quantum field theory to the theory of knots .",
    "another approach has been performed by witten @xcite . there",
    "the author has considered the wilson loops in chern - simons gauge theory as knots . in general the path integrals used in quantum field theories are not mathematically well - defined . in @xcite and @xcite",
    "a rigorous mathematical meaning has been given to the path integral of the abelian chern - simons model , using the theory of fresnel integrals developed in @xcite ; and in @xcite this has been done in the frame of white noise analysis , see @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in @xcite the authors have specified the wilson loops and have proved the relation to topological invariants which has been conjectured in @xcite . in the non - abelian case a mathematically rigorous meaning to the chern - simons integral has been given in @xcite , also by using the white noise approach .",
    "the theory of knots , see @xcite and @xcite , is used in low dimensional topology and also in physics , chemistry and , biology .",
    "recently faddeev and niemi @xcite have suggested that in certain relativistic quantum field theories knot - like configurations may appear as stable solitons .",
    "the remarkable progress in the classification of knots , based on jones and vassiliev s invariants , has been related with the application of von neumann algebras , yang - baxter equations , and singularity theory , for a review see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the large @xmath17 limit is considered in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , matrix models and superstring theory , see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , the limit @xmath3 is considered in the theory of spin glasses and in polymer physics , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the statement of theorem [ th1000 ] reminds the matrix approach to superstring theory , see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , where space - time is represented as the moduli space of vacuum and strings appear in the large @xmath17 limit .",
    "see also the concluding remarks given in section [ ss4711 ] .    in order to prove theorem [ th1000 ] , in @xcite",
    "the authors have expanded the partition function @xmath18 , see ( [ eq003 ] ) , into the formal perturbation series in the coupling constant @xmath19 @xmath20 our contribution to the proof of theorem [ th1000 ] is to give a mathematically rigorous meaning to the gaussian integrals in ( [ eq004 ] ) , to prove a wick theorem for these integrals , and to derive explicit formulas for the propagators .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ s123 ]",
    "we introduce the concepts of gaussian analysis as far as necessary for the constructions in this note . in doing",
    "so we concentrate on the special case in which the underlying nuclear triple is given by matrix spaces . in order to give a mathematical rigorous meaning to the integrals in ( [ eq004 ] ) the spaces of generalized functions ( hida distributions ) we introduce in section [ ss23 ] are essential . for a detailed exposition of gaussian and white noise analysis",
    "we refer to the monographs @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . in section [ s0815 ]",
    "we realize the partition function ( [ eq003 ] ) for @xmath21 as the generalized expectation of a hida distribution @xmath4 . at",
    "first we consider the one dimensional case , i.e. , @xmath22 , and then the case of an arbitrary @xmath23 . in our first approach we obtain for different @xmath17 different spaces of hida distributions . in order to calculate the large @xmath17 limit it turns out to useful to embed all @xmath4 in a joint space of hida distributions .",
    "this embedding we derive in section [ ss626 ] . in section [ s777 ]",
    "we discuss the proof of theorem [ th1000 ] .",
    "first we shortly recall the necessary definitions and notions from the theory of knots . in section [ ss1860 ]",
    "we give a mathematically rigorous definition of the gaussian integrals in ( [ eq004 ] ) , see definition [ de1001 ] , prove a wick theorem for the generalized function @xmath4 , see theorem [ th1003 ] , and derive explicit formulas for the propagators , see theorem [ pr1000 ] .",
    "then we show how to apply the feynman diagram technique in order to find an explicit formula for the logarithm of the partition function , see ( [ eq357 ] ) .",
    "this formula enables us to determine the limit @xmath15 and @xmath3 of the normalized logarithm of the partition function and to prove theorem [ th1000 ] .",
    "finally , in section [ ss4711 ] we quote some concluding remarks on the consequences of theorem [ th1000 ] for m(atrix)-theory given in @xcite .",
    "we start by considering a gelfand triple @xmath24 here @xmath25 is a real separable hilbert space of matrices .",
    "its inner product @xmath26 we assume to be given by the trace of the matrix product of two matrices and the corresponding norm we denote by @xmath27 . the matrix space @xmath28 we assume to be a nuclear space densely topologically embedded in @xmath25 .",
    "furthermore , we assume that @xmath28 is the projective limit of a family of hilbert spaces @xmath29 parameterized by elements of an arbitrary set of indices @xmath30 such that @xmath31 is dense in all @xmath32 and that for all @xmath33 there exists @xmath34 such that @xmath35 and @xmath36 and the embeddings are of hilbert - schmidt class .",
    "let @xmath37 be the dual of @xmath38 w.r.t .  the hilbert space @xmath39 ( if it makes no sense to consider @xmath40 of @xmath41 this notation is symbolically and means that @xmath37 is the negative space corresponding to @xmath38 , see @xcite )",
    ". then @xmath42 is the inductive limit of the spaces @xmath43 .",
    "we denote by @xmath44 the dual pairings between @xmath32 and @xmath37 and between @xmath28 and @xmath45 given by the extension of the inner product @xmath26 on @xmath25 .",
    "we preserve this notation for tensor powers of these spaces .",
    "additionally , we introduce the notion of symmetric tensor power of a nuclear space .",
    "the simplest way to do this is to start from usual symmetric tensor powers @xmath46 , of hilbert spaces . using the definition @xmath47 one can prove , see e.g @xcite and @xcite , that @xmath48 is a nuclear space which is called the @xmath49-th symmetric tensor power of @xmath50 .",
    "the dual space @xmath51 can be written as @xmath52 all the results quoted above also hold for complex spaces .",
    "[ ex1 ] ( i ) let @xmath39 be the real vector space of all hermitian hilbert - schmidt operators defined on a complex separable hilbert space @xmath57 .",
    "choosing an orthonormal basis @xmath58 of @xmath57 we can identify a given operator @xmath59 with the matrix @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the inner product of @xmath62 . since the trace of the composition of two hilbert - schmidt operators is well - defined , on @xmath63 we can introduce the bilinear form @xmath64 since elements from @xmath39 are hermitian hilbert - schmidt operators the mapping ( [ eq1 ] ) is a real valued , positive definite , symmetric , bilinear form on @xmath65 .",
    "hence on @xmath39 we can define the scalar product @xmath66 now by standard methods one can verify that @xmath67 ) is a real separable hilbert space .",
    "@xmath28 we choose as the subspace of @xmath39 such that each operator @xmath68 represented as in ( [ eq2 ] ) has only finite entries .",
    "this space can be equiped with a topology such that it is a nuclear space with the properties required above , see @xcite .",
    "note that if @xmath57 is not finite dimensional then @xmath28 is not a separable nuclear space , i.e. , it can not be represented as the projective limit of a countably set of hilbert spaces .",
    "\\(ii ) in the finite dimensional case , i.e. , @xmath57 is an @xmath17 dimensional , @xmath23 , complex hilbert space , we can identify @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the real hilbert space of hermitian @xmath71-matrices over the field @xmath11 .    in order to introduce a probability measure on the vector space @xmath45 we consider the @xmath72-algebra @xmath73 generated by cylinder sets @xmath74 where @xmath75 , and @xmath76 denotes the borel @xmath72-algebra on @xmath77 .",
    "the standard gaussian measure @xmath78 on @xmath79 is given by its characteristic function @xmath80 via minlos theorem , see e.g.  @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xmath81 , @xmath82 is the basic probability space throughout this work .",
    "the central space in our setup is the space of complex valued functions which are square - integrable with respect to this measure @xmath83 consider the space @xmath84 of smooth polynomials on @xmath42 : @xmath85 it is well - known that any @xmath86 can be written as a smooth wick polynomial , i.e. , @xmath87 and that @xmath88 is dense in @xmath89 .",
    "smooth wick monomials of different order are orthogonal w.r.t .  the standard inner product in @xmath89 .",
    "furthermore , we can construct wick monomials with kernels @xmath90 in the sense of measurable functions by using an approximation .",
    "more precisely , for any sequence @xmath91 which converges to @xmath92 in @xmath93 we have that @xmath94 is a cauchy sequence in @xmath95 , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "since the @xmath96 spaces are complete the sequence @xmath97 converges and we use @xmath98 , as a formal notation for the limiting monomial . for wick monomials associated to the kernels @xmath99 and @xmath100 , @xmath101 , we have the following orthogonality property : @xmath102 ( @xmath103 is the kronecker delta ) .        for our considerations the space @xmath89 is too small",
    ". a convenient way to solve this problem is to introduce a space of test functions in @xmath89 and use its larger dual space . in gaussian analysis there exist various triples of test and generalized functions with @xmath89 as a central space , here we choose the hida triple @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the space of test functions .",
    "it is containing the space of smooth polynomials @xmath109 and is densely and topologically embedded in @xmath89 .",
    "its topologically dual @xmath110 is the space of hida distributions , see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "instead of reproducing the construction of this triple we give a complete and convenient characterization via the @xmath111-transform .",
    "consider the wick exponential @xmath112 the @xmath111-transform of @xmath113 at @xmath68 is defined as @xmath114 here @xmath115 denotes the bilinear dual pairing between @xmath108 and @xmath116 .",
    "since @xmath117 this pairing is well - defined .",
    "formally we can write the @xmath111-transform as an integral @xmath118 rigorously , this representation is valid for e.g.  square - integrable functions . furthermore , we denote by @xmath119 the ( generalized ) expectation of a hida distribution .",
    "\\(ii ) there exist constants @xmath126 and a continuous quadratic form @xmath127 on @xmath28 so that for all @xmath128 , latexmath:[\\ ] ] if one makes the assumption on the existence of nonzero condensate @xmath357 then one gets @xmath358 and one can use the described diagram technique .",
    "furthermore , in @xcite the authors speculate that theorem [ th1000 ] and its consequences indicate that perhaps a prototypical m - theory without matrix theory ( @xmath359 ) exists in the void . the eleven dimensional m - theory could be obtained from this prototypical m - theory by the decompactification of a point .      financial support of the dfg through the project str 88/6 - 1 is gratefully acknowledged .",
