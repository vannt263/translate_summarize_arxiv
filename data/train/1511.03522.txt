    "the optical and transport measurements are appropriate to detect the field - induced modification of electron energy spectrum ( [ en ] ) for experimentally reasonable parameters of the dressing field .",

    "mathematically , this means that the dependence of the magnetoelectronic properties of graphene on a dressing field is more pronounced in the case of linear polarization .",
    "thus , a linearly polarized dressing field is preferable from experimental viewpoint .    as to experimental observability of the discussed effects , it should be noted that the employed parameters of the dressing field ( the photon energy of mev scale and the field intensity of w/@xmath82 ) can be easily realized experimentally with using such conventional sources of thz radiation as quantum cascade lasers and free electron lasers ( see , e.g. , refs .",

    "therefore , the frequency of the dressing field , @xmath9 , should be far from resonant frequencies corresponding to electron transitions between different landau levels ;    \\(ii ) to exclude the scattering - induced intra - level absorption of the wave by electrons within a broadened landau level , we have to assume the wave frequency , @xmath9 , to be high enough in order to satisfy the inequality @xmath106 .",
    "it is well - known that the nonresonant ( collisional ) absorption of wave energy by conduction electrons is negligibly small under this condition .",
    "therefore , a dressing field which satisfies both the nonresonant condition ( i ) and the high - frequency condition ( ii ) can be treated as a purely dressing ( non - absorbable ) field ;    \\(iii ) the effective hamiltonian ( [ h1 ] ) is derived by reducing the infinite system of quantum dynamics ( [ a1 ] ) to the sole equation ( [ a2 ] ) .",
