    "twenty - eight transiting planets are now reported in the literature , and the doubling time scale for new detections is now roughly one year . as reviewed by @xcite",
    ", it is these objects that have allowed the study of the physical structure and atmospheric chemistry and dynamics of gas giant exoplanets , and opened the field of comparative exoplanetology .",
    "however , the majority have orbital periods of a few days , due both to the lower geometric probability of transits occurring as the orbital period increases , and due to the limitations of ground - based photometric transit surveys that strongly favor detection of short - period systems . the latter problem can be circumvented by searching for transits of known radial velocity planet - bearing stars , putting to use the radial velocity information to constrain the possible time of transit .",
    "this is the primary aim of the transitsearch.org network @xcite , which , starting in 2002 , has been conducting photometric follow - up observations of known radial velocity detected planets .",
    "this network is a prime example of successful collaboration between amateur and professional astronomers .",
    "although longer period planets possess a lower geometric probability to transit , there exists a loop - hole for some planets on highly eccentric orbits . the transit probability for a planet on an eccentric orbit , with periastron near inferior conjunction ,",
    "is amplified by a factor @xmath4\\ ] ] where @xmath5 is the eccentricity , and @xmath6 is the argument of pericenter @xcite .",
    "an amplification factor near 2.9 for the planet orbiting hd  17156 @xcite , along with an extremely short time window for possible transits , brought the system to the attention of the transitsearch.org network .",
    "this was rewarded by the detection of transits as recently announced by @xcite .",
    "this unique system contains a @xmath7-@xmath8 transiting planet in a @xmath9 day highly - eccentric orbit ( @xmath10 ) about a bright ( @xmath11 ) g0v star . @xcite",
    "have recently presented refined estimates of the system parameters based on new photometric data .",
    "even among planets with periods beyond 5 days , where the timescale for tidal circularization quickly grows to exceed the age of most systems , hd  17156b s eccentricity is unusually high , thus making it an interesting test case for models of planetary migration .",
    "preliminary measurements of the rossiter - mclaughlin effect @xcite by @xcite show evidence for a misalignment between the stellar spin axis and the planetary orbit axis , which may indicate a migration mechanism involving planet - planet scattering ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or kozai migration under perturbation by a yet undetected stellar companion or second planet @xcite .",
    "the large eccentricity and long period also make hd  17156 a particularly attractive target for several additional follow - up studies .",
    "first , it presents a unique opportunity for the study of the structure and dynamics of a gas - giant atmosphere under strongly varying illumination , through infrared monitoring of the planetary emission ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "second , by monitoring successive times of transit , the presence of additional bodies in the system can be detected or constrained from the resulting perturbations on the orbit of hd  17156b ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the purpose of our paper is three - fold : first , we seek to refine the estimates of the system parameters that were only poorly constrained by the light curves of @xcite .",
    "second , we document the time of center of transit and search for transit timing variations .",
    "third , we evaluate the likelihood that a secondary eclipse will be observable for hd  17156 , and present theoretical predictions of the infrared phase variations as might be detected with the _ spitzer space telescope_. we elected to perform an independent analysis from that of @xcite , and therefore do not use their orbital parameters as constraints , since at the time of writing these are still subject to change as their paper has not yet been accepted for publication .",
    "we do however make use of the time of mid - transit presented in their table 1 .",
    "we begin by presenting a description of our observations of the transit event on ut 2007 october 1 in  [ obs_sect ] .",
    "we then present our combined analysis of the extant radial velocity measurements (  [ rv_sect ] ) and photometric data (  [ phot_sect ] ) , and our resulting estimates of the system parameters and likelihood of a secondary eclipse . in ",
    "[ disc_sect ] , we compare our constraints on the planet mass and radius with planetary structural models , summarize the current constraints on the presence of transit timing variations in the system , and present model predictions for the planetary infrared light curve .",
    "we conclude in  [ summ_sect ] with a discussion of compelling avenues for future research .",
    "using the orbital period given by @xcite and the time of mid - transit measured by @xcite , we predicted that an event would occur on ut 2007 october 1 with transit center at ut 7:53 , which was well - situated for observatories in the southwestern united states .",
    "we present below a description of the data we gathered from three such observatories , and summarize the calibration of the raw frames and extraction of the time series for each .",
    "we observed hd  17156 with the smith 0.6  m telescope at mount laguna observatory using a bessell @xmath12 filter and an sbig stl-1001e ccd camera ( giving a scale of @xmath13/pixel at the @xmath14 cassegrain focus ) , using bd+71  168 ( @xmath15 , b8 spectral type ) as our local comparison star .",
    "the integration time for each exposure was 4  s , with a 4.3s readout time and a net cadence of 8.3  s. for each frame , we calculated the time at mid - exposure and corrected this time to heliocentric julian day .",
    "we dark - subtracted and flat - fielded the raw images in iraf , and then performed aperture photometry using a circular aperture with radius 12.8  arcsec .",
    "the use of the large aperture insulated our analysis against seeing - induced aperture losses , as the seeing varied from 2.1  arcsec to 2.7  arcsec over the course of the night .",
    "clouds were present at several times during the observations , especially after mid - transit . to avoid systematic effects due to cloud - induced differential extinction of the different color stars , we rejected observations for which the calibration star showed more than @xmath16 light loss .",
    "the resulting 2148 points were binned 20:1 and uncertainties were estimated from the rms scatter in each bin divided by @xmath17 .",
    "typical uncertainties for the binned points were @xmath18 .",
    "we observed a field centered on hd  17156 using a commercial @xmath19 m meade lx200 telescope and a meade deep sky imager pro ii ccd camera .",
    "we employed an f/3.3 focal reducer to increase the field - of - view to @xmath20 arcmin .",
    "we gathered @xmath21 exposures through an edmund optics ir - pass filter ( approximating the conventional @xmath22-band ) , between ut 4:20 and 13:25 .",
    "the integration time for each image was 2  s. weather conditions were clear .",
    "approximately @xmath23 of the frames were lost due to an intermittent issue with the ccd readout , and due to wind shake , and the guide star was lost temporarily at 6:10 ut , resulting in a large pointing shift ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "these images were processed using the software described in @xcite , which was originally developed for the monitor project @xcite .",
    "individual frames were processed by subtracting a master dark and dividing by a master flat field .",
    "we then ran the pipeline source detection software ( see @xcite ) on all of the data frames , choosing a single frame taken in good conditions for use as a reference . for each image",
    ", we derived an astrometric solution employing an implementation of the triangle matching algorithm of @xcite to cope with shifts in the telescope position ( these were @xmath25 pixels peak - to - peak , in a periodic fashion , presumably due to errors in the telescope worm drives ) , and field rotation due to polar misalignment of the mount .",
    "we generated light curves using the method described in @xcite , using the nearby star bd+71 168 as the comparison source for the differential photometry .",
    "we found that the normalized time series data gathered before and after the large image motion at ut 6:10 have an photometric offset of roughly 3% . since the data obtained before ut 6:10 were well before the ingress , we simply trimmed them from the time - series ;",
    "similarly , we trimmed the data that occurred more than 0.2 days after the transit midpoint .",
    "we also trimmed single large outliers by identifying all points that deviated from the median of the time - series by more than 8% .",
    "the typical photometric errors in the final , trimmed time - series are 2% per data point , as determined from the rms variation from the data gathered after egress .",
    "we then binned this time series by a factor of 15 ( and assumed that the errors in the binned data were reduced according to poisson statistics ) ; this binning was necessary to keep the computational time for the model fitting (  [ phot_sect ] ) to a manageable duration , but the binning did not degrade the quality of the fits .",
    "we also observed the event using a @xmath26 m meade rcx400 telescope on a custom mount , temporarily located in the car park of the las cumbres observatory global telescope ( lcogt ) offices in goleta , california .",
    "we used an sbig stl-6303e ccd camera to image a @xmath27  arcmin field with 0.6-arcsec pixels .",
    "380 useful images were taken between ut 5:30 and 11:00 , with the airmass decreasing from 1.6 to a minimum of 1.25 near ut 10:00 .",
    "no autoguiding was used , and the field drifted by @xmath28 arcsec during the run .",
    "the observations were made through the `` red '' filter from the lrgbc filter set provided with the camera by sbig , with @xmath29% transmission in the range 580680  nm .",
    "exposure times varied from 20 to 30 seconds .",
    "the readout time was 22 seconds .",
    "the telescope was defocused to avoid saturating the target star , which was the brightest in the field .",
    "the amount of defocus was increased at about ut 06:30 , shortly before the transit ingress , but this did not significantly affect the relative photometry at that point .",
    "bias and dark subtraction and flat fielding were done using standard iraf tasks .",
    "hd  17156 and ten reference stars were measured using the daophot aperture photometry package , with apertures of radius 10.6  arcsec .",
    "the light curve was divided by the average of the reference light curves to remove the effects of varying atmospheric extinction and focus changes .",
    "the standard deviation of the ( unbinned ) points outside the transit was 0.4% .",
    "the scatter of these data is lower than for the mount laguna @xmath30 m observations , despite the smaller aperture , since the larger field - of - view permits the use of multiple comparison stars . in the mount laguna data ,",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio of the final light curve was limited by that of the comparison light curve , due to the use of a comparison star fainter than the target . by using multiple comparison stars for the las cumbres data , it was possible to attain a higher signal level in the comparison light curve , such that the overall noise was dominated by the target , hence giving a net overall improvement in signal - to - noise ratio despite the use of a smaller aperture telescope .",
    "observing conditions were also somewhat worse at mount laguna , and this along with the use of defocus to render the observations insensitive to seeing variations , and to average out pixel - to - pixel flat fielding errors , also contribute to reducing the noise level in the las cumbres data .",
    "our orbital model was obtained by jointly fitting the @xcite radial velocity data ( converted to hjd ) in conjunction with the following four observed central transit times , numbered @xmath31 ( where we denote our observation on ut 2007 october 1 as event @xmath32 ) : @xmath33 @xcite , @xmath34 ( this paper ; see  [ phot_sect ] ) , @xmath35 @xcite , and @xmath36 @xcite .    for a keplerian orbit ,",
    "the instantaneous stellar radial velocity is given by @xmath37 $ ] , where @xmath38 is the true anomaly of the planet at time @xmath39 .",
    "if we assume an edge - on orbit , the time of central transit occurs when @xmath40 .",
    "given the precision of the available photometry , this approximation to @xmath41 is excellent .",
    "the true anomaly , @xmath42 , is in turn related to the the eccentric anomaly , @xmath43 , via @xmath44 , so that a central transit , @xmath45 , occurs at a fixed interval @xmath46 following the epoch of a periastron passage , @xmath47",
    ".    given @xmath48 radial velocity measurements ( here , @xmath49 ) and @xmath50 central transit measurements , the goodness - of - fit function of a particular orbital model is calculated as : @xmath51 we use a levenberg - marquardt algorithm to minimize @xmath52 .",
    "the best - fitting orbital parameters are listed in table [ tbl : params ] . to obtain the quoted uncertainties ,",
    "a simple bootstrap procedure was used .",
    "an aggregate of 1000 alternate datasets was created by ( 1 ) redrawing the radial velocities with replacement , and ( 2 ) sampling @xmath53 values for the four transits by drawing from the gaussian distributions implied by the quoted errors .",
    "fits to each of these data sets were obtained , and the resulting distributions of orbital parameters were used to derive the @xmath54 confidence intervals for each parameter . in table [ tbl : params ] , we have also given in brackets the standard deviations of these parameter distributions .",
    "the latter are larger than the former due to the existence of outliers in the bootstrap sample .",
    "these are generated because the relative importance of each radial velocity data point in constraining the derived orbital parameters depends on the orbital phase as a result of the highly eccentric orbit : the points close to periastron have the largest effect on the fit .",
    "consequently , when the bootstrapping procedure exchanges a point close to periastron , the parameters estimated from this particular realization of the procedure show sizable variations .",
    "we therefore prefer the @xmath54 confidence intervals , since these are robust to the presence of the outliers , which are in turn the result of the bootstrap procedure not being strictly applicable to data such as these which are not independent and identically - distributed .",
    "lc    @xmath55 & @xmath56 + @xmath5 & @xmath57 + @xmath58 & @xmath59 + @xmath60 & @xmath61 + @xmath62 & @xmath63 +   + @xmath53 & @xmath64 + @xmath65 & @xmath66 + @xmath67 & @xmath68 + @xmath69 & @xmath70 + @xmath71 & @xmath72 + @xmath73 & @xmath74 g @xmath75 +   + @xmath76 & @xmath77 + @xmath78 & @xmath79 + @xmath80 & @xmath81 + @xmath82 & @xmath83 + @xmath84 & @xmath85 + @xmath86 & @xmath87 + @xmath88 & @xmath89 +    we note that the addition of the transit timing data provides a very strong constraint on the orbital period , but has only a minor effect on the other orbital parameters , which are in excellent agreement with the solution given by @xcite .",
    "we pooled together the three photometric data sets to fit a model light curve parametrized by the orbital and physical properties of the hd  17156 system .",
    "our model incorporates 4 orbital parameters initially determined through the fit to the rv data : the period @xmath55 , eccentricity @xmath5 , time of periastron @xmath90 , and argument of pericenter @xmath6 .",
    "given this orbit , we calculate a baseline light curve for a quadratically limb - darkened star ( characterized by the stellar mass @xmath91 , radius @xmath71 , and 2 limb darkening coefficients for each photometric band pass ) that is being occulted by a planet ( @xmath92 ) orbiting at an inclination @xmath65 . to calculate the baseline light curve , we employ the analytic formulae of @xcite , together with the quadratic limb - darkening coefficients tabulated by @xcite , for @xmath93 = 6000  k , [ fe / h ] = @xmath94 , @xmath95 ( based on the stellar parameters given by @xcite ) .",
    "we adopted @xmath12-band coefficients for the mount laguna data , sdss @xmath96-band coefficients for the las cumbres data , and @xmath22-band coefficients for the torrance california data . in the latter two cases , the filters used for the observations only approximate @xmath96 and @xmath22 , but",
    "the approximation is more than suitable for our purposes ( in particular , the goodness - of - fit statistic described below is negligibly affected by errors in the assumed bandpass ) .",
    "the baseline flux is then modified by observational correction factors unique to each dataset ( 7 additional parameters described below ) .",
    "nominally , our model fixes @xmath55 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , 6 limb darkening coefficients , and @xmath91 , although we iteratively update the first three of these parameters as the rv fit is apprised of the transit timing resulting from the light curve fit . ultimately , the change in these three parameters from the iterative update process had negligible effect on the quality of the light curve fit and had negligible consequences for the stellar and planetary properties determined by the transit analysis .",
    "note that although @xmath62 is a fit - variable in our transit analysis , the value that is really being constrained by the photometry is the time of central transit , @xmath53 , which is related to a degenerate combination of @xmath55 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath62 .",
    "we fix @xmath91 to the value @xmath97 @xcite , which was determined by matching spectroscopic observations to stellar evolution tracks @xcite . here",
    ", the uncertainty in @xmath91 , for which the 95% confidence interval is @xmath98 , has only weak impact on the light curve fit .",
    "this is because , as described below , we adopt an external constraint on the stellar radius .",
    "our light curve model employed 11 free parameters : @xmath62 , the planet - star radius ratio @xmath99 , @xmath71 , @xmath65 , and 7 additional parameters related to observational corrections .",
    "the torrance and mount laguna fluxes were each multiplied by airmass corrections of the form @xmath100 , where @xmath42 is a normalization factor , @xmath101 is the airmass , and @xmath102 is the extinction coefficient .",
    "we note , however , that including the mount laguna airmass correction had little effect on the quality of fit ( indeed , the determined @xmath42 and @xmath102 were consistent with 1 and 0 respectively ; see table [ tbl : params ] ) .",
    "we attempted the same airmass correction for the las cumbres data , but found that a quadratic function of time significantly improved the quality of fit .",
    "we adopted a @xmath103 function as our goodness - of - fit statistic , with an additional term reflecting a spectroscopic prior on @xmath71 , which is approximately gaussian with @xmath104 ( g. takeda , personal communication ) .",
    "this additional constraint proved necessary , as our data could not independently determine the stellar radius .",
    "the goodness - of - fit function is @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the calculated flux at the time of the @xmath107 data point , @xmath108 is the @xmath107 flux measurement , and @xmath109 is the uncertainty of the @xmath107 flux measurement ( derived as described for each data - set in  [ obs_sect ] ) . using an idl implementation of the ` amoeba ` algorithm ( e.g. see @xcite ) , we performed an initial @xmath103 minimization over the space of free parameters in our model . using the results",
    ", we then rescaled the @xmath109 so that the reduced @xmath103 equals 1 separately for each dataset .",
    "we performed iterations of transit model fitting in conjunction with radial velocity fitting , using the derived transit timing to inform the radial velocity fit , which in turn updated the @xmath55 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 used for the transit fit .",
    "as mentioned above , the parameter update had negligible effect on the derived stellar and planetary properties .",
    "the data , corrected for the airmass and instrumental effects , are shown in figure  [ lc ] along with the best - fitting solution .",
    "the uncertainty in the transit time was assessed by finely stepping @xmath62 through values near its best fitting value and calculating the minimum @xmath103 at each step , allowing the other free parameters to vary .",
    "the 1-@xmath110 upper and lower limits were assessed by noting the @xmath62 values at which @xmath111 . given the other orbital parameters , we mapped each @xmath62 into the corresponding time of central transit , @xmath53 .",
    "the resulting best fitting @xmath53 and uncertainties are reported in table [ tbl : params ] . over the range of allowed @xmath62 , we found very little correlation between it and the best fitting stellar / planetary parameters .",
    "for this reason , we decided to fix @xmath62 at its best fitting value for the markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) analysis described below .",
    "note that by fixing @xmath62 , the mcmc code only needs to perform a full keplerian orbit calculation once , rather than at every step in the chain , thus dramatically speeding up the computation .    to estimate the uncertainty in the 10 remaining model parameters , we used an mcmc algorithm following the basic recipe described , for example , in @xcite , with whom we share the terminology used below .",
    "we produced 10 chains , each of @xmath112 points , starting from independent initial parameter values .",
    "the `` jump function '' was tuned so that @xmath113 of jumps were executed , and the first @xmath114 of each chain was discarded to avoid the effect of the initial condition .",
    "we combined the chains , and in table [ tbl : params ] we report the median value of each parameter , and assign uncertainties by taking the standard deviation of that parameter ( except @xmath65 , for which we report the @xmath54 confidence interval ) . in figure",
    "[ mcmc ] , we show the results of this mcmc analysis .",
    "one of the major benefits of mcmc is that probability distributions for derived quantities , such as the secondary eclipse impact parameter ( in the bottom right panel of figure  [ mcmc ] ) , are produced directly . here",
    ", the impact parameter was taken to be the minimum projected separation between planet and star center in the units of the stellar radius .",
    "the planet s mass of @xmath115 m@xmath116 @xcite is the third most massive among the known transiting planets , surpassed only by hd  147506b ( 8.6 @xmath8 ; also known as hat - p-2b ; @xcite ) and xo-3b ( 13.2 m@xmath116 ; @xcite ) .",
    "we find that the mean density of hd  17156 is @xmath117 g @xmath75 , substantially higher than other transiting extrasolar planets , again with the exception of the remarkable planet hd  147506b ( @xmath73=11.9 g @xmath75 ; @xcite ) .",
    "hd  17156b begins to bridge the gap between hd  147506b and the other transiting planets .",
    "the presence of a large rocky or metallic core has been suggested to account for `` hot jupiters '' with high densities . for hd  17156b ,",
    "the models of @xcite predict a radius of 1.11 @xmath118 given the mass of hd  17156b , which is @xmath119 larger than the radius derived from the light curve fitting , or equivalently , the measured density is higher than the models would predict .",
    "however , for such a massive planet , this discrepancy is difficult to resolve by invoking the presence of a solid core , since the dependence of planetary radius on the presence of a core is predicted to be very weak in this mass regime ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "for example , @xcite predict that the addition of a 30 @xmath120 core reduces the radius by only @xmath121 0.01 @xmath118 for a @xmath121 3 @xmath8 planet .",
    "this scenario would therefore require an extremely massive core to account for the measured radius of hd  17156b .    although a large rocky or metallic core can account for planets with high densities , the low density ( i.e. large radius ) planets such as tres-4 @xcite and wasp-1 @xcite seem to defy explanation .",
    "one possible mechanism for keeping planetary radii from shrinking during planetary evolution is to pump energy into the planet via tidal interactions ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "such orbital energy transfer mechanisms depend strongly on the orbital eccentricity , and hd  17156b represents a good test - case for these theories , having a significantly eccentric orbit ( @xmath122 )",
    ". however , the radius of hd  17156b is not in any way exceptional when compared to the existing extrasolar planets with close to circular orbits .",
    "this leads one to speculate that tidal energy transfer via orbital dynamics may not play a substantial role in planetary radius evolution , or that in massive planets such as hd  17156b a mechanism is acting to allow the planets to more rapidly evolve to smaller radii .",
    "we note , however , that the recently - announced massive planet xo-3b @xcite also has an eccentric orbit , but in contrast to hd  17156b , its radius is very large ( @xmath123 ) .",
    "thus the challenges posed by newly - discovered exoplanets to theoretical models of their physical structure seem to continue unabated .",
    "the availability of multiple measured times - of - transit allows the presence of additional bodies in the hd  17156 system to be detected or constrained , by searching for the influence of their gravitational perturbations on the orbit of hd  17156b ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .    in figure",
    "[ oc ] , we plot the observed minus calculated times of center of transit for the 4 events reported in the literature , including the event described in this paper .",
    "we find that these results do not yet reveal any evidence for timing variations that would indicate the presence of a third body in the system . due to the long orbital period , hd  17156",
    "may be more amenable to a search for such variations .",
    "however , the large orbital eccentricity implies a large region for which dynamical stability considerations would exclude the presence of such planets .",
    "our photometric analysis directly addresses the probability that hd  17156b undergoes secondary eclipse , which is only possible for certain combinations of @xmath71 and @xmath65 .",
    "we find a 9.2% chance for secondary eclipses to occur , but only a 6.9 % chance for non - grazing eclipses .",
    "if , indeed , hd  17156b undergoes eclipses , @xmath65 becomes locked rather tightly , thus greatly diminishing the allowed volume of parameter space for the stellar and planetary properties . under this constraint , we find that the new best fitting values for ( @xmath65,@xmath71,@xmath124 ) are ( @xmath125 , @xmath126 , @xmath127 ) .",
    "these considerations serve to motivate a search for the secondary eclipses .",
    "hd  17156b s large eccentricity leads to a 25-fold variation in received stellar flux over the course of the @xmath128 orbital period .",
    "this dramatic variation in illumination should produce complex weather at the planet s photosphere .",
    "in addition , the planet is subject to strong tidal forces during its periastron passage .",
    "the planet is therefore expected to be in pseudo - synchronous rotation , in which the planetary spin will be roughly synchronous with the orbit during the interval surrounding close approach .",
    "the theory of hut ( 1981 ) predicts a pseudo - synchronous spin period , @xmath129 given by @xmath130 knowledge of @xmath131 , @xmath132 , @xmath133 , and the time - dependent pattern of received stellar flux make it possible to compute global climate models for the planet ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . these models , in turn ,",
    "can be used to obtain predictions of the planet s infrared photometric light curve at various wavelengths .",
    "model light curves can then be compared with observations using the _ spitzer space telescope _ ( see , e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we adopt the climate model of @xcite and apply it to hd  17156b , using the known orbital and physical properties of the planet .",
    "the model uses a compressible 2d hydrodynamical solver @xcite with a one - layer , two - frequency radiative transfer scheme .",
    "it is important to emphasize that our hydrodynamical model ( like those of other workers in the field ) is undergoing rapid development .",
    "indeed , a primary goal for obtaining physical observations of planets under time - varying irradiation conditions is to provide physical guidance to the numerical codes .",
    "our model predictions are shown in figure  [ ir ] , which , for reference , includes a model of the planet , the orbit , and the star plotted to scale ( top left ) .",
    "the hydrodynamical model assumes a solar - composition h  he atmosphere for the planet , and is run for several orbits to achieve equilibrium , at which point we track the predicted @xmath134 m light curve for a full orbital period starting at apastron , by assuming a black body spectrum for each surface element in the model , and integrating the resulting @xmath134 m flux over the visible hemisphere of the planet .",
    "the right column of figure  [ ir ] shows a series of five global temperature plots , each corresponding to the thermal appearance of the planet from the earth .",
    "the figures are equally spaced in time by one - quarter of an orbit ( 127.3 hours ) .",
    "the predicted 8@xmath135 m flux from the planet is shown in the lower - left corner of the figure , and features a rapid rise from a baseline of @xmath136 to @xmath137 during the @xmath138 hour interval following periastron .",
    "the magnitude of this rise is comparable with ( but slightly less than ) that expected for hat - p-2b and hd  80606b ( langton & laughlin 2007 ) .",
    "hd  17156 thus represents a highly interesting system for follow - up studies in the mid infra - red ( e.g. using the _ spitzer space telescope _ ) , even if it does not undergo secondary eclipses .",
    "ground - based observations should also be pursued to continue the search for transit timing variations , and hence to constrain the presence of additional bodies in the system , which , given the high orbital eccentricity of the planet hd  17156b , may show interesting dynamical properties and place constraints on planetary formation and evolution scenarios .",
    "this discovery represents an important success for the transitsearch.org project , and highlights the potential rewards of collaboration between distributed networks of amateur astronomers and the professional community .",
    "we thank mauro barbieri and the transit discovery team for alerting us to the october transit opportunity , and genya takeda for discussions regarding the spectroscopic determination of stellar properties .",

    "<S> we report high - cadence time - series photometry of the recently - discovered transiting exoplanet system hd  17156 , spanning the time of transit on ut 2007 october 1 , from three separate observatories . </S>",
    "<S> we present a joint analysis of our photometry , previously published radial velocity measurements , and times of transit center for 3 additional events . adopting the spectroscopically - determined values and uncertainties for the stellar mass and radius </S>",
    "<S> , we estimate a planet radius of @xmath0 and an inclination of @xmath1  degrees . </S>",
    "<S> we find a time of transit center of @xmath2  hjd and an orbital period of @xmath3  days , and note that the 4 transits reported to date show no sign of timing variations that would indicate the presence of a third body in the system . </S>",
    "<S> our results do not preclude the existence of a secondary eclipse , but imply there is only a 9.2% chance for this to be present , and an even lower probability ( 6.9% ) that the secondary eclipse would be a non - grazing event . </S>",
    "<S> due to its eccentric orbit and long period , hd  17156b is a fascinating object for the study of the dynamics of exoplanet atmospheres . to aid such future studies , we present theoretical light curves for the variable infrared emission from the visible hemisphere of the planet throughout its orbit . </S>"
