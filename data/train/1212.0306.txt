    "it is common knowledge that the models with non - hermitian operators have very restricted area of applicability . in",
    "[ 3 - 5 ] this problem has been studied by the example of @xmath7 transitions in a medium [ 6 - 14 ] followed by annihilation @xmath8 where @xmath9 are the annihilation mesons .",
    "the reason is that for the process ( 2 ) the absorption in the final state ( annihilation ) is extremely strong .",
    "this is simplest 2-step process involving intermediate - state interaction and absorption in the final state since the @xmath7 transition vertex corresponds to 2-tail diagram .",
    "it was shown [ 3 - 5 ] that one - particle model mentioned above does not describe the process ( 2 ) as well as the total @xmath7 transition probability , because unitarity condition ( optical theorem ) is used for the essentially non - unitary @xmath10-matrix .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian contains the antineutron optical potential @xmath11 and @xmath12 plays a crucial role .",
    "the @xmath10-matrix should be _",

    "the qualitative picture of the process ( 2 ) is as follows .",
    "the free - space @xmath7 transition comes from the exchange of higgs bosons with the mass @xmath19 gev [ 7 ] and so the subprocess of @xmath7 conversion is scarcely affected by a medium effects . from the dynamical point of view this is a momentary process : @xmath20 s. the antineutron annihilates in a time @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the annihilation width of @xmath23 in the medium .",

    "let @xmath75 and @xmath76 are the lower limit on the free - space @xmath7 oscillation time calculated by means of model * b * and the experimental bound on the neutron lifetime in a nucleus [ 13 ] , respectively . from the condition @xmath77 we have @xmath78 . for estimation",
    "we take @xmath79 mev and @xmath80 mev . using the value @xmath81 yr obtained by super - kamiokande collaboration [ 13 ] ,",
    "one obtains @xmath82 this value exceeds the restriction given by the grenoble reactor experiment [ 8 ] by a factor of 14 and the lower limit given by potential model [ 9 - 13 ] by a factor of 5 .    at the point @xmath13 eqs .",
    "( 19 ) and ( 20 ) are inapplicable . in this connection we return to the model * a*. the amplitude ( 7 ) diverges @xmath83 @xmath51 .",
    "these are infrared singularities conditioned by zero momentum transfer in the @xmath7 transition vertex .",
    "( in the model * b * the effective momentum transfer @xmath84 takes place . ) for solving the problem the field - theoretical approach with finite time interval [ 14 ] is used .",
    "it is infrared free . in the case of potential model ,",
    "the approach with finite time interval reproduces all the results on the particle oscillations obtained by means of potential model ( see sect .",
    "5.2 of ref .",
    "this is the test of above - mentioned approach .",
    "however , our purpose is to describe the process ( 2 ) by means of hermitian hamiltonian because the potential model does not describe the absorption .    for the model *",
    "a * the process ( 1 ) probability was found to be [ 4,5 ] @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the free - space @xmath7 transition probability . owing to annihilation channel , @xmath87 is practically equal to the free - space @xmath7 transition probability . if @xmath88 , eq .",
    "( 23 ) diverges just as the modulus ( 22 ) squared does .",
    "if @xmath65 , eq .",
    "( 18 ) diverges quadratically as well .",
    "equation ( 23 ) does not contain density - dependence ( @xmath89dependence ) since it corresponds to the limiting case @xmath90 which is realized for the @xmath7 transition in nuclei [ 4,5 ] .",
    "the explanation of the @xmath91-dependence is simple .",
    "the process shown in fig .",
    "1a represents two consecutive subprocesses .",
    "the speed and probability of the whole process are defined by those of the slower subprocess . if @xmath92 , the annihilation can be considered instantaneous .",
    "so , the probability of process ( 2 ) is defined by the speed of the @xmath7 transition : @xmath93 .    distribution ( 23 ) leads to very strong restriction on the free - space @xmath7 oscillation time : @xmath94 here @xmath95 is the lower limit on the free - space @xmath7 oscillation time calculated by means of model * a*.    for the process ( 1 ) instead of ( 19 ) we have @xmath96 here @xmath97 is the free - space @xmath0 oscillation time , @xmath98 is the @xmath2-particle self - energy , @xmath66 is the absorption ( decay ) width of @xmath2-particle in the case of absorption ( decay ) .",
    "in this paper we do nt touch the application of above - considered approach to the specific experiments on oscillations of ultra cold neutrons in storage vessels [ 17 ] and neutron disapearance into another braneworld [ 18 ] .",
    "also we do nt consider the calculations based on the diagram technique for direct reactions [ 19,20 ] since they are inapplicable to the problem under study [ 21 ] .",
    "( for example , the result @xmath99 [ 19,20 ] ( @xmath100 is the neutron binding energy ) diverges when @xmath101 . )",
    "our goal is to study the role of intermediate state interaction .    as is seen from eqs .",
    "( 19 ) and ( 25 ) , the self - energy plays the same part as the energy gap @xmath102 in the potential model : it tends to suppress the processes ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) . if @xmath65 , @xmath74 rises quadratically .",
    "so @xmath75 and @xmath95 can be considered as the estimations from below and above , respectively . in both models",
    "the antineutron propagators do nt contain the annihilation loops since the annihilation is taken into account in the amplitudes @xmath44 and @xmath62 ; the interaction hamiltonians @xmath103 and unperturbed hamiltonians are the same . the sole physical distinction between models * a * and",
    "* b * is the non - zero antineutron self - energy in the model * b * which is conditioned by intermediate state interaction .",
    "however , it leads to the fundamentally different results ( see ( 21 ) and ( 24 ) ) .",
    "there is no rigorous recipes for calculation of @xmath14 .",
    "one can adduce a great deal of arguments in support of the value @xmath13 [ 4 , 22 ] .",
    "in particular , in contrast to the model * b * , the model * a * describes the following limiting cases [ 22 ] :    \\a ) in the low - density approximation the model * a * reproduces the branching ratio of channels of free - space @xmath104 interaction : @xmath105 here @xmath106 and @xmath107 are the cross section of free - space @xmath104 annihilation and total cross section of free - space @xmath104 interaction , respectively ; @xmath108 and @xmath109 are the width of process ( 2 ) and total width of @xmath7 transition in a medium .",
    "( @xmath109 includes the channels with antineutron and annihilation mesons in the final state . )",
    "\\b ) the model * a * describes the process ( 2 ) on a free nucleon : @xmath110 however , the small change of antineutron self - energy @xmath111 , or , similarly , effctive momentum transfer in the @xmath7 transition vertex converts the model * a * to the model * b * : @xmath112 with @xmath113 .",
    "this is because the process amplitude is in the peculiar point ( see ( 7 ) and ( 8) ) owing to zero momentum transfer .",
    "if @xmath14 changes in the limits @xmath114 , the lower limit on the free - space @xmath7 oscillation time is in the range @xmath115 .    finally , the problem is extremely sensitive to the @xmath14 .",
    "this conclusion is also true for the process ( 1 ) since for this processes the @xmath14-dependence of the result is the same ( see ( 25 ) ) .",
    "further investigations are desirable .",
