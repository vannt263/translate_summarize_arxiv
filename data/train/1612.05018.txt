    "the essential difference leads to that the mode analysis for the sub - diffusion does not produce the super - diffusion , and vice versa .    in the context of polymer dynamics ,",
    "we have pointed out that the way to observe the tagged monomer dynamics has duality .",
    "looking at the force correlation and the super - diffusive behavior of the momentum transfer would be useful to analyze the fluctuating dynamics of a polymer driven by a constant velocity .",
    "another avenue of the research can be found beyond the msd analysis .",

    "@xcite , the first passage statistics of sub - diffusion @xmath0 process generated by the superposition of @xmath60 has been investigated .",
