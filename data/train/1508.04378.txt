    "heavy ion collision experiments at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at center of mass energy @xmath4  gev per nucleon pair at brookhaven and at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at geneva at @xmath5  tev have provided evidence of the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) existence and proven that it behaves almost like a perfect fluid @xcite .",
    "models based on ideal hydrodynamics , which requires local thermalization , are very successful in describing the experimental data from rhic and lhc .",
    "it was argued that the good description of experimental data requires rather small initialization times ( @xmath6 fm / c at rhic ) @xcite .",
    "this raised the question about how fast and due to which physical mechanisms the qgp can be thermalized .",
    "in contrast to this requirement of early thermalization , in the newer works applying viscous hydrodynamics it is claimed that ",
    "experimental data for bulk quantities can be reproduced by hydrodynamic models also for large initialization times , so no early thermalization assumption is needed ",
    "still , the necessary condition for applying hydrodynamics is the vicinity to the thermal equilibrium .",
    "the recently developed anisotropic hydrodynamics @xcite is partially an exception : it can be applied for arbitrarily high pressure anisotropy , but not for arbitrarily high off - diagonal components of the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "unlike ideal or viscous hydrodynamics , anisotropic hydrodynamics is not yet a well - established ansatz , for a discussion see @xcite .",
    "the question about the degree of non - equilibrium at the time of hydrodynamics initialization can not be answered by hydrodynamics itself .",
    "the approach to equilibrium in heavy ion collisions is actively studied microscopically within two types of models , an overview of both being given in @xcite .",
    "the first ones apply dualities of supersymmetric yang - mills gauge theory for calculations in the strong coupling limit @xcite .",
    "other approaches are able to achieve fast thermalization in a weak coupling limit , where colliding nuclei are described in the color - glass condensate ( cgc ) framework @xcite .",
    "the primary effect in cgc leading to fast thermalization is believed to be plasma instabilities , such as the chromo - weibel instability@xcite . both kinds of models predict considerable momentum space anisotropies at the times , when hydrodynamics is initialized .",
    "the aforementioned studies are relevant for high collision energies . at intermediate energies thermalization",
    "was studied using transport models @xcite , where momentum distributions were averaged over a ( @xmath7 ) @xmath8 central cell .",
    "in contrast to the work @xcite , in this paper we study thermalization and isotropization at intermediate energies locally in space , paying attention not only to pressure anisotropy , but also to off - diagonal components of the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "our study is particularly relevant for hydrodynamics+transport hybrid models that construct initial state from transport approaches @xcite .    in such models",
    "the initial energy - momentum tensor @xmath0 and the four - current @xmath1 are obtained from particles , a procedure we further refer to as _ fluidization_. afterwards they can be unambiguously decomposed into @xmath9 and @xmath10 , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the energy - momentum tensor and the four - current of conserved charges of an ideal fluid . for a fully consistent fluidization",
    "a set of conditions is required .",
    "first , the hydrodynamics should be applicable , therefore the system has to be close to equilibrium .",
    "@xmath13 where @xmath14 is a microscopic scale related to particle collisions , e.g. mean free path , and @xmath15 is a macroscopic scale , e.g. the system size .",
    "second , hydrodynamics and transport have to be matched : energy - momentum tensor , currents and their time derivatives should be the same for transport and hydrodynamics at fluidization . matching time derivatives",
    "means that the transport properties ( viscosities , thermal conductivity , relaxation time , etc ) , chemical rates and the equation of state ( eos ) should be the same on both sides : @xmath16    let us call this set of conditions ( [ eqi]-[eqvi ] ) _ strong consistency _ conditions .",
    "these conditions guarantee that for a small time after fluidization results of the hydrodynamic calculation are equivalent to the results of the transport model .",
    "hydrodynamics in this case is just another language for the description of the same phenomena , which may have some technical advantages .",
    "this is the case for the applications of non - relativistic hydrodynamics ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) : for boundary layers and dilute regions , where hydrodynamics is not applicable , a transport model is used , otherwise hydrodynamics is applied , because it is computationally cheaper .",
    "in such models simulating the whole system with transport and comparing to the hybrid model is just a consistency check - both approaches should give identical results .",
    "strong consistency conditions are a necessary and sufficient condition for that .",
    "the purpose of applying hydrodynamics in the heavy ion collisions simulations is completely different from the non - relativistic applications , where the hydrodynamics is just a matter of the simulation speed - up . in heavy ion collisions switching to hydrodynamics allows to investigate the effects of thermalization , equation of state and transport properties of the hot and dense hadronic or qgp matter .",
    "this implies instantaneous thermalization , rapid change of eos and transport properties at fluidization .",
    "therefore , conditions ( [ eqiii ] ) and ( [ eqvi ] ) are not required , but conservation laws represented by equations ( [ eqiv]-[eqv ] ) should be fulfilled and conditions ( [ eqi]-[eqii ] ) remain as a practical requirement to solve the hydrodynamic equations numerically .",
    "we further call conditions ( [ eqi]-[eqii],[eqiv]-[eqv ] ) the _ weak consistency _ conditions .",
    "the fluidization is typically performed either at a constant proper time hypersurface @xmath17 or at a constant center of mass frame time hypersurface @xmath18 . the constant is often chosen according to the _ geometrical criterion _ - the time , when nuclei geometrically pass through each other : @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is radius of the nucleus , @xmath21 is velocity , @xmath22 , @xmath23 is laboratory frame kinetic energy per nucleon , and @xmath24 is nucleon mass .",
    "this time is taken to be the same for all collision centralities .",
    "it was never systematically verified , if consistency ( strong or weak ) is fulfilled at fluidization .    in this contribution",
    "we want to close this gap and answer the following questions :    * which conditions of weak consistency are fulfilled at the time of geometrical overlap ? * what is a better fluidization criterion ?",
    "should it depend on centrality ?",
    "* how can one perform fluidization consistently in the weak sense ?    to answer these questions we analyse the outcome of a hadron cascade and determine , where and when conditions ( [ eqi]-[eqii ] ) are fulfilled .",
    "the article is organized as follows . to set the stage , the way fluidization",
    "is performed in different models is discussed in section [ sec_ii ] . in section [ sec_iii ]",
    "we derive the expressions to quantify deviations of @xmath0 and @xmath1 from the ideal fluid .",
    "the methodology of our work is described in section [ sec : methodology ] .",
    "results for quantifying the deviations are split into two sections : in section [ sec_v ] we consider effects of nuisance parameters : statistics , smearing and grid spacing , while in section [ sec : results ] we highlight the dependence on collision energy and centrality . our criticism to the smearing procedure in the fluidization of the existing models and a suggestion for its improvement are given in the appendix .",
    "let us start by summarizing the current approaches that are employed in hybrid models ( see table [ tab : models ] ) .",
    "all the shown approaches need to obtain the ideal fluid part of @xmath0 and @xmath1 from discrete degrees of freedom ( hadrons , partons , strings ) .",
    "the viscous corrections are neglected in all models , even if viscous hydrodynamics is applied for the evolution .",
    "the only exception is a recent work by liu et al .",
    "@xcite , where the initial stage for viscous hydrodynamics is constructed from free streaming partons and viscous corrections are explicitly included .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor @xmath0 and four - currents @xmath1 are constructed as @xmath25    here @xmath26 is a smearing kernel , which is often taken as a gaussian in various coordinates . in the appendix",
    "we argue , that @xmath27 should be lorentz scalar , show that none of the models fully meets this requirement , and derive a simple smearing kernel , which can be employed instead .",
    "note that changing to this lorentz - invariant kernel leaves the final results rather unaffected .",
    "there are two ways in the literature to match the obtained @xmath0 and @xmath1 to ideal hydrodynamics .",
    "the first one is to use only @xmath28 , @xmath29 , assuming that they have ideal fluid form @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and adding the equation of state ( eos ) @xmath32 .",
    "the following system of equations is then solved ( usually iteratively , for details see @xcite ) : @xmath33    the advantage of this method is that it conserves energy and momentum .",
    "however , this method supports switching only to ideal fluid @xmath11 , keeping viscous corrections is hardly possible . even though the switching method conserves energy and momentum , one of the models , which employs it , violates conservation laws @xcite , because in @xcite the whole @xmath0",
    "is multiplied by a free parameter @xmath26 , which is then fixed by experimental multiplicities .",
    "another way is to determine the energy density @xmath34 and the collective velocity @xmath35 by solving the eigenvalue problem @xmath36 using the fact that @xmath35 is a timelike eigenvector of @xmath0 and satisfies @xmath37 .",
    "then the density @xmath38 is computed as @xmath39 . only after that the pressure is determined from eos .",
    "note that this way is not equivalent to the previous one : here the collective velocity does not depend on the equation of state .",
    "this method conserves energy and momentum only if the viscous corrections are kept . if they are neglected ( as in @xcite )",
    "then conservation laws are violated . for a simple example",
    "assume that @xmath40 . in this case , the energy density in the computational frame is @xmath41 , where @xmath42 can be split into the ideal fluid pressure and a viscous correction . if the correction is neglected , energy conservation is violated .",
    "the switching criteria are rather similar in most of the approaches : either constant proper time @xmath43 or constant time in the center of mass frame @xmath44 , the value being determined by the geometrical criterion .",
    "it provides the earliest time , when equilibration could be in principle possible . in @xcite",
    "the fluidization time @xmath45 has a better physical motivation : @xmath45 is chosen such that the entropy per baryon does not change any more at @xmath46 .    [",

    "let us rewrite the conditions of weak consistency with hydrodynamics for @xmath0 and @xmath1 in a way convenient for numerical computation .",
    "general expressions for @xmath0 and @xmath1 in viscous hydrodynamics ( landau picture ) are the following : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the bulk pressure , @xmath49 is the shear stress tensor , @xmath50 is the conserved quantum number density and @xmath51 is the diffusion current .",
    "viscous corrections to ideal hydrodynamical @xmath0 and @xmath1 are supposed to be small : @xmath52 one can see that in the landau rest frame @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 .",
    "the non - zero components are written as follows : @xmath56 let us note that tensor and vector norms are frame - independent , so the consistency conditions for viscous hydrodynamics can be formulated in any frame . in eqn .",
    "( [ pi_mn_visc_applic ] ) one can substitute @xmath57 by its largest component in the landau frame : @xmath58 . then",
    "( [ pi_mn_visc_applic ] ) will turn into @xmath59 denotes @xmath60 .",
    "the physical meaning of this equation is that the diagonal components of @xmath0 in the landau rest frame do not deviate much from @xmath61 and simultaneously off - diagonal components are small compared to @xmath58 .",
    "the condition for @xmath51 is rewritten as @xmath62 here the physical meaning is that relative velocity between landau and eckart frames should be small . to rewrite @xmath63 one",
    "has to add an equation of state @xmath64 to the system .",
    "then one obtains @xmath65 .",
    "consequently , whether the tensor @xmath0 is suitable for fluid dynamics or not is also defined by the equation of state from the fluid dynamics itself .",
    "the same @xmath0 can be consistent with viscous hydrodynamics with some equation of state , and may fail when the equation of state is changed .",
    "therefore , we will not study the smallness of bulk corrections further , but leave this for a future study .",
    "the conditions for smallness of the shear stress tensor can be split into two : pressure isotropy and smallness of off - diagonal elements .",
    "one has to note that the landau frame is defined only up to an arbitrary rotation .",
    "locally one can always choose such coordinates that @xmath66 .",
    "however , our coordinates are the global coordinates of the computational frame and therefore non - diagonal components of the @xmath67 are in general non - zero .",
    "therefore ,    @xmath68 and @xmath58 is substituted by by @xmath61 . in this way",
    "a set of criteria is obtained that we use for numerical calculations .",
    "@xmath69    in the following @xmath70 is referred to as pressure anisotropy and @xmath71 as off - diagonality .",
    "please note that due to the inequality @xmath72 it is always fulfilled that @xmath73 . for ideal fluid dynamics @xmath74 . for @xmath71",
    "let us remark that @xmath75 interchanging indices and substituting this into the definition of @xmath71 one gets @xmath76 .",
    "for an ideal fluid @xmath77 .",
    "our calculation is based on the hadronic transport approach - ultrarelativistic quantum molecular dynamics ( urqmd 3.4 ) @xcite .",
    "the degrees of freedom in urqmd are hadrons , resonances up to a mass of 2.2 gev and strings and the implemented processes include binary elastic and inelastic scatterings which mainly proceed via resonance formation and decays or string excitation and fragmentation at higher collision energies .",
    "the urqmd particles move along classical trajectories and scatter according to their free - particle cross - sections . in our studies",
    "there are no long range potentials and particle trajectories between collisions are always straight lines . using urqmd",
    "we simulate au + au collisions at laboratory frame energies @xmath78 5 , 10 , 20 , 40 , 80 and 160@xmath79 gev .",
    "the general procedure for our calculations is :    1 .",
    "generate many urqmd events and coarse - grain them using a 2 + 1d space - time grid .",
    "the space dimensions are chosen to be the event plane xz .",
    "we choose a 2 + 1d grid and not 3 + 1d , because observing the behaviour of some quantity on 2d surface versus time is much easier and informative for a human than observing quantity on a 3d grid .",
    "additionally , in central collisions due to symmetry the event plane completely characterises all the volume .",
    "the center of mass frame is used as the computational frame in the simulation . in all the following text the time is measured in the center of mass frame . by the urqmd convention @xmath80 is the moment when the contracted spheres of the nuclear radius first touch each other in a central collision .",
    "use particles from the generated events to construct the energy - momentum tensor @xmath81 locally for each grid cell . to compute @xmath0",
    "we take only participants into account , i.e. the particles that took part in at least one collision . to construct @xmath0 gaussian smearing",
    "is employed , for details see appendix .",
    "we argue that the construction of @xmath0 in the existing models is not a lorentz - invariant procedure due to the smearing kernels .",
    "a simple kernel is suggested , which satisfies the necessary lorentz - transformation requirements .",
    "however , the introduction of the new kernel appeared to be only a matter of physical rigour : switching standard kernel to our kernel did not produce noticeable changes in the results .",
    "3 .   transform the constructed energy - momentum tensor in each grid cell to the landau rest frame .",
    "verify the weak consistency conditions ( see eqn .",
    "[ cond_to_check ] ) locally in time and space .",
    "we check conditions for smallness of pressure anisotropy , off - diagonality , eckart velocity relative to landau , but the condition for smallness of bulk pressure compared to pressure is left for future studies .    in this procedure",
    "we follow exactly the fluidization in hybrid models , the only addition is that the weak consistency checks are performed .",
    "the deviations of @xmath0 in the simulation from the ideal fluid @xmath11 can have two distinct reasons .",
    "the first one is the deviation of the distribution function @xmath82 in the transport approach from equilibrium , this reason is referred to as physical .",
    "the second reason is statistical : due to finite number of particles in the simulation , the distribution function is not sampled exactly .",
    "let us consider two energy - momentum tensors : calculated from particles @xmath83 and a  true ",
    "@xmath0 : @xmath84 here @xmath85 is the number of events and @xmath86 is a smearing kernel . in the limit of @xmath87 @xmath88 for the case of a gaussian kernel for @xmath89 , the kernel @xmath90 and one retains the  true  @xmath0 . to combine these two limits",
    "( @xmath89 , @xmath87 ) one has to keep enough particles within a volume of size @xmath91 .",
    "consequently , to obtain the  true ",
    "@xmath0 in the simulation , one has to take the limit ( @xmath92 is density ) @xmath93 this creates practical limitations for finding the  true  @xmath0 in simulations : decreasing @xmath3 10 times demands increasing the statistics 1000 times !",
    "one can also see that regions with lower density are more demanding with respect to statistics .",
    "to get some insights into the effect of statistics , we performed an auxiliary simulation : @xmath94 pions are generated , their momenta being sampled from a thermal distribution with an ad - hoc temperature of @xmath95 gev , then @xmath96 is computed , pressure isotropy @xmath70 and off - diagonality @xmath71 of the energy - momentum tensor from eq .",
    "[ cond_to_check ] are calculated .",
    "we varied number of pions @xmath94 and plotted @xmath70 and @xmath71 versus @xmath94 .",
    "the results can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : pure_stat_effect ] . for every point",
    "the simulation was repeated 100 times and the standard deviation is displayed as an error .",
    "[ fig : pure_stat_effect ] can be used to specify the number of events needed to reach a good enough approximation to the  true  @xmath0 .",
    "for example , for @xmath97 as an acceptable level , the condition of eqn .",
    "[ eq : true_tmn_condition ] becomes @xmath98 . from fig .",
    "[ fig : pure_stat_effect ] one can also see that the off - diagonality @xmath71 is more sensitive to statistics than the pressure isotropy @xmath70 .    in the previous paragraph we considered the effect of statistics itself rather as an obstacle to get the physical  true",
    " @xmath0 . however , recently event - by - event simulations gained popularity , where the initial state for hydrodynamics is intentionally constructed from a small number of events to include the fluctuations .",
    "let us see , how the number of events influences deviations of @xmath0 from the ideal form in heavy ion collisions .",
    "we compute @xmath0 locally on every point of the grid , and as a general characteristic we choose the percentage of the event - plane area , where @xmath99 ( @xmath100 ) . to define the total area numerically , only grid cells , where pressure @xmath101 gev/@xmath8 are taken into account .",
    "for this example au+au collisions at @xmath102 gev with the impact parameter @xmath103 fm are considered .",
    "the smearing @xmath3 is 0.8 fm .",
    "results are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : sensitivity_nev ] .",
    "one can see that for this given @xmath3 1000 events are enough for @xmath70 to saturate , so the line for @xmath104 represents results for the physical pressure isotropy , i.e. due to deviation of @xmath82 in the transport from equilibrium . for @xmath71 at @xmath105 almost all the event area has small off - diagonality , which means that the physical off - diagonality is small . for event - by - event simulations deviations of @xmath0 from ideal fluid",
    "are dominated by statistical effects .",
    "in addition to the effect of statistics we investigate the effect of other nuisance parameters , i.e. the grid spacing and the gaussian smearing , on our results . according to fig .",
    "[ fig : sensitivity_sigma_dx ] , the grid spacing does not influence the results if taken sufficiently small .",
    "this is expected , because the grid does not participate in the simulation or in the calculation of @xmath0 , it only determines the resolution of the @xmath0 output .",
    "the only effect of grid spacing is on the precision of the area calculation by counting cells , here resolution of the output matters . at early times",
    ", it makes some difference , because the total area is small .",
    "that is why further we take @xmath106 fm . at the same time",
    "the gaussian @xmath3 influences the results very significantly , as it can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : sensitivity_sigma_dx ] .",
    "the effect of gaussian @xmath3 is twofold : on the one hand larger @xmath3 means effective increase of statistics . on the other hand , if the pressure anisotropy is large at some space point due to physics , the gaussian smearing will spread this asymmetry in a 1 - 2 @xmath3 radius .     +    to characterize the influence of @xmath3 in a simpler way , we plot @xmath107 versus @xmath3 , where @xmath107 is the earliest time when at least 50% of the area have @xmath99 .",
    "we refer to this time as _ isotropization time _ as it is further described in the following section . in fig .",
    "[ fig : t_iso_sensitivity_sigma ] this dependence is displayed , the isotropization time is monotonously growing with @xmath3 and is approaching to the geometrical time for  @xmath89 . taking the limit @xmath89 is computationally challenging , because one has to increase statistics as @xmath108 , as we have shown previously .",
    "instead we choose a reasonable @xmath109 fm and assign systematic errors to our results , corresponding to changing @xmath3 in the range @xmath110 fm .",
    "another justification for such a treatment is that none of the existing models attempts to consider the  physical  limit of @xmath111 , all the models use some fixed sigma instead .",
    "while in the previous section we studied the effects of nuisance parameters on the energy - momentum tensor generated from particles , here we consider the dependence on physical parameters : collision energy and centrality .",
    "all the following figures are shown for grid spacing @xmath106 fm , gaussian smearing @xmath109 fm , and number of events @xmath104 .",
    "+   +     +     +    * the pressure anisotropy * @xmath70 satisfies the following properties : @xmath73 for any tensor and @xmath74 if and only if @xmath112 as it is for ideal fluid @xmath0 . for viscous hydrodynamics",
    "it is necessary that @xmath113 .",
    "we consider @xmath114 as a limiting value , when viscous hydrodynamics is still applicable .",
    "changing @xmath115 to 0.4 leaves us with qualitatively the same results and conclusions .",
    "[ fig : x_paraview_space_time_evolution ] gives a qualitative impression of the space - time evolution of the pressure anisotropy .",
    "even though the figure shows a particular energy of @xmath116 gev and centrality @xmath103 fm , some features are universal for all energies and centralities that we considered :    * on the borders of the expanding system the anisotropy is always high , thus these regions are never consistent with viscous hydrodynamics . * after some moment of time a relatively isotropized central region rapidly expands and never disappears completely during the time evolution    to make quantitative statements let us consider the evolution of the pressure anisotropy at several points along the x axis ( z = 0 ) versus time .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : x_vs_t_few_space_points ] .",
    "one can see that in the beginning the anisotropy is almost maximal , then it rapidly decreases and never rises too much again .",

    "[ fig : x_vs_t_few_space_points ] is dominated by physics .",
    "however , the impact of statistical fluctuations can be observed already at @xmath117 fm / c : @xmath70 starts to fluctuate in space and time .",

    "it is interesting to note that the isotropization time differs with centrality : for larger impact parameters @xmath120 it slightly increases .",
    "one might assume that this has a pure geometrical reason : @xmath121 is chosen in urqmd as a moment when nuclei touch each other in a central collision .",
    "however , for peripheral collisions the nuclei will only touch at @xmath122 . in fig .  [",
    "fig : t_x_b ] one can see that this naive expectation yields the right trend : @xmath107 rises with centrality and the rise is smaller for higher energies .",
    "however , quantitatively it overestimates @xmath107 for large impact parameters .",
    "let us compare our findings to the study by bravina et al .",
    "@xcite , where one central cell of @xmath123 @xmath8 was chosen to study the pressure anisotropy of the energy - momentum tensor in au+au collisions .",

    "second , the criterion for isotropization we use is less strict : while we only require at least 50% of event plane area to have @xmath99 , the central cell study demands @xmath125 in the whole cell , which corresponds to @xmath126 .    *",

    "for the applicability of viscous hydrodynamics it is necessary that @xmath129 .",

    "the effect of cuts on @xmath70 over space is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : x_paraview_cuts_effect ] .",
    "we made sure that the statistical effect does not play a significant role by checking that results do not change after increasing the number of events from @xmath136 to @xmath137 .",
    "the large anisotropy at very early times decreases after imposing cuts .",
    "but the anisotropy at later times is strikingly larger with cuts , first of all in the regions behind the nuclei . while without cuts we were able to introduce an  isotropization time ",
    ", when @xmath70 is smaller than @xmath138 at more than 50% of the area , with the cuts the anisotropy is so high all over the space that the isotropization time can not be introduced anymore .",
    "we have studied the energy - momentum tensor from the urqmd transport approach locally in space and time and quantified its deviation from the ideal fluid form with two numbers : the pressure anisotropy @xmath70 and the off - diagonality @xmath71 .",
    "first of all , we have shown that @xmath70 and @xmath71 depend on the number of urqmd events @xmath85 used to construct @xmath0 .",
    "low statistics implies large deviations , even if the underlying distribution function is completely thermal and isotropic .",
    "an initial state constructed from less than few hundred events ( or few hundred testparticles equivalently ) is bound to deviate strongly from the ideal fluid form",
    ". the off - diagonality appears to be mostly produced by this statistics effect . for large statistics @xmath71",
    "tends to be small in all the collision region at all times .",
    "the pressure anisotropy does not vanish at large statistics , it is a physical effect related to the anisotropy of the underlying distribution function @xmath82 . as a consequence ,",
    "the initial state from urqmd with enough statistics is suitable for anisotropic hydrodynamics .",
    "unfortunately , all the results depend on the smearing parameter @xmath3 . with larger @xmath3 isotropization",
    "is reached later , but the degree of isotropization is higher . from a practical point of view",
    "that means that selecting large @xmath3 one has to take larger fluidization time .",
    "this is in agreement with conclusion of @xcite that larger fluidization time should be taken for larger @xmath3 to obtain the same pion yield .",
    "however , strictly speaking , the physical limit is @xmath139 .",
    "we found that at small @xmath3 the isotropization time approaches to the time of geometrical criterion @xmath140 , so the geometrical criterion is partly justified , but only in the above mentioned limit . in the existing models the smearing parameters and statistics are such that at @xmath141 the anisotropies are very high .",
    "for the pressure anisotropy @xmath70 it was observed , that it exhibits a similar pattern for all the considered collision energies and centralities : there is a narrow interval of time , when it rapidly drops in a considerable volume .",
    "this feature allowed us to introduce and study the isotropization time @xmath107 .",
    "it decreases with collision energy , following the same trend as the geometrical overlap time .",
    "based on this finding a new fluidization criterion is suggested : @xmath142 , where @xmath143 depends only on the gaussian smearing @xmath3 and can be determined from fig .",
    "[ fig : t_iso_sensitivity_sigma ] .",
    "we observed a slight dependence of isotropization time on centrality : it increases with impact parameter , but the slope of this increase becomes smaller and smaller for higher energies .",
    "this behaviour has a simple geometrical interpretation .",
    "testing the smallness of the bulk pressure compared to pressure left beyond the scope of this article . as we have mentioned",
    ", the extracted bulk pressure depends on the equation of state , therefore this check has to be performed with a set of eos used in the literature . since in this article",
    "we restricted ourselves to testing the weak consistency , the next possible step is to test locally the fulfilment of the strong consistency .",

    "the general formula for calculating @xmath0 and @xmath1 from particles is @xmath144 here @xmath145 is the 1-particle distribution function . for a discrete set of particles it is @xmath146 for numerical calculations the spatial dependence of the distribution function needs to be smeared in some way , therefore the delta - function",
    "is substituted by some smearing kernel @xmath147 .",
    "the smearing kernel should satisfy three conditions : @xmath27 should be lorentz scalar , it should be normalized as @xmath148 , and it should approach the delta - function for smearing parameters approaching to zero .",
    "surprisingly , all current popular choices of @xmath26 are such that @xmath27 is not a lorentz scalar :    * cell averaging : @xmath149 . here",
    "@xmath27 is not a lorentz scalar , since volume @xmath150 is not contracted .",

    "gaussian in @xmath152 , @xmath133 , @xmath153 coordinates also behaves properly only under boosts in z direction .",
    "further we derive a simple , not too computationally demanding kernel , which satisfies all aforementioned conditions , in particular @xmath27 being a lorentz scalar . in the rest frame of the particle",
    "we take a gaussian : @xmath154 .",
    "if @xmath155 are the coordinates in the computational frame and @xmath156 are the coordinates in the rest frame then @xmath157 , where @xmath158 is the matrix of the lorentz transformation .",
    "we want to consider a gaussian at fixed time in the computational frame , so @xmath159 . denoting the spatial part of the particle 4-velocity as @xmath160 , where @xmath21 is 3-velocity and @xmath22 , one obtains @xmath161 to determine the normalization factor @xmath162",
    ", one can use that @xmath163 .",
    "the determinant @xmath164 , so @xmath165 and therefore @xmath166 .",
    "finally we obtain @xmath167 one can check that this formula turns into the commonly used one if @xmath168 . since @xmath169 in this case , we immediately retain the usual smearing kernel .",
    "scalar products do not change under rotations , so the expression in the exponential does not change under rotations either .",
    "rotating to the frame , where z axis is parallel to @xmath170 one can see that our kernel is nothing else , but a proper lorentz contraction in the direction of motion .",
