    "for colloidal dispersion systems , light scattering is a widely used technique to measure the characteristics of particles .",
    "one of the main applications of the dynamic light scattering ( dls ) technique is to obtain the z - average diffusion coefficient and its poly - dispersity index for particles in liquid suspension .",
    "the dls technique is to measure the particle properties from the normalized time auto - correlation function of the scattered light @xmath0 , here @xmath1 is the correlation delay time .",
    "the moments ( or cumulants ) method re1,re2,re3,re4 has been used as a standard method to measure the z - average diffusion coefficient and its poly - dispersity index from the dls data . in general ,",
    "when the dls data are analyzed , the mean diffusion coefficient and its poly - dispersity index obtained using the moments method are the apparent diffusion coefficient and its poly - dispersity index .    about the relationship between the z - average and apparent diffusion coefficients",
    "has been investigated by a few authors@xcite . under appropriate conditions , they measured the z - average diffusion coefficient by fitting @xmath2 to linear , quadratic and cubic function of @xmath1 .",
    "the effective values of @xmath3 and @xmath4 obtained from the fits are plotted against @xmath5 and thus are obtained by extrapolating @xmath5 to 0 , where @xmath3 is the mean decay rate .",
    "combining in the svedberg equation with the weight - average sedimentation coefficient , the weight - average molar mass can be yielded . for large particles ,",
    "the authors suggest the z - average diffusion coefficient should be measured at a small enough scattering angle . in order to obtain the accurate value of the weight - average molar mass , it is important to measure the value of z - average diffusion coefficient accurately .    in this work ,",
    "the z - average , effective , apparent diffusion coefficients and their poly - dispersity indexes were investigated for dilute poly - disperse homogeneous spherical particles in dispersion where the rayleigh - gans - debye ( rgd ) approximation is valid .",
    "the results reveal that the values of the apparent and effective diffusion coefficients at a scattering angle investigated are consistent and the difference between the effective and z - average diffusion coefficients is a function of the mean particle size , size distribution and scattering angle . for the small particles with narrow size distributions ,",
    "the z - average diffusion coefficient can be got directly at any scattering angle . for the small particles with wide size distributions",
    ", the z - average diffusion coefficient should be measured at a small scattering angle . for large particles , in order to obtain a good approximate value of z - average diffusion coefficient , the wider the particle size distribution , the smaller the scattering angle that the dls data are measured .",
    "the poly - dispersity index of the effective diffusion coefficient at a scattering angle investigated is consistent with that of the z - average diffusion coefficient and without considering the influences of noises , the difference between the poly - dispersity indexes of the z - average and apparent diffusion coefficients is determined by the mean particle size , size distribution and scattering angle together . for narrow particle size distributions , they are consistent",
    ". for wide particle size distributions , the poly - dispersity index of apparent diffusion coefficient should be measured at a @xmath6 range where @xmath7 changes to a small value in order to obtain a good approximate result of the poly - dispersity index of z - average diffusion coefficient .",
