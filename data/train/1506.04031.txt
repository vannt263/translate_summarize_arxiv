    "the vacuum of the standard model ( sm ) scalar potential is unstable since at high energies the higgs effective quartic coupling is driven to negative values by the renormalization group flow @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the sm can not be a complete theory of nature for various reasons , one of which is that neutrinos need to be massive in order to account for neutrino oscillation results  @xcite .    with only the sm fields",
    ", neutrino masses can arise in a model - independent way from a dimension 5 effective operator @xmath0 which gives rise to a @xmath1 neutrino mass after electroweak symmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "this same operator unavoidably provides a correction to the higgs self - coupling @xmath2 below the scale of the mechanism of neutrino mass generation through the diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "although tiny is suppressed by a factor @xmath3 . ] and negative , it suggests that the mechanism responsible for generating neutrino masses and is potentially relevant for the higgs stability problem .",
    "the quantitative effect of neutrino masses on the stability of the scalar potential will , however , be dependent on the ultra - violet completion of the model .    contribution of weinberg s effective operator to the higgs quartic interaction . ]    after the historic higgs boson discovery at cern and the confirmation of the brout - englert - higgs mechanism , it is natural to imagine that all symmetries in nature are broken spontaneously by the vacuum expectation values of scalar fields .",
    "the charge neutrality of neutrinos suggests them to be majorana fermions  @xcite , and that the smallness of their mass is due to the feeble breaking of lepton number symmetry .",
    "hence we need generalized electroweak breaking sectors leading to the double breaking of electroweak and lepton number symmetries .    in this letter",
    "we examine the vacuum stability issue within the simplest of such extended scenarios  , showing how one can naturally obtain a fully consistent behavior of the scalar potential at all scales for lepton number broken spontaneously at the tev scale .",
    "note that within the simplest gauge structure lepton number is a global symmetry whose spontaneous breaking implies the existence of a physical goldstone boson , generically called majoron and denoted @xmath4 , which must be a gauge singlet  @xcite in order to comply with lep restrictions  @xcite .",
    "its existence brings in new invisible higgs boson decays  @xcite @xmath5 leading to potentially sizable rates for missing momentum signals at accelerators  @xcite including the current lhc  @xcite .",
    "given the agreement of the atlas and cms results with the sm scenario , one can place limits on the presence of such invisible higgs decay channels .",
    "current lhc data on higgs boson physics still leaves room to be explored at the next run .",
    "absolute stability of the scalar potential is attainable as a result of the presence of the majoron , which is part of a complex scalar singlet .",
    "indeed , it is well known that generically the quartic coupling which controls the mixing between a scalar singlet and the higgs doublet contributes positively to the value of the higgs quartic coupling ( which we shall call @xmath6 ) at high energies @xcite  see diagram a in figure [ fig:2 ] . on the other hand , new fermions coupling to the higgs field @xmath7 , such as right - handed neutrinos @xcite , tend to destabilize @xmath6 not only through the 1-loop effect depicted in diagram @xmath8 of figure [ fig:2 ] , but also in what is effectively a two - loop effect ( diagram @xmath9 ) : through their yukawa interaction with @xmath7 , the new fermions soften the fall of the top yukawa coupling at higher energies , which in turn contributes negatively to @xmath6  .",
    "the model we consider below is a low  scale version of the standard type i majoron seesaw mechanism , such as the inverse seesaw type  @xcite .",
    "we stress however that , even though our renormalization group equations ( rges ) are the same as those characterizing standard case , the values of the dirac  type neutrino yukawa couplings are typically much higher in our inverse seeaw scenario .     in models with a complex singlet scalar @xmath10 , such as majoron type - i seesaw schemes , the positive contribution to the rge of the higgs quartic coupling ( diagram a ) is accompanied by the destabilizing effect of right - handed neutrinos through the 1-loop diagram @xmath8 and also through the two - loop diagram @xmath9 . ]",
    "the simplest scalar sector capable of driving the double breaking of electroweak and lepton number symmetry consists of the sm doublet @xmath7 plus a complex singlet @xmath10 , leading to the following higgs potential  @xcite @xmath11 in addition to the gauge invariance , @xmath12 has a global u(1 ) symmetry which will be associated to lepton number within specific model realizations .",
    "the potential is bounded from below provided that @xmath13 , @xmath6 and @xmath14 are positive ; these are less constraining conditions than those required for the existence of a consistent electroweak and lepton number breaking vacuum where both @xmath7 and @xmath10 adquire non - zero vacuum expectation values ( @xmath15 and @xmath16 ) . for that to happen , @xmath13 , @xmath6 and @xmath17 need to be all positive   for energies up to @xmath18  see @xcite for details . ] .",
    "three of the degrees of freedom in @xmath7 are absorbed by the massive electroweak gauge bosons , as usual .",
    "on the other hand , the imaginary part of @xmath10 becomes the nambu - goldstone boson associated to the breaking of the global lepton number symmetry , therefore it remains massless . as for the real oscillating parts of @xmath19 and @xmath10 ,",
    "these lead to two cp - even mass eigenstates @xmath20 and @xmath21 , with a mixing angle @xmath22 which can be constrained from lhc data  @xcite .",
    "we take the lighter state @xmath20 to be the 125 gev higgs particle recently discovered by the cms and atlas collaborations .    using the renormalization group equations ( given in the appendix )",
    "we evolved the three quartic couplings of the model imposing the vacuum stability conditions mentioned previously . given that such equations rely on perturbation theory ,",
    "the calculations were taken to be trustable only in those cases where the running couplings do not exceed @xmath23 . and @xmath24 at the @xmath25 scale  more precise values with higher order corrections can be found in @xcite .",
    "small changes to these input values ( for example a change of 0.03 in the top yukawa @xmath26 ) do not affect substancially our plots . ]     +",
    "in order to assign to the u(1 ) symmetry present in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pot ] ) the role of lepton number we must couple the new scalar singlet to leptonic fields .",
    "this can be done in a variety of ways . here",
    "we focus on low - scale generation of neutrino mass  @xcite . for definitiveness",
    "we choose to generate neutrino masses through the inverse seesaw mechanism @xcite with spontaneous @xcite .",
    "the fermion content of the standard model is augmented by right - handed neutrinos @xmath27 ( with lepton number + 1 ) and left - handed gauge singlets @xmath28 ( also with lepton number + 1 ) such that the mass term @xmath29 as well as the interactions @xmath30 and @xmath31 are allowed if @xmath10 carries -2 units of lepton number : which is , in principle , also allowed . ]",
    "@xmath32 the effective neutrino mass , in the one family approximation , is given by the expression @xmath33 which shows that the smallness of the neutrino masses can be attributed to a small ( but natural ) @xmath34 coupling , while still having @xmath35 of order one and both @xmath36 , @xmath37 in the tev range .",
    "in most cases , the stability of the potential is threatened by the violation of the condition @xmath38 , as in the standard model .",
    "instability can be avoided with a large @xmath39 , which might , however , lead to an unacceptably large mixing angle @xmath22 between the two cp - even higgs mass eigenstates  @xcite . in such cases , one must rely instead on a heavy @xmath21  see the green region in figs .",
    "[ scan1][scan3 ] . indeed , within the red regions therein , the potential becomes unbounded from below at some high energy scale , just like in the standard model .",
    "this happens for relatively small values of either @xmath22 or @xmath40 . as a result ,",
    "a tight experimental bound on @xmath22 can be used to place a lower limit on the mass of the heavier cp - even scalar . from fig .",
    "[ scan1 ] one can also see that the lepton breaking scale @xmath41 must not be too low , otherwise a big ratio @xmath42 will lead to the existence of a landau pole in the running parameters of the model before the planck scale is reached ( shown in orange ) .",
    "this also accounts for the difference between the two plots in fig .",
    "[ scan2 ] . +",
    "as far as the neutrino sector is concerned , since @xmath34 is taken to be small , this parameter has no direct impact on the potential s stability .",
    "however , it should be noted that in order to obtain neutrino masses in the correct range , the values of both @xmath43 and @xmath35 will depend on the one of @xmath34 . in principle",
    "then , @xmath35 might be large , but not too large , as @xmath44 leads to either unstable or non - perturbative dynamics .",
    "a non - zero dirac neutrino yukawa coupling has a destabilizing effect on the scalar potential which is visible in the recession of the green region to bigger values of @xmath22 and @xmath40 , when comparing the bottom plot in fig .",
    "[ scan2 ] and the one in fig .",
    "[ scan3 ] .",
    "+    another interesting possibility is to have a negligible @xmath45 and potentially sizeable @xmath46 . in this case , if we keep @xmath37 of the order of the tev , we find that the region of stability and perturbativity ( shown in green in fig .",
    "[ scan4 ] ) depends significantly upon the parameter @xmath46 characterizing spontaneous and neutrino mass generation through @xmath47 . to be more precise , as shown in fig .",
    "[ scan4 ] the allowed values for the mass of the heavy scalar boson ( @xmath48 ) varies with this yukawa coupling ; for example , if @xmath48 was to be found to be , say , @xmath49 tev ( @xmath50 tev by assumption here ) , then one would conclude that either @xmath51 or the scalar sector must be strongly interacting .",
    "+     the region stability and perturbativity for the case of non - zero @xmath52 and very small @xmath45 is displayed in green ; the color ordering code is the same as in the scan in fig .",
    "[ scan1].,scaledwidth=48.0% ]",
    "in conclusion , the standard model vacuum is unstable for the measured top and higgs boson masses .",
    "however the theory is incomplete as it has no masses for neutrinos .",
    "we have therefore generalized its symmetry breaking potential in order to induce naturally small neutrino masses from the breaking of lepton number .",
    "we have examined the vacuum stability issue in schemes with spontaneous breaking of global lepton number at the tev scale , showing how one can naturally obtain a consistent behavior of the scalar potential at all scales , avoiding the vacuum instability .",
    "given that the new physics parameters of the theory are not known , it sufficed for us to adopt one - loop renormalization group equations .",
    "since all new particles in the model lie at the tev scale , they can be probed with current experiments , such as the lhc .",
    "invisible decays of the two cp - even higgs bosons , @xmath53 , were discussed in  @xcite .",
    "improved sensitivity is expected from the 13  tev run of the lhc .",
    "in addition , we expect enhanced rates for lepton flavour violating processes  @xcite . in summary",
    ", schemes such as the one explored in this letter may shed light on two important drawbacks of the standard model namely , the instability associated to its gauge symmetry breaking mechanism and the lack of neutrino mass . +    * acknowledgements * +    we thank sofiane boucenna for discussions in the early phase of this project .",

    "in this appendix we provide some details on the scalar sector of the model . the potential in equation ( [ eq : pot ] )",
    "is controlled by 5 parameters ( @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath13 , @xmath6 , and @xmath39 ) which one can translate into two vacuum expectation values ( @xmath56 and @xmath57 ) , two mass eigenvalues ( @xmath58 and @xmath40 ) and a mixing angle @xmath22 : @xmath59 with @xmath60 on the other hand , it is well known that the standard model potential is controlled by just two parameters @xmath61 and @xmath2 : @xmath62 for a reasonably small mixing angle @xmath22 , one can consider that the state @xmath20 is mostly made of the real part of the singlet , hence we may integrate out @xmath63 . in this approximation , we note that @xmath64 at the scale of decoupling , meaning in particular that there is a tree - level threshold correction between @xmath6 and the standard model quartic coupling @xmath2 .",
    "for the results in this paper , we neglect altogether the small standard model range between the @xmath65 and @xmath58 scale , starting instead with equations ( [ eq : lsigma])([eq : mu2h ] ) , which already include this threshold effect .",
    "for completeness , we write down here the renormalization group equations of the model parameters which are relevant for the study of the potential s stability . we work with the 1-family approximation , ignoring the bottom and tau yukawa couplings .",
    "these equations were obtained with the sarah program @xcite ( see also @xcite ) and explicitly checked by us using the results in @xcite ; furthermore they are consistent with @xcite . as usual",
