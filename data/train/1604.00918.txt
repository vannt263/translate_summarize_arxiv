    "since the discovery of the time - reversal symmetry ( trs ) protected , z@xmath1 topological insulators ( tis ) , searching for more realizable topological states of matter becomes one of the attractive tasks in condensed matter community.@xcite using k - theory or altland - zirnbauer scheme , people even propose a `` periodic table '' for classifying topological insulators and superconductors ( scs).@xcite one class of the earlier known topological superconductors is the so - called 2d chiral ( trs - broken ) superconductors .",
    "chiral scs can exhibit several intriguing properties due to their non - trivial topology of band structures , such as gapless chiral edge modes that carry quantized thermal current@xcite and majorana zero modes bound in the vortices.@xcite although there are proposed candidate chiral scs like sr@xmath1ruo@xmath2 , the experimental evidence is still not definitive.@xcite more potential materials are therefore needed .",
    "there are basically two approaches to achieve 2d chiral superconductivity : 1 ) such unconventional sc is triggered internally by electron - electron interactions@xcite ; 2 ) such order is induced externally at the interface by the proximity effect of a conventional sc to a quantum ( anomalous ) hall insulator or rashba system.@xcite in the first approach , `` strong '' correlation usually plays an essential role .",
    "thus , a promising way which caught people s eye is to consider the physics around van hove singuralities ( vhs ) . at 2d vhs ,",
    "the density of states ( dos ) _ diverges _ logarithmically and hence strongly enhances the effect of interactions . in recent years",
    ", several efforts have been devoted along this direction and possible chiral / helical sc and magnetic orders are predicted in various lattice structures.@xcite    according to a recent work by yao and yang,@xcite one can separate vhs into two types by their position @xmath3 in the first brillouin zone ( bz ) : when @xmath3 locate at time - reversal invariant momenta , vhs belong to type - i ; otherwise , they belong to type - ii .",
    "an immediate consequence is that , within the same crystal structure , the number of vhs of type - ii is doubled , compared to that of type - i .",
    "this leads to different emergent symmetry breaking orders .",
    "for instance , in the hexagonal system like graphene , a chiral @xmath4-wave _ singlet _ sc is predicted@xcite ; however , in bc@xmath5 , a helical @xmath6-wave _ triplet _ sc is singled out.@xcite so far , most of the studies assume spin su(2 ) symmetry is preserved ( or at least approximately ) with each band doubly degenerate , while systems with strong spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) such as usually seen on the surfaces of a 3d ti have not yet been discussed",
    ".    in this work , we study the physics around type - ii vhs appearing in the topologically protected surface states of the sb(111 ) thin films ( or bulk ) , which commonly have a hexagonal surface bz.@xcite we consider a @xmath7 model for the surface states and perform patch renormalization group ( rg ) analysis to investigate the competing orders in the system near vhs .",
    "we show that the leading instability is a chiral @xmath0-wave superconducting order under weak repulsive interactions , robust against the interaction strength and a range of material - dependent paramters .",
    "the origin of such pairing relies on the strong anisotropy of the electron - electron scattering after renormalization to provide an attractive channel , just in the same spirit of kohn - luttinger type mechanism.@xcite our results therefore suggest that the sb thin films could be another promising candidate for hosting majorana zero modes , whcih may be utilized in performing topological quantum computation.@xcite    the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we briefly discuss the model used to describe the surface states in the sb(111 ) thin film and show the existence of the vhs .",
    "iii turns to consider the low - energy effective theory of the system and sketch how we perform the rg analysis . after solving the rg equations and calculating the renormalized susceptibilities for various symmetry breaking orders , in sec .",
    "iv , we present the phase diagram and discuss the leading order .",
    "finally , sec .",

    "bulk sb is known as a topological semimetal with non - trivial surface states.@xcite making it a thin film , viewed as a stacking of ( 111 ) bilayers ( bl ) , still preserves the topological property of the surface states so long as the number of bl is no less than five.@xcite thus , one can start with a bulk sample .",
    "sb has the rhombohedral a7 structure , which consists of two interpenetrating , face - centered cubic lattices , displaced with each other along [ 111 ] direction .",
    "similar to bi@xmath1te@xmath5 , the crystal symmetry of the ( 111 ) surface is reduced to point group @xmath10 .",
    "based on this fact , instead of developing a liu - allen - like tight - binding model,@xcite we simply adopt a @xmath7 model , originally developed by liang fu for bi@xmath1te@xmath5,@xcite for the surface electrons of sb(111 ) .",
    "it is essential to note that the form of such model is restricted by both @xmath10 and trs .",
    "consequently , h()=e_0()+v_(k_x _ y - k_y_x)+(k_+^3+k_-^3)_z , where @xmath11 , expanding from @xmath12 , @xmath13 denoting fermi velocity with momentum - dependent corrections , and a natural pseudo - spin doublet at @xmath12 corresponding to total angular momentum @xmath14 is chosen to be the basis .",
    "the first term , @xmath15 , introduces particle - hole asymmetry , while the second and third terms correspond to socs in linear and cubic orders , respectively .",
    "the ( surface ) band dispersion of the model can be easily solved as e_()=e_0 ( ) , where @xmath16 is the polar angle of @xmath17 with respect to @xmath18 axis [ defined in fig .",

    ", we therefore legitimately take the `` patch approximation''@xcite and neglect electrons far away from the saddle points .",
    "taking into account the patches around six saddle points , the low - energy physics can be described by the following effective action : s & = & dd^2 x_=1 ^ 6\\ { ^ _ _ + & - & ^_^_^_^ _ -^_^_^_^_-^_^_|_| _ + & - & [ ^_^_|_+1_|+1+h.c . ] } , [ eq : effective ] where @xmath34 are creation operators of electrons with patch ( vhs ) indices @xmath35 , 6 [ see fig .",

    "the short - range interaction is assumed , which may be justified by the metallic screening effect due to the states near the fermi surface .",
    "there are four types of interactions , denoting their coupling strength from @xmath55 to @xmath56 [ see fig .",
    "2(b ) ] , which are constrained by the momentum conservation .",
    "the first three types represent nn , nnn , and nnnn density - density interactions and thus the bare values of @xmath55 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 are generically positive .",
    "the fourth type represents the pair hopping process .",
    "all of these interactions are _ marginal _ at tree level in 2d and would acquire logarithmic corrections ( divergences ) in perturbation theory .",
    "therefore , below , we will employ the rg technique@xcite to deal with this situation and to determine which kind of symmetry breaking order might occur as the temperature decreases .",
    "we perform rg analysis up to one - loop level via integrating out the high - energy degrees of freedom gradually from the energy cutoff @xmath44 to study how interactions flow .",

    "in addition , the presence of an insulating or semiconducting substrate in growing the thin film also brings an advantage that the vhs from the upper and lower surfaces could be separated in energy and may safely neglect the effect from quantum tunneling due to small dos from the other side .    in the perspective of applications",

    "<S> we theoretically investigate the development of unconventional superconductivity in the sb(111 ) thin film when its fermi level is tuned to near type - ii van hove singularities ( vhs ) , which locate at non - time - reversal invariant momenta . via patch renormalization group analysis </S>",
    "<S> , we show that the leading instability is a chiral @xmath0-wave superconducting order . the origin of such pairing relies on the hexagonal structure of the vhs and strong spin - orbit coupling , resulting in the anisotropy of the electron - electron scattering to provide an attractive channel . </S>",
    "<S> our study hence suggests that superconducting sb thin films originated from vhs physics may host majorana zero modes in the magnetic vortices and provides another application perspective to such material . </S>"
