    "w  39 is a large region in the inner galaxy ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 ) first identified in the @xcite 1.4 ghz radio continuum survey and more recently cataloged as a large infrared `` bubble '' by both professional astronomers ( n24 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and citizen scientists ( mwp1g18908 - 003146 ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is a significant high - mass star - forming region and a possible example of sequential or triggered star formation based on the hierarchical bubble structure seen in the infrared , but , owing to its highly obscured location in the inner galaxy , it has been poorly studied .",
    "recent high - resolution ( sub - arcminute ) surveys at radio and infrared wavelengths have provided an opportunity to examine this region in detail for the first time .",
    "this paper presents an analysis of the region itself along with an investigation of the influence of the region on star formation in its vicinity .    in the next section",
    "the key parameters of the various data sets used in the study are summarized .",
    "the determination of the radial velocity and distance to the region is described in  [ sec : rvd ] .",
    "an analysis of w  39 and three associated compact regions follows in  [ sec : ghii ] . in  [ sec : yso ] the young stellar object ( yso ) distribution surrounding w  39 is explored , and our conclusions are presented in ",
    "[ sec : conc ] .",
    "at cm radio wavelengths we use vla galactic plane survey ( vgps ; @xcite ) 21-cm line and continuum data .",
    "the vgps maps have an angular resolution of @xmath8  arcmin , and the line spectra have a velocity resolution of 1.56 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "the maps include single - dish short - spacing data , making them ideal for obtaining flux density measurements of large angular scale ( @xmath9  arcmin ) objects like w  39 .",
    "to trace molecular gas we use @xmath10co ( j@xmath111@xmath120 ) observations from the boston university / five college radio astronomy observatory galactic ring survey ( bu / fcrao grs ; @xcite ) .",
    "these data have an angular resolution of 46  arcsec and 0.21 km  s@xmath2 velocity resolution .",
    "we also make use of 1.1 mm continuum data from the bolocam galactic plane survey ( bgps ; @xcite ) .      at infrared wavelengths we primarily use data from the glimpse @xcite _ spitzer _ legacy survey .",
    "glimpse provides 1.7 to 2.0  arcsec resolution images in four bands centered at 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , and 8.0 @xmath13 m along with a point source catalog that contains near- and mid - infrared photometric data .",

    "in figure  [ fig : w39cont ] we show the vgps 1420 mhz continuum map of the area around w  39 along with the position and velocity of cm - wavelength observations of the radio recombination lines ( rrl ) h85@xmath14 , h87@xmath14 , and h88@xmath14 @xcite .",
    "w  39 has a bubble morphology best seen in the infrared . at radio wavelengths the brightest emission ( @xmath15  k ) from w  39 is concentrated along a u - shaped ridge opening to lower galactic longitudes",
    ". fainter emission ( @xmath16 30  40  k ) is found within the bubble and also tracing the bubble edges at lower galactic longitude . there is a local minimum in the radio emission around @xmath17 that is a likely location for the exciting ob star(s ) .",
    "three of the rrl observations that lie on the strong ridge of emission have very similar velocities , and we adopt the average of these values , @xmath18 km  s@xmath2 , as the radial velocity of w  39 .",
    "the rrl velocity of g18.95 - 0.02 is significantly different from the main ridge and , as we discuss in  [ sec : irmorph ] , this region is likely not directly associated with w  39 .",
    "the nature of the rrl emission associated with the arc - shaped structure g18.64 - 0.29 is more speculative .",
    "both @xcite and @xcite classify this object as a supernova remnant ( snr ) based on multi - frequency radio observations , and absorption studies by @xcite place the object at a distance of @xmath19 kpc .",
    "rrl emission is not expected from snrs so it is likely that the observed rrl emission , with a difference in velocity of only @xmath19 km  s@xmath2 from the main w  39 ridge , is originating from the edge of the w  39 bubble .",
    "absorption spectra , obtained from the vgps , were used to determine if all three of the rrl sources are located at the same near or far kinematic distance . a radio continuum source in the inner galaxy at the near distance",
    "can only show absorption up to its @xmath20 while a source at the far distance can show absorption at velocities beyond @xmath20 up to the tangent velocity , which at @xmath21 is 110 to 140 km  s@xmath2 depending on the kinematic model used ( see   [ sec : kindis ] ) .    for each of the rrl sources `` on '' spectra",
    "were obtained by averaging spectra where the 1420 mhz continuum brightness temperature was above a threshold of 100  k for g19.07 - 0.28 , 100  k for g18.88 - 0.49 , and 55  k for g19.04 - 0.43 .",
    "`` off '' spectra were then calculated by taking the average spectrum of a nearby ( 12 arcmin offset ) similarly sized region .",
    "the resulting on - off absorption spectra are shown in figure  [ fig : hispec ] .",
    "the uncertainty in an absorption spectrum @xmath22 can be quantified by taking the maximum of either the standard deviation in channels where no absorption is expected to occur ( e.g. , at negative @xmath20 in this case ) or by constructing `` off - off '' spectra that measure the intrinsic variability of emission structure .",
    "we found @xmath23  k in each case .",
    "looking at figure  [ fig : hispec ] we see that the two brightest rrl sources are clearly at the near kinematic distance because of the lack of absorption at velocities @xmath24  km  s@xmath2 .",
    "the ridge rrl source has a much poorer quality spectrum , but there is no evidence for absorption beyond @xmath25  km  s@xmath2 . we conclude that all of the emission associated with the three rrl observations is at the near kinematic distance .      in figure  [ fig : ir8_24 ]",
    "we show an 8 and 24 @xmath13 m image of the w  39 region using data from _",
    "glimpse and mipsgal .",
    "the infrared bubble structure , best seen at 8  @xmath13 m and identified by @xcite and @xcite , is indicated by an ellipse . as expected for a thermal radio source w  39",
    "is very bright in the infrared .",
    "of particular interest though is the layered structure of the infrared emission ; moving from the interior of the u - shaped structure to the exterior , we first see 24  @xmath13 m emission followed by a layer of 8  @xmath13 m emission .",
    "this is exactly what would be expected for a region being heated from one side by ionizing radiation . within the region",
    "polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pah ) are strongly depleted allowing 24.0 @xmath13 m emission from small dust grains to dominate while in the photodissociation region ( pdr ) surrounding the region pahs can survive resulting in strong 8  @xmath13 m emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the continuity of this layered infrared morphology is consistant with w  39 being a single large region .",

    "the g18.95 - 0.01 region is morphologically very similar to co emission seen in the grs at @xmath28 km  s@xmath2 consistent with the lower rrl velocity observed by @xcite .",
    "based on this we do not consider this region to be part of w  39 .",
    "the co maps also show that most of the molecular gas along the line of sight to w  39 is found between + 60 and + 70 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "the ( near ) kinematic distance to w  39 was calculated using @xmath18 km  s@xmath2 and three different galactic rotation models : 1 ) the r@xmath29= 8  kpc hydrodynamical model of @xcite , 2 ) the r@xmath29=8.5  kpc , v@xmath29=220 km  s@xmath2 model of @xcite , and 3 ) a version of the @xcite model scaled to r@xmath29=8.0  kpc .",
    "the resulting distances are 4.5 kpc , 4.7 kpc , and 4.4 kpc respectively . in each case",
    "the error in the calculated distance caused by the uncertainty in @xmath20 is only @xmath30 kpc , much less than the systematic uncertainty associated with the choice of rotation model .",
    "we adopt the average ( standard deviation ) of these values as the distance ( uncertainty ) to w  39 : @xmath31  kpc . at this distance , w  39 is probably part of the scutum - centaurus arm of our galaxy @xcite .",
    "the flux density at 1420 mhz of w  39 , @xmath32  jy , was measured from vgps data using imview @xcite to integrate the emission within a user - defined area roughly following the @xmath33  k contour , but omitting emission at @xmath34 and subtracting the contribution from compact and point sources found within the contour . the main contribution to",
    "the uncertainty comes from the definition of the background level which varies depending on the number and location of the points used to define it and the order of the two - dimensional polynomial fit used .    the observed radio continuum flux density ( @xmath35 ) of an region at a distance ( @xmath36 )",
    "can be related to the ionizing radiation luminosity ( @xmath37 ) of the star(s ) located within the region by : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the fraction of the ionizing radiation from the star(s ) that is intercepted by the region ( e.g. , @xmath40 for an ionization bounded region , @xmath41 for a `` blister '' region ) , and we used @xmath42  ghz and @xmath43  k to calculate the constant @xcite . as pointed out by @xcite equation  [ eqn : logq ] does not depend on the details of the density structure of the region .    for @xmath44",
    "pc and @xmath45  jy we find @xmath46 , equivalent to the output of two o3  v stars ( or 10 o7  v stars ) using the calibration of @xcite .",
    "varying distance and @xmath35 within the uncertainties , and allowing @xmath47 to range between 7500  k and 10,000  k , we find the full range of @xmath48 . given the morphology of the region it is very likely that @xmath49 and w  39 is a giant region ( ghiir ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) being powered by numerous ob stars .",
    "the formulas given in @xcite , and derived in detail in @xcite , can be used to estimate the average electron density of the region and the total mass of ionized gas given @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath47 , and the angular size of the region .",
    "an appropriate size scale for w  39 is given by the separation between the two sides of the region , @xmath50 , or 30 pc at 4.5 kpc .",
    "this is slightly smaller than the value of @xmath51 reported in @xcite , but that value included emission at higher galactic latitude that we do not associate with the region .",
    "we find values of @xmath52  @xmath53 and @xmath54  m@xmath29 .",
    "unlike the @xmath55 calculation these values do depend strongly on the details of the region s density structure and should only be considered order - of - magnitude estimates .",
    "the radio source g19.07 - 0.28 is the brightest of the compact radio sources found on the periphery of w  39 with @xmath56  jy . using the same formulas and calibrations from the previous subsection we find @xmath57 equivalent to a single o8  v star .",
    "the ionized gas mass is @xmath58  m@xmath29 and the average electron density is @xmath59  @xmath53 .",
    "this radio source is also the infrared source iras 18239 - 1228 and has four well - defined iras flux density measurements . using the technique of @xcite we calculate the far - infrared luminosity @xmath60 which is the luminosity of an o7 - o8  v star .",
    "the higher resolution glimpse 8.0  @xmath13 m image of the region is shown in figure  [ fig : bubble ] . at this wavelength",
    "the source is clearly a bubble structure with a radius of @xmath61 ( @xmath62  pc ) .",
    "ionized gas , traced by the 1420 mhz radio emission , and warm dust , traced by 24  @xmath13 m emission , fill the central region .",
    "the compact bubble morphology of the region and the agreement in the stellar spectral type determined by the radio and infrared flux support the idea that the region is ionization bounded ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "the radio source g18.88 - 0.49 is the second brightest of the compact radio sources found on the periphery of w  39 with @xmath64  jy . from this",
    "we find @xmath65 equivalent to a single o8  v star .",
    "the ionized gas mass is @xmath66  m@xmath29 and the average electron density is @xmath59  @xmath53 .    unlike g19.07 - 0.28",
    "there is no iras point source associated with this region .",
    "the higher resolution glimpse 8.0  @xmath13 m image of the region is shown in figure  [ fig : west ] .",
    "although the morphology is more complex than g19.07 - 0.28 , the presence of bright - rimmed structures at the edge of the radio continuum emission along with the coincident 24  @xmath13 m emission suggest that we are also looking at a dusty , ionization - bounded , bubble structure similar in size to g19.07 - 0.28 .",
    "the remaining radio source on the periphery of w  39 is g18.94 - 0.43 .",
    "we measured @xmath67  jy , which corresponds to @xmath68 , equivalent to a single o9  v star .",
    "the ionized gas mass is @xmath69  m@xmath29 , and the average electron density is @xmath70  @xmath53 .    as with g18.88 - 0.49 there is no iras point source associated with the region .",
    "the high resolution image of the region shown in figure  [ fig : west ] reveals a complex morphology that is difficult to interpret in detail . as we would expect for an region there appears to be bright - rimmed structures along the low - latitude portion of the region and a minimum in the 8  @xmath13 m emission coincident with the radio continuum maximum .",
    "the radio continuum view of the w  39 region is of an evolved massive hii region ( powered by multiple mid- to early - type o stars ) with multiple areas of less intense massive star formation ( i.e. , the three regions powered by single late o stars ) occurring along the periphery of the region .",
    "one possibility is that these secondary regions of star formation have been triggered by the expansion of the w  39 region .",
    "while proving this idea is difficult we can at least investigate the relevant timescales for the most clearly defined secondary region , g19.07 - 0.28 , to see if this scenario is at all plausible .",
    "we can obtain a rough estimate of the age of g19.07 - 0.28 using the classic description of the evolution of an region @xcite .",
    "the o star first creates a ionized gas region about the size of the strmgren sphere on an essentially instantaneous timescale of @xmath71  yr .",
    "the overpressurized region then expands from its initial radius , @xmath72 to the observed radius @xmath73 at time @xmath74 as , @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the isothermal sound speed in the ionized gas ( @xmath77  km  s@xmath2 ) .    to estimate the initial density of the cloud in which the region formed we examined the nearby 1.1 mm source from the bgps , g019.077 - 00.287 .",
    "the peak brightness of this source is 2.3 jy beam@xmath2 corresponding to a column density of @xmath78  @xmath79 using equation a.27 in @xcite .",
    "the deconvolved radius of the source is @xmath80 ( @xmath81  pc ) . adopting a path length of 4  pc we obtain a density @xmath82  @xmath53 .",
    "in such an environment an o8  v star would rapidly create an region of size @xmath83  pc . using this value and the observed size of the region @xmath84  pc in equation  [ eqn : h2evo ] we find @xmath85 years .    while this is clearly a rough estimate it is important to note that this timescale is approximately one order of magnitude smaller than the timescales appropriate for the evolution of the much larger w  39 region .",
    "as pointed out by @xcite , an approximate lower limit to the age of an evolved region can be obtained by the sound crossing time , @xmath86 years in the case of w  39 .",
    "the lack of non - thermal radio emission from snrs gives a consistent upper limit to the age of @xmath87 years based on the main sequence lifetime of early o stars @xcite .",
    "we conclude that the probable timescales associated with the expansion of w  39 ( @xmath88 years ) and the likely ages of the secondary regions of massive star formation ( @xmath89 years ) are consistent with a scenario of triggered star formation .",
    "in order to determine if the only recent , and thus likely triggered , star formation activity surrounding w  39 is restricted to the three compact regions discussed previously , we used the _ spitzer _",
    "glimpse catalog to identify yso candidates ( ysos hereafter ) in the w  39 field within @xmath90 , @xmath91 .",
    "the high latitude cutoff was chosen to avoid including the prominent infrared dark clouds ( irdcs ) found at @xmath34 which are not associated with w  39 .",
    "a total of 10657 sources with valid magnitudes in all four irac bands were identified .",
    "figure  [ fig : ccd ] is a color - color ( cc ) diagram showing all of these sources along with the yso classification criteria from @xcite .",
    "we identify 57 class i ysos , 129 class ii ysos and 57 class i / ii ysos ( [ 3.6]-[4.5 ] @xmath92 and [ 5.8]-[8.0]@xmath93 ) .",
    "class i ysos are objects with a substantial circumstellar envelope , class ii ysos have most of the circumstellar material residing in a disk , and class i / ii objects are most likely class ii or stellar objects with poor [ 8.0 ] photometry causing them to scatter into this region of the cc diagram . in the canonical picture",
    ", a class i yso will evolve to a class ii yso with each stage of evolution lasting for @xmath94 years and @xmath95 years respectively @xcite .    in figure",
    "[ fig : cmd ] the sample is plotted in a [ 3.6]-[4.5 ] vs. [ 3.6 ] color - magnitude ( cm ) diagram .",
    "we see there is a bright cutoff at [ 3.6 ] @xmath96 due to saturation and a faint , color - dependent , sensitivity cutoff at [ 3.6 ] @xmath97 . included in the cm diagram are two lines showing the position of main - sequence stars ( b0  v to m5  v ) and giant stars ( g5  iii to m0  iii ) at a distance of 4.5 kpc . the crosses are t - tauri stars from @xcite shifted from the distance of taurus - auriga to w  39 .",
    "the diamonds are intermediate - mass herbig aebe stars from @xcite and @xcite again shifted to the distance of w  39 . for the herbig aebe sample we have used l and m band magnitudes as rough proxies for [ 3.6 ] and [ 4.5 ] .",
    "finally , the asterisks represent agb stars from the _ spitzer_/irac study of galactic agb stars by reiter , marengo , & fazio ( in preparation ) .",
    "the cm diagram illustrates that our sample is primarily sensitive to intermediate - mass ysos at a distance of 4.5 kpc .",
    "the cm diagram also provides some insights into likely contaminants in our sample .",
    "we see that the majority of background main - sequence stars are too faint to be detected while foreground main - sequence stars with moderate amounts of reddening will be a source of contamination for the least - red class ii ysos . the major contaminant , for both class i and class ii ysos , are reddened background agb stars . unfortunately , since we are looking toward the inner galaxy , background stellar distances approaching 20 to 30 kpc are possible meaning even the faintest , reddest , sources in our sample could be matched by a distant , heavily reddened agb .    in figure",
    "[ fig : pos ] we show the spatial distribution of the various yso classes .",
    "it is clear that star formation activity is not uniformly distributed along the periphery of the w  39 bubble with the most striking feature being the lack of ysos at the high and low longitude ends of the bubble around @xmath98 and @xmath99 respectively .",
    "this is consistent with the lack of molecular gas seen at these locations in the @xmath10co images shown in figure  [ fig : co ] .",
    "there is also a swath of ysos located within the infrared bubble that roughly follows the @xmath10co distribution seen in the lower left panel of figure  [ fig : co ] .",
    "almost all of the @xmath77 class i sources found within the bubble are associated with an irdc that runs roughly from @xmath100 to @xmath101 at @xmath102 .",
    "if associated with w  39 , these sources could represent recent star formation occurring in the near or far wall of the bubble , but it is also possible that the irdc is not directly related to w  39 .",
    "we tried to measure the @xmath20 of the irdc , but were unable to clearly identify any @xmath10co features that were unambiguously associated with the irdc .",
    "higher resolution radio / mm line observations of this irdc in tracers of cold , dense gas would help to clarify its relation to w  39 .",
    "qualitatively it appears from figure  [ fig : pos ] that most of the star - formation activity located on the periphery of w  39 is concentrated around the compact regions . in order examine this quantitatively",
    "we divided our search area into 32 roughly @xmath103 areas and calculated the percentage of sources in each area that have a yso classification ( see figure  [ fig : red ] ) .",
    "the `` background '' yso percentage , using the median of the eight high and low longitude columns , is 1.8% with an interquartile range of 0.85% .",
    "the ysos within the bubble show up as a slight excess over the background ( @xmath104% ) but the main outliers are the areas around g18.88 - 0.49 and g19.07 - 0.28 with yso percentages of 6.6% and 6.0% respectively .",
