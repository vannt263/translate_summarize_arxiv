    "the investigation of physical properties of the low - dimensional quantum spin systems with competing interactions in an external magnetic field has been a subject of increasingly intense research interest in the recent decades .",
    "the research interest of these systems has attracted much attention due to the following reasons : first , they can be solved exactly by using different mathematical techniques , second , they are realized in the nature , and third , these systems present rich thermodynamic behavior , such as the appearance of magnetization plateaus , double peaks structure of the specific heat and magnetic susceptibility .",
    "one of the interesting low - dimensional quantum spin system is the frustrated diamond heisenberg spin - chain .",
    "the physical properties of real materials such as copper mineral @xmath2 , known as natural azurite ( copper carbonate hydroxide ) can be well described by using the quantum antiferromagnetic heisenberg model on a generalized diamond chain .",
    "the physical properties of the heisenberg model on diamond chain have been investigated using different methods they are full numerical diagonalization and the lanczos algorithm @xcite , the decoration - iteration transformation @xcite , the mapping transformation technique @xcite , the density - matrix renormalization - group ( dmrg ) and transfer - matrix renormalization - group ( tmrg ) techniques @xcite , gibbs - bogoliubov approach @xcite , cluster approach @xcite , the generalized gradient approximations ( gga ) @xcite , the density functional theory and state - of - the - art numerical many body calculations @xcite .",
    "intriguing properties of the azurite made it a good candidate for studying its properties on the low - dimensional quantum spin systems .",
    "kikuchi and co - workers @xcite have experimentally studied the physical properties of the compound @xmath2 .",
    "they have shown that azurite can be regarded as a model substance of a distorted diamond chain .",
    "the temperature dependence on the magnetic susceptibility and specific heat shows double peak structure ( around 20 and 5 k ) on both magnetic susceptibility and specific heat results .",
    "the existence of the magnetization plateau at one third of the saturation magnetization has also been experimentally observed in the magnetization curve .",
    "the aim of the recursion relation method is to cut lattice into branches and express the partition function of all lattice through the partition function of branches .",
    "this procedure will allow to derive one- or multi - dimensional mapping for branches of the partition function .",
    "after which the thermodynamic quantities of the physical system such as magnetization , magnetic susceptibility , specific heat can be expressed through recursion relation .",
    "one and multi dimensional mapping allows to investigate properties of different models for example ising model on husimi lattice @xcite , zigzag ladder @xcite , triangular lattice @xcite , two - layer bethe lattice @xcite , mixed - spin ising model on a decorated bethe lattice @xcite , q - state potts model on the bethe lattice @xcite , zigzag ladder @xcite , phase diagrams for both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic cases , multicritical points , for the spin-1 ising model on the bethe lattice @xcite .",
    "in this paper we have investigated some properties of the spin-@xmath0 ising - heisenberg model on diamond chain by using dynamical system ( recursion relation ) approach . especially we have investigated magnetic properties of the model and shown the existence of the magnetization plateau at one third of the saturation value .",
    "the investigation of the ground - state properties of the model in the @xmath3 plane shows the existence of three phases in the antiferromagnetic case and two phases in the ferromagnetic case .",

    "especially we have shown the existence of the plateau in the maximal lyapunov exponent curve .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in the next section using the recursion relation method we derive the exact two dimensional recursion relations for the partition function of the spin-@xmath0 ising - heisenberg model on diamond chain .",

    "we will consider the case when external magnetic field is uniform @xmath17 .",
