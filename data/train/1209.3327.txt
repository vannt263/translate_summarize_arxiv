    "optics of nanoscale materials has attracted considerable attention in the past several years @xcite due to various important applications @xcite .",
    "exploring electrodynamics of near - fields associated with subwavelength systems , researchers are now truly dwelling into nanoscale @xcite . owing to both new materials processing techniques @xcite and continuous progress in laser physics @xcite the research in nano - optics is currently transitioning from linear systems , where materials and their relative arrangement control optical properties @xcite , to the nonlinear regime @xcite .",
    "the latter expands optical control capabilities far beyond conventional linear optics as in the case of active plasmonic materials @xcite , for instance , combining highly localized electromagnetic ( em ) radiation driven by surface plasmon - polaritons ( spp ) with non - linear materials  @xcite .",
    "yet another promising research direction , namely optics of highly coupled exciton - polariton systems , is emerging @xcite .",
    "it basically reincarnates a part of research in semiconductors @xcite , bringing it to nanoscale via deposition of ensembles of quantum emitters ( molecules @xcite , quantum dots @xcite ) directly on to plasmonic materials .    even in the linear regime , when the external em radiation is not significantly exciting the quantum sub - system , spp near - fields can be strongly coupled to quantum emitters .",
    "this manifests itself as a rabi splitting widely observed in transmission experiments @xcite .",
    "moreover , a new phenomenon , namely collective molecular modes driven by spp near - fields , has been observed @xcite and recently explained @xcite .",
    "it was also shown that nanoscale clusters comprised of optically coupled quantum emitters exhibit collective scattering and absorption @xcite similar to dicke superradiance @xcite .",
    "it is hence important to be able to account for collective effects in a self - consistent manner .",
    "we also note that a series of works by neuhauser _ et al . _",
    "@xcite clearly demonstrated that the presence of a single molecule nearby a plasmonic material can significantly alter the scattering spectra .",
    "in many applications ( such as optics of molecular layers coupled to plasmonic materials @xcite , for instance ) self - consistent modeling relies heavily on the numerical integration of the corresponding maxwell - bloch equations , assuming that static emitter - emitter interactions can be neglected , which is true for systems at relatively low densities .",
    "such an approximation results in expressing the local polarization in terms of a product of the local density of quantum emitters and the local averaged single emitter s dipole moment @xcite .",
    "one of the first efficient numerical schemes for simulations of nonlinear optical phenomena of quantum media driven by external classical em radiation was proposed by ziolkowski et al .",
    "@xcite . using a one - dimensional example of ensembles of two - level atoms",
    "it was shown that the corresponding maxwell - bloch equations can be successfully integrated using an iterative scheme based on the predictor - corrector method ( _ strongly coupled method _ ) . later on this approach",
    "has been extended to two- @xcite and three - dimensional systems @xcite .",
    "although such a scheme accurately captures the system s dynamics , it can become extensively slow for multidimensional systems @xcite .",
    "moreover this method is limited to two - level systems only .",
    "a more efficient technique based on the decoupling of bloch equations from the ampere law was proposed in 2003 by bidgaray @xcite .",
    "this latter method , usually referred to as a _ weakly coupled method _ , noticeably improves the efficiency of the numerical integration of maxwell - bloch equations , allowing to consider multilevel quantum media @xcite .",
    "the approach proposed in the present paper is based on this weakly coupled method @xcite .",
    "it further improves the numerical efficiency of the maxwell - bloch integrator for ensembles of multilevel quantum emitters . by incorporating a new non - hermitian wave packet propagation technique into the weakly coupled method",
    ", we demonstrate that our approach can be successfully applied to ensembles of multilevel atoms and diatomic molecules .",
    "we show with this method that it is sufficient to propagate a single wave function instead of the complete density matrix .",
    "relaxation and dephasing are taken into account via empirical gain and decay rates whose time - dependence is automatically adapted for an optimal description of dephasing processes .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first introduce our model in section [ sec : tls ] , using , as an example , an ensemble of two - level atoms .",
    "the non - hermitian wave packet approximation is then described in section [ sec : nhtlwpa ] .",
    "applications of the proposed method to the case of a nano - layer comprised of two - level atoms are discussed in section [ sec : aunla ] .",
    "we then generalize our method to the case of interacting multi - level emitters in section [ sec : multilevels ] . finally ,",
    "using this generalized approach , we calculate in section [ sec : molecular_layer ] the optical properties of a nano - layer of coupled molecules , taking into account both the vibrational and rotational degrees of freedom , and we reveal several interesting features in the absorption spectra .",
    "last section [ sec : summary ] summarizes our work .",
    "as pointed out in the previous section , the importance of collective effects manifested in recent experiments and theoretical papers calls for the development of self - consistent models capable of taking into account mutual em interaction in ensembles of quantum emitters .",
    "while direct numerical integration of corresponding maxwell - bloch equations can be based on either a strong coupled method @xcite or a weakly coupled one @xcite , for multi - level systems in two- and especially three - dimensions such a brute - force approach becomes numerically very expensive , both in terms of computation ( cpu ) times and memory requirements .",
    "indeed , the main disadvantage of such approaches is that both the cpu times and memory requirements scale generally at least as @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the dimension of the hilbert space of the system .",
    "this unfavorable scaling is directly related to the size of the reduced density matrix used to describe the system and to the associated number of time - dependent equations one has to solve to follow the system s dynamics . by contrast",
    ", one has only to solve a reduced set of @xmath1 time - dependent equations when the system can be described by a single wave function .",
    "it would therefore be extremely useful to be able to derive a `` schrdinger - type '' approximation which could describe on an equal footing the field - induced coherent dynamics of a multi - level quantum system and the associated relaxation and decoherence processes .",
    "this type of idea is not entirely new . for small excitations ,",
    "the time - dependent density functional theory @xcite allows for instance , in its real - time version , the extraction of density matrix dephasing without evolving the full density matrix .",
    "this goal has also been achieved in the past using different approaches , the three main contributions being the stochastic schrdinger method used in conjunction with a monte carlo integrator @xcite , the gadzuk jumping wave packet scheme @xcite and the variational wave packet method @xcite .",
    "these methods require the propagation of @xmath2 different wave functions and are therefore mainly attractive when @xmath3 .",
    "the approach we propose here is different since it is based on perturbation theory .",
    "it also significantly speeds up calculations since it only requires the propagation of a _ single _ wave function under the action of an easy - to - implement time - dependent effective hamiltonian in order to reproduce accurately the full dynamics .",
    "we demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of our method using , first , ensembles of two - level atoms , and then , interacting diatomic molecules including both the vibrational and rotational degrees of freedom . we also discuss the conditions under which our method is no longer valid .",
    "all results are compared with data obtained via direct integration of maxwell - bloch equations using a weakly coupled method @xcite .",
    "let us first consider a two - level quantum system interacting with em radiation .",
    "we label the two levels as @xmath4 and @xmath5 , with associated energy eigenvalues @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "the corresponding density matrix @xmath8 satisfies the dissipative liouville - von neumann equation @xcite @xmath9 -i\\hbar \\hat\\gamma \\hat\\rho\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is the total hamiltonian and @xmath11 is a superoperator , taken in the lindblad form @xcite , describing relaxation and dephasing processes under markov approximation .",
    "the field free hamiltonian reads @xmath12 the interaction of the two - level system with em radiation is taken in the form @xmath13 @xmath14 denotes here the instantaneous rabi frequency associated with the coupling between the quantum system and an external field . in eq.([eq : liouville ] ) , the non - diagonal elements of the operator @xmath11 include a pure dephasing rate @xmath15 , and the diagonal elements of this operator consist of the radiationless decay rate @xmath16 of the excited state . equations ( [ eq : liouville])-([eq : vi ] ) lead to the well - known bloch optical equations @xcite describing the quantum dynamics of a coupled two - level system    @xmath17\\rho_{01 } \\label{rho01}\\\\    \\dot{\\rho}_{10 } & = & i\\omega(t)\\left(\\rho_{11}-\\rho_{00}\\right ) - \\left[i\\omega_{\\!b } + \\frac{2\\gamma^*+\\gamma}{2}\\right]\\rho_{10 } \\label{rho10}\\\\    \\dot{\\rho}_{11 } & = & i\\omega(t)\\left(\\rho_{10}-\\rho_{01}\\right ) - \\gamma\\rho_{11 } \\label{rho11 }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath18 is the bohr transition frequency and where the dot denotes the time derivative .",
    "we assume in the following that the system is initially in the ground state @xmath4 , and we will show that , under some assumptions , the subsequent induced excitation and relaxation dynamics can be accurately described by a non - hermitian wave packet approximation .      within the aforementioned simplified model , the system s wave packet @xmath19 can be expanded as @xmath20 let us now assume that the ground and excited states energies include an imaginary part that we denote as @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively . inserting expansion([expansion ] ) into the time - dependent schrdinger equation @xmath23 and projecting it onto states @xmath4 and @xmath5 yields the following set of coupled equations for the coefficients @xmath24    @xmath25    we will now derive the differential equations describing the temporal dynamics of the products @xmath26 , where the subscript @xmath27 corresponds to this simplified non - hermitian schrdinger - type model .",
    "our goal is to obtain the gain and decay rates @xmath28 and @xmath29 which will allow for an approximate description of the system s excitation and relaxation dynamics .",
    "for the evolution of the populations @xmath30 and @xmath31 , one gets    @xmath32    the conservation of the total norm @xmath33 thus results in @xmath34 it therefore appears that , since the populations @xmath30 and @xmath31 are generally time dependent , _ at least one of the two rates _ @xmath28 _ or _",
    "@xmath29 , which are not yet fully defined , _ must be taken as a time - dependent function_.    taking eq.([norme ] ) into account , one finally obtains the following set of bloch equations for the approximate density matrix @xmath35    @xmath36\\!\\rho^s_{01 } \\label{rhos01}\\\\   \\dot{\\rho}^s_{10 } & = & i\\omega(t)(\\rho^s_{11}-\\rho^s_{00 } ) - \\!\\left [ i\\omega_{\\!b } + \\frac{\\gamma_1-\\gamma_0}{2 } \\right]\\!\\rho^s_{10 } \\label{rhos10}\\\\   \\dot{\\rho}^s_{11 } & = & i\\omega(t)\\left(\\rho^s_{10}-\\rho^s_{01}\\right ) - \\gamma_1\\,\\rho^s_{11 } \\label{rhos11}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    to be compared with the exact equations([rho00])-([rho11 ] ) .",
    "two obvious choices can then be made for the empirical gain and decay parameters @xmath28 and @xmath29 :    * the first choice @xmath37 allows to reproduce correctly the equations([rho00 ] ) and([rho11 ] ) describing the populations at the cost of degrading the description of the coherences @xmath38 and @xmath39 . *",
    "the second choice , @xmath40 , allows to reproduce correctly the equations([rho01 ] ) and([rho10 ] ) describing the coherences , at the cost of degrading the description of the populations .",
    "the optimal choice for applications in linear optics of nano - materials should be as follows : in weak fields , the variation of the populations , as described by perturbation theory , is a second order term with respect to the coupling amplitude while the variation of the coherences is a first order term . for a correct description of the quantum dynamics in weak fields ,",
    "it is important to describe first order terms accurately",
    ". therefore we proceed with the second choice @xmath41    from eqs.([norme ] ) and([coh ] ) we obtain a set of empirical time dependent gain and decay rates @xmath42 and @xmath43 that we can insert in the schrdinger - type approximation    @xmath44    we finally obtain the following set of time - dependent coupled equations    @xmath45    this system is solved numerically using a fourth order runge - kutta algorithm @xcite .",

    ", it might seem that the proposed formalism rather relies on a mathematical trick .",
    "it does however have physical insights .",
    "indeed , the time - dependent gain and decay rates , in some cases , have a deep physical meaning , as it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , for instance , where the non - hermitian formalism was applied to study em wave propagation in so - called pt - symmetric waveguides . in this study",
    ", it was shown that the gain and loss coefficients could be used to control the beat length parameter which describes waveguides . in our approach @xmath42 and @xmath43",
    "are gain and decay rates inherent to the studied quantum system since they only depend on the decay and dephasing rates @xmath16 and @xmath15 of this system and on the relative population of the quantum states involved . in the past ,",
    "such type of non - hermitian approaches have been proven to be very powerful tools in many branches of physics , including resonant phenomena , quantum mechanics , optics , and quantum field theory",
    ". a recent comprehensive survey of various applications of the non - hermitian approach can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "while our approximation is equally applicable to three - dimensional systems , we have chosen , for the sake of simplicity , to test it on a simplified one - dimensional system consisting of a uniform infinite layer of atoms whose thickness @xmath47 lies in the range of a few hundred nanometers .",

    "this model is a one - dimensional simplification of a more general approach used in ref .",
    "@xcite and we refer the reader to the body of this paper for details .",
    "the time - domain maxwell s equations for the dynamics of the electromagnetic fields    @xmath52    are solved using a generalized finite - difference time - domain technique where both the electric and magnetic fields are propagated in discretized time and space @xcite . in these equations ,",

    "a self - consistent model is based on the numerical integration of maxwell s equations([faraday ] ) and([ampere ] ) , coupled via eq.([polarization ] ) to the quantum dynamics . in the mean - field approximation employed here",
    "it is assumed that the density matrix of the ensemble is expressed as a product of density matrices of individual quantum emitters driven by a local em field . in order to account for dipole - dipole interactions within a single grid cell we follow @xcite and introduce lorentz - lorenz correction for a local electric field term into quantum dynamics according to @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the solution of maxwell s equations ( [ faraday ] ) ,",
