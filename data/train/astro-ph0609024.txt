    "many nearby galaxies show dramatically increased rates of star formation compared with the milky way . in such",
    "`` starburst '' galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the primary energy source is driven by high nuclear star formation rates , rapid nuclear gas depletion time - scales and high supernovae rates .",
    "such starburst systems often , though not exclusively , occur in interacting and colliding systems .",
    "since collisions and interactions are believed to be a fundamental part of the evolution of galaxies by hierarchical growth , the full characterization of starburst galaxies is of the great importance in measuring and quantifying the global history of star formation over cosmic time . determining the average mid - infrared ( mid - ir ) spectral properties , and the range of observed behavior within the starburst class at low redshift is vital for interpreting spectra of higher redshift ir sources , providing complementary spectral templates to those parallel spitzer studies of the more extreme ulirg systems ( e.g. , @xcite ) and agn ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the term `` starburst galaxy '' is commonly used to describe an apparently well - defined class of objects , although starbursts can be found in the most diverse conditions , ranging from low - pressure dwarf galaxies to high - pressure nuclear starbursts .",
    "their observed properties are expected to depend on numerous parameters such as the initial stellar mass function ( imf ) , the duration and epoch of the individual starburst(s ) , the metallicity of the ism , the size and distribution of the dust grains , the strength of the magnetic fields , gas pressure and temperature of the ism , galactic shear , total luminosity , and total mass .",
    "furthermore , nearby starbursts , for which high resolution imaging is possible , have revealed complex substructures  in both stellar distributions and ism  ranging from ultra - compact hii regions ( uchiir ) to large complexes of super star clusters ( ssc ) , suggesting small - scale variations of the observables across a starburst region .",
    "we use the low resolution mode of the infrared spectrograph ( _ irs _ ) @xcite on board the _ spitzer space telescope _ @xcite to observe the central regions of 22 starburst galaxies .",
    "our objects represent a sample of `` classical '' starbursts for which a wealth of literature exists .",
    "the sample includes both purely starburst and starbursts with weak agn activity ( as determined from x - ray , optical , or radio observations ) .",
    "the summary in table  [ tabgenprop ] lists the observed targets , their general properties , the classifications we adopt , and the references from which they are derived .",
    "the continuous @xmath9 m _ irs _ spectra include the silicate bands around @xmath10 m and @xmath11 m , a large number of pah emission features , and information on the slope of the spectral continuum .",

    ". the various steps of the data reduction followed a recipe that has been developed by the _ irs _ disks team and tested on a large amount of galactic and extragalactic spectra .",
    "we used the spectral modeling , analysis , and reduction tool ( smart ) version 5.5.1 . , developed by the _ irs _",
    "team @xcite to reduce and extract the spectra .",
    "first , we median - combined the images of the same order , same module and same nod position .",
    "then we differenced the two apertures to subtract the `` sky '' background , which is mainly from zodiacal light emission .",
    "we have done so by subtracting the spatially offset first and second order slits from each other : sl1 from sl2 and vice versa for the sl ( short wave , low resolution ) module , and ll1 from ll2 and vice versa for the ll ( long wave , low resolution ) module .",
    "we note that this approach assumes that the emission from the target is not farther extended than the angular distance between the two corresponding subslits of @xmath25 in sl .",
    "we extracted the spectra using a column width which increases  like the instrumental point - spread function ",
    "linearly with wavelength .",
    "the extraction width is set to four pixels at the central wavelength of each subslit .",
    "the spectra were flat - fielded and flux calibrated by multiplication with the relative spectral response function ( rsrf ) using the _ irs _ standard star @xmath26-lac for both low resolution modules .",
    "we built our rsrf by extracting the spectra of calibration stars @xcite in the same way as we perform on our sources , then divide the template spectra of those standard stars by the spectra we extracted with the column extraction method .",
    "finally , we multiplied the spectra of the science target by the rsrf , for each nod position .",
    "figure  [ figslitoverlays ] shows the positions of the narrower sl and wider ll slits for the given observing date overplotted on mid - ir images from irac , mips , and 2mass in logarithmic scale .",
    "our anticipated slit positions agree quite well with the main peak of the mid - ir emission , except for ngc  1097 , ngc  3310 , and ngc  3556 , which show a more complex morphology .",
    "the consequences of slight mismatches and extended emission are discussed in the following section .",
    "after the spectral extraction there was , in some cases , a noticeable mismatch between the spectra from the different _ irs _ modules .",
    "since this mismatch is more likely due to source flux that was missed in the narrower slits rather than _ unrelated _ flux that was picked up in the wider slits ( see below ) we scaled the sl2 , sl1 , and ll2 spectra to match the flux density of ll1 .",
    "the choice of ll1 as reference slit is appropriate because it has the widest slit and largest psf , and is least sensitive to pointing errors or a small spatial extent of the mid - ir emission region .",
    "we have also used the `` bonus orders '' sl3 and ll3 when they provided better overlap or higher signal - to - noise than first and second orders only .",
    "the applied stitching factors are listed in table  [ tabobsprop ] and provide a good idea of the uncertainties involved . since these factors are rather large in some cases we would like to emphasize the rationale for this approach .",
    "the problem of stitching together slit apertures of different widths is by no means specific to our approach , but applies to basically all comparable studies at almost all wavelengths . for a black - body - like object with extended , uniform surface brightness",
    "there will be a jump between the sl slit width ( @xmath15 ) to the ll slit @xmath17 , corresponding to an increase in flux of at least a factor of three . since all spectral energy distributions are continuous , scaling sl to match ll seems reasonable to first order .",
    "however , this approach assumes that the spectral properties are not changing within the region covered by the ll slit , corresponding to linear scales of about 200pc for the nearest objects in our sample  the typical size of a circum - nuclear starburst over which the spectral properties are assumed to not vary substantially .",
    "if the contributions from a centrally concentrated source , e.g. , an agn , were dominant , scaling would lead to an overestimation of the strength of the features originating in the center .    for the latter reason we have decided to list the flux densities as measured from the stitched spectra , but not to overall scale the _ irs _ spectra to match the spatially integrated _ iras _ flux densities at @xmath27 m . we have calculated the @xmath28 average of the _ irs _ spectra over the @xmath27 m _ iras _ filter band .",

    "@xmath27 m flux densities is given as the fractional flux ff in table  [ tabobsprop ] , last column .",
    "we note that color corrections applied to the published _ iras _ catalog fluxes increase the uncertainties , but the relative effect on our sample with similar seds is small . in some cases the ratio is quite small , indicating a rather large apparent discrepancy between _ irs _ and _",
    "iras_. this is mainly due to two reasons : ( _ i _ ) the galaxy extends over a large angle and the mid - ir emission region is significantly more extended than the _ irs _ slit ( e.g. , ngc  3628 , ngc  4945 ) , or ( _ ii _ ) the galaxy has significant off - nuclear ir emission peaks ( e.g. , ngc  3556 , ngc  4088 ) .    figure  [ figslitoverlays ] shows that substructure or extended emission on scales of the _ irs _ slit is present in many of our objects , most notably in those which have small fractional fluxes ` ff ' in table  [ tabobsprop ] .",
    "the most extreme cases are ngc  1097 , ngc  3556 , and ngc  4088 .",

    "crystalline silicates , causing the features at 16 and @xmath133 m in iras  08572 + 3915 , appear to be absent in the starburst template , although they are more difficult to discern at our spectral resolution given the presence of pah features and the [ siii ] line in that range .    while ngc  4945 shows by far the most extreme silicate absorption within our sample it is not an exotic object but defines the endpoint of a sequence of increasing optical depths .",

    "a trend that starbursts with stronger dust absorption show relatively weaker @xmath8 m pahs is evident .",
    "[ fig11pahextinction ] suggests that extinction can affect the relative pah strength in starbursts by up to a factor of about two .",
    "in the remainder of this subsection we will investigate if the pah equivalent width is related to the total infrared luminosity of the starburst .",
    "@xcite found a ratio of @xmath135 which is similar for starburst - dominated ulirgs and for template starbursts , i.e. , no dependency on @xmath5 .",

    "figure  [ figpahews ] shows the equivalent widths of both the @xmath6 m and @xmath7 m pah as a function of the total infrared luminosity for our starburst sample . within the uncertainties , indicated by the scatter between the @xmath6 m and @xmath7 m pahs for the same object ,",
    "the pah equivalent widths remain constant over a factor of 50 in total luminosity .",
    "this finding is in good agreement with @xcite ( and references therein ) who found that the fraction of the total pah flux emitted in the @xmath6 m pah band varies only slightly with an average of @xmath136 . in other words ,",

    "@xcite has shown that the @xmath137 m infrared luminosity @xmath5 of starbursts is a good measure of the star formation rate ( sfr ) given by @xmath138 = 4.5\\times 10^{-44 } l_{ir } [ \\mbox{erg\\ s}^{-1}].\\ ] ] the sfr determines the number of young , massive stars , which provide the ( far-)uv photons to excite both pah molecules and dust grains .",
    "if both species get excited by the same photons pahs could potentially be used as quantitative tracers of the sfr ( see section  [ secbrandllumi ] for the dust luminosity ) .    generally , pahs are considered the most efficient species for photoelectric heating @xcite in the pdrs . molecular gas in these boundary layers , surrounding the hii   regions , is exposed to far - uv radiation ( @xmath139ev ) , which strongly influences its chemical and thermal structure @xcite .",
    "pahs are stochastically heated by these uv photons , predominantly originating from massive stars , and hence expected to be good tracers of star formation . on large angular scales  similar to our case ",
    "@xcite found that the @xmath140 m pah emission constitutes an excellent indicator of the star formation rate in circumnuclear regions and starbursts as quantified by the lyman continum flux , i.e. in regions where the energy output is dominated by massive star formation .",
    "however , it has been known for a long time that pahs can also be excited by visible photons ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and that pahs can trace other sources besides massive young stars , such as planetary nebulae and reflection nebulae . if the observed pah flux is integrated over the whole galaxy it may predominantly trace b stars , which dominate the galactic stellar energy budget , rather than very recent massive star formation @xcite .",
    "this is in agreement with higher angular resolution observations of the @xmath141 m pah feature at the _ vlt _ by @xcite , who found a decrease in the pah / continuum ratio at the sites of the most recent star formation .    in section [ secpahmixture ]",
    "we have seen that the pah equivalent width does not dependent on @xmath5 . however , that does not necessarily mean that pahs are nt good quantitative tracers of star formation if the pah feature and the underlying continuum scale proportionally . in fig .",
    "[ figpahsfr ] we compare the flux in the @xmath6 m pah feature against the total infrared luminosity @xmath5 from _ iras_. to search for a physically meaningful correlation one needs to take the distance of the object into account as well as the fact that the narrow _ irs _ slit misses some of the total flux .",
    "hence we multiply the measured pah fluxes with the square of the distances and divide by the fractional flux factor ff ( table  [ tabobsprop ] ) .",

    "<S> we present @xmath0 m mid - infrared spectra at a spectral resolution of @xmath1 of a large sample of 22 starburst nuclei taken with the infrared spectrograph _ irs _ on board the spitzer space telescope . </S>",
    "<S> the spectra show a vast range in starburst seds . </S>",
    "<S> the silicate absorption ranges from essentially no absorption to heavily obscured systems with an optical depth of @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the spectral slopes can be used to discriminate between starburst and agn powered sources . </S>",
    "<S> the monochromatic continuum fluxes at @xmath3 m and @xmath4 m enable a remarkably accurate estimate of the total infrared luminosity of the starburst . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the pah equivalent width is independent of the total starburst luminosity @xmath5 as both continuum and pah feature scale proportionally . </S>",
    "<S> however , the luminosity of the @xmath6 m feature scales with @xmath5 and can be used to approximate the total infrared luminosity of the starburst . </S>",
    "<S> although our starburst sample covers about a factor of ten difference in the [ neiii]/[neii ] ratio , we found no systematic correlation between the radiation field hardness and the pah equivalent width or the @xmath7m/@xmath8 m pah ratio . </S>",
    "<S> these results are based on spatially integrated diagnostics over an entire starburst region , and local variations may be `` averaged out '' . </S>",
    "<S> it is presumably due to this effect that unresolved starburst nuclei with significantly different global properties appear spectrally as rather similar members of one class of objects . </S>"
