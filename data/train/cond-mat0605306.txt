    "quantum - critical behavior in two - dimensional ( 2d ) systems with continuous symmetry continues to attract substantial interest from the condensed - matter community . near criticality ,",
    "bosonic collective modes in either the spin or the charge channel ( depending on the problem ) are soft , and mutual feedback effects between bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom lead to a rather peculiar behavior of both the fermionic and bosonic propagators . in this paper",
    ", we study in detail this behavior for two - dimensional ( 2d ) systems .    for systems with continuous symmetry ,",
    "the dynamics of low - energy bosons is dominated by landau damping , and the collective mode propagator dressed by a particle - hole bubble behaves as @xmath6 at @xmath7 , the bosonic propagator becomes massless , signaling an instability towards a particular ordering .",
    "the dynamical exponent @xmath8 , which measures how the frequency scales with momentum at criticality ( @xmath9 ) , is @xmath10 .    physically , the complexity of the problem resides in the presence of gapless fermions at the qcp . in ordinary qcp in localized electron systems , one deals with only one type of massless modes , namely a bosonic mode associated with the fluctuations of the order parameter . in itinerant electron qcp ,",
    "massless bosonic modes interact with conduction electrons , which are gapless at the fermi surface , and this interaction affects both , electrons and bosons .",
    "one can still reduce the problem to interacting bosons by formally integrating the fermions out of the partition function .",
    "it was originally conjectured  @xcite that this leads to a conventional @xmath5 field theory with the bare propagator given by ( [ c_1 ] ) , i.e. , to a @xmath5 theory in an effective dimension @xmath11 .",
    "since @xmath10 , the bosonic sector is above its upper critical dimension for @xmath12 , and the critical exponents have mean - field values .    however , this description turns out to be oversimplified by two reasons .",
    "first , it does not address the issue of what happens to the fermions at the qcp .",
    "it turns out that for fermions , the upper critical dimension is @xmath13 , such that in @xmath14 the fermionic self - energy is singular and critically affects the behavior of low - energy fermions .",
    "second , the @xmath5 theory for bosons is actually rather peculiar as the prefactors for the @xmath5 and higher - other terms are determined by low - energy fermions , and are sensitive to to the behavior of these fermions near the qcp .",
    "these two arguments imply that at the qcp in itinerant electron systems , fermions and bosons should be considered self - consistently and on equal footing .",
    "the key theoretical challenge in this context is to develop a controlled computational scheme to describe the correct behavior of electrons interacting with gapless bosonic collective degrees of freedom .",
    "the problem of fermions interacting with bosons with the propagator ( [ c_1 ] ) at @xmath7 was previously analyzed in the context of 2d fermions interacting with a singular gauge field  @xcite , and was also applied to a gauge theory of high @xmath15 superconductors  @xcite , and compressible quantum hall effect  @xcite .",
    "later , this problem was studied in the context of 2d fermions near a ferromagnetic instability  @xcite , and , very recently , in the context of fermions near an instability towards a nematic - type ordering with angular momentum @xmath16  @xcite . that last transition was argued by some studies  @xcite to be relevant to the cuprates .",
    "similar problems have been studied in the context of finite momentum spin @xcite and charge @xcite ordering transitions in itinerant fermionic systems .",
    "an analytic treatment of the problem was originally carried out by altshuler , ioffe and millis ( aim )  @xcite for the interaction with the gauge - field .",
    "they showed that the fermionic self - energy scales as @xmath17 to second - order in perturbation , pointing to a breakdown of the fermi liquid behavior .",
    "they estimated higher - order terms and argued that the @xmath18 form of the self - energy survives to all orders in perturbation . on the other hand ,",
    "non - perturbative eikonal expansion  @xcite and closely related approach based on 2d bosonization  @xcite yielded a different behavior , in which the fermionic green s function decays exponentially with coordinate and time .",
    "this would be consistent with a divergent perturbative expansion for the self - energy .",
    "altshuler and collaborators argued that this last result only survives in the artificial limit of a vanishing number of fermionic flavors @xmath19 : at any finite @xmath2 ( including the physical case @xmath20 ) , the finite curvature of the fermionic dispersion prevents the perturbation series for the self - energy to become singular ( see also ref.@xcite ) .",
    "the discussion on the interplay between perturbative calculations and 2d bosonization re - emerged recently in the context of the quantum critical point for a pomeranchuk instability towards nematic ordering .",
    "metzner and collaborators  @xcite and , very recently , khveshchenko and one of us  @xcite argued that @xmath21 is the correct result at criticality , while lawler et al  @xcite argued , based on 2d bosonization , that non - perturbative effects change this behavior . adding to the controversy , kopietz  @xcite argued that higher - order corrections to the self - energy hold in powers of @xmath22 , where the geometrical series of logarithms gives rise to an extra power of frequency , such that @xmath23 .    in this paper , we re - analyze the problem .",
    "we consider a ferromagnetic qcp ( @xmath10 with spin su(2 ) symmetry ) , and a qcp towards nematic ordering , towards ising - type ferromagnetism , and a gauge - field problem  these three last problems are mathematically equivalent and correspond to @xmath10 and u(1 ) symmetry of the order parameter . we construct a controllable expansion at the qcp by creating a new , non fermi - liquid `` zero - order '' theory by solving the set of coupled equations for the fermionic and bosonic propagators , while neglecting the vertex corrections as well as the momentum dependence of the fermionic self - energy .",
    "this procedure is often called eliashberg theory because of its resemblance to the eliashberg theory for the electron - phonon interaction  @xcite .",
    "we analyze the residual interaction effects using the new zero - order propagator instead of free fermions .",
    "we confirm an earlier result of @xcite that the residual interaction does not change the functional behavior of the self - energy .",
    "we go beyond previous works and perform a careful analysis of the structure of the infra - red divergences in the theory .",
    "we analyze in detail the vertex corrections at various momenta and frequencies , the interplay between the migdal approximation and ward identities , the role of the curvature of the fermionic dispersion and the interplay between a direct perturbation theory for free fermions and an effective perturbation theory in which one expands around the eliashberg solution .",
    "we also obtain the leading correction to the fermionic density of states ( dos ) .",
    "a generic condition for the validity of the eliashberg theory is that bosons should be slow modes compared to fermions ( i.e. , for a fixed frequency , the bosonic momentum should be larger than the fermionic one ) .",
    "then fermions , forced by the interaction to vibrate at frequencies near the bosonic pole , are far from their own resonance and thus have a small spectral weight , giving rise to only a small correction to electron - boson vertex ( migdal theorem ) .",
    "typical bosonic momenta in eq .",
    "( [ c_1 ] ) scale as @xmath24 and are obviously slower than free fermions whose momenta scale as @xmath25 .",
    "the situation becomes less clear once the fermionic self - energy is included .",
    "we show that the correction to the static fermion - boson vertex is determined by frequencies at which the fermionic self - energy is of order of a bare @xmath25 , and the static vertex correction is small , for a fermion - boson coupling smaller than the fermionic bandwidth .",
    "this coincides with the generic condition for the validity of the low - energy description since otherwise the physics is not restricted to the vicinity of the fermi surface .",
    "this generic condition , however , is not a sufficient one at the qcp of spatially isotropic systems  we show that there are corrections to the eliashberg theory which come from the scattering process in which one component of the bosonic momentum is near the bosonic mass shell , while the other is near the fermionic mass shell .",
    "we find that such corrections are dangerous if the expansion around the eliashberg solution holds in powers of terms of order one . the same expansion around free fermions yields terms which formally diverge as powers of @xmath26 if one neglects the curvature of the fermi surface  @xcite .",
    "we show , in agreement with @xcite , that in this situation , the way to construct a fully controllable perturbation expansion around the eliashberg theory at the qcp is to either assume that the curvature of the fermi surface is large , or extend the theory to a large number of fermionic flavors , @xmath2 . in this case , the self - energy diagrams with vertex insertions are all small , and the theory is under control .",
    "we emphasize that this smallness does not imply that the theory is in the weak coupling limit  the eliashberg self - energy ( given by the one - loop diagram ) does nt `` feel '' the curvature and diverges as @xmath18 leading to non - fermi liquid physics at the qcp .",
    "another exception is the pairing vertex , which does nt feel the curvature as well , and is of order one .    in the second part of the paper",
    "we show that there exists a third singular scattering process in which both fermionic and bosonic momenta vibrate near the fermionic mass - shell .",
    "this third process is qualitatively different from the first two scattering processes in which at least one component of the bosonic momentum is near the bosonic mass shell .",
    "we show that this process ( which by virtue of scattering near the fermionic mass shell is within the eliashberg theory ) gives rise to a non - analytic momentum expansion of the static vertex .",
    "we show that for a ferromagnetic @xmath3 symmetric qcp , this non - analyticity eventually gives rise to a non - analytic and negative correction to the static spin susceptibility .",
    "this correction exceeds the @xmath27 term in ( [ c_1 ] ) and makes a ferromagnetic qcp unstable .",
    "the issue of whether the qcp is internally stable has been the subject of numerous discussions in the recent literature .",
    "this work was pioneered by belitz , kirkpatrick and vojta  @xcite who found that in a generic 3d fermi liquid far from the qcp , the static spin susceptibility @xmath28 has a negative non - analytic momentum dependence , leading to a minimum of @xmath29 located at some incommensurate momentum , rather than at @xmath30 .",
    "the same result was later obtained for 2d systems  @xcite .",
    "if one were to formally extend the fermi liquid results to the quantum critical region , one would obtain that the continuous qcp becomes unstable  @xcite .",
    "it was a priori unclear , however , whether this extension procedure is justified , since the fermi liquid behavior does not seem to survive as one approaches the qcp .    to address this issue",
    "we explicitly compute the static spin susceptibility at criticality , and show that it is negative and non - analytic at the smallest momenta .",
    "this implies that a ferromagnetic qcp is indeed unstable , as the fermi liquid analysis suggests .",
    "we argue that the non - analyticity in @xmath28 is associated with the landau damping term , which gives rise to an effective long - range dynamic interaction between quasiparticles both away from , and at the qcp .",
    "the singular fermionic self - energy at criticality only modifies , in not a very essential way , the functional form of the non - analyticity compared to that in a fermi liquid .",
    "we also discuss the emergence of the non - analytic term in the static spin susceptibility in the framework of the hertz - millis - moriya ( hmm ) @xmath5 theory of quantum - criticality  @xcite . as we said above",
    ", this theory assumes that there exists a regular expansion of the effective action in powers of the order parameter field @xmath31 .",
    "we show that this is actually not the case , and the pre - factor of the @xmath5 term is non - analytic and depends on the ratio between typical momenta and frequencies .",
    "we show that this non - analyticity feeds back as a non - analytic @xmath32 correction of the quadratic term in @xmath31 .",
    "we study how the non - analyticity in @xmath28 affects the fermionic self - energy and show that it gives rise to self - energy terms larger that @xmath18 ( beginning at the three - loop order ) .",
    "the series of such terms eventually leads to a breakdown of the eliashberg theory for the fermionic self - energy at the energy scale related to the typical momentum scale at which @xmath28 becomes negative .",
    "we show that the non - analytic corrections to the bosonic propagator and the divergent corrections to the fermionic self - energy are specific to the su(2 ) spin symmetric case . for a nematic instability , as well as for a ferromagnetic instability in systems with ising symmetry the dangerous terms in the bosonic propagator and the fermionic self - energy cancel out , and",
    "the qcp is stable .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we discuss the model . in sec .",
    "iii we present a quick analysis of the self - energies , justifying all at once , the eliashberg - like treatment , and the need to include the curvature of the fermionic dispersion . in sec iv , we discuss the eliashberg theory near quantum criticality . in sec .",
    "v , we analyze in detail the conditions one has to impose in order for the eliashberg theory to be valid .",
    "this includes the computation of all vertex corrections , as well as the momentum - dependent self - energy at the two - loop level .",
    "we also compare the results obtained by strict perturbative expansion using free fermions , and the eliashberg - type calculations .    in sec .",
    "vi we address the issue of the stability of a ferromagnetic qcp .",
    "we revisit the scaling arguments that a ferromagnetic qcp must be stable in dimension @xmath33 and show that the prefactor for the @xmath5 term is actually a nonanalytic function of the ratio of frequency and momentum .",
    "we show that this non - analyticity feeds back as a non - analytic correction to the static spin susceptibility .",
    "we explicitly compute the momentum - dependent term in @xmath28 at the two - loop order , both in the fermi liquid regime away from a ferromagnetic qcp and at criticality . in both cases ,",
    "we find that the dominant term at small @xmath34 is negative and non - analytic .",
    "we also show that the instability of a ferromagnetic qcp can be also detected by computing the fermionic self - energy which at the three - loop order acquires extra singular terms because of the singularity in the static susceptibility . in sec .",
    "vii , we evaluate the charge susceptibility at two - loop and three - loop orders and show that it remains analytic  all non - analytic contributions from individual diagrams cancel out . finally , in sec .",
    "viii , we present our conclusions and discuss the consequences of the instability of a continuous qcp towards ferromagnetic ordering .",
    "technical details are presented in the appendices a - f .",
    "a short version addressing part of the results of section vi has been presented in  @xcite .",
    "the model we consider describes low - energy fermions interacting with landau - overdamped collective bosonic excitations which are either gapless by symmetry reasons ( as it is the case for the interaction with a gauge field ) , or become gapless at the quantum critical point ( for the nematic and the ferromagnetic problems )",
    ".    the underlying lattice models may be quite different for these three cases , but the low - energy models are very similar , the only difference being that in the case of the ferromagnetic qcp the gapless bosonic excitations are in the spin channel , whereas in the nematic case and the gauge field problem they are in the charge channel .",
    "the general strategy to derive the low - energy model is to start with a model with fermion - fermion interaction , assume that there is only one low - energy collective degree of freedom near the qcp , decouple the four - fermion interaction term using the critical bosonic field as an hubbard - stratonovich field , and integrate out of the partition function all high - energy degrees of freedom , with energies between the fermionic bandwidth @xmath35 and some cutoff @xmath36  @xcite .",
    "if this procedure was performed completely we would obtain a full renormalization group treatment of the problem .",
    "unfortunately , there is no controllable scheme to perform this procedure .",
    "it is widely believed , though that although the propagators of the remaining low - energy modes possess some memory of the physics at high energies , the integration of high - energy fermions does not give rise to anomalous dimensions for the bare fermionic and bosonic propagators in the low - energy model . in practical terms",
    ", this assumption implies that the bare propagator of the relevant collective mode is an analytic function of momentum and frequency , and the fermionic propagator has the fermi liquid form : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is a constant , and @xmath39 is the renormalized band dispersion .",
    "near the fermi surface , @xmath40 here @xmath41 is the momentum deviation from @xmath42 , the parallel and perpendicular components are with respect to the direction along the fermi surface at @xmath42 , @xmath0 is the band mass , the fermi velocity @xmath43 , and for a circular fermi surface one has @xmath44 .",
    "one can then re - cast the original model of fermion - fermion interaction into an effective low - energy fermion - boson model .",
    "consider for definiteness that the system is close to a ferromagnetic qcp .",
    "then the low - energy degrees of freedom are fermions ( with the propagator given by ( [ c_1_1 ] ) ) and long - wavelength collective spin excitations whose propagator ( the spin susceptibility ) is _ analytic _ near @xmath30 and @xmath45 : @xmath46 here @xmath47 is a constant , and @xmath48 is the correlation length , which becomes infinite at the qcp .",
    "we prove in the next section that the @xmath49 term does not play any role in our analysis , and we therefore neglect it from now and approximate the above bare propagator by the static one @xmath50 .",
    "the model can then be described by the phenomenological spin - fermion hamiltonian : @xmath51 here @xmath52 with @xmath53 are vector bosonic variables , and @xmath54 is the effective fermion - boson interaction . for convenience",
