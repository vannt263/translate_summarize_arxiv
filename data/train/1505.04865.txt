    "despite a long history of physics of the high-@xmath1 cuprate,@xcite we are still some way from a full understanding of the superconductivity .",
    "there is a general consensus that the supercurrent flows on each cu - o plane , which can be modeled by the repulsive hubbard model on the square lattice .",
    "there are actually two essential factors here : the repulsive hubbard interaction can give rise to a pairing interaction in the @xmath0-wave channel mediated by antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations,@xcite while the very same interaction also introduces mott s metal - insulator transition@xcite that hinders the superconductivity around half - filling for strong enough interactions . capturing these two features simultaneously",
    "still remains a theoretically challenging task .",
    "as numerical methods for treating the strongly correlated electron systems , there are the exact diagonalization and quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) methods @xcite that are exact within numerical errors , but the former can only deal with limited system sizes , while the latter suffers from the sign problem .",
    "however , we do have theoretical methods that can deal with each of the @xmath0-wave pairing and mott s transition separately : namely , we have on one hand the fluctuation - exchange ( flex ) approximation,@xcite one of the perturbative methods for many - body physics that can describe the spin - fluctuation mediated @xmath0-wave pairing . on the other hand , we have the dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft),@xcite which can describe the mott transition . to be more precise",
    ", the flex describes the momentum dependence of the effective pairing interaction mediated by the antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations , which is essential for the anisotropic pairing,@xcite but the method , being perturbative , can not describe the mott transition in the regime close to the half - filling .",
    "the dmft , although mean - field theoretic , describes mott s insulator in terms of the ( non - perturbative ) correlation effect that is local ( i.e. , momentum - independent ) but dynamical ( i.e. , incorporating temporal fluctuations ) , and becomes exact in the limit of infinite spatial dimensions of a lattice model.@xcite    there are many extensions of dmft to include momentum dependence of the self - energy.@xcite one is the cluster extension of dmft,@xcite which is employed , e.g. , for explaining the pseudogap in the cuprates as a momentum - selective mott transition.@xcite however , in practice it is quite hard in this scheme to attain large cluster sizes and to incorporate spatially long - ranged components in the self - energy in a strongly correlated regime .",
    "it is also computationally very demanding to treat the @xmath0-wave superconducting phase , or to extend to more complicated models such as multi - orbital systems with a large cluster size retained in the cluster dmft .",
    "more realistically , we have alternative and numerically feasible extensions of dmft that combines dmft with a certain resummation technique of nonlocal self - energy diagrams , such as gw+(e)dmft,@xcite d@xmath2a,@xcite and the dual - fermion approach.@xcite these schemes can treat momentum - dependent self - energies describing nonlocal long - range correlations with some selected diagrams taken into account .",
    "this has motivated us to take the flex+dmft method,@xcite where nonlocal flex diagrams are considered on top of dmft local diagrams for the self - energy .",
    "we have opted for a method that evokes flex among other diagrammatic methods , since we are interested in the @xmath0-wave superconductivity mediated by antiferromagnetic fluctuations , which can be explicitly treated with flex .    in the present paper ,",
    "we extend the flex+dmft method to deal with the @xmath0-wave superconductivity in the two - dimensional repulsive hubbard model , while a flex+dmft has been applied to the normal phases of the hubbard model in ref .  .",
    "to this end , we construct the luttinger - ward functional for flex+dmft , where double counting of local diagrams from flex and dmft parts is unambiguously subtracted . starting from the luttinger - ward functional formalism guarantees the conserved nature of dmft ( as well as flex ) retained , which is not always the case with other diagrammatic extensions of dmft .",
    "we then apply this flex+dmft to the @xmath0-wave superconductivity in the two - dimensional repulsive hubbard model to obtain the superconducting phase diagram .",
    "we find that the flex+dmft result exhibits a @xmath1-dome structure of the superconducting phase diagram against band filling , which has not been observed in flex alone .",
    "we identify the origin of the dome to the local vertex correction from dmft that renders a filling dependence in the flex self - energy .",
    "to elaborate this point , we compare this with the gw+dmft method , in which only bubble diagrams are used to extend dmft in considering a nonlocal self - energy correction , whereas both bubbles and ladders are included in flex+dmft .",
    "the gw+dmft result also exhibits a @xmath1-dome structure , but , unlike the flex+dmft result , @xmath1 in gw+dmft is always below the nel temperature , i.e. , the antiferromagnetic order dominates over @xmath0-wave superconductivity for the whole filling range .",
    "we have also obtained the single - particle spectral function with the flex+dmft , which exhibits a double - peak structure above @xmath1 with a precursor of the hubbard bands .",
    "while the present scheme does not consider vertex corrections to the nonlocal ladder diagrams unlike the dual - fermion approach which is recently applied@xcite to the superconductivity in the hubbard model , an advantage of the present method is that we define the luttinger - ward framework , which enables us to treat the normal self - energy and the anomalous ( @xmath0-wave ) self - energy on an equal footing as derivatives of the same luttinger - ward functional .",
    "let us formulate the flex+dmft method by introducing a luttinger - ward functional @xmath3,@xcite which basically consists of flex and dmft diagrams .",
    "however , there is a double counting of local self - energy diagrams between the two contributions , which must be subtracted .",
    "we show that the double counting term is uniquely identified if one demands the conserving nature of the formalism .",
    "namely , we regard each of dmft and flex as an approximation for the exact luttinger - ward functional of the dressed green s function @xmath4 to propose a new functional , in a manner similar to the gw+(e)dmft scheme.@xcite in dmft , the approximate functional , @xmath5 , is the sum of all types of the ring diagrams that only contain the local green s function @xmath6 . on the other hand , the approximate functional in flex , @xmath7 ,",
    "is the sum of specific ( bubble and ladder ) diagrams as shown in fig .",
    "1(a ) , which basically correspond to spin and charge fluctuations .",
    "then we can propose a functional in the flex+ dmft scheme as @xmath8 = \\phi_{\\rm{dmft}}[g_{\\rm loc}]+\\phi_{\\rm flex}[g]-\\phi_{\\rm flex}^{\\rm local}[g_{\\rm loc}],\\ ] ] where we have subtracted the local part of the flex functional @xmath9 $ ] with @xmath10 ( @xmath11 : number of @xmath12 points ) to avoid the double counting .",
    "since both @xmath5 and @xmath7 are expressed as functionals of dressed green s functions , the overlap between the two is uniquely determined as a set of diagrams in the @xmath13 $ ] that _ only _ contain local dressed green s functions , which is nothing but @xmath9 $ ] .",

    "the local self - energy @xmath24 is calculated in the dmft part of the self - consistency loop .",
    "the nonlocal part of the self - energy @xmath18 is then calculated in the flex loop .",
    "we combine both @xmath24 and @xmath18 to obtain the full self - energy , from which we construct new ( full and local ) green s functions .",

    "incorporates the functionals that dominate in either limit , it is expected to describe spin fluctuation effects and mott s physics simultaneously .",

    "we have confirmed for various values of parameters that the continuous - time quantum monte carlo impurity solver @xcite implemented with the alps library@xcite gives similar values for the eigenvalue of eliashberg s equation even away from the half - filling .",

    "we show the superconducting phase diagram of the two - dimensional hubbard model obtained in the flex+dmft in fig .  3 , right panels , where the flex result is also displayed in the left panels for comparison .",
    "we can immediately see that @xmath1 exhibits a dome structure in the flex+dmft .",
    "this sharply contrasts with the flex result , where @xmath1 has been known to almost monotonically increase toward half - filling with some rounding off.@xcite the presence of the @xmath1 dome in the flex+dmft and its absence in the flex are seen for both the simple square lattice with @xmath67 [ fig .",

    "3(b ) ] .    for the simple square lattice ( @xmath67 )",
    ", we can not approach a region very close to half - filling because the antiferromagnetic ( af ) fluctuations prevent the flex self - consistency loop from converging . for the same reason , it is difficult to attain convergence for systems with larger @xmath29 . as a measure of the af order",

    "the result suggests that a part of the @xmath1 dome is taken over by the af phase in the case of @xmath71 [ fig .",

    "now let us identify the physical origin of the appearance of the @xmath1 dome in the flex+dmft . in flex+dmft",
    ", the self - energy is obtained from the flex and dmft self - energies as @xmath84 [ eqs .",
    "( [ selfenergy ] ) and ( [ nonlocal - selfenergy ] ) ] , i.e. , a part of the local self - energy is replaced from that in flex with that in dmft .",
    "thus the quantity @xmath85 represents the difference in the self - energy effect between flex and flex+dmft .",
    "we can actually take a look at @xmath86 and @xmath24 , with fillings @xmath87 ( underdoped ) , @xmath77 ( optimally doped ) , and @xmath78 ( half - filled ) in fig .  4 [",
    "the parameters are taken to be @xmath88 , which corresponds to fig .",
    "3(b ) , right panel ] .",
    "we first notice that the magnitude of the dmft self - energy @xmath24 is smaller than that of flex @xmath89 , which means that the overestimation of the self - energy generally known to exist in flex is remedied in flex+dmft by the dmft ( local ) vertex corrections .",
    "more importantly , we can see that the difference , @xmath90 [ fig .",
    "4(b ) ] , has a clear filling dependence , and it increases with doping . since @xmath84 , the result indicates that the reduction of the flex+dmft self - energy due to dmft correction is reduced as one approaches half - filling .",
    "thus @xmath1 tends to be suppressed near half - filling as compared to that of flex because of the _ filling - dependent self - energy reduction _ in flex+dmft .",
    "on the other hand , the pairing interaction itself arising from spin fluctuations becomes stronger toward half - filling due to better band nesting , as reflected in the flex result [ fig .  3 , left panels ] with @xmath1 almost monotonically increasing toward half - filling .",
    "therefore , the flex+dmft contains two factors with opposite filling dependencies , and we conclude that the @xmath1 dome in flex+dmft arises from the _ combined effect _ of the nesting and filling - dependent self - energy reduction .     and band filling @xmath91 in gw+dmft approximation ( right ) as compared with that in gw approximation ( left ) for @xmath80 ( green squares ) or @xmath92 ( red circles ) .",

    "here we take @xmath95 , @xmath83 .",
    "we also plot antiferromagnetic ( af ) phase boundaries ( dotted lines ) in the normal region , while color shading highlights the dome in the region where @xmath1 is above the af boundary . ]    in the flex+dmft scheme , the self - energy reduction from dmft takes place only in the local part , while the nonlocal self - energy is still considered to be overestimated , especially for ladder diagrams.@xcite to examine this effect , we compare the present method with gw+dmft , where only the bubble diagrams are considered for the self - energy and the pairing interaction ( whereas both bubbles and ladders are included in flex and flex+dmft ) .",
    "we show the gw+dmft phase diagram , along with the gw result for comparison , in fig .  5 for @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "we can see that , although the @xmath1 dome structure remains in the gw+dmft result , @xmath1 is much reduced from the result of flex+dmft . on the other hand ,",
    "the af transition temperature is much higher in gw+dmft than that of flex+dmft .",
    "this makes the region in the dome where @xmath74 [ highlighted with color shadings in fig .",
    "5(a ) ] very narrow in gw+dmft .",
    "in fact , for @xmath67 the af instability becomes so strong that we can not even obtain superconducting phase boundaries for the whole region of the fillings considered .    in fig .",
    "5(b ) , we display the gw local self - energy @xmath93 as compared with the dmft self - energy @xmath75 for the filling @xmath98 with @xmath99 and @xmath94 .",
    "we can see that the filling dependence is similar to those in the flex+dmft in that the difference between the two self - energies increases with the doping .",
    "hence we can conclude that the existence of the @xmath1 dome is not an artifact in flex+dmft , but is robust in both flex+dmft and gw+dmft arising due to the same local vertex correction effect .",
    "the overestimation of nonlocal self - energy thus does not affect the existence of the @xmath1 dome itself .",
    "the reason that the magnitude of @xmath1 is much smaller in gw+dmft than in flex+dmft is because ladder diagrams describing spin fluctuations are not taken into account in gw+dmft . in this sense , gw+dmft is closer to the mean - field theory than flex+dmft , which is also reflected in the higher af transition temperature in gw+dmft .",
    "concomitantly , the pairing interaction mediated by spin fluctuations is reduced , which acts to reduce the superconducting @xmath1 in gw+dmft rather than in flex+dmft .",
    "the fact that @xmath1 is always estimated below the nel temperature in gw+dmft suggests that gw+dmft underestimates the spin fluctuation effect , and is not enough to describe the @xmath0-wave superconductivity mediated by spin fluctuations .",
    "since the overestimated nonlocal self - energy in flex+dmft is remedied in gw+dmft , the accurate estimation of the spin - fluctuation effect is expected to lie between gw+dmft and flex+dmft .    to see the strength of local correlation",
    ", we measure the double occupancy , @xmath100 we can see in fig .  6",
    "that the double occupancy becomes negative in the overdoped regime in flex , while this unphysical behavior is improved in flex+dmft .",
    "we can regard this as another of the self - energy reduction effects : flex overestimates the correlation effect , while this is corrected by combining it with the dmft . a similar tendency is observed between gw and gw+dmft , but the difference in the double occupancy is smaller",
    "this should be because the self - energy reduction effect is smaller [ see figs .",
    "4(a ) and  5(b ) ] .     in the flex+dmft ( red circles ) , dmft ( green crosses ) , flex ( blue squares ) , gw+dmft ( light blue diamonds ) , and gw ( purple triangles ) . here we take @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and @xmath83 . ]",
    "let us finally examine the spectral function , which is calculated via analytical continuation with the pad approximation .",
    "the results for flex+dmft , flex , gw , gw+dmft , and dmft at various fillings are shown in fig .  7 .",
    "we can see that the filling dependence is similar among flex , gw , and dmft in that we have a single peak that slightly shifts and broadens as we approach the half - filling .",
    "by contrast , in the method that combines dmft with either flex or gw , the spectral function acquires a stronger filling dependence , where a marked double peak is observed at half - filling .",
    "similar double - peak structures have been reported in the dual - fermion method@xcite as an antiferromagnetic pseudogap , where the appearance of the double peak is consistent with the qmc result .",
    "thus we can see that the interplay of the local and nonlocal long - range correlation effects in flex+dmft and gw+dmft gives the double peak , which is considered to be a precursor of the hubbard bands with two peaks separated by about @xmath29 , while the system is metallic .",

    "we take @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and @xmath83 . ]",
    "if we look more closely at the momentum - resolved spectral function @xmath101 , we observe that there is a region in @xmath12 space near the fermi energy where the spectral weight becomes slightly negative",
    ". this might not be specific to the present method , since many extensions of dmft do not guarantee positive - definite spectral weights.@xcite since the magnitude of the negative part is negligibly small ( @xmath102 ) in the present case and this tends to occur in the overdoped regime , this does not affect the phase diagram and the density of states [ figs .  3 and 7 ] in the underdoped regime .",
    "we have employed the flex+dmft approach in terms of a new luttinger - ward functional to study the superconductivity in correlated electron systems .",
    "this scheme is a diagrammatic extension of the dmft , so that it can describe the @xmath0-wave superconductivity arising from @xmath12-dependent pairing interaction .",
    "the scheme , being formulated in terms of the luttinger - ward functional , also has a virtue of the normal and anomalous self - energies treated on an equal footing .",
    "we have applied the flex+dmft to the repulsive hubbard model on the square lattice .",
    "we have found that flex+dmft describes a @xmath1 dome structure , whose physical origin is traced back to a combination of opposite effects : the self - energy effect introduced in the flex+dmft suppresses the superconductivity more strongly toward the half - filling due to the local - correlation effect , while spin fluctuations become stronger toward the half - filling due to band nesting .",
    "we also compare the flex+dmft result with the gw+dmft result , which reproduces the dome structure .",
    "this indicates that the dome is not an artifact of the overestimated nonlocal self - energy in flex+dmft .",
    "another observation is that there is a pomeranchuk instability into electronic states with broken tetragonal symmetry in the case of @xmath103 in both flex+dmft and gw+dmft . in this case ,",
    "solutions with the four - fold rotationally symmetric fermi surface become unstable , where we end up with a solution that breaks this symmetry when we start the calculation from an asymmetric initial input . while this instability is interesting in its own right , we have concentrated on the symmetric case in this study , and leave the analysis of the pomeranchuk instability to another publication .    in order to improve the scheme to suppress the overestimation of the nonlocal flex self - energy , we should consider the screening effect in the flex self - energy .",
    "for example , the two - particle self - consistent method @xcite takes account of vertex correction effects by considering the sum rule for the susceptibility , while a similar technique is also used to reduce the overestimated spin fluctuations and their effect on the self - energy in d@xmath2a.@xcite we expect these techniques bring some improvement to the present theory .",

    "<S> the dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) combined with the fluctuation exchange ( flex ) method , namely flex+dmft , is an approach for correlated electron systems to incorporate both local and nonlocal long - range correlations in a self - consistent manner . </S>",
    "<S> we formulate flex+dmft in a systematic way starting from a luttinger - ward functional , and apply it to study the @xmath0-wave superconductivity in the two - dimensional repulsive hubbard model . the critical temperature ( @xmath1 ) curve obtained in the flex+dmft </S>",
    "<S> exhibits a dome structure as a function of the filling , which has not been clearly observed in the flex approach alone . </S>",
    "<S> we trace back the origin of the dome to the local vertex correction from dmft that renders a filling dependence in the flex self - energy . </S>",
    "<S> we compare the results with those of gw+dmft , where the @xmath1-dome structure is qualitatively reproduced due to the same vertex correction effect , but a crucial difference from flex+dmft is that @xmath1 is always estimated below the nel temperature in gw+dmft . the single - particle spectral function obtained with flex+dmft exhibits a double - peak structure as a precursor of the hubbard bands at temperatures above @xmath1 . </S>"
