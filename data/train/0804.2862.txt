    "it is well known that stable nuclei are located , in the @xmath4-@xmath2 plane ( where @xmath4 and @xmath2 are the total number of neutrons and protons respectively ) , in a region that , for small values of @xmath2 , is almost a line well described by the relation @xmath5 . + in the past",
    ", several efforts have been made to explain theoretically this property , for example with the liquid drop model of atoms , that is based on two properties common to all nuclei : their mass densities and their binding energies for nucleons are almost indipendent from the mass number @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "this model takes into account the strong nuclear force and the coulombian repulsion between protons and explains different properties of nuclei , for example the relation between @xmath2 and @xmath1 ( the charge to mass ratio ) .",
