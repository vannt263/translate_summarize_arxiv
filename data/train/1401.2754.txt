    "the aim of this paper is to model the propagation of an electromagnetic field into an active optical waveguide .",
    "k. yee in 1966@xcite presents the initial algorithm based on the finite difference time domain method ( fdtd ) used to discretize maxwell s equations . in time and space so that it is suited to calculate the propagation of an electromagnetic field into dielectric media . in the past two decades , as computers have become more and more powerful , the fdtd method has met a growing success and has been extended to model antennas , periodic structures , dielectric materials exhibiting non linear dispersion _",
    "etc_. @xcite .",
    "one of the improvements to the basic fdtd method was to account for active dielectric materials which can absorb or emit the electromagnetic field .",
    "this improvement has been made by coupling maxwell s equations to auxiliary differential eqations ( ade ) describing the polarization densities linked to the authorized transitions and electronic level populations .",
    "for many years , rare earth ions have been used in silica - based optical amplifiers such as erbium doped fibre amplifier ( edfa)@xcite . in these systems , the low gain value requires to employ significant length ( 10 to 15 @xmath3 ) of doped fiber to achieve a workable power operation . in more compact system such as erbium - doped waveguide amplifier ( edwa ) a higher gain has to be reach in order to shorten the operating length of the amplifier @xcite .",
    "one limiting factor of the gain is the low absorption cross section @xmath4 of rare earth ions . in order to increase this @xmath4 ,",
    "absorption sensitizers have been used such as ytterbium , semiconductor nanograins , metallic ions or organic complexes@xcite .",
    "several studies have pointed out that silicon nanograins are efficient sensitizers and can increase by a factor of @xmath5 the effective absorption cross section of rare earth ions @xcite .",
    "erbium ( er@xmath2 ) has been the first rare earth studied due to the emission wavelength of 1.5 @xmath6 , adapted to the telecommunications window in optical fibers@xcite . however , there are three major gain limiting factors for the erbium ions : up - conversion , the excited state absorption and the re - absorption of the signal from the fundamental level .",
    "this last drawback is characteristic of a three levels system .",
    "more recently , neodymium ion has been proposed instead of erbium ion since its four levels configuration prevent signal re - absorption from the fundamental level .",
    "our goal is to model the propagation of an electromagnetic field into a waveguide with a layer containing absorbing and emitting centers as for example @xmath7 ions and silicon nanograins .",
    "more particularly , we want to determine the system characteristics as fields , level populations , and gain in a steady state regime as a function of initial parameters such as concentration of emitting center , geometry , pumping configuration and pump and signal powers .",
    "moreover , to model those steady states regime in a waveguide with a layer containing absorbing and emitting centers , we must take into account the time evolution of electromagnetic field and electronic levels populations of absorbing / emitting centers . in a waveguide containing silicon nanograins and neodymium ions ,",
    "the typical lifetime of the electronic levels is about some @xmath0 , whereas the characteristic period of the electromagnetic field is of the order of @xmath1 .",
    "the choice of a common time step to treat such different time scales would require prohibitively long computation times ( about @xmath8 iterations ) .",
    "one possible solution to overcome this multi - scale times issue was proposed in 2011@xcite , by applying the so - called time scaling method which consists in multiplying the population rate differential equations by a scaling factor ( @xmath9 ) so that the convergence of levels population is accelerated . despite the number of required time iterations that has been reduced by @xmath10 order of magnitude",
    ", this technique does not sufficiently decrease the computation time and may lead to numerical instabilities for higher scaling factors .    in section [ oldalg ] , we present the classical ade - fdtd method and show that , within a reasonable computation time , the steady state of the system can not be reached with such a difference between absorbing and emitting centers lifetimes and electromagnetic field period . consequently , in section [ newalg ] , we propose a new algorithm based on the ade - fdtd method which allows to compute the electromagnetic field distribution , the gain , and the electronic levels populations in the waveguide in the steady state regime .",
    "finally , we show in section [ results ] the results of a calculation performed on a waveguide composed of silicon rich silicon oxide ( srso ) matrix containing silicon nanograins and neodymium ions .",
    "the fdtd is based on time and space discretization scheme of maxwell equations proposed by yee @xcite which allows to calculate the propagation of electromagnetic field ( @xmath11,@xmath12 ) in time domain@xcite .",
    "the ade method consists in the use of extra terms such as current density @xmath13 or polarization density @xmath14 which are solutions of a differential equation with the aim to model some non linear optical behavior such as dispersive or gain media@xcite .",
    "the fields @xmath11 , @xmath12 are treated by maxwell equations rewritten as following : @xmath15    where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are respectively the static permittivity and magnetic permeability .",
    "@xmath18 is the usual electrical conductivity and @xmath19 is a fictitious magnetic resistivity used for boundary conditions of the calculation box .",
    "berenger s perflectly matched layers ( pml)@xcite have been implemented as boundary conditions .",
    "both @xmath18 and @xmath19 have been chosen so that pml boundary conditions can minimize electromagnetic reflection and maximize absorption .",
    "@xmath20 is the sum of all polarizations corresponding to each transition of the absorbing / emitting centers ( hereafter : silicon nanograins and rare earth ions ) .",
    "the use of one polarization density @xmath21 per optical transition between levels @xmath22 and @xmath23 allows the description of the global dynamic permittivity @xmath24 of the matrix arising from the dipole moment densities induced by optical transitions in emitting centers .",

    "@xmath36 defined in @xcite depends on the transition lifetime @xmath37 and on the optical index @xmath38 : @xmath39    from eq .",
    "( [ polarisation ] ) and the stability conditions in lorentz media obtained by p. g. petropoulos @xcite another numerical stability condition appears : @xmath40    finally , the time evolution of the electronic level populations @xmath41 is modelled by usual rate equations .",

    "is @xcite : @xmath44    the term @xmath45 ( in @xmath46 ) is the induced radiation rate ( resp",
    ". excitation rate ) if it is negative ( resp . positive ) .",
    "the terms n@xmath47 ( i=1,2 ) ( in @xmath48 ) are the population densities of different atomic levels , and @xmath49corresponds to the lifetime of spontaneous emission from the level 2 to the level 1 . in principle , eqs .",
    "( [ equations maxwell ] ) , ( [ polarisation ] ) and ( [ population ] ) must be solved simultaneously .",
    "as explained above , in the visible and near infrared spectra the electromagnetic field has a characteristic time of the order of @xmath50 .",
    "furthermore , the excited levels have characteristic lifetimes as long as a few @xmath0@xcite . accordingly , due to the time step imposed by the ade - fdtd method lower than @xmath51@xcite , the number of iteration must be as huge as @xmath8 in order to reach the steady states of the levels populations .",
    "so , a conventional calculation with the classical ade - fdtd method where the equations of populations are calculated at the same time of the electromagnetic field is impossible in reasonable time .",
    "in order to reduce the computational time , we developed a new algorithm based on the ade - fdtd method diagrammed in fig .",
    "[ algorithm ] . the choice of the linewidth @xmath34",
    ", its link to the absorption cross section of emitting center and its consequence on the calculation duration will also be discussed .",

    "( [ equations maxwell ] ) , ( [ polarisation ] ) and ( [ population ] ) into two sets of equations , solved one after the other : ( i ) the electromagnetic field and polarization eqs .",
    "( [ equations maxwell ] ) and ( [ polarisation ] ) and ( ii ) calculation of steady state populations ( eq [ population ] ) . by analyzing the time evolution of volumic density of photon @xmath53 obtained with classical ade - fdtd method , we notice that @xmath54 is a `` quickly variable '' function with a `` slowly variable '' envelope which reaches a stationary value after @xmath55 iterations .",
    "moreover , it has been noticed that the time evolution of populations @xmath56 , in eq .",
    "( [ population ] ) , is governed by the `` slowly variable '' evolution of the volumic density of photon @xmath57 envelope .",
    "based on these two observations , we propose a new ade - fdtd algorithm divided in short and long time loops :    * in the short time loop , electromagnetic fields and polarizations are calculated eqs .",

    "this latter follows the temporal evolution of the `` slowly variable '' envelope of @xmath60 .",
