    "controlling chemical reactions with electromagnetic fields has long been a sought - after goal of researchers",
    ". external field control of chemical reactions will not only allow chemists to selectively produce desired species , but also reveal mechanisms of chemical reactions , yield information on interactions determining chemical reactions and elucidate the role of non - adiabatic and relativistic effects in chemical dynamics .",
    "possible applications of controlled chemistry range from quantum computation with molecules , to fundamental tests of reaction rate theories , to studies of fine details of molecular structure or intermolecular interaction potentials . external fields",
    "may influence molecular collisions when the translational energy of the molecules is smaller than the perturbation due to interactions with external fields .",
    "moderate magnetic and electric fields available in the laboratory shift molecular energy levels by up to a few kelvin so external field control of molecular dynamics in the gas phase is most easily achieved at temperatures near or less than one kelvin @xcite .",
    "a variety of methods have been developed in the past seven years to create molecules at temperatures between @xmath0 and @xmath1 k ( cold molecules ) and at temperatures between @xmath2 and @xmath0 k ( ultracold molecules ) .",
    "the experimental techniques for the production of cold and ultracold molecules have been described in a recent review by doyle and coworkers @xcite .",
    "table 1 lists the coldest molecules produced in laboratory studies to date .",
    "ultracold molecules are characterized by unusual scattering properties .",
    "the orbital angular momentum of the colliding molecules is asymptotically zero @xcite and the collision dynamics is determined by wigner s threshold laws @xcite at such low temperatures .",
    "cross sections for inelastic scattering and chemical reactions rise to infinity as the collision energy vanishes so that reaction rate constants are independent of temperature and they can be quite large in the limit of zero kelvin .",
    "collisions of ultracold molecules are extremely sensitive to intermolecular interaction potentials and relative energies of the initial and final scattering states .",
    "a slight variation of the molecular structure due to an applied external field may , therefore , dramatically change the outcome of an inelastic collision or chemical reaction of ultracold molecules .",
    "the purpose of this article is to review the current state of the art in the field of ultracold molecules and demonstrate that dynamics of ultracold molecules can be manipulated with external electric or magnetic fields .",
    "i will show that external field control of molecular dynamics can be based on several principles .",
    "zeeman and stark effects may remove some of the energetically allowed reaction paths or they may open closed reaction channels , leading to suppression or enhancement of the reaction efficiency @xcite .",
    "external fields couple the states of different total angular momenta , so that forbidden electronic transitions may become allowed in an external field and the transition rate may be controlled by the field strength @xcite .",
    "the rate of low temperature abstraction reactions may be dramatically enhanced by the presence of a resonance state near threshold @xcite . by shifting molecular energy levels with external fields ,",
    "it should be possible to bring an excited bound level of the reactive complex in resonance with the collision energy . finally , external fields may influence statistical properties of ultracold molecular gases such as diffusion .",
    "this introduction is followed by a brief discussion of wigner s threshold laws and methods for the production of cold and ultracold molecules .",
    "a particular accent is made on the possibility of the creation of ultracold molecules in other than @xmath3-symmetry electronic states and magnetic trapping of atoms in states of non - zero electronic orbital angular momenta .",
    "quantum mechanical theory of molecular dynamics in external fields is outlined in the next section and mechanisms for external field control of molecular dynamics are described in the final section before conclusions . in preparing this paper , i made an effort to avoid overlap with previous recent reviews @xcite .",
    "in particular , the editorial review of doyle  @xcite described the experimental work with cold and ultracold molecules so the present discussion is primarily about recent theoretical work .",
    "wigner @xcite showed that elastic scattering ( @xmath4 ) and reaction ( @xmath5 ) cross sections vary in the limit of vanishing collision velocity ( @xmath6 ) as @xmath7    where @xmath8 is the angular momentum for orbital motion of the colliding molecules about each other .",
    "( [ elastic_crosssection ] ) and ( [ reaction_crosssection ] ) are valid for systems with short - range interactions .",
    "long - range intermolecular interactions may modify the threshold laws ( see , e.g. , the review of sadeghpour  @xcite ) .",
    "it follows from the wigner expressions that both the elastic scattering and chemical reactions are dominated by collisions with @xmath9 at ultracold temperatures .",
    "the elastic cross section is thus independent of the collision energy and the reaction cross section is inversely proportional to the velocity , rising to infinity as @xmath10 .",
    "( [ reaction_crosssection ] ) with @xmath9 is valid for inelastic collisions or chemical reactions providing the intermolecular interaction potential decreases with intermolecular separation @xmath11 faster than @xmath12 in the long range .",
    "a simple derivation of the expressions ( [ elastic_crosssection ] ) and ( [ reaction_crosssection ] ) was given by landau and lifshitz @xcite .",
    "the reaction rate constant is obtained from the energy dependence of the reaction cross section as follows @xmath13    where @xmath14 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath15 is the reduced mass of the reacting molecules , @xmath16 is the temperature and @xmath17 . replacing @xmath5 by @xmath18 in eq .",
    "( [ rate ] ) yields @xmath19    the reaction rate constant is thus independent of temperature and finite in the limit @xmath20  k. following the analysis of landau and lifshitz @xcite and mott and massey @xcite , balakrishnan  @xcite and bohn and julienne @xcite showed that it is most convenient to express the zero temperature reaction rate in terms of the imaginary part of the scattering length related to off - diagonal elements of the scattering @xmath21-matrix .",
    "several recent calculations of ro - vibrational relaxation in atom - molecule collisions @xcite , non - adiabatic electronic relaxation in atom - atom and atom - molecule collisions @xcite and reactive scattering @xcite showed that rate constants for inelastic energy transfer and chemical reactions have significant magnitudes at zero kelvin .",

    "the rate constant for this reaction was calculated to be as large as @xmath26 @xmath27 sec@xmath28 at zero kelvin .",
    "soldn  @xcite and cvita  @xcite showed that chemical reactions without activation barriers ( insertion reactions ) are even more efficient at ultralow energies .",
    "the results of their extensive calculations based on a hyperspherical coordinate representation of the wave function yielded the zero temperature rate constant @xmath29 @xmath27 sec@xmath28 for the na + na@xmath30 reaction and @xmath31 @xmath27 sec@xmath28 for the @xmath32li + @xmath33li@xmath32li@xmath34 reaction .",
    "an experiment on cooling atoms to ultracold temperatures includes two stages : trapping and evaporative cooling of trapped atoms @xcite .",
    "atoms are precooled by laser cooling and captured in a magneto - optical or purely magnetic trap @xcite .",
    "trapping isolates the atomic cloud from the thermal environment .",
    "the magnetic trap is a superposition of magnetic fields that creates a minimum of the magnetic field potential at the center of the experimental cell .",
    "magnetic traps confine atoms in zeeman states with a positive gradient of energy with respect to the field strength ( low - field seeking states ) .",
    "the potential energy of atoms in low - field seeking states varies in a magnetic trap as shown by the full line in fig .",
    "it is essential for a trapping experiment that atoms remain in the low - field seeking state upon collisions .",
    "if the orientation of atomic magnetic moments with respect to the magnetic field axis is changed , the trapped atoms relax to a high - field seeking state whose potential energy varies in the trap as shown by the broken line in fig .",
    "1 . atoms in high - field seeking states are not trappable .",
    "the density of trapped atoms is largest near the center of the trap , where the translational temperature of the atomic cloud is lowest .",
    "collisional relaxation to high - field seeking states , therefore , removes the coldest atoms and leads to heating .",
    "the evaporative cooling is a repetitive process of driving most energetic atoms out of the trap and re - equilibrating the kinetic energy of the remaining atoms .",
    "the evaporative cooling is an integral part of any experiment with ultracold atoms and it rests on the efficiency of energy transport in elastic collisions .",
    "laser cooling is applicable to a limited number of specific atoms .",
    "an alternative and more general method of trapping atoms relies on buffer - gas loading @xcite .",
    "hot atoms are introduced into a cell of cold buffer gas , usually @xmath35he , and cooled by elastic collisions with the buffer gas atoms .",
    "when the temperature of the atoms becomes less than 1 k , they can be trapped in a large - gradient magnetic trap .",
    "the buffer gas can then be pumped out and the trapped atoms can be cooled to ultralow temperatures by evaporative cooling @xcite .",
    "laser cooling can not be applied to molecules ( see , however , the work of di rosa @xcite ) . a variety of alternative methods have been developed to precool and trap molecules .",
    "an incomplete list includes buffer - gas loading @xcite , stark deceleration @xcite , skimming @xcite , mechanical slowing @xcite and crossed - beam collision @xcite .",
    "trapped molecules can be evaporatively cooled to ultralow temperatures .",
    "in addition , ultracold molecules can be created by linking ultracold atoms together as in photoassociation or through feshbach resonances ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the photoassociation and feshbach resonance methods produce ultracold molecules directly so they do not depend on the evaporative cooling of molecules which may be difficult to implement . the review of doyle and coworkers @xcite presents a more comprehensive discussion and references of methods for the production of ultracold molecules .",
    "the stability of molecules in a magnetic trap was studied by several authors @xcite .",
    "bohn and coworkers demonstrated that molecules without electronic orbital angular momenta ( @xmath3-state molecules ) tend to preserve the orientation of the magnetic moment in a magnetic field @xcite .",
    "krems and coworkers showed that the zeeman relaxation in rotationally ground - state molecules without electronic orbital angular momenta is mediated by coupling to rotationally excited molecular states @xcite .",
    "collisional trap loss is therefore sensitive to the rotational constant of trapped molecules and krems and dalgarno concluded that only @xmath3-state molecules with _",
    "rotational constants are amenable to evaporative cooling in a magnetic trap @xcite .",
    "a recent experiment of maussang  confirmed these predictions @xcite .",
    "the interaction potential anisotropy in molecule - molecule collisions is larger than that in collisions of molecules with he atoms .",
    "it should be expected that collisional spin depolarization will be more efficient in molecule - molecule collisions relevant for evaporative cooling experiments and the possibility of buffer - gas loading of molecules in a magnetic trap does not guarantee the possibility of evaporative cooling of molecules .",
    "however , krems and dalgarno pointed out that the mechanism of trap loss in molecule - molecule collisions is the same as in atom - molecule collisions , providing weak magnetic dipole interactions can be neglected @xcite .",
    "the basic result that @xmath3-state molecules with larger rotational constants will be more stable in magnetic traps , therefore , applies to evaporative cooling experiments as well .",
    "the quantitative question of whether the evaporative cooling of molecules is going to be possible in a magnetic trap remains open .",
    "molecules with dipole moments can potentially be trapped in electrostatic traps .",
    "however , bohn found that collisional relaxation of molecules from low - electric - field - seeking to high - electric - field - seeking states precludes the electrostatic trapping @xcite .",
    "bohn recommended that magnetic fields should be used for trapping polar paramagnetic molecules .",
    "proposals exist @xcite to cool molecules to extremely low temperatures by collisions with ultracold trapped alkali metal atoms ( sympathetic cooling ) .",
    "soldn and hutson explored the possibility of cooling nh molecules by collisions with ultracold rb atoms @xcite .",
    "they found that cooling may be complicated by non - adiabatic dynamics involving ion - pair states and leading to dramatic enhancement of the interaction strength .",

    "cvita  computed the vibrational relaxation efficiency in collisions of li with li@xmath23 for both bosonic and fermionic atoms @xcite .",
    "the authors found that the rate constants for vibrational relaxation of li@xmath23 in the lowest three vibrationally excited levels are similar for bosonic and fermionic atoms so the quenching rates are not suppressed in strongly bound molecules composed of fermionic atoms .",
    "ultracold collisions are very sensitive to intermolecular interaction potentials ; in particular , soldn  @xcite demonstrated that three - body non - additive forces between spin - polarized alkali atoms are crucial for dynamics of alkali atom - alkali molecule reactions .",
    "an important question yet to be answered is whether the accuracy of modern quantum chemistry methods is sufficient for a realistic _ ab initio _ description of molecular dynamics at ultracold temperatures .",
    "the emphasis of several recent experiments was on the creation of ultracold polar molecules .",
    "the work of bergeman  @xcite on the creation of translationally , electronically , vibrationally and rotationally cold rbcs molecules and the work of wang  @xcite on the photoassociative molecule formation and trapping of krb molecules are two most recent examples of the progress in this direction .",

    "high precision spectroscopy measurements of non-@xmath3-state molecules possible at ultracold temperatures may allow for tests of fundamental symmetries of the nature and help in searches for the time variation of fundamental constants .",
    "trapping and cooling non-@xmath3-state molecules to ultracold temperatures thus presents a particular interest .",
    "avdeenkov and bohn @xcite and groenenboom @xcite found that evaporative cooling of non-@xmath3-state molecules in a magnetic trap will unlikely be possible due to large collisional losses .",
    "alternatively , ultracold non-@xmath3-state molecules can be created by photoassociation of atoms with non - zero electronic orbital angular momenta .",
    "however , all atoms cooled to ultracold temperatures in a magnetic trap so far were in electronic @xmath21-states and the electronic ground state of molecules produced by photoassociation of @xmath21-state atoms is always of @xmath3 symmetry .",
    "an important question is thus `` can atoms with non - zero electronic orbital angular momenta ( non-@xmath21-state atoms ) be magnetically trapped and evaporatively cooled to ultracold temperatures ? ''",
    "an interaction of two atoms with non - zero electronic orbital angular momenta gives rise to several adiabatic potentials with different symmetries . for example , the interaction of two oxygen atoms in the ground @xmath36 state is described by 18 interaction potentials corresponding to different spin multiplicity , parity and spatial symmetry of the o@xmath23 molecular states @xcite .",
    "a simpler complex of o(@xmath36 ) with he(@xmath37 ) is described by two interaction potentials of @xmath3 and @xmath38 symmetries @xcite .",

    "as follows from the results of ref .",
    "@xcite , the anisotropic coefficients @xmath49 can all be expressed in terms of differences between the adiabatic potentials of the diatomic molecule .",
    "for example , the electronic interaction anisotropy in the o(@xmath36 )  he complex is determined by the splitting of the @xmath3 and @xmath38 interaction potentials at finite interatomic distances - the result obtained much earlier by aquilanti and grossi @xcite .",
    "the stability of atoms in a magnetic trap is determined by the degree of the electronic interaction anisotropy in atomic collisions .",

    "( [ theexpansion ] ) .    to understand the prospects for buffer - gas loading and evaporative cooling of non-@xmath21-state atoms , krems and dalgarno carried out rigorous quantum mechanical calculations of rate constants for elastic scattering and zeeman relaxation in collisions of oxygen atoms in the @xmath36 state with @xmath35he atoms @xcite .",
    "it was found that the probability of elastic he - o(@xmath36 ) collisions is only six times larger than the probability of zeeman relaxation at the temperature @xmath1 k and magnetic field @xmath1 tesla .",
    "the buffer - gas loading and evaporative cooling experiments are possible when the elastic scattering rate exceeds the rate for trap loss by , at least , one thousand .",
    "the results of krems and dalgarno thus indicated that buffer - gas loading and evaporative cooling of non-@xmath21-state atoms like oxygen would be impossible .",
    "kokoouline  @xcite arrived at the same conclusion in their numerical study of sr(@xmath36 ) - sr(@xmath36 ) collisions .",
    "hancox and coworkers @xcite and krems and coworkers @xcite have recently reported a combined experimental and theoretical study of the electronic interaction anisotropy in collisions of transition metal atoms sc and ti with @xmath35he .",
    "it was found that the interaction anisotropy in complexes of sc(@xmath50 ) and ti(@xmath51 ) with he is dramatically suppressed due to the presence of paired spherically - symmetric electrons in the outer electronic shell of the transition metal atoms .",

    "interactions between transition metal atoms or rare - earth atoms are more complex than those between transition metal atoms and he . the work outlined above rules out the possibility of evaporative cooling of main - group non-@xmath21-state atoms like oxygen or strontium in a magnetic trap , but provides only an indication that the evaporative cooling of non-@xmath21-state transition metal and rare - earth atoms may be possible .",
    "it should be expected , however , that interactions between transition metal atoms and @xmath21-state alkali metal atoms in a magnetic trap will be similar to those between transition metal atoms and he and the results of hancox   and krems  suggest the possibility of sympathetic cooling of the non-@xmath21-state atoms by collisions with trapped alkali metal atoms to ultracold temperatures .",

    "external magnetic fields couple the @xmath106 and @xmath107 states of carbon so the cross section for the fine structure relaxation varies as @xmath103 in the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "figure 7 shows the zero temperature rate constant for this forbidden electronic transition as a function of the external magnetic field .",
    "avdeenkov  @xcite showed that polar molecules may form long - range complexes in the presence of dc electric fields .",
    "the complexes are bound in long - range potential wells arising due to avoided crossings of electronic states with repulsive and attractive interactions in the long range .",
    "electric fields shift the asymptotic energy of the colliding molecules and move the position of the avoided crossings .",
    "thus , electric fields can be used to control the binding energy of the long range complexes and collision properties of ultracold polar molecules .",
    "the authors argued that the long - range field - linked states may prevent molecules from approaching to short intermolecular distances where different electronic states are strongly coupled and inelastic relaxation and chemical reactions leading to trap loss are inevitably efficient .",
    "inelastic collisions and chemical reactions can then be activated by switching off the field .    bodo  @xcite computed",
    "the rate for the f + h@xmath23 @xmath24 hf + h chemical reaction as a function of the mass of the hydrogen atoms .",
    "increasing the mass of h@xmath23 pushes the least bound level in the entrance reaction channel to above the dissociation threshold and the calculations mimic the chemical reaction near a feshbach resonance . figure 8 shows that the zero temperature reaction rate increases to a great extent near the resonance . if the reactants and products of a chemical reaction are separated by an activation energy , the chemical reaction occurs at low temperature by tunneling under the potential barrier .",
    "most abstraction chemical reactions have activation barriers and the f + h@xmath23 @xmath24 hf + h reaction is a typical example of an abstraction reaction with an activation barrier . if the reactants are trapped in a resonance state near the potential barrier , the collision complex lives longer and the tunneling probability is enhanced .",
    "feshbach resonances can be induced by external electric or magnetic fields .",
    "so the calculation of bodo  suggests that abstraction chemical reactions can be induced by tuning feshbach resonances with external fields .",
    "ticknor and bohn @xcite considered the effects of electric and magnetic fields on collisions of oh(@xmath108 ) molecules .",
    "they found that inelastic relaxation of electric - low - field seeking states can be suppressed by magnetic fields .",
    "the authors showed that an applied magnetic field may counteract some couplings responsible for the stark relaxation and separate the energies of the initial and final scattering channels .",
    "magnetic fields of a few thousand gauss were found to be sufficient to suppress the inelastic relaxation by two orders of magnitude .",
    "avdeenkov and bohn @xcite had earlier shown that collisionally induced inelastic relaxation of electrostatically trapped polar molecules is very efficient , especially at high electric fields .",
    "the results of ticknor and bohn are , therefore , particularly important as they suggest that the trap loss collisions may be mitigated by properly chosen magnetic fields .",
    "the field of cold molecules is expanding very quickly . starting from the experiment on magnetic trapping of cah molecules @xcite , it now encompasses the work of more than 50 research groups worldwide .",
    "the interest to cold and ultracold molecules is shared by atomic , molecular and condensed - matter physicists , quantum optics physicists , physical chemists and spectroscopists .",
    "why such an interdisciplinary interest ?",

    "selectivity of chemical reactions and branching ratios of photodissociation may be greatly enhanced in a molecular bose - einstein condensate due to collective dynamics of condensed molecules .",
    "selection rules are more strict and propensities for near - resonant energy transfer in molecular collisions or chemical reactions are more pronounced at ultracold temperatures @xcite .",
    "collisional relaxation of ultracold molecules may , therefore , be used for the creation of molecules with inverse rotational distributions and molecular lasers .    as described in this paper ,",
    "inelastic collisions , chemical reactions and dissociation of cold and ultracold molecules can be manipulated with external electric and magnetic fields .",
    "external field control of molecular dynamics at subkelvin temperatures is an alternative to coherent control methods developed and used in various areas of chemistry @xcite .",
    "coherent control of bimolecular processes is complicated by the need to entangle internal molecular states with the center - of - mass motion and it will be much easier to implement coherent control schemes with stationary ultracold molecules .    external field control of molecular dynamics at ultracold temperatures will allow for studies of fine details of molecular structure .",
    "ultracold collisions probe the long range of intermolecular potentials and measurements of ultracold dynamics will provide detailed information about weak intermolecular interaction forces .",
    "experiments with ultracold molecules will test the applicability limits of conventional molecular dynamics theories .",
    "for example , the boltzmann equation may not be valid in the ultracold temperature regime as it does not account for quantum effects in molecular interactions .",
    "new theories may need to be developed for the proper description of molecular dynamics at temperatures near absolute zero .    despite the constantly growing number of research groups working with ultracold molecules , the field of ultracold molecules remains",
