    "\\(i ) except for the strong - coupling case and for the low - density case , the filling in the ground state is as follows : in an open shell , with less - than - half filling , each new electron is added with one and the same spin , so that the total spin ( in the shell under consideration ) is maximal in accordance with hund s rule @xcite .",
