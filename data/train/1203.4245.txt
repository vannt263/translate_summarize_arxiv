    "the solids have a large number of variants of crystallographic structures and violations of these structures with such defects as vacancies , dislocations , grain boundaries etc . under different severe external influences , such as radiation , severe plastic deformation and others they change the internal crystallographic and defect structures . to describe the changes the techniques of the theory of phase transitions is used , where the concept of order parameter or internal state variable is introduced .",
    "the rudiments of the concept of internal state variable were offered yet duhem in 1903 @xcite ( see also more detailed review in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in 1928",
    "the idea was reanimated by herzfeld and rice for the account of internal structure evolution of polyatomic gas when they studied the dispersion and attenuation of sound @xcite .",
    "it got development in other numerous researches of that time @xcite . supplemented with elements of rational mechanics , the concept took a completed and closed form in the works by coleman and gurtin @xcite . in the modern science , the line is developed too @xcite . in the works by landau",
    "the concept was developed anew , through introducing the internal state variable in the form of the order parameter , the theory of phase transitions was built by him at a high - quality level @xcite .",
    "the landau approach has resulted in further development in the theories of the phase fields @xcite .",
    "in addition , the mesoscopic non - equilibrium thermodynamics approach was developing to fit the description of soft matter @xcite .",
    "studies of the problem gave birth to a plenty of variants of kinetic equations , describing the evolution of internal structure during non - equilibrium processes within the framework of different approaches ( see @xcite and review there ) .",
    "earlier , an alternative approach of non - equilibrium evolutional thermodynamics ( neet ) proposed to describe the processes in solids with structural defects @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite the problem was subdivided into thermal and structural parts . in the first part",
    ", the molecular dynamics simulation was used to represent a thermo - motion as a  superposition  of equilibrium and non - equilibrium contributions .",
    "the non - equilibrium constituent was the acoustic emission , arising from dynamic transition phenomena at a moment of defect ( dislocations ) formation .",
    "the acoustic emission has not been considered such context before .",
    "there it was considered not only as an attenuating wave process as a consequence of both scatter on internal heterogeneities and nonlinear pumping to other frequency regions of the spectrum , but as a part of thermodynamic process of the internal energy transformation .",
    "the resulting were kinetic ( evolution ) equations for the production of  non - equilibrium entropy  and its sinking into an equilibrium thermal subsystem .    the structural part was demonstrated on the example of a solid with vacancies , and the evolution equations were deduced in terms of the internal energy . in ref .",
    "@xcite this part was justified with the attraction of the elements of statistical physics , namely , the probability distribution function ( pdf ) .",
    "there are two levels of rigor in the description of non - equilibrium processes . at the first level the pdf , which does not change in time",
    "maxima of this function determine the equilibrium ( most probability ) states and the system tends to one of them starting from an arbitrary non - equilibrium one .",
    "the second level takes into account the possibility of probability evolution in time ( kinetic equations of boltzmann , fokker - plank etc ) .",
    "but already at first level of rigor one can obtain new additional relationships .",
    "there are few approaches to description of the melting of solids .",
    "the most simple is based on the lindemann criterion , which determines a melting - point by the amplitude of thermal vibrations .",
    "that is , when the amplitude becomes of the order of 10 percent of interatomic distance , the crystal lattice loses stability and collapses ( melts ) @xcite .",
    "this approach is not , however , universal type and for different crystals of bcc- , fcc- and hcp - type , the lindemann constant is different . in addition , the lindemann theory is one - phase , it does not determine the free energy for the liquid state @xcite .",
    "the second approach is based on the mechanical born criterion of stability , a solid melts when the shear modulus becomes zero @xcite .",
    "however , the born model is also one - phase theory which does not contain direct description of the liquid phase .",
    "the third approach , issuing from frenkel and eyring works , is based on order - disorder transitions with the participation of vacancies @xcite . unlike the former approaches this theory is biphase , however , up to now the discontinuous nature of transition between the solid and liquid state was not taken into account .    in this paper , within the framework of the developed neet approach the vacancy theory of the melting of solids taking into account its discontinuous nature",
    "is considered . in part",
    "ii , formulation of neet is given for a solid with vacancies and interstitial atoms .",
    "for a homogeneous problem the pdf is obtained and a new form of kinetic equations symmetric in view of the use of free and internal energy is deduced .",
    "in the same part the vacancy theory of the melting of metals is considered from positions of frenkel s concept . in part",
    "iii , the discussion of the obtained results is given .",
    "the problem of the shear modulus tending to zero during transition to liquid media is discussed .",
    "part v contains the summarizing conclusions .",
    "the expressions for the thermodynamic probability @xmath0 and the configurational entropy @xmath1 assuming the maximal degeneration of the microstates were obtained by boltzmann for a solid with vacancies @xcite @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a total number of atoms in the crystal , @xmath4 is a number of vacancies , @xmath5 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "note that the configurational entropy @xmath1 is a one - valued function of the number of vacancies and it does not depend on their energy ( and on temperature as well ) .    the expression for the thermodynamic probability @xmath6 and the configurational entropy @xmath7 for interstitial atoms can be quite similarly written down for the maximal degeneration in microstates @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a total number of equilibrium positions for interstitial atoms in a crystal ( local minima of the potential energy ) , @xmath10 is number of interstitial atoms . for different symmetries of crystals",
    "the number of such positions can be different and multiple to @xmath3 .",
    "note that the configurational entropy @xmath7 is also a one - valued function of the number of interstitial atoms , which does not also depend on the energy of interstitial atoms and temperature .",
    "provided that the microstates of vacancies and interstitial atoms are statistically independent , the total thermodynamic probability @xmath11 of the microstates is @xmath12 and the total configurational entropy @xmath13 equals to the sum of entropies of subsystems @xmath14    total probability of the state containing @xmath4 vacancies and @xmath10 interstitial atoms will contain a limiting exponential multiplier , probability of gibbs for this microscopic state @xcite @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the normalizing statistical sum , @xmath17 is the internal energy taking into account the existence of vacancies and interstitial atoms , @xmath18 is the temperature . in conditions of the total degeneration",
    "the internal energy is a linear function of the defect number @xcite @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the internal energy with no contribution of defects taken into account , @xmath21 , @xmath22 are average energies of a vacancy and an interstitial atom , which in this case are constant values for all possible configurations of atoms of the system .",
    "the condition of total degeneration is practically exactly satisfied for the low numbers ( concentrations ) of vacancies and interstitial atoms , when the interaction between defects can be neglected . at the same time",
    ", this condition is not fulfilled for those configurations for which vacancies are close to each other or merge at all ( bi - vacancies , triple vacancies , vacancy pores ) and at a high vacancy concentration .",
    "the same refers to the interstitial atoms as well . in these cases",
    "it is necessary to take into account the removal of condition of total degeneracy due to the interaction of point defects .",
    "as known , the coupling interaction reduces the total energy of a system that reduces the effect of action of the limiting exponential multiplier in eq .",
    "[ b3 ] and results in a possible appearance of long - living configurations , which , thus , can compete with more numerous configurations of higher energy .",
    "the probability distribution function with total ( internal ) energy @xmath23 is @xcite @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the distribution of states in energy @xmath23 or the number of microstates ( configurations ) with energy @xmath23 , @xmath16 is the statsum over all energy states of the system @xmath26    the states are numbered in the order of energy growth @xmath27 .",
    "distribution @xmath25 depends on the number of vacancies and interstitial atoms , and on their ratio , as well as on symmetry of their location ( ordering ) . on this account , it is impossible to fix one - to - one correspondence between internal energy and number or concentration of defects .",
    "finding of function @xmath25 is a hard combination problem , determination of power spectrum of @xmath23 as a set of acceptable energies for @xmath28 state , is also a stubborn problem .",
    "however , such one - to - one correspondence can be obtained for the average value of internal energy @xmath29 over all of the states for the fixed number of vacancies @xmath4 and interstitial atoms @xmath10 . using expression for pdf ( [ b6 ] ) , it is possible to write down @xmath30    here , unlike the case of eq .",
    "( [ b8 ] ) , the internal energy is not the linear function of @xmath4 and @xmath10 , but is the function of general type .",
    "the increase of fraction of the symmetric low - energy states diminishes the average value of the internal energy .",
    "the transition to the states , where high - concentration vacancies and interstitial atoms can pass to higher - energy extended ( and mobiler ) states @xcite , results in internal energy growth . to reflect all the properties of the internal energy it is presented in the form of a polynomial with alternating signs @xmath31",
    "the first sum describes a contribution from every subsystem of point defects separately ; the second one describes a contribution from the interaction between vacancies and interstitial atoms .",
    "sign `` minus '' at the second sum is because the interaction between vacancies and interstitial atoms is , on the whole , of the attracting nature . ignoring the degeneracy within one set of the states with the same number of vacancies @xmath4 and the number of interstitial atoms @xmath10 , for such average internal energy we can write down the  effective  probability distribution function in the form of eq .",

    ", we have an equilibrium coexistence of solid and liquid phases of the matter . for a still greater increase of temperature",

    "the transition from the solid state to liquid one is a jump - like first - order phase transition . in order to talk about the transition just to the liquid state ( not for example to the amorphous state ) , we need not only the high concentration of vacancies , but also the shear modulus of material going to zero .",
    "this issue will be discussed in the next part in detail .",
    "influence of the interstitial atoms can be qualitatively estimated understanding that they have higher energy as compared to vacancies , and therefore in the equilibrium state have more low concentration .",
    "as , with ( [ b13 ] ) and ( [ b17 ] ) , the sign `` minus '' is at the constant @xmath54 , then , due to cross effects , this results in diminishing of the energy of vacancy @xmath42 , and to some displacement of the roots of the equation ( [ b14 ] ) to the region of a higher number ( concentration ) of vacancies . for the case of interstitial atoms to be directly participating in the processes of melting the equation ( [ b15 ] ) should have one more solution . as their energy is higher",
    ", their material curve will be considerably higher than that for vacancies .",
    "consequently , while the equation ( [ b14 ] ) has two solutions , the equation ( [ b15 ] ) has only one solution , and the interstitial atoms will not directly and independently participate in the processes of melting , but will only modify the participation of vacancies a little .",

    "it , as well as other thermodynamic potentials for other conditions , possessed extreme properties as opposed to internal non - equilibrium processes . for imperfect solids , in particular solids with vacancies , according to the hypothesis of boltzmann , the free ( configurational ) energy was introduced by analogy @xmath56 where configurational entropy @xmath1 is set by eqs ( [ b1 ] ) , ( [ b2 ] ) .",
    "properties of thermodynamics potential were also attributed to this ( configurational ) free energy , and it possesses the property of minimality as to a variation of concentration of structural defects .",
    "it is easy to see that this property issues from the fact that the free energy , in a logarithmic scale and with an opposite sign , coincides within a constant with pdf ( [ b7 ] ) @xmath57 and as a consequence the minima of the free energy automatically coincide with the maxima of pdf ( compare curves 1 and 2 of fig .",
    "4 ) , which determine the most probable , that is , equilibrium states . in other words ,",
    "the free energy @xmath58 is a quantity reciprocal to pdf , expressed in energy units on a logarithmic scale",
    ".    energies @xmath59 and @xmath58 to some extent similar have important principal distinctions .",
    "namely , it is known that the internal and free energies , related by the legendre transformations , depend on the arguments of its own @xmath60 , @xmath61 , we name them symbolically the eigen - arguments of these potentials .",
    "this property and the respective differential relationships , allow to interpret these energies as thermodynamics potentials . if we compare the energy of vacancy @xmath42 to the temperature @xmath18 , then in this context",
    ", it is necessary to confront the number of vacancies @xmath4 with entropy @xmath36 .",
    "it would seem the configurational free energy @xmath58 must be a function of vacancy energy @xmath42 , however , from relationships ( [ b1 ] ) , ( [ b2 ] ) and ( [ b19 ] ) it is follows that it is a function of the number or concentration of vacancies @xmath4 .",
    "it can be concluded that the free energy @xmath58 is not a thermodynamics potential in strict sense .    to construct some thermodynamics potential of the free energy , note that in the case of vacancies according to ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , the configurational entropy @xmath1 and the number of vacancies @xmath4 are in a mutual one - valued dependence with each other ,",
    "that is , the number of vacancies @xmath4 can always be used as an independent argument instead of the configurational entropy @xmath1 . in this case , executing transformation of legendre type with the pair of the conjugated thermodynamic variables @xmath42 and @xmath4 , we get the alternative type of the free energy ( curve 4 of fig .",

    "the question of their application to other types of defects ( dislocations , grain boundaries etc ) remains open , as there are no simple and reliable statistical expressions for them , analogous to those presented in part ii .",
    "at the same time , it is obvious that from the thermodynamics point of view all structural defects are characterized in identical way by surplus energy , spent for their formation , and they can be described by similar evolution equations , but written , for the present , at phenomenological level .      if the system has deviated from the equilibrium ( stationary ) state it will tend to return back to that state at a speed the higher the larger the deviation .",

    "both variants of the kinetic equations are equivalent and their application is a matter of convenience .    at the same time , for a number of reasons , more preferable are evolution equations expressed in terms of the internal energy .",
    "first , concentration ( or number ) of defects is a more easily measurable variable , second , the internal energy is a base quantity in thermodynamics ( the first law of thermodynamics ) , it is universal both for the equilibrium and non - equilibrium state and , finally , internal energy is the analogue of hamiltonian . setting the internal energy , as a function of state variables we specify the system and fully determine it from the thermodynamics point of view .",

    "shear rigidity displays activation character , and it is in inverse dependence with mobility of point defects .    to study the issue let us consider a solid having only vacancies , by setting the internal energy in the form @xmath100 where @xmath101 , @xmath102 ( @xmath103 ) are some coefficients dependent on temperature @xmath18 and elastic deformation @xmath104 , as on control parameters . for the sake of convenience and further standardization we have passed from the number of vacancies to their concentrations",
    "@xmath4 ( @xmath105 ) , and in a similar way to specific internal energy @xmath106 .",
    "then @xmath107 where @xmath108 and @xmath109 are lame moduli for a vacancy - free solid , @xmath110 , @xmath111 are corrections to the elastic moduli due to existence of vacancies ( defect of a modulus ) , @xmath104 is the first invariant of the tensor of deformations , @xmath112 .",
    "it is assumed that contribution of invariants is the most substantial at the lower degrees of presentation ( [ b30 ] ) .",
    "expression for the effective shear modulus within the framework of this model is @xmath113    the sign `` minus '' is chosen provided , that the effective modulus in material with vacancies is less than in the vacancy - free one ( see fig . 2.3 in @xcite ) .",
    "the first term @xmath109 is shear modulus in a vacancy - free crystal .",
    "it can be interpreted as a local ( microscopic ) modulus of the lattice in regions far from vacancies .",
    "the effective ( macroscopic ) modulus @xmath114 is a quantity averaged over volume containing a lot of vacancies .",
    "it is remarkable , that at a phase transit point at melting , namely , the effective macroscopic modulus goes to zero exactly , while the microscopic modulus does not convert to zero @xcite",
    ".    a few types of the temperature dependence for the shear modulus are known .",
    "for example , there is a quadratic dependence @xmath115 @xcite .",
    "other , more known semi - empirical relationship is @xcite @xmath116 where @xmath117 is the shear modulus for @xmath118 , and @xmath119 , @xmath120 are material constants .",
    "the constant @xmath120 can be treated as an activation energy @xmath121 , and the relationship ( [ b33 ] ) is presented as @xmath122    according to born principle , the temperature of melting can be defined on condition @xmath123 @xmath124    a formal agreement between the theory presented in part ii and relationship ( [ b35 ] ) can be obtained by taking the temperature of phase transition for the temperature of melting @xmath125 . at the same time , it is more logically to present the shear modulus as a two part one consisting of two terms , actually , shear modulus at zero temperature @xmath117 and an activation depressed term @xmath126    however , in obedience to this expression , the shear modulus does not go to zero at limit temperature @xmath125 , but only at @xmath127 .",
    "it is known in the theory of amorphous materials , that activation energy is proportional to the shear modulus @xmath128 @xcite .",
    "it can be assumed that a similar supposition is just for crystalline solids too , at least , in the pre - melting state , for in this state its structure becomes amorphous - like",
    ". then relationship ( [ b36 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath129    it is taken into account that here we have the effective shear modulus .",
    "it is remarkable that this equation has a trivial zero solution @xmath130 .",
    "this solution is important as it can serve for description of non - activation motion of liquid phase to which all solids pass as a result of melting .",
    "the graphs of temperature dependences of the shear modulus are shown in fig .",
    "[ f7 ] .     temperature dependence of the shear modulus : curve 1  semi - empirical shear modulus with ( [ b34 ] ) ; curve 2  effective modulus with ( [ b37 ] ) ; curve 3  shear micro - modulus .",
    "arrow indicates the jump of the shear modulus to zero value at the real melting point.,width=2 ]    curve 1 proper to semi - empirical theory ( [ b34 ] ) , slowly changes at low temperatures and sharply diminishes to zero , passing to the region of negative unphysical values .",
    "curve 2 , built for the effective shear modulus by formula ( [ b37 ] ) , changes already at low temperatures and is more declivous .",
    "it smoothly tends to zero , not passing to the region of negative values .",
    "in addition , zero values of the effective shear modulus identically satisfy equation ( [ b37 ] ) , describing a liquid phase legalistically in the whole of temperature interval , however , this solution is realized only after the phase transition .",
    "curve 3 , which corresponds to the shear micro - modulus , does not go to zero at a `` melting '' point .    the graphs of fig .",
    "[ f7 ] correspond a continuous change with the temperature of the shear modulus in the solid phase .",
    "however , at the real melting - point because of the first - order phase transition the change can be sharper ( see the arrow ) .",
    "similar transitions are observed in the real materials ( see , for example , fig . 1 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    at low temperatures , a basic contribution to shear",
    "deformation is from dislocations in view of their greater spatial size and higher mobility . in obedience to the cottrell theory , mobility of dislocations is the higher , the wider their dislocation cores @xcite .",
    "mobility of vacancies at low temperatures is negligibly small .    at more high temperatures",
    "the situation , however , changes cardinally .",
    "vacancies due to the thermomotion become delocalized in space , forming the so - called extended defects of higher mobility @xcite .",
    "the total energy barrier of a vacancy splits on a great number of barriers of lower height , which are considerably easy overcome due to thermal fluctuations .",
    "the number of variants of overcoming these barriers increases thus , here the vacancies have certain advantage over dislocations .",
    "the extended vacancy is a three - dimensional defect and the number of variants for `` lateral '' passing by potential barriers grows quadratically , while dislocation is a two - dimensional object and the number of variants in plane the perpendicular to line of dislocation increases only linearly .",
    "thus , in transition to the liquid state at point higher than the temperature of melting , a vacancy mechanism becomes so perfect , that a solid loses resistance to the change of form fully . and",
    "the vacancy emptiness is uniformly distributed ( dissolves ) in the bulk of material so , that a single vacancy can not be practically identified and its presence is talked about only legalistically .    for a more deep accordance it is necessary to take into account the fact of temperature dependence of the shear modulus in expansion of the internal energy ( [ b30 ] ) , ( [ b31 ] ) . if we substitute relationships ( [ b30 ] )  ( [ b32 ] )",
    "to pdf ( [ b11 ] ) , we get a more complicated dependence of pdf on temperature in the presence of double exponents there",
    ". however , this does not at all affect the calculations of equilibrium values of point defects concentration in solids being in the free state , because in this state @xmath131 . due to it",
    ", it becomes possible to examine the phase transition and the change of elastic properties ( shear modulus ) during such transition separately . in the presence of external stresses and the resulting elastic deformations , the influence of defect mobility must already be taken into account , as well as to take into account the influence of other types of defects on the process .",
    "earlier in a phenomenological variant , the approach was applied for the description of processes of defect formation and work hardening in metals treated by severe plastic deformation @xcite , auto - vibration transitions between the amorphous and nanocrystalline states in amorphous alloys @xcite , processes of slipping and stick - slip in the super - thin lubricants @xcite . in particular , within the indicated models , to describe the stick - slip effects the processes of transitions between solid and liquid states , that is , processes of melting and solidification , are examined . in prospect",
    ", the method can be applied for the description of kinetic processes of defect formation and forming the properties in different physical systems , including soft - matter @xcite , complex protein compounds @xcite , etc .",
    "in the article , within the framework of ideas of non - equilibrium evolutional thermodynamics , the vacancy theory of melting of solids is considered . with the account of removal of degeneration of vacancy energies due to their interaction and approximation of this interaction by polynomial presentation of the internal energy it was possible to generalize frenkel concepts and to describe the process of melting as jump - like 1st - order phase transition .",
    "it is evident that the influence of interstitial atoms on the process of melting is not of principle , as the corresponding material curves lie higher than the same curves for vacancies and do not cross the fundamental curve in this temperature region .",
    "they can only a bit shift the proper stationary ( equilibrium ) solutions for vacancies .",
    "influence of dislocations on the behavior of the system can play a role at relatively low temperatures . at temperatures close to the melting point , because of the size effect of increasing vacancy mobility , they become decisive in shear deformation of the material .",
    "the shear modulus here tends to zero .",
    "it is shown that apart from the tending to the zero of the shear modulus of the solid phase , the system has another state with the shear modulus identically equal to zero , which is realized exceptionally for the liquid state .",
    "the transition to this state can be realized earlier , than the shear modulus reaches zero , that is , the real melting point will lie somewhat to the left from the point at which the shear modulus becomes zero .",
    "in addition , in the article on the example of solid with vacancies , a more general theory of non - equilibrium evolutional thermodynamics has been illustrated .",
    "it is shown that kinetic equations can be written not only in terms of the free energy , but also in terms of internal and modified free energy .",
    "the whole system of interconnected non - equilibrium thermodynamic potentials is obtained , including , effective internal and modified free energy .",
