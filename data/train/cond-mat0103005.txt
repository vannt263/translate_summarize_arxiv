    "in condensed matter physics , measurements are usually made on many identical quantum systems prepared at the same time .",
    "for example , in nuclear or electron magnetic resonance experiments , an ensemble of systems of nuclei and electrons are probed to obtain the resonance signals . in this case",
    ", the measurement result is an average response of the ensemble . on the other hand , various proposed condensed - matter quantum computer architectures @xcite demand",
    "the need to readout physical properties of a single electronic qubit , such as charge or spin at a single electron level .",
    "this is a non - trivial problem since it involves an individual quantum particle measured by a practical detector in a realistic environment .",
    "it is particularly important to take account of the decoherence introduced by the measurements on the qubit as well as to understand how the quantum state of the qubit , conditioned on a particular single realization of measurement , evolves in time for the purpose of quantum computing .",
    "we consider , in this paper , the problem of an electron tunneling between two coupled quantum dots ( cqd s ) , a two - state quantum system ( qubit ) , using a low - transparency point contact ( pc ) or tunnel junction as a detector ( environment ) continuously measuring the position of the electron , schematically illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : pc ] .",
    "this problem has been extensively studied in refs.@xcite .",
    "the case of measurements by a general quantum point contact detector with arbitrary transparency has also been investigated in refs.@xcite .",
    "in addition , a similar system measured by a single electron transistor rather than a pc has been studied in refs .",
    "the influence of the detector ( environment ) on the measured system can be determined by the reduced density matrix obtained by tracing out the environmental degrees of the freedom in the total , system plus environment , density matrix .",
    "the master equation ( or rate equations for the reduced - density - matrix elements ) for the cqd system ( qubit ) has been derived and analyzed in refs .",
    "however , this ( unconditional ) master equation describes only the ensemble average property for the cqd system . integrating or tracing out the pc environmental degrees of the freedom is equivalent to completely ignoring or averaging over the results of all measurement records ( electron current records in this case ) . in this sense ,",
    "the pc is treated as a pure environment rather than a measurement device which can provide information about the change of the state of the qubit . on the other hand ,",
    "if a measurement is made on the system and the results are available , the state or density matrix is a conditional state conditioned on the measurement results .",
    "hence the deterministic , unconditional master equation can not describe the conditional dynamics of the qubit in a single realization of continuous measurements which reflects the stochastic nature of an electron tunneling through the pc barrier .",
    "korotkov @xcite has obtained the langevin rate equations for the cqd system measured by a ideal pc detector .",
    "these rate equations describe the random evolution of the density matrix that both conditions , and is conditioned by , the pc detector output .",
    "recently , we @xcite presented a _ quantum trajectory _",
    "@xcite measurement analysis of the same system .",
    "we found that the conditional dynamics of the cqd system can be described by the stochastic schrdinger equation for the conditioned state vector , provided that the information carried away from the cqd system by the pc reservoirs can be recovered by the perfect detection of the measurements .",
    "we also analyzed the localization rates at which the qubit becomes localized in one of the two states when the coupling frequency @xmath0 between the states is zero .",
    "we showed that the localization time discussed there is slightly different from the measurement time defined in refs .",
    "the mixing rate at which the two possible states of the qubit become mixed when @xmath1 was calculated as well and found in agreement with the result in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this paper",
    ", we focus on the qubit dynamics conditioned on a particular realization of the actual measured current through the pc device .",
    "especially , we take into account the effect of inefficient measurement on the conditional dynamics and illustrate the conditional quantum evolutions by numerical simulations .    the problem for a `` non - ideal '' detector was discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite . there",
    "the non - ideality of the detector is modeled as two ideal detectors `` in parallel '' with inaccessible output of the second detector .",
    "the information loss is due to the interaction with the second detector , treated as a `` pure environment '' , ( which does not affect the detector current ) .",
    "as a consequence , the decoherence rate , @xmath2 , in that case is larger than the decoherence rate for the pc as an environment alone , @xmath3",
    ". hence an extra decoherence term , @xmath4 , for example , is added in the rate equation @xmath5 . however , this approach does not account for the inefficiency in the measurements , which arises when the detector sometimes misses detection . in that case , there is still only one pc detector ( environment ) and disregarding all measurement records leads to @xmath6 .",
    "furthermore , the detector current is affected and in fact reduced by the inefficiency in the measurements .    in this paper",
    ", we analyze the conditional qubit dynamics analytically and numerically .",
    "we take into account the effect of inefficient measurement of the pc detector on the dynamics of the qubit .",
