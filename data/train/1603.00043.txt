    "in our common understanding of the world , we typically perceive events as happening one after another , in a given order .",
    "relations between events are understood in terms of causes and effects , where a cause can only precede an effect .",
    "events can thus be embedded in a _ causal structure _ , which defines the _ causal order _ between them .",
    "this viewpoint is ingrained for instance in the circuit model for computation or information processing , where operations are performed by gates that are applied in a definite order .",
    "while the assumption that events follow a definite causal order seems natural in the classical world , one may nevertheless wonder whether it must really always be so .",
    "one may in particular become suspicious when entering the quantum world , where the properties of physical systems are not always well - defined .    a general framework , that of _ process matrices _ , was recently introduced to investigate physical processes without pre - assuming a definite global causal structure ; the framework only assumes that quantum theory correctly describes what happens locally , in some observers laboratories  @xcite .",
    "it was shown that this allows for processes that are incompatible with any definite causal order ",
    "so - called _ causally nonseparable processes_. the framework was first introduced on a rather abstract level , with no clear physical interpretation given to the first examples of causally nonseparable processes . however ,",
    "a concrete physical example of a causally nonseparable process was later exhibited  @xcite : namely , the recently proposed _ quantum switch _ , a new resource for quantum computation where the order of operations is controlled by a qubit in a superposition of two different states  which indeed does not fit in the standard framework of causally ordered quantum circuits  @xcite .    to ensure that this notion of causal nonseparability has any practical meaning , one needs of course to be able to verify that a given process is causally nonseparable .",

    "more recently we introduced , in analogy with entanglement witnesses , the concept of _ witnesses of causal nonseparability _ ( or _ causal witnesses _ , as we initially called them )  @xcite . here",
    "a witness corresponds to an operator that can ( in principle ) be ` measured ' on a given process by combining the statistics of various operations , and whose expectation value , if negative , certifies the causal nonseparability of the process .",
