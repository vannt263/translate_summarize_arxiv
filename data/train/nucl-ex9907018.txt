    "for a long time it has been known that the solar - system abundances of elements heavier than iron have been produced by neutron - capture reactions  @xcite . however , neutron capture is also of relevance for abundances of isotopes lighter than iron especially for neutron - rich isotopes , even though the bulk of these elements has been synthesized by charged - particle induced reactions .",
    "the attempts to understand neutron - induced nucleosynthesis require as important ingredients the knowledge of neutron - capture rates .",
    "the influence of shell effects on neutron capture is one of the most interesting aspects of neutron capture , especially since neutron capture in the vicinity of magic numbers is often a bottleneck in neutron - induced nucleosynthesis .",
    "this is the case also in neutron capture on neutron - rich isotopes close to the magic proton and neutron numbers @xmath6 and @xmath7 , i.e. , in the vicinity of the double - magic nucleus @xmath8ca . in particular , the reaction rate of neutron capture for ti - isotopes is of relevance for isotopic abundance anomalies in silicon carbide ( sic ) grains occurring in carbonecous meteorites  @xcite .",
    "contrary to most other solar system solids this type of grains has not been reprocessed an / or homogenized .",
    "therefore , they can be can be potentially associated with their stellar origin .",
    "the main part of presolar sic grains have isotopic compositions implying that they most likely condensed in the winds of a variety of asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars  @xcite .",
    "the sic grains show a large spread of @xmath9ti , the permille deviation from the solar ratio with @xmath8ti as reference isotope , which is evidence for s - processing  @xcite .",
    "the very small neutron capture cross section of the neutron magic nucleus @xmath0ti makes it behave as a bottleneck in the s - process path , building up a considerable abundance .",
    "the predictions of agb models discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite show for the neutron - rich isotopes @xmath10ti that the deviations from their solar ratio are essentially in agreement with their measured values in sic grains  @xcite .",
    "however , for @xmath0ti the calculated permille deviations from the solar ratio seem a little too high  @xcite .",
    "this was one of the motivations to remeasure and reinvestigate the neutron capture cross section on @xmath0ti in the thermonuclear energy range .    in sect .",
    "ii the measurements using the fast cyclic activation technique , the neutron production and the time - of - flight measurements are described .",
    "the analysis of the thermonuclear capture cross - sections and their interpretation in form of the non - resonant and resonant capture follows in sect .",

    "the characteristic @xmath1-ray lines of the @xmath2ti product nucleus with e@xmath11=320 and 928kev served as an excellent signature for the capture events because of the high accuracy of 0.4% with which the intensity per decay of the 320kev line is known ( table  [ tt1 ] ) .",
    "the capture cross sections were determined relative to the @xmath12au(n,@xmath1)@xmath13au(2.69517d ) standard reaction  @xcite , where the 411.8044kev @xmath1-ray line of the @xmath13au decay is known with high precision ( table  [ tt1 ] ) .      the activation technique @xcite , especially the fast cyclic activation has been described in previous publications @xcite .",

    "measurements with neutron spectra of mean neutron energies of 25 , 30 , 52 , and 145kev were carried out by adjusting with the accelerator the appropriate proton energy .",
    "the energy spread of the neutron spectra produced is dependent on the energy loss of the protons in the target layer . for proton energies close to reaction threshold",
    "the target layers were chosen thick enough that the energy loss of the protons reached the reaction threshold within the layer .",
    "this makes the neutron spectrum independent of the target thickness . using the @xmath35li(p , n ) and t(p , n ) reactions in this way we generated quasi - maxwellian spectra with thermal energies kt=25 and 52kev , respectively  @xcite .",
    "the spectrum with a mean neutron energy of 30  kev was obtained via the @xmath35li(p , n ) reaction with a proton energy of 1882kev very close to the reaction threshold energy e@xmath36=1881kev . with this spectrum",
    "it was possible to perform a measurement in between the resonances , where the 16.99kev p - wave resonance  @xcite is most critical . a typical tof spectrum at @xmath37 and the respective neutron distribution",

    "much higher than the reaction threshold energy of the @xmath35li(p , n ) reaction and a thin li - target the neutron energy distribution is dependent on the thickness of the li layer .",
    "the spectrum at 145kev ( fig .",
    "[ f22 ] ) was generated using li - targets of 2.5@xmath38 m .",
    "the li - targets were carefully prepared .",
    "metallic li was evaporated onto 1.5 mm thick copper backing .",
    "the thickness of the li layer is determined during evaporation .",
    "for each new target also a new copper backing is used because of li diffusion into the copper .",
    "targets of good quality were always freshly made before use because long term storage under liquid nitrogen already leads to slight damage of the metallic li through the onset of oxidation .",
    "the proton energy and the thickness of the li target were checked by a a time - of - flight measurement before an activation run was started . in the flight time measurements typically a pulse width of 10 ns and a repetition rate of 1 mhz was used .",
    "the neutrons were counted by a @xmath30li glass detector ( 2.54 cm dia @xmath39 1 mm ) at a flight path of 91 cm .    to determine the neutron distribution at the sample position time - of - flight spectra normalized to the proton beam current",
    "were recorded at zero degree and at different angles in steps of 5 degrees .",
    "these spectra are needed for calculating the angle integrated spectrum at the sample position by montecarlo methods , where the extended li - target of 6 mm diameter and the mean free path of the neutrons through the sample are taken into account .",
    "the neutron spectra shown in the figures have been determined in this way .    during",
    "the activation runs beam currents up to 100 @xmath40a could be applied without damage of the li - layer because of an effective water cooling system . for the kt=52kev measurement with the tritium target",
    "a beam current of 12@xmath40a was used , and no significant deterioration of the tritium target was observed during the experiment . in the",
    "activations four spectra were continuously recorded , an 8k spectrum of the relative neutron flux @xmath41 time from the neutron monitor , an 8k spectrum of the proton beam current @xmath41 time , an 8k @xmath1-ray spectrum from the ge - detector and an 1k pulse height spectrum of the @xmath30li glass monitor . for safety",
    "every two hours a backup was stored from these spectra automatically . from the ratio neutron flux and proton",
    "beam the actual quality of the target was controlled and from the @xmath30li glass pulse height spectrum the threshold for @xmath1-ray background suppression was checked .",

    "the unknown capture cross - section of @xmath0ti is measured relative to the well - known standard cross section of @xmath12au  @xcite .",
    "as the metallic natural ti and @xmath0tio@xmath3 samples , respectively , to be investigated are characterized by a finite thickness it is necessary to sandwich the sample by two comparatively thin gold foils for the determination of the effective neutron flux at sample position .",
    "the activities of these gold foils were counted also individually after termination of the cyclic activation .",
    "the effective count rate of gold was obtained from these individual rates as well as from the accumulated gold count rate during the cyclic activation run .",
    "therefore , the effective neutron flux at sample position was determined in two ways by the gold activation according to the eqs .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) .",

    "the @xmath1-ray absorption in the samples was calculated using tables published by storm and israel  @xcite and veigele  @xcite . the half - lives and the @xmath1-ray intensities per decay of @xmath2ti and @xmath13au given in table  [ tt1 ]",
    "were taken from @xcite .",
    "table  [ tt2 ] gives a survey of the sample weights and the measured @xmath0ti capture cross - sections .",
    "the metallic ti and the @xmath0tio@xmath3 samples of 6 mm diameter were sandwiched by thin gold foils of the same dimensions . at 25kev neutron energy measurements",
    "were carried out with titanium oxid sample masses between 40 and 100 mg .",
    "the samples of the @xmath0tio@xmath3 powder were heated to 1000@xmath43c for 3 hours to get stable self - supporting tablets .",
    "no measurable weight loss was observed .",
    "only thin samples were used to minimize corrections for neutron scattering or self - absorption effects , e.g. from oxygen , the ti isotopes and from the gold foils back into the sample .",
    "estimations show that these effects are below 2% @xcite .",
    "three runs were carried out with metallic ti foils of natural isotopic compositon ( table  [ tt2 ] ) .",
    "the largest multiple scattering effects would have been expected from oygen .",
    "however the runs with the metallic ti samples and the runs with the @xmath0tio@xmath3 samples show no measurable differences . in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] the accumulated @xmath1-ray intensity from one of the @xmath0ti activations is shown .",
    "the relevant @xmath1-lines are well isolated on a low level of background counts .",
    "the following systematic uncertainties were combined by quadratic error propagation ; au standard cross section : 1.5 - 3% , ge - detector efficiency : 2% , @xmath1-ray intensity per decay : 0.5% for the @xmath2ti and 0.1% for the @xmath13au decay , divergence of neutron beam : 2 - 7% , factor @xmath19 : 1.5% , sample weight : @xmath440.5% .",
    "our measurement in between the region of resonances , at 20 to 40kev is interpreted as direct capture ( dc ) .",
    "the size of this cross section shows that it is not a negligible effect .",
    "because of the selectivity of our activation method only capture in @xmath0ti can contribute to this value .",
    "the contributions from the tails of @xmath0ti resonances are estimated to be not more than 0.005 mbarn and are neglected .",
    "this estimate is in agreement with the value which can be derived from the respective value for thermal capture given in ref .",
    "theoretical estimations suggest that we have to treat our measured direct capture value as pure s - wave capture with a 1/v energy dependence .",
    "a p - wave contribution would be , as a rough calculation shows , at 30kev @xmath45 17.5@xmath40barn .",
    "if we assume that the thermal capture is also essentially direct capture we can make a comparison .",
    "the 1/v extrapolation of our measured direct capture cross section to thermal energy gives 0.421@xmath40.012 barn which is , however , significantly larger than the measured value of 0.179@xmath40.003 barn  @xcite .",
    "but if the bound s - wave resonance at -16.8kev specified in the compilation of mughabghab et al .  @xcite exists destructive interference of resonance capture could occur . as the first positive resonance lies at 56.5kev and",
    "the s - wave level spacing is estimated to be d@xmath46=125@xmath470kev  @xcite , this bound state resonance seems to be not unlikely .",
    "a capture cross section of this resonance at 25.3mev of 0.051barn which corresponds to a radiative width of this resonance of 0.34ev can reduce the direct capture to the observed thermal value .",
    "a theoretical dc calculation was performed using a realistic neutron - nucleus folding potential @xcite and spectroscopic factors of @xmath2ti from the ( d , p ) experiment of ref .",
    "the result of the dc calculation overestimates our experimental value at 30kev by a factor of 2 ; the calculated cross section depends on the choice of the potential parameters and the uncertainties of the spectroscopic factors .",
    "the resulting uncertainty of the calculated value is also roughly a factor of 2 .",
    "a further indication of the strong influence of the subthreshold state on the thermal capture cross section comes from the comparison of the experimental @xcite and theoretical branching ratio . in the dc calculations the strongest transition is the ground state ( @xmath47 ) transition with a branching of about 60% ( independent on the choice of the potential parameters ) .",
    "however , experimentally the transition to the first excited @xmath48 state at 1167kev is dominating with 35% , and the ground state branching is almost negligible ( 4.2% ) .",
    "it should be noted that this experimental branching ratio is very surprising because in the neighboring nucleus @xmath8ca the experimental and the theoretical branching ratios agree well and show a dominating transition to the first @xmath47 state .",
    "the disappearance of the ground state transition in @xmath0ti can be explained by destructive interference with the proposed @xmath49 subthreshold state at -16.8kev .",
    "furthermore , a strong branching ratio of this subthreshold state can be predicted from the interference effect which mainly influences the ground state transition at thermal energies .",
    "the @xmath0ti capture cross section has been previously measured by allen et al .",
    "@xcite using the time - of - flight technique .",
    "these data have been essentially adopted in the compilation of mughabghab et al .",
    "@xcite except for the g@xmath50 value of the 97.6kev p - wave resonance which was changed from 0.77 to 0.16ev . in an additional publication allen et al .",
    "@xcite corrected the @xmath51 value of the 56.5kev s - wave resonance from 1.1@xmath40.2ev to 0.2@xmath40.2ev and estimated also the @xmath51 widths for the s - wave resonances at 146.8 and 184.9kev to be @xmath44 0.1 and 0.9@xmath40.3ev , respectively .",
    "these revisions were necessary as the oak ridge capture detection setup had turned out to be very sensitive to scattered neutrons resulting in a high prompt ( time dependent ) capture @xmath1-ray background which requires large corrections to the capture areas of the s - wave resonances with a large ratio of neutron scattering and capture width  @xcite .",
    "the areas of the s - wave resonances at 56.5 and 184.9kev had to be corrected for prompt background contributions of 87 and 73%  @xcite , respectively .",
    "for the energy interval 100 to 150kev allen et al .",
    "@xcite report an average capture cross section of 0.54@xmath40.08mbarn which could contain contributions of the 146.8kev s - wave resonance .",
    "however , allen s average cross section is , it seems to be , only derived from the two identified resonances in this energy region .",
    "the resonance strenghts of the 101.4 and 120.6kev resonances exactly add up to the given average cross section . in an effort to obtain an estimate for the strength of the 146.8 kev resonance we have carried out a measurement with a neutron spectrum of 145@xmath420kev .",
    "our measured average cross section at 145 kev of 0.650@xmath40.029mbarn consists of a direct contribution of 0.175@xmath40.005mbarn extrapolated from the measured value at 30kev , and the resonance contributions from the known 101.4 , 120.6 , and 185.6kev resonances and the 146.8kev s - wave resonance to be investigated .",
    "the average capture cross section of a narrow resonance compared to the neutron spectrum used can be described in the following way @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the breit - wigner formula for the resonace capture , @xmath54 the experimental neutron spectrum and a@xmath11= ( 2@xmath55/k@xmath56 ) g@xmath57 the resonance area with k the wave number , g=(2j+1)/[2(2i+1 ) ] the statistical spin factor with j the compound and i the nuclear spin , and @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 the radiation , neutron and total widths , respectively . after subtraction of the direct capture and the resonance capture from the 101.4 , 120.6 , and 185.6kev resonances , where the resonance capture contribution of the 120.6kev resonance of 0.15@xmath40.07 mb is comparable in magnitude with the direct capture part , we obtain for the average resonance capture of the 146.8kev s - wave resonance 0.22@xmath40.13 mb which corresponds with a radiation width g@xmath57=0.37@xmath40.24ev .",

    "a pure 1/v temperature dependence was assumed , and the temperature dependence of the whfz calculation @xcite is practically also 1/v . as there are no @xmath0ti resonances below neutron energies of 17kev these calculations overestimate the mac cross section in the temperature range below kt=20kev .",

    "the inclusion of a direct capture component into the calculation of the stellar reaction rate of @xmath0ti is of importance .",
    "it compensates the decrease of the mac cross section at kt=25kev due to the necessary reduction of the s - wave radiation width especially of the 56.5kev resonance so that the calculation from the resonance parameters remains in agreement with our direct mac cross section measurement .",
    "this may be considered also as an evidence for the consistence of the present data .",
    "it is also important to note that the stellar @xmath0ti reaction rate is not constant because the capture cross section has a non 1/v dependence in the thermonuclear temperature range important for the investigation of the isotopic titanium anomalies which are supposed to be of s - process origin . for a further improvement of the @xmath0ti mac cross section a new time - of - flight measurement",
    "is recommended in order to determine more accurately especially the s - wave radiation widths .",

    "this also reduces the calculated abundance of @xmath0ti in agb models  @xcite . as was stated in ref .",

    "<S> at the karlsruhe and tbingen 3.75mv van de graaff accelerators the thermonuclear @xmath0ti(n,@xmath1)@xmath2ti(5.8min ) cross section was measured by the fast cyclic activation technique via the 320.852 and 928.65kev @xmath1-ray lines of the @xmath2ti - decay . </S>",
    "<S> metallic ti samples of natural isotopic composition and samples of tio@xmath3 enriched in @xmath0ti by 67.53% were irradiated between two gold foils which served as capture standards . </S>",
    "<S> the capture cross - section was measured at the neutron energies 25 , 30 , 52 , and 145kev , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the direct capture cross section was determined to be 0.387@xmath40.011 mbarn at 30kev . </S>",
    "<S> we found evidence for a bound state s - wave resonance with an estimated radiative width of 0.34ev which destructively interfers with direct capture . </S>",
    "<S> the strength of a suggested s - wave resonance at 146.8kev was determined . </S>",
    "<S> the present data served to calculate , in addition to the directly measured maxwellian averaged capture cross sections at 25 and 52kev , an improved stellar @xmath0ti(n,@xmath1)@xmath2ti rate in the thermonuclear energy region from 1 to 250kev . </S>",
    "<S> the new stellar rate leads at low temperatures to much higher values than the previously recommended rate , e.g. , at @xmath5kev the increase amounts to about 50% . </S>",
    "<S> the new reaction rate therefore reduces the abundance of @xmath0ti due to s - processing in agb stars . </S>"
