    "thousands of planets outside of our solar system have already been discovered despite our potential ignorance of what planets may reside in our own backyard .",
    "this arresting notion @xcite was given added credence with the discovery of the second sednoid , 2012 vp113 @xcite , because both that object and sedna have arguments of pericentre clustered around @xmath0 ( see their table 1 ) .",
    "this clustering is not likely to be a result of observational bias @xcite , and may be explained by one or more planets which exist beyond the orbit of neptune but are so far invisible to us @xcite .",
    "however , the existence of these two scattered disc objects do not necessarily require the presence of additional planets @xcite .",
    "the recent finding that several distant kuiper belt objects exhibit this same clustering in orbital space , as well a clustering in physical space @xcite , has prompted a febrile response amongst the public and scientific community .",
    "constraining the location and size of a putative  planet nine \" has been the focus of many subsequent publications , through both orbital dynamics @xcite and intrinsic physical properties @xcite .",
    "overall and roughly , these studies suggest that planet nine is more massive than the earth and resides at hundreds or thousands of au away from the sun ( other similarly massive planets could lie further away ) .",
    "other studies investigated potential origins for planet nine , including in - situ formation @xcite , scattering into its current ( theorized ) orbit @xcite and capture from other stars in the sun s birth cluster @xcite .",
    "the survivability of planet nine due to passing stars has also been investigated @xcite .",
    "additional planets which orbit the sun also could exist but evidence for their presence has yet to be marshalled .",
    "two points not emphasized in the above studies are : ( 1 ) how our knowledge of the fate of the solar system changes with the presence of planets beyond neptune s orbit , and ( 2 ) the deeper fundamental issue of what the implications are for similarly - constructed systems and more generally exoplanetary science .",
    "these two concepts are linked through white dwarf planetary systems , and represent the motivation for this paper .",
    "the sun will leave the main sequence in about 6.5 gyr , and undergo drastic changes ( fig .",
    "[ sunevo ] ) .",
    "its radius will increase by a factor of about 230 , it will lose almost half of its current mass , and its luminosity will reach a peak value which is about 4000 times its current value ( see e.g @xcite , @xcite and fig . 3 of @xcite ) .",
    "the sun will become so large that its radius will extend just beyond where the earth currently sits .",
    "these major changes will occur in two phases .",
    "the red giant branch phase will last about 800 myr . in this timespan",
    ", the sun will gradually lose about a quarter of its mass .",
    "the second phase , when the sun becomes an asymptotic giant branch star , is quicker : lasting just 5 myr .",
    "another quarter of the sun s mass will be lost during this period . during both phases ,",
    "the radius of the sun will extend out to nearly the earth s distance .",
    "the consequences for the inner solar system will be profound .",
    "the terrestrial planets , which are likely to remain in stable orbits until the end of the main sequence at the approximately @xmath1% level @xcite , will be in danger . mercury and venus will be engulfed , and the earth will be on the edge of survivability @xcite .",
    "mars will be roasted , but should survive , because it will escape being ensnared by the tidal reach of the sun @xcite .",
    "asteroid belt constituents between 100  m and 10  km in radius will be spun up to breakup speed @xcite , creating a sea of debris , some of which may be water - rich @xcite .    the consequences for the giant planets , however , will be more benign .",
    "jupiter , saturn , uranus and neptune will increase their semimajor axes by a factor of about two each , and not undergo scattering nor instability @xcite , even though the chemistry of at least jupiter s atmosphere will be fundamentally altered @xcite .",
    "the giant planet eccentricities will remain effectively fixed because they reside within the adiabatic limit , beyond which stellar mass loss changes both eccentricity and semimajor axis @xcite .",
    "the present - day `` adiabatic '' limit for the solar system specifically lies between about @xmath2 and @xmath3 au @xcite .",
    "further , even though mass loss changes stability limits @xcite , this change will not be large enough to affect the giant planets .",
    "i perform some simulations here also to back up this statement .",
    "moons , the kuiper belt , scattered disc and oort cloud will also be affected .",
    "moons of planets will become more entrenched in the hill spheres of the host planets , and would stay there in the absence of a planetary scattering event @xcite .",
    "although known kuiper belt and scattered disc objects are within the adiabatic limit , many are likely to become unstable as the stability limits between neptune and kuiper belt objects change as the sun s mass decreases ( e.g. @xcite ) and its luminosity increases @xcite",
    ". the oort cloud will be both excited and decimated @xcite , which will alter the influx of comets into the inner solar system @xcite , and these comets can be subsequently perturbed by radiation from the solar white dwarf @xcite .",
    "the presence of additional planets ( one or more ) can trigger instability purely through lagrange instability as the sun becomes older .",
    "this phenomenon in main sequence extrasolar systems has been well - explored ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and will have greater predictive power as asteroseismology continues to pinpoint the ages of old stars @xcite .",
    "mass loss from giant branch evolution will change the limits further , as outlined above .",
    "additionally , a planet residing in the non - adiabatic regime will have its eccentricity changed during this mass loss , altering the limits even further .",
    "when combined with galactic tides and stellar flybys , the result may be a significantly more dynamically active evolved system than previously envisaged .",
    "hence , although jupiter , saturn , uranus and neptune by themselves will remain stable throughout the sun s giant branch and white dwarf phases , the presence of additional planets might trigger instability after the sun has left the main sequence , but not before .",
    "this scenario might be common throughout the milky way if extrasolar planetary system architectures from about 5 to 30 au resemble the solar system s , and contain a sufficiently distant and massive extra planet . in this paper ,",
    "i quantify this scenario , and place rough bounds on the mass and orbit of one additional planet which can trigger future instability .",
    "the importance of considering extrasolar systems in general arises from the outcome of the instability during the white dwarf phase .",
    "we know that planetary systems around white dwarfs are just as common as those orbiting main sequence stars , primarily through the detection of metal debris in the atmospheres of the degenerate stars .",
    "such `` polluted '' white dwarfs now number in the thousands ( @xcite and hollands et al . in preparation ) .",
    "high - sensitivity observational surveys reveal that between one - quarter and one - half of the known milky way white dwarfs are estimated to host planetary debris @xcite .",
    "the spectacular discovery of at least one minor planet disintegrating in real time within the white dwarf disruption radius @xcite has prompted a spate of observational follow - up studies @xcite as well as some theoretical attempts to explain the complex behaviour @xcite .",
    "such minor planets are assumed to supply dusty and gaseous debris discs which orbit the white dwarf @xcite .",
    "such discs eventually accrete onto the atmosphere of the star itself @xcite .    the specific primary mechanism which transports the rocky bodies to the white dwarf is still debatable ( see section 7 of @xcite ) but relies on interactions between minor planets and larger bodies ( bonsor et al .",
    "2011 ; bonsor & wyatt 2012 ; debes , walsh & stark 2012 ; frewen & hansen 2014 ) . instabilities which arise in white dwarf planetary systems ( veras et al . 2013a ; voyatzis et al . 2013 ; mustill et al .",
    "2014 ; veras & gnsicke 2015 ; bonsor & veras 2015 ; payne et al . 2016a ,",
    "b ; hamers & portegies zwart 2016 ; petrovich & muoz 2016 ) promote an architecture conducive to pollution by placing planets and liberated moons in orbits that sweep through regions of space which may access reservoirs of debris .",
    "examples of such reservoirs are those that arise from planet - planet collisions ( shannon et al . in preparation ) or yorp - induced asteroid breakup ( veras et al .",
    "2014a ) .",
    "therefore , the ubiquity of white dwarf pollution throughout the milky way ( zuckerman et al .",
    "2003 , 2010 ; koester et al .",
    "2014 ) suggests that post - main - sequence instability is common , an idea that would be aided by the presence of extrasolar analogues of planet nine : i.e. potentially massive planets on wide orbits that remain stable during the main sequence phase but begin to scatter gravitationally during or after giant branch mass loss .",
    "if the presence of planets at hundreds or thousands of au is the norm , regardless of their dynamical origin , then that scenario is broadly consistent with the observed end states of planetary systems .      in this paper",
    "i characterize the mass and orbital parameters of an additional distant planet that would create gravitational instability amongst giant planet analogues orbiting a sun - like star after the latter turns off of the main sequence .",
    "this result would also apply to the solar system if no planet nine is found now : at some point later in the sun s main sequence lifetime the sun may capture an additional planet @xcite .    in section 2 ,",
    "i provide more detail about the evolution of sun - like stars , before , in section 3 , isolating the varied effects that come into play during the giant branch and white dwarf phases .",
    "my computational method is detailed in section 4 .",
    "i explain the initial conditions and report on my simulation results in section 5 before summarizing the conclusions of this work in section 6 .",
    "amongst the sun s many physical properties ( such as radius and luminosity ) , its mass is the most important one for my study . on the main sequence ,",
    "the sun s mass loss rate ( @xmath4 yr@xmath5 ) is negligible @xcite .",
    "however , the sun s future evolution beyond the main sequence is unknown .",
    "a potentially good guess is to consider the typical evolution of other @xmath6 stars with metallicities of @xmath7 .",
    "although these two parameters are well - established for the sun , an important unknown is the future rate of mass loss during the red giant branch phase .    a traditional formulation of this rate is the reimers prescription @xcite , which has now been improved @xcite , and may be parametrized as    @xmath8    @xmath9 , \\label{reimers}\\ ] ]    where @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the mass , luminosity , radius , temperature and surface gravity of the star .",
    "the value of @xmath15 reproduces the coefficient given in @xcite , and @xmath16 reproduces the coefficient given in the traditional formulation , which does not contain the terms dependent on @xmath13 nor @xmath14 .",
    "equation ( [ reimers ] ) applies to the giant branch phase only",
    ". mass loss evolution on the asymptotic giant branch phase is qualitatively different , and is typically characterised by the prescription of @xcite :    @xmath17\\ ] ]    where @xmath18 is computed in @xmath19 yr@xmath5 and such that    @xmath20    where the value @xmath21 is computed in years .",
    "the continued common use of this prescription even over two decades after it was published helps indicate its robustness in the face of new observations .",
    "this formulation also importantly includes the `` superwind '' ( peak mass loss ) which occurs at the `` tip '' ( end - point ) of the asymptotic giant branch @xcite .",
    "after the asymptotic giant branch phase , the sun will become a white dwarf .",
    "the solar white dwarf will not lose mass nor change its radius , but will gradually dim .",
    "figure [ sunevo ] illustrates the sun s evolution for ( @xmath22 ) from the sse code , which uses the traditional reimers formulation and will be described in more detail in section 4 .",
    "i adopted these values in order to encompass a realistic range , as outlined above , and further to conform to the range adopted in @xcite .",
    "[ sunevo ] displays the sun s mass evolution during the transition between the red giant branch and asymptotic giant branch for all three values ( also included for added perspective are the sun s radius , luminosity and effective temperature changes ) .",
    "the resulting solar white dwarf mass for each of these values is @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) , @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) and @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "the motion of any planet orbiting a star at a distance of at least hundreds or thousands of au could be affected by a variety of effects .",
    "these include post - main - sequence mass loss , galactic tides , and flybys from passing stars ( see fig . 2 of @xcite ) .",
    "combining these effects with the gravitational interactions from a set of giant planets like jupiter , saturn , uranus and neptune is non - trivial , especially during close encounters .",
    "i am interested in the consequences of these effects on the orbits of giant planets , and in the below subsections , isolate these physical processes .",
    "consider first a single planet with an arbitrary sub - stellar mass in isolation on an arbitrary orbit whose pericentre lies beyond @xmath29 au from the sun - like star .",
    "stars pass by the sun on a regular basis , and occasionally enter the sun s gravitational sphere of influence .",
    "sometimes these intrusions are deep .",
    "in fact , a sun - like star can expect to encounter another star at a distance of a few hundred au over its main sequence lifetime @xcite .",
    "the consequences for a distant planet may be any outcome ( orbit perturbation , collision , ejection , engulfment ) depending on the velocity , direction and mass of the flyby star .",
    "on gyr - timescales , objects with semimajor axes of the order @xmath3 au have a significant chance of being stripped away by passing stars @xcite .",
    "these flybys will occur during all phases of stellar evolution .",
    "however , predicting where and when these flybys will occur is generally not possible because the stellar kinematic memory in the galaxy is lost well - before 1 gyr in the future @xcite .",
    "in fact , the significant distance errors on the closest known solar flyby , which occurred about @xmath30 yr ago , are @xmath31 au @xcite . consequently , accurately predicting the incidence of flybys on the giant branch or white dwarf phases of sun - like stars is not possible , and hence i do not consider flybys any further .",
    "the effect of galactic tides is more predictable . in the solar neighbourhood , the vertical component of these tides",
    "is an order of magnitude stronger than the planar components @xcite , greatly simplifying the equations of motion ( see the contrast within table 1 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for most orbits except those near the escape boundary , galactic tides change a planet s eccentricity @xmath32 , inclination @xmath33 , argument of periastron @xmath34 and longitude of ascending node @xmath35  but not its semimajor axis @xmath36 @xcite",
    "however , near the escape boundary ( within a factor of 3 - 10 in orbital period ) , all of the orbital elements vary ( fig . 3 of * ? ? ?",
    "the strength of these tidal changes depends primarily on the inclination of the planetary orbit with respect to the galactic plane , with the maximum effect achieved for polar orbits . in this extreme case , the planet s",
    "eccentricity may reach unity and consequently escape the system . in the other extreme , coplanar , case",
    "the minimum eccentricity increase and decrease factors generated by galactic tides in the solar neighbourhood are roughly @xmath37 ( eq .",
    "44 of * ? ? ?",
    "this value corresponds to an eccentricity change of about @xmath38 for @xmath39 au and @xmath40 for @xmath41 au .    the solar system , however",
    ", does not fit either extreme .",
    "the ecliptic is inclined to the galactic plane by about @xmath42 , and the orbits of the outer planets therefore have a relative inclination of about @xmath43 with respect to the galactic plane .",
    "this orientation dictates that an object like sedna ( with a semimajor axis of about 500 au and eccentricity of 0.86 ) will change its eccentricity by about @xmath44 from now until the end of the main sequence ( fig . 2 of * ? ? ?",
    "at @xmath2 au , a substellar companion may significantly change its eccentricity by @xmath45 after 10 gyr ( fig .",
    "3 of * ? ? ?",
    "overall then , the inclination of a distant planet with respect to the galactic plane may importantly be affected by galactic tides , with a potential subsequent effect on the stability of the remaining planets in the system .",
    "stellar mass loss will likely represent the key dynamical driver of the future solar system , as well as for most exoplanetary systems .",
    "the motion of a distant planet will be determined by the solution of the following set of differential equations @xcite    @xmath46 \\frac{\\dot{m}_{\\star } + \\dot{m}_{\\rm pl}}{m_{\\star } + m_{\\rm pl } } , \\label{eqml3e } \\\\",

    "i have denoted the star s ( changing ) mass as @xmath10 ( @xmath19 is just the current value of the mass of a sun - like star ) and the planet s mass as @xmath49 .",
    "the evolution of the anomalies is    @xmath50    where the mean motion @xmath51 , and generally , @xmath52 . because the planet accretes some of the stellar ejecta ( @xcite and section 4.2.2 .",
    "of @xcite ) @xmath53 .",
    "however , for solar system analogues , @xmath54 .    equations ( [ eqml3af])-([eqml3e ] ) are not known to be solvable analytically , and assume that the sun - like star loses mass isotropically .",
    "@xcite showed that this approximation is excellent because latitudinal mass - loss variations anisotropically affect the planet s motion only if the mass loss is asymmetric about the stellar equator .",
    "unrealistic longitudinal variations ( of over 0.1% ) must be maintained for long periods ( over 1 myr ) in order to produce semimajor axis variations of order 0.1 au and eccentricity variations of order 0.01 .",
    "see their fig . 2 for rough magnitudes , although their choice of reference frame alters the interpretation of the orbital elements @xcite .",
    "the smaller the value of @xmath55 , the better that the semimajor axis evolution can be approximated in the adiabatic limit as    @xmath56    the goodness of this approximation can be quantified by the time variable mass loss index @xmath57 , introduced by equation 15 of @xcite as    @xmath58    the `` adiabatic regime '' is a useful characterisation for the regime which typically occurs when @xmath59 .",
    "consequently , a planet located at @xmath2 au should be approaching the edge of the adiabatic limit . in order to quantify this sentiment ,",
    "i have run simulations of a planet at different semimajor axes and two different eccentricities , for each of the three @xmath22 stellar models .",
    "[ adiasemi ] illustrates the results .",
    "the figure demonstrates how non - adiabaticity increases with initial ( or , main sequence values of ) @xmath55 . for @xmath60 , which has the slowest rate of mass loss of the three tracks that i sampled despite releasing the most mass overall ( see fig .",
    "[ sunevo ] ) , the adiabat is followed most closely ( within a few per cent ) for distances including and under @xmath2 au . in all cases ,",
    "the departure from adiabaticity is non - monotonic with increasing @xmath55 , and one system in the left panels and one in the right become unbound .",
    "such behaviour is explained further in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the systems sampled in fig .",
    "[ adiasemi ] fix the planet s initial argument of pericentre and mean anomaly ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "however , the value of these orbital elements is potentially of crucial importance .",
    "hence , in fig . [ adiaangles ] , i fixed the initial values of @xmath55 and @xmath62 and instead varied orbital angles .",
    "the almost straight lines of purple spades in all of the plots reveal that ( i ) this choice produces a notable deviation from the adiabatic limit , and ( ii ) for the particular initial fixed @xmath63 value of @xmath64 , changing the initial value of @xmath65 has little effect on the overall outcome .",
    "conversely , the scattered orange triangles and pink stars demonstrate a strong dependence on the planet s location along its orbit during the solar giant branch phase .",
    "as shown by the right panels , if the initial @xmath55 is large enough , then values of @xmath63 may be found which would lead to escape .    in both figs [ adiasemi ] and [ adiaangles ] the mass of the planet is not reported .",
    "the reason is that its mass is largely insensitive to the process of mass loss . in particular , because @xmath49 always appears in summation with @xmath10 in equations ( [ eqml3af])-([mlindex ] ) for all @xmath66 , the influence of planet mass on its resulting motion should enter at the @xmath67 level for jupiter - mass planets .",
    "the interplay between galactic tides and mass loss can be partitioned because each acts on a different timescale .",
    "@xcite concluded that in the solar neighbourhood the tidal timescale is orders of magnitude longer than the mass loss timescale , allowing one to decouple the equations of motion in each phase .",
    "in other words , one can use the tidal equations along the main sequence and white dwarf phases , and the mass loss equations alone along the giant branch phases .",
    "the consequences for long - term stability are highlighted in @xcite .",
    "consider a wide - orbit ( @xmath68  @xmath2 au ) planet whose pericentre during the main sequence is high enough to not perturb an inner planetary system .",
    "after mass loss , the orbit expands enough to cause galactic tides to excite the distant planet s eccentricity to the extent that the inner planetary system is now affected ( see , in particular , their fig .",
    "the eccentricity of the distant planet is likely to further change if during mass loss the planet is in the non - adiabatic regime ( see figs [ adiasemi ] and [ adiaangles ] ) .      by themselves , jupiter , saturn , uranus and neptune",
    "are not assumed to scatter off one another during the sun s evolution . in order to confirm this notion ,",
    "i have performed three simulations ( @xmath22 ) with the four giant planets only plus galactic tides .",
    "i ran these simulations throughout the giant branch phases and for 10 gyr on the white dwarf phase . in no case did the giant planets commence strong scattering .",
    "now consider the inclusion of a distant planet .",
    "although unimportant for galactic tides or stellar mass loss , the mass of the planet will crucially determine whether jupiter , saturn , uranus and neptune will be perturbed enough to cause large - scale instability in the solar system analogue .",
    "a distant planet which is comparable in mass to any of the known gas giants will likely create such an instability during a close encounter .",
    "what happens if the planet is a super - earth - mass planet is less clear . before exploring these possibilities ,",
    "i describe in detail the computational method used in this work and lay out the initial conditions for my simulations .",
    "in order to model the future evolution of a sun - like star concurrently with the dynamical evolution of jupiter , saturn , uranus , neptune analogues and a distant planet , i utilized a facility which has combined the stellar evolution code sse ( hurley et al . 2000 ) with a heavily modified version of the bulirsch - stoer integrator in the planetary dynamics code mercury @xcite .",
    "this combination has been shown to yield converging errors as the accuracy parameter decreases ( e.g. fig . 1 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the resulting code has been used in several previous studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "i adopt the version of the code that includes effects from galactic tides , and a realistic hill ellipsoid , in order to correctly track escape @xcite . for these computations",
    ", i assumed that the sun - like star resides at exactly 8  kpc away from the galactic centre .",
    "the hill ellipsoid is stretched towards the centre of the galaxy , and compressed along the other two axes . at a distance of 8",
    "kpc , the semi - axes of this ellipsoid are @xmath69 au . any planet which the code found to reside outside of this ellipsoid at any timestep was considered to have escaped from the planetary system .",
    "none of the @xmath49 values that i chose were large enough to alter these semi - axes .",
    "the sse code produces a single evolutionary track given a set of zero - age - main - sequence values of @xmath10 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "as previously mentioned , @xmath71 is a key unknown ( fig .",
    "[ sunevo ] ) . rather than adopting a single value , i chose three ( @xmath72 ) for the reasons outlined in section 2 .",
    "the timespan over which i ran the simulations was limited by computational resources because of the number of orbits that needed to be accurately modelled .",
    "this value is dependent on the parent star s mass and size of the orbits .",
    "hence , evolution during the white dwarf phase can proceed at a rate _ tens of times _ faster ( fig .",
    "8 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) than on the main sequence .",
    "this computational slowness along the main sequence ( together with the difficulty of self - consistently modelling multiple phases of stellar evolution ) partly illustrates why many post - main - sequence exoplanetary evolution studies have restricted their simulations to a timespan of under about 1 gyr ( debes & sigurdsson 2002 ; bonsor et al . 2011 ;",
    "debes et al . 2012 ; kratter & perets 2012 ; frewen & hansen 2014 ) .",
    "although multi - gyr simulations were later performed by @xcite and mustill et al .",
    "( 2014 ) , they had to restrict the main sequence stellar masses which they sampled to @xmath73 because of the correspondingly short main sequence lifetimes ( @xmath74 myr ) .",
    "nevertheless , @xcite and @xcite achieved full - lifetime ( 14 gyr ) simulations by adopting stars with main sequence masses between @xmath75 , and hence main sequence lifetimes of 600 myr to 3 gyr .",
    "however , the main sequence lifetime for a @xmath76 star is much longer , and approaches 11 gyr , meaning that the sun will remain on the main sequence for another 6.5 gyr or so .",
    "this timespan was too prohibitive for my numerical integrations .",
    "consequently , i began all my simulations just before the red giant branch phase",
    ". nevertheless , i ran these simulations for a total of 11.6 gyr , which included roughly 1.5 gyr on the giant branch phases , and 10 gyr on the white dwarf phase . in order to maximize resources , the occurrence of instability ( defined as ejection or collision ) terminated a simulation .",
    "i ran the simulations which generated figs [ adiasemi ] and [ adiaangles ] for just 1.55 gyr , because only the giant branch phases needed to be sampled .      regarding the planets , as mentioned previously , jupiter , saturn , uranus and",
    "neptune are expected to survive until the end of the main sequence in approximately their current orbits .",
    "their exact positions 6.5 gyr from now are not known ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , even if the errors in current measurements were as small as a planck length , because the outer solar system itself is chaotic with a lyapunov time of order 10 myr .",
    "hence , i simply adopted as initial conditions the values of @xmath36 , @xmath32 and @xmath77 of the planets at the julian date 2451000.5 that are provided within the default version of mercury .",
    "however , i treated their values of @xmath33 , @xmath35 , and @xmath34 differently .",
    "the code considers the galactic plane to exist at @xmath78 , and the relative inclination of each planet to that plane may be important when coupled with the distant planet s inclination and the effect of galactic tides . because the ecliptic is approximately inclined at an angle of @xmath42 to the planets , i reproduced faithful analogues by tilting the planetary systems so that the orbital planes are approximately centred about this value .",
    "i did so by applying the rotation matrix    @xmath79    to the cartesian elements ( positions and velocities ) of the four planets , and then transforming back into orbital element space ( this transformation does not affect @xmath36 , @xmath32 nor @xmath77 ) .",
    "the result was that the inclination values of the four planets ranged from @xmath80 to @xmath81 . because the sun - like stars were treated as point masses , they were not affected by , nor affected , this rotation .",
    "having laid out the background for my study , i am now ready to present my monte - carlo simulations .      in order to establish initial conditions , i consider each parameter in turn . in all cases ,",

    "consequently , the semimajor axis and eccentricity changes were predictable , and all planets were far away enough from each other such that they did not suffer close encounters .",
    "the eccentricities of the analogues of the four known giant planets mirrored their main sequence values and variations , whereas the distant planet s eccentricity was slightly noticeably altered : the amplitude of @xmath62 increased just after mass loss , and galactic tides did cause a barely perceptible secular change over 10 gyr of white dwarf evolution .",
    "+ the cartesian cross - sections ( bottom panels ) reveal how mass loss changes planetary orbits in space . for each planet , there are two distinct tori of points , corresponding to main sequence and white dwarf values . for the distant planet , a sparse intermediate ring of points can be seen , which corresponds to a transition state during the giant branch phase . * * figure [ eta8_86 ] ( unstable ) * here the distant planet s initial semimajor axis of about 2030 au was ( i ) small enough to achieve adiabatic mass loss , ( ii ) small enough to be unaffected by galactic tides on the main sequence and giant branch phases , ( iii ) and large enough to be affected by galactic tides non - negligibly on the white dwarf phase .",
    "regarding the first point , this semimajor axis lies within the solar system adiabaticity transition region of @xmath115 au , but remained adiabatic because here @xmath60 ( see fig .",
    "2 of @xcite ) .",
    "the modulation of @xmath62 due to galactic tides was high enough to be seen on the middle plot .",
    "this increase of eccentricity ( by about a tenth from 0.85 ) decreased @xmath102 ( bottom plot ) gradually , until close encounters pumped up the eccentricities of the uranus and neptune analogues , eventually ejecting the neptune - like planet and stopping the simulation .",
    "+ the value of @xmath102 became much lower than the orbital pericentres of the other planets before ejection .",
    "indicated on the right axis of the bottom plot are @xmath104 and @xmath105 , which represent the maximum radius that the star attained during the giant branch phase , and the roche , or disruption radius , of the white dwarf .",
    "for all plots , i computed this radius assuming a jupiter - mass planet . in this figure , @xmath114 .",
    "consequently , the distant planet swept through an area of space that had been untouched since the end of the giant branch phase .",
    "hence , extant debris from the inner system ( such as e.g. planets like mars , and remnants of asteroid belt - like breakups ; veras et al .",
    "2014a ) , could be perturbed towards the white dwarf and pollute it .",
    "this same behaviour was observed in @xcite and @xcite . *",
    "* figure [ eta5_31 ] ( stable ) * here the distant planet s initial semimajor axis of 2230 au is very similar to that in fig .",
    "[ eta8_86 ] , except in this instance the mass loss evolution was non - adiabatic .",
    "the reason partly is , for this simulation , @xmath16 ( see fig . 2 of @xcite ) .",
    "the resulting large jump in the value of @xmath55 , by nearly a factor of 10 , created a situation where galactic tides played a large role during white dwarf evolution . + whereas galactic tides slightly decreased @xmath62 on the main sequence and white dwarf phases , the large jump in @xmath55 created discernable oscillations during the white dwarf phase .",
    "if jupiter , saturn , uranus and neptune analogues were not present , then these oscillations would have had a constant amplitude and frequency . however , mutual interactions triggered semimajor axis `` jumps '' ( upper plot ) plus a corresponding change in shape of the eccentricity oscillations .",
    "further , over the first 7 gyr of white dwarf evolution , neptune - analogue s eccentricity increased by over an order of magnitude , to about 0.1 - 0.2 . nevertheless , over the duration of the simulation , the system remained stable .",
    "+ the bottom plot illustrates deep radial incursions ( within or close to @xmath104 ) of the distant planet towards the white dwarf : one at 10 gyr , and then four more from 14 - 18 gyr . these illustrate how a dynamically - active inner planetary system environment can be triggered at any white dwarf age , potentially explaining white dwarf pollution at different epochs @xcite .",
    "+    +    * * figure [ eta5_22 ] ( unstable ) * a highly eccentric ( @xmath116 ) distant planet with @xmath117 au is likely to generate interesting dynamical behaviour because it is sure to evolve non - adiabatically from mass loss and always is affected significantly by galactic tides . for this system , these attributes provided an environment which was conducive to strong scattering events , allowing the analogue of uranus to be `` captured '' into a @xmath3 au orbit .",
    "this orbit existed for an appreciable 5 gyr ",
    "longer than the solar system s current age  before the analogue of uranus was ejected .",
    "+ some other noteworthy dynamical aspects of this @xmath16 system are : ( i ) the change in frequency of the distant planet s eccentricity oscillations from the giant branch to white dwarf phases ( due to semimajor axis increase ) , ( ii ) the uranus - like planet achieving an orbit with a pericentre of nearly 1 au at the end of the red giant branch phase ( but before the asymptotic giant branch phase ) ; this fact places a significant caveat on this figure because tidal interactions with the star ( not modelled ) could have retarded the planet s evolution during this stage @xcite , ( iii ) neptune , jupiter and saturn analogues settling into orbits whose secular eccentricity evolution was well - behaved , compared to that from any other figures . * * figure [ eta2_66 ] ( stable ) * in this figure , @xmath85  @xmath97  @xmath113  au , a value 59 per cent greater than the corresponding value in fig . [ eta5_22 ] , and the initial eccentricities in both figures coincidentally differed by just @xmath118 per cent . despite these values , the amplitude of the eccentricity oscillations due to galactic tides in this figure was not as high .",
    "the reason is because of the distant planet s other orbital parameters : @xmath119 , @xmath65 , and @xmath120 all played a significant , non - trivial role .",
    "+ regardless , the pericentre passages were deep enough to coincide with the orbits of the four giant planet analogues .",
    "one of these passages occurred close to the tip of the asymptotic giant branch ( whereas in fig .",
    "[ eta5_22 ] a passage occurred close to the tip of the red giant branch ) .",
    "the resulting scattering event helped contribute to @xmath55 s net negligible change at the giant branch / white dwarf boundary , and triggered a semimajor axis increase for the analogue of neptune to almost @xmath3 au after a few hundred myr .",
    "neptune - analogue s eccentricity then became strongly affected by galactic tides .",
    "subsequently , both the neptune - like planet and the distant planet experienced repeated radial incursions  at different rates  providing a dynamically active and ever - changing environment potentially conducive to pollution .",
    "the uranus , saturn and jupiter analogues were not bothered by this activity , and the system remained stable for the duration of the simulation .      the primary goal of this study is to determine the stability boundary : for what mass and orbital parameters of a distant planet will instability occur . amongst the different potential combinations of variables to plot , i found that the most revealing combinations are those seen in fig .",
    "the figure reveals the following points .    *",
    "any potentially sharp boundary is limited to the blue triangle in the upper - left plot ; in this triangle every system sampled was stable .",
    "even so , just a few tens of simulations within that triangle were performed .",
    "otherwise , unstable and stable simulations appear on all regions of all plots , showcasing how sensitive the simulation outcome is to all orbital parameters , including @xmath120 , @xmath65 and @xmath63 .",
    "+ the blue triangle makes sense : although the notion that smaller values of @xmath55 would yield greater stability might seem counterintuitive , in fact such values guarantee that the mass loss evolution is adiabatic and that galactic tides play no significant role in the dynamics .",
    "also , the greater the value of @xmath49 , the more likely that the distant planet could scatter off of the other planets and create instability . *",
    "mass aside , stability is more generally likely to occur than not when @xmath85 is within a few thousand au , as indicated by the orange regions .",
    "the reason is the same as above .",
    "* there is no discernable stability dependence on @xmath71 ( for values between 0.2 and 0.8 ) .",
    "* there is no discernable stability dependence on @xmath102 ( for values between 100 and 400 au ) .",
    "* there is no discernable stability dependence on @xmath119 ( for values within @xmath121 below and above the ecliptic ) .",
    "other trends from the ensemble of plots include details of the instability : 97 per cent of all unstable simulations featured ejections .",
    "the remainder were engulfments ( defined to occur when a planet intersected the star s roche radius ) . in no case",
    "did the jupiter - like planet become unstable .",
    "the analogues of saturn , uranus and neptune and the distant planet were either ejected or engulfed 8 , 53 , 24 and 15 per cent of the time , respectively .",
    "this result makes sense given that in almost every simulation , the analogue of uranus was the least massive planet .",
    "@xcite showed that scattering amongst unequal - mass planets across all phases of stellar evolution will preferentially eject the least massive planet ( just as along the main sequence alone ) .",
    "i demonstrated that a distant planet with an orbital pericentre under 400 au could pose a serious danger to the stability of solar system analogues during a sun - like star s giant branch and white dwarf phases .",
    "this statement holds true for a distant planet which is at least as massive as jupiter and harbours a semimajor axis beyond about 300 au , or for a super - earth when its semimajor axis exceeds about 3000 au .",
    "the driver for the instability is a combination of galactic tides and stellar mass loss , which together or separately may induce close encounters amongst the five planets , with the distant planet always representing the trigger .",
    "these results have implications for both the solar system and for extrasolar systems",
    ". the existence of a trans - neptunian planet could eventually eliminate ( likely through ejection ) at least one of the giant planets ( most likely uranus , then neptune ) and rearrange the others , but only if this `` extra '' planet is massive enough , distant enough and its orbit is appropriately oriented with respect to the galactic plane and the existing giants .",
    "this planet may represent the purported planet nine , a hidden other planet , or a planet that will be captured later during the sun s main sequence evolution . because the sun will become a white dwarf and contain strewn - about debris from a destroyed asteroid belt ( veras et al .",
    "2014a ) plus a charred mars and perhaps some liberated moons @xcite , an ample reservoir of extant material in the inner solar system would be available to be perturbed into the solar white dwarf , `` polluting '' it .",
    "the consequences for other planetary systems are profound .",
    "multiple planets beyond about 5 au ( such as analogues of jupiter , saturn , uranus and neptune ) may be common , but are so far unfortunately effectively hidden from detection by doppler radial velocity and transit photometry techniques , the two most successful planet - finding techniques .",
    "if more distant , trans - neptunian - like planets are also common , then the ingredients may exist to regularly generate instability and a frequently - changing dynamical environment during white dwarf phases of evolution . such movement could provide a natural way to perturb inner system debris into white dwarfs at a variety of white dwarf ages and rates , helping to explain current observations .",
