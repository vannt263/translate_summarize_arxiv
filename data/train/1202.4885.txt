    "it is usually called anomalous three - boson interaction and it is considered for long time on phenomenological grounds  @xcite .",
    "note , that the first attempt to obtain the anomalous three - boson interaction in the framework of bogoliubov approach was done in work  @xcite .",
    "our interaction constant @xmath12 is connected with conventional definitions in the following way @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the electro - weak coupling .",

    "the former experience concerning both applications to nambu  jona - lasinio model in qcd  @xcite and to the electro - weak interaction  @xcite shows that average accuracy of the method is around 10% in values of different parameters .",
    "so we may assume , that in the present estimations of coupling constant @xmath93 we also have the same accuracy .",
    "for the cross - section this means possible deviation up to 20% of the calculated value .",
    "thus we would change  ( [ cs0 ] ) to the following result @xmath94 branching ratios  ( [ decay ] ) do not depend on the value of @xmath93 , so we assume their accuracy being considerably better than in  ( [ cs1 ] )",

    "has no contradiction with data as well as the usual sm higgs boson interpretation . in the future more precise experiments at lhc the essential distinctions of our scheme and the sm higgs boson variant could manifest themselves and decisively discriminate different variants .",
    "the distinctions refer to @xmath99  ( [ cs1 ] ) and also to the four - lepton channel  ( [ fl ] ) .",
    "we would emphasize importance of channel @xmath100 .",
    "for this decay mode from  ( [ section ] , [ decay ] ) we predict @xmath101 that gives @xmath102 events for already achieved luminosity  @xcite .",
    "this channel may serve for an accurate test of our results because the sm value for quantity  ( [ all ] ) gives around 5 events  @xcite .",
    "there is one point in data  @xcite , which provides hints against the sm option and , on the contrary , on behalf of our variant .",
    "there are data of  @xcite dealing with two - jets tag , which singles channel of @xmath103 production via vector boson fusion .",
    "we calculate the effect for this channel within our approach and obtain @xmath104 . taking into account  ( [ decay ] ) and efficiency in  @xcite for such process @xmath105 we obtain @xmath106 events of @xmath6 decay of @xmath46 , what by no means contradict cms data ( see  @xcite , fig .",
    "the estimate for the sm higgs gives here less than one event .",
    "of course , there is no contradiction yet , but nevertheless we may state a trend for better agreement with data of the present variant .",
    "the main difference of our predictions with the sm results consist in decay channel @xmath107 . for sm higgs",
    "which is usually considered for explanation of would - be @xmath4 state this decay is dominant , whereas our result  ( [ decay ] ) gives extremely small @xmath108 .",
    "we would emphasize that sm higgs interpretation could not be considered as proved unless @xmath109 channel with the proper intensity would be detected .",
    "thus we have an alternative interpretation of lhc @xmath4 phenomenon .",
    "the overall data do not contradict both the sm higgs option and the scalar w - hadron , which we discuss here .",
    "however our estimates of the effects are as a rule rather more than the sm higgs predictions .",
    "it seems , that data favor just larger values .",
    "the forthcoming increasing of the integral luminosity will undoubtedly discriminate this two options . in case of future result being in favor of scalar w - hadron ,",
