    "both are permeated by magnetic fields .",
    "these fields are strong ( of order 1 kg ) in the ne and much weaker ( of order 1 hg ) in the in ( for reviews see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) . because of their abundance ,",
    "qs magnetic fields play a crucial role in the energy budget of the solar atmosphere .",
    "thus , it is important to understand their nature and how they are maintained on the solar surface .",
    "an important open question is the origin of the ne . in polarized light ,",

    "high sensitivity is needed to detect them because they produce tiny polarization signals .",
    "for this reason their properties are not well known",
    ". however , there are indications that , at any time , the weak in elements may carry up to half of the qs magnetic flux @xcite , which testifies to their importance . the flux appearance rates inferred in the in vary from the @xmath6  mx  day@xmath1 of @xcite to the @xmath7  mx  day@xmath1 of @xcite and the @xmath8  mx  day@xmath1 of @xcite .",
    "these values imply that small - scale in features bring to the surface considerably more flux than active regions during the maximum of the solar cycle ( @xmath9  mx  day@xmath1 ; * ? ? ?",
    "in elements have mean lifetimes of less than 10 minutes @xcite and many never leave the in , but others survive long enough to reach the ne and deposit their flux there @xcite .",
    "how exactly they contribute to the ne flux is still unknown .",
    "the current paradigm is that ephemeral regions ( ers ) , and not in fields , are the primary source of flux for the ne .",
    "discovered by @xcite , ers are bipolar features with fluxes in the range @xmath10  mx and lifetimes of 34 hours @xcite . they can be considered as the largest and strongest in features , comparable to individual ne patches .",
    "@xcite stated without proof that 90% of the ne flux concentrations come from ers , while the weaker in elements contribute only 10% of the ne flux .",
    "@xcite developed a set of equations to model the distribution and evolution of the ne flux taking into account the balance between flux emergence , fragmentation , merging , and cancellation .",
    "based on @xcite claim , they neglected in elements as a source of flux for the ne and only considered ers , determining their flux emergence rate to be @xmath11  mx  day@xmath1 from data taken by the michelson doppler imager ( mdi ) aboard the soho satellite @xcite .",
    "@xcite concluded that bipolar ers alone can explain the flux of the ne , with only a small fraction of the ne originating from active regions .",
    "indeed they found that the total ne flux could be replaced by newly emerged ers in 1.53 days .",
    "the ratio of the total ne flux to the er flux appearance rate also gave a flux replacement time of 72 hours . using a kinematic model ,",
    "@xcite studied the transport of er fragments by granular and supergranular flows and verified that the injection of bipolar ers at the observed rates would lead to a statistically stable ne .",
    "@xcite confirmed the importance of ers for the maintenance of the ne and inferred flux replacement times of 819 hours , also using mdi observations .",
    "later , @xcite revised this value down to only 12 hours based on high - resolution mdi magnetograms .    despite the large differences in the reported flux replacement times ,",
    "all authors seem to agree that ers are the main source of flux for the ne .",
    "however , most of the analyses neglect the contribution of the weak in elements  those with fluxes below @xmath5  mx , because the sensitivity and spatial resolution of mdi is insufficient to detect them .",
    "thus , a potentially important source of flux is not accounted for .",
    "@xcite suggested that the in elements hidden to mdi may actually supply more flux to the ne than ers .    in this paper",
    "we determine the contribution of the in to the ne using very long time sequences of magnetograms recorded with the narrowband filter imager ( nfi ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) aboard the hinode satellite @xcite .",
    "our observations are ideally suited to investigate the transfer of flux from the in to the ne because they show the evolution of in elements and their interaction with the ne on time scales from minutes to days , covering most of the lifetime of supergranular cells .",
    "thus , we can study the flux history of individual cells and the network regions surrounding them at unprecedented sensitivity , spatial resolution , and cadence .",
    "all these ingredients are needed to determine the instantaneous flux that is transferred from the in to the ne and how it varies with time . in paper",

    "this step reduced the area of the observed regions to @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "solar rotation was compensated during the data acquisition , so as to monitor the evolution of the same quiet sun region for as long as possible .",
    "both sequences contain several supergranular cells and ne areas ( see figure  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the observations were corrected for dark current and flatfield following standard procedures . to generate gain tables we averaged all the intensity filtergrams of each sequence . from the corrected circular polarization and intensity images we calculated longitudinal magnetograms as @xmath19 , where r and b denote the red and blue line wings .",
    "the magnetogram signal was converted into magnetic flux density as @xmath20 .",
    "we determined the calibration constant to be @xmath21  mx using the weak field approximation and the numerical value of @xmath22 derived from the intensity profile of the 589.6  nm line in the fts atlas @xcite .",
    "in addition , we computed dopplergrams as @xmath23 .",
    "the dopplergrams were transformed into line - of - sight velocities applying a linear relationship obtained by shifting the atlas profile by known amounts .    to remove systematic changes of the magnetogram signal resulting from the hinode orbital variations , we calculated the distribution of magnetic flux densities for each frame of the sequence .",
    "the core of the distribution was fitted with a gaussian assuming that it represents photon noise .",
    "any deviation of the central position of the gaussian from zero was subtracted from all the pixels of the corresponding frame .",
    "the observed offsets are periodic and show rms values of less than 1.4  g.    five minute oscillations were removed from the magnetogram and dopplergram time sequences by applying a subsonic filter .",
    "the noise of the magnetograms was @xmath24 mx @xmath16 at that stage , as computed in a region without solar signals . to reduce the noise even further , we spatially smoothed the magnetograms using a 3@xmath253 kernel of the form @xmath26 this corresponds to a truncated gaussian distribution with a full width at half maximum of 2 pixels , which is smaller than the size of the magnetic features studied in the present paper .",
    "the result is a minimal degradation of the spatial resolution but a significant improvement of the noise down to @xmath27  mx  @xmath16 .",
    "such a low noise level permits a more reliable identification of the weakest in magnetic features and their association between consecutive magnetograms .",
    "in magnetic elements transfer their flux to the ne through interactions with ne features . to study how they contribute to the maintenance of the ne , we have to identify and track magnetic patches in the magnetogram time sequences , classify them as in or ne elements , look for the in features that interact with ne patches , and determine how much flux they add to or remove from the ne .",
    "these steps are described in detail below .",
    "we use the yafta code @xcite to detect and track magnetic patches in the magnetogram time sequences .",
    "the detection algorithm is based on the clumping method , which groups together all contiguous like - polarity pixels with absolute flux densities above a specified threshold and marks them as a unique element @xcite .",
    "we set a flux density threshold of 12  mx @xmath16 ( 3@xmath28 ) , a minimum size of 4 pixels , and a duration of at least 2 frames to consider one such clump as a real magnetic feature .",
    "magnetic elements are in constant motion and often interact with other features , gaining or losing flux , until they eventually disappear from the solar surface .",
    "the following processes need to be considered to track their evolution :    1 .   _ in - situ appearance _ , the process by which new flux elements become visible in the magnetograms .",
    "all the elements are counted individually , regardeless of their nature .",
    "thus , the footpoints of emerging bipoles are taken to be independent entities in the same way as other unipolar patches .",
    "_ merging _ , or the coalescence of two or more elements of the same polarity into a larger structure . in this process ,",
    "only the largest element survives , in the sense that it is the one tracked in the following frame .",
    "the smaller elements are considered disappeared features .",
    "the flux they contain is incorporated into the surviving element .",
    "fragmentation _ , the opposite of merging , occurs when an element splits into two or more smaller features ( children ) .",
    "cancellation _ , or the disappearance of a magnetic element in the vicinity of an opposite - polarity feature . through cancellations ,",
    "magnetic flux is removed from the photosphere .",
    "_ in - situ disappearance _",
    ", the process whereby magnetic elements disappear from the solar surface without an obvious interaction with any other feature .",
    "yafta assigns a unique label to each feature .",
    "these labels allow us to trace back the history and origin of the elements detected in the magnetograms .",
    "however , a careful analysis is needed because individual elements may change their labels several times due to interactions .",
    "for example , features lose their labels when they merge with a stronger flux patch , cancel completely with an opposite - polarity element , or disappear in situ .",
    "likewise , the fragments of a feature get new labels except the stronger one , which maintains the label of the parent .",
    "our strategy is to keep track of all the interactions to avoid counting the same element more than once .",
    "we also correct the yafta results in special cases involving complex interactions .",
    "such cases are described in section  [ contribution ] .      to identify ne and in regions ,",
    "some authors use criteria based on the flux density and/or size of the magnetic elements .",
    "however , the separation is difficult because the qs flux distribution is continuous and does not show a clear boundary between the in and ne @xcite . to avoid the uncertainties associated with the use of a fixed flux threshold , we define the in as the interior of supergranular cells .",
    "the space beyond the in is the ne .",
    "supergranular cells are found using the dopplergram time sequences .",
    "we divide them in 2  h intervals and apply local correlation tracking ( lct ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to each subsequence .",
    "the lct algorithm calculates horizontal velocities by comparing small subfields in two successive images .",
    "the subfields are defined by a gaussian tracking window of full width at half - maximum of 60 pixels ( @xmath29 ) . with this criterion",
    "we suppress small - scale convective patterns , keeping only the large - scale supergranular flows . from the resulting horizontal velocity field",
    "we calculate divergence maps . in regions",
    "are identified by tracking the evolution of passively advected tracers ( corks ) on the divergence maps .",
    "assuming that the ne flux is located at the edges of supergranules , we manually define the in following the cork distributions and avoiding strong magnetic flux structures . to obtain a smooth transition of the cell boundaries from one subsequence to the next we use linear interpolation .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows examples of separated ne and in regions for data sets 1 and 2 , with the pink contours representing the boundaries between the in and the ne .",
    "magnetic features that appear in the interior of supergranular cells ( i.e. , inside the boundaries defined above ) are taken to be in elements .",
    "elements born by fragmentation of an in element are also classified as in patches . in elements",
    "keep their character unless they merge with ne features , in which case they become part of the ne and are tagged accordingly .",
    "the identification of ne patches is more involved . in the first frame ,",
    "elements that have their flux - weighted centers ( fwc ) inside of a ne region are considered to be ne features .",
    "also , only in the first frame , elements that are touching a ne region are counted as ne elements because we do not know their history .    for all @xmath30 frames ,",
    "magnetic features are marked as ne elements if they overlap more than 70@xmath31 with ne structures from the previous @xmath32 frame or if their fwcs are located inside any of the ne patches detected in the @xmath32 frame .",
    "when an element appears by fragmentation , it is considered to belong to the ne if its parent is already marked as a ne structure . at any time ,",
    "an element that appears in situ inside the ne is considered to be part of the ne .",
    "merging and cancellation are the only two processes through which in elements can modify the flux of the ne .",
    "these processes involve a direct interaction between in and ne elements . in features that merge with ne patches add flux to the ne , while those canceling with opposite - polarity elements remove flux from the ne .",
    "their respective contributions are determined as follows .",
    "when an in element merges with a ne patch , the flux it contributes to the ne is calculated in the frame where it is visible as an individual feature for the last time .",
    "we consider only the pixels of the in element that do not overlap with any of the ne patches of the previous frame , to avoid including ne flux due to fragments that yafta may have erroneously added to the in feature .",
    "a detection problem arises when in flux from the previous frame converts into ne flux in the current frame , without ever being recognized by yafta as a unique magnetic element .",
    "this happens when some portion of an in element fragments from its parent and merges with a ne patch between two consecutive frames . to find and count such events , we calculate the difference between logical masks of ne elements in frame @xmath33 and frame @xmath32 .",
    "all pixels different from zero in the difference mask are assigned the flux densities they had in frame @xmath33 . on such `` partial '' magnetogram we apply the downhill method .",
    "this method finds all contiguous like - polarity pixels above a given threshold that lie on the same flux peak @xcite .",
    "every flux structure larger than 16 pixels exceeding a signal threshold of 3@xmath28 is taken to be a magnetic element .",
    "finally , we dilate these features to the nearest neighboring pixel .",
    "if they overlap the ne mask from the current frame and their fwcs are not located inside of the ne region , they are counted as contributing in fragments that were not detected by the code .    a similar situation occurs when an in element merges with a ne fragment which is not detected by yafta as an individual feature because the fragmentation and the merging take place in the same frame . for yafta , the in element continues to be an in element of increased flux and size . if the ne fragment had more flux than the in patch , however , their common fwc will more likely be located inside the ne feature of the previous frame from which the fragment detached , and our method will recognize the entire element as a ne patch . to evaluate the in contribution in this case , and reject the ne portion of the flux ,",
    "we apply the downhill method described above .",
    "a complex example of an in element merging with ne patches is shown in figure  [ merging ] .",
    "this element interacts with other in features during the sequence ( e.g. , at @xmath34 and 15.0  min ) .",
    "the red contours indicate the flux contributed to the ne by each of the in elements .",
    "cancellation events are found by searching for all closely located , opposite - polarity elements that disappear in the current frame .",
    "more precisely , we take an in element at the moment of disappearance , dilate its border by 2 pixels and , if it overlaps a ne patch of opposite polarity , count the in element as a canceling flux feature . to determine how much flux it removes from the ne",
    ", we go back in time and take the total flux of the in element at the moment when the cancellation started ( i.e , when the in patch touched the opposite - polarity ne element for the first time ) .",
    "this flux is corrected for all the changes caused by the merging and fragmentation processes that might happen during the cancellation event .",
    "the same procedure is repeated for ne elements that disappear by cancellation with in elements .",
    "the latter may survive the process , but they remove flux from the ne . their contribution is taken to be the flux of the ne patch at the beginning of the cancellation .    in fig .",
    "[ cancellation ] we show an example of an in feature canceling with ne patches and how the interaction is interpreted .",
    "the identification of in elements merging or canceling with ne features is carried out in the following way . in frame",
    "@xmath33 we examine all the ne and in elements that lose their labels and disappear as individual entities .",
    "we check whether they merged or canceled with another element .",
    "only if the interaction involves an in element and a ne patch do we count the former as contributing to the ne . in the case of mergings , the flux carried by the in patch in frame @xmath32 is assumed to be transferred to the ne in frame @xmath33 . in the case of cancellations , the initial flux of the element that disappears completely is taken to be the contribution of the in to the ne in frame @xmath33 .",
    "this method covers the situation in which in elements merge with weak ne fragments .",
    "being dominant in flux they keep their labels , but they must be considered part of the ne from that moment on ( as well as their children in case of fragmentation ) .",
    "therefore , we tag them as ne patches , except when they are inside the in .",
    "this is done for computational convenience  otherwise they would quickly turn all in patches into ne features through mergings with other elements inside the supergranular cell . in features not tagged as ne",
    "patches are considered to contribute to the ne if they enter a ne region or end their lives interacting with a ne patch .",
    "the procedure just described determines the flux transferred to the ne taking into account only the first interaction . in elements that cancel",
    "completely remove flux from the ne and can not undergo further interactions , so their contribution is estimated correctly .",
    "however , in the case of mergings our calculations provide only an upper limit .",
    "the reason is that an in element may first merge with a ne patch and later cancel with another ne patch , so that part of it would actually remove rather than add flux to the ne .",
    "unfortunately , once the element loses its identity because of the merging there is no way to know whether this occurs at all .",

    "both time sequences exhibit a pronounced ne flux imbalance that may reach up to @xmath46  mx .",
    "the figures in table  [ table2 ] do not reflect the number of unique elements in the magnetograms because many of them are counted multiple times by yafta .",
    "our analysis is not affected by this behavior because we are interested only in in features interacting with ne elements .",

    "individual supergranular cells are appearing , evolving , and disappearing in the time sequences , but the fov is sufficiently large as for the results not to depend on the variations of single cells .    the total ne and in fluxes in data set 1 are on average @xmath47  mx and @xmath48  mx , respectively . for data set 2 ,",
    "the corresponding values are @xmath49  mx and @xmath50  mx .",
    "thus , 14% of the total qs ( ne@xmath51 in ) flux is in the form of in elements .",

    "their sum is indicated by the black curve .",
    "the data have been binned over 15 minutes .",
    "each bin represents the in flux contributed to the ne during that period of time .",
    "as can be seen , the total in contribution to the ne shows some variations over the 19.5  h of observation , but it is relatively constant at about @xmath53  mx  h@xmath1 in the full fov , or @xmath54  mx  day@xmath1 over the entire solar surface . clearly , the in is more efficient in injecting flux than in removing it .",
    "merging of like - polarity patches is the dominant process and involves 3.8 times more flux than cancellations .    in the bottom panel of figure [ fig5 ]",
    "we show the cumulative in contribution to the ne considering all the flux deposited in the ne ( solid line ) and the net flux gained by the ne ( dashed line ) .",
    "the former is the total in flux that actually interacts with ne patches , independently of the final outcome of the interaction .",

    "most  but not all  of that flux is incorporated into the ne . considering only the net flux that remains in the ne ( dashed line ) ,",
    "the in needs some 18  h to supply as much flux as is present in the ne at any one time .",
    "the in contribution to the ne flux in data set  2 is shown in figure  [ fig6 ] .",
    "just like in the first data set , mergings dominate over cancellations by a factor of 3.6 , the result being that the in adds flux to the ne continually ( top panel ) . on average",
    ", the in contributes a total of @xmath56  mx  h@xmath1 to the ne in the observed fov , or @xmath57  mx  day@xmath1 over the entire solar surface .",

    "the in transfers as much flux as the ne contains in 13.5  h , or in some 24  h considering only the net contribution to the ne .",
    "thus , the in continually supplies flux to the ne .",
    "since the total ne flux does not change with time , flux must be removed from the ne at a similar rate through cancellations and in - situ disappearances . however , a detailed analysis of such processes is beyond the scope of this paper , as it would require careful interpretation of the yafta results in the extremely crowded and dynamic regions of the ne . first attempts to quantify the interactions between magnetic elements in the ne have been presented by @xcite .",
    "the current paradigm is that ers provide the flux needed to maintain the network .",
    "our very long magnetogram sequences can be used to determine the percentage of the in flux transferred to the ne that is due to ers . detecting ers in the hinode magnetograms",
    "is difficult because yafta does not recognize the presence of large - scale structures . to circumvent this problem",
    ", we manually identified ers as clusters of mixed - polarity flux patches appearing together and separating from each other with time . to qualify as an er , at least one element in the cluster had to reach a flux content of @xmath58  mx , the threshold set by @xcite .",
    "the individual er patches were then tracked and counted as contributing to the ne if they had interactions with ne patches .",
    "we detected five ers in data set 1 and nine in data set 2 , roughly consistent with the appearance rate of 430 per hour estimated by @xcite over the entire solar surface .",
    "the black curves in figure  [ fig7 ] show the total in contribution to the ne already displayed in the top panels of figures  5 and 6 . for each 15 minute bin",
    "we separate the flux transferred to the ne by isolated in patches ( gray shaded areas ) and er patches ( orange shaded areas ) .",
    "as can be seen , ers play only a minor role in the flux transfer from the in to the ne .",
    "they inject about @xmath59  mx  day@xmath1 into the in , but this is less than @xmath558% of the total in flux that reaches the ne in the two data sets .",
    "thus , despite the large amount of flux they carry , ers are not the main contributors to the ne flux .",
    "more than 90% of the flux comes from weak , isolated in patches .      after appearing in the interior of supergranular cells , in elements migrate toward the cell boundaries where the ne resides .",
    "however , not all in elements end up in the ne , since many of them disappear in situ or cancel with other in elements before reaching the ne .",
    "here we study what fraction of the in flux actually makes it to the ne .",
    "the black curves in figure  [ frac ] show the temporal evolution of the in flux in the entire fov of data sets 1 and 2 .",
    "the total flux carried by the in patches that interact with the ne at any later time is indicated with the red curves . for this calculation",
    "we take into account all fragmentations and partial cancellations that the elements may undergo before interacting with the ne .",
    "close to the end of each continuous observing periods there are artificial drops of the in flux contributing to the ne .",
    "they reflect the lack of information about the evolution of in elements during the data gaps",
    ". some of the elements may interact with the ne , but they are not counted because it is not possible to identify them , producing drops in the curves .    on average , we find that 38% of the in flux generated in the interior of supergranules eventually contribute to the ne .",
    "both data sets show very similar percentages .",
    "the rest of elements disappear inside the in by cancellations or in - situ fading and never reach the ne ( see paper ii of this series by goi & bellot rubio , in preparation ) .",
    "thus , a significant fraction of the observed in flux is incorporated into the ne , emphasizing the importance of the in for the maintenance  and arguably also the existence  of the magnetic ne .",
    "we have analyzed magnetic flux elements in ne and in regions using long - duration , high - resolution hinode / nfi magnetogram sequences .",
    "we carefully processed the data to facilitate the tracking of magnetic features and the identification of patches after interactions .",
    "these measurements give us the opportunity to study for the first time the evolution of qs magnetic fields in the range @xmath60 mx on scales from minute to days . after identifying ne and in flux concentrations",
    ", we followed them with an automatic tracking algorithm to examine how the in contributes flux to the ne .",
    "we calculated the transfer of in flux to the ne in a direct way , using the instantaneous flux of the in elements that interact with ne patches .    in our observations , the total in and ne",
    "fluxes are very stable and exhibit only small variations with time . in regions",
    "are in nearly perfect polarity balance .",
    "by contrast , ne regions show clear polarity imbalances in both data sets . on average ,",
    "14% of the qs flux is in the form of in elements .",
    "this value is consistent with the estimates of @xcite .",
    "the instantaneous ratio , however , varies in the range from 10% up to 20% .",
    "our definition of ne and in elements is based on spatial location  derived from horizontal flow maps  rather than on flux densities or sizes .",
    "this may have resulted in lower percentages because some small - scale in elements were probably labeled as ne features .",
    "if flux density or size criteria had been used instead , those elements would have more likely been recognized as in elements . however , as they appear close to ne patches in supergranular downflows , it seems reasonable to mark them as ne fragments .",
    "we have shown that in elements continuously supply flux to the ne , confirming the prediction by @xcite that it should be possible to observe interactions between ne and in elements on spatial scales not accessible to mdi .",
    "we estimate that up to 38% of the magnetic flux appearing inside supergranular cells moves toward the edges of supergranules and interact with the ne . in features merge or cancel with preexisting ne patches , adding or removing flux from the ne .",
    "the first process is dominant , by a factor of 3.63.8 .",
    "the in contributes a total flux of @xmath61  mx  day@xmath1 to the ne .",
    "thus , in regions can generate and transfer as much magnetic flux as is present in ne regions in only 913  h. taking into account that not all elements add flux to the ne , the time needed by the in to supply a net flux equal to that present in the ne is 18 - 24 hours .",
    "our estimates of the in contribution to the ne flux are more accurate than those based on flux emergence or disappearance rates .",
    "this is because we directly measure how much flux converts into ne flux or cancels with ne elements instantaneously , whereas flux emergence and cancellation rates include a fraction of elements that never interact with the ne and therefore should not be counted . in our data sets , the temporal scales on which the in could supply as much flux as is contained in the ne are shorter than the 3672  h reported by @xcite , but also significantly longer than the lower limit of 1  h found by @xcite .",
    "both analyses used soho / mdi data , and therefore could not see most of the in flux .",
    "our observations made it possible to determine in a direct way the actual contribution of ers to the ne flux . to estimate the flux they transfer to the ne we have considered as ers all the clusters of mixed - polarity patches emerging in the same area with at least one of the patches reaching @xmath62  mx . during the approximately 58 hours of monitoring of the quiet sun performed with the hinode nfi we see 14 ers .",
    "we find that ers transfer flux to the network at a rate of @xmath59  mx  day@xmath1 , which is only slightly larger than the er emergence rate of @xmath63  mx  day@xmath1 reported by @xcite but less than 8% of the total in contribution to the ne found here .",
    "this entails a change of paradigm , as most of the in flux transferred to the ne seems to come from weak , isolated in elements and not from ers .",
    "the main result of this work is that ne regions receive a substantial and constant flux inflow from the solar in . actually , small - scale in elements appear to be the main and most permanent source of flux for the ne .",
    "their origin however remains poorly understood . to shed light on this issue",
    ", we will determine the flux appearance and disappearance rates in the in in paper ii of this series , while paper iii will be devoted to study the modes of appearance of in elements on the solar surface .",
    "this paper is based on data acquired in the framework of the hinode operation plan 151 , _",
    "`` flux replacement in the solar network and internetwork''_. we thank the hinode chief observers for the efforts they made to accommodate our demanding observations .",
