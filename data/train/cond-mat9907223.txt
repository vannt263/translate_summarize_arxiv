    " pseudogaps  , i.e. a suppression of the low - energy electronic density of states due to an interaction effect , are of current interest in the context of high-@xmath0 superconductivity @xcite and of low - dimensional organic materials @xcite and are relevant to the theory of liquid metals @xcite , and to the issue of spin waves above @xmath1 in ferromagnets@xcite .",
    "one general mechanism for producing pseudogaps involves the presence of long but not infinite range order , for example of the superconducting or density wave type .",
    "consider , for definiteness , a one dimensional material exhibiting long ranged charge density wave order at @xmath2 . at @xmath3 thermal fluctuations prevent long ranged order but at low @xmath4 the order parameter fluctuates very slowly in space and time .",
    "it therefore has significant amplitude to back - scatter electrons .",
    "the back - scattering will tend to open a gap but will not do so completely because the order is not perfect .",
    "very similar issues come up in the physics of liquid metals @xcite , where the ions are highly correlated and move slowly in comparison to the electrons , in the theory of superconductivity , where slow cooper pairing fluctuations mix particle and hole states ( instead of left and right movers ) and again tend to open a gap , and in ferromagnets at temperatures slightly above @xmath1 , slow magnetization fluctuations may suppress electron - hole spin excitations and allow weakly damped spin waves to exist@xcite .",
    "a crucial , but still unresolved , question concerns the proper method of calculation of physical quantities in the presence of long - range - correlated scattering .",
    "a simple and physically appealing approximation was proposed in 1973 by lee , rice and anderson @xcite , who argued that one need only consider the leading perturbative one - boson - exchange diagram for the self - energy . within this approximation",
    "the low energy density of states was constant , but was suppressed from the non - interacting value by a factor proportional to the inverse of the correlation length of the scatterers .",
    "subsequent workers used different approximations and obtained different results .",
    "in particular , sadovskii obtained a continued - fraction expression which led , for the problem studied in @xcite to a low energy density of states which varied as the square root of the correlation length @xcite .",
    "however , sadovskii s results have recently been called in to question by tchernyshyov @xcite who exhibited a class of diagrams neglected by sadovskii .",
    "a yet different set of approximations , the fluctuation exchange or flex approximation @xcite has been employed by many authors to study pseudogap effects in models of superconductivity @xcite , and these treatments have in turn been questioned @xcite .    in order to clarify this situation",
    ", we present results of a thorough numerical and analytical study of a simple model exhibiting pseudogap effects , namely electrons moving in one spatial dimension and coupled to a backscattering potential which is constant in time but slowly varying in space , with correlation length @xmath5 .",
    "our main results are that ( 1 ) the approximate treatment of sadovskii is a good approximation to the numerically calculated density of states in the `` high energy '' regime @xmath6 , with @xmath7 an exponent which depends on whether the potential is commensurate or incommensurate .",
    "the terms omitted in sadovskii s derivation noted in @xcite evidently produce negligible corrections .",
    "( 2 ) neither the flex approximation nor non self - consistent treatments such as that of lee , rice and anderson@xcite reproduce at all well the dependence of density of states on correlation length , although the self - consistency which is an essential feature of the flex approximation leads to a better representation of the density of states than does the approximation of lee , rice and anderson .",
    "( 3 ) fluctuations in the * amplitude * of the scattering potential play a crucial role in the form of the low energy density of states .",
    "most of the models studied make assumptions about the amplitude fluctuations which are not physically reasonable .",
    "( 4 ) some features of the results are controlled by fluctuations in the gradient of the backscattering potential ; the widely used lorentzian form has divergent gradient fluctuations which change the form of the results .    the balance of this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we present the models and a simple wkb treatment which reveals the essential physics . in section",
    "iii we present the results of our numerical study . in section",
    "iv we compare the numerical results to those obtained by approximate methods .",
    "section v contains a summary , conclusions , and a list of open problems .",
    "we consider spinless electrons moving in one spatial dimension and coupled to a static potential with spatial correlations to be specified below .",
    "the fundamental hamiltonian is @xmath8    we consider two sub - cases :    \\a ) _ half filling and commensurate potential_. in this case @xmath9 and we assume @xmath10 is a real random potential chosen from a distribution which implies @xmath11 and @xmath12    here @xmath13 for @xmath14 and we are interested in the large @xmath5 limit .",

    "the forward scattering part is not important for the density of states@xcite ; thus we consider only the back - scattering part and write @xmath21 because of the phase factors arising from the incommensurate fermi surface @xmath22 is a complex potential ; further we have absorbed phase factors into the definition of @xmath23 , thus we write the @xmath24 correlator as @xmath25    here @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the usual pauli matrices .    a formal solution for the green function of eq . [ eq:2.2 ] has been derived by abrikosov and ryzhkin @xcite ; their solution generalizes immediately to the commensurate case .",

    "its eigenvalues are @xmath40 and so we have @xmath41 with @xmath42 a rotation matrix .",
    "if @xmath43 is small compared to the length @xmath5 over which @xmath44 varies , @xmath45 may be found via a _",
    "wkb _ approximation .",
    "details are given in the appendix .",
    "the essential result is that @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the rotation matrix which diagonalizes @xmath39 , @xmath48 is a rotation matrix which is close to unity and @xmath49 is a diagonal matrix which , up to a phase , is @xmath50\\right ] + \\ldots   \\right )   \\label{eq:2.8}\\ ] ] here @xmath51 and @xmath52 .    from eq .",
    "[ eq : dos ] it is clear that g if @xmath53 is purely real the density of states vanishes ; thus obtaining real excitations of energy @xmath54 requires the existence of regions in which the local gap is larger than @xmath54 . in particular , in models with only phase fluctuations , the local gap amplitude @xmath55 is constant and for @xmath56 the density of states vanishes .",
    "this result is of course familiar in the context of @xmath57-wave superconductivity , where low - lying states and indeed dissipation come only from vortices and phase - slip centers , at which the * amplitude * of the superconducting order parameter vanishes .",
    "the methods used by lee , rice and anderson @xcite , by sadovskii@xcite , and by many subsequent workers assume that @xmath58 is gaussian and peaked at @xmath59 and therefore can not address the rare amplitude fluctuations which are the relevant physics for realistic systems as already noted by @xcite .    in the limit of infinite correlation length",
    "the density of states follows immediately from the leading order terms ; one finds for a fixed realization of disorder    @xmath60    the average density of states is then obtained by averaging this expression over the probability distribution of @xmath24 , leading to the @xmath61 results previously obtained by sadovskii @xcite .",
    "for example , for the incommensurate problem the two independently fluctuating components of the potential lead to    @xmath62    for @xmath63 , eq .",
    "[ eq : dos.incomm.inf ] implies @xmath64 .",
    "the analogous expression for the commensurate problem leads to a density of states proportional to @xmath35 .",
    "the expressions presented above suggests that the infinite correlation length results fail when @xmath65 , i.e. @xmath66 ^ 2 } \\sim \\kappa^2 $ ] . if one considers this estimate as a function of frequency , then one sees that in the regions of small potential where low lying states occur , @xmath67",
    "further , the lorentzian disorder assumed above has a divergent second moment , so @xmath68 where @xmath69 is an ultraviolet cutoff of order a lattice constant . combining these factors",
    "suggests that the wkb approximation breaks down for @xmath70 .",
    "matching this scale to the low energy density of states @xmath71 yields a residual density of states of order @xmath72 .",
    "as we shall see in the next section , the numerics suggests rather @xmath73 .",
    "similar considerations for the commensurate case would yield @xmath74 ; as we shall see , the numerical results roughly agree .",
    "our arguments suggest that the value of the low energy density of states is controlled by fluctuations in the derivative of the random potential .",
    "these are ultraviolet divergent for the widely used lorentzian form of the potential fluctuations .",
    "study of random potentials with finite second moments and hence derivative fluctuations on the scale of @xmath75 would be of interest .",
    "we now consider the density of states at very low energies .",
    "very low energies correspond to very long length scales , and at length scales greater than @xmath5 one expects the problem to map on to one with point - like ( delta - correlated ) disorder .",
    "ovchinnikov and erikhman @xcite have shown that in a fluctuating gap model very similar to the @xmath76 limit of the commensurate potential potential case the density of states diverges as @xmath77 ( with logarithmic corrections so the integral is not divergent ) and therefore we expect such a divergence in the present commensurate potential case also .",
    "the interesting question is the dependence on @xmath5 of the coefficient of the divergent term on the correlation length : this is equivalent to the question of the frequency range over which the divergence is visible above the background .",
    "we present here a qualitative argument indicating that the correct scale is @xmath72 .",
    "we note first that the density of states peak in the fluctuating gap model may be traced back to the su - schrieffer - heeger@xcite argument that in such models a change in sign of the back - scattering potential produces a mid - gap state .",
    "the mean distance between sign changes is @xmath78 .",
    "further , mid - gap states decay exponentially on a scale set by the mean gap so the hybridization between mid - gap states may be neglected and they may be treated as independent . we conclude that the number of such states per unit length is of order @xmath72 , therefore the divergence ( which is integrable ) must exist for @xmath79 .",
    "this argument may be sharpened . as noted by bartosch and kopietz@xcite , at @xmath80",
    "the green function for the commensurate case may be explicitly computed . in the context of the wkb formula",
    "this may be easily seen from eq .",
    "[ eq:2.8 ] : in the commensurate case the fact that the potential is purely real means @xmath81 while @xmath82 as @xmath83 , so corrections to the wkb result vanish .",
    "the number of states at @xmath80 may then be explicitly computed from eq .",
    "[ eq : dos ] . at @xmath80",
    ", @xmath84 is purely real except when the potential crosses zero , at which point an extra phase @xmath85 is incurred .",
    "thus in a system of length @xmath37 the number of states at @xmath86 is given precisely by the number of zero - crossings , which is of order @xmath87 .",
    "to convert this into an estimate for the density of states as a function of frequency , an estimate of the number of nearby states is required .",
    "we argue that this may be obtained by scaling , assuming @xmath88 ; this leads to a divergence @xmath89 . of course",
    ", rough estimates such as these will not correctly capture logarithmic terms .",
    "bartosch and kopietz@xcite have analyzed the formal solution to the commensurate problem in a different way , obtaining an expression which they interpret at the zero - frequency density of states per unit length per unit frequency .",
    "their expression diverges exponentially in the size of the system and is consistent neither with the arguments given above nor with the numerics to be presented in the next section .",
    "in fact their expression closely resembles the expression for the real part of @xmath34 which follows from our analysis .",
    "we have argued elsewhere@xcite that what they have computed is a wavefunction amplitude , not a density of states , so we do not consider their results further .",
    "we now briefly discuss the @xmath83 density of states for incommensurate potentials .",
    "the arguments presented above suggest that this will behave differently than in the commensurate case the fact that the fluctuating gap has two components means that the zero crossing argument is not relevant and the probability for the root mean square gap to vanish is negligible .",
    "we therefore believe that the incommensurate model has a vanishing density of states precisely at zero frequency .",
    "in this section we present results of a detailed numerical study of the density of states of the two models .",
    "we proceed by writing the real - space form of the hamiltonian as a matrix , choosing a particular realization of the backscattering potential from the distribution defined in the previous section , and numerically diagonalizing the hamiltonian .",
    "we obtain the density of states by averaging the eigenvalues over an appropriate energy window ( of order ( band width)/50 ) and then average over many ( typically 1000 ) realizations of the disorder .",
    "we find that the average over realizations of the disorder converges more rapidly for longer correlation lengths than for shorter ones , and converges more slowly for the commensurate model than for the incommensurate one .",
    "we first consider the commensurate model , eq .",
    "[ eq : h ] , which may be diagonalized as it stands . for the disorder we chose a gaussian distribution in which    @xmath90 \\label{eq : vcomm}\\ ] ]    and the distribution of @xmath91 is determined by the kernel @xmath92    these choices correspond to periodic boundary conditions for the fluctuating potential and open boundary conditions for the electrons .",
    "because @xmath93 for the commensurate case may be written as a tridiagonal matrix , sturm - chain techniques @xcite may be used to obtain the density of states for very large system sizes ( up to @xmath94 ) ; these system sizes are large enough that boundary effects are entirely negligible ; study of the length dependence of results has has allowed us to verify that even for the smaller systems ( @xmath95 ) accessible to direct diagonalization , boundary effects are negligible .",
    "figure 1 shows the density of states for the commensurate model for several correlation lengths and @xmath96 .",
    "several features are immediately evident .",
    "first , as noted by other workers@xcite , correlation lengths larger than @xmath97 are required in order to obtain an appreciable pseudogap .",
    "second , the density of states drops only slowly as @xmath5 is creased , and is surprisingly large even at @xmath98 .",
    "third , at low energies the density of states is approximately constant except for a central peak which is centered at @xmath80 and has a width which diminishes as the correlation length increases .",
    "we have obtained the residual ( i.e. without central peak ) density of states by smoothly extrapolating the calculated @xmath99 to zero , neglecting the upturn .",
    "the procedure suffers from ambiguities because our data are relatively coarsely binned in frequency and there is some uncertainty about the proper functional form for the central peak . the results are shown as filled circles in fig .",
    "2 ; the dashed line clearly shows that the residual density of states vanishes as @xmath100 with @xmath101 .",
    "we now turn to the central peak .",
    "it is evident that the width decreases as @xmath5 increases .",
    "our data are not sufficiently accurate to allow us to determine the precise scaling of the central peak with @xmath5 and @xmath35 , but we believe they are consistent with the form @xmath102 with @xmath103 given by the ovchinnikov - erikhman form@xcite , @xmath104 for @xmath105 and @xmath106 for @xmath107 . in particular , @xmath99 appears to increase roughly as @xmath77 and as shown in fig .",
    "3 , the area under the central peak scales approximately as @xmath72 , although one sees that the corrections to this scaling become appreciable for @xmath108 .",
    "the incommensurate model is defined via a continuum equation ; a discretization is therefore necessary . for computational convenience",
    "we have adopted @xmath109 + v_j \\left (     d^{\\dagger}_{j , l } d^{\\phantom{\\dagger}}_{j , r }   + d^{\\dagger}_{j , r } d^{\\phantom{\\dagger}}_{j , l } \\right ) \\right\\ } \\label{eq : incomm_numeric}\\ ] ] with complex @xmath110 gaussian distributed with correlator @xmath111    our results for the density of states are shown in fig .",
    "the more rapid drop of @xmath112 with @xmath35 , expected from the wkb argument , is evident .",
    "there is no central peak .",
    "indeed there are some indications of a ` central dip ' but it is difficult to resolve this question numerically . we have obtained the residual density of states by smoothly extrapolating the calculated @xmath99 to zero , neglecting any possible downturn ; the procedure is less ambiguous than in the commensurate case .",
    "the results are shown as filled squares in fig . [",
    "fig : dos0-cmp ] ; the scaling with @xmath5 seems to be closer to @xmath113 than to the theoretically predicted @xmath72 .",
    "in this section we discuss the relation of the numerical results to various approximate calculations , in order to obtain insight into the strengths and weakness of the different approximations .",
    "we begin with the wkb approximation , shown as heavy dashed line in figs . 1 and 4 .",
    "this is seen to be a good approximation to the calculated density of states for not too low energies and not too short correlation lengths ; essentially the numerical results follows the wkb one until the density of states drops to the residual level shown in fig .",
    "we now turn to the continued fraction method of sadovskii , which for the incommensurate case is compared to numerics in fig .",
    "the qualitative correspondence is seen to be good , and to improve for longer correlation lengths .",
    "this suggest that the terms which tchernyshyov@xcite has noted are neglected in sadovskii s approach are not quantitatively important and become less significant as @xmath5 is increased . for infinite correlation length sadovskii",
    "s results are justified by the wkb arguments of section ii .",
    "closer examination however shows that the low energy large @xmath5 behavior of the density of states is not so well represented as one can see in fig .",
    "2 , the magnitude differs from the numerical one by factors of order two and the scaling with @xmath5 is incorrect , being @xmath72 instead of the numerically determined exponent @xmath114 to @xmath115 .",
    "similar discrepancies arise in the commensurate case , where the sadovskii @xmath116 instead of the correct @xmath72 .",
    "we now turn to the two other widely used approximations with a more transparent physical content , namely the lee - rice - anderson ( lra ) and `` fluctuation - exchange '' ( flex ) .",
    "the former authors argued that one should approximate the electron self energy by the leading order graphs which correspond to the expression @xmath117 where @xmath118 , @xmath119 is the bare green s function and @xmath120 is defined in eqs .",
    "[ eq : vcomm ] and [ eq : kcomm ] .",
    "this approximation leads to a gap structure which becomes very sharp even for relatively small @xmath5 and to a low energy density of states which varies as @xmath121 for both commensurate and incommensurate cases .",
    "these incorrect results arise because the self energy is too singular ; this feature in turn arises because the bare electron green s function is used to describe the intermediate state .",
    "an alternative scheme is the flex method .",
    "this is complicated in general but in the case of present interest is equivalent to making the lee - rice - anderson calculation self - consistent , by using a fully dressed green s function to compute the one - loop self energy i.e. @xmath122 with @xmath123 .",
    "we have numerically solved the flex equations for @xmath96 and various @xmath5 , the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dos - flex ] .",
    "it is clear from the results that the dressed green function leads to a less singular integral and therefore to a larger low energy density of states with less @xmath5 dependence .",
    "these are successes ; on the other hand , as with the lra approach , the difference between commensurate and incommensurate cases is lost and the central peak is absent . also as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : dos - flex ] the location of the peak in @xmath124 has a strong correlation length dependence , inconsistent with the numerics and with physical intuition . the value of @xmath125 is found to be larger than that found numerically but the @xmath5 dependence is qualitatively reasonable ( @xmath126 ) .",
    "to summarize , we have used numerical methods and a _ wkb _ analysis of a formal solution of a schroedinger equation to obtain an expression for the green function of a model of a one - dimensional charge density wave in its fluctuation regime .",
    "we found that low - lying density of states comes from regions where the amplitude of the @xmath127 gap vanishes and we emphasize that a proper treatment of a physically relevant model requires a correct treatment of amplitude fluctuations , which are typically described by a non - gaussian probability distribution , which is difficult to handle either analytically or numerically .    on the qualitative level , we found that pseudogaps require relatively extreme conditions : a drop in the density of states does not begin to appear until the correlation length is larger than the basic coherence length @xmath128 defined by the electron velocity and mean field fluctuation amplitude , and the low energy density of states decreases only slowly as @xmath5 is increased beyond this scale .",
    "physics we have omitted from our model , including quantum fluctuations of the pairing potential and the phase space effects characteristic of dimensions greater than one , only weakens the tendency to form a gap .",
    "the ` pseudogap ' observed in underdoped high - t@xmath129 superconductors involves a significant suppression of the low energy density of states and therefore implies , at least for these materials , the existence of well established , reasonably long ranged pairing fluctuations .",
    "on the technical side , we have shown that the wkb method ( which we suspect can be generalized to higher dimensions ) and the sadovskii approximation ( which probably can not ) provide relatively reasonable estimates of the density of states ; other approximations do rather poorly , which is unfortunate because they easily generalize well to dimensions larger than one .    three extensions of this work would be desirable .",
    "one is to calculate the conductivity ; another is to numerically investigate the crossover between the large-@xmath5 pseudogap behavior and the small-@xmath5 constant density of states behavior ; the third is to treat non - gaussian amplitude fluctuations .    _",
