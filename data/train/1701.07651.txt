    "discrete particle models use a network of particles interacting via discrete links or connections that represent a discrete microstructure of the modeled material .",
    "an advantage of this approach is that discrete models can naturally capture small - scale phenomena .",
    "therefore , a variety of sophisticated discrete material models have been developed and applied in simulations of materials such as paper @xcite , textile @xcite , fibrous materials @xcite , woven composite fabrics @xcite or fiber composites @xcite .",
    "extensive effort has been invested into the formulation of a discrete model of concrete @xcite .",
    "discrete mechanical models can accurately capture complex material response , especially localized phenomena such as damage or plastic softening .",
    "however , they suffer by two main disadvantages .",
    "firstly , a large number of particles is needed to realistically describe the response of large - scale physically relevant models .",
    "this results in huge systems of equations , which are expensive to solve .",
    "secondly , the process of assembling of this system is also computationally expensive because all discrete connections must be individually taken into account .",
    "both of the aforementioned disadvantages of discrete particle models can be removed by using simplified continuous models based on one of the conventional homogenization procedures .",
    "however , standard continuous models can not capture localized phenomena in an objective way and require enrichments , e.g. , by nonlocal and gradient terms , which are again computationally expensive . according to baant",
    "@xcite , the most powerful approach to softening damage in the multi - scale context is a discrete ( lattice - particle ) simulation of the mesostructure of the entire structural region in which softening damage can occur .",
    "another way to reduce the computational cost of discrete particle models is a combination of a simplified continuous model with an exact discrete description in the parts where it is needed .",
    "such a combination of two different approaches entails that some hand shaking procedure is needed at the interface between the continuous and discrete domains @xcite .",
    "the quasicontinuum ( qc ) method is a suitable technique combining the advantages of continuous models with the exact description of discrete particle models without additional coupling procedures .",
    "the quasicontinuum method was originally proposed by tadmor , ortiz and phillips @xcite in 1996 .",
    "the original purpose of this computational technique was a simplification of large atomistic lattice models described by long - range conservative interaction potentials . since that time",
    ", qc methods have been widely used to investigate local phenomena of atomistic models with long - range interactions @xcite .",
    "recently , the application of qc methods has been successfully extended to other lattices and interaction potentials .",
    "for example , an application of the qc method to structural lattice models of fibrous materials with short - range nearest - neighbour interactions has been developed by beex et al .  for conservative @xcite and non - conservative @xcite interaction potentials including dissipation and fiber sliding as well as for planar beam lattices @xcite , still applied to regular lattices only .",
    "an overview of applications and current directions of qc methods has been provided by miller and tadmor in @xcite and in part iv of their book @xcite .",
    "in last few years , a variational formulation of dissipative qc method has been done by roko at al .",
    "@xcite , a goal - oriented adaptive version of qc algorithm has been introduced in @xcite or a meshless qc method has been developed by kochmann research group @xcite .",
    "but the application of all mentioned qc methods is still restricted only to systems with regular geometry of particles . in the present work ,",
    "we extend the qc approach to irregular systems of particles with short - range interactions by axial forces .",
    "the main idea has been tentatively presented in a conference paper @xcite . here",
    "we proceed to a more systematic evaluation of the performance of various qc formulations applied to systems with elastic - brittle links .",
    "the proposed models are implemented in oofem @xcite , an open - source object - oriented simulation platform initially developed for finite element methods but extensible to other discretization methods .",
    "the procedure that results from the qc method combines the following three ingredients :    1 .",
    "interpolation of particle displacements is used in the regions of low interest .",
    "only a small subset of particles is selected to characterize the behavior of the entire system .",
    "these so - called _ repnodes _ ( representative nodes ) are used as nodes of an underlying triangular finite element mesh , and the displacements of other particles in the region of low interest are interpolated . in the regions of high interest , all particles",
    "are selected as repnodes , in order to provide the exact resolution of the particle model .",
    "this interpolation leads to a significant reduction of the number of degrees of freedom ( dofs ) without inducing a large error in the regions of high interest .",
    "2 .   a summation rule can be applied in order to eliminate the requirement of visiting all particles during assembly of the global equilibrium equations .",
    "if such a rule is not imposed , all particles need to be visited to construct the system of equations , which makes the process computationally expensive .",
    "if the summation rule is adopted , the contribution of all particles in each interpolation triangle is estimated based on sampling of the links that surround one single particle and proper scaling of their contribution .",
    "this makes the computational process faster but some problems occur on the interface between regions of high and low interest .",
    "the piecewise linear interpolation of displacements combined with the summation rule means that the deformation is considered as constant within each interpolation element in the regions of low interest , while the deformations of individual links in the regions of high interest are evaluated exactly .",
    "consequently , forces of nonphysical character , called the ghost forces , appear on the interface @xcite .",
    "+ in our work , the summation procedure is based on homogenization of link networks contributing to the interpolation elements .",
    "some of the links ( truss elements ) are selected to be processed exactly , in order to properly treat the interface between the exactly solved and interpolated domains and thus to eliminate the ghost forces .",
    "adaptivity provides suitable changes of the regions of high interest during the simulation process .",
    "a new triangulation of the interpolation mesh could be done , but this is actually not necessary because the type of region can be changed by adding repnodes before each step .",
    "a suitable change of the regions of high interest often leads to a substantial increase of accuracy and , in several specific cases , it is necessary in order to represent the correct physical behavior , e.g. , in a crack propagation process .",
    "the original qc approach was developed for regularly arranged crystal lattices , in which atoms interact at a longer distance ( not just with immediate neighbors ) and the interaction forces can be derived from suitable potentials . in regions of low interest , displacements were interpolated in a piecewise linear fashion , using a selected set of representative atoms ( repatoms ) . in this context ,",
    "imposition of an affine displacement field on the periodic crystal lattice can be interpreted as an application of the cauchy - born rule .    in the present paper ,",
    "we focus on discrete particle systems with short - range elastic or elastic - brittle interactions .",
    "such systems are typically used in simulations of heterogeneous materials .",
    "particles in these systems are distributed randomly and , in contrast to atomistic systems , do not form regular lattices , but the idea of qc can still be used .",
    "three approaches based on this idea are introduced here and are compared with the fully resolved particle model in two dimensions , which is considered as the reference case .",
    "accuracy is assessed in terms of displacement and strain errors .",
    "the number and position of repnodes are adapted to achieve the optimal result .",
    "the computational procedure consists of the following steps :    * generation of particles and of connecting links , * selection of repnodes and generation of interpolation elements , * application of a simplification rule , * assembly of global equations with repnode displacements as basic unknowns , * solution of global equations ( for nonlinear models using an incremental - iterative scheme ) , * post - processing of results and error evaluation .",
    "the details of individual steps are described in the following subsections .      in the first step ,",
    "the input geometry of the particle system is generated ; it is specified by the position of all particles in the system and by the information which pairs of particles are connected by links .",
    "this process depends on the type of represented material .",
    "the second step consists of repnode selection and generation of interpolation elements .",
    "there are two possible reasons why a certain particle is selected as a repnode :    1 .",
    "all particles located in a region of high interest are selected as repnodes to represent the `` exact '' behaviour in this region .",
    "2 .   in regions of low interest ,",
    "a sufficient number of repnodes are needed to construct the approximation of the displacements of other particles .",
    "such repnodes represent vertices of the interpolation elements .",
    "the basic triangulation is done by the t3d mesh generator @xcite .",
    "then all newly created vertices of the mesh elements are shifted to the position of the nearest particles and are labeled as repnodes .      once the input geometry is given , it is possible to apply a suitable simplifying rule based on the idea of qc . in this paper ,",
    "five approaches using various levels of simplification are considered .",
    "this approach does not use any simplification and corresponds to the reference model . only the particles and links defining the particle model",
    "are used as input .",
    "repnodes and interpolation elements are not needed .",
    "every single particle represents a node with independent dofs ( displacements ) and the links are described by 1d truss elements .",
    "consequently , all links are taken into account explicitly and contribute directly to the internal forces and to the stiffness matrix .",
    "this approach fully resolves the `` exact '' particle model , and the corresponding results are used as a reference solution for evaluation of accuracy and efficiency of the following simplified approaches .      the first technique which exploits the qc idea for simplification of the full particle model is based on approximation of dofs of those particles that have not been selected as repnodes .",
    "such particles are called the hanging nodes because their dofs are not independent unknowns but are `` hanging '' on auxiliary elements with displacements interpolated from the neighboring repnodes . triangular or tetrahedral interpolation elements with vertices at the repnodes are used here . for each hanging node , the corresponding interpolation element is found .",
    "it is either the element in which the hanging node is located , or the nearest element if the hanging node is not located in any interpolation element , which sometimes occurs at a curved part of the physical boundary of the particle system ; see figure  [ particles ] .",
    "the displacement of each hanging node ( grey ) is a linear combination of the displacements of the vertices of the corresponding interpolation element ( black ) .",
    "this means that dofs of all hanging nodes are interpolated ( or extrapolated ) using the dofs of repnodes as the primary unknowns .",
    "linear interpolation is used .",
    "all links ( truss elements connecting particles ) contribute to the structural stiffness matrix , but only the repnodes possess independent dofs . the repnodes represent the nodes of an interpolation mesh , which consists of linear triangular ( 2d ) or tetrahedral ( 3d ) elements .",
    "these elements are used only for approximation of displacements of the nodes not selected as repnodes and do not provide a direct contribution to the internal force vector and the structural stiffness matrix .    in oofem implementation , the particles carrying dofs ( repnodes )",
    "are modeled as regular nodes .",
    "the particles with interpolated dofs ( hanging nodes ) are represented by a special type of node for which the subset of interpolation elements can be specified .",
    "the nearest interpolation element is taken from this subset and not from all interpolation elements .",
    "this technique allows to distinguish overlapping elements on the opposite sides of a crack .",
    "the set of links that contribute to the global equilibrium equations is the same as in the a1 approach . in regions of high interest , all nodes are repnodes and",
    "the contribution of these regions is the same as in the pure particle approach ( a1 ) .      in regions of low interest",
    ", this approach replaces the stiffness that corresponds to the links by the stiffness of 2d triangular or 3d tetrahedral elements `` filled '' by a fictitious continuum material with properties obtained by homogenization of the discrete network .",
    "thereby , a substantial number of truss elements can be removed from the assembly procedure , and the number of operations is significantly reduced . in the a3 approach , only one ( global ) effective elastic stiffness tensor , common to all elements , is assembled from the contribution of all links .",
    "such a tensor can be derived from the hill - mandel condition @xcite , which requires that the virtual macroscopic work density at a point be equal to the average microscopic virtual work in a corresponding volume @xmath0 of the microstructure .",
    "this condition can be written as @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the virtual macroscopic work density ( i.e. , work per unit volume ) and @xmath3 is the average virtual microscopic work density in the discrete microstructure . here ,",
    "@xmath4 and @xmath5 are the macroscopic stress and strain tensors , and @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the microscopic stress and strain tensors .    for a microstructure consisting of particles connected by links that transmit axial forces only , the integral in ( [ eq:3 ] ) can be replaced by a sum over all links , which leads to @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the number of links in volume @xmath0 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 is the length and cross - sectional area of link number @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 is the axial stress and strain in that link , @xmath15 is the axial force and @xmath16 is the elongation ( change of length ) .    in analogy to the cauchy - born rule used in the original quasicontinuum theory for atomic lattices",
    "@xcite , we will use the simplifying assumption that the microscopic strains ( actual strains as well as virtual ones ) can be evaluated by projecting the macroscopic strain tensor .",
    "this assumption , in microplane theory referred to as the kinematic constraint @xcite , is written as @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a second - order tensor , introduced for convenience .",
    "based on ( [ eq : wmac])([eq : kinematic - constraint ] ) , the virtual work equality ( [ eq : h - m-1 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath19 since ( [ eq:7 ] ) should hold for all symmetric second - order tensors @xmath20 , and since @xmath21 is symmetric , the macroscopic stress must be given by @xmath22    formula ( [ eq:8b ] ) provides a rule for the evaluation of the macroscopic stress tensor @xmath4 from the microscopic stresses , in our case from the axial stresses in individual links , @xmath13 .",
    "the formula is generally applicable , even to inelastic materials . in the particular case of a linear elastic material response ,",
    "the constitutive behavior of links is described by hooke s law @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the microscopic elastic modulus of link number @xmath12 ( often considered as the same for all links ) . substituting ( [ eq:5 ] ) into ( [ eq:8b ] ) and exploiting the first part of ( [ eq : kinematic - constraint ] ) , we obtain @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the fourth - order macroscopic elastic stiffness tensor .    in the a3 approach , the sum in ( [ stiffness_tensor ] )",
    "is taken over all links of the discrete model , and @xmath0 corresponds to the volume of the entire domain of analysis .",
    "major and minor symmetries of the computed stiffness tensor @xmath27 are guaranteed because all these symmetries are exhibited by the fourth - order tensor , for each @xmath12 .",
    "once the global stiffness tensor is evaluated , the corresponding material parameters are assigned to all 2d and 3d elements .",
    "the nature of these parameters depends on the assumed type of material ( e.g. , isotropic , orthotropic , or general anisotropic ) .",
    "for instance , if the material is supposed to be macroscopically isotropic , the numerically evaluated stiffness tensor @xmath27 is replaced by its best approximation by an isotropic stiffness tensor characterized by two elastic constants .",
    "the details will be explained in section  [ sec : homo ] .",
    "triangular or tetrahedral elements , which were in the a2 approach considered as interpolation elements for hanging nodes , are now used directly for evaluation of the structural stiffness matrix , based on the material stiffness tensor obtained in the homogenization process .",
    "thus , all hanging nodes with interpolated dofs and all truss elements connecting them can be removed from the computational model .",
    "this leads to a significant reduction of the computational cost , but the elimination of links must be done carefully .",
    "links connecting two hanging nodes ( located both in the same element or in two different elements ) can be removed because their stiffness is represented by the effective stiffness of the homogenized material assigned to the elements .",
    "links connecting one repnode and one hanging node located in the same element can be removed , too , because their stiffness is also reflected by the effective material stiffness .",
    "a special case occurs if a link passes through more than one element and connects one hanging node with one repnode .",
    "this can happen if the interpolation elements are too small , or on the interface between regions of low and high interest ( see fig .",
    "[ hanging_nodes ] , in which the pink rectangle is a region of high interest and the light blue rectangle is a region of low interest ) .",
    "such links should not be removed because their stiffness is not reflected by the homogenized material .",
    "therefore , the involved hanging nodes are kept and the contribution of the links is taken into account explicitly , in addition to the contribution of the triangular or tetrahedral elements .    the global effective elastic stiffness tensor is determined by techniques that will be described in section  [ sec : homo ] . for a general arrangement of particles and links , this tensor is considered as anisotropic . if the internal structure of the material exhibits no preferential directions and is expected to be macroscopically isotropic , the numerically evaluated effective elastic stiffness is replaced by its best isotropic approximation . to distinguish between the general anisotropic case and the special isotropic case ,",
    "the corresponding versions of the a3 approach are referred to as a3a and a3i .",
    "these approaches are refinements of a3 and aim at improving the following deficiencies :    1 .   in the a3 approach ,",
    "the effective material stiffness takes into account all links .",
    "however , certain links that partially cross homogenized elements are treated explicitly , and thus a part of their stiffness is actually accounted for twice , which artificially increases the resulting structural stiffness .",
    "the a3 approach assumes that , from the macroscopic point of view , material properties are the same at all points of the investigated domain , while in reality the local arrangement of links is variable across the domain .",
    "the a4/a5 approaches remove these deficiencies by identifying effective properties of the homogenized material for each element separately .",
    "the a4 approach treats the material as isotropic while the a5 approach accounts for local anisotropy . for computation of local material parameters",
    ", it makes sense to consider general anisotropy even if the overall material behavior is isotropic .",
    "the reason is that , for small elements , the particular local arrangement of a few links can result in a significant deviation from isotropy .",

    "indeed , this is the case , even on irregular meshes shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : patch - mesh ] , provided that the link stiffnesses are tuned up such that the macroscopic behavior is isotropic .",
    "the test is analogous to patch tests of finite elements , because it demonstrates that a solution with a uniform strain field is captured exactly by the numerical method .",
    "neither interpolation nor homogenization errors arise and all approaches pass the patch test .",
    "if the macroscopic behavior of the lattice is not isotropic , approaches a2 and a5 still lead to the exact results , while approach a3 does so only if the globally homogenized material stiffness is considered as anisotropic . for a4 ,",
    "the locally homogenized material stiffness is by definition isotropic , which induces a homogenization error .",
    "the fact that the global homogenization procedure gives exactly the same stiffness matrix @xmath30 given by ( [ eq5 ] ) as the homogenization of one cell is obvious , because the whole domain is composed of an integer number of identical cells . on the other hand , it is not immediately clear that the same stiffness matrix is obtained by local homogenization over an arbitrary triangular element , including cases when edges of the element are not aligned with lattice directions ( horizontal , vertical and diagonal ) .    a graphical proof of this interesting property is sketched in fig .  [ fig : explanation_a ] , which shows a typical triangular element and the underlying regular lattice .",
    "the key point is that the sum of the lengths of intersections of the triangle with vertical links , @xmath97 , is exactly equal to the triangle area , @xmath98 , divided by the horizontal spacing between the horizontal links , @xmath99 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : explanation_a ] , this sum multiplied by @xmath99 directly corresponds to evaluation of the triangle area by numerical integration using the trapezoidal rule .",
    "since the function to be integrated is piecewise linear and one of the integration points is always located at the point where the slope changes ( i.e. , at the projection of one vertex ) , the numerical quadrature is exact , which means that @xmath100 an analogous statement holds for horizontal links , for ascending diagonal links , and for descending diagonal links .",
    "consequently , the relative proportions of horizontal , vertical , ascending diagonal and descending diagonal links in each single triangular element are the same as the overall relative proportions , and formula ( [ stiffness_tensor ] ) always leads to the same material stiffness as formula ( [ eq5 ] ) , valid for one periodic cell .",
    "this would not be the case if the vertices of the triangle were placed at arbitrary locations and not at grid points .      for shear , the boundary conditions shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : patch - bc]b do not lead to a uniform strain field ( note that the top and bottom parts of the boundary are considered as traction - free and their displacements are not prescribed ) .",
    "the relative stiffness errors evaluated according to formula ( [ errorrse ] ) for meshes with different numbers of elements ( noe ) are graphically presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : cell_shear_ree+eei]a .",
    "the error decreases fast with increasing number of elements , which indicates that the error is due to interpolation .",
    "the homogenization procedure , even when performed for each triangular element separately , does not introduce any error , for the same reasons as explained in the previous subsection on direct tension ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : explanation_a ] ) .",
    "an exception is the finest interpolation mesh with 26 elements per edge , for which the elements are not much bigger than the lattice cells . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : explanation_b ] , for such fine meshes there exist links ( marked in red ) that connect a repnode with a particle located in an interpolation element not connected to that repnode .",
    "such links are accounted for explicitly and are excluded from homogenization , which leads to disturbances .",
    "the a5 approach with locally evaluated anisotropic material stiffness is then superior to the a3 and a4 approaches , which assume isotropy .    in terms of the stiffness error ( rse ) , the a2 approach ( hanging nodes ) gives in the present example somewhat higher accuracy than the other approaches , even though the difference is not dramatic . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cell_shear_ree+eei]b , the energy error indicator ( eei ) has the same value for all approaches ( a2a5 ) and decreases to very low levels as the interpolation mesh is refined .        in this series of tests ,",
    "the microstructure is obtained by randomization of a periodic microstructure composed of @xmath96 cells .",
    "the randomization is achieved by random shifts of particle positions .",
    "the maximal shift values in @xmath101 and @xmath102 directions are @xmath103 and @xmath104 , respectively .",
    "the nodes located on edges are shifted along the edges only .",
    "the final result is evaluated as an average of computations with five different randomized microstructures .",
    "an example of a randomized microstructure is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : patch - microstructure]b .",
    "patch tests have been performed for a number of triangular meshes with various sizes of elements ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : patch - mesh ] .      for the direct tension test ,",
    "the relative stiffness errors ( rse ) corresponding to different meshes and to approaches a2a5 are listed in table  [ tab : tension_randomized_reaction ] and graphically presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : tension_randomized_stiffness_a ] .",
    "the energy errors ( eei ) are listed in table  [ tab : tension_randomized_energyind ] .",

    "the rses are plotted again in fig .",
    "[ fig : tension_randomized_stiffness_b ] , this time with parameters a3 and a4 determined according to ( [ eq - normb ] ) .",
    "the isotropic stiffness is overestimated for both matrix norms",
    ". nevertheless , norm ( [ eq - normb ] ) provides a significantly higher error and seems to be unacceptable for application to uniform tension .",
    "the error induced by the a3 approach is independent of the refinement of the interpolation mesh , except for very fine meshes .",
    "the reason is that the a3 approach deals with the same homogenized stiffness matrix in all elements , and if the whole sample is replaced by a homogeneous continuum , the prescribed boundary conditions induce uniform strain across the sample .",
    "such a state of uniform strain is then captured by all meshes because the underlying finite elements pass the standard patch test .",
    "of course , the reference solution obtained using the fully resolved particle model is somewhat different , because the microstructure is not completely regular .",
    "the error of the a3 approach is thus nonzero ; it does not depend on the mesh , with the exception of very fine meshes , for which some links are considered explicitly , as already discussed in section  [ sec : shear1 ] ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : explanation_b ] ) . for approaches a4 and a5",
    ", the total error slowly decreases as the mesh is refined .",
    "as expected , a4 is seen to be more accurate than a3 , and a5 is still more accurate .",
    "the last three columns in table  [ tab : tension_randomized_reaction ] present the homogenization errors for approaches a3a5 .",
    "the homogenization error is defined as the difference between the total error of the given approach and the total error of the a2 approach , which does not use any homogenization .",
    "the homogenization errors are seen to be below 1% , and for the a5 approach to be virtually nil , with the exception of very fine meshes . even for coarser meshes ,",
    "the homogenization error slightly increases with mesh refinement . for approaches a3 and a4 ,",
    "this can be attributed to the anisotropic character of the local arrangements of links .",

    ", the maximum fineness of microstructure that can be solved using the pure particle model ( approach a1 ) is 27 particles along the shortest edge , which leads to 282,852 dofs and 820,846 links .",

    "modern supercomputers would allow to solve problems with a finer microstructure but such computations can be quite expensive .",
    "furthermore , even for supercomputers , a finite limit on the size of the problem always exists and qc - based approaches can make even larger systems solvable .",
