    "a zintl - type intermetallic compound mo@xmath0sb@xmath1 has gained much attention in recent years due to its interesting superconducting and transport properties .",

    "et al._@xcite observed a structural cubic - to - tetragonal distortion below @xmath6  k , and suggested the formation of the spin - singlet dimers valence - bond crystal.@xcite     left : conventional unit cell of the tetragonal mo@xmath0sb@xmath1 . in blue : mo(4e ) , in pink mo(8i ) , in green all of the sb atoms ( sb atoms were made smaller ) .",

    "the singlet dimers formation between nearest mo(4e ) atoms , as indicated by the blue arrows , was proposed,@xcite but the contribution from the mo(8i ) atom should be important to destabilize the cubic phase.@xcite black arrows on the right indicate one of the possibilities of static magnetic ordering , considered in our calculations .",
    "if the two mo(4e ) atoms , which form singlet dimer , are treated as non - equivalent , the crystal looses inversion center ( see , sec .",
    "[ sec2]).,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    as far as the superconducting pairing mechanism is concerned , there is no agreement whether mo@xmath0sb@xmath1 is a typical s - wave electron - phonon ( bcs ) superconductor or some more complex state is realized .",
    "most of the published results  @xcite , including first principles calculations for the cubic phase,@xcite support the conventional picture .",
    "however , various values of the electronic specific heat jump at the transition point were reported,@xcite @xmath7 much smaller , or close to the weak  coupling bcs value 1.43 .",
    "moreover , the specific heat in the superconducting state@xcite and the magnetic field penetration depth@xcite behaviors were differently analyzed , in terms of either one or two  gap bcs models .",
    "it was also proposed , that antiferromagnetic fluctuations may be responsible for the superconductivity , due to observation of the spin density wave under pressure.@xcite    recently , basing on the neutron single crystal and x - ray powder diffraction studies , structural parameters of the low temperature tetragonal phase were accurately determined.@xcite availability of the exact crystallographic data and renew interest in this system prompted us to re - investigate the electronic structure , magnetism , dynamics and the electron - phonon interaction in the tetragonal mo@xmath0sb@xmath1 to discuss the effect of the distortion on mo@xmath0sb@xmath1 properties .",
    "especially we wanted to verify , whether the strength of the electron - phonon interaction in the tetragonal phase is sufficient to drive the system into the superconducting state , with the experimentally observed critical temperature , as the previous results supporting electron - phonon superconductivity@xcite were obtained for the cubic phase .",
    "due to the distinct crystal structures , it is possible that in the tetragonal phase ( where in fact superconductivity in mo@xmath0sb@xmath1 appears ) the situation could be much different .",
    "analysis of the unit cell symmetry in terms of the possible formation of antiferromagnetic phases ( see , sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] ) led to observation , that when the two mo(4e ) atoms , expected@xcite to form the spin singlet dimers , are taken as nonequivalent , the unit cell looses the inversion symmetry . since this requires the appearance of the distinguishing physical feature , like anti - parallel direction of local magnetic moment , this is rather not a case of the electronic spin - singlet state .",
    "however , under external pressure the antiferromagnetic spin density wave state was suggested to stabilize,@xcite and this could provide the distinguishing feature between the two mo(4e ) atoms . that could transform mo@xmath0sb@xmath1 into the non - centrosymmetric superconductor and this new feature of the system",

    "the phonon dispersions and dos were calculated with the direct method.@xcite this method utilizes hellmann - feynman forces obtained by performing small atomic displacements of nonequivalent atoms from their equilibrium positions . from them the dynamical matrix is determined and diagonalized to obtain the phonon frequencies at each wave vector .",

    "the larger value of @xmath43 for mo(4e ) together with unchanged average phonon frequency makes the contribution of this atom to the total electron - phonon coupling constant higher than for the mo(8i ) atoms , if values per one atom are compared .",
    "the accompanying increase of the @xmath44 value for the mo(8i ) and decrease of @xmath43 does not allow for the substantial increase of the overall contribution to epc constant from the group of mo atoms , which increase only in about 2.6% .",

    "[ fig - tc - mu ] ( since the electronic densities of states are very similar in both phases , we expect that the coulomb repulsion , described by the parameter @xmath48 , should be practically the same ) .",
    "we see , that tetragonal distortion favors superconductivity , since resulting @xmath47 is slightly higher at given @xmath48 , as a result of higher @xmath2 .",
    "note , that the numerical prefactor @xmath53 in the allen - dynes version of the @xmath47 equation was originally fitted using @xmath59 instead of mcmillan s @xmath60 , thus when allen - dynes equation is used , lower @xmath48 should be taken .",
    "this explains why @xmath47 obtained using allen - dynes formula at the same @xmath48 is lower than using mcmillan formula .",
    "nevertheless , the experimental value of @xmath61  k is reproduced in calculations for the realistic range of @xmath62 , thus , in the tetragonal phase , the assumption , that the electron - phonon interaction is responsible for the superconductivity in mo@xmath0sb@xmath1 is even better supported , than in the cubic one .",
    "results , presented in previous section , supported the electron - phonon mechanism as being responsible for the superconductivity in mo@xmath0sb@xmath1 by showing , that the electron - phonon interaction was strong enough to drive the system into the superconducting state .",
    "it still remains unknown , how the magnetic interactions between mo atoms in mo@xmath0sb@xmath1 influence the superconducting state . as we mentioned in the introduction , antiferromagnetic fluctuations",
    "were even suggested to be a source of the superconductivity.@xcite    investigation of the magnetic properties of mo@xmath0sb@xmath1 using dft techniques occurred to be difficult , since such effects as local low - dimensional spin singlet dimers@xcite or valence bond crystal,@xcite predicted in mo@xmath0sb@xmath1 , are difficult to be taken into account by these methods .",
    "the only way to mimic a singlet state in typical band - structure calculations is to assume antiparallel ordering of local magnetic moments on nearest atoms and to verify if the self - consistent cycle of calculations will stabilize this state .",
    "several attempts to investigate the possibility of static long - range magnetic ordering in the tetragonal mo@xmath0sb@xmath1 were made .",
    "first , the calculated stoner parameters on mo atoms are below the critical 1.0 value , being 0.73 and 0.75 for mo(8i ) and mo(4e ) sublattices , respectively , thus are close to those reported for the cubic phase@xcite ( @xmath63 ) . in agreement with the stoner model , spin - polarized calculations for the ferromagnetic spin arrangements yielded non - magnetic ground state . as far as anfiterromagnetic configurations are concerned , koyama _",
    "et al._@xcite proposed the two afm exchange coupling constants @xmath64 and @xmath65 between mo(4e)-mo(4e ) and mo(4e)-mo(8i ) .",
    "if the local mo magnetic moments were coupled that way , it could result in the magnetic structure represented by the arrows in the fig .",
    "[ fig - cryst ] ( i.e. two mo(4e ) atoms are coupled antiferromagnetically to each other and to neighboring four mo(8i ) atoms , with magnetic moments along @xmath66 direction ) .",
    "for such a case , magnetic unit cell has to be doubled along @xmath67 axis , and the two mo atoms , which build the mo(4e ) dimer , have to be considered as nonequivalent , to allow for the opposite direction of the magnetic moment . as a result of distinguished mo(4e ) atoms , the unit cell becomes noncentrosymmetric , as will be discussed below . for this case , again , the non - magnetic state was predicted by dft calculations .",
    "all these results were verified using the relativistic full - potential calculations , where the spin - orbit coupling was included , using both lda and gga functionals .",
    "thus , any stable , long - range ordering of magnetic moments was not found , in agreement with experimental findings and previous theoretical studies of the tetragonal  @xcite and cubic  @xcite phases .",
    "moreover , to verify whether the absence of magnetism in dft calculations may be related to the arbitrarily assumed type of magnetic ordering , we performed calculations for the so called disordered local moment state ( dlm ) . in this approach , a completely disordered magnetic state , with local non - zero magnetic moments ,",
    "can be studied , thanks to the using of the coherent potential approximation ( cpa ) ( see , e.g. refs.@xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , also in these kkr - cpa calculations , all the magnetic moments of the mo atoms converged to zero values .",
    "the same set of calculations for the smaller unit cells were carried out , to simulate the effect of external pressure . also here , both for ordered ( fm , afm ) and disordered ( dlm ) states the local mo magnetic moments vanished .",
    "this proves the subtle nature of the magnetic properties of this system , and is in agreement with the non - magnetic spin - singlet states formation scenario.@xcite    the cubic - to - tetragonal phase transition in the mo@xmath0sb@xmath1 system is possible under two terms : the dimerisation of two mo(4e ) atoms in a siglet pair@xcite and their ordering to the valence bond crystal@xcite along one of the axis of the cubic structure .",
    "the origin of the second term that guarantees the choice of one axis in singlet formation is not evident and was suggested to be the spin frustration.@xcite as we mentioned in the introduction , if the singlet pair would consist of two antiparallel individual mo magnetic moments localized on the two mo(4e ) atoms , rather than being a quantum spin - singlet state , that would result in loosing the center of inversion in such a magnetic unit cell .",
    "since the stabilization of the local magnetic moments , resulting in the antiferromagnetic spin density wave formation was reported under external pressure@xcite , mo@xmath0sb@xmath1 under pressure may become a member of very interesting group of the noncentrosymmetric superconductors,@xcite but with the noncentrosymmetricity induced by magnetism .    to recall shortly , superconductivity and the presence of the inversion center",
    "are connected by the basic symmetry considerations.@xcite for the s - wave ( bcs - type ) pairing , the electrons forming the cooper pair have opposite spin and momentum , i.e. it is required that when @xmath68 state exists near the fermi level , the state @xmath69 has to exist , to form the cooper pair .",
    "the @xmath70 , @xmath71 degeneracy is provided by the presence of either inversion center or time reversal symmetry , while the @xmath72 , @xmath73 degeneracy is provided only by the latter . as a result , singlet pairing is not expected in ferromagnetic compounds , due to the time reversal breaking , and triplet pairing is not expected in the noncentrosymmetric structures , due to the lack of the inversion center .",
    "situation becomes more complex , when spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) is important in the system , since when soc is strong , the mixing of parity of the superconducting state can be observed .",
    "@xcite for example , in the noncentrosymmetric family of li@xmath74pd@xmath0b and li@xmath74pt@xmath0b compounds,@xcite specific heat  @xcite or nmr  @xcite results support s - wave isotropic superconductivity , in contrast to the penetration depth measurements  @xcite , where mixture of spin - singlet and triplet components in the superconducting energy gap are suggested .        as the spin - orbit interaction is the important parameter for any noncentrosymmetric effects , relativistic band structure was calculated@xcite for the tetragonal mo@xmath0sb@xmath1 .",

    "we may conclude , that the spin - orbit interaction has visible effect on the electronic band structure , thus effects of the noncentrosymmetricity ( if present ) may play a role for the pairing symmetry .",
    "the question , whether any mixing of parity , induced by the lack of inversion center is possible for mo@xmath0sb@xmath1 is certainly related to the question whether any static afm - like state coexists with the superconductivity . as was argued by tran _",

    "both , sdw and superconducting phases , although competes with each other ( @xmath47 increases with p , @xmath81 decreases for p @xmath82 4.5 kbar ) , coexist in some pressure ranges .",
    "if so , superconductivity may be present in parallel with the noncentrosymmetricity , induced by sdw phase .",
    "repetition of the basic experiments ( e.g. specific heat , nmr or @xmath83sr ) to reveal the gap symmetry under pressure should shed some light on the pairing symmetry .",

    "we found , that the tetragonal distortion has small and beneficial effect on superconductivity , slightly increasing the coupling constant , from @xmath84 to @xmath85 .",
    "effect on the superconducting critical temperature @xmath47 was evaluated using mcmillan - type formulas , and calculated @xmath47 s for the tetragonal phase were also slightly higher than corresponding values for the cubic one .",
