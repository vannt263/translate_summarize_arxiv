    "clusters of galaxies are ideal astrophysical environments for particle acceleration .",
    "large scale shocks which form during the process of cluster formation are believed to be efficient particle accelerators ( e.g. sarazin 1999 ; gabici & blasi 2003 ; ryu et al .",
    "2003 ; pfrommer et al .",
    "2006 ) . cosmic rays ( crs ) can also be injected into the icm from ordinary galaxies and agns ( e.g. vlk & atoyan 1999 ) and turbulent eddies may contribute to the particle acceleration process ( e.g. brunetti & lazarian 2007 ) .",
    "crs accelerated within the cluster volume would then be confined for cosmological times and the bulk of their energy is expected in protons since they have radiative and collisional life  times much longer than those of the electrons ( e.g. blasi et al .",
    "2007 , for a review ) .    while present gamma ray observations can only provide upper limits to the average energy density of cr protons in the icm ( e.g. reimer et al . 2004 ) , the presence of relativistic electrons in a number of clusters has been ascertained via the detection of a tenuous synchrotron radio emission : giant radio halos ( rhs ) and mini - radio halos , fairly symmetric sources at the cluster center , and radio relics , elongated sources at the cluster periphery ( e.g. feretti & giovannini 2007 ) .",
    "it is customary to classify the models for the origin of rhs in _ secondary electron _",
    "( e.g. blasi & colafrancesco 1999 ) and _ reacceleration models _",
    "( e.g. brunetti et al .",
    "2001 ; petrosian 2001 ) , depending on whether the radiating electrons are produced as secondary products of hadronic interactions or reaccelerated by turbulence from a pre - existing population of non - thermal seeds in the icm , respectively .",
    "these models predict a different connection between radio and x - ray properties of clusters which are discussed in this letter and compared with new observations : in sect.2 we review the expectations of the different models , in sect.3 we briefly present the radio observations of our cluster sample , and in sects.4 & 5 we report and discuss our results .",
    "concordance ( @xmath2=70 , @xmath3=0.3 , @xmath4=0.7 ) cosmology is used .",
    "giant rhs follow a correlation between their radio power at 1.4 ghz ( @xmath5 ) and physical size , and the x - ray luminosity ( @xmath6 ) and temperature of clusters in which they are found ( e.g. liang et al . 2000 ; bacchi et al . 2003 ; cassano et al .",
    "2006,07 ) .",
    "in this letter we focus on the @xmath5@xmath6 correlation that relates directly observable quantities .",
    "the bulk of giant rhs has been discovered from the analysis of relatively shallow surveys ( nvss , giovannini et al .  1999 , g99 ;",
    "wenss , kempner & sarazin 2001 , ks01 ) and a relevant issue is how observational biases may affect this correlation .",
    "there is agreement on the fact that the upper envelope of the @xmath5@xmath6 correlation is likely to be solid ( e.g. clarke 2005 ) , but the effect of observational biases on the lower envelope is more problematic ( rudnick et al .",
    "2006 ) . indeed",
    ", if all clusters would have cluster  scale radio emission at the level of presently known rhs , then the @xmath5@xmath6 trend may possess a fairly large spread with lower luminosity rhs falling just below present observational limits . on the other hand",
    "it is also possible that clusters have a physical bimodal distribution with the rh ",
    "clusters following the correlation and with other clusters having no ( or much weaker ) cluster  scale radio emission .",
    "the first possibility is essentially what _",
    "secondary _ models would expect ( e.g. miniati et al . 2001 ; dolag & ensslin 2000 ) .",
    "this comes from the combination of two points : the magnetization at @xmath1 g level is believed to be a very common property of the icm ( clarke et al . 2001 ; govoni & feretti 2004 ) , and cr protons accumulated in galaxy clusters for cosmological time scales provide a fairly stable continuous source of injection of secondary electrons and positrons in the icm .    on the other hand ,",
    "an unavoidable prediction of the _ re - acceleration _ scenario is a bi - modality of clusters . in this scenario particles",
    "are supposed to be re  accelerated by mhd turbulence in the icm and this requires enough turbulence to boost electrons at the energies necessary to emit synchrotron radiation at ghz frequencies .",
    "thus giant rhs should be strictly connected to massive and merging systems where indeed enough turbulence can be developed ( cassano & brunetti 2005 ) , and should live for relatively short time",
    " scales ( 1 gyr or less ) because of the finite dissipation time  scale of turbulence . in this scenario",
    "merging clusters are expected to move with time from a _ radio quiet _",
    "region in the @xmath5@xmath6 plane to the @xmath5@xmath6 correlation .",
    "this happens in a relatively short time ",
    "scale , of the order of @xmath7 yrs ( i.e. the acceleration time ",
    "scale of the emitting particles , see fig.19 in brunetti et al .",
    "2004 ) , and thus the region between rhs and _ radio quiet _",
    "clusters in the @xmath5@xmath6 plane should be poorly populated .",
    "thus , the distribution of clusters in the @xmath5@xmath6 plane is important to constrain current models .",
    "from the rosat  eso flux limited x  ray ( reflex ) galaxy cluster catalog ( bhringer et al .",
    "2004 ) and from the extended rosat brightest cluster sample ( ebcs ) catalog ( ebeling et al .",
    "1998 , 2000 ) we selected all clusters with @xmath8 , l@xmath9(0.12.4 kev ) @xmath10 5 @xmath11 10@xmath12 erg s@xmath13 , and with declination @xmath14 ( for the reflex ) and @xmath15 ( for the ebcs ) .",
    "these selection criteria led to a sample of 50 x  ray selected galaxy clusters ( 27 from reflex , 23 from ebcs ) with similar luminosity .",
    "the sample includes 6 clusters with well studied rhs ( a2744 , a1300 , a 2163 , a773 , a2219 , a2390 , e.g. feretti & giovannini 2007 ; bacchi et al .",
    "2003 ) and a1758 for which hint of diffuse emission is also reported ( g99 , ks01 ) .",
    "we carried out gmrt ( giant metrewave radio telescope ) observations at 610 mhz only for 34 clusters in the sample ( those with no high sensitivity radio information already available , and not included in the gmrt cluster key project ) ; each cluster was observed for 23 hrs ( hour angle 35 ) .",
    "thanks to the dirtibution of antennas at gmrt we obtained images for each cluster with resolutions ranging from @xmath16 to @xmath17 and r.m.s .",
    "( 1@xmath18)@xmath19jy / b ( venturi et al .",
    "2007 , v07 ; venturi et al .",
    ", in prep ) which allows us to image both compact and extended sources in the fields .",
    "we detected rhs in 4 of them ( rxcj20032323 ; a209 and rxcj13142515 , v07 ; a697 venturi et al . in prep . ; a relic was also found in a521 , giacintucci et al .",
    "no hint of cluster  scale radio emission was found in the remaining 29 clusters .",
    "for these clusters it is necessary to place solid upper limits to the flux density of their mpc scale radio emission ( few arcmin at the redshifts of our clusters ) . in fig .",
    "1 we report the normalised integrated brightness profiles of well studied rhs : they are quite similar and @xmath2050% of the luminosity , @xmath21 , is emitted within about half radius , @xmath22 .",
    "detection limit based on the brightness within @xmath23 gives a 610 mhz luminosity in w / hz ( @xmath24 is the beam - fwhm ) :    @xmath25    which is @xmath2050 times smaller than luminosities of known giant rhs at @xmath26 ( v07 ) .    in order to derive more solid constraints to use in this paper",
    "we inject fake rhs in our datasets .",
    "we model the brightness profile in fig .",
    "1 with sets of optically thin spheres with different radius and flux densities , and obtain _ families _ of fake rhs with total flux densities s@xmath27 ranging from 3 to 300 mjy and angular diameters from 180 to 350 arcsec . those fake rhs were injected into the uv  components of our cluster datasets by means of the task uvmod in aips , and the resulting datasets were imaged with the procedures given in v07 with the task imagr at resolutions in the range 1025 arcsec .",
    "the injected flux density of rhs is not fully recovered by the imaging and an increasing fraction of injected flux is lost when s@xmath27 decreases , and/or the total angular size increases ; an example is given in fig .  2 .",
    "we also found very little dependence on the resolution of the image , at least in the range 15@xmath28 . we find that the lowest value of the injected flux density that leaves a residual flux in the images which can be reasonably interpreted as due to an extended low brightness radio source on the basis of the standard radio imaging is in the range @xmath20512 mjy .",
    "this marks the value of the upper limit to the injected flux of rhs and scales both with the largest angular size of the fake rhs and with the r.m.s of the final image ( e.g. , fig .",
    "note however , that at this point a residual flux is still formally detected at 45@xmath18 level on an area of a few beams in the low resolution images ( e.g. , fig .  2 ) .",
    "our limits should thus be considered as conservative ; they are typically @xmath202.5 times larger than those in eq.([lmin ] ) .",
    "+ we derive these solid limits to the detection of rhs for 20 clusters observed at the gmrt .",
    "indeed , among the observed 29 clusters with no hint of cluster  scale emission , we excluded a 3444 , a 1682 and z 7160 where extended radio galaxies in the field makes difficult to straightaway apply our procedure , and also excluded 6 clusters in our sample with poor quality of the data ( r.m.s .",
    "@xmath29jy@xmath30b caused by interferences ) .",
    "in fig .  4 we report the distribution of clusters in the @xmath5@xmath6 plane .",
    "giant rhs and upper limits obtained from uvmod simulations ( sect .",
    "3 ) with @xmath310.5 mpc are reported in magenta .",
    "these solid upper limits lie about one order of magnitude below the correlation for giant rhs .",
    "this allows us to firmly establish that the @xmath5@xmath6 correlation ( solid line in fig .",
    "4 , from cassano et al.2006 ) is real and that its lower envelope is not driven by observational biases ( at least for @xmath32erg s@xmath13 , i.e. the selection limit of our clusters ) .",
    "most importantly , we find that clusters with similar @xmath6 and redshift have a clear bimodal distribution . cluster - scale radio emission at the level of presently studied rhs is not ubiquitous in galaxy clusters and only @xmath33 of clusters in our sample host a rh . although no homogeneous high resolution x  ray data are still available for all our clusters , the rhs are found in dynamically disturbed systems , while clusters without rhs are either disturbed or relaxed systems ( v07 ) .",
    "fig .  4 ( green arrows )",
    "shows that even more stringent upper limits are obtained considering radio emission on cluster  core scale ( @xmath22=0.25 mpc ) .",
    "it is challenging for _ secondary _ models to accommodate the observational picture of fig .",
    "these models would expect the cluster ",
    "scale radio emission much common and predict some general @xmath5@xmath6 trend for all clusters with some scattering due to the effect of the different cr proton content and magnetic field among clusters ( e.g. miniati et al . 2001 ; dolag 2006 ) .",
    "thus strong dissipation of the magnetic field in the icm in relatively short time - scales is necessary to reconcile _ secondary _ model expectations with the data , although reconciling this dissipation with present theoretical understanding ( e.g. subramanian et al .",
    "2006 ) and data ( e.g. govoni & feretti 2004 ) might be problematic .",
    "recently pfrommer ( 2007 ) presented numerical simulations of _ secondary _ & _ shock accelerated _ particles .",
    "also in this case extended synchroton emission , at least on cluster  core scale , is predicted to be common , at the level of presently known rhs , and clusters are predicted to follow relatively well defined correlations ( fig.1 in pfrommer 2007 ) with merging and non merging systems lying on the upper and lower envelope of correlations , respectively .",
    "thus similar considerations can be applied also to this scenario .",
    "gamma ray observations of a number of nearby galaxy clusters limit the energy density of cr protons in these clusters to 1020 % of the thermal energy ( pfrommer & ensslin 2004 ; reimer 2004 ) .",
    "the upper limits for clusters with no rhs of our sample allow us to obtain indirect upper limits to the energy density of cr protons in these clusters . indeed , by requiring that radio emission from _ secondary _",
    "e@xmath34 is below the upper limits in fig .  4",
    "one gets constraints on the content of cr protons from which secondaries are injected .",
    "we use the formalism in brunetti & blasi ( 2005 ) to calculate the stationary spectrum of secondary pairs in the icm .",
    "typical limits to the crs content are given in fig.5 by simply assuming average values of thermal density ( @xmath35@xmath36 ) and magnetic field in a sphere of radius @xmath22=0.5 mpc : for @xmath37 g fields and relatively flat spectra of the crs our limits are about one order of magnitude deeper than present egret upper limits ; note that our limits scale with @xmath38 .",
    "limits are also significantly lower than the typical cr energy content of clusters that is claimed from numerical simulations in which crs are accelerated at large scale shocks ( e.g. ryu et al .",
    "+ on the other hand , for steeper cr spectra ( or lower values of the field ) the synchrotron constraints become gradually less stringent and the energy content of crs in our clusters may be considerably larger .",
    "we have reported on constraints on the origin of rhs and on the cr content in the icm obtained via radio observations of a fairly large sample of x  ray luminous clusters at @xmath39 .    in the bulk of these clusters",
    "we do not find evidence of mpc  scale radio emission at the level of rhs .",
    "our conclusions become even more stringent considering radio emission on cluster  core scale , typical of smaller rhs and mini - halos .",
    "we firmly confirm that rh ",
    "clusters follow a _",
    "physical _ correlation between synchrotron and x  ray luminosities .",
    "we find that clusters have a bimodal distribution in the @xmath5@xmath6 plane ( fig .",
    "4 ) ; this is in line with the expectation of the _ re - acceleration scenario_. on the other hand , in order to reconcile these observations with expectations from _ secondary _ models strong dissipation of the magnetic field in the clusters with no radio emission is necessary .",
    "our measurements allow us to also derive simple limits on the presence of cr protons in the icm ( fig .  5 ) .",
    "in the case of relatively flat spectral energy distribution of these crs stringent upper limits can be obtained : the energy density of crs should be @xmath40% of the thermal energy in case of @xmath37 g field strength .",
    "this would make problematic the detection of gamma rays from @xmath41decay in clusters with glast . on the other hand , by assuming steeper spectral energy distributions of these crs ( or lower magnetic fields ) our limits become less stringent .",
