    "the hadronic @xmath0 decay offers an ideal place to reap the properties of the invisible gluons and of the quark - gluon coupling @xcite .",
    "it is well known that strong decay of the @xmath0 particle is suppressed by the phenomenological okubo - zweig - iizuka ( ozi ) rules @xcite , so electromagnetic and radiative transitions become competitive . besides",
    ", the @xmath0 particle can also decay via the weak interactions within the standard model , although the branching ratio is very small , about @xmath13 @xmath14 @xmath15 @xcite , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the lifetime of the @xmath18 meson and the decay width of the @xmath0 particle , respectively . in this paper",
    ", we will estimate the branching ratios for the bottom - changing nonleptonic @xmath0 @xmath1 @xmath2 , @xmath3 weak decays with perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) approach @xcite .",
    "the motivation is listed as follows .    from the experimental point of view , ( 1 ) over @xmath19 @xmath0 samples have been accumulated at belle @xcite . many more upsilons could be collected with great precision at the forthcoming superkekb and the running upgraded lhc .",
    "the abundant @xmath0 samples provide a golden opportunity to search for the @xmath0 weak decays which in some cases might be detectable .",
    "theoretical studies on the @xmath0 weak decays are just necessary to offer a ready reference .",
    "( 2 ) for the two - body @xmath0 @xmath1 @xmath2 , @xmath3 decays , final states with opposite charges have definite energies and momenta in the rest frame of the @xmath0 particle .",
    "besides , identification of a single explicitly flavored @xmath20 meson is free from inefficiently double tagging above the @xmath11 threshold @xcite , and can provide a conclusive evidence of the @xmath0 weak decay .",
    "of course , small branching ratios make the observation of the @xmath0 weak decays extremely challenging , and evidences of an abnormally large production rate of single @xmath20 mesons in the @xmath0 decay might be a hint of new physics @xcite .    from the theoretical point of view",
    ", the bottom - changing upsilon weak decays permit one to cross check parameters obtained from @xmath21 meson decay .",
    "the color - favored @xmath0 @xmath1 @xmath2 , @xmath3 decays have been estimated with the naive factorization ( nf ) approximation in previous works @xcite .",
    "an obvious deficiency of nf approximation is the absence of strong phases and the renormalization scale from hadronic matrix elements ( hme ) .",
    "recently , several attractive methods have been developed to evaluate hme , such as pqcd @xcite , the qcd factorization ( qcdf ) @xcite and soft and collinear effective theory @xcite , which could give reasonable explanation for many measurements on @xmath22 hadronic decays .",
    "the @xmath0 @xmath1 @xmath2 , @xmath3 decays are calculated at the next - to - leading ( nlo ) order with the qcdf approach @xcite . in this paper , the @xmath0 @xmath1 @xmath2 , @xmath3 weak decays will be evaluated with the pqcd approach to check the consistency of prediction on branching ratios among different models .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec02 ] ,",
    "we present the theoretical framework and the amplitudes for the @xmath0 @xmath1 @xmath2 , @xmath3 decays with the pqcd approach .",
    "section [ sec03 ] is devoted to numerical results and discussion .",
    "the last section is our summary .",
    "the effective hamiltonian responsible for the @xmath0 @xmath1 @xmath2 , @xmath3 decays is @xcite @xmath23 where @xmath24 @xmath7 @xmath25 @xcite is the fermi coupling constant ; the cabibbo - kabayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) factors are expanded as a power series in the wolfenstein parameter @xmath26 @xmath14 @xmath27 @xcite , @xmath28 the wilson coefficients @xmath29 summarize the physical contributions above scales of @xmath30 , and have properly been calculated to the nlo order with the renormalization group improved perturbation theory .",

    "sometimes the high - order corrections to hme produce collinear and/or soft logarithms based on collinear factorization approximation , for example , the spectator scattering amplitudes within the qcdf framework @xcite .",
    "the pqcd approach advocates that @xcite this inconsistent treatment on hme could be smeared by retaining the transverse momentum of quarks and introducing the sudakov factor .",
