    "airy beams ( aib ) are exact solutions of the time - harmonic _ parabolic _ wave equation ( pe ) in free space , that are generated by an airy function initial condition in an extended aperture . the aib s have attracted a considerable attention mainly because of their intriguing features , the most distinctive one is the propagation along _ curved _ trajectories @xcite .",
    "other intriguing properties are the _ weak diffraction _ @xcite and _ self - healing _",
    "( i.e. , regeneration of the solutions if the beam is partially obstructed ) @xcite .",
    "many interesting applications that utilize these properties have been suggested , e.g. @xcite .    in a previous paper @xcite",
    ", we provided a cogent wave - based description to the 2d - aib s that clearly explains all these features . using uniform asymptotic evaluation of kirchhoff s radiation integral @xcite and uniform geometrical optics ( ugo ) @xcite",
    ", it has been shown that the aib _ is not _",
    "generated by the main lobe of the airy function in the aperture , but it is in fact a caustic of rays that emerge sideways from the side lobes of the extended aperture distribution .",
    "this implies that the aib can not be regarded as a `` beam field '' in the sense that the evolution of the main lobe along the curved propagation trajectory is not described by a local wave dynamics .",
    "it has also been established that ray theory in conjunction with the ugo provides an accurate solution for the aib , which fully agrees with the conventional pe solution of @xcite when the latter is valid .",
    "the ugo solution is accurate even at large observation ranges where the pe solution fails due to the curving beam axis .",
    "it has been noted that these ray - based tools can be used to construct other curving beam solutions in uniform and non - uniform media by back - projecting the rays from the caustic to the aperture and synthesizing the aperture distribution that focuses onto that caustic @xcite .",
    "this concept has been applied recently in @xcite .    using the ray description of @xcite we have also constructed in @xcite a class of _ non - dispersive _ airy pulsed beams ( aipb ) .",
    "these solutions are obtained by synthesizing the aperture field distribution such that the ray skeleton is the same for all frequencies .",
    "this scaling of the aperture distribution , unlike previous suggestions @xcite , ensures that all frequency components focus on the same curved caustic , thus giving rise to a pulse that propagates along the curved trajectory with no dispersion .",
    "a closed - form time - domain expression for the aipb has also been derived in @xcite using the spectral theory of transients ( stt ) @xcite .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to clarify the wave mechanism of the 3d - aib by deriving uniform ray - based solutions that reveal the local features of the field .",
    "furthermore , these solutions rely on the exact ray and caustic topology of the aib and therefore do not suffer from the limitations of the conventional pe solution .",
    "we note that due to the curving of the beam trajectory , the pe solution is valid only for short propagation distances and in particular it does not predict the termination of the aib at a certain range , as will be discussed here . in order to meet this goal",
    "we first analyze the ray topology of the 3d - aib ( sec .",
    "[ caustic_top ] ) and then use this analysis to derive uniform solutions that are structured _ explicitly _ upon the local geometry of the caustic ( secs .  4 - 5 ) .",
    "as will be explained below , we emphasize here _ local _ uniform solutions rather than _ globally _ uniform solutions since the former yields explicit solutions that explain all the parameters and features of the field .",
    "the analysis is performed within the framework of the 3d _ non - dispersive _ aib , defined in sec .",
    "[ non_dis_aib ] such that the ray skeleton is frequency - independent .",
    "the non - dispersive formulation not only simplifies the ray analysis by making it more transparent , but it also enables the construction of the non - dispersive aipb as noted above .",
    "this subject will be explored in a subsequent publication @xcite , where the results of the present work will be used to synthesize 3d - aipb and to derive closed - form time - domain solutions .    in sec .",
    "[ caustic_top ] we study the exact ray and caustic topology of the 3d - aib , concentrating on the region near the curved beam axis and deferring the discussion on the global caustic topology to sec .  [ caustic_complete ] .",
    "the analytical details are summarized separately in appendix  [ exact_caustic_eqs ] .",
    "the topology near the beam axis has many intricate features and it is considerably more complicated than the approximate ray topology of the 3d pe solution in @xcite or the 2d case in @xcite .",
    "specifically , we show that the main lobe of the aib is described by a cusped double - layered caustic which is of the hyperbolic umbilic type @xcite ( see figs .",
    "[ fig_caustic_cross_z][fig_caustic_exact ] ) .",
    "we also identify the range where the isolated hyperbolic umbilic caustic that describes the aib field near its propagation axis , evolves into the more complicated parabolic umbilic caustic considered in sec .",
