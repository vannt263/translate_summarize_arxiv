    "radio - frequency ( rf ) fields are used in cold atom experiments for different purposes : for instance , evaporative cooling performed in a magnetic trap relies on rf field coupling between the different atomic magnetic states  @xcite .",
    "this technique led to the first observation of bose - einstein condensation ( bec )  @xcite .",
    "also , rf pulses are used for dissociating ultracold molecules produced from ultracold gases through feshbach resonances  @xcite .",
    "more recently , rf fields have been used together with static magnetic fields for trapping utracold atoms at a temperature of a few @xmath4k in unusual geometries  @xcite .",
    "there is a growing interest for these `` rf - based traps '' among atomic physicists , for creating double well traps on atom chips  @xcite or proposing new kinds of confining potentials  @xcite . in both cases ,",
    "a single frequency rf signal must be frequency swept over some range , often larger than the initial frequency , following a precise time function lasting several seconds .",
    "typically the rf frequency is varied between 1  mhz and a few tens of mhz in 0.1  s to 10  s in the ramping stage , and held at the final frequency for seconds in the plateau stage .",
    "for cooling purposes , commercial rf generators fit physicists needs reasonably well , even if a better resolution in arbitrary frequency ramps would be appreciated .",
    "however , in the case of rf - based trapping , the requirements are stronger .",
    "the main difference between these two situations is as follows : in evaporative cooling the cold atomic sample is located away from the region of efficient coupling , whereas in the rf - based trapping scheme the atoms sit exactly at the point where the rf field has the largest effect .",
    "the quality of the rf source is then much more important than for evaporative cooling .",
    "in fact , the cloud position is directly related to the value of the rf field frequency , and the trap restoring force , or equivalently the oscillation frequency @xmath5 in the harmonic approximation , is linked to the rf amplitude . as a result , any amplitude noise , frequency noise or phase noise of the rf signal during the ramp or the plateau leads to a heating of the cold atomic cloud .",
    "this motivated the construction of a synthesizer fitting our requirements .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : theory ] we give explicit expressions for the heating of the cold atom sample for frequency and amplitude noise in the case of rf - based trapping . in section  [ sec : devicedescription ] , we describe our rf synthesizer .",
    "finally , section  [ sec : results ] is devoted to experimental results on its performance and comparison between the different rf sources tested on the bec experiment .",
    "in this section , we will focus on the rf - dressed trap that we experimentally produce in the laboratory  @xcite .",
    "the extension of the main conclusions to other rf - dressed trap geometries is straightforward .",
    "the trap confines the atoms in all three space dimensions .",
    "the trapping force arises from the interaction between the linearly polarized rf field @xmath6 and the atoms in the presence of an inhomogeneous magnetic field .",
    "this interaction results in a transverse confinement of the atoms to the surface of an ellipsoid .",
    "the atoms are free to move along the confining surface , resulting in a kind of `` bubble trap ''  @xcite . due to gravity ,",
    "however , the atoms are concentrated at the bottom of the ellipsoid .",
    "their motion is pendulum - like in the horizontal directions , and imposed by the rf interaction along the vertical @xmath7 axis .",
    "this last direction is thus the most sensitive to the rf field properties ( frequency @xmath8 , amplitude @xmath9 ) and we will concentrate on the vertical motion in the following . along this direction , heating or atomic losses may arise from frequency or amplitude noise , phase hops or sudden frequency hops during the rf ramp .      very generally , for atoms in a one dimensional harmonic trap with a trapping frequency @xmath10 ,",
    "any effect producing a jitter in the trap position @xmath7 results in linear heating through dipolar excitation .",
    "the average energy of the cold atomic cloud @xmath11 increases linearly as  @xcite : @xmath12 where @xmath13 , @xmath14 is the atomic mass and @xmath15 is the one - sided power spectral density ( psd ) of the position fluctuations @xmath16 , defined as the fourier transform of the time correlation function  @xcite @xmath17 the time variations of energy , @xmath11 , and temperature , @xmath18 , are related by @xmath19 .",
    "the factor 3 arises because only one degree of freedom is responsible for the temperature increase , as is the case in our atom trap .",
    "the vertical trap position @xmath7 is linked to the rf frequency @xmath8 by @xmath20 such that @xmath15 is directly proportional to @xmath21 , the psd of relative frequency noise of the rf source , through : @xmath22 the function @xmath23 depends on the geometry of the static magnetic field . in a quadrupolar field , for instance , @xmath23 is linear with @xmath8 and its derivative is simply a constant . from eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : dipolar_heating ] ) and ( [ eqn : sz_to_sy ] ) , we infer that the linear heating rate is proportional to @xmath24 .    to fix orders of magnitude , within the static magnetic field of our ioffe - pritchard trap  @xcite",
    ", @xmath10 may be adjusted between 600 and 1500  hz and the typical temperature of the cold rubidium 87 atoms ranges from 0.5 to 5  @xmath4k . to maintain a temperature below condensation threshold for a few seconds , a linear temperature increase below 0.1",
    "@xmath4k / s is necessary .",
    "this rate corresponds to @xmath25  nm/@xmath26 for an intermediate trap frequency of 1000  hz and @xmath27  mhz , which in turn corresponds to a one - sided psd of relative frequency fluctuations of the rf source @xmath28  db / hz .      fluctuations of the rf field amplitude @xmath9 are responsible for parametric heating in the vertical direction .",
    "the trapping frequency @xmath10 is inversely proportional to @xmath29  @xcite : @xmath30 here , @xmath31 is the gyromagnetic ratio of the atom and @xmath32 is the total atomic spin ( @xmath33 for rubidium 87 in its upper hyperfine state ) .",
    "the atoms are assumed to be polarized in their extreme @xmath34 substate .",
    "the cloud temperature increases exponentially due to amplitude noise with a rate @xmath35 , where @xmath36 and @xmath37 is the psd of the relative rf amplitude noise  @xcite . in order to perform experiments with the bec within a time scale of a few seconds",
    ", @xmath35 should not exceed @xmath38  s@xmath39 .",
    "again , for a typical oscillation frequency of 1000  hz , this corresponds to @xmath40  db / hz .",
    "this requirement is rather easy to match and does not limit the choice of the rf source , as -110  db / hz is commonly reached .",
    "however , particular care must be taken in the choice and installation of the rf amplifier usually used after the source .",
    "controlling the phase of the rf source is not a crucial point for evaporative cooling , but is an issue in the case of rf - based traps , where it is associated with trap losses . in the latter situation",
    ", the atomic spin follows an effective magnetic field oscillating at the rf frequency .",
    "a phase hop results in a sudden flip of this effective field , the atomic spin being then misaligned with the new direction of the field .",
    "some of the atoms end up with a spin oriented incorrectly and escape the trap .",
    "for this reason , phase hops should be avoided .",
    "this is difficult to achieve with an analog synthesizer over a wide frequency sweep .",
    "by contrast , direct digital synthesis ( dds ) technology is well adapted to this requirement@xcite .",
    "the drawback of dds technology is that , although the phase is continuous , the frequency is increased by @xmath41 successive discrete steps @xmath42 .",
    "a sudden change in the rf frequency also results in atomic losses , through the same mechanism as for phase hops .",
    "the effective magnetic field rotates , at most , by the small angle @xmath43  @xcite . for a linear ramp over a frequency range @xmath44 , the fraction of atoms remaining after",
    "the full ramp is of order @xmath45 . given the expression for @xmath46 , this reads : @xmath47 thus , for the remaining fraction to be larger than 95% , the number of frequency steps should be larger than @xmath48",
    ". for example , for a 2  mhz ramp with a typical rf amplitude of 200  mg , @xmath41 should be larger than 16,000 .",
    "in addition to this loss effect , a sudden change in the rf frequency results in a sudden shift of the position of the rf - dressed trap .",
    "this may cause dipolar heating of the atoms , especially if this frequency change occurs every trap period .",
    "the frequency steps should thus be as small as possible , a few tens hz to a hundred hz typically .",
    "our experiment has the following requirements . first , during the ramp the gap between two successive frequencies must fulfil the criterion discussed in section  [ sec : frequencysteps ] .",
    "second , adiabaticity criteria require a controlled , optimized ramp .",
    "third , the ramp duration should be tunable from one experiment to the other on a time scale ranging from 50  ms to 10  s. finally , frequency and amplitude noise must be small enough , as discussed in previous section .    given the amplitude of the frequency sweep we need to perform in our experiment , dds technology appears to be an ideal solution .",
    "we previously used a commercial dds - based rf generator , the stanford ds-345 .",
    "its memory length is limited to 1,500 frequency points for each waveform with an adjustable step duration of 40  msample / s/@xmath41 , with @xmath41=1 to @xmath49 .",
    "the major inconvenience of this device is that it is unable to hold the final frequency at the end of the ramp . instead ,",
    "the frequency sweep is looped indefinitely .",
    "it forced us to sacrifice either frequency resolution during the ramp or duration of the plateau . to benefit from both a low noise rf spectrum during the ramp and a very small frequency step , and to improve the possibilities of the rf source",
    ", we designed a digital rf synthesizer with a @xmath50 memory length and great agility , fitted to our experimental requirements .",
    "the main features of the rf synthesizer are as follows .",
    "it is able to generate 262,144 sine waves in a row in the radio frequency band ( dc - 10  mhz ) , owing to its 1  m - byte fast asynchronous static random access memory ( sram ) .",
    "each frequency is an integer chosen by the user .",
    "a key feature of the device is a variable sample frequency over the sequence , as the duration of each generated frequency can be tuned from 1  @xmath4s to 1 hour .    the general architecture of the device is sketched in fig .  [ fig : layout ] .",
    "it is made up of one evaluation kit dds board , and a `` starter kit '' field programmable gate array ( fpga ) board .",
    "the device is managed by a personal computer ( pc ) .",
    "the dds is clocked by an ultra - stable external reference signal .",
    "the output of the dds is a sine wave , filtered through a 10  mhz low - pass filter .",
    "the frequency ramp synthesis starts when a ttl signal is sent to the device .    ]",
    "the dds board combines digital parameters and an analog reference clock frequency to generate a sine wave  @xcite .",
    "the heart of the dds board is a digitally programmable device using dds technology , the ad9851 .",
    "it has a 32-bit phase accumulator , a 14-bit digital phase - to - amplitude converter and a 10-bit digital - to - analog converter ( dac ) .",
    "its maximum clock frequency is 180  mhz , and its maximum output frequency is 70  mhz .",
    "the phase , relative to the clock signal , is encoded in 5 bits , and is adjustable to any value from 0 to @xmath51 .",
    "this results in a rather poor phase resolution of 196  mrad .",
    "the fpga board manages the 1  mb memory , the time settings and the input / output of the device through serial port .",
    "the fpga is a xilinx spartan-3 xc3s200 , providing @xmath52 logic gates .",
    "these logic gates are designed with vhdl  @xcite . a universal asynchronous receiver transmitter(uart ) and a picoblaze microcontroller",
    "are loaded into the fpga , in order to communicate through serial port to the pc and to load the on - board memory .",
    "we wrote our own vhdl scripts to manage the dds board and the fpga in - board memory .",
    "the fpga board is clocked internally at 50  mhz .",
    "the output sample rate of the device depends on the number of clock cycles @xmath53 between frequency data transferred to the dds board .",
    "we set @xmath54 so that @xmath55 , large enough thus ensuring safe operation of the frequency data .",
    "software was developed in c with cvi labwindows in order to configure the device .",
    "the user writes a plain text file ordering all the frequencies of the desired frequency ramp .",
    "the set of frequencies is separated into 10 groups of adjustable length , with a given sample rate for each .",
    "the group lengths and the corresponding sample rate are each translated by the software into 4 bytes .",
    "in addition , each frequency in a given group , an integer written as a decimal number , is translated into 4 bytes ( 32 bits ) .",
    "the software sends these bytes by serial port to the fpga board .",
    "the clock frequency @xmath56 and its phase noise level are the key points for setting the frequency performance of the device .",
    "the lower the phase noise of the clock signal , the lower is the _ minimum _ phase noise of the output frequency of the device ( see section [ subsec : freqperf ] ) .",
    "the clock signal used for the experiment , see next section , is the 10  mhz clock signal from an ultra - stable oven controlled crystal oscillator ( ocxo ) bva-8600 .",
    "its phase noise psd is @xmath57",
    "db.rad@xmath58/hz at 1 hz . as this clock frequency is very close to the desired maximum output frequency ( @xmath59  10  mhz , see next section ) , and to fulfil shannon s theorem  @xcite , we generate a higher clock frequency by using the internal frequency clock multiplier , at @xmath60 , of the dds board .",
    "the device presented in section  [ sec : devicedescription ] was first tested for its frequency stability performance , as described in section  [ subsec : freqperf ] and summarized in table  [ tab : perfo ] .",
    "it was then integrated into a bose - einstein condensation experiment , see section  [ 2dtrap ] .        by construction ,",
    "digitization yields to inaccuracies in frequency synthesis .",
    "the output frequency of 32-bit resolution dds is given by @xmath61 where @xmath62 is a binary 32-bit tuning word .",
    "the output frequency can thus differ slightly from the desired frequency .",
    "as @xmath56 = 60  mhz , the maximum digitization error @xmath63 is @xmath64/@xmath65 = 0.014  hz .",
    "as our software only takes integer frequencies as input , a given frequency @xmath66 will be synthesized without sampling error if it may be written exactly as an integer in the form given at eq .",
    "( [ eq : sampling ] ) .",
    "this condition is written as : @xmath67 where @xmath68 is a positive integer and @xmath69 is the power of 2 in the prime factorization of the clock frequency @xmath56 . in our case , @xmath70  hz and @xmath71 so that every frequency verifying @xmath72 will yield to no digitization error . @xmath68 should be less than @xmath73 for the desired frequency to be in the synthesizer range ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "in addition , when the ad9851 converts the calculated phase to an effective output amplitude , only the first most significant 14 bits are used , even though the ad9851 is a 32-bit synthesizer , in order to handle practicable number of entries in a lookup table . truncating the phase results in errors in amplitude that are periodic in the time domain .",
    "these errors will be seen as spurs in the frequency domain . however , for particular frequencies which are exactly encoded by the first 14 bits ( the last 18 bits are 0 . ) , the phase is not truncated at all , yielding no spurious effects and the best psd of phase noise .",
    "this occurs for every frequency satisfying @xmath75 with @xmath68 a positive integer . as @xmath56 = 60  mhz",
    ", we have @xmath76  hz . the most stringent condition being the first one , we will denote the frequencies satisfying eq .",

    "the measurement bench is sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : sketchbeatmeas ] . in order to generate a tunable reference signal in the rf range we used an analog synthesizer , rhode & schwartz sml-01 ( r&s ) , for synthesizing a signal at a high frequency , and then divided by 100 to give @xmath66 for subsequent mixing .",
    "the beat note was recorded and analyzed by a digital fft analyzer hp 3562a sampling at 256  khz .",

    "to illustrate this fact , the same measurements were repeated with the improved ocxo of a ds-345 , the erc eros-750-sbr-4 , as master oscillator .",
    "no significant change in the frequency performances were noticed at non magic frequencies . at a magic frequency , the psd of phase noise increased to @xmath90  db.rad@xmath91/hz , which is consistent with the phase noise specifications of this quartz .",

    "heating during the plateau stage seemed to be completely suppressed  @xcite .",

    "this last value yields a linewidth of 30  mhz over a 100  khz bandwidth .",
    "the corresponding relative frequency noise level is 90  db below the requirements of our rf - dressed trapping experiment .",
    "the amplitude noise of the dds synthesizer is measured to be below @xmath95  db.hz@xmath39 at frequencies above 1  khz .",
    "amplitude noise turns out to be the limiting noise present in our rf chain at the present time due to the several db noise figures of the attenuators and amplifiers in use in our experiment .",
    "they actually increase the rf amplitude noise to @xmath57  db.hz@xmath39 at 1  khz , which still remains 25  db below our experiment requirements .",
    "all these features make our dds apparatus very well - suited for cold atom experiments . it may be used for optimized evaporative cooling implementation , with arbitrary frequency ramp profiles including a final `` rf - knife '' , in a standard bec experiment .",
    "it is of particular importance in the case of atom chip experiments  @xcite , where the cooling ramp is usually done very quickly ( 1  s typically ) .",
    "it is also ideal for developing new rf - based traps . in particular ,",
    "the possibility of configuring the time step , that is the duration of each frequency point , is very attractive for our application .",
    "this feature is all the more interesting in that the memory can be separated in several zones , each being allocated a chosen number of points and a chosen time step , so we can dilate or compress in time the whole or a part of the ramp , while keeping the same frequency series .",
    "for instance , if we want to accomplish a ramp of @xmath41 frequency values with a small time resolution , say 10  @xmath4s , and then keep the final frequency constant over ten seconds , we have the ability to address a first memory zone with the first @xmath108 points and a 10  @xmath4s time step , and a second memory zone with the last frequency value and a 10  s time step .",
    "a single time step over the whole sequence would have forced us to sacrifice either the resolution of the ramp or the duration of the final plateau .",
    "the device was successfully implemented in our ultracold atom experiment .",
    "first , we set boundary specifications on the rf source performances for trapping experiments regarding heating rate and lifetime . in the same manner , we set conditions on maximum phase hops and frequency step magnitude . with our home",
    "made device , we observed no heating due to the rf source during the plateau step . a remaining heating rate of @xmath109 was identical to the one obtained in the magnetic trap and was limited by other noise sources , presumably scattered photons . despite the very large number of frequency points , heating along the vertical axis is still present during the loading stage of the rf - dressed trap .",
    "we attribute this heating to non - adiabatic deformation of the confining potential during the loading process , which we could not make slower due to the other noise sources .    while the actual performances of the device are already very good , a few improvements are still possible .",
    "first , the memory length of the dds is basically determined by the fpga in - board memory size . a larger sample size",
    "may easily be implemented by replacing the board , provided that the data transfer rate is improved through the use of an ethernet port or a usb port .",
    "second , the sample rate is 1  mhz , limited by the data transfer rate from the fpga board .",
    "higher fpga clock frequency , or smaller clock counts @xmath110 , would allow higher sample rates .",
    "the frequency limit due to the ad-9851 dds chip itself is 3  mhz .",
    "this modification would improve the temporal resolution by a factor of 3 .",
    "finally , the maximum output frequency of 10  mhz may be very easily increased to 20  mhz by replacing the low - pass filter . by clocking the dds with a 180  mhz clock",
    ", one could even reach output frequencies up to 60  mhz . note that with a similar dds chip , the ad 9858 , frequency clocks as high as 1 ghz are allowed , which makes possible the synthesis of rf frequencies up to 330  mhz .",
