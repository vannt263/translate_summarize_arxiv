    "[ str](b ) ) .",

    "[ dis](b ) and ( d ) .",
    "the softened phonon at x in fig .",

    "the formation of cr tetramers shown in fig .",
    "[ dis](b ) is perfectly consistent with that reported by toriyama _",
    "et al._.@xcite the stripe - type arrangement of cr tetramers explains the unit cell increasing in the _ ab _ plane after the mit .",
    "namely , the normal modes of softened phonon at x is exactly consistent with the experimental lattice distortions .",
    "figure  [ dis](c ) and ( d ) present the lattice displacements by the softened phonon at m , which is the previously suggested peierls nesting vector , q@xmath26=2@xmath27.@xcite the formation of cr tetramers is also obtained in this case , as shown in fig .",
    "[ dis](d ) .",
    "however , the arrangement of cr tetramers in the _ ab _ plane is different from the experimentally observed stripe - type . in this case",
    ", the arrangement is of uniform - type , as shown in fig . [",
    "xmg](b ) , which can not explain the increasing unit cell from the fm phase to the fi phase .",
    "this results is somehow expected because m point in the primitive cell of the fm phase is the same position as @xmath24 point in the conventional tetragonal cell of the fm phase .",
    "that is why the structural instability at m produces the uniform - type arrangement of cr tetramers , which does not increase the unit cell of the conventional tetragonal structure in the _ ab _ plane .",
    "we thus suggest that the peierls distortion vector * q * that yields the peierls instability is x ( 0 , 0 , 1/2 ) in the primitive cell of the body - centered tetragonal structure , not m ( 1/2 , 1/2 , @xmath20 ) .",
    "this result is indeed consistent with that from total energy calculations .",
    "we checked the total energies of modulated structures corresponding to the softened phonon modes at x , m , and @xmath24 with varying associated displacements . at each mode , the total energy has the minimum at the equilibrium displacement .",
    "it is found that the total energy of the modulated structure due to x phonon mode is the lowest , while that due to m phonon mode is the highest .",
    "this result is in agreement with the above phonon mode analysis .",
    "the main difference between the lattice displacements of softened phonons at x and m lies in the linking of cr - cr in the double - chains of the edge - shared cro@xmath8 octahedra .",
    "if cr atoms in each chain move oppositely , the cr - cr dimerization of zig - zag type is formed in the double - chain , as shown in fig .",
    "[ dis](d ) . otherwise , there is no cr - cr dimerization ( fig .",
    "[ dis](b ) ) . due to these two possibilities of cr - cr linkings in the double - chains , there occur three types of arrangements of cr tetramers,@xcite as shown in fig .",
    "[ xmg ] . the stripe - type in fig .",
    "[ xmg](a ) contains the half of double - chains with cr dimers , while the uniform - type in fig .",
    "[ xmg](b ) and the checkerboard - type in fig .",

    "the sizes of energy gaps of three cases are 0.1@xmath280.13 ev , which are similar to that of the fi phase.@xcite this result indicates that the insulating nature of the fi phase originates from the formation of cr tetramers in the four - chain columns , not from the cr - cr dimers in the double - chains .",

    "in fact , the cr _ d@xmath31_-o _",
    "p@xmath26 _ spin transfer path in the fi phase is emphasized in the recent nmr paper.@xcite this hybridization is important for the formation of cr tetramer , because cr ions in tetramer are linked with o(2 ) .",
    "therefore , @xmath3 effect facilitates the transition from the fm phase to the fi phase by increasing the hybridization between cr _",
    "d@xmath31 _ and o(2 ) _ p@xmath26_. thus , this increased hybridization is expected to cause the structural instability in the phonon dispersion of the fm phase , so as to produce the stabilized cr tetramers .",
    "phonon data and the cdd result are reminiscent of the correlation assisted peierls transition or mott - peierls transition in vo@xmath0.@xcite but the unique feature of k@xmath0cr@xmath1o@xmath2 is that the mott - peierls transition occurs in the fully spin - polarized band .",

    "the energy gain from the lattice distortion in this case is @xmath28 19 mev / f.u ..",
    "in conclusion , based on the systematic studies of electronic and phonon properties , we have found that k@xmath0cr@xmath1o@xmath2 is a strongly correlated system having the coulomb correlation effect both in the fm and the fi phases .",
