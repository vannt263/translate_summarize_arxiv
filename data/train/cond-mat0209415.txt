    "many spin systems exhibit exotic low - temperature phases , frequently as a result of competing interactions coupled with suitable ground - state degeneracy . in this paper",
    "we study a borderline case in which , although neither frustration nor macroscopic ground - state entropy are present , a critical phase ( i.e. with power - law decay of correlations against distance ) arises for a finite temperature range above zero .",
    "the prototypical system in which such sort of phase occurs is the two - dimensional @xmath9 model  @xcite .",
    "the corresponding transition from the high - temperature ( paramagnetic ) to the critical phase , characterized by an exponential divergence of the correlation length , is known as kosterlitz - thouless ( kt ) transition .",
    "although the continuous symmetry of @xmath9 spins plays an important role in the formation of vortices , whose presence is an essential feature of the low - temperature behaviour , it was soon realized that critical phases could be sustained also in some two - dimensional magnets with discrete spin symmetry .",
    "examples are @xmath10 models with @xmath11  @xcite , and models with a macroscopically degenerate ground state to which suitable degeneracy - lifting interactions are added .",
    "the latter case is illustrated by the triangular ising antiferromagnet in a uniform magnetic field  @xcite , or with ferromagnetic second - neighbour interactions  @xcite .",
    "we consider the uniformly anisotropic potts model with nearest - neighbour couplings on a square lattice  @xcite , whose hamiltonian reads : @xmath12 where the potts spins @xmath13 take any one of @xmath14 values , and the lattice site coordinates are given by @xmath15 .",
    "our interest is in the mixed ( ferro - antiferromagnetic ) case  @xcite @xmath16 , @xmath17 . for any @xmath14 ,",
    "the hamiltonian is unfrustrated , as the product of interactions around plaquettes is always positive .",
    "the ground state of an @xmath18 system has degeneracy @xmath19 ; thus , even though this diverges in the thermodynamic limit for @xmath20 , the residual entropy per spin approaches zero as @xmath21 .",
    "the @xmath22 mixed model which will concern us here has attracted special attention  @xcite , as it is believed to exhibit a kt transition .",
    "furthermore , evidence has been found that no transition occurs for @xmath23  @xcite .",
    "these two findings may in fact be viewed as complementary  @xcite . in previous work ,",
    "a great deal of effort was dedicated to calculating the critical temperature @xmath3 above which the system is paramagnetic , particularly the variation of @xmath3 against the ratio @xmath24 , with a rather large degree of scatter in the corresponding results  @xcite .",
    "although , in these latter references , assorted evidence is quoted in favour of the view that the transition is indeed `` of an unconventional type ''  @xcite , a more precise characterization is attempted only in  @xcite , where the correlation lengths from monte carlo studies of @xmath25 systems , @xmath26 , are shown to fit reasonably well to the exponential form in @xmath27 , expected to hold close to a kt transition  @xcite .",
    "an investigation of the problem in its @xmath28-dimensional quantum version  @xcite lends numerical support to the respective form for the case , namely the mass gap vanishing as @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the temperature - like coupling .",
    "however , the combined effects of small system sizes and uncertainty in the determination of @xmath31 allow the authors of  @xcite to conclude only that @xmath32 .    as regards the low - temperature region ,",
    "the critical ( or massless ) phase is analysed in some detail in  @xcite ; upon consideration of the roomany - wyld approximants  @xcite to the beta - function  @xcite , it is deemed as plausible that the mass gap vanishes all the way from @xmath33 to @xmath31 ( corresponding , in the classical analog , to a critical phase from @xmath4 to @xmath3 ) . in a monte carlo renormalization group study of the chiral potts model  @xcite ( with the parameters set in such a way as to map onto the present model  @xcite ) ,",
    "the correlation functions are shown to behave consistently with the existence of a critical phase .",
    "however , the temperature range considered in  @xcite goes only halfway down to zero from @xmath3 .",
    "thus , it seems worthwhile investigating the behaviour of this system in more detail , both ( a ) at the transition and ( b ) at low temperatures . in connection with ( b ) , it must be recalled that , for triangular ising antiferromagnets with second - neighbour ferromagnetic interactions  @xcite , the critical phase does not extend all the way down to @xmath4 : there is an ordered phase with nonzero magnetization for a finite temperature range _ below _ the kt phase .",
    "while strictly similar behaviour should not be expected in the present case ( since here the ground state has zero macroscopic magnetization ) , the question still remains of precisely how the ( highly anisotropic ) correlations spread at low temperatures . in  @xcite , arguments are given to show that slightly above @xmath4 an effective ferromagnetic coupling arises between second - neighbour rows of ferromagnetically coupled spins .",
    "this would single out a small subset of row configurations , namely @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36  @xcite as energetically more favourable .",
    "it appears that the effect of this on the free energy ( hence , on the corresponding thermodynamic state ) has not been quantitatively investigated so far .",
    "we apply numerical transfer - matrix ( tm ) methods to the @xmath22 mixed potts model of equation  ( [ eq:1 ] ) , on strips of a square lattice of width @xmath1 sites with periodic boundary conditions across ( except where domain - wall free energies are analysed , in which case both periodic and twisted boundary conditions are considered ) .",
    "we shall restrict ourselves to @xmath37 .",
    "in section  [ sec : smg ] we consider the scaling of correlation lengths , as obtained from the two largest eigenvalues of the tm . along both directions @xmath38 and @xmath39 of equation  ( [ eq:1 ] ) . from these",
    "we calculate the ratios of scaled gaps , which provide relevant information on the extent of the critical phase . in section  [ sec : dws ] , domain - wall free energies are calculated , and their associated correlation lengths are investigated ; in section  [ sec : tc ] the region near the transition from critical to paramagnetic behaviour is examined , especially as regards the form in which the thermodynamic correlation length diverges as @xmath40 ; finally , in section  [ sec : conc ] , concluding remarks are made .",
    "here we consider the largest correlation length @xmath41 on a strip of width @xmath0 , _",
    "i.e. _ the one given by @xmath42 where @xmath43 are the two largest eigenvalues of the tm in absolute value .",
    "thus it picks up the slowest decay of correlations along the specified direction of iteration of the tm .    with the correlation function @xmath44  @xcite , for the ferromagnetic direction one has @xmath45 , while in the antiferromagnetic direction @xmath46 . as remarked in @xcite , the phenomenogical - renormalisation equation for the critical temperature , @xmath47 only admits a fixed point @xmath48 when the tm is taken along the ferromagnetic direction .",
    "= 8.5 cm    the raw data for @xmath49 against temperature are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , respectively ( a ) for the tm taken in the ferro ( f ) and",
    "( b ) antiferromagnetic ( af ) directions . in the latter case ,",
    "curves for consecutive strip widths get almost tangent as @xmath0 grows , in the region @xmath50 ( the @xmath51 and @xmath52 curves reach within one part in @xmath53 of each other , at @xmath54 ) . a clearer understanding of both sets of data can be gained as follows .    for the case of fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ( a ) we plot the ratio of scaled mass gaps  @xcite @xmath55/ \\left[\\,l^\\prime\\,\\xi_{l^\\prime}^{-1}(t)\\,\\right]\\ , \\qquad { \\rm ( f ) }    \\label{eq:3}\\ ] ] where we always take @xmath56 . at the fixed point of equation  ( [ eq:2 ] ) ,",
    "@xmath57 , and one expects it to remain close to this value for an extended temperature interval if a critical phase is present  @xcite .",
    "indeed this is what happens here , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] .",
    "starting slightly below the respective @xmath48 , and down to the lowest temperatures reached before running into numerical problems ( typically @xmath58 ) , the curves remain rather flat .",
    "the values of @xmath59 at which they stabilize are , respectively , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , for @xmath65 .",
    "this sequence behaves as @xmath66 , where @xmath67 and @xmath68 equals unity within one part in @xmath53 . as regards the extent of the flat region in the thermodynamic limit , the shape of curves in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] suggests that the upper limit @xmath3 be given by extrapolation of the sequence of fixed points of equation  ( [ eq:2 ] ) : @xmath69 .",
    "such sequence is the same given in table 1 of  @xcite , with the additional point @xmath70 . using @xmath71 we get @xmath72 with @xmath2 ( to be compared with @xmath73  @xcite ) , @xmath74 .",
    "thus we have convincing evidence that the system exhibits a critical phase , which extends down from @xmath75 , at least to the lowest temperatures examined , and presumably all the way down to @xmath4 .",
    "= 8.5 cm    in order to check on this latter assumption ,",
    "it is instructive to look at the low - temperature behaviour of the correlation lengths themselves . this is illustrated in curve ( a ) of fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] which shows that , immediately below @xmath3 the functional form @xmath76 ( with @xmath77 , from the results for @xmath78 above ) sets in along the f direction .",
    "this corresponds to the lowest - energy ( @xmath79 ) excitations in that direction , which are obtained by breaking a single ferromagnetic bond , eg @xmath80 ( while , in this example , both neighbouring chains are @xmath81 ) .",
    "see below the contrasting case for the af direction .",
    "in other words , @xmath82 behaviour is dominant all the way down from @xmath3 , consistent with the idea that there is a single ( critical ) phase from @xmath4 upwards to @xmath83 .",
    "examination of data taken with the tm along the af direction , fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ( b ) , is helped because the zero - temperature bulk correlation length in that direction is known exactly  @xcite : @xmath84 we then look at the finite - temperature and finite - size deviations of @xmath85 from equation  ( [ eq:4 ] ) , as displayed in curve ( b ) of fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] .",
    "we have been able to reach roughly the same temperatures ( usually @xmath86 ) as with the tm along the f direction , before running into numerical problems .",
    "the trend shown for @xmath87 in the figure is followed for all strip widths , namely below @xmath88 one has @xmath89 we have found empirically that the @xmath90dependent prefactor is well fitted by a form @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , except for @xmath94 which is off by @xmath95 .",
    "the factor of two in the exponential reflects the single - spin nature of elementary excitations along the af direction , as the least costly move in this case consists in overturning a spin ( breaking both its ferromagnetic bonds ) without breaking any of its antiferromagnetic ones .",
    "again , the fact that such low@xmath96 behaviour takes over immediately below @xmath3 indicates that there is a single phase between @xmath4 and @xmath3 .",
    "for bulk @xmath97dimensional systems , hyperscaling implies that close to the transition , the domain - wall free energy @xmath98 vanishes as the correlation length @xmath99 diverges , according to @xmath100  @xcite .",
    "assuming power - law singularities , @xmath101 , one has @xmath102  @xcite .",
    "specializing to @xmath103 and using standard finite - size scaling  @xcite , one can derive the basic fixed - point equation of domain - wall renormalisation group on strips  @xcite : @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the free energy per unit length , in units of @xmath96 , of a seam along the full length of the strip : @xmath106 , with @xmath107 ( @xmath108 ) being the corresponding free energy for a strip with periodic ( twisted ) boundary conditions across .    while , for ising spins , twisted and antiferromagnetic boundary conditions coincide  @xcite , careful consideration  @xcite shows that in potts systems with @xmath109 this does not hold .",
    "indeed , in order to produce a seam along the strip one needs an interaction which _ favours _ pairing between well - defined ( and different ) spin states , _ e.g. _",
    "@xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 .",
    "an antiferromagnetic potts interaction only makes selected pairings energetically _ unfavourable _ , while leaving all other combinations equally probable .",
    "therefore , for potts models with @xmath113 , twisted boundary conditions are obtained by changing the interaction across the @xmath90 direction as follows  @xcite : @xmath114 with the above definitions , one has @xmath115 where @xmath116 , @xmath117 are the largest eigenvalues of the tm , respectively with periodic and twisted boundary conditions across . in the present case ,",
    "different results are to be expected , depending on whether the tm is set along the f or af directions . in figure  [ fig:4 ]",
    "we show @xmath118 against temperature for both cases .",
    "= 8.5 cm    for case ( a ) , the low - temperature behaviour is similar to that found in section  [ sec : smg ] , in that all curves ( i ) very nearly collapse on top of each other , and ( ii ) behave as @xmath119 .",
    "analogously to the ratio of scaled mass gaps @xmath59 used in that section , we define the ratio of scaled free energies : @xmath120/ \\left[\\,l^\\prime\\,\\delta f_{l^\\prime}(t)\\,\\right]\\ , \\qquad { \\rm ( f ) }    \\label{eq:8}\\ ] ] results , using @xmath56 , are displayed in figure  [ fig:5 ] and are very similar to those shown in figure  [ fig:2 ] , except that instead of crossing the @xmath121 axis from below , the curves only get asymptotically close to it , and from above .",
    "this is expected , as inverse correlation length and domain - wall free energy are dual to each other  @xcite .",
    "the values of @xmath122 at which the curves stabilize are , respectively , @xmath123 , @xmath124 , @xmath125 , @xmath126 , @xmath127 , for @xmath65 .",
    "this sequence behaves as @xmath128 , where @xmath129 and @xmath130 equals unity within two parts in @xmath131 .",
    "though the absence of a crossing of the @xmath121 axis deprives one of an obvious reference point , it is possible to infer the limiting extent of the flat region , as @xmath132 , as follows . for each curve one",
    "records at what temperature it reaches within , say , @xmath133 of its own @xmath82 asymptotic value , and the resulting sequence is extrapolated against @xmath134 . by doing",
    "so we get @xmath135 where the error bar , though somewhat subjective , is certainly generous enough to allow for the degree of arbitrariness involved in this procedure .",
    "we conclude that the evidence provided is entirely consistent with that given by the analysis of correlation lengths in the f direction . as a final remark ,",
    "recall that with the tm in the f direction , the seam whose energy is calculated lies parallel to ferromagnetic chains . with @xmath22 , the substitution in equation  ( [ eq:7 ] ) allows for a zero - energy seam at @xmath4 , hence the behaviour depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] ( a ) .",
    "= 8.5 cm    as regards data displayed in figure  [ fig:4 ] ( b ) , one finds well - defined fixed points of equation  ( [ eq:6 ] ) . with @xmath136 ,",
    "these are located respectively at @xmath137 , @xmath138 , @xmath139 , @xmath140 , @xmath141 , for @xmath65 . when plotted against @xmath21",
    ", this sequence displays accentuated downward curvature .",
    "attempts to fit it against @xmath142 produce @xmath143 , with a _ negative _ extrapolated value for @xmath3 .",
    "a two - point fit of @xmath144 and @xmath145 data against @xmath21 gives an estimate @xmath146 .",
    "together with the downward curvature of the full set of data , this indicates that the actual @xmath3 given by this particular domain - wall scaling is _ below _",
    "@xmath147 .",
    "we recall that in the previous case with the tm along the f direction , the corresponding domain walls were found to be critical for all @xmath148 . with the tm along the af direction the seam runs perpendicular to that least energetic orientation of domains , breaking ferromagnetic bonds as it goes .",
    "it would thus appear that , if there is a well - defined temperature for the softening of this latter type of domain walls , it should be finite .",
    "however , we have not managed to produce a reliable estimate for this from our sequence of fixed points .",
    "bearing in mind that the only typical non - zero temperature arising so far in the problem is @xmath149 , one might interpret the data as signalling that the extrapolated critical point for domain walls along the af direction is _ exactly _ @xmath4 .",
    "this brings new problems , as consideration of the physical domain - wall free energy _ per site _",
    ", @xmath150 shows that it behaves as @xmath151 for @xmath82 , with @xmath152 . in other words , at low temperatures it becomes extremely expensive to excite a domain wall along this direction . while this behaviour is , in a loose sense , dual to that of the correlation length along the af direction , which remains finite at @xmath4 as given by equation  ( [ eq:4 ] ) , it is hard to reconcile with the idea that the respective domain walls would go soft at @xmath4 . at present",
    "we are not able to offer a consistent interpretation for the behaviour just exhibited .",
    "next we attempt a characterization of the transition from the paramagnetic to the critical phase .",
    "it is usually assumed that , as this point is approached from above in a kosterlitz - thouless transition , the bulk correlation length behaves as  @xcite : @xmath153\\ , \\label{eq:9}\\ ] ] with @xmath154 , and @xmath155 , @xmath156 and @xmath3 are non - universal . from finite - size scaling  @xcite , the correlation length on a strip",
    "is expected to scale as : @xmath157\\right)\\ .",
    "\\label{eq:10}\\ ] ] we have taken our data for correlation lengths calculated with the tm along the f direction , displayed in fig .  [ fig:1 ] ( a ) as @xmath158 , and attempted to fit them to the form given by equation  ( [ eq:10 ] ) .",
    "we used the procedure described in  @xcite , to try and collapse our results for assorted values of @xmath0 and @xmath96 onto a single curve .",
    "we took as basic sets of data the six sequences taken each for fixed @xmath159 against varying temperature , from @xmath160 to @xmath161 . according to  @xcite , we then took each of these sets in turn as a baseline , against which to fit the five other sets . since equation  ( [ eq:10 ] ) is valid only above @xmath3 , the actual number of data used would vary , for each trial fit , depending on the particular value taken for the critical temperature . with @xmath3 in the range @xmath162 , as explained below , the number of points fitted was between @xmath163 ( @xmath164 ) and @xmath165 ( @xmath166 ) .",
    "for the local fitting procedure  @xcite , we used cubic polynomials .",
    "we started by keeping @xmath154 fixed , and varying @xmath156 and @xmath3 . from sections  [ sec : smg ] and",
    "[ sec : dws ] @xmath167 would seem a reasonable initial guess . inspired in work done on the @xmath9 model  @xcite ,",
    "@xmath156 was initially assumed of order unity .",
    "the landscape we found in parameter space , for the sum of residuals  @xcite as a function of @xmath156 and @xmath3 , was similar to that described in  @xcite , with `` a number of local minima ... at which ... minimization programs can get stuck '' .",
    "furthermore , visual inspection of plots produced with the parameters set at the minimizing values gave consistently poor fits in all cases for which @xmath3 was below @xmath168 .",
    "we did , however , manage to find an overall minimum for @xmath169 , @xmath170 ( with none for @xmath171 ) .",
    "we then allowed @xmath172 to vary .",
    "the overall picture was entirely similar to that just described for fixed @xmath154 .",
    "the only solution which gave a visually confirmed good fit was @xmath8 , @xmath173 , @xmath174 .",
    "the corresponding results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] .",
    "= 8.5 cm    the value @xmath166 is inconsistent with the evidence exhibited in sections  [ sec : smg ] and  [ sec : dws ] .",
    "one possible solution to this contradiction would be if the critical region , where the behaviour of equation  ( [ eq:10 ] ) is valid , were actually very narrow . thus , we would be distorting the picture , by using high - temperature data which in fact are outside the critical region . for the @xmath9 model in two dimensions ,",
    "it has been argued that this is indeed the case  @xcite , with the width of the critical region estimated as @xmath175  @xcite . with @xmath176 ,",
    "in the present case this would mean a temperature interval @xmath177 .",
    "for the fitting shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] we used data for @xmath96 as high as @xmath178 , for the narrowest strips .",
    "we noticed that , if only a subset of data with @xmath179 is used , the best fit is found for @xmath180 , and is of similar quality to that of fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] .",
    "thus a plausible scenario is one in which , as only data for an ever narrowing interval above @xmath3 are considered , the corresponding fits give rise to lower and lower estimates of @xmath3 itself .",
    "should the prediction of  @xcite hold true in the present case , one would have a problem in that the accuracy to which @xmath3 is known so far ( taking , say , our best estimate @xmath181 of section  [ sec : smg ] ) is lower than the width @xmath182 of the critical region .",
    "we have provided strong numerical evidence that a critical ( kosterlitz - thouless ) phase is present in the three - state mixed potts magnet described by equation  ( [ eq:1 ] ) .",
    "our argument relies on the analysis of the quantities @xmath78 and @xmath183 , defined respectively in equations  ( [ eq:3 ] ) and  ( [ eq:8 ] ) .",
    "based on data exhibited in figures  [ fig:2 ] and  [ fig:5 ] and their respective extrapolation , we conclude that the upper limit of the critical phase , above which the system behaves paramagnetically , is @xmath2 ( from figure  [ fig:2 ] ; treatment of data in figure  [ fig:5 ] produces the less accurate , but not inconsistent , estimate @xmath135 ) .",
    "analysis of the ( extremely anisotropic ) nature of excitations below @xmath3 , as depicted in figure  [ fig:3 ] , gives credence to the idea that the critical phase extends all the way down to @xmath4 , similarly to what happens in the two - dimensional @xmath9 model .",
    "we have found that , while domain walls parallel to the ferromagnetic direction are soft for the whole extent of the critical phase , those along the antiferromagnetic direction seem to undergo a softening transition at a well - defined , finite temperature .",

    "attempts to fit our data for @xmath184 to the finite - size scaling form of equation  ( [ eq:10 ] ) have met with qualified success . while we have been able to produce rather good collapse plots , as depicted in figure  [ fig:6 ] ,",
    "this has been done at the price of setting @xmath8 which is clearly inconsistent with our own earlier estimates .",
    "we have proposed a scenario in which such result is interpreted as a distortion due to the narrowness of the critical region , similarly to the case of the @xmath9 model  @xcite .",
    "this is qualitatively borne out by the fact that fits with only a subset of data , taken at not too high temperatures , indeed result in a lower estimate for @xmath3 .",
