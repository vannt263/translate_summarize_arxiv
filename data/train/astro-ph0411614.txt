    "the solar coronal abundance anomaly commonly known as the `` fip effect '' ( or first ionization potential effect ) , in which low first ionization potential ( fip ) elements ( @xmath210ev ; e.g. si , fe , mg ) appear enhanced by average factors of 3 - 4 , was already well established by the time the first observational clues to similar abundance anomalies in stellar coronae were uncovered in the 1990 s ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "these clues came from low resolution soft x - ray spectra ( _ ginga , asca , bepposax _ ) , together with moderate resolution extreme ultraviolet ( euv ) spectra obtained by the extreme ultraviolet explorer ( euve ) .",
    "the early stellar studies found evidence for a solar - like fip effect in some stars , but for the more active stars the abundances pointed toward metal - paucity rather than enhancement ( e.g. * ? ? ? * and earlier references therein ) .    in the last three years  the beginning of the _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton_era has seen the early hints of abundance anomalies fleshed out into an interesting array of diverse abundance patterns in which active stars appear to show signs not only of low fip element depletion , but also of high fip element enhancements @xcite .",
    "studies of solar - like active stars confirm the suspicions engendered by earlier work ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* and earlier references therein ) that a transition from a metal - depleted to a metal - rich corona occurs as the activity decreases @xcite ; this is now better characterised as a change from an apparently `` inverse fip effect '' to a fip effect .",
    "@xcite showed a similar transitions from an inverse fip effect to the absence of an obvious fip effect for rs cvn binary stars with decreasing activity .",
    "only one star studied in detail to date based on high resolution spectra appears to have a coronal composition demonstrably similar to that of its underlying photosphere  the subgiant procyon ( f5iv ) @xcite .",
    "in the last decade , the community working on coronal abundances have argued ( e.g. * ? ? ? * and earlier references therein ) that coronal abundances , when better understood , might provide new and powerful diagnostics of the physical processes underpinning stellar coronae .",
    "the emerging patterns of coronal abundance anomalies are telling us something about the dynamics structure and heating of coronal plasma ; the challenge is in learning to read these patterns .    aiming toward this goal , one question that arises",
    "is that of fine tuning of abundance patterns : how similar are abundance anomalies in stars that superficially might have similar parameters ?",
    "@xcite presented a differential analysis of the active binaries algol and hr1099two binary systems whose coronally - dominant components are of very similar spectral type and rotation period , but which have had quite different evolutionary histories  and found strong similarities in their quiescent x - ray spectra and coronal abundances .    here",

    "the apparent difference between the coronal abundances of the two stars might be hinting that their coronae are indeed fundamentally different .",
    "such a dissimilarity might reflect the entirely different angular momentum evolution of the two stars : the rapid rotation of ab  dor is due to its relative youth , while that of v471 tau is due to tidal spin - up from interaction with its close companion .    in this paper , using _",

    "[ f : lc ] ( bottom panel ) , no obvious modulation of the coronal emission with orbital phase was seen on either star , though in the case of ab  dor , the observation only covers slightly more than one rotational period . in the case of v471  tau ,",
    "modulation due to modification of the underlying chromospheric structure might be expected , for example , if the part of the k dwarf corona irradiated by the white dwarf were affected by the uv radiation field of the latter .",

    "a similar conclusion has also been reached by @xcite .",
    "we conclude that both ab  dor and v471  tau observations are representative of the stars during times of quiescence , and therefore treat the observations in their entirety for the remainder of the analysis .",
    "spectral line fluxes for both ab dor and v471 tau were measured by fitting modified lorentzian ( `` @xmath13-profile '' ) functions of the form @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the amplitude and @xmath16 a characteristic line width . for a value of @xmath17 , it has been found that this function represents the _ chandra _ transmission grating instrumental profile to within photon counting statistics for lines with a few 1000 counts or less @xcite .",
    "spectra line fitting was undertaken using the fitlines utility in the pintofale spectral analysis package @xcite . in the case of obvious blends , as in the - 13    region ,",
    "we have performed multi - component fitting .",
    "while strong lines can be easily identified , the sum of weak lines , each of which can be undetectable , can produce a `` pseudo - continuum '' .",
    "the true continuum level was set using the spectral regions 2.4 - 3.4 , 5.3 - 6.3 and 19.0 - 20.0   , which we judged to be essentially `` line - free '' , based on both visual inspection and the examination of radiative loss models .",
    "these continuum points were then used to normalize model continua computed using a test differential emission measure taken from an analysis of a typical active star ( au  mic in this case , @xcite ) . in principle , the fluxes should be re - measured once the final dem has been determined ; in practise , there was little difference in the _ shapes _ of trial and final continuum models so that this additional iterative step was not required .",
    "the emission measure distribution and abundance analysis employed the chianti database @xcite and the ionization balance of @xcite , as implemented in the pintofale software package @xcite .",

    "we have computed correction factors ( cf ) for line blends by computing complimentary error functions for each contaminant ( i.e. gaussian profiles are assumed ) .",

    "the procedure identifies which lines are possible contaminants for each analysed line .",
    "the contaminants must lie within two sigma on either side of the line and be greater than a user - defined threshold .",
    "the cf are defined as follows : @xmath18 where i(@xmath19 ) = intensity of the line being contaminated by lines @xmath20 .",
    "cf for line blends for the studied lines range from 0.89 to 0.99 .",
    "[ f : flx ] shows the comparison of our observed and blend corrected fluxes for both ab dor and v471 tau .",
    "note that the fluxes are corrected for distance and exposure time .",
    "we adopted the following formalism for the differential emission measure .",
    "the line flux , for optically - thin plasma , for the transition of an ion between levels @xmath21 can be written as : @xmath22 where a is the abundance , @xmath23 is a known constant which includes the frequency of the transition and the stellar distance , n@xmath24 is the electron density , g@xmath25 is the contribution function and t is the electron temperature .",
    "the kernel @xmath26 is commonly known as the _ differential emission measure _ ( dem ) and is a measure of the amount of emitting power ",
    "correlated with the amount of emitting material  as a function of temperature in the coronal plasma .",
    "it is formally defined as : @xmath27 two different approaches are commonly employed in the derivation of the dem in the corona , namely , line - based methods and global fitting techniques . for the latter",
    "the parameters are determined by a @xmath28 minimization of the observed and trial model spectra .",
    "we prefer the former method for the greater control over the spectroscopic diagnostics entering the analysis that it allows .",
    "a given line flux depends on both temperature and on the abundance of the element in question .",
    "for this reason , methods wishing to take advantage of bright lines from a number of different elements generally have to perform simultaneous modelling of the dem and of abundances ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , the ratio of two emission lines from ions of the _ same _ element is independent of the abundance of the chosen element .",
    "we have therefore devised a method that uses line _",
    "ratios _ instead of line fluxes directly .",
    "a similar method was developed independently by @xcite who also discuss the benefits of such an approach .",
    "our basic set of diagnostics comprises the h - like / he - like resonance line flux ratios for the elements o , ne , mg , and si , line ratios involving fe  xvii , fe xviii and fe  xxi resonance lines , and measurements of the continuum flux at points in the spectrum that are essentially free of lines ( the same regions noted above with regard to spectral line intensity measurement ) .",
    "our method is described in more detail by @xcite .",
    "the motivation underlying the development of this method lies in a desire to survey coronal abundances and trends in temperature structure independent from issues regarding atomic data .",
    "@xcite have demonstrated that a reconstructed dem can be quite sensitive to the lines used for the reconstruction , and also on the atomic data adopted for those lines .",
    "our basic line set comprises the brightest lines in stellar coronal spectra and are easily measured in essentially all well - exposed _",
    "_ grating observations of stellar coronae , such that star - to - star variations in diagnostic lines used can be avoided . the h - like and he - like ions are also likely to be represented by more accurate theoretical line intensities than lines from more complex ions .",
    "similarly , the theoretical description of free - free and bound - free continua used in our dem analysis is thought to be well - understood .",
    "in particular , we note that the continua in these hot coronal sources tend to be dominated by free - free emission .      in order to obtain the _ differential emission measure _ , @xmath26 , we have performed markov - chain monte - carlo analysis using a metropolis algorithm ( mcmc[m ] ) on the set of supplied line flux ratios @xcite .",
    "advantages of this method include the ability to estimate uncertainties on the derived function @xmath26 , and the avoidance of unnecessary smoothing constraints .",
    "[ e : dem ] defines the dem as a continuous function of temperature @xmath29 .",
    "the mcmc[m ] method yields the emission measure distribution over a pre - selected temperature grid , where the dem is described by a simple histogram . in our case , a set of temperatures @xmath30 , with @xmath31$]=0.1 and ranging from @xmath32=6.1 to @xmath33$]=8.0 , define the @xmath34 .",
    "the derived @xmath34 is only reliable over a certain temperature range if we have enough lines with contribution function g(@xmath35)@xmath8 g(@xmath36 ) .",
    "the inversion problem is ill - conditioned which can not be overcome by any fit procedure criteria applied @xcite . nevertheless , in order to `` avoid '' the problem of mathematical ill - conditioning , dem reconstruction techniques often rely on modeling the dem as smooth splines or polynomials , and are thus artificially constrained to be smooth .",
    "we do not impose arbitrary smoothing restrictions , but instead let the algorithm find the best possible model allowed by the data ( e.g. ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while applying a variable _ local _ smoothing to the dem .",
    "this local smoothing is based on the diagnostic information available : if there are many spectral lines in a given temperature range with different temperature sensitivities , smoothing is essentially switched off ; instead , more smoothing is applied where diagnostic information is more sparse .",
    "this technique often allows solutions containing structure over small temperature ranges , whose formal significance may be judged by the sizes of the error bars that the algorithm also produces . while the reality of strongly peaked features in stellar dems is still in question ,",
    "other techniques have found evidence for sharply peaked structures in some coronae , as illustrated , for example , by the emission measure derived for capella using euve data @xcite and for the sun using yohkoh data @xcite .",
    "although we have found a `` good '' solution for the dems , by using the local smoothing criteria , one has to keep in mind that we can not a priori exclude other solutions in the parameter space that describe the spectra equally well .",

    "set 3 contains h - like and he - like lines that constrain the structure of the dem in the upper and lower temperature range , while the iron ions give information about the structure of the dem in the intermediate temperature range .",

    "one product of our mcmc[m ] method is the statistical uncertainties in @xmath26 evaluated at the 68% confidence level .",
    "one has to bear in mind that the error bars for consecutive bins in dems are not independent , owing to the inevitable cross - talk that arises as a result of the line contribution functions themselves stretching over several bins . while the dem method imposes a degree of local smoothing , dictated by the number of diagnostic lines with significant emission in each temperature bin ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for details ) , this smoothing is not always sufficient to attenuate `` high frequency oscillations '' in the solution  the artifact whereby overly high values of the dem in a given temperature bin can be compensated for by a commensurately lower value in adjacent bins .",
    "our final dems are corrected for the distances of the stars : we have adopted @xmath38=14.9pc @xcite and @xmath38=48pc @xcite for ab dor and v471 tau respectively .",
    "once the dem , @xmath26 , has been established , we can evaluate the abundances of any elements for which we have lines with measured fluxes .",
    "the abundance is then a simple scaling factor in the integral equation [ e : flux ] , and is given by the value this factor has to assume in order to match the measured flux . in this way",
    ", we derived values for the coronal abundances of the elements o , ne , mg , si , s and fe , though only upper limits were obtained for the abundances of s for v471 tau owing to the lack of signal in both he - like and h - like features .",
    "according to previous works the photospheric abundances for ab dor and v471 tau are similar to the solar ones ( see  [ s : abdor ] and  [ s : v471tau ] ) .",
    "therefore , we will use the @xcite solar photospheric composition but will refer to it as stellar photospheric values .",
    "note that we have used the new solar photospheric oxygen abundance , o / h = 8.69 , derived by @xcite .",
    "we also used the temperature - insensitive abundance ratio diagnostics of @xcite as an additional check on our values obtained using the dem .",
    "these are ratios of formed by combining two sets of lines of two different elements , constructed such that the combined emissivity curves of each set have essentially the same temperature dependence .",
    "the resulting ratio of measured line fluxes then yields directly the ratio of the abundances of the relevant elements , independent from the atmospheric temperature structure . a similar , though less sophisticated",

    "the dems obtained by using the line sets with no iron ions ( sets 1 and 2 ) , show sharper increase and decrease for the lower and higher temperatures compared with ones obtained by including iron lines ( sets 3 and 4 ) , which show more prominently defined peaks . of these , it is interesting that the dems for both ab dor and v471 tau corresponding to line set 4 , containing all the ions , require the most structure .",
    "the dems for both stars show little evidence for substantial amount of plasma at temperatures higher than @xmath32[k]=7.4 .",
    "nevertheless , the corona of ab  dor seems to be , based on the dems , slightly more active than that of v471  tau .",
    "the slopes in the derived dems to the low temperature side of their maxima follow very approximately the relation em@xmath49t@xmath50 , which is steeper than the em@xmath49t@xmath51 suggested for coronal loops with constant cross - section and uniform heating ( e.g. ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if the sharp peaks observed in the dems are real , it would imply that the corona must contain essentially isothermal structures ( see also * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "our results for ab dor are comparable with those reported recently by @xcite based on xmm-_newton _ and _ chandra _ observations .",
    "they obtained a three - peak dem with a more smooth increase for the lower temperatures , @xmath32[k]@xmath46.6 , and sharp decrease for the higher temperatures , @xmath32[k]@xmath97.4 .",
    "the @xcite line - based dem also shows a maximum at @xmath32[k]@xmath87.0@xmath30.1 . to our knowledge , there exist no other dem analysis of v471 tau by other authors with which to compare our temperature structure results .",
    "how reliable are the structural features observed in the dems ?",
    "@xcite demonstrated that solar quiet and active region dems are _ not stable _ to changes in the lines used in the analysis .",
    "this occurs because of a breakdown in the assumptions of optically thin plasma analysis , or ( or in addition to ) because of uncertainties in the underlying atomic data that are not included in the analysis .",
    "we note in passing that measurements of the and ly@xmath5/ly@xmath13 ratios for ab dor are in perfect agreement with the optically thin theoretical values ( testa et al .",
    ", in preparation ) , so that we do not expect photon loss through , e.g. , resonance scattering to be important .",
    "the principal lines used in our analysis are simple h - like and he - like transitions for which atomic data should be reliable .",
    "the exceptions in line sets 3 and 4 are the fe ions . @xcite and @xcite reported new fe l - shell calculations indicating that rate coefficients for all n@xmath522 ( 3@xmath4n@xmath45 ) transitions may differ from earlier calculations up to 50% .",
    "moreover , these authors emphasised the importance of including in the level populations the indirect processes of radiative recombination , dielectronic recombination , and resonance excitation involving neighbouring charge states .",
    "it seems likely that problems associated either with the fe line emissivities themselves , or with the underlying ionization balance , might be to blame for the differences in the temperature structure obtained from the different line sets .",
    "regarding the ionization balance , we also note that dielectronic recombination ( dr ) tends to dominate the recombination rates for the fe ions near their temperatures of peak population . in contrast",
    ", for h - like ions , dr is not an issue and one seems justified in having more faith in the populations of these ions .",
    "the case of he - like ions has been discussed recently by @xcite based on the example of o  vii . unlike the excitation of the ( 1s.2p ) 3s@xmath53 and ( 1s.2p ) p@xmath54 levels that form the upper levels of the prominent forbidden and intercombination lines , respectively , and which tend to be dominated by dielectronic recombination and cascades , the ( 1s.2p ) 1p@xmath53 upper level of the resonance line is excited almost entirely by collisions .",
    "thus , the he - like resonance lines should also be quite accurately represented in recent theoretical models and should provide reliable diagnostics .    as we noted earlier in ",
    "[ s : results ] , a small fraction of our predicted line fluxes based on final dems and abundances differ to those observed by @xmath55  %  or slightly more ( fig  [ f : obs_pre ] ) .",
    "conspicuous among these are the o  vii lines in ab  dor .",
    "this small discrepancy is likely due to the lack of strong temperature constraints for the cooler temperatures  a similar , though smaller , effect is discernible at the high temperature end from s  xvi .",
    "one other conspicuous point in fig  [ f : obs_pre ] belongs to ne  ix in ab  dor for line set 4 that includes fe lines in addition to the h - like and he - like ions . since this ne  ix predicted flux is the only discrepant point among the three line lists in which it appears ,",
    "we conclude that there is no dem solution that can accommodate both the fe and other lines simultaneously to within their statistical uncertainties .",
    "in essence , the fe  xvii and fe  xviii lines , that are formed at temperatures similar to those of ne  ix and ne  x , are pulling the dem to a solution that is unfavourable to the ne ix line .",
    "we have argued above that atomic data uncertainties are a likely culprit for this situation .",
    "however , another possibility is that the coronal abundances are non - uniform as a function of temperature .",
    "this would also be seen in the differences between dems derived by using set 1 and set 2 , in which we use mg and ne ratios for the low temperature range , and set 3 in which we swapped those ratios with fe ones .",
    "the latter results in a much lower dem at @xmath56 , near where fe  xvii ions reach maximum population . to retain a similar dem to those obtained from line sets 1 and 2 at this temperature",
    "would require an _ increase _ in the fe abundance at this temperature relative to the value at higher temperatures .",
    "equally , similar agreement of the dem s from line sets 1 , 2 and 3 might be achieved by a _ decrease _ in the ne abundance toward higher temperatures .",
    "these arguments are qualitative and we have insufficient spectroscopic diagnostic information to investigate abundance variations with temperature in a rigorous fashion .",
    "we note , however , that such abundance variations might not be unreasonable in the light of a recent survey of coronal densities by @xcite that clearly demonstrates that the cooler @xmath57  k corona resides in quite different structures to the hotter , @xmath58  k plasma that appears to be universally characterised by much higher pressures .",
    "@xcite found that for the solar corona the fip effect is larger for @xmath59  k than at @xmath60  k.    regardless of the true cause of the differences between the dems obtained from different line sets , we can conclude that _ small - scale structure obtained in coronal dems is not reliable _ : such structure sensitive to the particular diagnostics chosen and does not necessarily reflect the true underlying temperature structure .",
    "this conclusion echoes the statements made earlier by @xcite .",
    "the dems of v471  tau are more similar among the different line sets than those of ab  dor . however , despite of their quite different evolutionary histories , we conclude that their coronae show a strong similarity in temperature structure .",
    "our results for the element abundances of ab dor and v471 tau are summarized in table  [ t : abund1 ] .",
    "we only list statistical uncertainties here .",
    "there are of course other uncertainties in the atomic data used for the analysis , and in the calibration of the _ chandra _ instruments .",
    "atomic data uncertainties are probably of order 30%  for fe lines ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but are probably slightly less than this for h - like and he - like lines .",
    "the final uncertainties in our derived abundances are difficult to assess rigorously , but are likely of order 0.1  dex .",
    "the abundances derived are quite consistent for the different line sets considered : the abundances for each element agree even within the statistical errors except for oxygen in set 3 of ab  dor .",
    "we also notice that the abundances for oxygen and iron for both ab dor and v471 tau derived from set 3 are slightly higher than those derived from the other sets , an effect due to differences in the temperature structures obtained ( see  [ s : structure ] ) .",
    "table  [ t : abund2 ] shows the abundance ratio , from he - like and h - like ions of light elements , that are relatively insensitive to temperature ( see  [ s : ele_abun ] ) .",
    "those values are in agreement with the ones derived from the dems ( table  [ t : abund1 ] ) , with the exception of the ratios containing iron .",
    "atomic physics uncertainties in the iron ions might affect the values obtained for the ratios [ ne / fe ] and [ mg / fe ] .    in fig .",
    "[ f : abund ] we have plotted the derived abundances , relative to the stellar photospheric values , in order of the element fip .",
    "ab  dor and v471  tau clearly share similarities in coronal composition : both show the same general pattern characterised by a depletion of low fip elements by a factor of @xmath0 , evidence for slightly smaller depletions of intermediate fip elements s and o , and a clear enhancement of ne relative to elements of lower fip .",
    "this pattern is similar to , though less extreme than , those seen in other active stars and rs  cvn - type binaries(see , e.g. , reviews by * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . that the abundances found here represent real metal depletions in the coronae of both ab  dor and v471  tau is beyond doubt . as discussed in ",
    "[ s : stars ] , both stars have solar - like , or slightly super - solar , metal abundances and this is irreconcilable with the much lower coronal abundances of low fip elements .    in table",
    "[ t : abund_liter ] we list the abundance results from earlier studies of ab  dor and v471  tau @xcite , together with our own .",
    "the values from @xcite are from the rgs results .",
    "note that the values for s and si are few times smaller than those obtained with epic from the same observations .",
    "the s value obtained with epic is comparable with our values and previous works on ab dor .",
    "the results obtained from the literature are all compared in fig .",
    "[ f : abund_liter ] .",
    "it is important to remember that different authors adopt different values for `` solar '' photospheric abundances : for both the table and figure we have scaled the various abundance results to the photospheric scale adopted here , based on the solar mixture of @xcite , which is similar to the stellar photospheric values derived for a few elements of the stars .",
    "note that we have used the new solar photospheric oxygen abundance , o / h = 8.69 , derived by @xcite .",
    "while there is good agreement in the general trend of abundances as a function of fip , there are clearly some significant differences between the different studies .",
    "the large spread in results from the different studies appear to be a result of modelling uncertainties and possibly to improvements of the atomic database .",
    "this conclusion is reinforced by the much more favourable comparison of the results of the recent _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ studies of ab  dor  this work compared with that of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite have recently reported , for v824 ara , ar lac and ab dor respectively , higher values for abundances of al , ca , and na than for elements with slightly higher fip suggesting a schism in the strictly inverse fip effect scheme .",
    "in particular , @xcite obtained different values of ca abundance for ab  dor , including a very high value of [ ca / h]=0.62 derived from the high resolution rgs spectrum .",
    "indeed , figure  12 of @xcite suggests that the inverse fip effect in ab  dor undergoes a palpable reversal toward the lowest fip elements .",
    "a similar effect was suggested by @xcite based on high resolution _",
    "spectra of ar  lac . that there might be a difference in abundance behaviour among the low fip elements",
    "has already been suggested on the basis of solar measurements , in which the lowest fip elements , such as na and al , appear to be enhanced relative to elements such as si and mg @xcite .",
    "although we have not been able to obtain definitive measurements of lines of na , al and ca in our spectra of ab  dor ( none were detected with any degree of significance ) , we have estimated approximate upper limits to the abundances of these elements through comparison of observed and synthetic spectra .",
    "fig  [ f : low_fip_synt ] illustrates the observed ab  dor meg spectrum and two synthetic spectra : one computed using the abundance derived for ca by @xcite and the other one assuming al , ca and na have coronal abundances similar to mg .",
    "the former produce extremely strong , and lines which are clearly not seen in the observed spectrum . the synthetic spectrum computed assuming relative coronal abundances equal to mg for al , ca and na instead provide good approximations to the observed spectrum .",
    "we conclude that the coronal abundances of al , ca and na in ab  dor are similar to , or lower than , those of the other low fip elements mg , si and fe .",
    "the coronal abundances we have derived for v471 tau are a factor of two or less lower ( factor three for ne ) than those reported by @xcite",
    ". this might be due to artifacts of the analysis of the low resolution asca pulse height spectra , though other explanations are possible .",
    "there were three modest flare events during the asca observation that were not filtered from the analysis of @xcite .",
    "it appears likely that in some flares on active stars the abundances of low fip elements are enhanced toward their pristine photospheric values , a result tentatively interpreted as chromospheric evaporation ( e.g. reviews of * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "flares , then , might temporarily raise the abundances of the dominant plasma at a given time , though the asca flares were rather small for this to present an immediately convincing explanation .",
    "alternatively , it is possible that the abundance patterns simply vary with time , according to the characteristics of dominant and relatively quiescent active regions , and at the time of the earlier asca observation the abundances were simply higher .",
    "circumstantial evidence against such an explanation can be found in the abundance analysis of the active rs  cvn - type binary hr  1099 , for which independent analyses of _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _",
    "observations obtained at different times yielded very similar values for quiescent coronal abundances @xcite .",
    "moreover , @xcite has found similar abundances in the coronae of hr  1099 and its `` coronal twin '' the active late - type component of the algol binary .",
    "that our results for ab  dor and v471  tau  coronal twins in many respects  are so similar reinforces the conclusion that coronal abundances are dependent largely on stellar parameters and do not vary substantially during times of relative coronal quiescence .",
    "it also points out that tidal interactions , which may have an influence on differential rotation and possibly on dynamo action , are not important for determinnig coronal structure ( the magnetic interactions between the white dwarf and the k star components of v471  tau does not seem to play an important role at least in the x - ray domain ) .",
    "however , despite the very similar coronal temperature structure and abundance patterns , the l@xmath61 of v471 tau is about twice higher than that for ab dor ( see table  [ t : par ] ) .",
    "this difference in brightness might be within the stochastic variation range for active stars , but might also be hinting that tidal interaction could be contributing to the stellar coronae somehow .",
    "ab  dor and v471  tau represent a rare pair stars that have the same rotational period ( p@xmath62 ) and spectral type but quite different evolutionary histories and ages(@xmath870myr vs @xmath8600myr ) . as such",
    ", a comparison between their coronal properties could provide an illuminating glimpse of any fundamental underlying differences in their magnetic dynamos and activity . based on an analysis of high resolution _",
    "chandra _ x - ray spectra of these stars we draw the following conclusions .    1 .   both the coronal temperature structure and element abundances are remarkably similar .",
    "element abundances are characterized by an inverse - fip type effect in which the abundances of high fip elements are enhanced relative to those of low fip elements .",
    "both coronae are depleted in low fip elements relative to their photospheres by a factor of @xmath0 .",
    "the observed abundance anomalies are less extreme than those typically seen in very active stars , despite ab dor and v471 tau lying at the boundary between coronal saturation and supersaturation regimes @xcite .",
    "3 .   there is no evidence for any difference in the abundances of the very low fip ( @xmath63 - 6  ev ) elements na , al and ca as compared to the low fip ( @xmath64 - 8  ev ) elements si , mg and fe , as some earlier work has suggested .",
    "abundances derived using our method in which the dem is obtained from a combination of the ratios of a few well - selected prominent spectral lines and continuum measurements are robust and independent of both the exact set of lines used to define the dem and of the details of its temperature structure .",
    "small - scale structure is found in the dems obtained based on different sets of spectral lines .",
    "such structural details are most likely spurious artifacts arising from either errors in assumed ion populations or spectral line excitation rates , or non - uniform abundances in different coronal structures that contribute significantly to the observed x - ray emission .",
    "_ coronal dems are strongly dependent on the input data used to derive them _ , as was emphasised earlier in the solar study of @xcite .",
    "6 .   based on the very similar coronal characteristics of ab  dor and v471  tau we conclude that there is no observable difference between the coronal activity of youth and high primordial angular momentum and that of tidal spin - up of an older star . in other words , the exact evolutionary state has little effect on the corona , and the parameters that dominate coronal structure and composition are rotation rate and spectral type .",
    "the latter determines of course the parameters of the convection zone , where the magnetic fields sustaining coronal activity are believed to originate , while rotation rate appears to be the dominant parameter in the amplification of these magnetic fields .",
    "we also note that despite the binarity of v471 tau it does not show any significant difference in thermal structure and composition with respect to ab  dor .",
    "this would mean that tidal interactions , which may have an influence on differential rotation and possibly on dynamo action , are not important for determining coronal structure .",
    "the magnetic interactions between the white dwarf and the k star components of v471  tau does not seem to play an important role at least in the x - ray domain .",
    "the latter conclusion was previously suggested in an analysis based on radio observations @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the observed difference in brightness between ab dor and v471 tau ( twice higher ) might be hinting that tidal interaction could be contributing to the stellar coronae somehow .",
