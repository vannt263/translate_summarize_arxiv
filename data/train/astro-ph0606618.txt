    "the problem of contamination of kinematic samples of galaxies in clusters by foreground and background galaxies has been recognized since such data became available .",
    "it arises because of the fact that only the projected positions and velocities of galaxies are measured in redshift surveys . due to the lack of knowledge about the motion perpendicular to the line of sight it is difficult to judge a priori which of the galaxies found close to the cluster in projected space are actually bound to it and good tracers of the underlying potential . including unbound galaxies , or _ interlopers _",
    ", in the samples used for dynamical modelling may lead to significant bias in the estimated parameters of mass distribution in clusters .",
    "many procedures have been proposed in the literature to deal with this problem .",
    "all these procedures aim at cleaning the galaxy sample from non - members before attempting the proper dynamical analysis of the cluster . in the case of single clusters",
    "such a _ direct _ approach is the only one possible because of small samples . only in the case of kinematic samples combined from the data for many clusters one can attempt to take the presence of interlopers into account statistically ( van der marel et al .",
    "2000 ; mahdavi & geller 2004 ) .",
    "the traditional direct approach by yahil & vidal ( 1977 ) relies on calculation of the velocity dispersion of the galaxy sample @xmath0 and iterative removal of outliers with velocities larger than @xmath1 . in rich enough samples one can take into account the dependence of @xmath0 on the projected distance from the cluster centre @xmath2 and",
    "perform the rejection procedure in bins with different @xmath0 or fit a simple solution of the jeans equation to the measured @xmath3 profile and reject galaxies outside the @xmath4 lines ( okas et al .",
    "perea , del olmo & moles ( 1990 ) discussed another method relying on iterative removal of galaxies whose absence in the sample causes the biggest change in the mass estimator .",
    "one can also combine the information on the position and velocity of a galaxy to infer the maximum velocity available to cluster members as proposed by den hartog & katgert ( 1996 ) .",
    "the methods listed above ( or variations of them ) were recently tested in detail by wojtak et al .",
    "( 2006 ) using the results of cosmological @xmath5-body simulations .",
    "working with mock data samples created from the simulated dark matter haloes they verified what fraction of unbound particles is actually removed from the sample .",
    "they found that the methods of den hartog & katgert ( 1996 ) and perea et al .",
    "( 1990 ) are the most efficient .",
    "okas et al .",
    "( 2006a ) have recently modelled the kinematics of six nearby regular galaxy clusters with very few interlopers which could be reliably removed with the simple @xmath4 scheme .",
    "modelling both the velocity dispersion and kurtosis profiles allowed them to estimate not only the mass and concentration parameter of the cluster , but also the anisotropy of galactic orbits . on the opposite end , in terms of",
    "the difficulty in estimating the cluster properties , lies a1689 . as discussed by okas et al .",
    "( 2006b ) the cluster velocity distribution is so complex that no reliable estimates of its mass and concentration can be obtained from the kinematics .    in this paper",
    "we study the kinematics of clusters which could be classified as an intermediate case between the two mentioned above .",
    "we focus on significantly contaminated clusters , for which more sophisticated methods of interloper removal have to be applied , but still reliable estimates of the parameters can be obtained .",
    "we illustrate the performance of these methods in detail using the example of a rich nearby ( @xmath6 ) galaxy cluster abell 576 ( section 2 ) .",
    "the cluster has a regular image in x - rays which suggests that it is in dynamical equilibrium .",
    "however , contrary to similarly regular clusters like those studied by okas et al .",
    "( 2006a ) it is rather strongly contaminated by foreground and background galaxies which are hard to separate from the main body of the cluster .",
    "we show how the inferred parameters of the cluster mass distribution would be biased if no interloper removal scheme was applied .",
    "then we discuss the performance of different interloper removal procedures .",
    "finally we model the velocity dispersion and kurtosis profiles of the cleaned samples to estimate reliably the virial mass , concentration and anisotropy parameter of the cluster .    in order to place the results for a576 in the right context we study the kinematics of 15 more nearby clusters showing different degree of contamination ( section 3 ) .",
    "we demonstrate that after careful removal of interlopers such clusters can be modelled using jeans formalism and present the results of fitting their velocity dispersion and kurtosis profiles in terms of estimated mass , concentration and anisotropy parameter ( section 4 ) .",
    "this allows us to extend the mass - concentration relation obtained from the kinematic data by okas et al .",
    "( 2006a ) to the total of 22 clusters .",
    "the positions and redshifts of galaxies in the vicinity of a576 were obtained from the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) . we have searched the database for galaxies within projected distance of 3 mpc from the cluster centre and with @xmath7 velocities differing from the cluster mean @xmath8 by less than @xmath9 km s@xmath10 .",
    "the redshifts of galaxies thus selected come mainly from mohr et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and rines et al .",
    "the cluster possesses two central galaxies .",
    "we choose one of these galaxies with redshift closer to the cluster mean as the centre of the cluster , with respect to which all distances are measured .",
    "the presence of this central galaxy pair may suggest that the cluster underwent a merger .",
    "this hypothesis is also supported by x - ray data : although the large scale x - ray surface brightness distribution measured by einstein ( mohr et al .",
    "1996 ) and asca satellites ( horner et al . 2000 ) is rather regular , some departures from equilibrium in the cluster core have been detected with chandra ( kempner & david 2004 ; dupke & bregman 2005 ) . however , since the x - ray map is not strongly perturbed and the centre of the gas distribution coincides with the position of the two central galaxies the cluster probably had time to reach equilibrium after the merging event .",
    "the galaxy velocities have been transformed to the reference frame of the cluster and in order to calculate the distances we have transformed the cluster velocities to the reference frame of the cosmic microwave background and assumed the @xmath11cdm cosmological model with parameters @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 . the line - of - sight velocities of 272 galaxies as a function of their projected distance from the cluster centre are plotted in the upper left panel of fig .",

    "we will refer to this kind of plot as a velocity diagram .",

    "real or simulated , the density profile is close to nfw ( navarro , frenk & white 1997 ) while orbits do not depart significantly from isotropic and the line - of - sight velocity dispersion profile @xmath18 should be a decreasing function of @xmath2 ( okas & mamon 2001 ) .",
    "we can try to reproduce this @xmath18 with the solution of the jeans equation ( binney & mamon 1982 ) @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the nfw density profile and @xmath21 its two - dimensional projection , assuming the anisotropy parameter @xmath22 and estimating the virial mass @xmath23 and concentration parameter @xmath24 ( we assume @xmath25 ) .",

    "the solution is plotted as a dashed line in the third panel of the left column of the figure .",
    "the final modelling of galaxy cluster kinematics should take into account possible departures from isotropy of galactic orbits . since the velocity dispersion data alone can not break the degeneracy between the anisotropy and the shape ( concentration ) of the density profile it is useful to consider a higher order velocity moment , the line - of - sight kurtosis @xmath30 ( okas & mamon 2003 ; okas et al .",

    "the reason for the higher mass estimate in the case of fitting both velocity moments is the following : since kurtosis is not strongly overestimated it allows tangential orbits ( see fig .",
    "10 in sanchis , okas & mamon 2004 ) which also fit the dispersion profile better , but for a higher mass .",
    "the method of interloper removal found to work best on simulated data ( see table  1 of wojtak et al .",
    "2006 ) was proposed by den hartog & katgert ( 1996 ) .",
    "this approach was successful in removing on average 73 percent of unbound particles from simulated velocity diagrams obtained with the same initial cut - off in line - of - sight velocity , as applied here to a576 : @xmath9 km s@xmath10 with respect to the cluster mean .",
    "the unbound particles remaining in the sample afterwards were those falling within the cluster main body in the projected phase space .",

    "it turns out ( see wojtak et al .",
    "2006 ) that the method works best if this is done with the mass estimator @xmath62 derived from the virial theorem ( heisler , tremaine & bahcall 1985 ) @xmath63 where @xmath5 is a number of galaxies with @xmath64 , @xmath65 is the velocity of the @xmath66-th galaxy and @xmath67 is a projected distance between @xmath66-th and @xmath68-th galaxy .",
    "the mass profile can be then obtained from @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the sequence of projected radii of galaxies in the increasing order up to @xmath71 mpc in our case . from this mass profile",
    "we calculate the maximum velocity profile ( [ vmax ] ) and remove galaxies with velocities exceeding @xmath38 .",

    "the resulting final sample of galaxies is shown in the upper middle panel of fig .",
    "[ comparison ] as filled circles , while the rejected galaxies were marked as open circles .",
    "the corresponding velocity dispersion profile is plotted in the third middle panel of fig .",

    "[ comparison ] .    allowing for arbitrary constant anisotropy and adding kurtosis to the analysis ( lower middle panel of fig .",
    "[ comparison ] ) we arrive at very similar numbers , in particular the estimated anisotropy parameter is very close to zero ( see table  [ fittedpar ] ) . the best - fitting profiles of velocity moments in this case are shown in the middle column of fig .  [ comparison ] with solid lines .",
    "note that the @xmath57 error bars estimated from joint fitting of both velocity moments , but keeping @xmath33 as a free parameter , are larger than those found from fitting @xmath15 alone assuming @xmath76 .",
    "another method of interloper removal that we find useful in the case of a576 is the one based on the use of mass estimators ( see table  1 of wojtak et al .",

    "originally proposed by perea et al .",

    "( 2006 ) the presence of interlopers causes strong overestimation of both @xmath62 and @xmath78 , but more so in the case of @xmath78 , one can therefore construct a method of interloper removal based on the ratio @xmath41 .",
    "such a method is able to remove on average 65 percent of unbound galaxies from velocity diagrams .",
    "the method uses the jackknife statistics in order to eliminate the interlopers .",
    "the data are arranged in @xmath79 sequence , where @xmath66 goes from 1 to @xmath80 and we calculate @xmath80 values of both mass estimators corresponding to @xmath80 subsequences with one data point excluded .",
    "we identify as an interloper the galaxy for which the corresponding subsequence is the source of the most discrepant value of one of the estimators . in the next step ,",
    "the same procedure is applied to a new data set with @xmath81 particles .",
    "the disadvantage of this procedure is that it does not converge and we have to define some criterion for stopping the algorithm .",
    "since in the case of samples cleaned from interlopers we should have @xmath82 and @xmath83 these would be the most obvious conditions .",
    "unfortunately , in the case of simulated clusters they are never exactly fulfilled and more conservative relations have to be adopted .    however , applying the algorithm to the kinematic sample of a576 we discovered that the condition @xmath82 is actually fulfilled after some interlopers are removed .",
    "the performance of the procedure is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ jackknife ] , where we plot the values of the two estimators ( upper panel ) and their ratio ( lower panel ) as a function of the number of removed galaxies @xmath84 .",
    "we find that at @xmath85 the ratio @xmath41 drops to unity and remains at this level even if more galaxies are rejected .",
    "this moment is a clear signature that the sample has been cleaned of interlopers .",
    "the final sample of galaxies from this method after removal of @xmath85 galaxies is shown in the upper right panel of fig .",
    "[ comparison ] .",
    "the galaxies accepted by the procedure are plotted with filled circles , while those removed with open circles . the corresponding velocity dispersion profile and the constraints on the parameters from the solution of the jeans equation with @xmath76",
    "are also shown in the right column of the figure .",

    "adding kurtosis to the analysis ( lower right panel of fig .  [ comparison ] )",
    "we again arrive at very similar numbers ( see table  [ fittedpar ] ) .",
    "the best - fitting profiles of velocity moments in this case are shown in the right column of fig .",
    "[ comparison ] with solid lines .",
    "the parameters estimated from fitting velocity dispersion and both moments for the samples obtained by the two methods are summarized in table  [ fittedpar ] .",
    "the present final sample differs from the one obtained with the previous method only by one galaxy which is removed here and was retained in the previous case .",
    "this single galaxy is however responsible for the difference between the velocity dispersion and kurtosis profiles in the two cases ( we keep 30 galaxies per bin so the binning of the data is different ) .",
    "the fitted parameters of the nfw mass distribution however remain quite similar .",
    "interestingly , no other method studied by wojtak et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and shown to work reasonably well for simulated clusters , is applicable to a576 .",
    "in particular , the commonly used @xmath1 method originally proposed by yahil & vidal ( 1977 ) does not remove any galaxy from the sample , whether applied to a single bin or in radial bins of different size .",
    "similarly , the method based on fitting the isotropic solution of the jeans equation and rejecting galaxies outside the @xmath88 lines successfully applied to less contaminated clusters by okas et al .",
    "( 2006a ) does not work here ( it removes only one galaxy ) .",
    "the reason is that in the case of a576 we do not have single outliers but rather a uniform background of interlopers .",
    "this makes the dispersion profile for the contaminated sample increase so strongly ( see the left column of fig .",
    "[ comparison ] ) that all galaxies fall within the fitted @xmath89 lines and the procedure does not start .",
    "we studied the performance of a few methods of interloper removal , two of which work especially well : one based on estimating the maximum velocity available for cluster members and the other on the use of the ratio of two mass estimators .",
    "the methods work equally well producing reliable final galaxy samples that lead to similar conclusions about the mass distribution in the cluster . if we were to recommend one of these methods",
    ", we would choose the first since on average it should remove more unbound galaxies and is always convergent .",
    "other methods of selecting the cluster members have been applied to a576 before .",
    "for example , mohr et al . ( 1996 ) used galaxies without emission lines as likely virialized members .",
    "however , the velocity dispersion profile for this sample ( see the upper panel of their fig .",
    "8) is still rather flat at larger distances from the cluster s centre leading to an overestimated mass of @xmath73 m@xmath29 ( while the dispersion of the 20 brightest members of this sample gives a value twice smaller ) .",
    "this shows that selecting early - type galaxies is not sufficient to remove interlopers since some of these galaxies can still come from the cluster s neighbourhood .",
    "rines et al .",
    "( 2000 ) used the caustic method to study the infall patterns around a576 using a similar initial kinematic sample as the one used here .",
    "their selection of members yields a similar sample as we obtain using our two methods of interloper removal .",
    "since we believe the @xmath38 method to be more reliable we adopt its results as final : @xmath90 m@xmath29 and @xmath91 .",
    "our mass estimate is in excellent agreement with the result of rines et al .",
    "( 2000 ) . within our virial radius of 2.5 mpc",
    "they find ( see their fig .",
    "7 ) the projected mass @xmath92 m@xmath29 which for our best - fitting concentration corresponds to @xmath93 m@xmath29 .",
    "we also confirm their finding that the mass determined directly from traditional mass estimator @xmath62 strongly overestimates the true value . as shown in fig .",
    "[ hartog ] the last iteration ( lowest line ) gives at 2.5 mpc @xmath94 m@xmath29 which is 1.6 times higher than our best estimate from velocity moments .",
    "the same is true for the projected mass estimator @xmath95 which at the moment of stopping the interloper removal procedure is equal to @xmath62 ( see fig .",
    "[ jackknife ] ) . in agreement with biviano et al .",
    "( 2006 ) we therefore find that these mass estimators overestimate the cluster mass even if the interlopers are properly removed .",
    "comparison with mass estimates derived from the condition of hydrostatic equilibrium of the x - ray emitting gas is more complicated because of a large number of parameters involved in such analyses . using the result for @xmath96 from mohr et al .",
    "( 1996 , their equation 5.3 ) with @xmath97 kev ( kempner & david 2004 ) and @xmath98 mpc we get @xmath99 m@xmath29 , which is consistent with our mass .",
    "( restricting the analysis to @xmath100 mpc to avoid the extrapolation of x - ray data we get @xmath101 m@xmath29 while our best estimate of mass within this radius is @xmath102 m@xmath29 . )",
    "however , more detailed modelling of the x - ray data by rines et al .",
    "( 2000 ) showed that the mass profile inferred from the properties of x - ray gas is systematically lower than the one derived from galaxy kinematics , as is the case for many clusters .",
    "recently , benatov et al .",
    "( 2006 ) proposed that this discrepancy can be reduced if the galaxy orbits are radially anisotropic .",
    "indeed , fixing @xmath33 at the upper limit of the @xmath57 confidence regions listed in the last two lines of table  [ fittedpar ] we find that the best - fitting @xmath23 and @xmath24 are pushed towards the lower limits of the ranges given in the table .",
    "we therefore confirm that significantly lower mass estimates are preferred for radial orbits .",
    "we have shown that for strongly contaminated kinematic samples , as in the case of a576 , the proper removal of interlopers is essential to avoid bias in the estimated parameters of the mass distribution .",
    "one may ask to what extent a576 is special and whether we should worry about such cases or perhaps just discard them from our cluster samples .",
    "as discussed in okas et al .",
    "( 2006a ) there are now few tens nearby ( @xmath103 ) clusters with significant number of galaxy redshifts available from ned .",
    "about half of these clusters have irregular x - ray images so are far from equilibrium and therefore are not tractable by jeans modelling .",
    "in addition , some of the clusters , is spite of regular x - ray images , have close neighbours or strong substructure which makes the analysis difficult .",
    "a576 is a special case among these clusters in a sense that it has a strong contamination of interlopers but otherwise is quite regular .",
    "a576 is not the only cluster which can be retained for dynamical analysis after careful interloper removal . to illustrate further the importance of interloper removal and",
    "show broader impact of the schemes studied in wojtak et al .",
    "( 2006 ) we studied 15 more nearby ( @xmath104 ) and possibly relaxed ( in terms of regularity of their x - ray maps and velocity diagrams ) clusters with at least 120 galaxies available within projected radius of 2 mpc .",
    "we apply to all of them different procedures of interloper removal and compare corresponding samples of cluster galaxies in terms of numbers of rejected galaxies and results of fitting the isotropic solution of the jeans equation . for clarity",
    "we focus on three most representative methods described in detail in the previous sections : @xmath105 rejection , @xmath38 and @xmath41 ( see wojtak et al .",

    "the problem of contamination by interlopers is common among them we think even those most contaminated should be studied .",
    "we demonstrated that in many such cases proper removal of interlopers can lead to reliable determination of galaxy membership .",
    "the general picture that emerges from our study of 16 clusters is that even in the case of significant contamination different interloper removal schemes can yield similar results increasing our confidence in the final galaxy samples . in the case",
    "when two or more schemes ( usually the methods based on @xmath38 and @xmath41 ) give similar results we recommend the use of @xmath38 since it converges and is independent of any assumptions .",
    "there are cases however with strong substructure visible in the velocity diagrams when only the @xmath41 method seems to give results which clearly separate the subclusters from the main body of the cluster of interest .",

    "we have selected final galaxy samples for our 15 clusters presented in fig .",

    "2006 ; mandelbaum et al .",
    "2006 ; rines & diaferio 2006 ; schmidt & allen 2006 ; buote et al .",

    "[ d_all ] and [ k_all ] determined from the cleaned galaxy samples are very regular , with expected behaviour : the dispersion profile decreases slowly at larger distances while the kurtosis profile is rather flat .",
    "the profiles are well behaved even in the case of a119 , a2634 and a2147 in spite of the fact the surface brightness distributions of the x - ray gas are least regular in these clusters . from this point of view",
    "there is no difference between these originally contaminated clusters and those presumably more regular ones studied in okas et al .",
    "( 2006a ) .",
    "the difference between these two groups manifests itself however in the fitted parameters .",
    "while in the previous study 4 out of 6 clusters had the best - fitting anisotropy parameter @xmath190 , for the present sample this is only the case for 5 clusters out of 16 .",
    "two of the clusters ( a1651 and a2670 ) have @xmath191 corresponding to @xmath192 , indicating significant tangential anisotropy , while three clusters ( a85 , a3571 and a4059 ) have @xmath193 corresponding to @xmath194 , indicating significant radial anisotropy .",
    "this may point towards a more perturbed state of the present sample .",
    "still , all clusters have @xmath33 consistent with isotropy at 1@xmath0 level , except for a85 .",
    "= 7.2 cm    a85 seems to be the most suspicious case in the present sample . while the removal of interlopers would suggest no problems in the analysis ( all three methods yield very similar results in terms of the number of rejected interlopers as well as the fitted mass and concentration , see table  [ clusters_int ] and fig .  [ clusters1 ] ) , while fitting both velocity moments we arrive at rather different parameters , lower mass and concentration and more radial orbits .",
    "the profiles of the velocity moments are also not typical : the first two dispersion data points are much higher than the rest and the kurtosis points lower .",
    "this may point at departures from equilibrium which are indeed confirmed by kempner , sarazin & ricker ( 2002 ) and durret , lima neto & forman ( 2005 ) who studied the x - ray data from chandra and xmm - newton and discovered a subcluster about to merge with a85 as well as evidence for past merging events .",
    "note , however , that the mass estimated from x - ray data by durret et al . within @xmath195 mpc , @xmath196 , is in very good agreement with our mass within this radius @xmath197 .",
    "reiprich & bhringer ( 2002 ) used the rosat x - ray data to estimate the masses of all clusters studied here except for a2593 and a2670 . in all cases",
    "our estimates agree with their findings within errors , only for a426 , a3667 and a4038 our masses are about a factor of two higher .",
    "our mass estimates also agree within errors with the ones found from the virial theorem by girardi et al .",

    "our mass estimate is more than twice lower than the one of girardi et al .",
    "the result in this case may be strongly dependent on the sample selection because the velocity diagram of the cluster is rather irregular .    for a3921 our estimate of the virial mass",
    "is almost four times higher than the one of girardi et al . which is probably due to their rather small sample of only 29 member galaxies while our sample contains 197 members .",
    "referring to x - ray studies with xmm - newton ( belsole et al . 2005 ) we find that there are signatures of recent merger in the form of a bar - like structure of enhanced temperature .",
    "belsole et al . (",
    "2005 ) estimate the mass to be @xmath198 within @xmath199 mpc while within this distance we get @xmath200 , this time a value a factor of two higher .",
    "note however , that our estimate is in very good agreement with the older rosat data ( reiprich & bhringer 2002 ) which give @xmath201 .",
    "going back to the velocity diagram for a3921 in fig .",
    "[ clusters2 ] we see that there are some doubtful galaxies ( e.g. the chain at 2000 km s@xmath10 ) which are not rejected by our algorithms but which may not be cluster members and may in fact overestimate the true cluster mass .",
    "a2147 is a member of the hercules supercluster which obviously makes the assignment of galaxies to each cluster more difficult ( tarenghi et al .",
    "1980 ; barmby & huchra 1998 ) .",
    "together with a4038 it is the only cluster for which neighbours are well visible and we believe the @xmath41 method of interloper removal is more reliable than @xmath38 . in the case of a2147 our mass estimate is about twice lower than the one based on velocity dispersion by barmby & huchra ( 1998 ) .",
    "the difference is obviously due to the different selection of galaxies , for example they did not remove the group at @xmath202 km s@xmath10 ( see fig .",
    "[ clusters3 ] ) . in the case of a4038 we agree with the rough estimate of the cluster mass based on galaxies in the core by green , godwin & peach ( 1990 ) .",
    "we have demonstrated that after careful removal of interlopers a significant number of galaxy clusters can be made eligible for jeans analysis . using the example of a576 we have shown in detail how the different most reliable methods of cleaning the kinematic samples of interlopers work on real data .",
    "we illustrated the complexity of the problem with examples of other clusters displaying different degrees of contamination and different distributions of interlopers .",
