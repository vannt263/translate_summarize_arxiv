    "this paper introduces a family of sorting maps on words that we call _ sweep maps_. in its simplest form , a sweep map @xmath1 uses coprime parameters @xmath2 and @xmath3 to associate a _ level _",
    "@xmath4 to each letter @xmath5 in a word @xmath6 consisting of @xmath7 copies of the letter @xmath8 and @xmath9 copies of the letter @xmath10 .",
    "( note that @xmath2 or @xmath3 may be negative . )",
    "this assignment is done recursively : use the convention that @xmath11 ; for @xmath12 we set @xmath13 if @xmath14 and @xmath15 if @xmath16 .",
    "the word @xmath17 is then obtained by sorting the letters in @xmath18 according to level , starting with @xmath19 , then continuing with @xmath20 .",
    "figure  [ fig : sweepmap1 ] provides an example of @xmath21 acting on the word @xmath22 .",
    "( here we have identified @xmath18 with a lattice path in the plane : each @xmath8 corresponds to a unit - length north step , while each @xmath10 corresponds to a unit - length east step . )",
    "surprisingly , even though sweep maps act by sorting , they are ( apparently ) bijective .",
    "the reader may find it useful to check this bijectivity by hand for @xmath23 acting on the set of all lattice paths from @xmath24 to @xmath25 .",
    "as detailed in conjecture  [ conj : gen - sweep ] , bijectivity seems to hold even for the general sweep maps over arbitrary alphabets with arbitrary weights , described in section  [ subsec : gen ] .",
    "the bijectivity of the general sweep maps appears to be a very subtle and difficult fact .",
    "the order in which the levels are traversed is a key ingredient to bijectivity .",
    "for example , in the case of @xmath26 , @xmath27 , if we scan levels in the order @xmath28 , both of the paths @xmath29 and @xmath30 map to @xmath31 .",
    "the sweep maps encode complex combinatorial information related to @xmath0-catalan numbers , the bergeron - garsia nabla operator , and other constructions arising in representation theory , algebraic geometry , and symmetric functions .",
    "researchers have discovered special cases of the sweep map in many different guises over the last fifteen years or so .",
    "one of the goals of this paper is to present a unifying framework for all of this work . in  @xcite",
    ", loehr introduced bijections on @xmath32-dyck paths , as well as generalizations to lattice paths contained in certain trapezoids , that turn out to be special cases of the sweep map .",
    "the bijection in the case @xmath33 also appears in a paper of haglund and loehr  @xcite and is foreshadowed by a counting argument in haglund s seminal paper on @xmath0-catalan numbers  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proof of thm .",
    "the inverse bijection in the case @xmath33 appears even earlier , where it was used by andrews et al .",
    "@xcite in their study of @xmath34-nilpotent @xmath35-ideals in the lie algebra @xmath36 .",
    "( see also  @xcite . )",
    "more recently , special cases of the sweep map have arisen while studying lattice paths in squares  @xcite ; partition statistics  @xcite ; simultaneous core partitions  @xcite ; and compactified jacobians  @xcite .",
    "we discuss a number of these connections in more detail in section  [ sec : alg - sweep ] .",
    "we suspect that to the typical mathematician , the most interesting question regarding the sweep maps is whether they are bijective ( as conjectured in conjecture  [ conj : gen - sweep ] ) . for a researcher interested in the @xmath0-catalan numbers , however , of comparable interest",
    "is the connection between the sweep maps and statistics on lattice paths such as @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "since shortly after haiman s introduction of @xmath39 , it has been known that a `` zeta map '' takes @xmath39 to @xmath37 to @xmath38 .",
    "one point of view , then , is that rather than having three statistics on dyck paths , we have one statistic  @xmath37  and a sweep map . many polynomials related to the @xmath0-catalan numbers",
    "can be defined using only an `` area '' and an appropriate sweep map . that these polynomials are jointly symmetric ( conjecturally ) supports the utility of this view ( see section  [ sec : area - qtcat ] ) .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : basic ] introduces the necessary background on lattice paths .",
    "we then define sweep maps and present conjecture  [ conj : gen - sweep ] on their bijectivity in section  [ sec : intro - sweep ] .",
    "section  [ sec : alg - sweep ] reviews various algorithms that have appeared in the literature that are equivalent to special cases of the sweep map , while section  [ sec : invert - sweep ] describes how to invert these maps ( when known ) .",
    "finally , section  [ sec : area - qtcat ] shows how the sweep maps may be used to give concise combinatorial formulas for the higher @xmath0-catalan numbers and related polynomials formed by applying the nabla operator to appropriate symmetric functions and then extracting the coefficient of @xmath40 .",
    "an extended abstract of this paper appears as  @xcite .",
    "this section introduces our basic conventions regarding partitions , words , and lattice paths .",
    "integer parameters @xmath41 and @xmath42 will serve to restrict our attention to such objects fitting within a rectangle of height @xmath41 and width @xmath42 .",
    "integer parameters @xmath2 and @xmath3 will be used to assign a `` level '' to the components of the various objects considered .",
    "of particular interest is the case of @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "the constraint of @xmath45 arises naturally in some particular sweep maps such as the map due to armstrong , hanusa and jones  @xcite and the map due to gorksy and mazin  @xcite ( see sections  [ subsec : zetamap ] and  [ subsec : gorsky - mazin ] , respectively ) .",
    "let @xmath46 .",
    "integer partition diagrams with at most @xmath41 parts and largest part at most @xmath42 ( drawn according to the english convention ) fit in the rectangle with vertices @xmath24 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "we denote the set of such partitions ( identified with their diagrams , which are collections of unit squares in the first quadrant ) by @xmath50 .",
    "let @xmath51 denote the set of all words @xmath52 , @xmath53 , for which each @xmath54 , and let @xmath55 denote the subset of words consisting of @xmath41 copies of @xmath56 and @xmath42 copies of @xmath57 .",
    "finally , let @xmath58 denote the set of lattice paths from @xmath24 to @xmath49 consisting of @xmath41 unit - length north steps and @xmath42 unit - length east steps .",
    "there are natural bijections among the three sets @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "each word @xmath62 encodes a lattice path in @xmath61 by letting each @xmath10 correspond to an east step and each @xmath8 correspond to a north step .",

    "we write @xmath64 or @xmath65 for the word associated with a path @xmath66 or a partition @xmath67 , respectively .",
    "operators @xmath68 and @xmath69 are defined analogously .",
    "for example , taking @xmath70 and @xmath71 , the path @xmath66 shown on the left in figure  [ fig : sweepmap1 ] has @xmath72 and @xmath73 . for the word @xmath74",

    "first , assign to each lattice point @xmath78 the * @xmath79-level * @xmath80 .",
    "assign to each lattice square the level of its southeast corner .",
    "we will have occasion to consider two different conventions for associating levels to north and east steps of paths .",
    "for the * east - north ( e - n ) * convention , each east ( resp . north ) step inherits the level of its eastern ( resp .",
    "northern ) endpoint . for the * west - south ( w - s )",
    "* convention , each east ( resp",
    ". north ) step inherits the level of its western ( resp .",
    "southern ) endpoint .",
    "figure  [ fig : labeling ] illustrates the various levels relevant to the word @xmath81 for @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "let @xmath84 denote the set of lattice paths in @xmath85 whose steps all have nonnegative @xmath86-levels under the e - n convention .",
    "we call these paths * @xmath79-dyck paths*. a word @xmath87 is an * @xmath79-dyck word * iff @xmath75 is an @xmath86-dyck path ; let @xmath88 denote the set of such words .",

    "we begin in section  [ subsec : def - sweep ] by giving an algorithmic description of the basic sweep maps for words over the alphabet @xmath92 .",
    "some minor variations are presented in sections  [ subsec : irrat - sweep ] and  [ subsec : minor - var ] .",
    "we then present a general sweep map in section  [ subsec : gen ] that acts on words over any alphabet with arbitrary weights assigned to each letter .",
    "let @xmath93 .",

    "initially , @xmath98 is the empty word . for @xmath99 and",
    "then for @xmath100 , scan @xmath18 from right to left . whenever a letter @xmath5 is encountered with level equal to @xmath101 , append @xmath5 to @xmath98 .",
    "the * @xmath102-sweep map * @xmath103 is defined the same way as @xmath104 , except that : the value @xmath105 is the first value of @xmath101 used rather than the last ; and for each value of @xmath101 , @xmath18 is scanned from left to right .",
    "figure  [ fig : negsweep - ex ] illustrates the action of both @xmath106 and @xmath107 on a path in @xmath108 .",
    "we define the action of @xmath104 on a partition @xmath67 as @xmath109 and the action of @xmath110 on a path as @xmath111 ; similarly for @xmath103 .",
    "geometrically , we think of each step in @xmath75 as a _ wand _ whose _ tip _ is located at the lattice point at the end of each step . this visual description reminds us that the maps @xmath112 are assigning levels to steps in the path using the east - north convention . for @xmath113 and @xmath114 , @xmath115 acts by scanning southwest along each diagonal line @xmath116 ( taking @xmath101 s in the appropriate order ) and `` sweeping up '' the wands",
    "whose tips lie on each of these diagonals .",
    "the wands are laid out in the order in which they were swept up to produce the output lattice path .",
    "the labels on the wand tips are _ not _ part of the final output .",
    "it is clear from this description , or from the original definition , that the sweep map depends only on the `` slope '' @xmath117 ; i.e. , @xmath118 for every positive integer @xmath32 .",
    "the @xmath119 statistic introduced in section  [ subsec : area - stat ] is computed using the @xmath86-levels of the steps in @xmath18 , which depend not just on the ratio @xmath117 but on the specific values of @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "so it is not always safe to assume that @xmath2 and @xmath3 are relatively prime .",
    "since the sweep maps rearrange the letters in the input word @xmath18 , it is immediate that both @xmath104 and @xmath103 map each set @xmath120 into itself .",
    "we will see later that @xmath104 maps each set @xmath88 into itself .",
    "so far , for each rational @xmath117 , we have defined the basic sweep map @xmath115 ( which we also call the * negative - type * sweep map ) and the * positive - type * sweep map @xmath121 .",
    "we can extend this setup to define sweep maps @xmath122 indexed by _ irrational _",
    "numbers @xmath123 .",
    "we regard inputs to @xmath122 as lattice paths @xmath124 consisting of `` wands '' with tips at their north ends and east ends .",
    "there is a `` sweep line '' @xmath125 that sweeps through the plane as @xmath101 decreases from just below zero to negative infinity , then from positive infinity to zero .",
    "because @xmath123 is irrational , every sweep line intersects at most one wand tip in @xmath75 .",
    "we obtain @xmath126 by writing the wands in the order in which the sweep line hits the wand tips .    for fixed @xmath127 and fixed @xmath128 , one readily checks that @xmath129 for all irrationals @xmath123 with @xmath130 and @xmath123 sufficiently close to @xmath117 . on the other hand , @xmath131 for all irrationals @xmath123 with @xmath132 and @xmath123 sufficiently close to @xmath117 .",
    "this explains the terminology `` positive - type '' and `` negative - type '' sweep map .",
    "one approach to studying the sweep map is to understand the `` jump discontinuities '' between @xmath103 and @xmath104 that occur at certain critical rationals @xmath117 .    for irrational @xmath123 ,",
