    "its dependence on the temperature is not evident .",
    "so , in order to obtain some quantitative information about its behavior we derive more workable expressions for specific values of the parameter @xmath0 .",
    "moreover , the complete information about its dependence on the temperature requires that we proceed a numerical evaluation of some non - analytical contributions . here in this paper",
    ", we develop these analysis in the high - temperature regime . in section 4",
    "we summarize our results and give our conclusion about the thermal bath of massless fermions in the global monopole spacetime . in the appendix",

    "the green function associated with a massless left - handed spin-1/2 field in the global monopole spacetime has been obtained recently @xcite .",
    "there this green function is presented by applying the respective dirac operator on the two - components bispinor as we shall summarize below .    in order to write down the dirac operator in the spacetime described by ( [ g - m ] ) we choose the following basis tetrad : @xmath20 with this choice the dirac operator for a massless left - handed fermionic field in a global monopole spacetime given by @xmath21 reduces itself to , @xmath22 , with @xmath23 , being the @xmath24 pauli matrices and @xmath25 the spin connection . ] @xmath26 with @xmath27 , where @xmath28 denotes the standard unit vector along the three spatial directions in spherical coordinates .",
    "the feynman two - components propagator obeys the differential equation @xmath29 and can be given in terms of the bispinor @xmath3 by @xmath30 where @xmath3 obeys the @xmath24 differential equation @xmath31 with @xmath32 in the above equation , the generalized dalembertian operator is expressed by @xmath33 and @xmath34 , the scalar curvature , is equal to @xmath35 for this spacetime .",
    "from now on we shall work with the euclidean version of the spinor green function .",
    "the euclidean bispinor , @xmath36 , can also be obtained from the schwinger - dewitt formalism as follows : @xmath37 where the heat kernel , @xmath38 , can be expressed in terms of the eigenfunctions of the operator @xmath39 as @xmath40 @xmath41 being the corresponding positively defined eigenvalue .",
    "writing @xmath42 the complete set of normalized solutions of the above equation is given by @xcite .",
    "for this reason there is a small changing in the expressions obtained for the normalization of the field itself and its eigenvalue . ] : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the bessel function of the first kind and @xmath45 , with @xmath46 , are the spinor spherical harmonics eigenfunctions of the operators @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "( the explicit expressions for these spherical harmonics and their eigenvalue equations are given in @xcite .",

    "we can see that for @xmath54 , @xmath55 , it is possible to proceed the two summations on the quantum numbers @xmath49 and @xmath56 and ( [ k_infty ] ) reduces itself to : @xmath57    now we are in position to obtain the euclidean bispinor @xmath36 by using ( [ g_infty ] ) . again with the help of @xcite we obtain : @xmath58\\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath59 being the legendre function and @xmath60    the euclidean thermal bispinor can be obtained in the same way by using the thermal heat kernel , @xmath61 : @xmath62    for an ultrastatic spacetime , i.e. , static with @xmath63 , braden @xcite has proved that the thermal heat kernel can be expressed in terms of the sum @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the `` euclidean '' time unit vector",

    "now we can write down our result for the thermal heat kernel : @xmath74   \\ . \\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    finally substituting ( [ k_beta ] ) into ( [ heat_beta ] ) , we obtain an explicit expression for the thermal bispinor , @xmath75 : @xmath76 \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath77    as we can see form ( [ green ] ) , the thermal bispinor contains explicitly the zero - temperature green function , @xmath36 , plus purely thermal contributions .",
    "moreover , because the legendre functions , @xmath78 , decrease proportionally with @xmath79 for large arguments @xcite , we conclude that , for a given set of values of the quantum numbers @xmath49 and @xmath56 , the most relevant thermal corrections to @xmath75 above , come from the first terms in the series in @xmath80 .",
    "finally we can write down our euclidean thermal spinor green function substituting ( [ green ] ) and the euclidean version of ( [ dirac ] ) into ( [ spinor ] ) : @xmath81",
    "the energy - momentum tensor associated with spin-@xmath82 fields , @xmath83 , is bilinear function of the fields .",
    "consequently its vacuum expectation value ( vev ) , @xmath84 , can be evaluated by the standard method using the green function @xcite .    in @xcite the renormalized vev of the energy - momentum tensor associated with a left - handed spin-@xmath82 field in a global monopole",
    "spacetime was explicitly calculated .",
    "there , it was shown that it has the following structure : @xmath85 \\ , \\ ] ] where the scaling parameter @xmath86 appears after the renormalization procedure .",
    "in fact , applying the point - splitting renormalization procedure and extracting from the spinor green function all the divergences by subtracting the correspondent hadamard function , the renormalized vev of the energy - momentum tensor presents a scale - dependent logarithmic term .",
    "this is a consequence of an ambiguity in the definition of @xmath87 in a even dimensional curved spacetime .",
    "the back - reaction probelm consists of solving the einstein equaion in presence of quantum corrections .",
    "so , this one - loop equation contains besides @xmath88 as source of energy - momentum tensor , extra purely geometrical terms @xcite .",
    "the coefficients of these terms must depend on the renormalization scale since the theory must be independent of this scale due to renormalization group equation .",
    "the tensors @xmath89 and @xmath90 depend only on the metric parameter @xmath0 .",
    "moreover , because of the spherical symmetry these tensors are diagonal with components @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "therefore there are only six unknown components .",
    "the renormalized vev of the energy - momentum tensor must be conserved , i.e. , @xmath93 and gives the correct conformal anomaly @xcite , which for massless spinor two - components field , reads @xcite @xmath94 here we have introduced the new definition @xmath95 .",
    "the general form of the coefficient @xmath96 may be found in @xcite , which for the global monopole spacetime has the following form : @xmath97    taking into account ( [ conservation ] ) and ( [ anomaly ] ) it is possible to express the tensors @xmath89 and @xmath90 in terms of their zero - zero components and the trace @xmath10 by @xmath98 and @xmath99 so the only problem left is to determine the components @xmath100 and @xmath101 . using the point - splitting approach ,",
    "the vev of the energy - momentum tensor for a massless spinor field is given by : @xmath102s_f(x , x ' ) \\ , \\ ] ] by which we have @xmath103    it was pointed out in @xcite , that only the time derivative in the bispinor gives a nonzero contribution to the zero - zero component of the energy - momentum tensor . moreover taking the coincidence limit @xmath104 into ( [ greene ] ) , summing over @xmath56 and using the integral representation for the legendre function @xcite , it is possible to develop the sum over @xmath49 .",
    "finally we arrive at the following expression for the euclidean bispinor : @xmath105 where the function @xmath106 is expressed in terms of the one - half of the square of the geodesic distance @xmath107 in @xmath108 surface @xmath109 with @xmath110    the green function ( [ ge ] ) is divergent in the coincidence limit @xmath111 .",
    "so , in order to obtain a finite and well defined result for ( [ t00 ] ) , we must renormalize it subtracting all its divergences . there",
    ", it was adopted the point - splitting renormalization procedure and subtracted from the green function the hadamard one , @xmath112 , which is expressed in terms of the square of geodesic distance @xmath107 .",
    "the latter presents short distance behaviors proportional to @xmath113 , as a free theory , plus a logarithmic scale - dependent term proportional to the scalar curvature of the spacetime @xmath114 .",
    "the thermal average of the energy - momentum tensor of a thermal bath of massless fermions in the global monopole spacetime can be computed in similar way replacing the ordinary spinor greens function in ( [ t_mu , nu ] ) by its thermal correspondent , @xmath115 , given in ( [ s_beta ] ) . for",
    "the sake of simplicity let us consider in this paper the zero - zero component of the thermal average of the energy - momentum tensor , which is also given by @xmath116    the above expression gives us a divergent result which comes exclusively from the the zero - temperature contribution of the thermal bispinor , the component @xmath117 of ( [ green ] ) , which we denominate by @xmath118 .",
    "in fact this singularity is consequence of the evaluation of the legendre function at unity .",
    "so in order to obtain a finite and well defined result for ( [ t00_beta ] ) we have to renormalize its zero - temperature part only , @xmath119 . in this way the renormalized thermal average of the zero - zero component of the energy - momentum tensor can be expressed by @xmath120    because the first term in the right hand side of the above equation has been computed before , in this paper we calculate the purely thermal correction , @xmath121 . again taking the coincidence limit @xmath104 into ( [ green ] ) and",
    "repeating the same procedure adopted for the zero - temperature case , we get @xmath122 where @xmath123 being @xmath124 . because @xmath125 , the purely thermal correction in ( [ t_betar ] ) is finite . changing the variable @xmath126 by @xmath127 in ( [ g_beta ] ) , taking its second time derivative followed by the coincidence limit",
    ", we find : @xmath128 \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath129    unfortunately , from the above expression , it is not possible to obtain any information about the behavior of the energy density associated with a thermal bath of massless fermions in this spacetime as a function of the temperature . at this stage",
    "we only can observe that the integrand decreases exponentially for large values of @xmath130 and that the series in @xmath80 converge faster than @xmath131 when @xmath80 goes to infinity . because we want to have a concrete information about the dependence of @xmath132 with the temperature , our next steps",
    "is to present this dependence for some specific values of the parameter @xmath0 . in what follows",
    "we present this information for three different situations : @xmath133 @xmath0 close to unity , small solid angle deficit ( excess ) , @xmath134 small value of @xmath0 , large solid angle deficit and @xmath135 large value of @xmath0 , large solid angle excess .",
    "( in the appendix we also present some concrete results for @xmath17 and brief discussion for the cases @xmath17 and @xmath19 . )",
    "in this subsection we present the explicit dependence of the purely thermal correction to @xmath121 admitting that @xmath136 .",
    "in fact , because the global monopole is a very heavy object which appears as consequence of a breakdown global @xmath137 gauge symmetry to @xmath138 , for a typical grand unified theory @xmath139 .",
    "so in this case we can expand ( [ energy - density ] ) in powers of the parameter @xmath140 .",

    "we can see that the most relevant contribution comes from @xmath154 , which , according to the precision of our numerical analysis , provides to ( [ a1 ] ) a term proportional to @xmath162 , so independent of the distance from the point to the global monopole",

    "@xmath169 for its logarithmic .",
    "from both it is possible to conclude that @xmath170 where @xmath171 with @xmath172 .",

    "they appear as the first terms of an expansion of a well defined expression .",
    "consequently they are valid only in the case where the argument of the logarithmic never becomes equal to the unity .",
    "this means that , from the numerical point of view , @xmath0 should assume values bigger than some critical one , which depends on the interval domain of the variable @xmath155 , in such way the divergence is never attained . in order to proceed a numerical evaluation of both terms , let us write down both terms in a convenient form , absorbing the factor @xmath176 .",

    "unfortunately we could not find any relationship between these parameters with @xmath0 , although we can notice no significant variations on them , i.e. , the exponents , @xmath185 and @xmath186 , do not change appreciably when we change @xmath0 .",
    "the dominant dependence of @xmath187 with @xmath0 is explicitly given by the power @xmath188 in ( [ ed1 ] ) .",
    "in this paper we have considered the thermal average of the energy density associated with a thermal bath of massless spin-@xmath82 fermions in the background of a pointlike global monopole .",
    "the reason why we have taken into account massless field is because in this case it is possible to express the spinor green function in a closed form in terms of special functions .",
    "moreover , we decided to consider only one helicity state , the left - handed one , associated with the neutrino s degrees of freedom . in order to develop this analysis",
    "we have derived a general expression for the respective euclidean thermal spinor green function , @xmath115 . using this green function",
    "we obtained a formal expression for the the zero - zero component of the thermal average of the energy - momentum tensor , @xmath189 , which contains a zero temperature term plus purely thermal correction . because this correction is expressed in terms of not solvable integrals , its dependence on the temperature could not be evaluated explicitly .",
    "so , to get some quantitative information , we decided to analyze this term for specific values of the parameter @xmath0 .",
    "in this way three formal expressions were obtained for special cases related in last section .",
    "unfortunately our results were expressed in terms of infinite series not analytically evaluated ; however from them it is possible to develop a numerical analysis .",
    "we developed these analysis in a high - temperature regime .",
    "our final results enables us to evaluate qualitatively the thermal corrections , @xmath190 . for the cases @xmath0 close and much smaller than unity ,",
    "the corrections are dominated by terms of order @xmath191 , consequently independent of the distance from the point to the monopole . for the case",
    "@xmath174 , there appears an explicit dependence of this correction with the distance .",
    "the obtained results may have some applications in the early cosmology , where the temperature of the universe was really high .",
    "we can see that the thermal contributions modify significantly the zero - temperature energy density in that epoch .",
    "a few years ago , linet @xcite has obtained the euclidean spinor thermal green function for a massless spin-@xmath82 fermionic field in the spacetime of a global cosmic string .",
    "there , it was possible to express the thermal average of the energy - momentum tensor in a closed form .",
    "linet has found that the high - temperature dominant contribution for energy density is proportional to @xmath191 and that the thermal bath of massless fermions is not perturbed by the presence of the straight cosmic string , is precisely twice bigger than the flat one found in our result in ( [ a1 ] ) .",
    "the discrepancy between both results is because we considered in this paper just one helicity state for the fermionic field . ] . in the pointlike global monopole spacetime",
    "we can not say that . for two specific cases treated here the results for thermal energy - densities in the high - temperature regime present explicit dependence on the parameter @xmath0 .",
    "only the case where @xmath163 does not present this dependence .",
    "the contribution due to the temperature in the renormalized vacuum expectation value of the square of the massless scalar field and its respective energy density in the global monopole spacetime , were recently calculated in @xcite using similar procedure adopted in this paper .",
    "there appears a non - vanishing contribution to the energy density , coming from the geometry of the spacetime , to the dominant @xmath162 term .",
    "here in this appendix we present the purely thermal correction for the energy density for the cases where the parameter @xmath0 assume very specific values .",
    "in this first part we take @xmath17 . for this case",
    "it is possible to develop the integral which appears in ( [ g_beta ] ) .",
    "it is given by @xmath192 \\",
    ", \\ ] ] with @xmath193 . from the above expression we get , after some calculations , the following result : @xmath194    in the above expression appears two contributions which can not be evaluated analytically . again if we are inclined to know how these terms behave as a function of the variable @xmath155 we have to proceed a numerical investigation .",
    "the explicit expressions writing in terms of @xmath155 are given below : @xmath195 and @xmath196    from our numerical analysis , developed in the high - temperature regime , we obtained the following results : @xmath197 and @xmath198 where @xmath199 with @xmath200 and @xmath201 with @xmath202 .",
    "so we can conclude that these two terms present the same order of correction to @xmath187 and are not relevant .",
    "so the dominant contribution comes from the term independent of the distance from the point to the global monopole , followed by a term of order @xmath203 .    for the case",
    "@xmath18 the procedure is similar to this previous one . the integration in ( [ g_beta ] ) can be done and after some intermediate steps it is possible to conclude that the dominant contribution for the energy density , in high - temperature limit is also given by @xmath204 the same dominant behavior is obtained for the case @xmath19 .",
    "we shall not repeat the intermediate steps .    as our final comment in this appendix ,",
    "we want to say that the dominant contributions for @xmath205 in these three examples , coincides with the result found for a flat spacetime , @xmath206 . however , sub - dominant contributions are consequence of the non flat geometry of this spacetime .",
