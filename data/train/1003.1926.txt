    ", the resonance has been found in electron - doped cuprates @xcite , heavy fermion @xcite , and iron arsenide superconductors @xcite . below the superconducting transition temperature @xmath0 , the intensity of the resonance increases like the superconducting order parameter and its energy scales with @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "although the resonance appears to be a ubiquitous property of unconventional superconductors @xcite , its microscopic origin and relationship with superconductivity are still debated @xcite . in all these materials ,",
    "the resonance occurs at the antiferromagnetic ( af ) wavevector @xmath8 of the parent compound .",
    "it is thought to be a triplet excitation of the singlet cooper pairs @xcite , implying a superconducting order parameter that satisfies @xmath9 .",
    "in the iron arsenide superconductors , this condition is satisfied by an order parameter whose sign reverses between the electron and hole pockets @xcite .",
    "if this picture is correct , one would expect that the triplet would be degenerate , and thus directionally isotropic in space .",

    "we report polarized inelastic neutron scattering results for the optimal electron - doped iron arsenide superconductor bafe@xmath1ni@xmath2as@xmath3 ( @xmath4  k ) @xcite .",
    "we find that the resonance previously observed around 7 mev at the af wavevector @xmath10 ( reciprocal lattice units , ` r.l.u ' ) is entirely magnetic , but displays strong spin - space anisotropy , with a peaked response near the resonance energy occurring only for the planar response .",
    "this is different from the momentum space anisotropy , where the spin correlation length might be different along different crystallographic directions @xcite .",
    "our results indicate a strong spin - orbital / lattice coupling in iron arsenide superconductors ( quite different from the cuprates ) , and are a challenge to the common assumption that the resonance represents an isotropic singlet - to - triplet excitation .",

    ", polarization analysis can be used to completely separate magnetic ( e.g.  spin fluctuation ) and nuclear ( e.g.  phonon ) scattering because the spin of the neutron is always flipped in a magnetic interaction where the neutron polarization is parallel to the wavevector transfer @xmath8 @xcite . for convenience",

    "spin - space anisotropy in the zero energy limit has previously been reported from nmr data on an underdoped hole - doped composition with no magnetic order @xcite , which can be explained in terms of the proximity of the composition to the ordered parent compound . however , in our non - magnetically ordered sample , we see not just low frequency anisotropy , but a high frequency novel response that has different energy dependencies between different spin directions .",
    "the presence of spin - orbital / lattice coupling could explain anisotropy in the spin excitations . in pnictides , this is reflected in the undoped compound , where the moments are locked to the orthorhombic @xmath94-axis @xcite [ along @xmath30 direction in our tetragonal notation ] .",
    "the existence of the resonance solely in the in - plane response is a major challenge to the standard theory where the resonance is an isotropic triplet excitation of the singlet superconducting ground state .",
    "to understand the origin of our results within the context of this theory @xcite , we note that the spin operators @xmath95 and @xmath96 , when acting on the spin singlet superconducting ground state , generate the @xmath5 components of the triplet , whereas the spin operator @xmath97 generates the @xmath98 component .",
    "our results therefore imply that the resonance is the @xmath5 doublet . to understand this microscopically",
    ", we note that in the magnetically ordered phase , the @xmath99 component of the triplet would mix with the singlet ground state ( since the moments are oriented along the orthorhombic @xmath94 axis ) . in the non - magnetic tetragonal state , this would lead to a low energy doublet @xmath99 , @xmath100 , which is equivalent to @xmath5 ( see appendix [ appendix_theory ] ) .",
    "an alternate possibility is that the resonance is instead a magnon - like excitation that becomes undamped because of the opening of the superconducting gap @xcite , though it is not clear to us why this scenario would generate a magnetic response that is localized at a particular energy .",

    "as implied by eq .  1 of the paper , in principle the background scattering into the detector should be the same with neutron polarization in @xmath29 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 for any given sf ( or nsf ) measurements since the axes of the instrument do not move .",
    "however , there is a moving part that does change with neutron polarization direction , and that is the ` dipole magnet ' in the outgoing beam , which rotates around the scattered beam axis ( with a position depending on polarization direction , as well as @xmath8 and @xmath82 ) and creates the neutron guide field that defines the neutron polarization direction .",
    "the problem occurs when a choice of @xmath8 and @xmath82 conspires to cause both a scattering angle that is small , and a dipole magnet position close to the horizontal for a certain neutron polarization direction .",
    "neutrons can then scatter in grazing incidence from the dipole magnet shielding , which can increase the background in the detector for that configuration over other neutron polarization directions .    at low @xmath8 ( @xmath80 ) at @xmath1012.5  mev , these problematic conditions are satisfied creating an extra background in the @xmath102 configurations .",
    "however , the dipole magnet is away from horizontal at the same energy and wavevector for the @xmath103 and @xmath104 configurations , which therefore have lower backgrounds . at higher energies ( and other wavevectors ) , the dipole magnet is never close to horizontal when the scattering angle is small enough for a grazing incidence to reach the detector , and so there is no difference between backgrounds of different neutron polarization configurations .",
    "we have confirmed that this is indeed the case , by comparing backgrounds extracted for all the data collected , and found an anomalous effect only for the low @xmath8 region at 2.5  mev .",
    "in conclusion , at @xmath80 in the 2.5  mev q - scan there may be a difference between backgrounds in configurations with different neutron polarizations ( and thus , in this case the assumption in eq",
    ".  1 may not be valid ) .",
    "however , this is not a problem in any other scans , and most importantly does not affect the energy scans at any point .",
    "therefore , as required to correctly extract @xmath37 and @xmath38 , the assumption that the background is neutron polarization direction independent is a good one for the energy scans .     for an unpolarized experiment , calculated using @xmath37 and @xmath38 from the present polarized data . ]",
    "from the present study , from observing the two different spin gaps at 3  mev and @xmath105  mev , and different maxima at approximately 7 and 3  mev in the @xmath37 and @xmath38 channels , one might expect to see these feautures in unpolarized data .",
    "the same compound has been previously studied @xcite by unpolarized neutrons in the @xmath106 scattering plane ( different from the scattering plane in the present study ) .",
    "although there is a resonance at 7  mev and a spin gap around 3  mev , the dynamic susceptibility does not have a peak near 3 mev .",
    "here we show that these results are entirely consistent with the present polarized neutron scattering results .    in the unpolarized experiment ,",
    "the magnetic scattering measured at @xmath107 is proportional to @xmath108 for the crystal alignment used .",
    "if we assume minimal @xmath83 dispersion , then we can take the @xmath37 and @xmath38 values from our present study ( where @xmath86 ) and simulate the ( @xmath109 ) unpolarized data with no unknown parameters .",
    "we can then compare our simulation with the experimental data from the unpolarized experiment . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] , the low energy features in @xmath38 near 3 mev do not cause low energy features in the total unpolarized intensity @xmath108 .",
    "the resulting form of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] is consistent with the data in unpolarized measurements ( in ref . ) , though the resolution in the unpolarized experiment was much better , leading to a much sharper resonance in that study .",
    "the spin singlet cooper pair wavefunction is a product of states of the form @xmath110we operate on this state with the spin operator , @xmath111 , which is the sum of @xmath112 and @xmath113 where 1 and 2 denote the two electrons of the pair . for the spin raising operator",
    ", we find@xmath114this is the @xmath115=1 component of a triplet pair with center of mass momentum @xmath116 ( the minus sign being a reflection of fermion antisymmetry ) .",
    "similarly , @xmath117 generates the @xmath115=-1 component .",
    "had we operated with @xmath118 instead , we would have obtained the @xmath115=0 component of the triplet .",

    "assume that superconductivity and antiferromagnetism coexist , corresponding to the spin resonance being at zero energy .",
    "if one pairs electrons using antiferromagnetic eigenstates , and then rewrites these pairs in terms of paramagnetic eigenstates , the resulting pair state is well known to be a mixture of a singlet and the @xmath115=0 component of a triplet,@xcite with @xmath26 parallel to the direction of the neel vector . in the isotropic case",
    ", the neel vector can point in any direction , which is why the resonance is a triplet .",
    "but for the antiferromagnetic ground state of the pnictides , the spins are locked to the orthorhombic @xmath94 axis .",
    "therefore , the mixed triplet component of the pairs for a coexisting state would be @xmath124=0 .",
    "if we then average in the plane so as to restore tetragonal symmetry , then the @xmath125=0 component would be involved as well .",

    "<S> we use polarized inelastic neutron scattering to show that the neutron spin resonance below @xmath0 in superconducting bafe@xmath1ni@xmath2as@xmath3 ( @xmath4 k ) is purely magnetic in origin . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis further reveals that the resonance peak near 7  mev only occurs for the planar response . </S>",
    "<S> this challenges the common perception that the spin resonance in the pnictides is an isotropic triplet excited state of the singlet cooper pairs , as our results imply that only the @xmath5 components of the triplet are involved . </S>"
