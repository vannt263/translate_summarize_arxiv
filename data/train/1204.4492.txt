    "understanding the spectral features in cosmic rays ( crs ) is of fundamental importance for any theory of their origin and propagation .",
    "the spectrum of cr nuclei above @xmath010gev per nucleon is thought to be the result of acceleration mechanisms in supernova remnants ( snr ) , which is steepened by propagation in the interstellar medium ( ism ) due to leakage from the galaxy @xcite .",
    "the acceleration of primary crs is described by the diffusive shock acceleration ( dsa ) theory that predicts power - law spectra @xmath1 with slope @xmath22.02.2 .",

    "this description predicts power - law spectra such as @xmath0@xmath5 for primary nuclei ( _ e.g. _ , , ) and @xmath0@xmath6 for secondary - to - primary ratios ( _ e.g. _ , ) . the parameters @xmath7 and @xmath8 are not firmly predicted _ a priori _ and can be inferred from the data .",
    "observations constrain @xmath92.7 ( depending on the element ) and @xmath100.30.7 , whereby @xmath112.02.4 . yet",
    ", this picture dramatically over - predicts the cr anisotropy at @xmath12tev energies , which would suggest an almost energy - independent diffusivity .",
    "although the cr flux may also be affected by stochasticity effects on snr events @xcite , the high degree of isotropy observed in crs poses a serious challenge to the conventional approach to the cr propagation .",
    "even more dramatically , the cr spectra at @xmath13100gev / nucleon exhibit a remarkable hardening with increasing energies .",
    "this feature has been established by recent experiments atic-2 @xcite , cream @xcite and _ pamela _ @xcite , though the data are a little discrepant with each other .",
    "the proposed explanations interpret the hardening as a _ source effect _ connected with acceleration mechanisms @xcite , nearby snrs @xcite or arising by different populations of cr sources @xcite .",
    "the subsequent impact of the hardening on the secondary cr production was estimated by @xcite for @xmath14 , @xcite for @xmath15 and @xmath16rays , and @xcite for light nuclei .",
    "the latter also considered a possible diffusive origin of the effect , described by means of an effective break in the slope of @xmath17 , around @xmath0200gev / nucleon , from @xmath180.3 to @xmath180.15 .",
    "contrary to these works , we propose that the hardening originates from a spatial change of the cr diffusion properties in the different regions of the galaxy .",
    "in fact , propagation studies assume that crs experience the same type of diffusion in the whole propagation region , with only few exceptions for particular environments ( _ e.g. _ , in snr shells or inside the heliosphere ) that are treated separately . a more realistic position - dependent diffusivity ( correlated with the snr density )",
    "is considered in some works ( _ e.g. _ , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but they still adopt a unique energy dependence for @xmath19 in the whole halo , which leads to essentially unchanged results for the shapes of cr spectra at earth .",
    "such descriptions may represent an over - simplification of the problem . in theoretical considerations ,",
    "the diffusion is caused by the cr scattering on hydromagnetic waves which , in turn , depends on the nature and scale distribution of the magnetic - field irregularities .",
    "while snr explosions may generate large irregularities in the region near the galactic plane , the situation in the outer halo is much different because there are no snrs .",
    "the main source of turbulent motion in the halo is presumably represented by crs themselves . from these considerations , @xcite found that the turbulence spectrum in the halo ( in the far outer galaxy ) should be flatter than that in the plane ( in the inner galaxy ) .",
    "this implies strong latitudinal changes ( gradual radial changes ) for the parameter @xmath8 and suggests spectral variations of crs throughout the galaxy .",
    "noticeably , new data reported by _",
    "fermi_/lat on the diffuse @xmath16-ray emission at @xmath010100gev of energy seem to support these suggestions .",
    "the @xmath16-ray spectra observed near the galactic plane ( latitude @xmath208@xmath21 ) are found to be harder than those at higher latitudes , and similar differences are also found between the inner galaxy ( longitude @xmath22 or @xmath23 ) and the outer galaxy @xcite .    in this letter , we focus our attention on the latitudinal changes of the cr diffusion properties ( which are expected to be more extreme ) and we show that they inevitably lead to a pronounced hardening for the energy spectra of cr nuclei at earth .",
    "using analytical calculations , we examine the implications of this scenario for the main cr observables primary spectra , secondary - to - primary ratios and latitudinal anisotropy and discuss its connections with the open problems in the cr acceleration / propagation physics .",
    "we use a simple model of cr diffusion and nuclear interactions .",
    "the effects of energy changes and convection are disregarded .",
    "the galaxy is modeled to be a disk , with half - thickness @xmath24 , containing the interstellar gas ( number density @xmath25 ) and the cr sources .",
    "the disk is surrounded by a diffusive halo of half - thickness @xmath26 and zero matter density . for simplicity",
    "we give a one - dimensional description ( infinite disk radius ) in the thin disk limit ( @xmath27 ) and we restrict to stable species . for each cr nucleus",

    "the source term @xmath35 can be split into a primary term @xmath36 , from snrs , and a secondary production term @xmath37 , from spallation of heavier ( @xmath38 ) nuclei with rate @xmath39 .",
    "the quantities @xmath40 , @xmath19 , @xmath35 , and @xmath41 depend on energy too .",

    "however , the model predictions in terms of cr spectra at earth remain equivalent to those of the after a proper choice of @xmath84 .",
    "this is a general property of eq.[eq::identity ] : as long as @xmath85 is separable in @xmath30 and @xmath86 , the function @xmath87 is independent on energy and the spectra at @xmath30=@xmath88 are equivalent to a mere rescaling of the model parameters .",

    "is implicitly assumed in all cr propagation models .",
    "physically , it describes a unique diffusion regime in the whole halo , given by @xmath89 , while @xmath90 allows for spatial variations in its normalization .",
    "the quantity @xmath84 can be regarded as an _ effective halo height _ experienced by crs at equilibrium .",
    "+    we now put into practice our hypothesis on the latitudinal variations of the cr diffusion properties , which implies that @xmath85 is not separable as @xmath91 everywhere .",
    "we follow the arguments given in @xcite , but our aim is not to inspect the astrophysical plausibility of their suggestions .",
    "rather , we consider a phenomenological scenario in order to illustrate the effect and its consequences for the main cr observables .",
    "we adopt a simple _ two - halo model _ ( ) consisting in two diffusive zones . the _ inner halo _ , representing the region influenced by snrs ,",
    "is taken to surround the disk for a typical size @xmath92 of a few hundred pc ( @xmath930.1 ) .",

    "we use the same @xmath97 values on both halos , as their relative normalization can be controlled by @xmath98 . for @xmath99 , the diffusion coefficient of eq.[eq::twohalodiffcoeff ]",
    "produces a higher cr confinement in the inner halo ( with @xmath1001/3 ) , whereas the outer halo ( with @xmath1010.5  1 ) represents a reservoir from which crs leak out rapidly and can re - enter the inner halo . from eq.[eq::identity ] , one can compute @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",

    "this effect can be better understood if one neglects the term @xmath41 and takes a source term @xmath106 . from eq.[eq::solutionvsz ] and eq.[eq::lvsrig ] one finds @xmath107 which describes the cr spectrum as a result of two components .",
    "its differential log - slope as a function of rigidity reads @xmath108 which indicates a clear transition between two regimes . in practice , the low - energy regime ( @xmath109 )",
    "is never reached due to spallation ( neglected in the above equations ) that becomes relevant and even dominant over escape ( @xmath110 ) . in this case",
    "the log - slope is better approximated by @xmath111 @xcite .",
    "the hard high - energy regime ( @xmath112 ) is determined by the diffusion properties of the inner halo only , because the outer halo is characterized by a much fast particle leakage . in this limit",

    "the effect vanishes at all rigidities when passing to the limit of @xmath114 ( one - halo ) or @xmath115 ( identical halos ) , where one recovers the usual relation @xmath116 .",
    "furthermore , from eq.[eq::solutionvsz ] , it can be seen that the intensity of the harder component diminishes gradually with increasing @xmath117 , _",
    "i.e. _ , the cr spectra at high energies are steeper in the outer halo .",
    "we compute the spectra at earth by @xmath118 , from eq.[eq::solutionvsz ] , at kinetic energies above 10gev .",

    "note , however , that our model may be inadequate in this energy region due to the low - energy approximations . at higher energies ,",
    "our model reproduces well the observed changes in slope , in agreement with the trends indicated by the data .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the sharp spectral structures suggested by the _",
    "pamela _ data at @xmath0300gev can not be recovered .",
    "the predictions are also compared with power - law extrapolations ( dashed line ) to better illustrate the differences .",
    "it can be seen that the spectral upturn is slightly less pronounced for elements with large mass @xmath136 such as , due to the competing action of the term @xmath41 below a few 100gev / nucleon ( note that @xmath137 ) . above @xmath0100tev / nucleon , the elemental _ knees _ are matched well using @xmath1382.5@xmath13110@xmath132gv , which is somewhat lower than that from -based estimates @xcite .",
    "for instance , the spectra of fig.[fig::ccelementalgroups ] ( dashed lines ) employ @xmath1387@xmath13110@xmath132gv .",
    "a distinctive feature of our model is provided by the secondary - to - primary ratios . from eq.[eq::solutionvsz ] , neglecting @xmath41 , it is easy to see that , roughly , secondary - to - primary ratios must harden as @xmath139 .",
    "in fig.[fig::ccbcratio]a we plot the ratio",
    ". remarkably , describes well the data down to energies of 1gev / nucleon , notwithstanding the low - energy approximations .",
    "its low - energy behavior is very similar to that of , which uses @xmath1400.6 in the whole halo . at energies above @xmath050gev / nucleon ,",
    "predicts a significant flattening for the ratio , which is also suggested by recent data from tracer .",
    "similar conclusions can be drawn for .",
    "we also expect a similar trend ( but less obvious ) for the @xmath141 ratio , which should be flatter than that estimated in @xcite .",
    "all these features can be tested by the upcoming alpha magnetic spectrometer ( ) data on elemental spectra ( to ) and nuclear ratios ( or @xmath141 ) .",
    "we remark that a multi - channel study may be necessary to disentangle this effect from other possible processes , see , _ e.g. _ , @xcite .",
    "the hardening of the ratio is also connected with the anisotropy .",
    "this can be illustrated for the latitudinal component of the anisotropy , @xmath142 , which is due to the vertical outflow of crs from the galactic plane .",
    "it can be written as @xmath143 where @xmath1440.2 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "figure[fig::ccbcratio]b shows @xmath145 for the considered models compared with direct measurements of the anisotropy amplitude . due to limitations implicit in eq.[eq::anisotropy ]",
    "as well as possible contributions from stochasticity @xcite , the model comparison with the data is necessarily qualitative .",
    "we focus on the comparison among the models , which is more instructive .",
    "@xmath142 increases with energy as @xmath0@xmath146 ( which is fixed by the ratio and can not be arbitrarily changed ) so that the yields @xmath147 , whereas and predict a natural flattening of @xmath142 . in particular , predicts a much lower anisotropy while keeping a good agreement with the data at @xmath148100gev / nucleon .",
    "its high - energy behavior @xmath149 is similar to that of _ scenario p _ in @xcite , but our model does not fall into any of their scenarios .",
    "it is interesting noticing that the anisotropy may also be reduced at all energies if one accounts for a proper radial dependence for @xmath19 .",
    "this is shown in @xcite , which assumed a spatial correlation between diffusivity and snr density . in our model ,",
    "the source spectra are fairly soft ( @xmath1502.3 ) for the dsa requirements , however they are not exceedingly soft according to recent calculations where the alfvn speed of the scattering centers is accounted @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "gives a dependence @xmath151 at high energies , but requires @xmath22.2 , which agrees better with the basic dsa predictions .",
    "we recall that state - of - the - art models employ @xmath22.4 and @xmath1521/3 @xcite and require large amounts reacceleration to match the data .",
    "besides , other + @xmath141 combined analyses favor @xmath1521/2 and smaller amounts of reacceleration @xcite . within our scenario , the observed steepness of the low - energy ratio shares the same origin of the high - energy hardening of the primary spectra .",
    "it can be therefore explained , under a purely diffusive picture , why all -based studies lead to systematically large values for the parameter @xmath8 .",
    "in this letter , we have proposed a new interpretation for the spectral hardening observed in crs . as shown",
    ", it may be a consequence of a spatial change of the cr diffusion properties in the galaxy . from this scenario",
    "the hardening arises naturally as a local effect and vanishes gradually in the outer halo , where the cr spectra are also predicted to be steeper .",
    "this effect must be experienced by all cr nuclei as well as by secondary - to - primary ratios .",
    "recent data ( _ e.g. _ , _ fermi_/lat or tracer ) seem to support this scenario , but the predicted spectral upturn is more gradual than that suggested by _",
    "pamela _ data . with dedicated analysis of the data forthcoming from or _",

    "our scenario has remarkable implications for the cr physics . with the setup",
    ", we have shown that a kolmogorov diffusion for the inner halo ( @xmath1001/3 ) is consistent with relatively hard source spectra ( @xmath112.2 ) . with the setup",
    ", we have shown that a very slow diffusion for the inner halo ( @xmath1001/6 ) can reconcile the anisotropy with the ratio .",
    "interestingly , it does not require prohibitively steep source spectra as one might expect .",
    "both formulations are based on plain diffusion models where the diffusion coefficient is not separable into energy ( rigidity ) and space terms as usually assumed .",
    "their good agreement with data suggests that the cr propagation at @xmath13450gev / nucleon might be only moderately affected by low - energy effects such as reacceleration . at the highest energies",
    ", we found that the elemental knees can be matched using @xmath02.5@xmath13110@xmath132gv of maximum snr rigidity , which is attainable by known acceleration mechanisms .",
    "further elaborations may be performed using numerical methods , in order to introduce a radial dependence of @xmath19 or other effects connected with the galactic structure .",
    "calculations of other observables such as @xmath141 , @xmath153be/@xmath154be , or @xmath16rays may lead to a deeper understanding of the effect .",
