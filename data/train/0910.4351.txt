    "let consider the generic model of inverse problems @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 refer to the unknown and the data in a banach space @xmath3 and @xmath4 , and @xmath5 is a nonlinear operator .",
    "the model can represent a variety of inverse problems arising in industrial applications including computerized tomography , inverse scattering and image processing .    due to the ill - poisedness of the problem ,",
    "a regularization method must be applied in order to retrieve @xmath6 from the noisy data @xmath7 and there are numerous works devoted for regularization methods .",
    "one of the most appealing regularization techniques is tikhonov regularization , which has been studied from both theoretical and computational aspects by many authors .",
    "the tikhonov regularization takes the minimizer of @xmath8 to the functional @xmath9 in an admissible set @xmath10 : @xmath11 where @xmath12 here @xmath13 is the regularization parameter compromising the data fitting and fidelity term @xmath14 and a priori information encoded in the restoration energy functional @xmath15 of @xmath6 .",

    "the selection of a parameter @xmath28 is crucial for the stable solution and there is a significant amount of works for the development of methods for choosing a suitable parameter . among others ,",
    "we refer to @xcite .",
    "the minimum value function ( see definition [ def_value ] ) appearing in tikhonov regularization technique is very useful in determining the regularization parameter . in @xcite on several principles such as the generalized principle of discrepancy , the generalized principle of quasisolutions , the generalized principle of smoothing functional , and the principles are investigated by the calculus of the minimum value function .",
    "the value function calculus also gives an insight to well known conventional principles such as morozov principle .",
    "for example , ito and kunisch proposed in @xcite study the morozov principle in terms of the minimum value function for nonlinear inverse problems . on the basis of the value function calculus",
    ", they propose a modified morozov principle . as we see in section 4 , other conventional principles",
    "can also be formulated in terms of the value function .    in all the principles",
    "we have mentioned , each of the regularization parameters is determined with an equation including the value function and its higher derivatives .",
    "it can be computationally expensive to solve the equation numerically . in order to reduce the computational effort , an efficient method and an algorithm should be developed .",
    "a model function approach is proposed in @xcite , in which an approximation ( a model function ) to the minimum value function is constructed and use the model function for the value function in their principle .",
    "other principles and numerical algorithms can be found in kunisch and zou @xcite , xie and zou @xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "new results on the properties of the minimum value function are derived in a general set - up for problem ( [ tikhonovfunctional ] ) , and a new principle for a choice of a regularization parameter is proposed using the minimum value function , which strongly relates to the principle of reginska @xcite also known as the minimum product criterion .",
    "we also propose a model function for the value function and employ the model function approach in several conventional principles to numerically compute the regularization parameters accurately and efficiently .",
