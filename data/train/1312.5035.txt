    "sybil attacks , where a single entity emulates the behavior of multiple users , form a fundamental threat to the security of distributed systems  @xcite .",
    "example systems include peer - to - peer networks , email , reputation systems , and online social networks .",
    "for instance , in 2012 it was reported that 83 million out of 900 million facebook accounts are sybils  @xcite .",
    "sybil accounts in online social networks are used for criminal activities such as spreading spam or malware  @xcite , stealing other users private information  @xcite , and manipulating web search results via  + 1 \" or  like \" clicks  @xcite .",
    "traditionally , sybil defenses require users to present trusted identities issued by certification authorities .",
    "however , such approaches violate the open nature that underlies the success of these distributed systems  @xcite . recently",
    ", there has been a growing interest in leveraging social networks to mitigate sybil attacks  @xcite .",
    "these schemes are based on the observation that , although an attacker can create arbitrary sybil users and social connections among themselves , he or she can only establish a limited number of social connections to benign users . as a result ,",
    "sybil users tend to form a community structure among themselves , which enables a large number of sybil users to integrate into the system .",
    "note that it is crucial to obtain social connections that represent trust relationships between users , otherwise the structure - based sybil detection mechanisms have limited detection accuracy .",
    "see section  [ social_model ] for more discussions .",
    "however , existing structure - based approaches suffer from one or more of the following drawbacks : ( 1 ) they can bootstrap from either only known benign  @xcite or known sybil nodes  @xcite , limiting their detection accuracy ( see section  [ eva_syn ] ) , ( 2 ) they can not tolerate noise in their prior knowledge about known benign  @xcite or sybil nodes  @xcite , and ( 3 ) they are not scalable  @xcite .",
    "to overcome these drawbacks , we recast the problem of finding sybil users as a semi - supervised learning problem , where the goal is to propagate reputations from a small set of known benign and/or sybil users to other users along the social connections between them . more specifically , we first associate a binary random variable with each user in the system ; such random variable represents the label ( i.e. , benign or sybil ) of the user .",
    "second , we model the social network between users in the system as a pairwise markov random field , which defines a joint probability distribution for these binary random variables .",
    "third , given a set of known benign and/or sybil users , we infer the posterior probability of a user being benign , which is treated as the reputation of the user .",
    "for efficient inference of the posterior probability , we couple our framework with loopy belief propagation  @xcite , an iterative algorithm for inference on probabilistic graphical models .",
    "we extensively evaluate the influence of various factors including parameter settings in the sybilbelief , the number of labels , and label noises on the performance of sybilbelief . for instance , we find that sybilbelief is relatively robust to parameter settings , sybilbelief requires one label per community , and sybilbelief can tolerate 49% of labels to be incorrect in some cases .",
    "in addition , we compare sybilbelief with state - of - the - art sybil classification and ranking approaches on real - world social network topologies .",
    "our results demonstrate that sybilbelief performs orders of magnitude better than previous sybil classification mechanisms and significantly better than previous sybil ranking mechanisms .",
    "finally , sybilbelief proves to be more resilient to noise in our prior knowledge about known benign users and known sybil users .    in summary",
    ", our work makes the following contributions :    * we propose sybilbelief , a semi - supervised learning framework , to perform both sybil classification and sybil ranking .",
    "sybilbelief overcomes a number of drawbacks of previous work .",
    "* we extensively evaluate the impact of various factors including parameter settings in sybilbelief , the number of labels , and label noise on the performance of sybilbelief using synthetic social networks .",
    "for instance , we find that sybilbelief is relatively robust to parameter settings , sybilbelief requires one label per community , and sybilbelief can tolerate 49% of labels to be incorrect in some cases .",
    "* we demonstrate , via evaluations on real - world social networks , that sybilbelief performs orders of magnitude better than previous sybil classification mechanisms and significantly better than previous sybil ranking mechanisms . moreover , sybilbelief is more resilient to label noise , i.e. , partially corrupted prior knowledge about known benign users and known sybil users .",
    "we formally define the sybil detection problem . specifically , we first introduce the social network model .",
    "then we introduce a few design goals .",
    "let us consider an undirected social network @xmath0 , where a node @xmath1 represents a user in the system and an edge @xmath2 indicates that the users @xmath3 and @xmath1 are socially connected . in an ideal setting , @xmath4 represents a weighted network of trust relationships between users , where the edge weights represent the levels of trust between users  @xcite .",
    "each node is either _ benign _ or _ sybil_.    figure  [ sybil ] illustrates a sybil attack .",
    "we denote the subnetwork including the benign nodes and the edges between them as the _ benign region _ , denote the subnetwork including the sybils and edges between them as the _ sybil region _ , and denote the edges between the two regions as _ attack edges_. note that the benign region could consist of multiple communities and we will evaluate their impact on sybil detections in section  [ sec : exp_sb ] .",
    "an attacker could obtain attack edges via spoofing benign nodes to link to sybils or compromising benign nodes , which turns the edges between the compromised benign nodes and other benign nodes to attack edges .",
    "compromised benign nodes are treated as sybils , and they could be those whose credentials are available to the attacker or _ front peers _",
    "@xcite who collude with sybils .",
    "one fundamental assumption underlying the structure - based sybil detections is that the benign region and the sybil region are sparsely connected ( i.e. , the number of attack edges is small ) , compared to the connections among themselves .",
    "we notice that this assumption is equivalent to assuming that the social networks follow _ homophily _ , i.e. , two linked nodes tend to have the same label .",
    "for an extreme example , if the benign region and the sybil region are isolated from each other , then the network has perfect homophily , i.e. , every two linked nodes have the same label .",
    "as we will see in section  [ sec : model ] , the concept of homophily can better help us incorporate both known benign and sybil nodes because it explicitly models labels of nodes .",
    "note that , it is crucial to obtain social networks that satisfy the homophily assumption .",
    "otherwise the detection accuracies of structure - based approaches are limited .",
    "for instance , yang et al .",
    "@xcite showed that the _ friendship network _ in renren , the largest online social networking site in china , does not satisfy this assumption , and thus structure - based approaches should not be applied to such friendship networks .",
    "however , cao et al .",
    "@xcite found that the invitation - based friendship network in tuenti , the leading online social network in spain , satisfies the homophily assumption , and thus their sybil ranking mechanism achieves reasonably good performance .",
    "in general , online social network operators can obtain social networks that satisfy homophily via two methods .",
    "one method is to approximate _ trust _ relationships between users through looking into user interactions  @xcite , inferring tie strengths  @xcite , and asking users to rate their social contacts  @xcite .",
    "the other method is to preprocess the networks so that they are suitable for structure - based approaches .",
    "in particular , operators could first detect and remove compromised benign nodes ( e.g. , front peers )  @xcite , which decreases the number of attack edges and increases the homophily . moreover , alvisi et al .",
    "@xcite showed that some simple detectors might enforce the social networks to be suitable for structure - based sybil defenses if the attack edges are established randomly  @xcite .",
    "our goal is to detect sybils in a system via taking a social network between the nodes in the system , a small set of known benign nodes , and ( optionally ) a small set of known sybils as input . specifically , we have the following design goals .",
    "sybil classification / ranking : _ our goal is to design a mechanism that can either classify nodes into benign and sybil or that can rank all nodes in descending order of being benign .",
    "_ 2 . incorporating known labels : _ in many settings",
    ", we already know that _ some _ users are benign and that some users are sybil .",
    "for instance , in twitter , verified users can be treated as known benign labels and users spreading spam or malware can be treated as known sybil labels . to improve overall accuracy of the system",
    ", the mechanism should have the ability to incorporate information about both known benign and known sybil labels .",
    "it is important that the mechanism should not _ require _ information about known sybil labels , but if such information is available , then it should have the ability to use it .",
    "this is because in some scenarios , for example when none of the sybils have performed an attack yet , we might not have known information about any sybil node .",
    "_ 3 . tolerating label noise : _ while incorporating information about known benign or known sybil labels , it is important that the mechanism is resilient to noise in our prior knowledge about these labels .",
    "for example , an adversary could compromise the account of a known benign user , or could get a sybil user whitelisted .",
    "we target a mechanism that is resilient when a minority fraction of known labels are incorrect .",
    "scalability : _ many distributed systems ( e.g. , online social networks , reputation systems ) have hundreds of millions of users and billions of edges .",
    "thus , for real world applicability , the computational complexity of the mechanism should be low , and the mechanism should also be parallelizable .",
    "requirements 2 , 3 , and 4 distinguish our framework from prior work .",
    "sybil classification approaches such as sybillimit  @xcite and sybilinfer  @xcite do not incorporate information about known sybil labels ( limiting detection accuracy , as shown in section  [ eva_syn ] ) , are not resilient to label noise , and are not scalable .",
    "sybil ranking approaches such as sybilrank  @xcite and cia  @xcite incorporate information about either known benign or known sybil labels , but not both .",
    "they are also not resilient to label noise .",
    "we introduce our approach sybilbelief , which is scalable , tolerant to label noise , and able to incorporate both known benign labels and sybil labels .",
    "to quantify the homophily in social networks , we first propose a new probabilistic local rule which determines the reputation score for a node @xmath5 via aggregating its neighbors label information .",
    "then , we demonstrate that this local rule can be captured by modeling social networks as markov random fields ( mrfs ) . specifically , each node in the network is associated with a binary random variable whose state could either be _ benign _ or _ sybil _ , and mrfs define a joint probability distribution over all such random variables .",
    "given a set of known benign labels and/or known sybil labels , the posterior probabilities that nodes are benign are used to classify or rank them . we adopt loopy belief propagation  @xcite to approximate the posterior probabilities .",
    "figure  [ sybil ] illustrates how sybilbelief iteratively propagates the beliefs / reputations from the labeled nodes to the remaining ones .",
    "recall that we have a social network @xmath6 of the nodes in the system .",
    "each node can have two states , i.e. , benign or sybil .",
    "thus , we associate a binary random variable @xmath7 with each node .",
    "@xmath8 means that node @xmath5 is a benign node and @xmath9 indicates that node @xmath5 is sybil . in the following",
    ", we use @xmath10 to represent the set of random variables associated with the nodes in the set @xmath11 .",
    "moreover , we use @xmath12 to denote the observed values of these random variables .",
    "there might exist some prior information about a node @xmath5 independently from all other nodes in the system .",
    "such prior information could be the content generated by @xmath5 or its behavior .",
    "we model the prior belief of @xmath5 being benign as follows : @xmath13 where @xmath14 quantifies the prior information about @xmath5 .",
    "more specifically , @xmath15 encodes the scenario in which @xmath5 is more likely to be benign ; @xmath16 encodes the opposite scenario ; @xmath17 means prior information is not helpful to determine @xmath5 s state .",
    "we now introduce @xmath18 , the set of @xmath5 s neighbors in the social network , and their respective states @xmath19 .",
    "when these states are known , the probability of @xmath5 to be benign is modeled as @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the coupling strength between @xmath22 and @xmath5 . specifically , @xmath23 means @xmath22 and @xmath5 tend to have the same state ; @xmath24 indicates @xmath22 and @xmath5 tend to have opposite states ; and @xmath25 indicates that there is no coupling between them . in practice , these coupling strengths can encode trust levels between nodes .",
    "note that our local rule in equation  [ local_rule ] incorporates the homophily assumption via setting @xmath23 .",
    "we find that the probabilistic local rule introduced in the previous section can be applied by modeling the social network as a pairwise markov random field ( mrf ) .",
    "a mrf defines a joint probability distribution for binary random variables associated with all the nodes in the network .",
    "specifically , a mrf is specified with a _ node potential _ for each node @xmath5 , which incorporates prior knowledge about @xmath5 , and with an _ edge potential _ for each edge @xmath26 , which represents correlations between @xmath22 and @xmath5 . in the context of sybil detection",
    ", we define a node potential @xmath27 for the node @xmath5 as @xmath28 and an _ edge potential @xmath29 _ for the edge @xmath26 as @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "then , the following mrf satisfies the probabilistic local rule .",
    "@xmath33 where @xmath34 is called the partition function and normalizes the probabilities .",
    "the node potential @xmath27 incorporates our prior knowledge about node @xmath5 .",
    "specifically , setting @xmath35 assigns a higher probability to node @xmath5 of being benign than sybil . setting @xmath36 models",
    "the opposite and @xmath37 is indifferent between the two states .",
    "this is the mechanism through which our framework can incorporate given benign or sybil labels .",
    "the edge potential @xmath29 encodes the coupling strength of two linked nodes @xmath22 and @xmath5 .",
    "the larger @xmath38 is , the stronger the model favors @xmath22 and @xmath5 to have the same state .",
    "more precisely , @xmath39 means connected nodes tend to have the same state ; @xmath40 means connected nodes tend to have opposite states ; @xmath41 encodes the scenario where there is no coupling between @xmath22 and @xmath5 .",
    "note that setting @xmath39 encodes our homophily assumption .",
    "first , we modify the above mrf to incorporate known labels .",
    "then we use the modified model to perform both sybil classification and sybil ranking .",
    "* leveraging given labels : *   suppose we observe states for a set of nodes , and let us denote them as @xmath42 .",
    "we use these labels to set the corresponding parameters in the mrf as follows . for any unlabeled node @xmath5",
    ", i.e. , @xmath43 , we set @xmath44 .",
    "moreover , our inference model ( i.e. , equation  4 ) does not rely on the prior beliefs of those labeled nodes .",
    "so we can set @xmath45 to be any positive value , where @xmath46 .",
    "the coupling strength parameter is set as @xmath47 for any edge @xmath26 to model the homophily assumption .    to be convenient in our later analysis",
    ", we define _ evidence potentials _ using known labels as follows : @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the known label of node @xmath5 , and @xmath50 is the kronecker delta function , i.e. , @xmath51 if @xmath52 , otherwise @xmath53 .    in our modified model ,",
    "given the labeled node set @xmath54 , we can compute the posterior distribution for each unlabeled node @xmath5 . specifically",
    ", we have @xmath55    the posterior probabilities @xmath56 that @xmath5 is benign given observed nodes @xmath54 are used to _ classify _ or _ rank _ them . *",
    "sybil classification : *   we map the sybil classification problem as the following inference problem .",
    "@xmath57 where @xmath58 is the inferred label of @xmath5 , i.e. , @xmath59 indicates that @xmath5 is benign , otherwise @xmath5 is sybil .    *",
    "sybil ranking : *   we use the posterior probabilities @xmath56 to rank all the unlabeled nodes .    * boosting : *   we use a boosting strategy for our algorithm if either only labeled benign nodes or only labeled sybil nodes are given . since both cases are algorithmically equivalent , we take the first case as an example to illustrate our strategy . we first sample some nodes uniformly at random from the entire system , and we treat them as labeled sybil nodes . then we compute the posterior distribution of every unlabeled node . in each such process , we get a posterior distribution for every node .",
    "furthermore , we repeat this process @xmath60 times .",
    "thus , we get @xmath60 posterior distributions for every node , which are denoted as @xmath61 , where @xmath62 .",
    "we aggregate the @xmath60 posterior distributions for every node as follows : @xmath63    the aggregated posterior distributions are then used to classify or rank nodes .",
    "this boosting strategy works because our model can update prior beliefs and therefore is robust to label noise ( see section  [ eva_syn ] and  [ sec : exp_sb ] ) . in each boosting trial ,",
    "if some of the sampled nodes are true sybil nodes , then this trial can detect a subset of sybil nodes . due to the robustness to label noise , even if some sampled nodes are actually benign , the propagation of sybil beliefs among the benign region is limited once the number of such sampled nodes is smaller than the number of labeled benign nodes .",
    "thus in our experiments , we limit the number of sampled sybil nodes in the boosting process by the number of labeled benign nodes .",
    "our sybil classification and ranking mechanisms rely on the computation of the posterior distributions given in equation  [ eq_condprobs ] .",
    "generally , there are two major ways to infer such posterior distributions : _ sampling _ and _ variational inference_. we adopt variational inference to learn the posterior distributions since it is more scalable than sampling approaches such as gibbs sampling .",
    "specifically , we adopt loopy belief propagation ( lbp ) to calculate the posterior distributions for each node .",
    "* loopy belief propagation ( lbp )  @xcite : *   the basic step in lbp is to pass messages between neighboring nodes in the system . message @xmath64 sent from @xmath22 to @xmath5 in the @xmath65th iteration is @xmath66 here , @xmath67 is the set of all neighbors of @xmath22 , except the receiver node @xmath5 .",
    "this encodes that each node forwards a product over incoming messages of the last iteration and adapts this message to the respective receiver based on the coupling strength with the receiver .    for social networks without loops ( i.e. , for trees ) ,",
    "lbp is guaranteed to converge and to compute the exact posterior distribution . for networks with loops , lbp approximates the posterior probability distribution without convergence guarantees .",
    "however , in practical applications and benchmarks in the machine learning literature  @xcite , lbp has demonstrated good results and is , today , a widely used technique .",
    "* stopping condition : *   the message passing iterations stop when the changes of messages become negligible ( e.g. , l1 distance of changes becomes smaller than @xmath68 ) or the number of iterations exceeds a predefined threshold .",
    "after stopping , we estimate the posterior probability distribution @xmath69 by @xmath70    * scalability : *   the complexity of one lbp iteration is @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the number of edges .",
    "so the total complexity is @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the number of lbp iterations .",
    "note that social networks are often sparse graphs  @xcite .",
    "thus we have @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the number of nodes .",
    "moreover , we find that setting @xmath74 to be 10 already achieves good results in our experiments .",
    "furthermore , lbp can be easily parallelized .",
    "specifically , we can distribute nodes in the system to multiple processors or computer nodes , each of which collects messages for nodes assigned to them .",
    "we evaluate the influence of various factors including parameter settings in sybilbelief , the number of labels , label sites , label noises , mixing time of the social networks , and scenarios where only labeled benign or sybil nodes are observed , on the performance of sybilbelief .",
    "since these experiments require social networks with various sizes , we will use well - known network generators ( e.g. , erdos - renyi model ( er )  @xcite and the preferential attachment ( pa ) model  @xcite ) to synthesize both the benign region and the sybil region .",
    "we will also study the impacts of different network generators .",
    "furthermore , throughout these experiments , we view sybilbelief as a classification mechanism .    in the basic experimental setup , we adopt the pa model to generate both the benign region and the sybil region with an average degree of 10 , add 500 attack edges between them uniformly at random , and fix the benign region to have 1000 nodes ; we set the sybilbelief model parameters as @xmath44 for any node @xmath5 , and @xmath77 for any edge @xmath26 ; we assume one labeled benign node and one labeled sybil node ; the labeled benign ( sybil ) nodes are uniformly sampled from the benign ( sybil ) network .",
    "when we study the impact of one factor , we fix other factors to be the same as in the basic setup and vary the studied one .",
    "moreover , all of our results reported in the following are averaged over 100 trials .",
    "* impact of network generators : *   we first study the impacts of network generators on the performances of sybilbelief . to this end , we choose the er network generator  @xcite and the pa network generator  @xcite .    for each triple ( benign region , sybil region , attack edges ) setting , we can compute the false negatives and false positives .",
    "figure  [ accepted_sybil ] shows false negatives and positives as a function of the sybil region size .",
    "we find that both false negatives and false positives first increase and then decrease as we increase the sybil region size .",
    "the reason for this sudden decrease phenomenon is that when the sybil region size is bigger than some threshold , the homophily is strong enough so that sybilbelief can easily distinguish between the benign and sybil regions . for a ( benign region , attack edges ) setting , we can search for the maximum false negatives and false positives via increasing the sybil region size .",
    "we denote these maximum false negatives as _ accepted sybil nodes _ and maximum false positives as _ rejected benign nodes _ , which will be used as the metrics to evaluate sybil classification systems .",
    "figure  [ explore_net_model_sybil ] shows the accepted sybil nodes as a function of the number of attack edges while fixing the benign region to be the setting in the basic setup for different network generator combinations .",
    "we find that pa - generated networks have more accepted sybil nodes than er - generated networks .",
    "our findings imply that attackers should generate scale - free networks in order to inject more sybils to the benign region .",
    "the rejected benign nodes are always less than 5 ( i.e. , the false positive rates are smaller than 0.5% since we have 1000 benign nodes ) in these experiments",
    ". we do nt show them due to the limited space .",
    "* impact of label sites : *   in practice , some known labeled nodes might be end points of attack edges while others might be far away from attack edges .",
    "so one natural question is which ones to be selected as the input labels for sybilbelief .",
    "specifically , we consider the following scenarios .    * * si : * labeled benign ( sybil ) nodes are not end points of attack edges . * * sii : * labeled benign ( sybil ) nodes are end points of attack edges .",
    "this could correspond to the scenario where sophisticated attackers obtain knowledge about the labels used in sybilbelief and establish targeted attacks .",
    "figure  [ explore_label_sites_sybil ] shows the accepted sybil nodes as a function of the number of attack edges for the four combinations of the label sites .",
    "we find that the label sites have no influence on the number of accepted sybil nodes .",
    "again , the rejected benign nodes are always less than 5 ( i.e. , the false positive rates are smaller than 0.5% ) , which are not shown due to the limited space .",
    "our results imply that the administrator could simply select benign / sybil nodes uniformly at random as input labels for sybilbelief .",
    "* impact of the model parameters : *   in sybilbelief , there exists one parameter @xmath38 corresponding to the homophily strength of the edge @xmath26 .",
    "we set @xmath78 for all edges , and figure  [ explore_model_par ] illustrates the impact of @xmath79 on the performance of sybilbelief . to demonstrate that our model is independent with @xmath45 for @xmath80 , figure  [ explore_model_par ] also shows the case in which we vary @xmath81 , where @xmath82 for @xmath46 .",
    "we observe that there exists a phase transition point @xmath83 ( e.g. , @xmath84 in these experiments ) for @xmath79 .",
    "when @xmath85 , sybilbelief achieves a good tradeoff between accepted sybil nodes and rejected benign nodes .",
    "* impact of the number of labeled nodes : *   figure  [ explore_label_nodes ] shows the influence of various number of labels on the performance of sybilbelief .",
    "we observe that the number of accepted sybil nodes increases dramatically when the labeled benign and sybil nodes are highly imbalanced , i.e. , their ratio is bigger than 10 or smaller than 0.1 . again , the rejected benign nodes are always less than 5 ( i.e. , the false positive rates are smaller than 0.5% ) , which we do nt show here due to the limited space .",
    "when the ratio is between 0.1 and 10 , the number of accepted sybil nodes is stable across various number of labeled benign nodes .",
    "having more labeled sybil nodes helps sybilbelief accept fewer sybil nodes .",
    "however , these achieved margins are just the more labeled sybils .",
    "so we conclude that sybilbelief only needs one label for each community .",
    "* impact of label noise : *   in practice , we could use a machine learning classifier or crowdsourcing system to obtain labels .",
    "for instance , thomas et al .",
    "@xcite used a classifier to assign labels for twitter accounts .",
    "wang et al .",
    "@xcite proposed to label nodes via a crowdsourcing platform such as amazon mechanical turk .",
    "unfortunately , labels obtained from these approaches often have noise .",
    "for example , labels got from crowdsourcing could have noise up to 35%  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , an adversary could compromise a known benign node , or could get a sybil node whitelisted .",
    "thus , one natural question is how label noise affects sybilbelief s performance .",
    "figure  [ explore_label_noise ] shows the influences of such label noise .",
    "unsurprisingly , we find that sybilbelief accepts more sybil nodes and rejects more benign nodes when a larger fraction of labels are incorrect .",
    "however , with even 49% noise 50% noise makes any algorithm accept infinite number of sybils . ]",
    ", sybilbelief still performs very well , i.e. , sybilbelief with 49% noise only accepts three times more sybil nodes than sybilbelief without noise , and its rejected benign nodes are always less than 3 ( i.e. , the false positive rates are smaller than 0.3% ) .",
    "furthermore , we find that our algorithm can detect the incorrect labels with 100% accuracy",
    ".    * impact of community structure : *   most existing sybil detection mechanisms  @xcite rely on the assumption that the benign region is fast mixing .",
    "however , mohaisen  @xcite showed that many real - world social networks may not be as fast - mixing as was previously thought .",
    "furthermore , viswanath et al .",
    "@xcite showed that the performance of existing sybil detection methods decrease dramatically when the benign region consists of more and more communities ( i.e. , the mixing time is larger and larger ) .",
    "similar to the experiment done by viswanath et al .",
    ", we study the impact of the community structure ( i.e. , the mixing time ) on the performance of sybilbelief .",
    "specifically , for the benign region , we use pa to generate @xmath86 independent communities . for the @xmath87th community , we link it to the previous @xmath88 communities via 10 random edges .",
    "the sybil region is one community generated by pa .",
    "we randomly sample 1 sybil label from the sybil region and 10 benign labels from the benign region such that each community has at least 1 labeled node .",
    "figure  [ mixingtime ] shows the number of accepted sybil nodes as a function of the number of communities in the benign region .",
    "the number of rejected benign nodes is always close to 0 and not shown here due to limited space .",
    "we conclude that sybilbelief is robust to community structure in the benign region .    *",
    "boosting with only labeled benign or sybil nodes : *   if we only observe labeled benign or sybil nodes , we can boost our algorithm by sampling some nodes and treating them as labeled sybil or benign nodes . since only observing labeled benign nodes is symmetric to only observing labeled sybil nodes in the algorithmic perspective , we take the former case as an example to illustrate our boosting strategy .    in these experiments , we assume 100 benign labels",

    "the intersection of random walks is used as a feature by the benign users to validate each other . on the other hand , short random walks from sybil users do not reach all benign users ( due to limited number of attack edges ) , and thus do not intersect with the random walks from benign users .",
