    "the observed anomalies in cno- , nena- and mgal- elements in globular cluster red giants ( see @xcite and @xcite for reviews ) are unexplained in canonical low - mass star evolution theory and indicate effects beyond the standard picture . at least for anomalies in those isotopes participating in the cno - cycle models relying on the assumption of an additional ,",
    "non - standard mixing process inside the stars have been presented , which explain convincingly the observations , including the evolution of the carbon abundance along the rgb , i.e.  with time ( see @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this mixing is supposed to set in after the hydrogen burning shell has reached the composition discontinuity left behind by the first dredge - up on the red giant branch ( rgb ) , i.e. , after the so - called rgb bump ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) where the molecular weight barrier between hydrogen burning shell and envelope is at a minimum .",
    "it is usually described in terms of a diffusion process of certain efficiency and penetration depth . the cno anomalies and their correlations with brightness and metallicity ( which are expected qualitatively from nucleosynthesis arguments in standard models , as discussed by @xcite )",
    "are thus explained by a purely evolutionary picture ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . the physical origin of the mixing process",
    "is believed to be found in differential rotation of the star and the parameters used in some of the presently available calculations have been derived from existing theories ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ) , which are , however , far from being complete .",
    "a similar situation holds for oxygen and sodium , which are found to be anti - correlated in globular cluster red giants ( @xcite ) . and showed that this could result from the mixing of elements participating in the onena - cycle , which operates at higher temperatures than the cno - cycle and therefore requires deeper mixing .",
    "demonstrated how all anomalies of the mentioned elements known at that time can be explained by the deep mixing scenario .",
    "their calculations were done by using canonical red giant models , which evolved along the rgb without any mixing , and performing the mixing and nuclear reactions in a post - processing way . for this approach to be correct",
    "it is necessary that the evolution of the background models is not affected by the mixing process .",
    "in fact , the mixing necessary to reproduce the observed anomalies was always so shallow that only very small amounts of hydrogen / helium were mixed between envelope and shell , even in the case of the o - na - anti - correlation .",
    "this was taken as sufficient justification of the underlying basic assumption .",
    "very similar conclusions were obtained by .    within this approach , one can not investigate the possibility or necessity for even deeper mixing , which would affect the hydrogen / helium structure of the models .",
    "has renewed the interest in such deep mixing by connecting the problem of horizontal branch morphology with that of observed anomalies , as previously suggested by .",
    "if the mixing leads to severe helium enhancement in the envelope , increased luminosities and stellar winds result , such that the star will populate the blue horizontal branch ( hb ) , while it remains a red hb star without the additional mixing .",
    "while did not investigate the effect of helium transport , did not follow the evolution of the participating isotopes to compare with observations . in the present paper",
    ", we therefore attempt to close this gap by computing full evolutionary sequences which include deep diffusive mixing and by investigating abundance anomalies using these self - consistent models as background models .",
    "in particular , we want to answer the question _ how much helium enrichment of the envelope is necessary or allowed to achieve or to keep consistency with observations . _    in sect .  2",
    "we will discuss the nucleosynthesis aspects of the problem and review the observational status of the global o - na anticorrelation , which is a powerful tracer of the transport processes in the red giants . in sect .",

    "indeed , the so - called global oxygen - sodium anticorrelation appears to be a common feature to all the globular clusters in a wide range of metallicity ( -2.5@xmath1[fe / h]@xmath1 - 1 ) , for which detailed abundance analysis of the brightest giants have been carried out ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",

    "[ f : obsano ] summarizes the present observational status concerning the o - na - anticorrelation . but more importantly , this feature , and the dependence of the na enhancement and o depletion on the red giant evolutionary state ( @xcite ; @xcite ) can be explained straightforwardly in the deep mixing scenario ( @xcite ) .",
    "regarding the mg and al anomalies , the situation is very different , and the observed mg - al anticorrelation ( @xcite ) requires a combination of the deep mixing and primordial scenarios ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "_ ad hoc _ assumptions would be needed to obtain the observed @xmath2 mg depletion within the low mass al - rich giants themselves ( @xcite ) .",
    "since a low energy resonance in the @xmath2mg(p,@xmath3al reaction remains undetected ( @xcite ) or even can be excluded ( @xcite ) ,  exotic \" models are required to episodically increase the temperature of the hydrogen - burning shell up to values as high as @xmath4 70 - 85 mk ( while canonical models reach a maximum temperature of only 55 mk ) in order to deplete mg at the expense of @xmath2 mg ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) inside the low mass giants as apparently being the consequence of the results by ( @xcite and @xcite ) for m13 . lately , however , found that mg and al abundance variations in m4 can be explained completely by the idea that the al - enhancement is due to a destruction of the mg - isotopes @xmath5 and @xmath6 ( cf .",

    "[ f : obsano ] ) bears crucial clues on the mixing process .",
    "first , its extension to very low oxygen abundances ( [ o / fe ] @xmath11 ) is entirely due to the contribution of m13 red giants .",
    "it is this `` second parameter '' globular cluster that has the fastest rotating blue horizontal branch ( hb ) stars .",
    "found six stars having @xmath12 . in the same paper red hb stars in m3 ( the cluster forming a classical `` second parameter''-pair with m13 ) have been found to possess smaller projected rotational velocities , from 2 to 20  @xmath13 .",
    "this indicates a relation between rotation and mixing .    concerning this extension along the horizontal axis",
    ", our experience in modelling the global anticorrelation shows that it depends primarily on the mixing rate @xmath14 or , more precisely , on the product `` mixing rate @xmath15 mixing time '' .",
    "we will come back to these arguments in sect .  4 , where our nucleosynthesis predictions in deeply mixed stars will be compared to the observations of [ o / fe ] versus [ na / fe ] .",
    "secondly , the extension of the global anticorrelation along the vertical axis ( @xmath16 [ na / fe ] @xmath17 in all clusters except @xmath0 cen ) tells us mostly about the depth of the additional mixing . in ( @xcite , fig .  4 ) and in ( @xcite , fig .",
    "1 ) it has been shown that on approaching the hydrogen burning shell the na abundance displays two successive rises ( see fig .  [",
    "f : abprof ] ) .",
    "the first rise results from the reaction @xmath18ne(p,@xmath19)@xmath9na , whereas the deeper one is produced in the nena - cycle by the partial consumption of @xmath20ne , which is much more abundant than both @xmath18ne and @xmath9na .",
    "the size of the vertical extension of the global anticorrelation implies that additional mixing , whatever it is , does not penetrate the second step ( rise ) in the na abundance profile where h starts to decrease .",
    "otherwise , observed [ na / fe ] values would be much larger than they are cen show extremely high [ na / fe ] ( up to 1 dex ) , probably indicating a penetration of the mixing to the second rise of na .",
    "this cluster is the only one where some giants exhibit surface enrichment of na produced from both @xmath20ne and @xmath18ne .",
    "it also has one of the bluest horizontal branches ( @xcite ) . ] .",
    "have investigated the dependence of the abundance profiles on metallicity ( and mass ) .",
    "their results confirm our arguments completely . only for stars of near - solar metallicity very deep mixing with significant helium enrichment but without strong sodium enhancement could be possible ( see also fig .  5 of @xcite ) .",
    "however , the clusters under discussion ( e.g.  m13 ) are metal - poor .",
    "let us note in fig .",
    "[ f : obsano ] the different behavior of field stars ( @xcite , @xcite ) . in this population ,",
    "the o - na - anticorrelation is not present ( @xcite ) .",

    "[ f : abprof ] we applied a nucleosynthesis code to a red giant model with surface luminosity @xmath21 from which our nucleosynthesis with additional deep mixing calculations started ( sect .  3 ) .",
    "the considerable growth of the @xmath22al abundance with depth is due to our `` non - standard '' assumption of an enhanced initial abundance of the @xmath5 isotope ( @xmath23 = 1.1 $ ] ) and of the thousandfold enhanced rate of the reaction @xmath24 ( for details see @xcite ) .",
    "these ad hoc modifications were needed to explain the observed al enhancements ( @xcite ) , but have no influence on the results of the present paper . from fig .",
    "[ f : abprof ] , we see immediately that if extra mixing penetrates down to layers , say , at @xmath25 , this will result in an enrichment of the red giant s envelope in n , na and al and in its impoverishment in c , o , and @xmath5 . again , @xmath26 remains unchanged due to the relatively low temperatures reached in such a star .",
    "these results were recently confirmed by in models using the reaction rates recommended by nacre ( @xcite ) .",
    "to produce background models for the nucleosynthesis post - processing we have evolved stellar models under the assumption of additional deep mixing after the rgb bump .",
    "all sequences were started at the same initial model , which consisted of an @xmath27 star of initial composition @xmath28 and @xmath29 , and which had been evolved ( canonically ) up to the luminosity of the bump , i.e. , @xmath30 ( at this point , its mass is @xmath31 ) .",
    "the envelope helium content has increased to 0.256 ( in mass fraction ) due to the first dredge - up .",
    "the input physics of the garching stellar evolution code ( used here ) is up - to - date ( for a summary , see @xcite ) , but atomic diffusion has not been included in the computations .",
    "the additional deep mixing between the convective envelope and some point inside the hydrogen shell has been implemented in the same general line as in our previous papers on this subject , that is , as a diffusive process with parameterized values for the diffusive constant @xmath14 , which is the same for all elements , and for the penetration depth .",
    "the values used for @xmath14 are guided by the results of our earlier papers , and agree with estimates based on rotationally induced mixing theories .",
    "we refer the reader to for details of this approach .",
    "we use the normalized mass coordinate @xmath32 introduced therein , which is 0 at the bottom of the hydrogen shell ( usually , where @xmath33 ) and 1 at the bottom of the convective envelope .",
    "the choice of this mass coordinate allows accurate interpolation between a small number of background models in the nucleosynthesis calculations ( see @xcite for a similar approach ) .",
    "the shell , in this coordinate , is located below @xmath34 . the depth , down to which the diffusive mixing should occur , we denote as @xmath35 . obviously , due to the lack of solid theories , one could also choose , for example , purely geometrical scales to define the penetration depth ( @xcite ) .",
    "contrary to our earlier papers , the criterion for penetration is not determined by a fixed value for @xmath35 chosen before the calculations , but is related to the decrease in hydrogen content within the shell ( relative to the surface or convective envelope abundance @xmath36 ) , expressed as a free parameter @xmath37 .",

    "the burning time at the bottom of the mixed region becomes short enough to lead to `` bottom - burning '' of the envelope .",
    "an extended rgb - phase with luminosities drastically increased above the canonical rgb - tip luminosity of @xmath49 is the result ; the final value being @xmath50 .",

    "however , this we consider to be an artefact , which is easy to understand : since due to the mixing the hydrogen abundance in the envelope is reduced , the critical point down to which mixing should occur , is moving inwards",
    ". therefore layers of even lower hydrogen content are mixed with the envelope , and the critical point moves to even deeper regions . only at the point where the burning time - scale is shorter than the mixing time - scale and",
    "therefore the surface hydrogen content no longer is able to adjust to the burning , this process is stopped .",
    "a way out of this situation is to ensure that the mixing does not lead to a sharp step in the shell s hydrogen profile .",
    "this way , the critical point can be kept within the mixed layers . while the mixing procedure described in appears to follow the straightforward approach ,",
    "sweigart ( private communication , 1999 ) in fact used a more complicated method to keep the hydrogen profile even in the presence of mixing .",

[",
    "f : naoanti2 ] and [ f : naoanti1 ] ) ; therefore the details of the mixing prescription used for the background models are not significant for the nucleosynthesis results . *",
    "the total he enrichment of the convective envelope calculated in the post - processing way agrees very well with the final envelope he abundance obtained in the full evolutionary calculations with additional deep mixing ; * values @xmath116 were obtained only in the two computer runs with the depth @xmath117 , but in these cases additional mixing penetrated so deeply that it resulted in the [ na / fe ] on [ o / fe ] dependences evidently inconsistent with the observations ( dashed curves in figs .",
    "[ f : naoanti1 ] and [ f : naoyl1 ] ) .    a simple inspection of figs .",
    "naoanti2]-[f : naoyl1 ] allows the conclusion that _ the global anticorrelation of [ o / fe ] vs. [ na / fe ] as a whole and especially the [ na / fe ] values in its low oxygen abundance tail certainly rule out any hypothesis about an increase of more than @xmath112 in the envelope he abundance of globular - cluster red giants .",
    "_ a physical reason for this constraint is the above - mentioned inability of additional mixing to penetrate the second na abundance rise lying at @xmath118 as hinted by the observed global anticorrelation . in the starting models",
    "@xmath119 corresponds to @xmath120 and , therefore , the envelope he enrichment is not expected to be much larger than @xmath121 .",
    "if the o - na - anticorrelation observed in many globular cluster red giants is indeed due to a deep mixing process beyond the standard effects taken into account in canonical stellar evolution theory , the question is justified whether this deep mixing might affect the h - he - profile as well . in this case , consequences for the red giant evolution including phases of enhanced luminosities and mass loss could result .",
    "we have , therefore , discussed both the evolutionary and nucleosynthetic effects quantitatively by performing stellar evolution calculations including deep mixing and post - processing nucleosynthesis models ( the latter as we did in our earlier papers @xcite ; @xcite ) .    from arguments depending only on nucleosynthesis we could already infer that for temperature profiles typical of hydrogen - burning shells mixing of appreciable amounts of helium can only be achieved if the second na rise is penetrated . this , however , leads to oxygen and sodium anomalies exceeding those observed ( with the exception of a few stars in @xmath0  cen , a multi - metallicity , untypical cluster ) . in terms of our normalized mass",
    "coordinate ( defined such that @xmath122 at @xmath123 at the bottom of the shell ) this puts an observationally constrained limit for the maximum mixing depth of @xmath124 .",
    "our complete models confirm this argument : helium enrichment in excess of @xmath125 due to deep mixing can be ruled out for those stars with na - o - anomalies as observed in clusters such as m15 , m92 , m3 , and even m13 which presents one of the most extended blue horizontal branch .     and",

    "the details of the surface abundance history along the rgb depend on the details of the deep mixing process and thus on its nature which we did not attempt to specify here .",
    "in particular , the field - to - cluster differences must be understood ( especially the fact that field giants do not present the o - na anticorrelation ( @xcite ) , indicating a deeper and more efficient mixing in their globular cluster counterparts ) and seem to point out a non - negligible impact of environmental effects on the extra mixing efficiency .",
    "however , we can compare the observations with the histories of na and o abundance anomalies predicted by our simple mixing prescriptions in order to get constraints for a solid physical model .",
    "this is done in fig .",
    "[ f : naomv ] , which shows surface abundances for several clusters as a function of brightness , i.e.  progressing evolution . also shown is the theoretical prediction of the five calculations displayed in fig .",
    "[ f : naoanti1 ] .",
    "although the observational data are very few ( the uncertainty in the abundances is of order 0.2 dex ) , and information for stars before or at the bump is available only for m13 , some effects can be recognized , nevertheless .",
    "all clusters show the whole spread of na abundances between the canonical case without extra mixing ( they would lie on a horizontal line ) and that as obtained from the calculations with less deep mixing ( solid lines ) .",
    "as already mentioned , very low o abundances are only found in m13 giants , and the observed spread for this element is a signature of the mixing rate .",
    "for both elements the abundance anomalies are limited to values predicted by models with extra mixing _ not _ penetrating the second @xmath9na rise in the hydrogen shell .",
    "stars with intermediate anomalies we interpret as being due to mixing penetrating less deeply into the hydrogen shell .",
    "they could be reproduced with properly adjusted mixing parameters .    over the small brightness interval for which we have data ( for all the clusters except m13 only the brightest giants are accessible ) ,",
    "no significant abundance evolution is recognizable .",
    "the increase in @xmath127 $ ] at the rgb tip obtained in all calculations labeled @xmath45 is not visible in the observations , which may be taken as indication that the physical reasons ( e.g.  rotation ) for the additional mixing have lost their importance or even vanished .",
    "such a possible time dependence of the extra mixing has not been taken into account in our simple mixing prescriptions , but should result from more physically motivated models .",
    "( we recall that in the carbon evolution could be reproduced with constant mixing parameters , however . )",
    "we will therefore , in a forthcoming paper , use the model by , which includes temporal changes in the diffusion constant due to angular momentum transport .    in our models ,",
    "the largest abundance changes take place at the onset of the additional mixing , i.e. , early on the rgb , after the bump ( around @xmath128 )",
    ". this might be visible in the m13 data .",
    "the low brightness group has normal abundances , but above @xmath129 strong anomalies already appear , reminiscent of the steep increase in the calculations mixing deeper ( dashed lines ) . in the case of na no further enhancement is visible ( the range of values does not varies along the rgb ) , while o seems to get depleted further . in spite of the incomplete data at hand , the abundance anomalies seem to develop rather early and within a narrow brightness range ,",
    "but then do not increase any more .",
    "this general behaviour is consistent with our theoretical predictions  though not exactly reproduced  and again points to not too deep mixing at moderate speed .",
    "the calculations with extreme helium mixing would predict the largest o depletion and na enhancement all along the rgb ; the absence of such stars can therefore not be explained with a selection effect working against the shortest lived stars at the tip of the rgb .",
    "the fact that m13 seems to show anomalies already before the bump has to be taken with care , because we compare here only with one stellar model which has a metallicity almost a factor of 10 smaller than that appropriate for m13 . at that metallicity , the bump would occur about 1  mag earlier ( and our initial model is about 0.2  mag brighter than the end of the bump ) .",
    "we stress the fact that the present observational data do not allow a detailed comparison with the abundance evolution , but only rough qualitative statements .",
    "although fig .",
    "[ f : naomv ] again demonstrates how the abundance evolution depends on the assumption about the additional mixing process , our calculations also show that the nucleosynthesis argument given above is valid for _ all _ mixing descriptions tested and therefore model - independent . from this",
    "we predict that _ red giants exhibiting the observed na - o - anomalies do not have envelopes enriched in helium by much more than @xmath130 , which is comparable to the general uncertainty in our knowledge about the helium abundances in such stars .",
    "_    concerning the brightness reached during the rgb evolution , we showed that for specific mixing prescriptions large excess luminosities can be achieved at the end of the evolution without simultaneous mixing of large amounts of helium .",
    "as the reason we could identify the burning of the outer parts of the hydrogen shell where some h - he - mixing had happened in earlier phases .",
    "these regions become hot enough for significant hydrogen burning on such short time - scales that the deep mixing process is not able to mix the products any longer into the convective envelope .",
    "such models experience very strong mass loss under the assumption of the continuing validity of a reimers - type stellar wind and finish the rgb phase with total masses below @xmath131 and envelope masses of only 10% of this",
    ". they could be candidates for blue hb stars and would link observed abundance anomalies , deep mixing and the second parameter problem , as suggested by and .",
    "they would avoid the problem of overproducing o - na - anomalies as would result from the helium mixing investigated by .    however , we repeat our warning that the details of the evolutionary consequences of deep mixing depend crucially on the mixing process and history . mixing speed and depth",
    "are both important for the amount of helium mixed and for the result of the competing processes `` mixing '' and `` burning '' and their time - scales .",
    "the mixing depth is also linked to the criterion for deep mixing , for which we have investigated several simple recipes .    to conclude",
    ", we need a solid physical picture for the deep mixing process in order to be able to investigate its effect on red giant evolution further .",
    "presently , we can only point out some interesting possibilities  such as the overluminosities  and derive model - independent features , such as our main conclusion that the observed anomalies of oxygen and sodium rule out strong helium enhancement and therefore very deep mixing .",
