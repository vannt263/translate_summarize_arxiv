    "<S> this feature allows us to introduce for these stochastic systems a basis  </S>",

    "<S> we show that in the deterministic limit , corresponding to @xmath1 , the sequence of invariant measures of the noisy systems tends , in the weak sense , to the invariant measure of the deterministic system . </S>",
    "<S> thus by introducing a small additive noise one may approximate transition matrices and invariant measures of deterministic dynamical systems . </S>"
