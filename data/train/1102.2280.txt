    "is there a polynomial time approximation scheme ( ptas ) for computing approximate nash equilibria ?",
    "this has emerged , in the wake of the intractability results for nash equilibria @xcite , as the most central question in equilibrium computation . over the past three years",
    "there has been relatively slow progress towards smaller @xmath3 s @xcite  so slow that it is hard to believe that a ptas is around the corner .",
    "on the other hand , @xcite provide a ptas for the important special case of anonymous games with a bounded number of strategies ( those for which the utilities of the players , although different , depend on the _ number _ of players playing each strategy , not on the _ identities _ of the players that do ) .",
    "this ptas proceeds by discretizing the probabilities in the mixed strategies of the players to multiples of @xmath12 , for appropriate integer @xmath13 , and works even in the generalization in which the players are divided into a bounded number of _ types _ , and utilities depend on how many players _ of each type _ choose each strategy .",
    "in this paper we report significant progress on this important algorithmic problem ; we present several new algorithms , but also the first nontrivial lower bounds .",
    "we start by pointing out two new interesting classes of bimatrix games that have ptas s :    * it was shown in  @xcite that computing a nash equilibrium for the special case of _ sparse games _ , that is , games whose payoff matrices have a bounded number of non - zero entries in each row and column  @xcite , is ppad - complete",
    ". we point out that there is a trivial ptas  in particular , the pair of uniform mixed strategies works .",
    "this is interesting in that this is the first ppad - complete case of a problem that is so approximable .",
    "* we also give a randomized ptas for _ small probability games , _ that is , games that are guaranteed to have nash equilibria with small @xmath14 nonzero probability values , and thus with linear support ( theorem  [ theorem : ptas for large support games ] ) .",
    "it is quite surprising that games with small probability values ( our second special case above ) are easy , since games with _",
    "( bounded from below by a constant ) probability values are also easy .",
    "what probability values are difficult then ?",
    "our next result , a lower bound , seems to suggest _ inverse logarithmic _ probability values are hard ( compare with the quasi - ptas of @xcite , whose equilibria have roughly logarithmic support ) .",
    "to explain our negative result , we first note that both ptas s outlined above ( as well as those for anonymous games discussed later ) are _ oblivious_.",
    "this means that they have access to a fixed set of pairs of mixed strategies , in the generic case by sampling , and they look at the game only to determine whether a sampled pair of strategies constitutes an approximate nash equilibrium .",
    "is there an oblivious ptas for the general nash equilibrium ?",
    "the answer here is a definite `` no ''  in fact , we proved our negative result after we had been working for some time on developing such an algorithm@xmath15 we show that any oblivious algorithm must sample at least @xmath16 pairs in expectation ( theorem  [ thm : no oblivious ptas ] ) . for comparison ,",
    "@xcite s algorithm takes time @xmath17 .",
    "another important class of games for which a ptas was recently discovered is that of _ anonymous games with two strategies _ @xcite .",
    "these are multi - player games , in which the utility of each player depends on the strategy ( 0 or 1 ) played , and the _ number _ of other players playing strategy 1 ( _ not _ their identities ) .",
    "in fact , the ptas works even in the more sophisticated case in which the players are partitioned into types , and the utilities depend on the number of players _ of each type _ playing strategy 1 .",
    "the ptas in @xcite , and the relatively more efficient one in @xcite , both have running times that are exponential in @xmath4 .",
    "they are also oblivious in a sense appropriate for anonymous games , in that they work by sampling an _ unordered _ set of @xmath10 mixed strategies , where @xmath10 is the number of players , and they only look at the game in order to determine if there is an assignment of these strategies to the players that results in an approximate equilibrium .",
    "we prove that any oblivious approximation algorithm , for anonymous games with two strategies and three player types , must sample an exponential  in @xmath4sized collection of unordered sets of mixed strategies  and so our ptas s are near - optimal .    finally , we circumvent this negative result to develop a non - oblivious ptas which finds an @xmath3-approximate nash equilibrium in anonymous games with two strategies and any bounded number of player types in time @xmath18 .",
    "this algorithm is based ( in addition to many other insights and techniques for anonymous games ) on a new result in applied probability which is , we believe , interesting in its own right : suppose that you have two sums of @xmath10 independent bernoulli random variables , which have the same first moment , the same second moment , and so on up to moment @xmath19 .",
    "then the distributions of the two sums have variational distance that vanishes exponentially fast with @xmath19 , regardless of @xmath10 . to turn this theorem into an algorithm , we discretize the mixed strategies of the players using techniques from  @xcite and , in the range of parameters where the algorithm of  @xcite breaks down , we iterate over all possible values of the first @xmath20 moments of the players aggregate behavior ; we then try to identify , via an involved dynamic programming scheme , mixed strategies , implementing the given moments , which correspond to approximate nash equilibria of the game .",
    "our approximation guarantee for sums of independent indicators is rather strong , especially when the number of indicators is small , a regime where berry - essen type bounds provide weaker guarantees and result in slower algorithms  @xcite .",
    "it is quite intriguing that a quasi - polynomial time bound , such as the one we provide in this paper , shows up again in the analysis of algorithms for approximate nash equilibria ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .    as a byproduct of our results",
    "we establish the existence of a sparse ( and efficiently computable ) @xmath3-cover of the set of all possible sums of @xmath10 independent indicators , under the total variation distance .",
    "the size of our cover is @xmath11 .",
    "we discuss this result in section  [ sec : cover ] .      a two - player , or _ bimatrix _ , game @xmath21 is played by two players , the _ row player _ and the _ column player_. each player has a set of @xmath10 _ pure strategies _ , which without loss of generality we assume to be the set @xmath22:=\\{1,\\ldots , n\\}$ ] for both players .",
    "the game is described then by two _ payoff matrices _",
    "@xmath23 , @xmath24 corresponding to the row and column player respectively , so that , if the row player chooses strategy @xmath25 and the column player strategy @xmath26 , the row player gets payoff @xmath27 and the column player @xmath28 . as it is customary in the literature of approximate nash equilibria",
    ", we assume that the matrices are normalized , in that their entries are in @xmath29 $ ] .    the players can play _",
    "mixed strategies _",
    ", that is , probability distributions over their pure strategies which are represented by probability vectors @xmath30 , @xmath31 . if the row player chooses mixed strategy @xmath32 and the column player mixed strategy @xmath33 , then the row player gets expected payoff @xmath34 and the column player expected payoff @xmath35 .",
    "a pair of mixed strategies @xmath36 is a _",
    "nash equilibrium _ of the game @xmath37 iff @xmath32 maximizes @xmath38 among all probability vectors @xmath39 and , simultaneously , @xmath33 maximizes @xmath40 among all @xmath41 .",
    "it is an _ @xmath3-approximate nash equilibrium _",
    "iff @xmath42 , for all @xmath39 , and , simultaneously , @xmath43 , for all @xmath41 . in this paper",
    ", we will use the stronger notion of _ @xmath3-approximately well - supported nash equilibrium _ , or simply _",
    "@xmath3-nash equilibrium_. this is any pair of strategies @xmath36 such that , for all @xmath25 with @xmath44 , @xmath45 , for all @xmath46 , and similarly for @xmath33 .",
    "that is , every strategy @xmath25 in the support of @xmath32 guarantees expected payoff @xmath47 which is within @xmath3 from the optimal response to @xmath33 , and similarly every strategy in the support of @xmath33 is within @xmath3 from the optimal response to @xmath32 .",
    "an _ anonymous game _ is in a sense the dimensional dual of a bimatrix game : there are @xmath10 players , each of which has two strategies , 0 and 1 .",
    "for each player @xmath25 there is a _ utility function _",
    "@xmath48 mapping @xmath49 $ ] to @xmath29 $ ] . intuitively , @xmath50 is the utility of player @xmath25 when s / he plays strategy @xmath51 , and @xmath52 of the remaining players play strategy @xmath9 , while @xmath53 play strategy @xmath54 . in other words ,",
    "the utility of each player depends , in a player - specific way , on the strategy played by the player and the number of other players who play strategy @xmath9  but _ not _ their identities .",
    "the notions of nash equilibrium and @xmath3-nash equilibrium are extended in the natural way to this setting .",
    "briefly , a mixed strategy for the @xmath25-th player is a function @xmath55 $ ] such that @xmath56 .",
    "a set of mixed strategies @xmath57 is then an @xmath3-nash equilibrium if , for every player @xmath25 and every @xmath58 with @xmath59 : @xmath60 , where for the purposes of the expectation @xmath13 is drawn from @xmath61 by flipping @xmath62 coins according to the distributions @xmath63 , and counting the number of @xmath9 s .",
    "a more sophisticated kind of anonymous games divides the players into @xmath64 types , so that the utility of player @xmath25 depends on the strategy played by him / her , and the number of players _ of each type _ who play strategy @xmath9 .",
    "we say that a class of bimatrix games is _ small _ if the sum of all entries of the @xmath23 and @xmath24 matrices is @xmath65 .",
    "one such class of games are the _ @xmath13-sparse _ games  @xcite , in which every row and column of both @xmath23 and @xmath24 have at most @xmath13 non - zero entries .",
    "the following result by chen , deng and teng shows that finding an exact nash equilibrium remains hard for @xmath13-sparse games :    finding a @xmath66-nash equilibrium in @xmath67-sparse normalized bimatrix games with @xmath10 strategies per player is a ppad - complete problem .",
    "in contrast , it is easy to see that there is a ptas for this class :    [ thm : ptas for sparse games ] for any @xmath13 , there is a ptas for the nash equilibrium problem in @xmath13-sparse bimatrix games .",
    "our original proof of this theorem consisted in showing that there always exists an @xmath3-nash equilibrium in which both players of the game use in their mixed strategies probabilities that are integer multiples of @xmath68 .",
    "hence , we can efficiently enumerate over all possible pairs of mixed strategies of this form , as long as @xmath13 is fixed .",
    "shang - hua teng pointed out to us a much simpler algorithm : the pair of uniform mixed strategies is always an @xmath3-nash equilibrium in a sparse game !",
    "the difference with our algorithm is this : the uniform equilibrium gives to both players payoff of at most @xmath69 ; our algorithm can be used instead to approximate the payoffs of the players in the nash equilibrium with the optimal social welfare ( or more generally the nash equilibrium that optimizes some other smooth function of the players payoffs ) .      if all games in a class are guaranteed to have a nash equilibrium @xmath36 , where the nonzero probability values in both @xmath32 and @xmath33 are larger than some constant @xmath70 , then it is trivial to find this equilibrium in time @xmath71 by exhaustive search over all possible supports and linear programming .",
    "but , what if a class of games is known to have _ small _ , say @xmath1 , probability values ? clearly , exhaustive search over supports is not efficient anymore , since those have now linear size .",
    "surprisingly , we show that any such class of games has a ( randomized ) ptas , by exploiting the technique of  @xcite .    [ small probability games ] a bimatrix game",

    "observe that a game of @xmath73-small probabilities has an equilibrium @xmath36 , in which both @xmath32 and @xmath33 have support of size at least @xmath76 .",
    "moreover , there exists a subset of size at least @xmath77 from the support of @xmath32 , all the strategies of which have probability at least @xmath78 , and similarly for @xmath33 ; that is the probability mass of the distributions @xmath32 and @xmath33 spreads non - trivially over a subset of size @xmath2 of the strategies .",
    "hence , small probability games comprise a subclass of _ linear support games _ , games with an equilibrium @xmath36 in which both @xmath32 and @xmath33 assign to a constant fraction @xmath79 of the strategies probability at least @xmath80 , for some constants @xmath81 and @xmath82 . however , this broader class of games is essentially as hard as the general : take any nash equilibrium @xmath36 of a normalized game and define the pair @xmath83 , where @xmath84 and similarly for @xmath41 .",
    "it is not hard to see that the new pair is an @xmath3-nash equilibrium ; still , regardless of what @xmath36 is , both @xmath39 and @xmath41 assign to @xmath79 strategies probability at least @xmath80 , for an appropriate selection of @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",

    "we ensure that @xmath175 is in fact an equilibrium , since for every player the payoff she gets from strategy @xmath54 matches the expected payoff she gets from strategy @xmath9 .",
    "however , enforcing that @xmath175 is also the unique equilibrium is a more challenging task ; and to do this we need to include two other players of their own type : we use these players to ensure that the sum of the mixed stategies of the players of type a matches @xmath178 at equilibrium , so that a player @xmath25 deviating from her prescribed strategy @xmath176 is pushed back towards @xmath176 .",
    "we show how this can be done in appendix  [ appendix : lower bound for anonymous : games with unique equilibria ] .",
    "we also provide guarantees for the @xmath3-nash equilibria of the resulting game .",
    "the construction outlined above enables us to define a family of @xmath179 anonymous games with the property that no two games in the family share an @xmath3-nash equilibrium , even as an unordered set of mixed strategies ( claims  [ claim : lower bound : no two games share an equilibrium ] and [ claim : lower bound : many sets ] ) .",
    "then , by an averaging argument , we can deduce that for any oblivious algorithm there is a game in the ensemble for which the probability of success is at most @xmath180 .",
    "it is important for our construction to work that the anonymous game defined for a given collection of probability values @xmath181 does not deviate too much from the prescribed set of mixed strategies @xmath182 even in an @xmath3-nash equilibrium .",
    "the bound of @xmath179 emerges from a quantification of this deviation as a function of @xmath3 .",
    "the proof of theorem  [ theorem : no subexponential oblivious ptas ] is given in appendix  [ appendix : lower bound for anonymous : proof of the lower bound ] .",
    "we can show an equivalent of theorem  [ theorem : no subexponential oblivious ptas ] for oblivious @xmath3-approximation algorithms for anonymous games with @xmath172-player types and @xmath173 strategies per player .",
    "the details are omitted .",
    "we circumvent the lower bound of the previous section by providing a ptas for anonymous games with running time polynomial in the number of players @xmath10 times a factor of @xmath183 .",
    "the ptas is , of course , non - oblivious , and in fact in the following interesting way : instead of enumerating a fixed set of unordered collections of probability values , we enumerate a fixed set of _ @xmath184-tuples , representing the first @xmath184 moments of these probability values .",
    "_ we can think of the these moments as _ more succinct aggregates _ of mixed strategy profiles than the unordered collections of strategies considered in  @xcite , since several of these collections may share the same moments .",
    "to put the idea into context , let us recall the following theorem .",
    "[ theorem : structural result for approximate equilibria ] for every @xmath185 , there exists some integer @xmath186 such that for any @xmath10-player @xmath172-strategy anonymous game with payoffs in @xmath29 $ ] there is an @xmath3-nash equilibrium such that    1 .   either at most @xmath187 players",
    "randomize , and their mixed strategies are integer multiples of @xmath188 ; [ item in structural result : a few players randomize ] 2 .   or all players who randomize use the same mixed strategy , and this strategy is an integer multiple of @xmath189.[item in structural result : many players randomize ]    this structural result can be turned into an oblivious ptas using max - flow arguments ( see appendix  [ appendix : algorithm from wine ] for details ) . at its heart",
    "the proof of the theorem relies on the following intuitive fact about sums of indicator random variables : _ if two sums of independent indicators have close means and variances , then their total variation distance should be small . _",
    "the way this fact becomes relevant to anonymous games is that , if there are @xmath172 strategies per player , then the mixed strategy of a player can be described by an indicator random variable ; and as it turns out , if we replace one set of indicators by another , the change in payoff that every player will experience is bounded by the total variation distance between the sum of the indicators before and after the change .",
    "nevertheless , the bound obtained by approximating the first two moments of the sum of the nash equilibrium strategies is weak , and the space of unordered sets of probability values that we need to search over becomes exponential in @xmath190 .    to obtain an exponential pruning of the search space , we turn to higher moments of the nash equilibrium .",
    "we show the following theorem , which provides a rather strong quantification of how the total variation distance between two sums of indicators depends on the number of their first moments that are equal .    [",
    "theorem : binomial appx theorem ] let @xmath191^n$ ] and @xmath192^n$ ] be two collections of probability values in @xmath193 $ ] .",
    "let also @xmath194 and @xmath195 be two collections of independent indicators with @xmath196=p_i$ ] and @xmath197=q_i$ ] , for all @xmath96 $ ] .",
    "if for some @xmath198 $ ] the following condition is satisfied : @xmath199 @xmath200    condition @xmath201 considers the power sums of the expectations of the indicator random variables .",
    "using the theory of symmetric polynomials we can show that @xmath201 is equivalent to the following condition on the moments of the sums of the indicators ( for the proof see proposition  [ proposition : variable moments to probability moments ] in appendix  [ appendix : binomial approximation theorem ] ) : @xmath202 = \\e\\left[\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n y_i\\right)^{\\ell}\\right],~\\text{for all } \\ell \\in [ d].\\ ] ] theorem  [ theorem : binomial appx theorem ] provides then the following strong approximation guarantee for sums of indicator random variables , that we think should be important in other settings .",
    "our result is related to the classical moment method in probability theory  @xcite , but to our knowledge it is novel and significantly stronger than known results :    _ if two sums of independent indicators with expectations bounded by 1/2 have equal first @xmath19 moments , then their total variation distance is @xmath203 .",
    "_    it is important to note that our bound in   does not rely on summing up a large number of indicators @xmath10 .",
    "this is quite critical since the previous techniques break down for small @xmath10s  for large @xmath10 s berry - essen type bounds are sufficient to obtain strong guarantees ( this is the heart of the probabilistic results used in  @xcite ) .    the proof of theorem  [ theorem : binomial appx theorem ] ( and its complement for probability values in @xmath204 ) is given in appendix  [ appendix : binomial approximation theorem ] .",
    "it proceeds by expressing the distribution of the sum of @xmath10 indicators , with expectations @xmath205 , as a weighted sum of the binomial distribution @xmath206 ( with @xmath207 ) and its @xmath10 derivatives with respect to @xmath208 , at the value @xmath209 ( these derivatives correspond to finite signed measures ) .",
    "it turns out that the coefficients of the first @xmath19 terms of this expansion are symmetric polynomials with respect to the probability values @xmath205 , of degree at most @xmath19 ; hence , from the theory of symmetric polynomials , each of these coefficients can be written as a function of the power - sum symmetric polynomials @xmath210 , @xmath211  ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "so , if two sums of indicators satisfy condition  @xmath201 , the first terms cancel , and the total variation distance of the two sums depends only on the other terms of the expansion ( those corresponding to higher derivatives of the binomial distribution ) . the proof is concluded by showing that the joint contribution of these terms is inverse polynomial in @xmath212",
    "( the details are given in appendix  [ appendix : binomial approximation theorem ] ) .",
