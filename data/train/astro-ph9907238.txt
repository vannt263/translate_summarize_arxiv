    "as in previous papers of this series we use the 1995 version of the compilation by andernach & tago ( @xcite ) of all published galaxy redshifts towards galaxy clusters in the catalogue of rich clusters of galaxies by abell ( @xcite ) and abell et al .",

    "the three - dimensional distribution of all abell and apm clusters in rich superclusters in the whole space within a limiting radius 350  around us is shown in the home page of tartu observatory ( http://www.aai.ee ) .    for comparison we plot in fig .  1 also the distribution of apm clusters of galaxies in rich superclusters .",
    "we see that the apm cluster sample covers a much smaller volume in space which makes it difficult to investigate the regularity of the distribution of high - density regions on large scales .",
    "the apm cluster sample is defined only in the southern galactic hemisphere , and even here the apm sample containing clusters with measured redshifts covers only three high - density regions defined by very rich superclusters with at least 8 member - clusters .",

    "pisces - cetus ( sc10 ) , and horologium - reticulum ( sc48 ) superclusters of the catalogue in paper i. to investigate the regularity of the supercluster - void network , the sample volume must exceed the period of the network at least several times .",
    "for this reason we used in the following analysis only abell clusters .",
    "to investigate the regularity of the distribution of clusters of galaxies we shall use a novel geometric method .",
    "the idea of the method is taken from the periodicity analysis of time series of variable stars . to derive the period of a variable star",
    "the time series of brightness measurements is folded using a certain trial period , i.e. individual measurements are stacked to yield a combined light curve for a single period . if the trial period is wrong then the distribution of data - points in the combined curve is almost random .",
    "in contrast , if the trial period is correct and the star under study is a periodic variable , then one has a clear mean light curve of the star .",
    "this method has been generalised to the 3-dimensional case by toomet ( @xcite ) .",
    "the whole space under study is divided into trial cells of side length @xmath17 .",
    "then all objects in the individual cubical cells are stacked to a single combined cell , preserving their phases in the original trial cells .",
    "we then vary the side length of the trial cube to search for the periodicity of the cluster distribution .",
    "the method can be used for any form of tightly packed regular trial cells .",
    "we use cubical trial cells which have the simplest possible form , and because this form gives a satisfactory explanation of the distribution of clusters .",
    "[ fig3 ]    [ fig4 ]    the next step is to calculate the _ goodness of regularity _ for this side length @xmath17 of the trial cell . to do this we divide the combined stacked cell into small elementary sub - cells and count , for a particular data point ( i.e.  cluster of galaxies ) within this sub - cell , the number of _ other _ data points which come from an original trial cell _ different _ from the one in which the given data point is located .",
    "the _ goodness of regularity _ is calculated as follows : @xmath18 here @xmath19 is the total number of data points , i.e.  individual abell clusters ; @xmath20 is the volume of the trial cell of side length @xmath17 ; @xmath21 is the phase - vector of the cluster @xmath22 in the combined cell ( a spatial remainder - vector , the components of which are remainders , which arise if the original coordinates are divided by @xmath17 ) ; @xmath23 is the elementary volume inside of the combined cell .",
    "we use an elementary cube ( sub - cell ) of side length @xmath24 .",
    "the counter @xmath25 is defined as follows : @xmath26 , if the phase vector of the cluster @xmath27 lies in the elementary volume @xmath23 ( the centre of which coincides with @xmath21 ) , and if clusters @xmath22 and @xmath27 are located farther away from each other than @xmath28 .",
    "otherwise we set @xmath29 .",
    "thus @xmath30 is unity only if the phases of clusters are close enough in the combined cube , but the clusters themselves are not members of the same supercluster ( they lie in different trial cubes of the original space ) .    the sensitivity of the method and the rms error of the variable @xmath31 have been determined using mock samples of randomly and quasi - regularly located points .",
    "we use mock samples with two populations of clusters , in one population all clusters are randomly distributed , in the second population they are located in superclusters which form a regular rectangular network with a step 130  .",
    "supercluster centre positions have random shifts @xmath32  around corners of the regular network .",
    "mock samples are described in more detail in paper iii . here",
    "we are interested in the cosmic error due to variance of @xmath31 in different realizations of the sample .",
    "this relative error can be expressed as @xmath33 , where @xmath19 is the number of clusters in the sample , and @xmath34 is a constant determined from the analysis of mock samples .",
    "the dependence of the error on @xmath17 comes from the fact , that , if @xmath35 , then trial cells have the same size as elementary sub - cells .",
    "thus all clusters of the trial cell are located in the elementary sub - cell and there is no variance of @xmath31 between different realizations ; for larger trial cell size @xmath17 the error increases .",
    "the presence of a periodicity in the sample can be determined with confidence if the amplitude of the goodness near the maximum deviates from the poisson value @xmath36 by more than @xmath37 .",
    "results of the analysis of mock samples are illustrated in figure  3 .",
    "we see in the right panel that the goodness curve has well defined maxima at integer multiples of @xmath38 . in the mock sample shown in the left panel",
    "the fraction of clusters located in regular network is smaller and the amplitude of the maximum lies within the @xmath37 error corridor .",
    "this example shows that the period of a regular network of points can be determined if the population of regularly distributed points is sufficiently large ( at least 10  % of the total number of points ) and if the total number of particles is at least several hundred .",
    "obviously , the method is sensitive to the direction of the axes of the trial cubes .",
    "if clusters form a quasi - rectangular cellular network , and the search cube is oriented along the main axis of the network , then the period is found to be equal to the side length of the cell .",
    "if the search cube is oriented at some non - zero angle @xmath39 with respect to the major axis of the network , then the presence of a periodicity and the period depend on the angle . if the angle @xmath40 , then the period is equal to the length of the diagonal of the cell .",
    "if the angle differs considerably from @xmath41 and @xmath42 , the periodicity is weak or absent .",
    "this property is also illustrated in figures 3 and 4 for mock and real cluster samples , respectively .",
    "results of the period analysis of our cluster sample are shown in figure  4 .",
    "the axes of the search cubes were oriented at various angles with the coordinate axes of the supergalactic coordinate system .",
    "as seen from these figures , the period really depends on the orientation .",
    "the smallest value of the period , @xmath43 , occurs when the cubes are oriented along supergalactic coordinates . if the trial cube is oriented at @xmath44 with respect to supergalactic coordinates , then the period is @xmath45 , as expected for a rectangular network of cells . in both cases there",
    "exist a second maximum of the curve of goodness of regularity at @xmath46  which is also well pronounced .",
    "if the trial cube is oriented at @xmath47 , then the periodicity is much weaker , the first maximum at @xmath48  has a lower amplitude , and the second is absent . in principle",
    "there are more possibilities , for instance when the trial cells are oriented along the diagonal of the cubical lattice .",
    "however , in most additional cases the periodicity is weaker .",
    "probably this can be due to the fact the the regularity is not very strong and there exist deviations from it .",
    "much larger samples are needed to find limits of the regularity .",
    "the periodicity analysis confirms the analysis made in papers i and ii using other methods .",
    "the cluster sample has a considerable fraction of clusters located in rich superclusters which form a rectangular lattice with a period of about @xmath49  .",
    "our analysis shows that the supercluster - void network is oriented approximately along supergalactic coordinates .",
    "this confirms earlier results on the presence of a high concentration of clusters and superclusters towards both the supergalactic plane ( tully et al .",
    "@xcite ) , and towards the dominant supercluster plane , which are at right angles with respect to each other ( paper  i ) .",
    "supergalactic @xmath50 axis is very close to the direction of galactic poles , thus it is natural to expect a well - defined periodicity along galactic poles as indeed observed by broadhurst et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "the rectangular character of the distribution of rich clusters was also noticed by tully et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "recently battaner ( @xcite ) has found that many known superclusters can be identified with the vertices of a octahedron network of the superstructure .",
    "one principal result of our study is the direction dependence of the periodicity .",
    "this conclusion was not possible with the power spectrum or correlation function approach since they are not sensitive to directional information .",
    "a clear periodicity is observed only along supergalactic coordinates .",
    "this is in good agreement with results by broadhurst et al .",
    "( @xcite ) where a periodicity was observed in the direction of galactic poles , i.e.  almost exactly along the supergalactic @xmath50 axis ( supergalactic @xmath51 and @xmath52 axes lie close to the galactic plane where clusters are invisible ) . in other directions",
    "the regularity is less pronounced ( guzzo et al .",
    "@xcite , willmer et al .",
    "@xcite , ettori et al .",
    "@xcite ) . as noted already by bahcall ( @xcite ) , the nearest peaks of the broadhurst et al .",
    "survey coincide in position and redshift with nearby rich superclusters .",
    "thin deep slices , such as slices of the lcrs and the century survey , also show a weak periodicity signal ( landy et al .",
    "@xcite , geller et al .",
    "the scale length found in these studies is of the same order as derived in the present paper .",
    "the regularity found in this paper concerns high - density regions marked by clusters in rich superclusters .",
    "when we compare the distribution of galaxies in various regions of the supercluster - void network we see considerable individual differences . on small scales",
    "the distribution of galaxies and clusters is fractal , as shown by many studies ( see wu et al .",
    "@xcite ) ; and is well reproduced by models with randomly distributed density perturbations ( see feldman et al .",
    "@xcite ) . on very large scales covering the whole volume of the abell cluster sample we see in the distribution of clusters in extremely rich superclusters with @xmath53 members",
    "no regularity .",
    "we come to the conclusion that a clear regularity is observed only near the wavelength @xmath54  of the peak of the power spectrum .",
    "this result can be expressed as follows : density perturbations on very small ( @xmath55 ) and very large wavelengths ( @xmath56 ) are uncorrelated and have random phases ; however , near the wavelength @xmath57 they are correlated and have similar phases .",
    "the importance of the use of phase information was stressed by szalay ( @xcite ) .",
    "the regularity of the large - scale structure of the universe has been studied also using the distribution of centres of superclusters ( kalinkov et al .",
    "@xcite , kerscher @xcite ) .",
    "kalinkov et al .",
    "searched for the presence of a high - order clustering of superclusters using the correlation analysis , and found that superclusters are not clustered .",
    "our analysis in papers i and ii and presented here suggests that the regularity is completely different : it consists of the presence of the supercluster - void network , not the clustering of superclusters ( like galaxies concentrate to clusters ) .",
    "the supercluster - void regularity is expressed by the distribution of clusters themselves , not supercluster centres .",
    "kerscher used a combination of the nearest neighbour distribution and the void probability function to measure the regularity of the structure .",
    "this method works well for small separations between superclusters ( @xmath58  ) , and yields results in good agreement with paper i. however , the method does not characterise the supercluster - void network on larger scales .",
    "it should be emphasized that this inhomogeneity in the universe does not contradict the observed degree of isotropy of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation .",
    "as follows from general expressions for _ rms _ values of multipoles @xmath59 of cmb angular temperature anisotropies ( see , e.g. , starobinsky @xcite ) , any additional localized excess of power in the fourier spectrum of density perturbations introduced at a scale @xmath60 affects only multipoles @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the present horizon radius .",
    "this is valid for both gaussian and non - gaussian additional perturbations ( assuming only that there is no correlation between perturbations with @xmath63 and perturbations from the other , `` regular '' part of the spectrum ) .",
    "moreover , multipoles with @xmath64 are mainly amplified . for the pure cdm cosmological model with @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 mainly the first acoustic peak",
    "is enhanced ( atrio - barandela et al .",
    "@xcite ; eisenstein et al .",
    "@xcite ; broadhurst & jaffe @xcite ) .",
    "however , in the @xmath11cdm model ( which is strongly supported by numerous recent observational data ) this enhancement shifts to larger values of @xmath68 . in particular , if @xmath69 , then @xmath70 , and @xmath71 . for this model ,",
    "the effect discussed in this paper mainly results in an increase of @xmath59 in the valley between the first and second acoustic peaks of the cmb temperature anisotropy spectrum .",
    "in particular , the amplitude @xmath72 for @xmath73 will be @xmath74 , in agreement with recent cat2 data ( baker et al .",
    "@xcite ) , as well as with previous cat1 results ( scott et al .",
    "a more detailed treatment of resulting cmb anisotropies in the presence of a cosmological constant will be presented in a separate paper .",
    "the main conclusion we can draw from our study is that the universe is not homogeneous and fully isotropic on scales @xmath75  .",
    "high - density regions in the universe form a quasi - rectangular lattice .",
    "the distribution of high - density regions depends on the direction : along the main axis ( coinciding with the supergalactic @xmath50 axis ) of the cellular system the regularity is well pronounced and has a period of @xmath49  , while in other directions the distribution is less regular .",
