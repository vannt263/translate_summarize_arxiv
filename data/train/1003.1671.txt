    "superconducting quantum circuits possess discrete energy - levels and behave like natural atoms that the transitions between different energy levels can be induced by the electromagnetic fields .",

    "in contrast to natural atoms , the potential wells of superconducting flux qubit ( sfq ) circuits can be changed by adjusting externally applied magnetic fields , this tunability makes the sfq circuits have many features which can not be shown by the nature atoms .    in natural atoms , since the inversion symmetry of the potential energy is given by the nature and can not be changed artificially .",
    "thus each eigenstate has well - defined parity and the electric - dipole transitions can only link two eigenstates which have different parities .",
    "however , the inversion symmetry of the potential energy for the sfq circuits can be controlled by the external magnetic flux . when the inversion symmetry is adjusted to be broken",
    ", there is no well - defined parity for each eigenstate of the multi - level sfq circuits , and the microwave induced transitions between any two energy levels are possible , thus the multi - photon and single - photon processes can coexist for such multi - level systems .",
    "this coexistence of the multi - photon processes can be easily understood by virtue of an example using three - level sfq circuits .",
    "that is , the transition between the ground state and the second excited state can be realized via two different pathes : ( i ) from the ground to the second excited states via a single - photon process ; or ( ii ) from the ground state to the first excited state via a single - photon , and then from the first excited state to the second excited state via another single - photon process  @xcite .",
    "this means that the single- and two - photon processes can realize the same goal : the transition from the ground to the second excited states , and thus single- and two - photon processes can coexist in such system .",
    "the coexistence  @xcite of the single- and two - photon processes in the three - level sfq circuits with the cyclic transition , which is also called as @xmath0-type transition in analogue to the @xmath1- , @xmath2- , and @xmath3-type transitions in atomic physics or quantum optics  @xcite , has been experimentally demonstrated via a delicate superconducting qubit - resonator circuit  @xcite .",

    "however , in contrast to the ref .",

    "we assume that the sfq frequency @xmath146 is near at the frequency @xmath147 , then other fast oscillating terms can be neglected . in the rotating reference frame @xmath148 and using the dressed sfq basis , eq .",

    "is switched off , neither single - photon process nor two - photon process can be observed in the driven sfq .",
    "this is an additional condition to obtain the coexistence of the single- and two - photon processes in the driven sfq  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the ratio between the longitudinal coupling constant @xmath79 and the frequency @xmath80 of the driving field determines the coexistence and disappearance of the single- and two - photon processes .",
    "( iii ) due to the coexistence of the single- and two - photon processes in the case of the transverse and longitudinal couplings , the preparation and the engineering the quantum states of the harmonic oscillator can be more efficient .",
    "( iv ) as the closing remark of this section , we also note that the dynamics of the sfq and the lc oscillator in the dispersive regime beyond the rotating - wave approximation has been studied in ref .",
    "this method can also be applied to our studies here .",
    "in summary , as the necessary complementary and generalization of our earlier studies  @xcite , we first study physically reasonable phase transformations when the time - dependent microwave is applied , and then study the microwave induced transitions between different energy levels in the multi - level systems formed by the sfq circuits .",
    "we have compared the selection rules between these artificial superconducting  atoms \" and the natural atoms .",
    "it is found that the selection rules for such multi - level systems are the same as those of the multi - level natural atoms when the reduced bias magnetic flux @xmath45 , applied to the superconducting loop of the sfq circuits , is at the optimal point @xmath71 .",
    "this is because the symmetry of the potential energy is well defined in this case .",
    "however , when the reduced bias magnetic flux is not at optimal point , i.e. , @xmath130 , the superconducting  atoms \" have no selection rules , in this case , the microwave induced transitions between any two energy levels are possible .",
    "the inversion symmetry of the potential energy for the sfq circuits is not only important to the multi - level systems , but also important to the two - level systems ( qubits ) . with the broken inversion symmetry",
    ", there are both the transverse and longitudinal couplings between the sfqs and the external magnetic fluxes . comparing with the two - level atoms that only have the transverse coupling",
    ", the longitudinal coupling can induce several new results .",
    "for example , in the two - level natural atoms , the multiphoton processes can not coexist due to the well - defined parities of the eigenstates , however , in the sfqs , the longitudinal coupling can induce coexistence of the multiphoton processes .",
    "we also demonstrate that the longitudinal coupling can result in : ( i ) the transparency of the sfq to the transverse coupling field ; ( ii ) the dynamical quantum zeno effect .",
    "we further study the coupling between the driven sfq and the lc circuit with the low frequency .",
    "we show that the longitudinal coupling can result in the coexistence of the single- and two - photon processes in contrast to only single - photon process for the case that the longitudinal coupling is zero .",
    "we also obtain the conditions that the single- and two - photon processes can disappear even there is longitudinal coupling .",
    "we hope that all of these phenomena can be experimentally demonstrated in the near future by using two - level superconducting quantum circuits .    finally",
    ", we remark : ( i ) all these results for the sfqs can also be generalized to the superconducting phase  @xcite and charge  @xcite qubit circuits , because all these qubits have the same hamiltonians as in eq .",
    "( [ eq:5 ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq:29 ] ) when the qubits are not at optimal point . here",

    "( ii ) the study on transverse and longitudinal couplings between the superconducting qubit and the lc circuit in the resonant or near - resonant case have been studied , e.g. , in ref .",
