    "it is known that the modification of the spectrum of the fermi field due to its coupling to other field configurations influences many properties of the system and causes many interesting phenomena .",
    "one of these phenomena is the appearance of nonzero and even noninteger fermion number of the vacuum .",
    "the occurrence of the fractional fermion number was first pointed out by jackiw and rebbi in @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "they considered some models possessing the charge conjugation symmetry , in which the fermion is coupled to a scalar background field in the form of a soliton .",
    "they concluded that the existence of an isolated nondegenerate zero - energy fermionic mode implies that the soliton is a degenerate doublet carrying fermion number @xmath5 .",
    "their surprising result has motivated much of the works on this subject .",
    "this effect has been studied extensively in the literature for different physical models in many branches of physics such as particle physics @xcite , cosmology @xcite , condensed - matter physics @xcite , polymer physics @xcite and atomic physics @xcite .    in the early 80s two systematic and elegant methods",
    "were developed as a way to evaluate the vacuum polarization of the fermions induced by the presence of prescribed static background fields .",
    "the first method called the adiabatic method , invented by goldstone and wilczek @xcite , basically consists of building up adiabatically the final configuration of the background field starting from the free vacuum .",
    "then , the charge of the final state can be obtained by observing the fermionic current at spatial infinity , computed from the lowest order feynman loop diagram .",
    "this method is limited to the slowly varying background fields . for",
    "infinitely slow variations of the background , none of the bound states of the fermion crosses the line of @xmath1 .",
    "consequently , there exists only one contribution to the vacuum polarization , i.e.the adiabatic contribution .",
    "this contribution can be attributed to the change in the number of continuum states with negative energy and is responsible for the fractional part of the fermion number .",
    "the second method was invented by mackenzie and wilczek @xcite , and the restriction of adiabaticity is lifted . to calculate the charge of the no particle state in the presence of an interaction ,",
    "one starts with the definition of the particle number operator in the free dirac case and transforms it into the one which is appropriate for the basis of states in the presence of the interaction .",
    "then , the vacuum charge turns out to be equal to the difference between the number of negative energy states in the presence and absence of the background field .",
    "one can then return back to the first quantized level and solve for the spectrum of the dirac field in the presence of the background field . as we couple the dirac field to an external potential ,",
    "the dirac equation is altered and the spectrum of the fermion is distorted . the positive and negative continua change and",
    "bound states may appear .",
    "when the scale of spatial variation of the background field is much larger than the compton wavelength of the fermion ( @xmath6 ) , i.e.the adiabatic regime , the results of the two methods coincide .",
    "however , when the aforementioned scale becomes comparable to or smaller than @xmath6 , the bound state energy levels could cross the @xmath1 line , and the definition of the vacuum changes .",
    "this contribution to the vacuum polarization is called the nonadiabatic contribution . in this sense",
    "the second method generalizes the first .",
    "in this paper we concentrate on the simple but important model considered by jackiw and rebbi . in this model a fermi field is coupled to an external scalar field in the form of kink in @xmath0 dimensions .",
    "this system has charge conjugation and particle conjugation symmetries .",
    "these symmetries relate each state of the fermion with positive energy @xmath7 to a state with the energy @xmath8 .",
    "therefore , the whole spectrum of the system is completely symmetric with respect to the line of @xmath1 .",
    "jackiw and rebbi stated that there is an isolated zero - energy fermionic mode in this system , which is self charge conjugate and showed that the vacuum polarization of the system due to the presence of this mode is @xmath9 .",
    "they have obtained the exact form of the zero mode @xcite . before these works ,",
    "the same model had been discussed by dashen _",
    "_ in @xmath10 @xcite in a different context and with a different purpose . in that paper",
    ", they extended the semiclassical method to include fermions .",
    "they also pointed out the existence of the zero - energy fermionic mode and obtained an expression for the discrete bound levels .",
    "later on rajaraman gave the same expression for the bound state energies of the jackiw - rebbi model while reviewing the previous works @xcite .",
    "however , as far as we know , exact solution for the whole spectrum of this model , which was introduced four decades ago has been heretofore missing . in this paper",
    "we calculate the exact spectrum of the system , i.e.the eigenstates in the continua and all of the bound eigenstates and their energies , for the whole allowed ranges of the parameters , i.e.@xmath2 which denotes the value of the kink at @xmath11 and @xmath3 the slope at @xmath12 .",
    "having such solutions , we can explore what exactly happens to the spectrum of the fermion as the background field evolves from the trivial vacuum to the kink . from this evolution perspective",
    ", the origin of an isolated zero mode in a system with particle conjugation symmetry has been a mystery to us .",
    "the symmetries of the system clearly mandate the zero mode to be self charge conjugate , but disallow any levels crossing @xmath1 during the evolution process , and this obfuscates the mystery even further .",
    "when this analysis illuminates the origin of this zero mode , some of its unexpected features become manifest . to this end",
    ", we obtain the bound states of the fermion for this system using two different analytical methods . in the first method we solve the equations of motion , directly .",
    "our second method is the elegant shape invariance method @xcite .",
    "shape invariance indicates the presence of an integrability condition for the potential of the schrdinger - like equations .",
    "when such a condition is satisfied for the potential , one can use the supersymmetry algebra to exactly solve the schrdinger - like equation and obtain the stationary states and their corresponding energy eigenvalues .",
    "our second order equations , obtained by decoupling the two first order equations embedded in the dirac equation , turn out to be two schrdinger - like equations which are surprisingly partner hamiltonians and related to each other through a shape invariance condition .",
    "therefore , we are able to easily obtain the solutions for our bound states using the shape invariance method .",
    "we plot the bound state energies of the fermion as a function of @xmath2 .",
    "the invariance of the system under the charge and particle conjugation symmetries is obvious in this graph .",
    "we also obtain the continuum scattering states of the fermion by solving the equations of motion directly , and then calculate the phase shift of these states .",
    "one of our observations is that there is a dynamical mass generation process operating at the first quantized level .",
    "we check the consistency of our results with both the weak and strong forms of the levinson theorem @xcite , and use those two forms to gain further insight into the fermionic spectrum .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "@xmath13 we introduce the model . in section",
    "@xmath14 we obtain the bound states of the fermion using two different methods . in section",
    "@xmath15 we compute the continuum wave functions of the fermion and then calculate the phase shift of these states .",
    "then , we check the consistency of our results with both the weak and strong forms of the levinson theorem . in section 5",
    "we summarize and discuss the results and draw some conclusions .",
    "in this section we review the basic definitions of the @xmath0-dimensional model studied by jackiw and rebbi @xcite .",
    "this model includes a spinor field @xmath16 coupled to a scalar field @xmath17 through the following lagrangian @xmath18\\psi,\\ ] ] where @xmath19 and @xmath20 is a prescribed pseudoscalar field and chosen to be the kink of the @xmath21 theory , i.e.@xmath22 . two important parameters which describe",
    "the kink are @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "notice that the lagrangian has no explicit fermion mass term and the mass of the free fermion is obviously zero .",
    "however , as we shall show , the interaction term of this lagrangian gives the mass @xmath25 to the fermion , to lowest order .",
    "we use the representation @xmath26 and @xmath27 for the dirac matrices and represent the fermi field by @xmath28 .",
    "then , the dirac equation in the presence of the background field @xmath20 can be written as follows @xmath29 our purpose is to solve this equation exactly and explore the results in detail . before doing that , we state some important symmetries of this model .",
    "it possesses the charge conjugation symmetry . in our representation",
    "the charge conjugation operator includes @xmath30 and it relates the states with positive energy to the ones with negative energy as @xmath31 .",
    "also , if there is a zero - energy fermionic mode , it is self conjugate , i.e.@xmath32 .",
    "this model also possesses particle conjugation symmetry . in our representation",
    "the particle conjugation operation is given by @xmath33 .",
    "therefore , for every state with positive energy @xmath7 there exists a corresponding state with energy @xmath8 .",
    "the chosen model is not invariant under the parity , since the background field @xmath20 is the kink which is an odd function in space .",
    "therefore , this model does not preserve the cp and consequently it is not invariant under the time reversal .",
    "in this section we solve eq.([eom ] ) to find the wave functions of the bound states along with their associated discrete energies .",
    "first , we solve the equations of motion directly .",
    "then , we solve the equations using the formalism of shape invariance , as a double check . for an alternative derivation of the bound states see @xcite .",
    "equation ( [ eom ] ) consists of two coupled first order differential equations .",
    "we first solve the two decoupled second order equations and then look for a set of solutions which are consistent with the original dirac eq.([eom ] ) .",
    "the decoupled equations are as follows @xmath34\\psi^{(\\pm)}(x')=0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have rescaled the original parameters of the model as follows : @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "we have also defined two new parameters as follows : @xmath38 and @xmath39 . the solutions to these two schrdinger - like equations can be inferred from some old literature @xcite .",
    "however , we present a very short derivation of the solutions , which we shall later combine to obtain the solution to the original dirac equation . when @xmath40 , these equations have solutions vanishing at spatial infinities and consequently for this range of parameters we can have bound states",
    ". however , for @xmath41 the continuum solutions which are oscillatory at spatial infinities are possible . to solve these equations",

    "however , since @xmath49 , @xmath51 and we have to set @xmath52 . in order that the remaining solution have the proper asymptotic behavior , we have to impose the following constraint @xmath53 where @xmath54 is a semi - positive integer .",
    "this constraint along with the constraint @xmath45 determine the allowed discrete energies of the system .",
    "using these two constraints , and the definitions of @xmath55 and @xmath56 , the allowed energies in terms of the original parameters @xmath2 and @xmath3 are as follows @xmath57 we have reverted to the original parameterization since it is necessary for explaining the origin of the zero mode .",
    "the upper bounds for the integer @xmath54 have been obtained using the constraint @xmath49 .",

    "we use the shape invariance method to re - derive the bound state sector of this model .",
    "since there are many excellent reviews on the shape invariance method ( see for example @xcite ) , we shall only use the results , with minimal introduction . consider a sequence of hamiltonians which are related to each other by the shape invariance condition , @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the number of bound states of @xmath75 , @xmath76 is a c - function depending on the parameters of the hamiltonians , and @xmath77 .",

    "using these two functions and eq.([spectrumh1 ] ) , the energies of the bound states of @xmath87 are as follows @xmath93 substituting eqs.([zeromode ] ) and ( [ aadag2 ] ) into eq.([waveh1 ] ) , the bound state wave functions of the hamiltonian @xmath87 can be easily obtained .",

    "now , we focus our attention on obtaining the continuum scattering states for this model . as in the case of bound states ,",
    "we choose the continuum wave functions to be in the form of @xmath96 . from the constraint @xmath97",

    "we can easily obtain the scattering phase shift for this model .",
    "having obtained the phase shifts , we can use the strong form of the levinson theorem for a double check on our calculations and the weak form of the levinson theorem as a counter for the bound states .",

    "we first find the phase shift for the scattering process embedded in eqs.([scatt]-[asymp2 ] ) . to this end",
    ", we divide the coefficient of the transmitted wave by the coefficient of the incident wave and obtain the scattering matrix element which is related to the phase shift by the relation @xmath117 . using eq.([asymp ] ) or ( [ asymp2 ] ) , the scattering matrix element of the fermion is as follows @xmath118 where as before @xmath119 signs refer to the upper and lower components of the continuum wave function of the fermion . as it can be seen , the @xmath120 matrix is ambiguous and the upper and lower components of the fermion wave function have different phase shifts .",
    "we define the phase shift of the state to be the average of the phase shifts of the two components of the fermion wave function @xcite .",
    "we shall show that this phase shift has all of the expected properties .",
    "also , notice that the @xmath120 matrix of our model and consequently the phase shifts of the fermion wave function are independent of the sign of the fermion energy , due to the symmetries of the system .",
    "therefore , the phase shifts of the states in the dirac sea and sky with the same value of @xmath121 are the same",
    ".    let us plot some examples of the phase shift of the fermion and explore them in connection with the levinson theorem .",
    "we concentrate on the case with the parameters @xmath122 and @xmath123 as the value of @xmath2 is increased from zero .",
    "it is important to investigate the change in the values of the phase shifts at the boundaries of the continua , i.e.@xmath124 and @xmath125 , when bound states appear . in the left graph of fig.[phaseshift ]",
    "we show the phase shifts as a function of @xmath83 for @xmath126 .",
    "we draw the phase shifts for these three values of @xmath2 with solid , dashed and dotdashed lines , respectively . in the right graph of this figure",
    "we show the fermion bound states as a function of @xmath2 and indicate the same three values of @xmath2 with solid , dashed and dotdashed lines . as it can be seen , there are two threshold bound states ( with @xmath127 ) at @xmath128 . at @xmath129",
    "there is only the zero - energy bound state and at @xmath130 there are two additional bound states .     the left graph : the graphical representation of @xmath131 as a function of @xmath83 . in these graphs @xmath123 and @xmath122 , and",

    "the three values of @xmath2 are shown by the solid , dashed and dotdashed lines . ]",
    "we first utilize the weak form of the levinson theorem for counting the exact number of the zero - energy bound states .",
    "the weak form of this theorem for the dirac equation can be written as follows ( see for example @xcite ) @xmath135+\\left[\\delta^{\\mathrm{sea}}(0)-\\delta^{\\mathrm{sea}}(\\infty)\\right ] = \\delta\\delta^{\\textrm{sky}}+\\delta\\delta^{\\textrm{sea } } = \\left(n+\\frac{n_\\mathrm{t}}{2}-\\frac{n_\\mathrm{t}^0}{2}\\right)\\pi.\\ ] ] here @xmath136 is the total number of bound states , @xmath137 is the total number of threshold bound states at the given strength of the potential and @xmath138 is the total number of threshold bound states at the zero strength of the potential .",
    "in fact the last term takes into account the two threshold half bound states which exist for a free dirac field in one spatial dimension .",
    "therefore , in this model @xmath139 .",
    "now , we check this theorem for the sample phase shifts drawn in fig.[phaseshift ] .",
    "as shown in the left graph of this figure , for the phase shift at @xmath140 , depicted by the solid line , we have @xmath141 .",
    "from the right graph we can see that @xmath142 at @xmath140 , and since @xmath143 , the levinson theorem predicts only one bound state which is in fact the nondegenerate zero - energy bound state . by considering the phase shift at the other values of @xmath2",
    ", we conclude the same result .",
    "now , we briefly explain the strong form of the levinson theorem which deals with the value of the phase shift at @xmath144 ( @xmath145 ) and @xmath146 ( @xmath147 ) , separately @xcite . for @xmath144",
    "this theorem can be expressed in the following form @xmath148 that is the value of the phase shift at zero momentum for each continuum is equal to the number of the bound states that exit minus the number of the bound states that enter that continuum from @xmath149 , as the strength of the potential is increased from zero to its final value .",
    "we can easily see that the sample phase shifts shown in fig.[phaseshift ] are consistent with the relation ( [ levstrong1 ] ) .",
    "for example , at @xmath129 the value of the phase shifts at zero momentum ( @xmath149 ) are @xmath150 .",
    "on the other hand , from the right graph of fig.[phaseshift ] we see the total number of bound states that have exited each of the continua from the line @xmath149 is @xmath150 .",
    "we conclude that the ever present zero - energy bound state has been formed from the union of the two threshold ( half ) bound states present in the free case , i.e.at @xmath151 . at @xmath128 two threshold bound states",
    "have formed at @xmath152 and the corresponding phase shifts are @xmath153 . for @xmath154 these states have completely separated from the continua and become full bound states .",
    "therefore , the corresponding phase shifts attain the value @xmath155 .",
    "this sort of consistencies can be easily seen for other phase shifts .",
    "the strong form of the levinson theorem for @xmath146 can be written as follows @xmath156 this means that the value of the phase shift for @xmath147 is equal to the total number of the bound states that enter minus the number of the bound states that exit that continuum from @xmath157 , as the strength of the potential is increased from zero to its final value . for the generic cases where the presence of a background field does not cause the hamiltonian to lose its hermiticity",
    "the spectrum remains complete , and hence @xmath158 . since in this model",
    "the charge and particle conjugation symmetrirs imply that @xmath159 for all @xmath83 , we expect @xmath160 , and this is precisely the results shown in fig.[phaseshift ] .",
    "now we emphasis several important properties of the spectrum of the model at this point . as is evident from the right graph of fig.[phaseshift ] , there are no level crossing , the spectrum is symmetric about @xmath1 , the dynamical mass generated is @xmath101 , and the zero mode is always present .",
    "in this paper we thoroughly investigate the ( @xmath161)-dimensional model considered by jackiw and rebbi , whence they have introduced the possibility of the fractional fermion number for the ground state . in this model a fermi field is coupled to a prescribed pseudoscalar field in the form of the kink characterized by two parameters @xmath2 ( the value of the kink at spatial infinity ) and @xmath3 ( the slope of the kink at @xmath12 ) .",
    "we solve the equations of motion of this system analytically and exactly , and find the bound state wave functions and energies as well as the continuum states for arbitrary choice of the parameters @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "then , we plot the bound state energies of the fermion as a function of the parameter @xmath2 . having this complete set of solutions",
    ", we can consider a process in which the background field evolves from zero to its final form .",
    "we can then observe the changes in the spectrum of the fermion during this process .",
    "we find that the interaction induces a mass for the fermi field @xmath162 .",
    "that is although the free theory is massless , a band gap appears as @xmath2 increases . also , the bound states start appearing with @xmath163_{\\mathrm{f}}+1 $ ] .",
    "the invariance of the system under the charge and particle conjugation symmetry is obvious in the graph of the bound energies , since the energy levels are totally symmetric with respect to the line of @xmath1 .",
    "we focus our attention especially on the zero - energy fermionic mode and see that this mode is always present for every choice of the parameters .",
    "in particular , we expose the origin of the ever present zero mode : in the free dirac case , i.e.when @xmath151 , there is no mass gap and two threshold zero - energy bound states seperate the continua .",
    "as @xmath2 increases , a mass gap appears and the two threshold bound states merge to form the zero - energy bound state .",
    "we also find the continuum scattering states of the fermion analytically and then calculate the phase shift of these wave functions .",
    "using the weak form of the levinson theorem , we conclude that the self charge conjugate zero - energy fermionic mode is a nondegenerate mode as jackiw and rebbi stated .",

    "<S> moreover , we obtain analytically the continuum scattering wave functions of the fermion and then calculate the phase shifts of these wave functions . using the information contained in the graphs of the phase shifts and the bound states , </S>",
    "<S> we show that our phase shifts are consistent with the weak and strong forms of the levinson theorem . </S>",
    "<S> finally , using the weak form of the levinson theorem , we confirm that the number of the zero - energy fermionic modes is exactly one . </S>"
