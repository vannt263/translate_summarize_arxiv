    "high - redshift damped lyman-@xmath0 ( dla ) systems observed in absorption against qso spectra are characterized by their extremely strong hi@xmath211215 lines corresponding to large neutral hydrogen column densities , @xmath2hi@xmath22 @xmath4 .",
    "hydrodynamical simulations suggest that dla systems are located inside regions of over - densities of the order of 1000 and higher ( see e.g. haehnelt , steinmetz & rauch 2000 ; gardner et al .",
    "2001 ) and that dla systems at @xmath23 occur very close ( within 10 - 15 kpc ) to the center of l@xmath24 galaxies .",
    "this is purely speculative however and the exact nature of dla systems is still to be clarified .",
    "though observational studies of dla systems have been pursued over two decades now , important questions are still unanswered , such as : ( i ) the presence of in - situ star - formation activity in dla systems , ( ii ) the connection between observed abundance ratios and dust content , ( iii ) how severe is the bias due to dust obscuration in current dla samples .",
    "assessing the molecular content of dla systems can provide direct handle on at least some of these issues .",
    "formation of h@xmath5 is expected on the surface of dust grains if the gas is cool , dense and mostly neutral , and from the formation of negative hydrogen if the gas is warm and dust - free ( see e.g. jenkins & peimbert 1997 ; cazaux & tielens 2002 ) . as the former process is most likely dominant in the neutral gas associated with dla systems , it is possible to obtain an indirect indication of the amount of dust in dla systems without depending on extinction and/or heavy element dust depletion effects . moreover , from determining the populations of different rotational levels of h@xmath5 , one can constrain kinetic and rotational excitation temperatures as well as particle densities .",
    "the effective photo - dissociation of h@xmath5 takes place in the energy range @xmath25 ev through lyman- and werner - band absorption lines and , therefore , the intensity of the local uv radiation field can be derived from the observed molecular fraction .",
    "a direct determination of the local uv radiation field could have important implications in bridging the link between dla systems and star - formation activity in high - redshift galaxies .    at hi column densities as large as those measured in dla systems , h@xmath5 molecules are conspicuous in our galaxy : gas clouds with @xmath17hi@xmath26 usually have @xmath17h@xmath27 ( see e.g. savage et al .",
    "1977 ; jenkins & shaya 1979 ) .",
    "given this fact , it is somewhat surprising that earlier searches for molecular hydrogen in dla systems , though not systematic , have found either small values or upper limits on the molecular fraction of the gas , @xmath12h@xmath13h@xmath14hi@xmath15 $ ] ( black , chaffee & foltz 1987 ; levshakov et al . 1992 ) . for a long time , only the dla system at @xmath28 toward q0528@xmath8250 was known to contain molecular hydrogen ( levshakov & varshalovich 1985 ; foltz , chaffee & black 1988 ) .",
    "more recently , ge & bechtold ( 1999 ) searched for h@xmath5 molecules in a sample of eight dla systems using the mmt moderate - resolution spectrograph ( @xmath29  ) .",
    "apart from the detection of molecular hydrogen at @xmath30 and 2.338 toward , respectively , q0013@xmath8004 and q1232@xmath7082 ( ge & bechtold 1997 ; ge , bechtold & kulkarni 2001 ) , they measured in the other systems upper limits on @xmath31 in the range @xmath32 .",
    "the molecular hydrogen content of the above three systems , where h@xmath5 was detected at intermediate spectral resolution , has been reexamined systematically using high spectral resolution data ( @xmath33  ) , leading to : @xmath2h@xmath34 @xmath4 and @xmath35 toward q0528@xmath8250 ( srianand & petitjean 1998 ) , @xmath36h@xmath37 @xmath4 and @xmath38 toward q0013@xmath8004 ( petitjean , srianand & ledoux 2002 ) and @xmath2h@xmath39 @xmath4 and @xmath40 toward q1232@xmath7082 ( srianand , petitjean & ledoux 2000 ) .",

    "we indeed detect h@xmath5 at @xmath61 toward q0405@xmath8443 , which is a line of sight containing no less than three dla systems .",
    "the important result is that the [ x / h ] distributions are different in sub - sample sh@xmath5 and in sample s1 ( @xmath62 ) : systems where h@xmath5 is detected are definitively amongst the most metal - rich .",
    "interestingly , none of the 17 systems with [ x / h@xmath11<-1.3",

    "although h@xmath5 is detected in a dla system with [ zn / fe ] as low as 0.3 ( at @xmath61 toward q0405@xmath8443 ) , there is a clear tendency for depletion factors to be larger in systems where h@xmath5 is detected .",
    "the [ x / fe ] distributions are different in sub - sample sh@xmath5 and in sample s1 ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "in particular , h@xmath5 is detected in the five systems with the largest depletion factors ( [ x / fe@xmath11\\ge 0.7 $ ] ) .    in fig .",

    "measurements from sample s1 are shown by squares , with dark squares for systems where h@xmath5 is detected .",
    "it is apparent that , in the overall population of dla systems , there is a lack of systems with both a high metallicity and a large hi column density .",
    "this was first noticed by boiss et al .",
    "( 1998 ) who suggested that this might be due to the fact that , if these systems exist , they may avoid detection because the background quasars are attenuated by dust extinction ( fall & pei 1993 ) .",
    "this assumes at least some correlation between metallicity and the amount of dust .",
    "it can be seen in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ figsample2 ] that indeed there is a trend for the most metal - rich systems to have larger depletion factors .",
    "this is detected at the @xmath65 significance level using a kendall rank correlation test on censored data and taking into account the measurement uncertainties .",
    "this trend was already noticed before by ledoux et al .",
    "( 2002a ) , at a lower significance level , probably due to a less homogenous sample , larger measurement uncertainties and the observation of a narrower metallicity range .",
    "however , from this alone , it was unclear whether this trend is a consequence of dust depletion effects or peculiar nucleosynthesis history of zinc ( prochaska & wolfe 2002 ) .",
    "however , a correlation is observed in both our sample and also the global population of dla systems .",
    "moreover , it is clear from fig .",
    "[ figsample2 ] that h@xmath5 is detected at both the highest metallicities and the largest depletion factors .",
    "this strongly favors the fact that the correlation between metallicity and depletion factor is a consequence of dust depletion effects .",
    "if we consider only dla systems , with @xmath17hi@xmath44 , firm detection of h@xmath5 is achieved in 6 out of 24 systems . if we also include sub - dla systems , this amounts to 8 detections out of 33 systems .",
    "therefore , h@xmath5 is detected in more than 20 percent of the dla systems .",
    "however , three of the systems where h@xmath5 is seen were already known .",
    "if we exclude these systems , we actually detect h@xmath5 in 13 to 20 percent of the newly surveyed systems .",
    "note that we do not include in these calculations the tentative detections toward q0000@xmath8263 ( levshakov et al . 2000 ) and q0841@xmath7129 ( petitjean et al . 2000 ) .",
    "the detection probability of h@xmath5 with column densities greater than @xmath66 @xmath4 is more than 90 percent along lines of sight through the ism of our galaxy and in the smc ( savage et al .",
    "1977 ; richter et al . 2001 ; tumlinson et al . 2002 )",
    ". however , only 52 percent of the lines of sight through the lmc have detectable h@xmath5 lines ( tumlinson et al .",
    "these differences in the detection probability can not be ascribed solely to different chemical enrichment histories as the ism of the lmc has a mean metallicity only 0.3 dex lower than the galactic local ism and the metallicity of the smc is 0.6 dex lower than that ( russell & dopita 1992 ) .",
    "therefore , the small detection probability in dla systems is probably not only related to their low metallicities .",
    "the level of star - formation activity in or nearby the systems might well be the primary reason for the low detection rate of h@xmath5 as it has been advocated in the case of the lmc ( kim et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "as noted above , in our sample the detection of h@xmath5 is not correlated with the hi column density .",
    "the hi column density distribution is similar in sample s1 and in the sub - sample of systems where h@xmath5 is detected ( see fig .  [ figsample1 ] ) . in particular , h@xmath5 is detected in two sub - dla systems , with @xmath17hi@xmath18 . in addition , amongst the systems where h@xmath5 is detected there is no correlation between the logarithm of the molecular fraction , @xmath67 , and @xmath17hi@xmath57 ( see fig .",

    "observations along lines of sight in the lmc and smc from tumlinson et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and in the galaxy from savage et al .",
    "( 1977 ) are also shown .",
    "it is apparent that most dla systems are similar to the lmc and/or smc lines of sight .",
    "in particular , and contrary to what happens in our galaxy , a significant number of lines of sight through the lmc have @xmath19 for @xmath68hi@xmath69 .",
    "this is also the case for 58 percent of the dla systems ( @xmath70hi@xmath71 ) in which we could achieve such a limit , which means that this number is a lower limit on the fraction of systems having such a small molecular fraction . indeed ,",
    "if all detection limits are considered to be that constraining then the fraction of systems with @xmath19 is 75 percent .",
    "note that several systems have a very small molecular fraction , @xmath72 .",
    "interestingly , this is an order of magnitude smaller than the primordial freeze - out fraction of h@xmath5 molecules ( lepp & shull 1984 ) .",
    "it is very difficult to reproduce such small values in models of cool clouds ( see petitjean et al . 2000 ;",
    "liszt 2002 ) .",
    "when h@xmath5 is detected , the molecular fraction is in the range @xmath73 with some scatter , with the exception of the dla system toward q0347@xmath8383 for which @xmath74 .",
    "the former values are similar to what is seen along the lmc and smc lines of sight .",
    "the sharp transition from @xmath75 to @xmath76 at a column density @xmath17hi@xmath77 observed for the galactic lines of sight ( savage et al .",
    "1977 ) is not clearly present in the smc , in the lmc nor in sample sh@xmath5 .",
    "this transition is believed to occur at the point at which the clouds achieve self - shielding . however",
    ", a characteristic hi column density can possibly correspond to some self - shielding scale only if the parameters controlling the formation equilibrium of h@xmath5 are similar along different lines of sight , with very little scatter , which may be the case in our galaxy .",
    "therefore , our results suggest that dla systems span a wide range of physical conditions .",
    "this is also suggested by the large scatter seen in the metallicity measured in dla systems at a given redshift ( see e.g. prochaska & wolfe 2002 ) .",
    "this conclusion is strengthened by the fact that there is a clear dichotomy in @xmath67 values whatever the hi column density is , with very few measurements in the range @xmath78 .",
    "this bimodal distribution could be a consequence of self - shielding , which would mean that , in dla systems , self - shielding can be achieved at any hi column density probably because the uv radiation field varies strongly from one system to the other .",
    "alternatively , as shown by tumlinson et al .",
    "( 2002 ) in the case of the magellanic clouds , most of the observations can be explained by models where the formation rate of h@xmath5 onto dust grains is reduced and the ionizing flux is enhanced relative to what is observed in our galaxy ( see also the models by shaye 2001 ) .",
    "basically , the above characteristic hi column density , @xmath17hi@xmath79 , observed for galactic clouds , would be located beyond the observed range in the case of dla systems ( i.e. @xmath17hi@xmath80 ) .",
    "note that there are two sub - dla systems , with @xmath17hi@xmath18 , having detected h@xmath5 molecules .",
    "these systems , at @xmath81 toward q0013@xmath8004 and @xmath6 toward q1444@xmath7014 , are amongst the most metal ( and dust ) -rich absorbers of sample s1 .",
    "they , together with the dla system at @xmath82 toward q1232@xmath7082 , have the highest molecular fractions , and could be part of the population arising in disc - like gas .",
    "it can be seen on fig .",
    "[ figsample1 ] that the probability of detecting h@xmath5 is unity for systems with large depletion factors , [ x / fe@xmath11\\ge 0.7 $ ] .",
    "this is a crude indication that the presence of dust is an important factor for the formation of h@xmath5 in dla systems .",
    "it is known that h@xmath5 formation is mediated by either dust grains if the gas is cool and dense , or h@xmath83 if it is warm and dust - free .",
    "if the former process is dominant in dla systems then some correlation between h@xmath5 molecular fraction and amount of dust is expected . however , in the case of dla systems it is difficult to quantify the amount of dust that is present .",
    "we first plot in fig .",
    "[ figfdep ] molecular fractions versus depletions ( probably onto dust grains ) as estimated from the abundances of zn relative to fe , or s when zn is not detected , or si when zn is not detected and sulfur lines are blended .",
    "a trend between both quantities is present at the @xmath84 significance level using a kendall rank correlation test taking into account upper and lower limits on @xmath67 .",
    "note however that there is a two orders of magnitude scatter in @xmath67 for a given depletion factor so that there is basically no correlation between @xmath67 and [ x / fe ] if only detections are considered ( correlation significant at the @xmath85 level only ) .",
    "the above trend is therefore a consequence of h@xmath5 being detected in none of the systems with [ x / fe@xmath11<0.4 $ ] except one ( at @xmath61 toward q0405@xmath8443 ) .",
    "the corresponding systems have a very low dust content . a depletion factor",
    "[ zn / fe@xmath11\\sim 0.4 $ ] corresponds to a very small @xmath86 ( @xmath87 ) for physical conditions similar to the ones prevailing in our galaxy .",
    "we have seen that the depletion factor is correlated with the metallicity in dla systems .",
    "there is therefore some correlation between the depletion factor and the amount of dust .",
    "however , the scatter is large .",
    "this is why it can be , in general , misleading to use only the depletion factor as an indicator of the dust content of the absorbing gas .",
    "a better indicator of the dust content is the dust - to - gas ratio : @xmath88}(1 - 10^{\\rm [ fe / x]})$ ] , where x stands for a reference element which is little or unaffected by dust depletion effects . in fig .",
    "[ figfdust ] , we plot the molecular fraction versus the amount of dust as measured by the dust - to - gas ratio . it can be seen that , as expected , low dust content , @xmath89 ( e.g. [ x / h@xmath11<-1.3 $ ] and [ x / fe@xmath11<0.5 $ ] ) , implies low molecular fraction , @xmath90 , while larger molecular fraction , @xmath91 , is only found for higher dust content , @xmath92 .",
    "however , large amounts of dust do not always imply large molecular fractions .",
    "there are a few non - detections with @xmath92 and @xmath90 .",
    "in particular , the two systems with @xmath93 and @xmath90 are sub - dla systems ( see also fig .",
    "[ figsample2 ] , upper plot , at [ x / h@xmath11\\simeq -0.3 $ ] ) .",
    "therefore , in these systems the lack of molecules could be the consequence of enhanced radiation field below the lyman limit .",
    "another important factor governing the presence of h@xmath5 molecules appears to be the local physical conditions of the absorbing gas .",
    "relatively large molecular fractions , @xmath94 , are found in gas having large particle densities , @xmath95 @xmath96 , and low temperatures , @xmath97 k ( see petitjean et al .",
    "2002 ; ledoux et al .",
    "one should keep in mind that the formation rate of h@xmath5 goes linearly with the density of dust grains while it goes as the second power of the hi density . therefore , it is natural that , even though the presence of dust is an important factor for the formation of molecules , local physical conditions such as gas density , temperature and local uv field play a major role in governing the molecular fraction of a given cloud in dla systems .",
    "note that the above discussion is based on the determination of mean metallicities in dla systems . in most cases",
    ", this means that the metallicity is calculated over some velocity range and , therefore , over several components .",
    "however , we have shown that the depletion in the components where h@xmath5 is detected can be much larger than the mean depletion . as an example , a large depletion factor has been observed in a well - defined , weak h@xmath5 component in the dla system at @xmath98 toward q0013@xmath8004 ( petitjean et al .",
    "this kind of component can usually be revealed by the corresponding , narrow ci absorption line .",
    "however , for other species the component is most often blended with other components in the rest of the profile .",
    "this means that absorption lines due to cold gas , i.e. related to ci components , can be hidden in the absorption line profile produced by a more pervasive medium .",
    "this implies that absolute metallicities are not accurately determined in the cold gas .",
    "this fact is probably not important for volatile elements as for them the dominant components actually produce the strongest absorption lines , but could be of importance for fe co - production elements which can be depleted onto dust grains .",
    "consequently , absorption lines from the latter elements can be weak and lost in the profiles .",
    "therefore , we could underestimate the depletion factors in these components .",
    "in the previous section , we have given two new arguments in favor of the presence of dust in dla systems .",
    "first , there is a correlation between metallicity and depletion factor and , second , molecular hydrogen is observed in the systems having the highest metallicities and the largest depletion factors . in a simple picture of star - formation history",
    ", one can imagine that the gas is slowly enriched by on - going star formation and , therefore , metallicity and dust content should increase together with time . in fig .",
    "[ figfz ] , we plot the total number of dla / sub - dla systems in our sample versus redshift along with the number of systems where h@xmath5 is detected . although the statistics are based on small numbers , the probability of finding molecules in the @xmath99 systems is highest .",
    "this probably indicates that the amount of dust in dla systems increases with time .",
    "although the increase of zn metallicity with decreasing redshift is not fully established ( e.g. pettini et al . 1999 ) , there is some evidence for such an increase at @xmath100 ( prochaska & wolfe 2002 ; kulkarni & fall 2002 ) .",
    "consequently , the possible lack of increase with time of the mean fe metallicity in dla systems ( e.g. prochaska & wolfe 2002 ) could be related to the fact that the intrinsic increase in metallicity is hidden by larger depletion onto dust grains at low and intermediate redshifts ( see ledoux et al .",
    "although the presence of dust in dla systems was claimed very early ( pei , fall & bechtold 1991 ) , the issue of whether the abundance pattern observed in dla systems reflects depletion of refractory elements onto dust grains or nucleosynthesis effects has remained controversial ( see e.g. lu et al . 1996 ; pettini et al .",
    "recently , several studies have shown that the two effects , dust depletion and peculiar nucleosynthesis history , should be invoked altogether to explain the observations ( vladilo 1998 ; prochaska & wolfe 2002 ; ledoux et al .",
    "2002a ) . in any case",
    ", all these studies conclude that the dust content of dla systems is usually small",
    ". however , it is possible that the current sample of dla systems is biased against high - metallicity and dusty absorbers . indeed , boiss et al .",
    "( 1998 ) have noticed that there is a lack of absorbers with both a large @xmath2hi@xmath57 and a high metallicity .",
    "if this dust - induced bias exists , however , it probably can not lead to underestimate the hi mass in dla systems by more than a factor of two ( ellison et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "in the course of a survey of 24 dla and 9 sub - dla systems , we have confirmed four previous detections of molecular hydrogen and made three new ones .",
    "the bulk of the dla population is found to have low metallicities , [ x / h@xmath11<-1.0 $ ] , together with small depletion factors , [ x / fe@xmath11<0.5 $ ] .",
    "although molecules can be found along lines of sight with small depletion factors ( [ zn / fe@xmath11=0.3 $ ] ) , they are generally found in the most metal - rich systems , [ x / h@xmath11>-1.0 $ ] , with large depletion factors , [ x / fe@xmath11>0.5 $ ] .",
    "this clearly demonstrates the existence of dust in at least 20 percent of the dla systems .",
    "moreover , we have found very large depletion factors in two sub - systems where h@xmath5 is detected , at @xmath101 toward q0013@xmath8004 ( petitjean et al .",
    "2002 ) , where [ zn / fe@xmath11=1.6 $ ] , and at @xmath102 toward q1444@xmath7014 ( see sect .",
    "[ q1444 ] ) , where [ zn / fe@xmath11=1.4 $ ] .",
    "this shows that dust depletion can be quite large in some of the dla systems .",
    "the extinction is small in these cases however , probably because of relatively small hi column densities ( e.g. @xmath17hi@xmath103 in the @xmath101 system toward q0013@xmath8004 ) .",
    "in addition , there is a correlation between metallicity and depletion factor in all dla samples ( large depletion factors are seen in systems with high metallicities ) .",
    "this trend has been noticed before by ledoux et al .",
    "( 2002a ) . however , it was unclear whether this trend is really due to dust depletion .",
    "prochaska & wolfe ( 2002 ) indeed argued that such a correlation may arise from a significant dispersion in the production of zinc .",
    "however , the correlation is present in both our sample and also the global population of dla systems .",
    "moreover , it is clear that molecular hydrogen is mostly detected at the highest metallicities and the largest depletion factors .",
    "this strongly favors the hypothesis that the correlation between metallicity and depletion factor is actually a consequence of dust depletion effects .",
    "not only dust could be present in most of the dla systems , but also the possibility that the population of dla systems is biased against the presence of systems having both a high metallicity and a large dust content still needs to be considered seriously .",
    "one of the striking results of the survey is that for most of the dla systems the molecular fraction is very small ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "this is much smaller than what is observed in the disc of the galaxy at similar hi column densities ( see savage et al .",
    "1977 ) . however , the situation is comparable to what is observed along lines of sight in the lmc and smc ( tumlinson et al .",
    "indeed , similar upper limits on the molecular fraction have been measured for a large number of lines of sight in the lmc . moreover ,",
    "the mean molecular fraction in dla systems where h@xmath5 is detected is of the order of 0.01 , about the same as in the lmc and smc and about a factor of ten smaller than in the disc of the galaxy .",
    "this is probably a consequence of reduced formation rate of h@xmath5 onto dust grains because the temperature of the gas is high ( petitjean et al .",
    "indeed , in the framework of models of cool clouds it is difficult to explain the very low values of the upper limits ( @xmath72 ) achieved for a handful of dla systems in our sample ( see fig .  7 of liszt 2002 ) .",
    "this can also be due to an intense ambient uv flux ( see models by tumlinson et al .",
    "2002 ) , but this is unclear and should be investigated in detail by analysis of the systems where h@xmath5 is detected ( see srianand & petitjean 1998 ; petitjean et al .",
    "2002 ; ledoux et al .",
    "2002b ) .",
    "star - formation activity is probably not intense in the close vicinity of most of the systems .",
    "mller et al . (",
    "2002 ) found that a few dla systems are associated with lyman - break galaxies .",
    "however , from spectroscopy of 11 out of 22 candidates in 6 fields , targeting 8 dla systems , they identified only one galaxy counterpart .",
    "this means that , even if dla systems can be associated with lyman - break galaxies , they must have most of the time moderate star - formation activity with luminosities @xmath104 ( see e.g. fynbo , mller & thomsen 2001 ) .",
    "in addition , in the framework of current models of structure formation , dla systems preferentially sample the outer regions of galaxies at the faint end of the galaxy luminosity function ( haehnelt et al .",
    "one way of explaining the small molecular fractions observed in dla systems is that the associated emitting object is faint and has moderate star - formation activity , but that the gas giving rise to the dla absorption line is located inside the regions where star formation occurs .",
    "the probably large turbulence induced by on - going star formation may then help explain the required large covering factors associated with such regions .",
    "this would imply that star formation is gentle and diffuse in the systems .",
    "the diffuse uv flux can be estimated from the excitation of molecular hydrogen .",
    "this will be done in a forthcoming paper .",
    "additional deep imaging in the vicinity of the qso lines of sight is also needed to unveil the nature of star - formation activity in dla systems .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank our colleagues from eso paranal observatory , and in particular a. kaufer , for their patient , thorough and efficient help at the vlt and during data reduction .",
    "we also warmly thank j. fynbo and an anonymous referee for useful comments on the paper and j. smoker for a careful reading of it .",
