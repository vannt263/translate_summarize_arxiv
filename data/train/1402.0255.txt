    "relativistic heavy - ion collisions provide the opportunity to study strongly interacting nuclear matter at different thermodynamic conditions .",
    "quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , a fundamental theory to describe the interactions of quarks and gluons , has anticipated the transition from hadronic matter to a new state of matter called quark - gluon plasma ( qgp )  [ 1 ] phase at high temperature and high energy density ( @xmath11 gev/@xmath12 ) .",
    "the qcd phase diagram is characterized by the temperature ( t ) and the baryon chemical potential ( @xmath13 ) or the ( net ) baryon density ( @xmath14 ) , and it contains the information about the phase boundary that separates the qgp and hadronic phases  [ 2,3 ] .",
    "finite temperature lattice qcd calculations  [ 4 ] predict a cross - over from hadronic to qgp phase at vanishing baryon chemical potential and large t while several qcd - based calculations  [ 5 ] show that at lower t and @xmath15 a first - order phase transition may take place .",
    "the point in the qcd phase diagram , where the first order phase transition ends would be the qcd critical point  [ 6 ] .",
    "the bes program at rhic has been carried out with the specific aim to explore several features of qcd phase diagram such as to search for the phase boundaries and the location of qcd critical point by colliding nuclei at several center - of - mass energies . when heavy ions collide at ultra - relativistic energies , the state of the system at the time of the final interaction is reflected by the observed single particle spectra .",
    "the process of hadron decoupling from an interacting system is called freeze - out .",
    "freeze - out are of two types - kinetic and chemical freeze - out .",
    "chemical freeze - out occurs at a temperature ( t@xmath16 ) when inelastic collisions cease and the particle yields become fixed and thermal ( kinetic ) freeze - out occurs at a temperature ( t@xmath17 ) when elastic collisions cease and particle transverse momenta spectra are fixed .",
    "+ in this paper we discuss the identified transverse momentum spectra and particle ratios produced in au+au collisions at @xmath18 = 27 gev .",
    "similar measurements at other bes center - of - mass energies @xmath19 , 11.5 , and 39 gev are reported in  [ 7 ] .",
    "statistical thermal models , such as thermus  [ 8 ] have been proven to be successful in describing the particle production in heavy - ion collisions  [ 9 , 10 , 11 ] .",
    "experimental particle ratios are used in a statistical thermal model in both grand canonical ensemble ( gce ) and strangeness canonical ensemble ( sce ) approach to extract various chemical freeze - out parameters such as chemical freeze - out temperature ( t@xmath16 ) , baryon chemical potential ( @xmath13 ) , strangeness chemical potential ( @xmath20 ) and strangeness saturation factor ( @xmath21 ) . in this study",
    "we have used mid - rapidity particle ratios that include measured yields for charged pions ( @xmath0 ) , charged kaons ( @xmath1 ) , protons ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) , @xmath4 , lambdas ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 ) and cascades ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 )  [ 7 , 12 ] .",
    "the energy and centrality dependence of extracted chemical freeze - out parameters in au+au collisions at above bes energies are studied .",
    "figures 1 and 2 show the transverse momentum spectra of @xmath22 and @xmath23 respectively in au+au collisions at @xmath24 gev in different centralities at mid - rapidity @xmath25 .",
    "the @xmath10-integrated pion yields obtained from the bose - einstein fit to @xmath10-spectra have been corrected for feed - down from weak decays . the @xmath26-exponential fit is used to obtain the @xmath10-integrated kaon yields .",
    "the collision - energy dependence of the anti - particle to particle ratios in central heavy - ion collisions for @xmath27 and @xmath28/@xmath23 are shown in fig .",
    "the @xmath27 ratio at lower beam energies have values larger than unity , which could be due to significant contributions from resonance decays ( such as from @xmath29 baryons ) .",
    "the @xmath3/@xmath2 ratio , not shown in this paper , increases with increasing collision energy and approaches unity for top rhic energies  [ 21 ] .",
    "this indicates that at higher beam energies , the @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) production at mid - rapidity is dominated by pair production . the @xmath28/@xmath23 ratio approaches unity as collision energy increases , indicating the dominance of kaon - pair production while at lower bes energies associated production of @xmath23 dominates .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "the study of the hadron particle ratios at bes energies in star within the framework of a statistical model yields the following conclusions .",
    "a centrality dependence of the chemical freeze - out parameters is observed at the lower energies .",
    "baryon chemical potential ( @xmath15 ) range extends from 20 to 400 mev in the qcd phase diagram in the new bes measurements at @xmath30 , 11.5 , 27 and 39 gev .",
    "a detailed study using particle yields and different choices of ensembles in the statistical model is ongoing : this is expected to provide a better understanding of the freeze - out dynamics .",
