    "we introduced in @xcite the newton algorithm as an efficient way to study an arbitrary ideal @xmath0 in @xmath1 $ ] , involving a finite succession of newton polygons .",
    "we showed for instance how to compute its integral closure and the hilbert - samuel multiplicity of @xmath0 in a nice combinatorial way . in this article",
    "we provide more applications .",
    "first we show how the newton algorithm can be used to compute by induction the motivic zeta function of @xmath0 , yielding candidate poles associated to the faces of the successive newton polygons ( theorem [ formulazetafunction ] ) .",
    "this method is much more efficient than other ones in the literature , and almost all candidate poles are true poles .",
    "the classical method uses a log principalization of @xmath0 and yields generally an enormous amount of false candidate poles . on the other hand the formula in (",
    "* theorem 6.1 ) has only the actual poles , but it involves horrible determinants , that are in fact again expressed in terms of a log principalization .",
    "in @xcite we moreover codified most of the data of the algorithm in a useful combinatorial object , the newton tree of @xmath0 .",
    "this ( decorated ) tree depends heavily on the chosen resolution .",
    "we introduce an operator on newton trees , _ exchange of vertical edge _ , and show that it corresponds to a change of coordinates ( proposition [ exchange ] ) .",
    "we define the notion of _ minimal newton tree _ , we prove that any newton tree can be converted into a minimal one by exchanging vertical edges ( proposition [ towardsminimal ] ) , and that this is related to the use of so - called _ ( very ) good coordinates_. coming back to the motivic zeta function , some very particular faces do not give poles ( proposition [ no - contribution ] ) , and these faces will not appear when one uses very good coordinates .",
    "a minimal newton tree of @xmath0 has also a conceptual geometric interpretation .",
    "roughly its vertices correspond to the exceptional components in the log canonical model of the ideal , and its edges to intersections of components ( theorem [ principalization ] ) .",
    "also the decorations of the newton tree correspond exactly to the classical  decorations on a dual tree of a curve configuration . for vertex decorations",
    "this was shown in @xcite in the context of principal ideals ; the argument is still valid for arbitrary ideals . for edge decorations the result is new ( proposition [ edgedecorations ] ) .",
    "we also show a generalization of a result known in the case where the ideal is principal @xcite@xcite , that is , that there exists a system of coordinates such that the log canonical threshold can be computed from the newton polygon ( theorem [ lct ] ) . in @xcite and @xcite",
    "the authors prove inequalities between the hilbert - samuel multiplicity of an ideal and its log canonical threshold . using the computations via newton polygons",
    "these inequalities appear to be simple geometric facts ( corollary [ hsknown ] ) , and using the computations via the newton algorithm they can be strengthened ( theorem [ hsinequality ] ) .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in the next section we recall the newton algorithm for ideals . in section",
    "@xmath2 we apply the newton algorithm to the computation of the motivic zeta function . in section 4 , after recalling the construction of newton trees , we compare them in different systems of coordinates and we introduce the notion of minimal newton tree . in section",
