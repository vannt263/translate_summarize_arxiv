    "the chiral quark condensate @xmath0 plays a central rle in qcd nonperturbative dynamics , being together with the pion decay constant the other principal ( lowest dimensional ) order parameter of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking , @xmath7 for @xmath8 massless quarks , the physically relevant cases being @xmath9 .",
    "it is considered a nonperturbative quantity by excellence , in the sense that it is trivially vanishing at any finite order of ( ordinary ) perturbative qcd in the chiral ( massless quark ) limit , as we recall in more details below .",
    "there is a long history of its determination from various models and analytic methods , the best known being the gell - mann  oakes - renner ( gmor ) relation  @xcite , relating the quark condensate to the pion mass , the decay constant @xmath10 , and the light current quark masses @xmath11 , typically for the degenerate two - flavor case : f^2_m^2_= -(m_u + m_d ) |u u + o(m^2_q ) .",
    "[ gmor ] nowadays the light current quark masses can be precisely extracted from lattice simulations  @xcite or spectral sum rules ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) , giving from using the gmor relation above an indirect precise determination of the condensate . however , as indicated relation ( [ gmor ] ) is valid upon neglecting possible higher order terms @xmath12 .",
    "indeed , the gmor relation entails explicit chiral symmetry breaking from current quark masses . since the condensate is more a property of the qcd vacuum in the strict chiral limit , it is highly desirable to obtain a possible ` first principle ' determination of this dynamical quantity in the strict chiral limit , to disentangle from quark current mass effects .",
    "an early analytic determination was in the framework of the nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl ) model  @xcite and its various extensions as a low - energy effective model of qcd , valid at least for the gross features of chiral symmetry breaking properties . in the njl model ,",
    "the condensate is evaluated in the strict chiral limit , or taking into account explicit breaking from small current quark masses , in the leading ( large-@xmath13 ) approximation  @xcite as a function of the physical cutoff and other parameters of the model to be fitted from data .",
    "there are also related other attempts based on analytic methods , like schwinger - dyson equations  @xcite typically .",
    "phenomenological values of the condensate can also be extracted  @xcite indirectly from data using spectral qcd sum rule methods  @xcite , where the quark condensate and other higher - dimensional condensates enter as nonperturbative parameters of the operator product expansion in inverse powers of momenta . + more recently ` ab initio ' lattice calculations have determined the quark condensate by several independent approaches , some actually related to the gmor relation , or some more direct determinations with different methods  @xcite ( see @xcite for a review of various recent lattice determinations ) . in particular after early pioneering work  @xcite , there has been more recently a renewed intense interest in computing on the lattice the spectral density of the dirac operator  @xcite , directly related to the quark condensate through the banks - casher relation  @xcite .",
    "however , while many recent lattice results are statistically very precise , lattice determinations rely in the end on extrapolations to the chiral limit , often using chiral perturbation theory  @xcite input for that purpose . earlier general results on the spectral density in the nonperturbative low eigenvalue range had been obtained in @xcite , and attempts to use chiral perturbation theory information was elaborated _",
    "e.g. _ in @xcite .",
    "the link between different definitions of the quark condensate , in particular between the spectral density and the condensate appearing in the operator product expansion ( ope ) , has been carefully discussed in @xcite .",
    "+ on more phenomenological grounds there are long - standing questions also on the dependence of the quark condensate on the number of flavors ( @xmath1 or @xmath2 for the physically relevant cases ) .",
    "in particular it had been advocated that the gmor relation may receive substantial corrections , and some authors indeed found significant suppression of the three - flavor case with respect to the two - flavor case  @xcite , which may be attributed to the relatively large explicit chiral breaking from the not - so - small mass of the strange quark , roughly of order @xmath14 $ \\sim$}}~}\\bar\\lam_{qcd}/3 $ ] .",
    "there are also some hints that chiral perturbation theory might not converge very well for @xmath2  @xcite , for which value lattice simulations also show large discrepancies between different collaborations and methods ( with some results with , and some other results without relative suppression of the @xmath2 condensate  @xcite ) . +",
    "our recently developed renormalization group optimized perturbation ( rgopt ) method  @xcite appears particularly adapted to estimate this quantity , since it gives a nonperturbative sequence of approximations starting from a purely perturbative expression .",
    "this allows by construction an analytic ` first principle ' calculation of this quantity and gives a nontrivial result by construction in the chiral limit , in contrast with the standard perturbative one ( see also @xcite for earlier attempts in that direction ) .",
    "morever this also gives us a very simple analytic handle on the exploration of the chiral limit for arbitrary number of flavors ( @xmath15 or @xmath16 in practice ) , which in our framework is simply contained in the known flavor dependence of the first few perturbative coefficients , while this appears more difficult at present both for chiral perturbation theory and lattice simulations .",
    "+ the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we shortly recall basics of the spectral density and its banks - casher connection with the condensate . in section",
    "iii we recall the main opt method and our rgopt version incorporating consistent rg properties .",
    "we adapt the rgopt to the spectral density case in section iii.c .",
    "section iv is a digression where we first consider the spectral density rgopt calculation in the gross - neveu model , where it can be compared with the exact result for the fermion condensate in the large-@xmath13 limit , known from standard methods .",
    "section v deals with the actual computation of the optimized spectral density in qcd at the three presently available orders ( two , three and four loops ) of the variationally modified perturbation .",
    "detailed numerical results are presented as well as some comparison with other recent determinations of the quark condensate .",
    "finally section vi is a conclusion .",
    "we shall just recall in this section some rather well - known features of the spectral density and its connection with the chiral condensate , known as the banks - casher relation  @xcite ( see also _",
    "@xcite for more details ) , to be exploited below .",
    "we thus start from the ( euclidean ) dirac operator which formally has eigenvalues @xmath17 and eigenvectors @xmath18 , d u_n(x ) = _",
    "n u_n(x ) ; + g , where @xmath19 is the covariant derivative operator and @xmath20 the gluon field . except for zero modes ,",
    "the eigenvectors come in pairs @xmath21 , with respective eigenvalues @xmath22 that depend on @xmath20 . in the discrete case ( _ i.e. _ on a lattice with finite volume @xmath23 ) , by definition the spectral density is given by ( ) _ n ( -_n^[a ] ) , [ rho_discrete ] where @xmath24 here is the dirac distribution and @xmath25 designates averaging over the gauge field configurations , = _ i=1^n ( id+m ) . the quark condensate is given by _",
    "v d^4 x |q(x ) q(x)= -2 _ _",
    "now when @xmath23 goes to infinity the operator spectrum becomes dense , so that |q q = -2 m _ 0^ , [ sd ] where @xmath26 is the spectral density .",
    "+ the banks - casher relation is the @xmath27 limit of this , giving the condensate in the relevant chiral symmetric limit as _",
    "m0 |q q = -(0 ) , [ bc ] if the spectral density at the origin can be known .",
    "this is an intrinsically nonperturbative quantity , vanishing to all orders of ordinary perturbation , just as the left - hand side of this last equation . now taking into account that for non - zero fermion masses @xmath28",
    ", @xmath29 we have from the defining relations ( [ rho_discrete ] ) , ( [ sd ] ) the following interesting tautology , ( ) = |_0 , [ disc ] @xmath26 is determined by the discontinuities of @xmath30 across the imaginary axis .",
    "the interest of this relation is that , when the quark mass is nonzero , @xmath31 has a purely perturbative series expansion , known to three - loop order at present , and its discontinuities are simply given by those coming from the perturbative , purely logarithmic mass dependence .",
    "therefore it makes sense to calculate a perturbative spectral density using the above relation .",
    "usually it will be of little use , since taking its @xmath32 limit , as relevant for the true chiral condensate , will only lead to a trivially vanishing result  @xcite .",
    "but the opt ( and in particular our rgopt version ) series modification after performing the variational @xmath33 expansion ( see below ) , is precisely the analytic handle giving a nontrivial result for @xmath34 , just as it gives a nontrivial result for @xmath35 for modified perturbative series with mass dependence .",
    "+ thus the recipe we shall apply is clear : in a first stage we calculate the purely perturbative expression of @xmath26 up to four loops , using the logarithmic discontinuities involved in eq.([disc ] ) .",
    "then we perform a variational transformation ( so - called @xmath33-expansion , defined in next section ) on the perturbative series , and solve appropriate optimization opt and renormalization group ( rg ) equations ( to be precisely defined in next section ) to derive a nontrivial , optimized value of the relation  ( [ bc ] ) .",
    "the key feature of the optimized perturbation ( opt ) method ( appearing in the literature under many names and variations  @xcite ) is to introduce an extra parameter @xmath36 , interpolating between @xmath37 and @xmath38 for any lagrangian , in such a way that the mass parameter @xmath28 is traded for an arbitrary trial parameter .",
    "this is perturbatively equivalent to taking any standard perturbative expansions in the coupling @xmath39 , after renormalization in some given scheme ( _ e.g. _ @xmath6-scheme with arbitrary scale @xmath40 ) , reexpanded in powers of @xmath33 after substituting , m m(1- ) ^a , g g. [ subst1 ] such a procedure is consistent with renormalizability  @xcite and gauge invariance  @xcite , whenever the latter is relevant , provided of course that the above redefinition of the coupling is performed consistently for all interaction terms and counterterms appropriate for renormalizability and gauge invariance , as is the case for qcd .",
    "in  ( [ subst1 ] ) we introduced an extra parameter @xmath41 , to reflect a certain freedom in the interpolation form , which will be crucial to impose compelling rg constraints , as discussed below and in our previous work  @xcite . applying  ( [ subst1 ] ) to a given perturbative expansion for a physical quantity @xmath42 , reexpanded in @xmath33 at order @xmath43 , and taking _ afterwards _ the @xmath44 limit to recover the original _ massless _ theory ,",
    "leaves a remnant @xmath28 dependence at any finite @xmath45 order .",
    "the arbitrary mass parameter @xmath28 is then most conveniently fixed by an optimization ( opt ) prescription , p^(k)(m , g,=1)_mm = 0 , [ opt ] which generally determines a nontrivial optimized mass @xmath46 , having a nonperturbative @xmath47 dependence , realizing dimensional transmutation .",
    "( more precisely , for asymptotically free theories , the optimized mass is automatically of the order of the basic scale @xmath48 , in contrast with the original vanishing mass ) . in simpler ( @xmath49 ) models the procedure may be seen as a particular case of `` order - dependent mapping''@xcite , which has been proven@xcite to converge exponentially fast for the @xmath49 @xmath50 oscillator energy levels . for higher dimensional",
    "@xmath51 renormalizable models , the behavior at large orders in  @xmath33 is more involved , and no rigorous convergence proof exists , although opt was shown to partially damp the factorially divergent ( infrared renormalons ) perturbative behavior at large orders  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless the opt can give rather successful approximations for nonperturbative quantities beyond mean - field approximations in a large variety of models  @xcite , including studies of phase transitions at finite temperatures and densities  @xcite .",
    "in most previous opt applications  @xcite , the linear @xmath33 expansion is used , namely assuming @xmath52 in eq .",
    "( [ subst1 ] ) mainly for simplicity and economy of parameters .",
    "however a well - known drawback of this conventional opt approach is that , beyond lowest order , eq .",
    "( [ opt ] ) generally gives more and more solutions at increasing orders , many being complex - valued , as a result of exactly solving algebraic equations in @xmath47 and/or @xmath28 .",
    "this problem is typically encountered first at two - loop order . in general , without some insight on the nonperturbative behavior of the solutions , it can be difficult to select the right one , and unphysical nonreal solutions at higher orders are embarrassing . as it turns out , rg consistency considerations provide a compelling way out , as developed in our more recent approach  @xcite , which differs crucially from the more conventional opt based on the linear @xmath33 expansion in two main respects .",
    "first , it introduces a straightforward combination of opt and rg properties , by requiring the ( @xmath33-modified ) expansion to satisfy , in addition to the opt eq .",

    "[ rgop ] note , once combined with eq .",
    "( [ opt ] ) , the rg equation takes a reduced simple form , corresponding to a massless theory , p^(k)(m , g,=1)=0 .",
    "[ rgred ] thus eqs .",
    "( [ rgred ] ) and  ( [ opt ] ) together completely fix _ optimized _ @xmath57 and @xmath58 values .",
    "+ remark indeed that rg invariance is in general spoiled after the rather drastic modification from ( [ subst1 ] ) , reshuffling interaction and free terms from the original perturbative expansion .",
    "this feature has seldom been considered and appreciated in previous applications of the opt based on the linear @xmath33-expansion method to renormalizable theories .",
    "thus rg invariance has to be restored in some manner , accordingly eq .",
    "( [ rgred ] ) gives an additional non - trivial constraint .",
    "intuitively , just as the stationary point opt solutions from eq .",
    "( [ opt ] ) are expected to give sensible approximations , at successive orders , to the actually massless theory , one similarly expects that combining the opt with the rg solutions of  ( [ rgred ] ) should further give a sensible sequence of best approximations to the exactly scale invariant all order result .",
    ": an earlier way of reconciling the @xmath33 expansion with rg properties was used in  @xcite : schematically it amounted to resumming the @xmath33-expansion to all orders , which can be done in practice only for the pure rg dependence up to two - loop order .",
    "these resummations came as rather complicated integral representations , rendering difficult generalizations to higher orders , other physical quantities or other models of interest .",

    "<S> our recently developed variant of variationnally optimized perturbation ( opt ) , in particular consistently incorporating renormalization group properties ( rgopt ) , is adapted to the calculation of the qcd spectral density of the dirac operator and the related chiral quark condensate @xmath0 in the chiral limit , for @xmath1 and @xmath2 massless quarks . the results of successive sequences of approximations at two- , three- , and four - loop orders of this modified perturbation , exhibit a remarkable stability . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain @xmath3 , and @xmath4 where the range spanned by the first and second numbers ( respectively four- and three - loop order results ) defines our theoretical error , and @xmath5 is the basic qcd scale in the @xmath6-scheme . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain a moderate suppression of the chiral condensate when going from @xmath1 to @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we compare these results with some other recent determinations from other nonperturbative methods ( mainly lattice and spectral sum rules ) . </S>"
