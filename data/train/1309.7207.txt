    "quantum communication not only opens up opportunities for secure communications @xcite and the teleportation of quantum states @xcite , but also is an important ingredient of the quantum internet @xcite which enables the distribution of entanglement over long distances .",
    "such a quantum internet will be useful for distributed quantum computing , distributed quantum cryptographic protocols and dramatically lowering communication complexity .",
    "since quantum information processing can offer exponential increase in computing power for some tasks as well as unconditional security , the realization of a quantum internet is an important long - term scientific and technological goal .",
    "thanks to the long coherence time of photons , photonic channels , for example , optical fibers are often used for quantum communication .",
    "nonetheless , owing to losses , the probability of successful transmission of a photon through an optical fiber decays exponentially .",
    "consequently , the efficiency of this kind of quantum communication decreases exponentially with the communication distance , which is limited to hundreds of kilometers @xcite .    to overcome such a distance limit , quantum repeaters that use repeater nodes between the sender ( alice ) and the receiver ( bob )",
    "are needed @xcite in order to enjoy the blessing , i.e. , the polynomial scaling of the efficiency with the total distance .",
    "in contrast to conventional repeaters in the classical communication , quantum repeaters can not make redundant copies of quantum signals due to the no - cloning theorem @xcite . instead , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1.eps](a ) , the standard approach @xcite to quantum repeaters equips the repeater nodes with quantum memories , and starts with entanglement generation for the quantum memories between adjacent nodes via the transmission of _ photons entangled with the memories_. then , entanglement swapping @xcite is , one after another , performed at a node that has confirmed the existence of entanglement with other repeater nodes _ by receiving heralding signals from different repeater nodes at long distances_. thus , the quantum memories are at least required ( i ) to be entangled with photons ( perhaps with a _ telecom _ wavelength for the fiber transmission ) for the entanglement generation , and ( ii ) to be able to _ preserve entanglement faithfully _ at least until receiving the heralding signals for the entanglement swapping from the _ distant _ nodes .",
    "note that , without such quantum memories , the repeater protocols are , at least , inevitably reduced into quantum relay protocols @xcite with the exponential scaling ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:1.eps ] ) .",
    "earlier proposals @xcite ( including the seminal paper @xcite of duan _ et al .",

    "probabilistic _ bell measurement on single photons that are entangled with the memories via collectively enhanced coupling @xcite for ( i ) .",
    "the protocols @xcite have a beauty of simplicity in terms of the numbers of repeater nodes and the required matter quantum memories .",
    "however , unfortunately , if the coherence time of the matter quantum memories is _ finite _ , those simple protocols @xcite are shown @xcite to scale _ exponentially _ with ( the square root of ) the communication distance ( irrespectively of employed purification schemes @xcite ) .",
    "this is caused by the necessity of the transmission of heralding signals whose communication time is proportional to _ the total distance _ due to the probabilistic nature of the bell measurements @xcite , and by the _ exponential _ dephasing or depolarization on the matter quantum memory with time ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:1.eps ] ) .",
    "thus , only remaining solutions to overcome the problem in those simple protocols @xcite would be ( i ) to boost the success probability of the bell measurement ( e.g. , to invoke a near - deterministic bell measurement @xcite on single photons ) or ( ii ) to make the coherence time infinite by equipping the matter quantum memory with fault tolerance .",
    "but , either of these spoils the claimed simplicity of the original proposals @xcite .    ) and bob ( @xmath0 ) , via repeater nodes @xmath1 ( @xmath2 here ) .",
    "the protocol starts with entanglement generation ( eg ) through transmitting photons between adjacent repeater nodes , followed by recursive applications of the entanglement swapping ( es ) .",
    "the es at a repeater node ( e.g. , 2nd - round es ) starts only after the node receives signals for heralding the successful preparation of two entangled pairs at the previous round ( 1st - round es ) .",
    "this preparation may be executed in a parallel fashion as in ( b ) by using multiple quantum memories , where the heralding signals ( hss ) are used to pick up an appropriate pair . even in this way , if the eg and es succeed only probabilistically as in refs .",
    "@xcite , the total classical communication time for the transmission of the hss alone is proportional to the total distance @xmath3 .",
    "since the matter qubits generally decay exponentially with this time , the protocols @xcite scale exponentially with ( the square root of @xcite ) the distance @xmath3 between alice and bob ( irrespectively of the employed purification schemes @xcite ) . if hss are not exchanged , the protocol @xcite is merely the quantum relay @xcite with exponential scaling .",
    ", height=113 ]    a simple solution for ( i ) or ( ii ) may be to use matter qubits satisfying divincenzo s 2nd - to-5th criteria @xcite ( initialization , quantum gates faster than decoherence time , universal gate set , and readout ) as the matter quantum memories , as in the protocols @xcite . in fact , some @xcite of them have already been shown to work even with finite - coherence - time matter qubits .",
    "however , unfortunately , the matter qubits are normally less efficient @xcite in the coupling with photons for ( i ) than the atomic ensembles , and the efficient coupling remains a very challenging technology _ even with atomic ensembles _ in spite of recent experimental advances @xcite .",
    "thus , we have not yet been able to refute divincenzo s conjecture @xcite that the efficient coupling between a matter qubit and photons for ( i)corresponding to divincenzo s _ extra _",
    "criterion @xcite  is really hard .",
    "the only theoretical solution @xcite to compensate this inefficiency to entanglement generation under reasonable coherence time is to use a lot of matter qubits at each repeater node like the protocols @xcite , i.e. , to require the matter qubits to satisfy even dinvincenzo s 1st criterion ( scalability ) .",
    "however this implies that the matter qubits in the quantum repeaters @xcite need to satisfy not only divincenzo s five ( 1st-5th ) criteria @xcite for universal quantum computation but also his ( really hard ) extra criterion .",
    "therefore , the quantum repeaters @xcite could be more difficult than universal quantum computation .",
    "this is the statement coming from the dogma @xcite of the requirements of matter quantum memories for quantum repeaters , which will remain undeniable without a future experimental breakthrough .",
    "the main point of this paper is to disprove such a dogma that a demanding matter quantum memory is necessary for accomplishing quantum repeaters . here , we present a scheme which shows that it is possible to achieve an all photonic quantum repeater with flying qubits only .",
    "our scheme uses only single - photon sources , linear optical elements , photon detectors , and a fast active feedforward technique ( less than 150 ns @xcite ) , similarly to optical universal quantum computation @xcite .",
    "however , we provide evidence that our all photonic quantum repeaters are easier than universal quantum computation @xcite , in contrast to the conventional quantum repeaters @xcite . in addition , the all photonic feature of our repeaters has the following advantages that can never be obtained in the quantum repeaters based on matter quantum memories @xcite : ( a ) the heralding signals for achieving the entanglement swapping are sent and received within the _ same _ repeater nodes , rather than between different repeater nodes at long distances , which reduces the transmission distance and time of the heralding signals to zero in principle .",
    "( b ) combined with a machine - gun - like @xcite single - photon source , this feature allows us to increase the repetition rate of our protocol as high as one wants .",
    "( c ) even if we use a single - photon source based on a matter qubit , the matter qubit is no longer required to have a deterministic interaction with photons as well as to have long coherence time ( and , of course , a matter _ quantum memory _",
    "@xcite can be diverted to a single - photon source ) , let alone to satisfy divincenzo s all the criteria @xcite .",
    "( d ) frequency converters for photons to increase the coupling to matter quantum memories @xcite and to optical fibers @xcite could be unnecessary .",
    "( e ) our protocol could work at room temperature .",
    "we draw our protocol from a concept , `` time reversal , '' underlying the distinguished findings in quantum information theory , such as the measurement - based quantum computation @xcite and the measurement - device - independent quantum key distribution ( qkd ) @xcite .",
    "in fact , our protocol corresponds to the time reversal of the conventional quantum repeaters @xcite , where entanglement swapping is performed before entanglement generation .",
    "this is an innovative part of our proposal . as an example to achieve such a time - reversed quantum repeater",
    ", we use cluster - state @xcite flying qubits rather than simple bell pairs , in contrast to existing quantum repeaters @xcite .",
    "since our protocol is the time - reversed version of a conventional quantum repeater with a polynomial scaling , our protocol follows the same scaling .",
    "we start by considering the essential of the polynomial scaling of the conventional quantum repeaters ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:1.eps ] ) , i.e. , the execution of the entanglement swapping _ upon confirming _ the existence of entangled pairs .",
    "entanglement swapping is a way to share an entangled pair over a longer distance through connecting two ( short ) entangled pairs . given an entangled state between systems @xmath4 and @xmath5 and an entangled state between systems @xmath6 and @xmath7 ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1.eps](b ) ) , it is possible to establish entanglement between systems @xmath4 and @xmath7 , by performing the bell measurement on the systems @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "hence , if distances between @xmath8 and between @xmath9 are @xmath10 and if @xmath11 is held at a single node , the entanglement swapping presents an entangled pair @xmath12 separated by distance @xmath13 .    if we regard this entanglement swapping as the one implemented in a round of a quantum repeater protocol ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1.eps](a ) ) , the entangled pairs @xmath8 and @xmath9 correspond to those prepared through the success of all the relevant entanglement generations and all the previous rounds of entanglement swapping .",
    "these entanglement preparations can be _ repeatedly _ applied to the _ specific _ qubits @xmath8 and @xmath9 until they are successfully entangled , as in proposed protocols @xcite .",
    "however , in this case , owing to the fact that the entanglement preparations for @xmath8 and for @xmath9 are independent and merely probabilistic processes , the timings of successfully producing the entangled pairs @xmath8 and @xmath9 are not necessarily the same , which would require additional memory time for waiting the joint success event .    instead , we can use a parallel procedure ( as in fig .",
    "[ fig:1.eps](b ) ) to synchronize the successes of the entanglement preparations . in this method ,",
    "each of the entanglement preparations for @xmath8 and for @xmath9 is executed _ in parallel _ by applying it to a sufficiently large number of qubits in order to successfully produce at least one entangled pair .",
    "then , the prepared entangled pairs to be referred to as @xmath8 and @xmath9 appear _ simultaneously_. although this method reduces the requirements for the memory time of qubits , it still requires the qubits to have long memory time .",
    "in fact , the node to perform the bell measurement on the counterparts @xmath11 needs to wait for the arrivals of heralding signals for specifying the qubits @xmath11 among many candidates at the same node ( as shown in fig .  [ fig:1.eps](b ) ) . then , as inferred by fig .",
    "[ fig:1.eps](a ) , we notice an inherent problem of the quantum communication : the heralding signals should travel over long distances .",
    "this transmission time is at least the classical communication time between adjacent repeater nodes , and can be extended to the order of the communication time over the total distance if the entanglement swapping works only probabilistically as in simple schemes @xcite . due to this waiting time ,",
    "the conventional quantum repeaters @xcite need memory time and the repetition rate is limited .",
    "( for the case of @xmath14 ) .",
    "the state @xmath15 has @xmath16 arms , each of which is composed of 1st - leaf and 2nd - leaf qubits .",
    "the edge represents the past application of the controlled-@xmath17 ( cz ) gate to qubits initialized in state @xmath18 , implying the existence of entanglement between them @xcite . here ,",
    "@xmath19 and @xmath20 represent a basis of a single - photon qubit .",
    "the 1st - leaf qubits correspond to the memories held by a single repeater node in the conventional repeaters ( e.g. , repeater node @xmath21 in fig .  [ fig:1.eps](b ) ) .",
    "single photons belonging to left arms ( right arms ) are to be sent to the left - hand - side ( right - hand - side ) adjacent receiver node ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:3.eps ] ) .",
    "( b ) bell measurement base d on linear optical elements and photon detectors @xcite .",
    "if it succeeds , it works as the cz gate followed by the @xmath22-basis measurements .",
    "if it fails , @xmath23-basis measurements are applied for the existing photons , and , for lost photons , it informs us of the photon losses .",
    "( c ) two adjacent @xmath22-basis measurements m@xmath24 on a linear cluster remove the qubits and directly connect their neighbors @xcite .",
    "the @xmath17-basis measurement m@xmath25 on a qubit removes the qubit @xcite .",
    ", height=132 ]    the long waiting time for the transmission of the heralding signals becomes a problem even for an all photonic quantum repeater because the waiting time corresponds to the losses for the photonic qubits . to overcome this problem ,",
    "we introduce a time - reversed all - photonic version of the conventional quantum repeaters @xcite , where the waiting time could be made zero in principle .",
    "let us begin with specifying the role of the bell measurement on the counterparts @xmath11 of the entangled pairs @xmath8 and @xmath9 in the parallel procedure of fig .",
    "[ fig:1.eps](b ) . here , the bell measurement implicitly plays a role to entangle qubits @xmath5 and @xmath6 at a moment , as it can be regarded as an entangling operation followed by @xmath22-basis measurements ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:2.eps](b ) ) .",
    "then , the time reversal of the whole process may be as follows : we first generate entanglement between @xmath11 , and then create entanglement between @xmath8 and between @xmath9 , which is followed by @xmath22-basis measurements on @xmath11 . however , at the beginning of this time - reversed protocol , it is impossible to specify the qubits @xmath11 among the many candidate qubits at the same node ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2.eps](b ) ) , because the heralding signals for the specification will be given after the successful entanglement preparations between @xmath8 and between @xmath9 .",
    "thus , we propose to use the cluster state @xmath15 that has @xmath16 arms composed of 1st - leaf and 2nd - leaf qubits ( see fig .  [ fig:2.eps](a ) ) . here",
    "the 1st - leaf qubits serve as the candidate qubits at the same node and any pair of the 1st - leaf qubits is completely connected by edges that respectively show the existence of entanglement . then , since every pair of the 1st - leaf ( candidate ) qubits in the state @xmath15 is already entangled , in contrast to conventional repeater protocols @xcite , we are not required to perform the ( possibly probabilistic ) bell measurement on the qubits @xmath11 , let alone to specify the qubits @xmath11 _ in advance_. thus , the only remaining task at this point is to execute the @xmath22-basis measurements on the qubits @xmath11 according to the heralding signals that are to be given _",
    "later_.    as we have seen , the 1st - leaf qubits of the state @xmath15 correspond to quantum memories at a single repeater node in the conventional repeaters .",
    "in this analogy , the 2nd - leaf qubits serve as the single photons to supply entanglement to the 1st - leaf qubits between adjacent repeater nodes , i.e. , they are used for entanglement generation process . to see this ,",
    "let us consider a process to connect 1st - leaf qubits @xmath26 and @xmath27 in repeater node @xmath28 of fig .",
    "[ fig:3.eps ] . since the 1st - leaf qubits @xmath26 and @xmath27 are respectively entangled with the 2nd - leaf qubits @xmath29 and @xmath30 , if a linear - optics - based bell measurement of fig .",
    "[ fig:2.eps](b ) on the 2nd - leaf qubits @xmath29 and @xmath30 succeeds , the 1st - leaf qubits @xmath26 and @xmath27 are entangled , and they become the candidates for the qubits @xmath11 that are to receive the @xmath22-basis measurements . on the other hand , if the bell measurement fails owing to the photon losses of the 2nd - leaf qubits or the bunching effect of the photons , we apply @xmath17-basis measurements on the 1st - leaf qubits @xmath31 .",
    "this @xmath17-basis measurements remove the corresponding arms without affecting the entanglement structure of the other arms of @xmath32 according to the rule of fig .",
    "[ fig:2.eps](c ) .",
    "this connection process for the 1st - leaf qubits can be executed in parallel for any arm of the state @xmath15 , which corresponds to the parallel entanglement generation ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1.eps](b ) ) in the conventional quantum repeaters in fig .  [ fig:1.eps](a ) .",
    "note that the connection process requires the heralding signals from the 2nd - leaf qubits to the 1st - leaf qubits .",
    "if the 1st - leaf qubits were matter qubits that are stationary at a repeater node , the heralding signals would still be exchanged between adjacent repeater nodes , requiring the transmission time ranging from hundred microseconds to milliseconds .",
    "thus , the role of the 1st - leaf qubits could be still challenging for matter - qubit quantum memories from the current status @xcite .",
    "however , in our proposal , the 1st - leaf qubits are composed of single - photon qubits .",
    "thus , the 1st - leaf qubits can be sent with the 2nd - leaf qubits , which holds the transmission time of the heralding signals to a minimum , i.e. , the _ local _ active feedforward time . however",
    ", this causes an alternative problem that we need to apply single - qubit measurements on the the 1st - leaf qubits _ faithfully _ even under the _ photon losses _ as well as _ small errors _ of the transmission .",
    "but , since the transmission is performed merely between adjacent repeater nodes and the losses and the channel errors are thus independent of the total distance , they can be overcome by invoking a loss - tolerant scheme to execute a single - qubit measurement for the 1st - leaf qubits , say a protocol of varnava _ et al .",
    "more specifically , instead of the state @xmath15 , we use its encoded version @xmath33 , i.e. , the complete - like cluster state @xmath33 with the encoded 1st - leaf qubits that are colored in gray in fig .",
    "[ fig:3.eps ] . an explicit method to prepare the state @xmath33 locally with linear optical elements , single - photon sources , photon detectors , and a high - speed active feedforward technique",
    "is given in secs .",
    "[ se : basic ] and [ se : preparation ] of appendix , which determines the preparation time that is to be translated into the corresponding photon - loss probability .    the encoding of the protocol of varnava _ et al . _",
    "@xcite is done by replacing a qubit being to receive a single - qubit measurement under loss with an encoded qubit composed of plural physical qubits .",
    "the loss - tolerant measurement is performed with an arbitrary high success probability via only single - qubit measurements on the physical qubits , as long as the loss probability for the physical qubits is less than 50 % ( corresponding to the loss of a 15-km optical fiber ) .",
    "thus , in our protocol , the loss for the 1st - leaf qubits should be less than 50 % by adjusting the transmission distance .",
    "this limitation corresponds to an analogy of the one on the quantum memory in the conventional quantum repeaters , although they differ in the types of noises [ loss and depolarization ( or dephasing ) ] .",
    "in addition to the tolerance to the loss , as seen in secs .  [",
    "se : error - rud ] and [ se : num - rud ] of appendix , remarkably , it turns out that the scheme of varnava _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite allows us to perform @xmath17-basis or @xmath22-basis measurement _ faithfully even under general errors_. thus , this scheme highly fits with our repeater scheme that needs ( loss - tolerant ) @xmath17-basis or @xmath22-basis measurements only .",
    "notice , however , that varnava _",
    "s scheme is less robust and loss - tolerant when non - pauli measurements are performed . since universal optical quantum computing @xcite requires such non - pauli measurements , varnava _ et al .",
    "_ s scheme requires more overhead and has a much lower error threshold in the case of universal optical quantum computing .",
    "this highlights the difference in the performance of varnava _ et al . _ s scheme in the two applications  quantum repeaters and universal optical quantum computation .",
    "to see how our protocol runs more precisely , we describe the whole protocol . in the repeater",
    ", all the repeater nodes between alice and bob separated by distance @xmath3 are classified into two sets , called source nodes @xmath34 and receiver nodes @xmath35 .",
    "the source nodes and the receiver nodes are placed alternatively and at regular intervals , and adjacent source nodes ( adjacent receiver nodes ) are separated , say @xmath36 apart .",
    "in addition , the arms of the state @xmath15 are classified into the right - hand and left - hand sets as in fig .",
    "[ fig:2.eps](a ) .",
    "then , the repeater runs according to the protocol in fig .",
    "[ fig:3.eps ] .",
    "if we use our protocol in fig .  [ fig:3.eps ] for qkd , since alice and bob s raw key is virtually regarded as the one that is obtained by measurements on alice and bob s entangled pairs _ before _ starting our repeater protocol , alice and bob s qubits in fig .",
    "[ fig:3.eps ] can be virtual @xcite .",
    "moreover , since a possible correction to their qubits after the protocol is merely the application of a ( unitary ) pauli operation , this correction corresponds to bit flips on their raw key .",
    "in addition , since every repeater node requires no classical communication with the other nodes according to the protocol of fig .",
    "[ fig:3.eps ] , the time required for each trial of the protocol is determined only by the number of the local active feedfowards used in steps ( ii ) and ( iii ) of the protocol .",
    "but this is merely one time ( of the bell measurements ) , because the loss - tolerant @xmath22-basis and @xmath17-basis measurements in the step ( iii ) require no active feedforward ( see sec .",
    "[ se : error - rud ] of appendix ) .    without any need of quantum memories , our all photonic",
    "quantum repeater scheme works not only in qkd , but also in many other quantum information processing protocols such as non - local measurements @xcite and cheating strategies @xcite in position - based quantum cryptography @xcite . in those protocols ,",
    "entanglement , once generated , is consumed immediately to generate classical output strings .",
    "for this reason , no quantum memory is needed in the protocol ( see a flexibility of our repeater protocol in sec .  [",
    "se : tot ] of appendix ) .",
    "furthermore , pauli errors can be taken care of off - line ( i.e. , in the classical communication phase of the protocol ) .    for protocols that demand strictly a quantum output state , of course",
    ", quantum memories are needed .",
    "for instance , suppose alice would like to transfer a quantum state to a distant observer , bob via quantum teleportation @xcite .",
    "suppose further that bob insists on keeping the final state as a quantum state ( as he has no idea what measurement , if any , he might wish to perform in future ) . in this case",
    ", the very fact that the final state is quantum means that the protocol requires effectively quantum memories with memory time in the order of classical communication time between alice and bob .",
    "however , even in this case , in contrast to the standard quantum repeaters @xcite as in fig .",
    "[ fig:1.eps ] , the memory time required in the quantum teloportation based on our repeater protocol scales only _ linearly _ with communication distance @xmath3 like the speediest protocol @xcite , differently from _ polynomial _ or _ subexponential _ scalings of the conventional ones @xcite , which leads to greater suppression of the errors of the quantum memories ( see the details in sec .",
    "[ se : tot ] of appendix ) .",
    "as expected from the time - reversed - like construction of our protocol itself , the average of the total photon number @xmath37 consumed in our protocol to produce an entangled pair between alice and bob scales only polynomially with the total distance .",
    "in addition , the average rate @xmath38 of our protocol to produce an entangled pair with a single repeater system is in the order of the repetition rate @xmath39 of the slowest devices among single - photon sources , photon detectors , and active - feedforward techniques , which is in a striking contrast to the conventional repeaters @xcite whose rates are restricted by the communication time between adjacent nodes ( from hundred microseconds to milliseconds ) , at least .",
    "moreover , individual depolarization caused by the channel errors is suppressed exponentially , thanks to the special robustness of the protocols of varnava _ et al . _ for @xmath17-basis and @xmath22-basis measurements and to faithful transmission of a single photon over a short distance .",
    "the details are given in sec .",
    "[ se : repeater ] of appendix .    to show the scaling of our protocol explicitly , we present @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and the average fidelity @xmath40 of the obtained entangled pair for two cases . here",
    "we assume that photons always run in optical fibers with the transmittance @xmath41 for distance @xmath10 ( @xmath42 km ) .",
    "in addition , we suppose that the optical fibers have small errors when they are used to connect distant repeater stations ( @xmath43 apart ) , and the errors of the fiber with length @xmath43 can be described as an individual depolarizing channel with error probability @xmath44 .",
    "we also assume to use single photon sources with efficiency @xmath45 , photon detectors with quantum efficiency @xmath46 , and active feedforward techniques less than 150 ns . for the choice of @xmath47  km ( @xmath48  km ) , @xmath49  km , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52  khz , and @xmath53 ( @xmath54 )",

    "if alice and bob use the direct transmission of single photons emitted by a 10  ghz single - photon source , in order to share an entangled pair , they need to consume , on average , @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) single photons and to take @xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) years .",
    "this striking contrast highlights the exponential superiority of our repeater protocol to the existing photonic protocols @xcite .",
    "in addition , the rate @xmath38 of our protocol is at least 5 order of magnitude better than those of the standard repeater schemes @xcite .",

    "<S> here we show that such a requirement is , in fact , unnecessary by introducing the concept of all photonic quantum repeaters based on flying qubits . as an example of the realization of this concept , we present a protocol based on photonic cluster state machine guns and a loss - tolerant measurement equipped with local high - speed active feedforwards . </S>",
    "<S> we show that , with such an all photonic quantum repeater , the communication efficiency still scales polynomially with the channel distance . </S>",
    "<S> our result paves a new route toward quantum repeaters with efficient single - photon sources rather than matter quantum memories . </S>"
