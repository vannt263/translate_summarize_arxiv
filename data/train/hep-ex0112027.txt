    "many important discoveries in high energy physics were announced in the rencontres de moriond series .",
    "for example , at the 1987 rencontres de moriond in a presentation by h. schroeder , the argus collaboration described the surprising discovery of large @xmath1 mixing@xcite .",
    "the implications of this observation were important for the experimental program on cp violation .",
    "as a result , the theoretical proposal of bigi , carter and sanda@xcite that there would be large cp asymmetries in hadronic @xmath2 decays to cp eigenstates became experimentally feasible .",
    "this initiated the program which would eventually lead to the plans for the high luminosity @xmath3 b factories .",
    "two international high luminosity @xmath0 @xmath2 factories have now been completed and are collecting data in the united states ( pepii / babar ) and japan ( kekb / belle ) @xcite,@xcite .",
    "the goal of these experiments is to measure cp asymmetries in the @xmath2 system and test the foundations of the standard model .",
    "the accelerators were commissioned with remarkable speed starting in late 1998 .",
    "the experiments starting physics data taking in 1999 . by the time of the xxxvi",
    "rencontres de moriond in winter 2001 , there were hints ( at the 1.7@xmath4 level ) of cp violation from both babar and belle .",
    "in the summer of 2001 , these two experiments announced the observation of the first statistically significant signals for cp violation outside of the kaon system .      in 1973 ,",
    "kobayashi and maskawa ( km ) first proposed a model where @xmath5 violation is incorporated as an irreducible complex phase in the weak - interaction quark mixing matrix  @xcite .",
    "the idea , which was presented at a time when only the @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 quarks were known to exist , was remarkable because it required the existence of six quarks .",
    "the subsequent discoveries of the @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 quarks , and the compatibility of the model with the @xmath5 violation observed in the neutral @xmath12 meson system led to the incorporation of the km mechanism into the standard model , even though it had not been conclusively tested experimentally .",
    "the unitarity of the ckm matrix implies that the existence of three measurable phases . in the `` nihongo '' convention ,",
    "these are denoted @xmath13 while at slac these angles are usually referred to as @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively .    a non - zero value of @xmath16 results in the time dependent asymmetry @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the cp eigenvalue ( @xmath19 )",
    ", @xmath20 denotes the mass difference between the two @xmath21 mass eigenstates and @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the proper time for the tagged-@xmath2 and @xmath5 eigenstate decays , respectively .",
    "the @xmath24 sign corresponds to the case where the @xmath21 and @xmath25 are in an even l orbital angular momentum state , the @xmath26 sign obtains for odd l states .",
    "a determination of @xmath27 thus provides a measurement of @xmath28    we note that due to the restrictions of quantum mechanics , time integrated asymmetries at the @xmath29 resonance ( which corresponds to the @xmath26 sign in the above equation ) are identically zero .",
    "therefore , one must make time dependent measurements . since the pairs of b mesons",
    "are produced nearly at rest in the usual arrangement at threshold , the @xmath29 center of mass frame must be boosted .",
    "this is accomplished by the use of beams with asymmetric energies .",
    "for example at kek - b , @xmath30 , ( at pep - ii , @xmath31 ) and the typical @xmath2 meson decay length is dilated from @xmath32 m to @xmath33 m , which is measurable with solid - state vertex detectors close to the interaction point . at the symmetric cesr storage ring which uses equal energy beams , these measurements are not possible .",
    "the @xmath0 @xmath2 factory experiments require substantial improvements in accelerator technology to achieve luminosities in excess of @xmath34 and data samples with integrated luminosities of o(@xmath35 fb@xmath36 ) as well as some improvements in detector technology .",
    "the properties of the b factory accelerators are summarized in table  1 .",
    "the properties of the individual bunches are not dramatically different from what had been achieved at conventional storage rings such as cesr . instead to obtain high luminosity , the asymmetric b factories use double storage rings and very large numbers of bunches .",
    "this is a domain of accelerator operation which had not been fully explored previously and to avoid instabilities involving coupling of bunches requires the operation of complex feedback systems .    to minimize parastic collisions between incoming and outgoing bunches , kek - b chose the crossing angle approach while slac takes advantage of the energy asymmetry and uses magnetic separation to achieve this separation .",
    "a small crossing angle of @xmath37 mrad had been successfully used at cesr to achieve high luminosity .",
    "kek - b employs a somewhat larger @xmath38 mrad crossing angle .",
    "there is still some worry that coupled oscillations of the longitudinal and transverse degrees of the beam ( synchro - betatron oscillations ) may be excited , so kek - b continues r+d to develop special rf cavities to rotate the bunches so that they collide head on at the interaction point .",
    "the magnetic separation approach gives rise to somewhat larger experimental backgrounds and imposes tight constraints on the engineering of the interaction region .",
    "the performance achieved by both accelerator complexes in a very short time is quite remarkable .",
    "both started physics running in 1999 . by the end of the summer of 2001",
    ", pep - ii had integrated about 40 fb@xmath36 while kek - b had integrated 33 fb@xmath36 .",
    "the peak luminosity for pep - ii was @xmath39/@xmath40/sec while kek - b had achieved @xmath41/@xmath40/sec . in the case of kek - b ,",
    "the beam currents are still far below the design values .",
    "( also note that the operating parameters currently used are constantly changing and somewhat different from those in the design ( table 1 ) ) .",
    "the experimental measurements of cp violation require tagging of the @xmath2 flavor , measurement of the time dependence of the decay and high momentum particle identification . as shown in table  2 , in contrast to the accelerators , the detectors are quite similar with the exception of the particle identification systems@xcite,@xcite .     & & + & & ler & her & ler & her + energy & @xmath42(gev ) & 3.5 & 8.0 & 3.1 & 9.0 + luminosity & @xmath43 & & + collision mode & & & + circumference & @xmath44(m ) & & + beta function & @xmath45(cm ) & 100/1 & 100/1 & 37.5/1.5 & 75/3 + tune shift & @xmath46 & & + emittance & @xmath47(nm ) & 19/0.19 & 19/0.19 & 64/2.6 & 48.2/1.9 + energy spread & @xmath48 ) & 7.7 & 7.2 & 9.5 & 6.1 + total current & @xmath49(a ) & 2.6 & 1.1 & 2.14 & 0.98 + no . of bunches &",

    "@xmath54 & 28 & 60 & 10 & 20 +    the most challenging requirement for the detector is the detection of short lived vertices .",
    "the experiments at both @xmath2 factories use double - sided silicon strips to deal with this requirement .",
    "these have been used previously at aleph , delphi , and at cleo ii and iii . nevertheless , the implementation is still far from routine .",
    "the other difficult requirement for the detector is the separation of kaons from pions . at high momentum , this is needed to distinguish @xmath55 from @xmath56 .",
    "the former is a spectator @xmath57 mode which is used to determine one of the angles in the unitarity triangle while the latter is an example of a gluonic penguin @xmath58 decay .",
    "similarly , the experiments must distinguish the cabibbo suppressed mode @xmath59 from the much more abundant and kinematically similar cabibbo favored mode @xmath60 . at lower momenta , particle identification is essential for flavor tagging .",
    "two approaches for high momentum particle identification have been implemented .",
    "both are based on the use of cerenkov radiation . at belle ,",
    "aerogel cerenkov radiators are used .",
    "blocks of aerogel are readout directly by fine - mesh phototubes which have high - gain and operate comfortably in a 1.5 tesla magnetic field . since the threshold for the aerogel is around 1.5 gev , below this momentum k/@xmath61 separation is carried out using high precision time - of - flight scintillators with resolution of 95 ps .",
    "the aerogel and tof counter system are complemented by de / dx measurements in the central drift chamber .",
    "the de / dx system provides k/@xmath61 separation around 2.5 gev in the relativistic rise region and below 0.7 gev . for high momentum kaons ,",
    "an efficiency of 88% with a misidentification probability of 9% has been achieved .    at babar ,",
    "cerenkov light is produced in quartz bars and then transmitted by internal reflection outside of the detector through a water tank to a large array of phototubes where the ring is imaged .",
    "the detector is referred to by the acronym dirc .",
    "it provides particle identification over the full momentum range for particles that are energetic enough to reach it .",
    "additional particle identification is provided by de / dx measurements from the drift chamber and from the 5-layer silicon detector system .    for tracking ,",
    "both b - factory experiments use conventional drift chambers with a low - z helium based gas to minimize multiple scattering and sr ( synchrotron radiation ) backgrounds .    to detect photons and electrons , the @xmath2 factory detectors use large arrays of csi(tl ) crystals located inside the coil of the magnet .",
    "these were used previously with great success by the cleo ii experiment . in babar and belle ,",

    ", there are 569 over a background of 223 .",
    "the event yields from babar are similar .",
    "they observe a total of 1230 events over background of 200 .",
    "it is clear that the cp eigenstate samples that are used for the cp violation measurements are large and clean .    to identify the flavor of the accompanying @xmath2 meson , leptons , kaons , charged slow pions from @xmath92 decays , and energetic pions from two - body @xmath2 decay ( e.g. @xmath93 )",

    "babar first separately tags leptons and then kaons .",

    "are then used in the cp fit for belle . to incorporate this information in their analysis , babar performs a simultaneous fit to the flavor tagged and cp eigenstate data samples .",
    "the @xmath107 vertex is determined using lepton tracks from @xmath108 or @xmath109 decays , or prompt tracks from @xmath110 decays .",
    "the @xmath111 vertex is determined from well reconstructed tracks not assigned to @xmath107 .",
    "tracks that form a @xmath112 are not used . for belle ,",
    "the typical vertex - finding efficiency and vertex resolution ( rms ) for @xmath113 ( @xmath114 ) are @xmath115 and @xmath116 , respectively .",
    "note that the resolution on the tag side includes a large additional contribution from charm decay .",
    "for babar , the rms resolution in @xmath117 is 180@xmath118 m and their vertexing efficiency is 97% .",
    "once the tag and cp eigenstate vertices are reconstructed , the proper time is calculated from @xmath119 .    examination of the time dependent distributions from the two experiments ( figs .",
    "[ babar_fig2 ] ,  [ belle_fig2 ] ,  [ belle_fig3 ] . ) shows clear indications of cp violation .",
    "the raw time distributions for the @xmath21 and @xmath120 samples are indeed asymmetric .",
    "this is most striking in the belle figure .",
    "thus , cp violation is visible even in the raw time distributions",
    ". the time dependent asymmetry distributions for the @xmath84 samples are indeed opposite as expected . finally , the flavor tagged samples show no time dependent asymmetry",
    ".    to extract the values of the cp violating parameter , the two experiments perform unbinned maximum likelihood fits to the time distributions of the tagged and vertexed events .",
    "the fits take into account the effects of background , vertex resolutions and incorrect tagging .    in the summer of 2001 , the first significant measurements of the cp violating parameter @xmath121 were obtained by belle and babar .",
    "belle finds @xmath122 with a statistical significance of greater than six standard deviations@xcite .",
    "babar finds @xmath123 with a significance of 4.1 standard deviations@xcite .",
    "the results are based on data samples of comparable size ( 31 million and 32 million @xmath124 pairs , respectively ) . as discussed above ,",
    "the efficiencies and resolutions of the two experiments are also quite comparable .",
    "however , the two measurements are only marginally consistent .",
    "larger data samples and additional more precise measurements will be required to fully reconcile these two results .",
    "experimental work on the determination of the other angles @xmath125 and @xmath126 has just started . to obtain precise results that test the validity of the standard model , much larger data samples will be required . below i briefly describe some of the possible approaches .    to measure @xmath125 ( a.k.a @xmath127 ) ,",
    "the two most promising approaches involve the use of the decay modes @xmath128 and @xmath129 .",
    "the former is an example of cp eigenstate and is the most straightforward approach .",
    "the interference in this mode between the direct decay and the decay via mixing leads to a cp violating asymmetry as in the charmonium decay mode @xmath130 .",
    "however , there are several additional complications .",
    "the decay amplitude for @xmath131 contains a contribution from a tree diagram ( @xmath132 ) as well as a cabibbo suppressed penguin diagram ( @xmath133 ) .",
    "the penguin contribution is not negligible and has a weak phase that is different from the phase of the larger tree amplitude , which is zero in the usual parameterization .",
    "therefore the time dependent asymmetry , proportional to @xmath134 , which is measured is not equal to @xmath135 but instead will have a large unknown correction .",
    "the presence of the extra contribution also induces an additional time dependent term proportional to @xmath136 .",
    "this is called penguin pollution .",
    "there are a number of other purely experimental complications .",
    "the branching fraction for the @xmath131 decay is somewhat small . using @xmath137 @xmath138 pairs babar",
    "finds @xmath139 @xcite , while using a sample of @xmath140 @xmath138 pairs belle finds @xmath141 @xcite . moreover , even after the application of high momentum particle identification , the cp eigenstate signal sits on a large continuum background .",
    "the signal to continuum background ratio is a function of the tag method ; this effect must be taken into account in the cp extraction . the conventional continuum suppression variables are also correlated with tagging .",
    "there is still residual background from misidentified @xmath142 as well .    despite these difficulties ,",
    "the first attempts to determine @xmath143 using the @xmath144 mode have started .",
    "babar reports results of a preliminary fit which gives @xmath145 .",
    "belle expects a sensitivity of @xmath146 and will present a result soon .",
    "the size of the correction for penguin pollution in @xmath147 is unknown .",
    "the method which requires the least data but has the largest theoretical uncertainty involves the measurement of the branching fractions of the @xmath148 and @xmath149 decay modes .",
    "the underlying idea is to compare decays where the interference of the penguin and tree amplitudes are different to extract about information about the phase @xmath126 .",
    "for example , if @xmath150 , then the interference term is constructive for @xmath142 and destructive for @xmath131 , leading to a ratio for the widths of the two modes greater than one .",
    "conversely , if @xmath151 then a @xmath152 ratio less than unity is expected .",
    "the current data somewhat favor @xmath150 whereas the indirect ckm fits prefer @xmath153 .",
    "the interpretation of this discrepancy is still unclear .",
    "a theoretical industry has been developed to extract the maximum possible information on @xmath126 from these and related decay modes@xcite .",
    "however , it has been argued by some theorists that other smaller diagrams or final state interaction effects may invalidate these analyses@xcite,@xcite , @xcite .    another method to determine @xmath126 uses the cabibbo suppressed decay mode @xmath59@xcite . in the case",
    "that @xmath154 , where @xmath107 is a cp eigenstate such as @xmath155 , two amplitudes with different weak phases will interfere .",
    "the asymmetry and rate again involve the phase of @xmath156 .",
    "this method is theoretically cleaner than @xmath157 but requires extremely large data samples .",
    "the current yield of @xmath158 events from belle is @xmath159 events in a 21 fb@xmath36 data sample@xcite .",
    "this yield may be increased by about a factor of two by including additional cp eigenstates of the @xmath160 meson .",
    "another approach is to use doubly cabibbo suppressed decays ( dcsd ) of the @xmath160 meson . in this case",
    ", the event yield is much smaller but the direct cp asymmetries are much larger@xcite .",
    "measurement of a time dependent asymmetry in the mode @xmath161 also gives information on the angle @xmath126 . in this case , however , the asymmetry is proportional to @xmath162 .",
    "the time dependence is also more complicated than in the case of a simple cp eigenstate such as @xmath130@xcite . to reconstruct @xmath161 ,",
    "one uses a partial reconstruction technique where the @xmath163 and the low momentum pion from the @xmath164 decay are observed but the @xmath165 meson is not reconstructed .",
    "this increases the number of useable signal candidates by roughly an order of magnitude .",
    "initial mc estimates indicate that , however , that even with the partial reconstruction method , 200 fb@xmath36 ( which corresponds to 17000 lepton tagged signal events ) will give a precision of @xmath166 for @xmath167 in this channel@xcite",
    ".    for the methods described above one usually measures a trigonometric function of one of the angles such as @xmath168 .",
    "in such a case , there often exists multiple solutions or ambiguities for the angle itself ( e.g. four solutions for @xmath169 from the initial @xmath168 measurements ) .",
    "one can not simply discard the solutions that are not consistent with the standard model .",
    "instead to resolve these ambiguities , requires difficult high statistics measurements of quantities that depend on other functions of the angles such as @xmath170 .",
    "in addition to the program of measuring the angles of the unitarity triangle , there is also the question of whether there are new cp violating phases from new interactions or physics beyond the standard model . at the moment , such new phases are completely unconstrained .",
    "one way to attack this question is to measure the time dependent cp asymmetry in penguin modes such as @xmath171 or @xmath172 and compare it to the asymmetry in @xmath130 . in the absence of new physics",
    ", they should be equal .",
    "however , if there are new physics contributions in penguin loops these asymmetries will differ substantially . again",
    "an order of magnitude more data is needed for stringent tests@xcite,@xcite .",
    "this search for new physics in cpv will be one of the most interesting aspects of the next phase in b factory physics .",
