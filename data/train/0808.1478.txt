    "the analysis of one dimensional spin chains is a useful approach to the modeling of quantum computers @xcite .",
    "this class of systems has been deeply studied in the thermodynamic limit @xcite ; however , experimental and theoretical difficulties impose strong bounds on the realization of large scale systems , and this has boosted a high interest in finite size systems @xcite .",
    "the investigation of the last few years has focused on entanglement @xcite in diverse finite - size models , by means of direct diagonalization @xcite .",
    "these studies were boosted by the recent discovery that entanglement can detect the presence of quantum phase transitions @xcite .    in this article",
    "we exactly diagonalize the xy model with periodic boundary conditions , describing a one dimensional chain made up of a finite number of two level systems ( @xmath0-spins ) with nearest neighbors coupling , in a constant and uniform magnetic field .",
    "the xy model is a class of hamiltonians distinguished by a different value of the anisotropy coefficient , which introduces a different coupling between the @xmath1 and the @xmath2 components of the spins ( in particular the isotropic case , corresponding to the case in which the anisotropy coefficient vanishes , is known as xx model ) .    as for infinite chains @xcite ,",
    "the diagonalization procedure is divided in three steps : the jordan - wigner transformation , a deformed fourier transform ( generalizing the discrete fourier transform ) , and a gauge dependent bogoliubov transformation .",
    "after the jordan - wigner transformation the hamiltonian , expressed as a quadratic form of annihilation and creation operators of spinless fermions , is characterized by the presence of a boundary term @xcite whose contribution , which scales like @xmath3 in the calculation of real physical quantities , can not be neglected for finite size systems . however , this boundary term vanishes in fourier space if the discrete fourier transform is deformed with a local gauge coefficient , depending on the parity of the spins anti - parallel to the magnetic field @xcite",
    ".    there will emerge two classes of fermions , coupled and single ones ( in particular for the xx model there are only single fermions ) .",
    "the last step of the diagonalization procedure is the unitary bogoliubov transformation , given by a continuous rotation for fermion pairs and by a discrete one for single fermions .",
    "we will show that this unitary transformation is gauge dependent , since it is given by two possible continuous rotations for fermion pairs and by either the identity or the charge conjugation operator for single fermions . from this",
    "it follows that the sign of the dispersion relation is completely arbitrary , apart from the constraint that fermions belonging to the same pair have the same sign .    from the arbitrariness of the bogoliubov transformation it follows that a possible expression for the diagonalized hamiltonian is such that for successive intervals of the magnetic field the vacuum energies of the two parity sectors alternatively coincide with the ground state and the first excited level : we will exhibit this mechanism of `` competition '' between vacua .",
    "finally we show that in finite size systems one can find the `` forerunners '' of the points of quantum phase transition of the thermodynamic systems .",
    "they are associated to single bogoliubov fermions and arise at the level crossings between physical and unphysical states . at the values of the magnetic field corresponding to the forerunners the second derivative of the ground state energy scales as @xmath4 . since in the xx model",
    "all bogoliubov fermions are single , one re - obtains the well known result that in the thermodynamic limit the anisotropic case presents two discrete quantum phase transitions whereas the isotropic or xx model is characterized by a continuous one @xcite .",
    "we consider @xmath5 spins on a circle with nearest neighbors interaction in the @xmath6 plane and with a constant and uniform magnetic field along the @xmath7-axis .",
    "the hilbert space is @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the hilbert space of a single spin , and @xmath10 , labeling the positions on the circle , is the ring of integers @xmath11 with the standard modular addition and multiplication .",
    "the xy hamiltonian is given by @xmath12\\;,\\ ] ] with @xmath13 where @xmath14 acts on the @xmath15-th spin and may be represented by the pauli matrices , @xmath16 @xmath17 is a constant with dimensions of energy and @xmath18 and @xmath19 $ ] are two dimensionless parameters : the first one is proportional to the transverse magnetic field and the second one is the anisotropy coefficient and denotes the degree of anisotropy in the @xmath6 plane , varying from @xmath20 ( xx or isotropic model ) to @xmath21 ( ising model ) .",
    "as is well known , in the thermodynamic limit , the diagonalization of the xy hamiltonian is achieved by means of three transformations : the jordan - wigner ( jw ) , fourier and bogoliubov ( bgv ) transformations .",
    "we will analyze in detail how the topology of the circle will induce a deformation on these transformations in finite size chains .",
    "the jordan - wigner transformation is based on the observation that there exists a unitary mapping @xmath22 between the hilbert space of a system of @xmath5 spins @xmath23 and the fermion fock space @xmath24 of spinless fermions on @xmath5 sites . here , @xmath25 where @xmath26 for @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 is the projection onto the subspace of antisymmetric wave - functions @xcite .",
    "in order to simplify the notation , in the following we will use the above isomorphism and will identify the two spaces @xmath30 without making no longer mention to @xmath31 . by virtue of this identification",
    "we can consider the canonical annihilation and creation jw fermion operators @xcite @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 is the operator counting the number of holes ( or spins down ) to the left of @xmath15 @xmath35    note that the above definitions rely upon the following ( arbitrary ) ordering of @xmath10 : @xmath36<[1]<\\dots<[n-1]$ ] , where @xmath37=k+n\\mathbb{z}$ ] .",
    "in particular , if the choice of the successive elements can be considered natural , and is well adapted to the hamiltonian ( [ eq : xyhamiltonian ] ) , the choice of the first element @xmath36 $ ] is totally arbitrary and is related to the choice of a privileged point of the circle .",
    "the jw operators anti - commute both on site and on different sites ( see ) whereas the pauli operators anti - commute only on the same site : @xmath38 @xmath39 and @xmath40=0 \\quad \\mathrm{for}\\ ;   i \\neq j.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from equations - one sees that the terms in the hamiltonian describing the coupling between spins @xmath36 $ ] and @xmath41=[-1]$ ] , when written by means of the jw operators , is characterized by an operator phase , at variance with the other coupling terms ; for example the terms coupling the spins along the @xmath1 axis become @xmath42\\ } , \\label{eq : sigmaxsigmax}\\\\ \\sigma_{[-1]}^x\\sigma_{[0]}^x = e^{{\\mathrm{i}\\pi \\left(\\bm{n}_\\downarrow+1\\right ) } }   \\left ( c_{[-1]}c_{[0]}^\\dagger + c_{[-1]}c_{[0 ] } + c_{[0]}^\\dagger c_{[-1]}^\\dagger + c_{[0]}c_{[-1]}^\\dagger \\right )   \\label{eq : sigmaxsigmax0,_n-1},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the number operator , @xmath43 counts the total number of spins down in the chain .",
    "this introduces some difficulties in the diagonalization of the hamiltonian , because its expression written in terms of the fermion operators is characterized by the presence of a boundary term with the same operator phase found in equation ( [ eq : sigmaxsigmax0,_n-1 ] ) @xmath44 \\nonumber\\\\   -\\left({\\rm e}^{{{\\rm i}\\pi \\bm{n}_\\downarrow}}+1\\right)\\left[(c_{[-1]}c_{[0]}^\\dagger + c_{[0]}c_{[-1]}^\\dagger ) + \\gamma(c_{[-1]}c_{[0]}+ c_{[0]}^\\dagger c_{[-1]}^\\dagger ) \\right]\\bigg\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the thermodynamic limit the boundary term can be neglected since it introduces corrections of order @xmath45 ; the problem is then reduced to the diagonalization of the so called `` c - cyclic '' hamiltonian @xcite and can be easily achieved by means of the discrete fourier transform @xmath46 since we are interested in finite size systems , with finite @xmath5 , the boundary term can not be neglected .",
    "the main difficulty introduced by the boundary term in the hamiltonian ( [ eq : fermionic xy hamiltonian ] ) is that it breaks the periodicity of the jw operators , due to the arbitrary dependence of the phase @xmath47 on the ordering of the spins on the circle .",
    "this phase clearly depends on the state the hamiltonian @xmath48 is applied to .",
    "however , equation can be simplified by noting that the parity of the number of spins down , @xmath49 is conserved @xmath50=0,\\ ] ] although not so the spin - down number operator @xmath51 itself .",

    "since parity is conserved ( equation ) the hamiltonian can be decomposed as @xmath58 and the analysis can be separately performed in each parity sector , where @xmath55 acts as a superselection charge .    in each sector",
    "the xy hamiltonian can be diagonalized by deforming the discrete fourier transform by means of a local gauge @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) , @xmath61 the inverse formula reads @xmath62 this deformation preserves the anti - commutation relations in the fourier space @xmath63 @xmath64 .",
    "the local gauge @xmath65 can be determined by imposing that the fourier transforms of ( [ eq : sigmaxsigmax ] ) and ( [ eq : sigmaxsigmax0,_n-1 ] ) have the same form .",
