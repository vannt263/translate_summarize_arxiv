    "several years ago , linde and vilenkin pointed out the possibility that the core of a localized topological defect could inflate under appropriate conditions in a process that was aptly dubbed topological inflation @xcite .",
    "see also @xcite .",
    "a common characteristic of such defects is some non - linear scalar field ( the higgs field ) forced up in its core into a constant excited false vacuum state , falling through a transition layer to the true vacuum value remote from the core .    without further refinement ,",
    "a configuration of this type will always collapse , with or without gravity .",
    "the dynamics of this basic configuration , a so called false vacuum bubble , was studied in detail in the eighties by various groups , perhaps most comprehensively by blau , guendelman and guth ( bgg ) in ref.@xcite where references to the earlier literature are provided .",
    "their work was motivated , like linde and vilenkin s , by the possibility that a false vacuum bubble could provide a seed for an inflationary universe @xcite .",
    "they discovered that the essential radial dynamics of the scalar field is captured extremely accurately by a simple one dimensional mechanical caricature of the field configuration .",
    "this led them to consider the dynamics of a spherically symmetric region of false vacuum which is separated by a domain wall from an infinite true vacuum exterior ( with zero energy density ) .",
    "the energy momentum tensor of false vacuum is inherently homogeneous and isotropic .",
    "the birkhoff theorem then constrains the spacetime it occupies to coincide with some patch of de sitter space ; the exterior is simply the schwarzschild geometry truncated at the false vacuum boundary . in this model , it becomes clear that collapse does not necessarily spell the demise of the false vacuum interior .",
    "when gravity is taken into account , there are ( at least ) two spherically symmetric configurations associated with each sufficiently low value of conserved arnowitt - deser - misner ( adm ) mass @xmath3 . while the smaller of the two , no matter what its initial radius , will always collapse to a vanishing radius , the other will inflate ; but unexpectedly from an euclidean perspective , not at the expense of the exterior .",
    "this peculiar state of affairs is possible because the expansion occurs behind a minimal surface ( a wormhole ) in the schwarzschild geometry connecting the false vacuum core to the exterior .",
    "while false vacuum is destroyed by the motion of the boundary , it is created exponentially faster in the interior .",
    "the wormhole itself , however , always collapses into a black hole .",
    "field theories admitting static configurations when gravity is turned on were first constructed in the eighties .",
    "self - gravitating global monopoles were considered by barriola and vilenkin @xcite ( with additional insight provided in ref .",
    "gauge monopoles were considered by gibbons @xcite , with the subsequent numerical solution of the static einstein - yang - mills - higgs equations by ortiz @xcite and breitenlohner , forgacs and maison @xcite . however , as gibbons himself realized the balance of forces is not always possible when gravity is acting . as linde and vilenkin were later to show , if the symmetry - breaking scale is increased towards the planck scale , at some point the interior radius will exceed the corresponding cosmological horizon , triggering the inflation of the interior . a bound exists beyond which static configurations necessarily become unstable .",
    "this process was studied by sakai _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite by numerically solving the dynamical einstein - higgs and einstein - yang - mills higgs equations .",
    "the inflating core was not unlike an inflating false vacuum bubble .",
    "in ref.@xcite two of us showed how the model of a false vacuum bubble could be adapted to imitate the dynamics of a self - gravitating global monopole under these extreme conditions .",
    "technically this was simple , involving the substitution of the barriola - vilenkin geometry describing the asymptotics of a global monopole for the exterior schwarzschild geometry of the former .",
    "it was possible to capture , remarkably faithfully , the essential underlying physics of topological inflation found earlier by sakai _",
    "the onset of topological inflation was very clearly indicated at @xmath7 ( in natural units ) .",
    "the details of topological inflation in a gauge monopole are very different . here , the only long range field is the magnetic coulomb field and the total energy is finite . however , the source resides on the core boundary which suggests the same mechanical caricature : de sitter space inside , a domain wall , but with the reissner - nordstrm geometry outside .",
    "the structure of this geometry is very different from schwarzschild .",
    "if the conserved charge to mass ratio of the configuration @xmath8 , the analyically continued geometry possesses horizons , otherwise it contains a naked singularity . in this paper , we examine the above model in detail .",
    "though simple in principle , a thorough analysis of the three - dimensional parameter space @xmath9 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) is complicated in practice .",
    "we will focus on the identification of the regimes of parameter space admitting solutions which are either static , collapsing or inflating within the core and we will examine the fate of these solutions as the relevant boundaries in parameter space are crossed .",
    "our results can be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "fix @xmath1 : for each non - vanishing value of @xmath2 up to some critical value @xmath10 there exists a unique stable and globally static configuration with a fixed core radius ( a monopole ) with mass @xmath11 .",
    "stable radial oscillations of this configuration exist for all @xmath5 above @xmath12 .",
    "these are the only solutions with @xmath5 .",
    "+ now raise @xmath3 above @xmath2 but below some value @xmath13 : 2 .",
    "\\(i ) for non - vanishing values of @xmath2 up to some value @xmath14 lower than @xmath10 , this radially oscillating solution falls through an event horizon and is terminated by the collapse of the exterior into a reissner - nordstrm black hole ; ( ii ) for higher ( but bounded ) values of @xmath2 radial oscillations lie within the inner horizon and get isolated by the collapse of the exterior ( a monopole inside a black - hole ) ; an inflating bounce co - exists with these solutions ; ( iii ) if @xmath2 or @xmath3 lies outside these two regimes , but @xmath3 lying above some minimum value , there is a unique inflating bounce .",
    "the bounce occuring in these three regimes can be characterized roughly as follows : ( i ) the course of the bounce lies within a single asymptotically flat region ( afr ) and it resembles closely the bounce exhibited by a false vacuum bubble ( with @xmath6 ) ; ( ii),(iii ) the course of the bounce spans two consecutive afrs . however , from the point of view of either region it resembles a monotonic false vacuum bubble ; in all cases , the expansion takes place behind an event horizon .",
    "these configurations are analogues in this model of the topologically inflating solutions observed numerically by sakai @xcite for large @xmath1 .",
    "4 .   all collapsing and monotonic solutions are ruled out as either unphysical or inconsistent with asymptotically flat boundary conditions .",
    "aspects of the model have been examined before . indeed in the sixties",
    ", it received its first incarnation in dirac s proposal ( without spin ! ) of a model of the electron as a closed charged conducting membrane surrounding a vacuum interior@xcite .",
    "tachizawa , maeda and torii focused on the stability of the monopole from the point of view of catastrophe theory  @xcite , modeling the monopole core and exterior as we do but without an intermediate surface layer , a model originally proposed by lee , nair and weinberg , in ref .  @xcite . in this limit",
    ", the core radius exceeds the cosmological horizon when @xmath15 , signaling inflation .",
    "however , without the domain wall to transmit energy from the false vacuum , all dynamical possibilities are not faithfully represented .",
    "more recently , alberghi , lowe and trodden @xcite considered the model within the context of the anti- de sitter space / conformal field theory correspondence .",
    "for this purpose they catalogued accurately the possible trajectories of the charged false vacuum bubble .",
    "however , they did not consider how these trajectories depend on the values of @xmath2 , @xmath3 or @xmath1 and they did not consider the parameter regime @xmath16 corresponding to stable configurations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ model ] we introduce the model . in sec .",
    "[ ssfk ] , we determine all possible trajectories of the wall radius consistent with set values of @xmath2 , @xmath1 and @xmath3 . in sec .",

    "[ bwtst ] - [ bgg ] , we identify all physically interesting solutions and compare our results with earlier work . finally , in sec .",
    "[ con ] we conclude with a few brief comments .",
    "the configuration possesses a core in which the magnitude of the higgs field approximates its false vacuum value , @xmath17 ; in the core region , the potential energy of the higgs field dominates the gradient energy in the higgs and gauge fields .",
    "we model this core by a spherically symmetric region of false vacuum , and for the mexican sombrero potential    @xmath18    this energy density is given by @xmath19 .",
    "the corresponding spacetime is then described by the de sitter line element    @xmath20    where @xmath21 the hubble parameter @xmath22 appearing here is given by @xmath23 .",
    "we will suppose that there is a charge @xmath2 localized on the boundary of this core .",
    "the energy in the neighborhood of the core is dominated by field gradients .",
    "this boundary layer can be modeled as a relativistic domain wall with a surface energy density ( tension ) @xmath24 , @xcite .    outside the core",
    ", the energy density in the massive fields falls off exponentially fast so that , to a good approximation , the energy in matter is dominated by the asymptotic magnetic coulomb field .",
    "the spherically symmetric exterior spacetime can then be modeled as a region of the reissner - nordstrm geometry described by the line element    @xmath25    where    @xmath26    here @xmath3 is the conserved adm mass which represents the combined material and gravitational binding energy of the configuration .",
    "@xmath3 must be positive .",
    "appearing here is related to the magnetic charge of the monopole @xmath27 by @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 is the gauge coupling strength . ]    in this model , we attempt to capture the dynamics of the bubble wall in a single variable , the radius @xmath31 of the core boundary or wall .",
    "following ref.@xcite , it is straightforward to cast the einstein equations at the wall in the form    @xmath32    where we define @xmath33 , and the overdot represents a derivative with respect to proper time .",

    "[ eq = dbeta ] ) can be recast as    @xmath38    where the overdot represents a derivative with respect to proper time rescaled by @xmath22 .",
    "the potential @xmath39 appearing here can be expressed in either of two equivalent forms    @xmath40    the einstein equations determine the local geometry in the neighborhood of the wall .",
    "the sign of the functions @xmath41 encodes the boundary conditions required to construct the complete global geometry .",
    "finally , we note that , in terms of the symmetry - breaking scale @xmath1 , the ratio @xmath0 is given by    @xmath42    here , we have exploited the fact that @xmath43 and @xmath44 with constants of proportionality @xmath45 and @xmath46 of order unity . for a gut symmetry - breaking scale , @xmath47gev , @xmath48 . for planck scale @xmath1 , @xmath49 .",
    "the potential @xmath50 given by eq.([eq = u ] ) is parametrized by three positive dimensionless parameters characterizing the mass , the charge , and the symmetry breaking scale @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath0 respectively .",
    "we will consider sections of constant @xmath0 and of constant @xmath2 of this three dimensional space . because both @xmath51 and @xmath52 have @xmath1 folded into their definition , when we vary @xmath0 , it is appropriate to undo the ` natural ' scaling depending on @xmath1 one exploits for calculational purposes .    in general , the potential is always negative .",
    "in addition , @xmath53 at @xmath54 and as @xmath55 so that it always possesses at least one maximum . to discuss the qualitative dependence of the potential on the values of @xmath3 , @xmath2 and @xmath0 , it is useful to identify the following boundaries on the parameter space :    1 .   the location of the extremal exterior reissner - nordstrm geometry , @xmath56 : @xmath57 + if @xmath58 the complete reissner - nordstrm geometry possesses an ( outer ) event horizon at @xmath59 and an ( inner ) cauchy horizon at @xmath60 which are given by the two positive solutions of @xmath61 where @xmath62 is given by eq.([am ] ) .",
    "when @xmath57 , the two horizons possess the same radius ( this does not mean that they coalesce ) . if , however , @xmath5 there are no horizons and the corresponding spacetime possesses a naked singularity at @xmath63 .",
    "this criterion is independent of @xmath0 .",
    "+ this boundary will play an important role in determining the limit of stability of a self - gravitating object .",

    "this topology is not , however , always relevant physically",
    ". this will be the case if the well is not accessible physically .",
    "+ the domains of @xmath71 which are physically accessible in the potential are determined by the mass shell condition eq.([masss ] ) . to locate these domains we examine where the critical points of the potential lie with respect to the fixed ` energy ' @xmath72 .",

    "there are always at least two trajectories , each with a single turning point , one bounded and another unbounded .",
    "when we refer to them below we will describe the trajectory initially at rest at the turning points : the former collapses from a finite maximum to zero radius ; the latter expands from a minimum to infinite radius .",
    "+ whether the trajectories we have described translate into configurations which are compatible with the boundary conditions is a question which we address in the following section .",

    "the core interior is represented by the spacetime region to the left of the trajectory on this diagram .",
    "it is clear that turning points of the motion of the wall must occur within the static regions i and iii with @xmath89 where the killing vector @xmath90 is timelike , and @xmath91 spacelike . in particular , oscillatory solutions",
    "are necessarily confined to these regions ( one should not rule out , a priori , an oscillating core boundary in region i with an inflating interior ) .",

    "technically , this is because @xmath132 along the remaining trajectories , be they monotonic , collapsing or expanding bounces .",
    "this is just as well : while gravity might be sufficiently strong to provoke the collapse of a charged object , one would not expect this to happen if the charge exceeds @xmath3 ; nor would one expect gravity to promote the explosion of a monopole .",
    "a negative @xmath35 corresponds , in the regime @xmath5 , to an exterior which is a finite region of the reissner - nordstrm geometry with an unphysical naked singularity at the antipode .",
    "the spatial geometry is a closed three sphere which is inconsistent with the asymptotically flat boundary conditions that we associate with an isolated monopole . because it contains a naked singularity we consider it unphysical .",
    "an immediate corollary of the above observation is the existence of a lower bound on the mass of a physically realistic configuration , static or otherwise : ( i ) if @xmath133 , so that stable static solutions exist , this value is @xmath12@xcite ; ( ii ) if @xmath134 and there do not , a bound is provided by @xmath2 . the later bound will be sharpened below .    for a constant @xmath0 , the mass of a static solution @xmath135 which has the same functional form as the minkowski space limit .",
    "in sec .  [ ssfk ] , bounce solutions were identified in the parameter regime bounded below by @xmath73 .",
    "such solutions coexist with the quasi - static solutions we have described in each of _ qsi _ and _",
    "qsii_.    we again discard the collapsing solution as an unphysical closed universe with a naked singularity .",
    "however , the expanding bounce trajectories are consistent with the boundary conditions .",
    "the regime admitting bounces partitions naturally into three regions : _ qsi _ ( as before ) , @xmath137 ( which contains _ qsii _ ) indicated on fig .",
    "[ regmq ] , and @xmath138 indicated on fig .",

    "the expansion in all cases occurs behind a throat geometry which subsequently collapses into a reissner - nordstrm black hole ( in the same way as it does outside the oscillatory counterparts discussed in sec .",
    "[ bwtst ] ) this expansion does not occur at the expense of the exterior geometry but ( with respect to a reasonable slicing of spacetime ) does get cut off from the exterior by the formation of a black hole .",
    "qualitatively , the bounce occuring in _ qsi _ is very similar to the false vacuum bubble bounces described in ref.@xcite .",
    "note that the penrose singularity theorem places an obstruction to its formation from non singular initial conditions .",
    "accessible or not classically , this trajectory is of interest because of the possibility of tunneling into it from its bounded counterpart , @xcite .",
    "the bounce occuring in _ b _ is very different , contracting from infinity in one asymptotically flat region of the reissner - nordstrm spacetime to a minimum on the left hand side of the penrose - carter tower before expanding to the corresponding asymptotically flat region on the next floor of the tower .",
    "clearly , the full bounce is not a physically realizable configuration .",
    "the physically relevant leg of any bounce is its expansion from a stationary minimum .",
    "bounces correspond either to the thermodynamical or quantum mechanical materialization of a configuration .",
    "interestingly , there is a narrow window in the neighborhood of this stationary initial configuration where the penrose theorem does not present any obstruction to the classical assembly of the _ b _ bounce from non - singular initial conditions .",
    "these are the analogues of topologically inflating gauge monopoles .    in his numerical simulations of the dynamics of gauge monopoles ,",
    "sakai also observed inflating monopoles ( corresponding to our bounces ) to co - exist with collapsing monoples ( corresponding our @xmath129 ) .",
    "bounces occuring in the narrow regime of parameter space indicated @xmath138 occur in a convex potential . whereas the asymptotics of such bounces are identical to those for _",
    "b _ , their minimum occurs now on the right of the penrose - carter tower .",
    "in contrast to _ b _ bounces , the penrose theorem implies that its formation is unphysical on the complete expanding leg . on its contracting leg , there is no asymptotically flat spatial slice containing the trajectory .",
    "we must conclude that such trajectories are unphysical .",
    "we have already discounted monotonic trajectories with @xmath5 . the boundary @xmath66 partitions the remainder of this regime . in the bounded regime @xmath142 the potential is convex and both @xmath34 and @xmath35 possess definite signs .",
    "we have indicated the trajectory by @xmath143 on fig .",
    "[ rnh4 ] . in the remaining unbounded region with @xmath144 , the effective potential develops a well and both @xmath34 and @xmath35 change sign in the course of their evolution .",
    "apart from this single dynamical detail , motion is qualitatively identical in both regimes .",
    "is this motion physical from a classical point of view ?",
    "the part of the trajectory lying within @xmath115 necessarily contains a naked singularity in its exterior ; moreover , the interior initially contains a three - sphere s worth of de sitter space .",
    "the trajectory is clearly unphysical in this regime .",
    "in fact , the penrose theorem forbids the assembly of such a trajectory by classical means@xcite .",
    "we dismiss this solution as unphysical .",
    "it would appear that there are no physical monotonic trajectories in this model .    if we take in account the elimination as unphysical of all possible trajectories in both @xmath143 and @xmath138 , the lower bound on the mass of any asymptotically flat configuration is raised .",
    "as @xmath2 increases above @xmath109 , the lower bound follows the line @xmath57 , then @xmath145 , and finally @xmath146 .",
    "we are finally in a position to examine the limit @xmath147 , where the model had better reproduce the `` false vacuum bubble '' investigated by blau , guendelman and guth and others .",
    "briefly , for each value of @xmath3 below some critical mass @xmath148 , both collapsing and expanding bounce motion occur as we described in our introduction . for masses above @xmath148 all motion is monotonic : the core expands from a singular zero radius behind the schwarzschild horizon and like the bounce described in the introduction is connected to the asymptotically flat region by a throat .",
    "though the throat collapses , the core expands forever with an inflating interior .",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite for details .",
    "both the expanding bounce and the monotonic solution violate the penrose theorem along their course @xcite .",
    "this limit should be consistent with solutions lying on the @xmath3-axis on the @xmath64 section . at first sight",
    ", however , the limit @xmath147 of our model appears to contradict their findings .",
    "specifically , there does not appear to be any analog of @xmath148 at @xmath6  the monotonic trajectories we find do not even exist in this regime . to resolve this apparent contradiction , note",
    "that , as @xmath147 in this regime , the left maximum of the potential @xmath50 occurs at ever decreasing radius ( @xmath149 ) while , simultaneously , the well depth becomes infinitely deep , @xmath150 .",
    "we also note that , as @xmath147 , the inner horizon of the reissner - nordstrm geometry appoaches zero , @xmath151 , while the outer horizon at @xmath152 becomes the schwarzchild horizon .",
    "the bounce trajectory occuring in @xmath140 thus approaches arbitrarily close to @xmath153 , the penrose window we discussed in sec .",
    "[ bouncy ] closes and the trajectory on its expanding leg becomes indistinguishable from a monotonically growing false vacuum bubble .",
    "it is clear that we should identify @xmath148 with @xmath13 at @xmath6 , not with @xmath73 .",
    "we also note that below @xmath13 , in _ qsi _ the a quasi - oscillatory trajectory approaches @xmath54 arbitrarily closely and become indistinguishable from a collapsing bounce .",
    "the expanding bounce , as we commented earlier does not suffer any signifacant local change .",
    "we have examined in some detail the dynamics of a charged false vacuum bubble within the thin wall approximation .",
    "we claim that , with the identification of @xmath2 with the magnetic charge @xmath27 ( related to the electric charge by @xmath154 ) the model mimics the radial dynamics of a spherically symmetric magnetic monopole .",
    "in particular , the model provides a valuable guide to understanding the physics which underlies both the onset of instability of a static monopole as well as the conditions which need to be met to produce a topologically inflating object .",
    "it would appear that inflation does not necessarily require dialling up the symmetry - breaking scale @xmath1 ; an inflating solution only requires that the adm mass be sufficiently large , which is possible in principle for arbitrarily low values of @xmath1 or @xmath2 . in this respect ,",
    "the monopole we consider differs from the ` global ' monopole discussed in @xcite where inflation is only possible when @xmath1 is raised above the planck scale .",
    "however , it should also be pointed out that in a field theory of monopoles the mass is itself a function of @xmath1 .",
    "it is not clear if the high mass and low @xmath1 inflating solutions we find can be realized in practice .",
    "we note that , for every monopole which collapses into a black hole in the parameter regimes _ qsi _ and _ qsii _ , there will be a corresponding expanding bounce configuration with identical values of the conserved mass and charge . on semiclassical grounds",
    ", one would anticipate a finite amplitude for tunneling from the former to the latter .",
    "the construction of the instanton mediating this passage should provide a valuable exercise in semi - classical quantum gravity .",
    "we have considered a description of a spherically symmetric field theoretical monopole in which its core boundary is modeled as a relativistic membrane .",
    "how robust is this description when spherical symmetry is relaxed ?    in the seventies it was shown that , in dirac s extensible model of the electron , the static charged membrane is unstable to non - radial deformations@xcite .",
    "the origin of this instability is similar to that which triggers fission of the atomic nucleus ( the boundary conditions differ ) . on",
    "the other hand , in ref.@xcite goldhaber argued that a global monopole suffers from a cylindrical string - like instability .",
    "superficially , this would appear to be analogous to the spike ( zero area ) instability of a nambu - goto membrane .",
    "however , it is likely that higher curvature ( rigidity ) corrections to the nambu - goto action must be included to model the field theory when spherical symmetry is relaxed .",
    "such additions would tend to moderate ( or eliminate ) the instabilities of nambu - goto membranes .",
    "it would be interesting to explore the membrane - topological defect correspondence in greater detail .",
