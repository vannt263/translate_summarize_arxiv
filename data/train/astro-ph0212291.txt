    "prevalent theoretical models for winds launched from accretion disks ( see , e.g. , for a review ) hold that the final wind velocity is of the order of the keplerian rotational velocity of the launch point .",
    "the high velocity of observed jets from young stellar objects ( yso s ) suggests that they originate from a deep potential well @xcite , requiring the launching region to be less than an au in extent , for reasonable parameters .",
    "we therefore adopt the view that these jets are launched from a region within several stellar radii .",
    "the observations require that the flows are launched initially with large opening angles and become collimated within a few 10 s of au @xcite .",
    "since the winds become collimated along the rotational axis of the accretion disk , the collimation process must be associated with the disk . in this work ,",
    "we explore one possible explanation , that disk - associated , poloidal magnetic fields collimate a central , fast , wide - angle wind into an optical jet .",

    "[ fig_densbase ] ]    , , and studied a mechanism by which a rotating star couples to the inner edge of a conductive accretion disk via a stellar dipole magnetic field . in this model , differential rotation between the star and disk twists up the magnetic field , causing the stellar magnetosphere to expand ( or `` inflate '' ) above and below the disk .",
    "the field lines become effectively open , and material is magnetocentrifugally launched @xcite from the disk inner edge and possibly from the star .",
    "the disk inner edge spins down and moves inward , forcing together the field lines from the star and disk of opposite polarity , and instigating a reconnection of those lines .",
    "after reconnection , material at the disk inner edge accretes via funnel flow along field lines onto the star .",
    "the stellar magnetosphere begins to expand outward and diffuse into the new inner edge of the disk .",
    "again , differential rotation twists up the field , and the process repeats .",
    "this process of episodic magnetospheric inflation ( emi ) regulates both the accretion and ejection of material within the region of the disk inner edge .    following the outflow to several au , showed that the emi mechanism produces an outflow consisting of a collimated , highly structured jet and a wide angle wind .",
    "the flow speed of both components is @xmath4 100 km s@xmath0 , in agreement with observations @xcite .",
    "most of the kinetic energy and mass is contained in the wide angle component of the wind .",
    "figure 1 contains the results of a magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) simulation and illustrates the basic emi outflow",
    ".    showed that a weak magnetic field , initially aligned with the rotation axis and threading the accretion disk , did not affect the launching of an outflow via the emi mechanism .",
    "however , they were unable to address the collimation of the outflow by vertical fields at large distances because the size of their largest simulation grid reached only to 0.75 au . here , we follow up their work and show that even a weak axis - aligned field will collimate the entire emi outflow .",
    "for this work , we use the 2.5d mhd code of , which solves the ideal mhd equations with the added physics of gravity and ohmic diffusion on a group of cylindrical , nested grids .    ]",
    "figure 2 shows the results of two mhd simulations that include the effect of an initially vertical magnetic field of 0.025 gauss threading the accretion disk .",
    "the simulations in figure 2 are otherwise identical to that of figure 1 .",
    "the figure shows that the wide angle component of the wind becomes collimated to a jet radius of @xmath5 au ( where the wind kinetic energy density roughly equals the vertical magnetic energy density ) .",
    "this mechanism may be responsible for producing more powerful and physically broader jets than by the emi mechanism alone .",
    "large - scale disk fields , if present , may be generated by disk currents ( as in ) and/or could be embedded in the surface of the disk and carried outward in a disk wind @xcite , though a disk wind is not yet included in our simulations . in a realistic accretion disk , it is possible that any field present in the disk will be disordered . a disk wind would therefore be threaded by a magnetic field with polarity reversals at irregular intervals .",
    "such direction reversals do not affect the qualitative behavior of the field @xcite , so that , whether the vertical field has a constant or chaotic polarity , it will always act to collimate the flow ."
