    "quantum cosmology was initiated by dewitt @xcite in the late sixties . the canonical quantization procedure which in the twenties was the key to the theory of quantum mechanics , was again used to derive a `` schrdinger equation '' for gravity .",

    "suddenly the interest came to a hold , and the number of articles was drasticly reduced .",
    "but the interest for qc was again renewed in the eighties pioneered through the work of hartle and hawking@xcite .",
    "they based their work on the boundary condition for a quantum state of the universe .",
    "soon after , vilenkin@xcite and linde proposed their version of a suitable boundary condition .",
    "most of the previous work on qc is based on frw and desitter universe models although some authors have studied anisotropic models ( for instance @xcite ) .",
    "the spatial sections of the frw and desitter models correspond to globally homogeneous , isotropic , simply connected spaces . in recent years",
    "a paper by the mathematician thurston@xcite has drawn many a physicist s attention . his main conjecture , which still remains to be proven , claims that there are essentially 8 types of 3-manifolds . concerning cosmology and",
    "especially qc the most interesting are their compact quotients which show interesting properties@xcite . in the nineties",
    "several authors investigated locally homogeneous spacetimes with non - trivial topologies . hawking and turok @xcite studied quantum creation of hyperbolic universes in the context of the no boundary proposal .",
    "coule and martin @xcite in addition to costa and fagundes @xcite studied cosmologies with compact hyperbolic spatial sections .",
    "we also want to mention the work of fagundes @xcite already in the early eighties , in which he studies compact cosmologies which in the thurston classification are quotients of @xmath1 . in this paper we shall use a locally homogeneous anisotropic model that in the thurston classification has the covering space @xmath2 .",
    "we will not consider in any detail the covering space @xmath2 itself ( which is simply connected ) but rather one of its compact quotients , the three torus , @xmath3 ( which is a multiply connected space with a non - trivial fundamental group ) .",

    "even though these considerations were very simple and only approximative , this indicates that the effect of a simple scalar field with mass is that it reduces the effective anisotropy .",

    "constant has been derived by duncan and jensen@xcite .",
    "duncan and jensen also use three - torus as spatial sections , but they do not give any comments concerning the @xmath9 sector . apparently the only reason they use compact spatial sections is to make the spatial integration in the action finite . in this paper we will however be more interested in the tunneling boundary proposal by vilenkin@xcite .",
    "essential in this discussion is the description of the bianchi type @xmath0 from a minisuperspace point of view .",
    "if we exclude a scalar field degree of freedom , the minisuperspace will be 6-dimensional .",
    "topologically we can write the minisuperspace as @xmath265 where @xmath266 and @xmath267 is the 3-dimensional minkowski space .",
    "as the @xmath9-sector has already been discussed , we will only look at the evolution in the minkowski sector .",
    "we will also choose the lapse to be unity @xmath79 .",
    "the dewitt metric on the minkowski sector will then be : @xmath268    doing a conformal transformation we can map this metric onto a penrose - carter diagram .",
    "mapping the classical solutions ( with no dust ) into this conformal diagram we get a picture like figure [ biaenevol ] .",
    "notice that all the three different cases start off at past light - like infinity @xmath269 .",
    "they all start off as a kasner universe ( straight line ) .",
    "they end up however , at different places . for",
    "a positive - valued cosmological constant the universe ends as a desitter universe : moving along the @xmath72-axis to the time - like future @xmath270 .",
    "the kasner universe ( @xmath123 ) ends at the future light - like infinity @xmath271 , while the case @xmath114 the universe collapses again in past light - like infinity @xmath269 . the whole boundary _ except _",
    "past time - like infinity @xmath272 represents singular space - time geometries , and thus according to the tunneling boundary condition , is not allowed .",
    "however , from the calculations done in the previous chapters , there may be indications that the starting point @xmath269 is somewhat unstable concerning inclusion of a scalar field .",
    "even a rather modestly behaved scalar field effectively reduces the speed of the universe near the initial singularity to below `` the speed of light '' .",
    "the reduction of the speed of a kasner universe is shown in figure [ timelikekasner ] .",
    "this effectively changes the path s end - points , so that the universe starts off at @xmath272 .",
    "it ought to be emphasized that this is not enough to ensure regularity of the universe at the starting point , but this may indicate that there exists a homotopy of time - like paths connecting the kasner universe with the desitter solution .",
    "these different solutions will be universes with different speeds in superspace .",
    "one might say that we have given the kasner universe a mass , and the homotopy can be defined by the action of the 3-dimensional lorentz group .    in the light of this discussion we change the formulation of the tunneling proposal _ to include all universes which may be connected to universes which satisfy the regularity condition , by the action of the lorentz group in superspace .",
    "_      the tunneling wave function will have a current in superspace which points outwards at the singular boundaries of superspace . the conserved current @xmath273 which is analogous to the conserved klein - gordon current , states that its zero- component @xmath274 is a conserved entity .",
    "the zeroth component of the klein - gordon current can be interpreted as a charge , which locally can obtain both negative and positive values .",
    "also the zeroth component superspace current can be both negative and positive . in light of the tunneling proposal , these correspond to expanding and contracting solutions .    using the solutions to the wd - equation for a zero - mass scalar field , we get the `` space '' components of the superspace current to be : @xmath275 at the singular boundary @xmath276 , we use the solutions for a positive cosmological constant in the big geometry limit .",
    "the two possible solutions are the hankel functions @xmath277 .",
    "the zero - component then becomes : @xmath278 the outgoing modes are therefore the second hankel function @xmath279 and the tunneling wave functions are are a linear combinations of the functions @xmath280 the solution space of the wd equation will therefore be spanned by the solutions ( [ tunnel ] ) multiplied by the solutions from the @xmath9-sector @xmath281 .      as we have constructed the tunneling wave function we might wonder if the wave function predict an isotropic or an anisotropic universe . in the classical case we had trouble with reconstructing the frw universe in the limit @xmath150 .",
    "the frw universe appeared as if it was disconnected from the bianchi type @xmath0 solutions .",
    "this picture is drastically improved in the quantum case .",
    "if we hold @xmath93 constant , that is keeping the volume of the universe constant , and let @xmath95 approach zero from a classical point of view we have to let the function @xmath98 approach infinity . for a positive cosmological constant",
    "the limit @xmath282 is indeed a isotropic frw limit with finite spatial volume . as @xmath93 and @xmath95 are independent variables we could interpret the @xmath283 a frw limit .",
    "inserting a scalar field we saw that it also reduced the anisotropy .",
    "the anisotropy was reduced as the ratio @xmath284 .",
    "these two mechanisms for reducing the anisotropy affect the classical solutions in two different ways . whereas the reduction of @xmath95 isotropize the universe through the modular and evolutionary degrees of freedom , the inclusion of a scalar field reduces the kasner circle .",
    "thus a scalar field could also work for isotropy reduction for the kasner universe ( with infinite spatial sections ) .",
    "@xmath150 for the kasner universe is however more subtle because apparently we do not have any clear _ geometric _ meaning of the entity @xmath95 in that case .",
    "the @xmath261 enters the wave functions through the order of the hankel function .",
    "the order @xmath285 is given by @xmath286 .",
    "the factor ordering parameter is assumed to be small , so we assume that @xmath285 is purely imaginary : @xmath287 where @xmath288 .",
    "a small @xmath289 means an isotropic universe . from the integral representation of the hankel functions@xcite",
    "we can write @xmath290 apparently the wave functions are suppressed by an exponential factor as @xmath289 grows .",
    "thus the probability amplitude is exponentially damped in @xmath289 : @xmath291 .",
    "we do have to be a bit careful however because any linear combination of these wave functions is a solution .",
    "we might imagine that it had an exponentially growing prefactor in @xmath289 .",
    "let us try to estimate a reasonable prefactor by `` normalizing '' the wave functions over superspace .",
    "since the variable @xmath93 will behave as a time variable in superspace we could also say that we divide by the `` time average '' of the particular solution .",
    "the `` normalizing '' integrals @xmath292 diverge for the hankel functions .",
    "we will therefore do the following : we wick - rotate the volume element , @xmath293 so that the hankel functions @xmath294 are `` rotated '' to the bessel functions @xmath295 .",
    "this function will under reasonable conditions be square integrable .",
    "we estimate the prefactor by demanding that the wave function is normalized after a wick - rotation of the volume element .",
    "the bessel functions are related through the following equations @xmath296 we also introduce the integration measure @xmath297 which reflects the geometry of minisuperspace . the dewitt metric ( eq . [ dewittmetric ] ) will yield @xmath298 but if we assume .",
    "we would also mention that the integral is manageable for any power of @xmath93 ( provided that the integral converges ) . ]",
    "@xmath299 the resulting integral become surprisingly simple@xcite : @xmath300 using these wave functions after `` normalization '' the probability amplitude decays as @xmath301 so they predict an isotropic universe .",
    "they will exponentially decay for larger values of @xmath289 . whether this `` normalizing '' function is the right weight function is so far only speculation , but if these functions are reasonable the wave functions predict an isotropic universe .",
    "in this paper we have discussed the bianchi type @xmath0 minisuperspace model with compact spatial sections . in the classical case this removed some pathologies .",
    "the classical solutions were all written down in a way so that the solution space was manifestly factorized into three parts : a topological sector , a kasner sector and a matter sector .",
    "the kasner solutions were obtained in the limit @xmath147 where one easily could see that the modular sector becomes degenerate .",
    "choosing compact spatial sections also gave a better understanding of the topology of the 4-space .",
    "for instance the apparently flat case @xmath302 of the kasner universe was shown to have a conical singularity at @xmath156 .    in the quantum mechanical case since the ( true ) phase space has a dimension equal to the dimension of the solution space , it is easier to give a precise meaning to the wd equation .",
    "this paper has also shown the necessity of introducing compact spatial sections when one wants to quantize the model , and provides a solution to the wd equation for @xmath4 spatial sections . also a set of solutions in the @xmath9 sector",
    "have been given which had particularly nice algebraic properties .",
    "these solutions have a structure which describes a shell structure in the @xmath9 sector .",
    "it was also indicated how these solutions allow geometry changing solutions .    inserting various matter configurations in general showed isotropization of the universe .",
    "the resulting tunneling wave functions appeared as if they peaked at small anisotropy . under reasonable considerations we constructed a wave function which had an exponentially decaying probability amplitude for increasing anisotropy .",
    "this seems to agree with other authors@xcite .",
    "it is quite clear that universe models with compact spatial sections will yield many interesting and surprising results .",
    "since these possibilities only recently have come to physicist s and cosmologist s attention there is a _ lot _ of work still to be done .",
    "what we have shown in this paper is that even at the classical level , this may reveal interesting properties of cosmological models .",
