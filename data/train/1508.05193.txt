    "[ fig03 ] and [ fig04 ] show that this broadening has to be induced by the interaction of the gnr based charge sensors with the qds .",
    "more insights can be gained from the quadratic dependency of the coulomb peak current on @xmath10 ( see fig .  [ fig03](e ) ) which suggests a proportionality to the power dissipated in the cd . for typical",
    "@xmath10 used in our experiments the dissipated power ( which is most likely predominantly transferred to the cds phonon bath ) is on the order of hundreds of pw to tens of nw .",
    "however , the transfer of the thermal energy from the graphene cds to the qds is hard to explain .",
    "while detector generated phonons are regarded as a relevant origin for back action in gaas quantum dot devices  @xcite , phonon mediated energy transfer via the substrate is unlikely in carbon based devices due to the mismatch of the phonon spectra of graphene , cnts and sio@xmath1 .",
    "it is more likely that energy is transferred by photons emitted by the current passing through the etched graphene nanoribbon ( gnr ) based detectors  @xcite .",
    "photon absorption in the leads of the qd devices could in turn lead to an effective broadening of its fermi distribution .",
    "moreover , it is possible that the occupation of the stochastic qds formed in the gnr  @xcite fluctuates .",
    "this would alter the potential landscape of the capacitively coupled qd and allow charge pumping effects .",
    "averaged over time this would have the same effect as an effective increase in temperature .",
    "finally , the source - drain broadening asymmetry assumed in the model is likely to be a direct consequence of the asymmetry in the device geometry ( see figs .",
    "[ fig01](a , b ) ) where one of the qd leads is closer to the cd than the other .",
    "back action effects of graphene nanoribbon based charge detectors ( cds ) on graphene and carbon nanotube quantum dots ( qds ) have been studied .",
    "we show that the current through the qds is strongly influenced by the voltage applied to the cd . in both types of devices",
    "this voltage can lead to an enhanced transport through the qd but also to a reversal of the current .",
    "we employ a simple model considering transport only involving a single ground state which can explain the bias dependent behavior of isolated coulomb peaks .",
    "a more advanced model taking into account excited state transport and state dependent tunneling rates proves suitable to furthermore describe longer sequences of coulomb peaks .",
    "importantly , both models assume an asymmetric broadening of the fermi distribution in the leads of the qds induced by the cd .",
    "further experiments have to be conducted to obtain a better understanding of the mechanism of energy transfer between the charge detector and the qd .",
