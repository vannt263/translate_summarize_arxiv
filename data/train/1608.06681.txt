    "when fluids are confined to nanometer - scale pores , their thermodynamic and dynamic properties can significantly differ from those of bulk fluids  @xcite .",
    "simple examples of these changes are shifts of the temperatures and pressures at which phase transitions occur  @xcite , and the development of extremely high pressures  @xcite , etc",
    ". experimental studies of properties of confined fluids often presents a challenge , and in recent years much effort has been spent employing various techniques , primarily x - ray  @xcite and neutron scattering  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , very short wavelength tools are not the only ones able to shed light on the nano - confined fluid properties , but also long wavelength tools , such as ultrasonic acoustic waves .    in 1982",
    "murphy carried out the first ultrasonic study on a fluid - saturated vycor glass , which was focused mainly on sound attenuation  @xcite .",
    "this work introduced the use of ultrasound for studies of properties of matter in nanometer confinement of vycor pores , which has been employed in numerous works since then .",
    "beamish and co - workers used it to study the properties of liquid helium  @xcite and also proposed ultrasonic experiments for probing the surface area of nanoporous materials  @xcite . later ultrasonic experiments",
    "became widely used for studying phase transitions in confinement , both liquid - vapor  @xcite and solid - liquid  @xcite . among these works",
    ", it is worth pointing out the paper of page et al .",
    "@xcite , which first showed that when the pores are completely filled with a liquid - like capillary condensate , the modulus of the fluid ( n - hexane ) was not constant , but a monotonic function of the gas pressure @xmath2 ( lower pressure corresponds to lower modulus ) . moreover , they explained this regularity by the negative laplace pressures due to menisci at the liquid - vapor interfaces below saturation .",
    "more recently schappert and pelster carried out a similar experiment , but using argon at cryogenic temperatures  @xcite , and their results were consistent with the results of page et al .",
    "these studies motivated us to perform calculations of the elastic modulus of confined argon using classical density functional theory ( cdft )  @xcite and monte carlo simulations  @xcite .",
    "our calculations based on cdft reproduced the experimentally observed linear relation between the modulus and the solvation pressure ( also referred to as the adsorption stress ) , and the slope in this relation was close to the slope reported in ultrasonic experiments  @xcite",
    ". however , we did not compare this result to the bulk data .",
    "here we present simulation results for the elastic modulus of liquid argon at several different temperatures , both in bulk and under confinement in nanopores of different sizes and solid - fluid interaction strengths .",
    "we show that for all the simulated cases , the elastic modulus is a linear function of fluid pressure ( in bulk ) or laplace pressure ( in confinement ) _ with the same slope_. moreover , we show that this slope agrees well with the slope calculated from experimental reference data for bulk liquid argon .",
    "finally , we show that this slope is close to the slope calculated from the ultrasonic experiments of schappert and pelster .",
    "these comparisons demonstrate that the slope of the @xmath1 dependence is roughly constant irrespective of the confinement . to our knowledge , this common slope has not been reported previously for confined fluids .",
    "in addition to contributing to fundamental understanding of thermodynamics of confined fluids , this common slope has useful implications for ultrasonic studies of porous materials : we discuss how our result can be applied for estimating the elastic parameters of nanoporous solids from ultrasonic experiments .",
    "experimental measurements of the propagation time of ultrasonic waves give information on its velocity , which provides the information for elastic constants of materials : shear modulus @xmath3 from the shear wave velocity @xmath4 , and longitudinal modulus @xmath5 from the longitudinal wave velocity @xmath6 : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the mass density of the sample .",
    "the bulk modulus of the sample can be calculated from the two measurements as  @xcite @xmath9 for fluids , the shear modulus @xmath10 is zero and therefore the longitudinal modulus is equal to the bulk modulus @xmath11     +    while the calculation of a fluid bulk modulus from ultrasonic experiments is straightforward , the calculation of the modulus of a confined fluid from the experimental ultrasonic data is non - trivial . for a given porous sample , one can measure the logitudinal and shear moduli when it is dry ( @xmath12 and @xmath13 ) and when it is saturated , i.e. , a solid - fluid composite ( @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) .",
    "the differences between the corresponding moduli are determined by the properties of the fluid .",
    "experiments for argon adsorption in vycor glass at @xmath16  k and @xmath17  k show that the shear modulus of the sample does not change , @xmath18  @xcite , which is consistent with the fact the adsorbed argon is in a liquid - like state and the shear modulus of the liquid is zero .",
    "experiments showed that in contrast with the constant shear modulus , the longitudinal modulus of the saturated sample @xmath14 is several percent higher than the longitudinal modulus of the dry material @xmath12  @xcite .",
    "moreover , for the argon - filled pores the change of the longitudinal modulus of the sample @xmath19 is a function of equilibrium gas pressure @xmath2 . assuming that the properties of the solid do not change appreciably , this variation can be attributed to the change of the modulus of the confined fluid .",
    "schappert and pelster proposed an effective medium model to determine the longitudinal modulus of the fluid @xmath20 from the change of the longitudinal modulus of the sample @xmath21  @xcite @xmath22 where the constant @xmath23 is a function of parameters of the dry material ( porous matrix ) @xmath12 , @xmath13 and pore walls ( constituent solid ) @xmath24 , @xmath25 ( see figure  [ fig : porous ] ) .",
    "interestingly , page et al .",
    "@xcite used a similar proportionality relation , where the constant @xmath23 was a function of different material parameters , based on works of gassmann and biot  @xcite .",
    "the discussion of the constant @xmath23 is beyond the scope of the current work , but it is important to note that both approaches suggest that there should be a _",
    "direct proportionality _ between the measured @xmath21 and @xmath20 .",
    "finally , taking into account @xmath26 we can interpret the resulting longitudinal modulus as the bulk modulus of the fluid , i.e. ,  @xmath27 .      in thermodynamics",
    "the most common property that quantifies the elastic properties of a fluid is the isothermal compressibility @xmath28 , defined as @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the volume of the fluid , @xmath31 is the fluid pressure , and @xmath32 is the absolute temperature .",
    "the isothermal compressibility of a bulk or confined fluid can be straightforwardly calculated from molecular simulations ( see section  [ sec : simulations ] ) . for further consideration and for comparison with ultrasonic experiments",
    "it is convenient to discuss the reciprocal value , the isothermal elastic modulus @xmath33 it is important to note that the modulus @xmath34 is not the experimental bulk modulus determined from ultrasonic experiments .",
    "the experimental conditions are adiabatic rather than isothermal .",
    "therefore the experimentally - measured bulk modulus is actually the adiabatic modulus , i.e. , determined by a derivative at constant entropy @xmath35 : @xmath36 however , @xmath0 and @xmath34 are simply related through the heat capacity ratio @xmath37  @xcite via @xmath38 ultrasonic and calorimetric measurements for bulk fluids are well - established , and thus the values of compressibilities ( or moduli ) for many bulk fluids are readily available for a wide range of temperatures and pressures . for argon , which is considered in this work ,",
    "the reference data is given in  @xcite .",
    "strictly speaking , in order to relate @xmath34 and @xmath0 for a confined fluid , one needs to know the heat capacity ratio @xmath39 for the _ confined fluid_. however , it is unlikely that confinement has a noticeable effect on the heat capacity of argon  @xcite , and moreover on the heat capacity _ ratio _ @xmath39",
    ". therefore , we use the bulk value of @xmath39 at the corresponding temperature when converting between @xmath34 and @xmath0 for the confined fluid .",
    "note also that confinement introduces anisotropy to the fluid , and unlike the bulk fluid it is not always sufficient to describe the pressure in terms of a scalar variable .",
    "calculations of a pressure tensor for simple fluids in confinement show differences between the normal and tangential components @xcite .",
    "our previous calculations showed that the compressibility of a confined fluid should be related to the normal component of the pressure tensor .",
    "classical statistical mechanics can be used to calculate the compressibility of the fluid @xmath28 from the fluctuations of number of particles in the pore , @xmath40 , in the grand - canonical ensemble  @xcite through the relation @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 is boltzmann s constant .",
    "[ beta - fluct ] is valid when the fluctuations are normally distributed  @xcite . in the grand - canonical ensemble the fluid atoms or molecules in the pore",
    "are assumed to be in equilibrium with a reservoir , and the pressure @xmath2 of the reservoir is the pressure of a bulk fluid at the same chemical potential and @xmath32 as the fluid in the pore . typically , the reservoir contains a gas phase whose pressure , @xmath2 , differs from the pressure in the adsorbed phase , @xmath31 .",
    "here we use results from molecular simulations of argon in spherical silica pores from the grand canonical transition - matrix monte carlo ( gc - tmmc )  @xcite method .",
    "since this method was discussed and used in previous work  @xcite , the reader is directed to section  ii.b  of ref .   for a full discussion of both the simulation technique and the fluid model . in short",
    ", we modeled argon at various temperatures below its critical point both as a bulk fluid and confined in model spherical mesopores with simulation strategies identical to those in ref .  .",
    "the parameters used to model the argon fluid and silica material were identical to those in ref .",
    ", except for simulations which varied the solid - fluid interaction strength . in the base case of argon - silica ,",
    "the solid - fluid interaction parameter is @xmath44 ; to investigate the effect of varying this parameter we ran simulations at @xmath45 @xmath46 , @xmath47 relative to the base case .    for the discussion",
    "we choose pore sizes 3.0  nm , 4.0  nm and 5.0  nm . by the pore sizes we refer here to the external diameter of a spherical pore @xmath48 , the distance of a line drawn through the centers of hypothetical silica solid atoms at opposite pore wall surfaces .",
    "the internal diameter is given by @xmath49 , which well approximates the accessible volume of the pore  @xcite .",
    "lastly , we present results at temperatures of 77.7  k , 87.3  k , and 95.7  k ; the results for confined argon at 87.3  k are taken directly from ref .  , the results for bulk at 87.3  k and all the results at the other temperatures are from new simulations .",
    "gc - tmmc simulations provide the compressibility ( or elastic modulus ) of the fluid as a function of the relative gas pressure @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the saturation pressure for the fluid at the specified temperature . at @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the capillary condensation pressure ,",
    "a mesopore is filled with a liquid - like capillary condensate .",
    "such system is under the action of capillary ( laplace ) pressure , which causes stretching of the fluid .",
    "note that the tension of the liquid in the mesopores is clearly seen in the x - ray diffraction patterns  @xcite and through the adsorption - induced deformation of the mesopores  @xcite .",
    "the laplace pressure can be written as a function of @xmath50 using the kelvin - laplace equation @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the gas constant and @xmath56 is the liquid molar volume .",
    "since @xmath56 varies only slightly with @xmath50 , for simplicity we use @xmath56 corresponding to the bulk liquid at saturation conditions in the results that follow . for @xmath57 , @xmath58 is necessarily negative and is indicative of the stretched nature of the fluid .",
    "therefore , plots of the calculated modulus @xmath34 for the confined fluid versus laplace pressure show the variation of the fluid s elastic properties as a function of the actual pressure in the adsorbed phase .",
    "figure  [ fig : argon ] gives these dependences for three modeled confined systems : 3  nm , 4  nm and 5  nm pores at 87.3  k ( gc - tmmc results from ref .  ) .     as a function of pressure @xmath2 or laplace pressure @xmath58 for bulk and confined systems , respectively .",

    "1  gpa  @xcite .    for bulk liquids the slope @xmath72 in the @xmath1 relation has been also discussed .",
    "wilhelm pointed out that for a number of organic liquids this slope is practically independent of the temperature , and almost independent of the fluid , always about @xmath75  @xcite .",
    "wilhelm also proposed an analytic expression for the slope @xmath72 based on the carnahan - starling equation of state  @xcite with a cohesive term  @xcite .",
    "his calculations were in good agreement with the experimental data for hydrocarbons .",
    "using wilhelm s theory we calculated the slope @xmath72 for argon , using 3.48    as a hard sphere diameter  @xcite and the reference data for the triple point from  @xcite , yielding @xmath76 , which is fairly close to the values of @xmath72 calculated directly from reference data ( table  [ table ] ) .",
    "we have to note that @xmath72 is not a universal constant : its value for water ( ca . @xmath77",
    "@xcite ) and most solids  @xcite is significantly lower .",
    "although one of us  @xcite had previously pointed out that @xmath34 has a linear dependence on pressure and the slopes agreed well with the experimental data from ref . , we did not compare the confined fluid results to those of a bulk fluid . in the present work , we aggregate the results of simulations and experiments for both bulk and confined argon at multiple temperatures , and are thus able to conclude that",
    ", irrespective of whether the fluid is bulk or confined , its isothermal elastic modulus approximately satisfies a linear @xmath1 relation ( tait - murnaghan equation ) with slope @xmath72 that is only weakly dependent on either temperature or the nature of confinement .",
    "therefore , our results show that nanoconfinement , while strongly affecting @xmath34 of the fluid ( essentially , making the fluid stiffer ) , does not affect its pressure derivative @xmath78 , the parameter @xmath72 in the linear relation eq .  [ linear ] .",
    "we note that it is not the confinement _ per se _ that increases @xmath34 ; the modulus is increased due to strong solid - fluid attraction forces . in the case of solid - fluid interactions",
    "that are weaker than fluid - fluid interaction ( e.g.  water in hydrophobic confinement ) , the opposite effect is observed : the value of @xmath34 in confinement is lower than the modulus of the bulk fluid  @xcite .    as a general rule ,",
    "higher density makes a fluid stiffer , i.e. , increases the modulus @xmath34 .",
    "that is indeed true for each of the data series in this work considered independently .",
    "however , the data in figure [ fig : density ] clearly show that although the confined fluid has lower density than liquid argon ( near saturation ) at 87.3  k , it has a higher modulus",
    ". therefore , increased average density is not sufficient to explain the increase in @xmath34 for a confined fluid .",
    "specifically , we note in figure  [ fig : density ] that the 3  nm pore has generally lower average density than the other pores , yet has the highest modulus .",
    "it is likely that the reason for higher modulus of the confined fluid is due to contribution of the first 1 - 2 layers of fluid next to the pore wall .",
    "these layers are known to be solid - like , therefore the `` local '' modulus for these layers should be much higher than for molecules near the pore center . experimental data for @xmath34 of solid argon at 77  k is ca .",
    "1.4  gpa  @xcite , i.e. , larger than @xmath34 for liquid argon by a factor of three . for smaller pores ,",
    "the contribution of these solid - like layers to the overall modulus is higher and therefore the modulus of fluids in small pores significantly exceeds the bulk liquid value  @xcite . unlike the modulus itself ,",
    "the slope @xmath72 of @xmath1 dependence for solid argon is very close to that of the liquid , @xmath79  @xcite .",
    "this small difference explains our observation for confined fluids : while the modulus is noticeably higher for a given average density ( due to the contribution of surface layers ) , the slope @xmath72 is the same , because the solid - like layers still have the same @xmath72 .",
    "the simulation results in figure  [ fig : material ] test whether this common @xmath72 extends to other materials for a given fluid .",
    "that figure clearly indicates that a linear trend near @xmath80 is preserved regardless of solid - fluid interaction strength and the @xmath72 parameters in table  [ table : material ] fall in the same bounds ( @xmath71 ) provided that the confinement is solvophilic ( @xmath81 ) .",
    "this further suggests that the @xmath72 parameter can be treated as a thermodynamic property of the fluid , not of the confining material , confinement dimensions , or temperature .",
    "table  [ table : material ] also shows another new trend , that @xmath72 appears to increase monotonically with solid - fluid strength , and prompts the question of whether further increasing @xmath82 would take @xmath72 outside the range of @xmath71 . we do not expect a further increased @xmath82 to alter @xmath72",
    "outside this range as packing constraints on the fluid near the material surface will prevent excessive densification of the confined fluid .",
    "conversely , the weakening of @xmath82 to solvophobic conditions does lead to @xmath72 outside the range of the bulk fluid .",
    "this is , however , expected due to the altered physics of the solvophobic confinement , in which the confined fluid is rarefied near the surface ( compared to solvophilic confinement ) and behaves more like a coalesced liquid than a typical capillary - confined fluid@xcite .",
    "our findings for the @xmath72 of confined fluids further extend the broad commonality of this thermodynamic parameter , widely discussed in the past for the bulk fluids  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the fundamental interest , this result imposes an important constraint on the analysis of ultrasonic data for fluid - saturated porous materials .",
    "effective medium approaches , be it the one proposed by schappert and pelster  @xcite , or the one based on biot - gassmann equations  @xcite , suggest that there is a direct proportionality between the change of the measured longitudinal modulus of the porous sample @xmath21 and modulus of the fluid @xmath20 ( e.g. , eq .",
    "the proportionality coefficient @xmath23 in this relation depends on the elastic properties of the dry porous sample , and the properties of the solid walls .",
    "while the former can be easily measured , the latter are hard to measure directly , and indirect methods for estimating them may be non - trivial and involve certain assumptions about the microstructure  @xcite .",
    "however , the general result of this work , i.e. , the common slope @xmath72 of the @xmath1 line , imposes a constraint on eq .",
    "[ em ] , and unambiguously determines the value of the constant @xmath23 in this relation .",
    "therefore , one can readily compare the slope of the experimentally measured dependence of @xmath83 to the slope @xmath72 of the reference @xmath34 data for the same fluid and to calculate the translation coefficient @xmath23 from this comparison .",
    "analysis of the value of @xmath23 based on an effective medium approach will then provide the information of the elastic constant of the pore walls ( solid constituent ) .",
    "we have studied the elastic modulus - pressure dependence @xmath1 for confined and bulk liquid argon . for bulk fluids and solids this dependence",
    "is well described by a linear function @xmath84 , known as tait - murnaghan equation .",
    "we have used transition - matrix monte carlo simulations to calculate the isothermal elastic modulus @xmath34 of argon in bulk and confined in silica mesopores .",
    "our calculations have shown that although @xmath34 is strongly affected by confinement , its dependence on pressure can still be described by the linear tait - murnaghan equation .",
