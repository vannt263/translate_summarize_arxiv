    "opacity may likely be a major factor in this diversity , so understanding how the dynamics and energy transfer change with varying opacity is quite important .    in figure ( [ fig : tphoto1 ] ) i show the effect of opacity on the temperature at the photosphere of a synchronously rotating planet at an orbital distance of @xmath17 au . as is clear from figure ( [ fig : tphoto1 ] ) , the higher the opacity the lower the night - side temperature .",
    "night - side temperatures in a planet with high interstellar opacities are around @xmath18 k , while the night - side of a planet with lower opacity is around @xmath19 k. this difference can be easily understood by considering that the depth at which radiation is deposited changes with opacity . for large opacities",
    "the stellar energy is deposited high in the atmosphere where cooling timescales are relatively short .",
    "the flow is not able to effectively advect energy around the planet before it cools .",
    "for the lower opacity model , the stellar energy is deposited deeper in the atmosphere where cooling timescales become comparable to the crossing timescale .",
    "the efficiency of energy advection is also evident in the lobes that extend onto the night - side at both the equator ( in the eastward direction ) and the poles ( in the westward direction ) .",

    "the clearly evident banded structure in the simulations of 1 and 3 days is a direct result of the latitudinal coriolis force @xmath23 .",
    "the formation of the equatorial jet comes about as eastward moving material feels a force funnelling it toward the equator , while the oppositely moving westward flow is pushed toward the poles .",
    "faster rotation results in stronger funnelling and narrower jets .",

    "latitudes persists . however , the day - night temperature difference in this simulations is smaller .",
    "the jet velocity , driven by the temperature differential , is substantial smaller and the resulting temperature and velocity structure on the night - side is quite variable .",

    "the physics behind this inversion can be understood in terms of the different opacities for optical and infrared photons .",
    "the opacity of the impinging stellar energy ( optical ) can be significantly different then the opacity of the reprocessed infrared radiation from the planet .",
    "although a one - dimensional wavelength dependent radiative transfer model implicitly accounts for these effects by modelling the impinging stellar spectrum , full radiative hydrodynamical models must use average grey opacities due to computational considerations . in order to encapsulate this physics within a full hydrodynamical model",
    "i have calculated separate grey opacities for the incident stellar light and the reprocessed light .",
    "both are still functions of the local temperature and pressure , but the stellar opacities are weighted toward optical wavelengths .    furthermore , to allow for the inversion i have de - coupled the thermal and radiative energy components .",

    "the term proportional to @xmath29 represents the exchange of energy between the thermal and radiative components through the emission and absorption of the lower energy photons .",
    "the @xmath30 term represents the higher energy stellar photons absorbed by the gas .",
    "given the relatively low local temperatures , i do not consider the energy re - emitted into the higher energy waveband . the radiative flux is treated using the flux - limited diffusion method described in equation ( [ eq : flux ] ) .",
    "equations ( [ eq : thermalenergy2 ] ) and ( [ eq : radenergy ] ) contain three separate opacities : the optical absorption opacity @xmath31 , the infrared planck opacity @xmath32 , and the infrared rosseland opacity @xmath33 that appears through the flux term .    the effect of decoupling the energy equations and including 3 separate opacities can best be understood by considering the radiative behavior of equations ( [ eq : thermalenergy2 ] ) and ( [ eq : radenergy ] ) , _ ie . _ in the absence of dynamics . if we express the ratio of the stellar absorption opacity to the local opacity as ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hubeny et al .

    "the presence of an inversions thus becomes dependent on the radial structure of @xmath39 . in figure ( [ fig : pt_t_rad ] ) i show the solution to equations ( [ eq : thermalenergy2 ] ) and ( [ eq : radenergy ] ) in the absence of dynamics .",
    "as expected , the inversion is high in the atmosphere , where @xmath39 is around or above unity and @xmath40 is small .",
    "figure ( [ fig : pt_t_rad ] ) clearly demonstrates how the thermal and radiative energies become de - coupled , requiring solving the equations separately .",
    "full dynamical simulations are not presented here , but will be in explored in detail in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* dobbs - dixon & lin ( 2008 ) ) .",
    "in this proceeding i have reviewed results from full three - dimensional radiative hydrodynamical simulations of the atmospheres of close - in planets .",
    "simulations for a range of atmospheric opacities and semi - major axis were performed .",
    "the results indicate that both stellar proximity and opacity are both crucial factors in determining the behavior of planetary atmospheres .",
    "increasing planetary opacities yields less efficient advection and colder night - side temperatures .",
    "furthermore , planets situated at 1 and 3 day orbital periods exhibit a fairly stable banded jet structure , with jet width increasing with rotation period . on the other - hand , dynamics of planets with 7 day orbital periods can be much more variable , with wandering jets and the formation of vortices on the night - side .",
    "the decoupling of the thermal and radiative energies , as well as the introduction of multiple opacities relevant for impinging optical stellar photons vrs local re - radiated infrared photons allows us to explore in greater detail temperature structure near the top of the atmosphere .",
    "radiative solutions presented in section ( 4 ) produce temperature inversions similar to those observed and demonstrate the feasibility of simultaneously studying these radiative features and the resulting hydrodynamics .",
    "the existence of an inversion depends critically on the ratio of the optical to infrared opacities and the behavior of this ratio with radius .",
    "given the importance of both optical and infrared opacities it is fruitful to consider how we expect atmospheric properties to vary as we change these two quantities independently .",
    "* fortney et al .",
    "( 2008 ) ) suggested a classification planets based on the presence or absence of tivo in the upper atmosphere .",
    "although the presence of tivo in the upper atmosphere is controversial , it would provide the necessary absorption opacity to cause an inversion .",
    "fortney s classifications of pm and pl classes correspond to those with and without detected inversions . here",
    "extend this classification in terms of the individual absorption ( @xmath27 ) and planck ( @xmath41)opacities explored in this proceeding .",
    "as explained in section ( 3 ) , the night - side temperature is governed by the efficiency of advection , which in turn is determined by the cooling timescale where the incident radiation is deposited .",
    "the cooling timescale is directly related to the local planck opacity @xmath41 ; large @xmath41 will result in a large day - night temperature differential .",
    "such a distinction is observable from current and ongoing phase monitoring programs . on the other hand ,",
    "the absorption opacity for the incident stellar light @xmath27 will play an important role in the presence or absence of a temperature inversion . as described in section ( 4 )",
    "the ratio @xmath42 will determine the temperature structure in the upper atmosphere .",
    "if the radial structure of @xmath43 is such that it peaks in the upper atmosphere there will be an inversion .",
    "in these terms , the presence of tivo ( a pl planet ) would lead to large @xmath27 , but an inversion would occur only if @xmath41 does not also increase . in figure ( [ fig :",
    "diagram ] ) i have unified these two concepts onto a single diagram .",
    "a measurement of both the magnitude of day - night temperature differential and a determination of the presence or absence of an inversion will uniquely tell you both the optical and infrared opacities and place the planet in one of the quadrants .",
    "such a determination will ultimately tell us much about the formation and evolution of these planets ."
