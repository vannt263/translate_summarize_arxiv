    "transport through a chaotic cavity is usually studied through a scattering description . for a chaotic cavity attached to two leads with @xmath1 and @xmath2 channels respectively",
    ", the scattering matrix is an @xmath3 unitary matrix , where @xmath4 .",
    "it can be separated into transmission and reflection subblocks @xmath5 which encode the dynamics of the system and the relation between the incoming and outgoing wavefunctions in the leads .",
    "the unitarity of the scattering matrix @xmath6 leads to the following relations ( among others ) @xmath7 while the transport statistics themselves are related to the terms in involving the scattering matrix ( or its transmitting and reflecting subblocks ) and their transpose conjugate .",
    "for example , the conductance is proportional to the trace @xmath8 $ ] ( landauer - bttiker formula @xcite ) , while other physical properties are expressible through higher moments like @xmath8^n$ ] .",
    "there are two main approaches to studying the transport statistics in clean ballistic systems : a random matrix theory ( rmt ) approach , which argues that @xmath9 can be viewed as a random matrix from a suitable ensemble , and a semiclassical approach that approximates elements of the matrix @xmath9 by sums over open scattering trajectories through the cavity .",
    "it was shown by blmel and smilansky @xcite that the scattering matrix of a chaotic cavity is well modelled by the dyson s circular ensemble of random matrices of suitable symmetry .",
    "thus , transport properties of chaotic cavities are often treated by replacing the scattering matrix with a random one ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the eigenvalues of the transmission matrix @xmath10 then follow a joint probability distribution , which depends on whether the system has time reversal symmetry or not , and from which transport moments and other quantities can be derived .",
    "though the conductance and its variance were known for arbitrary channel number @xcite , other quantities were limited to a diagrammatic expansions in inverse channel number , see @xcite .",
    "however , the rmt treatment has recently experienced a resurgence due to the connection to the selberg integral noticed in @xcite . following the semiclassical result for the shot noise @xcite , the authors of @xcite used recursion relations derived from the selberg integral to calculate the shot noise and then later all the various moments up to fourth order for arbitrary channel number @xcite .    since",
    "then a range of transport quantities have been treated , for example the moments of the transmission eigenvalues for chaotic systems without time reversal symmetry ( the unitary random matrix ensemble ) @xcite and those with time reversal symmetry ( the orthogonal random matrix ensemble ) @xcite . for the unitary ensemble ,",
    "the moments of the conductance itself were also obtained in @xcite and , using a different approach , in @xcite which was later extended to the moments of the shot noise @xcite .",
    "building again on the selberg integral approach , the moments of the conductance and shot noise have been derived for both symmetry classes @xcite .",
    "interestingly these results , though all exact for arbitrary channel number , are given by different combinatorial sums , and the question of how they are related to each other is still open in many cases .",
    "on the other hand , the semiclassical approach makes use of the following approximation for the scattering matrix elements @xcite @xmath11 which involves the open trajectories @xmath12 which start in channel @xmath13 and end in channel @xmath14 , with their action @xmath15 and stability amplitude @xmath16 .",
    "the prefactor also involves @xmath17 which is the average dwell time , or time the trajectory spends inside the cavity . for transport moments we consider quantities of the type @xmath18^{n } \\right\\rangle \\sim \\left\\langle \\frac{1}{{(n\\td)}^{n } }   \\prod_{j=1}^{n } \\sum_{{i_j , o_j } }     \\sum_{\\substack{\\gamma_j(i_j\\to o_j ) \\cr         \\gamma'_j ( i_{j+1}\\to o_{j } ) } } a_{\\gamma_j}a_{\\gamma'_j}^ { * }    \\rme^{\\frac{\\rmi}{\\hbar}(s_{\\gamma_j}-s_{\\gamma'_j } ) } \\right\\rangle,\\ ] ] where the trace means we identify @xmath19 and where @xmath20 is either the transmitting or the reflecting subblock of the scattering matrix . the averaging is performed over a window of energies @xmath21 .",
    "the choice of the subblock @xmath20 affects the sums over the possible incoming and outgoing channels , but not the trajectory structure which involves @xmath22 classical trajectories connecting channels . of these , @xmath0 trajectories @xmath23",
    ", @xmath24 , contribute with positive action while @xmath0 trajectories @xmath25 contribute with negative action . in the semiclassical limit of @xmath26",
    "we require that these sums cancel on the scale of @xmath27 so that the corresponding trajectories can contribute consistently when we apply the averaging in .",
    "( a ) the semiclassical trajectories for the second moment travel around a closed cycle . by collapsing the trajectories onto each other as in ( b ) we can create a small action difference and a trajectory quadruplet with a single encounter that contributes to the shot noise at leading order in inverse channel number .",
    "( c ) for the conductance , a trajectory pair with a similar encounter provides the first subleading order correction for systems with time reversal symmetry . ]    the main idea of the semiclassical treatment is that , in order to achieve a small action difference , the trajectories @xmath28 , must follow the path of trajectories @xmath29 most of the time , deviating only in small regions called _",
    "encounters_. this is best illustrated with an example . in ( a ) the schematic depiction of the trajectories",
    "is shown for the case @xmath30 .",
    "we have 2 trajectories @xmath12 depicted by solid lines , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , and 2 trajectories @xmath33 depicted by dashed lines , @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "( b ) shows one possible configuration for achieving a small action difference : trajectory @xmath36 departs from the incoming channel @xmath37 following the path of trajectory @xmath38 .",
    "then , when the trajectories @xmath39 and @xmath38 come close to each other in phase space ( thus the term ` encounter ' ) , trajectory @xmath36 switches from following @xmath38 to following @xmath39 , before arriving at its destination channel @xmath40 .",
    "the trajectory @xmath41 does the opposite .",
    "the picture in ( b ) is referred to as a ` diagram ' ; it describes the topological configuration of the trajectories in question , while leaving out metric details .",
    "the task of semiclassical evaluation can therefore be divided into two parts : evaluation of the contribution of a given diagram by integrating over all possible trajectories of given structure and enumeration of all possible diagrams .    historically , the semiclassical treatment started with the mean conductance @xmath42\\right\\rangle$ ] , involving a single trajectory and its partner .",
    "the leading order contribution comes from trajectory pairs that are identical  the so - called diagonal approximation which was evaluated in @xcite .",
    "the first non - diagonal pair was treated in @xcite and involved a single encounter where one trajectory had a self - crossing while the partner avoided crossing as in ( c ) .",
    "such a pair can only exist when the system has time reversal symmetry and its contribution was shown to be one order higher in inverse channel number , @xmath43 , than the diagonal terms .",
    "the expansion to all orders in inverse channel number was then performed in @xcite for systems with and without time reversal symmetry by considering arbitrarily many encounters each involving arbitrarily many trajectory stretches .",
    "importantly , the work on the conductance @xcite showed that the semiclassical contribution of a diagram can be decomposed into a product over the constituent parts of the diagram , greatly simplifying the resulting sums .",
    "in fact for the second moment , the shot noise , all such diagrams were generated in @xcite and with them the full expansion in inverse channel number .",
    "this , along with the conductance variance and other transport correlation functions , as well as the semiclassical background was covered in detail in @xcite .",
    "however , the method for diagram enumeration considered in @xcite becomes unwieldy for higher moments , which encode finer transport statistics . to the leading order in @xmath43 ,",
    "the higher moments were derived in @xcite .",
    "the semiclassical approach requires a large number of channels in each lead , @xmath44 , but to unambiguously separate the orders in inverse channel number one may additionally assume that both @xmath1 and @xmath2 are of the same order as @xmath45 .",
    "for example , the result of @xcite was in terms of the variable @xmath46 which should then be constant and introduce no further channel number scaling .",
    "we therefore make the same assumption in this article when describing the different orders in @xmath43 , though of course a different scaling , say keeping @xmath1 fixed so that @xmath47 , may simply lead to a mixing of the different ` orders ' without changing the individual results .",
    "the diagrams contributing at the leading order to the @xmath0-th moment were shown in @xcite to be trees .",
    "the tree expansions turned out to be very well suited to analysis of other interesting physical quantities , such as the statistics of the wigner delay times @xcite , which are a measure of the time spent in the scattering region , and the density of states in andreev billiards @xcite .",
    "if we imagine replacing the scattering leads by a superconductor we have a closed system called an andreev billiard .",
    "each time an electron inside the system hits the superconductor it is reflected as a hole retracing its path until it hits the superconductor and is retroreflected as an electron again .",
    "wave interference between these paths leads to significant effects , most notably a complete suppression of the density of states for a range of energies around the fermi energy .",
    "similarly , strong effects on the conductance ( of the order of the mean conductance ) can also be seen if we attach additional superconducting leads to our original chaotic cavity ( making a so - called andreev dot ) @xcite .",
    "the size of these effects make such systems especially interesting for a semiclassical treatment . but",
    "treating these effects effectively requires knowledge of _ all _ the higher moments , and gives us strong reason to go beyond low @xmath0 .",
    "one particular nicety of the semiclassical approach is that it can incorporate , in a natural way , the effect of the ehrenfest time .",
    "this is the time scale that governs the transition from classical dynamics to wave interference , which dominates when the ehrenfest time is small ( on the scale of the typical dwell time ) . for larger ehrenfest times",
    ", the competition between the different types of behaviour leads to quite striking features , like an additional gap both in the density of states of andreev billiards and in the probability distribution of the wigner delay times @xcite .",
    "semiclassically we can explicitly track the effect of the ehrenfest time all the way to the ` classical ' limit , which can only be achieved using rmt by postulating the ehrenfest time dependence of the scattering matrix .    alongside the case of ballistic systems , the typical chaotic behaviour and transport statistics can also be induced by introducing disorder in the system .",
    "for weak disorder the transport properties coincide with those obtained from rmt , and one can also obtain the full counting statistics at leading order , as well as weak localisation corrections and universal conductance fluctuations , using circuit theory @xcite . if the disorder averaging is treated using diagrammatic perturbation theory ( see , for example , @xcite ) multiple scattering events can be summed , in the limit of weak disorder , as a ladder diagram known as a diffuson .",
    "this corresponds to the parts of semiclassical diagrams where the trajectories are nearly identical , as on the left of the encounter in ( c ) .",
    "the disordered systems counterpart of the loop on the right of the encounter in ( c ) , traversed by trajectories in opposite directions , is called a cooperon , while the encounter itself corresponds to a hikami box @xcite .",
    "although transport properties like the weak localisation diagram related to ( c ) and conductance and energy level fluctuations @xcite can be treated diagrammatically , usually powerful field - theoretic methods involving the nonlinear @xmath48 model are used ( see @xcite for an introduction ) .",
    "these methods can treat both weak and stronger disorder non - perturbatively , and by using supersymmetry @xcite a large range of transport and spectral properties can be obtained , for open and closed systems correspondingly .",
    "more importantly , the applicability of rmt for weakly disordered systems can be justified and rmt shown to be the zero - dimensional variant of the @xmath48 model @xcite . alongside the supersymmetric @xmath48 model",
    ", there is also the replica @xmath48 model which is particularly useful for perturbative expansions .",
    "this leads to a diagrammatic expansion , with diagrams that can be reinterpreted as correlated semiclassical trajectories @xcite .",
    "in fact this connection between semiclassical diagrams and disorder diagrams from the replica @xmath48 model lay behind the semiclassical treatment of energy level correlations in closed systems @xcite which in turn led to the semiclassical treatment of transport @xcite discussed above .    to summarize , there are established semiclassical tools for the analysis of for small @xmath0 to all orders of @xmath43 and for all @xmath0 but only to the leading order of @xmath43 .",
    "it is the purpose of this article to start closing this gap .",
    "for all @xmath0 we derive the next two corrections for and related quantities .",
    "we show that the contributing diagrams can be generated by grafting trees onto the ` base diagrams ' , which can be obtained by ` cleaning ' the diagrams used in @xcite .",
    "we therefore first review the leading order tree recursions in before treating transport moments beyond the leading order in .",
    "we start by cleaning the diagram of ( c ) which gives the first subleading order orthogonal correction .",
    "grafting trees onto the base diagram leads to a generating function , which we apply to calculate the moments of the transmission and reflection eigenvalues .",
    "proceeding to the next order in @xmath43 we then treat the second subleading order diagrams for the unitary and the orthogonal case .",
    "for the moments of the reflection and transmission eigenvalues we find that our generating functions simplify and become rather straightforward .",
    "the graphical recursions we use provide a new insight into the leading order terms which is particularly useful for energy dependent correlation functions .",
    "such correlation functions are needed for a treatment of the density of states of andreev billiards , which we consider in where we find that the hard gap , previously found at leading order in @xmath43 , persists at least for the next two orders . also derivable from energy",
    "dependent correlation functions are the moments of the wigner delay times , treated in , and we find that the corrections at each order in @xmath43 are also generated by relatively simple functions .",
    "of course , the transport moments in are only one type of transport quantity , and we finally look at non - linear statistics in and see how their treatment follows naturally from the previous semiclassical considerations .",
    "we shall be comparing our semiclassical results with the prediction of rmt , where those predictions are available : previously ( of the quantities treated here ) only the moments of the transmission amplitudes for systems without time reversal symmetry have been given for an arbitrary number of channels @xcite .",
    "explicit results for systems with time reversal symmetry have just been derived @xcite and we were pleased that @xcite shared those results with us beforehand .",
    "the moments of the wigner delay times for both symmetry classes have also been obtained @xcite .",
    "of the recent rmt results , it is those concerned with the asymptotic expansion as the number of channels increases , currently to leading order @xcite , that particularly connect with the work here",
    ". semiclassically , without the equivalent of the selberg integral , we are still restricted to an expansion in inverse powers of the channel number , but as we shall see the semiclassical treatment leads to explicit and surprisingly simple generating functions at each order in inverse channel number .",
    "this simplicity until now remained hidden in the combinatorial sums of the rmt results and may suggest ways of simplifying those results and of highlighting the underlying combinatorial structure .",
    "the semiclassical treatment of the conductance beyond the diagonal contribution , starting @xcite with the trajectory pair depicted in ( c ) , required two main ingredients .",
    "the first was to estimate how often a trajectory would come close to itself and have a self - encounter . this",
    "is performed using the global ergodicity of the chaotic dynamics .",
    "the second was that , given such an encounter , we can use the local hyperbolicity of the motion to find the partner trajectory which reconnects the stretches of the original trajectory in a different way",
    ". then one can determine the action difference between the two trajectories and hence their contribution in the semiclassical limit .",
    "when treating diagrams with more numerous and more complicated encounters , the authors of @xcite showed that these two ingredients allowed them to express the total contribution as a product of integrals over the encounters and over the ` links ' , the trajectory stretches which connect the encounters together . performing these integrals then led to simple rules for the contributions of the constituent parts of any diagram , and essentially reduced the problem down to the combinatorial one of finding all the possible diagrams .",
    "for the first two transport moments , this was done @xcite by cutting open the periodic orbit pairs that contribute to spectral statistics @xcite .    for the higher moments ,",
    "as shown in @xcite , the diagrams that contribute at leading order in inverse channel number are rooted plane trees .",
    "the reason is simple : according to the semiclassical evaluation rules of @xcite , every encounter contributes a factor of @xmath49 while every link contributes a factor of @xmath43 .",
    "the leading order is thus achieved by a diagram with the minimal possible difference between the number of links ( edges ) and encounters ( internal vertices ) .",
    "it is a basic fact of graph theory that this difference is minimized by trees ; each independent cycle in a graph adds one to this difference .",
    "thus to go beyond the leading order one needs to consider diagrams with an increasing number of cycles .",
    "we will approach this task by describing the topology of the cycles using ` base diagrams '  graphs with no vertices of degree 1 or 2  and then grafting subtrees onto the base diagrams .    adding a subtree does not change the order of the contribution in inverse channel number @xmath43 but adds more incoming and outgoing channels thus changing the order of the moment @xmath0 . because we will be joining the trees to existing structures , unlike the treatment in @xcite , here we do not root our trees in an incoming channel , but at an arbitrary point .",
    "these trees then correspond to the restricted trees in @xcite and will be referred to as ` subtrees ' .",
    "we also note that the generating function variables we use here have slightly different definitions than in @xcite .",
    "our present choice is more appropriate for the subleading orders and the different transport quantities considered .",
    "we now summarize the derivation of the subtree generating functions which were introduced in @xcite and further developed in @xcite .",
    "a subtree consists of a root , several vertices of even degree ( called ` nodes ' , they correspond to encounters between various trajectories ) and @xmath50 vertices of degree one ( called ` leaves ' , they correspond to incoming or outgoing channels ) .",
    "the leaves are labelled @xmath13 or @xmath14 alternatingly as we go around the tree anti - clockwise .",
    "there are two types of subtrees : the @xmath51-subtrees have leaves labelled @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 etc .",
    "the label @xmath56 would correspond to the root if we were to label it too .",
    "the @xmath57-subtrees have leaf labels @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath58 etc .",
    "the reference index @xmath59 depends on the location of the subtree on the diagram .",
    "it is possible that an encounter happens immediately as several trajectories enter the cavity from the lead or exit the cavity into the lead . to keep account of these situations",
    ", we say that an @xmath60-encounter ( node of degree @xmath61 ) may ` @xmath13-touch ' the lead if it is connected directly to @xmath60 incoming channels ( leaves with label @xmath13 ) and ` @xmath14-touch ' if connected to @xmath60 outgoing channels .",
    "when an encounter touches the lead , the edges connecting it to the lead get cut off and all the channels must coincide , although in the diagrams we keep short ` stubs ' to avoid changing the degree of the encounter vertex .    we define the generating functions @xmath62 and @xmath63 which are counting @xmath51- and @xmath57-trees correspondingly .",
    "the meaning of the variables @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 is as follows :    * @xmath67 enumerate the @xmath60-encounters that do not touch the lead , * @xmath68 enumerate the @xmath60-encounters that @xmath13-touch the lead , * @xmath69 enumerate the @xmath60-encounters that @xmath14-touch the lead .    for example , the coefficient of @xmath70 gives the number of trees with one 3-encounter ( a vertex of degree 6 ) and three 2-encounters ( vertices of degree @xmath71 ) , one of which @xmath13-touches the lead .",
    "an example of such a tree is given in ( a ) .",
    "we note that if an encounter may touch the lead , the generating function includes ( and sums ) both possibilities : touching and non - touching .",
    "for example , the left - most vertex of the tree in ( a ) may @xmath14-touch the lead , but this possibility is counted separately .",
    "in addition we will use several secondary parameters that will allow us to adapt the subtree generating functions to each of the four quantities considered in the paper .",
    "these parameters are :    * @xmath72 is the semiclassical contribution of an edge ( link ) * @xmath73 and @xmath74 are the contributions of an incoming and an outgoing channel * @xmath48 is a special correction parameter for the situation when an @xmath14-touching node is directly connected to an @xmath13-channel ( @xmath75 everywhere apart from ) .    the subtree shown in ( a ) is cut at its top node ( of degree 4 ) creating subtrees ( b)-(d ) .",
    "subtree ( c ) has the incoming and outgoing directions reversed .",
    "the lower vertex in ( a ) , and hence ( c ) , is @xmath13-touching the lead so that the channels @xmath76 and @xmath77 ( not shown ) coincide ( @xmath78 ) .",
    "this is represented by the short stubs , and the encounter now starts in the incoming lead.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    we obtain a recursion for the functions @xmath51 and @xmath57 by cutting the subtree at the top encounter node .",
    "if this node is of degree @xmath61 , this leads to @xmath79 further subtrees as illustrated in .",
    "assuming we started with an @xmath51-subtree , @xmath60 of the new subtrees also have type @xmath51 , while the remaining @xmath80 are @xmath57-subtrees .",
    "thus an @xmath51-subtree with an @xmath60-encounter at the top contributes @xmath81 to the generating function @xmath51 .",
    "additionally , we consider the possibility for the top node of an @xmath51-subtree to @xmath14-touch . in this case",
    "its odd - numbered further subtrees are empty stubs and the even - numbered subtrees are still arbitrary , leading to the contribution @xmath82 . here we have included a correction term @xmath48 which is used in to control the contribution of any @xmath57-subtree that consists of one edge and directly connects an incoming and outgoing channel and is set to 0 in the rest of the paper .",
    "we start our recursion relation at the value for an empty tree , which consists of a link ( with the factor @xmath72 ) and an outgoing channel ( providing a factor @xmath83 ) , @xmath84.\\ ] ] the recursion is similar for @xmath57 , with the roles of @xmath13- and @xmath14-variables switched , @xmath85 .\\ ] ]      for the reflection into lead 1 we will consider the generating function @xmath86^n\\right\\rangle , \\ ] ] where the power of @xmath87 counts the order of the moments . for the individual semiclassical diagrams we make use of the diagrammatic rules of @xcite , where each link contributes a factor of @xmath43 while each encounter provides the factor @xmath49 .",
    "each channel is in lead 1 , so can be chosen from the @xmath1 available and provides this factor .",
    "when an encounter starts ( or ends ) in the lead , all the incoming ( or outgoing ) channels must then coincide in the same channel , leading again to the factor @xmath1 . bearing in mind the meaning of the variables introduced above , we therefore have to make the following semiclassical substitutions : @xmath88 where we have introduced @xmath89 whose power counts the total number of channels and which allows us to keep track of the total contributions to different moments .",
    "the @xmath0-th moment involves @xmath22 channels so we have the relation @xmath90 .",
    "each channel factor @xmath91 then includes the factor @xmath89 , while the formula for @xmath92 in accounts for the fact that when an @xmath60-encounter enters the incoming channels we have @xmath60 channels coinciding but only a single channel factor .",
    "if we define @xmath93 , the subtree recursions and both become @xmath94 performing the sums ( where the terms @xmath51 and @xmath95 correspond to @xmath96 of the sums ) this is @xmath97 which can be written as the quadratic @xmath98 where @xmath99 and where we take the solution whose expansion agrees with the contributions of the semiclassical diagrams .      for the transmission we treat the function @xmath100^n\\right\\rangle,\\ ] ] and to distinguish it more clearly from the reflection we will call the corresponding subtree generating function @xmath101 here . for the transmission ,",
    "the equations are a bit more complicated than for the reflection because @xmath102 in general . for the substitution",
    "we need @xmath103 where the only difference from is that the outgoing channels are now in lead 2 and can be chosen from the @xmath2 available .",
    "the contribution of the subtrees once summed becomes @xmath104 with @xmath105 and using that @xmath106 .",
    "likewise becomes @xmath107 where , as before @xmath108 .",
    "with @xmath109 we have @xmath110h + r^2\\xi=0 , \\ ] ] from which we can find the equations @xmath111",
    "by a simple counting argument , the order of a diagram in terms of inverse channel number is the number of edges minus the number of vertices ( both leaves and nodes ) .",
    "thus a diagram contributes at the order @xmath112 , where @xmath113 is the number of the independent cycles in the diagram ( also known as the cyclomatic number or the first betti number , hence the notation ) .",
    "the leading contribution thus comes from tree diagrams which have @xmath114 and the next contribution comes from diagrams with one cycle .",
    "the correlated trajectory quadruplet in ( a ) which contributes to the second moment at leading order in inverse channel number can be redrawn as the ribbon tree in ( b ) by ` untwisting ' the encounter .",
    "the four trajectories themselves can be read off from the boundary walk shown . at subleading order in inverse channel number , we start with the correlated periodic orbit pair in ( c ) which can be represented as the graph in ( d ) with corresponding boundary walks . cutting the periodic orbit along the left link ( which is traversed in the same direction by the orbit and its partner )",
    "creates the correlated trajectory pair in ( e ) which contributes to the first moment . changing this diagram into a graph we arrive at the structure in ( f ) which is a mbius strip with an empty subtree inside and outside the loop .",
    "the intertwined s s in diagrams ( d ) and ( f ) represent twists in the corresponding ribbon links . ]    a diagram with one cycle can be thought of as a loop with trees grafted on it .",
    "but there is a twist .",
    "the reconstruction of the trajectories structure from a tree , see @xcite , was done by means of the boundary walk .",
    "it helps to visualise the edges of the tree as strips , a model that is called a _ fat _ or _ ribbon _",
    "graph in combinatorics .",
    "this fixes the circular order of edges around each vertex and , going along the boundary , prescribes a unique way to continue the walk around a vertex ( see @xcite for an accessible introduction ) .",
    "the trajectories @xmath23 of equation   are then read as the portions of the walk going from @xmath115 to @xmath116 .",
    "the trajectories @xmath117 , on the other hand , appear in reverse as portions of the walk going from @xmath116 to @xmath118 .",
    "for example , the diagram in ( a ) which contributes at leading order in @xmath43 can be redrawn as the tree in ( b ) with the corresponding boundary walk shown .",
    "the trace in means that the boundary walk is closed and the equality of total actions implies that each edge of the diagram is traversed twice ( once by @xmath12 and once by @xmath33 ) .",
    "this means that a valid diagram must have",
    "_ one face_. in particular , there must be a way for the walk to cross from inside to outside of the cycle of the first correction diagram .",
    "the diagram thus has the topology of a mbius strip with ( ribbon ) trees grafted on the edges .",
    "we will refer to the diagram without any trees ( mbius strip in this case ) as the _ base diagram _ or _",
    "structure_.    it is also beneficial to consult the full expansion in powers of the inverse channel number of the first two moments of the transmission eigenvalues @xcite and to draw the corresponding diagrams as ribbon graphs .",
    "the procedure of going from the closed periodic orbits to scattering trajectories and then to a graph is illustrated in for the first subleading order correction .",
    "removing the remaining subtrees from ( f ) leads to the base structure in ( a ) to which we can append subtrees to create valid diagrams like ( b ) whose boundary walk is depicted in ( c ) .",
    "as the base structure involves a loop which is traversed in opposite directions by the trajectory and its partner , all the diagrams created in this way can only exist in systems with time reversal symmetry ( corresponding to the orthogonal rmt ensemble ) .    to obtain the base structure in ( a )",
    "we can simply remove the empty subtrees of ( f ) . appending subtrees to ( a ) we",
    "can then create all the possible graphs , but for the graph to remain a mbius strip we need an odd number of odd nodes , as for example in the graph in ( b ) .",
    "we draw the boundary walk in ( c ) where we truncated the subtrees at their first node as they always have an odd number of leaves thereafter .",
    "the top left and bottom right nodes along the mbius strip in ( b ) or ( c ) may also enter the lead for reflection quantities . ]    along the loop we can add subtrees at any point and to make a valid @xmath60-encounter we must add @xmath119 subtrees ( the remaining two stretches in the encounter belong to the loop itself ) .",
    "if the node has an odd number of trees both inside and outside the loop , we refer to it as an _",

    "the calculation is performed by grafting trees onto the base structures with a low number of cycles , and relies on the fact that attaching trees does not change the order in inverse channel number . instead , the trees add more incoming and outgoing channels and so increase the order of the moment . with graphical recursions , this allows us to generate all the moments at a given order in inverse channel number , which we performed up to the third order .",
    "the terms we considered suggest the following observations about the ribbon graphs that arise as the contributing diagrams    * absence of time reversal symmetry results in graphs being orientable ; both orientable and non - orientable graphs contribute to the calculation with time reversal symmetry , * the order ( in @xmath43 ) of a contribution is reflected in the genus of the corresponding graph , * linear moments ( with one trace ) result in graphs with one face , while non - linear moments with @xmath365 traces will require considering graphs with @xmath365 faces .",
    "the above general observations suggest that a complete expansion in @xmath43 should be both feasible and interesting to specialists working in algebra and combinatorics .",
    "we find that the semiclassical contribution of individual base diagrams depends significantly on the global structure of the diagram .",
    "this is in contrast to the expansions of the first two moments performed in @xcite , where the contribution factorized into a product over the vertices of the diagram and the problem was thus reduced to a combinatorial enumeration .",
    "the latter was achieved through finding recursion relations which connect different diagrams , and similar ideas could well be useful for the base structures we need for all moments . to illustrate the scale of the problem of going to higher order in @xmath43 , for the unitary case",
    "there are 1848 base diagrams at the next contributing order .",
    "as they can involve more than two nodes , they can no longer be derived by cleaning the corresponding semiclassical conductance diagrams as was the case for the orders treated in this article . however , in the end all these diagrams would probably lead to the generating functions and , highlighting the scale of the simplifications that take place .",
    "our results fully agree with the predictions of rmt theory ( as far as those are available @xcite ) , and importantly are given in terms of very simple generating functions .",
    "this would suggest that extending the types of asymptotic analyses of @xcite beyond the leading order , ( as is currently being performed @xcite ) , one could also expect to see simplifications of the rmt results . for the unitary case , where several different formulae are known for the moments of the transmission eigenvalues @xcite , this analysis and the semiclassical endpoints could shed light on the combinatorial relationships between the different approaches .",
    "because of the connection between rmt and weakly disordered systems , we can expect that our results also apply to such systems .",
    "likewise , with the close correspondence between semiclassical and disorder diagrams @xcite , one might hope to find similar graphical recursions in a perturbative expansion of the appropriate nonlinear @xmath48 model .    if we were to consider non - linear statistics involving three traces ( with their mean parts removed ) , the leading contribution would come from the diagrams like in figures  [ ortho2trees ] and [ ortho2corr ] which split into three cycles , _",
    "i.e. _  diagrams ( a)(c ) without any twists . considering quantities with",
    "@xmath365 traces we would then need to treat base diagrams related to those which contribute to order @xmath366 ( and higher ) for the linear statistics , and so we immediately run into the considerations and difficulties described above . curiously though the moments of the conductance and the shot noise themselves can be efficiently treated using rmt @xcite .",
    "semiclassically , the @xmath365-th moment of these quantities corresponds to having exactly 2 or 4 channels along each of the @xmath365 cycles , and the rmt results might then provide a pathway for generating such semiclassical diagrams .",
    "this could in turn be useful for generating and treating the corresponding base diagrams for the linear statistics .",
    "the methods described in this article were also used to treat the density of states of andreev billiards . replacing the normal conducting leads of the chaotic cavity by a superconductor",
    "produces strong effects like the complete suppression of the density of states around the fermi energy @xcite .",
    "being interested in the density of states one must evaluate moments of all orders , something that our methods are particularly geared towards .",
    "going beyond leading order in inverse channel number we could show that this gap persists for the next two orders , and that the behaviour of the density of states slightly above the gap is not determined by just these terms in the expansion .",
    "because of the superconductor , one not only needs to know all the moments but also all the higher orders in inverse channel number . a result for arbitrary channel number would therefore be particularly welcome for such systems , which leads to the question of how to adapt the recent rmt advances to tackle this problem .",
    "similarly , chaotic cavities with additional superconductors attached ( andreev dots ) also exhibit significant effects due to the presence of the superconductors and also require one to be able to treat what would correspond to all the moments of usual transport quantities .",
    "for example , at leading order in inverse channel number , the conductance through a normal chaotic cavity requires just the diagonal pair of trajectories , while for the conductance through an andreev dot one needs full tree recursions @xcite .",
    "the treatment is actually similar to the edges in the base diagrams here , but with the added ingredient of having two ( or more ) different species of subtree .",
    "one can then see that treating the transport moments of andreev dots requires an extra layer of complexity compared to normal chaotic cavities .",
    "the results in this article are all for the case in which the leads are perfectly coupled to the chaotic cavity , rather than for the more general and experimentally relevant case of non - ideal coupling .",
    "this is typically modelled by introducing tunnel barriers into the leads with some probability to backscatter when entering ( or leaving ) the cavity .",
    "semiclassically , along with affecting the contributions of the channels and modifying the survival probability and hence contributions of the links and the correlated trajectory stretches inside the encounters , the main change is that a wealth of new diagrams become possible @xcite .",
    "specifically , encounters may now partially touch the leads and have some of their links backreflected at the tunnel barrier while the rest tunnel through to enter or exit the system . in principle , these possibilities would become extra terms in the tree and graphical recursions in this article , but so far these types of diagrams have only been treated semiclassically for the lowest moments @xcite .",
    "however , from a rmt viewpoint at leading order in inverse channel number and with the same tunnelling probability for each channel , the non - ideal contacts just increase the order of the generating functions by one , for example for both the density of states of andreev billiards @xcite and the moments of the wigner delay times @xcite .",
    "finally one can wonder whether the effect of the ehrenfest time can be incorporated into the graphical recursions developed here .",
    "for the leading order in inverse channel number , the effect could be included @xcite in the tree recursions .",
    "first , the trees are related to each other through a continuous deformation , for example by giving the nodes a certain size ( actually , the ehrenfest time itself ) and allowing them to slide into each other .",
    "second , this is then partitioned in a particular way so that one can extract the ehrenfest time dependence efficiently . each partition and hence the sum of all diagrams leads to the same simple ehrenfest time dependence at leading order in inverse channel number @xcite and this pattern and treatment seems to also hold at the first subleading order @xcite .",
    "whether this continues to higher order and nonlinear statistics , which start to include the complications of periodic orbit encounters , is an intriguing question .",
    "using the rmt result from @xcite we can compute the moments up to finite order and expand them in powers of the inverse channel number . looking at the patterns for the reflection in , and , we can expect that each order in the inverse channel number just increases the powers in the denominators ( the square root comes simply from the subtrees ) .",
    "in fact we find that the first several subleading orders can be written as @xmath367 where @xmath368 is the vector @xmath369 , @xmath370 is an @xmath371 matrix and @xmath372 is the row vector @xmath373 .",
    "the first few values of @xmath374 are @xmath375 @xmath376 @xmath377 @xmath378 similarly we can write the transmission as @xmath379 where @xmath380 is the vector @xmath381 and @xmath372 is the row vector @xmath373",

    "<S> namely , we find the moments of the transmission and reflection eigenvalues for systems with and without time reversal symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> we also derive related quantities involving an energy dependence : the moments of the wigner delay times and the density of states of chaotic andreev billiards , where we find that the gap in the density persists when subleading corrections are included . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we show how to adapt our techniques to non - linear statistics by calculating the correlation between transport moments .    in each setting , the answer for the @xmath0-th moment is obtained for arbitrary @xmath0 ( in the form of a moment generating function ) and for up to the three leading orders in terms of the inverse channel number . </S>",
    "<S> our results suggest patterns which should hold for further corrections and by matching with the low order moments available from random matrix theory we derive likely higher order generating functions . </S>"
