    "the nuclear matrix element ( nme ) of neutrinoless double - beta ( @xmath0 ) decay has been studied intensively by many theoretical research groups , who have been inspired by the attempts initiated by several experimental groups to observe @xmath0 decay @xcite ( experiments already started ) .",
    "exploitation of the @xmath0 decay is one of the few available methods for determining the neutrino mass scale . in this approach , it is necessary to obtain reliable values for the nme and phase - space factor in order to determine the effective neutrino mass accurately , together with the experimental decay probability .",
    "however , it is difficult to establish the nme reliably , because the predicted @xmath0 nmes can not be confirmed by any other methods .",
    "this difficulty arises because the transition operator is a neutrino - exchange interaction in medium , which has never been used for the investigation of other nuclear physics problems .",
    "in addition , an uncertainty is introduced through approximation of the nuclear wave function , as the lightest candidate parent nucleus used in experiment is @xmath1ca @xcite .",
    "a well - known problem exists in that the values of the @xmath0 nme are distributed within a factor range of 23 depending on the method ( see , e.g. , @xcite )",
    ". this uncertainty may affect the design of next - generation detectors significantly , as can be conjectured from discussions on experimental sensitivity ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , improvement of the nme calculation is an urgent challenge for theoretical nuclear physics .",
    "the author emphasizes that study of the many - body problem is essential in order to solve the problem of discrepancy between methods .",
    "the approach to the nme calculation that utilizes the quasiparticle random - phase approximation ( qrpa ) , which is employed in this paper , has been improved over a number of decades , in terms of deformation of the nuclear density @xcite , evaluation of the finite nucleon - size effect ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , the tensor term in the transition operator ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the renormalized qrpa ( @xcite and references therein ) , several effective - operator methods ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and other factors .",
    "remarkable progress has been made recently , in that a few groups have independently performed qrpa calculations ( @xcite and references therein ) , with the converged results with respect to the dimension of the wave - function space , and relatively similar @xmath0 nmes were obtained within a range significantly smaller than the abovementioned factor of 23 .",
    "recently , the author has made additional progress by modifying the qrpa approach for calculation of the nme of @xmath0 decay in terms of the overlap calculation of the intermediate states of the decay @xcite . in the qrpa approach ,",
    "the intermediate states obtained on the basis of the initial and final states are not identical ; therefore , this overlap calculation is not trivial .",
    "a major modification involves the explicit use of the qrpa ground - state wave function , which is defined as vacuum for qrpa bosons .",
    "hence , it has been found that the product of the normalization factors of the qrpa ground states is almost 2 for the @xmath2nd@xmath3sm decay , which has a significant effect in terms of nme reduction @xcite .",
    "the author s nme is close to that of the conventional qrpa approach @xcite ; however , the modified method has an important physical implication . in the conventional approach ,",
    "the proton - neutron ( pn ) pairing interaction is introduced so as to reproduce the experimental nme or decay probability of the two - neutrino double - beta ( @xmath4 ) decay , and the pnqrpa solutions are close to the breaking point of the pnqrpa as a result of the strong pn pairing interaction .",
    "the advantage of the modified qrpa approach is that such a strong pn pairing interaction is unnecessary ; therefore , the qrpa approach is , in fact , a better approximation than has previously been recognized .",
    "another new aspect of the modified qrpa approach is the use of a virtual decay path , e.g. ,  a two - neutron removal followed by a two - proton addition , in order to calculate the nme of @xmath0 decay under the closure approximation @xcite . the like - particle ( lp)qrpa is the main method for obtaining intermediate states on this virtual path . on the other hand , the pnqrpa is the primary method for obtaining those on the conventional double - beta path .",
    "it is , however , necessary to extend the qrpa ground states to product wave functions of the lp and pn qrpa ground states in order to unify the ground - state wave functions used in the two methods .",
    "this extension implies that the product of the normalization factors of the lpqrpa ground states is also included in the overlap of the pnqrpa states .",
    "therefore , the nme obtained via the double - beta - path calculation is also reduced , and the strong pn pairing interaction can be avoided .",
    "this paper is the third major step in the author s examination and improvement of the manner in which the qrpa is applied to the calculation of the @xmath5 nme .",
    "the problem investigated in this paper is whether or not the previously reported modified qrpa approach @xcite yields equivalent results for the two decay paths , namely , the double - beta and two - particle - transfer paths .",
    "note that the author previously reported the result of a small - space calculation indicating that these two paths yield close nmes @xcite .",
    "however , this equivalence is a property of exact nuclear wave functions , and it is not trivial for approximate wave functions . in this paper , we investigate whether this equivalence is obtained exactly in the qrpa .",
    "the fundamental purpose of the study of this problem is deepening our understanding of the qrpa approach , and such research is necessary because the uncertainties of the methods must be removed individually in order to solve the method - based nme discrepancy problem .",
    "section [ sec : preparation ] presents basic equations for calculating the nme . in sec .",
    "[ sec : cross_term ] , the problem of qrpa equivalence between the two decay paths is investigated both analytically and numerically .",

    "the fundamental reason for the discrepancy is that the lpqrpa has a greater amount of many - body correlations than the pnqrpa , and the product qrpa ground state does not remove the influence of this difference because of the nature of the included transition matrix elements .",

    "the next task appears to be calculation of the nmes of other decay instances so as to clarify the nucleus - dependent features .",

    "another important step is dynamical extension of the ( renormalized ) qrpa , as mentioned before .",
