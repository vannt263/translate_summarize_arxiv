    "taylor - couette flows of electrically conducting fluid between rotating concentric cylinders are a classical problem of hydrodynamic and hydromagnetic stability theory .",
    "it is becoming increasingly clear that the stability of differential rotation combined with magnetic fields is also one of the key problems in mhd astrophysics .",
    "for uniform axial magnetic fields this phenomenon is called the magnetorotational instability ( mri ) .",
    "the keplerian rotation of accretion disks with weak vertical magnetic fields becomes unstable , so that angular momentum is transported outward ( star formation ) and gravitational energy is efficiently transformed into heat and radiation ( quasars ) .",
    "galactic rotation profiles ( approximately @xmath5 ) may also be mri - unstable , resulting in interstellar mhd turbulence @xcite .    due to the small size of laboratory experiments , and the extremely small magnetic prandtl numbers of liquid metals ,",
    "it is very difficult to achieve the mri in the lab with a purely axial magnetic field .",
    "however , by adding a toroidal field @xmath6 ( which is current - free within the fluid ) , it was possible to obtain the mri experimentally @xcite , with the most unstable mode being axisymmetric and oscillatory , just as predicted theoretically @xcite .",
    "if the field strength is sufficiently great , such a current - free toroidal field yields a magnetorotational instability even without an axial field ; the instability is simply non - axisymmetric rather than axisymmetric .",
    "the simultaneous occurrence of a stable differential rotation and a stable toroidal field may therefore nevertheless be unstable , provided that the magnetic reynolds number exceeds @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "in contrast to these magnetorotational instabilities , in which the magnetic field acts as a catalyst , but not as a source of energy , toroidal fields that are not current - free may become unstable more directly , by so - called current or tayler instabilities @xcite . because the source of energy is now the current rather than the differential rotation",
    ", these ( non - axisymmetric ) instabilities can exist even without any differential rotation , provided only the current is large enough .",
    "the magnitude depends quite strongly on the precise radial profile of the associated magnetic field @xmath1 , but not on the magnetic prandtl number .",
    "the topic of this paper is how tayler instabilities interact with differential rotation , and whether it might be possible to realize some of the resulting modes in laboratory experiments .",
    "the combination of tayler instabilities and differential rotation may also be relevant to a broad range of astrophysical problems , including the stability of the solar tachocline , the existence of active solar longitudes @xcite , the flip - flop phenomenon of stellar activity @xcite , a - star magnetism @xcite , and even the possibility of ` a differential rotation driven dynamo in a stably stratified star ' @xcite .",
    "according to the rayleigh criterion an ideal flow is stable against axisymmetric perturbations whenever the specific angular momentum increases outwards ( r^2)^2 > 0 , [ ray ] where ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 ) are cylindrical coordinates , and @xmath11 is the angular velocity .",
    "the necessary and sufficient condition for the axisymmetric stability of an ideal taylor - couette flow with an imposed azimuthal magnetic field @xmath12 is ( r^2)^2 - ( ) ^2 > 0 , [ mich ] where @xmath13 is the permeability and @xmath14 the density @xcite . in particular , _ all _ ideal flows can thus be destabilized , by azimuthal magnetic fields with the right profiles and amplitudes .",
    "any fields increasing outward more slowly than @xmath15 , including in particular the outwardly decreasing current - free field @xmath6 , have a stabilizing influence though @xcite .",
    "tayler @xcite found the necessary and sufficient condition - ( r b_^2 ) > 0 .",
    "[ tay ] for the non - axisymmetric stability of an ideal fluid at rest . outwardly increasing fields",
    "are therefore unstable now ( but @xmath6 is still stable )",
    ". if this condition ( [ tay ] ) is violated , the most unstable mode has azimuthal wavenumber @xmath3 . in this paper",
    "we wish to consider how these tayler instabilities are modified if the fluid is not at rest , but is instead differentially rotating .",
    "we will find that , depending on the magnitudes of the imposed differential rotation and magnetic fields , and also on the magnetic prandtl number , a magnetic field may either stabilize or destabilize the differential rotation , and the most unstable mode may be either the axisymmetric taylor vortex flow , or the non - axisymmetric tayler instability .",
    "we focus on the limit of small magnetic prandtl numbers appropriate for liquid metals , and calculate the rotation rates and electric currents that would be required to obtain some of these instabilities in liquid metal laboratory experiments .",
    "the governing equations are @xmath16 @xmath17 and  * u * =  * b * = 0 , [ mhd2 ] where @xmath18 is the velocity , @xmath19 the magnetic field , @xmath20 the pressure , @xmath21 the kinematic viscosity , and @xmath22 the magnetic diffusivity .    the basic state is @xmath23 and u_=r = a_r+ , b_=a_b r+ , [ basic ] where @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are constants defined by a_=_in , b_=_in r_in^2 , + a_b= , b_b = b_inr _ in , [ ab ] where @xmath28 @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the radii of the inner and outer cylinders , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are their rotation rates ( we will in fact fix @xmath33 for all results presented here ) , and @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the azimuthal magnetic fields at the inner and outer cylinders .",
    "the possible magnetic field solutions are plotted in fig .",
    "note though that  unlike @xmath11 , where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the physically relevant quantities  for @xmath12",
    "the fundamental quantities are not so much @xmath34 and @xmath35 , but rather @xmath26 and @xmath27 themselves . in particular , a field of the form @xmath36 is generated by running an axial current only through the inner region @xmath37 , whereas a field of the form @xmath38 is generated by running an axial current through the entire region @xmath39 , including the fluid .",
    "one of the aspects we will be interested in later on is how large these currents must be , and whether they could be generated in a laboratory experiment .",
    "we are interested in the linear stability of the basic state ( [ basic ] ) .",
    "the perturbed quantities of the system are given by u_r , r+u _ , u_z , b_r , b_+b _ , b_z .",
    "applying the usual normal mode analysis , we look for solutions of the linearized equations of the form f = f(r)exp(i(kz+m+t ) ) .",
    "[ nmode ] the dimensionless numbers of the problem are the magnetic prandtl number pm , the hartmann number ha , and the reynolds number re , given by = , = , = , [ pm ] where @xmath40 is the unit of length .    using ( [ nmode ] ) , linearizing the equations ( [ mhd ] ) and ( [ mhd1 ] ) , and representing the result as a system of first order equations , we have @xmath41 where @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are defined as @xmath45 length has been scaled by @xmath46 , time by @xmath47 , the basic state angular velocity by @xmath31 , the perturbation velocity by @xmath48 , and the magnetic fields , both basic state and perturbation , by @xmath34 .",
    "an appropriate set of ten boundary conditions is needed to solve the system ( [ syst ] ) . for the velocity the boundary conditions are always no - slip , u_r = u_=u_z=0 .",
    "[ ubnd ] for the magnetic field the boundary conditions depend on whether the walls are insulators or conductors .",
    "for conducting walls the radial component of the field and the tangential components of the current must vanish , yielding db_/dr + b_/r = b_r = 0 .",
    "[ bcond ] these boundary conditions are applied at both @xmath29 and @xmath30 .    for insulating walls",
    "the boundary conditions are somewhat more complicated ; matching to interior and exterior potential fields then yields b_=mkr b_z , b_r+ i b_z i_m(kr ) ( mkr i_m(kr)+i_m+1(kr))=0 , [ nonin ] at @xmath49 , and b_=mkr b_z ,",
    "b_r+ b_z k_m(kr ) ( mkr k_m(kr ) - k_m+1(kr))=0 [ nonout ] at @xmath50 , where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the modified bessel functions @xcite .",
    "given the basic state ( [ basic ] ) , tayler s stability condition ( [ tay ] ) to nonaxisymmetric perturbations becomes @xmath53 note that @xmath54 ( but is always less than 1 ) if @xmath55 .",
    "for @xmath56 we have @xmath57 .",
    "similarly , the stability condition to axisymmetric perturbations becomes @xmath58 for @xmath56 we have @xmath59 .",
    "for @xmath60 we always have @xmath61 , so that the stability interval ( [ m1 ] ) for @xmath3 is much smaller than the stability interval ( [ m0 ] ) for @xmath62 , as shown in fig .",
    "the current - free solution @xmath63 is of course always stable .",
    "figure [ pm1 ] shows how the stability curves depend on @xmath64 and @xmath65 , for @xmath66 , 1 , 0.1 and 0.01 , with @xmath67 ( stationary outer cylinder ) and @xmath68 ( @xmath12 as uniform as possible ) . for @xmath69",
    "we find that @xmath62 goes unstable before @xmath3 , at the critical reynolds number @xmath70 ; this is just the familiar value for the onset of nonmagnetic taylor vortices ( at this particular radius ratio ) .",
    "being entirely nonmagnetic , this value obviously does not depend on @xmath71 . at the other limiting case , @xmath4 , we find that only @xmath3 goes unstable , at the critical hartmann number @xmath72 .",
    "these tayler instabilities also turn out to be independent of @xmath71 , despite being driven by the magnetic field .",
    "we are interested in how these two limiting cases @xmath69 and @xmath4 are connected , and how the two types of instabilities interact when neither parameter is zero .",
    "the two instabilities certainly are connected ; the @xmath3 modes in the two limiting cases are smoothly joined to one another for all prandtl numbers .",
    "the nature of the interaction is quite different though , depending on @xmath71 .    turning to @xmath73 first",
    ", we see that there is relatively little interaction between rotational and magnetic effects ; instability simply sets in as long as either @xmath74 or @xmath75 . for @xmath66",
    "the situation is very different .",
    "there we find a broad range of parameters , for example @xmath76 and @xmath77 , that would be stable if rotational or magnetic effects were acting alone , but which are now unstable , due to the interaction between the two ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "finally , for @xmath78 we have the opposite situation , namely a range of parameters , for example @xmath76 and @xmath79 , that would be unstable if rotational effects were acting alone , but which are now stable .",
    "small pm are generally stabilizing .",
    "the opposite is true for @xmath80 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ pm1 ] ( top ) instability then also sets in for hartmann numbers less than 150 .",
    "in other words , for hartmann numbers exceeding around 50 , the critical reynolds number for the onset of instability is much smaller than 68 .",
    "having explored the general behavior for a range of magnetic prandtl numbers , we now focus attention on the limit of very small pm , such as would apply for experiments involving liquid metals . we will here consider conducting and insulating boundary conditions separately .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows results for various values of @xmath81 ; @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the same sign for the values on the left , and the opposite sign for the values on the right .",
    "the profile that is closest to being current - free is @xmath82 , and indeed we find there that even for ha=200 there is no sign of any destabilizing influence of the field , for either axisymmetric or nonaxisymmetric perturbations . for @xmath83 the magnetic field stabilizes the flow for both @xmath62 and @xmath3 .",
    "for @xmath84 the @xmath3 mode should be unstable , while the @xmath62 mode should be stable .",
    "the values @xmath68 and @xmath85 are examples of this situation .",
    "there is always a crossover point at which the most unstable mode changes from @xmath62 to @xmath3 .",
    "note also how for @xmath68 , the critical reynolds number increases for the @xmath62 mode , before suddenly decreasing for the @xmath3 mode ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , left bottom plot ) .",
    "we have the interesting situation therefore that weak fields initially stabilize the tc - flow , before stronger fields eventually destabilize it , via a non - axisymmetric mode . beyond @xmath86 ( the same value we saw previously in fig . [ pm1 ] ) , the flow is unstable even for @xmath4 .    except for the almost current - free profile @xmath82 ,",
    "all other values share this feature , that there is a critical hartmann number beyond which the basic state is unstable even for @xmath4 .",
    "let ha@xmath87 and ha@xmath88 denote these critical hartmann numbers , for @xmath62 and 1 respectively .",
    "for the profiles with the largest gradients both modes are unstable . strikingly , in these cases @xmath62 is always more unstable than @xmath3 , that is , @xmath89 , see the plots for @xmath90 and @xmath91 of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .",
    "let @xmath92 be the axial current inside the inner cylinder and @xmath93 the axial current through the fluid ( i.e. between inner and outer cylinder ) .",
    "the toroidal field amplitudes at the inner and outer cylinders are then b_in= , b_out= , [ bi ] where @xmath8 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 are measured in cm , gauss and ampere . expressing @xmath92 and @xmath93 in terms of our dimensionless parameters one finds i_axis= 5 ha   ( _ 0)^1/2 [ iin ] and i_fluid = i_axis , [ iout ] in ampere .",
    "note also how the required currents depend on the radius _ ratio _ @xmath96 , but not on the actual physical dimensions @xmath29 and @xmath30 . making the entire device bigger thus reduces the current _ density _ , inversely proportional to the square of the size . by making the device sufficiently large one",
    "can thereby prevent ohmic heating within the fluid from becoming excessive .",
    ".[tabmat ] material parameters of liquid metals that might be used for magnetic tc - experiments . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     calculations were also done for insulating cylinder walls ; the results are given in fig .",
    "they are generally similar as those for the conducting cylinders , but with one important exception .",
    "the @xmath62 and @xmath3 stability curves now almost always cross each other , as they do for conducting cylinders only for almost current - free @xmath12 profiles .",
    "one can again observe for not too steep profiles ( for @xmath97 ) how for weak fields the @xmath62 mode _ stabilizes _ the rotation until beyond the cross - over point the @xmath3 mode strongly _ destabilizes _ the rotation .",
    "we have shown how complex the interaction of magnetic fields and differential rotation can be in taylor - couette flows , including also a strong dependence on the magnetic prandtl number . for large pm",
    "the field destabilizes the differential rotation , whereas for small pm it stabilizes it .",
    "however , if the field ( or rather the current ) is too great , then the tayler instabilities will always destabilize any differential rotation .    in order to prepare laboratory experiments , we also did calculations at values of pm appropriate for liquid metals , for both conducting and insulating cylinder walls .",
    "in particular , we considered the almost uniform field profile @xmath68 . for both conducting and insulating boundaries , the field is initially stabilizing , but after the most unstable mode switches from @xmath62 to @xmath3 it is strongly destabilizing , until the pure tayler instability sets in even at @xmath4 .    for various gap widths and field profiles , we also computed the critical hartmann numbers and the corresponding electric currents .",
    "tables ii ",
    "vii give the required currents for both conducting and insulating walls ; note how insulating walls ( tables v  vii ) typically require lower currents than conducting walls ( tables ii  iv ) .",
    "the other clear trend is that the currents are lesser for wider gaps and greater for narrower gaps .",
    "an optimal experiment might therefore have @xmath98 , insulating walls , and @xmath68 , which would require only 6.84 ka even with gallium - indium - tin ( table v ) .",
