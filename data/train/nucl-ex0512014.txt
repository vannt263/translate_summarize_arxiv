    "this systematic effect is highly dependent on the operating conditions of the experiment .",
    "while experiments in small vessels and with high pressure buffer gas are expected to be relatively insensitive to the systematic effect , each of the proposed experiments will have to be analyzed in detail to judge its sensitivity to the effect and to find methods of dealing with it . in this work",
    "we introduce an analytic form of the correlation function which determines the behavior of the frequency shift @xcite and show in detail how it depends on the operating conditions of the experiment . for clarity",
    "we specialize the discussion to to the los alamos proposal for a neutron edm search using ultra - cold neutrons ( ucn ) and @xmath3 atoms diffusing in superfluid @xmath4 as a co - magnetometer , @xcite but the generalization to other cases is straightforward .",

    "harris and pendlbury , @xcite , this condition is strongly violated so our method can not be applied since the higher order terms remain significant .",
    "we see that in both the case of a velocity independent mean free path and one proportional to velocity the behavior of the systematic frequency shift is essentially unchanged .",
    "what is changed is the frequency where the effect goes to zero , i.e reduced frequency @xmath197 in the case ( 1 ) of a constant mean free path and @xmath198 for the case ( 2 ) of a mean free path proportional to velocity .",
    "this is because longer mean free paths contribute more to the frequency shift as seen from figure 1 , and thus higher velocities contribute more to case ( 2 ) .",
    "this shifts the effective frequency to higher values for the same value of reduced frequency .    due to the heavy mass and slow velocity of the @xmath3 , baym and ebner @xcite",

    "single phonon absorption is kinematically forbidden on a single @xmath3 and can only take place as a result of @xmath199 collisions which will be negligible for the low @xmath3 densities considered here .",
    "thus our approach , where we calculate the correlation function for an ensemble of trajectories with constant @xmath3 velocity and then average the result over the velocity distribution should be an excellent approximation .",
    "note that for temperatures @xmath200 so that according to fig.3 the limiting expression for the correlation function should be quite accurate and figures 10 and 11 , which are based on an exact average over the maxwell distribution of the @xmath3 velocities , imply that one should be able to control the effect to high degree .    what would be ideal , would be to set the size of the shift for @xmath3 to be slightly negative _",
    "i.e. _ equal in sign and magnitude with the shift for ucn .",
    "the ucn , with their relatively low value of @xmath201 ( @xmath202 have a frequency shift which is represented by a point far to the right in figure 1 )",
    ".    the limits on the ability to do this will be the usual experimental ones of the temperature and magnetic field gradient stability .",
    "we have shown that by varying the gradients to larger values it will be possible to measure the spectrum of the velocity correlation function directly , thus allowing a precise determination of the frequency dependence of the frequency shift under the exact experimental conditions .",

    "<S> a number of groups are planning a new generation of experiments using stored gases of various kinds . in order to achieve the target sensitivities it will be necessary to deal with the systematic error resulting from the interaction of the well - known @xmath0 field with magnetic field gradients ( often referred to as the geometric phase effect @xcite , @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this interaction produces a frequency shift linear in the electric field , mimicking an edm . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we introduce an analytic model for the correlation function which determines the behavior of the frequency shift @xcite and show in detail how it depends on the operating conditions of the experiment . </S>",
    "<S> we also propose a method to directly measure ths correlation function under the exact conditions of a given experiment . </S>"
