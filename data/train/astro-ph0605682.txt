    "the observations of supernova [ 1 , 2 ] , cosmic microwave background [ 3 , 4 ] and large scale structure [ 5 , 6 ] in recent years indicate that the universe is accelerating and thus some form of dark energy must exist in the universe to drive this acceleration .",
    "investigation on the nature of dark energy becomes one of the most important tasks for modern physics and modern astrophysics .",
    "up to now , many candidates of dark energy have been proposed to fit various observations which include the einstein s cosmological constant [ 7 ] , quintessence [ 8 ] , k - essence [ 9 ] , tachyon [ 10 ] , phantoms [ 11 ] , brans [ 12 ] and so on .",
    "there have also been some models of unified dark matter and dark energy [ 13 ] .",
    "padmanabhan and choudhury developed a model of unified matter and dark energy using a single tachyon field to explain both clustered dark matter at small scales and smooth dark energy at large scales .",
    "gonzalez - diaz investigated a model of the universe filled with a generalized chaplygin fluid which mimics both dark matter and dark energy .",
    "cardone et al have used a phenomenological approach to study the problem of unified dark matter and dark energy .",
    "susperregi has also developed a cosmological scenario where the dark matter and dark energy are two simultaneous manifestations of an inhomogeneous dilaton field . in his study , susperregi has constructed a dilaton potential with the `` trough '' feature .",
    "+ in this paper , we present a model of the universe dominated by the dilaton field with a liouville type potential .",
    "the potential is the counterpart of the einstein s cosmological constant in the dilaton gravity theory .",
    "since it can be reduced to the einstein cosmological constant when the dilaton field is set to zero , we call it the cosmological constant term in the dilaton gravity theory . +",
    "in ref.[14 ] , we have derived the action of dilaton field in the presence of einstein s cosmological constant @xmath0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath1,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is the liouville - type potential with respect to the cosmological constant , @xmath2 is the dilaton field , @xmath3 is the einstein s cosmological constant and @xmath4 is a free parameter which governs the strength of the coupling of the dilaton to the einstein s cosmological constant .",
    "when @xmath5 or @xmath6 , the action reduces to the usual einstein scalar theory and the potential becomes a pure cosmological constant . here the usual einstein s cosmological constant term appears not as a constant but as a coupling to the dilaton field which reveals the interaction of vacuum energy ( i.e. the dark energy today ) and dilaton matter .",
    "this implies that the potential plays the role of both matter and dark energy . in other words ,",
    "matter and dark energy might both originate from this unique potential .",
    "this is the starting point of our discussion . in the following",
    "we will investigate whether this potential can mimic the total energy of our universe .",
    "when @xmath7 , the action is just the susy potential in sting theory .",
    "it is apparent that changing the sign of @xmath4 is equivalent to changing the sign of @xmath2 .",
    "thus it is sufficient to consider only @xmath8 while @xmath2 may be positive or negative .",
    "+ recent measurements of the power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background detected a sharp peak around @xmath9 , indicating that the universe is highly likely flat .",
    "thus we only consider the flat universe which is dominated by the spatially homogeneous dilaton field and described by the flat friedmann - robertson - walker metric .",
    "+ the equations of motion can be reduced to three equations @xmath10 where dot denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath11 and @xmath12 is the scale factor of the universe .",
    "we find that the last equation can be derived from the former two .",
    "so it is sufficient to solve the first and the second equation .",
    "it follows immediately that @xmath13 where @xmath14\\equiv{\\dot{a}}/{a}$ ] is the hubble parameter .",
    "+ for an arbitrary @xmath4 , a solution of eq.(4 ) is given by @xmath15 since there is no integration constant in the solution @xmath16 , it is apparent @xmath16 is a special solution to eq.(4 ) .",
    "we are interested in that this special solution can actually describe the evolution of our universe . after inserting @xmath16 into eqs.(3 )",
    ", we can obtain the expressions of @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "so the equations of motion are resolved .",
    "we can now mimic the total energy of the universe using the single dilaton field . taking into account of @xmath19 ,",
    "we find from @xmath20 that when @xmath21 , @xmath2 is the monotonically decreasing function of @xmath22 . when @xmath23 , @xmath2 is the monotonically increasing function of @xmath24 .",
    "thus the positive dilaton field can never evolve to the negative one and vice versa . without the loss of generality ,",
    "we consider only the case of @xmath25 .",
    "+ from the equations of motion we can derive the scale factor of the universe @xmath17 , the energy density of dilaton field @xmath26 , the age of the present universe @xmath27 and",
    "the parameter of equation of state @xmath28 , @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the value of the field at the time of @xmath31 ( @xmath32 is the planck time ) and @xmath33 is the value today . since the evolution of the universe is from @xmath30 to @xmath33 , so @xmath30 is the lower limit and @xmath33 is the upper one .",
    "we have set the scale factor today equals to @xmath34 .",
    "+ among the equations of motion only two are independent , we can now recall the specific initial conditions with respect to @xmath35 and @xmath36 in eqs.(6 ) . throughout the paper",
    "we will employ the planck units in which the speed of light @xmath37 , gravitational constant @xmath38 and planck constant @xmath39 are all set equal to @xmath34 .",
    "then we have the planck energy density @xmath40 , planck time @xmath41 . since our discussion is starting from the planck time when the universe was filled with the extremely relativistic particles ( equation of state @xmath42 ) as required by the standard big bang model",
    ", so we have the energy density @xmath43 and state equation @xmath44 at the time of @xmath31 . given any value of @xmath4 in the expression of @xmath45 , we can numerically calculate the relationship between the equation of state @xmath45 and @xmath2 , as shown in fig.1 .",
    "we find that when @xmath46 and @xmath47 , @xmath48 , which corresponds to the equation of state of the universe at the planck time .",
    "consequently we take @xmath49 in the rest of the paper . + for the present universe , it has the critical energy density ( to make it flat ) and that it consists of @xmath50 [ 15 ] of matter and @xmath51 [ 15 ] of dark energy",
    ". then from the current parameters of equation of state , for matter @xmath52 and dark energy @xmath53 [ 16 ] , we get the parameter of the equation of state for the total energy @xmath54 ; the critical energy density @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is in the range of @xmath57 [ 15 ] for the present universe . in table",
    "@xmath58 , we summarize the age of the universe @xmath27 and the transition redshift from deceleration to acceleration @xmath59 evaluated with different combinations of @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath56 within their ranges given above . for brevity , we only show these certain combinations whose predictions are consistent with current results on the age of the universe and the transition redshift . +    .cosmic parameters evaluated with different @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath56 .",
    "the dimensions : @xmath62 .",
    "[ table : j_average ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     now let s inspect carefully whether the model satisfies the constraints from the astronomical observations and the standard big bang model .",
    "+ @xmath63 + table @xmath58 shows that many combinations predict the ages of the universe in agreement with @xmath64 gyr determined from globular clusters age [ 17 ] and @xmath65 gyr from radioisotopes studies [ 18 ] .",
    "it also doe not conflict the result of @xmath66 gyr from wmap , adss and sn ia data [ 15 ]",
    ". + @xmath67 + the range of transition redshift from deceleration to acceleration of the universe is constrained by @xmath68cdm [ 19 ] as @xmath69 , the current most stringent constraints of combined grb@xmath70sn ia data [ 20 ] @xmath71 and the joint analysis of sne+cmb data @xmath72 [ 21 ] . to satisfy the constraint of @xmath73 ,",
    "it is required that @xmath61 , i.e. , @xmath74 for @xmath75 , @xmath76 for @xmath77 and @xmath78 for @xmath79 . + @xmath80 + the energy density of the early universe can be approximated as @xmath81 , where @xmath82 denotes the temperature and @xmath83 denotes the effective number of degrees of freedom by taking into account the variety of particles at higher temperatures .",
    "we have @xmath84 and @xmath85 at the temperatures @xmath86 mev and @xmath87 mev , respectively [ 22 ] .",
    "the energy density required by bbn epoch is between @xmath88 ( @xmath86 mev ) and @xmath89 ( @xmath87 mev ) .",
    "then we have approximately the beginning time of bbn @xmath90 msec and the ending time of bbn @xmath91 sec .",
    "so the model doe not conflict the result of @xmath92 sec estimated by the bbn theory [ 22 ]",
    ". +     relations .",
    "( @xmath93 ) .",
    "dotted curve is for @xmath94 .",
    "when @xmath94 and @xmath95 , we have @xmath96 which is for the radiation - like dominated universe . for any @xmath4 , @xmath97 when @xmath98.,width=283 ]    , over - plotted on the 1-@xmath99 and 2-@xmath99 exclusion zones obtained by combining supernova ia and wmap observations [ fig.(2 ) ( upper panel ) in jassal et al].,width=302 ]    @xmath100 + when the dilaton field @xmath2 approaches zero , i.e. the cosmic time @xmath11 approaches infinity , we have @xmath101",
    ". then the universe evolves to de sitter universe in the distant future .",
    "so whether the dark energy of the present universe is quintessence @xmath102 or phantom @xmath103 , it will evolve into the pure cosmological constant in the future .",
    "frankly , we can not distinguish the dark energy component from the total energy density in general .",
    "however , since the matter scales as @xmath104 for low redshift , we can approximate the dark energy as @xmath105 . because the dark energy was less important in the past ,",
    "the most sensitive redshift interval for probing dark energy is @xmath106 .",
    "current observations of sn ia , cmb and lss have made constraints [ 23 ] on the evolution of @xmath107 at @xmath108 .",
    "fig.@xmath109 shows the evolution of the energy density of dark energy with redshift for one typical parameter in our models .",
    "our results also satisfy the recent most stringent constraints which comes from the results of sn ia , cmb and lss [ 23 ] .",
    "in conclusion , we have presented a big bang model of the universe dominated by dilaton field which can mimic the matter ( including dark matter ) and dark energy .",
    "the model predicted age of the universe , transition redshift , bbn and evolution of dark energy agree with current observations .",
    "future higher quality data , and especially from sn ia data and grb data ( because grbs are produced predominantly in the early universe [ 24 ] ) at higher redshifts may constrain the cosmic evolution of matter , dark energy and hubble constant more precisely and make critical tests on our model predictions . +",
