    "cachazo , he , and yuan ( chy ) proposed a formula for the @xmath0-gluon scattering amplitude in the tree approximation @xcite . unlike the textbook amplitude which is made up of a sum of feynman diagrams ,",
    "each built from a collection of vertices and propagators , the chy amplitude is a single global formula given by an @xmath3-dimensional complex integral .",
    "see equation in ",
    "ii for the exact expression .",
    "it is not immediately obvious how to break it down into a sum of feynman amplitudes , much less to obtain the local structure of vertices and propagators within each feynman diagram . to simplify description , ` feynman amplitudes '",
    "will be used throughout this paper to stand for amplitudes obtained in the text - book manner by summing feynman diagrams with feynman rules . yet , it is known since the beginning @xcite that it factorizes correctly in the collinear and the soft - gluon limits , just like feynman tree amplitudes do , and its equivalence to the feynman amplitude was proven @xcite by showing that it satisfies the britto - cachazo - feng - witten ( bcfw ) on - shell factorization formula @xcite . like the feynman scattering amplitude , it is gauge invariant in the sense that the same result is obtained by choosing any set of gauge - equivalent external polarization vectors .",
    "but unlike the feynman amplitude , there is no need to fix a gauge for the propagators , simply because there are no propagators in the chy formalism .",
    "instead , a new kind of ` gauge ' emerges from the invariance of the chy amplitude . for concrete computations ,",
    "it is necessary to choose three constants @xmath4 , as well as the pfaffian lines @xmath5 and @xmath6 in the chy formula to be discussed in the next section , in spite of the fact that the final scattering amplitude is independent of these choices . in this respect",
    "it is similar to the necessity of choosing a gauge for the propagators in evaluating a feynman amplitude .",
    "although we know that the chy amplitude must be the same as the feynman amplitude , it is not easy to calculate the amplitude directly from the chy formula .",
    "@xmath3 complex integrations must be performed , from which the momentum poles given by the feynman propagators must emerge .",
    "it must also give the feynman - amplitude numerators without the benefit of triple - gluon and four - gluon vertices which are absent in the chy formalism .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to discuss how the calculation can be carried out for any @xmath0 .",
    "it turns out that the chy amplitude arranges its terms quite differently than the feynman amplitude .",
    "whereas the latter is grouped according to feynman diagrams with a fixed set of propagators in the denominators , the former is grouped according to a fixed pattern of its numerators .",
    "the numerators of a feynman amplitude , assembled from the vertices , have a complicated form after a straight forward expansion .",
    "it depends on the topology of the feynman diagram and seems to have no discernible pattern between diagrams .",
    "its expansion into a function of dot products of external momenta and polarization vectors can only be obtained through tedious algebra .",
    "the denominators of a chy amplitude corresponding to a fixed pattern of the numerator has to be calculated by integration from its specific @xmath7-dependence , but a set of rules can be developed to determine the associated propagators .    before going into details of how computations are to be carried out , it might be useful to have a rough idea of the role played by each part of the chy integrand .",
    "other than the integration measure and a normalization factor , the integrand consists of two main parts .",
    "the first contains the product of scattering functions @xmath8 , present universally in all the chy amplitudes .",
    "it is the source of all propagators in the amplitude .",
    "every propagator of every feynman diagram originates here , so it is like a stem cell before differentiation .",
    "the differentiation or selection control comes from the @xmath2-dependent factors in the rest of the integrand .",
    "it picks out one or several dominant regions of integration , from which one or several feynman diagrams emerge .",
    "the second part consisting of the reduced pfaffian @xmath9 and a parke - taylor factor is where these controlling @xmath2 factors lie .",
    "the reduced pfaffian consists of many terms having different polarizations and momenta , each with a different @xmath7 dependence , and it is possible to group together terms in the reduced pfaffian with the same @xmath7 dependence . as a result , the chy amplitudes can be arranged according to numerator factors coming from terms of the reduced pfaffians with the same @xmath7 dependence , rather than identical denominator factors like in a feynman amplitude .",
    "integration over its @xmath7 dependence then produces products of propagators corresponding to one or several feynman diagrams .",
    "the groupings of the reduced pfaffian with the same @xmath7 factors will be discussed in  iii .",
    "there is a very useful ` shift invariance ' for the reduced pfaffian which can be used to check calculations . that will be discussed in sec .",
    "iv .    as in the feynman amplitude evaluation",
    ", simplification can be obtained by choosing a suitable representation for the transverse polarization vectors of the gluons .",
    "polarization vectors used in the spinor - helicity technique offers great simplifications , resulting for example in the celebrated parke - taylor formula @xcite for @xmath0-gluon amplitudes when all but two legs carry the same helicity .",
    "the same choice also simplifies chy amplitude calculations . for easy reference",
    ", we will refer to this choice of polarization vectors as the ` helicity gauge ' .",
    "its general properties are reviewed and how it is useful in calculating the chy amplitude is explained in  v.     vi discusses how the complex integrations in can be carried out using a technique developed in a previous paper @xcite for the chy double - color scalar amplitude .",
    "dominant regions in the @xmath3-dimensional complex space are picked out to present a pole in each of the @xmath3 successive integrations , to enable residue calculus to be used for evaluating the integral .",
    "this technique is applied to the evaluation of the @xmath10 , and @xmath11 amplitudes respectively in secs .",
    "vii , viii , and ix , and to the evaluation of amplitudes of a general @xmath0 in ",
    "x. double poles are discussed in  xii .",
    "the expansion of the reduced pfaffian depends on the choice of @xmath5 and @xmath6 , and the selection of the dominant integration regions depends on @xmath12 , though not on the values @xmath4 .",
    "this freedom is illustrated in the explicit examples in secs .",
    "vii and viii .",
    "calculation details differ from one choice to another , so with experience one can exploit this freedom to make a choice best suited for the problem .",
    "this independence can also be used to check the result of the calculations , as is done in secs .",
    "vii and viii .    in the chy approach",
    ", the triple - gluon vertex of the feynman amplitude can be reproduced in a @xmath13 calculation , as is done in  vii . to get the four - gluon vertex",
    ", one must carry out an @xmath14 calculation , without choosing the helicity gauge or any other gauge , then subtract out the contributions coming from the triple - gluon vertices .",
    "this is carried out in sec .",
    "the calculation is somewhat lengthy , but it does explicitly demonstrate the equivalence between the @xmath14 chy amplitude and the feynman amplitude in any gauge .    finally a summary is provided in  xiii .",
    "a color - stripped @xmath0-gluon scattering amplitude is given by the chy formula @xcite to be m^=@xmath15^n-3__(rst)^2@xmath16_(),where @xmath17 describes the color , expressed as a permutation of @xmath18 , in cycle notation .",

    "the reduced pfaffiann @xmath20 is invariant under any permutation of the external particles .",
    "it is related to the pfaffian of a matrix @xmath21 by =(-1)^++n(n+1)2^n-3_@xmath21,(<),where @xmath21 is obtained from the matrix @xmath22 with its @xmath5th and @xmath6th columns and rows removed .",
    "we need this normalization of @xmath20 , rather than the one used in ref .",
    "@xcite , to reproduce the parke - taylor formula @xcite .",
    "different normalizations may be more convenient for other purposes .",

    ".the non - diagonal elements of these three sub - matrices are a_ij = k_ik_j_ij , b_ij=_i._j_ij , c_ij=_ik_j_ij , -c^t_ij = k_i._j_ij , ( 1i = jn),where @xmath25 is the polarization of the @xmath26th gluon , satisfying @xmath27",
    ". the diagonal elements of @xmath28 and @xmath29 are zero , and that of @xmath30 is defined by c_ii=-_j=1^nc_ij , so that the column and row sums of @xmath30 is zero .",
    "a similar property is true for @xmath28 if the scattering equations @xmath31 are obeyed .",
    "this is the case because the integration contour @xmath32 encloses these zeros anticlockwise . _ _    for massless particles satisfying momentum conservation , the amplitude @xmath33 is independent on the choice of @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "it is also gauge invariant , in the sense that when any @xmath25 is replaced by @xmath34 , then the amplitude is zero .    if @xmath26 is a number between 1 and @xmath35 , its _ complement _ @xmath36 will be defined to be @xmath37 if @xmath38 , and @xmath39 if @xmath40 .",
    "one of @xmath41 is between 1 and @xmath0 , and that number will be denoted by @xmath42 . with this notation ,",

    "the momenta @xmath45 and @xmath46 do not seem to appear in @xmath20 because the rows and columns containing them are absent in @xmath21 .",
    "yet , the numerator of a feynman amplitude generally depends on all momenta , so how can these two momenta be absent ? the answer is , they are there but hidden inside @xmath47 .",

    "p=(-)^p_=1^n_p_2 - 1p_2.two permutations which differ by interchanging their @xmath56th and @xmath57th elements give the same @xmath58 , because @xmath22 is antisymmetric , and two permutations which permute the factors of also yield the same @xmath58 . in what follows",
    "we would use @xmath59 to indicate the sum over those independent permutations in @xmath60 which give rise to distinct @xmath58 .",
    "then a pfaffian of @xmath22 is defined by ( ) = _ p_p=12^n n!_ps_2n_p.the number of terms in @xmath61 is @xmath62 .",
    "the denominators of the non - diagonal matrix elements of @xmath63 in are the same . that property allows a simplification of @xmath61 in from a sum over @xmath64 to a sum over @xmath65 .",

    "there are @xmath114 such permutations in @xmath18 so the sum consists of @xmath114 terms .",

    "every matrix element in a closed cycle has the same number of @xmath118 and @xmath119 , hence the same number of @xmath120 and @xmath121 , whereas the matrix element in the open cycle has two more @xmath118 than @xmath119 , hence there is one more @xmath120 than @xmath121 .",
    "in particular , there must be at least one @xmath120 in this matrix element .",
    "this property will be crucial in rendering many cycle factors zero in the ` helicity gauge ' .",
    "there is another simple thing to note .",
    "every number @xmath122 between 1 and @xmath0 must appear in every @xmath113 once .",
    "if it resides in @xmath123 , then both @xmath124 and @xmath125 must appear .",
    "however , if @xmath126 or @xmath6 , then only @xmath124 is present , not @xmath125 .",
    "gauge invariance is the statement that @xmath127 if an @xmath25 is replaced by @xmath34 .",
    "this is easy to see in the present formalism because such replacement renders @xmath128 zero .",
    "the gauge amplitude is invariant under a transformation , @xmath129 .",
    "this is so because under such a transformation , _",
    "ij&&_ij/(_i+)(_j+ ) , + c_ii&&c_ii(_i+)^2 , + _ ( ) & & l _ ( ) , + &&/l , + @xmath130 & & l^2@xmath131 , + l&&1/_j=1^n(_j+)^2.it is this invariance of that allows @xmath19 to be chosen freely .",
    "now it can be verified that every one of the @xmath114 terms in also transforms like @xmath20 , hence when is used to expand the amplitude , every term of the amplitude is also invariant .",
    "this allows the values of @xmath19 to be chosen differently for different terms , a freedom which may be useful in simplifying calculation .",
    "let us illustrate the difference between the cycles in @xmath61 and @xmath9 with the @xmath14 example , assuming @xmath132 and @xmath133 . the allowed cycles for @xmath20 are now reduced to \\{[142](3 ) , [ 132](4 ) , [ 12](3)(4 ) , [ 12](34 ) , [ 1342 ] , [ 1432]},a total of @xmath134 terms , far smaller than the number of terms of @xmath61 appearing in .",
    "it is convenient to give the factors encountered in names to make them simpler to write .",
    "accordingly , the following abbreviations will be used throughout this article : a_ij = a_ji = k_ik_j , b_ij = b_ji=_i._j , c_ij=_ik_j.we may also add a superscript to indicate the helicity of a polarization vector @xmath118 .",
    "for example , @xmath135 .",

    "the latter condition is necessary because @xmath143 are not contained in @xmath20 except through @xmath144 , so a shift in either of them is meaningless .",
    "this invariance , which is true in any gauge , will be referred to as the _ shift invariance_.    shift invariance is a useful consequence of the chy theory because it can be used to check a calculation of @xmath20 .",

    ".    it can be verified by direct algebraic computation that the @xmath545 terms in add up to zero .",
    "as stated before , the @xmath546 terms in a @xmath119-cycle also add up to zero for any @xmath119 , and there is a simple reason for that .",
    "if we let @xmath547 for @xmath548 , and @xmath549 . the products of @xmath119 @xmath165",
    "s add up to zero because the sum is proportional to the determinant of the @xmath550 matrix @xmath551 .",
    "this determinant vanishes because its row sums are zero .",
    "with the @xmath545 terms gone , a factor @xmath552 , or @xmath553 is always present in every remaining term of @xmath20 .",
    "if we could use the three scattering equations @xmath554 to solve them in terms of @xmath555 , with @xmath556 and @xmath557 , then we would have transformed every double pole in @xmath20 into a product of simple poles , and the problem is solved .",
    "unfortunately this can not be done because the matrix to be inverted for the linear equation is singular , so the three scattering equations allows only two @xmath558 to be solved , but not 3 .",
    "moreover , the solution of these two depends on the value of the third , so the double pole can not be gotten rid of this way , for it still resides in the pole of the third quantity . for example , @xmath559 and @xmath560 can be solved in terms of @xmath561 and @xmath562 with @xmath556 and @xmath557 . as a result ,",
    "the double pole involving @xmath563 is still present .",
    "however , this remaining double pole involves only lines 1 and 2 , and can be solved by the method of  xiib .",
    "for example , consider the 8-point amplitude whose feynman diagram and crystal graph are shown in fig .  1 .",
    "the relevant part of the crystal graph is @xmath564 , with @xmath415 being the trigger and @xmath413 being the defect of the larger crystal @xmath565 . with this consideration",
    ", the double pole problem of the 3-cycle ( 123 ) in the larger crystal becomes the double pole problem in the smaller crystal @xmath566 for the 2-cycle ( 12 ) .",
    "note that this procedure relies on the fact that the @xmath208 in a smaller crystal is much smaller than that in a larger crystal .",
    "for that reason , when @xmath567 is used to solve for @xmath568 , the term @xmath560 can be ignored .",
    "otherwise the problem is not solved because the solutions would have become circular .",
    "similarly , we know that in the presence of a @xmath119-cycle involving lines @xmath569 , the @xmath546 terms in @xmath20 together with those from all the other relevant product cycles add up to zero .",
    "we will use the letters @xmath516 to denote numbers between 1 and @xmath119 , and the letter @xmath188 to denote a numbers larger than @xmath119 . in every remaining term in @xmath20 , at least one factor @xmath570 is present , and altogether there are @xmath571 such factors .",
    "using the the scattering equations @xmath31 , which is of rank @xmath572 , we can solve @xmath572 of the @xmath573 in terms of the rest .",
    "let us choose those @xmath572 factors to be @xmath574 , with @xmath575 .",
    "after that , all the double pole terms become double pole terms involving @xmath576 , where @xmath577 , thereby reducing the double pole problem of the @xmath119-cycle into a double pole problem for @xmath502-cycle .",
    "since @xmath208 in a smaller crystal is much smaller than that in a larger crystal , by induction , all double pole problems can be solved this way .",
    "the evaluation of the chy @xmath0-point gauge tree amplitude in is discussed .",
    "there are two basic difficulties : how to handle the @xmath156 terms in the reduced pfaffian , and how to carry out the @xmath3 integrations in the presence of a @xmath7 dependence much more complicated than the parke - taylor form found in the chy double - color scalar amplitude .",
    "we found a way to solve the first difficulty by grouping together terms of the reduced pfaffian into open and closed cycles of the permutation group @xmath18 .",
    "we discovered a shift invariance for individual cycles which can be used to check explicit calculations .",
    "the use of helicity gauge to further simplify calculations has also been amply discussed .",
    "integrations are carried out by dividing the dominant integration regions into @xmath3 compatible ` crystals ' , each possessing a pole that can be evaluated in one of the @xmath3 integrations using residue calculus .",
    "a complete recipe is provided when only simple poles are present to extract the @xmath3 feynman diagram propagators , with different compatible crystals giving rise to different feynman diagrams .",
    "a recipe making use of the ` crystal graph ' is also given to convert the @xmath208 factors in the reduced pfaffian into constants , after which the reduced pfaffian can be identified as the numerator of the feynman diagram .",
    "double poles are rarely present in small-@xmath0 amplitudes , but when they appear in large-@xmath0 amplitudes , there will be more contribution to the amplitude in addition to what is given by the recipes above .",
    "these double poles can also be handled .",
    "calculations depend on a set of gauge parameters : the constant lines @xmath12 , the pfaffian lines @xmath103 , and the helicity reference lines @xmath211 in the helicity gauge .",
    "although the final answer must not depend on the choice , they have to be fixed in a calculation , and the structure and complexity of the calculation depend on their choice .",
    "many examples are given for the @xmath578 amplitudes to illustrate these calculations .",
    "unlike the feynman amplitude , the chy amplitude is global without the built - in local parts in the form of vertices and propagators .",
    "propagators turn out to emerge from the scattering functions @xmath8 , but the vertices are harder to extract . we have been successful in extracting the triple - gluon vertex from the @xmath13 amplitude , and the four - gluon vertex from the @xmath14 amplitude . the calculation for the latter is somewhat lengthy .    both the chy formula and the feynman - diagram technique give the same scattering amplitude , but they group their terms differently . roughly speaking , the chy amplitude groups by numerator , and the feynman amplitude groups by denominator .",
    "the numerator factors in chy amplitudes are universal for all @xmath0 , being the cycles of the reduced pfaffian .",
    "its denominators , however , have to be computed by integration , and a single numerator cycle may involve propagators from several feynman diagrams .",
    "in contrast , feynman amplitudes are arranged according to feynman diagrams whose propagators are easy to write down , but its numerator factors have to be built up from products of triple and four gluon vertices .",
    "detailed algebraic manipulation which depends on the topology of the feynman diagram is needed to expand into its final form as a function of @xmath579 and @xmath580 .",
    "since complication of a gluon amplitude comes largely from its numerator factors , especially for large @xmath0 , there is a definite advantage in computing it in the numerator - grouping approach .",
    "another advantage is that the chy formula has many invariances that can be used to check the calculations .",
    "they all stem from the basic invariance of the chy amplitude , including the shift invariance , and the independence of the amplitude on the choice of the gauge parameters @xmath581 .",
    "the disadvantage of the chy formalism is the lack of visible local structures in terms of propagators and vertices , to enable the underlying physical process to be easily understood .",
