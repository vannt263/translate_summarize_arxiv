    "is realized by exploiting the increased spatial degrees of freedom and beamforming gain . in large distributed mimo systems",
    "where the antennas are distributed geographically , enhanced energy efficiency is achieved from shortened distances between antennas and users as well as improved spectral efficiency per unit area .",
    "there are a number of prior works on large mimo networks , including various topics such as information theoretical capacity @xcite , transceiver design @xcite , csi acquisition , and pilot contamination @xcite . in particular , various downlink precoding schemes have been proposed and analyzed .",
    "remarkably , the simple zero - forcing ( zf ) precoding is shown to achieve most of the capacity of large mimo downlink @xcite .",
    "one of the main challenges towards achieving the performance predicted by the theoretical analysis is how to obtain the csi at the transmitter ( csit ) for a large number of antennas . in most of the existing works , time - division duplex ( tdd )",
    "is assumed and channel reciprocity can be exploited to obtain csit via uplink pilot training . in @xcite ,",
    "random matrix theory is used to analyze the asymptotic performance of zf and rzf @xcite in both tdd and fdd systems , with a focus on the case when all the antennas are collocated at a bs . for fdd systems , the amount of csi feedback required to maintain a constant per - user rate gap from the perfect csit case has also been analyzed in @xcite under the assumption of perfect csi estimation at the users . in practice , we need @xmath6 orthogonal pilot sequences to estimate the channel corresponding to the @xmath6 transmit antennas . however , the number of available orthogonal pilot sequences is limited by the channel coherent time and it may become smaller than @xmath6 as @xmath6 grows large .    in this paper , we consider large distributed mimo networks operating in fdd mode in which there are @xmath6 distributed antennas ( thin bss ) linked together by high speed fiber backhaul as illustrated in fig .",
