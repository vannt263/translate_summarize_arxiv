    "this result is determined by the condition that the hydrodynamic time for the shock wave to cross the shock thickness is approximately equal to the diffusion time for the radiation .",
    "when the shock front reaches a position that is at an optical depth of @xmath2 from the surface , radiation can diffuse out to optically thin layers and shock breakout occurs . for low circumstellar densities ,",

    "the result is that the radiated energy in the breakout is not changed , but the radiation is emitted over a longer period of time , lowering the luminosity .",

    "a general expectation of the shock breakout model is that the initial rise to maximum luminosity should be primarily due to heating of the photosphere as the shock wave begins to affect the stellar emission .",

    "the rise time to maximum , 40 days , is an indicator of the density of the circumstellar gas .",
    "the supernova radiation is expected to be efficiently radiated , so that the radiated energy is a significant fraction of the supernova energy if the energy is thermalized by the interaction .. interestingly , the light curve is similar in shape to that of sn 2006gy , but the absolute magnitude is fainter by 5 magnitudes , with a radiated energy @xmath13 ergs .",

    "this evolution is naturally explained in the shock breakout view ( ( * ? ? ?",

    "however , the rise to luminosity maximum did not show the increasing temperature that might be expected in the breakout scenario and there is no spectral evidence for circumstellar interaction , so the nature of the event is still in doubt .",
    "overall , the shock breakout scenario is attractive for the events that show narrow line spectra because there is evidence for slowly expanding circumstellar matter ahead of the shock front .",
    "when these lines are not present , there is no clear evidence for dense circumstellar matter .",
    "there may be more than one mechanism that gives rise to very luminous supernovae .",

    "there may initially be radiative acceleration of the unshocked gas , so that a viscous shock does not initially form , but , if the circumstellar medium is extended , the formation of a viscous shock in inevitable .",
    "the maximum optical depth at which it can form is somewhat less than @xmath7 .    at low circumstellar densities the emission from the reverse shock dominates that from the forward shock",
    "because the density is higher and the shock velocity is lower , @xmath20 km s@xmath17 or less .",
    "however , as the circumstellar density rises , the reverse shock becomes radiative first , which leads a lower increase in luminosity with increasing density and to a dense shell that can absorb radiation from the reverse shock , thus affecting the x - ray luminosity .",
    "the forward shock , with a velocity of 1000 s of km s@xmath17 or more , can heat gas to a temperature of @xmath21 kev , where @xmath22 is the shock velocity in units of @xmath23 km s@xmath17 .",
    "* katz et al . ( 2011 ) ) found that inverse compton cooling can balance the shock heating at a temperature of 60 kev if the optical depth is @xmath7 ( breakout conditions ) and the shock velocity is @xmath23 km s@xmath17 .",
    "this estimate assumed that the electrons are heated only by coulomb collisions with the ions . if there is additional collisionless heating , the gas temperature is raised .",
    "* chevalier & irwin ( 2012 ) ) estimated regions of the shock velocity vs circumstellar density plane where the cooling time is short compared to the age and where inverse compton cooling is larger than bremsstralung cooling .",
    "the regime where the cooling is rapid roughly overlaps the regime where the electron scattering optical depth is @xmath24 .",
    "if inverse compton losses are larger than bremsstrahlung , the x - ray emission from the hot shocked gas is reduced as a fraction of the shock power .",
    "the x - rays that are emitted by the hot gas have to propagate through the preshock circumstellar medium .",
    "one effect of the surrounding medium is compton recoil ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chevalier & irwin 2012 ) , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* svirski et al . 2012 ) ) , which reduces the energies of the high energy photons to a maximum of @xmath25 kev , where @xmath26 is the electron scattering optical depth and is assumed @xmath27 .",
    "it can be seen that @xmath28 is necessary to have an effect in the energy range around 10 kev that is accessible to x - ray telescopes like _ chandra_. _ nustar _ , with its sensitivity to 80 kev , has a better chance of detecting this effect .",
    "another effect is photoabsorption by the preshock medium ( ( * ? ? ? * chevalier & irwin 2012 ) ) , which has a larger effect at low x - ray energies .",
    "an important aspect of photoabsorption is that its occurrence requires that the absorbing medium not be completely ionized . for the x - ray emission that is expected from the hot gas",

    "* chevalier & irwin 2012 ) ) .",
    "complete ionization is expected at higher shock velocities @xmath29 km s@xmath17 , but not at lower velocities , @xmath30 km s@xmath17 .",
