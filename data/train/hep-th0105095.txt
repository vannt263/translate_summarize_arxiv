    "@xmath4-branes interacting with higher form rr - fields ( @xmath5-form for example ) become @xmath6-branes , which was first suggested by emparan @xcite and nontrivial interactions were explicitly obtained by myers @xcite . in the presence of magnetic rr - fields ,",
    "these interactions are caused by the motion of the branes . with the motion in compact space ( thus carrying angular momentum ) , the higher dimensional brane increases its size .",
    "since the size is bounded in the compact space , the angular momentum is also bounded .",
    "this fact possibly explains the stringy exclusion principle in the dual gravity setup @xcite .",
    "recently mateos and townsend showed that this angular momentum can be given in a different guise @xcite . in some special setup of tubular @xmath7-brane",
    ", the poynting vector of the electromagnetic field on the @xmath7 world - volume provides the angular momentum .",
    "this can be thought of as the ` blown - up ' configuration of a bunch of @xmath2 superstrings with @xmath3-branes evenly distributed on it .",
    "it is self - supported from collapse by the angular momentum supplied by the electric and magnetic field associated with the number of @xmath2 superstrings and @xmath3-branes respectively .",
    "the important fact is that the tube solution preserves one quarter of supersymmetry .",
    "this was generically possible for the intersecting @xmath8-branes with relative codimension four @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we pursue the issue further to see how this effect can be understood in the t - dual setup .",
    "several string duality transformations will yield straightforward generalizations of supertube . in ref .",
    "@xcite , s - dual configurations ( therefore of m theory ) to the supertube were also discussed .",
    "these configurations will generate lots of lower dimensional descendants upon different compactifications , which are to be related with one another via u - dualities .",
    "although these are the naive expectations , recent interests @xcite on this subject warrant to produce more explicit results .",
    "we first show that an array of @xmath4-brane @xmath9 along some axis , say @xmath10-axis ( see eq .",
    "( [ metric ] ) ) , when threaded vertically by superstrings over the entire volume of @xmath4-branes , is ` blown - up ' to @xmath11-brane of topology @xmath12 acquiring extra tubular two dimensions .",
    "this is obtained by taking t - duality along various directions transverse to @xmath2 superstrings carrying @xmath3-brane charges .",
    "the radius of the circle @xmath13 is invariant under these t - dualities .",
    "an astonishing result is obtained when we take t - duality along the axial direction of the configuration .",
    "the bound state of @xmath3-branes and @xmath2 superstrings becomes that of @xmath0-branes with @xmath1 superstrings moving in one direction on it .",
    "we show that its corresponding ` blown - up ' configuration is a single helical @xmath0-brane ( @xmath8-helix ) traveling with the speed of light along its axis .",
    "this is peculiar in that the dimensionality is not changed upon the ` blowing - up ' .",
    "this @xmath8-helix should be related with the helical @xmath2 string discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite via a sequence of s- and t - duality .",
    "before transferring to the next section , we start by briefly recapitulating the results of ref .",
    "@xcite , where the configuration of @xmath3-branes evenly arrayed along @xmath10-direction and threaded by a bunch of @xmath2 superstrings was considered .",
    "the configuration is embedded in flat geometry parametrized as @xmath14 therefore it is free from any background gravitational effect and also there is no background field of any kind .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that this can be considered as zero radius limit of tubular @xmath7-brane .",
    "@xmath3-brane charge is ` dissolved ' as magnetic flux on @xmath7-brane while @xmath2 superstrings are dissolved as the electric field along @xmath10-direction .    with the static gauge for the world - volume",
    "coordinates @xmath15 on @xmath7-brane , born - infeld ( bi ) 2-form field strength is given by @xmath16 the lagrangian for the tubular @xmath7-brane is that of dirac - born - infeld ( dbi ) simplified as @xmath17 for fixed momentum @xmath18 and magnetic field @xmath19 , the hamiltonian @xmath20 is minimized at @xmath21 .",
    "the same physics can be viewed from @xmath3-brane side . in this case",
    ", the system is described by the matrix model .",
    "some extended solutions including multi - supertube configurations were found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the next section ,",
    "we consider the cases of planar @xmath4-brane array threaded vertically by superstrings .",
    "these are obtained by t - dual transformation along various directions transverse to the @xmath2 superstrings carrying @xmath3-brane charge . in section iii , we study the case obtained by t - dual transformation along longitudinal direction of the original configuration . we show that the blown - up configuration is the helical @xmath0-brane moving with light velocity along its axis . in section iv , we show explicitly @xmath22 of the supersymmetry of @xmath1 minkowski vacuum is preserved in the @xmath8-helix configuration . in the last section we conclude with some discussions and remarks on further works .",
    "the first question that arises from the supertube physics is whether similar ` blowing - up ' happens in @xmath1 setup .",
    "one simple way to see this is to take t - duality along some directions for the original @xmath2 superstrings carrying @xmath3-brane charge and check whether the same t - duality for the supertube gives sensible ` blown - up ' configuration .",
    "this is based on the fact that supersymmetry is preserved under t - duality @xcite . since the supertube configuration encodes those charges of @xmath3-brane array and @xmath2 superstrings , so must do its t - dual counterpart .",
    "we first take t - duality along some directions transverse to @xmath2 superstring . the @xmath3-brane array threaded by @xmath2 superstrings",
    "are dualized to be @xmath0 array crossed by a bunch of @xmath1 superstrings .",
    "we expect @xmath23-brane of topology @xmath24 as the ` blown - up ' configuration .",
    "this @xmath23-brane is nothing but t - dual version of @xmath2 supertube . to be more specific ,",
    "we take @xmath25-direction of @xmath26 as the t - dual direction .    taking t - duality directly on dbi action",
    "is not simple .",
    "it is very obscure in the dbi action to start from @xmath27 matrix and constrain its components ( using orbifold technique used in ref .",
    "@xcite ) to describe @xmath8-brane array along some compact direction .",
    "instead we take an indirect way . with the knowledge about bi fields on the @xmath23-brane which encodes the dissolved @xmath0-branes and @xmath1 superstrings",
    ", we construct dbi action for this @xmath1 setup . on the resulting @xmath23-brane ,",
    "the array of @xmath0-branes is dissolved as magnetic flux and the number of @xmath1 superstrings is encoded as the electric field along @xmath10-direction . in the static gauge for the additional world - volume coordinate @xmath28 , the flat geometry induced on the world - volume and the bi fields become @xmath29",
    "one can see @xmath23 brane of topology @xmath24 is ` blown - up ' to have non - vanishing size of circle direction because dbi lagrangian constructed from the above configuration is the same as that of the supertube .",
    "the basic reason why this gives the same results as @xmath2 case is that t - duality along @xmath25 preserves the relative codimension of @xmath7-brane and @xmath3-branes dissolved in it .",
    "hence the same results will be obtained for further t - dualities along the directions along @xmath30 .",
    "summing up the result for an array of @xmath4-brane @xmath9 along @xmath10-axis , we can say as follows ; when threaded vertically by superstrings over the entire volume of @xmath4-brane , it is ` blown - up ' to @xmath11-brane .",
    "the extra two dimensions acquired is tubular extended along @xmath10-direction and embedded in the residual dimensions . in all cases the stabilized radius is the same and governed by ns field @xmath31 of the superstrings , and the magnetic field @xmath19 which is produced effectively by @xmath4-branes dissolved in the @xmath11-brane .",
    "in this section we deal with another @xmath1 setup , by taking t - duality along @xmath10-direction .",
    "the basic question here is about the @xmath1 counterpart of the supertube .",
    "@xmath3-brane array threaded by @xmath2 superstrings is t - dual to @xmath0-branes along which @xmath1 superstrings are traveling in one direction .",
    "since the former configuration is not stable in @xmath2 setup , neither should be the latter . at first sight",
    ", one might think this latter system will be blown up to @xmath23-brane acquiring extra spherical two dimensions because there is no two dimensional object in @xmath1 setup .",
    "we show below that this is not the case .",
    "actually the stabilized configuration remains one - dimensional .",
    "it turns out to be a @xmath8-helix with axial momentum flow , whose radius is the same as that of the supertube .",
    "the basic tool is again t - duality acting on the supertube . in order to see the resulting configuration , we study the boundary conditions of @xmath1 superstring .",
    "these can be obtained by t - dualizing the boundary conditions of @xmath2 superstrings living on the supertube ; @xmath32 t - duality along @xmath33-direction interchanges @xmath34 with @xmath35 .",
    "with @xmath36 denoting t - dualized coordinates , the above boundary conditions are t - dualized as @xmath37 from the second condition , we note the hypersurface @xmath38 ( with the omitted conditions for other transverse directions ) defines @xmath0 world - sheet .",
    "we take the constant @xmath39 to be zero for simplicity .",
    "the other two conditions define the longitudinal directions of @xmath0-brane .",
    "since both of them are neumann conditions , one can take arbitrary two independent combinations of the coordinates @xmath40 and @xmath41 to make one temporal coordinate and one spatial coordinate .",
    "the simplest choice will be the ` orthonormal ' pair @xmath42 .",
    "this choice is transparent if we see dual background geometry obtained by buscher s duality @xcite ;    @xmath43    where one can easily see the relation between the orthonormal coordinates @xmath44 and the tilted coordinates @xmath45 ;    @xmath46    in the tilted coordinates , @xmath0 brane is defined by the hypersurface @xmath47 .",
    "the other coordinates @xmath48 are orthonormal longitudinal coordinates .",
    "the metric induced on the hypersurface @xmath49 becomes    @xmath50    from which one gets dbi lagrangian ( in static gauge as @xmath51 ) ; @xmath52    the dbi lagrangian is of the same form as that of @xmath2 case .",
    "this is what we expected because t - duality in general leaves the @xmath8-brane action invariant .",
    "the only difference is the change of some field strength components into the derivatives of transverse scalar @xmath53 , which now denote transverse fluctuations of @xmath0-brane with respect to the world - sheet coordinates . in the case at hand",
    ", we can see this explicitly in the relation @xmath54 .",
    "@xmath55    therefore @xmath31 is now the axial velocity of the @xmath8-helix .",
    "fig.1 summarizes the configuration .    as in the case of the supertube , the equations of motion just tells us that the momentum @xmath56 is conserved .",
    "the momentum @xmath56 stabilizes the radius of @xmath8-helix as @xmath21 , at which the velocity becomes the speed of light @xmath57 and hamiltonian saturates its bound as @xmath58 .",
    "one could consider the @xmath1 strings traveling along @xmath8-helix .",
    "however , uniform motion of those strings are not physical because of the world - sheet reparametrization symmetry .",
    "1 : the solid square represents @xmath0 world - sheet . in the presence of @xmath59 ,",
    "@xmath0-brane is not static .",
    "it is tilted with an angle of @xmath60 , thus helical .",
    "the helix pitch is @xmath61 .",
    "in this section we show that the above @xmath8-helix configuration preserves one quarter of supersymmetry as in the case of the supertube .",
    "this is , in fact , easy to understand because t - duality in general preserves supersymmetry @xcite .",
    "however , it looks not so transparent to see supersymmetry directly in the @xmath8-helix configuration . here",
    "we give a rigorous proof of that .",
    "we closely follow the procedure of ref .",
    "supersymmetry is determined by the independent killing spinors @xmath62 satisfying @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the matrix defining @xmath65-transformation on the world - volume of @xmath8-branes @xcite . in @xmath1 case at hand , it is @xmath66 where @xmath67 and static gauge is chosen .",
    "therefore the killing spinor relation ( [ killing ] ) becomes @xmath68    in @xmath1 case , chiral projection should be understood for the above spinors , so for @xmath69-component spinors @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details . ) taking into account positive chirality components , we can put @xmath72 therefore they are effectively @xmath73-component spinors .    in order to delimitate",
    "the coordinate dependent part of the spinors , we make use of the fact that killing vectors can be written as bilinears of killing spinors ; @xmath74 @xcite . in flat geometry , killing spinors can be written as @xmath75 where @xmath76 s are constant spinors and @xmath77 are lorentz transformation acting on the chiral spinors .",
    "( note that @xmath78 are of the same chirality . ) with this in mind , one sees the killing spinor relation ( [ killing2 ] ) , i.e. , @xmath79 becomes @xmath80    in order to satisfy the above relation for arbitrary value of @xmath81 , the first two terms and the last term should vanish separately ; @xmath82 from the second relation , we see @xmath83 , from which it is clear that @xmath57 .",
    "( this was also obtained when we insert @xmath21 into the expression of @xmath31 . )",
    "therefore @xmath8-helix should travel with the speed of light on its axis to make the configuration supersymmetric . with this value of",
    "@xmath31 inserted , the first relation of eq .",
    "( [ killing3 ] ) tells us that @xmath84 hence @xmath85 can be written in terms of @xmath86 .",
    "since @xmath86 is constrained by the projection operator @xmath87 , only @xmath88 components of killing spinors remain independent ; thereby one quarter supersymmetry of @xmath1 vacuum are preserved for the configuration .",
    "in this paper , we studied the supertube physics in the t - dual setup . in the transversely t - dual case",
    ", the result looks somewhat plain ; blowing - up effect happens for an array of @xmath8-branes when they are threaded by superstrings .",
    "however , we have to mention one interesting point .",
    "in the case of @xmath0 array crossed by superstring array , we can see why the stabilized radius is expressed by the product of @xmath56 and @xmath19 . if we take the s - duality , the role of @xmath0-branes and that of superstrings are interchanged . in order for the radius to be invariant under s - duality , its square ( by dimensional analysis ) should be proportional to @xmath89 .    in the longitudinally t - dual case",
    ", we showed that a bunch of @xmath0-branes with @xmath1 superstrings moving in one direction along the branes is ` blown - up ' to a @xmath8-helix traveling with the speed of light along its axis .",
    "it carries @xmath22 of the supersymmetry of @xmath1 vacuum .",
    "one could consider @xmath23-brane of topology @xmath90 as the blown - up configuration of the aforementioned @xmath1 case .",
    "however , that configuration is not consistent with @xmath2 result because it can not be obtained by t - duality from the supertube configuration .",
    "in fact , when one construct dbi action by assuming flat geometry in the spherical polar coordinates and ns b field over the spherical part of the topology , the stabilized radius is vanishing .",
    "spherically blown - up configurations can be possible only with appropriate background fields .",
    "some examples are given in ref .",
    "@xcite and other examples include @xmath8-branes embedded in the flux branes @xcite    the helical configuration of @xmath8-branes appeared in a different context . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a double helix connected to each other by fundamental strings is obtained by t - dualizing the @xmath8-brane setup of quantum hall soliton @xcite . with some additional input of @xmath8-branes ( such as an array of @xmath91-branes along @xmath10-axis , which is transverse to their world - volume , and t - duality as before )",
    "the super @xmath8-helix considered in this paper could be a starting point to study such a system further .",
    "finally , we mention two related problems to be solved .",
    "the first one concerns the well - known bound state of @xmath0/@xmath92-branes . as for an array of @xmath23-branes threaded vertically by @xmath1 superstrings",
    ", one can apply the s - duality to change these superstrings into the same number of @xmath0-branes .",
    "subsequent t - dualities along the direction of @xmath0-branes and another direction transverse to both branes result in the familiar @xmath0/@xmath92 bound state .",
    "the same sequence of dualities applied to the blown - up version of the initial configuration result in the kaluza - klein monopole - like configuration @xcite .",
    "this is very puzzling .",
    "if blowing - up effect is preserved under u - duality , the result of supertube predicts that @xmath0/@xmath92 bound state is indeed unstable ( even though it is known as a typical one - quarter supersymmetric state ) and should be understood as a kaluza - klein monopole - like configuration .",
    "the same argument applies to the @xmath3/@xmath93 bound state , which is to be blown - up to @xmath94 brane wrapping a trivial homology cycle .",
    "this nontrivial observation can not be easily understood by direct consideration of @xmath0/@xmath92 without recourse to s- and t - duality .",
    "further study on this should be pursued .",
    "the second one is another t - duality which is not considered in this paper .",
    "it is the t - duality along the angular direction of the supertube .",
    "this duality is quite intriguing as it involves a fixed point . since",
    "the resulting geometry is singular , it should be taken with care .",
    "this will be studied elsewhere .",
