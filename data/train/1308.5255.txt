    "supernova ( sn ) neutrinos represent a subject of large interest in astroparticle physics  @xcite . in particular , renewed attention is being paid to collective features of flavor transformations   induced by @xmath4-@xmath4 self - interactions in the deepest stellar regions  @xcite ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "the most important observational consequence of these effects is the `` swap '' of the @xmath2 and @xmath3 spectra with the non - electron @xmath5 and @xmath6 spectra in certain energy ranges  @xcite , marked by the `` splits '' , which are the boundary features at the edges of each swap interval .",
    "one major challenge in the characterization of the self - induced effects on the sn neutrino flavor evolution is related to the the current - current nature of low - energy weak interactions , which implies a `` multi - angle term ''  @xcite , @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the neutrino velocity  @xcite . till",
    "recently , all studies have assumed the axial symmetry for the multi - angle kernel , reducing it to a `` multi - zenith - angle '' ( mza ) term . in a non - isotropic medium",
    "this mza term would not average to zero , producing a different refractive index for neutrinos propagating on different trajectories , something challenging the maintenance of the collective effects  @xcite .",
    "recently , by means of a stability analysis of the linearized neutrino equations of motion  @xcite , it has been pointed out that removing the assumption of axial symmetry in the @xmath4 propagation , a new multi - azimuthal - angle ( maa ) instability would emerge in the flavor evolution of the dense sn neutrino gas in addition to the one caused by the mza effects .",
    "subsequently , the role of this instability has been clarified in  @xcite , where it has been shown with simple toy models that , introducing small deviations in the assumed symmetries of the initial conditions in a dense @xmath4 gas , new instabilities would be triggered .",
    "the presence of maa effects would unavoidably imply the breaking of the spherical symmetry in the flavor evolution after the onset of the conversions .",
    "this would lead to a challenging multi - dimensional problem involving partial differential equations .",
    "however , assuming that the variations of the global solution in the direction transverse to the radial ones are small , one can study the local solution along a given line of sight , without worrying about the global behavior of the solution .",
    "this approach , even if not completely self - consistent , allowed to obtain the first numerical solutions of the non - linear neutrino propagation equations in sn , introducing the azimuthal angle as angular variable in addition to the usual zenith angle in the multi - angle kernel . in the simulations performed in  @xcite , we considered simple energy spectra with an excess of @xmath2 over @xmath3 . in these cases , we found that even starting with a complete axial symmetric neutrino emission , the maa effects would lead to significant flavor conversions in normal mass hierarchy ( nh , @xmath9 ) , in cases otherwise stable under the only mza effects .",
    "depending on the flavor asymmetry between @xmath2 and @xmath3 , maa effects could lead to spectral swaps and splits ( for large asymmetry ) or to flavor decoherence ( for small asymmetry ) .",
    "the purpose of this follow - up work is to take a closer look to the maa effects , considering realistic sn neutrino fluxes .",
    "we will perform at first a stability analysis of the linearized equations of motion , as described in  @xcite and then we will compare these results with the numerical solution of the equations of motion . at this regard , we stress that our numerical approach to the equations of motion is not completely self - consistent , since it is based on the assumption that the evolution can still be characterized along a single radial line of sight .",
    "therefore , our results should not be intended as predictions for observable spectral signatures associated with the maa effects .",
    "rather , we are mostly interested in understanding how the emergence of the maa instability is associated with the sn neutrino flux ordering .",
    "since in the following we are interested in characterizing the maa instability , we neglect the ordinary matter term , that could in principle suppress the mza  @xcite and the maa  @xcite self - induced flavor conversions at early times ( at @xmath10  s after the core bounce ) .",
    "we remind the reader that sn @xmath4 energy spectra present crossing points in the energy variable ( energies where @xmath0 , and @xmath1 ) and can develop instabilities around them .",
    "it is known that the impact of the mza effects on the flavor evolution crucially depends on the crossing pattern  @xcite .",
    "at this regard we find important to evaluate how the maa effects impact the sn @xmath4 fluxes for different crossing configurations .    in this context , during early post - bounce times ( especially during the accretion phase , at post - bounce times @xmath11  s ) one expects fluxes with a strong flavor hierarchy @xmath12 , defined in terms of the total neutrino number fluxes @xmath13 for the different flavors .",
    "these would practically correspond to neutrino spectra with a single crossing point at @xmath14 since @xmath15 for all the relevant energies ( and analogously for @xmath16 ) .",
    "for spectra with a single crossing and with an excess of @xmath2 over @xmath3 we find that the maa effect would lead to a new flavor instability in nh . with our numerical approach",
    "we find a splitting configuration in the oscillated @xmath4 fluxes rather close to what produced by the bimodal instability in inverted mass hierarchy ( ih , @xmath17 ) in the presence of only mza effects .    at later times , during the cooling phase ( at @xmath18  s ) , one instead expects a moderate flavor hierarchy @xmath19 , where a `` cross - over '' among nonelectron and electron species is possible .",
    "this case would correspond to neutrino spectra with multiple crossing points , i.e. with @xmath20 at lower energies , and @xmath21 at higher energies ( and analogously for @xmath16 ) .",
    "it has been shown in the axial symmetric case that the presence of mza effects would inhibit flavor conversions otherwise possible at low - radii in a single - zenith - angle ( sza ) scheme  @xcite .",
    "maa effects that in sza scheme would lead to a flavor instability , are also inhibited by the mza suppression .",
    "therefore , when flavor conversions start at large radii they do not have enough time to grow . as a result",
    "multiple spectral splits appear in both normal and inverted hierarchy as found in the axial symmetric case .",
    "these results are presented as the following . in sec .",
    "2 we introduce the neutrino equations of motion without imposing axial asymmetry in the neutrino - neutrino interaction term .",
    "then , we describe the setup to perform the stability analysis of the linearized equations of motion . in sec .",
    "3 we present different models for supernova neutrino fluxes with different crossing configurations . for these models",
    "we perform the stability analysis and we compare the results with the numerical flavor evolution . finally in sec .",
    "4 we summarize our results and we conclude .",
    "the characterization of the global solution for neutrino flavor evolution once the axial symmetry is broken by the maa effects , would in general require to take into account also variations along the transverse direction to the neutrino propagation one .",
    "this would make the solution of the equations of motion extremely challenging .",
    "however , _ before _ the spherical symmetry is broken , one can still characterize the flavor evolution along a given line of sight . in order to make the problem treatable also after the axial symmetry breaking , in our study we will use as _ working hypothesis _ that transverse variations remain small for all the flavor evolution .",
    "given this limitation , the results obtained with our simulations should not be intended to provide a benchmark to characterize detailed spectral features .",
    "rather , they would justify more advanced analysis to understand if the features found here are present also in more realistic descriptions . in our study",
    "we will focus mostly on the question of the emergence of an instability in the dense neutrino gas under maa effects , by finding the possible onset for the flavor conversions .",
    "this latter will be at first determined with the stability analysis and then compared with the approximate numerical solution .    under our simplified assumption",
    ", the flavor evolution depends only on @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath8 .",
    "following  @xcite , we write the equations of motion for the flux matrices @xmath24 as function of the radial coordinate .",
    "the diagonal @xmath24 elements represent the ordinary number fluxes integrated over a sphere of radius @xmath22 .",
    "we normalize the flux matrices to the @xmath25 number flux at the neutrino - sphere radius @xmath26 .",
    "the off - diagonal elements , which are initially zero , carry a phase information associated with flavor mixing .",
    "we use negative energy @xmath23 for anti - neutrinos .",
    "concerning the angular variables , we parameterize every zenith angular mode in terms of the variable @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the emission angle relative to the radial direction of the neutrinosphere  @xcite , while @xmath29 is the azimuth angle of the neutrino velocity @xmath30 . for simplicity , we neglect possible residual scatterings that could affect @xmath4 s after the neutrinosphere , producing a small `` neutrino halo '' that would broaden the @xmath4 angular distributions  @xcite .",

    "we work in a two - flavor scenario , where we take as mass - square difference the atmospheric one , @xmath34  ev@xmath35 .",
    "when needed , we assume a small ( matter suppressed ) in - medium mixing @xmath36 . the term at the second line represents the @xmath4-@xmath4 refractive effect , where @xmath37 . in the multi - angle kernel , the radial velocity of a mode with angular label @xmath38 is @xmath39  @xcite and the transverse velocity is @xmath40  @xcite .",
    "the term @xmath41 is the responsible for the breaking of the axial symmetry .    as in  @xcite , to solve numerically eq .",
    "( [ eq : eom1 ] ) we use an integration routine for stiff ordinary differential equations taken from the nag libraries  @xcite and based on an adaptive method .",

    "( [ eq : eom1])-([eq : eom2 ] ) ] , following the approach of  @xcite to which we address the interested reader for further details",
    ". we write the flux matrices in the form @xmath48 here , instead of energy , we use the frequency variable @xmath49 , and we introduce the neutrino flux difference distribution @xmath50 .",
    "this is the dimensionless spectrum representing @xmath51 at the neutrinosphere , normalized to the @xmath25 flux . in the following",
    "we will always assume axial symmetry of the neutrino emission .",
    "therefore @xmath52 .",
    "self - induced flavor transitions start when the off - diagonal term @xmath53 grows exponentially .",
    "one can write the solution of the linearized evolution equation ( see  @xcite ) in the form @xmath54 with complex frequency @xmath55 and eigenvector @xmath56 .",
    "a solution with @xmath57 would indicate an exponential increasing @xmath53 , i.e. an instability .",
    "then the solution can be recast in the form of an eigenvalue equation for @xmath56 , from which one gets a set of consistency conditions to be satisfied .",
    "these conditions can be expressed in terms of the following quantities @xmath58 where we introduced the _ resonant frequency _ @xmath59 in terms of the @xmath60 asymmetry parameter @xmath61 , where @xmath62 , and of the strength of the @xmath4-@xmath4 interaction @xmath63 in the case of axial - symmetric case , one arrives at two real equations  @xcite @xmath64 when these equations admit a solution , they determine the well - known _ bimodal _ instability . in the non - axial - symmetric",
    "another consistency condition arises , that leads to these two additional equations @xmath65 that characterize the new _ multi - azimuthal - angle _ instability .",
    "a flavor instability is present whenever eqs .",
    "( [ eq : jnkn])([eq : jnknmaa ] ) admit a solution @xmath66 .",
    "when an instability occurs , for a given angular mode @xmath67 the function @xmath68 is a lorentzian  @xcite , centered around @xmath69 , with a width @xmath70 .",
    "finally , we remind that the previous consistency equations are for the inverted mass hierarchy ( ih ) . in normal mass hierarchy ( nh )",
    "one should simply change the sign of @xmath71 in eqs .",

    "for the case @xmath72 ( upper panel ) and @xmath73 ( lower panel).,scaledwidth=40.0% ]      in order to study the maa effects of sn neutrino flavor conversions , we fix our benchmark models for the initial sn neutrino fluxes at the neutrinosphere .",
    "we factorize the @xmath4 flux of each flavor as @xmath74 the @xmath4 number @xmath75 is expressed in terms of the @xmath4 luminosity @xmath76 and of the @xmath4 average energy @xmath77 of the different species .",
    "the function @xmath78 is the normalized @xmath4 energy spectrum ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "we parametrize the energy spectrum as in  ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath80\\ , ,   \\label{eq : varphi}\\ ] ] where we fix the spectral parameter to @xmath81 for all species .",
    "we fix the neutrino average energies at @xmath82 concerning the possible @xmath4 flux ordering we consider two cases , widely used as benchmark models in the previous literature  @xcite .",
    "as representative of the accretion phase ( labelled as case @xmath83 ) , we take @xmath84 corresponding to an asymmetry paramter @xmath85 . in this case , we choose as neutrino luminosities ( in units of @xmath86 erg / s ) @xmath87 instead , as representative of the cooling phase , dubbed case @xmath88 , we choose @xmath89 giving @xmath90 . in this case we take as neutrino luminosities ( in units of @xmath86 erg / s ) @xmath91    in figure  1 we show the function @xmath92 for the case @xmath83 ( upper panel ) and for the case @xmath88 ( lower panel ) .",
    "note that here and in the following we will assume half - isotropic @xmath4 angular distributions ( i.e. with all outward - moving angular modes equally occupied and all the backward - moving modes empty ) .",
    "both spectra present three crossing points , where @xmath93 , so naively one would expect similar instability conditions in these two cases",
    ". however , as we will see in the following , the instabilities in these two cases are significantly different .      the @xmath94 function for the case @xmath83 ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] upper panel ) , presents three crossing points in the @xmath95 variable .",
    "according to what explained in  @xcite and confirmed by the stability analysis in  @xcite in the axial symmetric case , the bimodal instability is associated to crossings with positive slope in ih and to crossings with negative slope in nh . however , as discussed in  @xcite and observed in many numerical simulations , a narrowly spaced triple crossing can superficially act like a single one at @xmath96 .",
    "therefore , the bimodal instability would occur in ih and produce no effect in nh . if one breaks the axial symmetry , allowing for maa effects , in the stability analysis of  @xcite and from the numerical simulations of  @xcite one finds that the positive crossings would be unstable in nh and the negative ones in ih .",
    "therefore , due to the narrowness of the three crossings in the @xmath94 , we expect that maa effect would produce an instability in nh and no new effect in ih . in fig .",
    "2 we show the radial evolution of the @xmath70 function for @xmath4 fluxes of the case @xmath83 , obtained solving eqs .",
    "( [ eq : jnkn])([eq : jnknmaa ] ) . left panel refers to the nh , while right panel to the ih one .",
    "we consider both mza case ( continuous curves ) with half - isotropic angular distributions , and single - zenith - angle ( sza ) case ( dashed curves ) , where we took @xmath97 with @xmath98 .",
    "we realize that both the configurations are unstable .",
    "as explained before , the instability in nh is associated with maa effects [ eqs .",
    "( [ eq : jnknmaa ] ) ] .",
    "we find that in the sza case the peak of @xmath99 is reached at @xmath100  km . in the mza case",
    "this is slightly suppressed at @xmath101 .",
    "the curves of @xmath70 in ih , associated with the bimodal instability [ eq .",
    "( [ eq : jnkn ] ) ] are rather similar to what discussed for the nh . at this regard ,",
    "the symmetry between the maa instability in nh and the bimodal one in ih has been discussed in  @xcite .            in the upper panels of figure  3",
    "we represent the radial evolution of the @xmath102-component @xmath103 of the @xmath16 polarization vector @xmath104 integrated over @xmath95 , @xmath29 and @xmath38 for neutrino fluxes in the @xmath83 case .",
    "as known , this quantity is related to the flavor content of the @xmath4 ensemble . left panel",
    "refer to nh and right panel to ih .",
    "we compare single - zenith - angle ( sza ) evolution ( dashed curves ) with @xmath98 , with the complete mza and maa cases ( continuous curves ) . in ih",
    "we observe the usual flavor evolution , found in the axial symmetric case .",
    "in particular , we have synchronized oscillations  @xcite till @xmath100  km , where all the polarization vectors of the different modes stay pinned to their original values .",
    "the onset of the flavor conversions is in agreement with what found with the stability analysis .",
    "significant flavor conversions start only after synchronization when pendular oscillations  @xcite , triggered by the bimodal instability  @xcite , start to swap the flavor content of the system . in particular , @xmath103 is completely swapped at the end of the flavor evolution .",
    "maa and mza effects do not play a significant role , since one observes a `` quasi - single angle '' behavior  @xcite , driven by the only bimodal instability .",
    "the nh case , that would have been stable in the axial symmetric case , now presents relevant flavor conversions at @xmath105  km , analogous to what recently found for the simple spectra considered in  @xcite .",
    "again we find an agreement between the onset of the flavor conversions found numerically and what predicted with the stability analysis . in this case",
    ", the inversion of @xmath103 is not complete and there is also a slight difference between the sza and mza case .    in order to track the growth of the maa instability , in the lower panels of figure  3 we plot the dipole term in @xmath106 of the transverse components of the antineutrino integrated polarization vector  @xcite @xmath107 \\cos \\varphi \\right\\}^{1/2}\\,\\ .\\ ] ] from the figure one realize that while in ih case , this function is always null , confirming that no azimuthal dependence in the polarization vectors in generated , in nh @xmath108 exponentially grows reaching the peak at @xmath105  km where flavor conversions are triggered by the maa effects .",
    "the rise of @xmath108 in sza ( dashed curve ) and mza ( continuous curve ) case is rather similar .            for completeness , we find interesting to show how the maa induced flavor conversions affect the sn neutrino fluxes in our simplified numerical scheme .",
    "as already noticed , the @xmath94 function for the case @xmath83 looks as a spectrum with a single crossing at @xmath96 .",
    "therefore , the bimodal instability would produce a broad swap around @xmath109 in ih , while the maa instability would produce the swap in nh .",
    "our results are shown in figure  4 . in the upper panels we show the initial @xmath110 ( light continuous curves ) , the final one for the maa flavor evolution in the sza case ( dashed curve ) and the final one in the mza case ( thick continuous curves ) . in the lower panels we represent the swap function @xmath111 given by the ratio of the final with respect to the initial @xmath110 for the sza case ( dashed curves ) and the mza case ( thick continuous curves ) . left panels refer to the nh case , while right panels to ih .",
    "we remark that the final spectra in nh and ih are rather close . as expected , the maa instability in nh produces a split at @xmath112  km@xmath113 , while in ih the split induced by the bimodal instability is at @xmath114  km@xmath113 . in the sza case",
    "another split would appear in the @xmath16 at @xmath115  km@xmath113 in nh , and at @xmath116  km@xmath113 in ih .",
    "as noticed in  @xcite , both these @xmath16 splits are smeared by mza effects . the presence of spectral splits and swaps lead by the maa instability in the case @xmath83 is consistent with what presented in  @xcite , where an ordered behavior in the final @xmath4 spectra under maa effects was found for large flavor asymmetries ( @xmath117 ) .",
    "moreover , the symmetry between the effects of the bimodal instability in ih and the maa one in nh has been recently pointed out with a simple toy - model in  @xcite .",
    "finally , in figure  5 we show the intial ( dashed curves ) and final fluxes ( continuous curves ) for @xmath118 ( black curves ) and @xmath119 ( light curves ) flavors , for neutrinos ( left panels ) and antineutrinos ( right panels ) .",
    "we consider both mza and maa effects .",
    "upper panels show the nh while lower panels refer to ih .",
    "we realize that the final spectra are remarkably similar in both the hierarchies .",
    "in particular , neutrino spectra present a split at @xmath120  mev .",
    "the split is sharper in ih where it is driven by the bimodal instability .",
    "the @xmath16 spectra are swapped with respect to the initial ones . in particular , as expected from the swap function of figure  3 , the swap is more complete in ih , where deviations from a complete swap are confined to low energies ( @xmath121  mev ) .",
    "the @xmath94 spectrum for the case @xmath88 ( fig .  1 lower panel ) has been widely studied in the axial symmetric case as representative of energy spectra with a flux ordering @xmath122 and energy spectra with multiple crossing points leading to multiple splits around these points ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "remarkably , with spectra of type @xmath88 one expects both the hierarchies to be unstable under maa and bimodal effects , since spectra present both positive ( unstable in nh for maa effects and in ih for the bimodal ones ) and negative ( unstable in ih for maa effects and in nh per the bimodal ones ) crossings . in figure  6",
    "we show the radial evolution of the function @xmath70 , obtained solving eqs .",
    "( [ eq : jnkn])([eq : jnknmaa ] ) . left panels refer to nh , while right ones to ih . differently from the case",
    "@xmath83 , these two equations will have simultaneous solutions in both the hierarchies .",
    "therefore , in the upper panels we show the solutions of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : jnkn ] ) [ bimodal instability ] , while in lower panels refer to eqs .",
    "( [ eq : jnknmaa ] ) [ maa instability ] . as in fig .  3",
    ", continuous curves refer to mza , while dashed ones are for sza .",
    "we remark that eqs .",
    "( [ eq : jnkn ] ) have a couple of solution @xmath66 corresponding to positive and negative @xmath123 respectively ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "however , in the following we will show only the case with the larger @xmath70 .",
    "starting from the nh case , we see that in the sza situation both bimodal and maa effects produce a sharp rise in @xmath70 around @xmath124  km .",
    "therefore , low - radii conversions would be possible in these cases .",
    "since both the instabilities are comparable ( peak value of @xmath125 ) , one expects that both would equally contribute to the further flavor evolution .",
    "passing now to the mza case , as expected from  @xcite , the instabilities are strongly suppressed with respect to the previous cases . moreover ,",
    "the peaks are shifted at larger @xmath22 . in particular , for the bimodal instability the peak is at @xmath126  km with a value @xmath127 , while the maa instability has the peak at @xmath128  km with a value @xmath129 .",
    "the strong suppression of the maa instability seems to suggest that this one would play a sub - leading role in the flavor evolution in the mza situation . passing to the ih",
    ", we observe a similar trend .",
    "namely , in sza both the bimodal and maa instabilities lead to comparable effects . in the sza case",
    ", the bimodal instability has a peak @xmath127 at @xmath126  km , while the maa one is smeared and more suppressed with a peak @xmath130 at @xmath131  km .    in figure  7 we represent the radial evolution of the integrated vectors @xmath103 and @xmath132 in the same format of fig .",
    "as expected from the stability analysis , we see that in this case the flavor evolution in sza and mza case is remarkably different . in particular ,",
    "in the sza case we see that differently from the case @xmath83 , flavor conversions are possible at low radii ( @xmath133  km ) in a region where we would have expected synchronization , in agreement with the results of the stability analysis .",
    "this effect has been discussed in literature : in the presence of multiple crossing points it is possible the flip of parts of the original neutrino spectra around the crossing points  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the synchronization behavior found for single - crossed spectra is not necessarily stable in this case .",
    "indeed , in  @xcite it has been discussed the possibility of a novel form of flavor conversions for large @xmath134 in terms of a self - induced parametric resonance that would destabilize the synchronization . in this case also the maa instability can grow at relatively low - radius in both the mass hierarchies . from the plot of @xmath132 ,",
    "one see that the peak is reached at @xmath135  km in both nh and ih",
    ".    passing to the mza case of fig .  7 , we find that now the low - radii flavor conversions are suppressed , as predicted from the stability analysis .",
    "this effect has been described in  @xcite , where it was pointed the connection between this behavior and the mza suppression of the parametric resonance . indeed , as understood from previous literature  @xcite",
    ", mza effects introduce a large dispersion in the neutrino - neutrino potential , that prevents any possible collective flavor conversion at low radii .",
    "the mza suppression implies that flavor conversions in this case do start only at @xmath136  km .",
    "remarkably , also maa effects are suppressed at low - radii and when flavor conversions start they do not have enough time to grow .",
    "indeed , we have seen with the stability analysis that the maa instability is more suppressed with respect to the bimodal one .",
    "indeed @xmath132 remains identically null . in conclusion in this case ,",
    "the flavor evolution is governed by the only bimodal and mza instabilities .            the evolution of the @xmath94 is shown in fig .  8 with the same format of fig .",
    "we realize that in the sza case the maa effects would produce flavor decoherence with a swap function @xmath111 tending to zero .",
    "this is consistent with what found in  @xcite for the case of small flavor asymmetry .",
    "conversely in the mza case , since maa effects are suppressed one recovers the splitting configurations already found in the axial symmetric case  @xcite .",
    "the oscillated spectra for @xmath118 and @xmath119 flavor are shown in fig .",
    "these are very similar to what shown in  @xcite to which we address the reader for a detailed discussion . here",
    "we only remark that mza effects produce a smearing of the splitting features with respect to what found in the sza case .",
    "it has been recently pointed out that removing the axial symmetry in the sn self - induced neutrino flavor evolution , maa effects can trigger new flavor conversions . in this paper",
    "we have investigated the dependence of the maa effects on the initial supernova neutrino fluxes .",
    "we performed a stability analysis of the linearized equations of motion to classify the cases unstable under the maa effects .",
    "then , we looked for a local solution along a given line of sight , working under the assumption that the transverse variations of global solution are small .",
    "if one considers neutrino fluxes typical of the accretion phase , with a pronounced @xmath2 excess , _ de facto _ behaving like spectra with a single crossing , the maa effects produce an instability in nh . in our simplified scheme for the flavor evolution",
    ", this seems to produce spectral swaps and splits very similar to what produced by the bimodal instability in ih , as expected from the recent analysis of  @xcite .",
    "another interesting spectral class is the one with neutrino fluxes having a moderate flavor hierarchy and a @xmath5 excess , as possible during the supernova cooling phase . in this situation",
    ", the presence of multiple crossing points in the original neutrino spectra destabilizes the synchronization at large neutrino densities  @xcite . in absence of synchronization , in the sza scheme collective conversions",
    "would be possible at low - radii . in this case",
    "maa effects would produce flavor decoherence in both the hierarchies . however , mza effects suppress these low - radii conversions .",
    "we find that also maa effects are suppressed and one recovers the same splitting features expected in the axial symmetric case .    from our analysis",
    "it seems the maa effects play a crucial role only for spectra with a large flavor asymmetry .",
    "these would be natural during the accretion phase .",
    "however , it is known that during this phase the dense ordinary matter can be large enough to potentially inhibit the self - induced effects  @xcite .",
    "in a recent work , this aspect has been investigated performing the stability analysis with a realistic sn matter profiles .",
    "it has been found that during the accretion phase the large matter term would suppress the maa instability  @xcite .",
    "this result is of crucial importance given the relevance of the supernova neutrino signal during the accretion phase to calibrate the sn models  @xcite and hopefully to extract the neutrino mass hierarchy  @xcite .",
    "an interesting case where the maa instability could play an important role is represented by the prompt @xmath2 deleptonization burst in low - mass o - ne - mg sne . in this situation",
    "the matter density profile can be so steep that the usual mikheev - smirnov - wolfenstein ( msw ) matter effects  @xcite occur within the dense - neutrino region close to the neutrino sphere , preparing the conditions for the self - induced spectral splits  @xcite",
    ". it would be interesting to see how the current picture is modified removing the axial symmetry .",
    "as we already mentioned , an open problem in the characterization of the maa instability is that when the axial symmetry is broken , the global solution of the neutrino equations of motion can not be spherically symmetric .",
    "presumably the axial symmetry breaking is different in different overall directions . as a result",
    ", there would be some finite `` transverse cell '' size with a common dipole of the azimuthal distribution .",
    "if flavor conversions start relatively far from the neutrinosphere , neutrinos move mostly outward .",
    "therefore , one would expect that they do not communicate in the transverse direction , except from a bit of overlap among neighboring cells at some larger radius , depending on the angular divergence of the neutrino radiation",
    ". how large might be different transverse cells is still an open issue .",
    "it would probably depend on the initial seeds , due to non - spherical neutrino emission at the neutrinosphere .",
    "these may not vary fast as a function of direction because it averages over many emission patches at the neutron star surface .",
    "therefore , as a function of observer direction , the global solution presumably does not change fast . under this assumption",
    "the local solution along a given line of sight could give an idea of what happens in the realistic situation .",
    "it is mandatory to test if this working assumption is correct , and if spectral features found in our simplified scheme are present also in the asymmetric global solution .",
    "this task would be necessary in order to work out possible observable signatures of the maa instability .",
    "getting the global solution would require to consider also variations along the transverse direction .",
    "this would imply passing from an ordinary to a partial differential equation problem , adding a big layer of complication in the solution of the equations of motion .    in conclusions ,",
    "different gaps have still to be filled in order to achieve a better description of the self - induced neutrino flavor conversions in sne and on the role of the multi - azimuthal - angle instability .",
    "this effort is well motivated by the perspective of getting a reliable characterization of the sn neutrino spectral features that would be observable in large underground detectors  @xcite .",
