    "there has been a great deal of recent interest in the electronic properties of two dimensional ( 2d ) graphene , a single - layer graphite sheet , both theoretically and experimentally @xcite .",
    "the main difference of 2d graphene compared with other ( mostly semiconductor - based ) 2d materials is the electronic energy dispersion . in conventional 2d systems ,",
    "the electron energy with an effective mass @xmath7 depends quadratically on the momentum , but in graphene , the dispersions of electron and hole bands are linear near k , k points of the brillouin zone . because of the different energy band dispersion , screening properties in graphene exhibit significantly different behavior from the conventional 2d systems @xcite .",
    "the screening of coulomb interaction induced by many body effects is one of the most important fundamental quantities for understanding many physical properties .",
    "for example , dynamical screening determines the elementary excitation spectra and the collective modes of the electron system , and static screening determines transport properties through screened coulomb carrier scattering by charged impurities . in this paper , we theoretically obtain the ( dynamical and static ) screening behavior of 2d graphene by calculating , for the first time , the polarizability and the dielectric function within the self - consistent field approximation ( i.e. random - phase - approximation ( rpa ) ) for gated-2d graphene free carrier systems .",
    "we apply our theory to calculate the 2d graphene plasmon dispersion and the static screening function , finding some interesting qualitative differences between graphene and the extensively studied 2d electron systems based on semiconductor heterostructures and mosfets .    in this paper , we calculate the dielectric function of graphene at arbitrary wave vector @xmath0 and frequency @xmath1 , @xmath2 , within rpa , in which each electron is assumed to move in the self - consistent field arising from the external field plus the induced field of all electrons .",
    "this is the model which leads to the famous lindhard dielectric function for a three - dimensional ( 3d ) @xcite and 2d @xcite electron gas .",
    "one of the immediate theoretical consequences of the dielectric function is that its zeros give the wave vector dependent plasmon mode , @xmath8 , which is a fundamental elementary excitation and a collective density oscillation mode . using the theoretical dielectric function we provide the plasmon mode dispersion both for single - layer and bilayer graphene .",
    "another important consequence of the dielectric function is the static screening function which can be obtained as the static limit @xmath9 of the dielectric function , describing the electrostatic screening of the electron - electron , electron - lattice , and electron - impurity interactions .",
    "the electron dynamics in 2d graphene is modeled by a chiral dirac equation , which describes a linear relation between energy and momentum .",
    "the corresponding kinetic energy of graphene for 2d wave vector * k * is given by ( we use @xmath12 throughout this paper ) @xmath13 where @xmath14 indicate the conduction ( + 1 ) and valence ( @xmath15 ) bands , respectively , and @xmath16 is a band parameter ( essentially the 2d fermi velocity , which is a constant for graphene instead of being density dependent ) .",
    "the corresponding density of states ( dos ) is given by @xmath17 , where @xmath18 , @xmath19 are the spin and valley degeneracies , respectively . the fermi momentum ( @xmath20 ) and the fermi energy ( @xmath21 ) of 2d graphene are given by @xmath22 and @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the 2d carrier ( electron or hole ) density . for the sake of completeness , we also mention that the dimensionless wigner - seitz radius ( @xmath25 ) , which measures the ratio of the potential to the kinetic energy in an interacting quantum coulomb system @xcite , is given in doped 2d graphene by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the background lattice dielectric constant of the system .",
    "we note in the passing the curious fact that the dimensionless @xmath25 parameter is a _ constant _ in graphene unlike in the usual 2d ( @xmath28 ) and 3d ( @xmath29 ) electron liquids , where @xmath25 ( and therefore interaction effects ) increases with decreasing carrier density .",
    "the constancy of @xmath25 in graphene arises trivially from the relativistic dirac - like nature of the free carrier graphene dynamics implying that the ` relativistic ' effective mass , @xmath30 , depends on carrier density precisely as @xmath31 cancelling out the corresponding @xmath31 term in the potential energy .",
    "equivalently , @xmath25 here is just the `` effective fine structure constant '' for graphene , with a value of @xmath32 assuming @xmath33 and @xmath34 ( using sio@xmath35 as the substrate material ) .",
    "this small ( and constant ) value of graphene @xmath25 indicates it to be a weakly interacting system for all carrier densities , making rpa an excellent approximation in graphene since rpa is asymptotically exact in the @xmath36 limit .    in the rpa , the dynamical screening function ( dielectric function ) becomes @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the 2d coulomb interaction , and @xmath39 , the 2d polarizability , is given by the bare bubble diagram @xmath40 where @xmath41 , @xmath42 denote the band indices and @xmath43 is the overlap of states and given by @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the angle between @xmath46 and @xmath47 , and @xmath48 is the fermi distribution function , @xmath49^{-1}$ ] , with @xmath50 and @xmath51 the chemical potential . after performing the summation over @xmath52",

    "2d @xcite the non - local correction leads to an increase in plasma frequency , [ @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is the usual 2d thomas - fermi wave vector ) , but in graphene the correction within rpa leads to a decrease in plasma frequency compared with @xmath87 [ @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is the corresponding graphene thomas - fermi wave vector .",
    "recently , the plasmon mode of graphene has been considered numerically in the presence of spin - orbit coupling @xcite .    for bilayer graphene , _ without inter - layer hopping _ , we have the leading order @xmath0 dependence of the collective modes by solving a two component determinantal equation @xcite @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the layer separation between the two 2d graphene sheets .",

    "only indirect ( @xmath104 ) transition is possible within the band , and the spe boundaries are given by @xmath105 .",

    "the transition is not allowed at @xmath112 .",
    "if the collective mode lies inside the spe continuum we expect the mode to be damped .",
    "since the normal 2d plasmon lies , at long wave lengths , above the spe continuum it never decays to electron - hole pair within rpa .",

    "[ s_pol ] we show the calculated static polarizability as a function of wave vector . for a normal 2d system the screening wave vector , @xmath120 , is independent of electron concentration , but for 2d graphene the screening wave vector is given by @xmath121 which is proportional to the square root of the density , @xmath122 . in the large momentum transfer regime , @xmath123 , the static screening increases linearly with @xmath0 due to the interband transition .",
    "this is a very different behavior from a normal 2d system where the static polarizability falls off rapidly for @xmath124 with a cusp at @xmath125 @xcite .",
    "the linear increase of the static polarizability with @xmath0 gives rise to an enhancement of the effective dielectric constant @xmath126 in graphene .",
    "note that in a normal 2d system @xmath127 as @xmath128 .",
    "thus , the effective interaction in 2d graphene decreases at short wave lengths due to polarization effects .",
    "this large wave vector screening behavior is typical of an insulator .",
    "thus , 2d graphene screening is a combination of `` metallic '' screening ( due to @xmath129 ) and `` insulating '' screening ( due to @xmath11 ) , leading to overall rather strange screening properties , all of which can be traced back to the zero - gap chiral relativistic nature of graphene .    in",
    "may be worthwhile to ask whether the _ intrinsic _ graphene contribution , arising strictly from the interband transitions due to the filled valence band ( i.e. the @xmath11 term in our graphene polarizability ) , can be absorbed in the effective background lattice dielectric constant @xmath27 just as one does in a regular semiconductor ( @xmath130 ; @xmath131 ) or insulator ( @xmath132 ) in discussing free carrier screening by doping or gating indeed free carriers in conduction ( electrons ) or valence ( holes ) bands .",
    "in particular , only _ intraband _ free carrier screening is explicitly considered in the usual 2d screening function @xcite extensively used @xcite in the quantitative analysis of quantum transport in 2d semiconductor devices such as si mosfets , gaas modulation - doped high - mobility transistors ( hemts ) , and undoped gated gaas heterostructures ( higfets ) .",
    "the interband transition induced screening in the semiconductor based 2d structures is included in the theory simply by appropriately modifying the effective background lattice dielectric constant from the usual vacuum value of unity to a value around ten .    to see whether the effect of the interband @xmath11 polarizability can be ` trivially ' absorbed in a background lattice dielectric constant we rewrite a 2d graphene dielectric function @xmath133 to obtain : @xmath134.\\ ] ] using eq .",

    "( [ epsstar ] ) shows that the intrinsic screening contribution arising from the interband @xmath11 term can be completely subsumed by introducing an effective graphene background lattice dielectric constant @xmath143 , and by making the replacement @xmath144 throughout .",
    "introducing the effective dielectric constant @xmath145 allows one to use only the free carrier screening function @xmath146 for describing free carrier screening properties of 2d graphene .",
    "we note that @xmath27 itself here is the background lattice dielectric constant arising from the insulating substrate ( i.e. sio@xmath35 in most situations ) with @xmath147 , and @xmath148 with @xmath149 for graphene on sio@xmath35 substrate .",
    "thus , the substitution @xmath144 arising from the interband contributions enhances the effective background graphene dielectric constant to @xmath150  this approximate factor of 2 increase in the background dielectric constant arising from interband contributions further suppress coulomb interaction effects in extrinsic graphene .",
    "the large @xmath0 behavior of graphene dielectric screening , @xmath151 , again demonstrates that the short - wavelength screened coulomb potential in 2d graphene goes as @xmath152 , with an enhanced background effective dielectric constant @xmath153 where @xmath27 is the effective background dielectric constant arising from the substrate and @xmath145 arising from graphene interband polarizability @xmath11 as discussed above .",
    "this implies that a suspended 2d graphene film , without any substrate ( i.e. @xmath154 ) , would have an effective background lattice dielectric constant of @xmath155 with @xmath156 ( since @xmath154 ) . putting in @xmath157 ,",
    "we get @xmath158 .",
    "thus the background static lattice dielectric constant of intrinsic graphene , due to interband transitions , is around 4 .",
    "if the @xmath159 transport properties of graphene are dominated by charged impurity scattering as is thought to be the case @xcite then the long - wavelength thomas - fermi screening becomes an important input for calculating the screened charged impurity potential : @xmath160 becomes @xmath161 where @xmath162 .",
    "note that one can equivalently define a long wavelength effective tf screening function @xmath163 where interband",
    "screening effects are absorbed in an effective background dielectric constant @xmath145 ; @xmath164 where @xmath165 .",
    "as discussed above , the identity , @xmath166 , guarantees the equivalence between eqs .",
    "( [ tf1 ] ) and ( [ tf2 ] ) for long wavelength graphene screening .",
    "we note also that the @xmath111 screening wavevector @xmath167 is simply proportional to the graphene density of states at the fermi level at @xmath159 .",
    "although the two screening descriptions , based on @xmath168 with the background dielectric constant being just @xmath27 and on @xmath169 with the background dielectric constant being @xmath170 , are precisely equivalent for @xmath159 static screening properties , the two descriptions are _ not _ inequivalent at finite temperatures . therefore , it is more appropriate to use the full dielectric function @xmath168 in theoretical work on 2d graphene .",
    "in conclusion , we have theoretically obtained analytic expressions for doped ( i.e. @xmath62 ) 2d extrinsic graphene polarizability , dielectric function , plasmon dispersion , and static screening properties , finding a number of intriguing qualitative differences with the corresponding normal ( and extensively studied ) 2d electron systems .",
    "the differences , with interesting observable consequences , can all be understood as arising from the zero - band gap intrinsic nature of undoped graphene with chiral linear relativistic bare carrier energy band dispersion .",
    "some of our qualitatively new predictions , such as the @xmath171 dependence of the long - wave length graphene plasma frequency in contrast to the well - known @xmath122 behavior of classical and normal 2d plasmons , should be easily verifiable experimentally using the standard experimental techniques of infra - red absorption @xcite and/or inelastic light scattering @xcite spectroscopies .",
    "similarly , our prediction of the peculiar nature of the graphene plasmon damping ( i.e. _ no _ landau damping due to intraband electron - hole pairs , but finite landau damping due to interband electron - hole pairs ) should be easily verifiable .",
    "our predicted different screening behavior in graphene at large wave vector should have consequences for transport properties .",
    "our rpa theory should be an excellent qualitative approximation for 2d graphene properties at all carrier densities ( as long as the system remains a _ homogeneous _ 2d carrier system , which may not be true for @xmath172 ) since the effective @xmath25-parameter for graphene is a constant ( @xmath173 ) , making rpa quantitatively accurate in graphene . finally , we point out that the effective fermi temperature , @xmath174 , being very high ( @xmath175 for @xmath176 @xmath100 ) in graphene , our @xmath159 theory should apply all the way to room temperatures .",
    "we note that the long wavelength dielectric function for bulk graphite was earlier considered within an approximation scheme in ref . , and the zero frequency limit was recently considered in ref . .",
    "before concluding , we point out that some aspects of graphene collective modes and linear response have been discussed in the recent literature",
    ". in particular , the intrinsic situation without any free carriers has been considered in @xcite whereas our emphasis in this work has been _ extrinsic _ graphene with free carriers ( electrons / holes in conduction / valence band ) induced by external gating or doping .",
    "there has been a recent purely numerical study @xcite of graphene collective mode spectra in the presence of spin - orbit coupling ."
