    "low - dimensional systems have been studied intensively during the last decades .",
    "some systems have been found to possess unusual properties which turn out to be important for their practical applications in microelectronics and nanotechnologies .",
    "conducting polymers , quasi - one - dimensional organic and inorganic compounds are good examples of such systems @xcite .",
    "recently , nanotubes have become the subject of many intensive experimental and theoretical studies .",
    "in particular , carbon @xcite and boron nitride @xcite nanotubes have been shown to be useful for miniaturised electronic , mechanical , electromechanical and optoelectronic devices .",
    "some of the intriguing physical properties of such systems are due to the electron - phonon interactions which are particularly important in low - dimensional systems .",
    "although low - dimensional systems have been studied mainly within simplified single - chain ( single - band ) models resulting in the theoretical predictions of many striking phenomena @xcite , many of them , such as peierls transitions , formation of charge density waves , soliton states , etc have been verified experimentally in real substances . however , taking into account the more realistic complex structure of these substances is quite important for the proper description of their properties and can result in qualitatively new features .",
    "this is particularly true in the case of nanotubes who possess series of energy bands which are determined by one - dimensional ( 1d ) energy dispersion relations on the wave vector @xmath0 along the axis of the nanotube .",
    "it is well known that sufficiently long single wall carbon nanotubes ( swnt ) , in which half of the energy band states are occupied , possess properties of 1d - metals or semiconductors depending on their diameter and chirality @xcite .",
    "in fact , their properties can be modified in a controllable way by varying either the nanotube diameter and chirality or by doping nanotubes with some impurity atoms , molecules or compounds @xcite .    in 1d systems",
    "the electron - phonon interactions can lead to the formation of stable self - trapped states with spontaneous symmetry - breaking distortions @xcite .",
    "such soliton states are realized in quasi-1d organic and inorganic materials and can successfully describe various properties of conjugated polymers in the framework of the su - schrieffer - heeger model @xcite . the possibility for",
    "the formation of states with a spontaneously broken symmetry in carbon nanotubes has been discussed in @xcite . in particular , large polarons ( or solitons ) in nanotubes have recently been considered in @xcite . in these models",
    "the long - wave approximation has been used for the states close to the fermi - level , which is equivalent to the continuum approximation . in this way ,",
    "however , the essential details of the crystallographic structure of the system are not taken into account .    here",
    "we study numerically the formation and properties of polaron states in zigzag nanotubes using the semi - empirical tight - binding model in which we consider only the nearest - neighbour hopping interactions @xcite .",
    "the merit of this method is its simplicity , in spite of which it often gives a quantitative agreement with the experimental results .",
    "this has been demonstrated in @xcite for conjugated polymers and for carbon nanotubes in @xcite .",
    "moreover , we consider only the ground state of a single electron in a hexagonal nanotube .",
    "such systems are already quite complicated and though such states in 1d chains have been studied intensively both analytically and numerically , little is known about them in the case of nanotubes .",
    "we consider a model in which a two - dimensional sheet of hexagonally bound equivalent atoms ( graphene - like sheet ) is rolled - up into a zigzag nanotube .",
    "calling @xmath1 the length of each side of the hexagons , @xmath2 the radius of the nanotube , @xmath3 the number of hexagonal cells wrapped around the nanotube , we define ( cfr .",
    "fig 1 ) @xmath4    ( 8,8 )    the site labelling that we use is shown in fig.1 and coincides with the conventional one @xcite . here",
    "@xmath5 is an axial index , @xmath6 is the index labelling the sites around the nanotube , and @xmath7 labels the two types of atoms ( usually called a and b ) : those who have a nearest neighbour one site down ( @xmath8 ) and those who have a nearest neighbour one site ` up ' ( @xmath9 ) - see fig.1 .",
    "then the position of any nanotube lattice site , at its equilibrium , can be described by : @xmath10    in fig .",
    "2 we present a drawing of the horizontal cross - section of the nanotube .",
    "note that the parameters @xmath2 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are connected by @xmath13    ( 8,8 )    next we define @xmath14 as the displacement vector of the atoms from their equilibrium positions where @xmath15 is tangent to the surface of the undeformed nanotube and perpendicular to the nanotube axis , @xmath16 is tangent to this surface and parallel to the nanotube axis , and @xmath17 is normal to the surface of the nanotube .",
    "then , using cartesian coordinates , we have @xmath18 where @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the corresponding amplitudes of displacements .",
    "so the positions of the lattice sites are given by @xmath22    we also define the following lattice vectors connecting the atom @xmath23 with its three nearest neighbours @xmath24 with @xmath25 for right ( @xmath26 ) , left ( @xmath27 ) and down or up ( @xmath1 ) neighbours : @xmath28 when @xmath29 we add the upper index @xmath30 to all quantities to indicate their values at the equilibrium position .",
    "hence @xmath31 with @xmath32 .",
    "note that @xmath33 , the distance between lattice sites is approximately given by : @xmath34 where @xmath35 are the changes of distances between nearest neighbours due to the displacements of the sites .",
    "as is well known , the central forces between neighbouring sites do not provide lattice stability .",
    "therefore , we introduce additional terms . first , assuming that the force between two atoms is not purely central , in addition to @xmath36 which are invariant under translations , we introduce also the quantities @xmath37 which describe relative shifts of neighbouring atoms in a graphene sheet and which will be needed to remove the non - physical zero modes of the phonon hamiltonian .",
    "the explicit expressions for these quantities are : @xmath38    next , as in @xcite , we introduce also the force of bond - bending between the atoms induced by the deviation of the valence angles from their equilibrium values .",
    "for this we compute the solid angle spanned by the 3 lattice vectors located at a given site .",
    "clearly , this angle is given by @xmath39 for small displacements we have @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42    taking into account the harmonic potential terms responsible for the central _ i.e _ @xmath43 , non - central , @xmath44 , and the bond - bending , @xmath45 forces , and using the approximation of the nearest - neighbour interaction , we define the phonon hamiltonian as : @xmath46\\bigr ) .",
    "\\label{phon - ham}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the momenta , canonically conjugate , respectively , to the displacements @xmath49 and @xmath21 .",
    "@xmath50 is the atom mass , @xmath0 is the elasticity constant that characterises the central force , and @xmath51 is a characteristic constant of the bond - bending force .",
    "next we assume that each atom in the hexagonal lattice has a well isolated non - degenerate electron level @xmath52 ( @xmath53-orbital in the case of a carbon nanotube ) and we take into account the hopping interaction , @xmath54 , of each atom only with its three nearest neighbours .",
    "the electron - phonon interaction has different sources @xcite .",
    "often , the phonon modulation of the hopping interaction is invoked which , in the linear approximation with respect to the displacements , gives @xmath55 thus leading to the electron phonon interaction proportional to @xmath56 .    in general , as has been shown in @xcite , in addition to the conventional modulation of the hopping interaction one should also take into account the interaction between electrons and ions through the coulomb potential which is modulated by the lattice vibrations .",
    "the fields of neighbouring atoms then alter the local electron energy , @xmath57 , and so , in the same linear approximation , we can write @xmath58 where @xmath59 characterises the influence of the distance and @xmath60 the influence of the bond - bending deviations .    the constants @xmath56 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 determine the strength of the electron - phonon coupling",
    ". their calculation would be the subject of microscopic considerations .",
    "the estimate of @xmath56 for carbon nanotubes was obtained in @xcite .",
    "the coupling , through the coulomb potential , provides an input into all these constants .",
    "moreover , the curvature of the lattice is an important factor : the curvature - induced charge polarisation , present in carbon nanotubes , results in the vibration modulated dipole component of the coulomb potential . as it was indicated in @xcite , where this fact had been taken into account through the lydann - sachs - teller relation , such an electron - phonon interaction is stronger that the one due to the deformational potential . in this paper",
    "we treat the constants @xmath56 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 as parameters and we investigate the ground self - trapped state of an electron depending on the value of these parameters .",
    "the strength of the electron - phonon interaction plays a key role in many effects .",
    "when the coupling constant of this interaction is strong enough it can lead to the self - trapping of a quasiparticle . by ` quasiparticle ' we denote an electron , a hole or an exciton in a nanotube .",
    "the self - trapped states of quasiparticles are usually described in the adiabatic approximation which is equivalent to the semiclassical consideration in which the vibrational subsystem is described as a classical one .",

    "some of them , sometimes , coexist at the same values of the coupling constant .",
    "some of these solutions are shown in figs .",

    "the lattice deformation in this case is very large and so we had to scale it down to the physical scale . once again , the lattice is contracted at the position of the polaron and the lattice sites where the polaron is located have all moved into the nanotube .",
    "we name these solutions - the type iv solutions.    the four classes of solutions we have presented so far , correspond to the same family of solutions obtained when one varies @xmath93 and takes @xmath103 and @xmath104 . in figs .",

    "<S> we study numerically self - trapped ( polaron ) states of quasiparticles ( electrons , holes or excitons ) in a deformable nanotube formed by a hexagonal lattice , wrapped into a cylinder ( carbon- and boron nitride - type nanotube structures ) . </S>",
    "<S> we present a hamiltonian for such a system taking into account an electron - phonon interaction , and determine conditions under which the lowest energy states are polarons . </S>",
    "<S> we compute a large class of numerical solutions of this model for a wide range of the parameters . </S>",
    "<S> we show that at not too strong electron - phonon coupling , the system admits ring - like localized solutions wrapped around the nanotube ( the charge carrier is localized along the nanotube axis and uniformly distributed with respect to the azimuthal coordinate ) . at stronger coupling </S>",
    "<S> , solutions are localized on very few lattice sites in both directions of the nanotube . </S>",
    "<S> the transition from one type solution to the other one depends on the diameter of the nanotube . </S>",
    "<S> we show that for the values of the carbon nanotube parameters , the polarons have a ring - like structure wrapped around the nanotube with a profile resembling that of the nonlinear schrdinger soliton .    </S>",
