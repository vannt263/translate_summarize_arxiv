    "the one - dimensional heisenberg models have been extensively studied in solid state physics ( see references in @xcite ) .",
    "interest in these models has been revived lately by several proposals for realizing quantum computation @xcite and information processing @xcite using quantum dots ( localized electron spins ) as qubits . an intriguing phenomenon in such quantum systems with more",
    "than one component is entanglement .",
    "it refers to the non - classical correlations that exist among these components . due to this nature ,",
    "quantum entanglement has recently been recognized as an indispensable physical resource for performing classically impossible information processing tasks ; such as quantum computation , teleportation @xcite , key distribution @xcite and superdense coding @xcite . in any physically realistic consideration of quantum - information - processing device , it is important to take into account the fact that it would be in thermal contact with some heat bath .",
    "consequently , entanglement in interacting heisenberg spin systems at finite temperatures has been investigated by a number of authors ( see , e.g. , ref.@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the state of a typical solid state system at thermal equilibrium ( temperature @xmath1 ) is @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the hamiltonian , @xmath4 is the partition function , and @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the boltzmann s constant .",
    "the entanglement associated with the thermal state @xmath7 is referred to as the thermal entanglement @xcite .    to achieve a quantitative understanding of the role of entanglement in the field of quantum information science , it is necessary to quantify the amount of entanglement that is associated with a given state .",
    "several entanglement measures have been proposed .",
    "one famous example is the wootters concurrence @xcite .",
    "consider a two - qubit state @xmath8 , the wootters concurrence @xmath9 \\equiv \\max\\{\\lambda_1 - \\lambda_2 - \\lambda_3 - \\lambda_4,\\ 0\\},\\ ] ] where @xmath10 @xmath11 are the square roots of the eigenvalues in decreasing order of magnitude of the spin - flipped density - matrix operator @xmath12 , the asterisk indicates complex conjugation .",
    "wootters concurrence is closely related to the entanglement of formation @xcite .",
    "it appears as an auxillary function that has to be evaluated when computing the entanglement of formation .",
    "recently , mintert , ks and buchleitner ( mkb ) @xcite proposed generalizations of wootters concurrence for multipartite quantum systems , which can be evaluated efficiently for arbitrary mixed states .",
    "this is an extremely important development in our investigation of multipartite entanglement , a subject we have yet to achieve a complete understanding .    with the availability of such a good and computable measure of entanglement for systems of two qubits ,",
    "many thoroughly analyzed the thermal entanglement in two - qubit heisenberg models in terms of thermal concurrence @xcite .",
    "the recent breakthroughs in the experimental physics of double quantum dot ( see , e.g. , ref.@xcite ) shows that these studies are worthwhile pursuits .",
    "interestingly , kamta _ et al . _",
    "@xcite showed that the anisotropy and the magnetic field may together be used to control the extent of thermal concurrence in a two - qubit heisenberg @xmath0 model and , especially , to produce entanglement for any finitely large @xmath1 , by adjusting the external magnetic field beyond some finitely large critical strength .",
    "such robustness is absent in the case of two - qubit heisenberg @xmath13 model .",
    "a natural question is whether thermal entanglement of a heisenberg @xmath0 chain with more qubits has similar behavior .",
    "this question is not only of practical importance but also of fundamental importance ( see , for instance , ref.@xcite ) . in this paper , we provide answers for heisenberg @xmath0 chains with any even number of qubits by analyzing the mkb concurrences associated with their thermal states .",
    "our paper is organized as follows .",
    "since the results of mkb @xcite is crucial to our analysis , we will present them in the following section .",
    "however , we do so explicitly in the context of direct relevance to our paper , i.e. , @xmath14-qubits . specifically , when @xmath15 , the mkb concurrence coincides with the wootters concurrence",
    ". it thus allows us to understand the special property of the thermal entanglement of the two - qubit heisenberg @xmath0 model , in the light of a mathematical property of the mkb concurrences ( see eq.([approx ] ) ) .",
    "this together with a discussion of the two - qubit heisenberg @xmath0 model @xcite will be given in section iii .",
    "we show , in section iv , that the thermal entanglement of the four - qubit heisenberg @xmath0 chain has behavior similar to the two - qubit case .",
    "namely , anisotropy and magnetic field may together be used to produce _ genuine _ multipartite entanglement @xcite for any finitely large @xmath1 by adjusting the external magnetic field beyond some finitely large critical strength .",
    "this can again be understood in the light of the same mathematical property of mkb concurrences .",
    "our results agree with those in ref.@xcite , which employed bipartite entanglement measure . in general , it is not sufficient to only consider bipartite entanglement .",
    "for instance , the greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) state @xcite is a state with genuine multipartite entanglement but yields zero entanglement between one particle and any other particle . on the other hand ,",
    "the w state @xcite is one where every particle is entangled with every other particle , but it has no genuine multipartite entanglement @xcite .",
    "multipartite entanglement surely is more interesting .",
    "therefore , our study complements theirs .",
    "however , we must emphasize that our analysis more importantly demonstrates that the thermal entanglement of the heisenberg @xmath0 chains have the characteristic behavior due to two reasons .",
    "first , in the presence of a finitely large external magnetic field , the ground state of the model has non - zero genuine multipartite entanglement .",
    "second , for non - zero temperatures , this ground state is the highest weight state ( with weight @xmath16 , i.e. , the thermal state is almost a _ pure _ state ) when a finitely large enough magnetic field is applied . in section",
    "v , we show that this is indeed the case for the six - qubit heisenberg @xmath0 chain .",
    "we thus have firm mathematical basis ( eq.([approx ] ) ) to establish that the thermal entanglement in this case will exhibit similar characteristic behavior .",
    "most important of all , the mkb concurrences may be directly measured for multipartite pure states @xcite .",
    "it is thus possible to experimentally verify our conjecture that for any even @xmath14 , it is always possible to obtain non - zero genuine multipartite entanglement at any finite temperature by applying a sufficiently large magnetic field .",
    "further discussions of this possibility and a summary of our results will be presented in the concluding section vi .",
    "consider an @xmath14-qubit pure state @xmath17 , the mkb concurrence is defined as the expectation value of a hermitean operator @xmath18 that acts on two copies of the state @xcite : @xmath19 \\equiv \\sqrt{{\\langle \\psi|}\\otimes{\\langle \\psi|}a{|\\psi\\rangle}\\otimes{|\\psi\\rangle}}.\\ ] ] in general , @xmath18 could have the form @xmath20 where @xmath21 , @xmath22 are projectors onto the symmetric and antisymmetric subspaces of @xmath23 . here , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 is an orthonormal basis of @xmath27 .",
    "the summation in eq.([defa ] ) is performed over the set @xmath28 , which contains all @xmath14-long strings of @xmath29 s and @xmath30 s with even number of @xmath30 s .",
    "the superscript @xmath29 indicates that the string with @xmath14 @xmath29 s is not included in the sum .",
    "this is because for separable states , its expectation value in the symmetric twofold copy is non - zero .",
    "terms with odd number of @xmath31 s are naturally excluded in the sum since their expectation values in the twofold copy states is always zero .    by choosing the value of all the @xmath32 s in eq.([defa ] ) to be 4 , an entanglement monotone @xmath33 can be obtained . the resulting operator @xmath34 can equivalently be written as @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "the concurrence @xmath33 of an @xmath14-qubit pure state @xmath36 can then be written as @xmath37 = 2^{1-n/2}\\sqrt{(2^n-2){\\langle \\psi|\\psi\\rangle}-\\sum_i\\mathrm{tr}\\rho_i^2}.\\ ] ] the above summation runs over all @xmath38 reduced density operators @xmath39 of the state @xmath40 .",

    "it is possible to define an mkb concurrence @xmath41 that detects multipartite entanglement , by choosing the operator @xmath42 .",

    "since the mkb concurrence @xmath217 can be determined exactly , it is calculated for states @xmath215 and @xmath161 under different combinations of @xmath72 and @xmath1 ( some results are shown in table [ comc4 ] ) .",
    "the two values for each combination of @xmath72 and @xmath1 are then compared . for a given temperature ,",

    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     hence , for @xmath210 , the revival and robustness of entanglement in the heiseberg four - qubit model can be understood , as in the two - qubit case , in terms of the large @xmath72 behaviors of both the mkb concurrence @xmath220 $ ] ( eq.([largeeta ] ) ) and the statistical weight @xmath211 ( eq.([lw ] ) ) .",
    "we may conclude , when @xmath221 , that the entanglement associated with @xmath215 is of the genuine four - partite kind @xcite .",
    "the total entanglement as measured by @xmath222 thus also undergoes revival since genuine four - partite entanglement is only one kind of the entanglement measured by @xmath222 .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath223 and large @xmath72 , the ground state is the product state @xmath224 .",
    "this is an important distinction between the four - qubit _ xx _ model and the _ xy _ model .",
    "consequently , no revival of entanglement is observed for the case of four - qubit isotropic heisenberg @xmath13 chain .",
    "we may apply the above analysis employing @xmath41 to study heisenberg @xmath0 chains with even number @xmath14 of qubits .",
    "firstly , we determine if the ground state @xmath225 remains genuinely multipartite entangled at large @xmath72 .",
    "secondly , we determine if the ground state statistical weight @xmath226 can be made very close to 1 at large @xmath72 . through eq.([approx ] ) , these two properties together imply that for any finite temperature , nonzero genuine multipartite entanglement can always be obtained by applying a large enough magnetic field .",
    "we show that the six - qubit heisenberg @xmath0 chain has both properties in the next section .",
    "in this section , we show that the six - qubit heisenberg @xmath0 chain ( with @xmath210 ) does indeed possess the characteristic properties , which enable the model to have non - zero thermal entanglement at any given finite temperature when subject to an external magnetic field of appropriate strength . to this end",
    ", we determine the eigenstate @xmath225 of @xmath227 whose eigenvalue @xmath228 is the minimum when @xmath72 is large . here , @xmath229 with @xmath230 . and , @xmath231 with @xmath232 and @xmath233 the mkb concurrence @xmath234 is calculated for this state , giving @xmath235 = 2n^2|\\theta_1\\theta_8 + 6\\theta_2\\theta_5 + 6\\theta_3\\theta_6 + 3\\theta_4\\theta_7|.\\ ] ] in the limit of large @xmath72 , @xmath235 \\approx 2\\gamma^3\\eta^{-3}.\\ ] ] it can again be shown that @xmath225 is a genuine six - partite entangled state @xcite .",
    "in addition , the statistical weight @xmath226 of the ground state @xmath225 can be shown numerically to be close to unity when an appropriately large magnetic field is applied .",
    "the ground state @xmath225 therefore possesses the two desired properties for the system to have non - zero genuine six - partite entanglement at any finite temperature , provided an appropriate magnetic field is applied .",
    "we conjecture that the robustness of genuine multipartite entanglement is a general property of heisenberg @xmath0 chain with even number of particles .",
    "this conjecture can be experimentally tested , as will be discussed in the next section .",
    "in this study , we have investigated in detail the origin of the robustness of genuine multipartite entanglement in two- , four- , and six - qubit heisenberg @xmath0 models .",
    "two important properties possessed by the ground states @xmath225 of these models , which enable them to exhibit the characteristic robustness , were identified .",
    "the first property , namely the statistical weight @xmath226 associated with @xmath225 can be made very close to unity by applying a large enough magnetic field , allows us to use eq.([approx ] ) and conclude that the mkb concurrence of the thermal state @xmath7 equals that of the ground state .",
    "it follows that we could obtain fairly accurately the mkb concurrence of @xmath7 ( a mixed state ) by calculating the mkb concurrence of @xmath225 ( a pure state ) in this case .",
    "the second property being that @xmath225 remains genuinely multipartite entangled under such a magentic field , then guarantees that there is non - zero genuine multipartite entanglement for any finite temperature as long as sufficiently large magnetic field is applied .",
    "these properties allow us to extend our study to @xmath0 chains with any even number of qubits .",
    "heisenberg @xmath0 chains with odd number of qubits were not considered in this study because @xmath236 for odd @xmath14 .",
    "however , one could similarly study the robustness of other kinds of entanglement employing the other mkb concurrences .",
    "in fact , the applicability of our analysis is not only restricted to the heisenberg @xmath0 chains . as long as the ground state of a system",
    "can be made to dominate the thermal state at any finite temperature by adjusting some parameters of the system hamiltonian , eq.([approx ] ) tells us that the mkb concurrence of the thermal state is given by that of the ground state .",
    "so , if in addition , the ground state remains multipartite entangled under these conditions , similar robustness of multipartite entanglement is expected to be observed .",
    "therefore , our analysis can be used to identify possible candidates for realization of quantum computation at finite temperatures .",
    "the mkb concurrences @xmath237 and @xmath238 can be directly measured for pure states , if two copies of the states are available @xcite .",
    "this is obviously due to the fact that the mkb concurrences are defined in terms of expectation values of hermitean operators .",
    "indeed , this has lead to the direct measurement of wootters concurrence , previously thought to be not directly measurable , for pure states in laboratory @xcite .",
    "since we are interested in the region where the ground state @xmath225 is the only state that contributes significantly to the thermal state @xmath7 , the state @xmath7 is  almost pure \" and therefore it is possible to measure the mkb concurrences of @xmath7 with a high degree of success .",
    "the results obtained here can thus be experimentally verified .    in conclusion ,",
    "we have established a rather general method of identifying systems that exhibit robustness of multipartite entanglement at finite temperatures .",
    "our analysis rest on the mathematical property of the mkb concurrences , namely eq.([approx ] ) .",
