    "one of the remaining problems yet to be understood within star formation is the collapse of a cloud into a star , and the relatively slow star formation rate observed .",
    "this problem suggests there is some form of support preventing the clouds from collapse ( at least initially ) .",
    "for instance , if typical ( m @xmath1 10@xmath2 m@xmath3 ) molecular clouds had no support , and so were in free - fall collapse , with all the mass going into stars , cloud lifetimes would be unrealistically short , and the star formation rate would be up to three orders of magnitude greater than observed @xcite .",
    "thermal pressure is weak compared to the gravitational stresses in the cloud , so the support may come from the magnetic field that permeates the gas or the pressure of turbulent eddies  indeed it is likely that these two mechanisms are coupled .    spinning elongated dust grains in such star forming regions can become aligned to the local magnetic field , such that the grains semi - major axes are perpendicular ( on average ) to the magnetic field lines .",
    "the net thermal emission from such grains is polarised ( perpendicular to the direction of the magnetic field lines ) , and can be used to trace the morphology of the magnetic field as seen projected onto the plane of the sky .",
    "further information can be gained on the magnetic field via zeeman splitting @xcite , which yields the line of sight magnetic field strength .",
    "ion / neutral linewidths @xcite , can also be used to gain information on the orientation of the magnetic field .    in order to understand the importance of the magnetic field on large scales , consistent with tracing the magnetic field in the envelope of these cores",
    ", we present scuba 850@xmath4 m imaging polarimetry of 20 star forming cores .",
    "we also introduce a new , improved ( more representative ) method of data reduction for scuba polarimetry , which presents the errors in polarisation in a truer light .",
    "we discuss the implied magnetic field morphology across the cores , as well as the estimated field strength for some of the regions using the modified ( * ? ? ?",
    "* henceforth cf ) method .",
    "we use this estimate to indicate the importance of the magnetic field on these scales on the support of these clouds , and compare the mean magnetic field direction to the outflow directions , to see if they correspond in the plane of the sky .",
    "the sample of high - mass star - forming regions were selected from the arcetri water maser atlas @xcite based on the following criteria : i ) well known and studied star - forming regions , ii ) varied morphologies , iii ) submillimetre bright @xcite ; and iv ) observable from the jcmt in hawaii ( i.e. @xmath5 ) .",
    "the observations took place over several nights between 1998 may 16 and 2000 october 10 at the james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) in hawaii .",
    "the submillimetre common user bolometer array ( scuba ) @xcite was used in conjunction with the polarimeter  consisting of a rotating quartz half - wave retarder ahead of a fixed wire - grid analyser ; @xcite  which was mounted on the entrance window to scuba .",
    "the jiggle - mapping mode of observation was used , involving ` jiggling ' the secondary mirror to fully sample the beam .",
    "sixteen different positions ( 1 second exposures at each ) are required to fully sample the map  these positions have a separation of 6.18 for the long - wavelength ( 850@xmath4 m ) array .",
    "the secondary mirror performed the usual chop during the jiggle pattern to provide atmospheric cancellation .",
    "the nod was carried out over periods of around 10 - 20 seconds to eliminate slowly varying sky gradients .",
    "the polarimeter complicates the normal observing procedure such that complete 16-point jiggle maps are required at specific positions of the half - wave retarder , each separated by 22.5 . therefore 16 jiggle maps are observed to complete one cycle of the retarder .",
    "the direction of the chop - throw was decided based on the morphology of the target .",
    "the data reduction was carried out using the routines from the scuba user reduction facility ( surf ) @xcite to reduce the scuba images and routines from polpack @xcite were used to reduce the polarimetry .",
    "the nod and chop of the telescope were corrected for and the flat - field applied to the observations in the standard manner .",
    "the atmospheric extinction was calculated based on the start and end times of each observation : throughout the night the caltech submillimetre observatory ( cso ) phase monitor measures the @xmath6 ( or @xmath7 ) , and a polynomial was fitted to the measured points .",
    "this polynomial was then applied to the start and end times of the observation to calculate the @xmath7 for the observation and converted into @xmath8 using :    @xmath9    for the data taken before october 2000 , and :    @xmath10    for the data taken during and after october 2000 .",
    "the extinction is assumed to vary linearly throughout the observation .",
    "the airmass at which each bolometer measurement was made is calculated then multiplied by the zenith sky extinction .",
    "each data point was then multiplied by the exponential of the optical depth to give the value that would have been measured in the absence of the atmosphere .",
    "bolometers which were deemed excessively noisy were switched off at this point in the data reduction .",
    "the sky noise was removed using bolometers that had no significant flux from the source .",
    "the average ( mean ) flux from these bolometers was assumed to come from sky emission , and was subtracted from all of the bolometers in order to remove the sky signal .",
    "the instrumental polarisation was removed in the usual manner .",
    "the data were re - gridded using a gaussian weighting function , with the scale set to 7 ( half the beamsize ) .",
    "the pixel size was set to 6.18 , matching the jiggle pattern , in order to calculate the polarimetry vectors accurately .",
    "polpack packages are then used to calculate the stokes parameters by fitting the following curve @xcite to the data :    @xmath11    where @xmath12 is the expected intensity in image @xmath13 , @xmath14 is the wire - grid analyser transmission factor , @xmath15 is the analyser polarising efficiency factor and @xmath16 is the effective retarder position angle after correction for the parallactic angle for image @xmath13 .",
    "the polarisation percentage and position angles of the vectors are then calculated from the stokes parameters , without any binning .",
    "the catalogue was clipped such that noisy polarisation vectors were not included .",
    "the clipping used was @xmath17 and @xmath18 . for 3% polarisation , this represents a maximum position angle error of 7.15 .",
    "it was chosen to clip the vectors on polarisation errors instead of signal - to - noise , as clipping on the latter would result in disposing of points where the polarisation is low or zero , both of which are perfectly valid measurements .    finally , flux calibration @xcite was carried out using observations of uranus , saturn and crl2688 .",
    "the flux calibration factors ( fcfs ) are listed in table [ tab : fcf ] .",
    "these fcfs were applied to the data , with any objects observed over more than one night having the data for each night reduced separately , then the flux calibrated images co - added to create the final image .",
    ".table of flux calibrators and flux calibration factors . [ cols=\"<,^,^ \" , ]     theoretically , magnetic fields play an important role in the launching and collimation mechanisms of outflows , and so it would be of interest to see if any relationship between the observed magnetic field direction on these large scales , and the jet / outflow axis exists .",
    "previous studies of the alignment of t - tauri stars with the local magnetic field @xcite reveal a possible connection between the strength of the ctts jets and their orientation with respect to the magnetic field .",
    "interestingly , they conclude that the ctts s with jets align to the magnetic field , but as a whole sample ( i.e. both ctts s with and without jets ) , the population is randomly orientated with respect to the magnetic field , which they say suggests either the influence of the magnetic field is dominant at large scales ( whole cloud ) but largely decreases on the much smaller scale of individual objects , or , the orientation of the ctts s has changed since they first formed .    table  [ tab : pol ] shows the mean polarisation percentage , position angles of the magnetic field and outflow , and the difference between the magnetic field and outflow directions . the determined magnetic field vectors are not true ( i.e. undirectional ) vectors .",
    "they have a 180 ambiguity , and as such have position angles of between 0 and 180 .",
    "the magnetic field direction for each region is determined by calculating the weighted mean of the measured vectors .",
    "the smallest difference between the magnetic field direction and the outflow direction is assumed , and the results are plotted in fig .",
    "[ misalign ] .",
    "figure  [ misalign ] is a cumulative distribution function , which shows that , for the whole sample ( excluding s157 , which as yet has no identified outflow , to the authors knowledge ) , given the ( weighted ) mean position angle of the magnetic field vectors , the magnetic fields within the sample appear randomly oriented with respect to the the jet / outflow direction .",
    "the kolmogorov - smirnov test reveals the whole sample has a 84.9% chance of being randomly orientated .",
    "the sample has been split into two sub - samples  those which have the outflow axis mainly in the plane of sky ( i.e. @xmath19 to the line of sight ) , and those which have the outflow axis close to the line of sight ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "gl2591 is not included in either of these sub - samples however , as the outflow axis lies close to @xmath21 .",
    "whilst all of the sources with very small differences are in the plane of sky subsample , the cumulative distribution function does not deviate significantly from a random distribution , and the kolmogorov - smirnov test leads to a 57.2% chance of random orientation .",
    "however , the line of sight sub - sample , with no sources showing good alignment between magnetic field and outflow axis , does deviate significantly from the random distribution ( a 36.6% chance of random orientation from the kolmogorov - smirnov test ) , suggesting a relation between the misalignment of the ( plane of the sky ) field and outflow when the outflow lies close to the line of sight .",
    "if an alignment between the magnetic field and the outflow axis does exist and the outflow is close to the line of sight , it would be difficult to assign a direction to the magnetic field , and so misalignment between the inferred field and outflow direction is more likely .",
    "previous mid - infrared spectropolarimetry @xcite reveal that for their sample , overall , there is a large toroidal magnetic field component within the molecular structures associated with embedded young stellar objects .",
    "their sample includes three sources from the sample in this paper ",
    "s140 , monr2 and gl2591 .",
    "their results for s140 and monr2 agree with the findings of this paper  namely that there is a @xmath1 40 difference in alignment .",
    "however , they find the magnetic field of gl2591 to be perpendicular to the 90 outflow , whereas we find it in almost perfect alignment .",
    "this may be due to either a changing magnetic field morphology on different scales , or the magnetic field may have a stronger toroidal component closer in to the protostar / disc .",
    "compared to the submillimetre , the mid - infrared emission comes from closer in towards the source , and it is higher resolution ( has a smaller beamsize ) .",
    "the alignment analysis carried out here needs to be treated with caution , for some regions , e. g. monr2 , s140 , the mean position angle may not accurately represent the field direction .",
    "monr2 , as with some of the other sources , is an extended source , and the polarisation pattern indicates abrupt changes in the direction of the magnetic field . for sources such as these , the best alignment comparison may be made using modal position angle values ( in sufficient bins ) , or possibly from the map itself .",
    "included in table  [ tab : pol ] , where possible , are the opening angles for the jets / outflows . upon quick inspection ,",
    "it is clear that , with the information present , there appears to be no relation between the degree of collimation and the alignment .",
    "gl2591 has a well collimated jet ( position angle @xmath1 95 ) which is almost perfectly aligned to the magnetic field , whereas rcra has an opening angle of 60 , and again is well aligned to the magnetic field .",
    "ggd27 has a well collimated jet with an opening angle of only 1 , but the axis is almost perpendicular to the magnetic field . more information regarding the opening angles of such jets and outflows is needed to enable a more detailed analysis .",
    "a variety of continuum emission morphologies have been observed within this sample . whilst the majority ( 11 out of 16 ) of the sources have a seemingly roughly spherical dense core ( marginally resolved in the jcmt beam ) , several of these sources also exhibit more extended emission associated with the dense core ( e. g. cepheus a , dr21(oh ) , iras 20188 + 3928 ) . of these sources ,",
    "the polarisation percentage often decreases with increasing intensity across the cores , whereas in the extended emission the polarisation percentage often remains stable .",
    "this may be due to the gas and dust being less dense in the regions of the extended emission , or may be the magnetic field has a simpler , less twisted morphology in these areas .",
    "morphologically , field lines both parallel ( cepheus a , w49 ) and perpendicular ( dr21(oh ) , s157 ) to the major axis of the extended emission are observed .",
    "this sample also included dense cores which deviate significantly from spherical ( at least in the plane of the sky , e.g. gl437 , monr2 , ngc6334a ) .",
    "of these sources the magnetic field is observed to be perpendicular to the major axis of the core in gl437 and rcra .",
    "the field morphology of monr2 and ngc6334a are complex , with the fields changing direction abruptly",
    ". this may be due to multiple cores unresolved by the jcmt beam .",
    "the plane of the sky magnetic field strengths have been calculated based on signal - to - noise ( 3 ) clipped vectors .",
    "the fields range from @xmath00.1 mg ( w49n ) to 5.7 mg ( cepheus a ) , although the majority of them are around 0.20.4 mg . out of the three strongest magnetic fields",
    "( cepheus a , dr21(oh)n , rcra ) , both dr21(oh)n and rcra have field morphologies that may indicate ambipolar diffusion ( the field is perpendicular to the major axis of the emission ) .",
    "cepheus a , however , has the strongest field , and the field is parallel to the major axis of the extended emission .",
    "previous polarimetric studies of w48 and s152 @xcite , reveal magnetic field strengths and polarisation patterns consistent with the findings in this paper .",
    "w48 exhibits depolarisation across the main core , whereas the polarisation percentage remains the same across the candidate hmpo w48w .",
    "s152 is a more complex region , consisting of ridges of gas and dust and the s152se core  the candidate hmpo .",
    "the magnetic field is both parallel and perpendicular to the ridges in places , but across the s152se core , the polarisation percentage remains at @xmath1 8% and the field is perpendicular to the major axis of emission .",
    "the field strengths across the candidate hmpos were calculated to be 0.7 mg for w48w and 0.2 mg for s152se , consistent with the magnetic field strengths calculated for the star forming regions in this paper .",
    "we present the largest ( to date ) sample of high mass star forming regions observed using submillimetre polarimetry .",
    "we describe an improved method of scuba polarimetry data reduction .",
    "the magnetic field geometries ( from the intensity weighted vectors , projected onto the plane of the sky ) are presented , along with calculations of the core masses , densities and field strengths .",
    "the sources observed reveal a variety of morphologies for both the continuum emission and the magnetic field .",
    "the majority of the sources have dense cores that are unresolved in the beam , but some also have extended emission associated with the cores . in several of the regions ,",
    "the polarimetry is uniform , suggesting ordered , relatively strong magnetic fields .",
    "a decrease in polarisation percentage across the cores is often seen , suggesting twisting or non - alignment of the dust grains in these cores .",
    "the polarisation percentage often remains stable across the extended emission , which may imply that in these areas , the magnetic field has a simpler , less twisted morphology , or it may be that as the extended emission is less dense , the dust grains do not become misaligned to the magnetic field .",
    "we see field morphologies perpendicular to the major axis of the continuum emission ( dr21(oh ) , rcra , s157 ) , which could suggest ambipolar diffusion for these sources .",
    "it should also be noted that both of these regions which have outflows , have magnetic fields that align well with the outflow axes .",
    "we also see fields that are parallel to the extended emission , e.g. cepheus a , however , the field in this region also aligns well with the outflow axis , and has the strongest magnetic field strength in this sample .",
    "it is interesting in this case that the extended emission is in the direction of the outflow .",
    "an analysis of the mean position angle of the polarisation vectors and the outflow axes has been carried out . whilst the sample as a whole has a cumulative distribution function similar to that expected if the magnetic field and outflow axes were randomly orientated , if the sample is broken down by inclination , into those predominantly in the line of sight , and those predominantly in the plane of the sky , the line of sight sample distinctly favours non - alignment , which would be expected if the magnetic field had a large line of sight component too , as it is then difficult to establish a magnetic field direction from the polarimetry .",
    "the plane of the sky sample only shows a marginal increase in alignment though .",
    "we discuss the caution needed in interpretation of this analysis as the mean position angle of the vectors may not be the best representation of the field direction for all sources . in the sources",
    "where the field direction changes abruptly , modal averages ( in reasonable bin sizes ) may be more representative .",
    "also , the polarimetry maps remain a very good way of analysing the alignment .",
