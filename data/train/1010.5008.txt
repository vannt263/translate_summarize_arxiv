    "inside the stop gap , the bragg reflection removes intensity from the diffuse scattering .",
    "this redistribution does not necessarily influence the cbs enhancement factor considering that the bragg peak does not lead to additional single scattering .",
    "a decrease of the incoherent single scattering background in the stop gap may even be expected as single scattering from the photonic crystal coherently adds to the specular bragg reflection and is thus suppressed at other angles .",
    "the overall increase of scattering intensity toward shorter wavelengths and larger angles of incidence is consistent with an increase of the enhancement factor which can be attributed to more efficient randomization of light in the medium .     scattering intensity from the 130-nm ( a ) and 180-nm ( b ) opals , for angles of incidence from 8@xmath20 to 50@xmath20 , measured at a detection angle of 5@xmath20 using helicity conserving channel .",
    "subsequent spectra are offset by 0.5 for visibility , starting from @xmath29 ( no offset).,width=325 ]    another pronounced feature in @xmath24 are the troughs at the band edges observed for the @xmath8  nm opal in fig .",
    "[ fig : cbsimage](d ) .",
    "the conditions of these throughs appears correlated with presence of sharp peaks in the scattering intensity of fig .",
    "[ fig : scattering](a ) , which currently is not explained by any models .",
    "these effects resemble the characteristic behavior of the group velocity as well as recent measurements of scattering mean free path.@xcite such a reduction of the single scattering length @xmath83 at the band edges is not observed in the apparent mean free path @xmath23 of fig .",
    "[ fig : cbsimage](c ) , as @xmath23 is averaged over many different directions in the crystal .",
    "we propose that the cbs enhancement factor is inherently more sensitive to directional band structure effects through its dependence on single - scattering , and therefore changes of @xmath83 can result in variations of @xmath24 .",
    "the large variations in @xmath24 observed in our experiment call for new theory for diffuse light in ( partially ) ordered nanophotonic materials .",
    "some of the variations in the cbs enhancement can not be associated with the behavior of the total scattering intensity in fig .",
    "[ fig : scattering ] , but may be associated to the use of circularly polarized light in our experiments .",
    "markedly , there is the drop in @xmath24 associated with the second stop band at @xmath44 .",
    "this opposite behavior to the increase of @xmath24 in the l - gap points to a difference in helicity of single scattering , possibly due to brewster angle effects.@xcite for the l - gap at @xmath7 , the parallel and perpendicular components perceive exactly the same bragg reflectivities and thus no change of the polarization state of circularly polarized incident light should occur .",
    "strong polarization dependence of light transmitted and reflected from opals was identified in several studies.@xcite polarization effects have also been found in ref .  , where in particular cross - polarized cbs cones were reported .",
    "our measurements of the cross - polarized channel only showed an angle - independent response ; no cross - polarized cbs cones were detected .",
    "we have investigated multiple scattering of light in three - dimensional polystyrene opal photonic crystals using white - light coherent backscattering spectroscopy .",
    "our experiments significantly extend on earlier measurements by covering simultaneously a large frequency and angular range .",
    "the measurements of the backscattering cone width at frequencies near the stop bands confirm the model by refs .",
    "[ ] which includes internal reflection and the limited penetration depth of the incident light .",
    "the semi - empirical model matches the experiments without the need to include effects of density of states or group velocity , such as were proposed in ref .",
    "in addition , we report photonic band structure contributions in the cbs enhancement factor .",
    "we propose that the cbs enhancement factor , being particularly sensitive to single scattering , thus contains information on properties which are washed out in other aspects of the multiple scattering cbs cone",
    ". a better understanding of group velocity and other band structure effects to the enhancement factor will require further theoretical studies .",
    "the presented experimental approach using white - light coherent backscattering opens up studies on diffuse light transport in novel materials .",
    "future investigations may look toward stronger scattering photonic crystals such as tio@xmath4 or silicon inverse opals or silicon inverse woodpiles@xcite , for which effects of the density of states could be observable .",
    "other examples where the interplay of disorder - or reduced symmetry - and band structure is expected to result in novel phenomena are photonic quasicrystals@xcite and optical graphene.@xcite",
