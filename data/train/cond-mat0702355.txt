    "the properties of materials are strongly influenced by electronic interaction and randomness .",
    "in particular , coulomb correlations and disorder are both driving forces behind metal - insulator transitions ( mit ) connected with the localization and delocalization of particles .",
    "the mott - hubbard mit is caused by coulomb correlations ( electronic repulsion ) in the pure system @xcite .",
    "the anderson mit , also referred to as anderson localization , was established in @xcite and is the basis of the theory of localization of electrons in disordered systems .",
    "it is due to coherent backscattering from randomly distributed impurities in a system without interaction @xcite .",
    "it is therefore a challenge to investigate quantum models where both aspects are simultaneously present .",
    "the mott - hubbard mit is characterized by opening a gap in the density of states at the fermi level . at the anderson localization , the character of the spectrum at the fermi level changes from a continuous one to a dense discrete one .",
    "it is plausible that both mits could be detected by knowing the local density of states ( ldos ) , as it discriminates between a metal and an insulator , which is driven by correlations and disorder @xcite . in many recent works @xcite , the change of the whole ldos distribution function at the anderson transition",
    "were explored for the bethe and for the simple cubic lattices , where many other effects , like interaction , percolation and binary alloy disorder , were included .",
    "the theoretical investigation of disordered systems requires the use of probability distribution functions ( pdfs ) for the random quantities of interest and one is usually interested in typical values of these quantities which are mathematically given by the most probable value of the pdf . in many cases the complete pdf",
    "is not known , i.e. , only limited information about the system provided by certain averages ( moments or cumulants ) is available . in this situation",
    "it is of great importance to choose the most informative average of a random variable . for examples ,",
    "when a disordered system is near the anderson mit , most of the electronic quantities fluctuate strongly and the corresponding pdfs possess long tails @xcite and at the anderson mit the corresponding moments might not even exist .",
    "this is well illustrated by the ldos of the system .",
    "the arithmetic mean of this random one - particle quantity does not resemble its typical value at all .",
    "in particular , it is noncritical at the anderson transition and hence can not help to detect the localization transition .",
    "by contrast , it was shown @xcite that the geometric mean gives a better approximation of the averaged value of the ldos , as it vanishes at a critical strength of the disorder and hence provides an explicit criterion for anderson localization @xcite .",
    "besides that , the work @xcite suggests that by considering the anderson localization , the moments of the distribution of the resolvent kernel are of essential importance .    theoretical descriptions of the mit have to be nonperturbative if no long - range order exists on either side of the transition",
    ". a nonperturbative framework to investigate the mott - hubbard mit in lattice electrons with a local interaction and disorder is given by the dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we investigate the anderson - falicov - kimball model .",
    "the pure falicov - kimball model describes two species of particles , mobile and immobile , which interact with each other when both are on the same lattice site .",
    "the falicov - kimball model captures some aspects of the mott - hubbard mit , i.e. , upon increasing the interaction the ldos for mobile particles splits into two subbands opening a correlation gap at the fermi level . in the anderson - falicov - kimball model the mobile particles",
    "are disturbed by a local random potential .",
    "the model is solved within the dmft framework .",
    "anyway , there is no reason to believe that just the geometric mean can offer a good approximation for the averaged ldos .",
    "actually , if we consider the generalized mean we can show that the averaged ldos can vanish in the band center at a critical strength of the disorder for a wide variety of averages . here , we use the hlder mean in order to analyze how the averaged ldos depends on each hlder parameter that is used and whether , in particular , the geometric mean can offer a better approximation than the arithmetic one .",
    "a generalized mean , also known as hlder mean , is an abstraction of the pythagorean means including arithmetic , geometric and harmonic means .",
    "if @xmath0 is a non - zero real number , we can define the generalized mean with exponent @xmath0 of the positive real numbers @xmath1 as @xmath2    as special cases , we can find , for example , the minimum ( @xmath3 ) , the geometric mean ( @xmath4 ) , the arithmetic mean ( @xmath5 ) and the maximum ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "a power mean emphasizes small ( big ) values for small ( big ) @xmath0 .",
    "in section [ model ] we present the anderson - falikov - kimball model and its solution using the dmft @xcite .",
    "we also present the relation between the disorder strength and the coulombian repulsion for the linearized dmft with @xmath0-averaging . in section [ results ] we present the numerical results concerning the ground - state phase diagram obtained using the hlder mean and compare them with the results of previous works @xcite . finally in section [ conclusions ] we present our conclusions and final remarks .",
    "the falicov - kimball model is , presently , the simplest model to study metal - insulator transitions in mixed valence compounds of rare earth and transition metal oxides , ordering in mixed valence systems , order - disorder transitions in binary alloys , itinerant magnetism , and crystallization .",
    "recently , it was also applied to study the possibility of electronic ferroelectricity in mixed - valence compounds , and also of the phase diagram of metal ammonia solutions @xcite . in its most simplified version , namely the static model ,",
    "it consists in assuming that in the system exist two species of spinless fermions : one of them possess infinite mass and hence does not move while the other one is free to move @xcite .    in the anderson - falicov - kimball model",
    "@xcite the mobile particles are disturbed by a local random potential , giving rise to a competition between interaction and disorder yielding stabilization of metalicity .",
    "this model is defined by the following hamiltonian : @xmath7 where @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) and @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) are , respectively , the creation ( annihilation ) operators for the mobile and immobile fermions ( electrons and ions , respectively ) at a lattice site @xmath12 , @xmath13 is the electron transfer integral connecting states localized on nearest neighbor sites and @xmath14 is the coulombian repulsion that operates when one ion and one electron occupy the same site .",
    "the average number of electrons ( ions ) on site @xmath12 is denoted as @xmath15 ( @xmath16).the energy @xmath17 is a random , independent variable , describing the local disorder disturbing the motion of electrons . for simplicity",
    ", it was assumed that just mobile particles are subjected to the structural disorder @xcite .",
    "the number of ions and electrons is considered independent of each other and fixed .",
    "if there is no long - range order , the position of the ions on a lattice is random , what introduces additional disorder apart from that given by the @xmath17 term in the hamiltonian ( [ hamil ] ) .",
    "we consider that the occupation @xmath18 on the @xmath12th site has probability @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "in the @xmath14 term in the hamiltonian ( [ hamil ] ) one has to take the quantum - mechanical average over a given quantum state of the @xmath21 particles , what does not transform the extended states into the localized ones . in the @xmath17 term",
    "one has to average the quantum - mechanical expectation values over different realizations of @xmath17 , what can lead to the anderson localization @xcite .    in the pure falicov - kimball model , if @xmath22 , the fermi energy for electrons is inside of the correlation ( mott ) gap opened by increasing the interaction @xcite .",
    "how the disorder changes this gap and how the @xmath0-averaging influences the presence of localized states are the subjects of the present study .",
    "the anderson - falicov - kimball model , where the interaction and disorder are local , is solved within the dmft .",
    "the formalism that is used is the same from @xcite , where @xmath23 denotes the energy , the number of the immobile particles is conserved being zero or one and the chemical potential @xmath24 is introduced only for the mobile subsystem .    using the hybridization function @xmath25 , which is a dynamical mean field ( molecular field ) describing the coupling of a selected lattice site with the rest of the system @xcite , the @xmath17-dependent ldos is @xcite @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the local @xmath17-dependent green function described in @xcite .    from the @xmath17-dependent ldos , we introduce the @xmath0-averaged ldos @xmath28^{q}\\right\\}^{1/q}.\\label{eq3}\\]][aq ] where the subscript @xmath0 stands for the chosen average .",

    ", the ldos vanishes in the band center and is arbitrarily small in the vicinity of the mit ( but on the metallic side ) .",
    "the ground - state properties in the half - filled band case are solely determined by the quantum states in the band center ( @xmath45 ) . in this sense , by linearizing the dmft equations we can determine the transition points on the phase diagram . due to the symmetry of @xmath46 , in the band center we have that @xmath47 and is purely imaginary @xcite , what leads to the recursive relation @xmath48 .",

    "[ cur ] for different @xmath0 s .",
    "we can clearly see that for values of @xmath0 greater than @xmath69 , @xmath37 always increases with @xmath14 , what characterizes the mott - hubbard mit . for values of @xmath0 smaller than @xmath69",
    "we can always identify three regions with respect to the states at the fermi level : extended gapless phase , localized gapless phase and gap phase @xcite .    as already pointed out in @xcite , depending on the spectral properties of the anderson - falicov - kimball model , we distinguish three different regimes : weak , intermediate and strong interaction regime . in the weak interaction regime",
    "the mott gap is not open ; in the intermediate interaction regime , the mott gap is open at @xmath70 and in the strong interaction regime the mott gap , determined within the dmft framework with @xmath0 less than @xmath69 , is always open even at large disorder .",
    "the mott and anderson insulators are continuously connected .",
    "hence , by changing @xmath14 and @xmath37 it is possible to move from one type of insulator to the other without crossing the metallic phase .",
