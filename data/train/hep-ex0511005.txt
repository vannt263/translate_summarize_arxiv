    "a review can be found in @xcite , physics potential of low gamma @xmath0b has been studied in @xcite .",
    "performances of @xmath0b with @xmath2 are extremely promising but rather speculative , because they are not based on an existing accelerator complex nor on a robust estimation of the ion decay rates . for a cern based beta beam ,",
    "fluxes have been estimated in @xcite , and the physics potential for a beam fired to a 440 kton water cerenkov detector @xcite hosted under the frejus , at 130 km from cern , has been firstly computed in @xcite . so far",
    "the frejus site @xcite is the only realistic candidate at a suitable baseline for a cern based @xmath0b with @xmath3 .",
    "this work updates and consolidates performances computed in @xcite for a @xmath0b where both @xmath4  and @xmath5   ions have @xmath6 ( @xmath0b100 ) , the optimal setup for a 130 km distance . in particular signal efficiency , background estimation , energy binning will be revised and all the sensitivities will be computed using the open source program globes @xcite , allowing for an estimation of performances in presence of degeneracies .",
    "finally the beta beam performances will be computed as function of the duty cycle .",
    "signal events in @xmath0b , charged current ( cc ) events , are selected with standard superkamiokande particle identification algorithms .",
    "the muon identification is reinforced by asking for the detection of the michel decay electron .",
    "data reduction is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratio_eff ] for @xmath5   events and detailed in tab .  1 .",
    "as pointed out in reference @xcite , it is necessary to use a migration matrix to properly handle the fermi motion smearing in the @xmath0b100 energy range .",
    "the matrices , computed with nuance @xcite , have 25 true energy bins and 5 reconstructed energy bins in the energy range @xmath7 gev , see fig .",

    "the migration matrix approximation has a visible effect in the leptonic cp violation discovery potential , as discussed in section [ sec : sensitivities ] .",
    "atmospheric neutrino can constitute an important source of backgrounds @xcite .",
    "they can be suppressed only by keeping a very short duty cycle , and this in turn is one of the most challenging bounds on the design of the beta beam complex .    to compute the rate of this background , the total integrated rate of atmospheric   in sk , in the energy range of @xmath0b100 ,",
    "is considered .",
    "this rate is scaled to the 440 kton fiducial mass and corrected for the difference of atmospheric neutrino fluxes between kamioka and frejus @xcite .",
    "the direction of the incident neutrino at 400 mev , according to nuance , can be reconstructed with a @xmath8 radians resolution .",
    "a @xmath9 cut around the cern - frejus direction is then applied .",
    "finally the efficiency curves of section  [ sec : eff ] are applied to the remaining events . assuming 8 bunches 6.25 ns long in the 7 km long decay ring , the duty cycle is @xmath10 .",
    "atmospheric neutrino backgrounds sum up to 13 background events per ion specie in a 4400 kton - year exposure ( @xmath11 s / year ) .    in the following ,",
    "sensitivities are computed with this background , the effect of a higher duty cycle is discussed in session [ sec : dutycicle ] .      charged pions generated in nc events ( or in nc - like events where the leading muon goes undetected ) are the main source of background for the experiment . to compute this background inclusive nc and",
    "cc events have been generated with the @xmath0b100 spectrum .",
    "events have been selected where the only visible track is a charged pion above the cerenkov threshold .",
    "particle identification efficiencies have been applied to those particles . with geant 3.21 the probability for a pion to survive in water until its decay have been computed .",
    "this probability is different for positive and negative pions , these latter having a higher probability to be absorbed before decaying .",
    "the surviving events are backgrounds and the reconstructed neutrino energy is computed mis - identifying these pions as muons .",

    "[ cols=\"^ , > , > , > , > , > , > \" , ]     these background rates are significantly smaller from what quoted in @xcite , where pion decays were computed with the same probabilities of the muons .",
    "sensitivity to @xmath12is by definition the performance of the experiment in absence of signal .",
    "it has been computed for 10 years running time ( 5 @xmath4 + 5 @xmath5 ) with @xmath13 useful @xmath4   decays / year and @xmath14 useful @xmath5   decays / year .",

    "the systematic errors for signal and backgrounds has been fixed to 2% .    the sensitivity curve , fig .",
    "3 , is a 6 parameters fit minimized over the solar and the atmospheric parameters and projected over @xmath12 .",
    "degeneracies induced by the unknown values of @xmath20and @xmath25 are not accounted for .",
    "[ fig : th13 ]    in case of signal it is important to quantitatively assess the discovery potential for leptonic cp violation ( lcpv ) .",
    "it is computed at @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) taking into account all the parameter errors and all the possible degeneracies . as common practice in literature",
    "@xmath28 has been used , to leave room for the octant ( @xmath29 ) degeneracy . in fig .",
    "4 discovery potential is computed under 4 different hypotheses of the true parameters , normal : @xmath20=1 , @xmath30 ; sign : @xmath20=-1 , @xmath30 ; octant : @xmath20=1 , @xmath31 ; mixed : @xmath20=-1 , @xmath31 .",

    "also shown are the lcpv discovery potentials neglecting the degenerate solutions .",
    "effect of degeneracies are sometimes visible for high values    [ fig : deltacp ]    of @xmath12 , precisely the region where they can be reduced by a combined analysis with atmospheric neutrinos @xcite .",
    "several effects play significant roles in the final lcpv discovery potential , as gaussian approximation for the energy binning or systematic errors bigger than 2% , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : diff_effects ]",
    "a critical parameter in designing the beta beam complex is the duty cycle . due to the available longitudinal acceptance in the decay ring , @xmath32 fluxes",
    "can only be increased by increasing the number of bunches in the decay ring @xcite .",
    "an extremely short duty cycle , aimed to keep the atmospheric background close to zero , was the choice for the @xmath33 @xmath0b @xcite , where the experimental backgrounds were close to zero . for the @xmath6 option",
    ", a modest rate of atmospheric neutrino backgrounds is tolerable . to assess the highest possible duty cycle for @xmath34 , lcpv performances have been computed ( neglecting degeneracies ) by varying the duty cycle under two hypotheses :",
    "the overall fluxes remain constant or the overall fluxes rise as function of the duty cycle as discussed in @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dc ]    fig .  7",
    "right , shows performances at constant fluxes .",
    "the degradation of performances is evident at the smaller values of @xmath12 , where the background level is the dominant factor , while at higher values of @xmath12the performances are rather stable .",
    "the left plot of fig .  7 shows performances computed with the flux - duty cycle relationship of fig",
    ".  6 . here",
    "the nominal fluxes have been assumed for 20 bunches in the decay ring both for @xmath4   and @xmath5   ions .",
    "this assumption is more optimistic of what quoted in @xcite , the purpose of this plot is not to display performances of @xmath0b100 but to show how performances scale as function of the duty cycle .",
    "discovery potential increases up the point where a flux saturation occurs , roughly for 75 @xmath4   bunches and for 150 @xmath5   bunches .",
    "this latter plot shows that the high intensity frontier for the beta beams is as promising as the high gamma scenarios .",

    "the beta beam design study for the baseline cern option is running",
