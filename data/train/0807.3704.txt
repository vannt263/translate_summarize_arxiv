    "what it does is to give a different proof of the main result of @xcite which , in turn , offers an alternative proof of an important result of popa in @xcite that may be paraphrased as saying that any subfactor planar algebra arises from an extremal subfactor .    in this introductory section , we will briefly review the main result of @xcite and the ingredients of its proof and compare and contrast the proof presented here with that one .",
    "the main result of @xcite begins with the construction of a tower @xmath0 of graded @xmath1-algebras with compatible traces @xmath2 associated to a subfactor planar algebra @xmath3 .",
    "next , appealing to a result in @xcite , the planar algebra @xmath3 is considered as embedded as a planar subalgebra of the planar algebra of a bipartite graph as described in @xcite .",
    "it is shown that that the traces @xmath2 are faithful and positive and then @xmath4-factors @xmath5 are obtained by appropriate completions ( in case the modulus @xmath6 - which is the only real case of interest ) .",
    "it is finally seen that the tower of @xmath5 s is the basic construction tower for ( the finite index , extremal @xmath4-subfactor ) @xmath7 and that the planar algebra of this subfactor is naturally isomorphic to the original planar algebra @xmath3 .",
    "the proofs all rely on techniques of free probability and random matrices and indeed , one of the stated goals of the paper is to demonstrate the connections between these and planar algebras .",
    "the _ raison dtre _ of this paper is to demonstrate the power of planar algebra techniques .",
    "we begin with a short summary of our notations and conventions regarding planar algebras in section 2 . in section 3",
    ", we describe a tower @xmath8 of filtered @xmath1-algebras , with compatible traces and ` conditional expectations ' , associated to a subfactor planar algebra @xmath3 .",
    "the positivity of the traces being obvious , we show in section 4 that the associated gns representations are bounded and thus yield a tower of finite von neumann algebra completions .",
    "the heart of this paper is section 5 which is devoted to showing that these completions are factors and to computations of some relative commutants .",
    "the penultimate section 6 identifies the tower as a basic construction tower of a finite index extremal subfactor with associated planar algebra as the original @xmath3 .",
    "the final section exhibits interesting trace preserving @xmath1-isomorphisms between the algebras @xmath0 of @xcite and our @xmath8 , thus justifying - to some extent - the first sentence of this paper .",
    "all our proofs rely solely on planar algebra techniques and in that sense our paper is mostly self - contained .",
    "we will need neither the embedding theorem for a subfactor planar algebra into the planar algebra of a bipartite graph nor any free probability or random matrix considerations . in the trade - off between analytic techniques and algebraic / combinatorial techniques that is characteristic of subfactor theory",
    ", it would be fair to say that @xcite leans towards the analytic approach while this paper takes the opposite tack .",
    "after this paper had been written , we communicated it to jones requesting his comments .",
    "he wrote back saying that this  may be similar to @xcite \" which appears on his homepage ; and we discovered that this is indeed the case .",
    "the purpose of this section is to fix our notations and conventions regarding planar algebras .",
    "we assume that the reader is familiar with planar algebras as in @xcite or in @xcite so we will be very brief .",
    "recall that the basic structure that underlies planar algebras is an action by the ` coloured operad of planar tangles ' which concept we will now explain .",
    "consider the set @xmath9 , whose elements are called colours .",
    "we will not define a tangle but merely note the following features .",
    "each tangle has an external box , denoted @xmath10 , and a ( possibly empty ) ordered collection of internal non - nested boxes denoted @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 .",
    "each box has an even number ( again possibly 0 ) of points marked on its boundary .",
    "a box with @xmath14 points on its boundary is called an @xmath15-box or said to be of colour @xmath15 .",
    "there is also given a collection of disjoint curves each of which is either closed , or joins a marked point on one of the boxes to another such .",
    "for each box having at least one marked point on its boundary , one of the regions ( = connected components of the complement of the boxes and curves ) that impinge on its boundary is distinguished and marked with a @xmath1 placed near its boundary .",
    "the whole picture is to be planar and each marked point on a box must be the end - point of one of the curves .",
    "finally , there is given a chequerboard shading of the regions such that    the @xmath1-region of any box is shaded white .",
    "a @xmath16-box is said to be @xmath17 box if the region touching its boundary is white and a @xmath18 box otherwise .",
    "a @xmath16 without the @xmath19 qualification will always refer to @xmath17 .",
    "a tangle is said to be an @xmath15-tangle if its external box is of colour @xmath15 .",
    "tangles are defined only upto a planar isotopy preserving the @xmath1 s , the shading and the ordering of the internal boxes .",
    "we illustrate several important tangles in figure [ fig : imptangles ] .    )",
    ".,height=321 ]    this figure ( along with others in this paper ) uses the following notational device for convenience in drawing tangles . a strand in a tangle with a _ non - negative integer _",
    ", say @xmath20 , adjacent to it will indicate a @xmath20-cable of that strand , i.e. , a parallel cable of @xmath20 strands , in place of the one actually drawn .",
    "thus for instance , the tangle equations of figure [ cabledef ] hold .        in the sequel , we will have various integers adjacent to strands in tangles and leave it to the reader to verify in each case that the labelling integers are indeed non - negative .",
    "a useful labelling convention for tangles ( that we will not be very consistent in using though ) is to decorate its tangle symbol , such as @xmath21 or @xmath22 , with subscripts and a superscript that give the colours of its internal boxes and external box respectively . with this",
    ", we may dispense with showing the shading , which is then unambiguously determined .",
    "another useful device is to label the marked points on any @xmath15-box with the numbers @xmath23 in a clockwise fashion so that the interval from @xmath14 to @xmath24 is in its @xmath1-region .",
    "the basic operation that one can perform on tangles is substitution of one into a box of another .",
    "if @xmath25 is a tangle that has some internal boxes @xmath26 of colours @xmath27 and if @xmath28 are arbitrary tangles of colours @xmath29 , then we may substitute @xmath30 into the box @xmath31 of @xmath25 for each @xmath20 - such that the ` @xmath1 s match ' - to get a new tangle that will be denoted @xmath32 .",
    "the collection of tangles along with the substitution operation is called the coloured operad of planar tangles .",
    "a planar algebra @xmath3 is an algebra over the coloured operad of planar tangles . by this , is meant the following : @xmath3 is a collection @xmath33 of vector spaces and linear maps @xmath34 for each @xmath35-tangle @xmath25 with internal boxes of colours @xmath36 .",
    "the collection of maps is to be ` compatible with substitution of tangles and renumbering of internal boxes ' in an obvious manner . for a planar algebra @xmath3 ,",
    "each @xmath37 acquires the structure of an associative , unital algebra with multiplication defined using the tangle @xmath38 and unit defined to be @xmath39 .    among planar algebras ,",
    "the ones that we will be interested in are the subfactor planar algebras .",
    "these are complex , finite - dimensional and connected in the sense that each @xmath37 is a finite - dimensional complex vector space and @xmath40 are one dimensional .",
    "they have a positive modulus @xmath41 , meaning that closed loops in a tangle @xmath25 contribute a multiplicative factor of @xmath41 in @xmath42 .",
    "they are spherical in that for a @xmath16-tangle @xmath25 , the function @xmath42 is not just planar isotopy invariant but also an isotopy invariant of the tangle regarded as embedded on the surface of the two sphere .",
    "further , each @xmath37 is a @xmath43-algebra in such a way that for an @xmath35-tangle @xmath25 with internal boxes of colours @xmath36 and for @xmath44 , the equality @xmath45 holds , where @xmath46 is the adjoint of the tangle @xmath25 - which , by definition , is obtained from @xmath25 by reflecting it .    finally , the trace @xmath47 defined by : @xmath48 is postulated to be a faithful , positive ( normalised ) trace for each @xmath49 .",
    "we then have the following fundamental thorem of jones in @xcite .",
    "[ jones ] let @xmath50 be the tower of the basic construction associated to an extremal subfactor with index @xmath51 = \\delta^2 < \\infty$ ] .",
    "then there exists a unique subfactor planar algebra @xmath52 of modulus  @xmath41 satisfying the following conditions :    \\(0 ) @xmath53 - where this is regarded as an equality of * -algebras which is consistent with the inclusions on the two sides ;    \\(1 ) @xmath54 ;    \\(2 ) @xmath55 ;    \\(3 ) @xmath56 ; and this ( suitably interpreted for @xmath57 ) is required to hold for all @xmath58 .",
    "conversely , any subfactor planar algebra @xmath3 with modulus  @xmath41 arises from an extremal subfactor of index @xmath59 in this fashion .",
    "recall that a finite index @xmath4-subfactor @xmath60 is said to be extremal if the restriction of the traces on @xmath61 ( computed in @xmath62 ) and @xmath63 to @xmath64 agree .",
    "the notations @xmath65 and @xmath66 stand for the trace preserving conditional expectations of @xmath67 onto @xmath68 and @xmath69 respectively .",
    "the converse part of jones theorem is , in essence , the result of popa alluded to in the introduction , as remarked in @xcite .",
    "it is this converse , as proved in @xcite , for which we supply a different proof in the rest of this paper .",
    "we note that the multiplication tangle here agrees with the one in @xcite but is adjoint to the ones in @xcite and in @xcite while the rotation tangle is as in @xcite but adjoint to the one in @xcite .",

    "the first two statements follow from the fact that @xmath78 and @xmath73 give ( appropriately scaled ) conditional expectation maps that preserve a faithful , positive trace while the third is a consequence of the compatibility of the tangle @xmath1 and the @xmath1 of the @xmath43-algebra @xmath76 .",
