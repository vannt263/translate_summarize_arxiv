    ", they appear to be the ` missing link ' between open clusters and globular clusters ( e.g. , @xcite ) . as such , understanding their formation may provide the link to understanding globular cluster formation .",
    "if ymcs and even globular clusters form in a similar way to open clusters , then our knowledge of nearby stellar systems may potentially be used as a framework to understanding star formation across cosmic time , back to globular cluster formation @xmath0 10 gyr ago .",
    "an understanding of the formation of clusters requires observations of their natal dust and gas well before the onset of star formation . in recent surveys of dense cluster - forming molecular clumps ,",
    "one object , g0.253 + 0.016 , stands out as extreme @xcite .",
    "located at a distance of @xmath08.5kpc , g0.253 + 0.016 lies @xmath0100pc from the galactic centre @xcite . with a dust temperature of @xmath020  k , effective radius of @xmath02.9pc , average volume density of @xmath110@xmath2@xmath5 , mass of @xmath010@xmath6m@xmath3 , @xcite and devoid of prevalent star - formation , g0.253 +",
    "0.016 has exactly the properties expected for the precursor to a high - mass , arches - like cluster . despite being identified over a decade ago , its significance as a precursor to a high - mass cluster has only recently been investigated in detail @xcite .",
    "recent work shows that the volume density threshold predicted by theoretical models of turbulence , which depend on the gas mean volume density and 1-dimensional turbulent mach number , is @xmath010@xmath2@xmath5 for the solar neighbhourhood and is @xmath010@xmath7@xmath5 for the high - pressure inner 200pc environment of the central molecular zone ( cmz ; @xcite ) .",
    "the lack of current star formation within g0.253 + 0.016 is consistent with its location in the cmz and this environmentally dependent volume density threshold for star formation , which is orders of magnitude higher than that derived for the solar neighbourhood @xcite .",
    "because g0.253 + 0.016 is close to virial equilibrium , has sufficient mass to form a ymc through direct collapse , and shows structure on @xmath0 0.3pc scales @xcite , it provides an ideal template to investigate whether or not ymcs form through hierarchical fragmentation , in a scaled up version of open cluster formation . detailed studies of clumps like g0.253 + 0.016 have the potential to reveal the gas structure in protoclusters before star formation has turned on and significantly disrupted its natal material .",
    "if ymcs like the arches are the missing link between globular clusters and more typical open clusters , the detailed study of protoclusters like g0.253 + 0.016 may reveal the initial conditions for star formation not only within high - mass clusters , but potentially for all clusters .",
    "both theoretical studies @xcite and simulations @xcite suggest that high - mass clusters form through the hierarchical merging of overdensities in the interstellar medium .",
    "while some of this hierarchical structure may also be evident in the initial stellar distribution @xcite , it can be easily erased over long time - scales , either via the structure s dispersal ( if unbound ) or relaxation ( if bound ) . in either case , these processes are expected to give rise to spherically symmetric stellar clusters and a background field star population ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . notwithstanding this theoretical picture",
    ", numerical studies of the early phase of cluster evolution often model the gas as a spherically - symmetric background potential ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although notable exceptions exist ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this disparity between cluster formation theory , which suggests a highly structured initial state , and the early evolutionary modelling , which usually posit a smooth spherical initial state can be resolved by characterising the observed gas structure within high - mass protoclusters before star formation has begun .",
    "the outcome of the high - mass cluster formation process is well - known .",
    "observations show that ymcs are centrally condensed with @xmath8m@xmath3 of stars in their central @xmath9  pc .",
    "thus , the puzzle is then : is this central condensation of stars set by the initial gas structure or do they relax into this small , centrally concentrated region over time ?    to answer this question and to distinguish between the models , requires observations of protocluster clumps with a significant improvement in angular resolution , dynamic range , and sensitivity compared to those obtained to date .",
    "fortunately , the new atacama large millimeter / sub - millimeter array ( alma ) provides the necessary improvements and allows us , for the first time , to image protoclusters across the galaxy with comparable physical resolution ( i.e. , @xmath10 0.1pc ) to clouds in the nearby solar neighbourhood .",
    "our goal is to determine the location , mass , and kinematics of the small - scale fragments within g0.253 + 0.016 .",
    "the new alma data reveal the internal structure and kinematics in this high - mass protocluster down to spatial scales of 0.07pc ( fig .",
    "[ three - colour - image ] ) . as such",
    ", these data can be used to determine how the material is distributed within this protocluster .",
    "we imaged the 3 mm ( 90ghz ) dust continuum and molecular line emission across g0.253 + 0.016 using 25 antennas as part of alma s early science cycle 0 . because alma s field of view at this wavelength is @xmath0 1.2 and the cloud is large on the sky ( 3 @xmath11 1 ) ,",
    "a 13-pointing mosaic was obtained to cover its full extent .    using alma s band 3 ,",

    "this setup we obtained the 3 mm dust continuum emission and also covered a number of excellent tracers of dense molecular and shocked gas , in particular : hcn , hco@xmath14 , c@xmath15h , sio , so , h@xmath16co@xmath14 , h@xmath16cn , hn@xmath16c , hcc@xmath16cn , hnco , h@xmath15cs ch@xmath17sh , nh@xmath15cho , ch@xmath17cho , nh@xmath15cn , and hc@xmath18n ( for brevity in the text , we refer to the molecular transitions simply by the name of the molecule , e.g. , hcn v=0 j=10 will be called ` hcn ' ; see table  [ lines ] for the quantum numbers of the transitions , frequency , critical densities , and excitation energies ) .    to build up the signal to noise and improve the @xmath19-coverage , g0.253 + 0.016 was imaged on six different occasions over the period 29 july  1 august 2012 .",
    "we used the alma early science ` extended configuration ' ; the projected baselines range from 13455 m. all data reduction was performed using the casa and miriad software packages .",
    "each individual dataset was independently calibrated ( by our alma support scientist ) before being merged together .",
    "we performed the cleaning and imaging to produce the final data products . because the emission from adjacent 1.7 km  s@xmath13 spectral channels are correlated , the final data cubes were resampled to have a velocity width of 3.4 km  s@xmath13 per channel .",
    "the alma data have an angular resolution of @xmath01.7 ( @xmath00.07 pc ) , with a 1@xmath20 continuum sensitivity of @xmath0 25@xmath21jy beam@xmath13 and line brightness sensitivity of 1.0 mjy beam@xmath13 per 3.4 km  s@xmath13 channel .",
    "because the interferometric alma data are insensitive to emission on the largest angular scales ( @xmath1 1.2 ) , where possible we used single - dish data to fill in the missing zero - spacing information . given that the emission from the clump is extended ( 3@xmath111 ) and the emission from the dust continuum and many of the molecular transitions on spatial scales @xmath1 1.2 significant , it was critical that the zero - spacing information was included to properly sample the @xmath19-plane ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the combination of the alma data with the zero - spacing information was performed in the fourier domain and was achieved using the corresponding single - dish data as a model during the cleaning process .",
    "the inclusion of the single - dish data in this manner is superior to using alternatives task such as ` feathering ' ( see @xcite for details ) . for this technique to be applicable",
    "there must be an overlapping region of spatial frequencies between the two datasets .",
    "fortunately , for both the continuum and line datasets , existing single - dish data provided the necessary coverage for inclusion with the alma data .",
    "ideally , the single dish data should have the same signal - to - noise as the interferometric data that they are being combined with .",
    "although the signal - to - noise of the single dish data is lower than that of the alma data , it is high enough that the gain from recovering the zero - spacing information outweighs the increased noise that they may introduce .    to recover the zero - spacing information for the alma line cubes ( hcn , hco@xmath14 , c@xmath15h , sio , hnco ) , we used data from the malt90 survey which were obtained using the mopra 22 m telescope @xcite . to convert these data from t@xmath22 to the flux @xmath23 in jybeam@xmath13 , we used a scaling factor of 23 k / jybeam@xmath13 , calculated via the equation t@xmath22= 1.36@xmath24 @xmath23 /(@xmath25@xmath26 ) , using a fwhm beam size , @xmath27 , of 38 , wavelength , @xmath28 , of 3 mm , and a main beam efficiency , @xmath25 , of 0.49 @xcite .",
    "for the continuum image , since we do not have a direct measurement of the emission at 3 mm on the larger angular scales , it was necessary to estimate the flux at 3 mm . to achieve this we scaled an image of the dust continuum emission at 500 @xmath21 m ( _ herschel _ , 33 angular resolution ) to what is expected at 3 mm assuming that the flux scales like @xmath29 , where @xmath30 was assumed to be 1.2 .",
    "_ herschel _ data were used for this purpose as these data provide the most reliable recovery of the large scale emission .",
    "we choose to scale the 500 @xmath21 m _ herschel _ image as it is the closest in wavelength to 3 mm , minimising the effect of the assumption of @xmath30 ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "figure  [ alma - sd ] compares the single dish , alma - only , and combined ( alma and single dish ) images for both the continuum and the hnco integrated intensity . for the 3 mm dust continuum emission , the alma - only image recovers @xmath018% of the total flux .",
    "the images clearly show the significant improvement in angular resolution provided by alma and the recovery of the emission on the large spatial scales provided by the inclusion of the zero - spacing information .",
    "figure  [ three - colour - image ] shows a two colour image of g0.253 + 0.016 combining infrared images from the _ spitzer space telescope _",
    "( 24@xmath21 m , @xmath06 angular resolution , shown in cyan ) with the new millimetre image from alma ( 3 mm , @xmath01.7 angular resolution , shown in red ) .",
    "contours show single dish dust continuum emission ( jcmt 450@xmath21 m , @xmath0 7.5 angular resolution ) . identified as an infrared dark cloud ( irdc ) , g0.253 + 0.016 is clearly seen as a prominent extinction feature in mid - ir images . because it is so cold , its thermal dust emission peaks at millimeter / sub - millimeter wavelengths . moreover , since the 3 mm dust continuum emission is optically thin , internal structure is easily revealed by the alma images .",
    "while the overall morphology of the dust continuum emission revealed by alma matches well the mid - ir extinction and the large - scale dust continuum emission provided by the single dish image , the alma image shows significant structure on the small - scale .",
    "the emission is neither smooth nor evenly distributed across the clump ; it is highly fragmented and there is a clear concentration of emission toward its centre .",
    "these small - scale fragments are presumably the cores from which stars may form .",
    "because the 3 mm continuum emission is optically thin , given standard assumptions about the dust emissivity , it can be used to determine the column density and , hence , mass of its small - scale fragments .",
    "recent observations from _ herschel _ of the 170500 @xmath21 m dust continuum emission , show that the dust temperature ( t@xmath31 ) within g0.253 + 0.016 decreases smoothly from 27 k on its outer edges to 19 k in its interior @xcite .",
    "external to g0.253 + 0.016 , the dust temperatures are considerably higher , @xmath135 k. within the cloud and on the spatial scales probed by the _",
    "herschel _ data ( @xmath033 , @xmath01 pc ) , no small volumes of heated dust are apparent .",
    "all of the millimetre emission detected by alma falls within the region for which t@xmath31 was measured to be @xmath4 22k .",
    "thus , we assume that the temperature of the dust detected by alma ranges from 1922k and use a value of 20 @xmath32 1k for all calculations .    assuming this dust temperature , a standard value of the gas to dust mass ratio of 100 , a dust absorption coefficient ( @xmath33 ) of 0.27 @xmath34 g@xmath13 ( using @xmath35 = 0.8 @xmath34 g@xmath13 , and @xmath36 @xcite , ) and a @xmath30 of 1.2 @xmath32 0.1 , the intensity of the 3 mm emission can be converted into the h@xmath15 column density , n(h@xmath15 ) , by multiplying the measured fluxes by a single conversion factor of 1.9 @xmath1110@xmath37@xmath38/mjy .",
    "we assume that t@xmath31 is constant across the cloud .",
    "for the small range of measured dust temperatures in g0.253 + 0.016 , this approximation is well justified . given these assumptions , the uncertainties for t@xmath31 and @xmath30",
    "introduce an uncertainty of 10% for the column density , volume density , mass , and virial ratio .",
    "the column densities across g0.253 + 0.016 measured from the alma - only image range from 0.5 - 82 @xmath11 10@xmath39@xmath38 , with a mean value of 1.0 @xmath11 10@xmath39@xmath38 . since this image detects only the highest contrast peaks within the cloud and does not include the large - scale emission , we also determine the column density distribution using the combined ( alma+sd ) image which is more representative of the total column of material associated with g0.253 + 0.016 . when including the emission on all spatial scales , we find that the mean column density is @xmath0 8.6 @xmath11 10@xmath39@xmath38 and an order of magnitude higher compared to molecular clouds in the solar neighbourhood ( see @xcite for a detailed discussion of the column density distribution across g0.253 + 0.016 and its comparison to solar neighbourhood clouds ) .      the 3 mm ( 90ghz ) spectrum is rich in molecular lines that span a range in their excitation energies and critical densities ( see table  [ lines ] ) .",
    "as such , these observations also provide data cubes from many molecular species and reveal a wealth of information about the gas kinematics and chemistry within g0.253 + 0.016 .",
    "figure  [ integrated - intensity - images ] shows , along with the dust continuum image , the integrated intensity images for each of the detected molecular transitions . clearly seen",
    "are the differences in the morphology of the emission from the various tracers , indicating that the chemistry and excitation conditions vary considerably within the clump .    to quantify the differences in the morphology of the integrated intensity for each molecular transition compared to the others and the dust continuum emission , we have determined the 2-d cross - correlation function for all combinations of image pairs .",
    "figure  [ corr ] shows the derived correlation coefficients for each transition with respect to all others ( the lower half of the figure shows the correlation coefficients via a colour scale , the upper half of the figure shows the derived values ) . for each particular tracer",
    "( labelled along the diagonal ) the molecular transition for which it has the highest correlation coefficient can be found by searching for the darkest square either in the row to its left or in the column below ( the corresponding values are mirrored in the upper portion of the figure ) .",
    "we find that the morphology of the dust continuum emission is not highly correlated with any gas tracer , but is most correlated with the morphology of the emission from the molecules with high excitation energies ( nh@xmath15cho in particular ) .",
    "in addition , we find that the morphology of the emission from hcn and hco@xmath14 are highly correlated with each other and little else , that the shock tracers ( sio and so ) are correlated with each other , and that the dense gas tracers with high excitation energies are well correlated with each other .",
    "figure  [ spectra ] shows example spectra from the detected molecular transitions at several locations across the clump ( spectra from a single pixel were extracted at the positions marked on fig .",
    "[ integrated - intensity - images ] and listed in table  [ spectra - table ] ) .",
    "the spectra clearly show the complexity of the emission and the differences in intensity and velocity detected from the various tracers .",
    "molecular species with lower excitation temperatures ( e@xmath40/@xmath41 @xmath04k , e.g. , hcn , hco@xmath14 , c@xmath15h ) show emission over a wider range in velocity ( @xmath0 1015 km  s@xmath13 ) compared to the isotolopogues ( e.g. , h@xmath16cn , h@xmath16co@xmath14 , hn@xmath16c , and hcc@xmath16cn ; @xmath03 10 km  s@xmath13 ) ) and those with higher excitation temperatures ( e@xmath40/@xmath41 @xmath110k , e.g. , ch@xmath17sh , nh@xmath15cho , ch@xmath17cho , h@xmath15cs , nh@xmath15cn , and hc@xmath18n ; @xmath0 3 km  s@xmath13 ) .",
    "the shocked gas ( traced by sio and so ) also shows emission over a wide range in velocity towards most locations in the clump ( @xmath0 320 km  s@xmath13 ) .",
    "for each molecular transition we characterise the emission via a moment analysis using the definitions of @xcite .",
    "all moments were calculated over the velocity range @xmath1210 km  s@xmath13@xmath4v@xmath42@xmath470 km  s@xmath13 ( this range is delineated by dotted vertical lines on the spectra ) .",
    "the moment analysis allows us to characterise the emission at every point across the map and to easily compare the emission from the various molecular transitions to each other and to the dust continuum emission .",
    "we compute the zeroth moment ( m@xmath43 , or integrated intensity ) , the first moment ( m@xmath44 , the intensity weighted velocity field ) , and the second moment ( m@xmath15 , the intensity weighted velocity dispersion , @xmath20 ) .",
    "these are defined as    @xmath45    where t@xmath22@xmath46 is the measured brightness at a given velocity @xmath47 .",
    "the peak intensity of the emission was also determined via a three - point quadratic fit to each spectrum ( defined as moment @xmath122 ; @xcite ) . note that c@xmath15h has well separated hyperfine components which will affect the first and second moment determinations ( hcn also has hyperfine components , but their separation is less than the observed linewidth for hcn toward g0.253 + 0.016 ) .    to include only the highest signal - to - noise emission in the moment analysis , the peak intensity , intensity weighted velocity field , and the intensity weighted velocity dispersion",

    ", hcn , hco@xmath14 , c@xmath15h , sio , and hnco ) we used a threshold in the integrated intensity of @xmath1 20% of the peak . since the noise level is different and the extended emission is included in these cases , this threshold was chosen so that the moments were calculated only when the emission was significantly detected above the noise .",
    "the choice of this threshold was visually checked ( the region over which the moments were calculated are clearly outlined by the edges of the moment maps ) to ensure that it was appropriate for the moment calculation . for the fainter lines with a lower signal to noise that do not include the large - scale emission , we used a threshold in the peak intensity of @xmath1 3.8 mjybeam@xmath13 ( @xmath05@xmath20 ) .    at locations within the clump where the emission arises from well separated velocity features within the range @xmath1210",

    "in addition , the second moment ( intensity weighted velocity dispersion ) will clearly be larger than the velocity dispersion of the individual velocity components .",
    "thus , while this analysis may not describe well every individual velocity component , it does provide a method by which to easily characterise and compare the emission from the various tracers and the dust continuum across the clump .",
    "figure  [ hcn - moments ] shows the integrated intensity image ( zeroth moment , m@xmath43 ) , peak intensity image , intensity weighted velocity field ( first moment , m@xmath44 ) , and also the intensity weighted velocity dispersion ( second moment , m@xmath15 ) derived from the hcn emission toward g0.253 + 0.016 ( all other lines are included on - line in figs .",

    "all images showing the velocity field and dispersions use the same range of values for the colour coding ( i.e. , from @xmath1220 to 60 km  s@xmath13 and from 0 to 20 km  s@xmath13 respectively ) .",
    "this common colour coding for the different molecular transitions allows easy comparison and readily highlights differences between them .",
    "the images of the velocity field clearly show the well known large - scale velocity gradient across the clump ; most tracers of the dense gas show blue - shifted emission towards more positive declinations and red - shifted emission towards more negative declinations ( i.e. , sio , so , hnco , and h@xmath15cs ) .",
    "some of the more complex molecules ( nh@xmath15cho , ch@xmath17cho , and h@xmath15cs ) are also consistent with this trend .",
    "in contrast to the molecular transitions with lower excitation energies , the transitions from the more complex molecules also reveal emission toward the clump s centre at @xmath020 km  s@xmath13 ( coloured green in these images ) .    the obvious exception to these trends",
    "is seen in the emission from both hcn and hco@xmath14 , which are clearly red - shifted across the whole clump and with respect to all other tracers .",
    "the trend that these optically thick gas tracers are systematically red - shifted with respect to the optically thin and hot gas tracers , indicates that g0.253 + 0.016 exhibits radial motions ( either expanding or contracting , depending on the relative excitation temperatures of the inner and outer portions of the cloud , see @xcite for an in - depth discussion ) .",
    "the trend of red - shifted hcn and hco@xmath14 emission seen in the single - dish data remains in the interferometric data even when the single dish data are not included .",

    "they reveal a complex network of emission features with a complicated velocity structure : there is emission on all spatial scales , the morphology of which ranges from small , compact regions to extended , filamentary structures . toward many of the filamentary features we find homogeneous velocity fields , indicating that they are in fact physically coherent structures .",
    "surprisingly , we find filamentary features in both emission and in absorption .",
    "the absorption filaments are evident in the hcn and hco@xmath14 integrated intensity images and channel maps ( i.e. , figs .  [ hcn - moments ] , [ hco+-moments ] and figs .  [ hcn - channels ] , [ hco+-channels ] respectively ) .",
    "the most intriguing absorption filaments are those seen in hco@xmath14  that extend for more than 20 km  s@xmath13 in velocity . a detailed analysis of these features is discussed in @xcite .",

    "the position - velocity diagrams were made by averaging the emission over the clump s minor axis ( i.e. , in right ascension ) and show the emission along the major axis ( declination ) as a function of velocity .",

    "we show the same plots made including and excluding the large - scale emission ( alma+sd and alma only ; left and right respectively ) to show the effect of its inclusion when calculating the intensity weighted moments . as expected , when including the large - scale emission , we find a clear correspondence between hcn and hco@xmath14 and the lower dust column density material ( i.e. , at column densities @xmath4 5 @xmath11 10@xmath39@xmath38 ) . these molecules clearly show an absence of blue - shifted emission , compared to most others ( compare to figs .",

    "their integrated intensity distribution appears bi - modal , indicating the presence of two distinct integrated intensity values .",
    "their measured velocities span from 0  50 km  s@xmath13 ; this velocity distribution is broader compared to that derived from hcn and hco@xmath14 compared to many of the other transitions because they include the large - scale emission from the single - dish data which , due to the ` intensity weighting ' of the moment calculation and in the case of widespread emission with a broad line profile , will tend to result in a similar calculated value for the intensity weighted velocity despite the emission being detected over a broad range .",
    "see figure  [ compare_dust_lines0 ] for a comparison of these plots for both hcn and hco@xmath14 including and excluding the single dish data to see this effect . ] .",
    "while the peak intensities for the isotopologues and the molecules with the higher excitation energies are smoothly distributed over a similar range in column densities to their integrated intensities , their velocity dispersion distributions are typically concentrated at low values of the velocity dispersion . with the exception of hnco which is far more abundant than these other molecules , we find that the emission predominantly arises from very narrow velocity features ( @xmath49 2 km  s@xmath13 ) .",
    "such narrow velocity dispersions have also been observed toward g0.253 + 0.016 on small spatial scales from other molecular tracers ( i.e. n@xmath15h@xmath14 ( 32 ) ; @xcite ) .",
    "the tail in these distributions to considerably higher velocity dispersions ( dotted contours ) , indicates positions within the clump where the moment analysis has overestimated the velocity dispersion due to multiple velocity components within the spectrum .",
    "this occurs in fewer than 1% of the spectra .    the narrow range in dust column density over which the higher excitation energy molecular transitions are detected can be understood in terms of their critical densities .",
    "these molecules are typically detected when the gas has either a high temperature ( t@xmath50@xmath1100k ) or a high density ( n @xmath1 n@xmath51 ) , or both .",
    "because these conditions are needed for both their formation and excitation , the presence of these molecules can be used to pinpoint gas with these physical conditions .",
    "these molecular transitions all have critical densities of @xmath52@xmath5 ( see table  [ lines ] ) .",
    "thus , while the gas temperature may be low toward the clump s centre , the volume density may be very high .",
    "if the volume densities are sufficiently higher than their critical densities , the molecules may be excited regardless of the gas temperature .",
    "we see a clear trend that molecules with higher excitation energies and critical densities peak toward the centre of the clump ( compared to those with lower excitation energies and critical densities ) .",

[ pv - diagrams ] ) .",
    "these trends are exactly what is expected for a clump with a denser interior .",
    "while the molecular transitions detected by these observations all probe dense gas , they span a range in their critical densities and excitation energies , trace distinct chemical conditions , and often suffer from high optical depths .",
    "as such , they may often trace different material within g0.253 + 0.016 and may not necessarily correlate well with the optically thin dust continuum emission .",
    "one of our key goals is to identify star - forming dust cores within the clump , to measure their sizes , masses , and virial state .",
    "determining these properties will allow us to ascertain the potential of g0.253 + 0.016 to form a cluster and the distribution of masses for its cores . in order to identify bound star - forming cores ,",
    "we need to reliably associate molecular line emission with each dust continuum core in order derive their velocity dispersions .",
    "ideally , we need to identify a molecular transition that is optically thin and is bright enough to be detected in most cores .    given the limited velocity resolution of our data , a detailed analysis of the cores virial states are challenging with the current data .",
    "however , we can gauge , overall , which molecular transitions correlate with the dust emission .",
    "we find that emission from the molecular transitions with higher excitation energies typically provide a better morphological match to the dust column density compared to the transitions with lower excitation energies , the isotopologues , or the shock tracers ( compare the morphology of the dust emission to nh@xmath15cho , ch@xmath17cho , hnco and h@xmath15cs in fig .",
    "[ integrated - intensity - images ] and also their 2-d correlation coefficients shown in figure  [ corr ] ) .",

    "supersonic turbulence is an important mechanism by which overdensities within molecular clouds may be generated @xcite . as such , understanding the degree to which turbulence sets the initial structure within molecular clouds is an important part of understanding core and , ultimately , star formation .",
    "recent work using",
    "the alma dust continuum emission presented here shows that the log - normal shape , dispersion , and mean of its column density probability distribution function ( n - pdf ) very closely matches the predictions of theoretical models of supersonic turbulence in gas given the high - pressure environment in which g0.253 + 0.016 is immersed @xcite .",
    "these results also show that while , overall , the n- pdf shows a log - normal distribution , there is a small deviation from log - normal at the highest column densities , which indicates self - gravitating gas .",
    "this small deviation is coincident with the location of a known water maser @xcite and , thus , pinpoints where star formation is beginning in the cloud . assuming a dust temperature of 20k , this small core ( radius of 0.04pc ) has a mass of @xmath072m@xmath3 and virial ratio , @xmath53 , of @xmath10 1 ( this is an upper limit since the associated molecular line emission is unresolved in velocity , @xmath54 1.4 km  s@xmath13 ; see @xcite for details ) . since @xmath53 is close to unity , this core is gravitationally bound and unstable to collapse .",
    "the fact that the n - pdf for g0.253 + 0.016 matches well predictions from turbulent theory suggests that our current understanding of molecular cloud structure derived from the solar neighbourhood also holds in high - pressure environments @xcite .",
    "this has important implications for understanding the initial gas structure for star formation in a range of different environments across the universe @xcite .    to further determine the extent to which turbulence shapes the observed gas structure within g0.253 + 0.016 , we have calculated the fractal dimension and the turbulent power spectrum .",
    "these statistical methods are commonly used to describe the structure of molecular clouds in both simulations and observations .",
    "an important characteristic of a protocluster clump , and one that is easily revealed by these data , is the distribution of its material on small spatial scales .",
    "if g0.253 + 0.016 represents a clump that will give rise to a high - mass cluster , then the distribution of the material within it before star formation has commenced can provide important constraints for theories that describe cluster formation . as discussed previously ,",
    "there have been a wide range of theoretical and numerical studies showing that the formation of high - mass stellar clusters should proceed hierarchically , but thus far the degree of hierarchal structure within high - mass protoclusters has not been estimated .",
    "the fractal dimension ( d@xmath55 ) can be used to characterise the structure within a molecular cloud .",
    "it is a simple tool that determines the degree to which the emission is smooth and centrally condensed or structured and hierarchical . since observations of dust or molecular line emission",
    "reveal only the 2 dimensional projection of a 3 dimensional structure , care needs to be taken to accurately convert the measured projected fractal dimension ( d@xmath56 ) to the real three - dimensional fractal dimension ( d@xmath55 ) .",
    "this conversion is often assumed to be d@xmath55 = d@xmath56 + 1 @xcite ; however , using simulations of cloud structure , @xcite derive an empirical relation to convert between d@xmath55 and d@xmath56 ( see their figure  8) . rather than a single conversion factor of unity for all values of d@xmath56 , their simulations suggest that d@xmath55 may actually increase linearly as d@xmath56 decreases .",
    "previous observations derive projected fractal dimensions d@xmath57 1.35 ( see @xcite and references therein ) leading to a quoted d@xmath55 for molecular clouds of @xmath0 2.3 @xcite .    to calculate the projected fractal dimension ( d@xmath56 ) for g0.253 + 0.016 , we employ the perimeter - area method @xcite which is often used to measure the fractal dimension of interstellar gas clouds ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "structures were defined as connected regions within a contour at a given intensity level .",
    "the area ( a ) was calculated as the sum of the number of pixels within the contour , the perimeter ( p ) was calculated as the number of pixels externally adjacent to the contour level . by varying the contour levels from the image minimum to its maximum , values for p and a were determined on many spatial scales . with a power - law fit of the form p",
    "@xmath58 a @xmath59 , we can determine the perimeter - area fractal dimension d@xmath56 .",
    "a smooth structure will have d@xmath56 = 1 , while a very convoluted structure will have d@xmath56 = 2 @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fractal - dimension ] shows the perimeter - area plots measured from contours of the dust and line integrated intensity emission . for this analysis",
    "we use , where possible , the data that includes the large - scale emission .",
    "since this analysis is based on contours within an image , the effect of including the large - scale emission simply increases the number of contours to lower levels of the intensity which translates to an increase in the number of points plotted at large perimeters and areas .",
    "their inclusion has little effect on the derived slope .    in all panels",
    "the solid lines show two extreme values for d@xmath56 ( 1 for smooth , centrally condensed emission , 2 for a highly fractal cloud ) .",
    "the dotted lines show linear fits to the data points : the derived values for d@xmath56 range from 1.41.7 , depending on the molecular tracer . for the dust continuum that includes the large - scale emission",

    "d@xmath56 to the three - dimensional fractal dimension d@xmath55 from @xcite , we find that d@xmath55 @xmath0 1.8 for g0.253 + 0.016 .",
    "simulations of compressively driven turbulence in the ism @xcite with mach numbers , @xmath60 , of @xmath0 5.5 , reveal typical values for d@xmath55 of 2.32.6 ( which correspond to d@xmath56 @xmath0 1.31.5 using the empirical relation derived by @xcite ) .",
    "since @xmath60 is @xmath0 30 for g0.253 + 0.016 , it has a much higher level of turbulence compared to most other molecular clouds . given this higher level of turbulence , it may be expected that the sonic length may be lower and the degree of fragmentation might be higher in g0.253 + 0.016 ( i.e. a higher d@xmath56 , and thus , lower d@xmath55 for higher @xmath60 ) . while detailed simulations are necessary to determine the effect of @xmath60 on the fractal dimension , our results are consistent with a marginally higher value for d@xmath56 for g0.253 + 0.016 when compared to typical molecular clouds .",
    "this analysis suggests that the clump is highly fragmented on small spatial scales and its structure consistent with that produced by compressively driven turbulence .",
    "the power spectrum provides a measure of how turbulence is propagated within a molecular cloud and it identifies the preferential spatial scale , if any , at which the structure changes . on large scales",
    "a break in the power spectrum indicates the spatial scale at which turbulent energy is injected , on the small scales it can indicate the spatial scales at which either turbulence is dissipated or injected . measuring the small - scale break point of the power spectrum can therefore reveal the spatial scale at which gravity overcomes the turbulent pressure or the spatial scale at which energy may be injected ( i.e. from protostellar outflows ) .",
    "we use the dust continuum image and several of the integrated intensity images to compute the power spectra .",
    "because the turbulent power spectrum is a statistical measure of the energy on various spatial scales , it is important that the emission is well detected and well sampled across the clump . as such",
    ", we perform this analysis using hcn , hco@xmath14 , hnco , and sio because their data include the zero - spacing information and the emission is detected with high signal - to - noise ratios at all spatial scales across g0.253 + 0.016 .",
    "figure  [ power - spectrum ] shows the annular averages of each of the power spectra , p(k ) , as a function of the spatial frequency , k. the power spectra were generated using a fast fourier transform of the images . in all panels the dotted vertical line marks the spatial frequency corresponding to the angular resolution of the data : the power spectra at spatial frequencies greater than this are not well sampled by these data .    in cases where the power spectrum is close to a power law ( i.e. , for hcn , hco@xmath14 , hnco , and sio emission ) we fit it with a single power law to derive @xmath61 where , p(k ) @xmath58 k@xmath62 . in these cases , we find that @xmath63 3 . a power - law slope of 3 is predicted for a line intensity power spectrum of an optically thick medium @xcite .",
    "thus , the derived power spectrum slope of @xmath0 3 for these molecular transitions are consistent with them being optically thick toward g0.253 + 0.016 .",
    "in contrast , for the dust continuum emission which is optically thin , the power spectrum shows a clear break . while this break occurs at large spatial frequencies ( i.e. small spatial scales ) , it is lies above the spatial frequencies corresponding to the angular resolution of these data ( marked with the vertical dotted line ) . for this power spectrum",
    "we fit two distinct power laws and derive their indicies and the break point . for small values of k (",
    "i.e. , large spatial scales ) the derived power - law index is @xmath63 2.9 compared to @xmath63 7.5 for large values of k ( i.e. , small spatial scales ) .",
    "values for @xmath61 of @xmath0 2.8 are observed toward other star - forming regions such as perseus , taurus and rosetta @xcite .",
    "the trend of a steeper spectrum on smaller spatial scales implies that the higher column density material is concentrated on smaller spatial scales , while the lower column density material is distributed on larger spatial scales .",
    "this is consistent with the distribution of the emission in the dust continuum image .",
    "since the effect of gravity on small scales will cause a steepening of the power - law slope at large spatial frequencies , the spatial scale at which gravity may dominate can be determined from the break point in the power spectrum . from the dust continuum emission power spectrum , we find that the break occurs at spatial frequencies corresponding to size scales of @xmath00.09pc .",
    "this size scale is comparable to the size of the small region of self - gravitating gas that was identified as the deviation at high column densities via the n - pdf @xcite . as such",
    ", this lends support to the idea that gravity has overcome the internal pressure on these small spatial scales .    for cores within molecular clouds to collapse into stars ,",
    "they need to be sufficiently dense that their self - gravity overcomes the thermal pressure .",
    "the jeans length , defined as the minimum length scale for gravitational fragmentation to occur , was determined for g0.253 + 0.016 using the relation    @xmath64    where @xmath65 is the sound speed and n(h@xmath15 ) the volume density . while the measured dust temperature toward g0.253 + 0.016 is @xmath0 20k @xcite , recent observations",
    "indicate that the gas temperature is considerably higher , @xmath0 65k @xcite , leading to the speculation that the gas may be heated by the dissipation of turbulent energy and/or cosmic rays rather than by photon heating .",
    "these observations are supported by sph modelling of the dust and gas temperature distribution in g0.253 + 0.016 which suggest that the gas and dust temperatures are not coupled and that the high interstellar radiation field ( isrf ) and cosmic ray ionisation rate ( crir ) in the cmz are responsible for the discrepant dust and gas temperatures @xcite .    assuming a global gas temperature for g0.253 + 0.016 of 65k",
    "@xcite the corresponding gas sound speed , @xmath65 , is 0.5 km  s@xmath13 . using an average volume density for this material of @xmath0 10@xmath6@xmath5 , we derive @xmath66to be 0.10pc .",
    "this value is comparable to the size scale derived from the break point in the power spectrum of the dust continuum emission and of the size of the self - gravitating core identified via the n - pdf . extrapolating the global size - linewidth relation in figure  [ profiles ] ( top right panel ) to smaller scales , suggests that the line - widths are subsonic on spatial scales of @xmath00.1pc ( the sonic length is @xmath0 0.2pc ) . as such ,",
    "since the sonic length exceeds the derived break point in the power spectrum , the thermal jeans length is indeed the relevant quantity for describing the minimum size scale for gravitational fragmentation .",
    "an absence of a similar break in the power spectra derived from the molecular line emission is consistent with the transitions being optically thick and the dust continuum optically thin .",
    "thus , the small , high - column density features detected in the optically thin dust continuum emission may have formed because gravity was able to overcome the thermal pressure on these small scales .",

    "its volume density profile ( lower left panel of fig .",
    "[ profiles ] ) shows that the average volume density increases with smaller radii , suggesting that the material is more concentrated toward the clump s centre .",
    "we find that the volume density profile follows very well a power law for radii @xmath4 2pc with an index of @xmath731.2 .",
    "in contrast to what is expected for a bonner - ebert sphere and plummer models that are often used to describe the volume density profiles within starless cores and globular clusters , the volume density profile for g0.253 + 0.016 shows no flattening at small radii .    while the total mass of g0.253 + 0.016 is @xmath0 10@xmath6m@xmath3 , its mass profile shows that the majority of the mass originates from the low column density material in its outer edges , at large radii ( upper left panel of fig .",
