    ", the approach to the equilibrium is very slow due to the small value of @xmath170 .",
    "thus , significantly longer runs are necessary to approach the equilibrium .",
    "let us consider a system comprising @xmath7 grains with masses @xmath18 , @xmath171 and periodic boundary conditions , so that @xmath172 and @xmath173 . each grain is assumed to interact only with its left- and right - hand nearest neighbors . as discussed in section  [ sec : two - grain ] , the activation parameter can be absorbed in the initial conditions .",
    "nevertheless , we opt to preserve @xmath10 for reasons explained below .",
    "then , system   for the evolution of the grain masses is expressed as follows for @xmath171    @xmath174    subject to the initial conditions @xmath175 , @xmath171 , at time @xmath176 .",
    "this system also conserves mass , as shown by adding the rates of mass change for all the grains , because each term @xmath177 appears once with a coefficient equal to @xmath178 in the mass evolution equation for @xmath18 and twice with a coefficient equal to one in the mass evolution equations for @xmath179 and @xmath180 . the conserved system mass is thus given by @xmath181 .",
    "numerical investigations show that system   tends to equipartition or the growth - decay equilibrium .",
    "the factors that determine the equilibrium involve the initial mass distribution and the activation parameter .",
    "if we assume that @xmath182 for all @xmath171 , eq .",
    "is approximated by the following    @xmath183    if the grains are at distance @xmath184 from each other , the right hand side of the above equation is a discrete approximation of the continuum limit @xmath185 .",
    "hence , eq .   tends to the diffusion equation @xmath186 . if @xmath187 and @xmath188 for all @xmath171 , the evolution is diffusive regardless of the specific initial distribution @xmath175 .",
    "the relaxation of the @xmath7-grain system is in general slower than that of the two - grain system due to the many degrees of freedom involved .",
    "the reason is that equilibrium is reached only if the mass transfer rates simultaneously vanish for all the grains .",
    "this condition is established if all the masses converge to the same value , if the growth - decay process leads to a grain mass distribution that practically traps the system on the separation nullclines , or if the diffusion is trapped at the separation nullcline .",
    "we illustrate the evolution of a system containing @xmath189 grains in fig .",
    "[ fig : u - evol ] for four different values of @xmath190 $ ] , assuming that the initial grain masses are drawn from a uniform distribution over the interval @xmath191 $ ] .",
    "this is equivalent to @xmath192 and an initial grain mass distribution in @xmath193 $ ] . for @xmath194 and @xmath192 the system tends to the equipartition equilibrium . at @xmath195 mass fluctuations",
    "survive , but the grains have approached @xmath142 . on the other hand , for @xmath196 and @xmath197 the system is in the growth - decay regime .",
    "the relaxation is considerably slower , and thus we extend the final time to @xmath198 .",
    "many grains quickly tend to zero mass ( hence the dark shading of the @xmath199 plane ) , whereas a smaller number of grains ( fewer than 100 ) increase their mass ; the mass evolution of these grains is shown by the thin lines rising above the background in figs .",
    "[ fig : u - evol - c]-[fig : u - evol - d ] .",
    "the evolution is not always monotonic , since there are grains that first increase their mass and then tend to zero ( lines that bend toward the @xmath199 plane in the plots ) .",
    "in addition , a small number of grains undergo different growth phases marked by sudden slope changes .",
    "the patterns described above that pertain to the equilibrium distribution are confirmed by comparing the histograms of the initial and final mass distributions shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : u - histo ] .",
    "the same qualitative patterns are obtained if we use a lognormal initial mass distribution ( not shown ) . in the lognormal case ,",
    "the growth - decay regime is established at @xmath192 .",
    "this is due to the fact that the equilibrium is determined by both @xmath10 and the magnitude of the grain masses .",
    "the lognormal distribution is broader than the @xmath200 distribution , and thus includes some higher mass values which drive the system into the growth - decay regime at lower @xmath10 .",
    "if @xmath10 is kept in the arrhenius factor the system involves a redundant degree of freedom as discussed above .",
    "we can use @xmath10 , however , as a control parameter to investigate the impact of temperature on the evolution of the system .",
    "we can then normalize the grain masses , e.g. , by their mean value , to reduce the number of parameters by one . as a special case",
    ", we can set @xmath201 and replace @xmath202 with @xmath18 . with this normalization",
    ", it holds that @xmath203 for all @xmath70 .",
    "thus , the masses can be viewed as probabilities for different states , and eq .",
    "becomes a _ master equation_.",
    "we investigated a nonlinear system of ordinary differential equations that describes mass exchange between grains .",
    "the exchange is governed by arrhenius - type transition rates with an activation energy that depends linearly on grain mass .",
    "we identified the equilibrium states of a two - grain system which are defined by the linear equipartition nullcline and the curvilinear mass separation nullcline .",
    "the system exhibits diffusive and growth - decay regimes . in the diffusive regime ,",
    "the equilibrium state of the system is equipartition unless the diffusive process is arrested at the separation nullcline ; in this case the mass transfer stops before the two masses are equalized . in the growth - decay regime , the larger grain grows at the expense of the smaller grain that shrinks ; the mass transfer is again stopped at the separation nullcline .",
    "we derived linearized approximations which are valid in parts of the diffusive ( `` high temperature '' ) and growth - decay ( `` low temperature '' ) regimes respectively .",
    "the linear approximations provide a qualitative understanding of the system which is more accurate in the diffusive regime .",
    "the linear approximations , however , miss the trapping by the separation nullcline .",
    "we also constructed the equilibrium phase diagram of the model based on the long - time mass difference between the grains obtained by numerical solutions of the system  .",
    "numerical solutions of a two - grain system with additive white noise in the mass transfer rates reveal that the equilibrium states fluctuate around the deterministic equilibrium points .",
    "the noise has significant impact if the initial conditions are close to the equipartition nullcline and in the growth - decay regime . in this case",
    "the noise can reverse the direction of mass growth from the bigger to the smaller grain .",
    "we also analyzed an @xmath7-grain system with periodic boundary conditions using numerical solutions based on the fourth - order runge - kutta method .",
    "we use a variable @xmath10 and initial masses drawn from the @xmath200 distribution .",
    "we established that diffusive and growth - decay regimes also exist ; the former are obtained for lower values of @xmath10 and the latter for higher values .",
    "these regimes exhibit richer patterns of grain mass evolution than the respective two - grain - system regimes and will be further investigated in further research .    based on the analysis above , we suggest that the growth - decay regime is related to abnormal grain growth that is observed in sintering and leads to grain coarsening .",
    "the behavior of many - grain systems as well as grain coalescence , which are important for sintering applications , are being investigated in ongoing research by our group .",
    "finally , our model could be useful as a component of kinetic models of wealth exchange  @xcite . in this context , the activation parameter is proportional to the average wealth of the agents ( grains ) and to increased ability for exchanges ( lower @xmath10 ) , whereas mass conservation corresponds to total wealth conservation  @xcite .",
    "the existence of two distinct regimes , one corresponding to diffusion of wealth among the agents and the other to wealth accumulation by few agents , is an intriguing feature of the model .",
    "this work has been funded by the project _ namco : development of high performance alumina matrix nanostructured composites_. namco is implemented under the `` thalis '' action of the operational programme `` education and lifelong learning '' and is co - funded by the european social fund and national resources .",
