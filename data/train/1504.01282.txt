    "since its first successful experimental realization @xcite , graphene , an one - atom thick layer of carbon atoms arranged in a honeycomb lattice , has attracted a great deal of attention .",
    "such interest is due to its unusual physical properties and potential application @xcite .",
    "the charge carriers in graphene , for instance , have an extremely high mobility and can be easily controlled by applying a gate voltage , which makes graphene a promising material for the fabrication of electronic devices . controlling the energy band structure of graphene",
    "can help its application in electronics .",
    "it can be done , for instance , by applying and external periodic potential , _",
    "i. e. _ , a superlattice .",
    "the periodic potential structure in graphene can be generated by different methods , such as electrostatic potentials @xcite , magnetic barriers @xcite or the combination of both @xcite . despite the difficulty of fabricating graphene under nanoscale periodic potentials , it was already realized experimentally @xcite .",
    "although significant advances have been made in the understanding of how a periodic potential influences the electronic properties of graphene , very little further attention appears to have been given to the effects of a periodic modulation of the fermi velocity in graphene superlattices @xcite .    in our previous work @xcite",
    ", we have found that it is possible to control the energy gap of graphene with fermi velocity engineering when there is an energy gap modulation .",
    "it happens because the change of the fermi velocity in a region of graphene is equivalent to changing the width of this region and keeping the fermi velocity unchanged , provided that the time taken to charge carriers cross the region is the same .",
    "so , at the same way that it is possible to tune the energy gap of graphene controlling the width of two regions with different energy gap , it is possible to do the same changing the fermi velocity .",
    "however , as will be shown here , this equivalence is related only with the energy gap , and does not remain for other electronic properties of graphene . in this paper",
    "we investigate the electronic structure of a graphene superlattice with a periodic modulation of the fermi velocity and energy gap . including the periodic potential , extra dirac points appear .",
    "we show that the fermi velocity affects the extra dirac points in a different way of changing the widths of the regions , being possible to control the behavior of the extra dirac points in different ways .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "2 we solve the dirac - like equation for graphne with a position dependent fermi velocity , energy gap and electrostatic potential and find the dispersion relation .",
    "we also discuss how to obtain such a system experimentally . in sec .",
    "3 we analyze the electronic structure in two different cases . first we consider the fermi velocity constant and investigate the electronic structure with a unequal well and barrier widths .",
    "then , we consider a fermi velocity modulation and an equal well and barrier widths .",
    "we compare these two cases and show that they are not equivalent . in sec .",
    "4 the paper is summarized and concluded .",
    "the effective two - dimentional dirac hamiltonian for a graphene superlattice with a position dependent energy gap and fermi velocity is written as @xmath0 where @xmath1 is an external periodic potential , @xmath2 is the energy gap , @xmath3 are the pauli matrices acting on the _ pseudospin _ related to the two graphene sublattices , @xmath4 is the @xmath5 unitary matrix and @xmath6 is the fermi velocity .",
    "the first term on the hamiltonian above is modified in relation to the usual dirac operator for graphene in order to have a hermitian operator @xcite .",
    "we are considering that the fermi velocity , the energy gap and the potential change only in the @xmath7 direction . a schematic diagram is shown in fig . [ graphene ] .",
    "the graphene is deposited on a heterostructured substrate composed by two different materials , which can open different energy gaps in different regions of the graphene sheet that will be denoted by @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the modulation of the fermi velocity can be obtained in graphene by placing metallic planes close to the graphene sheet , which will turn electron - electron interactions weaker and , consequently , modify the fermi velocity @xcite . the fermi velocity in each region",
    "will be denoted by @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the electrostatic potential for the two regions will be denoted by @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the period of the system is @xmath14 .",

    "note that at @xmath19 and @xmath20 we recover the linear dispersion relation of a graphene sheet .",
    "for the sake of comparison , in this section we will investigate the electronic structure of two special cases .",
    "first , we will consider a constant fermi velocity and analyze the effects of an unequal well and barrier widths .",
    "then , we will consider an equal well and barrier widths and see the influence of the fermi velocity modulation on the electronic structure of the graphene superlattice . in",
    "what follows , we will consider a constant period of the graphene superlattice @xmath21 nm and we shall concentrate our discussion on the valence and conductance minibands only , assuming the fermi level to be in between at any value of @xmath22 .      in this section we will analyze the effects of an unequal well and barrier widths and we will consider @xmath23 . in fig .",

    "so , the minibands have a lens - like shape .",
    "it can be seen also that when the well and barrier widths are equal , the electron and hole minibands are symmetric related to @xmath43 .",

    "one can conclude that at the contact points , where there is an intersection of the bands , the gradient ( jacobian ) of the dispersion relation ( [ dispersion ] ) should be zero .",
    "it happens only if @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "so , one can write @xmath57 and @xmath58 where @xmath59 is an integer different from zero . subtracting ( [ kb ] ) from ( [ ka ] ) , one gets @xmath60 which gives the values of @xmath61 where there are contact points . replacing the equation above in eq .",
