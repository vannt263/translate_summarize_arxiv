    "the bose - einstein condensation in ultracold neutral atomic systems  @xcite is a macroscopic quantum phenomenon of indistinguishable bosonic particles .",
    "the description of the bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) based on the concept of a spontaneous breakdown of symmetry is a success of quantum field theory .",
    "studies of the properties of bec by means of quantum field theory will bring us a deeper understanding of quantum physics .",
    "the instability of bec is an interesting and challenging subject of the quantum field theoretical study . experimentally the unstable phenomena belonging to the dynamical instability have been observed , such as becs with quantized vortices  @xcite , in optical lattice  @xcite and with solitons  @xcite .",
    "the dynamical instability originates from quantum fluctuations and should be distinguished from the landau one which is due to energy dissipation .",
    "theoretically the dynamical instability is characterized by the existence of complex eigenvalues in the bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) equations  @xcite which are obtained from linearizing the time - dependent gross - pitaevskii ( tdgp ) equation  @xcite .",
    "the field operators describing excitation modes are expanded in the complete set of the bdg eigenfunctions .",
    "our previous work  @xcite has revealed that the emergence of complex eigenvalue for the excitation mode with non - zero real part of eigenvalue is attributed to the degeneracy between a positive - norm eigenfunction and a negative - norm one .    as a consequence of spontaneous breakdown of symmetry and according to the nambu - goldstone theorem  @xcite",
    ", there must be eigenfunctions of the bdg equations belonging to zero eigenvalues , called the zero modes .",
    "these zero modes play such a crucial role that they create and retain the ordered states corresponding to the broken symmetries .",
    "the simple bec is interpreted as a spontaneous breakdown of the u(1 ) global gauge symmetry , and there appears the zero mode , called the @xmath0-zero mode .",
    "furthermore an additional symmetry may be broken spontaneously , and then one has another zero mode .",
    "for example , the existence of a dark soliton in bec implies the spontaneous breakdown of the translational symmetry for an originally homogeneous system , and there appears the zero mode related to the translational symmetry , called the @xmath1-zero mode .",
    "when the bdg equations are under consideration , it is necessary to introduce an additional adjoint mode corresponding to each zero one to make the complete set of the bdg eigenfunctions  @xcite .",
    "although pairs of zero and adjoint modes are ignored in many theoretical studies , mainly because of their infrared singular properties , we include them in our formulation of this paper . actually the pair of the @xmath0-zero mode and its adjoint one plays an essential role in the splitting process of a highly quantized vortex  @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to explore possible complex modes originating from zero modes .",
    "first , as a general formulation , we consider a bec system with an arbitrary number of zero modes and apply an external perturbation potential which breaks some of original symmetries explicitly .",
    "obviously the zero modes associated with the symmetries which the external potential breaks turn into non - zero ones . the relevant orders are affected substantially in general , and in some cases the ordered state may collapse rapidly .",
    "thus what the zero modes change into when the external perturbation potential is applied is a crucial question .",
    "we therefore formulate the bdg equations on the first order perturbation with respect to the external potential and derive the eigen equations projected out on the zero and adjoint modes , which determine new eigenvalues of the originally zero and adjoint modes . for this",
    "it is important to notice the singular behaviors of the zero modes in the naive perturbation expansion .",
    "we propose a consistent treatment to avoid the singularity .",
    "this new treatment works well , and it turns out that the eigenvalues can become pure imaginary .",
    "the result implies that a new type of dynamical instability stemming from the zero mode occurs .",
    "next , as an application of the above general formulation , we consider a one - dimensional homogeneous bec system with a stationary dark soliton for which we have the @xmath0- and @xmath1-zero modes and their adjoint ones , and analyze changes of the @xmath1-zero mode and its adjoint one when two types of external @xmath1-dependent perturbation potentials are applied .",
    "we show from analytical calculations that they can turn into two pure imaginary modes for some parameter region of the perturbation potentials , which means that the system , the soliton in this case , is dynamically unstable",
    ". then numerical solutions of the tdgp equation show that the soliton moves substantially even for an infinitesimal fluctuation of the center of the soliton .",
    "this gives the dynamical instability stemming from the zero and adjoint modes which has been unknown , and a new insight into zero modes .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : the general formulation of the bdg equations and their properties are reviewed briefly in sect .",
    "ii . in sect .",
    "iii , we develop a perturbative expansion for a general bec system under a small external potential , and derive the eigen equations closed to the zero and adjoint mode sector . in sect .",
    "iv , we consider a one - dimensional homogeneous bec system with a dark soliton as an example of our formulation since it allows us to obtain analytical expressions , and show that the @xmath1-zero and its adjoint modes turn into two pure imaginary modes under particular perturbation potentials .",
    "section  v is devoted to summary and concluding remarks .",
    "for the purpose of our formulations later , a brief review on the eigenstates of the bdg equations and the zero modes is given in this section .",
    "the dynamical evolution of the condensate is described by the tdgp equation , @xmath2 here @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the external potential , the mass of a neutral atom and the coupling constant , respectively . throughout this paper , we set @xmath6 to unity .",
    "the spatial integration of the density of the condensate @xmath7 is the total number of condensate @xmath8 .",
    "the stationary state of the condensate , denoted by @xmath9 , obeys the stationary gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation , @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the chemical potential .    in order to analyze the stability of the condensate",
    ", we consider a small fluctuation from the stationary condensate state , @xmath12 , as @xmath13e^{-i\\mu t}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    within the approximation linear with respect to @xmath14 , the amplitudes @xmath15 and @xmath16 obey the following equations which are called the bdg equations : @xmath17 here we have introduced the doublet notation , @xmath18 where @xmath19 since the matrix @xmath20 is a non - hermitian operator in general , the eigenvalue @xmath21 can be complex . if any eigenvalue is complex , we can judge that the stationary condensate is dynamically unstable .",
    "the properties of the matrix @xmath20 and the bdg eigenfunctions are summarized according to refs .",
    "@xcite : @xmath22 with the pauli s @xmath23-th matrix @xmath24 .",
    "because of these symmetric properties , the bdg eigenfunctions have the following features .",
    "( i ) the eigenfunctions are orthogonal to each other under the indefinite inner product , @xmath25 for two doublets , @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "( ii ) if @xmath28 is an eigenfunction belonging to either real or pure imaginary eigenvalue @xmath29 ( either @xmath30 \\not= 0,\\ \\mathrm{im}[\\omega ] = 0 $ ] or @xmath30 = 0,\\ \\mathrm{im}[\\omega ] \\not= 0 $ ] ) , the eigenfunction belonging to @xmath31 , @xmath32 for the former or @xmath33 for the latter , always emerges  @xcite .",
    "thus the eigenfunctions belonging to real or pure imaginary eigenvalues form pairs .",
    "otherwise , when @xmath28 is an eigenfunction belonging to a complex eigenvalue @xmath29 ( @xmath30 \\not= 0,\\ \\mathrm{im}[\\omega]\\not= 0 $ ] ) , it and the eigenfunctions @xmath34 and @xmath35 belonging to @xmath36 and @xmath31 , respectively , make a quartet .",
    "( iii ) a squared norm , defined by @xmath37 , is not restricted to be positive , but can also be negative or zero . when @xmath28 is an eigenfunction belonging to a real eigenvalue , the squared norm is normalized to @xmath38 .",
    "otherwise , when @xmath28 is an eigenfunction belonging to a complex eigenvalue including a pure imaginary one , the squared norm becomes zero . in this case",
    ", @xmath28 is `` normalized '' as @xmath39 .    finally , we emphasize that the bdg equations have eigenfunctions belonging to zero eigenvalues  @xcite , @xmath40 , corresponding to each spontaneously broken symmetry labeled by @xmath23 .",
    "for example , since the bec system spontaneously breaks the u(1 ) global gauge symmetry , the bdg equations always have the following zero eigenfunction  @xcite : @xmath41 because the zero modes are orthogonal to all the eigenfunctions including themselves , the simple set of the bdg eigenfunctions is not complete .",
    "it is pointed out in refs .",
    "@xcite that the adjoint modes , @xmath42 , which are defined by @xmath43 and are nonorthogonal to the corresponding zero modes , must be included for the completeness of the set of bdg eigenfunctions . here",
    "@xmath44 is the normalization constant to have @xmath45 .",
    "we add a potential @xmath46 with a sufficiently small parameter @xmath47 to @xmath48 in eq .",
    "( [ gp ] ) , so that the original translational symmetry is broken explicitly .",
    "then the order parameter and chemical potential are expanded in the perturbation series , @xmath49    let @xmath50 stand for the bdg eigenfunction which converges to a linear combination of @xmath40 in the unperturbed limit @xmath51 , @xmath52 where the eigenvalue @xmath53 approaches to 0 as @xmath51 . in order to solve these equations perturbatively , we develop our calculations as follows : first we substitute eqs .",
    "( [ pertxi ] ) and ( [ pertmu ] ) into the bdg @xmath20-matrix , @xmath54 where @xmath55 the equation for @xmath56 and @xmath57 is explicitly @xmath58 for the unperturbed non - zero real eigenvalue , the perturbed eigenfunction can be expressed in a naive integer power expansion of @xmath47 , which was demonstrated in ref .",
    "in contrast , we immediately notice that for the unperturbed zero eigenvalue the perturbed eigenfunction can not be expanded in the same manner .",
    "that is seen from the fact that the squared norm of @xmath59 belonging to non - zero real @xmath53 is singular with respect to @xmath47 .",
    "actually it is @xmath60 or @xmath61 at @xmath62 , and @xmath63 at @xmath64 .",
    "the above singular property with respect to @xmath47 demands a new formulation of the problem . our new approach to evade the singularity is that without using a power expansion of @xmath47 , we simply expand @xmath59 in the complete set of the zero - th order bdg eigenfunctions including the adjoint modes as @xmath65 where  ex . \" and  z.m .",
    "\" mean the summations over the excitation and zero modes , respectively .",
    "projecting @xmath59 on @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath42 and @xmath40 , respectively , we can confirm @xmath68 and obtain new eigen equations within the zero mode sector @xmath69 where @xmath70 for @xmath71 . since the matrix in eqs .",
    "( [ secular_1 ] ) and ( [ secular_2 ] ) are generally non - hermitian , the eigenvalue @xmath72 can be complex .",
    "it turns out from the symmetric property of the matrix @xmath73 that @xmath74 and @xmath75 are real and that @xmath76 is pure imaginary .",
    "furthermore , it is easy to check that @xmath77 , and , therefore , @xmath78 which is natural since the external potential does not break the u(1 ) gauge symmetry .",
    "in this section , the formulation in the previous sections is applied to a concrete system .",
    "our model system is a one - dimensional homogeneous one ( thus @xmath79 ) with a repulsive interaction @xmath80 .",
    "we consider a situation with a single dark soliton , and the system acquires the zero mode corresponding to a spontaneous symmetry breakdown of the translation other than that corresponding to a spontaneous breakdown of the u(1 ) gauge symmetry .",
    "then we perturb the system by @xmath81 .    in order to evaluate the eigenvalues and",
    "eigenfunctions originated from zero modes under the perturbation potential , we deal with a single dark soliton .",
    "the dark soliton solution can be obtained by solving the gp equation under the boundary conditions of @xmath82 and @xmath83 : @xmath84 here @xmath85 is a bulk density of the condensate and @xmath86 the bdg equations have the following two zero modes @xmath87 their adjoint modes and the constants @xmath44 are @xmath88    we apply an external perturbation potential @xmath89 to the system , breaking the translational symmetry explicitly but preserving the @xmath90 gauge one . in this situation , the matrix eigen equation in eqs .",
    "( [ secular_1 ] ) and ( [ secular_2 ] ) is reduced to the @xmath91-matrix one involving only the @xmath1-zero and its adjoint modes , @xmath92 solving this matrix eigen equation , we obtain @xmath93 because @xmath94 is always negative , the sign of @xmath95 which depends on the perturbation potential determines whether @xmath96 is real or pure imaginary .    when @xmath96 are real , the corresponding eigenfunctions are @xmath97 where the labels @xmath98 indicate the signs of @xmath96 .",
    "note that the squared norms of these eigenfunctions should be normalized as either @xmath60 or @xmath61 , and that they are  anomalous \" modes , whose squared norms have opposite signs to their eigenvalues , explicitly @xmath99 .",
    "the presence of  anomalous \" modes is well known in the analysis of solitons with harmonic  @xcite and double well potentials  @xcite , and gives rise to the landau instability .",
    "when @xmath96 are pure imaginary , the corresponding eigenfunctions are @xmath100 here the orthonormalization conditions are @xmath101 and @xmath102 according to the general property of eigenfunctions belonging to complex eigenvalues  @xcite .    since @xmath103 is in order of @xmath104 , the order of the first terms in eqs .",
    "( [ eigenfunction1 ] ) ,  ( [ eigenfunction2 ] ) and  ( [ eigenfunction3 ] ) is @xmath105 , and that of the second terms is @xmath106 .",
    "so the profiles of all these eigenfunctions are quite similar to that of the @xmath1-zero mode eigenfunction , and are called the  ghost \" of the zero mode in ref .",
    "the divergences of the first terms in the limit @xmath51 reflect the infrared singularity of the zero modes .",
    "we note that the coefficients of the first and second terms in eqs .",

    "( [ expansion ] ) ) are not of integer power of @xmath47 , as it has been pointed out before .    in order to see the implication of the emergence of the pure imaginary eigenvalues at the classical level ,",
    "we suppose the initial condition that the dark soliton is prepared at @xmath109 and its center is displaced by an infinitesimal distance @xmath110 at @xmath111 , namely @xmath112 . in the leading order of @xmath47 , @xmath113",

    "e^{|{\\mathrm{im}}[\\delta \\omega^{{\\varepsilon}}_{0,x}]| t}\\right ) \\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this consideration implies that when the pure imaginary modes arise from the @xmath1-zero and its adjoint modes , the dark soliton starts to move .",
    "this is true however small the symmetry breaking potential @xmath120 may be , and therefore one can say that the system is dynamically unstable in the sense that the original stable dark soliton can not be sustained although it does not collapse immediately .    in the next two subsections , we concretely consider two types of perturbation potential , that is , the delta function type and the oscillating one , for both the gp equation ( [ gp_1 ] ) can be solved analytically .      let us consider the delta function type potential at the center of soliton : @xmath121 . then the gp equation is solved exactly as @xmath122 this means that @xmath123 and @xmath124 , and @xmath125 thus the eigenvalues @xmath96 are pure imaginary for any positive @xmath126 . as stated above",
    ", this result indicates that the system is dynamically unstable , namely the dark soliton moves away .    for comparison and",
    "in order to avoid the singularity of the delta function , we perform numerical calculations for the model with a perturbation gaussian potential @xmath127 with a real parameter @xmath128 which becomes @xmath129 as @xmath130 .",
    "figure  [ fig : bdg_deltatype ] shows the numerical results of the eigenvalues eq .",
    "( [ eigenvalue of x ] ) for @xmath131 .        in fig .",
    "[ fig : tdgp_deltatype ] , we draw a snapshot of the temporal evolution of the soliton , obtained by solving the tdgp equation  ( [ tdgp ] ) for @xmath131 .",
    "it is seen during the time evolution that the condensate is distorted by the potential @xmath131 in its vicinity and that accordingly the displacement of the soliton is enhanced .",

    "the shape of this potential is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : perturbation potential ] . as the parameter @xmath133 increases , the potential height at @xmath109 where the center of the stationary soliton is initially placed becomes lower .",
    "the reason why the potential in eq .",
    "( [ oscillatingtypepotential ] ) is taken is that one can obtain an analytical solution of the first order gp equation , which is @xmath134 then @xmath135 is calculated as @xmath136 where @xmath137 , giving the eigenvalue @xmath96 according to eq .",
    "( [ eigenvalue of x ] ) .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bdg_oscillatingtype ] .",
    "there is a critical value of @xmath133 , denoted by @xmath138 , for which @xmath139 .",
    "as @xmath135 is negative for @xmath140 and positive for @xmath141 , eq .",
    "( [ eigenvalue of x ] ) yields real @xmath96 for @xmath140 and pure imaginary one for @xmath142 , as is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bdg_oscillatingtype ] . note that the sign of @xmath135 depends on @xmath133 but not on @xmath143 , so @xmath144 is independent of @xmath145 .",
    "thus this model exhibits the transition between real and pure imaginary eigenvalues as the parameter @xmath133 changes continuously .",
    "similarly as in the previous subsection , it can be checked from the numerical calculation of the tdgp equation that in the region of pure imaginary @xmath96 the dark soliton , displaced very slightly from the center initially , starts to move , and oscillates between the two peaks of the potential , that is , the peak at the center and that next to the center .",
    "in this paper , treating the zero modes for the condensate system properly from the viewpoint of quantum field theory , we have studied possible dynamical instability stemming from the zero modes , and have found eigenfunctions with pure imaginary eigenvalues under a symmetry breaking external perturbation potential . the pure imaginary modes are non - oscillatory , and should cause some exponential blowup of small fluctuation or dynamical instability in accordance with the general arguments of complex modes .    as examples ,",
    "two one - dimensional homogeneous systems with a dark soliton under perturbation potentials breaking the translational symmetry have been considered . without the perturbation potentials",
    "there appears the @xmath1-zero mode which is the nambu - goldstone one associated with a spontaneous breakdown of the translational symmetry .",
    "it is shown that as a result of applying the symmetry breaking potentials it and its adjoint mode can turn into two pure imaginary modes in some cases . in our case of the soliton ,",
    "the relevant transformation is a translation and the dynamical instability manifests itself such that the center of the soliton moves considerably for its small fluctuation .",
    "we have confirmed this , using two types of the perturbation potentials for which analytic solutions are available .",
    "the emergence of the pure imaginary modes stemming from the zero modes provides us with a new scenario of that of the complex modes , other than the degeneracy between excitation modes  @xcite .",
    "although we treat only single - component becs for simplicity in this paper , the extension to multi - component bec  @xcite is straightforward .",
    "the arguments about the instability in this paper extend only to the c - number solution of the tdgp equation , but not to quantum fluctuations generated by pure imaginary or complex excitation modes .",
    "it is desirable to take account of the quantum nature of the pure imaginary modes properly . to do this",
    ", we need to resolve the difficulty that the unperturbed hamiltonian for the pure imaginary mode , @xmath146 is not diagonalized and therefore a unique vacuum is not known @xcite .",
    "explicitly @xmath146 for the one - dimensional soliton model under a symmetry breaking perturbation is given by @xmath147 with the commutation relations for the operators @xmath148 and @xmath149 , @xmath150=1 $ ] and @xmath151=[b , b^\\dagger]=[a , b]=0 $ ] .",
    "the diagonalization problem for general complex modes is still open .    in our future work",
