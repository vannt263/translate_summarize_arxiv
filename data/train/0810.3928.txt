    "any atom that has a nuclear spin @xmath3 has a nuclear electric quadrupole moment , whose interactions with electric field gradients can cause shifts of the nuclear magnetic energy levels .",
    "there is a large body of literature on the interactions of nuclear quadrupole moments with electric field gradients . as far back as the 1950s",
    ", studies were performed in crystals both in the regime where the nuclear quadrupole interaction caused weak perturbations to the nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) spectra @xcite , as well as in the pure nuclear quadrupole resonance ( nqr ) regime , where little or no zeeman interaction was present @xcite .",
    "solutions for the transition energies between nuclear spin sublevels were found for both regimes by use of perturbation theory ( for a review , see @xcite ) by aligning the quantization axis along the principal axis of the electric field gradient tensor in the nqr regime and along the axis of the magnetic field in the nmr regime . as with these first experiments ,",
    "most nqr studies have either been distinctly in either the nqr or the nmr regimes . to our knowledge , prior to our work reported here , the transformation of the nqr spectra from the nqr to the nmr regimes had not been observed experimentally .    cohen - tannoudji first suggested that in addition to arising from electric field gradients from ionic bonds in a crystal , quadrupolar coupling could occur between nuclei and electrical field gradients present at the nucleus during wall collisions for atoms in vapor cells @xcite .",
    "since then , nuclear quadrupole resonances in vapor cells have been studied for many systems including @xmath4 @xmath5hg @xcite , @xmath6 @xmath7kr @xcite , @xmath4 @xmath1xe @xcite , and @xmath4 @xmath8ne @xcite .",
    "much of this work has been of basic interest from a fundamental physics standpoint @xcite and for tests of fundamental symmetries @xcite .",
    "there have also been proposals for using these systems for the practical application of rotation sensing @xcite .",
    "changes to the nqr shifts in the crossover regime could lead to systematic errors in precision measurements and offsets in rotation sensors .    for much of the nqr work that has been performed in vapor cells ,",
    "the nqr lines were not clearly resolved and the nqr splitting caused a slow beating or a nonexponential decay of the nuclear polarization @xcite .",
    "the beat frequencies depended on the orientation of the cell symmetry axis in the magnetic field , and went to zero at the magic angle of @xmath9 @xcite , which indicated that the axis of symmetry of the electric field gradient was aligned along the cell symmetry axis .    in a series of papers from happer s group at princeton @xcite , wu et al . saw much stronger interactions such that the nqr lines could be clearly resolved by using highly asymmetric cells .",
    "they performed a detailed perturbation - theory solution for the nqr shift in the nmr regime , accounting for pressure - dependent diffusion and cell shape , and formulated the results to give a microscopic description of the interaction @xcite . ignoring complications from diffusion",
    ", they expressed the nqr shifts for the @xmath10 and @xmath11 coherences as @xmath12   ~ ,   \\label{eq1}\\ ] ] which is an integration of the nuclear quadrupole interaction over the cell walls . here",
    "@xmath13 is the atom velocity , @xmath14 is the mean twist angle per wall adhesion , @xmath15 is the cell surface area , @xmath16 is the cell volume , @xmath17 is the nuclear spin , and @xmath18 is the angle between the local surface normal ( directed out of the cell ) and the magnetic field .",
    "here we put @xmath19 within the integral to allow for the possibility that the cell walls are of different materials . integrating eq .",
    "[ eq1 ] for a cylindrical cell gives @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the angle between the cell symmetry axis and the direction of the magnetic field and @xmath22 .",
    "@xmath23 is proportional to the atom velocity , the surface to volume ratio of the cell , and an asymmetry parameter , @xmath24 , which goes to zero when the cell height and diameter are equal .",
    "wu et al . verified their theory with detailed experiments and determined @xmath25 for pyrex @xcite .",
    "experiments later performed by butscher et al .",
    "@xcite revealed similar behavior .",
    "all of the experiments described so far were performed at magnetic fields high enough that the nuclear quadrupole interaction was well described as a perturbation to the magnetic larmor resonances .",
    "appelt et al . performed studies on @xmath1xe in the limit of zero applied magnetic field and measured deviations from berry s adiabatic phase under rotation @xcite .",
    "they solved the @xmath4 hamiltonian by including terms for the nqr interaction and spatial rotations and showed that mixing of the nuclear spin sublevels through rotation makes all six transitions between nuclear sublevels allowed ( @xmath26 = 1 , 2 , and 3 ) .",
    "all of this work was either distinctly in the nmr @xcite or the nqr @xcite regime .",
    "here we bridged the two regimes by continuously tracing the transformation from the pure nqr regime to the quadrupole - perturbed zeeman regime .",
    "we achieved a large nqr splitting not by using geometrically asymmetric cells as wu et al .",
    "@xcite did , but by using a 1  mm@xmath2 cubic cell with walls of different materials .",
    "a cubic charge distribution would not ordinarily cause an nqr splitting @xcite , but the microscopic surface interactions with the different wall materials lower the symmetry of the system .",
    "the small cell size enhances the nqr splitting because the shifts are proportional to the surface to volume ratio .",
    "the enhancement of the nqr shift from the cell wall materials is a new observation that gives one an additional adjustable parameter to tune the electric field gradient and the nqr interaction in vapor cells . as a confirmation that the complex spectra that we observe are expected , we compare the transformation of the resonance lines to theoretical models and find excellent agreement .",
