    "the klein - gordon equation is a wave type of equation for a scalar field which we propose as a model for dark matter . while this geometric motivation is new , modeling dark matter with a scalar field satisfying the klein - gordon equation is not ( see @xcite for a survey of scalar field dark matter and boson stars ) .",

    "hence , when the scalar field is zero , the connection is the levi - civita connection .",
    "more generally , there is a formula for the connection on the tangent bundle of the spacetime in terms of the metric and the scalar field , which is equation [ connectionformula ] in the appendices",
    ".    we must admit that we do not have a definitive idea of how the connection manifests itself physically , other than gravitationally , which is made explicit in the einstein - klein - gordon equations .",
    "for example , since light rays follow null geodesics , and the geodesic equation involves the connection , it may be possible that light rays are affected by the connection in addition to the metric",
    ". however , one can also think of light rays as being along paths which are critical points of the geodesic energy functional which does not involve the connection .",
    "this latter view of null geodesics guarantees that these curves , once null , stay null .",

    "we will simply study the huge gravitational impact that the connection , through the scalar field @xmath25 , has in our theory .    at this point an aside is warranted .",
    "we have called equation [ eqn : kg ] the klein - gordon equation , which it is , except that the constant in the equation is not called mass as is usual , nor is planck s constant present .",
    "hence , some might want to call the above equation a modified klein - gordon equation to be precise .",

    "we have `` coincidentally '' derived an equation which also comes up in quantum mechanics .",
    "of course this is actually not much of a coincidence , since the klein - gordon equation is one of the simplest relativistic equations which one could consider .",
    "on the other hand , this is where our discussion intersects with the fascinating works of many others who have studied `` scalar field dark matter '' and `` boson stars . '' in the boson star case , the motivation is quantum mechanical , so the above scalar field @xmath25 is supposed to represent the overall wave function for a very large number of very tiny bosons with masses on the order of @xmath31 ev ( see @xcite for a survey ) .",
    "we relate our constant @xmath27 to the mass of the klein - gordon equation by noting that the compton wavelength in both cases is @xmath32 if we take @xmath33 , or equivalently , @xmath34 .",
    "these other motivations are interesting as well but should be distinguished from the purely geometric motivations provided in this paper .",
    "for example , in our context it seems most natural to define @xmath25 to be real valued , and we do not mean to suggest an interpretation of @xmath25 as a probability density . at the same time",
    ", we refer the reader to the survey article @xcite as well as the many works cited in that survey for many excellent discussions and ideas , most of which apply to this work here also , insofar as they apply to the einstein - klein - gordon equations with a cosmological constant . similarly , the results of this paper , from this point on , apply to boson stars and these other theories as well .",
    "in this section we discuss the compatibility of this model for dark matter with the @xmath0 ( lambda cold dark matter ) model of the universe @xcite . as our theory only hopes to explain dark matter and dark energy , we artificially `` add in '' the remaining quantum mechanical particles and electromagnetic radiation .",
    "equivalently , in this section we mean to consider the standard @xmath0 model , but with our scalar field model for dark matter ( which satisfies the klein - gordon equation ) instead of the traditional wimp ( weakly interacting massive particles ) model",
    ".    fortunately for us , much analysis of the cosmological features of a scalar field model of dark matter has already been done .",
    "our exact case is treated in @xcite , referred to in that paper and elsewhere as the @xmath35 case ( which gives rise to the einstein - klein - gordon equations ) .",
    "more general scalar field potentials are considered in that paper as well as @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , but these potentials , when they are even functions with positive second derivative at zero , are equivalent to the @xmath36 potential in the low field limit .    in @xcite ( see also @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , the authors explain that scalar field dark matter has the same cosmology as the the standard cdm model with wimp dark matter particles , with the main differences only becoming apparent on the scale of galaxies .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for a related discussion where the large scale behavior of the einstein - klein - gordon equations is compared to the evolution of collisionless matter .",
    "it would seem reasonable that there are many more interesting problems to study in these areas , but the author is not expert enough to comment further .",
    "furthermore , scalar field dark matter has some advantages over the wimp model .",
    "scalar field dark matter gives a nearly flat density of dark matter in the centers of galaxies @xcite , @xcite , as opposed to a cusp of density as predicted by the wimp model , which has not been observed .",
    "also , numerical simulations show that wimps have a tendency to clump forming structures smaller than those observed , the smallest observations being dwarf galaxies @xcite .",
    "scalar field dark matter , on the other hand , has a natural length scale defined by our fundamental constant @xmath37 . for the group velocities of scalar field dark matter waves to be much less than the speed of light in order to be able to form gravitationally bound systems , the wavelengths of our solutions",
    "must be much larger than @xmath37 .",
    "finally , scalar field dark matter is automatically cold , sufficiently far after the big bang , assuming the universe is homogeneous and isotropic . in general terms",
    ", the reason for this is the wave nature of the scalar field .",
    "said another way , when two solutions to the einstein - klein - gordon equation are added to one another , their stress - energy tensors do not add , as can be seen by the nonlinearity of the stress - energy tensor on the right hand side of equation [ eqn : ee ] .",
    "that is , these scalar field solutions , which can equivalently be thought of as wave solutions , interfere with one another both constructively and destructively .",
    "the result is a pressure which oscillates rapidly between being positive and negative with the average pressure being very close to zero , sufficiently far after the big bang , in the homogeneous , isotropic universe case .",
    "these statements are made precise by the following theorem , proved in appendix [ sfcdm ] .",
    "[ cosmothm ] suppose that the spacetime metric is both homogeneous and isotropic , and hence is the friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker metric @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the constant curvature metric of curvature @xmath40 .",
    "if @xmath41 is a real - valued solution to the klein - gordon equation ( equation [ eqn : kg ] with mass term @xmath27 ) with a stress - energy tensor which is isotropic , then @xmath25 is solely a function of @xmath29 .",
    "furthermore , if we let @xmath42 be the hubble constant ( which of course is actually a function of @xmath29 ) , and @xmath43 and @xmath44 be the energy density and pressure of the scalar field at each point , then @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 where @xmath48 are two zeros of @xmath25 ( for example , two consecutive zeros ) .",
    "we comment that if we crudely approximate @xmath49 and @xmath50 , then @xmath51 at the current age of the universe .",
    "we leave it to others to find better approximations for these values , but the point is that @xmath52 is very small .",
    "hence , this scalar field dark matter model automatically gives a cold dark matter model in the homogeneous , isotropic case , sufficiently long after the big bang .",
    "in contrast , in the wimp model the particles are considered independently of one another , and so their stress - energy tensors do add , allowing for significant pressure terms to be present , even in the homogeneous , isotropic universe case .",
    "hence , unlike the wimp model , there is no hot version of the scalar field model of dark matter in the homogeneous and isotropic universe case .",
    "since hot dark matter is inconsistent with cosmological observations @xcite , this is a nice property for a dark matter theory to have .",
    "thus , scalar field dark matter is a serious candidate for cold dark matter .",
    "furthermore , since it appears that scalar field dark matter and cold wimp dark matter give similar predictions on the cosmological scale , it makes sense to go to the galactic scale to look for differences .",
    "we now begin our analysis which shows that scalar field dark matter satisfying the einstein - klein - gordon equations may be related to spiral structure in disk galaxies and may predict plausible brightness profiles for elliptical galaxies .",
    "the cosmological constant is sufficiently small to be well approximated by zero on the galactic scale , so we need to study solutions to the einstein - klein - gordon equations @xmath53    studying these equations is particularly challenging because of their nonlinearities .",
    "the trivial solution to these equations is the minkowski spacetime with zero scalar field . also , any vacuum general relativity solution with zero scalar field is a solution .",
    "in addition , when the scalar field is taken to be complex , there exist spherically symmetric static solutions @xcite . as discussed in @xcite",
    ", one may think of these static solutions as solutions where the dispersive characteristics of the scalar field , which are mild for long wavelengths , are balanced with gravity .",
    "there are also real scalar field solutions analogous to the complex ones , but these are not quite static and are only known approximately @xcite .    in 1992 ,",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and then @xcite , @xcite proposed scalar field wave equations for dark matter as a way of explaining the observed flatness of rotation curves @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite for most galaxies .",
    "as described in the survey article @xcite , this idea has been rediscovered many times ( including by the author at the beginning of this work ) . translated into our context , the exciting fact about the static solutions discussed above is that they give qualitatively good predictions for the rotation curves for galaxies .",
    "since most of the matter in disk galaxies is going in very circular orbits @xcite , it makes sense to define the rotation curve of a galaxy to be the velocity of the matter of the galaxy as a function of radius .",
    "it is a striking fact that these curves are very flat .",
    "for example , most of the mass of the milky way galaxy is going approximately 220 km / s in circular motion about its center @xcite .",
    "however , visible mass is not massive enough to account for these rotation curves , which is one of the motivations for the existence of dark matter . hence , the prediction of flat rotation curves is certainly intriguing , to say the least",
    "however , most of the above solutions , in both the real and complex case , are actually unstable @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , combinations of the above solutions ( with one being the stable `` ground state '' ) yield dynamic spherically symmetric solutions which are stable according to numerical simulations @xcite and give somewhat flat rotation curves .",
    "alternatively , it is suggested in @xcite that perhaps the dark matter halos , like most everything else in the universe , are rotating , and that this rotation provides additional stability .",
    "@xcite also points out that the bottom - up structure formation scenario of the @xmath0 model could allow , or even require , that the dark matter have angular momentum .",
    "the answers to the questions implied in the previous paragraph are not yet clear .",
    "what is really needed are careful simulations of the einstein - klein - gordon equations in a perturbed cosmological setting to see what typical `` blobs '' of scalar field dark matter look like .",
    "these simulations could then address the question of what happens when two blobs collide , whether they have enough dynamical friction to combine , and how they carry angular momentum .",
    "it may be necessary to simulate the regular matter at the same time so that energy from the dark matter can be transferred to the regular matter and then dissipated through friction and radiation .",
    "also , regular matter could help stabilize the galactic potential which could help to stabilize the dark matter at sufficiently small radii .",
    "there are many important open problems in these areas .",
    "on the other hand , it is very easy to write down solutions to the klein - gordon equation if we fix the spacetime metric as the minkowski spacetime .",
    "the klein - gordon equation then becomes @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the standard laplacian on @xmath56 .",
    "solutions can then be expanded in terms of spherical harmonics to get solutions which are linear combinations of solutions of the form @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 is an @xmath60th degree spherical harmonic .",
    "note that we require @xmath61 but have not specified an overall normalization . naturally , to get a complete basis of solutions we also need to include solutions like the one above but where @xmath62 is replaced by @xmath63 .",
    "we will study real solutions in this paper , but complex solutions are quite analogous .",
    "it is also easy to write down solutions to the klein - gordon equation if we fix the spacetime metric to be a spherically symmetric static spacetime . for our purposes ,",
    "suppose we approximate the spherically symmetric static spacetime metric as @xmath64 as is standard .",
    "the function @xmath65 acts likes the gravitational potential function from newtonian physics . in this case , the above form in equation [ basis ] is still fine , but equation [ sphericalode ] is modified to become @xmath66 since dark matter , which makes up most of the mass of most galaxies , is known to be mostly spherical @xcite , even when the regular matter is not , the spacetime metric of a typical galaxy can be approximated reasonably well by one which is spherically symmetric and static .",
    "hence , we want to understand the spherically symmetric static case with a potential well @xmath65 coming from the mass distribution of a galaxy as well as we can",
    ".    there is one main qualitative difference between the minkowski spacetime case and the spherically symmetric static case . in the minkowski case",
    ", @xmath67 always decays sinusoidally with amplitude decreasing like @xmath68 .",
    "energy density decays like the square of this , which means that solutions do not have finite total energy . in the spherically symmetric case",
    ", there are still solutions like these , but there are also solutions which , if @xmath69 is small enough , have an exponential behavior as @xmath70 goes to infinity . for most values of @xmath69 , this exponential behavior is actually increasing .",
    "however , for a discrete set of values of @xmath69 , the coefficient in front of the increasing exponential term is zero and all that is left is a decaying exponential behavior .",
    "the corresponding energy density is also exponentially decaying , and so solutions with finite total energy exist .",
    "the key to understanding this behavior is the term @xmath71 .",
    "when it is negative , the solution @xmath72 is in its oscillatory domain .",
    "when this term is positive , @xmath72 is in its exponential domain .",
    "the cases we are interested in are when a solution @xmath72 begins in its oscillatory domain at @xmath73 but ultimately ends up in its exponential domain as @xmath70 goes to infinity , with exponential decay and hence finite total energy .",
    "hence , we must choose @xmath69 in the range @xmath74 for such a solution @xmath72 , it is natural to define the radius @xmath75 to be the largest value of @xmath70 for which @xmath76 .",
    "in the spherically symmetric case with positive matter density , @xmath65 is an increasing function of @xmath70 , so there is a unique value for @xmath70 which makes this expression zero .",
    "the point to take away from all of this is that for @xmath77 , we get rapid decay for @xmath72 .",
    "we also comment that for @xmath65 which are sufficiently asymptotic to @xmath78 at infinity , for example ( the standard scenario ) , and for each @xmath60 , there are an infinite number of discrete values of @xmath69 which give finite energy solutions , with the values of these @xmath69 converging to the upper limit in inequality [ omegarange ] and the radii @xmath75 of these solutions converging to infinity .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for more analysis of these types of equations .",
    "furthermore , there is an analogy between minkowski solutions and solutions in a spherically symmetric potential with finite total energy . without loss of generality ( by rescaling the spacetime coordinates ) , it is convenient to take @xmath79 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath80 since we are in the low field limit of general relativity .",
    "hence , the range of allowable values for @xmath69 given by equation [ omegarange ] is quite narrow .",
    "furthermore , if we compare equations [ sphericalode ] and [ sphericalodemod ] , we see that solutions with the same @xmath69 will start out very nearly the same for small @xmath70 since @xmath79 .",
    "they will begin to differ more and more as @xmath70 increases , until finally the solution in the potential well will stop oscillating and decay rapidly to zero . from these qualitative observations",
    ", we make the claim that we can get a qualitative approximation for the solution in the spherically symmetric potential well by taking the solution in minkowski space and modifying it by declaring it to be zero outside of some radius .",
    "the purpose of this approximation is not to describe the nuances of the solutions , but to get something that is qualitatively correct and has qualitatively similar properties .",
    "in this way we do not need to know the specifics of the potential of a galaxy , just the radius at which we wish to cutoff the matter density of the scalar field dark matter solutions in the minkowski spacetime .",
    "at this point we keep our promise from the end of the first section and clearly state that we have made three approximations .",
    "first , we are approximating solutions in a spherically symmetric potential well with minkowski solutions which we will arbitrarily cutoff at some radius .",
    "second , the exact solutions in a spherically symmetric potential well would still be approximations in the cases we are interested in , since the model for rotating dark matter we are using does not give a spherically symmetric dark matter density or potential , although one could approximate the potential as such .",
    "third , we have not shown and do not know for certain that there even exist solutions to the full einstein - klein - gordon equations which are qualitatively similar to what we are doing here . determining the answer to this last issue is a very important open problem which could benefit from simulations .    as a next step in the near future , it will be a good idea to actually specify a spherically symmetric potential of a galaxy that one is trying to model , and then solve equation [ sphericalodemod ] with that potential .",
    "it will then be desirable to match up the resulting dark matter density ( which may be aspherical ) with the closest spherically symmetric potential .",
    "this is a reasonable approach , but slightly more complicated than what we do here .",
    "hence , we have made the decision to keep things as simple as possible for this preliminary analysis , which in this case suggests using minkowski spacetime solutions which are arbitrarily cutoff at the radius of our choosing .",
    "we justify letting ourselves choose this cutoff radius since @xmath75 , defined in the spherically symmetric potential case , takes on arbitrarily large values for every value of @xmath60 .",

    "we note these solutions fall into the form of equation [ basis ] since both @xmath87 and @xmath88 are second degree spherical harmonics .",
    "hence , the above minkowski spacetime solution is the sum of a spherically symmetric solution ( degree @xmath89 ) and two degree two solutions .",
    "we have not included first degree spherical harmonics since they would not preserve the center of mass at the origin .",
    "we would in general expect higher degree spherical harmonics in galactic solutions as well , but for this paper we have chosen to focus on the case when the second degree spherical harmonic terms dominate . as we will see , these solutions all have @xmath90 rotational symmetry with densities which rotate rigidly ( which naturally is not the case when more than two distinct @xmath69 frequencies are present ) . in the future ,",
    "if one would want to try to model spiral galaxies with something other than two arms , then these other degree spherical harmonics should be studied .",
    "also , initial computations suggest that the approximation in equation [ angmomsol ] is a reasonable qualitative approximation to a solution in the fixed spherically symmetric potential case . for example , the pictures in figure 8 show the precise scalar field dark matter densities in the @xmath83 plane at @xmath91 , @xmath81 million years , and @xmath82 million years in a fixed spherically symmetric potential well based on the milky way galaxy . like the minkowski solution in equation [ angmomsol ] ,",
    "the solution depicted in figure 8 is also a sum of a spherically symmetric solution and two degree two solutions , but in a spherically symmetric potential .",
    "notice how the solutions appear to have compact support , although actually the solution has simply decayed very rapidly outside a finite radius .",
    "otherwise , the interference pattern is very similar to what we will see with the solutions in equation [ angmomsol ] , with the most obvious difference being in the last ring or two , which are a bit stretched out in the radial direction compared to our model . since all we ultimately care about are the qualitative characteristics of the gravitational potential for the dark matter that we ultimately produce , this minor difference is something we are willing to tolerate for now .",
    "the reason the dark matter density is rotating in figure 8 and in our minkowski model is most easily seen by making the substitution @xmath92 into our expression for @xmath25 in equations [ angmomsol ] to get @xmath93 note that to the extent that @xmath94 stays fixed in time , then the above solution does not rotate and gives a fixed interference pattern since both terms are oscillating in time with the same frequency @xmath95 .",
    "hence , since @xmath96 because of inequality [ omegarange ] , we see that we get an dark matter interference pattern which is rotating according to the formula @xmath97 with period @xmath98 which may be related to the pattern period of the resulting barred spiral patterns in the regular matter .",
    "our next goal is to approximate the energy density @xmath99 due to this scalar field dark matter solution and then to expand it in terms of spherical harmonics . from equation [ angmomsol2 ] , we have that @xmath100 \\nonumber \\\\     & & + \\sin(\\omega_0 t ) \\left[a_2 \\sin(2\\alpha ) \\sin^2(\\theta ) r^2     f_{\\omega_2,2}(r)\\right ] .",

    "this allows us to think of @xmath94 as being approximately fixed in time .",
    "hence , @xmath103 ^ 2     + \\left[a_2 \\sin(2\\alpha ) \\sin^2(\\theta ) r^2     f_{\\omega_2,2}(r)\\right]^2 \\\\     & = & a_0 ^ 2 f_{\\omega_0,0}(r)^2 + a_2 ^ 2 \\sin^4(\\theta ) r^4     f_{\\omega_2,2}(r)^2 + 2a_0 a_2 \\cos(2\\alpha ) \\sin^2(\\theta ) r^2     f_{\\omega_0,0}(r ) f_{\\omega_2,2}(r ) \\label{expandedmess}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in order to expand the above result into spherical harmonics , we need to recall that spherical harmonics defined on the unit sphere are actually restrictions of homogeneous polynomials of the same degree which are harmonic in @xmath56 .",
    "for example , @xmath87 is @xmath104 , a harmonic polynomial of degree 2 , restricted to the unit sphere and @xmath88 is @xmath105 restricted to the unit sphere . to summarize the quick facts that we need to know , here is a quick list of homogeneous harmonic polynomials : degree zero : @xmath106 , degree one : @xmath107 , degree two : @xmath108 , and then one more of degree four : @xmath109 , where @xmath110 .",
    "it is easy to check that these are all harmonic in @xmath56 and hence their restrictions to the unit sphere are spherical harmonics of the same degree .    since @xmath111 is a rotated degree two spherical harmonic and hence a spherical harmonic itself ( taking @xmath112 to be fixed ) , the last term of equation [ expandedmess ] is already in the form of a spherical harmonic times a function of @xmath70 , as we desire .",
    "the first term is as well , since it is already a function of @xmath70 and the zeroth spherical harmonic is the constant function one .",
    "hence , it is only the middle term that we need to put into the desired form . to do this",
    ", we note that @xmath113 which successfully expresses this term as the sum of three terms , each of which is a function of @xmath70 times a spherical harmonic .",
    "hence , @xmath114 where @xmath115    our next step is to compute the gravitational potential @xmath116 of this dark matter density @xmath99 .",
    "notice that the dark matter density is the sum of a spherically symmetric term , two axially symmetric terms , and a term with neither of those symmetries which is rotating .",
    "as it turns out , the potential will be of this same form .",
    "we will solve for the potential by solving the newtonian equation @xmath117 for each value of @xmath29 , where @xmath55 is the laplacian in @xmath56 .",
    "since we are interested in solutions where the group velocities of our dark matter scalar field is much less than the speed of light , this newtonian approximation will be fine .",
    "we will use the fact that it is easy to take the laplacian of a function expressed in terms of spherical harmonics since @xmath118 where @xmath94 is a general index and @xmath119 is a spherical harmonic of degree @xmath120 .",
    "this identity follows from the facts that @xmath121 is a harmonic function in @xmath56 , the radial part of the laplacian is @xmath122 , and @xmath123 .",
    "it follows that @xmath124 where @xmath125 with the boundary conditions @xmath126 note that we mean to apply the above equation and boundary conditions to @xmath127 as well .",
    "these boundary conditions produce a potential function which goes to zero at infinity .",
    "naturally any constant may be added to the potential if one desires .",
    "since we are going to cutoff the scalar field dark matter density outside of a radius @xmath128 of our choice , for @xmath129 we will have @xmath130 which , to satisfy our boundary condition at infinity , has solution @xmath131 hence , for @xmath132 , @xmath133 in our computer simulations , we will not actually take @xmath70 to infinity , but instead , after starting with @xmath134 and solving the o.d.e .",
    "out to @xmath135 , add whatever constant is necessary to @xmath136 to satisfy equation [ effectivebdycondition ] outside the dark matter radius @xmath128 .",
    "thus , in summary , given any @xmath137 and @xmath27 ( which is a fixed fundamental constant of the universe in our theory but is not precisely known ) , as well as any @xmath128 ( the radius at which we cutoff the dark matter wave function and density ) , we have written down formulas in this section for everything else . the wave function @xmath25 is defined by equations [ sphericalode ] and [ angmomsol ] .",
    "the dark matter density rotates at constant angular speed according to equation [ rotationformula ] with period given in equation [ periodformula ] .",
    "the dark matter density , defined by equations [ dmdensitysphericalharmonics ] and [ sphericalharmoniccomponents ] , has gravitational potential defined by equations [ potentialsphericalharmonics ] and [ potentialcomponents ] .",

    "our proposed contribution to understanding disk galaxies ends there - we do not simulate the gravitational interactions of the stars , much less the complicated dynamics of the interstellar medium composed of gas and dust , nor star formation and supernova .",
    "the contribution we attempt to make here is simply to qualitatively model the effect of scalar field dark matter satisfying the klein - gordon equation on the regular matter of a galaxy , which we demonstrate may possibly cause barred spiral patterns in a wide range of shapes .",
    "if indeed dark matter is responsible for the shapes of many galaxies , this would explain why it has taken so long to understand spiral structure .",
    "this is especially the case if the dark matter has a dynamics which is different than most commonly thought .",
    "since the bulk of dark matter has only been detected so far by its gravitational effects , it is reasonable to look to the details of the gravitational predictions made by each dark matter theory .",
    "we consider the possibility that scalar field dark matter satisfying the klein - gordon equation may have a characteristic signature which provides the beginnings of a unified theory for spiral and bar patterns in disk galaxies .    also , we comment that we do not mean to dismiss other possible explanations of spiral structure but instead are simply adding another possibility which seems to hold promise .",
    "we recommend the book `` spiral structure in galaxies : a density wave theory '' by g. bertin and c.c .",
    "lin @xcite , published in 1996 , as a fascinating description of the progress of the lin - shu density wave theory of spiral structure .",
    "our dark matter density wave theory of spiral structure has much in common with this famous theory as both theories try to explain observed density waves in the visible matter . in the lin - shu theory ,",
    "these waves are induced by the regular matter itself which plays the dominant role . in our dark matter density wave theory , we suggest that the dark matter provides the primary effect leading to barred spiral structure , for two reasons : there is more dark matter than regular matter , at least for large radii , and scalar field dark matter may have a greater tendency to produce density waves because of its wave nature . of course in our theory",
    "regular matter still has gravity too , so this effect must still be considered .",
    "hence , we see an opportunity for a combined theory of spiral structure coming out of our proposal which accounts for the gravitational effects of both the dark matter and the regular matter . of course for a complete picture , it seems very likely that the interstellar medium , star formation , and supernova will need to be modeled too . until all of these elements are put together into a convincing model",
    ", it will not be clear what the ultimate implications of the preliminary simulations we do here will be .",
    "we begin with a few qualitative conclusions . by looking at figure 8 , for example",
    ", we see that the dark matter density deviates from spherical symmetry and rotates rigidly for these very special solutions .",
    "thus , the level sets of the resulting potential function will not be spheres but instead will resemble triaxial ellipsoids . hence , the potential function for our dark matter can be thought of as a rotating triaxial potential .    another way to get",
    "a rotating triaxial galactic potential is to have another galaxy pass nearby . in @xcite , toomre shows how quadrupole forces ( modeled by positive masses at 0 and 180 degrees and negative masses at 90 and 270 degrees rotating around the origin ) , which also produce something resembling a rotating triaxial potential , can cause surprisingly strong spiral patterns in test particles which were otherwise rotating in circular motion around the origin .",
    "hence , before we even begin our simulations , toomre s work suggests that we are likely to get spiral patterns to emerge .",
    "as described in @xcite , one characteristic of disk galaxies is that they have significant amounts of gas and dust . unlike stars which effectively never collide and",
    "hence do not have friction , gas and dust do have friction .",
    "in fact , the presumption is that it is precisely this friction which causes the collapse of gas and dust clouds into disks in the first place .",
    "friction decreases total energy but conserves angular momentum , and a disk configuration with everything rotating circularly in the same direction allows for relatively large total angular momentum for its total energy since the angular momentum vectors of the individual masses are aligned . and sure enough , most of the visible mass of disk galaxies are indeed moving in roughly circular orbits .",
    "in addition , the surface brightness of disk galaxies is approximately modeled by @xmath138 where @xmath139 is called the disk scale length of the galaxy .",
    "hence , our simulations begin with a large number of point masses representing the mass of the galaxy in circular motion with area density modeled by the above equation .",
    "of course since we are not modeling the gravitational effects of the regular matter , its initial density profile is not critically important .",
    "in fact , each of these point masses should be thought of as test particles which , for now , act as if they have zero mass in our simulations .    the command line for our spiral galaxy simulations ,",
    "all done in matlab , is @xmath140 this matlab .m file may be downloaded at http://www.math.duke.edu/faculty/bray/darkmatter/darkmatter.html which also contains the author s matlab .m file , ellipticalgalaxy.m , for doing elliptical galaxy simulations . the input variables @xmath128 , @xmath141 , @xmath142 , @xmath143 , @xmath28 , and @xmath139 have already been defined .",
    "the input variable @xmath144 is the step size with which the o.d.e.s in equations [ sphericalode ] and [ potentialcomponents ] are approximately solved .",
    "the user is allowed to enter either a positive or negative value for @xmath28 as only the absolute value is used for the actual value of @xmath28 , where a positive value denotes counterclockwise rotation for the regular matter and a negative value denotes clockwise rotation for the regular matter .",

    "if the potential function where spherically symmetric ( corresponding to @xmath190 ) , these test particles would continue in perfectly circular motion which would preserve the original density and image .",
    "however , since our potential is not spherically symmetric , the particles deviate from perfectly circular paths and respond to the aspherical gravitational influence of the scalar field dark matter s gravitational potential .",
    "this results in density waves in the test particles , as can be seen in the figures .",
    "each frame represents @xmath106 million years of elapse time .",
    "the image visualization process that we have used to generate the images in figures 14 - 18 is very important . when plotting many data points in the standard way , it is hard to see what the true density of data points is in regions where the data points overlap each other a lot .",
    "instead , we have used the following method : think of each data point as a disk of a small radius with uniform brightness . define the overall brightness function to be the sum of the brightnesses of all of the test disks , and then graph this overall brightness function . in this way",
    ", the overall brightness of each frame in the figures should be the same .",
    "however , we have normalized each frame so that the maximum value of the brightness in each frame corresponds to @xmath191 white and zero brightness corresponds to black , so the overall apparent brightness of each frame varies slightly .",
    "probably the most striking feature of the images in figures 14 - 18 is the development of the barred spiral pattern which , after roughly @xmath164 million years , somewhat resembles the appearance of ngc 1300 . even more generally , it is interesting that somewhat stable patterns develop at all . at a mini - conference at the petters research institute in dangriga , belize ,",
    "arlie petters recognized the existence of folds in these images , and pointed out that folds naturally have a short time stability because of their topological nature .",
    "furthermore , the density goes to infinity along a fold . to be explicit ,",
    "consider the mapping @xmath192 represented by mapping the position of the particles at time zero to their positions at time @xmath29 . naturally the density at @xmath193 at time @xmath29 will increase by a factor of @xmath194 , which goes to infinity along a fold in the mapping .",
    "hence , when a generic fold in our simulation develops , it will cause a curve of infinite density for as long as the generic fold remains .",
    "of course one could expand this analysis to all of phase space for other more general situations , but there is no need to do this here since the velocity of our particles is a function of position at @xmath195 .    hence , this `` fold argument '' predicts density waves with short time stability .",
    "moreover , along the fold curve the density goes to infinity .",
    "naturally , the theoretical prediction of regions of infinite density could be very important for understanding the large scale process of star formation , especially since there is dramatically increased star formation in the arms of spiral galaxies @xcite .",
    "we note that this same fold argument can be generalized to apply to three dimensional space as well .",
    "hence , we put forth the possibility that dark matter enforcing a `` fold dynamics '' upon gas and dust clouds could be a major driver , possibly even the primary driver , of star formation .",
    "we leave this as a very interesting question to study .      before moving to the next simulation",
    ", we point out that it is not entirely clear what all of the implications of the first simulation are . for example , is ngc 1300 in a steady - state configuration with a precise pattern speed , or will it evolve at some rate similar to the pictures in figures 14 - 18 ? at this point",
    "we can not answer this question because the simulation just described does not account for anything other than the gravity of the dark matter .",
    "hence , we really can not say anything definitive on this question .",
    "one possibility , which we discuss here for the sake of argument , is that spiral galaxies result from at least two important effects , the first being the gravity of dark matter , and the second , for example , being friction of gas and dust and supernovae which replenish the supply of gas and dust .",
    "this second effect , whatever it is exactly , would be responsible for keeping most of the matter of the galaxy in the disk with roughly circular motion ( and hence would probably not be time reversible ) . ideally , this second effect would partially justify our choice of initial conditions in our simulations in some general sense . in this manner ,",
    "if such a second effect like this exists , we could view a galaxy like ngc 1300 as being the result of two effects fighting against each other , one pushing the state toward something similar to the @xmath195 initial conditions , and the other pushing distributions of regular matter into spiral patterns . this could conceivably lead to something close to a steady state equilibrium of a trailing spiral pattern rotating at a constant pattern speed .",
    "if this second effect is not time reversible ( like friction ) , then we are immune from the anti - spiral theorem @xcite .",
    "hence , the existence of steady state trailing spiral patterns would not necessarily imply the existence of steady state leading spiral patterns , which is good since they are typically not observed @xcite . clearly very careful simulations are needed to shed light on these questions ,",
    "about which at this point we can only speculate .",
    "the other issue to consider is the behavior of old stars .",
    "old stars also are mostly in the disk of the galaxy going in roughly circular motion , but with a higher variance than the gas and dust and younger stars @xcite .",
    "does dynamical friction of these older stars with the gas , dust , and other stars or some other process `` cool '' the velocities of these older stars and keep them in the galactic disk with roughly circular orbits ?",
    "if so , then the simulations presented here might be relevant for producing spiral patterns in the older stars as well .",
    "an answer to the above question is needed , at a minimum , though , before one can make definitive conclusions .      as a second example , consider @xmath196 which produces the simulated image in figure 2 as the @xmath197 million years image of figure 23 . in figure 2 , we compare this image to ngc 4314 , a barred spiral galaxy of type sba .",
    "the main difference between this example and the previous simulation is that @xmath142 , which controls the size of the interference pattern which rotates , is now only @xmath198 instead of @xmath106 .",

    "( the @xmath147 step size is also @xmath199 now up from @xmath200 , but this makes little difference . ) interestingly , we notice that this smaller value for @xmath142 results in a more oval bar than in the previous example .",

    "there appear to be folds which produce relatively dense spiral arms as well as a general concentration in the central oval bar region .",
    "we use this example to make three more points : first , in our spiral galaxy simulations ( unlike the elliptical galaxy simulations to come ) , we assume an exponential initial density in the test particles . we do not derive this density , nor do we explain it with our model .",
    "we take this initial density as given , presumably from other important effects like friction present in spiral galaxies which we do not model . hence , the fact that the brightness goes to zero for large radii is not something that we have attempted to model for spiral galaxies ( although we will attempt this for elliptical galaxies ) .",
    "second , our initial distribution is not smooth but instead is composed of @xmath204 tiny bright disks .",
    "while this visualization method works well for us , this technique also produces artificial patterns in the pictures which are not physical but instead reflect the initial regular pattern in which these tiny bright disks were originally placed .",
    "third , what is real , we believe , is that the background material not in the spiral pattern does appear to be a larger percentage of the test particles than in the previous example .",
    "hence , this also appears to be a feature which is controlled by this model .      as a third example , consider @xmath205 which produces the simulated image in figure 3 as the @xmath206 million years image of figure 24 , rotated @xmath156 degrees clockwise . in figure 3 , we compare this image to ngc 3310 , a `` starburst '' spiral galaxy of type sbc which is forming stars at a rate much higher than most other galaxies .",
    "the dark matter density and the dark matter potential in this example are exactly the same as in the previous example .",
    "in fact , the only difference between this third simulation and the previous one is that the rate at which the dark matter rotates has been slowed to a period of @xmath207 million years .",
    "this would appear to have the effect of unwinding the spiral arms compared to the previous example .",
    "we also wonder if more slowly rotating dark matter density waves could be correlated with starburst activity in galaxies where greater numbers of stars are being formed , as in the case of ngc 3310 .",
    "this idea is consistent with the earlier `` fold dynamics '' suggestion that dark matter plays an important role in star formation .",
    "the slower the dark matter density waves move , the more time they have to act on the regular matter before the dark matter density wave passes through .",
    "this idea could conceivably be tested in part by seeing if there are certain morphology types of galaxies more commonly associated with starburst activity , although it is not yet definitively clear what the prediction , if any , might be . of course , since there may be more than one cause of starburst activity and multiple conditions required ( such as sufficient gas and dust ) , this is a delicate , but very interesting , question to study .",
    "we also point out that changing the period of the dark matter rotation changes the value of @xmath27 , as seen in equation [ upsilonequation ] . in the first two simulations ,",
    "@xmath208 light years . in this third simulation , @xmath209 light years . on the other hand ,",
    "we have not paid much attention to the overall scale of these galaxies .",
    "that is , we have noticed that these simulations match the shapes of certain galaxies , up to scale . to actually estimate",
    "the value of @xmath27 would both require finding the range of values of our input parameters which give best fits for these galaxies , up to scale , and then scaling the resulting output morphologies to fit the actual galaxies . as we said before",
    ", this may be a good project , but we do not attempt this in this paper .",
    "finally , one thing that we must say about these simulations in general is that every run , for wide ranges of values for the input variables , produces simulated images which look a lot like galaxies .",
    "that is , we have not `` cherry picked '' the images shown in this paper , other than to pick the ones which look as much as possible to example galaxies for which we happen to have good pictures .",
    "the images we have not picked look a lot like galaxies too .",
    "of course , since galaxies come in such a wide variety of shapes , this does not prove anything .",

    "we only include one other figure for this example , namely figure 26 .",
    "as can be seen in that figure , the main difference in this example from the previous ones is that we have increased the wavelengths @xmath215 and @xmath152 by a factor of @xmath216 . as a result",
    ", the scale of the wavelengths is approaching the scale of the galaxy itself .",
    "we have not done enough test runs of our simulations to draw any careful conclusions about exactly what differences this implies , but our first impression , based on figure 4 , is that this is one way to get tightly wound spirals .",
    "we note that with these choices of wavelengths @xmath217 and dark matter period @xmath143 that @xmath218 light years , which is much different from our first three examples .",
    "however , we can always tweak the values of @xmath219 and @xmath143 later . at this stage we are simply trying to understand the full range of the possible outcomes of these simulations .",
    "finally , our earlier point about not optimizing our input parameters to match the photos of actual spiral galaxies in figures 1 - 4 is particularly relevant in this last example .",
    "there was a resemblance to ngc 488 , so we put the simulated image next to this galaxy for the sake of argument .",
    "we only tried this one simulation in this range of values , so it is very likely that the input parameters can be adjusted , possibly by a lot , to create a better match .",
    "each run of these simulations , when done on the author s pc at home , takes all night typically , so we have by no means exhausted all of the possible scenarios to try to model . of course , converting this code to a faster programming language would speed things up greatly . using multiple processors , as the author has recently begun doing at duke university ,",
    "is also a big help .",
    "in contrast to spiral galaxies , gas and dust are not thought to play a major role in the overall dynamics of elliptical galaxies @xcite .",
    "furthermore , to a good approximation in many cases , elliptical galaxies are mostly transparent @xcite .",
    "light from the stars of an elliptical galaxy is mostly not absorbed into the dust of the galaxy but instead mostly makes it out to be observed by telescopes .",
    "hence , the observed brightness of elliptical galaxies is a good indiction of the true brightness .",
    "in addition , since gas and dust play a greatly reduced role , elliptical galaxies should be fairly well modeled by @xmath60 body simulations .",
    "in retrospect , there is a fairly strong argument for studying elliptical galaxies first , before disk galaxies , as a way of testing a dark matter theory because elliptical galaxies are easier to model .",
    "while spiral galaxies seem more spectacular at first glance , there is plenty to understand about elliptical galaxies as well .",
    "for example , section 4.3 `` photometry of elliptical galaxies '' of @xcite is a treasure trove of data about elliptical galaxies .",
    "one of the most striking facts is that the surface brightness profiles of observed images of many elliptical galaxies , especially ngc 1700 for example , are well modeled by @xmath220 for constants @xmath48 .",
    "it turns out to be more convenient to redefine the constants such that @xmath221\\},\\ ] ] where @xmath222 has been chosen so that half of the total brightness is contained inside radius @xmath223 and @xmath224 is the brightness at this radius .",
    "that is , @xmath225 as explained in @xcite .",
    "naturally this model works better for some elliptical galaxies than others , and in some cases there are significant deviations @xcite .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite as an example of previous work trying to explain these observed brightness profiles of elliptical galaxies .",
    "most other models depend greatly on the process by which the elliptical galaxy is formed , which translates into the initial conditions of the simulation .",
    "we are also faced with this question .",
    "however , we find that our case is qualitatively different . the dark matter density waves , which formed spiral patterns in disk galaxies , now effectively `` randomize '' the energies of the test particles in elliptical galaxies . some of the test particles gain energy and are slung out to larger radii , while some of the test particles lose energy and spend their time at smaller radii",
    ". that is , unlike the traditional wimp dark matter case where the dark matter is taken to create a roughly static potential , our rotating dynamic dark matter potential removes the conservation of energy constraint for each test particle .",
    "physically , this can be thought of as a transfer of energy between the test particles and the dark matter .",
    "while this happens in any dark matter theory , the scale of this transfer appears to be much larger for our rotating scalar field dark matter model than for the wimp model .    to see if this model for rotating scalar field",
    "dark matter could reproduce something close to the observed brightness profiles , we created a matlab simulation whose command line is @xmath226 this matlab .m file may be downloaded at http://www.math.duke.edu/faculty/bray/darkmatter/darkmatter.html which also contains the author s matlab .m file , spiralgalaxy.m , for doing spiral galaxy simulations .",
    "notice that almost all of the input variables are the same as spiralgalaxy.m .",
    "in fact , the model for the rotating dark matter and the corresponding rotating dark matter potential are exactly the same .",
    "the only differences , really , are the initial conditions that we choose for our point particles and how we display the results .",
    "notice that we no longer have @xmath139 as an input parameter , which was the disk scale length of the spiral galaxy , which determined the initial density of the test particles .",
    "instead we are trying to determine equilibrium densities for test particles in mostly radial motion , as is the case for elliptical galaxies @xcite .",
    "this raises the question of what the initial placement of the test particles should be .",
    "we chose something very simple - place all of the test particles on a sphere of radius @xmath227 , the initial radius , but with zero velocity .",
    "when the test particles collapse down toward the origin , the result will be a kind of explosion as the stars come back out .",
    "elliptical galaxies are thought to be the result , at least in many cases , of other galaxies which have merged , perhaps many times @xcite .",
    "these initial conditions are inspired by this as well .",
    "the other input variable is @xmath228 which has nothing to do with the actual simulation but only with how the results of the simulation are displayed .",
    "since we want to understand the predicted brightness profile , we will want to know the distribution of the test particles in the viewing plane . to do this",
    ", we determine the radius of each test particle in the viewing plane and then create a histogram of the resulting radii , where the bin size for each interval of radii is @xmath228 .",
    "we will refer to these histograms as graphs of the `` radial frequency in the @xmath83 plane . ''",
    "we will then compare our measured radial frequencies with that which is predicted by equation [ brightnessmodel ] , which we will approximate by @xmath229 this is easily done by defining @xmath223 to be the median value of the measured radii in the viewing plane and by choosing @xmath224 to give the correct overall normalization so that the total brightnesses are the same .",
    "we remind the reader that the test particles in these simulations , which are mostly supposed to represent stars in this case , are still treated as though they have zero mass .",
    "hence , we are only measuring the gravitational effect of the dark matter on the stars .",
    "this is instructive for a first simulation .",

    "moreover , experiments have shown that general relativity describes gravity as accurately as can be measured .",
    "the central equation of general relativity is the einstein equation @xmath258 where @xmath259 is the einstein curvature tensor and @xmath260 , called the stress energy tensor , describes the local energy and momentum density .",

    "for example , @xmath261 the vacuum einstein equation , is a complete theory in our terminology because there is no matter term to evolve .",

    "in fact , by the positive mass theorem @xcite , @xcite , an isolated asymptotically flat vacuum solution must have strictly positive total mass , unless the spacetime is flat everywhere ( and hence is the minkowski spacetime ) .",

    "all of the above statements are true assuming that an existence theory for the vacuum einstein equation @xmath263 generically exists , which is currently an open problem .",
    "the difficulty in even proving an existence theory for @xmath263 is another indication of the highly nontrivial nature of the equation .",
    "einstein chose @xmath259 once he learned that the divergence of @xmath24 equaled zero by the second bianchi identity @xcite .",
    "this zero divergence property can be interpreted as a local conservation property for energy and momentum density , a understandably desirable property .",
    "hilbert realized that the zero divergence property of @xmath24 was a direct result of the fact that metrics which are critical points of the functional @xmath264 satisfy the corresponding euler - lagrange equation @xmath263 on the spacetime @xmath1 .",
    "the role of the open set @xmath11 in the above equation , whose closure is required to be compact , is to keep the integral finite .",
    "we define a metric @xmath2 to be a critical point of @xmath265 if this quantity does not change to first order for all smooth variations of the metric with compact support in the interior of @xmath11 .",
    "note that we are not minimizing or maximizing anything but are simply looking for critical points .",
    "moreover , hilbert realized that the zero divergence property is true for any euler - lagrange equation resulting from an action which is invariant under reparameterizations of the metric , as the einstein - hilbert action in equation [ eqn : vacuumgr ] is .",
    "today we think of this fact as a special case of noether s theorem . hence , the zero divergence property of @xmath24 , while nice , is nothing particularly special and is not the fundamental point . instead , vacuum general relativity is best understood as defining the metric to be a critical point of the einstein - hilbert action in equation [ eqn : vacuumgr ] .",
    "this raises the truly relevant question : what is so special about the einstein - hilbert action ?",
    "we begin by noting that in some ways the einstein - hilbert action is the simplest nontrivial scalar valued functional of a metric .",
    "the scalar curvature of a spacetime metric is a scalar at each point , so it is perfectly natural to integrate it .",
    "however , there is another characterizing property of this functional which is seen by expressing it in a coordinate chart .    given a coordinate chart mapping @xmath266 ,",
    "define @xmath267 to be the components of the metric in this coordinate chart .",
    "then standard calculations show that the formula for the scalar curvature in terms of the metric in a coordinate chart is @xmath268 where commas denote coordinate chart derivatives and the einstein summation convention of summing over indices which are both raised and lowered is in effect . as usual , we define @xmath269 = [ g_{ij}]^{-1}$ ] as matrices . also , the formula for the metric volume form in terms of the metric in a coordinate chart is @xmath270 where @xmath271)|$ ] . using @xmath272",
    "we can integrate by parts over an open set @xmath11 ( whose closure is compact ) in the coordinate chart to get @xmath273 where @xmath274 and @xmath275 is the outward unit normal to @xmath276 in the @xmath277 coordinate chart .",
    "note that our formula for the einstein - hilbert action is of the form @xmath278 where @xmath279 are the components of the metric in the coordinate chart and all of the first derivatives of these components in the coordinate chart , and where @xmath17 for some functions @xmath18 is a quadratic expression of the @xmath19 with coefficients in @xmath20 .",
    "what is interesting about this particular quadratic expression is that while its value at each point depends on the choice of coordinate chart , by equation [ eqn : scalarcurvquad ] its integral over @xmath276 is invariant with respect to smooth variations of @xmath280 compactly supported in the interior of @xmath11 ( which hence do not affect the boundary term ) .",
    "even more intriguing , this quadratic expression is the unique one with this property , up to multiplication by a constant , which follows from the works of cartan @xcite , weyl @xcite , and vermeil @xcite ( and pursued further by lovelock @xcite ) .",
    "hence , if we define @xmath281 for that same quadratic expression , then @xmath282 by equation [ eqn : scalarcurvquad ] .",
    "hence , the euler - lagrange equation for @xmath283 , for variations away from the boundary , must be the same as the one for @xmath284 , which is @xmath262 .",
    "more generally , let @xmath281 for _ any _ nontrivial quadratic expression , but require that @xmath2 is at a critical point of @xmath283 for _ all _ coordinate charts @xmath280 and all open sets @xmath11 ( whose closure is compact and in the interior of @xmath12 ) . then the resulting euler - lagrange equation can not depend on any one particular choice of coordinate chart , and so by uniqueness as proved by cartan @xcite , weyl @xcite , and vermeil @xcite up to a multiplicative constant",

    "then the resulting euler - lagrange equation still can not depend on any one particular choice of coordinate chart .",
    "furthermore , the uniqueness theorems of cartan @xcite , weyl @xcite , and vermeil @xcite imply the even more general result that @xmath289 for two constants @xmath290 and @xmath26 .",
    "hence , the euler - lagrange equation for @xmath283 , for variations away from the boundary , will be the same as the expression on the left .",
    "the expression on the left is called the einstein - hilbert action with cosmological constant and is well known to have euler - lagrange equation @xmath291 which is the equation for vacuum general relativity with a cosmological constant @xmath26 .    when the cosmological constant term is moved to the other side of the equation and interpreted as matter as in @xmath292 , this matter",
    "is given the name `` dark energy '' ( not to be confused with dark matter ) and has the same stress energy tensor as a fluid with positive energy density and negative pressure ( for @xmath293 ) .",
    "the idea that a fluid can have negative pressure is confusing to many , but the point is that dark energy is not a fluid .",
    "dark energy is simply the phenomenon resulting from the constant in equation [ eqn : cosmoeqn ] above .",
    "standard theory today assigns a very small but positive value for @xmath26 to explain the accelerating expansion of the universe .",

    "the above discussion provides the motivation for axiom [ a1 ] from section [ geometricmotivation ] .",
    "it is also helpful for understanding the implications of axiom [ a1 ] , which we discuss in the next appendix .",

    "it is a short exercise to show that given a general connection @xmath4 , its difference with the standard connection ( or , for that matter , any other connection ) @xmath296 is a tensor , meaning that @xmath297 is multilinear in each of its three slots .",
    "note that we have used the convenient notation @xmath298 .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for more about connections .",

    "@xmath306 means some quadratic functional of @xmath297 with coefficients in the metric @xmath2 .",
    "note that the above two expressions have no dependence on @xmath280 .",
    "however , axiom [ a1 ] does not allow us to add in a general expression of the form @xmath307 to the integrand .",
    "this is because the @xmath308 terms of equation [ eqn : defdlowered ] already contain first derivatives of the metric , so taking another derivative and squaring would introduce quadratic terms of second derivatives of the metric , which is not allowed by the axioms .",
    "however , the @xmath308 terms go away if we look at the torsion part of the @xmath297 tensor defined to be the @xmath297 tensor antisymmetrized in the first two indices .",
    "the torsion tensor ( with the third index lowered ) has components @xmath309 by the symmetry of the @xmath308 in the first two indices .",
    "again , we would like to consider some kind of derivative of this torsion tensor which we could then square .",
    "however , levi - civita covariant derivatives generically would introduce @xmath310 terms which , when squared , would not be allowed by our axioms .",
    "similarly , taking a @xmath4 covariant derivative would introduce @xmath311 terms before we squared , which is also not allowed by the axioms . as before , we need to find a way to take a derivative of some part of the torsion tensor which does not require a covariant derivative .",
    "define @xmath312 to be the fully antisymmetric part of the difference tensor @xmath297 ( and half the fully antisymmetric part of the torsion tensor @xmath260 .",
    "thus , @xmath313 are the components of a three form .",
    "hence , we can take the exterior derivative of @xmath314 to get @xmath315 which are the antisymmetric coefficients of the tensor @xmath316 which do not involve derivatives of the metric , just derivatives of @xmath317 .",
    "hence , functionals of the form @xmath318 are allowed by the axioms , up to a boundary term which is irrelevant for the euler - lagrange equations produced .",
    "[ classificationconjecture ] all functionals for which there exists a smooth metric and smooth connection which satisfy axiom [ a1 ] with that functional are of the form of equation [ generalform ] .",
    "we leave this as a very interesting geometric conjecture to study .",
    "we will take @xmath290 so that the resulting euler - lagrange equations for the metric are nondegenerate .",
    "without loss of generality , we may as well take @xmath319 .",
    "we comment that for generic quadratic expressions @xmath306 , all of the components of @xmath297 other than the fully antisymmetric part @xmath314 ( and irreducible components of the same type ) will have to be zero to satisfy their zeroth order euler - lagrange equations .",
    "the irreducible components of the difference tensor @xmath297 of the same type as @xmath314 are the three traces of @xmath297 . for our purposes here , we will consider the case where the quadratic expression does not have any cross terms so that these three traces are zero as well .",
    "we comment that two of these traces are in the metric compatibility part of the difference tensor and one is in the torsion part of the difference tensor .",
    "we consider this case because it is representative of the general case in that a generic quadratic expression will also lead to the einstein - klein - gordon equation with a cosmological constant .",
    "hence , in this representative case , @xmath320 which defines the connection @xmath4 in terms of @xmath314 and @xmath2 by equations [ eqn : defdlowered ] and [ eqn : christoffellowered ] .",
    "the action functional for @xmath314 and @xmath2 then reduces to @xmath321 where we note that the norm of a fully antisymmetric @xmath322-tensor @xmath69 is @xmath323 times that of the definition of the norm of @xmath69 as a @xmath322-form .",
    "next let @xmath324 where @xmath325 is a vector field , @xmath326 is the @xmath106 form dual to @xmath325 , and @xmath327 is the hodge star operator which takes @xmath322 forms to @xmath328 forms in dimension @xmath329 .",
    "we note that @xmath330 where @xmath331 denotes the divergence of @xmath325 .",
    "this amounts to a change of variables for the action from @xmath332 to @xmath333 .",
    "computing the euler - lagrange equation for variations of the vector field @xmath325 is straightforward using the divergence theorem , but computing the euler - lagrange equation for variations in the metric @xmath2 requires the following formulas .",
    "let @xmath334 be a family of metrics , and let @xmath335 .",

    "to arrive at a nontrivial equation for @xmath325 we need @xmath340 and to arrive at a deterministic equation for @xmath325 we need @xmath341 .",

    ", these equations are more easily understood if we define a new function @xmath25 such that @xmath343 so that by equation [ eqn : el2 ] @xmath344 using the above two equations and substituting into the original euler - lagrange system of equations , we get that @xmath345 has a solution if and only if the original system does .",
    "note that @xmath346 is the laplacian with respect to the lorentzian metric @xmath2 so that , modulo reparameterizations of the metric , the above equations are hyperbolic for the scalar function @xmath25 and the metric @xmath2 .",
    "we note that the above system has its own action @xmath347 note that @xmath348 is not quite the same action as @xmath349 since the last two terms have opposite signs .    by equations [ eqn : defdlowered ] , [ eqn : christoffellowered ] , [ eqn : d = gamma ] , [ eqn : defv ] , and [ eqn : v = gradf ]",
    ", the connection will have components @xmath350 in this representative case .",
    "we comment that if we had chosen a different quadratic expression of @xmath297 before `` with cross terms '' between the fully antisymmetric @xmath314 part of @xmath297 and the trace parts of @xmath297 , this formula would be modified .",
    "however , in all of these cases , we still get the einstein - klein - gordon equations with a cosmological constant being the relevant euler - lagrange equations .",
    "the only difference is the interpretation of what the connection is in equation [ connectionformula ] .",
    "however , so far it is not clear how the connection manifests itself physically , other than gravitationally , which is effectively the same in all of these cases .    as a last step ,",
    "we introduce new constants @xmath27 and @xmath28 defined such that @xmath351 plugging these new constants into equations [ eqn:1 ] and [ eqn:2 ] give us the einstein - klein - gordon equations with a cosmological constant in geometrized units with the gravitational constant and the speed of light set to one , which are @xmath352 where @xmath24 is the einstein curvature tensor , @xmath25 is the scalar field representing dark matter , @xmath26 is the cosmological constant , and @xmath27 is a new fundamental constant of nature whose value has yet to be determined . the other constant @xmath28 is not a fundamental constant of nature as it can easily be absorbed into @xmath25 , but simply is present for convenience and represents the energy density of an oscillating scalar field of magnitude one which is solely a function of @xmath29 .",
    "it is perfectly fine to set @xmath28 equal to one , just as we have done to the speed of light and the gravitational constant .",
    "also , note that since @xmath30 equation [ eqn : kg2 ] is hyperbolic in @xmath25 when the metric has signature @xmath3 .",
    "there are compelling geometric and physical motivations to generalize axiom [ a1 ] as follows .",
    "[ a2 ] for all coordinate charts @xmath10 and open sets @xmath11 whose closure is compact and in the interior of @xmath12 , @xmath13 is a critical point of the functional @xmath353 with respect to smooth variations of the metric and connection compactly supported in @xmath11 , for some fixed quadratic functional @xmath354 with coefficients in @xmath355 .",
    "we remind the reader that @xmath9 as before .",
    "the geometric motivation for this generalization is that axiom [ a1 ] actually changes completely if we redefine @xmath356 and @xmath357 similarly .",
    "that is , we get different theories resulting from the axiom depending on which of the tensor indices ( the first and the third ) of @xmath317 we raise or lower .",
    "the theory with all lowered indices seems most interesting , so that has been the topic of this paper .",
    "the other theories are interesting too , but result in a slight modification of the einstein - maxwell equations with a cosmological constant , which is less exciting than a geometric theory of dark matter .",
    "of course these other theories with raised indices are interesting to study as well .",
    "on the other hand , if the quadratic expression @xmath358 is allowed to have coefficients in @xmath359 as well as @xmath16 , then this issue of raising and lowering indices becomes irrelevant as the same theory is produced in all cases .",
    "furthermore , this generalized axiom also generalizes these other theories into one bigger theory .",
    "hence , it is very natural geometrically to prefer this second axiom .",
    "we would have introduced this axiom earlier , but we did not want to complicate things unnecessarily .",
    "of course everything we have already studied about scalar field dark matter will still be a part of this generalized theory , but there will be ( at least ) two additional matter fields as well , which is a physical motivation for being intrigued by this latest axiom .",
    "we observe that actions of the form @xmath360 up to an irrelevant boundary term , are allowed by these axioms , and we conjecture that these are all of the actions compatible with axiom [ a2 ] .",
    "we leave this as another interesting conjecture to study",
    ".    if the above conjecture is correct , then the resulting matter fields generically will be the irreducible components of the torsion tensor @xmath260 .",
    "the fully antisymmetric part , studied in this paper , leads to a scalar field model of dark matter .",
    "the trace part , which will be a @xmath106 form , is reminiscent of the vector potential @xmath106 form @xmath361 of electromagnetism .",
    "the final matter field , which is everything left over , can be thought of as a @xmath362 tensor which is antisymmetric in the first two indices , antisymmetrizes to zero , and has zero trace .",
    "we have no idea how to interpret this physically , but this is certainly an interesting direction to pursue .",
    "in this appendix we prove the following theorem , stated originally in section [ cosmologicalpredictions ] .",
    "suppose that the spacetime metric is both homogeneous and isotropic , and hence is the friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker metric @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the constant curvature metric of curvature @xmath40 .",
    "if @xmath41 is a real - valued solution to the klein - gordon equation ( equation [ eqn : kg ] with mass term @xmath27 ) with a stress - energy tensor which is isotropic , then @xmath25 is solely a function of @xmath29 .",
    "furthermore , if we let @xmath42 be the hubble constant ( which of course is actually a function of @xmath29 ) , and @xmath43 and @xmath44 be the energy density and pressure of the scalar field at each point , then @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 where @xmath48 are two zeros of @xmath25 ( for example , two consecutive zeros ) .    _",
    "proof : _ we first prove that @xmath25 is only a function of @xmath29 . by equation [ eqn : ee ] ,",
    "the stress - energy tensor @xmath260 of the real scalar field is given by @xmath363 for this tensor to be isotropic , the first term in the above expression must be isotropic .",
    "hence , @xmath364 must be a multiple of @xmath147 . integrating @xmath364 along the level sets of @xmath29",
    "proves that @xmath25 is constant on the level sets of @xmath29 .",
    "hence , @xmath25 is a function of @xmath29 ( which proves that the stress - energy tensor of the scalar field is homogeneous as well ) .    then since @xmath365 and hence @xmath366 , we get @xmath367 where @xmath368 is the energy density and @xmath369 is the pressure of the scalar field , where @xmath370 is any unit vector perpendicular to the time direction .    by equation [ eqn : kg ] and the formula for the metric laplacian , @xmath371 since @xmath372 and @xmath42 .",
    "we can then use this result in the calculation below , @xmath373 where we have integrated by parts twice and have not picked up any boundary terms since @xmath374 .",
    "it follows that @xmath375 and @xmath376 proving the theorem .",
    "we comment that the complex scalar field case is very similar to the above statement since a complex scalar field with quadratic potential is precisely equivalent to two independent real scalar fields ( given by the real and complex parts of the complex scalar field ) .",
    "complex scalar fields can be defined which have much less oscillations of the pressure ( which occurs when the real and complex parts of the field are half a period out of phase with one another with the same magnitudes ) , but since real fields are special cases of complex fields , for example , this phenomenon is not generically the case .",
    "we also comment about out assumption that the stress - energy tensor of the real scalar field is isotropic .",
    "if this scalar field were the only matter in the universe , then it would follow from the einstein equation that the stress energy tensor of the scalar field was both homogeneous and isotropic , assuming the spacetime was both of these .",
    "however , we want our theorem to be compatible with other matter as well . in this case",
    ", as long as the other matter fields have isotropic stress - energy tensors , it still follows from the einstein equation that the stress - energy tensor of the scalar field dark matter is isotropic .",
    "specifically , since dark energy due to the cosmological constant is always isotropic ( and homogeneous ) , it follows that a model universe with just dark matter and dark energy which was homogeneous and isotropic would imply that the scalar field dark matter s stress - energy tensor was isotropic .",
    "hence , this is a very general assumption when modeling homogeneous , isotropic spacetimes .",
