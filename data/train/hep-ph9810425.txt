    "a bonus of our formalism is the possibility of discussing the @xmath362 asymmetry @xcite in the longitudinally polarized and transversity distributions by combining the pp and pd drell - yan data .",
    "it is well known that the proton - deuteron drell - yan asymmetry is sensitive to the ratio @xmath362 in the unpolarized case .",
    "in fact , the recent e866 experimental data @xcite clearly showed the ratio @xmath362 as a function of the momentum fraction @xmath19 . in the same way , it is in principle possible to study the polarized antiquark asymmetries @xmath363 and @xmath364 by the pp and pd drell - yan processes in addition to the @xmath256 production studies ( only for @xmath363 @xcite ) at rhic . however , the polarized pd formalism had not been available until our studies .",
    "it is now possible to discuss the relation between the polarized p - d drell - yan asymmetry and the polarized flavor asymmetry .",
    "because the structure functions of the spin-1 hadrons have not been well studied , it is important to investigate more about their spin structure theoretically .",
    "furthermore , the experimental possibility of the polarized pd reactions should be discussed seriously , especially at rhic @xcite .",
    "we have shown that 108 structure functions can be studied in the polarized drell - yan processes with spin-1/2 and spin-1 hadrons .",
    "because the number is 48 in the reactions of spin-1/2 hadrons , there are 60 new structure functions . after integrating over @xmath0 or after taking the limit @xmath1 , we have shown that 22 structure functions exist by two independent methods with the requirements of hermiticity , parity conservation , and time - reversal invariance .",
    "because the number is 11 in the processes of spin-1/2 hadrons , there are 11 new structure functions in the reactions of spin-1/2 and spin-1 hadrons .",
    "we have shown that these are related to the tensor structure of the spin-1 hadron and they can be measured by the quadrupole polarization experiments . a number of spin asymmetries were shown for extracting the new structure functions .",
    "the quadrupole spin asymmetries with the @xmath263 , @xmath264 , and @xmath265 polarizations are valuable for measuring the tensor structure functions .",
    "it is also interesting to find the structure functions for the intermediate polarizations in the sense that they do not contribute to the longitudinally and transversely polarized cross sections . in this paper , we have discussed generally what kind of structure functions is investigated in the polarized processes with spin-1/2 and spin-1 hadrons .",
    "we hope that our studies will be materialized experimentally as the polarized proton - deuteron reactions in the rhic - spin project and also other future projects .",
