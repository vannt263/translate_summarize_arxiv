    "spectropolarimetry offers a direct probe of early - time sn geometry since a hot , young sn atmosphere is dominated by electron scattering , which by its nature is highly polarizing . for an unresolved source that has a spherical distribution of scattering electrons ,",
    "the directional components of the electric vectors of the scattered photons cancel exactly , yielding zero net linear polarization .",
    "any asymmetry in the distribution of the scattering electrons , or of absorbing material overlying the electron - scattering atmosphere , results in incomplete cancellation , and produces a net polarization ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "type ii - plateau supernovae ( sne  ii - p ) are the canonical core - collapse events that arise from isolated red supergiant stars @xcite .",
    "the precise nature of the mechanism responsible for the stellar explosion , however , remains the subject of considerable debate @xcite .",
    "one key diagnostic is explosion geometry .",
    "a global asphericity of sn ejecta will manifest itself through two main spectropolarimetric signatures .",
    "first , there will be significant polarization in spectral regions not dominated by line opacity .",
    "for sne  ii - p , this includes the broad spectral region 68008200  .",
    "strong emission lines should generally be unpolarized , since directional information is lost as photons are absorbed and reemitted in a line @xcite ( see , however , * ? ? ?",
    "finally , polarization increases are anticipated in the troughs of strong p - cygni absorption lines .",
    "this results primarily from selective blocking of more forward - scattered and , hence , less polarized , light in the trough regions .",
    "a critical point to bear in mind is that the longer one waits after the explosion , the deeper into the ejecta one can see . for sne ii - p ,",
    "the story unfolds over an extended time period as the photosphere recedes ( in mass coordinates ) back through the ejecta as the hydrogen recombination front progresses from the outside inwards through the thick hydrogen envelope .",
    "the transition from the opaque , `` photospheric '' phase to the transparent , `` nebular phase '' is signaled by the sudden drop in luminosity that marks the end of the photometric plateau .    in initial studies ,",
    "sne  ii - p were found to have minimal intrinsic polarizations at the generally early times at which they were observed .",
    "low - contrast line features were sometimes seen in the data , but no obvious strong continuum polarization was found ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; for a recent review of sn spectropolarimetry of all types , see @xcite .",
    "the situation changed dramatically with observations of sn  2004dj , however , for which a sudden `` spike '' in polarization was seen during the steepest part of the descent off of the plateau @xcite .",
    "using existing models @xcite , it was concluded that the late onset of the polarization suggested a fundamentally non - spherical explosion , with the asphericity cloaked at early times by the massive , opaque , hydrogen envelope .",
    "an obvious observational question presented itself : was sn  2004dj a unique ( or rare ) event ? or , would other similarly well - observed sne  ii - p display similar behavior ?",
    "@xcite and @xcite provide partial answers from analysis of four additional sne  ii - p : three ( sne 2006my , 2006ov , and 2007aa ) exhibit large , late - time ( end of photometric plateau and beyond ; ) polarization @xcite , while one ( sn  2004et ) exhibits strong and temporally increasing polarization that began at least three months before the end of its plateau phase @xcite .",
    "detailed comparison of these datasets with that of sn  2004dj is hindered , however , by modest temporal sampling or phase coverage .",
    "here we show initial results from our program to obtain critically sampled spectropolarimetry of sne  ii - p with the european southern observatory very large telescope .",
    "figure  1 presents nine spectropolarimetric epochs for our most well observed sn  ii - p , sn  2008bk , along with the data of sn  2004dj from @xcite . unlike the case for sn  2004dj ,",
    "sn  2008bk was strongly polarized well _ before _ the end of the plateau ( much like sn  2004et ) , with the level rising through the plateau . despite the different temporal behavior ,",
    "it is intriguing that at the point of maximum recorded polarization ( i.e. , day 31 with respect to the end of the plateau for sn  2004dj and day -21 for sn  2008bk ) the spectropolarimetric _ signatures _ of sn  2008bk are virtually identical to those of sn  2004dj .",
    "this similarity may suggest a common cause  or , at least , geometry . following the plateau drop - off",
    ", the polarization of sn  2008bk remains remarkably constant .",
    "in fact , although not shown in figure  1 , the spectropolarimetry from days 9 through 120 post - plateau ( epochs 5 through 9 ) are virtually indistinguishable from one another .",
    "this is quite different from the behavior of sn  2004dj .",
    "-band magnitude of sn  2004dj ; the expected polarization derived from the models of @xcite and discussed in the text is also shown ( filled triangles connected by a dashed line ) . *",
    "bottom : * same as the top , but for sn  2008bk .",
    "note that an interstellar polarization ( isp ) of @xmath0 has been removed from the sn  2004dj data @xcite , whereas no isp has been removed from the sn  2008bk data , because it is estimated to be @xmath1 from the depolarizations seen across strong emission lines ( e.g. , h@xmath2 , ca  ii ) at all epochs . ]",
    "we have developed non - local - thermodynamic equilibrium , time - dependent radiative - transfer simulations specifically crafted for sne  ii - p @xcite .",
    "the simulations , based on the one - dimensional sn  ii - p models of @xcite , compute the expected polarization ( in both lines and continuum ) as a function of time for an asphericity generated by a latitudinal density enhancement .",
    "a significant finding is that temporal polarization changes in sne  ii - p do not _ necessarily _ implicate a change in the asymmetry of the ejecta .",
    "for instance , in figure  1 ( top , right ) we include the expected temporal evolution of the continuum polarization for an sn  ii - p with an oblate equator - to - pole density enhancement of 1.67 , viewed edge - on .",
    "this model reproduces what is observed for sn  2004dj quite well , with the sudden `` spike '' in polarization now explained not by a dramatic increase in asphericity but , rather , by the sharp reduction in optical depth ( i.e. , fewer electron scatters for outgoing photons ) that occurs at the plateau s end . the post - plateau polarization decline is also reproduced as a consequence of the expected @xmath3 dependence of the ejecta optical depth during the nebular phase @xcite .",
    "while models with a dominant and fixed large - scale asymmetry fit the polarization behavior of sn  2004dj , the substantial early time polarization seen in sn  2008bk ( and sn  2004et ) is not replicated ; in fact , current models with equator - to - pole density enhancements as extreme as 5.0 are unable to produce significant ( i.e. , > 0.1% ) polarization during the mid - plateau @xcite .",
    "the persistent late - time polarization seen in sn  2008bk also presents a modeling challenge .",
    "it is worth noting that , in addition to their spectropolarimetric differences , sne  2008bk , 2004dj , and 2004et also exhibit photometric and spectroscopic differences @xcite , some of which are clearly evident for sn  2004dj and sn  2008bk in figure  1 , such as the rapidity of the plateau drop - off .",
    "these differences may be associated with explosion physics but might also be related to the progenitor s core structure and the @xmath4-mixing properties ( morphology , amount , depth below the hydrogen - rich envelope ; see @xcite ) as well .",
    "it is hoped that with the benefit of further modeling we may begin to connect all of these parameters and develop a consistent interpretation of the asymmetries indicated by the polarization of sne  ii - p .",
