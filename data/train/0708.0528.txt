    "helical bundles of mreb may contribute to the spatial localization of associated mrec , mred , and pbp2 that , in turn , help to coordinate cell wall synthesis .",
    "it has also been suggested that helical filaments of mreb paralogues under tension can lead to spiral morphologies @xcite .",
    "disruption of mreb leads to loss of proper polar localization of a number of proteins such as the chemotaxis protein tar and the _ shigella flexneri _ virulence factor icsa in  @xcite , and three integral membrane proteins ( plec , divj , ccka ) in   @xcite .",
    "polar localization in  was disrupted by either underexpression or overexpression of mreb .",
    "when normal mreb expression was returned , polar localization was re - established @xcite .",

    "mreb , in contrast , does not have any clearly identified motor proteins or associated proteins that regulate polymerization . notably , mreb filaments spontaneously bundle _ in vitro _ without associated proteins @xcite .",
    "the varied roles of mreb inside bacterial cells raise some basic questions .",

    "specifically , must we invoke yet - to - be discovered prokaryotic motor proteins or accessory proteins controlling mreb polymerization to explain mreb - related polar localization of proteins such as tar , icsa , divj , plec , and ccka ?",
    "finally , does the small size of the bacterial cell affect mreb polymerization , as compared to actin polymerization in much larger eukaryotic cells ?    to address these questions , we present a model of the mreb helix with stochastic polymerization dynamics of protofilaments together with global elasticity of a helical mreb bundle constrained by the bacterial cell wall .",
    "our model provides a quantitative relationship between helical pitch , total abundance of mreb protein in a particular cell and the thickness of the protofilament bundles .",
    "the bundled mreb protofilaments are in a dynamical steady - state , and undergo constant advection as the polymerized subunits treadmill .",
    "we discuss how this advection could be harnessed for targeted polar localization without motor proteins .",
    "the steady - state dynamics also allow us to address other dynamical processes such as protein turnover in frap experiments @xcite or recovery from a22-induced disruptions of the mreb helix @xcite .",

    "this force - dependent polymerization rate can also be obtained from thermodynamic arguments in the high - force limit @xcite .",
    "we apply it to mreb polymerization dynamics within the cell .    in the absence of force",
    ", each filament grows above , and shrinks below , the critical cytoplasmic concentration @xmath21 the asymmetry between the polymerization and depolymerization rates at barbed and pointed ends leads to treadmilling , in which the filament length remains constant while depolymerization from the pointed end is balanced by polymerization at the barbed end @xcite .",
    "the force - independent treadmilling rate is @xcite @xmath22 if the filament position is fixed , treadmilling results in a net advection of all polymerized monomers towards the pointed end .",
    "the kinetic rate constants for mreb polymerization are yet to be determined explicitly , but appear to differ significantly from eukaryotic actin .",
    "in addition to spontaneously nucleating and bundling with much greater ease than actin , purified mreb from _ thermotoga maritima _ polymerizes  faster and exhibits a much lower critical concentration ( @xmath23 @xcite compared with @xmath24 @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless ,  observations of single molecule motion of mreb in  suggest that the treadmilling rate is similar to actin @xcite . by starting with  rate constants from eukaryotic actin @xcite and scaling the on - rates by a factor of @xmath25",

    "t. maritima_. following observations that the treadmilling rate is @xmath26 @xcite , we further scale all four rates by @xmath27  preserving the mreb treadmilling rate . these scalings preserve the pointed / barbed - end asymmetries of actin and represent the least - intrusive modification of actin polymerization dynamics to make it consistent with observed mreb dynamics .",
    "the resulting barbed - end polymerization rate constant , @xmath28 ( see table  1 ) , is close to the diffusion limit @xcite indicating that the pointed / barbed - end asymmetries of mreb may differ significantly from actin and/or that the appropriate @xmath29 for _ in vivo _ measurements may be significantly above the _ t. maritima _ value . however , our qualitative results do not depend on the precise parameter values used in this paper .",

    "[ fig::ultrastructures]c leads to tapered bundles as antiparallel protofilaments , which can not slide past each other , treadmill in opposite directions .",
    "such tapering is not seen experimentally . in this paper",
    "we therefore consider ultrastructures composed of polarized bundle(s ) of protofilaments : either one bundle ( fig .  [ fig::ultrastructures]a ) or two antiparallel bundles that freely slide with respect to each other ( fig .",
    "[ fig::ultrastructures]d ) .",
    "since the elastic and polymerization properties of the second case follow straight - forwardly from the former , we will mostly focus on a single polarized non - slipping filament bundle ( fig .",
    "[ fig::ultrastructures]a ) and revisit the possibility of antiparallel bundles slipping with respect to each other in the final discussion .",
    "it is quite possible that individual mreb protofilaments do not continuously extend from one end of the bacterial cell to the other , similar to actin cables in yeast @xcite .",
    "indeed , in  individual protofilaments appear to be much shorter than the cell length , only @xmath32 nm on average @xcite . for the purposes of our model , the mechanical and end - polymerization properties of discontinuous bundles of protofilaments are equivalent to bundles of continuous protofilaments .",
    "systematic heterogeneities in the mreb helix thickness have not been reported , but our model does not depend on how the cell regulates the average number of protofilaments in a cross - section of the filament bundle .",
    "protofilament association , dissociation and nucleation are thus implicitly included in our model .",
    "polymerization and depolymerization away from the filament edges may occur and do not affect our steady - state results : whatever the distribution of lateral exchange , in steady state monomer incorporation and separation are balanced .",
    "of course , significant numbers of active protofilament tips away from the cell poles can affect the dynamical timescales that we discuss .",

    ", mreb typically polymerizes into straight filaments @xcite .",
    "however , mreb adopts ring - like coiled configurations in spherical mutants of normally rod - shaped organisms @xcite , and forms helices in rod - shaped cells @xcite .",
    "these observations suggest that normally straight elastic mreb protofilaments may simply buckle into helices inside the cylindrical confinement provided by the relatively hard cell wall .",

    "the timescales of condensation and recovery are @xmath129 minutes in  which is considerably longer than a22-induced breakdown .",
    "the maximum filament - end force needed to compress a typical mreb helix in our model from @xmath53 to a midcell spiral is @xmath130 , and is comparable to the force generated by the rna polymerase @xcite and the anchoring forces of integral membrane proteins @xcite .",
    "thus , both motor driven compression and depolymerization are plausible mechanisms for the observed midcell condensation .",

    "helices are observed increasingly often within bacteria @xcite and our model suggests an elastic mechanism for maintaining such helicity when filament bundles extend the length of the cell . for mreb , our model predicts that the observed pitches and protein abundance are consistent with bundles of @xmath131 protofilaments thick .",
    "helical pitch is directly observable through fluorescence microscopy , and the total abundance of mreb can be controlled by an inducible promoter @xcite .",
    "increasing the mreb expression level should systematically decrease the pitch according to the curves in fig .",
    "[ fig::pvsn0 ] . we have assumed a cytoplasmic pool of monomers , while there is evidence of an oligomeric pool of mbl in  @xcite .",

    "filament treadmilling is ongoing in the steady - state .",
    "a significant result is that parts of the filament may travel faster than the bulk treadmilling rate , even in the opposite direction , while other parts may travel much slower . since the cytoplasmic concentration is held above the critical concentration of free protofilaments by the constraining forces at the filament tips , the barbed end of protofilaments that associate laterally with the mreb bundles can travel at speeds greater than the bulk advection speed .",
    "these speeds are fast enough to be biologically relevant in the transport of polar - targeted proteins and the origin - proximal part of the chromosome .",
    "these transport modes may explain how mreb cables transport passengers without motor proteins , and may also reconcile experimental observations of very different speeds of mreb protofilaments : fast speeds of @xmath132 @xcite may correspond to the lateral protofilaments described above , while slow speeds comparable to actin treadmilling speeds @xcite may correspond to protofilaments involved in the bulk of the cables .",
    "it also suggests that observations of bidirectional transport along mreb cables @xcite does not necessarily rule out a single polarized mreb bundle .",
    "it has been suggested that cell polarity arises from the inherent polarity of mreb polymers @xcite .",
    "the different modes of transport in our model provide a mechanism for translating the polarity of a cable to the entire cell .",

    "proteins destined for the other pole bind to the barbed ends of free protofilaments and are naturally translocated towards the  barbed \" pole . we have demonstrated that such translocation happens within a physiologically relevant timescale .",
    "such selective targeting requires polarized mreb filaments .",

    "this is consistent with a single polarized mreb cable in .",
    "we are not aware of evidence about mreb cable polarization in .",
    "while frap recovery of mbl cables in  is symmetric @xcite , this could be due to lateral exchange and/or the motion of laterally associated protofilaments .",
    "any transport along treadmilling mreb bundles would require either direct association of targeted proteins with mreb , or association through an intermediary .",
    "interactions of only a few cytoplasmic proteins with mreb have been identified .",
    "these include setb , implicated in chromosome segregation @xcite , rna polymerase @xcite , and the chaperonin groel @xcite .",
    "of these , groel is known to interact with a large number of cytoplasmic proteins @xcite , while rna polymerase is needed for their transcription .",
    "groel is localized to polar and septal regions in  @xcite while rnap is associated with nucleoids in punctate patterns similar to those seen for helically distributed proteins @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to see if any of these mreb associated cytoplasmic proteins exhibit pole directed transport within bacterial cells .",
    "transport speeds may be decreased if short protofilaments necessitate multiple binding and release events to translocate from one pole to the other .",
    "tip - directed transport also allows for direct recruitment to free protofilament tips , such as at the bundle ends .",
    "the details of bundle ultrastructure and of protein translocation will be required to sort out these competing effects .",
    "we have shown that many of the dynamical phenomenon associated with mreb , including polar protein localization , mreb helix dissolution and reformation , and frap studies , could result from polymerization and treadmilling of bundled mreb protofilaments without motor proteins . in order to make precise quantitative predictions , direct measurements of the kinetic rate constants for",
