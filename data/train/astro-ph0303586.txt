    "the chemical evolution of galaxies is a long - standing open question in astronomy ( audouze & tinsley 1976 ) . of all atomic species , oxygen , which is mainly produced in type ii supernovae ,",
    "has proven to be the most useful element for probing the astration of the ism by massive stars , both because of its large abundance and origin ( for a review see henry & worthey 1999 ) .",
    "the value of the oxygen abundance within a few hundred parsec from the sun has been thoroughly investigated in the past two decades toward dozens of sight lines with _ copernicus _ ( de boer et al .",
    "1981 , york et al .",
    "1983 , keenan et al .",
    "1985 ) , _ hst _ ( meyer et al . 1998 , cartledge et al . 2001 ) and _ fuse _ ( moos et al . 2002 , and references therein ) .",
    "the accurate study by meyer et al . ( 1998 ) revealed a well mixed medium within 500 pc from the sun : @xmath12 ppm ( error in the mean ) .",
    "note that this value has been corrected linearly with an updated f - value ( see  3.3 ) .",
    "however , investigations of more distant sight lines with the fuv absorption technique were limited by the unknown higher molecular fractions and the fainter background continua .    measurements of oxygen abundances beyond 1 kpc have been carried out in two different environments : h  ii regions and b star atmospheres . to this day",
    ", these methods do not agree on a single picture for the oxygen distribution in the disk . in the most recent survey of the oxygen abundance in galactic h  ii regions , deharveng et al .",
    "( 2001 ) confirm the existence of a metalicity gradient from the center out to 18 kpc in the outer disk and find a local abundance consistent with ism investigations .",
    "however they point out that their value is highly dependent on the model adopted for the electron temperature in the h  ii region . as for the b star surveys ,",
    "the considerable scatter in the measurements makes it difficult to pin down an accurate value for the gradient ( smartt & rolleston 1997 , primas et al .",
    "2001 ) while , at the same time , the origin of the scatter is still debated .    with the high sensitivity of _ fuse _ ( 10,000 times more sensitive than _ copernicus _ ; see moos et al . 2000 ) it is now possible to probe the molecular hydrogen content of the ism beyond 1 kpc and in denser media as well .",
    "along with lyman-@xmath1  data from the stis instrument , this allows us to obtain accurate total hydrogen column densities and hence derive a reliable o / h ratio . since oxygen and hydrogen have about the same ionization potential ,",
    "no ionization correction is needed and the analysis is largely model independent .",
    "the principal question we try to answer in this work is the robustness of a constant o / h for large sight line distances .",
    "the sight lines studied sample a vast diversity of environments .",
    "the enhanced depletion of oxygen in dust grains along the densest sight lines , the imprint of the galactic gradient along the most distant sight lines and inefficient mixing processes are expected to play significant roles in the final scatter .    in this paper , we present new o / h measurements toward 19 lines of sight ( table 1 ) obtained with data from _ fuse _ and stis .",
    "for each one of these sight lines we performed a complete analysis of the o  i , h  i , and h@xmath0 content , using different techniques .",
    "the datasets and the reduction processing are described in  2 .",
    "the analysis of o  i , h  i , and h@xmath13 are presented in  3 . in ",
    "4 the results are discussed in view of the most recent investigations .",
    "discussions about the dust content and local oxygen deficit are given in  5 and conclusions are given in  6 .",
    "in this work , we use high - resolution stis echelle observations of 19 stars ( table 1 ) to derive the column densities of h  i , o  i , and other atomic species . the design and construction of stis are described by woodgate et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , while information about the on - orbit performance of stis is summarized by kimble et al .",
    "a summary of the stis observations is given in table 2 .",
    "all observations in this work used the far - ultraviolet mama detector with the e140h grating . because the datasets are drawn from several programs , three different apertures were used in obtaining the data .",
    "the @xmath14 aperture ( the so - called `` jenkins slit '' ) provides a spectral resolution of @xmath15 ( velocity resolution of @xmath16  km  s@xmath6 , fwhm ) .",
    "these datasets have been discussed by jenkins & tripp ( 2001 ) .",
    "the remainder of the data , taken through the @xmath17 or @xmath18 apertures , provide a spectral resolution of @xmath19 ( velocity resolution of @xmath20  km  s@xmath6 , fwhm ) .",
    "data taken through the latter apertures have a line spread function ( lsf ) with power in a halo extending @xmath21 km  s@xmath6 from line center .",
    "the lsf for all of the data have weak , broad wings stretching to @xmath22 km  s@xmath6 ( see the stis instrument handbook ) .",
    "the data were calibrated and extracted and the background estimated as described by howk & sembach ( 2000a ) . for spectral regions covered in multiple orders , or when more than one observation existed , we co - added the flux - calibrated data weighting each spectrum by the inverse square of its error .",
    "this work makes use of _ fuse _ observations for deriving molecular hydrogen column densities along the 19 lines of sight studied .",
    "these column densities are in turn used to derive the total ( atomic+molecular ) hydrogen column densities along each sight line .",
    "the _ fuse _ mission , its planning and on - orbit performance are discussed by moos et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and sahnow et al .",
    "briefly , the _ fuse _ observatory consists of four co - aligned prime - focus telescopes and rowland - circle spectrographs that produce spectra over the wavelength range 905 - 1187    with a spectral resolution of @xmath23  15 - 20 km  s@xmath6 for point sources ( depending on the wavelength ) .",
    "two of the optical channels employ sic coatings providing reflectivity in the wavelength range @xmath23  905 - 1090    while the other two have lif coatings for maximum sensitivity above 1000   .",
    "dispersed light is focused onto two photon - counting microchannel plate detectors .",
    "table 3 presents a summary of the _ fuse _",
    "observations used in this work .",
    "all of the datasets were obtained through the large 30@xmath330  ( lwrs ) aperture . the two - dimensional _ fuse _ spectral images were processed using the standard calfuse pipeline ( version 1.8.7 ) .",
    "the reduction and calibration procedure includes thermal drift correction , geometric distortion correction , heliocentric velocity correction , dead time correction , and wavelength and flux calibration .",
    "the observations of each star were broken into several sub - exposures , which were aligned by cross - correlating the individual spectra over a short wavelength range that contained prominent spectral features .",
    "the aligned sub - exposures were co - added , weighting each by the exposure time .",
    "no co - addition of data from different channels was performed ; instead each channel was used independently in the fitting procedure as a different measurement .",
    "in this section we discuss the analysis of atomic species o  i , h  i , kr  i , and molecular hydrogen ( h@xmath13 ) . whenever possible we compare our results with those found in the literature . the analysis of h  i ( from stis data ) and h@xmath0 ( from _ fuse _ data ) are described respectively in sections  3.1 and  3.2 .",
    " 3.3 discusses the analysis of o  i with other atomic species ( using stis data ) .",
    "one of the most important factors limiting the accurate measurement of the o / h ratio is the uncertainty associated with the available h  i measurements , which are derived primarily from analyses of the damping wings of h  i lyman-@xmath1 .",
    "for ob stars , the uncertainties in the h  i measurements are largely systematic , particularly due to the complexity of the stellar continuum against which the interstellar lyman-@xmath1  is viewed .",
    "the systematic uncertainties can be minimized , however , in some cases by using high signal - to - noise datasets to probe further into the core of the lyman-@xmath1  profile ( e.g. , howk et al .",
    "1999a ) .",
    "we have endeavored to measure the h  i column densities towards the stars in our sample , making use of the stis e140h spectra discussed above . because the lyman-@xmath1  transition covers several  , we have co - added several echelle orders for our analysis .",
    "the calstis flux calibration of the e140h data shows a systematic error in that the short wavelength portion of an order @xmath24 shows a larger flux than the long wavelength portion of the order @xmath25 .",
    "we have corrected this by applying a polynomial flux correction to each order .",
    "the correction was assumed to be the same for each order within an observation and derived from a comparison of stis and ghrs data of hd218915 .",
    "unfortunately no other ghrs target was available for this comparison but we are confident in our correction for it produces a symmetrical profile of the lyman-@xmath1  transition in each spectrum .",
    "we used a weighted average scheme to combine adjacent flux - corrected orders .",
    "given the confusing presence of stellar photospheric and wind lines in the region near interstellar lyman-@xmath1 , we make use of the continuum reconstruction method ( bohlin 1975 ; diplas and savage 1994 ; howk et al",
    ". 1999a ) for deriving n(h  i ) .",
    "this method multiplies the observed lyman-@xmath1  profile by @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the optical depth as a function of wavelength .",
    "the h  i column density is determined by the value of @xmath28 $ ] which best reconstructs the damping wings of lyman-@xmath1  to the estimated position of the stellar continuum .",
    "the method relies on human judgment to set the stellar continuum , which is not rigorously defined given the undulating stellar absorption features . for each of the stars ,",
    "two authors have independently determined the @xmath11  2  @xmath9 limits following howk et al .",
    "( 1999a ) with the final value being negotiated between them .",
    "the @xmath11  2  @xmath9 limits are those column densities which showed reconstructed continua that were highly implausible .",
    "the best fit values were then calculated to be the midpoint , assuming symmetric errors .",
    "finally , we find that our column densities are , in all cases , within @xmath29 of those given by diplas & savage ( 1994 ) .",
    "however , the higher signal to noise ratio of our _ hst _ data allows us to use regions closer to the line core , leading to smaller systematic uncertainties .",
    "an example of this procedure is shown in figure 1 , where the reconstructed continua for hd210839 are displayed .",
    "one potential difficulty in the h  i analysis is the contamination of the ism lyman-@xmath1  profile by stellar h  i. in particular , for stars earlier than b2 the contamination is important for `` low '' interstellar column densities ( @xmath30 ; see diplas and savage 1994 ) .",
    "since our sight lines probe long pathlengths , most of which are in the galactic disk , we are always in the regime where @xmath31 .",
    "therefore , the corrections for stellar lyman-@xmath1  are always negligible .",
    "we have tested the consistency of our lyman-@xmath1  h  i analysis for nine of our targets using the higher - order lyman transitions in the _ fuse _ spectra of these stars . for the other stars , the blending of h@xmath0 and h  i is too severe to adequately check the n(h  i ) determination .",
    "for each of these nine targets , we constructed a complete model of the line of sight ( velocity components , atomic and molecular content ) which was then compared with the _ fuse _ profiles of the weaker h  i transitions .",
    "these models provided two checks of our lyman-@xmath1  analysis : first , they confirmed , using the weak damping wings of lyman-@xmath32 , the total h  i column derived from the stis data ( although with larger uncertainties ) ; second , modeling the high - order lines ruled out the existence of high velocity , low-@xmath33 components which might adversely affect our simple assumptions about the distribution of lyman-@xmath1  optical depth with wavelength ( see appendix a of howk et al .",
    "this eliminated a potentially significant bias in our h  i column density determinations caused by hot , low column - density clouds similar to those discussed in this context by lemoine et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and vidal - madjar & ferlet ( 2002 ) for sight lines through the local ism .      the _ fuse _ bandpass contains some 20 ro - vibrational bands of molecular hydrogen ( see , e.g. , shull et al .",
    "2000 ; tumlinson et al .",
    "2002 ) which can be used for the determination of h@xmath0  column densities .",
    "most of the sight lines studied here lie predominantly within the galactic disk and have quite high molecular hydrogen column densities .",
    "we adopt wavelengths , oscillator strengths , and damping constants for the molecular hydrogen transitions from abgrall et al .",
    "( 1993a ) for the lyman system and abgrall et al .",
    "( 1993b ) for the werner system .    our analysis of h@xmath0  with the _ fuse _ data makes use of the @xmath34 profile fitting software ( lemoine et al .",
    "2002 , hbrard et al .",
    "2002a ) to fit the h@xmath0  line profiles assuming a single maxwellian component .",
    "we assume that the _ fuse _ lsf is well described by a single gaussian with a fwhm of 20 km  s@xmath6 . while this is an oversimplification of the _ fuse _ lsf ( see wood et al .",
    "2002 , hbrard et al .",
    "2002a ) , it is sufficient for our purposes .",
    "in the course of determining the h@xmath0  content , we proceed in two steps . first , we analyse the population of the rotational levels j=2 and 3 that contain information on the excitation temperature within the gas .",
    "although most of the corresponding absorption lines are deeply saturated , a few lines are weak enough to be near the linear part of the curve of growth , thereby allowing us to get reliable column density estimates .",
    "the profile fitting is done simultaneously over the different absorption lines ( @xmath35 10 spectral windows ) .",
    "then , we investigate the j=0 and 1  rotational levels that represent more than 90% of the total h@xmath0  column density . for all of the sight lines presented in this work ,",
    "the strongest j=0,1 lines show damping wings implying @xmath36 @xmath5 ( tumlinson et al . 2002 ) .",
    "the specifics of the unresolved component structure were unimportant for these rotational levels .",
    "the main difficulty in analyzing these lines is determining the stellar continuum .",
    "catanzaro et al .",
    "( 2001 ) showed that , for early type stars with low rotational velocities , stellar continua are relatively smooth and featureless over the v1 - 0 and v2 - 0 ro - vibrational bands .",
    "we follow catanzaro et al .",
    "( 2001 ) in analyzing the j=0 and j=1 levels using the v1 - 0 and v2 - 0 lyman bands .",
    "the j=0 transitions in these bands are centered at @xmath37 and 1077  .",
    "the profile fitting is simultaneously performed over 5 spectral windows corresponding to the different channels .",
    "an example of the fit quality is shown in figure 2 .",
    "we find that the rotational levels j=2 and 3 represent only a few percent of the total h@xmath0  column density in all lines of sight studied here . as a result",
    ", they make relatively minor contributions to the error budget . finally the errors are dominated by uncertainties in the continuum placement near the strong j=0,1 h@xmath0transitions .",
    "we have estimated the contribution of the continuum - placement uncertainties by fitting the data with three different continua : the best continuum , the best continuum plus 10% , and the best continuum minus 10% .",
    "we then assume that the h@xmath0  column densities derived with the @xmath11  10% continua represent @xmath29 deviations from the best - fit columns .",
    "table 4 presents the derived h@xmath0  column densities for each line of sight , as well as the fractional abundance of molecular hydrogen , @xmath38 $ ] and the t@xmath39 rotational temperature .",
    "we have compared our h@xmath13 results with previous analyses of the _ fuse _ data along two high extinction cloud sight lines studied by rachford et al .",
    "( 2002 ) . in table 5",
    "we compare our results with theirs .",
    "to determine the column density of oxygen along our 19 sight lines , we use the weak o  i intersystem transition at 1355.598  ; the extreme weakness of this transition allows us to avoid most of the saturation effects seen in the other o  i lines observable by stis and _ fuse_. in agreement with meyer ( 2001),we adopt the f - value for the 1355    transition suggested by welty et al ( 1999 ) : f=@xmath40 .",
    "this value was derived from the mean of the lifetime measurements of johnson ( 1972 ) , wells and zipf ( 1974 ) , nowak , borst and fricke ( 1978 ) and mason ( 1990 ) and the theoretical branching fraction of bimont and zeippen ( 1992 ) .",
    "this value is slightly smaller than the one previously adopted ( @xmath41 , morton 1991 ) . when comparing our results with previous works that make use of the older f - value , we linearly correct their column densities to reflect our choice of oscillator strength .",
    "our derived errors do not include uncertainties in the f - value ( which are in large part unknown ) .",
    "although the o  i 1355    line is typically quite weak , the presence of cold components with significant amounts of matter could cause difficulties when deriving the o  i column densities if the lines are sufficiently narrow to be unresolved by stis .",
    "we used 2 different approaches to derive the o  i column densities : profile fitting ( pf ) and the apparent optical depth ( aod ) method .",
    "the aod method ( savage & sembach 1991 , lehner et al . 2002 ) yields apparent column densities , n@xmath42 , that are equivalent to the true column density if no unresolved saturated structure is present . if such structure is present , then n@xmath43  n , and the apparent column density is a lower limit to the true column density .",
    "our aod analysis , including estimation of the errors , follows the procedures outlined in sembach & savage ( 1992 ) .",
    "profile fitting , in which a detailed component model of the interstellar absorption is compared with the data , was performed with the profile fitting code @xmath34 developed by martin lemoine and the _ fuse _ french team .",
    "we assume that the stis lsf is well represented by a gaussian with a fwhm of 2.67 km  s@xmath6 for the spectra obtained through the @xmath17 and @xmath18 slits . for the @xmath14 slit the adopted lsf is a gaussian with a fwhm of 1.5 km  s@xmath6 .",
    "the errors were calculated with the @xmath44 technique for each of the fitted components ( hbrard et al .",
    "2002a , lemoine et al . 2002 ) .",
    "the profile fitting analysis of the o  i column density was done simultaneously with other atomic species with absorption lines visible in the stis data .",
    "each fit made use of the following species to constrain the line of sight velocity structure : cl  i @xmath451347 , c  i @xmath451276 and c  i @xmath451270 , s  i @xmath451295 and kr  i @xmath451235 .",
    "results of the fits for these species will be presented in a companion paper .",
    "cl  i and s  i are useful tracers of dense clouds , while c  i also traces cool material along diffuse lines of sight . because these atomic species have different masses we were able to constrain the kinetic temperature and the non - thermal broadening for each component along the line of sight .",
    "an example of the full fit to all of the atomic species is shown in figure 3 for the sight line towards hd210839 .",
    "figures 4 and 5 show the resulting fits for o  i along the 19 sight lines .",
    "table 6 shows the comparison between the results obtained with the two methods , the equivalent width and the adopted n(o  i ) .",
    "the adopted values are weighted averages of the two techniques , while the adopted uncertainties are the largest of the two errors .",
    "previous o  i measurements can be found in the literature for six of our targets : hd75305 , hd104705 , hd177989 , hd185418 , hd218915 and hd303308 .",
    "our measurements are compared with the literature values in table 5 . with one exception",
    "our results are consistent with previous measurements , within 1  @xmath9 .",
    "for the sight line towards hd218915 , we found that there is no need for the saturation correction applied by howk et al ( 2000 ) , so our value is 30% smaller than previously stated .",
    "meyer et al . ( 1998 ) and cartledge et al . (",
    "2001 ) have discussed the use of kr  i , a noble gas , as a proxy for neutral hydrogen , demonstrating the relative constancy of o / kr in local gas . for four stars we were able to derive kr  i column densities , which , when compared with the o  i column densities , offer another opportunity to compare our results with others .",
    "table 7 summarizes our o / kr measurements , showing that our measurements are consistent with previous results .",
    "the dataset is composed of 19 sight lines toward distant stars ranging from .8 to 5.0 kpc .",
    "the average distance from the sun is 2.6 kpc while the average galactocentric radius is 7.7 kpc .",
    "we are thus probing material well beyond the local ism .",
    "the average distance from the sun in our sample is about 5 times the one found in meyer et al ( 1998 ) : @xmath46d@xmath47 = 530 pc .",

    "these sight lines to halo stars appear to be statistically consistent with the rest of the sample ; this is due to the fact that these sight lines are probing mostly disk material . in particular , in the case of hd177989 , we have seen that none of the typical velocity structures associated with high - z features along this sight line are detected in the neutral gas .",
    "the fact that we find a homogeneous oxygen abundance throughout the disk contrasts with the large scatter reported in stellar atmospheres studies ( smartt & rolleston 1997 , primas et al . 2001 ) .",

    "it is remarkable to observe that , although many of the targets in our sample have molecular fractions similar to the ones reported in cartledge et al .",

    "( 2001 ) : hd27778 , hd 37021 , hd37061 , hd147888 and hd207198 .",
    "while the distances of these 5 stars are comparable to the distances found in sample a , the sight lines are different in nature being probably a lot denser . this final sample ( sample c )",
    "is made of 37 sight lines with a wide variety of properties : the total hydrogen column density ranges from 1.5@xmath310@xmath56 @xmath5 to 62@xmath310@xmath56 @xmath5 , log f(h@xmath0 ) from -5.21 to -0.2 , the reddening from 0.09 to 0.64 and the distance to the sun from 150 pc to 5 kpc .",
    "table 8 summarizes the oxygen abundance found in the different samples .",
    "in particular , we see that in sample c , although the scatter is the largest , the standard deviation is only of the order of 20% around the mean of 362 ppm .    from the 19 measurements of the total hydrogen in sample",
    "a , we derive an average @xmath46 h@xmath57/e@xmath48 @xmath47 of 6.3@xmath310@xmath4 @xmath5 mag@xmath6 with a standard deviation of 9@xmath310@xmath56 @xmath5 mag@xmath6 ( figure 8) .",
    "this value is fully consistent with the known galactic averages @xmath46 h@xmath0/e@xmath48 @xmath47 = 5@xmath310@xmath56 @xmath5 mag@xmath6 ( dufour et al . 1982 ) , @xmath46 h  i / e@xmath48 @xmath47 = 4.93@xmath310@xmath4 @xmath5 mag@xmath6 ( diplas & savage 1994 ) implying @xmath46 h@xmath57/e@xmath48 @xmath47 = @xmath46 h  i / e@xmath48 @xmath47 + 2 @xmath46 h@xmath0/e@xmath48 @xmath47 = 5.93@xmath310@xmath4 @xmath5 mag@xmath6 . the standard deviation we derive for",
    "this ratio is relatively small and is an indication that the total hydrogen content and the dust are well correlated in our sample .",
    "finally , we point out that oxygen column density and reddening seem to be comparable tracers of the total hydrogen column density over a wide range of distances and densities .",
    "the role of oxygen is fundamental in modern dust models .",
    "it is known to be abundant in the cores of silicate dust grains ( hong & greenberg 1980 ) . in particular , the maximum amount of oxygen atoms tied up into grains is limited by the abundance of metals with which oxygen bonds ( o : si : mg : fe ) @xmath35 ( 24:1:1:1 ) . a theoretical upper limit to the number of oxygen atoms that can be incorporated into grains",
    "is then calculated assuming that all grains are made of silicates ( cardelli et al .",
    "1996 ) : ( o / h)@xmath58 @xmath59 ppm .",
    "it was long believed that this value was too small to reconciliate the gas phase ism oxygen abundance with the solar value .",
    "however , recent measurements of the solar oxygen abundance by holweger ( 2001 ) and allende et al .",
    "( 2001 ) have revised the solar abundance downward significantly .",
    "allende et al .",
    "( 2001 ) derived a mean solar oxygen abundance of 490  @xmath11  59 ppm while holweger ( 2001 ) derived a similar value ( although with larger errors ) with @xmath60= 545 ppm @xmath11 100 ppm . in the following",
    "we adopt a straight average of their values as the solar abundance : @xmath61 ppm .",
    "this value is now in good agreement with the maximum total abundance ( gas+dust ) derived using our gas - phase o / h measurements combined :  + ( o / h)@xmath62 .",
    "thus it would seem that the total interstellar oxygen abundance is now consistent with the best solar oxygen abundance .",
    "if we assume that the solar value reflects the total oxygen abundance in the ism and that the total oxygen abundance is constant , we can then estimate the average dust oxygen content for our sight lines .",
    "we find @xmath46(o / h)@xmath63 = 109 ppm with a standard deviation of about 60 ppm .",
    "since we know the maximum amount of oxygen atoms that can be tied up into silicate grains ( o / h)@xmath58 = 180 ppm ) , then , from our survey , we find that @xmath35 60% of the grains are resilient against destruction by shocks on average , with one extreme sight line showing nearly 100% destruction and others showing no destruction at all . along the sight line toward hd93222 , which probes",
    "material surrounding the star ( see  4.1 ) , most of the oxygen atoms have been released in the gas phase .",
    "this can be interpreted as the effect of the interaction between the stellar wind and the nearby ism . on the other hand ,",
    "the three most oxygen depleted sight lines in sample c are from the cartledge et al .",
    "( 2001 ) survey in the dense ism , consistent with an enhanced depletion into dust grains .",
    "finally , this is also consistent with the theoretical expectation that only 10 to 15% of the grains are destroyed at each passage of a 100 km  s@xmath6 shock in the warm ism ( tielens et al .",
    "1994 , mckee et al .",
    "such shocks are believed to be responsible for most of the grain destruction and could explain the observed population of resilient dust grains .",
    "these shocks could also explain the variations in oxygen bearing dust .",
    "several other indirect pieces of observational evidence support the view that dust grains are long - lived , among them the abundance studies toward the diffuse halo clouds by sembach & savage ( 1996 ) and the detection of dusty structures in the halo of spiral galaxies by howk & savage ( 1999b ) .",
    "both observations imply that a fraction of the grains can survive for a long time before being destroyed by thermal sputtering in the halo .",
    "meyer et al ( 1998 ) showed that the local oxygen abundance is remarkably constant .",
    "our data , probing a wider range of environments at larger distances , show much the same .",
    "however , there is a systematic difference of 16% between the two samples that needs to be discussed in the context of a possible enhanced depletion within a few hundred parsecs from the sun .",
    "previous studies of the local ism have found some evidences for a global elemental deficit .",
    "krypton abundance has been measured toward 10 stars in the local ism by cardelli et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and a depletion of 1/3 was found when compared to the solar abundance . because it is a noble gas , krypton is not expected to be depleted into the dust phase and this observation alone",
    "is a strong argument against the sun being an appropriate cosmic standard for the nearby ism .",
    "the same has been observed with sulfur , which is not supposed to be depleted in dust grains .",
    "the sulfur abundance derived from nearby b stars is about 2/3 of the observed ism abundances beyond 2 kpc ( fitzpatrick & spitzer 1993 , 1995 , 1997 and harris & mas 1986 ) and 2/3 of the solar sulfur abundance .",
    "the same depletion pattern is seen for oxygen when the solar value is compared to the nearby b stars while the comparison with distant b stars does not shed much light on the subject because of the large scatter ( smartt & rolleston 1997 ) .",
    "more generally , abundances have been measured in nearby b stars and young f and g field stars ( see the summary by snow & witt 1996 ) and are consistently below solar for all measured elements .",
    "these star samples are representative of the current local ism and clearly point toward a local elemental deficit .    meyer et al .",
    "( 1998 ) have reviewed the possible scenarios to explain such a depletion pattern : presolar nebula enrichment , radial migration of the sun and infall of metal - poor gas .",
    "the oxygen abundance we derive from outside the local ism can be used as a test for the latter scenario . as far as the oxygen abundance is concerned ,",
    "the presolar nebula enrichment and the sun migration might be discarded because of the apparent consistency between the solar value and the total oxygen abundance of the distant ism .",
    "the recent infall of metal - poor material seems to be consistent with our present observation that the oxygen gas - phase abundance is slightly higher beyond 1 kpc .",
    "this is expected to be the case if the gould belt has been created by an infalling cloud ( comeron & torra 1994 ) .",
    "infall is considered as an important component of galactic chemical evolution and is supported by evidence for the infall of low - metalicity clouds onto the milky way ( richter et al . 2001 ) . in this scenario",
    "the dilution should have affected all the elements the same way and the local oxygen enhanced depletion is expected to be the same as observed in krypton and sulfur : about one third .    however , the difference between our value ,  = @xmath64  @xmath11  13 ppm beyond 1 kpc and the value found by meyer et al .",
    "( 1998 ) ,  = @xmath65  @xmath11  15 ppm within 1 kpc , is only one sixth .",
    "a possible explanation for a reduced dilution of oxygen in the local ism is the destruction of a fraction of the dust grains that resulted from the impact of a low metalicity cloud , at an estimated velocity of 100 km  s@xmath6 ( comeron & torra 1994 ) .",
    "however , in this scenario , we should expect that many metals were released in the gas - phase as well .",
    "it is beyond the scope of this paper to explore the different infall scenarios that might be consistent with the observations .",
    "some of the stars in our sample are sufficiently distant that the measurements might be affected by large scale abundance gradients in the ism .",
    "of course the gradient is in part masked by the integrated nature of our absorption lines and by the intrinsic scatter between sight lines .",
    "an extreme example of intrinsic scatter between the data points is given by the couple hd93222/hd93205 .",
    "both are members of the carina nebula ( garcia & walborn 2000 ) and show intermediate velocity structures in their spectra due to stellar winds interacting with surrounding material .",
    "it is well known that in this nebula the spatial variation of na  i as well as ca  ii can be as large as 50% .",
    "although they are within 400 pc of each other , the oxygen abundances we derive differ by as much as 43% .",
    "however the typical scatter between our data points is only of the order of 15% and this must be compared to the gradient effect expected in our data .",
    "numerous papers have discussed the distribution of heavy elements in spiral galaxies ( see the review by henry & worthey 1999 and references therein ) .",
    "the published values by deharveng et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , using h  ii regions , and by smartt & rolleston ( 1997 ) , using b stars , give the range of expected values for the oxygen gradient @xmath1 : -0.07@xmath66 dex kpc@xmath6 @xmath67 -0.039@xmath68 dex kpc@xmath6 .",
    "it is difficult , if not impossible , to use the velocity of the absorbers to deduce a precise location within the disk assuming the most recent galactic rotation curve .",
    "the reason is that , except in a few cases , the expected velocities in the local standard of rest along our sight lines are within the typical scatter ( around 7 km@xmath69 ) .",
    "thus , we choose to show the oxygen abundance as a function of the location of the background star , expecting the gradient to show up as well .",
    "figure 9 allows the comparison of the extreme @xmath1 values with our data ( excluding the peculiar sight lines hd93222 and hd93205 ) .",
    "it turns out that the scatter of the points is largely dominated by the measurement errors while no large scale trend emerges at all .",
    "in this paper we have presented a survey of the oxygen gas - phase abundance using stis/_fuse _ data toward 19 stars with the purpose of probing the oxygen abundance far away in the disk .",
    "this work follows from previous surveys in the local ism and is possible due to the _ fuse _ detector s sensitivity , which permits measurements of the h@xmath0 content through long pathlengths .",
    "a summary of our results is as follow :    1 .  we demonstrate that the oxygen abundance shows little variation in various environments and various locations in the disk .",
    "we find a mean ratio of  = 408 ppm with an error in the mean of 13 ppm .",
    "this is 19% higher than the mean previously derived in the local ism by meyer et al .",
    "we argue that a recent local infall of metal - poor material is not excluded as an explanation for the difference .    2 .",
    "the oxygen abundance derived from our sample combined with previous surveys ( 37 sight lines ) is consistent with both the oxygen abundance of young g & f stars ( @xmath70 ppm ; sofia & meyer 2001 ) or the newly revised solar value ( @xmath71 ppm ; holweger 2001 , allende et al . 2001 ) once dust is taken into account .",
    "it is likely that the o  i column density can be used as a surrogate tracer of the total neutral hydrogen column density , at least in a statistical sense , in diffuse ism abundance studies . although above we have emphasized the 19% difference between the mean  found in this study and the lower value found for the lism by meyer et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , the most striking result from both studies is the lack of large deviations from the mean . the standard deviation in the sample reported here is 15% . if the meyer et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and the cartledge et al .",
    "( 2001 ) data are included , the standard deviation increases to only 20% for a wide variety of diffuse ism conditions . the use of o  i as a tracer of the total hydrogen column density could be of use in a variety of chemical abundance studies . as an example , consider the d / h studies , presently under way with the _ fuse _ satellite . in many cases , determining accurate h  i column measurements requires using _ hst _ or _ euve _ data , which may not be available . in other cases , because the column densities of d  i and h  i differ by about five orders of magnitude , accurate measurements of both species may be precluded by special conditions associated with a particular sight line .",
    "preliminary studies of d / o ratios using _ fuse _ measurements of d  i and o  i are encouraging ( moos et al .",
    "2002 , and references therein , hbrard et al .",
    "additional studies are also needed to determine the special cases in which there are large deviations in the  and identify the special conditions under which such deviations might exist ( e.g hoopes et al .",
