    "remarkably , this object seems to be associated with 2.2 emission @xcite , a fact which can be hardly reconciled with spherical models of hcs .",

    "the bulk of the 11.7 emission stems from the extended radio component b which was used as astrometric reference .",

    "two stars from the corresponding 2mass images of the region were also detected with sc10 at 11.7 .",

    ", the nh@xmath13 emission is diminished due to absorption by the s in the foreground .",
    "the centroid of the 11.7 radiation almost coincides with the center of the nh@xmath13 emission . a possible configuration which explains this morphology might be a cometary , similar to g29.960.02 and its adjacent hc ( which are seen side - on ) , with the line of sight slightly inclined with respect to the symmetry axes of the hii region .",
    "the fact that there is only one mir peak associated with the hc suggests that the multiple structure in the radio continuum ( 3 components are present in the map of @xcite ) is presumably due to locally enhanced plasma density and not caused by a few widely distributed high - mass stars .",
    "the lack of nh@xmath13 emission for the second mir source ( offset position [ + 15,+30 ] ) indicates that this is presumably a more evolved .",

    "our 2.2 polarimetric map obtained with sofi at the eso - ntt revealed that the bipolar - like extended emission ( see fig .",
    "4 ) at the southern rim of the dense core is dominated by scattered light .",
    "the location of the illuminating source was derived by minimizing the sum of the scalar products between polarisation and radius vector as a function of source position .",

    "the large fov of timmi2 covered the target and hd60068 ( situated 47 northwest of it ) simultaneously which allowed to establish accurate astrometry .",

    "4 also displays contours of the 4.7 and 11.9 image taken with timmi2 .",
    "it can be noticed that the emission peaks of both wavelengths are spatially offset , indicating a strong gradient in the optical depth in the immediate neighbourhood of the illuminating source .",
