    "out of equilibrium thermal field theory @xcite has recently attracted considerable interest @xcite .    in many applications",
    "one considers the properties of the green functions of almost equilibrated systems , at infinite time after switching on the interaction .",
    "a recent approach based on first principles has been successful in demonstrating the cancellation of collinear @xcite and pinching singularities @xcite , the extension of the hard thermal loop ( htl ) approximation @xcite to out of equilibrium @xcite , and applications to heavy - ion collisions @xcite . a weak point of",
    "the approach was that most of these results were obtained under the assumption that the variation of slow wigner variables could be ignored or , in other words , that these results were valid only in the lowest order of the gradient expansion @xcite .    for some problems , e.g. , heavy - ion collisions , both limitations are undesired .",
    "one would like to consider large deviations from equilibrium .",
    "one can not wait infinitely long as these systems go apart after a very short time , probably without reaching the stage of equilibrium .",
    "in nuclear collisions , short - time - scale features have been studied in a number of papers @xmath2 .    in the theories with switching on the interaction infinitely long before the time of interest ,",
    "one tries to get some information by extrapolation to early times .",
    "however , in doing so , this information is either deformed or lost . indeed ,",
    "relaxation phenomena include many processes that are expected to terminate as one goes sufficiently far from the switching - on time of the interaction .",
    "thus one can expect that the full theory also describes early times . in many papers , problems with finite switching - on time@xmath3 , especially those related to the inflatory phase of the universe ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for further references ) have been studied by wigner - transforming in relative distance and studying the dependence on relative time directly@xmath4 .",
    "in such an approach , one relies heavily on differential equations and numerical methods .",
    "in an attempt to remove weak points in both cases , we suggest the application of the method of wigner transform ( but now also in relative time ) to the case of switching on the interaction at finite time.the time - integration path c ( see fig .",
    "1 ) is now closing the part of the real axis between @xmath5 ( the switching - on time ) and @xmath6 ( the switching - off time ) ; in the rest of the paper the switching - off time is pushed to infinity .",
    "if we push the switching - on time to minus infinity , the connection to the keldysh integration path is established .",
    "it turns out that this connection is highly nontrivial .    to understand the limitations coming from the finite switching - on time",
    ", we start with a generic two - point function @xmath7 . the quantities",
    "@xmath8 and @xmath9 are four - vector variables with the time components in the range @xmath10 ( here @xmath5 is the time at which we switch on the interaction ; it is usually set to @xmath11 , but we set it to @xmath12 ) .",
    "we define the wigner variables @xmath13 ( relative space - time , relative variable ) and @xmath14 ( average space - time , slow variable ) as usual : @xmath15 the lower limit on @xmath16 , @xmath17 implies the following conditions on @xmath18 and @xmath19 : @xmath20 . to define the projected function ( truncated , `` mutilated function '' @xcite , pf in further text ) , we add two additional properties : the function does not change with @xmath21 ( homogeneity assumption ) , it is a function of ( @xmath22 ) within the interval @xmath23 and is identical to zero outside the interval : @xmath24 analogously , the wigner transform of the projected function ( wtpf ) is obtained from the wigner transform of the function defined on the infinite carrier of @xmath19 ( @xmath25 ) with the help of the projection operators @xmath26 , which are the fourier transforms of the above given @xmath27 s : @xmath28 where the subscript `` @xmath29 '' , as it appears in @xmath30 in ( [ rftfp ] ) and in other expressions of this paper , is the short notation for the `` @xmath31 '' . as an illustration , the wigner transform of the convolution product of two - point functions @xmath32",
    "is given by the gradient expansion ( note that we have assumed the homogeneity in space coordinates , which excludes any dependence on @xmath21 ) : @xmath33 this general expression should be contrasted with our result valid for @xmath34 and @xmath35 being projected functions ( see sec .",
    "5 ) : @xmath36 the analytic properties of the wtpf in the @xmath37 limit as a function of complex energy are very important for further analysis .",
    "we define the following properties : ( 1 ) the function of @xmath38 is analytic above ( below ) the real axis , ( 2 ) the function goes to zero as @xmath39 approaches infinity in the upper ( lower ) semiplane .",
    "the choice above ( below ) and upper ( lower ) refers to r ( a ) components ( note here that we do not require such properties for the keldysh components ) .",
    "it is easy to recognize that the properties ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) are just the definition of the retarded ( advanced ) function .",
    "however , it is nontrivial , and not always true , that the functions with the r ( a ) index satisfy them .    under the assumption that @xmath34 or @xmath35 satisfies ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) ( @xmath34 as advanced or @xmath35 as retarded ) eq .",
    "( [ iffff ] ) can be integrated even further .",
    "we obtain @xmath40 the convolution product of two two - point functions which are wtpf s and satisfy ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) is also an wtpf . this product",
    "is then expressed through the projection operator acting on a simple product of two wtpf s given at @xmath41 . in the @xmath42",
    "limit the convolution product of two wtpf s which satisfy ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) is equal to the lowest - order contribution in the gradient expansion .",
    "the result makes sense since moving @xmath43 is equivalent to @xmath44 at fixed @xmath18 in the standard approach .",
    "we find that some quantities , obtained at low orders in the perturbative expansion , e.g. , bare propagators , one - loop self - energies , belong to wtpf s .",
    "this enables us to sum the schwinger - dyson series with the propagators and self - energies as both these quantities are wtpf . under the conditions ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , the retarded , advanced , and keldysh components at finite @xmath18 are obtained by a simple action ( smearing ) of the projection operator onto the corresponding quantities obtained at @xmath45 , and the convolution product is a simple multiplication : @xmath46 and similarly for the advanced component .",
    "the calculation of the keldysh component requires a more elaborate treatment : one reduces the multiplication to a double ( a single in some cases ) convolution product ; the result contains terms that are non - wtpf terms .",
    "also , the one - loop contribution to the keldysh component is corrected by non - wtpf terms .",
    "now , it is @xmath47 as given in eq .",
    "( [ ifff5 ] ) ( and similar expressions for the advanced and keldysh components and the single self - energy insertion approximation to @xmath48 ) to which previous results on the cancellation of pinching singularities@xmath49 and the htl resummation@xmath50 ( and also on the cancellation of collinear@xmath51 and infrared singularities if the properties ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) hold at the two - loop level ) apply .    from our study one can deduce a general rearrangement of the perturbation expansion at the non - keldysh integration path : the contributions look like the zeroth order of the gradient expansion with the slow coordinate ( @xmath18 ) pushed to @xmath52 , but the use of the pf manifests itself as the appearance of the @xmath53 factor instead of @xmath54 at each vertex , and as an overall projection ( smearing ) operator instead of the exact conservation of energy .",
    "our study suggests that the results obtained by using the keldysh integration path ( @xmath55 ) could be related to the results of our approach ( @xmath5 finite ) .",
    "this relation is possible at low orders of the perturbation expansion , i.e. , as long as the expressions involved are the projected functions not breaking assumptions ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) .",
    "technically , the amplitudes are related by ( [ rftfp ] ) , where `` @xmath56 '' is the contribution in our approach ( @xmath5 finite ) and `` @xmath57 '' is substituted by the corresponding lowest - order contribution in the gradient expansion in the theories with @xmath55 .    finally , we note that our method is helpful in problems related to the time evolution of the system .",
    "additional problems related to the gradient expansion in space components , appearing together with space inhomogeneity , will not benefit from our method .",

    "now it is easy to write down the resummed schwinger - dyson series for the retarded ( advanced ) propagator ( with any exact self - energy obtained by the perturbation expansion that satisfies our assumptions ) . in terms of the corresponding propagator calculated at @xmath242 : @xmath243 where @xmath244 starting from eq .",
    "( [ rafff5 ] ) one obtains the htl - resummed@xmath50 retarded ( advanced ) component of the propagator without use of the gradient expansion .    some more work is necessary to calculate the keldysh component . now , in addition to individual terms , the sum @xmath47 should also satisfy ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) i.e. , the imaginary part of @xmath163 should be negative .",
    "however , there is a possibility that im@xmath241 is positive in some kinematical region . then the resummed schwinger - dyson equation for a retarded component can create the pole in the upper semiplane .",
    "however , this case is very questionable : one sums infinitely many retarded functions ( i.e. , the functions which vanish at @xmath245 ) and obtains the function which is not retarded ( i.e. , nonzero at @xmath245 ) .",
    "such cases are usually classified as pathology@xmath246 ) . at this point",
    "one should cautiously consider the use of the `` physical '' gauge@xmath247 , in order to prevent eventual gauge artifacts .",
    "some indication that , in some cases , @xmath47 does satisfy assumptions ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) comes from the htl limit . indeed , at equilibrium , the htl limit of @xmath248 must satisfy ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , as it is easy to verify . as the properties of density functions enter only through the thermal mass and the position of isolated poles , the same must be true of any distribution allowing the htl approximation .    owing to the fact that the keldysh component of self - energy does not satisfy the analyticity assumptions ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , we can only try to integrate expression ( [ sdsol2 ] ) using approximate and numerical methods .    however , it is possible that @xmath176 can be decomposed into two pieces satisfying assumptions ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) as retarded and as advanced functions , respectively : @xmath249 .",
    "for example , this happens in the case of one - loop self - energy .",
    "( [ sdsol2 ] ) becomes @xmath250 owing to the fact that the functions @xmath251 and @xmath252 are not singular in the point @xmath150 , the terms containing @xmath219 and @xmath253 cancel mutually .",
    "as one of the remaining convolutions includes factors of the same type ( rr or aa ) , we are left with a single convolution multiplication .",
    "this convolution contains neither the advanced first factor nor the retarded second factor ; thus , in general , it can not be worked out in a simple way , and it will contain non - wtpf contributions .",
    "however , it may be performed at least numerically .",
    "the appearance of the non - wtpf contributions signals stepping out of the space of projected functions .",
    "indeed , the calculation of the more complex diagrams , containing subdiagrams resummed into @xmath254 , will not enjoy advantages of the presented calculus .",
    "finally , we note here that the calculation starting with eqs .",
    "( [ sde ] ) and ending with ( [ fff5 ] ) - ( [ sdsol2s ] ) can not be performed with the true ( i.e. , calculated , in some miraculous way , to all orders ) @xmath255 , @xmath241 , and @xmath256 .",
    "indeed , we have anticipated that the true @xmath255 , @xmath241 , and @xmath256 contain non - wtpf terms , and thus one can not use instead of @xmath219 and @xmath253 their restrictions to the subspace of projected functions . using the gradient expansion ( under large-@xmath18 assumption )",
    "one obtains familiar equations of motion for the green functions of interacting fields@xmath257 .",
    "however , the advantage of the presented calculus will be observed in the properties of collision integrals , where one can expect considerable simplifications and the possibility of evaluating contributions of more complex diagrams .",
    "a more complete discussion of collision integrals is out of scope of the present paper , and we hope to publish it elsewhere .      the pinchlike contribution to the keldysh component of the resummed propagator is expressed as@xmath139 ( we treat only the scalar case ) @xmath258 where we have introduced the short notation @xmath259 .",
    "similarly as in the case of resummed contributions , we can perform convolution between alike components ( rr or aa ) .",
    "then one can integrate the terms containing @xmath241 and @xmath260 with respect to @xmath200 , and the terms containing @xmath256 and @xmath261 with respect to @xmath199 .",
    "the result is intriguing : @xmath262 the first term in eq .",
    "( [ sdsol2pf ] ) is a projected function ( wtpf ) that becomes the usual pinchlike term in the @xmath37 limit .",
    "it is this contribution to which the conclusions@xmath139 about the cancellation of pinching singularities apply .",
    "however , the other terms are of non - wtpf nature ; contrary to the case of the product of simple pole terms , the discontinuity along the real axis appearing in the functions @xmath239 and @xmath179 now prevents the vanishing of these terms .",
    "a full discussion on pinching singularities in the finite - time - after - switching formulation requires more efforts and we hope to publish it elsewhere .",
    "in this section , in the framework of the generic field theory with bosons and fermions , we discuss the changes of feynman rules that are due to the `` finite time '' assumption .",
    "we further analyze the diagrams with respect to the question of energy nonconservation . indeed , we find that this feature appears together with the non - wtpf contributions .",
    "the calculations performed so far already contain all of the modifications of the feynman rules required by the finite-@xmath5 assumption .",
    "in coordinate space , the only modification is that the bare propagators [ eqs .",
    "( [ nonigrr ] ) and ( [ nonigrk ] ) ] are limited by @xmath130 and @xmath131 ; thus they are projected functions . in energy - momentum space , the above change reflects in the change of propagators , vertices , and the overall factor .",
    "to transform to energy - momentum space , we choose some vertex @xmath263 , arrange the orientation so that all lines @xmath264 become outgoing , and use the propagators represented by eqs .",

    "exponentials attached to @xmath266 are easily integrated with the help of eq.([zint ] ) : @xmath267 after performing this integration , instead of the bare propagators we obtain their @xmath37 limits [ eq .",
    "( [ fnonigrkr ] ) ] , which are the familiar propagators of the usual ( @xmath55 ) theory .    at the vertices",
    "the usual energy - conserving @xmath268 is substituted by @xmath269 .    under the momentum integrals",
    "there is a leftover factor at the vertices @xmath270 ( by subscript @xmath34 we indicate that @xmath270 are vertices with amputated legs ) : @xmath271 where @xmath272 depends on whether the corresponding momentum is outgoing of or incoming to the vertex @xmath270 , and @xmath273 is running through the nonamputated lines .    the overall factor in the case of two - point functions is treated in a simple way : introduce a slow wigner variable as the average over the times of boundary vertices , and the relative time [ eq .",
    "( [ wv ] ) ] .",
    "finally , one can fourier transform over the relative time .",
    "there emerges an overall energy - smearing factor @xmath274 for two - point functions and similarly for n - point functions . in the case of n - point functions ,",
    "the choice of variables is large and might not be unique ; namely , depending on the diagram calculated , one chooses the most appropriate set of variables .",
    "the overall factor takes care of uncertainty relations : the larger the elapsed `` time '' @xmath124 , the smaller the energy smearing .    in the vertex factor",
    "the energy is not explicitly conserved .",
    "this energy nonconservation is , through the uncertainty relations , related to the finiteness of @xmath18 . in the limit of infinite @xmath18",
    ", energy conservation is recovered .",
    "here we want to argue that for some choice of propagators entering the vertex , the energy is conserved explicitly . to see this conservation , assume , for a moment , that at least one of the unspecified propagators ( @xmath166 , @xmath99 , and @xmath167 ) related to the chosen vertex , say @xmath275 , is a retarded function , @xmath276 . in this case",
    ", one can integrate over @xmath174 , close the integration path from above ( owing to @xmath277 , closing from below is out of question ) , and collect the contributions from singularities . if there are no singularities ( and we know that conditions ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) are valid for bare propagators ) , one just obtains the energy - conservation condition @xmath278 .",
    "the same is achieved with the outgoing momenta and advanced components of the propagator with closing the integration path from below .",
    "now we are going to show that , indeed , one of these possibilities is realized at each vertex",
    ".    each individual denominator @xmath279 ( the lines are all oriented out ) can be easily integrated . to demonstrate this",

    "we rename the basis @xmath280 into @xmath281 $ ] , where @xmath282 correspond to @xmath283 , and @xmath284 correspond to @xmath285 .",
    "then we find the relations of the type ( we assume a three - field vertex , but the proof extends easily to any number of fields ) : @xmath286}={1\\over 2}(d_k-\\mu d_r-\\nu d_a).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the sum over the indices in the chosen vertex ( s - , d - , g - propagators of the outgoing lines ; the factor @xmath287 for the negative coupling of the vertex to which the index-2 ends of the propagators are attached ) is @xmath288}d_{[\\mu,\\rho]}g_{[\\mu,\\nu]}= { 1\\over 4}\\biggl(s_rd_rg_r+(s_k+\\lambda s_a)(d_k+\\rho d_a)g_r \\cr",

    "thus one can integrate the terms separately and find that the factor @xmath279 is effectively replaced by @xmath290 .    as there is nothing special at this vertex",
    "( the indices @xmath291 remain unspecified ) , one may conclude that this is a general feature .",
    "nevertheless , one should do it very cautiously , step by step , while problems may appear at some degree of complexity . then , as seen in eqs .",
    "( [ ffff ] ) and ( [ ffffn ] ) , we find a new element in addition to the energy denominator @xmath292 .",
    "one obtains the extra factor @xmath293 . with the help of this factor",
    ", even the contributions from the poles of the retarded component in the upper semiplane will decay exponentially with the time @xmath18 .",
    "however , the diagrams with resummed self - energy subdiagrams are particularly sensitive . in this case , one is strongly advised to undertake an intermediate step : to fourier transform the two - point function with respect to the relative time , to investigate the analytic structure , and then to perform the multiplication of two - point functions .",
    "owing to the cuts in @xmath238 and to the non - wtpf contributions to @xmath254 , it is likely that this is just the point after which we have to live without the advantages of projected functions .",
    "we consider out of equilibrium thermal field theories with switching on the interaction occurring at finite time ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "we study wigner transforms ( also in the relative time @xmath19 ) of two - point functions . to develop a calculation scheme based on first principles ,",
    "we define a very useful concept of projected functions : a two - point function with the property that it is zero for @xmath294 and for @xmath295 ; for @xmath296 and @xmath297 , the function depends only on @xmath137 .",
    "we find that many important functions are of this type : bare propagators , one - loop self - energies , resummed schwinger - dyson series with one - loop self - energies for the case of retarded and advanced components of the propagator , etc .",
    "the properties of the wigner transforms in the @xmath37 limit are particularly simple if they satisfy these analyticity assumptions : ( 1 ) the function of @xmath38 is analytic above the real axis ( for a retarded component , but below it for an advanced component ) .",
    "( 2 ) the function goes to zero as @xmath39 approaches infinity in the upper ( lower ) semiplane .",
    "we find that these assumptions are very natural at low orders of the perturbation expansion .",
    "the convolution product of projected functions is remarkably simple , much simpler than what one would expect from the gradient expansion .",
    "the schwinger - dyson series , with bare propagators and self - energies being projected functions satisfying assumptions ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , is resummed in closed form without the need for the gradient expansion .",
    "the calculation of the resummed keldysh component is simplified to a double ( and under a certain analyticity assumption , to a single ) convolution product .",
    "this contribution signals the stepping out of the comfortable space of projected functions .",
    "the feynman diagram technique is reformulated : there is no explicit energy conservation at vertices , there is an overall energy - smearing factor taking care of the finite elapsed time ( @xmath18 ) and the uncertainty relations .",
    "the relation between the amplitudes ( valid at low orders of the perturbation expansion ) of the theory with switching on the interaction in the remote past and the theory with finite switching - on time , enables one to rederive the results such as cancellation of pinching singularities , cancellation of collinear and infrared singularities , htl resummation , etc .",
    "previously , these results were considered applicable only to lowest - order contributions in the gradient expansion .",
    "the question arises whether higher - order contributions also remain within the space of projected functions satisfying assumptions ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) .",
    "the answer depends on the eventual positivity of im@xmath241 , explicitly time - dependent perturbation , and the appearance of the one - loop approximated or resummed keldysh component .",
    "the positive im@xmath241 can create the pole in the upper semiplane in the resummed schwinger - dyson series . however , this case is very questionable : one sums infinitely many retarded functions ( i.e. , functions which vanish for @xmath245 ) and obtains the function which is not retarded ( i.e. , nonzero at @xmath245 ) .",
    "such cases are usually classified as pathology@xmath298 ) .",
    "the way of breaking the scheme explicitly is to introduce direct time dependence through time - dependent perturbation , or through the background field which depends directly on time : @xmath75 . in this way",
    ", one obtains the two - point functions which are not projected functions .",
    "a natural step out of the space of projected functions occurs in the calculation of the resummed keldysh component of the propagator .",
