    "there is increasing evidence that the majority of radio - loud agn at low redshift may be triggered by the accretion of hot gas . using a sample of 625 nearby groups and clusters",
    ", @xcite showed that the galaxies located closest to the centres of the clusters are more likely to host a radio - loud agn than other galaxies of similar stellar mass . @xcite",
    "analyzed _ chandra _ x - ray images of nine nearby x - ray luminous elliptical galaxies and showed that the jet power is tightly correlated with the bondi accretion rate onto the central black hole as estimated from the observed gas temperature and density profiles .",
    "it is also now recognized that the ` over - cooling problem ' at the centre of many galaxy clusters could be solved if radio - loud agn can heat surrounding gas .",
    "direct evidence of agn heating came with the discovery of x - ray cavities in the hot intracluster medium of a number of clusters and groups @xcite .",
    "some of these cavities coincide with extended lobes of radio emission produced by an agn in the central cluster galaxy but these hot bubbles may have been inflated by a previous cycle of nuclear activity . ] .",
    "the observations suggest that relativistic radio plasma displaces the x - ray emitting gas , generating turbulence and wave activity which heat the intracluster medium ( icm ) .",
    "agn feedback may also explain why low - temperature clusters are less x - ray luminous than predicted by a homologous scaling of the properties of hotter and more massive systems @xcite .",
    "the energy available from the central agn depends primarily on black hole accretion rate . in low - mass groups",
    ", it can be comparable to the total gravitational binding energy of the x - ray emitting gas , whereas high - mass clusters will be less strongly affected . as a result , relations such as @xmath1 ( x - ray luminosity vs temperature ) and @xmath2 ( x - ray luminosity vs velocity dispersion ) may be modified by radio - source heating . at smaller scales ,",
    "agn feedback may play an important role in the formation and evolution of galaxies .",
    "recent work has demonstrated that it can plausibly explain the exponential cutoff at the bright end of the galaxy luminosity function , as well as the ` down - sizing ' of galactic star - formation activity at recent cosmic epochs @xcite .",
    "it may be that hot gas accretion , agn triggering , reheating of ambient gas , and suppression of agn activity occur in a cycle .",
    "accretion onto the central black hole may cause an outburst which removes the fuel supply for further radio activity .",
    "without agn feedback , the icm reverts to the state that triggered the outburst @xcite .",
    "although this picture is attractive , it remains to be verified in detail .",
    "we do not know the necessary conditions to trigger or to quench radio activity .",
    "we also do not understand the extent to which the global x - ray properties of the gas are modified by agn feedback(e.g . * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "only a few nearby clusters have deep enough x - ray images to reveal low - density cavities and permit the energetics of the gas to be studied in a spatially resolved fashion .",
    "if we wish to study how the global state of the x - ray gas is linked to agn activity in the central galaxy , we are forced to adopt a more statistical approach .",
    "it has long been known that the radio activity of cluster central galaxies is linked with the cooling flow or `` cool core '' phenomenon @xcite .",
    "this is the fact that many but not all massive clusters show a strong central peak in x - ray surface brightness , almost always coincident with the brightest cluster galaxy ( bcg ) , within which the directly inferred cooling time is less than the hubble time .",
    "the fraction of cool - core clusters with a radio - loud bcg is much higher than the fraction in the rest of the population .",
    "furthermore , because the cores add significantly to cluster luminosity and reduce the emission - weighted temperature , cool - core clusters fall systematically to one side of many of the x - ray scaling relations for clusters , e.g. the @xmath1 and @xmath2 relations@xcite .",
    "thus , in clusters of given velocity dispersion ( or mass ) , cool cores tend to be associated with enhanced x - ray luminosity , with massive central bcgs , and with radio - loud bcgs .",
    "given that the probability of radio activity increases with bcg mass@xcite , that both bcg mass and cluster x - ray luminosity increase with cluster mass@xcite , and that central black hole mass correlates tightly with galaxy mass@xcite , it seems clear that radio activity is tightly related to both black hole mass and the presence of a cooling hot atmosphere which can provide fuel .",
    "the exact causal relation between these phenomena remains unclear , however , and recent observational studies of lower mass systems appear , at least superficially , in conflict with the trends established for relatively massive clusters [ e.g. compare @xcite and @xcite with the above references ] .    in this paper , we provide improved statistics for the relationship between cluster properties , both x - ray and optical , and the radio activity of their bcgs .",
    "we use a low redshift ( @xmath3 ) sample of 625 groups and clusters with carefully controlled bcg identifications .",
    "these were selected by @xcite from the sloan digital sky survey(sdss , * ? ? ?",
    "radio properties of these bcgs were determined following @xcite , who cross - matched the galaxies with the national radio astronomy observatory very large array sky survey ( nvss , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the faint images of the radio sky at twenty centimeters survey ( first , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . by combining these two radio surveys",
    ", the identification of radio galaxies is both reasonably complete ( @xmath4 per cent ) and highly reliable ( @xmath5 per cent ) .",
    "radio - loud agn are then separated from star - forming galaxies with detectable radio emission on the basis of 4000  break strength@xcite .",
    "the sky coverage of this cluster sample is @xmath6 square degrees .",
    "the only x - ray survey with enough sky coverage to provide a reasonable match is the rosat all - sky survey(rass ) . because the rass is quite shallow , relatively few individual groups and clusters have sufficient x - ray flux for unambiguous detection , particularly at low velocity dispersion .",
    "the mean flux of such objects _ can _ be detected , however , by stacking their x - ray images ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "such stacking avoids selection biases that can occur if one analyses samples in which only the most x - ray luminous systems are detected .",
    "the limited resolution of rass maps and our stacking strategy , make it difficult to study the structure of the icm in detail , but we will see that concentration differences , reflecting the presence of cool cores , are nevertheless detectable .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we introduce our sample of groups and clusters and describe their radio properties . in section 3 , we describe our x - ray detection techniques , both our method for detecting individual groups and clusters and our stacking technique . in section 4 , we study and compare the x - ray properties of clusters , emphasising how the @xmath2 relation and the surface brightness profiles of clusters vary with the radio properties of their bcgs .",
    "we discuss the contribution of the radio agn to the total x - ray emission in section 5.1 , while in section 5.2 , we discuss how the @xmath2 relation of clusters depends on the stellar properties of their bcgs .",
    "we present our conclusions in section 6 .",
    "we use the sample of groups and clusters of galaxies described in @xcite , which is drawn from the c4 cluster catalogue of the sdss data release 3 @xcite .",
    "the clusters lie in the redshift range @xmath7 .",
    "von der linden et al . developed improved algorithms for identifying the brightest galaxy ( the bcg ) and for measuring the velocity dispersion in each group or cluster .",
    "the velocity dispersion algorithm is designed to limit the effects of neighbouring groups and clusters .",
    "clusters and groups with very few galaxies are also discarded .",
    "the velocity dispersion @xmath0 is measured within the virial radius @xmath8 .",
    "the radio properties of the bcgs are taken from the catalogue of @xcite , which has been updated to the sdss data release 4 .",
    "the final sample includes 625 groups and clusters , with velocity dispersion spanning the range from @xmath9 to over 1000 @xmath10 ( see von der linden et al .",
    "2007 for more details ) .",
    "134 out of the 625 bcgs have radio fluxes larger than 5 mjy and are identified as radio - loud agn .",
    "five bcgs have radio fluxes which exceed 5 mjy but are clearly a result of star formation activity .",
    "there are 433 bcgs without a radio source brighter than 5mjy .",
    "the radio properties of the remainder are unknown because they lie outside the area covered by first .",
    "henceforth , we will refer to a group or cluster as ` radio - loud ' if its bcg has been identified as a radio - loud agn , and ` radio quiet ' if it is known to contain no radio source brighter than 5mjy .",
    "there are 134 radio - loud and 433 radio - quiet clusters in our sample .",
    "the fraction of radio - loud clusters in our sample is smaller than the fraction of clusters usually quoted as having cooling cores(@xmath11 according to * ? ? ?",
    "this may well be a selection effect since x - ray selected cluster samples are biased towards massive and x - ray luminous systems .    in figure [ rlrq ]",
    "we show histograms of velocity dispersion @xmath0 and redshift @xmath12 for radio - loud and radio - quiet clusters .",
    "the two redshift distributions are very similar .",
    "the radio - loud clusters have slightly higher velocity dispersions than the radio - quiet objects .",
    "the median @xmath0 of radio - loud clusters is 428 @xmath10 , with 16 and 84 percentiles at 277 and 595 @xmath10 respectively . for radio - quiet clusters ,",
    "the corresponding @xmath0 values are 392 , 252 and 583 @xmath10 .",
    "the figure also shows @xmath0 and @xmath12 distributions for a control sample of radio - quiet clusters ( dashed line ) .",
    "this was constructed by choosing the radio - quiet cluster closest in @xmath0 and @xmath12 to each radio - loud cluster ( see section [ sta ] ) .",
    "this matching procedure was introduced in order to minimize possible observationally induced biases when comparing the two samples .",
    "we use the rass to study the x - ray properties of our sample of groups and clusters .",
    "the rass mapped the sky in the soft x - ray band ( 0.1@xmath132.4kev ) with exposure time varying between 400 and 40,000s , depending on direction on the sky .",
    "the resolution of the rass images is 45 arcsec .",
    "two source catalogues were generated based on rass images through a maximum - likelihood ( ml ) search algorithm : the bright source catalogue @xcite and the faint source catalogue @xcite .",
    "however , these source catalogues are not optimized for extended sources .",
    "an extended source is likely to be deblended into several pieces by the ml search algorithm .",
    "there are carefully selected samples of x - ray clusters constructed from the rass data , e.g. the northern rosat all - sky galaxy cluster survey ( noras , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the rosat - eso flux - limited x - ray galaxy cluster survey ( reflex , * ? ? ?",
    "the reflex clusters , which have a completeness of @xmath14 at the flux limit of @xmath15 , are mainly located in the southern sky ( @xmath16 ) and have little overlap with our sdss clusters . for the noras clusters ,",
    "the completeness is estimated to be @xmath17 at an x - ray flux of @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "our sample of groups and clusters has been selected from an optical galaxy catalogue .",
    "the centre of the cluster ( taken to be the position of the bcg ) and the virial radius of each cluster have already been determined .",
    "we use this extra information when studying their x - ray properties .",
    "we first check whether the position of the bcg of each cluster is consistent with a peak in x - ray emission ( section [ xcent ] ) .",
    "we then optimize the growth curve analysis algorithm of @xcite to detect the x - ray properties of our clusters individually ( section [ ind_det ] ) .",
    "finally , we develop a stacking algorithm to measure the mean x - ray properties of clusters as a function of their optical properties , independent of the detection limit of the rass ( section [ sta_det ] ) .      before the x - ray luminosity of a cluster can be measured , the position of its centre must be determined . in the optical ,",
    "the position of the bcg is usually taken to define the cluster centre .",
    "however , this position may be offset from the peak of the x - ray emission ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in order",
    "understand whether such offsets are generic for clusters in our sample , we have developed an algorithm to determine the x - ray centre of a cluster .",
    "first , the ml search algorithm used to generate the rosat source catalogue is applied to the rass images @xcite .",
    "sources with detection likelihood @xmath18 in the @xmath19 kev band are retained .",
    "although an extended source is frequently de - blended into several pieces by this algorithm , the central peak is always identified .",
    "we match the position of each bcg with the ml detections using a tolerance of 5 arcmin in radius .",
    "x - ray sources found within this radius are considered as candidate x - ray centres .",
    "we find that 210 clusters have x - ray sources within a 5 arcmin radius and some clusters have several candidate x - ray centres .",
    "we then exclude candidates which are clearly not associated with the clusters by eye . if a point source is detected within the 5 arcmin search radius but significantly offset from the bcg , we assume that the source is a contaminant and is not part of the cluster .",
    "we show such an example in fig .",
    "b1 of appendix b. for clusters that still have more than one candidate x - ray centre , we pick the closest one .",
    "most of the sources we identified as the x - ray centres of clusters have extension likelihood greater than zero .",
    "this confirms that the x - ray emissions we identified are from the extended icm rather than from point - like agn . as we will show in section [ agncont ] , the x - ray emission from radio agn in the soft x - ray bands",
    "is expected to be much weaker than the x - ray emission we measure .",
    "our final sample of clusters with identified x - ray centres contains 157 objects .    in figure  [ offset ]",
    "we plot the offset between x - ray centre and optical centre ( i.e. the bcg position ) for these 157 clusters .",
    "the upper panel shows the offset in units of arcmin , while the lower panel shows the corresponding projected physical distance at the redshift of bcg .",
    "as can be seen , the x - ray centre is consistent with the bcg position in most cases .",
    "the typical offset is less than 2 armin ( @xmath20 3 rass pixels ) .",
    "this corresponds to a physical distance of around 50 kpc and so is consistent with the results of @xcite .",
    "+    since the bcg positions are , in general , consistent with the x - ray centres , we will assume that the bcgs mark the centres of those clusters which are too faint to determine an x - ray centre directly with our algorithm .",
    "after the centre of each cluster has been determined , we use a growth curve analysis to count the number of photon events as function of radius and so to evaluate the cluster count rate .",
    "the background of each cluster is estimated from a centred annulus with inner radius @xmath8 and width 6 arcmin . to exclude contamination of this background estimate by discrete sources ,",
    "we mask out all ml - detected ( @xmath18 ) sources inside this annulus .",
    "the surface brightness of the background is then calculated using the formula @xmath21 where the sum is over the photon events , @xmath22 is the effective exposure time at each photon position , and @xmath23 is the effective area of the annulus after the contaminating sources are masked out .    the count rates within @xmath8 may also be contaminated by discrete x - ray sources unassociated with intracluster x - ray emission . as above , we therefore mask out all the ml - detected ( @xmath18 ) _ point _ sources that are located more than 2.25 arcmin ( 3 image pixels ) from the x - ray centre ) . ] .",
    "as already mentioned , an extended source is often detected multiple times by the ml algorithm .",
    "we therefore visually inspect all the ml sources and determine whether they are contaminants or part of the x - ray emission from the cluster .",
    "we show an example of this process in fig .",
    "b2 of appendix b.    the cumulative source count rate as a function of radius is calculated by integrating the source counts in concentric rings and subtracting the background contribution .",
    "we integrate the source count rate to the x - ray extension radius @xmath24 .",
    "we determine this radius in two different ways , as described in @xcite .",
    "the first chooses the radius where the increase in source signal is less than the 1@xmath0 uncertainty in the count rate .",
    "the other is the plateau - fitting method , where the slope of the plateau ( in units of count rate per arcmin ) is less than 1 percent .",
    "these two methods give consistent results for clusters where the count rate profile can be determined with high s / n . for low s / n clusters , we choose the better determination of @xmath24 by visually checking the cumulative count rate profile .",
    "a source is said to have a significant x - ray detection if the counts within @xmath24 are three times larger than the poisson fluctuation in the photon counts .",
    "we detect 159 galaxy clusters individually according to this criterion .    to convert the count rates into x - ray fluxes , we assume that the x - ray emission has a thermal spectrum with temperature @xmath25 , that the cluster gas has metal abundance equal to a third of the solar value @xcite and that interstellar absorption can be inferred from the galactic hydrogen column density @xcite . the gas temperature @xmath25 is assumed to follow the empirical scaling relation measured by @xcite ,    @xmath26    one might question whether this assumption is robust .",
    "most studies of the @xmath27 relation find that it does not depart significantly from the virial theorem expectation ( @xmath28 ) , even for low - mass galaxy groups ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we further note that a variation in temperature of 50 percent makes less than a 5 percent difference to the flux estimate for most of our clusters . ) will be reinforced .",
    "] throughout this paper we adopt a concordance @xmath29cdm cosmology with @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 .    for some clusters , the total x - ray flux will exceed the flux measured within the extension radius @xmath24 . to estimate the flux that is missed outside @xmath24",
    ", we adopt a @xmath33-model surface brightness distribution @xmath34 with @xmath35 , @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the central surface brightness and @xmath38 is the core radius and is assumed to be proportional to @xmath8 , with @xmath39 for radio - loud clusters and @xmath40 for radio - quiet clusters .",
    "values for radio - loud and radio - quiet clusters are based on the results from stacked images shown in section [ sbprof ] .",
    "this difference introduces a typical change of @xmath41 less than 5 percent . we would come to exactly the same conclusions if we adopted the same @xmath38 relation for all clusters , regardless of their radio properties . ]",
    "the extension correction factor @xmath42 is then defined as @xmath43 the exact values of @xmath38 and @xmath33 are far from certain for each individual cluster . as a result , the x - ray luminosities of clusters with large correction factors @xmath42 have larger errors . to account for this effect , we assume that the correction factor @xmath42 has an uncertainty of 0.1@xmath42 .",
    "we note that for a few clusters with sufficiently high s / n , we can apply a @xmath33 model fit and derive the extension correction factor @xmath42 .",
    "we find answers that are consistent with the estimates using equ .",
    "( [ fe ] ) with an uncertainty of @xmath44% .",
    "the error on our estimate of @xmath41 for each cluster thus has two terms : the error of the flux estimation inside @xmath24 and the error on the correction factor @xmath42 .",
    "the x - ray properties of the 159 clusters that are individually detected in rass are listed in appendix a.      the clusters that are individually detected in the rass are biased to the nearest and most x - ray luminous systems at each velocity dispersion .",
    "we can obtain an unbiased estimate of the average x - ray luminosity of our clusters by stacking objects with similar optical properties .",
    "we describe our stacking algorithm below .",
    "we divide the clusters into bins of velocity dispersion with a width of @xmath45 . within each velocity dispersion bin ,",
    "the angular size of the clusters varies substantially because of the spread in redshift .",
    "( recall that @xmath8 is proportional to @xmath0 . )",
    "we centre each cluster image on the x - ray centre if this has been identified ( see section [ xcent ] ) and on the bcg otherwise . before stacking the images",
    ", we scale them all to the same size in units of @xmath8 and mask contaminating sources in the same way as in our analysis of individual clusters .",
    "the background is estimated as the average flux inside an annulus with inner radius @xmath8 and outer radius @xmath46 .",
    "the remaining steps in the detection algorithm ( determining the extension radius @xmath24 and count rate ) parallel those used for individual clusters .",
    "a stacked image is said to have a robust x - ray detection if the number of source photons within @xmath24 is also three times larger than the poisson fluctuation in the photon counts .    for a stack of @xmath47 clusters with individual x - ray luminosities @xmath48 , redshifts @xmath49 , average galactic hydrogen columns @xmath50 and average rass effective exposure times @xmath22 , the number of source photons that should be detected in the rass , @xmath51 , is @xmath52 where @xmath53 is a function which converts the bolometric x - ray luminosity to observed count rate .",
    "since the x - ray luminosities of the sources in a stack are similar , the weighted average x - ray luminosity of the stack can be defined as    @xmath54    we fit the surface brightness profile of each stack with a @xmath33 model to make the extension correction , and we correct the x - ray luminosity to the value expected within @xmath8 ( see section [ sbprof ] ) .",
    "in this section , we investigate how the x - ray properties of the clusters depend on the radio properties of their central bcgs .",
