    "the recent exciting development of invisibility cloaks , has attracted intense attentions and discussions @xcite-@xcite . theoretically , the cloaks are constructed easily based on a coordinate transformation method as proposed in ref . [ 1 ] .",
    "the object inside the cloak is invisible to the outside observer , because the light is excluded from the object and the exterior field is not perturbed .",
    "the invisibility of the linearly radially transformed cylindrical and spherical cloaks has been confirmed by both numerical calculations @xcite and analytical solutions @xcite .",
    "experimentally , the invisibility cloak with simplified material parameters has been implemented by schurig et.al at the microwave frequency .",
    "inspired by the idea of the invisibility cloak , some interesting applications , such as field concentration @xcite , field rotation @xcite , and electromagnetic wormholes @xcite , have been proposed .    up to now ,",
    "most of discussions on invisibility cloaks focus on the cylindrical and spherical cloaks produced by a coordinate transformation only in the radial direction .",
    "for instance , in ref .",
    "[ 1 ] , linearly radially transformed cylindrical and spherical cloaks are discussed in detail , and their invisibility is confirmed by ray tracing . in refs .",
    "[ 5 ] and [ 6 ] , the invisibility performances of such cylindrical and spherical cloaks are further confirmed by obtaining the exact fields in the cloak medium directly from maxwell s equations . in practice , it is sometimes desirable to have invisibility cloaks whose shapes are tailored for the objects to be cloaked .",
    "thus , one needs to understand well about the properties of invisibility cloaks with arbitrary shape produced by general coordinate transformations .",
    "however , the investigations on an invisibility cloak with arbitrary shape are only seen in few papers @xcite .",
    "the mechanism why the invisibility of a general cloak produced by compressing space is ensured , is still unclear . in this paper",
    ", we investigate the electromagnetic ( em ) properties of invisibility cloaks with arbitrary shape constructed by general coordinate transformations , and we confirm their perfect invisibility . to figure out invisibility cloaks main physical properties , we only focus on the ideal case without considering the practical implementation in this paper .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , maxwell s equations in a curved coordinate system are derived . in section iii , we show how to construct an invisibility cloak by compressing space in a general manner . in section iv ,",
    "the wave behaviors and the medium properties at the exterior boundary of the cloak are investigated . in section",
    "v , we study the the wave behaviors and the medium properties at the inner boundary of the cloak . through sections",
    "iv and v , the invisibility of cloaks with arbitrary shape is confirmed , and the fields in the cloak medium are derived with simple expressions . in section",
    "vi , the cloak parameters and the fields in the cloak are derived when the transformed space is described under arbitrary coordinate system . in section vii ,",
    "two examples of invisibility cloaks , i.e. , cylindrical and spherical invisibility cloaks are investigated . in section vii , the paper is summarized .",
    "maxwell s equations in a cartesian ( @xmath0 ) space take the form as @xmath1 with @xmath2 consider the transformation from cartesian space to an arbitrary curved space described by coordinates @xmath3 with @xmath4 the length of a line element in the transformed space is given by @xmath5q[dq_1 , dq_2 , dq_3 ] ^t $ ] , where the superscript @xmath6 denotes the transpose of matrix , and @xmath7 with @xmath8.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the volume of a space element is expressed as @xmath9 , where @xmath10 represents the determinant of @xmath11 . here , it is noted that the way of describing the space transformation in this paper is similar as in ref .",
    "[ 13 ] , where the time transformation is also taken into account .",
    "the space - time metric tensor @xmath12 defined in ref .",
    "[ 13 ] is @xmath13 $ ] in the present paper , where only space transformation is considered .",
    "then maxwell s equations in the curved space take the form as @xcite @xmath14 with @xmath15 where the superscript `` -1 '' denotes the inverse of matrix .",
    "the permittivity and permeability @xmath16 and @xmath17 in the cartesian space are considered for a general case , i.e. , they can be tensors .",
    "it is seen above that maxwell s equations in the curved space have the same form as in the cartesian space . however , the definitions of the permittivity , permeability , current density , and electric charge density are different , as shown in eqs .",
    "( 7 ) and ( 8) .",
    "to construct a cloak , one usually starts from compressing an enclosed space with the exterior boundary unchanged @xcite . as seen in fig .",
    "1 , the region enclosed by boundary @xmath18 is compressed to the region bounded by the exterior boundary @xmath18 and the interior boundary @xmath19 .",
    "such a space compression can be viewed as a certain coordinate transformation described by eq .",
    "( 3 ) , which makes a connection between the points in the compressed space with coordinates @xmath20 and the points with cartesian coordinates @xmath21 in the original space .",
    "the exterior boundary @xmath18 satisfies @xmath22 .",
    "notice the interior boundary @xmath19 is obtained by blowing up a line or a point @xcite .",
    "thus the cloaks can be divided into two classes : line transformed cloaks and point transformed cloaks .",
    "the compressed shaded region in fig . 1 is the desired cloak .",
    "the permittivity and permeability tensors of the cloak in cartesian coordinate system are given in eq .",
    "it seems that the cloak medium is very complex , whose permittivity and permeability are tensors and their values vary with the spatial location .",
    "however , the eigen functions of the wave equations in the cloak medium are quite simple , which relate with the eigen function of the uncompressed space by eq .",
    "( 9 ) .    in order to achieve the invisibility",
    ", the cloak should be able to exclude light from a protected object without perturbing the exterior field .",
    "thus for the above cloak , at the exterior boundary @xmath18 , external incident light should excite no reflection . while at the interior boundary @xmath19 , no reflection is either excited , and light",
    "ca nt penetrate into the cloaked region . in the following sections",
    ", we will prove the invisibility of the cloak by investigating the wave behaviors at the cloak s exterior and inner boundaries .",
    "for the simplicity of our discussions and considering the practical application , the invisibility cloak is considered to be placed in air",
    ". then the permittivity and permeability of the cloak in eq .",
    "( 7 ) will be simplified to @xmath23 which is the same as proposed in refs . [ 1 ] and [ 13 ] .",
    "the cloak is considered to be lossless at the working frequency .",
    "in this section , we will prove that no reflection is excited at the exterior boundary .",
    "the transmitted electric field @xmath24 and magnetic field @xmath25 without interacting with the inner boundary @xmath19 are expressed as @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 represent the electric and magnetic fields of the external incident waves . according to eq .",
    "( 9 ) , it is easily seen that the fields expressed in eq . ( 11 ) satisfy maxwell s equations in the cloak medium . thus in order to prove no reflection excited at @xmath18 , one only needs to confirm that tangential components of @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) and @xmath29 ( @xmath25 ) keep continuous across @xmath18 .",
    "decompose @xmath30 and @xmath31 into @xmath32 $ ] and @xmath33 $ ] , where the subscripts @xmath34 represent @xmath18 s normal direction pointing outward from the cloak ; @xmath35 and",
    "@xmath36 represent @xmath18 s two tangential directions , which are vertical with each other .",

    "11 ) can also expressed as @xmath37 = [ \\widehat n,\\;\\widehat t_1,\\;\\widehat t_2 ] ^ { - 1 } g{\\bf e^i},\\ ; \\left [ { \\begin{array}{*{20}c }     { \\widehat h_n ^i }   \\\\     { \\widehat h_{t_1 } ^i }   \\\\     { \\widehat h_{t_2}^i } \\\\ \\end{array } } \\right ] = [ \\widehat n,\\;\\widehat t_1,\\;\\widehat t_2 ] ^ { - 1 } g{\\bf h^i},\\ ] ] where @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 represent the unit vectors in @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 directions , respectively .    at the exterior boundary @xmath18 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 .",
    "so @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) characterize the exterior boundary @xmath18 .",
    "therefore , it is obvious that the vectors @xmath49 ( @xmath48 ) lie in the same line as the normal direction @xmath41 of @xmath18 , where @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 .",
    "for the special case when @xmath53 , @xmath54 can be expressed as @xmath55 , i.e. , the vector with the magnitude @xmath56 in the @xmath41 direction .",

    "substituting eq .",

    "thus , it is proved that no reflection is excited at the exterior boundary .",
    "consider the permittivity and permeability at @xmath18 for the transformed cloak .",
    "it should be noticed that no flection excited at the exterior boundary does not imply that the exterior boundary is a perfectly matched layer ( pml ) , where the permittivity and permeability at @xmath18 have the pml form @xmath69 $ ] with the principle axes in @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 directions , respectively .",

    "in this section , we will prove that at the inner boundary @xmath19 , no reflection is excited and no field can penetrate into the cloaked region .",
    "as discussed in section iii , the inner boundary is constructed by blowing up a line or a point , as seen in fig .",
    "2(a ) and ( b ) .",
    "so in the following , two cases that : ( 1 ) line transformed cloaks , ( 2 ) point transformed cloaks , will be discussed separately .",
    "assume that @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 characterize the line , which is mapped to the inner boundary @xmath19 .",
    "we have @xmath83 and @xmath84 , and @xmath85 at @xmath19 .",
    "each point @xmath86 on the line maps to a closed curve on @xmath19 .",
    "the parameter @xmath87 can be expressed as a function of @xmath88 with @xmath89 .",

    "<S> however , for the inner boundary of any line transformed cloak , the permittivity and permeability in a specific tangential direction are always required to be infinitely large . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the field discontinuity at the inner boundary always exists ; the surface current is induced to make this discontinuity self - consistent . for a point transformed cloak , it does not experience such problems . </S>",
