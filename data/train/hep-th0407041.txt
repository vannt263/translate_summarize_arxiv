    "a coherent picture embracing both quantum theory and gravity has been a big challenge for over seventy years @xcite .",
    "the last decades have witnessed a conceptual change on the usual notions of space - time and quantum mechanics .",
    "it is generally agreed that at very high energies the conventional ideas about the space - time breaks down , so that the geometrical framework of general relativity becomes inadequate to describe the non - manifold micro - structure of space - time . in string theory , for instance , @xmath11 are operators that happen to be interpreted as coordinates of an embedding in a metric space @xcite .",
    "many theories also suggest a discrete picture of the space - time at very small distances .",
    "thus , in loop quantum gravity the operators of spatial area and volume have discrete spectra @xcite .",
    "besides , both string theory and loop quantum gravity strongly indicate a non - commutative structure of the space - time at the planck scale @xcite",
    ".    although a complete , non - perturbative theory of quantum gravity is still unknown it is fair to say that some theoretical progress has been achieved .",
    "this advance stimulated the development of a growing quantum gravity phenomenology .",
    "it is now argued that space - time fluctuations at the scale of quantum gravity may be probed / tested at energies accessible experimentally , now or in a near future .",
    "many experimental proposals rely on departures from the classical lorentz symmetry due to space - time quantum fluctuations , with different scenarios predicting similar modified dispersion relations @xcite .",
    "possible tests include time - of - arrival difference between high - energy photons from gamma - ray bursts and observations of high - energy cosmic rays above the gzk bound @xcite .",
    "other interesting experimental set - ups involve analysis of noise in gravity - wave @xcite and matter interferometers @xcite .",
    "besides , there is some input from current experimental data @xcite which can place constraints on the possible scales of space - time fluctuation effects .",
    "finally , cosmological observables such as the cosmic microwave background spectrum may also contain clues to the quantum structure of spacetime @xcite .",
    "any consistent theory of quantum gravity should , in the low energy limit , give us the conventional geometric picture of space - time .",
    "in such theory the space - time itself will be dynamically generated .",
    "thus its dimension , the signature of the metric , global topology , causal structure , etc .",
    ", will be computable ( at least in principle ) observables of the theory , and not predetermined inputs . however , almost all models assume a given dimensionality , signature and/or topology from the beginning . this is the case in the simplicial approach ( quantum regge calculus @xcite ,",
    "dynamical triangulations \" @xcite , lorentzian triangulations ) of 2d pure euclidean gravity turns out to be four in the dynamical triangulation approach @xcite , in contrast with the result @xmath12 in the lorentzian triangulation @xcite .",
    "however , this is seem somewhat as a pathology '' of the euclidean formulation @xcite.]@xcite , etc . ) , and in the ( perturbative ) string scenario where the target space has a fixed dimensionality to be determined later by consistence conditions ( e.g. anomaly cancellations ) .",
    "in fact , string calculations assume a fixed background classical space - time : it is hoped that a non - perturbative approach would introduce manifest background independence into the theory , but this remains a conjecture .",
    "loop quantum gravity is already background independent , however specific models are usually set from the start in a 3 + 1 space - time .",
    "there is some progress towards these opens questions in other proposals .",
    "for instance , in the causal set theory @xcite one starts from a minimum data input : a discrete set of events endowed with a causal relation .",
    "a poset structure is also shown to arise naturally in the so - called causal spin networks @xcite .",
    "many theories suggest that the background of quantum gravity is well described by some type of space - time foam @xcite , notably spin foam models and related ones .",
    "thus , not only the geometrical properties of the space - time , but its topology is also subject to quantum fluctuations at the quantum gravity scale .",
    "there is some phenomenological proposals to uncover possible macroscopic signals of quantum topology fluctuations , see for instance @xcite .",
    "it is widely believed that topology changes are pure quantum phenomena , and a necessary ingredient for a consistent theory of quantum gravity .",
    "for instance , there is no spin - statistics theorem for geons ( i.e. soliton - like excitations of a spatial manifold ) unless topology changing processes are allowed @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will study a toy model for topology fluctuations where it will be possible to address dynamical questions in a simpler context .",
    "since the manifold structure of space - time has to appear at some macroscopic limit , it is natural to expect that one needs a generalization of ordinary geometry , such as noncommutative geometry ( ncg ) , to approach the planck scale physics .",
    "the starting point of ncg @xcite is the remarkable observation that one can describe a riemannian manifold @xmath13 in a purely algebraic way .",
    "there is no loss of information if , instead of the data @xmath14 , one is given a triple @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the c*-algebra @xmath17 of smooth functions on @xmath18 , @xmath19 is the hilbert space of @xmath20-spinors on @xmath18 , and @xmath2 is the dirac operator acting on @xmath19 . from the gelfand - naimark theorem",
    "it is known that the topological space @xmath18 can be reconstructed from the set @xmath21 of irreducible representations of @xmath22 .",
    "metric is also encoded , and the geodesic distance can be computed from @xmath2 . in particular",
    "one can treat all hausdorff topological spaces in this way .",
    "given a pair @xmath13 , one can promptly construct the corresponding triple @xmath23 . however , not all commutative spectral triples come from a pair @xmath13 . nevertheless one can always associate a hausdorff space @xmath24 to a commutative spectral triple , where @xmath25 denotes the set of irreducible representations of @xmath26 .",
    "the space @xmath18 may not be a manifold and the spectral triple has to be regarded as a generalized geometry .",
    "the framework of ncg suggests a possible approach to quantum gravity based on the so - called spectral principle @xcite : once we trade the original riemannian geometry for its corresponding commutative triple we need a replacement for the einstein - hilbert action @xmath27 .",
    "the spectral action of chamseddine and connes @xcite is one possible candidate .",
    "it is a very simple function of the eigenvalues of @xmath2 and contains @xmath27 as a dominant term .",
    "spectral actions can be written for any triple , regardless of whether it comes from a manifold @xmath13 or not . in the spectral geometry approach it is thus conceivable to write the partition function @xmath28},\\ ] ] where the sum  is over the set @xmath29 of all possible commutative spectral triples and @xmath30",
    "depends on the spectrum of @xmath2 .",
    "it includes all hausdorff spaces and therefore all manifolds of all dimensions .    in a previous letter",
    "@xcite we introduced a simple discrete model to quantum gravity based on a particular truncation of the sum in ( [ 1.1 ] ) .",
    "we discretized ( [ 1.1 ] ) by sampling the set @xmath29 with finite commutative spectral triples @xmath31 where the commutative @xmath26 has a countable spectrum @xmath32 . in this approach to discretization",
    "there is no need to introduce a lattice or simplicial decomposition of the underlying space .",
    "the approximation of @xmath26 by a finite dimensional algebra works even if the spectral triple does not come from a manifold .",
    "thus , it gives us a generalization of ordinary discretizations @xcite .",
    "the model describes the geometry of spaces with a countable number @xmath33 of points , and is related to the gaussian unitary ensemble of hermitian matrices : for fixed @xmath33 the operator @xmath2 is a @xmath34 self - adjoint matrix .",
    "the average number of points in the universe @xmath35 , the expectation value @xmath36 of the dimension , and the metric are macroscopic observables of the theory , obtained after some suitable average ( coarse - graining ) over the ensemble .",
    "we showed that the discrete model has two phases : a finite phase with a finite value of @xmath37 and @xmath38 , and an infinite phase with a diverging @xmath37 and a finite @xmath39 .",
    "the critical point was computed as well as the critical exponent of @xmath37 . moreover , an upper bound for the order parameter @xmath36 was found , @xmath40 .",
    "the discrete model is a pre - geometric one , in the sense that the continuum picture with its geometrical content emerges through a phase transition .    in the present paper we elaborate on another discrete model where",
    "the dimension will be kept fixed while the topology fluctuates .",
    "again , we will consider only degrees of freedom associated to pure gravity , i.e. coupling with matter degrees of freedom will not be included .",
    "relying on the framework developed in @xcite , we consider a collection @xmath0 of @xmath1 intervals of length @xmath41 .",
    "for this set of one dimensional manifolds , the momentum operator @xmath42 plays the role of the dirac operator .",
    "the sum in ( [ 1.1 ] ) will be over triplets @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the algebra of continuous functions on @xmath0 and @xmath45 . in order to fix the spectral triple , however , we have to consider the self - adjoint extensions of @xmath42 , i.e. boundary conditions ( b.c . ) .",
    "these are labeled by unitary matrices @xmath46 .",
    "thus , we are lead to compute a partition function over all self - adjoint extensions of @xmath42 . according to balachandran et al .",
    "@xcite the b.c .",
    "fixes the global topology of the configuration space .",
    "the topology depends on the form of @xmath46 , and in general is different from the classical one .",
    "in particular , it can be a superposition of circles @xmath47 of different sizes .",
    "the definition of the triplets and a short revision of the main arguments in @xcite are the subject of section * 2*. in section * 3 * we use the spectral principle as a guide to obtain an effective action for the @xmath46 s .",
    "this , together with symmetry requirements , fixes the partition function .",
    "once we have the partition function for the ensemble of all topologies we are able to study the dynamical localization of topology .",
    "this is done in sections * 4 * and * 5 * , where our main results are discussed .",
    "we identify the simplest version of the model ( with only one parameter , @xmath48 ) with the gross - witten model which arises from the wilson s lattice version of ym@xmath49 .",
    "namely , the partition function reduces to a generalization of the dyson s circular unitary ensemble .",
    "we numerically verify that the configuration space is a collection of circles of size @xmath41 , @xmath50 , for all finite @xmath1 at @xmath6 .",
    "topology thus gets localized in this limit . in the large @xmath1 limit",
    "there is a phase transition at @xmath51 .",
    "we also give a topological interpretation of the phase transition by looking how it may affects the topology .",
    "the connections between topology and quantum mechanics have been clearly exposed in @xcite . here",
    "we rephrase the discussion using the language of non - commutative geometry .",
    "let us consider a collection @xmath0 of @xmath1 one dimensional manifolds ( intervals ) of length @xmath41 .",
    "the corresponding spectral triple will be taken as @xmath52 where @xmath44 is the algebra of continuous functions on @xmath0 and @xmath45 .",
    "the analogue of the dirac operator @xmath2 will be the momentum operator @xmath42 .",
    "let us consider a simple example where @xmath0 is a pair of disjoint intervals @xmath53 .",
    "the intervals will be parametrized by a coordinate @xmath54 $ ] .",
    "the classical configuration space of a particle living on @xmath0 is just the union @xmath55 \\cup [ 0,l]$ ] .",
    "an element @xmath56 is a pair of functions @xmath57 , and the scalar product is    @xmath58    we write the wave - function conveniently as a column vector @xmath59 so that the operator @xmath60 takes the following matrix form @xmath61 we have not fixed completely the spectral triple .",
    "the operator @xmath2 is fixed only up to boundary conditions ( b.c . ) or self - adjoint extensions .",
    "let the eigenfunctions of the operator @xmath62 be of the form @xmath63 where @xmath64 and @xmath65 are obtained by solving the equation @xmath66 with @xmath67 parameterizes the b.c . or self - adjoint extensions",
    ".    one may ask what geometrical properties of @xmath0 are determined by such b.c .. the point of view taken by balachandran et all . in @xcite",
    "is that a b.c .",
    "fixes the global topology .",
    "depending on the form of @xmath46 , the topology perceived by the quantum particle is quite different from the classical one .",
    "let us look at a couple of examples to clarify this :    @xmath68    the probability of finding the particle on the first interval is @xmath69 , and similarly for the second interval . in the case (",
    "a ) , the density functions @xmath70 satisfy the conditions @xmath71 in other words , the probability densities are the same at the points joined by the thin line ( fig.1 ) , and thus the configuration space of the particle is a circle made by joining the two intervals . the eigenfunctions ( [ 2.3 ] ) are of the form ( @xmath72 )    ( 0,0)(0,0 ) ( 15,-10)@xmath73 ( 140,-10)@xmath41 ( 60,-10)@xmath41 ( 90,-10)@xmath73    . ]    @xmath74    and the spectrum is the set @xmath75 , @xmath76 .    in the case",
    "( b ) , the probability densities instead satisfy @xmath77 now , as is obvious from fig.2 , the underlying configuration space is the union of two circles .",
    "( 0,0)(0,0 ) ( 20,-10)@xmath73 ( 85,-10)@xmath41 ( 122,-10)@xmath73 ( 192,-10)@xmath41    . ]",
    "the eigenfunctions are of the form @xmath78",
    "so that @xmath79 .    for most other choices of @xmath46 , topology is not localized as in these two examples but it is rather a superposition of both , and there is no classical interpretation to it .",
    "this happens also for other unitary matrices corresponding to non - trivial b.c ..",
    "notice that the spectrum depends only on the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath46 .",
    "this is not merely a coincidence for the examples we looked at here .",
    "it is easy to see that two matrices @xmath80 and @xmath81 that are related by @xmath82 give rise to the same spectrum .",
    "the generalization to arbitrary number @xmath1 of intervals is straightforward .",
    "our interest is in the operator @xmath83 the self - adjoint extensions are labeled by a unitary @xmath84 matrix @xmath46 .",
    "the topology of the configuration space , as seen by the quantum particle , is dictated by @xmath46 .",
    "different choices of @xmath46 can give rise to , for example , a single classical circle or @xmath85 ( @xmath86 disjoint circles .",
    "the spectrum of @xmath87 may be written as @xmath88 where @xmath89 are the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath46 .",
    "the set of all possible matrices @xmath46 describes the set of topologies that the quantum particle sees . as remarked before , only a small subset",
    "have a classical interpretation , since classical topology corresponds to isolated points on the group manifold .",
    "is there any natural sense in which one can associate a probability to a particular topology i.e. for the matrix @xmath46 from this ensemble ?",
    "in other words , is it possible to write down some kind of partition function for the @xmath46 s ?",
    "a first step towards this direction was done in @xcite , where a dynamics for the b.c .",
    "( quantized boundary conditions ) was proposed in the connection picture . here",
    "we follow another route , along the ideas introduced in @xcite .",
    "thus , we would like to compute the partition function @xmath90\\ , e^{-s[x(g)]},\\label{2.19}\\ ] ] where @xmath91 .",
    "next we look at the probability distribution for the b.c . , that is for the unitary matrices @xmath46 .",
    "then we will be able to ask questions on a possible dynamical localization of topology .",
    "in order to compute ( [ 2.19 ] ) we need to specify a dynamics , i.e. determine an action @xmath92 $ ] for the triple @xmath93 . our guide will be the spectral principle introduced in @xcite .",
    "their proposal for the action is , loosely speaking , just the trace of some positive function of the square of the dirac operator . in our case",
    ", this would imply using the action @xmath94 where @xmath95 is a momentum cut - off .",
    "the trace class function @xmath96 is typically chosen to be 1 for @xmath97 and smoothly going to zero for @xmath98 .",
    "it turns out that @xmath99 is proportional to the number of eigenvalues with absolute value less than @xmath100 , @xmath101 .",
    "let @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "most of the contribution to the sum in ( [ 3.1 ] ) comes from modes with @xmath104 less than or of order @xmath105 , whereas higher modes make almost no contribution .",
    "thus , one naively gets    @xmath106    as expected , @xmath107 for @xmath108 at fixed @xmath1 .",
    "this is natural since for @xmath109 we are effectively cutting - off all modes .    a regularized action that maintains the invariance @xmath110 comes from adopting @xmath111 , giving    @xmath112    we are concerned with the heat - kernel expansion of @xmath99 in ( [ 3.2 ] ) for @xmath113 .",
    "this follows at once from the modular transformation ,    @xmath114    so that the regularized action reads @xmath115,\\ ] ] and one obtains an expansion for the effective action in the form    @xmath116    besides , using @xmath117 etc .",
    "we can re - write the spectral action in terms of the matrix @xmath46 itself :    @xmath118    to leading order , apart from an overall additive ( and hence irrelevant ) constant @xmath119 , this is nothing but wilson s action for a 2-d yang - mills gauge theory on a single plaquette @xcite . including higher order terms gives us models of the type considered in @xcite .    as we noted earlier , the spectrum of the operator @xmath87 is unchanged when the matrix @xmath46 is conjugated by a unitary matrix @xmath120 .",
    "we will require our action and the corresponding partition function to have the same invariance .",

    "let us restrict our attention to the simplest non - trivial truncation of ( [ 3.8 ] ) , which we write as @xmath130 where the factor @xmath131 is for later convenience .",

    "let us sum up the argument developed up to now .",

    "a point @xmath93 in this collection is a union of circles and intervals with some b.c .",
    ", corresponding to a particular self - adjoint extension of the momentum operator .",
    "accordingly , to each element @xmath93 we assign a given topology , parameterized by a unitary matrix @xmath139 ( that is , a boundary condition ) .",
    "since in our model @xmath140 is the partition function for the set of all self - adjoint extensions of the momentum operator , i.e. all points @xmath93 , it is sensible to interpret    @xmath141}}{z_n},\\ ] ]    as the probability of having a configuration space with the topology of @xmath93 .",
    "it is clear from section * 2 * that the topology will be in general fuzzy \" , i.e. , it may not admit a classical interpretation .",
    "now with model ( [ 4.2 ] ) we want to ask questions such as : is it possible that the topology gets localized around a classical configuration for some value of @xmath48 ?",
    "in other words , is it possible that @xmath142 gets localized around some particular manifold @xmath93 ?",
    "we stress that the topology of @xmath93 , or the boundary condition ( [ 2.4 ] ) is determined by @xmath46 , but the probability measure in ( [ 4.2 ] ) ,    @xmath143    depends only on the eigenvalues @xmath144 of @xmath46 .",
    "it does not picks out a topology but rather an orbit of @xmath46 under conjugation . in other words , there is not a one - to - one correspondence between the set of all topologies and the eigenvalues of @xmath46 , as mentioned in section * 2*. the only exception is the identity matrix @xmath145 , which corresponds to the disjoint union @xmath146 of circles of size @xmath41 .",
    "thus only in this case one may speak of a dynamical localization of topology .",
    "notice that @xmath140 may be interpreted as the partition function ( at fixed temperature @xmath147 ) of a 1d plasma of equal charged point - particles constrained to move in a thin circular wire of radius one immersed in a 2d world ( plane ) . the second - term in the hamiltonian \" @xmath148 is the 2-body repulsive coulomb potential , whereas the first term represents a periodic potential with strength given by @xmath149 .",
    "it is well - known that at @xmath150 the system displays only a single phase over all the temperatures scale , characterized by a long - range order of crystalline type @xcite . the spectral density @xmath151 is uniform around the unity circle , @xmath152 , and the topology is fuzzy  .",
    "however , it is conceivable that such situation does not hold at finite @xmath48",
    ". thus , at some value @xmath153 the strength of the periodic potential may be enough to disorder the crystal structure , leading to a melting of the dyson crystal into a new phase .",
    "this conjecture is supported by a numerical analysis of some observables  . in particular , by means of ( [ 4.5 ] )",
    "it is possible to shown numerically that    @xmath154    for @xmath155 the eigenvalues become uniformly distributed around the unity circle , the topology is fuzzy , and @xmath156 as expected .",
    "on the other hand , for @xmath157 the periodic potential overcome the level repulsion and the eigenvalues tend to concentrate around the origin , i.e. matrices @xmath158 are favored .",
    "this is a clear signature of a dynamical localization of topology at @xmath6 for any value of @xmath1 .",
    "gross and witten have shown that the one - plaquette model described by ( [ 4.1 ] ) and ( [ 4.2 ] ) undergoes a third order phase transition at @xmath159 in the large @xmath1 limit @xcite . in this section",
    "we would like to discuss whether this phase transition has any consequences to classical topology in our model of fluctuation topologies .",
    "one has to keep in mind that topology is described by the matrix @xmath3 of boundary conditions .",
    "however , the dynamics depends only on the eigenvalues of @xmath3 . in other words ,",
    "a single set of eigenvalues determines a submanifold of boundary conditions .",
    "since the model is not very sensitive to the topology , we do not expect strong topological changes as we tune @xmath5 across the critical point .",

    "let us summarize the results we need from @xcite . for large values of @xmath48 ( weak coupling ) , the density of eigenvalues @xmath161",

    "the signature of the phase transition at @xmath170 is clear : for @xmath171 the spectral density has support at a small region around @xmath172 , and the probability of finding an eigenvalue outside of this region is zero .",

    "the graph looks like a staircase function .",
    "however as we approach @xmath153 , the variable @xmath214 tends to @xmath215 ( in the thermodynamic limit @xmath216 ) and at the same time the sizes of the plateaus go to zero .",
    "( 0,0)(0,0 ) ( 155,0)@xmath217 ( 190,10)@xmath218 ( 10,157)@xmath214     as a function of @xmath218 . ]",
    "we can also look at another quantity : @xmath219 . in the limit @xmath216 , @xmath220",
    "thus we have the following qualitative picture of the phase transition at @xmath153 : above @xmath153 we only find classical circles of finite size .",
    "there are other b.c . but all classical circles are at most @xmath221 in size . below @xmath153",
    "there are classical circles of arbitrary sizes .",
    "the order parameter is just @xmath222 .",
    "the above model and the one in @xcite are not intended to be realistic . in particular , time",
    "does not appear at all in our present model .",
    "one can imagine that an equilibrium configuration has been attained , in which the fluctuations in the dimension , metric and signature of the space - time had already been partially localized . our model would thus be an effective theory describing the topology fluctuations , controlled by the parameter @xmath48 .",
    "this is conceptually similar to the approach followed in @xcite .",
    "rather our intention here is to furnish a hint on how ncg , in the formulation embodied in ( 1.1 ) , may be used to tackle some difficult , open questions in quantum gravity .",
    "thus , in this paper we asked if dynamics can fix topology somehow .",
    "we believe that these simple models capture some main features of more elaborate ones , and hope that they could furnish insights into it .",
    "this is in accordance with current views on universality in quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "the idea of universality is enforced here by the connection with random matrix theory .",
    "thus , it can be shown that the upper bound for the dimension observable @xmath36 found in @xcite does not change if instead of complex self - adjoint matrices @xmath2 one considers real self - adjoint matrices , corresponding to the gaussian orthogonal ensemble @xcite .",
    "besides , the key role played by the eigenvalues of the dirac operator in gr and in the spectral action approach was emphasized in @xcite : they are diffeomorphism - invariant functions of the metric and can be taken as the dynamical variables of gr . in our model",
    "they are also the natural dynamical variables due to the connection with random matrix theory .",
    "inspired by ideas from topology in quantum mechanics and relying on the framework of the non - commutative geometry we have set - up a simple model to study fluctuations in topology for a collection of @xmath1 one - dimensional manifolds . in its simplest version the model has one free - parameter , @xmath48 , and its partition function reduces to the partition function of the one plaquette @xmath123 gauge theory .",
    "although our simple dynamics is not particularly sensitive to the topology of the underlying configuration space ( since it depends only on the eigenvalues of the unitary matrices @xmath46 parameterizing the boundary conditions ) , we have argued that topology gets localized at @xmath157 for any value of @xmath1 . for large @xmath1 the model",
    "has a third - order phase transition at @xmath170 .",
    "topology is not , in general , localized for @xmath174 and large @xmath1 , however some topologies are excluded due to the finite support of the spectral density in this range of @xmath48 .",
    "thus it seems possible that , in more realistic models , topology can be indeed fixed by the dynamics .    the model discussed in the present work points to the remark that an eventual theory of quantum gravity at the planck scale may possible contain more degrees of freedom than what one would naively expect based on the macroscopic space - time physics @xcite .",
    "there are many possible ways to extend this and the related work @xcite .",
    "notice that the present work and @xcite are somehow complementary : whereas in the latter we have studied fluctuations in the dimension , here we have focused on topology fluctuations keeping the manifold dimension fixed .",
    "thus , it would be interesting to workout a model including both types of fluctuations , with degrees of freedom associated with topology and geometrical dynamics .",
    "another possibility is to include couplings with matter degrees of freedom .",
    "we hope that the toy models discussed here in connection with the partition function ( [ 1.1 ] ) set the stage towards its evaluation in a more realistic scenario where a phenomenological approach can be eventually pursued .",
