    "anderson localization , which is one of the most fundamental physical phenomena in many areas of physics , occurs due to the interference of wave components multiply scattered by randomly placed scattering centers @xcite .",
    "it has been observed experimentally in many different kinds of waves including microwaves @xcite , optical waves @xcite and matter waves @xcite .",
    "anderson localization has been studied mainly in conservative , hermitian systems , as it is commonly assumed that disorder - induced localization is caused by multiple scattering from the real part of the potential . in recent years , however , considerable attention has been paid to localization phenomena occurring in non - hermitian systems @xcite .",
    "an example of this kind of systems is the hatano - nelson model , where the presence of a constant imaginary vector potential in the anderson hamiltonian gives rise to the transition from a real to a complex spectrum , which is associated with the existence of a mobility edge @xcite .    in recent years",
    ", there has been significant attention devoted to physical systems which do not obey parity ( @xmath5 ) and time - reversal ( @xmath6 ) symmetries separately but exhibit a combined parity - time ( @xmath0 ) symmetry . a seminal idea for such",
    "a system was first proposed by bender and co - workers , who demonstrated that a class of non - hermitian hamiltonians could possess entirely real eigenvalue spectra @xcite . in this context",
    ", @xmath0 symmetry requires that the imaginary part of the complex potential @xmath7 in the hamiltonian is an antisymmetric function of the position @xmath8 , whereas its real part is a symmetric one , therefore @xmath9 .",
    "the eigenvalue spectrum remains real and @xmath0 symmetry is unbroken , if the magnitude of the imaginary part of the potential does not exceed a threshold value . above the threshold ,",
    "the eigenvalue spectrum becomes complex and @xmath0 symmetry is said to be broken .",
    "for such systems , many intriguing phenomena have been predicted and observed in various fields of physics including solid state physics , atomic physics , optics and metamaterials @xcite .    the interplay between anderson localization and @xmath0 symmetry is expected to open up an exciting new area of research .",
    "even though many researches have been done on disordered @xmath0-symmetric systems , the majority of those have focused on the study of the spectral properties of the corresponding @xmath0-symmetric hamiltonians , with less attention to their transport properties . in a recent paper , through an investigation of the transport properties of waves in one - dimensional ( 1d ) randomly layered media with @xmath0 symmetry , the authors have found that the inverse localization length for such a system is the sum of the inverse localization length of a passive disordered medium and the inverse absorption / amplification length of an ordered @xmath0-symmetric medium @xcite . in another paper , it has been pointed out that the periodic transverse modulation of losses affects the expansion rate of localized excitations considerably @xcite .",
    "more recently , it has been found that for a disordered 1d binary optical lattice , the presence of gain and loss tends to favor the transport of extended excitations , while it inhibits that of localized excitations @xcite . by studying the propagation of light along the axis of an off - diagonal disordered optical waveguide array created by a simultaneous transverse modulation of the refractive index and the gain / loss parameter , kartashov _ et al . _",
    "have found that disorder - induced localization is suppressed when the system has unbroken @xmath0 symmetry @xcite . beyond the symmetry - breaking threshold ,",
    "the localization is restored and becomes stronger again deeply inside the regime of broken symmetry .",
    "in addition , in a uniformly disordered 2d complex lattice , the study of transverse localization of light has resulted in the conclusion that anderson localization is enhanced in a @xmath0-symmetric potential @xcite .    in the presence of disorder",
    ", it has been shown that the @xmath0-symmetry - breaking threshold decreases as @xmath10 in 1d disordered @xmath0-symmetric lattices , where @xmath11 is the system size @xcite .",
    "in other words , the parameter region corresponding to an entirely real spectrum shrinks to zero in the thermodynamic limit , @xmath12 . on the other hand , bendix _ et al . _",
    "have proposed a novel class of disordered @xmath0 hamiltonians , the spectra of which are entirely real in a broad range of parameters @xcite .",
    "this kind of systems does not obey _ global _ @xmath0 symmetry as usual , but possesses a symmetry termed _ local _ @xmath0 symmetry . in the absence of disorder",
    ", such locally @xmath0-symmetric structures have also been investigated in some recent papers @xcite .",
    "however , the effect of disorder on the transport properties of such structures is not fully understood .",
    "this provides us with the motivation to study research problems such as understanding how the transport properties are changed when the @xmath0-symmetry - breaking threshold is crossed in the presence of disorder .    in this paper , we present a numerical study of the transport and localization properties of waves in ordered and disordered locally @xmath0-symmetric systems .",
    "we employ the transfer matrix method developed by heinrichs to calculate the transmittance , the reflectance and the lyapunov exponent @xcite . in the absence of disorder , we find that when the gain / loss parameter @xmath1 is smaller than the interchain coupling parameter @xmath2 , the transmittance and the reflectance are periodic functions of the system size",
    ". they have different dependencies on even and odd values of the system size . for a fixed system size",
    ", there appear transmission resonances in each individual channel at several values of the gain / loss strength .",
    "when @xmath1 is larger than @xmath2 , we find that both the transmittance and the reflectance initially increase up to maximum values via oscillations and after that , the transmittance decays exponentially while the reflectance attains a saturation value as the system size increases to infinity .",
    "in addition , a singular behavior of the transmittance is found to appear at various values of @xmath1 for a given system size . as disorder is introduced in the on - site potential ,",
    "these behaviors are changed substantially due to the interplay between disorder and the gain / loss effect . specifically , when @xmath1 is smaller than @xmath2 , we find that the presence of locally @xmath0-symmetric potentials suppresses anderson localization , as compared to the localization in the corresponding hermitian system .",
    "when @xmath1 is larger than @xmath2 , we find that localization becomes more pronounced at higher gain / loss strengths .",
    "this is quite consistent with the result presented in a recent paper @xcite .",
    "finally , the phenomenon of anomalous localization is found to occur in the system under consideration at the special spectral positions with energy @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "remarkably , the anomaly at the band center manifests as a sharp peak contrary to the conventional cases , whereas the anomalies at @xmath4 manifest as sharp dips .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we introduce the theoretical model and describe the method of numerical calculation and the physical quantities of interest . in sec .",

    "if we consider only nearest - neighbor interactions , our model is governed by two coupled discrete schrdinger equations , which take the form @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the wave function amplitude and the on - site potential at site @xmath20 of chain @xmath21 @xmath22 .",

    "this model is very similar to the one studied in ref .",
    "33 , the only difference being that semi - infinite perfect leads are connected at both ends in the present model .",
    "we refer to it as unbounded model .    in order to study the combined effects of the simultaneous presence of disorder and @xmath0 symmetry on wave propagation in the system under consideration , we set @xmath26 and @xmath27 with @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is taken from a uniform random distribution in the range @xmath30 $ ] and @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) is a constant .",
    "for such a choice of the on - site potentials , the system possesses a local @xmath0 symmetry associated with each individual dimer enclosing one site @xmath20 of each chain @xcite . despite the lack of global @xmath0 symmetry",
    ", it has a parameter region corresponding to an exact @xmath0 phase in which the eigenvalues are real . to calculate the transfer and scattering matrices which are the basic elements of the transfer matrix method we have employed , it is convenient to cast eq .",

    "then both channels are propagating when @xmath41 , while one channel is propagating and the other is evanescent when @xmath42 or @xmath43 .",
    "it is important to notice that there is a fundamental difference between the eigenvalue problem for the bounded model studied in ref .",
    "33 and the scattering problem for the unbounded model studied in this paper . in the former",
    ", the authors fixed the gain / loss parameter @xmath1 and the boundary conditions and obtained the corresponding energy eigenvalues , which are in general complex - valued .",

    "the conductance @xmath54 and the dimensionless conductance @xmath52 in the zero - temperature limit are related to the transmission probability via the landauer two - probe formula : @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the electron charge and @xmath57 is planck s constant @xcite .",

    "for instance , for a unit flux incident in the second channel , one has @xmath70 in general .",
    "in our calculations , all the energies are measured in the unit of @xmath13 , which we set equal to 1 .",

    "we first consider the situation where no disorder in the on - site potential is present ( @xmath71 ) . in this case , the only requirement ensuring unbroken @xmath0 symmetry in the corresponding bounded model with no semi - infinite perfect leads is that the gain / loss strength @xmath1 must be smaller than or equal to the interchain coupling strength @xmath2 , namely @xmath72 @xcite .",

    "43 , the on - site random potentials @xmath131 and @xmath132 on chains 1 and 2 were statistically uncorrelated , while they are correlated in the present study .",
    "it has been reported that the band center anomaly depends strongly on the nature of disorder such as its correlation properties @xcite .",
    "it is only associated with the disorder in the chains , therefore it remains unchanged as @xmath1 increases from zero .",
    "in contrast , the positions of the side anomalies are shifted toward the band center when @xmath1 increases . by a numerical test for various pairs of the parameters @xmath2 and @xmath1 ,",
    "we have confirmed that these anomalies are dependent on the interchain coupling and the gain / loss strength and always occur at @xmath4 .",
    "the existence of this kind of anomalies is easily understood in terms of the @xmath133-coupling of the energy bands in the absence of disorder @xcite .     plotted versus energy @xmath44 , when @xmath128 , @xmath109 , @xmath92 and @xmath110 , 0.1 , 0.2 .",
    "anderson localization is suppressed overall in the presence of a locally @xmath0-symmetric potential with @xmath1 much smaller than @xmath82 .",
    "anomalous localization occurs precisely at the spectral positions @xmath3 ( band center anomaly ) and @xmath4 ( side anomalies ) as indicated by the arrows .",
    "anderson localization at the band center is anomalously enhanced rather than suppressed unlike in the conventional cases.,width=340 ]     plotted versus energy @xmath44 when ( a ) @xmath128 , @xmath125 , @xmath92 and @xmath127 , 0.5 , 0.6 , and when ( b ) @xmath125 , @xmath92 , @xmath109 and @xmath134 , 2000 , 2500 .",
    "the spectral positions at which the side anomalies occur do not change as either @xmath123 or @xmath16 varies.,width=321 ]    finally , in fig .",
    "11(a ) , we plot the lyapunov exponent as a function of the energy @xmath44 when @xmath128 , @xmath125 and @xmath92 , for several values of the disorder strength , @xmath127 , 0.5 , 0.6 .",
    "obviously , anderson localization is enhanced with increasing @xmath123 over the whole energy spectrum .",
    "the spectral positions at which the side anomalies occur do not change as the disorder strength varies .",
    "this again confirms that these anomalies are only associated with the interchain coupling and the gain / loss parameter . in fig .",
    "11(b ) , we plot @xmath49 versus @xmath44 when @xmath125 , @xmath92 and @xmath109 for different system sizes @xmath134 , 2000 , 2500 .",
    "we find that all curves show a similar behavior . at any fixed value of @xmath44",
    ", the lyapunov exponent increases with increasing @xmath16 .",
    "the growth of @xmath49 slows down for a larger @xmath16 , and above a sufficiently large value of @xmath16 , @xmath49 approaches a saturation value .",
    "this result indicates that the system size @xmath135 is sufficiently large for the purpose of studying the localization properties in the system under consideration .",
    "in this paper , we have presented a numerical study of the transport and localization properties of waves in ordered and disordered locally @xmath0-symmetric systems .",
    "we have employed the transfer matrix method developed in ref .",
    "37 to calculate the transmittance , the reflectance and the lyapunov exponent . in the ordered case",
    ", we have found that when the gain / loss parameter @xmath1 is smaller than the interchain coupling parameter @xmath2 , the transmittance and the reflectance are periodic functions of the system size .",
    "they have different dependencies on even and odd values of the system size . for a fixed system size",
    ", there appear transmission resonances in each individual channel at several values of the gain / loss strength .",
    "when @xmath1 is larger than @xmath2 , we find that both the transmittance and the reflectance initially increase up to maximum values via oscillations and after that , the transmittance decays exponentially while the reflectance attains a saturation value as the system size increases .",
    "in addition , a singular behavior of the transmittance has also been shown .",
    "next , as the disorder is introduced in the on - site potentials , these behaviors are changed substantially due to the interplay between disorder and the gain / loss effect .",
    "specifically , when @xmath1 is smaller than @xmath2 , we have found that the presence of locally @xmath0-symmetric potentials suppresses anderson localization , as compared to the localization in the corresponding hermitian system . in the case of @xmath75",
    ", it has been found that the localization becomes more pronounced at higher gain / loss strengths .",
    "finally , the phenomenon of anomalous localization , which is well - known in passive disordered systems , has also been found to occur in locally @xmath0-symmetric systems .",
    "these anomalies occur precisely at the special spectral positions @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the anomaly at the band center manifests as a sharp peak contrary to the conventional cases , whereas the anomalies at @xmath4 manifest as sharp dips .",
    "we hope that the results presented here will be a useful contribution to the study of the combined effects of the simultaneous presence of disorder and @xmath0 symmetry on wave propagation in quasi-1d systems .",
