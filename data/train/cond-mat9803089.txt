    "it was first shown by laughlin,@xcite that the fractional quantum hall effect occurs because electron - electron interactions result in incompressible states of two - dimensional electron systems at special filling fractions of a landau level .",
    "subsequently , jain showed that these incompressible many - body states can be understood , in a mean field sense , as arising from the spectral gaps between the single - particle landau levels of quasi - particles known as composite fermions and that the fractional quantum hall effect can be viewed as the integer quantum hall effect of composite fermions.@xcite the composite fermion theory has yielded many remarkable results and there is now an extensive theoretical and experimental literature supporting it and examining its ramifications.@xcite    following jain s suggestion that the fractional quantum hall effect is the integer quantum hall effect of composite fermions , a model of composite fermion edge states has been proposed@xcite@xmath2@xcite that generalizes the very successful edge state theories of transport in the integer quantum hall regime@xcite@xmath3@xcite to fractional quantum hall phenomena .",
    "this mean field model was developed for high mobility systems with smooth edge potentials and has been able to account for a great deal of experimental data including the observed integer@xcite and fractional@xcite quantized hall conductances , the results of transport experiments on hall bars with smooth potential barriers and constrictions,@xcite@xmath3@xcite and the observed fermi liquid - like behavior of aharonov - bohm resonances associated with antidots in the fractional quantum hall regime.@xcite@xmath2@xcite    the singular gauge transformation@xcite@xmath2@xcite@xmath2@xcite that transforms electrons into composite fermions by attaching to them tubes of fictitious magnetic flux preserves charge , and therefore the charge of a composite fermion is equal to that of an electron .",
    "however , it was pointed out by goldhaber and jain @xcite that the local charge associated with the composite fermion is dressed by the presence of the other composite fermions in the system and thus becomes fractional , the fractions being in agreement with the fractional quasiparticle charges predicted earlier by laughlin and others.@xcite@xmath2 @xcite@xmath2@xcite for example , for the fractional filling @xmath4 of the lowest landau level the dressed quasiparticle charge @xmath5 equals @xmath6 .",
    "recently experiments have been reported measuring current noise in the fractional quantum hall regime@xcite@xmath2 @xcite as a probe of the fractional quasiparticle charge .",
    "the results have been interpreted@xcite@xmath2 @xcite as direct experimental evidence of fractionally charged quasiparticles with @xmath7 at @xmath4 . however , the theoretical predictions@xcite@xmath2@xcite@xmath3 @xcite that @xmath7 at @xmath4 are based on the assumption that the electronic state is _ incompressible _ , whereas current noise originates at the edges of the sample where both incompressible and compressible regions occur .",
    "furthermore johnson - nyquist noise arises _ entirely _ from the _ compressible _ regions .",
    "it is therefore of interest to examine both the fractional quasiparticle charges and the associated current noise theoretically within an edge state model that admits both incompressible and compressible regions at the edge .",
    "this is the purpose of the present article .",

    "i discuss electric current fluctuations in the fractional quantum hall regime within the framework of the edge state model,@xcite@xmath2@xcite and show that to understand these fluctuations one must consider the interactions between the composite fermions , the important interactions being those mediated by the fictitious electric field@xcite@xmath2@xcite@xmath2 @xcite@xmath2@xcite associated with composite fermion currents .",
    "these interactions renormalize the current fluctuations and their effects must be calculated self - consistently .",

    "the dressed composite fermion charges are fractional and in incompressible regions the predicted fractions agree with those obtained earlier by laughlin and others.@xcite@xmath2 @xcite@xmath2@xcite@xmath2@xcite . however in the compressible regions near the edge the fractions are predicted to be different and to vary smoothly with position . as the edge is approached and the local electron density tends to zero the dressed composite fermion charge approaches the electron charge @xmath8 .    current noise in mesoscopic systems has been discussed theoretically in recent years by many authors , @xcite@xmath3@xcite but not from the perspective of composite fermion edge states . in section [ noise ]",
    "i calculate the johnson - nyquist noise on the fractional quantum hall plateaus using the composite fermion edge state model@xcite@xmath2@xcite and the results of section [ fluct ] for the dressed current fluctuations .",
    "the method used is a generalization of the wave packet arguments of landauer and martin@xcite@xmath2@xcite to composite fermion edge state theory and the fractional quantum hall regime .",
    "summing the contributions of all of the active and silent modes@xcite of the edge state model and including the variation of the dressed quasiparticle charge across the edge obtained in section [ fluct ] yields a result in agreement with the nyquist formula @xmath9 for all of jain s filling fractions of a landau level .",
    "here @xmath10 is the johnson - nyquist noise on the fractional quantum hall plateau , @xmath11 is boltzmann s constant , @xmath12 is the temperature and @xmath13 is the fractional quantized hall conductance .    the significance of these results is discussed in section [ conc ] where i also comment briefly on the implications for the interpretation of recent shot noise experiments .",
    "in composite fermion theory , a singular gauge transformation attaches a tube of fictitious magnetic flux with an even number of flux quanta to each electron.@xcite@xmath2@xcite@xmath2@xcite the electrons together with the attached flux tubes obey fermi statistics and are called ",
    "composite fermions.\"@xcite in mean field theory the interactions between composite fermions that are due to the vector potentials associated with the tubes of fictitious flux are replaced by interactions with a fictitious average magnetic field and a fictitious electric field .",

    "consider a 2deg of length @xmath34 in the _ x - y _ plane connecting source and drain contacts as depicted in fig.[f2 ] .",

    "obey fermi statistics , @xmath44 takes the values 0 and 1 .",
    "fluctuations in the values that the @xmath44 take give rise to current noise .",
    "however an important complication is that @xmath47 in equation ( [ sch ] ) ( and therefore @xmath45 in equation ( [ cur ] ) ) depends on the specific configuration of occupation numbers @xmath44 as will be discussed further below .    in the spirit of mean field theory",
    "let us now approximate the average electric current @xmath48 by setting every occupation number @xmath49 in equation ( [ cur ] ) formally equal to its ensemble average value @xmath50 and replacing @xmath45 by the corresponding mean field velocity function @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the solution of equation ( [ sch ] ) with @xmath53 and @xmath30 calculated using the average occupation numbers @xmath50 .",

    "notice that the second term on the rhs of equation ( [ curdev ] ) includes the effect of changing the occupation of the single particle composite fermion state in landau level r with wave vector k on the currents carried by the _",
    "other _ single particle composite fermion states . it will be seen below that this effect is very important .    to proceed",
    "further analytically i will assume the edge currents are of the quasi - equilibrium type and that the edge potential @xmath66 is so slowly varying with @xmath67 that @xmath68 varies little over the range of values of @xmath69 that contribute appreciably@xcite to the integral in equation ( [ curdev ] ) . in equation ( [ curdev ] )",
    ", @xmath70 then becomes @xmath71 .",
    "the occupation number fluctuation @xmath72 affects @xmath73 through the associated fluctuations in the fictitious electric field @xmath74 , the coulomb potential and the effective magnetic field .",
    "only the first of these contributes to @xmath75 because the others are local effects and do not affect the integral . thus using equation ( [ eg ] ) for @xmath74 yields @xmath76 where the upper ( lower ) sign applies when @xmath31 is parallel ( antiparallel ) to @xmath35 .",
    "notice that the _ total _ current fluctuation @xmath59 is used for the integral of the fluctuation current density in the last term in equation ( [ intdu ] ) .",
    "this ensures that the final result ( [ dresscur ] ) of this calculation will include the interactions between composite fermions that are mediated by the fluctuation @xmath77 of the fictitious electric field _",
    "self - consistently_.    replacing @xmath70 by @xmath71 in equation ( [ curdev ] ) and using ( [ intdu ] ) yields @xmath78 or @xmath79    the physical meaning of this result is that a single - particle composite fermion current fluctuation @xmath80 generates a fluctuation in the the fictitious electric field that extends over a distance of a few magnetic lengths . as a result",
    "a `` kink '' develops in the energy dispersions of _ all _ of the composite fermion landau levels in that vicinity modifying the velocities of the surrounding composite fermion states .",
    "thus the single particle current fluctuation is dressed by the disturbance that it generates in the surrounding composite fermion medium .",
    "the dressing must be calculated self - consistently since the current fluctuation induced in the surrounding medium generates its own contribution to the fluctuation in the fictitious electric field which in turn affects the current .",
    "the self - consistent calculation yields the dressed current fluctuation @xmath59 given by equation ( [ dresscur ] ) .",
    "thus the current fluctuation can be understood as a dressed quasi - particle associated with the composite fermion in landau level r with wave vector k. the quasi - particle propagates with same velocity @xmath81 as the composite fermion .",
    "it is therefore intuitively appealing to rewrite equation equation ( [ dresscur ] ) for the dressed current fluctuation in a form analogous to equation ( [ bare ] ) for the  bare \" current fluctuation but with a renormalized quasi - particle charge , i.e. , @xmath82 where the dressed quasi - particle charge is given by @xmath83    where the 2deg is incompressible , @xmath84 is either 0 or 1 depending on whether the @xmath39 composite fermion landau level is full or empty , and therefore @xmath85 where @xmath86 is an integer and @xmath15 is an even integer .",
    "this agrees with the fractional quasi - particle charges that have been derived previously by other methods for incompressible states at jain s filling fractions @xmath87 of a landau level.@xcite@xmath2 @xcite@xmath2@xcite@xmath2@xcite for example , in the bulk for the fractional filling @xmath4 of the lowest landau level , @xmath88 , @xmath89 and the dressed quasiparticle charge @xmath5 given by equation ( [ e*bulk ] ) equals @xmath6 .    on the other hand as the depletion region at the edge of the sample",
    "is approached the filling of the composite fermion landau levels approaches zero .",
    "thus @xmath90 and equation ( [ e * ] ) predicts that @xmath5 tends to @xmath8 .    in the compressible regions between these two extremes",
    "the behavior of the quasi - particle charge can be obtained from equation ( [ e * ] ) if the behavior of @xmath68 is known . for the usual case of quasi - equilibrium edge currents",
    "this is given by the fermi function @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the composite fermion electrochemical potential for the @xmath93 ( closest ) edge , @xmath94 , @xmath12 is the temperature and @xmath11 is boltzmann s constant .",
    "johnson - nyquist noise arises from the compressible regions in this regime and will be evaluated using the above results in section [ noise ] .",
    "since the modification of the velocities of the composite fermions from @xmath95 to @xmath65 by the fictitious electric field associated with the current fluctuation is responsible for the dressing of the composite fermion charge and since the dressed velocity @xmath81 appears explicitly in equation ( [ renorm ] ) along with @xmath96 it is of interest to consider how large the effect of the fluctuation of the fictitious electric field on @xmath81 may be .",
    "this may be estimated as @xmath97 where @xmath98 is as in equation ( [ intdu ] ) and @xmath99 is the difference in wave vector between states separated by the magnetic length @xmath100 in real space .",
    "the result is found to be proportional to @xmath101 and is therefore very small for macroscopic samples .",
    "the dressing of the quasi - particle charge on the other hand is due to the modification by the fictitious electric field of the velocities of a _ large _ number ( of the order of @xmath102 ) of single - particle composite fermion states and for that reason is a very significant effect even though the modification of the individual composite fermion velocities is very small .",
    "finally , it is important to consider whether the above results which have been obtained by considering the dressing of a _ single _ single - particle current fluctuation are applicable to thermal current fluctuations which involve large numbers of such single - particle  excitations \" simultaneously .",
    "this will be done in two steps :    firstly , if a current fluctuation is due to any number of single particle excitations that are widely separated from each other ( by much more than a magnetic length ) in real space then the dressing of each single particle current fluctuation will occur separately from the others and it follows that equation ( [ renorm ] ) becomes @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the total dressed current fluctuation , the sum over @xmath105 and @xmath106 is over the individual single - particle excitations that contribute to the current fluctuation and the dressed composite fermion quasiparticle charge @xmath107 is given by equation ( [ e * ] ) .",
    "secondly , if a current fluctuation is due to any number of single particle excitations that are all so close to each other in real space that @xmath68 does not vary appreciably over the entire region containing these excitations for any composite fermion landau level @xmath108 then the entire argument leading to equation ( [ dresscur ] ) still holds if @xmath109 is replaced with the sum of the  bare \" single particle current fluctuations @xmath110 and @xmath111 is replaced with the total dressed current fluctuation @xmath112 .",
    "the result of this calculation turns out to be also given by equations ( [ renormgen ] ) and ( [ e * ] ) .    since equations ( [ renormgen ] ) and ( [ e * ] ) are valid in the two opposite limits of widely separated and closely spaced single - particle excitations discussed above it is reasonable to suppose that they are valid ( or at least a good approximation ) in general , at the level of mean field theory and provided that the edge potential @xmath66 and @xmath68 are sufficiently slowly varying functions of @xmath67 and @xmath69 as has been assumed in the above analysis",
    "i will now apply the theory developed above to the simplest relevant experimentally observable phenomenon , the johnson - nyquist noise on fractional quantum hall plateaus where there is no backscattering of the composite fermions .",
    "johnson - nyquist noise is the electric current noise that occurs in the absence of an applied voltage across a conductor connecting two reservoirs and is due to thermal fluctuations in the number of charge carriers that pass through the conductor per unit time .",
    "as depicted schematically in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] , the reservoirs are assumed to be effectively short circuited via two large capacitances to eliminate any voltage fluctuations between them at the frequencies of interest .    current noise is described in terms of the spectral density of current - current fluctuations that is defined as follows.@xcite let the fourier transform of the current fluctuations be @xmath113 the current - current correlation function @xmath114 depends only on @xmath115 if @xmath116 is of the form @xmath117 it then follows that @xmath118 is given by @xmath119 where @xmath120 .",
    "thus the the spectral density of current fluctuations at frequency @xmath121 is @xmath122 where @xmath123 is defined by equation ( [ delta ] ) .",
    "let us now rewrite equation ( [ renormgen ] ) as @xmath124 where @xmath125 is the dressed contribution of the state with wave vector @xmath106 in composite fermion landau level @xmath105 at time @xmath126 to the current fluctuation .",
    "the time dependence arises because the occupation number @xmath56 fluctuates taking values 0 and 1 at different times as composite fermion wave packets in composite fermion landau level @xmath105 and centered on wave vector @xmath106 are injected into the 2deg and absorbed from it by the reservoirs . in the spirit of landauer and martin s treatment of systems of ordinary fermions,@xcite@xmath2@xcite i will assume that these wave packets ( which may be occupied or empty ) are mutually orthogonal and enter the 2deg in a regular sequence at times @xmath127 spaced by the time @xmath128 that it takes a wave packet to traverse a distance @xmath129 equal to its length . for the low frequencies",
    "@xmath130 of interest ( @xmath131 ) , equation ( [ ft ] ) thus becomes @xmath132 where @xmath133 assuming that the current fluctuations for different @xmath105 , @xmath106 and @xmath134 are uncorrelated , equation ( [ ft ] ) yields @xmath135 noting that @xmath136 is independent of @xmath134 and that for low frequencies @xmath137 , we may replace @xmath138 by @xmath139 , equation ( [ xxx ] ) becomes @xmath140 which by comparison with equations ( [ delta ] ) and ( [ s ] ) yields @xmath141 for the spectral density of the current noise .    in equation ( [ spectrum ] ) @xmath59 is as in equations ( [ renorm ] ) and ( [ renormgen ] ) but with @xmath34 replaced by @xmath129 since the wave packet basis is now being used . setting @xmath142 since @xmath143 0 or 1 , using @xmath144 and approximating @xmath81 by @xmath145 ( which is reasonable according to the discussion in section [ fluct ] ) , equation ( [ spectrum ] ) yields    @xmath146    note that since @xmath147 the summand in equation ( [ spectrum1 ] ) is non - negative and is not zero only for states in compressible regions . transforming the sum over @xmath106 in to an energy integral yields @xmath148 assuming that @xmath58 is of the form given by equation ( [ av ] ) yields @xmath149 and equation ( [ spectrum2 ] ) becomes @xmath150 finally , noting the form ( [ e * ] ) of the dressed composite fermion charge , equation ( [ spectrum3 ] ) reduces to @xmath151 where @xmath152 stands for @xmath153 , the local total filling of the composite fermion landau levels . in keeping with the non - negative character of the summand in equation ( [ spectrum1 ] )",
    ", the convention has been adopted that the direction of integration in equations ( [ spectrum2 ] ) , ( [ spectrum3 ] ) and ( [ spectrum4 ] ) is such that @xmath154 , @xmath155 and @xmath156 are always positive , respectively .    equation ( [ spectrum4 ] ) gives the low frequency johnson - nyquist noise on fractional quantum hall plateaus where there is no back scattering of composite fermions .",
    "in general the integral consists of separate contributions from each region where @xmath31 is parallel or antiparallel to @xmath35 at each of the edges of the 2deg that run between the source and drain in fig.[f2 ] .    let us consider now the case illustrated in fig.[f1](a ) where @xmath31 is parallel to @xmath35 far from the edges where the landau level filling @xmath157 is a jain fraction with @xmath158 a positive integer and @xmath159 an even positive integer .",
    "suppose initially for simplicity that that only the type iii composite fermion landau levels are present and that they empty one by one as the edge is approached .",
    "then @xmath152 in equation ( [ spectrum4 ] ) ranges from @xmath160 at the edge to @xmath161 , the number of occupied composite fermion levels in the bulk , and the johnson - nyquist noise ( including the contributions from both edges of the 2deg ) is given by @xmath162 this is just the nyquist formula @xmath163 since on a quantum hall plateau the two - terminal conductance @xmath164 is equal to the quantized hall conductance @xmath165 .",
    "now let us consider the contribution of the `` silent '' @xcite type i composite fermion landau levels in fig.[f1](a ) to @xmath166 .",
    "for these @xmath167 .",
    "let us suppose that the crossover from the type iii to the type i states occurs at a local landau level filling fraction @xmath168 where @xmath169 for the type iii states and at @xmath170 for the type i states .",
    "then @xmath171 and @xmath172 where the first integral is the contribution of the type iii states , the second ( third ) integral is that of the type i states for which @xmath31 is antiparallel ( parallel ) to @xmath35 .",
    "the limits of integration where @xmath173 correspond to @xmath31 passing through zero .",
    "evaluation of ( [ spectrumiii+i ] ) using the relation ( [ cross ] ) between @xmath174 and @xmath175 once again yields the same nyquist expression @xmath176 as was obtained above by considering the simpler model with _ only _ type iii composite fermion landau levels .",
    "thus although the silent type i levels contribute to the johnson- nyquist noise , remarkably , the _ total _ of the type i and type iii johnson - nyquist noise is the same whether the type i levels are present in the model or not .",
    "the johnson - nyquist noise on quantum hall plateaus for the case shown in fig.[f1](b ) where @xmath31 is antiparallel to @xmath35 far from the edges can be calculated similarly . here",
    "the landau level filling in the bulk is the jain fraction @xmath177 with @xmath158 a positive integer and @xmath159 an even positive integer . in this case",
    "_ only _ the type i levels contribute to the johnson- nyquist noise and the result of evaluating equation ( [ spectrum4 ] ) is @xmath178 once again in agreement with the nyquist formula @xmath163 .",
    "the result for @xmath166 is once again the same whether only the states with @xmath179 or both the states with @xmath179 and @xmath167 are included in the model .",
    "in this paper it has been shown that interactions between composite fermions must be included in composite fermion theories of electric current noise .",
    "the important interactions were found to be those mediated by the fictitious electric field generated by composite fermion current fluctuations .",
    "their effects must be calculated self - consistently .",
    "this was done analytically in mean field theory for systems with smooth edge potentials .",
    "the interactions were found to renormalize the current fluctuations and the charges of the quasi - particles associated with composite fermions , making the quasiparticles fractionally charged .",
    "analytic expressions were obtained for the charges of the quasiparticles in both the incompressible and compressible regions of composite fermion systems . in the incompressible regions the calculated fractions agree with previous theories . in the compressible regions",
    "the quasiparticle charge varies smoothly with position .",
    "it tends to zero where the effective magnetic field vanishes and becomes equal to the electron charge where the composite fermion density becomes zero .",
    "this theory of composite fermion current fluctuations and quasi - particle charge was then applied to an observable phenomenon by calculating the johnson - nyquist noise on fractional quantum hall plateaus where there is no back - scattering .",
    "the results obtained were in agreement with the nyquist formula @xmath1 .    the nyquist formula is usually derived from the fluctuation - dissipation theorem @xcite so that this result is not surprising .",
    "however the present derivation of the nyquist formula is of interest because it provides a good test of the mean field theory of current fluctuations and quasiparticle charge in this _ interacting _ system , and because it provides significant insights into the relationship between quasi - particle fractional charge , composite fermion edge states and current noise .",
    "some of these are :    the johnson - nyquist noise in the fractional quantum hall regime arises from _ compressible _ regions of the 2deg .",
    "it is therefore _ not _ primarily due to quasi - particles having the usually quoted values of the fractional charge that correspond to incompressible fractional quantum hall states .",
    "for example for the @xmath4 quantum hall state the johnson - nyquist noise arises from quasiparticles whose charges are for the most part _ not _ equal to @xmath180 of the electron charge but span a wide range of values .",
    "compressible edge channels associated with both the normal type iii and silent type i composite fermion landau level edge states@xcite contribute to the johnson - nyquist noise when they are present at the edge , and their contributions sum to yield the nyquist formula .",
    "shot noise differs from johnson - nyquist noise in that a finite voltage is applied to the sample and a non - zero average current flows . _",
    "both _ incompressible and compressible regions at the edge contribute to the current noise in this case .",
    "a full discussion of shot noise is beyond the scope of this paper , however it is already evident from the theory developed above that quasi - particles with a range of different values of the quasi - particle charge associated with compressible and incompressible strips at the sample edges will contribute to shot noise .",
    "thus the present work suggests that the arguments that have been used recently@xcite@xmath2 @xcite to infer a _",
    "single _ value of the fractional quasi - particle charge from shot noise measurements may need some refinement .",

    "<S> a composite fermion edge state theory of current fluctuations , fractional quasiparticle charge and johnson - nyquist noise in the fractional quantum hall regime is presented . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that composite fermion current fluctuations and the charges of the associated quasiparticles are strongly renormalized by the interactions between composite fermions . </S>",
    "<S> the important interaction is that mediated by the fictitious electric field associated with composite fermion currents . </S>",
    "<S> the dressed current fluctuations and quasiparticle charges are calculated self - consistently in a mean field theory for smooth edges . </S>",
    "<S> analytic results are obtained . </S>",
    "<S> the values of the fractional quasiparticle charges obtained agree with the predictions of previous theories in the incompressible regions of the 2deg where those theories apply . in the compressible regions the magnitudes of the quasiparticle charges vary with position . since johnson - nyquist noise arises from the compressible regions , it is due to quasiparticles whose charges differ from the simple fractions of @xmath0 that apply in the incompressible regions . </S>",
    "<S> never the less , the nyquist noise formula @xmath1 is obeyed on fractional quantum hall plateaus . </S>",
    "<S> some implications for the interpretation of recent shot noise measurements in the fractional quantum hall regime are briefly discussed . </S>"
