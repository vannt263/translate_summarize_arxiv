    "high - redshift quasars therefore offer a a test of hierarchical cosmology operating at its extreme ( efstathiou & rees , 1988 ; turner , 1991 ) .",
    "the signatures of high overdensity , for example the biased evolution of the surrounding region , can in principle be detected observationally by targetting quasars and their environs ( e.g. in the submm , ivison et al . 2000 ) .    here",
    ", we report continuum submillimetre observations , made with the scuba bolometer array on the james clerk maxwell telescope , of a sample of some of the highest - redshift quasars currently known .",

    "telescope pointing was checked frequently .",
    "sky opacity was monitored via regular skydips at 850 and 450@xmath11 m , and continuously at 225ghz via the jcmt water vapour monitor and the cso tau meter : over the whole set of observations , @xmath32 ranged between @xmath33 .",
    "data were reduced with both the orac - dr pipeline and the surf software .    both sdss j1044@xmath50125 and sdss j1306 + 0356 were reobserved , after showing some inconsistencies in their initial datasets : the detections were confirmed in each case . for example , during initial observation of sdss j1306 + 0356 , in november 2001 , the final two blocks of integrations were inconsistent with the data taken over the preceding few hours .",
    "their mean signals were zero or negative , where the others had throughout been strongly positive .",
    "this marked change in consistency coincided not only with deteriorating weather ( seeing poorer than 4 arcsec ) , but with sunrise , and consequent fleeting changes in atmosphere , dish figure and absolute pointing accuracy .",
    "we reobserved the quasar under good , stable conditions ( seeing 0.5 arcsec , @xmath34 ) , conditions in march 2002 .",
    "the signal thereby obtained was consistent with the first seven blocks from the previous november .",
    "the final flux quoted in table 1 therefore consists of the november data minus the last two blocks , plus the march data .",
    "adding back the suspect data would give @xmath35=3.1@xmath360.9mjy a signal - to - noise which is still greater than three .",
    "scuba consists of two detector arrays , dedicated respectively to long- and short - wavelength observations in this case 850 and 450@xmath11 m . the atmospheric transmission decreases with frequency , hence the long - wave array is the usual primary instrument .",
    "nevertheless , 450@xmath11 m data are obtained _ gratis _ , and they are here of particular interest , for they provide important constraints on the physical temperature of the dust .",
    "450@xmath11 m fluxes are thus included in table 1 for reference , however none of the sources was detected in the band .",
    "observations were made under a wide range of atmospheric conditions ( 450@xmath11 m opacities @xmath37 ) , resulting in a very heterogeneous set of rms values , between 10 and 100mjy .",
    "we emphasise that accurate calibration of these short - wavelength observations is possible only under the very best observing conditions .",
    "for comparison , the relative errors in flux calibration with the 850 and 450 arrays are typically 510 percent and @xmath38 percent , respectively .",

    "how does a black hole of such mass form ? imposing the maximum available time of @xmath851gyr implies an average accretion rate of 5 . in comparison , assuming an ( optimistic ) radiative efficiency @xmath86 ( where @xmath87 ) , an ( instantaneous ) accretion rate of @xmath88 is required to fuel the bolometric power inferred from the optical .",
    "the @xmath89-folding time for eddington accretion is @xmath90gyr ; starting from a @xmath91 seed ( e.g. haehnelt , natarajan & rees , 1998 ) , an observed redshift of @xmath54=6 would require a formation redshift @xmath54=1018 in the @xmath22 cosmology , but an upper limit longer than the age of the universe in the matter - dominated cosmology .    in the local universe ,",

    "both pm01 and archibald et al . (",
    "2002 ) consider this matter .",
    "they propose a simple model in which a black hole exponentiating according to the eddington rate , and an elliptical host galaxy forming stars and dust at roughly constant rate , conspire to produce a submm - luminous agn just before the gaseous fuel supply is exhausted . in a future paper",
    ", we will consider a wider range of possibilities .",
    "we have presented scuba 850@xmath11 m observations a sample of quasars at @xmath1 where the youth of the universe itself ( @xmath71gyr ) starts to become a constraint on the histories of accretion and star formation detecting four sources at 850@xmath11 m .",
    "the few 1.2mm850@xmath11 m spectral indices that we can determine are consistent with thermal reradiation from dust ; and deep 450@xmath11 m limits imply that the dust is cool ( @xmath68k ) , consistent with their siblings at @xmath92 ( priddey & mcmahon , 2001 ) .",

    "we are pursuing a range of follow - up observations designed to investigate such a scenario .",
    "for example , submillimetre imaging of the fields of high - redshift agn has been used ( e.g. ivison et al . 2000 ) to test for biased galaxy formation . in this spirit , we have obtained scuba jiggle maps of three of the sources from the current sample , and our findings will be reported in a forthcoming paper ( isaak et al . in prep . ) .",
    "an important quantifier of the evolutionary state of the sources themselves will be obtained through detection of carbon monoxide emission lines , which would reveal the existence of reservoirs of molecular gas indicative of star formation .",
    "simultaneously , it will be essential to improve the constraints on the infrared / submm seds of these quasars , to confirm the presence of dust , differentiate between agn- and starburst - powered components and improve estimates of the dust mass and star formation rate . and of no less importance is the need to obtain high resolution optical / near - infrared images of the quasars , to assess the probable effects of gravitational lensing .",
    "it is an oft - cited consequence of the negative submm @xmath93-correction that it hypothetically permits an unidentified scuba source to lie at a redshift as high as ten , without being intrinsically more luminous than a local object like arp220 .",
    "the difficulty of optically identifying such a source has prevented this claim becoming more than hypothetical .",
    "now , however , the submillimetre study of samples of quasars at @xmath1 provides a ready means of inferring the properties indeed the very existence of dust within one gigayear of the big bang .",
