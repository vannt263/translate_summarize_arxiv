    "domain growth laws due to domain coarsening has been studied in a wide variety of systems .",
    "domain growths in ferromagnets , binary alloys , and binary fluids are typical examples .",
    "the equilibrium properties of a binary alloy as well as a ferromagnet with uniaxial anisotropy can be well modeled by the ising model . however , the dynamics of domain coarsening in the binary alloy , where the population in each component is conserved , are different from that of non - conserved fields . for two - dimensional ( 2d ) conserved scalar fields , the diffusive transport of the order parameter leads to the domain growth law @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the domain size and @xmath2 is time , which is slower than the domain growth @xmath3 for non - conserved fields  @xcite .",
    "the situation is more complicated in a binary fluid where fluid flow also contributes to the transport of the order parameter .",
    "when diffusion dominates domain growth , the growth law reduces to that of binary alloy : @xmath4 .",
    "however , @xmath5 when the viscous force is dominant  @xcite .",
    "if the inertia of the fluid is important , the domain size grows as @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "magnetic domain patterns are observed in a ferromagnetic bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) as well as a ferromagnet .",
    "recent techniques for imaging of magnetization profiles in ferromagnetic becs have developed to investigate the real - time dynamics of magnetization , such as spin texture formation and nucleation of spin vortices  @xcite .",
    "a striking feature of a ferromagnetic bec that is distinct from solid - state ferromagnets is that it supports superflow of constituent atoms .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to find out the effect of the superflow on the domain growth law .",
    "spin dynamics of a ferromagnetic bec is well described by gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation  @xcite , which reduces to the hydrodynamic equation in the low energy limit .",
    "the hydrodynamic equation has been employed to investigate instabilities  @xcite , configurations of skyrmions and spin textures  @xcite , and domain pattern dynamics  @xcite . in the presence of an energy dissipation ,",
    "the hydrodynamic equation has essentially the same form as an extended landau - lifshitz - gilbert ( llg ) equation , which describes magnetization dynamics in conducting ferromagnets , where the electric current in the extended llg equation corresponds to the superfluid current @xmath7 in the dissipative hydrodynamic equation  @xcite .",
    "the analogy between the dissipative hydrodynamic equation and the extended llg equation has motivated us to investigate domain growth in ferromagnetic becs .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the effects of @xmath8 on the magnetic domain growth in ferromagnetic becs for ising - like cases , where longitudinal magnetization is dominant . in our previous work",
    ", it was demonstrated that the superfluid flow has an effect to make domain formation faster when the longitudinal magnetization is dominant in a ferromagnetic bec  @xcite .",
    "the focus of this work is on the scaling behavior of domain growth and the growth laws .",
    "we use both the hydrodynamic equation and the gp equation to investigate the magnetic domain pattern formation in ( quasi-)2d systems . by making use of the hydrodynamic equation and artificially turning on and off the @xmath8 term",
    ", we can find out the effect of @xmath8 on the domain growth dynamics .",
    "we also discuss the effect of dissipation , which was originally introduced in a phenomenological manner .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",

    "we consider a spin-1 bec of @xmath9 atoms under a uniform magnetic field applied in the @xmath10 direction confined in a spin - independent optical trap @xmath11 .",
    "the mean - field energy @xmath12 of the system is composed of the kinetic energy @xmath13 , trapping potential energy @xmath14 , the zeeman energy @xmath15 , and the interatomic interaction energy @xmath16 : @xmath17 .",
    "the former three are respectively given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the condensate wave function for the atoms in the magnetic sublevel @xmath20 , @xmath21 is an atomic mass , and @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the linear and quadratic zeeman energies per atom , respectively .",
    "the wave function is normalized to satisfy @xmath24 since the total longitudinal magnetization of an atomic cloud , which is isolated in vacuum , is conserved , the linear zeeman effect merely induces the larmor precession of atomic spins , which can be eliminated when we move onto the rotating frame of reference .",
    "hence , we set @xmath25 in this paper . on the other hand ,",
    "the quadratic zeeman energy is tunable by means of a linearly polarized microwave field and takes both positive and negative values  @xcite .",

    "the interaction coefficients @xmath29 and @xmath30 are related to the spin-@xmath31 _ s_-wave scattering length @xmath32 as @xmath33 and @xmath34 . here , we consider only the short - range interaction and neglect the long - range magnetic dipole - dipole interaction ( mddi ) , since we are interested in the effect of the superfluid flow on the growth dynamics of magnetic domains , which is dominated by the interplay between the kinetic energy and the short - range ( ferromagnetic ) interaction .",
    "the mddi is expected to determine the characteristic length scale of the magnetic structure in long - time dynamics , and therefore , unfavorable for the study of domain growth .",
    "we first briefly review the magnetism of spin-1 becs .",
    "the magnetism of spin-1 becs is determined by the interplay between the spin - dependent interatomic interaction [ the @xmath30-term in eq .  ] and the quadratic zeeman effect .",
    "it is obvious from eq .",
    "that , in the absence of the quadratic zeeman effect , the condensate is fully - magnetized ( @xmath35 ) for a negative @xmath30 , and non - magnetized ( @xmath36 ) for a positive @xmath30 .",
    "the former is referred to as the ferromagnetic phase and the latter is the polar or antiferromagnetic phase  @xcite . since we are interested in ferromagnetic becs , we assume @xmath37 in this paper .",
    "spin-1 @xmath38rb atoms are known to be ferromagnetic .",
    "the quadratic zeeman effect introduces an easy plane ( @xmath39 ) or an easy axis ( @xmath40 ) of the spontaneous magnetization . as seen from eq .",
    ", the quadratic zeeman effect enhances the population in the @xmath41 state for @xmath39 and those in the @xmath42 state for @xmath40 .",
    "suppose that the quadratic zeeman effect is much weaker than the ferromagnetic interaction .",
    "then , the condensate is fully - magnetized .",
    "because the order parameter for a fully - magnetized state in the direction @xmath43 is given by  @xcite @xmath44 the population in the @xmath41 component becomes maximum at @xmath45 , whereas those in the @xmath46 and @xmath47 component becomes maximum at @xmath48 and @xmath49 , respectively .",
    "hence , the magnetization arises in the @xmath50-@xmath51 plane for @xmath39 and in the @xmath52 or @xmath53 direction for @xmath40 .",
    "the former case corresponds to the @xmath54 model and the latter the ising model .",
    "now , we move to dynamics .",
    "the dynamics of a spinor bec is well described with the time - dependent multi - component gp equation  @xcite : @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the chemical potential .",
    "we phenomenologically introduce an energy dissipation by replacing @xmath57 in eq .   with @xmath58  @xcite .",
    "under this replacement , the chemical potential becomes time - dependent so as to conserve the total number of atoms .",
    "then , using eqs .   and",
    ", we obtain the dissipative gp equation as @xmath59    \\psi_m(\\bm{r},t)\\nonumber\\\\   & \\ \\ \\ \\ + c_1 \\sum_{n=-1}^1 \\sum_{\\nu = x , y , z } f_\\nu(\\bm    r , t)(f_{\\nu})_{mn}\\psi_n(\\bm r , t ) .",

    "the bec can be treated as a fully magnetized gas , namely , the amplitude of the spin density is given by @xmath35 and only its direction varies in space .",
    "in such a situation , the physical quantities that describe the dynamics of the ferromagnetic bec are the normalized spin vector @xmath61 and the superfluid velocity @xmath62 , which is defined as the sum of currents in all spin components : @xmath63 .",
