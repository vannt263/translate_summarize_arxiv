    "because the solution of the yang - mills equations we need is defined with retarded boundary conditions , its value at the points @xmath30 and @xmath88 ( where the observable is measured ) is fully determined if we know its value on an initial surface @xmath89 which is locally space - like , the vector @xmath90 normal to @xmath89 at the point @xmath91 ( @xmath92 for any displacement @xmath93 on @xmath89 around the point @xmath91 ) must be time - like .",

    "this modification of the current will in turn induce an additional contribution to the field fluctuation .",

( [ eq : green - tmp5 ] ) ( which , as explained in section [ sec : log ] , leads to a logarithmic divergence ) ; it would thus be incorrect to keep the latter while not considering the former .",
    "there are two ways to deal with this issue : keep track separately of these two terms , or try to combine them into a single term .",
    "the second option is the simplest , and from the above considerations , we know how to achieve it : by rotating the fluctuation @xmath139 , @xmath587 , we can rewrite the boundary term as @xmath588(x ) = \\omega^\\dagger(x ) \\int\\limits_{y^-=0}dy^+d^2\\y_\\perp\\ ; \\big\\ { \\big[\\partial^y_\\mu\\big(d^{\\rho \\mu}_{0,{}_r}(x , y)\\big ] \\omega(y)a^-(y ) \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\qquad -d^{\\rho -}_{0,{}_r}(x , y)\\big[\\partial_y^\\mu \\omega(y)a_\\mu(y)\\big ] -d^{\\rho i}_{0,{}_r}(x , y)\\;2\\partial_y^-\\ , \\omega(y)a^i(y ) \\big\\}\\ ; , \\label{eq : green - tmp6}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have now only bare propagators .",
    "this is why the most convenient definition of @xmath200 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : t - def ] ) involves functional derivatives with respect to @xmath589 rather than @xmath139 itself with and without the @xmath199 are exactly equivalent .",
    "but if we did not include the @xmath199 in the definition , the logarithmic divergences would come from a combination of the second and third terms of eq .",
    "( [ eq : t - def ] ) , instead of being limited to the third term if we include the @xmath199 in the definition of @xmath200 . ] .",
    "note that for this discussion to hold , it is only necessary that the background field is a pure gauge in the vicinity above the initial surface , since the derivative is with respect to a coordinate on this initial surface . whether the background field is",
    "a pure gauge everywhere above the initial surface is not important .",
    "in the derivation of the jimwlk equation , one makes use of several formulas involving the bare two - dimensional propagators .",
    "these formulas are not new  : all of them have already been used in one form or another in previous papers discussing the jimwlk equation .",
    "we compile them in this appendix , with their derivation , as a convenient reference for the reader .",
    "let us denote @xmath590 a green s function of the 2-dimensional laplacian operator , @xmath591 it admits a simple fourier representation , @xmath592 note that this object suffers from an infrared problem , which is obvious for dimensional reasons : this propagator is a dimensionless object in coordinate space , invariant under translations and rotations , and therefore it must be a function of @xmath593 where @xmath482 is some mass scale that was not present in the previous equation .",
    "derivatives of this propagator do not suffer from this infrared ambiguity .",
    "consider for instance . ]",
    "@xmath594 from its symmetries and dimension , it is obvious that this derivative can be written as @xmath595 where the prefactor @xmath596 is dimensionless . because the derivative of the propagator is not infrared singular , the cutoff @xmath482 can not appear in its expression and @xmath596 must be a pure number ( otherwise it would have to be a function of @xmath593 to have the correct dimension ) . in order to determine the constant ,",
    "take another derivative @xmath597 and integrate over @xmath218 the resulting equation over some domain @xmath199 of the plane that contains the point @xmath598 . on the left hand side",
    ", we get the integral of a delta function since @xmath599 is a green s function of @xmath600 .",
    "we then get @xmath601 the right hand side can be transformed by using the 2-dimensional stokes theorem , leading to an integral on the boundary of @xmath199 ( oriented counter - clockwise ) @xmath602 where @xmath603 is completely antisymmetric ( @xmath604 ) .",
    "the contour integral in this equation is a topological quantity , that depends only on the winding number of the contour @xmath605 around the point @xmath598 .",
    "thus , it is best calculated by deforming @xmath605 into the unit circle around the point @xmath598 .",
    "we get easily @xmath606 thus we have @xmath607    the second derivative of the propagator is also useful in the derivation of the jimwlk equation . by applying @xmath608 to the previous equation ,",
    "one obtains @xmath609\\ ; .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this formula , although perfectly correct for @xmath610 , is incorrect at the point @xmath611 . in order to see this ,",
    "take the trace over the indices @xmath248 and @xmath612 . in the left hand side",
    ", we have the laplacian of the propagator , i.e. @xmath613 , while the right hand side would give zero .",
    "thus the full formula for the second derivative is @xmath614 with @xmath615\\ ; . \\label{eq : dijg1}\\ ] ] this function @xmath325 obeys an interesting identity . by integration by parts",
    ", one can check that @xmath616 using now eq .",
