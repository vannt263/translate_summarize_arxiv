    "measurement in quantum theory substantially differs from that in classical theory .",
    "one can not identify the state of a system by measurement on a single sample .",
    "in addition , measurement always disturbs the system .",
    "the limitation of manipulating quantum systems can be understood as being imposed by these characteristics of quantum measurement .",
    "an example is the no - cloning theorem  @xcite which states that it is impossible to create identical copies of an arbitrary quantum state .",
    "if one could make a clone , then one could extract complete information from a single state by creating infinitely many copies thereof , which contradicts quantum mechanics .",
    "other examples are the facts that one can not discriminate non - orthogonal states perfectly and that one can not measure non - commuting observables without errors . in presence of such impossibility , many researchers study how well one can perform these tasks mentioned above .",
    "imperfect cloning  @xcite , state discrimination  @xcite and uncertainty relations for noise and disturbance  @xcite are examples of the studies that make a quantitative assessment of ability to realize the tasks approximately .",
    "we would like to discuss an aspect of the limitations of quantum operation that one can not protect states against noise .",
    "here we use the word `` noise '' in a wide sense so that it refers to any irreversible dynamics induced by environments . in classical systems , one can protect a state against the irreversible dynamics ( noise ) if accurate measurements and operations can be done and if the state is not a statistical mixture , by taking the complete record of the state before the noise affects the system . in quantum theory , it is not the case even if the state is pure .",
    "measurement can not be done accurately and disturbs the state .",
    "nevertheless , one can still consider operations which approximately reverse the noise .",
    "such approximate operations reveal the limit beyond which the noise can not be suppressed any further .",
    "it also is interesting to understand the role which measurement plays for the task .",
    "noise suppression , the attempt to protect a certain class of states against given noise , is an important problem in the field of quantum control .",
    "many researchers are working on the problem in various ways .",
    "some try to protect a few states , while others try to protect all the pure states .",
    "the approaches are further classified by whether one uses _ ex - post _ control only or _",
    "ex - ante _ and _ ex - post _ control together , where we mean by ex - ante and ex - post control the quantum measurements / operations performed before and after , respectively , the noise process .",
    "for the problem of protecting two states , braczyk _",
    "et al_.  @xcite obtained the optimal ex - post control for the dephasing noise .",
    "after a while , mendona _",
    "et al_.  @xcite gave a method for constructing the optimal ex - post control for arbitrary noise .",
    "compared to the protection of two states , protecting all the pure states is more difficult and challenging .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite pointed out a part of the difficulty ; they prove that ex - post control alone can not suppress the depolarizing noise at all .",
    "korotkov and keane  @xcite considered ex - ante control as well as ex - post control and found that it is possible to protect , to some extent , all the pure states of a qubit against the amplitude damping noise . along this line ,",
    "wang _ et al . _",
    "@xcite made a further study using numerical methods .",
    "we remark that there are still many other approaches to reducing the effect of decoherence in a wider context  @xcite .        in this paper , we discuss protection of all the pure states against noise by ex - ante and ex - post control ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : antepost ] ) .",
    "first , we restrict ourselves to the scheme with ex - post control alone and discuss if it can suppress the effect of noise . in the case of the two - dimensional hilbert space ( a qubit )",
    ", we prove that the suppression is impossible for any type of noise ( theorem  [ theo : kekka1 ] ) .",
    "this result , generalizing a part of ref .",
    "@xcite , reveals the decisive necessity of ex - ante control if one wishes to protect all the pure states .",
    "next , we consider the scheme with both ex - ante and ex - post control .",
    "we focus on the depolarizing noise , whose isotropic property make the suppression task more difficult , and thus suitable to see the improvement thanks to ex - ante control",
    ". then we show , in theorem  [ theo : kekka2 ] , that the optimal control protocols are rather simple and easy to understand classically and ex - ante control is useful only when the noise is strong ( theorem  [ theo : kekka2 ] ) .",

    "the optimal ex - post control protocol is a unitary transformation .",

    "if the noise is infinitesimally weak , it is natural that doing nothing is better than the other protocols .",
    "if the noise is so strong that the state is completely destroyed after the noise process , one should obtain information on the initial state as much as possible before the system goes through the noise process .",
    "the result implies that there is no intermediate regime where the optimal protocol involves weak measurements .",

    "this provides evidence for conjecture  [ conj : kekka3 ] .",
    "we have discussed the problem of protecting completely unknown states against given noise by ex - ante and ex - post control scheme . a protocol in the scheme",
    "is described mathematically by @xmath306 where @xmath307 is the cp instrument with the set @xmath308 of outcomes applied before the system goes through the noise and @xmath290 are the tpcp maps applied after the system suffered the noise . to evaluate the closeness of the input and output states , we have chosen the average fidelity @xmath73 between the input and output states , which is linear in @xmath309 and @xmath290 .",
    "we have shown in theorem [ theo : kekka1 ] that when the scheme involves ex - post control only , one essentially can not suppress any given noise .",
    "in other words , all one can do is to cancel the unitary rotational part of the noise , if one is completely ignorant of the input state .",
    "next , we have considered ex - ante - ex - post control scheme , focusing on the depolarizing noise .",
    "we have shown in theorem  [ theo : kekka2 ] that the optimal average fidelity is achieved by protocols which are not `` truly quantum , '' or can be understood classically .",
    "namely , if the noise is weak , the `` do nothing '' protocol is optimal , which does nothing to the system literally , and no other protocol can make a larger average fidelity .",
    "if the noise is strong , the `` discriminate & reprepare '' protocol is optimal . in the protocol ,",
    "one completely measures the system beforehand , discards the resulting state and reconstructs the state estimated from the measurement .",
    "the theorems above are for the two - dimensional hilbert space .",
    "finally , we have proposed conjecture  [ conj : kekka3 ] that theorem  [ theo : kekka2 ] is essentially true for any dimensionality , or more precisely , the optimal average fidelity is achieved either by the `` do nothing '' or `` discriminate & reprepare '' protocol . we have found numerical evidence to support the conjecture in the three - dimensional hilbert space .",
    "a natural question to ask is whether the result similar to theorem  [ theo : kekka2 ] holds or not for noise other than the depolarizing noise .",
    "this is not the case at least for the amplitude damping noise , e.g. spontaneous emission ; it is shown numerically that there exists a quantum protocol that can do better than the `` do nothing '' and `` discriminate & reprepare '' protocols  @xcite .",
    "our result suggests that noise suppression for completely unknown input states is impossible except by using the bias or anisotropy of the noise itself even when one includes the ex - ante control in the scheme .",
    "we note that the depolarizing noise is isotropic in the sense that it commutes with arbitrary unitary operations .",
    "thus our result may be understood as describing the fundamental limitations of quantum mechanics from the viewpoint of noise suppression .",
    "it is worth pursuing which class of noise allows nontrivial suppression and identifying the optimal controls therein . in particular",
    ", it may be important to examine whether theorem  [ theo : kekka2 ] can be extended to all unital noise , the noise that preserves the completely mixed state .",
    "our numerical calculations suggest that it is true at least for the dephasing noise .",
    "let us discuss our results further in the fundamental aspect : irreversibility of quantum processes .",
    "while unitary operations describe reversible processes only , tpcp maps include irreversible processes .",
    "then it is natural to ask to what extent a given tpcp map has irreversibility . for an operator on a hilbert space , the polar decomposition extracts its `` irreversible '' part uniquely .",
    "however , as far as we know , there is no such a simple and canonical decomposition for tpcp maps , which are operators on banach spaces .",
    "this fact makes it difficult to define the irreversible part of a given tpcp map . in some sense ,",
    "our work is an attempt to address this problem from the viewpoint of control theory . using ex - ante and ex - post",
    ", we try to cancel an effect of a given tpcp map ( noise ) and define operationally the irreversible part as what still remains .",
    "in theorem [ theo : kekka1 ] , we sought approximate left inverse of a given tpcp map and find it to be a unitary operation .",
    "it is not trivial that the approximate left inverse is unique and reversible , which is the conclusion of our theorem . in theorem [ theo :",
    "kekka2 ] , using both ex - ante and ex - post control , we found that the irreversible part of the depolarizing noise is itself when the noise is weak .",
