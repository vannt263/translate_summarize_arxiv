    "cygnus  x-1 has been one of the most intensively studied x - ray sources in the sky since its discovery and identification with the o9.7 iab supergiant star , hde 226868 @xcite .",
    "this system provided the first evidence for the existence of stellar mass black holes when it was discovered to be a 5.6 day binary with a massive , unseen companion .",
    "@xcite used the spectroscopic orbit @xcite , light curve @xcite , photospheric line broadening , and a range in the assumed degree of roche - filling of the supergiant star to obtain mass estimates of @xmath4 and @xmath5 . @xcite",
    "derived physical parameters for the visible supergiant based upon a spectroscopic analysis of the line spectrum , and they adopted a system inclination of @xmath6 ( based upon published estimates ) to arrive at mass estimates of 18 and @xmath7 for the supergiant and black hole , respectively ( the derived masses scale as @xmath8 over the probable range of @xmath9 ; @xcite ) . the x - ray source in cyg  x-1",
    "is powered mainly by accretion from the strong stellar wind of the supergiant star @xcite .",
    "in fact , cyg  x-1 probably represents a situation intermediate between pure , spherical wind accretion and accretion by roche lobe overflow .",
    "observations of the optical emission lines @xcite indicate that the wind departs from spherical symmetry and that there exists an enhanced wind flow ( or `` focused wind '' ) in the direction of the companion .",
    "the intense x - ray emission is believed to be produced close to the black hole in an accretion disk that emits soft x - ray photons and in a hot corona that inverse - compton scatters low energy photons to higher energies @xcite .",
    "ultraviolet radiation from close to the black hole has been detected through high speed photometer observations with the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "radio jets were recently discovered in cyg  x-1 @xcite indicating a collimated outflow with a speed in excess of @xmath10 , so that cyg  x-1 joins the group of galactic _ microquasars _ , small scale versions of active galactic nuclei @xcite .",
    "the target is also a candidate @xmath11-ray transient source @xcite ; the @xmath11-rays are probably created through inverse - compton scattering in the jets .",
    "cyg  x-1 is generally found in either a low / hard state ( the more common case of low 2 - 10 kev flux and a hard energy spectrum ) or a high / soft state ( in which the soft x - ray flux increases dramatically and the spectrum softens ; @xcite ) .",
    "every few years cyg  x-1 makes a transition from the low / hard to the high / soft state , and it remains in this active state for weeks to months before returning to the low / hard state .",
    "the last well documented high / soft state occurred in 1996 @xcite , and in 2001 september cyg  x-1 once again entered a high / soft state in which it still remains at the time of writing ( 2002 september ) .",
    "this recent transition into the high / soft state was accompanied by a sudden decrease in radio flux @xcite ( the opposite of the radio brightening that accompanied the return to the low / hard state in 1971 and that led directly to the identification of the visible star associated with the x - ray source ; @xcite ) .",
    "there are many theories about the causes of the transitions @xcite which generally relate to the physical conditions of the gas surrounding the black hole .",
    "for example , @xcite describe the transitions in terms of an advection - dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) model in which the transitions are related to changes in the inner radius of the geometrically thin , optically thick , keplerian disk . in the usual low / hard state",
    ", the inner disk radius is relatively large , but during the high / soft state the inner radius extends inwards close to the last stable orbit around the black hole .",
    "the transition to the high / soft state is generally believed to be the result of a moderate increase in the mass accretion rate .",
    "however , there is no clear observational evidence available to support the claim of enhanced mass transfer during the high / soft state .",
    "in fact , the evidence collected so far hints that the supergiant mass loss rate may actually decline during the high / soft state .",
    "@xcite present a model for the x - ray light curve of cyg  x-1 during the prolonged low / hard state based upon the accumulated data from the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer satellite _ ( rxte ) all sky monitor ( asm ) instrument ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "they find that the decreased x - ray flux observed when the supergiant is in the foreground can be explained by the x - ray absorption caused by the wind outflow from the supergiant .",
    "however , during the high / soft state the orbital variation in x - ray flux disappears , and wen et al",
    ".  argue that the wind absorption declines because of increased photoionization of the wind by the stronger x - ray source and a decrease in the wind density ( implying a factor of 2 decrease in the mass loss rate ) .",
    "@xcite found that the h@xmath0 emission associated with the wind loss also declined during the 1996 high / soft state .",
    "taken at face value , these observations suggest that the wind mass loss actually declines during a high / soft state , in contradiction to the theoretical expectations",
    ".    in this paper we report on multiple year observations of the h@xmath0 emission line in hde 226868 (  2 ) which we find to show significant long term and short term variability (  3 ) , presumably reflecting changes in the wind close to the supergiant .",
    "the rxte / asm instrument has provided continuous x - ray flux measurements of the binary throughout this period , and we show that temporal variations in the x - ray flux are broadly anti - correlated with the h@xmath0 emission strength (  4 ) .",
    "we discuss the implications of this result , and we suggest that the state transitions may result from changes in the wind velocity that are related to the ionization state of the wind (  5 ) .",
    "the 115 optical spectra were made from three different sites over the period from 1998 august to 2002 may , and we list in the final column of table  1 the specific telescope and spectrograph combination associated with each observation .",
    "the majority of the spectra were obtained with the kitt peak national observatory 0.9-m coude feed telescope in conjunction with a program on ss  433 .",
    "details about these observations are given in @xcite . during the observing runs in 1998 and 2000",
    ", we used the long collimator , grating b ( in second order with order sorting filter og550 ) , camera 5 , and a ford @xmath12 ccd ( f3 kb ) detector .",
    "this arrangement produced a resolving power , @xmath13 , and covered a range of 829   around h@xmath0 .",
    "the kpno coude feed runs in 1999 , however , relied upon the short collimator , grating rc181 ( in first order with a gg495 filter to block higher orders ) , and camera 5 with the same f3 kb detector , and this set up provided lower resolving power , @xmath14 , but broader spectral coverage ( 1330  ) .",
    "we usually obtained two consecutive exposures of 30 minutes duration and co - added these spectra to improve the s / n ratio .",
    "we also observed the rapidly rotating a - type star , @xmath15  aql , which we used for removal of atmospheric water vapor lines .",
    "each set of observations was accompanied by numerous bias , flat field , and th  ar comparison lamp calibration frames .",
    "we also obtained in 1999 several high dispersion echelle spectra using the university of texas mcdonald observatory 2.1-m telescope and sandiford cassegrain echelle spectrograph @xcite .",
    "the detector was a reticon @xmath16 ccd ( ra2 ) with @xmath17 m square pixels which recorded 27 echelle orders covering the region blueward from h@xmath0 with a resolving power of @xmath18 .",
    "the exposure times were typically 30 minutes .",
    "the observations from 2001 to 2002 were made with the university of toronto david dunlap observatory ( ddo ) 1.9-m telescope .",
    "the ddo spectra were obtained with the cassegrain spectrograph and a thomson @xmath19 ccd .",
    "all but one of these spectra were made with a 1800 grooves mm@xmath20 grating that yielded a resolving power of @xmath21 .",
    "the exposure times were usually 20 minutes .",
    "the spectra were extracted and calibrated using standard routines in iraf .",
    "all the spectra were rectified to a unit continuum by the fitting of line - free regions using the iraf task _ continuum _ ( and in the case of the echelle spectra , the resulting orders were then linked together using the task _ scombine _ ) .",
    "the removal of atmospheric lines was done by creating a library of telluric standard spectra from each run , removing the broad stellar features from these , and then dividing each target spectrum by the modified atmospheric spectrum that most closely matched the target spectrum in a selected region dominated by atmospheric absorptions .",
    "the spectra from each run were then transformed to a common heliocentric wavelength grid .",
    "the higher resolution spectra were smoothed to the nominal , two pixel resolution of the lower resolution spectra obtained with the kpno coude feed and the rc181 grating .",
    "this degradation in resolution is inconsequential for the analysis of the broad structures in h@xmath0 that we describe here .",
    "we discuss below the spectral variations related to orbital phase , and in order to determine an accurate ephemeris for the orbit , we decided to measure radial velocities using the photospheric line @xmath1 .",
    "the red wing of this feature is blended with @xmath22 , which occasionally is filled in with weak , p  cygni type emission ( also observed in @xmath23 ) .",
    "we measured radial velocities by fitting a gaussian function to the central line core in order to avoid some of these problems with the line wings , but our final results are probably influenced by the varying strength of the p  cygni emission .",
    "we also measured the position of the interstellar line at 6613.56   in order to correct for small differences in the wavelength calibration from the different spectrographs ( this line is clear of the nearby @xmath24 emission line of the supergiant ) .",
    "we measured these differences by cross - correlating the profile of the interstellar line in each spectrum with the same profile obtained at kpno on hjd 2,451,425.8079 , and the measured stellar radial velocities were adjusted according to these cross - correlation shifts .",
    "the final radial velocity measurements are listed in table  1 .",
    "we made a solution of the orbital elements using the nonlinear , least - squares fitting program of @xcite .",
    "all the radial velocities were assigned the same weight in computing the solution , and we assumed a circular orbit @xcite . a first trial solution with a fitted period resulted in an orbital period that was the same within errors as that derived by @xcite based upon all the available radial velocity data , and since the data used by @xcite span a 26 year interval , we decided to fix the period at their value , @xmath25 d. we then solved for the remaining parameters : the epoch of supergiant inferior conjunction , @xmath26(ic ) , the semiamplitude , @xmath27 , and systemic velocity , @xmath28 .",
    "the measurements and radial velocity curve are shown in figure  1 , and our solution is compared to that of @xcite in table  2 .",
    "this table also lists the r.m.s .",
    "residuals from the fit , @xmath29 , the mass function , @xmath30 , and the projected component of the semimajor axis , @xmath31 .",
    "the individual observed minus calculated residuals , @xmath32 , and orbital phases , @xmath33 , are given in table  1 .",
    "our derived epoch is @xmath34 later than that predicted by ephemeris of @xcite , and we will use our new result in what follows .",
    "the semiamplitude is in good agreement with prior work @xcite , but the systemic velocity is somewhat low due to the subtle p  cygni emission in @xmath1 ( which causes the absorption core to appear slightly blue - shifted ) .",
    "thus , our estimate of @xmath28 is probably smaller than the physical systemic velocity of the binary .",
    "the h@xmath0 feature is regarded as a reliable source for the determination of the mass loss rate in luminous hot stars @xcite .",
    "the line appears as an absorption profile in stars with small mass loss rates , and it grows into a strong emission profile in stars with well developed winds .",
    "the emission forms by recombination , and since this process depends on the square of the gas density , the h@xmath0 feature serves as a probe of the dense , basal wind near the stellar photosphere .",
    "the observational evidence to date demonstrates that the h@xmath0 emission is also time variable , especially in luminous supergiants like the visible star in cyg  x-1 .",
    "@xcite show an example of large h@xmath0 emission variations over the course of a few days in the o9.5  ib star , @xmath15  ori , which presumably result from changes in the wind density and structure .",
    "@xcite discuss several cases of cyclical variability in h@xmath0 that is related to the rotational period of the star .",
    "the h@xmath0 feature in cyg  x-1 appears to be cyclically variable with the orbital period @xcite , but these earlier investigations were too limited in time coverage to reveal the large variations that can occur that are unrelated to orbital phase .",
    "both kinds of variability offer important clues about the structure and density of the wind outflow that is the ultimate source of the accretion fed x - ray luminosity .",
    "the h@xmath0 profiles in cyg  x-1 are often complex in appearance , and we decided to begin our analysis by measuring the overall emission strength through a simple numerical integration of the line intensity ( including both emission and absorption portions ) .",
    "this equivalent width , @xmath35 , was measured over a 40    range centered on h@xmath0 , and our results are listed in the fifth column of table  1 .",
    "the measurement errors can be estimated from the values obtained during the final kpno coude feed run when cyg  x-1 was usually observed twice each night . since the emission variations generally occur on longer time scales ( days ) , the scatter within a night mainly reflects measurement errors .",
    "the mean of the differences in equivalent width within each night indicate typical measurement errors of @xmath36  .",
    "we find that the equivalent width varied from @xmath37    ( absorption stronger than emission ) to @xmath38    ( emission much stronger than absorption ) over the course of our observations ( see fig .",
    "10 below ) .",
    "the variations have both a long term component ( significant differences between the mean equivalent widths of the individual observing runs ) and a rapid component ( large night - to - night changes ) .",
    "the emission generally weakened between 1998 and 2002 .",
    "a periodogram search indicated a possible small amplitude variation with a period of @xmath39  d , which is similar to the long x - ray and radio period of @xmath40  d found by @xcite .",
    "however , our sampling is too fragmentary to characterize accurately variations on timescales of months , and we focus here on profile variations that are related to orbital phase .",
    "we found that these were best seen when the profiles were grouped into samples with similar h@xmath0 equivalent width .",
    "figures 2 , 3 , and 4 illustrate the profiles as a function of heliocentric radial velocity and orbital phase for times between 1998 and 2000 of strong ( @xmath41  ) , moderate ( @xmath42  ) , and weak ( @xmath43  ) h@xmath0 emission , respectively .",
    "figure  5 shows the same for the ddo spectra ( 2001  2002 ) , obtained during the high / soft x - ray state when the h@xmath0 emission was generally weak .",
    "the upper panel in each diagram shows the observed profiles while the lower panel is a gray - scale representation of the profiles made through a linear interpolation in orbital phase .",
    "the thick line in figure  4 depicts the h@xmath0 profile observed on hjd 2,451,466.6863 , just 3 hours prior to the midpoint of the recent _ chandra _ observation of high resolution x - ray spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "the emission was weak at that time , and the relatively low column density found by @xcite probably results from the lower density in the wind at that epoch ( or possibly from higher x - ray ionization of the wind ; see  5 ) .",
    "each diagram shows the orbital motion of the supergiant star as a backwards `` s '' curve in the grayscale image , and there is clear evidence of this orbital motion in a blue - shifted absorption and a red - shifted emission feature ( perhaps best seen in the weaker emission profiles in figs .  4 and 5 ) .",
    "this is the characteristic p  cygni - type shape that is the hallmark of mass loss in luminous stars @xcite , and the association of this component with the wind of the supergiant in cyg  x-1 was demonstrated in earlier observations by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the overall shape and intensity of the p  cygni component is comparable to that observed in other o - type supergiants @xcite .",
    "the next striking feature in these diagrams is the appearance of large emission features in the wings of the profiles observed near the orbital conjunction phases , @xmath44 and 0.5 .",
    "these are most evident in the moderate and strong emission profiles ( figs .  3 and 2 ) .",
    "furthermore , we find that the central absorption component _ only _ appears at these conjunction phases in the strong emission case ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "the light curve solutions for cyg  x-1 @xcite indicate that the supergiant is close to filling its critical roche surface , and in such a situation the wind is predicted to develop enhanced mass outflow in the directions opposite and especially towards the black hole companion ( the focused stellar wind model of @xcite ) .",
    "we suggest that in the strong emission case the wind is substantially enhanced along the axis joining the stars and that at the conjunction phases we see the resulting emission with the largest values of projected radial velocity .",
    "these streams are also seen in partial projection against the disk of the star at the conjunctions ( which creates the strong absorption seen then ) while at other phases the emission is seen projected against the sky , resulting in an emission filling of the absorption core .",
    "the presence of clumps in the stream flowing towards the black hole may partially explain the temporal variations we observe and the prevalence of x - ray dips found near phase @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "all the sets of profiles show some evidence of very blue - shifted absorption near and shortly following @xmath45 , supergiant superior conjunction . at this orientation",
    "we view the focused outflow in the foreground , and we suggest that the blue - shifted absorption forms in the lower density , high latitude part of the flow we see projected against the stellar disk while the lower velocity blue - shifted emission originates in the denser equatorial part of the flow that is mainly projected against the sky .",
    "if we assume that the outflow velocity is the same in both the equatorial and our direction at @xmath45 , then the emission component radial velocity is equal to @xmath46 times the absorption component radial velocity ( where @xmath47 is the orbital inclination ) . for @xmath48 km  s@xmath20 and @xmath49 km  s@xmath20 , we derive an inclination of @xmath50 , which is consistent with the range of values derived from the light curve analysis ( @xmath51 ; @xcite ) and with the best fit model for x - ray light curve ( @xmath52 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the assumption of equal outflow velocities in these two directions is probably not fully valid .",
    "for example , @xcite find that the wind outflow is faster at high latitudes than in the high density equatorial domain , so our estimate of the inclination is probably a lower limit .",
    "the other important feature in the profile figures is the appearance of a blue - shifted emission component near @xmath53 .",
    "this emission component was also found in earlier observations , and it could originate in the focused wind flow @xcite and/or in high density gas near the black hole @xcite . in our earlier study of h@xmath0 @xcite",
    ", we presented a simplified scheme to isolate this moving component of emission based upon a doppler tomography algorithm .",
    "the basic assumption is that each profile represents the sum of a spectral component that moves with the established radial velocity curve of the supergiant ( the p  cygni component discussed above ) and a second component that moves with a sinusoidal radial velocity curve parameterized by a semiamplitude , @xmath54 , and an orbital phase of radial velocity maximum , @xmath55 .",
    "the tomography algorithm then uses an iterative corrections scheme @xcite to reconstruct the spectral line profiles for each component .",
    "we performed tomographic reconstructions over a grid of possible @xmath54 and @xmath55 values to find a solution that minimized the differences between the observed and reconstructed composite profiles .",
    "since we now have nearly an order of magnitude more spectra than presented in @xcite , we have repeated this procedure with one key difference .",
    "we showed above that the conjunction phase profiles have shapes that are dominated by enhanced outflow along the axis joining the stars , and this part of the emission will appear broader at conjunctions than at other phases . rather than introducing a third component with phase variable width , we decided to include only the non - conjunction phase observations ( @xmath56 and @xmath57 ) in which the emission contributions from the axial outflow will be narrow and more concentrated towards the line center ( reducing any confusion with the moving component seen blue - shifted near @xmath53 ) .",
    "the results of our tomographic grid search for the parameters of the moving component are illustrated in figure  6 in a plot of the root - mean - square ( rms ) residuals of the reconstruction fits .",
    "there are three regions in the parameter space that offer plausible solutions ( and all make comparably good fits ) .",
    "we show the reconstructed profiles for each set of parameters in figure  7 .",
    "the first , and in our opinion most plausible , solution ( marked `` a '' ) occurs for @xmath58 and @xmath59 km  s@xmath20 ( _ solid line _ ) .",
    "the reconstructed profiles show a well developed p  cygni profile for the component moving with the supergiant , while the second component is a single emission peak that moves with a large but approximately anti - phase motion ( probably associated with gas near the black hole ; see below ) .",
    "this radial velocity curve is shown as an `` s '' curve in the grayscale images of figures 2  5 .    a second solution ( marked `` b '' )",
    "is found near @xmath60 and @xmath61 km  s@xmath20 ( _ dotted line _ ) , and in this case the anti - phase moving component ( _ right hand panel _ ) is broader and double - peaked .",
    "this is close to the solution advocated in @xcite ( @xmath62 and @xmath63 km  s@xmath20 ) for which the doppler shifts resemble those observed in the @xmath64 emission line @xcite . nevertheless , the adoption of this solution for the moving component in h@xmath0 is problematical .",
    "first , the double - peaked structure of the reconstructed moving component suggests that it is a numerical artifact of a forced solution in which the slower moving emission is compensating for deeper blue absorption in the supergiant component .",
    "second , the enhanced axial outflow discussed above is not treated in this simple two - component approach , and this emission will tend to favor low velocity amplitude solutions ( indeed , if the conjunction phase profiles are included in the reconstructions , this solution becomes more favorable ) .",
    "for both of these reasons , we believe this second , low velocity solution is untenable .",
    "the final solution ( marked `` c '' ) is another numerical artifact in which the moving component moves in phase with the supergiant but with a higher velocity ( @xmath65 and @xmath66 km  s@xmath20 , _ dashed line _ ) . in this case , the moving component is a complex absorption line that modulates a double - peaked emission profile for the supergiant .",
    "we can rule out this last solution since there is almost certainly no physical scenario consistent with such properties .",
    "the simple , two - component model for the h@xmath0 profiles suggests that the feature results from wind loss from the supergiant ( the primary s p  cygni profile ) and gas emission with an anti - phase radial velocity curve .",
    "we can use the derived kinematical parameters of the second component to explore its location in the system .",
    "the orbital geometry is sketched in figure  8 in which we plot the system dimensions assuming that the supergiant is close to roche filling @xcite .",
    "the projected radial velocity vector derived for the moving component is the sum of an orbital velocity vector ( dependent on location in the system ) and a possible gas flow vector .",
    "the two simplest possibilities for these vector combinations are shown in the right side of the diagram . in the first case , we assume that the emitting gas cloud is centered along the axis joining the stars and that a small vector component of gas flow from the supergiant to the black hole is responsible for the slight phase shift of the emission .",
    "this might correspond , for example , to high density gas from the focused wind encountering the disk around the black hole .",
    "then , the black hole will be situated close to or somewhat beyond this emission location , implying a mass ratio of @xmath67 . on the other hand ,",
    "if we assume that the observed motion is entirely due to orbital motion , then the emission source is located slightly off axis , trailing the black hole .",
    "this could correspond to the location of a photoionization wake @xcite or a stream - disk interaction zone .",
    "the minimum disk radius estimate in the latter case would place the black hole at a position consistent with @xmath68 .",
    "all these possibilities suggest @xmath69 , which is consistent with the range of mass ratios admitted by the light curve solutions @xcite , but which is lower than the estimate derived from spectroscopic analysis of the supergiant by @xcite .",
    "if the moving emission component does originate in gas accreted near the black hole , then it is important to determine how the emission flux varies as the wind of the supergiant varies .",
    "we illustrate in figure  9 the reconstructed spectra of the supergiant and moving spectral components for the same four groupings of emission equivalent width shown earlier in figures 2  5 .",
    "we see that there is a reasonably good correlation between the strength of the supergiant p  cygni emission ( related to the wind mass loss rate ) and the strength of the moving emission component ( presumably related to the gas accreted by the black hole ) .",
    "we will return to the issue of wind accretion in  5 .",
    "the h@xmath0 emission and associated stellar wind variations could be related to the x - ray flux variations , since the wind is probably the main source of material accreted by the black hole . here",
    "we investigate the temporal variations through a comparison of the h@xmath0 equivalent width with the x - ray flux observed with the rxte / asm instrument @xcite .",
    "the asm records the x - ray flux in three bands ( 1.5  3 kev , 3  5 kev , and 5  12 kev ) , and we begin by plotting the daily average of the low energy band flux with the h@xmath0 equivalent width in figure  10 .",
    "our first runs occurred during the low / hard x - ray state when the soft x - ray flux was small .",
    "however , the observations made near hjd 2,451,896 correspond to a time of x - ray flaring , while the ddo runs cover the recent , extended high / soft state of cyg  x-1 .",
    "the general trend appears to be an anti - correlation between @xmath35(h@xmath0 ) and the soft x - ray flux , and this same relationship is also found in some of the rapid variations .",
    "figure  11 shows a detailed view of the co - variations observed during the third run in 1999 , this time depicting the higher time resolution , dwell by dwell , x - ray fluxes .",
    "the h@xmath0 emission strength shows a general night - to - night trend , which was interrupted during one night ( hjd 2,451,426.8 ) when the emission dropped significantly .",
    "we see that a small x - ray flare occurred at the same time as the h@xmath0 decrease .",
    "figure  12 shows an example of the reverse trend observed during our run with the best time coverage from 2000 december .",
    "here we see that the local maximum in h@xmath0 emission strength occurred at nearly the same time as a well documented minimum in soft x - ray flux ( hjd 2,451,898.6 ) .",
    "there appear to be no obvious time lags between the h@xmath0 and x - ray events , although our time resolution is limited by the near diurnal sampling of the h@xmath0 observations .",
    "we show the nature of the anti - correlation in all three x - ray bands in figure  13 . here",
    "we have made a linear time interpolation in the dwell by dwell x - ray fluxes in order to make the best approximation of the flux values at the specific times of the h@xmath0 observations .",
    "note that the x - ray flux varies significantly on timescales shorter than dwell by dwell sampling rate ( median interval of @xmath70 hours ) and that the x - ray and optical observations are often non - contemporaneous , so that our time - interpolation estimate of the x - ray flux may have large errors .",
    "the ddo observations made during the high / soft state are plotted as diamonds while all the earlier measurements are shown as plus signs .",
    "these plots show that whenever we observed the h@xmath0 emission to be stronger than @xmath3  , the x - ray flux was relatively low ( especially in the lower energy bands ) . on the other hand , when the h@xmath0 emission was weaker than this value , the x - ray flux appeared to vary over a wide range nearly independent of @xmath35 .",
    "we show a spectral hardness ratio in figure 14 which confirms the impression that the x - ray spectrum is generally harder when the h@xmath0 emission is stronger .",
    "these trends were first observed by @xcite ( based on data obtained during the 1996 high / soft state ) , and they also find confirmation in an important long term monitoring program of h@xmath0 made at the crimean astrophysical observatory ( a. e. tarasov 2002 , private communication ) .",
    "our results indicate that x - ray flux appears to be related to the state of the wind ( as observed in the h@xmath0 emission strength ) . when the h@xmath0 emission is strong the x - ray flux is consistently low , but when the emission is relatively weak the x - ray flux can cover a wide range in values .",
    "there are three processes that can potentially explain these observations : ( 1 ) x - ray photoionization of the wind leading to a decrease in h@xmath0 emissivity ; ( 2 ) wind - related changes in column density towards the x - ray source ; and ( 3 ) variations in wind strength that result in changes in accretion rate . here",
    "we argue that all three processes are required to help explain our results and that changes in the wind accretion rate may trigger the x - ray transitions in cyg  x-1 .",
    "the first possible explanation is that increased x - ray emission leads to heating of the wind and a corresponding decrease in h@xmath0 emissivity @xcite .",
    "@xcite show how the x - ray ionization of the wind in the low / hard state causes orbital variations in the ultraviolet p  cygni lines formed in the wind ( e.g. , the hatchett - mccray effect ; @xcite ) .",
    "the x - ray ionization effects become more severe in the high / soft state , and @xcite describe how the wind absorption effects decrease significantly in such highly ionized conditions .",
    "hydrogen is expected to be nearly fully ionized in the base of the wind irrespective of the x - ray state , but if the gas is heated by an elevated soft x - ray flux , then the h@xmath0 emissivity will drop ( @xmath71 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the best evidence for ionization - related variability is the reduction in h@xmath0 equivalent width we observed during the mini - flare of x - ray flux around hjd 2,451,426.8 ( fig .",
    "the increase in soft x - ray flux and reduction in h@xmath0 occurred more - or - less simultaneously ( within the time resolution of the data ) , as expected for the small light - travel time between the x - ray source and the facing hemisphere of the supergiant ( @xmath72 s ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the characteristic wind crossing time between components is approximately 10 hours , and our data , although sparse in time coverage , does not indicate any time lag of this order between the h@xmath0 and x - ray variations .",
    "this event occurred near orbital phase @xmath73 , and the two spectra we obtained then show h@xmath0 profiles with unusually deep absorption cores ( see fig .",
    "4 ) compared to observations on the preceding and following nights . at this orientation",
    "the wind between the stars was moving tangentially to our line of sight and the emission from this region , if present , would have filled in the line core .",
    "however , if this inner region was significantly photoionized by the x - ray mini - flare , then the residual emission in the line core would have vanished to produce the deeper absorption core .",
    "thus , the timing and line properties of this event suggest it was caused by x - ray photoionization .",
    "on the other hand , there are several lines of evidence that x - ray photoionization is not the dominant cause of the h@xmath0 variations .",
    "first , we would expect the anti - correlation between h@xmath0 emission and x - ray flux to be better defined than exhibited in figure  13 if x - ray photoionization drove the emission variations ( although the scatter may be partially the result of the poor time resolution and poor overlap of the h@xmath0 and x - ray observations ) .",
    "there are several examples ( especially during the x - ray low / hard state ) where we observed large excursions in the h@xmath0 emission while the x - ray flux was essentially constant ( fig .",
    "second , if x - ray photoionization significantly altered the h@xmath0 emissivity of the gas above the hemisphere facing the x - ray source , then we should observe changes in the shape of the supergiant s p  cygni component with orbital phase .",
    "the variations would be largest in the high / soft x - ray state and would result in decreased blue absorption near @xmath45 and decreased red emission near @xmath44 .",
    "the spectra observed in the high / soft x - ray state ( fig .",
    "5 ) show that the predicted changes may be present but are relatively minor in nature .",
    "third , we find evidence of large scale variations in the h@xmath0 emission that forms in the x - ray shadow above the hemisphere facing away from the x - ray source where no x - ray photoionization should occur .",
    "this region in the wind is best isolated in the radial velocity distribution of the emission near orbital phase @xmath74 when this backside outflow is the dominant contributor to the red - shifted peak of the p  cygni profile .",
    "however , given the probable low orbital inclination , this part of the profile also includes some contributions from the x - ray illuminated hemisphere .",
    "we show in figure  15 the red peak emission height for spectra obtained near this phase plotted against x - ray flux .",
    "these diagrams show that the strength of the emission component from the x - ray shadow region is generally independent of the x - ray flux level in both the low / hard ( _ plus signs _ ) and high / soft ( _ diamonds _ ) x - ray states , as expected for an emitting region sheltered by the supergiant .",
    "in contrast , we show in figure  16 the peak intensity of the blue emission peak isolated near orbital phase @xmath53 that displays evidence of an anti - correlation between h@xmath0 emission and x - ray flux as expected for irradiated gas close to the black hole (  3 ) .",
    "the large range in the strength of the h@xmath0 emission from the x - ray shadow region suggests that variations are caused by factors other than changes in x - ray photoionization .",
    "since the emission strength is very sensitive to gas density ( @xmath75 ) , we conclude that the main source of the h@xmath0 emission variations is the fluctuation in basal wind density rather than ionization state .",
    "if the h@xmath0 variations primarily reflect changes in wind density close to the supergiant , then it is possible that the x - ray flux is partially modulated by the changing absorption in the stellar wind ( particularly important for soft x - rays ) .",
    "we doubt that wind absorption plays a major role in explaining the general anti - correlation between h@xmath0 and x - ray emission because the scatter in their temporal variations ( fig .",
    "13 ) is much larger than we would expect for a direct cause - and - effect relationship .",
    "furthermore , the amplitude of the wind density fluctuations implied by the h@xmath0 changes is too small to explain the range in x - ray variability .",
    "@xcite show that the x - ray light curve can be explained by the changing column density of the line of sight to the black hole as we peer through different portions of the supergiant s wind ( strongest absorption at supergiant inferior conjunction , @xmath76 ) .",
    "their asm 1.5  3 kev orbital light curve for the low / hard state shows a 25% decrease at @xmath76 relative to @xmath74 . @xcite",
    "also studied the variation in column density with orbital phase , and they suggest that the orbital modulation in x - ray flux corresponds to a fluctuation of @xmath77 in column density ( depending on the assumed ionization of the wind ) .",
    "however , the observed variations in the emission strength generally indicate column density changes of a factor of @xmath78 ( see below ) .",
    "wind column density changes of this order are too small to account for the large changes in x - ray flux .",
    "thus , wind absorption variations are insufficient to explain the general anti - correlation between the h@xmath0 emission strength and x - ray flux .",
    "nevertheless , we might expect the wind absorption processes to appear most prominent near inferior conjunction of the supergiant when the x - ray light curve attains a minimum and a peak occurs in the frequency of rapid x - ray dips @xcite .",
    "it is noteworthy in this regard that the case of the simultaneous h@xmath0 maximum and x - ray flux minimum shown in figure  12 did indeed occur near this phase ( at @xmath79 ) .",
    "if we ignore the effects of x - ray ionization on the h@xmath0 emissivity , then we can make an approximate estimate of how the wind mass loss rate and density vary as a function of the h@xmath0 emission strength @xcite .",
    "@xcite show predictions of how the h@xmath0 profile will vary as a function of mass loss rate ( see their fig .  4 ) ,",
    "and we measured the equivalent widths of their profiles to calibrate the mass loss rate as a function of h@xmath0 equivalent width ( prorated to their final estimate of mass loss rate for the time of their observations , @xmath80",
    "@xmath81  y@xmath20 ) .",
    "the functional fit in this case is @xmath82 we grouped our equivalent width data according to the x - ray state at the time of observation ( setting aside the results obtained near hjd 2,451,896 that may correspond to a `` failed transition '' ) , and the mean equivalent width for each group yields mass loss rates of @xmath83 and @xmath84 @xmath81  y@xmath20 for the low / hard and high / soft states , respectively ( the quoted errors are based on the standard deviation of the mean and do not include the larger errors associated with the calibration of the @xmath85 relationship and with our neglect of the multiple component nature of the h@xmath0 emission ) .",
    "this suggests that the mass loss rate is @xmath86 lower during the rare high / soft state compared to the more common low / hard state .",
    "since this calculation ignores the x - ray photoionization that may be more important in the high / soft state and since photoionization will decrease h@xmath0 emission strength , our estimate for the mass loss rate during the high / soft state is best regarded as a lower limit .",
    "nevertheless , the general decrease in wind strength during the high / soft state is also observed in the emission from the x - ray shadow region ( fig .",
    "15 ) that should be relatively free from the effects of photoionization .",
    "we find that the mean residual emission intensity of the red peak near phase @xmath45 is @xmath87 and @xmath88 for the low / hard and high / soft states , respectively .",
    "@xcite also found that the wind mass loss rate is lower in the high / soft state based upon their analysis of the x - ray orbital light curve .",
    "taken at face value , our results present a paradox : the x - ray flux decreases when the wind mass loss rate increases .",
    "we suggest that the resolution of this quandary lies in how the wind velocity changes with wind ionization state ( originally proposed by @xcite and developed in more physical terms by @xcite ) . when the wind mass loss rate is high , the wind density is also proportionally high , and therefore the x - ray ionization effects on the wind are confined to the region close to the black hole since the size of the surrounding ionized region depends on wind density as @xmath89 @xcite .",
    "most of the wind volume surrounding the star will contain the many important ions that propel the radiative driving of the wind , so that it reaches a terminal velocity of approximately 2100 km  s@xmath20 @xcite .",
    "however , the wind flow close to the black hole will become ionized , and these advanced ionization states will generally have transitions at frequencies much higher than the peak of the stellar flux distribution .",
    "consequently there are fewer absorbing transitions at frequencies where the stellar flux is concentrated and radiative driving of the wind becomes less effective .",
    "stellar wind gas leaving the part of the supergiant facing the x - ray source will be accelerated by radiative driving , reaching a significant fraction of the terminal velocity before crossing the distant ionization boundary @xcite .",
    "models of wind accretion by the black hole suggest that the mass accretion rate is proportional to @xmath90 @xcite , and since the flow velocity @xmath91 is relatively large , only modest mass accretion occurs .",
    "it is easy to imagine that some of the outflow from the supergiant to the black hole bypasses the black hole altogether , and absorption by the gas beyond the black hole could explain the presence of a secondary minimum in the low / hard state x - ray light curve at orbital phase @xmath74 @xcite .",
    "however , when the mass loss rate drops , the x - ray ionization zone will become larger because of the reduced wind density .",
    "the dominant ions that provide the resonant transitions that in turn drive the stellar wind will disappear with increased ionization , and the wind outflow will experience only a modest acceleration and reach a speed of just a few hundred km  s@xmath20 ( before the flow dynamics become dominated by the gravitational acceleration of the black hole ) .",
    "this altered outflow will be denser and slower in the vicinity of the black hole , and since the accretion rate varies as @xmath90 , the overall accretion rate will increase significantly because of the slower outflow ( and despite a real decline in @xmath92 ) .",
    "if this basic scenario is correct , then transitions from the low / hard to the high / soft state are triggered when the supergiant undergoes an episode of reduced mass loss .",
    "@xcite demonstrates that the decrease in the wind force multiplier occurs rather suddenly once a specific gas density is reached , and we would argue that this is the reason why the transitions are relatively fast and the x - ray states are bimodal .",
    "once the transition occurs , the system tends to remain in the high / soft state because the increased accretion rate and associated larger x - ray fluxes make it easier to keep the wind in the highly ionized state ( even with modest increases in mass loss rate ) .",
    "the line of sight to the black hole then passes through mainly ionized gas all around the orbit , and the wind absorption of the x - ray flux decreases so much that the x - ray light curve modulation vanishes @xcite .",
    "the increased mass accretion in this state causes the optically thick , geometrically thin ( keplerian ) accretion disk to extend further inwards towards the black hole , producing more soft x - rays , while the coronal ( adaf or sub - keplerian ) region , which produces the bulk of the hard x - rays , becomes smaller , and thus the x - ray spectrum softens @xcite .",
    "the enhanced soft x - ray flux heats the accreting gas , which reduces the h@xmath0 emission from the accretion flow ( fig .  9 , 16 ) .",
    "it is only once the supergiant can maintain a strong mass outflow that the wind becomes dense enough to reduce the ionization effects and to create the high speeds which then lower the mass accretion rate and force the system back to the low / hard state .",
    "the long term variations in the mass loss rates of massive supergiant stars are not well documented , but there is circumstantial evidence of significant variations on time scales of years @xcite .",
    "thus , we suggest that the high / soft states that occur every 5 years or so in cyg  x-1 correspond to quasi - cyclic minima in the mass loss rate of the supergiant .    we are grateful to dr .",
