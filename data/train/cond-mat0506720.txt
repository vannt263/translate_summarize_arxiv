    "ratchets are systems with an asymmetric periodic potential capable of promoting unidirectional transport of classical or quantum objects subject to an unbiased fluctuating drive . for that purpose",
    ", the external forcing must be a non - equilibrium one , like an alternating force or a colored noise , since useful work can not be extracted from equilibrium fluctuations only . the ratchet effect was first used to explain biochemical mechanisms such as the intracellular transport of macromolecules.@xcite since then , parallel to advances in the theoretical understanding,@xcite several devices have been proposed and fabricated in order to test the ratchet idea at the classical and quantum levels and to use the ratchet effect for particle segregation and motion rectification of electrons and fluxons.@xcite most of this work , however , is focused on ratchet systems consisting of single objects or an assembly of weakly interacting objects .",
    "much less is known about the collective rectification of strongly interacting systems via the ratchet effect and work on this subject carried out so far is mostly theoretical .",
    "vortices in superconductors with a periodic array of pinning centers have proven to be an ideal system in which to study collective dynamical phenomena of particles moving in a periodic potential .",
    "several interesting dynamical effects have already been studied in these systems .",
    "for instance , as demonstrated theoretically@xcite and experimentally@xcite , periodic pinning potentials are able to guide vortex motion into high symmetry directions of the pinning lattice .",
    "another remarkable dynamical effect in these systems is the presence of shapiro steps in the voltage - current characteristics when an rf current is coupled to the dc drive.@xcite the steps appear due to phase - locking between the rf signal and the vortex motion over the periodic pining structure .",
    "controllable motion of vortices by means of the ratchet effect was recently demonstrated in experiments performed on superconducting samples with periodic arrays of asymmetric pinning centers@xcite and for asymmetric configurations of symmetrical pinning sites.@xcite these structures are able to break the symmetry of the vortex pinning potential and promote vortex motion rectification when an unbiased ac current is applied . in ref .",
    ", for instance , the vortex ratchet effect was demonstrated in a nb film where the asymmetrical pinning potential was given by an array of triangular magnetic dots . in ref .  , we observed pronounced rectification effects in al films where the symmetry of the pinning potential was broken by engineering a composite configuration of antidot lattices with big and small antidots placed close to each other .    despite a great deal of theoretical efforts@xcite aimed at the description of the ratchet dynamics of vortices in asymmetrical pinning potentials , these systems are far from being completely understood .",
    "the vortex motion itself , in the presence of strong pinning sites , is still a subject of intense study . differently from many other systems ,",
    "vortices are soft objects ; their core is able to deform to better adjust to the available pinning potential . due to this property , the usual approximation of treating vortices as localized overdamped particles may break down and the resulting vortex ratchet effect can be quite different from , for instance , the effects known for overdamped brownian ratchets . indeed , as we have recently shown , the dynamics ruling the voltage rectification in a superconducting film with an array of asymmetrical antidots can be described by underdamped equations of motion.@xcite this means that this system can be regarded as an example of _ inertia ratchet _ systems , even though the true mass of a vortex is negligible .    in the present paper",
    ", we investigate in details vortex motion rectification in al films with nanoengineered antidot arrays as a function of ac excitation , magnetic field and temperature .",
    "two systems are investigated : ( a ) square arrays of _ asymmetrical _ antidots excited by a symmetrical ac current , an intrinsic ratchet system , and ( b ) a square array of _ symmetrical _ antidots excited by an ac current coupled to a dc bias , i.e. a tilted - potential ratchet . for fields below the first matching field , @xmath1 ( where @xmath2 is",
    "the flux quantum and @xmath3 is the antidot lattice constant ) , the vortex response in both systems is characterized by hysteresis , which suggests underdamped motion , and a double rectification peak at some incommensurate fields .",
    "these results are interpreted in terms of a minimal inertia ratchet model and molecular dynamics simulations of `` inertial '' vortices .",
    "the simulation results indicate that the double peak observed at incommensurate fields can be explained in terms of plastic deformation of the vortex lattice . for fields higher than @xmath0",
    ", our data reveal that the motion of interstitial vortices is essentially overdamped , in contrast with the unusual underdamped dynamics of the vortices trapped by the antidots .",

    "[ fig : vdcaad ] , we show detailed plots of the @xmath23-@xmath22 characteristics of samples aad2 and aad1 , respectively . similarly to single - object ratchet systems , these curves are characterized by a rectification window , in which the rectified voltage increases monotonically , and by the presence of a tail , in which @xmath23 drops smoothly towards zero .",
    "the rectification window is defined by two critical forces , @xmath38 , which marks the onset of rectification , and @xmath39 , for which rectification is maximum .",
    "these forces also determine the effective asymmetry of the pinning potential , which we define here as @xmath40 . for some field values ( usually , for fields close to @xmath0 or @xmath41 ) a second rectification peak",
    "is observed , suggesting an interplay between two ratchets ( c.f .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] ) , each having their own critical forces [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : vdcaad](c ) ]",
    ". however , a clear second peak was not identified in the measurements on sample aad2 , which is probably due to a lack of resolution in our measurements in the narrow rectification window of this sample .",
    "for fields higher than @xmath0 , a reversal in the net vortex motion is observed at lower amplitudes [ see the @xmath42 curve at @xmath43 in fig .",
    "[ fig : vdcaad](b ) ] . in ref .  , a similar voltage reversal was observed at fields above @xmath44 , which was the saturation field of the sample studied .",
    "the authors interpreted this result by arguing that the vortices trapped by the triangular magnetic dots arrange themselves in such a way that the interstitial vortices experience an effective asymmetric potential with opposite asymmetry . in our experiment ,",
    "the saturation field was @xmath0 .",
    "this can be inferred from the strong drop of the critical current just above this field , which indicates that weakly pinned interstitial vortices come into play .",
    "then , in fact , the voltage reversal observed at fields higher than @xmath0 can also be interpreted as a reversal in the rectification of interstitial vortices . however ,",
    "in our case , the reverse asymmetry is not induced by an asymmetric arrangement of vortices inside the pins , but rather by the current distribution ( encircling the asymmetric antidot configuration ) created by a single - quantum vortex trapped in the double - antidot pins .    by comparing the results obtained on samples aad1 and aad2",
    ", one can notice the striking difference in the rectified voltage of both samples .",
    "for the similar reduced temperatures , the maximum dc voltage of aad2 was several times smaller than that of aad1 .",
    "this can be explained by the fact that the coherence length of aad2 at temperatures close to @xmath12 may be bigger than the antidots ( for instance @xmath45 nm ) . in this situation ,",
    "the vortices are not able to resolve the details of the antidots and the effective asymmetry is strongly suppressed .",
    "this is very clear by calculating the asymmetry ratio of both samples at a relatively low temperature @xmath46 ( where thermal escape can be neglected ) and reduced field @xmath47 , which gives @xmath48 for aad1 and @xmath49 for aad2 .",
    "the coherence length , can also play an important role in the temperature dependence of the rectified voltage .",

    "ratchets , a decrease in the dc response as the temperature increases is indeed expected.@xcite the reason is that , when the brownian motion of particles is enhanced by thermal noise , more energy is needed to move them in a given direction .",
    "however , in the vortex case near the critical temperature , increasing temperature induces not only vortex fluctuations but also a strong increase of the vortex size , which leads to a decrease in the effectiveness of the pinning potential and its asymmetry . at low temperatures , the reduction of fluctuations and vortex size should lead to a monotonic increase in rectification . nevertheless , when vortices are small enough and their fluctuations are weak , they are more sensitive to the background pinning caused by the natural inhomogeneities of the sample .",
    "due to the disorder induced by the background pinning , the antidot pinning potential may become less effective at lower temperatures , thus causing a reduction of the rectified voltage .    in fig .",

    "at each half - period of the ac drive , the corresponding half - period of the voltage output in all cases ( a - d ) is asymmetric ; vortices seem to be depinned at a given force and repinned at a lower force value , giving rise to hysteretic behavior .",
    "such a hysteresis was also observed in sample aad2 , but somewhat smoothed due to the strong effects of fluctuations in this sample . as we shall see below",
    ", this indicates that the system is ruled by underdamped dynamics .",
    "since the symmetrical antidot configuration of sample sad does not produce rectified vortex motion by itself , we externally induce an asymmetry in the system by `` tilting '' the pinning potential with a small dc current bias . in fig .",

    "[ fig : vdcaad ] ) , the important difference is that the rectification tail approaches asymptotically a finite voltage value , which depends on the applied dc tilt , whereas the rectification tail of the intrinsically asymmetric samples reaches zero voltage at high ac drives . in the rectification window , however , samples sad and aad1 behave in a similar way .",
    "for instance , at fields close to @xmath0 , the second rectification peak is also seen in the @xmath23-@xmath22 curves of sample sad .",
    "[ fig : vdcsad](c ) presents the rectification effect in sample sad for different dc bias , @xmath69 22 , 46 , and 130 @xmath6a at @xmath70 and @xmath71 . at this field ,",
    "a double rectification peak is observed for all dc biases .",
    "the distance between peaks seems to be constant , whereas the rectification window is wider for higher tilt values .",
    "the window is roughly defined by the critical values @xmath72 and @xmath73 , where @xmath74 @xmath6a is the critical depinning current obtained from conventional dc transport measurements .",

    "for the tilt @xmath76 @xmath6a , this gives @xmath77 , which is similar to the intrinsic asymmetry observed in sample aad1 at @xmath54 .",
    "another noteworthy point is that the main rectification peak decreases relatively to the saturation voltage for higher tilts .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that , in the limit of the critical tilt ( @xmath78 ) , no rectification peak should be observed because there the energy barrier for the easy flow direction disappears completely . in this limiting case , @xmath42 is expected to grow monotonically from zero to the saturation voltage .    the time evolution of the voltage output for different drive amplitudes of the @xmath23-@xmath22 characteristics shown in fig .",

    "the main difference is that in the high drive limit [ panel ( f ) ] , the amplitude of the positive half - cycle is higher than the amplitude of the negative one , due to the extrinsic nature of the asymmetry in sample sad , whereas for sample aad1 the amplitude of both half - cycles are approximately the same .    for fields higher than @xmath0 [ fig .",
    "[ fig : outputv ] ( g ) and ( h ) ] , there exists an amplitude range for which the voltage half - cycles are symmetrical , that is , no hysteresis is observed . since this behavior is only present at low ac amplitudes , we can assume that the symmetrical waveforms correspond to motion of interstitial vortices . at @xmath24 = 1.5 ,",
    "the response is strongly enhanced in the positive half - cycle above an amplitude @xmath81 @xmath6a , suggesting that at this value the vortices trapped by the antidots start moving .",
    "the voltage waveform corresponding to this amplitude and above are asymmetrical [ panel ( h ) ] , resembling the waveforms observed at fields below @xmath0 . a similar evolution of the voltage waveforms as the ac amplitude is varied",

    "our experimental data clearly demonstrate a pronounced hysteresis in the voltage as a transport current is cycled .",
    "typical systems exhibiting pronounced hysteresis in their transport properties are driven underdamped particles in periodic potentials . in these systems ,",
    "the hysteresis in the depinning - repinning process is a consequence of the finite inertial mass of the particles , which has important effects on their transport properties .",
    "for instance , in microscopic boundary lubrication problems , the depinning of the ( inertial ) lubricant particles from the periodic potential of a solid substrate is usually identified as the static friction force whereas the repinning of the particles is identified as the dynamical friction force.@xcite other `` inertia '' ratchet systems are asymmetrical underdamped josephson junction arrays@xcite and dc squids@xcite . in these two examples , the rectified object is the phase of the superconducting order parameter across a junction and the inertia is given by the shunt capacitance of the junctions .",

    "the rectification of inertial particles in a ratchet potential has been studied theoretically by several groups .",

    "the amplitude dependent dc response presents a strong enhancement in the rectification window and a faster decaying tail , as compared to the characteristics of overdamped particles .",
    "inspired by the fact that , in our experiment , ( i ) the rectified voltage demonstrates hysteretic behavior and ( ii ) the @xmath23-@xmath22 characteristic generally has pronounced rectification effect in the rectification window , we propose a description of vortex dynamics in antidot systems in terms of a simplified underdamped model , in which vortices ( still treated as particles ) are given an apparent mass to account for the observed hysteresis .",

    "vortex dynamics is usually treated in terms of overdamped particle models because it is a well established fact that in most samples the vortex mass is negligible compared to the damping coefficient.@xcite nevertheless , these models do not consider the effect of vortex deformation that can lead to an irreversibility in the depinning - repinning process and , consequently , to an apparent inertial effect . in recent ginzburg - landau simulations of a superconductor with an antidot lattice",
    ", it was shown that the process of depinning of a vortex from an antidot can be characterized by strong current - induced elongation of the vortex core cross - section , which results in a hysteresis in the pinning mechanism.@xcite this effect seems to mimic the behavior of an underdamped particle in a periodic potential and can be responsible for the hysteresis observed in our experiments .      in our experiment ,",
    "the @xmath23-@xmath22 curves for some fields below @xmath0 are characterized by a double rectification peak . as we pointed out in our previous publication , the second rectification peak can be explained in terms of plastic deformation of the vortex lattice.@xcite in other words , the existence of a plastic dynamical phase with a lower critical current gives rise to the appearance of a second ratchet system , which competes with the main ratchet , given by the motion of the whole vortex lattice .",
    "the consequences of the existence of two ratchets with different critical forces can be heuristically illustrated by our one particle underdamped model .",
    "let us consider two independent inertia ratchets .",
    "the first one represents the whole vortex lattice , with critical forces @xmath159 and @xmath160 . the second ratchet represents the fraction @xmath161 of the vortices that deform plastically and has critical forces @xmath162 and @xmath163 . in this way , the total dynamics is simply given by the solution @xmath164 of the first ratchet for @xmath165 and @xmath166 , and , otherwise , by the solution @xmath167 of the second ratchet , normalized by the factor @xmath161 .",

    "[ fig : inertiafit ] ( a ) ] .    to get a better insight on how such plastic dynamics can lead to a double peak in the @xmath23-@xmath22 characteristic , we performed md simulations of `` inertial '' vortices for fields @xmath168 .",

    "the simulations reproduce quite well the double rectification peak observed experimentally .",
    "panels ( e ) and ( f ) show the time dependence of the center - of - mass ( c.m . ) velocity of the vortex lattice at vortex densities @xmath170 and 0.92 , respectively . as in our experiments , here the waveforms of vortex motion during each half - period are asymmetrical , i.e. , present hysteretical behavior , which is a result of the finite apparent mass of the vortices . in particular , the simulated waveforms at @xmath171 [ panel ( f ) ] evolve similarly to the experimental data of sample aad1 presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : outputv ] ( a)-(d ) . in both , experiment and simulations , four different ratchet phases ( i - iv )",
    "are clearly identified [ these phases are defined by vertical dashed lines in the @xmath23-@xmath22 characteristic of fig .",
    "[ fig : inertiafit ] ( a ) and in the @xmath169-@xmath104 characteristics of fig .",
    "[ fig : md ] ( b ) and ( c ) ] . in phase",
    "i , only a fraction of vortices move in the easy direction of the pinning potential .",
    "no motion to the hard direction is observed . in phase ii , the whole vortex lattice is half - wave rectified , i.e. , all vortices move to the easy direction and no vortices move to the hard one . in phase iii , we have motion of all vortices in the easy direction and motion of a fraction of them to the hard direction .",
    "the averaged rectified voltage drops abruptly at the onset of motion to the hard direction but increases again at slightly higher amplitudes , since the main ratchet ( the whole vortex lattice ) is still in its rectification window , giving rise to the second rectification peak . finally , in the phase iv , all vortices move back and forth , but in an asymmetric fashion , resulting in the long tail observed in the experiments and simulations .    to illustrate the interplay between the plastic dynamics and motion of the whole vortex lattice , we plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : md ] ( g)(i ) the vortex trajectories for the simulation at @xmath172 and a few drive amplitudes . at @xmath173 ( g ) , all vortices are still pinned ( just oscillating inside the pinning centers ) .",
    "note that , since the number of vortices does not match the number of pinning sites , there is a distribution of vacant pins , that is to say , of discommensurations in the vortex lattice . in this case , and also for @xmath64 0.92 , there are some vortex rows , with a denser distribution of discommensurations , which depin more easily .",
    "thus , at @xmath174 ( h ) , only the weakly pinned vortex rows are dragged away , giving rise to a one - dimensional channelling dynamics characterized by a strong shear of the vortex lattice . finally , at a higher drive , @xmath175 ( i ) , the potential barriers for the strongly pinned vortex rows are also overcome and all vortices move to the easy direction of the pinning potential . at lower fields , such as @xmath176 shown in panel ( d ) of this figure , the distribution of vacancies is approximately homogeneous in such a way that all vortex rows has approximately the same depinning force .",
    "thus , no channelling dynamics is observed and the @xmath177-@xmath104 characteristic at this field presents a single rectification peak .      at fields higher than @xmath0 , the interpretation of vortex motion in terms of underdamped dynamics may break down because of the presence of interstitial vortices . since they do not interact directly with the antidots , their dynamics",
    "is expected to be similar to that of vortices in a plain film , that is , essentially overdamped .",
    "this was indeed suggested by the amplitude dependence of the voltage waveforms @xmath80 [ see fig .  [",
    "fig : outputv ] ( g ) and ( h ) ] : whereas for high amplitudes the signal in a half - cycle is asymmetric , at lower amplitudes , the signal may be perfectly symmetric , that is , completely reversible . since apparently hysteresis only come out when the vortices trapped in the antidots are set into motion",
    ", one may then conclude that the apparent inertia comes from the interaction between vortices and antidots rather than from the real vortex mass .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied the vortex ratchet effect in superconducting films with nanoengineered arrays of asymmetric and symmetric antidots . in the asymmetric antidot sample , we observed rectification of an unbiased ac current due to the intrinsic asymmetry of the system , thus demonstrating that this is an intrinsic vortex ratchet system . in the symmetric antidot sample ,",
    "the rectification effect was due to the dc tilt of the periodic ( symmetric ) potential induced by the applied dc bias .",
    "the vortex rectification is strongly dependent on temperature and magnetic field .",
    "the temperature dependence indicates that the coherence length plays an important role in determining the effective asymmetry produced by the asymmetric antidot array ; when the vortex size becomes comparable to the big antidot size , the rectification is strongly suppressed .",
    "the field dependence of the rectification effects found in our experiments provides the following observations indicating collective behavior in the ratchet dynamics : ( i ) rectification is enhanced near the first matching field , evidencing the importance of vortex - vortex interactions in the ratchet effect ( at the first matching field , the vortex - vortex interactions cancel out by symmetry ) ; ( ii ) at fields above @xmath0 , we observed a sign reversal in the ratchet effect at low amplitudes , which indicates that weakly pinned interstitial vortices are rectified to the opposite direction due to the inverse asymmetry produced by the current distribution of the vortices trapped in the antidots ; and ( iii ) at some fields below @xmath0 , a double rectification peak was observed , which can be explained by the competition between rectification of ( weakly pinned ) incommensurate vortex rows and the rectification of the whole vortex lattice .",
    "in addition , our data revealed that the ratchet effect for fields lower than @xmath0 is dominated by underdamped dynamics .",
    "these results were corroborated by molecular dynamics simulations of an underdamped vortex ratchet model .",
    "we argued that the inertial effect actually comes from vortex deformation due to the strong interaction with antidots , rather than from a finite vortex mass .",
    "indeed , at fields higher than @xmath0 , we observe that the dynamics of interstitial vortices is essentially overdamped , since these vortices are not pinned directly by the antidots .",
