    "low to intermediate mass stars , including our sun , evolve to red giant and subsequently to asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars .",
    "an agb star is in the final stage of stellar evolution that is driven by nuclear fusion .",
    "mass loss becomes increasingly important during the agb evolution , both for the stellar evolution , and for the return of material to the interstellar medium .",
    "depending on whether or not carbon has been dredged up from the core into the atmosphere , agb stars appear to have an oxygen - rich or a carbon - rich chemistry .",
    "a canonical model of the mass - loss process has been developed for the case of the carbon - rich chemistry , where atmospheric carbon dust has a sufficiently large opacity to be radiatively accelerated and driven out of the gravitational potential of the star and where it drags along the gas ( e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* wachter et al . 2002 ) , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* mattsson et al . 2010 ) ) .",
    "for the case of an oxygen - rich chemistry , the details of this process are not understood , and are currently a matter of debate ( e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* woitke 2006 ) , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hfner 2008 ) ) .",
    "questions remain also for the carbon - rich case , such as regarding the recent observational evidence that the oxygen - bearing molecule h@xmath0o is ubiquitous in c - stars ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* neufeld et al . 2011 ) ) .",
    "another unsolved problem in stellar physics is the mechanism by which ( almost ) spherically symmetric stars on the agb evolve to form axisymmetric planetary nebulae ( pne ) .",
    "currently , a consensus seems to form that single stars can not trivially evolve towards non - spherical pne , by mechanisms such as magnetic fields or rotation , but that a binary companion is required in the majority of the observed pn morphologies ( e.g. ( * ? ? ? * de marco 2009 ) ) .    in order to solve these open questions ,",
    "it is important to observationally establish the detailed stratification and geometry of the extended atmosphere and the dust formation region , and to compare it to and constrain the different modeling attempts .",
    "this includes the following questions : how is the mass - loss process connected to the stellar pulsation ? which is the detailed radial structure of the atmosphere and circumstellar envelope ? at which layer",
    "do inhomogeneities form ? which are the shaping mechanisms ? which is the effect of inhomogeneities on the further stellar evolution ?",
    "radio and infrared interferometry are both well suited to probe the structure , morphology , and kinematics of the extended atmospheres and circumstellar environment of evolved stars , because of their ability to spatially resolve these regions .",
    "in fact , evolved stars have been prime targets for radio and infrared interferometry for decades , because they match well the sensitivity and angular scale of available facilities .",
    "interferometric observations continue to provide new observational results in the field of evolved stars thanks to newly available spectro - interferometry at infrared wavelengths , new radio interferometric facilities , larger samples of well studied targets , and comparisons to newly available theoretical models . here ,",
    "radio and infrared interferometry provide complementary information . from the perspective of infrared studies , radio interferometry of sio , oh , and h@xmath0o maser emission adds information on the morphology and kinematics at different scales from a few stellar radii ( sio maser ) to a few hundred stellar radii ( oh maser ) . from the perspective of radio interferometry",
    ", infrared interferometry provides information on the environment of the astrophysical masers , including the radiation field , the radii at wavelengths of maser pumping , and constraints on the stratification of the temperature , density , and number densities .",
    "we have established a project of coordinated interferometric observations of evolved stars at infrared and radio wavelengths .",
    "our goal is to constrain the radial structure and kinematics of the stellar atmosphere and the circumstellar environment to understand better the mass - loss process and its connection to stellar pulsation",
    ". we also aim at tracing asymmetric structures from small to large distances in order to constrain shaping processes during the agb evolution .",
    "we use two of the highest resolution interferometers in the world , the very large telescope interferometer ( vlti ) and the very long baseline array ( vlba ) to study agb stars and their circumstellar envelopes from near - infrared to radio wavelengths .",
    "for some sources , we have coordinated near - infrared broad - band photometry obtained at the south african astronomical observatory ( saao ) in order to derive effective temperatures .",
    "we have started to use the atacama pathfinder experiment ( apex ) to investigate the line strengths and variability of high frequency sio maser emission in preparation of interferometric observation of sio emitting regions using the alma facility .",
