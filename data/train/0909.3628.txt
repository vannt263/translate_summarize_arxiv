    "we are mainly concerned with the stability of difference schemes for hyperbolic systems of conservation laws with source terms .",
    "such systems are used to describe many physical problems of great practical importance in magneto - hydrodynamics , kinetic theory of rarefied gases , linear and nonlinear waves , viscoelasticity , multi - phase flows and phase transitions , shallow waters , etc .",
    "( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "we will consider a system of hyperbolic conservation laws written as follows ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) @xmath0 where @xmath1 , @xmath2 is a vector - valued function from @xmath3 @xmath4 @xmath5 into an open subset @xmath6 , @xmath7 @xmath8 @xmath9 @xmath10 is a smooth function ( flux - function ) from @xmath11 into @xmath12 , @xmath13 denotes the source term , @xmath14 denotes the stiffness parameter , @xmath15  is of compact support",
    ". we will assume that @xmath16 without loss of generality .",
    "in what follows @xmath17 denotes the matrix norm of a matrix @xmath18 induced by the vector norm @xmath19 @xmath20 , and @xmath21 denotes the matrix norm induced by a prescribed vector norm .",
    "@xmath22 denotes the field of real numbers .    for studying stability and monotonicity of non - linear schemes , the well known notion of total variation diminishing ( tvd ,",
    "see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) turns out to be an useful tool . actually , the following property    @xmath23    is sufficient for stability of a two - step method @xcite , however it is , in general , difficult to obtain . here",
    "@xmath24 denotes the time increment , @xmath25 is a constant independent of @xmath24 as @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are any two grid functions ( @xmath28 will often be referred to as the variation of the grid function @xmath27 ) , @xmath29 denotes the scheme operator . at the same time , the stability of linearized version of the non - linear scheme is generally not sufficient to prove convergence @xcite , @xcite .",
    "instead , the tv - stability adopted in @xcite ( see also ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* s. 8.3.5 ) ) makes it possible to prove convergence ( to say , tv - convergence ) of non - linear scalar schemes with ease .",
    "however , the tvd property is a purely scalar notion that can not , in general , be extended for non - linear systems of equations , as the true solution itself is usually not tvd @xcite , @xcite .",
    "moreover , one can see in @xcite that a tvd scheme can be non - convergent in , at least , @xmath30 , in spite that the scheme is tv - stable .",
    "such a phenomenon is , in all likelihood , caused by the fact that tv is not a norm , but a semi - norm .",
    "nowadays , there exists a few methods for stability analysis of some classes of nonlinear difference schemes approximating systems of pdes ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it is noted in @xcite that the problem of stability analysis is still one of the most burning problems , because of the absence of its complete solution . in particular , as noted in @xcite in this connection ,",
    "the vast majority of difference schemes , currently in use , have still not been analyzed .",
    "leveque @xcite noted as well that , in general , no numerical method for non - linear systems of equations has been proven to be stable . there is not even a proof that the first - order godunov method converges on general systems of non - linear conservation laws @xcite .",
    "thus , a different approach to testing scheme stability must be adopted to prove convergence of non - linear schemes for systems of pdes .",
    "the notion of scheme in variations ( or variational scheme @xcite , @xcite ) has , in all likelihood , much potential to be an effective tool for studying stability of nonlinear schemes .",
    "such an approach goes back to the one suggested by lyapunov ( 1892 ) , namely , to investigate stability by the first approximation .",
    "this idea has long been exploited for investigation of the stability of motion @xcite .",
    "an approach to investigate non - linear difference schemes for monotonicity in terms of corresponding variational schemes was suggested in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the advantage of such an approach is that the variational scheme will always be linear and , hence , enables the investigation of the monotonicity for nonlinear operators using linear patterns .",
    "it is proven for the case of explicit schemes that the monotonicity of a variational scheme will guarantee that its original scheme will also be monotone @xcite .",
    "we establish the notion that the stability of a scheme in variations is necessary and sufficient for the stability of its original scheme ( see section [ stability of difference schemes ] , theorem [ iffstab ] ) .",
    "an extensive literature is devoted to central schemes , since these schemes are attractive for various reasons : no riemann solvers , characteristic decompositions , complicated flux splittings , etc .",
    ", must be involved in construction of a central scheme ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and references therein ) , and hence such schemes can be implemented as a black - box solvers for general systems of conservation laws @xcite .",
    "let us , however , note that the numerical domain of dependence @xcite for a central scheme approximating , e.g. , a scalar transport equation coincides with the numerical domain of dependence for a standard explicit scheme approximating diffusion equations @xcite .",
    "such a property is inherent to central schemes in contrast to , e.g. , the first - order upwind schemes @xcite .",
    "hence , central schemes do not satisfy the long known principle ( e.g. , @xcite ) that derivatives must be correctly treated using type - dependent differences , and hence there is a risk for every central scheme to exhibit spurious solutions .",
    "the results of simulations in @xcite can be seen as an illustration of the last assertion .",
    "notice , all versions of the , so called , nessyahu - tadmor ( nt ) central scheme , in spite of sufficiently small cfl ( courant - friedrichs - lewy @xcite ) number ( @xmath31 ) , exhibit spurious oscillations in contrast to the second - order upwind scheme ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "the first order , @xmath33 , lxf scheme exhibits the excessive numerical viscosity .",
    "thus , the central scheme should be chosen with great care to reflect the true solution and to avoid significant but spurious peculiarities in numerical solutions .",
    "let us note that lxf scheme ",
    "the forerunner for central schemes @xcite , @xcite  does not produce spurious oscillations . while , from the pioneering works of nessyahu and tadmor @xcite and on , the higher order versions of lxf scheme can produce spurious oscillations .",
    "the reason has to do with a negative numerical viscosity introduced to obtain a higher order accurate scheme ( for more details , see section [ cosn ] ) .",
    "let us note that there is a possibility to increase the scheme s order of accuracy , up to @xmath34 , by introducing an additional non - negative numerical viscosity into the scheme .",
    "such an approach is similar to the vanishing viscosity method @xcite , @xcite , and hence possesses its advantages , yet it appears to be free of the disadvantages of this method , since the additional viscosity term is not artificial . with this approach ,",
    "the second order scheme is developed in section [ cosn ] , where sufficient conditions for stability of the scheme are found .",
    "the scheme is tested on several conservation laws in section [ exemplification and discussion ] .",
    "a stable numerical scheme may yield spurious results when applied to a stiff hyperbolic system with relaxation ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . specifically",
    ", spurious numerical solution phenomena may occur when underresolved numerical schemes ( i.e. , insufficient spatial and temporal resolution ) are used ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "however , during a computation , the stiffness parameter may be very small , and , hence , to resolve the small stiffness parameter , we need a huge number of time and spatial increments , making the computation impractical .",
    "hence , we are interested to solve the system , ( [ ina10 ] ) , with underresolved numerical schemes .",
    "it is significant that for relaxation systems a numerical scheme must possess a discrete analogy to the continuous asymptotic limit , because any scheme violating the correct asymptotic limit leads to spurious or poor solutions ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "most methods for solving such systems can be described as operator splitting ones , @xcite , or methods of fractional steps , @xcite .",
    "after operator splitting , one solves the advection homogeneous system , and then the ordinary differential equations associated with the source terms . as reported in @xcite , this approach is well suited for the stiff systems .",
    "we are mainly concerned with such an approach in section [ oss ] .",
    "let us consider the following non - linear explicit scheme arising , e.g. , in numerical analysis of nonlinear pde systems : @xmath35 where @xmath36 denotes a vector - valued grid function , @xmath37 , @xmath38 denotes a node of the grid @xmath39 , @xmath40 denotes a node ( time level ) of the grid @xmath41 , @xmath42@xmath43 @xmath44 @xmath9 @xmath45 is a vector - valued function with the domain and range belonging to @xmath46 and @xmath47 , respectively .",
    "notice , @xmath48 depends also on scheme parameters ( e.g. , space and time increments ) , however , this dependence is usually not included in the notation .",
    "we will assume that @xmath49  in ( [ nscs10 ] ) denotes the time level , @xmath50 @xmath51 .",
    "thus , the time increment will be represented by @xmath52 , where @xmath53  denotes some finite time over which we wish to compute . if we introduce the additional notation @xmath54 then the scheme ( [ nscs10 ] )",
