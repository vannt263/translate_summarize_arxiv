    "by fitting a gaussian to the ccf profile we obtain three free parameters : position of the minimum ( which is directly related to the radial velocity ) , dispersion @xmath4 ( related to the surface velocity field ) and the cross correlation area ( related to the stellar metallicity ) .",
    "if we measure @xmath4 for stars for which accurate @xmath0 were determined by fourier analysis or from rotational periods , we may build a calibration of the ccf technique to determine accurate @xmath0 .",
    "the observational material and reduction are described in niedzielski & wolszczan ( this volume ) .",
    "we obtained the ccf by cross correlating the high s / n blue spectra with a numerical mask defined as a sum of delta - functions centered on the rest wavelengths of selected lines ( since the mask is a mathematical function it does not add noise to the data ) .",
    "after computing the ccfs for every order , they are adjusted to a common reference frame and co - added to get the final normalized ccf for which the @xmath6 is measured . the dispersion ( @xmath4 ) is related to @xmath6 as : @xmath7 .",
    "@xcite have shown that the width of the ccf ( @xmath4 ) is related to the @xmath0 by a function of a form of : @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is a constant coupling the differential broadening of the ccfs to the @xmath0 of a star , and @xmath5 is the width of the ccf of an non - rotating star of the same spectral type and luminosity and is related to the measured width of the ccf ( @xmath4 ) by the following formula : @xmath10",
    ". the measured width of the ccf of a star ( @xmath4 ) results from several broadening mechanisms : gravity , effective temperature , magnetic field , metallicity , and of course the rotation .",
    "@xmath11 is the rotational broadening and @xmath12 is responsible for all other broadening mechanisms ( including the instrumental profile ) except rotation .",
    "@xmath5 is a critical parameter .",
    "it is a function of the color of a star and we may obtain its dependence on @xmath13 by using slowly - rotating calibrator stars . to determine the @xmath5 vs. @xmath13 relation we used 16 slow rotators with accurate projected rotational velocities measured in various papers , preferably from by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . for every of these stars we determined @xmath5 using formula from @xcite and assuming the constant @xmath14 following the @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we carried out a least - squared fit to the data by the analytical function @xmath15 which yields the following calibration : @xmath16 .",
