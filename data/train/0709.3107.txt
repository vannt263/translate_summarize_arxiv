    "one of the many intriguing discoveries in the kuiper belt is that a substantial fraction of its largest members are binaries .",
    "48 such systems are currently known ( for a comprehensive review see @xcite ) .",
    "broadly speaking , we can identify two classes of kuiper belt binaries ( kbbs ) .",
    "the first class consists of small satellites around the largest kuiper belt objects ( kbos ) and the second of roughly equal - mass binaries with wide separations .",
    "the existence of the first class of binaries is most likely explained by the standard formation scenario involving a collision and tidal evolution , as has been proposed for the formation of the moon and the pluto - charon system @xcite .",
    "this formation scenario fails however for the second class of kbbs , since it can not account for their wide separations .",
    "this has motivated a variety of new theories for the formation of comparable mass kbbs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite proposed a new formation mechanism for kbbs consisting of a collision between two bodies inside the hill sphere of a third .",
    "however , in the kuiper belt , gravitational scattering between the two intruders is about 100 times and assumed that the velocity dispersion of the kbos at the time of binary formation is less than their hill velocity , see  2 for details ] more common than a collision .",
    "binary formation by three body gravitational deflection ( @xmath1 mechanism ) , as proposed by @xcite , should therefore dominate over such a collisional formation scenario .",
    "@xcite proposed a second binary formation scenario : it consists of the formation of a transient binary , which becomes bound with the aid of dynamical friction from the sea of small bodies .",
    "this is called the @xmath0 mechanism . @xcite and @xcite suggest that transient binaries that spend a long time in their mutual hill sphere , near a periodic orbit , form the binaries in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 mechanism .",
    "we address and investigate the relative importance of these long - lived transient binaries for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 formation mechanism and find that they are most likely not significant for the overall binary formation in the kuiper belt .",
    "finally , @xcite proposed a binary formation mechanism which involves a collision between two large kbos which creates a small moon .",
    "an exchange reaction replaces the moon with a massive body with high eccentricity and large semi - major axis .    in this paper",
    ", we accurately calculate the @xmath0 and @xmath1 formation rates for sub - hill kbo velocities and discuss how these rates are modified for super - hill velocities .",
    "this allows us to determine for which physical parameters and velocity regime each mechanism dominates the binary formation .",
    "further , we calculate the frequency of long - lived transient binaries and assess their importance for the overall kbb formation .",
    "our paper is structured as follows : in  2 we outline our assumptions , explain our choice of parameters and define variables that will be used throughout this paper .",
    "we calculate the @xmath1 and @xmath0 formation rates for sub - hill kbo velocities in  3 and  4 respectively .",
    "we compare the @xmath0 and @xmath1 formation rates in the sub - hill velocity regime in  5 . in  6 we discuss how these formation rates are modified for super - hill kbo velocities .",
    "the frequency of long - lived transient binaries and their significance for the overall kbb formation is calculated in  7 .",
    "summary and conclusions follow in  8 .",
    "the hill radius denotes the distance from a kbo at which the tidal forces due to the sun and the gravitational force due to the kbo , both acting on a test particle , are in equilibrium .",
    "it is given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the semi - major axis and @xmath12 the mass of the kbo .",
    "@xmath13 is the mass of the sun .",
    "we use the ` two - group approximation ' @xcite which consists of the identification of two groups of objects , small ones , that contain most of the total mass with surface mass density @xmath14 , and large ones , that contain only a small fraction of the total mass with surface mass density @xmath15 .",
    "we assume @xmath16 which is the extrapolation of the minimum - mass solar nebular to a heliocentric distance of @xmath17 .",
    "estimates from current kuiper belt surveys @xcite yield @xmath18 for kbos with radii of @xmath19 .",
    "we use this value of @xmath20 , assuming that @xmath20 during the formation of kbbs was the same as it is now .",
    "our choice for @xmath20 and @xmath14 is also consistent with results from numerical coagulation simulations by @xcite .",
    "large bodies grow by the accretion of small bodies .",
    "large kbos viscously stir the small bodies , increasing the small bodies velocity dispersion @xmath21 . as a result @xmath21 grows on the same timescale as @xmath22",
    "provided that mutual collisions among the small bodies are not yet important . in this case",
    ", @xmath21 is given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 at @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "@xmath25 is the hill velocity of the large bodies which is given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the orbital frequency around the sun .",
    "the velocity @xmath28 of large kbos increases due to mutual viscous stirring , but is damped by dynamical friction from the sea of small bodies such that @xmath29 .",
    "balancing the stirring and damping rates of @xmath28 and substituting for @xmath21 from equation [ e16 ] , we find @xmath30 for our choice of parameters , we have that @xmath31 during the epoch of formation of bodies with @xmath32 .",
    "additionally , we argue that @xmath28 could not have exceeded @xmath33 significantly during satellite formation in the kuiper belt : if @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the escape velocity from the large bodies , then the timescale for mutual collisions is @xmath36 equation [ e22 ] shows that the collision timescale among the largest kbos ( @xmath37 ) would have been excessively long if @xmath38 during satellite formation .",
    "the ubiquity of small satellites around kbos , that have radii as large as @xmath39 , @xcite and the pluto - charon system @xcite suggests that @xmath31 during their formation , since their origin is best explained by a giant impact ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this is supported further by the recent discovery of a collisional family belonging to @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "we therefore focus our work on the shear - dominated velocity regime ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "however , we discuss how our results would be modified if @xmath42 .",
    "a transient binary forms when two large kbos penetrate each other s hill sphere .",
    "this transient binary must lose energy in order to become gravitationally bound . in the @xmath1 mechanism",
    "the excess energy is carried away by an encounter with a third massive body .",
    "we calculate the binary formation rate via the @xmath1 mechanism in the shear - dominated velocity regime .",
    "since the growth of inclinations is suppressed in the shear - dominated velocity regime the disk of kbos is effectively two - dimensional @xcite .",
    "we therefore restrict this calculation to two dimensions . as initial condition",
    ", we assume that all bodies are on circular orbits .",
    "we chose to work in the rotating frame with the @xmath43-axis pointing radially outwards and the @xmath44-axis in the prograde direction .",
    "for a gravitational deflection of three equal - mass bodies , the @xmath1 formation rate per body is @xmath45 @xmath46 is the surface number density of the kbos . @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the relative initial separations in the @xmath43-direction between bodies 1 and 2 and bodies 1 and 3 respectively .",
    "@xmath49 is the offset in the @xmath44-direction body 3 would have when bodies 1 and 2 would encounter each other had their relative velocity been solely due to the kepler shear of the disk : @xmath50 .",
    "finally , @xmath51 is a function that takes on the value 1 if the encounter resulted in the formation of a binary between any two of the three kbos involved and 0 otherwise .",
    "the choice of limits on the integrals in equation [ e19 ] ensures no double counting of the binaries .",
    "expression ( [ e19 ] ) can be written as @xmath52 where @xmath53 expression ( [ e20 ] ) agrees with the order of magnitude estimate of @xcite if we set @xmath54 .",
    "it is the value of the constant @xmath55 we determine here .",
    "since we are interested in close encounters among the kbos , their interaction is well described by hill s equations @xcite that we modify to include three equal mass bodies besides the sun .",
    "the equations of motion , with length scaled by @xmath56 and time by @xmath57 , for body 1 are given by @xmath58 @xmath59 the subscripts 1 , 2 and 3 label the @xmath43- and @xmath44-coordinates of kbo 1 , 2 , and 3 respectively .",
    "similar equations of motion can be obtained for bodies 2 and 3 .",
    "@xmath51 is calculated by numerically integrating the equations of motion .",
    "a binary formation event is detected in the following way : the equations of motion of the three bodies are integrated until a time that corresponds to a separation of at least @xmath60 between all three bodies ( after their conjunction ) , assuming that their relative velocity is solely due to their keplerian sheer ( i.e. ignoring the actual gravitational interaction between the bodies ) , plus an additional time of @xmath61 .",
    "if after this time the separation between two bodies is still less than @xmath62 a binary is considered to have formed .",
    "we chose a separation of @xmath63 instead of @xmath64 to allow for binary orbits that reach slightly outside @xmath64 .",
    "numerical integrations are terminated early if the separation between kbos becomes less than @xmath65 and these events are not counted towards the binaries formed .",
    "this serves two purposes : first of all , @xmath65 roughly corresponds to the separation at which physical collisions occur in the kuiper belt .",
    "secondly , by introducing a minimum separation , we prevent divergence in the equations of motion .",
    "this cut - off limits , strictly speaking , the validity of the value of @xmath66 calculated here to binary formation at heliocentric distances of @xmath67 since the separation in units of @xmath64 , corresponding to collisions among the kbos , is inversely proportional to the heliocentric distance . in order to determine",
    "@xmath55 we need to cover the three dimensional parameter space spanned by @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "we chose a spacing of @xmath68 for all three parameters .",
    "@xmath69 is chosen as the upper limit for @xmath47 and @xmath48 , the upper limit for @xmath70 is @xmath71 .",
    "the given limits and resolution require numerical integrations of @xmath72 orbits .",
    "we obtain @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the estimated poisson error .",
    "we repeated the calculation for @xmath55 with randomly chosen grid points for @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 and the same number of numerical integrations and confirmed that the value of @xmath55 is insensitive to the grid points chosen .",
    "@xmath55 tends to @xmath75 in the limit that the bodies are treated as point masses ( i.e. the limit that the cut - off tends to zero ) .",
    "we will use @xmath76 since it corresponds to the physically relevant situation in the kuiper belt .",
    "this yields a binary formation rate of @xmath77 which is smaller by @xmath78 than the order of magnitude estimate of @xcite .",
    "so far , we have only considered binary formation due to an encounter with a third body that carries away the excess energy .",
    "however , binary formation might also occur due to dynamical friction generated by the sea of small bodies ( @xmath0 mechanism ) .",
    "the random velocity of large kbos is damped due to gravitational interactions with many small bodies .",
    "since it is not feasible to examine the interactions with each small body individually , their net effect is modeled by an averaged force which acts to damp the large kbos non - circular velocity .",
    "we parameterize the strength of the damping by a dimensionless quantity @xmath7 defined as the fractional decrease in non - circular velocity due to dynamical friction over a time @xmath57 : @xmath79 the first expression is simply an estimate of dynamical friction by the sea of small bodies assuming @xmath80 .",
    "the second expression describes the mutual excitation among the large kbos for @xmath81 .",
    "these two expressions can be equated since the stirring among the large kbos is balanced by the damping due to dynamical friction .",
    "in fact , if @xmath28 is defined as the product of the median eccentricity and the orbital velocity , we can calculate the exact relationship between @xmath7 and @xmath82 since the velocity distribution in the shear - dominated velocity regime has been fully determined ( see @xcite ) . defining @xmath28 as the product of the median eccentricity and the orbital velocity , we obtain @xmath83 for @xmath84 and our estimates for @xmath82 , @xmath20 and @xmath22 from  2 we find @xmath85 .",
    "we calculate the binary formation rate for equal mass bodies via the @xmath0 mechanism in shear - dominated velocity regime . as in  3",
    ", we restrict this calculation to two dimensions with circular motion as initial conditions for the large kbos and use the same coordinate system as in  3 .",
    "the binary formation rate per body via the @xmath0 mechanism can be written as @xmath86 where @xmath46 is the surface number density of the kbos and @xmath87 is the relative initial separation in the @xmath43-direction between the two kbos .",
    "@xmath88 is a function that takes on the value 1 if the encounter resulted in the formation of a binary for a given @xmath7 and @xmath87 and 0 otherwise .",
    "equation [ e199 ] can be written as @xmath89 where @xmath90 @xcite showed , using numerical integrations , that @xmath91 is indeed proportional to @xmath7 . here",
    "we want to determine the actual value of @xmath92 . in hill",
    "coordinates the equations of motion of the two kbos can be decomposed into their center of mass motion and their relative motion with respect to one another .",
    "the relative motion of two equal mass kbos , including the dynamical friction term , is governed by @xmath93 @xmath94 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 correspond to the relative separation between the two kbos in the @xmath43 and @xmath44 direction respectively .",
    "again , length has been scaled by @xmath56 and time by @xmath57 .",
    "equations [ e10 ] and [ e11 ] are integrated for different values of @xmath7 and impact parameters ranging from @xmath95 to @xmath96 .",
    "impact parameters outside this range result in a distance of closest approach between the two kbos of more than @xmath64 .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows that the rate of binary formation is proportional to @xmath7 .",
    "the value of @xmath92 , estimated from the line of best fit , is 1.4 .",
    "this yields a binary formation rate of @xmath97 using equation [ e41 ] we can retrieve the scalings of @xcite . although , we know the exact @xmath0 formation rate for a given @xmath7 and have an exact expression for @xmath7 in terms of @xmath28 ( see equation [ e51 ] ) , the relation between @xmath28 and the actual physical parameters , i.e. the numerical coefficient in equation [ e17 ] , which is needed for a precise value of @xmath7 is uncertain to a factor of order unity .",
    "contrary to claims by @xcite and @xcite , the @xmath0 mechanism does predict a mass - ratio selection .",
    "this can be seen from the first part of equation [ e41 ] . for a given @xmath21 , we have that @xmath98 since @xmath99 .",
    "large kbos experience stronger dynamical friction ( larger @xmath7 ) than smaller ones .",
    "this is not at all surprising and is a general feature of dynamical friction @xcite .",
    "we can write @xmath100 where @xmath101 .",
    "@xmath102 is a constant independent of the kbo mass for a given @xmath14 and @xmath21 . for two kbos with masses @xmath103 and @xmath104 , the position of body 1 essentially coincides with the center of mass of the two bodies provided that @xmath105 . in the limit that the kbos random velocity tends to zero and",
    "that @xmath106 we can place body 1 at the origin of the hill coordinate system and treat the center of mass as stationary throughout the interaction . in this limit",
    "we find that the relative motion of the two kbos is governed by @xmath107 @xmath108 where length is scaled by @xmath64 of kbo 1 and time is scaled by @xmath57 . for extreme mass - ratio binaries the relevant strength of the dynamical friction that enters equations",
    "[ e777 ] and [ e778 ] is twice that acting on the small body ( i.e. @xmath109 ) , and significantly less than that acting on the large body ( i.e. @xmath110 ) .",
    "the @xmath0 mechanism therfore favors the formation of comparable mass binaries from the largest available bodies over high mass - ratio ones .",
    "it is an open question , whether this preference for comparable mass binaries remains after the kuiper belt mass spectrum during their formation and their survival probability are accounted for .",
    "we are now able to compare the binary formation rates for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 mechanism for sub - hill velocities .",
    "the ratio of the @xmath1 to @xmath0 formation rates is @xmath111 where we substituted for @xmath7 using the exact relationship from equation [ e51 ] .",
    "it is remarkable that this expression depends explicity only on @xmath112 and is independent of what sets @xmath7 .",
    "it is therefore independent of the velocity dispersion of the small bodies , their surface density or the importance of collisions among the small bodies .",
    "we therefore conclude that for @xmath113 , binaries in the kuiper belt formed primarily due to dynamical friction rather than three body encounters .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the @xmath0 and @xmath1 formation rates as a function of @xmath7 . for our estimate of @xmath114",
    ", we have that @xmath115 .",
    "obviously there is some uncertainty in what the actual values of @xmath14 and @xmath20 were during binary formation . for a few times larger value of @xmath116 with @xmath117",
    "unchanged , we enter the regime in which @xmath42 ( this can be seen from equation [ e16 ] ) . although it is rather unlikely that @xmath6 during binary formation ( see  2 ) we discuss here briefly how this would affect the @xmath0 and @xmath1 formation rates .    for @xmath42 the velocity dispersion of the large bodies",
    "is still set by the balance between their mutual stirring and the damping due to dynamical friction generated by the sea of small bodies .",
    "therefore , dynamical friction shrinks the orbit of a kbb with a mutual orbital velocity @xmath118 at a rate @xmath119 where we assume that @xmath120 . for @xmath121 ,",
    "binaries are broken up by passing kbos at a rate @xmath122 the ratio of these two rates yields @xmath123 since the ratio in equation [ e600 ] is @xmath124 for @xmath125 , we conclude that kbbs with separations @xmath126",
    "( i.e. kbbs with @xmath127 ) tend to be broken up by passing kbos .",
    "binaries with separations of @xmath128 or less , tend to survive .",
    "the cross section for the @xmath1 mechanism is therefore reduced with respect to the sub - hill case .",
    "the probability of having a kbo within @xmath129 of a given kbo is @xmath130 where @xmath131 is the volume number density of kbos .",
    "the flux of kbos into area @xmath132 is @xmath133 .",
    "the super - hill formation rate for tight binaries with separations @xmath134 , via the @xmath1 mechanism , is therefore @xmath135 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "in addition to tight binaries with separations of @xmath129 and less , there exist a second class of binaries with larger separations .",
    "binaries with separations @xmath136 are constantly created and destroyed via the @xmath1 mechanism .",
    "kbbs can form from two kbos that approach each other with relative velocity @xmath121 while a third kbo removes energy , through gravitational scattering , enabling the kbos to get bound .",
    "since we are selecting bodies with relative velocities @xmath137 or less , the number of kbos that can form binaries with separation @xmath138 is reduced by @xmath139 .",
    "the formation rate for binaries with separation @xmath140 is @xmath141 these wider binaries ( @xmath136 ) have a higher formation rate compared to the tight ones which have a separation @xmath134 .",
    "the ratio of the formation rate ( equation [ e169 ] ) to the destruction rate ( equation [ e101 ] ) yields an equilibrium abundance of binaries per kbo at any given time that is given by @xmath142 the number of binaries scales as @xmath143 .",
    "binaries with separation @xmath144 are therefore @xmath145 times more common than those with separation @xmath129 provided there is sufficient time for the equilibrium to be established . the same statistical equilibrium abundance can be derived using phase space arguments .",
    "the phase space number density of kbos is @xmath146 .",
    "the phase space volume corresponding to a binary separation @xmath144 and velocity @xmath118 is @xmath147 . multiplying the kbo phase space number density by the binary phase space volume yields a statistical equilibrium abundance per kbo of @xmath148 which is in agreement with the binary abundance derived in ( [ e170 ] ) .",
    "whether any of these binaries would survive the dynamical excitation of the kuiper belt remains an open question .",
    "the @xmath0 mechanism fails in creating binaries with separations @xmath149 since dynamical friction is not able to dissipate sufficient energy for tight binaries to form .",
    "dynamical friction is only able to assist in the formation of binaries with wide separations ( @xmath150 ) that form from kbos that happen to approach each other with low relative velocities ( @xmath151 ) .",
    "this reduces the number density of kbos that can participate in binary formation by a factor of @xmath152 . in this case , the @xmath0 formation rate is given by @xmath153 where we have substituted for @xmath7 from equation [ e42 ] in the last step .",
    "these wide binaries face the same fate as the wide ones formed via the @xmath1 mechanism in that they will be broken up quickly due to scattering of other large bodies .",
    "however , the @xmath0 mechanism does not even contribute significantly to the binary equilibrium abundance calculated in equation [ e170 ] since @xmath154 .",
    "therfore , the @xmath0 mechanism does not play an important role in kbb formation if super - hill velocities prevail .    in summary ,",
    "the @xmath1 mechanism forms tight binaries , that tend to be saved from break up , at a rate that is reduced by a factor of @xmath155 compared to the sub - hill case .",
    "in addition , the @xmath1 mechanism forms wider binaries @xmath156 , at a higher rate that is only reduced by a factor of @xmath157 relative to the sub - hill rate .",
    "these wide binaries are constantly created and destroyed leading to an equilibrium abundance of binaries that scales as @xmath143 .",
    "the @xmath0 mechanism is not important if kbos have super - hill velocities .",
    "@xcite propose that transient binaries , that spent a time of @xmath158 ( @xmath159 at @xmath17 ) or longer in their mutual hill sphere , near a periodic orbit , are responsible for binary formation in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 mechanism . here , we determine how the frequency of long - lived transient binaries depends on the transient binary lifetime .",
    "this allows us to quantify the importance of long - lived transient binaries for the overall binary formation .",
    "finally , we address the significance of long - lived transient binaries for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 formation mechanism .",
    "first , we assess how common long lived transient binaries are .",
    "we integrate equations [ e10 ] and [ e11 ] without the dynamical friction term and determine the time @xmath160 over which the separation between the two kbos is less than @xmath161 for all kbos that approach one another to @xmath64 and less .",
    "we chose to calculate the time the two kbos spent with a separation of less than @xmath162 to allow for orbits that reach slightly outside of @xmath56 but return back to within @xmath56 during the encounter .",
    "we integrate @xmath163 orbits in total with impact parameters ranging from @xmath164 to @xmath165 .",
    "impact parameters outside this range result in a distance of closest approach between the two kbos of more than @xmath64 .",
    "as initial conditions , we assume that the orbits of the bodies are circular .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows that the frequency of transient binaries decreases exponentially with the transient binary lifetime , @xmath166 .",
    "the line of best fit yields a differential transient binary frequency , valid for @xmath167 , of @xmath168 the frequency of transient binaries that spend a time of @xmath169 with a separation of less than @xmath62 is 3 orders of magnitude smaller than that of short - lived ones with @xmath170 .",
    "the analysis discussed here was carried out assuming that the kbos approach each other with relative velocities @xmath171 .",
    "long - lived transient binaries do not exist for bodies that encounter each other at @xmath172 .",
    "this can be understood by looking at the jacobi constant .",
    "the jacobi constant in hill coordinates with length scaled by @xmath64 and time by @xmath57 is given by @xmath173 kbos that approach each other with @xmath174 at @xmath64 will experience at most one encounter before they separate .",
    "evaluation of their jacobi constant at @xmath64 yields that it is large and negative . in order to experience multiple encounters",
    ", kbos must approach each other with @xmath175 at @xmath64 which corresponds to @xmath176 of order unity .",
    "since the jacobi constant is a conserved quantity , we can be sure that no long - lived transient binaries exist for kbos that encounter each other at @xmath174 .",
    "long - lived transient binaries therefore offer no solution to the fine tuning problem , contrary to claims by @xcite .",
    "for kbos with a given velocity distribution there always exist a few bodies that have @xmath177 even if @xmath178 .",
    "such bodies can give rise to long - lived transient binaries in the same way that they can form wide binaries ( see  6 for details ) , but the frequency of transient binaries due to such bodies is reduced by a factor of @xmath179 .      @xcite claim that the probability of binary formation from transient binaries with @xmath180 is extremely small and they therefore include only transient - binaries with @xmath181 in the main set of their integrations . however , their conclusion , that the probability of binary formation from transient binaries with @xmath182 is extremely small , is due to a bias in their initial conditions that discriminates against binary formation from transient binaries with @xmath183 .",
    "the shortcoming of their analysis is due to the fact that they launch the third body from an initial separation @xmath184 when the first two kbos come within a few @xmath64 of each other to compensate for the different definitions of @xmath64 ] .",
    "since @xcite select the initial conditions for the third body such that it penetrates within @xmath186 , the largest impact parameter is @xmath187 .",
    "the minimum time it takes for the third body to come within a few @xmath64 of the transient binary is therefore @xmath188 .",
    "the third body therefore only reaches the vicinity of the transient binary for @xmath189 , but it is exactly this proximity of the third body that is required for binary formation by strong gravitational scattering .",
    "this explains why @xcite find such a small probability for binary formation by transient binaries with @xmath190 .",
    "the range of impact parameters that lead to binary formation is comparable for short- and long - lived transient binaries .",
    "this means that the transient binary lifetime is the only advantage long - lived transient binaries have compared to short - lived ones , in terms of binary formation likelihood .",
    "however , as we show in  7.1 , the frequency of transient binaries drops exponentially as a function of their lifetime .",
    "the ratio of the binary formation rate due to short - lived transient binaries ( @xmath191 ) compared to that due to long - lived ones ( @xmath192 ) , is therefore @xmath193 although the binary formation rate scales linearly with transient - binary lifetime , the frequency of transient binaries drops exponentially as a function of its lifetime .",
    "therefore , long - lived transient binaries are not important for binary formation via the @xmath1 mechanism .      in general , kbos that spend a longer time in the hill sphere , lose more energy due to dynamical friction , and are therefore more likely to be captured",
    ". however , they might not be responsible for the majority of the binary formation , if the frequency for long - lived transient binaries is sufficiently small . to address this question we determine the typical time @xmath194 , required for a transient binary to become bound with the aid of dynamical friction .",
    "we define @xmath194 as the time it takes for 50% of all the kbos , that form a binary , to become bound for a given strength of dynamical friction @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath194 is measured from the point at which the relative separation between the two kbos is less than @xmath62 .",
    "we determine @xmath194 in the following way .",
    "first , we integrate the same equations as in  4 ( i.e. equations [ e10 ] and [ e11 ] ) .",
    "we switch off the dynamical friction at different times and continue the evolution of the kbos until @xmath195 .",
    "this process is repeated until we find the time for which dynamical friction has to act for 50% of all kbos , that form a binary , to become bound .",
    "a transient binary is considered to have become bound when it remains a binary ( i.e. relative separation @xmath196 ) until @xmath197 .",
    "we repeat this for different @xmath198 in order to reveal the relationship between @xmath194 and @xmath7 . again",
    ", impact parameters are chosen to range from @xmath199 to @xmath96 .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows that , for @xmath200 , the typical time for permanent capture does not depend linearly on the strength of the dynamical friction @xmath198 , but shows a weaker logarithmic dependence .",
    "@xmath201 only ranges from @xmath202 for @xmath203 to @xmath204 for @xmath205 .",
    "furthermore , figure [ fig3 ] shows a noticeable break around @xmath206 ; for @xmath207 , @xmath194 increase significantly to @xmath208 and more . from this",
    ", we conclude that longevity of the transient binary ( as discussed by @xcite with @xmath209 ) becomes only important for very weak dynamical friction ( i.e. @xmath210 ) and is most likely not crucial for kbb formation . in ",
    "4 we estimate @xmath211 , in which case longevity of transient binaries ( @xmath212 ) is unlikely to be a major requirement for binary formation .",
    "we accurately determine the @xmath4 and @xmath3 formation rates for @xmath81 .",
    "we find that while the @xmath0 formation rate is close to previous order of magnitude estimates , the @xmath1 formation rate is about a factor of 4 smaller . for @xmath113 ,",
    "the ratio of the @xmath3 to the @xmath4 formation rates is @xmath213 and is independent of what sets @xmath7 .",
    "it is therefore independent of the velocity dispersion of the small bodies , their surface density or the importance of collisions among the small bodies . for sub - hill kbo velocities , binaries in the kuiper belt",
    "formed primarily due to dynamical friction rather than three body encounters . for super - hill kbo velocities ( @xmath6 )",
    "the @xmath0 mechanism becomes unimportant .",
    "the @xmath1 mechanism forms tight binaries that tend to be saved from break up at a rate that is reduced by a factor of @xmath155 compared to the sub - hill case .",
    "in addition , the @xmath1 mechanism forms wider binaries @xmath156 , at a higher rate that is ` only ' reduced by a factor of @xmath157 relative to the sub - hill rate .",
    "these wide binaries are constantly created and destroyed leading to an equilibrium abundance of binaries that scales as @xmath143 .",
    "whether and how any of these wide binaries would survive the dynamical excitation of the kuiper belt remains an open question .",
    "in addition , we determine the frequency of long - lived transient binaries .",
    "we show that the frequency of long - lived transient binaries drops exponentially with the system s lifetime for @xmath177 .",
    "about 1000 transient binaries occur with @xmath214 for each transient - binary with @xmath215 .",
    "the long - lived transient binaries investigated by @xcite and @xcite are therefore very rare .",
    "long - lived transient binaries are not important for binary formation via the @xmath1 mechanism , since the binary formation rate scales only linearly with transient - binary lifetime , but the frequency of transient binaries drops exponentially as a function of its lifetime .",
    "long - lived transient binaries do not exist for @xmath174 .",
    "we show that the apparent shortage of binaries forming from short - lived transient binaries ( i.e. @xmath182 ) found by @xcite can be explained by a bias in their initial conditions that discriminates against binary formation from transient binaries with @xmath183 .",
    "finally , to assess the importance of long - lived transient binaries in the @xmath0 mechanism , we determine the typical time @xmath216 required for a transient binary to become bound with the aid of dynamical friction . we show that longevity of the transient binary ( as discussed by @xcite with @xmath217 ) only becomes important for very weak dynamical friction ( i.e. @xmath9 ) .",
