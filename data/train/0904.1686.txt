    "[ s : intro ]    symplectic toric manifolds form a nice family of examples in which to test various ideas ; they can be described by simple diagrams and many of their invariants can be explicitly calculated . in this paper",
    "we discuss some geometric problems that arise when studying their natural family of lagrangian submanifolds . before describing our results",
    ", we shall illustrate the main definitions by some examples .",
    "a symplectic toric manifold is a @xmath0-dimensional symplectic manifold with an action of the @xmath1-torus @xmath2 that is hamiltonian , i.e. the action of the @xmath3th component circle is induced by a function @xmath4 .",
    "these functions @xmath5 fit together to give the moment map @xmath6 whose image is called the _ moment",
    "polytope_. the first examples are :    @xmath7 @xmath8 with its standard area form ( normalized to have area @xmath9 ) and with the @xmath10 action that rotates about the north - south axis ; the corresponding hamiltonian is the height function , and its moment polytope is the @xmath11-simplex @xmath12 $ ] ; see fig .",

    "then the moment map is @xmath17 with image the first quadrant @xmath18 in @xmath19 .",
    "note that the inverse image under @xmath20 of the line segment @xmath21 , where @xmath22 for @xmath23 , is the product @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is a disc of @xmath26-area @xmath27 in the first factor @xmath28 and the torus is a product of the circles @xmath29 in the other copies of @xmath28 .",

    "study form and @xmath31 action @xmath32\\mapsto [ z_0;{{\\lambda}}_1z_2;{{\\lambda}}_2z_2]$ ] .",
    "the moment map is @xmath33\\mapsto   \\bigl(\\frac{|z_1|^2}{\\sum_i|z_i|^2 } , \\frac{|z_2|^2}{\\sum_i|z_i|^2}\\bigr),\\ ] ] with image the standard triangle @xmath34 in @xmath35 .",
    "more moment polytopes are illustrated in figures [ fig : probe0 ] and [ fig:7 ] below .",
    "good references are audin @xcite and karshon  kessler  pinsonnault @xcite .",
    "notice that the moment map simply quotients out by the @xmath2 action .",
    "one important fact here is that the moment polytope @xmath36 is a convex polytope @xmath37 , satisfying certain integrality conditions at each vertex .",
    "( we give a precise statement in theorem [ thm : delz ] below . )",
    "another is that the symplectic form on @xmath38 is determined by the polytope @xmath37 ; indeed every point in @xmath39 has a darboux chart that is equivariantly symplectomorphic to a set of the form @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is a neighborhood of some point in the first quadrant @xmath18 .",
    "thus locally the action looks like that of @xmath2 in @xmath42 . in particular the ( regular ) orbits of @xmath2",
    "are lagrangian .",
    "are in involution ; the poisson brackets @xmath43 vanish because @xmath2 is abelian . ]",
    "hence the inverse image of each interior point @xmath44 is a smooth lagrangian manifold @xmath45 , that is @xmath46 .",
    "this note addresses the question of which of these toric fibers @xmath45 are _",
    "displaceable by a hamiltonian isotopy , _",
    "i.e. are such that there is a family of functions @xmath47,$ ] whose associated flow @xmath48,$ ] has the property that @xmath49",
    ".    this question was first considered ( from different points of view ) in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "biran , entov and polterovich showed in @xcite that if the quantum homology @xmath50 ( taken with appropriate coefficients ) has a field summand then at least one of the fibers @xmath45 is nondisplaceable .",
    "in later work ( cf .",
    "* theorem  2.1 ) ) , entov  polterovich managed to dispense with the condition on quantum homology .",
    "even more recently , they showed in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  1.9 ) by a dynamical argument that if in addition @xmath39 is _ monotone _ , i.e. @xmath51 $ ] is a positive multiple of the first chern class @xmath52 , then the fiber over the so - called _ special point _",
    "@xmath53 of @xmath37 is nondisplaceable .",
    "is normalized so that @xmath51=c_1(m)$ ] , then the smooth moment polytope @xmath37 is dual to an integral fano polytope @xmath54 and @xmath53 is its unique interior integral point which is usually placed at @xmath55 .",
    "we call such polytopes @xmath37 _ monotone _ ; cf . definition [ def : mono ] .",
    "] however , for general polytopes their argument gives no information about which fibers might be nondisplaceable .",
    "cho @xcite , and later fukaya , oh , ohta and ono @xcite , took a more constructive approach to this problem .",
    "the upshot of this work is that for any toric manifold , one can define floer homology groups @xmath56 ( depending on various deformation parameters @xmath57 ) that vanish whenever @xmath45 is displaceable .",
    "moreover , in @xcite , the authors construct a point @xmath58 for which this floer homology does not vanish for suitable @xmath57 , at least in the case when @xmath51 $ ] is a rational cohomology class .",
    "they show in ( * ? ? ?",
    "1.5 ) that even in the nonrational case the corresponding fiber @xmath59 can not be displaced .",
    "they also show in the monotone case that @xmath58 coincides with the special point @xmath53 and that @xmath60 for all other @xmath61 ; cf .",
    "* thm .  7.11 ) .",
    "one of the main motivating questions for the current study was raised by entov and polterovich , who ask in @xcite whether the special fiber @xmath62 is _ stem _ , that is , whether all _ other _ fibers are displaceable .",
    "the results stated above show that from the floer theory point of view this holds .    in this paper",
    "we develop a geometric way to displace toric fibers using probes .",
    "our method is based on the geometry of the moment polytope @xmath37 and makes sense for general rational polytopes . using it ,",
    "we show :    [ thm:3 ] if @xmath39 is a monotone toric symplectic manifold of ( real ) dimension @xmath63 then the special fiber @xmath62 is a stem .",
    "this is an immediate consequence of proposition [ prop:3 ] .    in our approach , this question of which toric fibers can be displaced is closely related to the well known ewald conjecture in @xcite about the structure of monotone polytopes @xmath37 , namely that the set @xmath64 of symmetric integral points in @xmath37 contains an integral basis for @xmath19 .",
    "that is constructed from the fan .",
    "hence his formulation looks very different from ours , but is equivalent . ] by work of bro ( * ? ? ?",
    "4.1 ) , this is now known to hold in dimensions @xmath65 . however ,",
    "in general it is not even known if @xmath66 must be nonempty .    in definition [ def :",
    "stare ] we formulate a stronger , but still purely combinatorial , version of the ewald property ( called the _ star ewald _ property ) and prove the following result .",
    "[ thm : stemain ] a monotone polytope @xmath37 satisfies the star ewald condition if and only if every point in @xmath67 can be displaced by a probe .",
    "[ cor : ste ] if @xmath37 is a monotone polytope in @xmath19 for which all points except for @xmath68 are displaceable by probes , then @xmath66 spans @xmath19 .",
    "we show in proposition [ prop:3 ] that every @xmath69-dimensional monotone polytope satisfies the star ewald condition .",
    "the proof of this result is fairly geometric , and does not appear to generalize easily to higher dimensions .",
    "therefore , before attempting such a generalization , it would seem sensible to carry out a computer check of the star ewald condition using bro s methods .",
    "we then analyze the star ewald condition for monotone polytopes that are bundles .",
    "( definitions are given in ",
    "[ s : bun ] . ) by lemma [ le : bun ]",
    "the fiber and base of such a bundle must be monotone .",
    "although it seems likely that the total space is star ewald whenever the fiber and base are , we could only prove the following special case .",
    "[ prop : bun ] suppose that the monotone polytope @xmath37 is a bundle over the @xmath70-simplex @xmath71 , whose fiber @xmath72 satisfies the star ewald condition . then @xmath37 satisfies the star ewald condition .",
    "using this , we show that @xmath62 is a stem in various other cases , in particular for the @xmath73-dimensional monotone manifold found by ostrover ",
    "tyomkin @xcite that does not have semisimple quantum homology .    during the course of the proof we show that if the polytope @xmath74 is star ewald , then the total space of every bundle over @xmath74 with star ewald fiber is itself star ewald if and only if this is true for bundles with fiber the one - simplex @xmath75 ; see proposition [ prop : bun1 ] .",
    "finally , we discuss the notion of stable displaceability in  [ ss : stdis ] .",
    "this notion was introduced by entov ",
    "polterovich in @xcite as an attempt to generalize the notion of displaceability .",
    "however , we show in proposition [ prop : stdis ] that in many cases stably displaceable fibers are actually displaceable by probes .",
    "our arguments rely on the fukaya ",
    "ono notion of the _ central point _",
    "we explain this in  [ ss : v0 ] , and then in lemma [ le : v0 ] give a direct combinatorial proof of the following fact .",
    "[ prop : uf ] for every rational polytope the point @xmath76 is not displaceable by probes .    in some cases , it is easy to check that probes displace all points @xmath44 for which @xmath60 .",
    "for example , the results of fukaya  oh  ohta  ono concerning one point blow ups of @xmath30 and @xmath77 become very clear from this perspective : see example [ ex:2blow ] and figure [ fig : ober1 ] .",
    "however , by lemma [ le : inacc ] this is no longer true for general hirzebruch surfaces .",
    "further , the floer - theoretic nondisplaceable set @xmath78 has dimension at most @xmath79 , while we prove the following result in  [ ss:2 ] .",
    "[ prop : notdisp ] there are @xmath9-dimensional moment polytopes with a nonempty open set consisting of fibers that are not displaceable by probes .",
    "it is not at all clear whether these fibers really are nondisplaceable , or whether one just needs to find more elaborate ways of displacing them .    *",
    "varying the symplectic form *    in general , the set of nondisplaceable fibers varies as one varies the toric symplectic form . in terms of the moment polytope",
    "this amounts to changing the support constants @xmath80 of the facets @xmath81 without changing the normal vectors @xmath82 . for each @xmath37",
    "we denote by @xmath83 the polytope with support constants @xmath84 and normals equal to those of @xmath37 , and by @xmath85 the set of @xmath86 for which @xmath83 is analogous to @xmath37 , i.e. is such that a set of facets has nonempty intersection in @xmath83 if and only if it does in @xmath37 . let us say that @xmath83 is _ accessible _ if all its points except for @xmath58 are displaceable by probes .",
    "then we may ask :    * for which @xmath37 is there some @xmath87 such that @xmath83 is accessible ? * for which @xmath37 is @xmath83 accessible for all @xmath87 ?    if @xmath37 is a product of simplices , it is obvious that @xmath83 is always accessible .",
    "however in dimension @xmath9 some trapezoids ( the even ones ) are also accessible for all @xmath84 ; see corollary  [ cor : inacc ] .",
    "it is not clear what happens in higher dimensions .",
    "* acknowledgements .",

    "determine and are determined by the chern class of the corresponding @xmath838 bundle over @xmath689 .",
    "] more precisely , if the edge @xmath839 meets the facets @xmath840 and @xmath841 transversally , then then , because the length @xmath842 of the corresponding edges in @xmath843 must be at least @xmath11 , we must have @xmath844 thus , if @xmath74 has many short edges then it supports few monotone bundles .",
    "one easy case is when the @xmath845 are all @xmath846 .",
    "for then the points @xmath847 lie in @xmath66 so that @xmath37 is star ewald exactly if @xmath74 is .",
