    "in recent years , substantial progress has been made in the development of the `` lab on a chip '' concept , i.e. , the integration of many physical and chemical processes ( e.g. , transport through micro - channels , mixing of different fluids , chemical reactions ) into a single device ; entire laboratory setups , like a gas chromatograph , have been miniaturized on a single chip ( for a review see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in this context , microfluidics is becoming a standard tool in many applications , ranging from biology ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) to the handling of toxic or rare substances .",
    "further scaling down to nanofluidics is expected to take place in the future  @xcite .",
    "already now it is possible to sculpture channels with lateral dimensions of few tens of nanometers @xcite ( for a review on such fabrication processes see ref .",
    "@xcite ) and carbon nanotubes have been proposed as possible pipes in nanofluidics  @xcite .",
    "chemically patterned substrates have also been suggested as a solution for directed transport , gating , mixing , or separation of fluids at the micro- and nano - scale  @xcite . in this case",
    "the channel consists of a strip of wettable material embedded in a non - wettable substrate so that the fluid flows along the wettable region and is laterally confined by the chemical contrast .",
    "if one of the dimensions of a fluid film is comparable to the size of the fluid molecules , a hydrodynamical description of the film is no longer justified  @xcite . in this case",
    "the discrete nature of the fluid becomes important and the fluid can not be treated as a continuum in the confined direction . in order to investigate such systems",
    "one possible approach is to carry out computer simulation of discrete models , e.g. , molecular dynamics , kinetic monte carlo ( kmc ) , or lattice boltzmann simulations ; recent work in this direction includes fluids in carbon nanotubes @xcite and on chemically patterned substrates @xcite .    with the scaling down of microfluidic devices",
    "one has to deal with and may exploit the ultrathin precursor film which spreads ahead of the bulk fluid .",
    "experimental studies have shown that in some cases such precursor films have molecular thickness  @xcite .",
    "the spreading of such monolayers has been studied using a two - dimensional lattice gas ising model  @xcite in which a half - space is occupied by a particle reservoir .",
    "recent kmc simulations and a continuum analysis  @xcite of that model provided results in good qualitative agreement with available experimental data , and a further extension to the case of chemically patterned substrate has been proposed  @xcite .",
    "fluids in narrow channels have been investigated theoretically in the context of single - file diffusion , i.e. , when fluid particles can not overtake each other ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "such systems show the interesting feature of non - diffusive behavior of tracer particles , which stimulated experimental ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) and numerical  @xcite interest . here",
    "we present a lattice model for ultrathin films in which multiple occupancy of a site is allowed ( generalizing the single - occupancy model of refs .",
    "@xcite ) and in which the substrate - particle attractive interaction is decaying as a power law , whereas the particle - particle interaction is assumed to be hard - core repulsive only .",
    "this mimics the case in which the fluid - substrate interaction strongly dominates over the actual attractive long - range part of the fluid - fluid interaction .",
    "based on the phenomena occurring in this minimalistic model , the extension to the case in which the attractive part of the fluid - fluid interaction is relevant will be presented elsewhere .",
    "we shall restrict our analysis to a one - dimensional model , which can effectively describe fluids in extremely narrow channels with a width which is less than twice the particle diameter .",
    "the sidewalls act to confine the particles .",
    "the corrugation of the substrate potential both at the bottom and at the sides is incorporated effectively by considering a lattice model for the particles . due to the small thickness of the channel the transversal variation of the substrate potential",
    "can be ignored .",
    "this model is supposed to mimic not only molecular fluids but also colloidal particles in solution , with the colloidal particle setting the length scale .",
    "we discuss both the initial dynamics , in which a fluid film fed by a reservoir gradually fills the channel , and the steady state , in which the fluid film in the channel is in contact with two reservoirs at different chemical potentials .",

    "section  [ conc ] summarizes the main findings and provides our conclusions .",
    "before specifying the rules defining the model , we further describe the general physical picture of the type of systems we have in mind .",
    "as stated above , the fluid is assumed to be confined to a narrow , effectively one - dimensional channel .",
    "the sidewalls are very high compared with the fluid particle diameter , so that the fluid can not spill out of the channel .",
    "the channel walls act on the particles such that only the vertical variation of the substrate potential matters .",
    "the left and the right end of the channel are connected to a feeding and absorbing particle reservoir , respectively , and the channel is initially empty .",
    "the fluid film inside the channel is taken to be compact , i.e. , molecules are densely packed to form vertical columns without vacancies .",
    "this corresponds to the case in which the substrate is strongly attractive and vacancies inside columns are eliminated on a time scale much shorter than the typical time for exchanges of particles between columns .",
    "we describe these exchanges in terms of _ rates _ , which are related to the change of the energy of the system due to the corresponding move .",
    "particle exchanges between columns and particle insertions and removals near the reservoirs are the only processes we consider .",
    "we assume that neither evaporation nor condensation takes place inside the channel .",
