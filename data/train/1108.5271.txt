    "the progress in single molecule tracking techniques provides a route to study the dynamical aspects of individual particles , such as colloids , polymers , vesicles or even cells .",
    "specifically , insight is achieved in the influence of the environment on the particle behavior .",
    "this is of particular importance for dilute suspensions , where hydrodynamic effects determine the transport properties of the solute particles . here , the solvent characteristics , e.g. , compressibility , are of paramount importance .",
    "investigations of the dynamics of small objects suspended in a medium and driven by thermal fluctuations , i.e. undergoing brownian motion , have a long fruitful history  @xcite . in the classical picture of brownian motion ,",
    "the dynamics of a solute particle experiencing viscous drag and random collisions with the molecules of the solvent is described by the langevin equation , @xmath0 here @xmath1 is the particle mass , @xmath2 its coordinate , @xmath3 is the solvent s viscous friction coefficient and @xmath4 is a stochastic force which models collisions of the solute particle with the molecules of the solvent .",
    "the stochastic force is _ assumed _ to be stationary , markovian , and gaussian with zero mean ( white noise ) , i.e. @xmath5    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     at very short times , however , there is an apparent discrepancy between the simulations and the theory , as indicated in the insets of [ fig : rho10 ] and [ fig : rho5 ] . whereas simulations exhibit an exponential decay of the velocity autocorrelation function",
    ", the theory predicts a decay which is faster than exponential .",
    "this difference has a straightforward explanation . at very short times , the solvent in the simulations can not be treated as a continuous medium , and the navier - stokes equation can not be applied .",
    "instead , one has to assume random collisions between solvent particles and the colloid . here , the langevin equation applies , and the velocity autocorrelation function indeed decays exponentially , with the decay constant given by the ratio of the enskog friction @xmath6 and the colloid mass @xmath1  @xcite , with @xmath7 this behavior is , in principle , a consequence of the coarse - graining approach of mpc - the relatively small number of solvent particles and the discrete dynamics imply that few collisions occur in a single simulation step , and , consequently , a continuum description is not applicable .",
    "we remark that the enskog friction coefficient has a different physical origin than the stokes viscous friction coefficient , and that the two are not necessarily related .",
    "the theory , on the other hand , assumes that a hydrodynamic description is valid down to arbitrarily short times .",
    "the enskog regime is completely absent from the theoretical treatment .",
    "consequently , the theoretical curves differ only when compressibility is accounted for , and only at the sonic time scale ( see [ fig : rho10 ] , right ) .",
    "we further observe that for characteristic sonic times @xmath8 smaller than viscous times @xmath9 , the velocity autocorrelation functions decay monotonically and do not exhibit any peculiar properties .",
    "however , when @xmath8 becomes larger than @xmath9 , anticorrelations clearly develop in the velocity autocorrelation function , signaling backtracking .",
    "the monotonic decay of the vacf is superseded by crossing zero and an asymptotic approach of the hydrodynamic @xmath10 long - time tail .",
    "here , the simulation results are in good qualitative agreement with the predictions of the theory .",
    "we note that if , in the theoretical calculations , the effects of solvent compressibility are not taken into account , i.e. if the calculations are performed with an infinitely high velocity of sound , no anticorrelations develop ( dotted lines of [ fig : rho10 ] and [ fig : rho5 ] ) .",
    "therefore , these anticorrelations are indeed a direct consequence of the interference of sonic and viscous effects .",
    "velocity autocorrelation functions for solvent particles for @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( left ) and @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( right ) .",
    "the points correspond to positive values of the vacf and the solid lines correspond to negative values of the vacf.[fig : solvent_vacf ] ]    to study the influence of backtracking on long - time transport properties , we calculate the diffusion coefficient as the integral of the velocity autocorrelation function , i.e. , @xmath15 assuming the validity of the stokes - einstein relation , @xmath16 where @xmath17 , the product @xmath18 depends only on the properties of the colloid , namely its size , and does not depend on properties of the solvent , namely its shear viscosity , and serves as a good indicator of the relevance of sonic effects at long times .    as shown in [ fig : rho10_diffusion ] and [ fig : rho5_diffusion ] , we observe that in the presence and in the absence of backtracking , @xmath19 tends to the same value in the asymptotic limit .",
    "clearly , at the sonic time scale , there are significant deviations between the cases with and without backtracking . however , the long - time limit is always the same .",
    "as before , the simulation results are in good qualitative agreement with theory .",
    "we note that if the solvent compressibility is eliminated from the theoretical calculations , the long - time limit of @xmath19 remains the same ( dotted lines of [ fig : rho10_diffusion ] and [ fig : rho5_diffusion ] ) .",
    "hence , we have confirmed that even when the effects of sound are very pronounced and dramatically influence the short - time regime of the solvent particles motion , the net effect remains zero , i.e. the role of sound can be neglected when studying long - time observables .",
    "the main requirement to observe backtracking is that the sonic time scale should be equal to or slightly larger than the viscous time scale .",
    "this is clearly not the case in typical conditions of a micron - sized particle suspended in a liquid like water since , as we demonstrated above , in this case the sonic time scale is of the order of nanoseconds , whereas the viscous time scale is of the order of microseconds .",
    "however , the sonic time scale is proportional to the size of the particle , whereas the viscous time scale is proportional to the square of the size of the particle , and already for a particle a few nanometres in size , the sonic time scale and the viscous time scale have the same order of magnitude - namely , several picoseconds .",
    "clearly , the viscous time scale can further be reduced by employing a more viscous fluid , and conditions under which backtracking occurs can be reached experimentally .    to complete the analysis ,",
    "we study the velocity autocorrelation function of the solvent itself  @xcite . for small time steps , it is known to exhibit anticorrelations , and it may be tempting to assume that anticorrelations in the velocity of the solute are a direct consequence of anticorrelations in the velocities of the solvent particles",
    ". however , we find that anticorrelations within the solvent and anticorrelations of the colloidal particle do not necessarily arise together , as can be seen by comparing the data for @xmath20 in [ fig : rho10 ] and [ fig : solvent_vacf ] ( left ) .",
    "we have confirmed that interference of sound and viscous effects leads to a nonmonotonic decay of the velocity autocorrelation function of a single colloidal particle suspended in a viscous solvent .",
    "furthermore , we have verified that under certain conditions backtracking can occur , i.e. the velocity autocorrelation function becomes negative .",
    "this behavior is reminiscent of viscoelastic behavior - however , it has a very different , dynamical origin which lies in the interference of the formation of sound waves and hydrodynamic vorticity .",
    "finally , we have confirmed that despite the strong influence of backtracking on the velocity autocorrelation function , its long - time integral , the diffusion coefficient , is unaffected .",
    "that is to say that at long times the effects of sound are completely integrated out .",
    "an important consequence of this result is the confirmation that sonic effects at the single - particle level can be neglected at long observation times .",
