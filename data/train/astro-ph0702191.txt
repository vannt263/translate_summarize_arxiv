    "long - duration gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) provide a new and powerful means to detect distant galaxies and star formation . due to their extremely energetic ( @xmath11@xmath12 ) dust",
    "transparent gamma - ray emissions , grbs can be detected from cosmological distances .",
    "it is now widely believed that grbs accompany core - collapses of massive stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and many grbs have been found in star forming galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this implies that the grb formation rate ( gfr ) within a certain redshift bin is probably correlated with the star formation rate at that epoch @xcite .",
    "if so , grbs hold the potential to become extremely powerful tracers for distant star formation , extending the madau diagram @xcite up to @xmath13 @xcite . however , there is no guarantee that the gfr is correlated only to the global sfr .",
    "the evolution of metallicity @xcite or the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) in galaxies @xcite could indeed influence the gfr . of course , being able to track any of these parameters to cosmological distances will be very fruitful .",
    "studying the basic properties of the grb host galaxies is essential to precisely understand the type of evolution we are tracking by counting the grbs .",
    "grb host galaxies often appear to be blue , sub - luminous , and low - metal dwarf galaxies in the optical / uv band , with a moderate sfr of @xmath14 . on the other hand ,",
    "@xcite have reported that some grb host galaxies emit strongly in the submillimeter continuum , corresponding to sfrs higher by a few orders of magnitude compared to the sfrs measured in the optical / uv band , resembling active starforming galaxies enshrouded in heavy clouds of dust , commonly found at similar redshifts .",
    "however , these grb host galaxies were not detected by subsequent sensitive observations in the near / mid infrared window using the _ spitzer _ space telescope @xcite , which renders conversion between the observed submillimeter fluxes and sfr suspect .",
    "clearly , confirmatory measurements in these wavelengths as well as more observations based on other independent methods are necessary for understanding this discrepancy .",
    "measuring the co line luminosity ( @xmath3 ) of grb host galaxies can possibly resolve this discrepancy .",
    "the correlation between a galaxy s @xmath3  and its total molecular gas mass ( @xmath15 ) is well known .",
    "once the @xmath15  and subsequently the molecular gas surface density ( @xmath16 ) are known , its total sfr can be estimated using the global schmidt law @xcite .",
    "since millimeter waves penetrate through dust , the total sfr of a galaxy measured in this manner is influenced neither by its dustiness nor its dust temperature .",
    "however , to date , no co measurements of the @xmath15   of grb host galaxies have been performed .",
    "this is mainly because grbs are found at cosmological distances ( @xmath17 for grbs detected by _ swift _ ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and their co emission is too faint to be detected by the existing millimeter wave telescopes .    here , we present the results of an observation of the co ( @xmath0 = 10 ) molecular line emission in the host galaxy of grb 030329 using the nobeyama millimeter array ( nma ) .",
    "grb 030329 is one of the grbs that occurred closest to the earth ( @xmath18 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and was the third closest one to us at the time of observation .",
    "the optical image of the host galaxy appears to be a dwarf galaxy resembling the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) ( @xmath19 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with a moderate extinction - corrected sfr of @xmath110.5 @xmath20@xcite",
    ". however , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* k05 , hereafter ) found a possible feature of co ( @xmath0 = 10 ) emission in the millimeter wave spectrum during an afterglow observation using the nma , showing that the host galaxy possibly possesses an enormous amount of molecular gas ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "this amount is substantially more than what would be expected from the optical faintness of the host galaxy . for example , the total molecluar gas mass of the smc is only @xmath224 @xmath23 @xcite . if this line actually exists then it would imply that a large amount of star formation in this galaxy is obscured by heavy dust clouds .",
    "this would certainly support the relationship between the grbs and star formation .",
    "therefore , the host galaxy of grb 030329 was considered to be the best target to conduct the first ever deep co ( @xmath0 = 10 ) observation .",
    "assuming a cosmology with @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 , the luminosity distance of grb 030329 is @xmath27 , and the angular distance is @xmath28 ( @xmath29 corresponds to 2.85  kpc ) .",
    "we conducted a set of sensitive observations of the co ( @xmath0 = 10 ) emission in the host galaxy of grb 030329 using the nma .",
    "the observational log is presented in table [ table1 ] .",
    "the observation was performed in two periods that were separated by 4 months .",
    "the first period was from 2004 december 9 to 14 and the second one was from 2005 april 22 to 29 .",
    "the most compact configuration ( d array ; baseline lengths ranged from 13 m to 82 m ) was used for the observations .",
    "the tracking frequency was set at 98.824 ghz or 98.905 ghz to observe the redshifted co ( @xmath0 = 10 ) line ( @xmath1198.65 ghz ) at the upper side band ( usb ) .",
    "the center frequency was shifted to ensure that the detected line feature is actually due to molecular emission and not due to any unexpected correlator bandpass characteristics .",
    "the lower side band ( lsb ) was centered at 86.825 ghz and 86.905 ghz , respectively .",
    "each band was separated by a @xmath30 phase switching of the reference signal .",
    "the ultra - wide band correlator @xcite was configured to cover a bandwidth of 1024 mhz per side - band with a resolution of 8 mhz .",
    "the radio sources b1741 - 038 and 3c 84 were observed every @xmath1120 minutes for amplitude and phase calibrations , and the passband shape of the system was determined based on the observations of the strong continuum sources ",
    "3c 84 or 3c 279 .",
    "we also observed b1040 + 244 and b0953 + 254 several times during each observation run to verify the consistency of the amplitude calibration .",
    "the flux densities of b1040 + 244 and b0953 + 254 were determined several times during the observation runs ; the flux density of b1040 + 244 ranged from 0.92 to 0.97  jy , and that of b0953 + 254 was 0.93  jy . in this study , we adopted a constant flux value of 1.0 jy for both of these sources throughout the observation runs .",
    "the raw visibilities were edited and calibrated using the nro uvproc - ii package @xcite .",

    "( 2 ) further , the band pass characteristics of the instruments used for observation drift over the years and the two sets of data can be regarded as being obtained from two independent instruments , at least to some extent .",
    "therefore , the separate analysis of the data enables a cross - check for any instrumental errors .    because the velocity width ( @xmath32 ) of the co line could not be measured , we assumed two different velocity widths to estimate the upperlimit of the velocity integrated co line flux ( @xmath33 , where @xmath34 denotes the co flux density per beam )",

    "this is less than half of the upperlimit attained in k05 .",
    "since the co ( @xmath0 = 10 ) emission line was not detected , the host galaxy of grb 030329 is most likely to be a dwarf galaxy as observed in the optical band .",
    "for this reason , we next adopted @xmath37 as a more realistic estimation of the velocity width of the host galaxy .",

    "recently , a stronger upperlimit on the @xmath72\\ \\lambda 6586 $ ] has been reported by @xcite , which also supports the lower branch value .    however , a recent update of the metallicity - luminosity relation using @xmath1153,000 star - forming galaxies in the sloan digital sky survey yields a metallicity of @xmath110.2 dex higher than the relation reported by for a given @xmath73 magnitude @xcite . adopting this relation ,",
    "the host galaxy metallicity is estimated to be @xmath75 , which falls equally close to the two @xmath69 solutions .",
    "moreover , it should be noted that the @xmath69 method rapidly loses sensitivity near its local maximum at @xmath76 .",

    "therefore , we must say that there is quite a large ambiguity in the host galaxy s metallicity , ranging from @xmath82 to @xmath118.6 .",
    "this difference has a considerable effect on the upperlimits of the molecular gas mass and sfr of the host galaxy , as summarized in table [ tab_metal ] .",

    "many observations of grb host galaxies in the optical / uv range infer that grb host galaxies are blue , sub - luminous dwarf galaxies with only a moderate sfr .",

    "recently , there have been more such studies that make an attempt to correct for dust extinction , mostly using optical sed fits .",
    "such corrections are useful up to an extent , but lose efficiency when the clouds of dust are so thick that the optical emission is completely obscured from view .",

    "figure [ fig_sfr ] shows how the sfr of grb host galaxies in table [ tab_studies ] measured by extinction - free methods appear when compared to their sfrs measured in the optical / uv band .",
    "as can be seen , most of the results ( positive detections as well as upperlimits ) of extiction - free methods demonstrate sfrs that are greater than the optical results by one to a few orders of magnitude .",
    "the `` positive detections '' that are especially above the one - to - one correspondence line are the results of submillimeter and radio observations by @xcite , where some of these call into question by the much lower `` upperlimits '' set by the non - detection in mid - ir observations @xcite . in order to confirm whether grb host galaxies are actually sub - luminous dwarf galaxies as they appear in the optical view , or dusty active star forming galaxies as they seem to appear in the submillimeter band , measurements with sensitivity to star forming activity as high as the optical / uv methods must also be performed in other wavelengths .",
    "the co measurement has the potential of becoming one of such methods , especially by virtue of future instruments with higher sensitivity , such as the atracama large millimeter - and - submillimeter array ( alma ) .",
