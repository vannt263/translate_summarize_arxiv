    "carbon nanotube is one of the most fascinating materials .",
    "there is a variety of nanotubes from metal to insulator depending on how it is constructed by rolling up a graphene@xcite .",
    "similarly , silicon nanotube may be constructed by rolling up a siliceneshiraishi , aufray , liuprl , ezawanjp , a monolayer of silicon atoms forming a two - dimensional honeycomb lattice .",
    "silicon nanotubes have already been manufactured@xcite .",
    "almost every striking property of carbon nanotube is expected to be transferred to this innovative material since carbon and silicon belong to the same family in the periodic table .",
    "nevertheless there exists a major difference . a large ionic radius of silicon induces a buckled structure@xcite , which results in a relatively large spin - orbit ( so ) gap of @xmath2mev .",
    "accordingly , silicon nanotube has a finite gap and it is always a semiconductor or an insulator .",
    "one might think it is an ordinary bund insulator just as most carbon nanotubes are .",
    "see fig.[fig3dtube ]  for an illustration of carbon nanotube and silicon nanotube .",
    "in this paper we reveal an amazing property of silicon nanotube thanks to this buckled structure when it is placed in external electric field . analyzing the band structure in the presence of electric field",
    "@xmath3 perpendicular to the nanotube axis , we demonstrate that silicon nanotube is actually a topological insulator .",
    "when @xmath3 is beyond a certain critical field @xmath1 , we find four zero - energy modes to emerge in the bulk band gap and form metallic regions along a nanotube .",
    "a silicon nanotube is made of three different phases , the topological insulator region , the bulk insulator region and the metallic region separating them .",
    "topological insulator@xcite is a new state of quantum matter characterized by a full insulating gap in the bulk and gapless edges topologically protected .",
    "these states are made possible due to the combination of the so interaction and the time - reversal symmetry .",
    "the two - dimensional topological insulator is a quantum spin hall ( qsh ) insulator with helical gapless edge modes@xcite , which is a close cousin of the integer quantum hall state .",
    "qsh insulator was proposed by kane and mele in graphene@xcite . however , since the so gap is rather weak in graphene , the qsh effect can occur in graphene only at unrealistically low temperature@xcite .",
    "our finding is that it is materialized naturally in silicon nanotube .",
    "as we have stated , there emerge four zero - energy modes in silicon nanotube under uniform electric field .",
    "they are helical edge modes of a topological insulator and propagate along a nanotube : they transport only spins without charges .",
    "these observations are supported by the effective dirac theory .",
    "we construct explicitly the wave functions describing the four helical zero modes . in conclusion , we are able to realize a dissipationless spin current along a silicon nanotube by applying uniform electric field .",
    "it may be used as a quantum wire in future spintronics .",
    "the band structure of a silicon nanotube is obtained simply by imposing a certain periodic boundary condition to a silicene sheet provided the diameter is large enough .",
    "silicene consists of a honeycomb lattice of silicon atoms with two sublattices made of a sites and b sites .",
    "the states near the fermi energy are @xmath4 orbitals residing near the k and k points at opposite corners of the hexagonal brillouin zone .",
    "we refer to the k or k point also as the k@xmath5 point with the valley index @xmath6 . due to the buckled structure",
    "the two sublattice planes are separated by a distance , which we denote by @xmath7 with @xmath8 .",
    "it generates a staggered sublattice potential @xmath9 between silicon atoms at a sites and b sites in external electric field @xmath10 .",
    "the silicene system is described by the four - band second - nearest - neighbor tight binding model@xcite ,    @xmath11    where @xmath12 creates an electron with spin polarization @xmath13 at site @xmath14 , and @xmath15 run over all the nearest / next - nearest neighbor hopping sites .",
    "the first term represents the usual nearest - neighbor hopping with the transfer energy @xmath16ev . the second term represents the effective so coupling with @xmath17mev , where @xmath18 is the pauli matrix of spin , @xmath19 with @xmath20 and @xmath21 the two bonds connecting the next - nearest neighbors .",
    "the third term represents the rashba so coupling with @xmath22mev , where @xmath23 for the a ( b ) site , and @xmath24 .",
    "the forth term is the staggered sublattice potential term .",
    "the same hamiltonian as can be used to describe germanene , which is a honeycomb structure of germanium@xcite , where various parameters are @xmath25ev , @xmath26mev , @xmath27mev and @xmath28 .    by diagonalizing the hamiltonian ( [ basichamil ] ) under uniform electric field @xmath3",
    ", the band gap @xmath29 of silicene is determined to be@xmath30at the k@xmath5 point , where @xmath31 is the electron spin .",
    "the gap @xmath32 closes at @xmath33 with@xmath34where it is a semimetal due to gapless modes .",
    "it has been shownezawanjp that silicene is a topological insulator for @xmath35 , while it is a balk insulator for @xmath36 , as illustrated in fig.figribbonband .",
    "hence a topological phase transition occurs between a topological insulator and a band insulator as @xmath3 changes .",
    "the topological insulator is characterized by one of the following two defining properties@xcite .",
    "( 1 ) the topological insulator has a nontrivial topological number , the @xmath37 index@xcite , which is defined only for a gapped state .",
    "( 2 ) there emerge gapless modes in the edges [ fig.[figribbonband](b ) ] .",
    "these two properties are closely related one to another .",
    "indeed , the reason why gapless modes appear in the edge of a topological insulator is understood as follows .",
    "when a topological insulator has an edge beyond which the region has the trivial @xmath38 index , the band must close and yield gapless modes in the interface . otherwise the @xmath37 index can not change its value across the interface .",
    "the above criteria can not be applicable to a nanotube as they are since it is intrinsically one - dimensional ( 1d ) .",
    "we overcome the problem by applying electric field and by creating a domain with 1d edges in the surface of a nanotube : see fig.[fighelictube ] we derive later .",
    "a silicon nanotube can be constructed by rolling up a silicene precisely just as a carbon nanotube is constructed by rolling up a graphenesaito , andoreview .",
    "there are a variety of ways how to rolling up a silicene as in the case of carbon nanotubes .",
    "it is specified by the chiral vector,@xmath39where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the basis vectors of the honeycomb lattice with integers @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "let us take the coordinate@xmath44 with the @xmath45-axis parallel to the chiral vector @xmath46 ( the circumference direction ) and the @xmath47-axis orthogonal to it ( the nanotube axis direction ) .",
    "the nanotube s circumference is given by@xmath48where @xmath49  is the lattice constant .",
    "let us denote the conjugate momemtum as @xmath50 .",
    "we impose the periodic boundary condition @xmath51 .",
    "it makes the wave vector @xmath52 discrete , i.e. , @xmath53where @xmath54 is the number of silicon atoms per unit cell .",
    "the wave vector @xmath55 remains continuous within the 1d first brillouin zone,@xmath56where @xmath57 is the length of the primitive translation vector in the @xmath47 direction .",
    "the 1d energy bands are given by the straight lines specified by ( [ condikx ] ) and ( [ condiky ] ) in the @xmath58 space .",
    "the simplest nanotube is the armchair type , where @xmath59 .    ) , each band contains two - fold degenerate zero - energy states corresponding to up and down spins .",
    "( b ) the band structure of silicene nanoribbon for @xmath60 .",
    "all states are gapped , and it is bulk insulator .",
    "the horizontal axis is the momentum , and the vertical axis is the energy in unit of the transfer energy @xmath61.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    the energy spectrum of a silicon nanotube is simply given by@xmath62 in terms of the energy spectrum @xmath63 of silicene .",
    "the energy spectrum of a carbon nanotube can be gapless since graphene has a gapless band .",
    "there is a variety of carbon nanotubes from metal to insulator depending on the way how to choose the chiral vector @xmath64 . on the contrary",
    ", a silicon nanotube has always a finite gap since silicene has a finite gap .",
    "the band gap is rather insensitive to the choice of @xmath64 .    .",
    "there appear four bands crossing the gap .",
    "they are the zero - energy states separating the topological and band insulating states in the nanotube surface : see fig.[fighelictube ] .",
    "when the rashba interaction is neglected ( @xmath65 ) , each band contains two - fold degenerate zero - energy states corresponding to up and down spins .",
    "the horizontal axis is the momentum , and the vertical axis is the energy in unit of the transfer energy @xmath61.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    we have calculated the band structure of an armchair silicon nanotube based on the tight - binding model ( [ basichamil ] ) by changing the uniform external electric field @xmath3 .",
    "the band structure is strikingly different for @xmath66 and @xmath67 , as illustrated in fig.[figtubeband ] .",
    "all states are gapped for @xmath66 . on the other hand , for @xmath68 , there appear four bands crossing the gap at the k and k points . when the rashba interaction is neglected ( @xmath69 ) , each band contains two - fold degenerate zero - energy states corresponding to up and down spins . even when @xmath70 , the degeneracy remains unsolved at the k ( k ) point , though it is slightly resolved away from these points .",
    "the feature of the zero - energy states is highly contrasted with that in a silicene nanoribbon , where they emerge at @xmath71 as in fig.figribbonband(a ) .    , with @xmath72 , as indicates the emergence of four metallic states separating topological and band insulators : see fig.[fighelictube ] .",
    "the holizontal axis is the circumference ( @xmath73 ) or the angle ( @xmath74 ) .",
    ", scaledwidth=45.0% ]    we show the probability density of these four zero modes in fig.figjrwave , to which we have assigned the spin @xmath75 and the valley k@xmath76 where they appear .",
    "we are able to make the assignment and determine the direction of the current based on the effective dirac theory : see a sentence below ( [ thetacriti ] ) and fig.[fighelictube ] . here",
    "we explain them by using the gap formula ( [ gap ] ) and the band structure in fig.[figtubeband](b ) .",
    "it follows from the formula ( [ gap ] ) that the electrons with spin @xmath77 are gapless at the k@xmath78 point for @xmath79 and that the electrons with spin @xmath80 are gapless at the k@xmath78 point for @xmath81 .",
    "thus the peaks indexed by k@xmath82 appear in the upper half and those indexed by k@xmath83 appear in the lower half of the nanotube .",
    "recall that @xmath3 is the electric field between the a and b sublattices , which is opposite between the upper and lower halves of the nanotube .",
    "furthermore , the direction of the current can be determined by examining the dispersion relation of the zero - energy mode in the band structure [ fig.[figtubeband](b ) ] .",
    "we find the up - spin electrons and the down - spin electrons propagate into the opposite directions in each peak .",
    "namely the current is helical , that is , it is a spin current , as illustrated in fig.[fighelictube ] .",
    "it is a characteristic feature that helical zero modes appear along the edge of a topological insulator .",
    "we conclude that the zero - energy metallic state separates the topological and band insulating states in a silicon nanotube .",
    "in order to explore deeper physics of the helical zero modes , we analyze the low - energy effective hamiltonian derived from the tight binding model ( basichamil ) .",
    "it is described by the dirac theory around the @xmath84 point as@xcite@xmath85with@xmath86where @xmath87 is the pauli matrix of the sublattice pseudospin , @xmath88 m/s is the fermi velocity .",
    "we have shown numerically that there emerge four zero - energy states inside the bulk band gap as in fig.[figtubeband](b ) .",
    "the low - energy dirac theory allows us to investigate analytically the properties of these helical zero modes . in",
    "so doing we set @xmath69 to simplify calculations .",
    "this approximation is justified by the following reasons .",
    "first all all , we have numerically checked that the band structure is rather insensitive to @xmath89 based on the tight - binding hamiltonian ( [ basichamil ] ) .",
    "second , @xmath89 appears only in the combination @xmath90 in the hamiltonian ( dirachamil ) , which vanishes exactly at the k@xmath78 points .",
    "third , the critical electric field @xmath1 is independent of @xmath91 as in ( [ critie ] ) .    .",
    "there appear two topological insulator regions and two band insulator regions .",
    "they are separated by metallic states made of helical zero modes .",
    "a spin current flows in each metallic region as indicated .",
    "for instance , up - spin ( down - spin ) electrons propagate into the left ( right ) direction at @xmath92.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    we take the @xmath47-axis parallel to the nanotube axis and the @xmath45-axis along the circumference .",
    "we may set @xmath93constant due to the translational invariance along the @xmath47 axis .",
    "the momentum @xmath94 is a good quantum number . setting@xmath95we",
    "seek the zero - energy solution , where @xmath96 is a four - component amplitude .",
    "the particle - hole symmetry guarantees the existence of zero - energy solutions satisfying the relation @xmath97 with @xmath98 .",
    "here , @xmath99 is a two - component amplitude with the up spin and the down spin , @xmath100",
    ". then the eigenvalue problem yields@xmath101together with a linear dispersion relation@xmath102the equation of motion for the component @xmath103 reads@xmath104we apply the uniform electric field @xmath105 perpendicular to the nanotube axis .    the effective field for electrons in a silicon nanotube is given by @xmath106with @xmath107 .",
    "we take @xmath108 with ( [ critie ] ) .",
    "we solve the equation@xmath109let us chose one solution and denote it as@xmath110we obtain two solutions @xmath111 and @xmath112 for @xmath113 , and two solutions @xmath114 and @xmath115 for @xmath116 .",
    "it implies that the zero modes at @xmath117 contains up - spin electrons ( @xmath118 ) from the k valley ( @xmath119 ) and down - spin electron ( @xmath120 ) from the k valley ( @xmath121 ) , and so on , as illustrated in fig.[figjrwave ] . as we shall soon see , the sign @xmath122 is fixed at each @xmath123 , as implies that up - spin and down spin electrons propagate into the opposite directions according to the dispersion relation ( [ disperelat ] ) .",
    "the current is helical , whose direction is determined by the sign of @xmath124 .",

    "it satisfies the periodic boundary condition @xmath129 or @xmath130 .",
