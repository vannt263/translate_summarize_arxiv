    "the skyrme model @xcite is a solitonic model of nuclear matter .",
    "it contains an @xmath0 valued scalar field , @xmath1 , identified with the pion field , and baryons and nuclei emerge in it as topological solitons , called skyrmions . for a review , see ref .",
    "@xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a variant of the model has been put forward and termed the bps skyrme model , in which solutions satisfying a bogomolnyi type bound are admitted @xcite .",
    "the model has been used to describe baryons @xcite , nuclei @xcite , and , with coupling to gravity , neutron stars @xcite .    in the present paper ,",
    "the bps skyrme model is considered , and it is demonstrated that due to its high degree of symmetry , the model also possesses some remarkable features : with somewhat less restrictive boundary conditions , solutions with finite energy but non - integer charge are obtained .",
    "note , however , that this property is expected to be lost in perturbed models , therefore it does not affect the phenomenological applicability of the model .",
    "we would also like to mention , that in non - bps and baby variants of the skyrme model , states that can be considered bound states ( or molecules ) of skyrmions with fractional charge have been obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite . for fractional - charge configurations in @xmath2 gauge theory with regular field - strength on a two - sphere , see refs .",
    "@xcite , and for fractionally charged self - dual solutions in an @xmath0 gauge theory , ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the bps skyrme model is defined with the action @xmath3\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is the topological current density , defined as @xmath5 here @xmath1 is the pion field , taking its value in the group @xmath0 ( the target space ) , and @xmath6 is the four - dimensional levi - civit tensor .",
    "the potential @xmath7 is assumed to be a function of @xmath8 only , e.g. , @xmath9 with @xmath10 a positive real parameter ( e.g. , @xmath11 ) .",
    "the constants @xmath12 and @xmath13 can be scaled away by suitable rescalings of the coordinates and fields @xcite .",
    "let us first calculate the time - like component of the topological current , the topological charge density , @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the three - dimensional levi - civit tensor .",
    "the charge density in eq .",
    "( [ eq : tchg ] ) is the pull - back of the invariant volume form of the group @xmath0 , therefore , it is invariant to all volume preserving diffeomorphisms on both the physical and on the target space @xcite .    for static configurations ,",
    "all but the time - like component of @xmath4 vanish , and the energy density calculated from the action ( [ eq : lag ] ) is @xmath16\\,,\\ ] ] which , as a consequence of the invariance of the charge , is also invariant to volume preserving diffeomorphisms both on physical and target space .",
    "let us now consider spherically symmetric bps skyrmion , i.e. , soliton solutions of the bps skyrme model .",
    "a simple ansatz for spherical symmetry is obtained as follows @xcite .",
    "let @xmath17 where @xmath18 denotes the pauli matrices , and @xmath19 is a unit vector field , @xmath20 where @xmath21 denote the usual spherical coordinates in space , and @xmath22 is an integer .",
    "for such configurations , it is easily calculated , that the only non - zero component of the topological current density is @xmath23 and thus if @xmath24 , @xmath25 , the winding number @xmath26 agrees with @xmath22 . for the energy density",
    ", we get @xmath27\\,.\\ ] ] the last term is topological , and thus , in each topological sector a minimum is obtained if the @xmath28 bogomolnyi - prasad - sommerfield ( bps ) equations hold , i.e. , the term in the curly bracket in eq .",
    "( [ eq : bps_erg ] ) vanishes .",
    "solutions of the bps equation can be found numerically @xcite . in the @xmath29 case",
    ", a closed form solution is also known @xcite . note also , that solutions of the radial equation ( [ eq : bps_eq ] ) with different winding number @xmath22 are related to each other via rescalings @xcite .",
    "( note , that there is a sharp contrast with the original skyrme model of refs .",
    "@xcite , where skyrmions have definite shape , and higher winding number skyrmions are not spherically symmetric . )",
    "let us now use the invariance of the model against volume preserving diffeomorphisms to construct solutions , where a fraction of the charge is in a large volume , and the rest is far away , not interacting .    intuitively , what we are going to do , is to take a spherically symmetric skyrmion with the charge rounded up to the next integer .",
    "we then keep a part containing the desired amount of charge , and remove a slice containing the rest .",
    "this is done by making the angle of the slice thinner , squeezing the slice farther out , and deforming the remaining part into a smaller sphere ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : radtrf ] ) . as a function of the parameter determining",
    "how thin the charge containing the excess charge is , one can imagine the action of the transformations as the motion of a fluid .",
    "let @xmath30 denote the spherically symmetric solution obtained in section [ sec : skyrmions ] , and consider , as our new solution , @xmath31 , with @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a small number , @xmath34 is the integer obtained by rounding @xmath22 _ away from zero _ and @xmath35 ( if necessary , a smooth function approximating @xmath36 may be used ) . due to the invariance of the energy density ,",
    "the result is still a static solution of the field equations .    the function @xmath37 is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : angle ] , and the effect of the transformation on the skyrmion is sketched in fig .  [",
    "fig : radtrf ] .",
    "the points inside the skyrmion , at angles @xmath38 are moved towards the origin , and to a larger angle . at the same time , the points with angular coordinate @xmath39 are moved closer to the @xmath40 line , and away from the origin .",
    "the charge energy densities in the model [ see eqs .",
    "( [ eq : tchg ] ) and ( [ eq : erg ] ) ] are invariant against volume preserving diffeomorphisms , therefore , the charge and energy densities are also only moved along with the points , with the transformation ( [ eq : phitilde ] ) , and their integrals are unchanged .",
    "the charge in the region @xmath41 is @xmath22 for the new solution .",
    "the remaining part , @xmath42 , in the region @xmath43 , is being pushed away from the origin , farther for smaller @xmath44 . in this region , the charge and energy densities are bounded by their respective values in the spherically symmetric solution at the origin .",
    "as @xmath44 approaches zero , in a finite volume , the @xmath43 region becomes very thin , and , as the energy and charge densities here are bounded , its total energy and charge become arbitrarily small . in this sense",
    ", it becomes unobservable . as a result",
    ", we get a solution , where only a fraction of the charge is localised in an arbitrarily large volume , not interacting with the remaining part far away .    for @xmath45 the point - wise limit of our configuration",
    "is also given by the ansatz ( [ eq : param ] ) , however , with @xmath22 real ( not necessarily integer ) . in this sense , we have constructed a skyrmion with fractional charge .",
    "this field configuration jumps at @xmath46 .",
    "plane ) : a part containing charge @xmath22 is being deformed into a fractionally charged skyrmion , and the slice containing the remaining part , @xmath47 , is squeezed out to larger distances . ]",
    "in the present paper , we have demonstrated , that the bps skyrme model admits solutions with a non - integer charge localised in a volume that can be taken of any size , not interacting with the remaining part .",
    "the localised part of the solution is spherically symmetric apart from a thin band connecting it to the far away part , and approaches a fractional solution in the usual ansatz point - wise .",
    "the possibility of such solutions is a consequence of the high degree of symmetry of the model . using the symmetries of the model",
    ", the band connecting the fractional skyrmion with its remaining part can be made arbitrarily thin , containing a negligible amount of charge and energy .    in the bps skyrme model , unlike for , e.g. , a free scalar field , there is no energy term quadratic in the first derivatives of the field . as a result of this unusual property of the model , large changes in the field variable over small distances",
    "can give small contribution to the energy .",
    "in other words , this is a consequence of the topological nature of the charge and that the kinetic energy is the charge squared : the energy is insensitive to distances , as far as volumes are preserved .",
    "one of the motivations of the bps skyrme model is , that it describes a fluid @xcite .",
    "adding terms which give a surface tension to the fluid would make the energy of the bands connecting the fractional skyrmion parts proportional to their area , in a sense , leading to a confining potential between them ."
