    "the phenomenon of the anderson localization @xcite in systems with disorder has been extensively studied for electron transport and linear waves ( see e.g. @xcite ) . a remarkable experimental progress with the bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) in optical lattices ( see e.g. reviews @xcite ) stimulated the interest to investigations of the effects of nonlinearity on localization .",
    "at present the signatures of localization of bec in one - dimensional ( 1d ) optical disordered lattices have been detected by different experimental groups @xcite .",
    "the effects of nonlinearity appear also for experiments with bec in kicked optical lattices @xcite where the quantum chaos in the chirikov standard map ( kicked rotator ) @xcite is investigated .",
    "a similar type of problem also comes out for propagation of nonlinear waves in disordered photonic lattices which are now actively studied experimentally @xcite .",
    "in addition to that the problem of lasing in random media @xcite is also linked to the interplay of localization and nonlinearity that makes it related to the important field of nonlinear wave propagation in disordered media @xcite . in this work",
    "we concentrate our studies on the time dependent wave packet spreading in presence of disorder and nonlinearity leaving aside the problem of directed flow and scattering in nonlinear media ( see e.g. refs . in @xcite and",
    "more recent @xcite ) .",
    "the theoretical treatment of the interplay between localization and nonlinearity uses numerical simulations ( see e.g. @xcite ) and various analytical tools ( see e.g. @xcite )",
    ". however , even rather powerful analytical tools @xcite do not allow to obtain the full solution of this rather complex problem .",
    "the existing rigorous mathematical results show that for a sufficiently small nonlinearity there exists a kolmogorov - arnold - moser integrable localized regime for almost all initial conditions @xcite but these results are applicable only to unrealistically small strength of nonlinearity . due to that the numerical simulations become especially important for investigation of this problem . for numerical studies",
    "it is especially convenient to use a discrete lattice that allows to push numerical simulations to extremely large times .",
    "in addition to that the time evolution on a lattice is closely linked to the problem of energy propagation in complex molecules , e.g. proteins , where nonlinear couplings give transitions between localized linear modes @xcite .",
    "one of the examples of such a nonlinear oscillator chain is the frenkel - kontorova model in the pinned phase where the linear sound modes are localized in space @xcite .",
    "recently , the interplay of the anderson localization and nonlinearity has been investigated by a number of mathematical methods where a certain number of interesting mathematical results has been obtained @xcite . however , these methods still should be developed further to understand the asymptotic properties of spreading in the lattice at moderate strength of nonlinearity .    in this paper",
    "we further develop the old @xcite and recent studies @xcite of the discrete anderson nonlinear schrdinger equation ( danse ) and present large scale numerical simulations of this model in one and two dimensions d ( 1d , 2d ) .",
    "in addition we perform numerical simulations for the kicked nonlinear rotator model ( knr ) introduced in @xcite .",
    "our numerical results obtained on dimensionless time scales up to @xmath8 show that at moderate nonlinearity , above a certain threshold , the wave packet spreads unlimitedly over the lattice in such a way that the squared displacement of the packet on the lattice grows according to the algebraic law @xmath9 with the exponent @xmath10 for @xmath5 and @xmath11 for @xmath12 .",
    "this dependence is in a satisfactory agreement with the 1d estimates @xcite which give @xmath13 and the analytical estimates of this paper which give @xmath14 for 2d .",
    "we also study the fidelity decay which shows interesting properties for the nonlinear evolution described by our model .",
    "the paper is composed as follows : in section ii we give the model description and present simple estimates ; the results for 1d and 2d are presented in sections iii and iv respectively , the properties of nonlinear fidelity decay are discussed in section iv ; the conclusions are given in section v.",
    "our system is described by the danse model : @xmath15 where @xmath16 characterizes nonlinearity , @xmath17 is a hopping matrix element on nearby sites , on - site energies are randomly and homogeneous distributed in the range @xmath18 , and the total probability is normalized to unity @xmath19 . here , @xmath20 is the lattice index , in 1d it is an integer , in 2d it is an integer vector of lattice indexes @xmath21 . for @xmath22 and weak",
    "disorder all eigenstates are exponentially localized with the localization length @xmath23 ( 1d ) at the center of the energy band and @xmath24 in 2d @xcite .",
    "hereafter we set for convenience @xmath25 , thus the energy coincides with the frequency .",
    "we emphasize here that the danse ( [ eq1 ] ) exactly describes recent experiments with one - dimensional disordered waveguide lattices ( cf .",
    "( 1 ) in @xcite ) , and it also serves as a paradigmatic model for a wide class of physical problems where interplay of nonlinearity and disorder is important . the danse can be considered as the gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) @xcite taken on a discretized lattice . in 1d",
    "this model was studied recently in @xcite .    to understand the evolution properties of system ( [ eq1 ] ) it is convenient to expand @xmath26 in the basis of localized eigenmodes at @xmath22 @xcite : @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are amplitudes in the basis of sites and eigenmodes respectively . due to the localization of linear eigenmodes with length @xmath30 we have for the transformation matrix @xmath31 , where @xmath32 are some random phases . from ( [ eq1 ] )",
    "it follows that the amplitudes @xmath29 in the linear eigenbasis are described by the equation @xmath33 where @xmath34 are the eigenmode energies .",
    "the transitions between linear eigenmodes appear only due to the nonlinear @xmath16-term and the transition matrix elements are @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "there are about @xmath36 random terms in the sum in ( [ eq2 ] ) with @xmath37 so that we have @xmath38 .",
    "we assume that the probability is distributed over @xmath39 states of the lattice basis .",
    "then from the normalization condition we have @xmath40 and the transition rate to new non - populated states in the basis @xmath41 is @xmath42 . due to localization",
    "these transitions take place on a size @xmath30 and hence the diffusion rate in the distance @xmath43 of @xmath44  dimensional @xmath45  space is @xmath46 . at large time scales @xmath47 and we obtain @xmath48 thus as in @xcite for @xmath5 we have @xmath49 and for @xmath12 this gives @xmath50 , while for large @xmath51 the scaling is independent of @xmath51 : @xmath52 .",
    "the relation ( [ eq3 ] ) assumes that the dynamics of nonlinear chain ( [ eq1 ] ) is chaotic . on a first glance it seems that it can not be the case since as soon as @xmath53 grows with time the nonlinear frequency shift @xmath54 decreases .",
    "however , the physical importance relays not on the shift value itself but on its ratio to a frequency spacing between frequencies of excited modes which is @xmath55 .",
    "the latter relation results from the fact that all the frequencies are distributed in a finite energy ( frequency ) band and therefore @xmath53 states excited inside such a band have energy and frequency spacing @xmath55 .",
    "the dynamics is chaotic if the overlap parameter @xmath56 .",
    "it is important to stress that @xmath57 is independent of @xmath53 . by its nature",
    "this criterion is somehow different from the usual chirikov resonance - overlap criterion @xcite since in our case the unperturbed system is represented by a set of linear oscillators while in @xcite the oscillators are nonlinear .",
    "however , the condition @xmath58 looks rather natural since in the opposite limit @xmath59 the coupling between modes is very weak if the linear frequencies are linearly independent ( that should be true in a disordered potential ) .",
    "in addition the investigations of three nonlinear oscillators with nonlinear couplings performed in @xcite indeed confirmed the criterion @xmath60 .",
    "therefore from the criterion @xmath61 we obtain that above some critical nonlinear coupling @xmath62 the dynamics remains chaotic even if probability spreads over larger and larger parts of the lattice .",
    "this spreading should follow the relation ( [ eq3 ] ) . during this process",
    "the local lyapunov exponent @xmath63 decreases to zero since the system size is unlimited but locally the dynamics is chaotic .",
    "another argument in favor of unlimited spreading can be obtained on the basis of certain similarities and parallels with the frenkel - kontorova chain . in this nonlinear chain",
    "the number of configurations static in time ( @xmath64 in ( [ eq1 ] ) ) grows exponentially with the length of the chain while the energy splitting between these configurations drops exponentially with the chain length ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , due to this energy quasi - degeneracy between these static configurations , it is rather natural to expect that during the time evolution a spreading over all these configurations continues unlimitedly .",
    "for @xmath65 this spreading corresponds to a regime of strong chaos with mixing of all modes .",
    "the situation for @xmath66 may have other mechanisms of slow chaos with slower spreading and should be analyzed separately .",
    "for example , the typical spacing in the resonant terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) is @xmath67 and it is smaller than the coupling matrix element @xmath68 for @xmath69 .",
    "therefore , it is possible that for @xmath70 there may be a propagation of two - modes - pairs on a distance much larger than @xmath30 in a certain similarity with a quantum dynamics of the two interacting particles ( tip ) in a random potential discussed in @xcite . indeed , eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) can be viewed as a mean field approximation for the tip hamiltonian considered in @xcite . in analogy with the tip problem it is possible to expect that the distribution of the probability in the basis of linear eigenmodes @xmath71 will be characterized by the breit - wigner shape :",
    "@xmath72 $ ] ( see e.g. discussion in @xcite for tip ) . here",
    ", the value of @xmath73 is given by the above estimates .",
    "however , the verification of this breit - wigner relation requires further numerical tests with a projection on the eigenbasis of linear modes that was not done in this work . in this paper",
    "we concentrate our studies on the regime @xmath74 .",
    "to test the above theoretical predictions we perform the numerical simulations of the time evolution given by eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "the split operator scheme on a time step @xmath75 is used for integration : @xmath76 where @xmath77 is a diagonal operator in the lattice space and the application of the hopping operator @xmath78 is done by the fast fourier transform to the conjugated space where @xmath78 becomes diagonal taking in 2d the form @xmath79 .",
    "for the results presented in next sections we used @xmath80 and the averaging was done over @xmath81 realisations of disorder .",
    "we checked that a variation of @xmath75 by a factor 2 - 4 does not affect the numerical data for short times ( e.g. @xmath82 ) and on the large time scales @xmath83 the statistical behavior of the results remains unchanged .",
    "of course , on large times the exact values of @xmath84 are different for different @xmath75 due to exponential instability of dynamics .",
    "but the integration scheme ( [ eq4 ] ) is symplectic and preserves the total probability exactly while the total energy is preserved approximately with the accuracy of @xmath85 .",
    "indeed , the final integration step generates high frequency @xmath86 that is significantly larger than the energy band width of the linear problem .",
    "we checked that for 1d this integration scheme gives the same results as other schemes used in @xcite .",
    "the lattice size in 1d was @xmath87 site and in 2d @xmath88 .",
    "the initial state was chosen with all probability on one site in the middle of the lattice .",
    "we note that for the knr model ( [ eq5 ] ) the integration precision is on the level of double precision of the computer since the integration is done by the fast fourier transform from coordinate to momentum representation and in the each representation the integration is performed exactly up to the computer double precision .     in 1d for the disorder strength @xmath89 at @xmath22 ( black ) and @xmath90 ( red / gray ) .",

    "indeed , it should be noted that the standard deviation @xmath108 for fluctuations in the exponent @xmath106 from one disorder realization to another @xcite is larger than the the formal standard error of the fit of averaged data ( with @xmath109 ) .",

    ".  [ fig9 ] , ref .",
    "@xcite , fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] respectively ) . a small spreading seeing in the knr model at enormously large time @xmath1 may indicate that a very slow ( logarithmic ? ) spreading in time is not completely excluded and processes like the arnold diffusion @xcite may be present .",
    "however , this spreading , even if present , is so slow that in global the presented numerical data can be considered as a confirmation of the theoretical expectation according to which for a typical initial state the localization is preserved at @xmath66 .",
    "our data indicate that @xmath207 . indeed , the spreading behavior is qualitatively different for @xmath208 and @xmath209 .",
    "it is possible that such type of slow probability and energy spreading over disordered lattices may play an important role in complex molecules giving more rapid propagation of probability and energy along molecular chains compared to a simple diffusion produced by noise .",
    "it would be interesting to observe the nonlinear destruction of localization for bec in disordered potential or for nonlinear waves in photonic lattices but this is rather hard task since very long observation times are required for that .",
