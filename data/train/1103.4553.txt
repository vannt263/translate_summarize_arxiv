    "recently kalisky _ et al . _ reported the observation of  stripes \" of enhanced local diamagnetic susceptibility in scanning squid microscope ( ssm ) images of underdoped ba(fe@xmath0co@xmath1)@xmath2as@xmath3@xcite they interpreted these stripes as being due to enhanced superfluid density ( reduced london penetration depth ) along twin boundaries .",
    "et al . _ modeled these experiments by solving london s and maxwell s equations using finite element methods in an appropriate geometry.@xcite these calculations were in agreement with the experimental lineshapes , and provided estimates for the increase in the superfluid density on the twin planes .",
    "however , it was difficult to model geometries with regions of enhanced superfluid density as narrow as seemed physically likely , so that extrapolations to narrow widths from wider ones were necessary .    the geometry relevant to this problem , that of a slab imbedded perpendicular to the sample surface in a bulk half - space superconductor , is difficult to treat analytically .",
    "here we make the problem tractable by ( 1 ) assuming that the width of the region with reduced penetration depth is small relative to other lengths in the problem , and ( 2 ) treating the problem to first order in a perturbation expansion .",
    "the first assumption is most likely valid for the case of ssm , since in this case the experimentally observed stripes in susceptibility are resolution limited.@xcite treating the problem to first order in a perturbation expansion seems reasonable , since at least at low temperatures the stripes in susceptibility observed using ssm are much smaller than the susceptibility itself .",
    "although the method developed here for the evaluation of the meissner response of superconductors with inhomogeneities is general , we will use as a concrete example scanning squid susceptometry , @xcite which employs a sensor with two concentric , co - planar loops : one loop carries a small current @xmath4 that is a source of a weak magnetic field , and the other loop couples the response magnetic flux into the sensor squid .",
    "this is an elaboration of the common squid magnetometry , in which a squid senses the intrinsic magnetic fields without a source coil .",
    "our results are relevant for magnetic force microscopy ( mfm ) as well . however ,",
    "applying our approach to mfm requires modeling of magnetic tips with complex geometry and is outside of the scope of this paper .",
    "twin and grain boundaries in superconductors may have enhanced as well as suppressed superfluid density .",
    "we will use below a generic term  defect \" .",
    "the theory developed here applies for both enhancement and suppression , provided that the deviation of the superfluid density ( or of the london penetration depth ) at the defect from the bulk value is small .",
    "let us consider a magnetic field source with known field distribution @xmath5 in the absence of a superconductor .",
    "the source is placed above the superconducting half - space @xmath6 .",
    "the total field in the empty half - space @xmath7 can be written as @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the response field , which satisfies @xmath10 in vacuum outside the superconductor .",
    "one can look for this field as @xmath11 , with the scalar potential @xmath12 obeying the laplace equation and the boundary condition that it approaches zero far from the surface .",
    "the general form of such a potential is @xmath13 here , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 is directed normal to the superconducting flat surface at @xmath17 ; @xmath18 is the two - dimensional ( 2d ) fourier transform with respect to variables @xmath19 at any fixed @xmath7 .",
    "the potential ( [ laplace ] ) is defined only in the upper half - space ; hence , the problem of uniqueness that is in general associated with the description of the static magnetic field by a scalar potential does not arise .",
    "thus , to know the outside field distribution it suffices to find the 2d fourier transform @xmath20 . in principle , this can be done by solving the internal london problem and by utilizing the boundary conditions of field continuity at the interface @xmath17 .",
    "the formal difficulty to overcome is to calculate the 2d fourier transform of internal fields for non - uniform superconductors .",
    "below , we show how this can be done in a few cases relevant for ssm and mfm .      to demonstrate the method , we start with the simple situation of a uniform and isotropic half space , for which the london equation is @xmath21 , with @xmath22 being the london penetration depth .",
    "the 2d fourier transform then reads : @xmath23 where the prime denotes @xmath24 .",
    "the solution that vanishes at @xmath25 is @xmath26 with @xmath27 independent of @xmath16 .",
    "@xmath28 should satisfy @xmath29 , which yields in fourier space : @xmath30 the requirement of field continuity at @xmath17 gives : @xmath31 we took into account here that for the source of the magnetic field placed at @xmath32 , the potential under it , in particular at @xmath17 , is given by @xmath33 so that @xmath34 .    multiplying eq.([hx ] ) by @xmath35 , ( [ hy ] ) by @xmath36 , and ( [ hz ] ) by @xmath37 , adding them up , and using eq.([divh=0 ] ) yields : @xmath38 thus , the response fields outside and inside are expressed in terms of the unperturbed source field @xmath39 .",
    "this result has been obtained in ref . as a particular case of cumbersome anisotropic formulas ; here it follows directly from the isotropic london equations .",
    "for the general case of an inhomogeneous penetration depth @xmath40 , the magnetic field within the superconductor obeys the london equation in the form : @xmath41 this equation is the minimum condition for the london energy functional @xmath42 , \\label{lond - energy}\\ ] ] which holds for inhomogeneous @xmath43 .    for a planar defect at @xmath44",
    ", we model the penetration depth by @xmath45 where a positive @xmath46 with the dimension of length is related to a superfluid density enhancement , whereas @xmath47 corresponds to a superfluid density suppression .",
    "physically , the superfluid density at the planar defect may extend to distances on the order of the coherence length @xmath48 into the bulk .",
    "however , within the london approach for materials with @xmath49 the representation ( [ lam(x ) ] ) is justified . the advantage of eq.([lam(x ) ] ) is that it allows one to do the 2d fourier transform of the london equation for which analytic expressions for all transformed quantities on the whole @xmath19 plane are needed .",
    "an alternative way to address the problem could be to consider the defect as a layer of a finite thickness with the penetration depth different from @xmath22 of the surrounding material , to look for solutions of the london equations in each part separately and to match them with certain boundary conditions .",
    "these real space solutions should then be matched with the real space field distribution in the outer space to calculate the response field .",
    "this approach , however , is more cumbersome and certainly less tractable and transparent as compared to the method utilizing the 2d fourier transform employed here .",
    "with @xmath50 of eq.([lam(x ) ] ) , the london equation ( [ l1 ] ) takes the form @xmath51 the idea of the following manipulation is based on the physical assumption that the influence of the defect on the field distribution is weak , @xmath52 , and one can use a perturbation argument for its evaluation .",
    "fits of the present theory to the experiments of kalisky _ et al . _",
    "[ fig:3 ] ) require values of @xmath53 . however , comparison of finite element modeling of the same problem ( fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] ) are in reasonable agreement with the present theory , even for @xmath53 .",
    "this justifies keeping only the first order in perturbation theory , resulting in a considerable simplification of the problem .    having this in mind",
    ", we look for the field inside as @xmath54 , where the unperturbed field satisfies @xmath55 in the absence of the defect plane , whereas @xmath56 is a perturbation due to the boundary .",
    "we then obtain in the first order : @xmath57 where @xmath58 has been calculated in the preceding section .",
    "one now calculates the 2d fourier transform ( ft ) of the left - hand side ( lhs ) : @xmath59    calculating the 2d ft of the rhs of eq.([l3da ] ) , one can use easily verifiable identities , see appendix a : @xmath60=    \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\frac{dq_x}{2\\pi } \\,f(q_x , k_y)\\,,\\label{id1 } \\\\ & & ft[\\delta^\\prime(x )   f(\\bm r ) ] = i   \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\frac{dq_x}{2\\pi } \\ , ( k_x - q_x)f(q_x , k_y)\\,.\\quad\\label{id2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we obtain after straightforward algebra : @xmath61 where out of the three components of the vector @xmath62 we will need only one : @xmath63 where @xmath64 .",
