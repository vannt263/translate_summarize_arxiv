    "affine toda field theories are two - dimensional models described by the euclidean action @xmath1 the @xmath2-dimensional vectors @xmath3 are the simple roots of an affine kac - moody algebra  @xcite and @xmath4 are positive integers depending on the algebra and satisfying @xmath5 the field @xmath6 is a set of @xmath2 real scalar components",
    ". finally , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are a mass scale parameter and the coupling constant .",
    "the coxeter number is the positive integer @xmath9 .    under the transformation @xmath10",
    ", the lattice of the simple roots transforms into the lattice of another affine algebra .",
    "the invariant algebras are called self - dual ; they belong to the untwisted a - d - e series @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and to the twisted series @xmath14 .",
    "the other algebras are the pairs @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath0 , and @xmath17 ; they are invariant under @xmath18 .    at the classical level ,",
    "affine toda theories have no coupling ; @xmath8 can be scaled away , the spectrum is proportional to @xmath7 , independent of @xmath8 and moreover it is given by simple universal formulae in terms of the coxeter number .",
    "the interest of the classical theory is that the field equations of motion admit a lax pair and therefore there is an infinite hierachy of conserved currents with increasing spin .    at the quantum level , this property is inherited in the form of a factorized s - matrix .",
    "the dependence on @xmath8 which plays the role of planck s constant becomes non trivial ; on the other hand the parameter @xmath7 becomes unphysical due to renormalization effects and only mass ratios are observables .",
    "since the s - matrix is expected to be factorizable , its explicit form may be sought .",
    "one can make a guess and impose physical constraints like unitarity or crossing symmetry and the additional bootstrap principle . in the case of the self - dual theories",
    ", perturbation theory suggests that the mass ratios do not renormalize .",
    "indeed , the bootstrap equations close on an ansatz for the s - matrix based on the tree level spectrum and on the fusings allowed by the three - point couplings  @xcite .",
    "perturbation theory and the structure of the bootstrap suggest conjectured expressions for the exact @xmath8 dependence of the s - matrix which show a remarkable duality between weak and strong coupling in terms of the transformation @xmath19 .    as pointed out in  @xcite , for the non self dual pairs the picture is more complicated .",
    "mass ratios deform already at the lowest order of perturbation theory and the simplest ansatz for the s - matrix fails .",
    "however , a non trivial solution to the bootstrap equations can be found with the feature of predicting @xmath8 dependent mass ratios  @xcite .",
    "the predictions are then formally the same as in the classical theory , but in terms of a `` renormalized '' coxeter number @xmath20 .",
    "again , the explicit non perturbative form of @xmath20 is not known .",
    "the simplest conjecture  @xcite , consistent with low order perturbation theory  @xcite and current algebra  @xcite predicts a new kind of duality . under @xmath21",
    "the s - matrices of the pair members get exchanged .",
    "hence , the strong coupling regime in one theory should be given by the weak coupling regime in the other .",
    "in  @xcite a monte carlo study of duality in the pair @xmath0 was performed by mean of the metropolis algorithm .",
    "the authors determined the mass ratio in the @xmath22 theory over a wide range of couplings and they did find agreement with the duality conjecture .",
    "specifically , they checked that the mass ratio in @xmath22 ranged between its classical values and the classical value of @xmath23 .    in this paper i carried over the above simulation on larger lattices with higher statistics in order to pin down the precise dependence on @xmath8 .",
    "moreover , i have used the hybrid monte carlo algorithm  @xcite .",
    "finally , i have extended the simulation to the @xmath23 theory in order to have a complete picture .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following : section  [ pair ] describes the pair @xmath0 ; section  [ oneloop ] shows the one loop deformations of the mass ratios ; section  [ simulation ] gives some detail on the numerical simulation ; finally , in section  [ results ] the results are discussed .",
    "the pair ( @xmath22 , @xmath23 ) has @xmath24 and its action is @xmath25 the integers @xmath26 and the simple roots are @xmath27 the two sets of roots are related by the duality @xmath28 .",
    "the two corresponding models are very different at the tree level .",
    "the explicit expansion of the mass - potential exponential term up to the fourth order for the @xmath22 model is @xmath29 for the @xmath23 model we utilize the tree level mass eigenstates by transforming the fields @xmath30 and obtain the expansion @xmath31 as one can see , the sets of possible fusings are completely different and duality is far from being obvious .",
    "the classical mass ratios are @xmath32 which agree with the general formula in terms of the coxeter number @xmath33 ( 6 for @xmath22 , 12 for @xmath23 ) @xmath34 the duality conjecture states that the correct quantum ratio @xmath22 is given by substituting @xmath35 in the model @xmath22 and @xmath36 in the @xmath23 model .",
    "the form of @xmath20 is constrained but not fixed by perturbation theory and the conjectured expression is @xmath37 let us clarify these statements by considering the one loop mass ratios .",
    "let us denote the three diagrams of figures ( i - ii - iii ) by @xmath38 where @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 are particle labels in the range @xmath43 .",
    "the mass ratio is observable since renormalization amounts to a normal ordering of the exponentials and its effect is a redefinition of the bare mass .",
    "we must check that in a bare renormalization scheme all the divergent tadpole graphs cancel .",
    "let us utilize dimensional regularization and let us introduce @xmath44 the pole part of @xmath45 is mass independent , hence the cancellation is a matter of couplings . at the one loop level the mixed propagator corrections are irrelevant and we can restrict to the diagonal ones .",
    "let us write the interaction lagrangian in the form @xmath46 then , the corrections to the propagator of particle 1 are @xmath47 the corrections to the propagator of particle 2 are obtained by exchanging the 1 and 2 labels .",
    "if we denote the full divergent correction by @xmath48 then the desired cancellation is equivalent to the condition @xmath49 which is indeed satisfied by the couplings of the two theories which can be read in the expansions of the previous section .",
    "besides the consistency check , let us turn to the mass ratio deformation . at one loop , we must determine the quantity @xmath50 let us introduce the finite integral @xmath51 then the finite contributions to the propagators of particle 1 are @xmath52 evaluation on the tree mass shell gives @xmath53 with analogous expressions for the particle 2 .",
    "we need only the following particular values @xmath54 and the final result is @xmath55 the renormalized coxeter number is thus @xmath56 and a consistent , simple and natural conjecture is @xmath57 where @xmath58 the result for @xmath22 is in agreement with that quoted by  @xcite .",
    "the result for @xmath23 gives perturbative support to the duality conjecture @xmath59 .",
    "we remark that the discrepancy with  @xcite is due to the fact that they use the form of @xmath60 which is correct for the simply laced models .",
    "the lattice action for the pair ( @xmath22 , @xmath23 ) expressed in terms of pure numbers is @xmath61 i have simulated the toda theory with the hybrid monte carlo algorithm ( see  @xcite for the details ) .",
    "let us consider the extended action @xmath62 the free parameter of the algorithm are @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "the first is the number of molecular dynamics steps .",
    "the second is the time step in the integration of the equations of motion @xmath65 the vacuum expectation value of the field is a non physical quantity .",
    "however , it is interesting to measure it since it is an indicator of thermalization and also because it is in a sense a dynamic minimum of the toda potential .",
    "mass ratios can be determined by studying the eigenvalues of the two point function @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the lattice time ranging from @xmath68 to @xmath18 and the wall field @xmath69 is obtained by averaging @xmath6 over space .",
    "i have used a @xmath70 lattice for all @xmath8s because the correlation lenght may be adjusted by varying @xmath7 .",
    "the continuum mass ratio is independent of the bare mass @xmath7 .",
    "however , on a finite lattice , it must be chosen in order to have correlation lenghts large with respect to one lattice spacing and small compared to the lattice size .",
    "this is the correct procedure which minimizes discretization and finite size corrections .",
    "thanks to the work of  @xcite i had good values in the case of the @xmath22 theory . in the other model ,",
    "i started with the same values of @xmath7 adjusting them for some @xmath8 .",
    "i utilized different measurement of the wall - wall two - point function for each bin in the separation @xmath71 .",
    "this is necessary in order to avoid strong correlation between data .",
    "table  [ table1 ] shows the hybrid monte carlo parameters which we found to be optimal for each couple @xmath72 .",
    "the time step @xmath64 must be reduced almost exponentially as @xmath8 is increased .",
    "this is reasonable since at larger @xmath8 the potential profile becomes steeper .",
    "table  [ table2 ] shows the measure of @xmath73 which can be useful as a check of the code and which is needed in order to subtract the two - point function .",
    "table  [ table3 ] shows the two lattice masses , their ratio and the conjectured prediction .",
    "finally , tables  [ table4 ] , [ table5 ] , [ table6 ] show the same results in the case of the @xmath23 model .",
    "figures i - ii - iii show the self energy diagrams which are needed in order to compute the one loop mass ratio deformations .",
    "figure iv shows a summary plot of the measured mass ratios in the two models together with the conjectured ones and the asymptotic values holding in the classical limit .",
    "in this paper i have investigated numerically the conjectured duality in the pair @xmath0 of non simply laced affine toda theories .",
    "i have shown that the @xmath8 dependence of the mass ratios in @xmath22 does follows the behaviour conjectured in  @xcite and that the data of @xmath23 agree with the @xmath59 duality .",
    "as in the case of more realistic field theories like qcd , the numerical approach could be useful in studying other interesting features of quantum toda theories .",
    "for instance , one could try to find direct evidence of the boundary bound states which appears when the theory is restricted to a half - line  @xcite ; work is in progress on this topic .",
    "moreover , it could be valuable a non perturbative study of the solitons which appear at imaginary @xmath8 , and which suggests that a unitary theory can ultimately be found by restricting the state space of the hamiltonian  @xcite ; their stability is indeed still questionable  @xcite .",
