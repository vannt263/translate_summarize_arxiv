    "supernova remnants ( snrs ) inject the predominant fraction of mechanical energy that heats and shapes the interstellar medium ( ism ) since the generated shock waves are responsible for the compression , acceleration and excitation of their surrounding medium . at the same time",
    "they replenish the ism with heavy elements formed during the evolution of massive stars while when immersed in molecular clouds the compression may trigger formation of the next generation of stars .",
    "snrs can yield significant information on the global properties of a galaxy s ism such as its density , temperature or composition ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , being the endpoints of core - collapse massive stars ( @xmath8 ) they can be used as proxies for measurements of massive star formation rate ( sfr ) and studies of stellar evolution @xcite .",
    "detecting large samples of snrs in a multi - wavelength context can provide several key aspects of the physical processes taking place during their evolution .",
    "for example , the blast waves of newly formed snrs can heat the material behind the shock front to temperatures up to @xmath9 k producing thermal x - rays .",
    "synchrotron radiation in radio wavelengths is produced at the vicinity of the shock as well as from the cooling regions behind the shock front , owing to relativistic electrons gyrating in the magnetic field of the snrs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "optical filaments are signs of older snrs since they form in the cooling regions behind the shock ( i.e. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) producing shock - heated collisionally ionized species ( such as [ s ii ] , [ o iii ]  or h@xmath0  recombination lines ) .",
    "therefore , multi - wavelength studies ( optical , radio , x - rays , infrared ) can surmount possible selection effects inherent in monochromatic samples of snrs and provide a more complete picture of their nature and evolution as well as their interplay with the ism and their correlation with star forming activity .",
    "about 274 snrs detected in different wavebands are known in our galaxy , a comprehensive catalogue of which is presented in @xcite .",
    "a large number of them has been studied in detail in various wavebands ( e.g. radio : @xcite ; optical : @xcite ; x - rays : @xcite ; infrared : @xcite ) providing significant information on the properties of individual objects and snr physics . however these studies are impeded by distance uncertainties and galactic absorption , hampering the investigation of snrs in a wide variety of environments . on the other hand",
    "extragalactic studies of snrs offer several advantages : they can be achieved in determined distances with much fewer observations while they cover a broader range of metallicities and ism parameters than our galaxy , giving us a more complete picture of the snr population parameters .",
    "numerous studies of extragalactic snrs have been conducted since the pioneering work of @xcite on the magellanic clouds .",
    "the availability of sensitive , high - resolution observations in the radio and x - ray bands have allowed the systematic investigation of extragalactic snrs in these wavebands ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , since the first studies in a small sample of nearby galaxies ( e.g. * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) there have not been any systematic pursuits of the optical populations of extragalactic snrs .",
    "the availability of sensitive wide - field imagers and spectrographs allow us to greatly extend these initial efforts to a larger set of galaxies , while probing fainter snrs populations .",
    "we have embarked in an extensive multi - wavelength investigation of the snr populations in six nearby galaxies ( ngc2403 , ngc3077 , ngc4214 , ngc4395 , ngc4449 and ngc5204 ) , involving optical and x - ray data .",
    "these galaxies are selected from the third catalog of bright galaxies ( rc3 ; @xcite ) to be ( a ) late type ( t @xmath1 4 ; hubble type ) , ( b ) close ( @xmath105 mpc ) in order to minimize source confusion , ( c ) at low inclination @xmath11 ) in order to minimize internal extinction and projection effects , and ( d ) be above the galactic plane ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "the properties of the galaxies in our sample are presented in table 1 while a list of previous multi - wavelength snr surveys are presented in  2 of @xcite .    from the pool of objects drawn from these selection criteria , we selected galaxies that have chandra archival data with exposure times long enough to achieve a uniform detection limit of @xmath13 erg s@xmath4 .",
    "we opted to focus on chandra data owing to its superior spatial resolution which allows the detection of faint sources in crowded environments and therefore can provide the most unbiased sample to be correlated with the optical data .",
    "this x - ray investigation revealed 37 thermal x - ray snrs ( based on their spectra or hardness ratio colours ) , 30 of which were new discoveries .",
    "in many cases , the x - ray classification was confirmed based on counterparts with snrs identified in other wavelengths .",
    "we found that x - ray selected snrs in irregular galaxies appear to be more luminous than those in spirals due to the lower metallicities and therefore more massive progenitor stars of irregular galaxies or the higher local densities of the interstellar medium .",
    "a comparison of the numbers of observed luminous x - ray - selected snrs with those expected based on the luminosity functions of x - ray snrs in the magellanic clouds and m33 suggested different luminosity distributions between the snrs in spiral and irregular galaxies with the latter tending to have flatter distributions .",
    "these results are presented in the first paper of this series ( @xcite , hereafter paper i ) .    in this paper",
    "we present a detailed optical spectro - photometric study of the snr populations in this sample of galaxies .",
    "the optical identification of snrs is based on the elevated [ s ii]/h@xmath0  ratio ( @xmath14 0.4 ) , pioneered by @xcite .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows : in  2 , we describe the observations , including data reduction and techniques used for source detection and photometry . in  3 , we describe the long - slit and multi - slit spectroscopic observations , while in  4 we give the snr classification criteria as well as aggregate results of the detected snrs in our sample of galaxies . in  5 we discuss the results of our spectro - photometric investigation",
    ". finally , in  6 we present the conclusions of this work .",
    "optical images were obtained with the 1.3 m ( f/7.7 ) ritchey  chrtien telescope at skinakas observatory on june 6 - 12 , 2008 and nov 16 - 18 , 2009 .",
    "a 2048 @xmath15 2048 andor tech ccd was used which has a @xmath16 field of view and an image scale of 0.28@xmath17 per pixel . apart from nov 18 2009 ,",
    "all the other observing nights were photometric with seeing conditions ranging between 1.3@xmath17 - 2.5@xmath17 .",
    "the observations were performed with the narrow band h@xmath0  + [ n ii ] , [ s ii ] and [ o iii ]  filters .",
    "broadband continuum filters in red and blue were used to subtract the continuum from the h@xmath0 + [ n ii ] , [ s ii ] and [ o iii ]  images respectively .",
    "the continuum filters used for the observations are centered on line - free regions of the spectra in order to avoid strong snr emission lines to pass .",
    "the interference filter characteristics are listed in table 2 .",
    "the exposure time was 3600 sec for each h@xmath0  + [ n ii ]  filter exposure , 7200 sec for each [ s ii ]  filter exposure and 300 sec for the exposures through the continuum filters .",
    "the airmass of the galaxies during observations ranged between 1.06 and 1.87 . in the case of ngc2403",
    ", the @xmath18 ccd field of view did not cover the whole d@xmath19 area is defined as the optical isophote at the b - band surface brightness of 25 mag arcsec@xmath20 area of the galaxy , therefore we obtained a 2@xmath152 mosaic .",
    "we did not observe ngc2403 and ngc4395 through [ o iii ]  or continuum blue filters owing to weather conditions .",
    "bias frames and well - exposed twilight flats were taken on each run as well as spectro - photometric standard stars from the list of @xcite .",
    "the data reduction was performed using the iraf v2.14 package .",
    "all images were bias - subtracted and flat - field corrected while the data sets of each filter for each galaxy were median - combined in order to reject the cosmic rays .",
    "star - free areas outside the body of the galaxies were selected in h@xmath0 + [ n ii ] , [ s ii ] , [ o iii ]  and continuum images in order to subtract the sky background and obtain just the light from each galaxy .",
    "the sky - background subtracted images were aligned to a reference image for each galaxy ( e.g. continuum red for h@xmath0 + [ n ii ]  and [ s ii ] , continuum blue for [ o iii ] ) and astrometrically calibrated using the usno - b1.0 catalog or sdss data release 7 . for each galaxy s h@xmath0 + [ n ii ] , [ s ii ]  and continuum red images , we selected an adequate number ( 8 - 10 ) of the same faint stars ( @xmath215 - 20 mag ) for which we calculated their ( h@xmath0 + [ n ii]/cont red ) and ( [ s ii]/cont red ) ratios . the mean value of those ratios were used to create normalized - continuum red images for h@xmath0 + [ n ii ]  and [ s ii ]  images , respectively .",
    "we then subtracted the corresponding normalized - continuum red images from the h@xmath0 + [ n ii ] , [ s ii ]  images in order to eliminate the star - light continuum .",
    "we did not follow the same procedure for the [ o iii ]  images since they were used only for visual examination of each source s [ o iii ]  emission",
    ". the continuum - subtracted h@xmath0  + [ n ii ]  and [ s ii ]  images were flux calibrated , using several spectrophotometric standard stars observed each night and reduced the same way as the galaxy images .",
    "we note that the used intereference h@xmath0",
    "+ [ n ii ]  filter includes the [ n ii ]  6548   and 6584   lines . in order to estimate the net h@xmath0  flux - calibrated images of our galaxies , we corrected for the [ n ii ]  contamination using the [ n ii](@xmath21 6548 , 6584)/h@xmath0  ratios from integrated spectroscopy of the galaxies from the work of @xcite .",
    "sources present considerably higher s / n in the h@xmath0  than in the [ s ii ]  images therefore we searched for sources in the continuum - subtracted , flux calibrated h@xmath0  data sets of each galaxy , using the sextractor v2.5.0 package @xcite .",
    "our goal is to identify faint nebulae in relatively isolated regions as well as to separate possible snrs from hii  or diffuse emission regions .",
    "since sextractor was used only for detection , the main parameters we adjusted are the following : a ) detection threshold set to 1.3 - 3.5 @xmath22 above background , b ) minimum number of pixels for a detection to be triggered between 3 to 7 for different galaxies , c ) a background mesh size of 6 - 10 pixels in order to detect faint sources and account for local variations of the background within the galaxies .",
    "all the above parameters were adjusted for each galaxy depending on its background and the detection efficiency of faint sources .",
    "the non - uniform h@xmath0  background and diffuse emission within the galaxies did not allow us to base the source detection solely on the sextractor output .",
    "for that reason , the results of the sextractor run for each of the continuum - subtracted , flux - calibrated h@xmath0  images were visually inspected in order to discard local maxima of h@xmath0  background or spurious sources associated with bad pixels , and then were used to create source lists . in the case of ngc2403 ,",
    "the fourth frame of the mosaic was observed at a non - photometric night ( november 18 , 2009 ) therefore we excluded it from the data analysis procedure .",
    "the source detection for ngc2403 was performed individually on each of the three frames of the galaxy mosaic .",
    "the detection results from each mosaic were then combined in order to form the final list of sources in ngc2403 .",
    "each source list was overlaid on the relevant continuum red image of each galaxy in order to eliminate any obvious star - like objects .",
    "since snrs are identified on the basis of strong [ s ii ]  emission , we visually inspected the significance of the sources on the relevant continuum - subtracted , flux - calibrated [ s ii ]  images .",
    "the final source list was defined on the basis of clear detection of sources in both h@xmath0  and [ s ii ]  images .",
    "we note that we opted to use the individual h@xmath0  and [ s ii ]  images ( rather than the [ s ii]/h@xmath0  ratio images ) for source detection since they tend to be less noisy .",
    "we used the _ apphot _ package in iraf in order to perform photometry of the sources identified on the continuum - subtracted , flux - calibrated h@xmath0  and [ s ii ]  images . in the case of ngc2403",
    ", we created a final list from each mosaic frame and performed photometry on each source in every frame that it was observed .",
    "the final photometric parameters for each source in ngc2403 were derived from the mean value of the parameters in each frame .",
    "we used source apertures with diameter set to 8 - 10 pixels ( which corresponds to @xmath22@xmath17 - 3@xmath17 ) and physical scales of @xmath232 to @xmath266 pc for the closest and most distant galaxy , respectively .",
    "these apertures were chosen to cover most of the source s flux in both the h@xmath0  and [ s ii ]  images ( taking into account the seeing conditions of 1.3@xmath17 - 2.5@xmath17 ) while taking care not to encompass other neighbouring sources or diffuse emission .",
    "the local background for each source was measured from appropriate annuli of typical sizes of 10 pixels ( @xmath23@xmath17 ) . in some special cases with highly non - uniform background",
    ", the local background was measured from a neighbouring region .",
    "we note that accurate photometry depends strongly on the selected background area , especially in cases of sources embedded in large filaments or regions with enhanced diffuse emission . from measurements for different background regions we find a typical uncertainty on the flux of 40% stemming from the background selection .",
    "this uncertainty is minimized in the case of [ s ii ]  images due to the very low background and the point - like nature of most sources .",
    "extinction correction was not applied on the h@xmath0 , [ s ii ]  fluxes since no h@xmath23  observations were obtained for the galaxies in our sample .",
    "we calculated variance maps by applying error propagation to the error map of the initial bias - subtracted , flat - fielded combined images ( including readout noise , gain etc ) . in this calculation we accounted for all the analysis steps taken from the derivation of the fluxed images ( continuum - subtraction , flux calibration ) .",
    "the h@xmath0  and [ s ii ]  flux errors were estimated by calculating the square root of the measured sum of the variance map within the aperture of each source .",
    "the [ s ii]/h@xmath0  ratio errors were calculated through standard error propagation .    based on the photometric properties of the detected sources , we calculated the [ s ii]/h@xmath0  flux ratio of the final source list in each galaxy . in order to further examine whether the correction we applied for the [ n ii ]  contamination ( based on the integrated [ n ii]/h@xmath0  ratios of @xcite ) in the flux - calibrated h@xmath0  images is appropriate and thus inspect the validity of the measured h@xmath0  fluxes and [ s ii]/h@xmath0  ratios , we used the spectroscopic [ n ii]/h@xmath0  ratios of our spectroscopically - observed snrs ( see  3 ) . from the histogram of the spectroscopic [ n ii]/h@xmath0  ratios of our snr sample ( fig .",
    "1 ) we see that they form two distinct loci : irregular galaxies ( apart from ngc3077 ) extend to lower [ n ii]/h@xmath0  ratios than spiral galaxies , probably owing to differences in their metallicities (  5.2 ) .",
    "this led us to redefine our [ n ii]/h@xmath0  correction factor to the median values of the snrs in ngc2403 + ngc3077 and the rest of the irregular galaxies and correct accordingly the h@xmath0  fluxes and [ s ii]/h@xmath0  ratios of the detected sources .",
    "distinct sources with strong emission in both continuum - subtracted , flux - calibrated h@xmath0  and [ s ii ]  images that present ( [ s ii]/h@xmath0)@xmath24 @xmath1 0.4 ( within their errorbars ) are considered photometric snrs .",
    "we also include sources with 0.3 @xmath25 ( [ s ii]/h@xmath0)@xmath24 @xmath25 0.4 which are well possible to belong to the snr regime since photometry can result in many cases to ambiguous [ s ii]/h@xmath0  ratios , especially for sources embedded in diffuse emission or near hii regions .",
    "in tables 3 - 8 we present the photometric properties of the photometric snrs in each galaxy while in table 9 ( available at the electronic version ) we present the photometric properties of all spectroscopically - observed sources which were not identified as snrs ( ( [ s ii]/h@xmath0)@xmath26 @xmath25 0.4 ) . in column 1",

    "we indicate whether there is available spectrum ( _ m _ and _ s _ for mayall and skinakas telescopes respectively ) and in column 11 their classification based on the criteria mentioned in  4 . in some cases of large filaments",
    "the imaging resulted in multiple detections .",
    "in these cases it is not possible to distinguish between a single or multiple snrs .",
    "these sources are indicated as lbzxx - y in the relevant tables .",

    "the slit was oriented in the north - south direction . since the faintness of our target nebulae makes the positioning of the slit a hard task , we positioned each slit on the required targets by offseting from a field star .",

    "as discussed in section 5.3.4 , a number of wind - blown bubbles may be misclassified as optical snrs ( @xmath210@xmath45 ) .",
    "these sources present mainly thermal radio emission instead of non - thermal synchrotron emission which is typically the case in snrs .",

    "the number of optical snrs exceed by far the number of x - ray or radio snrs .",
    "even if many photometric snrs ( mostly probable candidate snrs ) are not spectroscopically verified as such ( see  5.1 ) , the match rates will still remain low .",
    "the poor match rates between optical and x - ray / radio snrs have also been the case for various other multi - wavelength snr surveys ( e.g. @xcite for m33 , @xcite for five nearby galaxies ) .",
    "this effect could be the result of various factors .",
    "the sample of radio snrs is limited by the lack of deep radio surveys for half of our galaxies ( as also discussed by @xcite for m33 ) .",
    "sample issues aside , these differences could arise from physical effects since the detection rate of snrs in different wavebands strongly depends on the properties of the surrounding medium of the source .",
    "for example , @xcite point out that optical searches are more likely to detect snrs located in regions of low diffuse emission , while radio and x - ray searches are more likely to detect snrs in regions of high optical confusion .",
    "the same is pointed out by @xcite who find that confused environments in the optical , do not influence the detectability of the snrs in the x - ray band .",
    "furthermore , the trend of detecting more easily older snrs in the optical band gives rise to the large difference in the match rate between optical and x - ray snrs .",
    "all these facts could contribute to the large differences in match rates between optical , x - ray and radio snrs , and highlight the importance of multi - wavelength surveys for the study of extragalactic snr populations .",
    "six optically detected candidate snrs / probable candidate snrs ( lbz6 , lbz102 , lbz108 , lbz127 in ngc2403 ; lbz80 in ngc4214 and lbz60 in ngc4449 ) are associated with xrbs ( see tables 16 , 18 , 20 ) on the basis of their hard x - ray emission and high x - ray luminosities ( paper i ) .",
    "although these sources could be considered as plerionic snrs ( due to their hard x - ray spectra and their enhanced [ s ii]/h@xmath0  ratio ) , their x - ray luminosities ( @xmath210@xmath46 ) and their variability ( @xmath115@xmath45 between flux observations , see paper i ) place them in the regime of xrbs rather than this of plerions ( typical l@xmath47 @xmath210@xmath48 ; @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , one possible interpretation for these sources is that of an x - ray binary coincident with a snr , possibly associated with the supernova ( sn ) that produced the compact object in the binary . in this case",
    "the snr is responsible for the observed optical ( and radio emission ) while the binary system produces the x - ray emission .",
    "the x - ray luminosity of active xrbs ( 10@xmath7 erg s@xmath4 ) is higher than that of snrs ( typically 10@xmath48 - 10@xmath7 erg s@xmath4 ; @xcite ) and therefore they can overshadow the latter .",
    "the exemplar of this type of objects is the ss 433/w50 snr / xrb system ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) , while a few other candidates have been identified in other galaxies on the basis of hard and/or variable x - ray sources associated with optically or radio identified snrs ( @xcite ) .",
    "the photometric investigation of the detected sources in our sample of galaxies revealed 20 low - excitation sources ( ( [ s ii]/h@xmath0)@xmath49 0.3 ) which are not known optical snrs from other studies and are associated with known x - ray or radio snrs ( see tables 16 - 21 ) .",
    "there are two possibilities for the nature of these sources : a ) the snr is in its first evolutionary stages where the optical emission is considerably fainter than the x - ray / radio emission . in this case",
    "it is also possible that their expanded shock fronts form a precursor hii  region @xcite which gives the observed optical emission while the snrs produce the x - ray or radio emission , and b ) we observe snrs embedded in hii  regions . in that case",
    "the h@xmath0  emission we observe comes from the hii  region , which is enhanced in relation to that radiated from the snr , resulting to [ s ii]/h@xmath0  ratios below our 0.3 limit for the latter which nonetheless emits in the x - ray or radio band .",
    "follow - up spectroscopic observations will help us clarify the nature of these sources .",
    "these sources are considered as snr / hii  composite objects in this study .",
    "multiple supernovae and/or blown out stellar winds of massive stars in ob associations can create cavities of hot gas in the ism , known as wind blown bubbles ( bubbles or superbubbles ) .",
    "the shock - excited structure of these objects can grant them with moderate [ s ii]/h@xmath0  values ( @xmath10.45 ; @xcite , @xcite ) since the expansion velocities of their radiative shocks are too low to produce enhanced [ s ii]/h@xmath0  ratios ( e.g. @xcite ) or the uv radiation of the ob associations in a superbubble photoionizes sulfur to higher ionization stages which lead to weaker [ s ii]/h@xmath0  ratios ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "nonetheless there might be some superbubbles that have [ s ii]/h@xmath0  ratios within the range of snrs .",
    "the only way to identify these objects is to use their typically larger sizes and lower luminosities compared to snrs .",
    "superbubbles present large sizes ( @xmath1100 pc ) , which are rare among known snrs @xcite , and slower expansion velocities than those of snrs ( @xmath25100 km / sec ; e.g. @xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "their low - density environment is responsible for their rather faint x - ray emission ( below that of snrs : 10@xmath50 - 10@xmath51 erg s@xmath4 ; e.g. @xcite ) . in cases when a source with the above characteristics exhibits diffuse x - ray emission with luminosities similar to those of snrs and",
    "its h@xmath0  expansion velocity is high , then it is most probable that a superbubble encompasses a recently created snr @xcite .",
    "+ based on the above , we opted to investigate whether some of the snrs we identify based on their [ s ii]/h@xmath0  ratios need to be reclassified as superbubbles .",
    "since our low - resolution images do not allow us to reliably investigate for ob associations , and measurements for h@xmath0  expansion velocities of the objects are not yet available ( reduction of echelle spectra for @xmath230 large snrs with the 2.1 m telescope in spm , mexico are in progress ) , we relied solely on identifying snrs with large diameters ( @xmath180 pc ) .",
    "the physical size of the sources was estimated by subtracting in quadrature the seeing in each exposure ( typically 1.3@xmath17 - 2.5@xmath17 ) from the aperture used to perform the source photometry .",
    "the latter was defined including most of a source s flux , while avoiding any neighbouring sources and minimizing the encompassed diffuse emission . following this approach we set the following limits in order to reject a source as a possible wind - blown bubble : @xmath428 pixels for ngc2403 ( which corresponds to @xmath522.24@xmath17 and physical scale of @xmath5275 pc in diameter ) , @xmath426 pixels for ngc5204 ( @xmath521.68@xmath17 , @xmath5290pc diameter ) , @xmath4212 pixels for ngc4395 ( @xmath523.36@xmath17 , @xmath5290pc diameter ) , @xmath427 pixels for ngc4449 ( @xmath521.96@xmath17 , @xmath5290 pc diameter ) , @xmath428 pixels for ngc3077 ( @xmath522.24@xmath17 , @xmath5285pc diameter ) and @xmath42 6 pixels for ngc4214 ( @xmath521.68@xmath17 , @xmath5290 pc diameter ) .",
    "we find 51 ( 39 in ngc2403 , 2 in ngc5204 and 10 in ngc4214 ) that fulfill the above criteria .",
    "four of these sources are also x - ray selected snrs based on their x - ray colors and/or their soft spectra ( see tables 3 - 8 and paper i ) .",
    "the large sizes of these objects in combination with their relatively high x - ray luminosities which is typical of snrs , suggest the existence of a snr inside a superbubble .",
    "three more sources present x - ray properties consistent with those of xrbs , with even larger x - ray luminosities . therefore ,",
    "if we remove these seven sources from the 51 initially selected ones , we result to 44 possibly misclassified superbubbles as snrs which constitute @xmath210@xmath45 of our optical snr sample .",
    "this percentage is expected to be somewhat larger if we take into account the lack of expansion velocity measurements which can give us a reliable discrimination between snrs and wind - blown bubbles .",
    "+ we note that the estimation of the sizes described above was based on the h@xmath0  morphology of the sources , rather than the [ s ii ]  morphology which traces better the higher excitation part of the nebula associated with the shock - blown bubble .",
    "this choice was driven by the much higher s / n of the h@xmath0  images , but has the tendency to overestimate the size of the snrs or bubbles .",
    "therefore , the estimated sizes are an upper bound on the true size of the shock - blown bubbles .",
    "furthermore , the majority of these sources present [ s ii]/h@xmath0  ratios within the secure range of snrs ( @xmath10.5 ) , and x - ray luminosities much higher than the typical luminosities of superbubbles",
    ". based on these two facts we expect that the majority of these 44 objects are bona - fide snrs and for this reason we do not exclude them from our analysis . however , we do indicate them as possible superbubbles in tables 3 - 8 .",
    "mining for optical snrs within the six nearby galaxies of our sample revealed 18 sources ( snrs / candidate snrs / probable candidate snrs ) that are associated with x - ray selected snrs from paper i. in order to investigate the relation between the optical and x - ray properties of these sources and examine whether the optical properties of snrs are good predictors of x - ray snrs , we calculated their h@xmath0  luminosity and correlated it with their x - ray luminosity derived in paper i. the h@xmath0  luminosities were calculated based on the non - extinction corrected photometric fluxes f(h@xmath0 ) in tables 3 - 8 and the distances from table 1 .",
    "we used the photometric f(h@xmath0 ) instead of the spectroscopic ones since we did not have spectra for all 18 sources .",
    "two x - ray snrs ( candidate snrs , see paper i ) were excluded from the sample since because of their small number of counts we could not extract spectra and calculate accurate fluxes ( their identification was based on their x - ray colours ) .    in fig .",
    "14 we plot the h@xmath0  luminosity against the non extinction - corrected x - ray luminosity of the 16 optically selected , x - ray emitting snrs .",
    "different colours in the plot indicate snrs of different galaxies while the dashed line indicates the 1:1 relation between the two luminosities .",
    "the majority of snrs tend to have higher h@xmath0  than x - ray luminosities while the most luminous x - ray snrs typical present the highest optical luminosities .",
    "however , we do not find a correlation at a statistically significant level ( linear correlation coefficient:-0.12 ) .",
    "the variation of the ratio of x - ray - to - optical luminosities indicates the existence of different materials in a wide range of temperatures : the x - ray emission originates from hot material behind the shock front ( plasma temperature of @xmath210@xmath53 k ) and long cooling timescales ( typical values of a few hundreds of kyr ) while the h@xmath0  emission comes from cooling regions ( plasma temperatures of @xmath210@xmath54 k ) of dense recombining gas around the edges of the remnant and short cooling timescales ( up to a few hundred years ) . with the same rationale we can interpret the lack of a significant correlation between the [ s ii]/h@xmath0  ratios of the 16 optically selected , x - ray emitting snrs and their x - ray luminosities ( fig .",
    "in a sample model one would expect that stronger shocks ( higher [ s ii]/h@xmath0  ratios ) would correlate with higher l@xmath47 .",
    "however , because of the long - cooling time of the x - ray material the shock - velocity we are measuring does not necessarily correspond to the shock that generated the bulk of the x - ray emission material .      in order to investigate the optical properties of snrs in different star - forming environments and derive safe conclusions on their connection with sfr",
    ", we need primarily to examine to what luminosity limit our sample of snrs is complete .",
    "for that reason we plot the luminosity distributions of photometric snrs in each galaxy ( fig 16 ) .",
    "previous studies in extragalactic snrs showed that these populations are distributed in the form of power laws ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "therefore , the turnover in histograms of h@xmath0  luminosities indicates the effect of incompleteness for each galaxy s snr population .",
    "three galaxies in our sample ( ngc3077 , ngc4214 and ngc5204 ) present the same limiting luminosity of 1.6@xmath1510@xmath7 erg s@xmath4 while for ngc2403 is 3.2@xmath1510@xmath7 erg s@xmath4 , for ngc4395 is 4@xmath1510@xmath51 erg s@xmath4 and for ngc4449 is 2@xmath1510@xmath7 erg s@xmath4 .    all galaxies in our sample have accurate measurements of their integrated h@xmath0  luminosity @xcite , so we opted to use this as an sfr proxy . for consistency ,",
    "we rederived the luminosities from @xcite based on the distances in table 1 .",
    "no corrections for extinction internal to the galaxies themselves has been applied .    since core - collapse sne are the end points of the evolution of the most massive stars , their snrs are good indicators of the current sfr .",
    "this work combining multi - wavelength samples of snrs which are often not overlaping , provides an excellent census of the snr populations in diferent galaxies .",
    "therefore , we would expect a linear relation between the number of opically - selected snrs and sfr ( e.g. , @xcite ) . to verify this connection",
    ", we plot the number of photometric snrs ( tables 3 - 8 ) above the completeness limit of each galaxy in our sample ( see fig .",
    "16 ) against the integrated h@xmath0  luminosity of each galaxy ( fig .",
    "17 , top ) .",
    "we find a linear relation between them but the small number of objects does not allow us to quantify their scaling relation .",
    "however , a linear correlation coefficient of 0.87 for the photometric snrs shows that this is a significant correlation .",
    "the non - thermal radio emission is another indicator of the sn rate and hence high - mass star formation ( e.g. , @xcite ) since it comes from electrons in the magnetic field of the galaxies which are produced and accelerated in snrs .",
    "therefore , the radio emission should be correlated with the number of snrs and sfr .",
    "we investigate the relation between the 1.4 ghz radio emission of the galaxies in our sample and the detected number of photometric snrs ( fig .",
    "17 , bottom ) .",
    "we use integrated radio fluxes from @xcite and we find a correlation coefficient of 0.59 . however , if we remove ngc4449 which seems to drive out the correlation we find a linear correlation coefficient of 0.86 . the weaker correlation between the number of snrs and the radio 1.4 ghz luminosity could be due to a significant contribution of thermal radio emission to the 1.4 ghz luminosity .",
    "in this paper we presented a systematic spectrophotometric study of optically emitting snrs in a sample of six nearby galaxies .",
    "the snrs are initially selected on the basis of their [ s ii]/h@xmath0@xmath420.4 ratio revealing a total number of @xmath2400 photometric snrs ( including sources with 0.3@xmath25([s ii]/h@xmath0)@xmath310.4 ) .",
    "spectroscopic observations verified the nature of 67 shock - excited sources .",
    "23 optical snrs in this study are also detected in other wavebands . from the analysis of the sample we find that @xmath24@xmath45 and @xmath22@xmath45 of the optically selected snrs have x - ray and radio counterparts respectively .",
    "the overlap between x - ray and radio classifications is 35@xmath45 .",
    "this little overlap between detection rates in different wavelengths could be either due to environmental effects ( e.g. the properties of the surrounding medium which strongly affect the detection rates ) or selection effects ( such as the poor sensitivity of the existing radio surveys and /or the poor sensitivity of optical surveys in regions with strong star - formation and hence significant h@xmath0  emission ) and the different evolutionary stages in the life of a remnant .",
    "+ six sources identified as optically - selected snrs in this study exhibit x - ray properties more consistent with xrbs .",
    "we propose that these sources are x - ray binaries coincident with an snr .",
    "+ the present study revealed 20 snr / hii  sources ( based on their narrow - band photometry ) that are associated with known x - ray or radio snrs .",
    "two possible interpretations are of young sources that have not entered the phase of their optical radiation or of sources embedded in hii  regions where the snr produces the x - ray / radio emission and the hii  region outshadows the shock - excited optical gas to be detected .",
    "+ there is a trend for irregular galaxies to have lower [ n ii]/h@xmath0  ratios .",
    "this is due to the lower metallicities of these galaxies since [ n ii]/h@xmath0  is a very sensitive metallicity indicator ( more than [ s ii]/h@xmath0 ) mainly due to its secondary nucleosynthesis . + for the optically - emitting snrs with x - ray counterparts , we do not see a correlation between their h@xmath0  and x - ray luminosities , which is due to the presence of material in a wide range of temperatures .",
    "additionally , we do not find any trend between the x - ray luminosity of snrs and their [ s ii]/h@xmath0  ratios .",
    "+ we find evidence for a linear relation between the number of luminous optical snrs ( @xmath210@xmath7 erg s@xmath4 ) and sfr in our sample of galaxies .",

    "<S> we present results from a study of optically emitting supernova remnants ( snrs ) in six nearby galaxies ( ngc2403 , ngc3077 , ngc4214 , ngc4395 , ngc4449 and ngc5204 ) based on deep narrow band h@xmath0  and [ s ii ]  images as well as spectroscopic observations . </S>",
    "<S> the snr classification was based on the detected sources that fulfill the well - established emission line flux criterion of [ s ii]/h@xmath0@xmath1 0.4 . </S>",
    "<S> this study revealed @xmath2400 photometric snrs down to a limiting h@xmath0  flux of 10@xmath3 erg sec@xmath4 @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> spectroscopic observations confirmed the shock - excited nature of 56 out of the 96 sources with ( [ s ii]/h@xmath0)@xmath6 0.3 ( our limit for an snr classification ) for which we obtained spectra . </S>",
    "<S> 11 more sources were spectroscopically identified as snrs although their photometric [ s ii]/h@xmath0  ratio was below 0.3 . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the properties of the optically - detected snrs in our sample for different types of galaxies and hence different environments , in order to address their connection with the surrounding interstellar medium . </S>",
    "<S> we find that there is a difference in [ n ii]/h@xmath0  line ratios of the snr populations between different types of galaxies which indicates that this happens due to metallicity </S>",
    "<S> . we cross - correlate parameters of the optically detected snrs ( [ s ii]/h@xmath0  ratio , luminosity ) with parameters of coincident x- ray emitting snrs , resulted from our previous studies in the same sample of galaxies , in order to understand their evolution and investigate possible selection effects . </S>",
    "<S> we do not find a correlation between their h@xmath0  and x - ray luminosities , which we attribute to the presence of material in a wide range of temperatures . </S>",
