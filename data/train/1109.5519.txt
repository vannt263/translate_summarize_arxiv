    "increased ac losses in the mixed state  @xcite and the second harmonic generation  @xcite were observed in swept dc fields .",
    "sweeping of a dc field induces dc current in the sample that changes both components of the ac response , while the dc current , which also could exist in the sample due to pinning forces , can change only the penetration depth  @xcite , but does not increase the ac absorption .",
    "it was found that both real , @xmath0 , and imaginary , @xmath1 , components of the susceptibility depend on the dimensionless parameter @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is an ac amplitude , @xmath4 is the frequency , @xmath5 is the external dc field , and @xmath6 is the sweep rate  @xcite .",
    "several models were discussed in the literature . a bulk dissipation mechanism associated with flux - flow or flux - creep , was considered and was found inadequate @xcite , because the loss component @xmath1 actually does not depend on the dc field for @xmath7 .",
    "the phenomenological switching model  @xcite supposes that if @xmath8 the instantaneous time rate of the field changes its sign for a fraction of each ac period . during this interval",
    "the vortices become pinned and the sample is lossless  @xcite . during the remainder of the period",
    "the loss mechanism should operate .",
    "the sample is switched back and forth from the dissipative state to the non - dissipative state and the resistivity reaches some average value .",
    "the difficulty with this model is the lack of losses in the mixed state in constant dc fields  @xcite , and it is not clear which resistivity has to be averaged .",
    "the effect of the swept dc field on the ac response was discovered a long time ago , but up to now there are few measurements of the ac conductivity in this case .",
    "our experiments with bulk samples  @xcite showed that in the swept dc field the conductivity of the sample could not be characterized by a single value and one has to consider the conductivity that depends on the distance from the sample surface .",
    "interpretation of these experimental data is complicated by the inhomogeneity of the ac electric field .",
    "the amplitude of the ac electric field is decreased inside the sample and the response of a bulk sample is then some average value . to overcome these difficulties we have to simplify the problem .",
    "experiments with thin films can provide this simplification . for a thin film , which forms the wall of a hollow cylinder with actually arbitrary shape of a cross section , in longitudinal ac magnetic field the electric field in the film is homogeneous with accuracy @xmath9 , d is a film thickness and",
    "@xmath10 is the some macroscopic length .",
    "this permits us to introduce the averaged over the thickness conductivity @xmath11 of the film and to measure this quantity . for a long sample",
    "the screening currents in the walls circulate only in the plane which is perpendicular to the rectangular like cylinder axis and , consequently , both the electric field and current are constant along this contour .",
    "in this paper we report the experimental results measurements of the ac conductivity of a nb polycrystalline thin film in a swept dc field applied parallel to the surface .",
    "the film was deposited on the four sides of the parallelepiped sapphire substrate .",
    "we show that in the mixed state the dc field generates vortices at the surface , which cross the film and form the observed ac response .",
    "numerical simulations qualitatively describe the experimental data below @xmath12 , and make clearer the physical picture . due to the sweeping of dc magnetic field",
    "the vortices in the sample are always at the threshold of the depinning . only during part of an ac period vortices",
    "are depinned and provide the penetration of the ac field through the film .",
    "these results are reminiscent the assumption of the switching model  @xcite , but our simulations indicate that the pinned - depinned transition does not take place when the time derivative of the external magnetic field changes its sign .",
    "we also find that increasing the ac amplitude only slightly increases the vortex flow across the film .",
    "the ratio of the vortex number , which crosses the film , to the ac amplitude characterizes the observed magnetic susceptibility , increasing of @xmath3 increases shielding and decreases losses as is observed in the experiment . for @xmath13",
