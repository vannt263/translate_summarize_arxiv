    "at the present time , there are some efforts to explain the observations for the accelerated expansion of the universe , based on the dynamics of a scalar ( quintessence ) or multiscalar field ( quintom ) as models for dark energy , ( see the review @xcite ) .",
    "the properties of the quintom models have been studied from different points of view . among them , the phase space studies , using the dynamical systems tools , are very useful in order to analyze the qualitative and asymptotic behavior of the model @xcite ) . in the present work we want to investigate the case of quintom cosmology constructed by using both quintessence ( @xmath0 ) and phantom ( @xmath1 ) fields , maintaining a nonspecific potential @xmath2 from the begining . in the literature one special class of potential used",
    "is the sum of the exponential potentials for each field @xcite .",
    "there are other works where other type of potentials are analyzed @xcite .",
    "we claim that the analysis of general potentials using dynamical systems was made considering particular structures of them , in other words , how can we introduce this mathematical structure within a physical context ?",
    "we can partially answer this question , when the amplitude - real - phase formalism is introduced , in the sense that , some potentials can be constructed @xcite .",
    "this work is arranged as follows . in section [ model ]",
    "we present the corresponding einstein - klein - gordon equation for the quintom model .",
    "also we introduced the hamiltonian apparatus which is applied to frw cosmological model in order to construct a master equation for barotropic perfect fluid and cosmological constant .",
    "furthermore , we present the classical equations for the flat frw , which are presented in section [ hamil ] for particular scalar potentials .",
    "in subsection [ qap ] we present the quantum scheme , where we will use the amplitude - real - phase ansatz in order to solve the wdw equation .",
    "this method was used by moncrief and ryan @xcite to obtain exact solutions for the bianchi type ix anisotropic cosmological model with a wavefunction of the form @xmath3 .",
    "this form of the wavefunction was motivated by the work of kodama @xcite .",
    "our treatment is applied to build the mathematical structure of quintom scalar potentials which allow us obtain exact solutions together with an arbitrary factorization of the wdw equation . in this work",
    "we have obtain the wave function of the universe in order to find the quantum potentials , which is a more important matter in order to find the classical trajectories , which is shown in section [ hamil ] , that is devoted to obtain the classical solutions for particular scalar potentials , also we show graphically the classical trajectory in the configuration space @xmath4 projected from its quantum counterpart . in this same section ,",
    "we present the time dependence for the @xmath5 , and quintom scalar fields ( @xmath6 ) for the potentials treated in this section . in section [ remarks ]",
    "is devoted to final remarks of this work .",
    "we begin with the construction of the quintom cosmological theory , which requires the simultaneous consideration of two fields , namely , a canonical one @xmath0 , and phantom one @xmath1 ( see equation ( [ densidad ] ) below and reference @xcite ) .",
    "the lagrangian density of this theory with two fields , the cosmological term , and matter contribution , is    @xmath7    the corresponding field equations for perfect fluid matter content are @xmath8 here @xmath9 is the energy density , p the pressure , and @xmath10 the velocity of the fluid , satisfying that @xmath11 .    let us recall here the canonical formulation in the adm formalism for flat frw cosmological model .",

    "@xmath19 writing ( [ lagra - i ] ) in the canonical form , @xmath20 and substituting the energy density of the barotropic fluid @xmath21 , which was found using the covariant derivative of the energy - momentum tensor ( [ energy - momentum ] ) , @xmath22 where @xmath23 is an integration constant .",

    "additionally we can introduce the total quintom energy density and pressure as : @xmath35 where @xmath36    for phenomenological analysis , ( [ baro ] ) will serve us as a test for the viable class of quintom potentials whose equation of state can cross the cosmological constant barrier which @xmath37 is mildly favored of observations @xcite . for instance , when @xmath38 and @xmath39 , then the kinetic terms satisfies @xmath40 , so , the barotropic parameter @xmath41 . in this case , the intensity of the phantom field @xmath42 always is larger than the intensity of the quintessence field @xmath43 .",
    "in other case , we have that @xmath44 .",
    "the particular value equivalent to cosmological constant is when the kinetic terms are null or equal in both fields .    for constant potential ,",

    "for one scalar field , with constant potential , the formalism is like the one formulated by sez and ballester in 1986 , because both field are equivalent , see equations ( [ da - varsigma],[da - varphi ] ) @xcite .",
    "this formalism was studied by one of the author and collaborators , in the frw and bianchi type class a cosmological models , @xcite .",
    "the wheeler - dewitt equation for this model is obtained introducing the representation ( we choose @xmath51 ) @xmath52 into ( [ hami - i ] ) . the factor @xmath53",
    "can be ordered with the momenta @xmath54 in many ways .",
    "hartle and hawking @xcite have suggested a semi - general factor ordering for @xmath55 as @xmath56 where q is any real constant that measure the ambiguity in the factor ordering in the variable @xmath5 . in the following",
    "we will assume this factor ordering for the wheeler - dewitt equation , which becomes @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the dalambertian in the field coordinates @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "some time ago , moncrief and ryan tried successfully amplitude - real - phase ansatz in order to solve the wdw equation to obtain exact solutions for the bianchi type ix anisotropic cosmological model .",
    "this ansatz was motivated by the remarks of kodama @xcite on the relation between the adm wavefunction and the ashtekar wavefunction .",
    "this ansatz is as follows @xmath61 where @xmath62 is known as the superpotential function , w is like probability amplitude in the bohm formalism @xcite .",
    "then , the wdw equation ( [ wdwmod ] ) is written as @xmath63\\right\\ } = 0 , \\label { mod}\\ ] ] with @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , where @xmath67 , and @xmath68 is the potential term .",
    "the last equation is a difficult one to solve , in view of which we propose to factorize as below and set each factor to zero , obtaining simpler set of equations ,    [ wdwa ] @xmath69    we follow the approach presented in the references @xcite for solving these set of partial differential equations in order to obtain particular solutions to de wdw equation .",
    "we solve initially the einstein - hamilton - jacobi ( ehj ) equation ( [ hj ] ) , next we introduce the superpotential function s into equation ( [ wdwho ] ) in order to solve for the w function , and finally , these solutions must satisfy the quantum potential equation ( [ cons ] ) , that appears as a quantum constraint in our approach .",
    "to solve hamilton - jacobi equation ( [ hj ] ) @xmath70 we propose that the superpotential function has the following form @xmath71 and substituting into ( [ hj ] ) , @xmath72=0 , \\label{ecuacion}\\ ] ] in order to solve by separation of variables , this equation imply the foolowing structure for the potential @xmath73 , \\label{potenti - u}\\ ] ] where @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 are generic functions on their arguments , which will be determined under this process , and @xmath78 , @xmath79 are constants .",

    "so , the quantum solutions for each potential are presented in quadrature form , using the equations ( [ ans ] , [ sp ] ) and ( [ ww ] ) .",
    "for our study , we shall make use of a semi - classical approximation to extract the dynamics of the wdw equation .",
    "the semi - classical limit of the wdw equation is achieved by taking @xmath98 , and imposing the usual wkb conditions on the superpotential function s , namely @xmath99    hence , the wdw equation , under the particular factor ordering q = 0 , becomes exactly the afore - mentioned ehj equation ( [ hj ] ) ( this approximation is equivalent to a zero quantum potential in the bohmian interpretation of quantum cosmology @xcite ) .",
    "the ehj equation is also obtained if we introduce the following transformation on the canonical momenta @xmath100 in eq .",

    ", one should consider theories where the interactions between phantom field and normal matter are as weak as possible , but we must allow the ghosts to interact gravitationally , since it is their gravitational interactions which are needed for them to have any cosmological consequences .",
