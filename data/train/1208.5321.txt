    "<S> * abstract : localized surface plasmon resonances have recently attracted considerable attention due to their ability to dramatically enhance near - field optical intensities and boost nanoscale light - matter interactions . here </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate unambiguously that polyhedral silver nanoparticles can be tailored to promote enhanced coherent emission from organic dye dispersions in a cavity . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we observe that nanoparticles supporting resonances close to the absorption peak of the dye yield to more efficient lasing , up to one order of magnitude , which is also evidenced by the narrowing of the emission spectral line down to 3 nm . </S>",
    "<S> moreover we observe emission saturation and energy dependent spectral shifts associated with kerr effects , which demonstrate the general relevance of non - resonant nonlinearities in plasmonic enhanced laser emissions . </S>",
    "<S> works in this area will contribute to the design of novel kind of laser sources providing ultra - short pulsed operation and structural tunability . </S>",
    "<S> * +    understanding the fundamental light - matter interactions at a scale much smaller than the wavelength is pivotal to any effort to reliably engineer laser emission . </S>",
    "<S> this relies on controlling frequency and bandwidth @xcite , to ultimately design ultra - short laser pulses . </S>",
    "<S> localized surface plasmons ( lsp ) can be optically excited and are associated with sustained oscillations of free electrons localized at the metal / dielectric interface . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite lsp oscillations are coherent and accumulate energy from the external excitation . </S>",
    "<S> + these lsp can be tuned with the size and the shape of metallic structures which can be fabricated through a wide range of approaches including lithography and wet - chemistry.@xcite such nanometer scale sources of intense coherent electromagnetic fields can enhance inherently weak physical processes , such as fluorescence and raman scattering of single molecules with potential applications ranging from biomedicine to lithography , and from microscopy to information technology.@xcite            another important potential of lsps lies in triggering coherent light emission amplified by plasmonic resonances . </S>",
    "<S> coupling between a dye and the lsp can occur when the photoluminescence spectrum of the semiconductor overlaps with the lsp resonance . beyond a specific pump threshold , a resonant energy transfer between the dye and the lsp can support lasing @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> examples of such systems are spasers made of metal nano - particles embedded in a gain medium , @xcite plasmonic lasers and nano - cavities , @xcite random lasers with metallic scatterers . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite despite this cumulative effort in the field , the experimental demonstration of spasers available in the literature are still very limited . </S>",
    "<S> there is thus an opportunity to gain insight into the dynamics of surface plasmons supported lasing even in very simple systems . </S>",
    "<S> this in turn offers the possibility to investigate more complex lasing regimes , for example at pump energies that trigger higher order nonlinear effects . </S>",
    "<S> + here we report on the lasing from systems based on polyhedral silver nanoparticles ( nps ) , with plasmonic response determined by their shape and polydispersity . </S>",
    "<S> we show that a liquid dye solution in a parallelepiped cell acts as a laser once the metallic nps with tailored plasmonic resonance are added : the system is hence a standard fabry - perot laser cavity , made by the facets of the cell and the gain is the dye solution , whose fluorescence is enhanced by the plasmonic resonances @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the lasing efficiency is strongly dependent on the resonance wavelength : the closer the resonance peak to the dye absorption maximum , the more efficient the process . </S>",
    "<S> lasing is clearly demonstrated by the strong increase of the emitted radiation intensity and by the spectral narrowing through pump threshold . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we show that the lasing process evidenced by fabry - perot resonances of the cavity , gain saturation and non - resonant nonlinearities indicate that coherent emission can be observed in very dilute transparent samples , in contrast with random lasing , @xcite relying on the multiple scattering of light involving several particles in a volume . </S>",
    "<S> + of interest for both fundamental and applied sciences and applications , the synthesis of nps has been associated with intense activities dedicated to further control the size and the shape of nanometer size colloids , soluble in a wide range of solvents . </S>",
    "<S> metal nps are subject to a wide range of investigations including optoelectronic devices , @xcite sensing , @xcite catalysis , and plasmonics @xcite to name but a few . in this work , </S>",
    "<S> the silver np syntheses were carried out under ambient conditions according to modified protocols reported in the literature . </S>",
    "<S> silver nitrate ( agno@xmath0 , 99.0% acs grade ) , trisodium citrate ( c@xmath1h@xmath2o@xmath3na@xmath0.2h@xmath4o , 99% acs grade ) , sodium borohydride ( nabh@xmath5 , 99% reagentplus ) , polyvinylpyrrolidone ( pvp , m@xmath6 55 kd ) , l - arginine ( c@xmath1n@xmath5h@xmath7o@xmath4 , 98% reagent grade ) were purchased from sigma - aldrich and used without further purification . for a typical preparation of spherical silver nps , @xcite silver nitrate solution ( 200  @xmath8l , 100  mm ) </S>",
    "<S> was diluted in di - water , the citrate solution ( 160  @xmath8l , 400  mm ) was then added to act as a stabilizer for the nps . under vigorous </S>",
    "<S> stirring , a sodium borohydride solution ( 300  @xmath8l , 150  mm ) was added drop - wise , initially leading to a black solution quickly turning into a yellow - brown solution . </S>",
    "<S> if stirring is stopped before the ageing is completed then part of the nps falls out of solution . to address this effect and to obtain very stable colloidal solutions , the syntheses were left under stirring to age for at least 24 hrs . </S>",
    "<S> the total volume of the nps solution was set to 20 ml but can easily be scaled up . </S>",
    "<S> photoreduction has become a popular pathway to produce nps of controlled shape including prism , disc and decahedral nps . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite starting from small spherical nps , varied light exposure conditions allow the preparation of nps with tunable decahedron and prism populations . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite in a typical synthesis , citrate solution ( 127  @xmath8l , 250  mm ) , pvp ( 19  @xmath8l , 50  mm ) , l - arginine ( 16  @xmath8l , 20  mm ) and silver nitrate solution ( 25  @xmath8l , 50  mm ) are successively mixed into di - water . </S>",
    "<S> sodium borohydride solution ( 102  @xmath8l , 100  mm ) is swiftly injected leading a yellow pale solution which was exposed to light sources . </S>",
    "<S> the exposure conditions varied from 24 h to 2 weeks , and from monochromatic to white lights . </S>",
    "<S> extraction by ultra - centrifugation was used to purify the as - prepared nps solutions . </S>",
    "<S> transmission electron microscopy ( tem ) images were recorded using a gatan ccd camera on a jeol jem-2011 electron microscope operating at 200 kv . </S>",
    "<S> rhodamine b and the nps aqueous solutions were mixed with the final dye concentration set to 1  mm for all the samples . </S>",
    "<S> a fraction of the resulting solutions were transferred in parallelepiped quartz cuvettes cells with a 1  mm optical path , with the water solution acting as gain medium once the system is pumped . </S>",
    "<S> a coherent surelite q - switched frequency doubled nd : yag laser at wavelength @xmath9=532  nm ( repetition rate 10  hz , pulse duration 6 ns and with 8 mm beam waist ) was used for optical pumping . for each sample , </S>",
    "<S> the laser was focused down to a spot of 1 mm lateral dimension . </S>",
    "<S> the emitted radiation was collected from the input face , after focalization into an optical fiber connected to a horiba microhr spectrograph equipped with symphony electrically cooled ccd array detector , with gratings density of 600  mm@xmath10 and 1800  mm@xmath10 , for low and high resolution spectra respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the exposure time was set to @xmath11  s and each spectrum results from the average of 10 pump shots .        </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig1]a presents a selection of the samples used in this work . </S>",
    "<S> the different colors correspond to nps with varied polyhedral morphologies , obtained by tuning the synthetic parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the transmission electron microscopy ( tem ) images of two examples are shown in figure [ fig1]b - c , for decahedral and prismatic shapes , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the detailed population diagrams are presented in the supporting information , for the lasing experiments we focused mainly on the most representative samples sa , sb and sc .        </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig2 ] shows the measured laser emission from these samples : by increasing the input pump energy the fluorescence spectrum of rhodamine - b displays a pronounced peak that progressively becomes sharper and more intense , as reported in the panel a and b for samples sa with ellipsoidal nps and sc with anisotropic and polyhedral nps , respectively . in the same graphs the pure dye emission at much higher energy ( 2.5 mj ) </S>",
    "<S> is depicted showing that without nps no lasing occurred ( until being exposed to at least 4.5 mj , not shown ) . </S>",
    "<S> this evidences clearly that lasing is provoked by the enhancement of dye fluorescence by the lsp resonances of the metallic colloids . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig2]c - d presents the spectral width and the relative intensity of the emission as a function of the pump energy , unveiling the transition to a coherent emission . </S>",
    "<S> these results show that different samples have different lasing efficiency as evidenced by the spectral narrowing and by the saturation of the emission in sc , corresponding to a trend of the peak intensity deviating from a straight line as shown in figure [ fig2]d . </S>",
    "<S> + to understand the reason of such dependency we report in figure [ fig3]a the linewidth vs. pump energy for samples sa ( spheres ) , sb , sc and pure rhodamine solution , with a line - width of @xmath123 nm for the polyhedrals and @xmath1210 nm for the spheres . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the control pure rhodamine solution has a line width around @xmath1230 nm , in the same range of pump energy . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig3]b shows the normalized absorption spectra of the plasmonic samples together and the pure dye . </S>",
    "<S> the resonance located around 400 nm is characteristic of spherical silver nps and presents little variation with the size of the nps . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite however , lower energy resonances are associated with silver nps of a varied aspect ratios and dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the data demonstrate that samples with plasmonic resonance wavelength close to the dye absorption peak are more efficient lasers as the emission line is narrower . </S>",
    "<S> the different observed efficiency can not be ascribed to the nps concentration , being the concentration of the samples : [ sa ] = 17 nm , [ sb ] = 250 nm and [ sc ] = 14 nm . </S>",
    "<S> the low concentrations also evidence that the reported lasers are not random lasers , because the systems are totally transparent and there is no multiple light scattering .    to gain further insight into the spectral emission we show in figure [ fig4]a and figure [ fig4]b the high resolution emission spectra of the samples respectively with polyhedral nps ( sb and sc ) and with spherical nps ( sa ) , for pump energy of 1  mj . </S>",
    "<S> the results require further analysis . </S>",
    "<S> we associate the emission spectra with the lasing modes of the fabry - perot cavity ( the glass cuvette ) , hosting an active medium whose effective gain is enhanced by the metallic nps . </S>",
    "<S> this claim is supported by the following evidences : + * i ) * the first observation is that , independently on the sample , the position of the maximum of the emission spectra approximately coincides with the emission peak of the rhodamine ( @xmath12 580  nm ) . </S>",
    "<S> the absolute position shifts with the sample under consideration , likely due to a slightly different effective overlap between the absorption spectrum of the nps and that of the dye . </S>",
    "<S> the inset in figure [ fig4]a further highlights both these aspects . </S>",
    "<S> + * ii ) * the spacing of the spectral features is @xmath130.5 nm for all the samples with polyhedral particles considered . </S>",
    "<S> this value has the same order of magnitude of the expected spacing @xmath14(2nl ) = 0.13  nm of a fabry - perot cavity for normal incidence , with n  =  1.33 ( water ) , l  =  1 mm and @xmath9  =  532  nm . </S>",
    "<S> the difference between the experimental value and the model are most likely due to the resolution of our experimental setup ( 0.3  nm ) and to a different effective index of the active medium . + * iii ) * the fringes are only visible for the samples with polyhedral nps at this pump energy level , as evidenced in figure [ fig4]b and from the high resolution emission spectra of pure rhodamineb - water solution reported in the supplementary information . </S>",
    "<S> this result reinforces the experimental findings of figure [ fig3 ] , where nps with absorption peak close to that of the dye yield to more efficient lasing . </S>",
    "<S> control experiments with water alone confirm the lack of lasing . + a calibration experiment with rhodamine only aqueous solutions ( no np present , see supplementary information ) shows that lasing occurs at a threshold of @xmath124.5  mj . assuming as lasing threshold the point of abrupt change of the slope of the emission peak intensity vs. pump energy in figure [ fig2]c - d </S>",
    "<S> , we can extrapolate the effective gain of the np - dye solution . </S>",
    "<S> for example , for sc we experimentally obtain approximately a ten times increase in the effective gain , with respect to the dye alone , in the range of @xmath15cm@xmath10 ( assuming that a 0.01  mm rhodamine b solution in diethylene - glycol at 0.5  nj/@xmath8m@xmath17 has a gain of  100 cm@xmath10 ) .   </S>",
    "<S> @xcite this estimate assumes that the emission is the super - positioned output of many nanoparticles excited simultaneously . </S>",
    "<S> thus variations in particle size and shape are expected to blur out any regular multi - mode emission spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> + the last aspect to analyze is the emission dynamics in the high pump energy range . from figure [ fig2 ] </S>",
    "<S> it emerges that exceptionally , the lasing intensity only saturates for sc , which is the sample with the highest effective gain . </S>",
    "<S> this is a strong indication that the concentration of electromagnetic energy associated with the plasmonic resonances could result in optical kerr effects characterized by a spectral shift towards longer wavelength , with increasing energy . to verify this hypothesis we recorded several high - resolution spectra of the emission for sample sc , for increasing pump energy , as shown in figure [ fig5 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental results illustrate how increasing the input energy induces a red - shift of the emission shown in the inset of figure [ fig5 ] . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with our hypothesis and demonstrates the general relevance of non - resonant nonlinearities in plasmonic enhanced laser emissions . </S>",
    "<S> it should be noted that the pulsed regime excludes that the shift could be due to thermal effects . in the present experiments , as the resonances shift with increasing energy , their position with respect to the maximum ( absorption ) gain changes and this negative feedback results into a limited amplification . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , figure [ fig5 ] also shows that the fine spectral resonances emerge nonlinearly from a spontaneous emission background , as they get more pronounced and visible by increasing pump . </S>",
    "<S> this is another evidence of the connection between the fine fabry - perot lasing modes and the laser efficiency , both boosted by the presence of resonant nps .        </S>",
    "<S> in conclusion we have unveiled novel aspects of the rich dynamics of plasmonic enhanced dye lasers , and specifically the pronounced non - linear regimes that can be achieved . </S>",
    "<S> highlighting extremely strong light - matter interactions , these novel features include gain saturation due to kerr effect . </S>",
    "<S> these results pave the way to the exploration of novel fundamental physical phenomena relative to nonlinear regimes at a spatial scale much smaller than the wavelength , as well as to innovative applications such as novel kind of laser sources providing ultra - short pulsed operation and structural tunability , realization of ultrafast microprocessors working at thz clock speed , supercontinuum generation , ultrasensing , ultradense and ultrafast information storage . </S>"
