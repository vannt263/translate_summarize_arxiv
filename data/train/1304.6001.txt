    ", a measured scattering angle corresponds to a different recoil energy depending on which nucleus is involved in the interaction ; in this paper , we will refer to iodine equivalent recoil energy , @xmath30 , as the energy given to an iodine nucleus for a given pion scattering angle . for a @xmath1 pion beam ,",
    "approximately @xmath31 of the rate of pions scattering into angles corresponding to @xmath30 between 5 and 20 kev is due to elastic scattering on iodine , with smaller contributions from carbon , fluorine , and inelastic scattering  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the bubble nucleation efficiency for iodine recoils in a bubble chamber with seitz threshold between 5 and 20 kev can be inferred from a measurement of the fraction of pion - scattering events that nucleate bubbles in the chamber as a function of @xmath30 .",
    "the measurement was performed in the fermilab test beam facility  @xcite using a @xmath1 mainly @xmath32 beam with @xmath33 and an angular spread of @xmath34  mrad .",

    "the total length of the telescope was 90  cm .",
    "the angular resolution was 0.6  mrad  ( @xmath6 ) in the horizontal ( @xmath35 ) direction and 0.7  mrad in the vertical ( @xmath36 ) direction , with roughly equal contributions from multiple coulomb scattering ( mcs ) in the target and the spatial resolution of the telescope .",
    "plastic scintillators triggered the pixel telescope on each beam particle .",
    "a small bubble chamber was designed for this measurement consisting of a quartz test tube with inner diameter 10  mm and 1-mm - thick wall , filled with 7  @xmath37 of cf@xmath0i .",
    "the small size is required to minimize mcs in the short radiation length of cf@xmath0i ( @xmath38  mm ) .",

    "an acoustic transducer was attached to the top of the test tube to record the acoustic emission produced during bubble formation , providing the time of bubble nucleation with @xmath2010  @xmath41s resolution .",

    "bubble chamber data were taken between march 14 and march 28 , 2012 , with a beam flux of @xmath201000 particles per 4-second beam spill with one spill per minute .",
    "the size of the beam spot was wider than both the bubble chamber and the pixel telescope .",
    "the chamber was expanded to the superheated state 22 seconds before the arrival of the beam , allowing time for pressure and temperature transients to dissipate after expansion .",
    "the observation of bubbles by a 100-hz video camera system created a bubble chamber trigger , causing the video images and associated data to be recorded and the chamber to be recompressed .",
    "after recompression , the chamber was dead for the remainder of the beam spill , allowing us to collect at most one bubble event per minute .",
    "we collected about four good single - bubble events per hour , with the primary losses due to premature bubble chamber triggers , bubbles forming outside of the region covered by the telescope planes , multiple bubble events and large - angle scatters outside the acceptance of the downstream plaquettes .",
    "the last two categories are predominantly the result of inelastic interactions .",

    "the primary analysis output is the bubble nucleation fraction as a function of @xmath30 , given by the ratio @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the observed number of pion tracks creating single bubbles , @xmath49 is the total number of pion tracks , @xmath50 is the number of tracks creating multiple bubbles , and @xmath51 is the fraction of scatters that occur in the active cf@xmath52i volume , determined by a comparison of the number of scatters in the target - full data set to the number in the target - empty data set normalized to the number of pion tracks ( @xmath53 ) : @xmath54 an angular smearing correction is made to @xmath53 to include the mcs from the absent cf@xmath0i by convolution with the standard gaussian approximation for mcs  @xcite .",
    "each pion track is fitted for an upstream and downstream component , with an associated scattering angle and 3-d point of closest approach of the two components .",
    "the upstream and downstream track segments are required to have exactly one hit cluster in at least three of the four pixel planes , good fits to straight lines ( @xmath55 ) , and to meet in space to within @xmath56  mm . to exclude pions that passed through little or no cf@xmath0i , the upstream track is required to pass within @xmath57  mm of the center of the @xmath58-mm - diameter bubble chamber in the @xmath35 direction .",
    "the @xmath36 location of the track is limited by the vertical extent of the pixel planes . because the uncertainty on the location of the point of closest approach in the beam direction ( @xmath45 ) depends strongly on the scattering angle",

    "the simulation was validated by comparing the simulated scattering angular distributions to data for no target , target empty , target full , and the solid targets . in all cases , in the mcs - dominated small scattering angle region",
    "there is good ( few percent ) agreement with no adjustable parameters , suggesting that the telescope geometry is accurately modeled in the simulation . in the larger scattering angle region dominated by strong elastic scattering , the simulation systematically overestimates the observed scattering rate by @xmath66 . as this ratio is measured to be the same for teflon ( @xmath67 ) and iodine ( @xmath68 ) , we assume that the relative contributions of iodine , fluorine and carbon are being accurately described by the mc .",
    "a significant systematic uncertainty is introduced by our developing understanding of the carbon and fluorine recoil nucleation efficiency in this low energy regime .",
    "ongoing studies with ad hoc neutron sources  @xcite will reduce this uncertainty in the future , but here we apply the exponential carbon and fluorine efficiency model from  @xcite :        we test the hypothesis that the iodine recoil nucleation efficiency follows the nominal seitz model of a step function ( @xmath72 ) with 100% efficiency above the seitz threshold by fitting a step function to the data in the region @xmath73  kev , allowing @xmath18 to float . the fit returns @xmath74 , where the error bars are statistical .",

    "for comparison , the red region represents a step function at the predicted seitz threshold , where the range represents the 1@xmath6 band including the thermodynamic uncertainty and the scale uncertainties in the absolute energy scale of the experiment .",

    "previous studies have shown that the seitz model accurately predicts the threshold at which bubble nucleation begins for heavy radon daughter nuclei in cf@xmath0i  @xcite .",
    "we therefore perform a second fit applying the exponential model to iodine recoils , taking the seitz threshold calculation as an external input to the analysis to explore the allowed range of @xmath76 .",

    "to assess the systematic errors associated with carbon and fluorine recoils , we refit the data with two alternative models for carbon and fluorine efficiency : the flat model from  @xcite with energy - independent nucleation efficiency , @xmath79 , above threshold , and a step function with @xmath80 .",
    "the latter case represents the worst possible scenario for the response of the bubble chamber to iodine recoils , as the response to carbon and fluorine is maximized .",

    "the three different c / f efficiency models described in the text are tested , and in all cases the predicted seitz threshold is treated as a nuisance parameter . by maximizing the subtracted c / f contribution , the step function with @xmath80 represents the worst case for iodine efficiency .

    "however , the response of the chamber to iodine recoils is much closer to the nominal seitz model than it is for carbon and fluorine recoils .",
    "this was expected from the considerably larger stopping power of iodine , which facilitates the concentration of energy that leads to critical bubble formation .",
    "systematic uncertainties from both the absolute beam momentum calibration and the carbon and fluorine response limit the present measurement .",
    "this measurement provides confirmation of the sensitivity of coupp bubble chambers to spin - independent wimp interactions with iodine nuclei , a confirmation that was not attainable using standard neutron source calibrations .",
