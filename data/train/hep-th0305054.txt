    "it is generally believed that string theory , or its non - perturbative framework , has the capability of describing the dynamical transmutation of the spacetime structure . for example , a mechanism of dynamical reduction in spacetime dimensions has been proposed in the context of the iib matrix model @xcite , and the dynamical transmutation of spacetime topology has also been investigated in the framework of string theory . although we do not have a full description of the process , several possible mechanisms for the dynamical transmutation of spacetime topology have been proposed in the context of closed - string tachyon condensation on non - compact orbifolds @xcite .",
    "this feature of string theory is quite attractive , because we can not describe the transmutation of the spacetime structure within the framework of ordinary particle field theories . with these matters in mind ,",
    "we consider in this article closed - string tachyon condensation on unstable orbifolds .",
    "adams , polchinski and silverstein ( aps ) have pointed out that the fixed - point singularity in an unstable orbifold will disappear through the condensation of closed - string tachyons in the twisted sectors on the orbifold @xcite .",
    "the closed - string tachyons in the twisted sectors are localized in the fixed plane , and this fixed plane disappears through tachyon condensation .",
    "this process resembles the decay of d - branes through open - string tachyon condensation on them .",
    "thus , one way to study closed - string tachyon condensation in the twisted sectors is to formulate an analogy with open - string tachyon condensation ; for example , harvey , kutasov , martinec and moore proposed the quantity @xmath2 , . ] which characterizes the process of closed - string tachyon condensation in the twisted sectors through such an analogy @xcite .",
    "it is natural to inquire how far we can use an analogy between the tachyon condensation of open strings and that of closed strings in the twisted sectors . in the case of open - string tachyon condensation ,",
    "the condensation is closely related to the decay of the d - brane ; for example , the tension of the bosonic d - brane on which open - string tachyons exist is equal to the difference between the tree - level tachyon potentials of an unstable vacuum and a stable vacuum .",
    "the tension of the d - brane is essentially the localized energy density which is produced by open strings localized on the d - brane . in this sense , it is important to consider the energy density localized in the fixed plane in the present case , too . the tree - level localized energy density has been investigated in several works @xcite .",
    "we consider the @xmath0 orbifold for simplicity in this work , and the localized energy density in the fixed plane .",
    "however , we do not consider the tree - level localized energy density ; we focus on the localized energy density at the one - loop level .",
    "we extract the decay rate per unit volume of the fixed plane at leading order from the localized energy density at the one - loop level by using the method proposed in ref .",
    "the localized energy density diverges at the one - loop level because there exist tachyons in the twisted sectors .",
    "however , we can obtain a finite contribution after application of the appropriate regularization proposed in ref .",
    "we then calculate the decay rate of the unstable fixed plane by using the regularized energy density and show that the decay rate of the fixed plane on the @xmath0 orbifold grows monotonically as a function of @xmath1 .    in the next section ,",
    "we consider the one - loop amplitude of type ii superstrings on the @xmath0 orbifold .",
    "the one - loop amplitude corresponds to the energy induced by vacuum fluctuations on the orbifold .",
    "the induced energy can be divided into an unlocalized component and a localized component in the fixed plane .",
    "we consider the question of how to extract the localized component from the total one - loop amplitude . in section 3",
    ", we consider the one - loop correction to the energy density of the fixed plane on the orbifold , utilizing the method introduced in ref .",
    "we also consider the decay rate of the fixed plane . in section 4",
    ", we explicitly evaluate the decay rate per unit volume of the fixed plane on the orbifold and show that this decay rate per unit volume of the fixed plane grows monotonically as a function of @xmath1 .",
    "we present conclusions and some open problems in the last section .",
    "let us start by reviewing some of the basic properties of type ii superstrings on a @xmath0 orbifold .",
    "we define the @xmath3 orbifold by identifying the 8 - 9 plane under the rotation @xmath4 given by @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the rotation generator .",
    "the 8 - 9 plane becomes a cone with deficit angle @xmath7 under this identification .",
    "the tip of the cone , the origin of the 8 - 9 plane ( @xmath8 ) , is the fixed point that constitutes the @xmath9-dimensional fixed plane in the target space .",
    "spacetime fermions exist if @xmath10 is odd , and the ground state of the untwisted sector is massless in this case @xcite .",
    "rotation in @xmath4 is necessary for the existence of fermions in the untwisted sector @xcite . ]",
    "we therefore take @xmath10 to be a positive odd integer ( @xmath11 ) in this paper so that there are no tachyons in the untwisted sector .",
    "let us consider type ii superstrings on such an orbifold .",
    "we use the rns formalism with the following worldsheet action : @xmath12 it is convenient to represent @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 as complex fields according to the following : @xmath17 the boundary conditions in the @xmath18-th twisted sector ( @xmath19 ) corresponds to the untwisted sector . ]",
    "are @xmath20 the one - loop amplitude of the strings on the orbifold is given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the moduli of the torus , and @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "the quantity @xmath24 is the volume of the @xmath25 part of the spacetime , which is equal to the volume of the fixed plane , and @xmath26 is the fundamental region for @xmath27 , which is typically chosen as that satisfying @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "we define @xmath30 as @xmath31 the meaning of @xmath18 is that @xmath30 comes from the @xmath18-th twisted sector .",
    "the sum over @xmath32 should be regarded as the @xmath33 projection @xmath34 , which extracts the invariant states under the action of @xmath4 .",
    "some comments regarding the untwisted part of the partition function are in order .",
    "the quantity @xmath35 is the contribution from the untwisted sector , although it should be noted that there is a slight difference between @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "let us first consider @xmath36 .",
    "the denominator in eq .",
    "( [ zlm ] ) includes @xmath38 , which might cause a divergence .",
    "this divergence is due to the zero modes of the untwisted sector and represents the infinite volume of the 8 - 9 plane , which is perpendicular to the fixed plane @xcite .",
    "eventually vanishes , due to the effect of numerator @xmath39 , which represents spacetime supersymmetry in the original type ii superstring models . ]",
    "therefore , we have a ten - dimensional volume factor in the @xmath40 part of @xmath41 .",
    "this can be easily understood , because the orbifold with @xmath42 , where @xmath43 , is not actually an orbifold but an ordinary flat spacetime in which all contributions of strings are extended into the ten - dimensional spacetime .",
    "by contrast , there is no such divergent component in @xmath37 , and the volume factor is just @xmath24 in that case .",
    "this implies that @xmath37 represents a part of the quantity localized in the @xmath9-dimensional subspace of the target space .",
    "we find that this @xmath9-dimensional subspace is the fixed plane through the following consideration .",
    "the one - loop amplitude corresponds to the vacuum energy induced by vacuum fluctuations at the one - loop level .",
    "let us consider the vacuum energy induced by the twisted - sector closed strings at the one - loop level .",
    "strings in the twisted sectors are localized in the fixed plane , because their center - of - mass coordinates are located in the fixed plane .",
    "therefore , the vacuum energy induced by the twisted - sector closed strings is localized in the fixed plane .",
    "it may be thought that the contribution of the twisted sectors just gives the localized component of the induced vacuum energy .",
    "however , the contribution of the twisted sectors alone is not enough to construct the localized vacuum energy .",
    "this is because the contribution of the twisted sectors to @xmath44 is given by @xmath45 , although @xmath46 itself is not modular invariant .",
    "the only way to make it modular invariant is to incorporate @xmath47 into @xmath48 and to consider @xmath49 it is thereby found that @xmath50 is modular invariant .",
    "of course , the localized vacuum energy is a physical quantity and should be represented in a modular invariant way .    from the above considerations",
    ", it is found that the localized component of @xmath41 in the fixed plane can be represented as @xmath51 therefore , @xmath47 should also be regarded as a part of the localized component of the partition function in the fixed plane .",
    "let us consider the meaning of the word  localized \" we have used here .",
    "it is known that closed strings in the twisted sectors can sweep the spacetime far from the fixed plane , although their center - of - mass coordinates are always in the fixed plane .",
    "however , twisted strings have to be stretched in order to reach points far from the fixed plane , and this costs energy . therefore , the main contribution of the twisted strings comes from the diagrams that sweep the vicinity of the fixed plane .",
    "this is the meaning of the",
    " localized \" contribution .    in the case of untwisted strings which contribute to @xmath37 ,",
    "their center - of - mass coordinates are not restricted to the fixed plane . however , their one - loop diagrams are twisted around the fixed plane .",
    "the contribution of the one - loop diagrams that sweep points far from the fixed plane is therefore smaller than the contribution of those that sweep the vicinity of the fixed plane .",
    "thus , the main contribution of @xmath37 comes from the diagrams that sweep the vicinity of the fixed plane . with this realization",
    ", we find that it is natural to regard @xmath52 as the contribution to the induced vacuum energy localized in the fixed plane .",
    "the situation described here is schematically depicted in figs .",
    "[ fig : twist.eps ] and [ fig : untwist.eps ] .     and",

    "the @xmath55 case is twisted .",
    "@xmath56 denotes the proper time . ) ]    from the above discussion , we find that the vacuum energy density localized in the fixed plane at the one - loop level is given by @xmath57 we have fixed the overall normalization of the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ rho - local ] ) so that the normalization is the same as that of the corresponding particle field theory in the low - energy limit .",
    "it is easily found that @xmath58 in the present model .",
    "thus , @xmath52 is equal to @xmath44 in our model .",
    "this implies that the induced vacuum energy at the one - loop level in our model arises only in the vicinity of the fixed plane .",
    "aps have pointed out that the @xmath0 orbifold is dynamically transmuted into the @xmath59 orbifold , where @xmath60 , through closed - string tachyon condensation in the twisted sectors on the original orbifold .",
    "the final result of this process is ordinary flat spacetime without orbifolding ( @xmath61 ) , which possesses supersymmetry and no tachyons . in other words ,",
    "the fixed plane on the initial orbifold disappears through the condensation of the twisted - sector closed - string tachyons localized in the fixed plane .",
    "this is reminiscent of the decay process of bosonic d - branes , which is brought about by open - string tachyon condensation .",
    "it is therefore natural to formulate an analogy between a d - brane and the fixed plane .    in the sense described above , consideration of the  tension \" of the fixed plane on the orbifold is of interest .",
    "the tension of the d - brane is the energy density localized in the d - brane .",
    "therefore , it is quite important to consider the energy density localized in the fixed plane .",
    "several proposals to define such an energy density at the classical level have been made in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we have seen that @xmath62 can also be regarded as the energy density localized in the fixed plane induced by vacuum fluctuations . however , this is a quantity at the one - loop level of string theory and should be regarded as the one - loop correction to the classical energy density .",
    "although the main part of the energy density of the fixed plane is given by the tree - level energy density , we consider the one - loop energy density @xmath62 in this study",
    ".    we should point out that @xmath62 defined by eq .",

    "@xcite .",
    "the presence of an ir divergence does not necessarily imply the failure of the theory .",
    "the ir divergence in @xmath62 due to tachyons only indicates the instability of the vacuum , and we can extract physically sensible quantities from it . a method to regularize the ir divergence due to tachyons in the one - loop amplitude has been proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",

    "this divergence can be regularized as follows by use of analytic continuation : @xmath67 however , the regularized amplitude becomes complex in general .",
    "the imaginary part of eq .",
    "( [ regul - part ] ) can be obtained as @xmath68 thus , the imaginary part of @xmath62 after regularization is @xmath69 where the sum over @xmath65 runs for all the tachyonic states .",
    "this imaginary part has a physical meaning @xcite : the quantity @xmath70 can be regarded as the one - loop correction to the effective action of the string theory on the orbifold .",
    "thus , @xmath71 should correspond to the decay rate of the vacuum of the @xmath0 orbifold .",
    "the subscript @xmath1 of @xmath72 indicates that the discrete group we have used in the construction of this orbifold is @xmath73 .",
    "the precise meaning of @xmath72 can be understood by employing the argument given in ref .",
    "@xcite in the framework of particle field theory .",
    "the decay rate per unit volume of an unstable vacuum is defined in ref .",
    "@xcite by considering the time evolution of the initial vacuum state ; it is extracted from the time dependence of the overlap of the initial unstable state localized at the top of the tachyon potential with its time - developed state .",
    "the correspondence between @xmath72 obtained in the framework of string theory and the decay rate given in ref .",
    "@xcite in particle field theory can be understood as follows .",
    "let us consider as an example a @xmath74-dimensional bosonic scalar field theory .",
    "then , the one - loop amplitude for the bosonic particles of mass @xmath75 is given by @xmath76 if these bosonic particles are tachyons and @xmath77 , then @xmath78 has an imaginary part , @xmath79 , when @xmath80 .",
    "the imaginary part of the one - loop amplitude can be easily evaluated as @xmath81 here , @xmath82 is the one - loop correction to the effective action for the scalar field , and @xmath83 gives the decay rate per unit volume of the unstable vacuum given in ref .",
    "note that if we have more than one scalar field in 8-dimensional spacetime , the generalized expression of eq .",
    "( [ decay - field ] ) coincides with eq .",
    "( [ gamma - n ] ) . in the present model",
    ", there are no tachyons in the bulk , and the instability of the vacuum is localized only in the fixed plane .",
    "furthermore , the canonical dimension of @xmath72 indicates that @xmath72 is the decay rate per unit volume of the 7-dimensional subspace .",
    "therefore , it is natural to regard @xmath72 as the decay rate per unit volume of the fixed plane at the one - loop level of the perturbative string theory .",
    "the sum @xmath84 depends on discrete group @xmath73 .",
    "we investigate the @xmath1 dependence of @xmath72 in the next section .",
    "the real part of @xmath62 after the analytic continuation should be regarded as the one - loop correction to the localized energy density in the fixed plane .",
    "it has been pointed out in the framework of particle field theory that the real part of the vacuum energy after the analytic continuation depends on the choice of the wavepacket in which each fourier mode of the field is placed @xcite .",
    "it is also known that if we choose the minimum uncertainty wavepacket , the real part of the vacuum energy coincides with the real part of the regularized effective action .",
    "we assume here that we are considering the case in which we have chosen the minimum uncertainty wavepacket in the corresponding field theory , and we regard the real part of @xmath62 as the one - loop correction to the vacuum energy density .",
    "let us consider the real part of the regularized energy density of the fixed plane on the @xmath85 orbifold as an example .",
    "we must carry out a numerical calculation to obtain the real part of @xmath62 .",
    "the tachyonic states in this orbifold are only the ground states in the twisted sectors .",
    "@xmath62 can be approximately written as @xmath86 where the contribution of the massive modes has been omitted .",
    "we have also ignored the integral in the region satisfying @xmath87 in @xmath26 .",
    "the first term in the integrand is the contribution of the tachyonic modes , and it should be defined by using analytic continuation . after this analytic continuation ,",
    "we obtain @xmath88 therefore , the one - loop contribution to the localized energy density in the fixed plane on the @xmath85 orbifold is negative .",
    "this suggests a positive energy density at the tree level whose magnitude is sufficiently large to overwhelm this negative one - loop contribution .",
    "in this section , we consider the @xmath1 dependence of @xmath72 for the @xmath0 orbifold . we need to list all the physical tachyonic states in the twisted sectors , because @xmath72 is essentially given by @xmath84 , where the sum over @xmath65 runs over all the tachyonic states .",
    "the mass squared of the ground state in the @xmath18-th twisted sector is given as follows : @xmath89 thus , every twisted sector has tachyons .",
    "furthermore , some excited states can also be tachyonic .",
    "we find that the mass squared of such a @xmath90-th excited tachyonic state in the @xmath18-th twisted sector can be written as @xmath91 where @xmath90 should be a non - negative integer satisfying @xmath77 .",
    "an important property of eqs .",
    "( [ kth - mass - odd ] ) and ( [ kth - mass - even ] ) is that the tachyonic spectrum for odd @xmath18 is exactly the same as the tachyonic spectrum in the @xmath32-th twisted sector , where @xmath32 is an even integer given by @xmath92 .",
    "therefore , we only need to consider the tachyonic spectrum in the @xmath18-th twisted sector with odd @xmath18 , that is , we have @xmath93 where @xmath94 labels only the tachyonic states in the @xmath18-th twisted sector with odd @xmath18 .",

    "let us consider the tachyonic spectrum in the @xmath18-th twisted sector with odd @xmath18 , which is given by eq .",

    "one of the decay paths that was investigated by aps is that in which @xmath1 decreases monotonically through tachyon condensation until it finally reaches zero , which corresponds to a flat spacetime .",
    "the results of this work indicate that @xmath72 decreases monotonically through this process and finally becomes zero .",
    "this property of @xmath72 tempts us to find a connection of @xmath72 to the total transition rate from the @xmath0 orbifold to a flat spacetime through tachyon condensation .",

    "the method we have utilized to calculate the regularized @xmath62 is also applicable to other orbifolds that have been considered in the context of closed - string tachyon condensation in the twisted sectors .",
    "it would be interesting to examine whether or not the decay rates of the fixed planes always decrease monotonically along the decay paths of the orbifolds .",
    "it would also be interesting to consider whether there is some connection between each tachyonic mode and each decay branch from the viewpoint of the decay rate considered in the present work .",
    "the relationship between the transition rate from the initial orbifold to the flat spacetime and the decay rate we have calculated in this paper is not clear at this stage .",
