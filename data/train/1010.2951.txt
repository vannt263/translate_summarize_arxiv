    "the _ coarsening dynamics _ or _ domain growth _ of a thermodynamically unstable system , such as a ferromagnet or a binary mixture quenched below the critical point , is a well - established paradigm of slow relaxation . from the pioneering work of marro et al .",
    "@xcite up to the reviews of bray  @xcite and puri  @xcite , the equal - time properties have been extensively investigated .",
    "recently , the interest has shifted to the study of two - time quantities , since the ordering process offers a simple and non - trivial arena for the understanding of aging phenomena  @xcite .",
    "there is also a long - standing interest in studying the robustness of the basic features of coarsening systems when quenched disorder ( without frustration ) is introduced @xcite . taking the ising model with ferromagnetic couplings as the basic system ,",
    "the class of disordered systems investigated includes the _ random field ising model _ ( rfim )  @xcite and the _ random bond ising model _ ( rbim )  @xcite .",
    "the first effect of disorder is to change the relaxation mechanism from purely energy lowering to activated , due to the creation of energy barriers  @xcite .",
    "the question is to what extent this affects the growth law , namely the dependence on time of the linear size of domains @xmath3 .",
    "intuitively , the presence of energy barriers is expected to slow down the coarsening process . however , the problem turns out not to be so straightforward , since the barrier size may depend on the domain size , thus determining the nature of the asymptotic growth law through a non - trivial feedback process .",
    "so far , this issue has been well understood in the case of one - dimensional systems .",
    "the @xmath4 rfim  @xcite and the @xmath4 rbim  @xcite offer instructive and clear instances of disorder forming either @xmath5-dependent barriers ( in the rfim ) or @xmath5-independent barriers ( in the rbim ) . in both cases , there is a crossover . in the @xmath4 rfim , it occurs from pure - like power - law growth to disorder - dominated logarithmic growth . in the @xmath4 rbim",
    ", the crossover takes place in the reverse order : from a pre - asymptotic disorder - dependent power law to an asymptotic pure - like power - law growth .    in higher dimensions ,",
    "a crossover from algebraic to logarithmic behavior has been found in the growth law of the rfim  @xcite .",
    "a crossover from algebraic to slower than power - law behavior , possibly logarithmic , has been reported also in the case of the random site ising model ( rsim )  @xcite . according to the phenomenological theory of huse and henley ( hh )  @xcite ,",
    "this means that in these systems energy barriers ought to scale like a power of @xmath5 .    instead , in the @xmath6 rbim the role of barriers and the nature of the growth law has remained controversial , since the available numerical evidence shows a steady algebraic growth with a disorder - dependent dynamical exponent  @xcite . the open issue is whether the data manage to probe the genuine late time behavior , in which case energy barriers ought to scale logarithmically with @xmath5  @xcite , or the hh paradigma is valid also for this system , in which case the data would be probing a long pre - asymptotic regime , eventually to be followed by a crossover to logarithmic growth  @xcite . that an hh - type scenario might yield an effective algebraic law at intermediate times",
    "had already been noticed by bouchaud et al .",
    "@xcite in the context of spin glasses .",
    "our contribution in this paper is precisely the clearing up of this point , producing the numerical evidence for the existence of the crossover to logarithmic growth in the @xmath6 rbim .",
    "a related important question is how disorder affects the scaling functions , namely whether it enters only through the modified growth law or if there is also an explicit disorder dependence .",
    "in the first case , scaling functions ought to be the same for pure and disordered systems , once time is reparametrized through @xmath3 .",
    "this is referred to as the _ super - universality _ ( su ) hypothesis  @xcite , whose validity has been supported mainly from numerical results for the equal - time correlation function or structure factor  @xcite .",
    "more recently , the validity of su has been extended by sicilia et al .",
    "@xcite to the geometrical properties of domain structures and by henkel and pleimling ( hp )  @xcite to two - time quantities , such as the order parameter autocorrelation and autoresponse functions in the @xmath6 rbim .",
    "however , next to the features supporting su validity , there exists also some evidence showing su violation , as reported by hp  @xcite in the short distance behavior of the @xmath6 rbim and by park and pleimling  @xcite in the space - time correlation function in the rsim .",
    "what is missing , here , is the general framework where to fit coherently these conflicting pieces of information , with the end - result that the issue of su validity is regarded as yet to be understood .",
    "by contrast , a clear picture emerges from the @xmath4 cases mentioned above  @xcite , where the crossover can be investigated with considerable precision and turns out not to be limited to the growth law , but to take place also in the correlation and response functions .",
    "then , the issue of su validity or lack of validity is reduced to deciding whether the asymptotics are or are not disorder - dominated . adopting this point of view",
    ", our finding of the crossover in the growth law in @xmath6 rbim strongly suggests that in this system too there might be full violation of su and that this might fit into the pattern extracted from the @xmath4 systems .",
    "indeed , this is what we find from the autocorrelation and autoresponse function data and , putting together these new data with those for @xmath4 systems , we have succeded in constructing a new and coherent picture of general character for the coarsening dynamics of weakly disordered systems .",
    "this is most effectively formulated into a renormalization group framework in terms of the competition between a _ pure fixed point _ and a _",
    "disordered fixed point_. then , the variety of different scenarios observed arises from the different possible choices in the relative stability of these fixed points .",
    "finally , the presence of disorder allows for an exhaustive investigation of the scaling properties of the dynamical susceptibility . the data in the pre - asymptotic regime of the @xmath6 rbim , where the growth law is algebraic with good precision , together with those for the @xmath4 rbim , produce conclusive evidence for the @xmath7-dependence of the exponent involved .",
    "our results are in agreement with the conjecture put forward in studies of the pure system  @xcite .",
    "a preliminary account of this result has been presented in ref .",

    "this section is devoted to an overview , using scaling arguments and renormalization group ( rg ) terminology , of the possible deviations from pure - like behavior due to disorder .",
    "the linear size of domains in pure systems asymptotically grows according to the power law l(t ) = d_0 t^1/z , [ gr.1 ] which holds when time @xmath8 is large enough for @xmath3 to dominate all other lengths in the problem .",
    "here , @xmath9 is a prefactor which is dependent on temperature , and @xmath10 is the dynamical exponent .",
    "it is straightforward to verify that the above power law satisfies the homogeneity relation l(t ) = l l ( t l^z ) [ ho.1 ] where @xmath11 is arbitrary and can be regarded as the scale parameter in an rg transformation . in this paper",
    "we shall consider only non - conserved dynamics .",

    "l ( t l^z , l^ ) [ ho.2 ] where @xmath13 is a parameter quantifying the amount of disorder and @xmath14 is the corresponding scaling exponent .",
    "once the growth law is written in this form , the standard crossover scenario follows from the competition between the pure fixed point at @xmath15 and the disordered fixed point at @xmath16 .",
    "the relative stability of these two fixed points is regulated by the sign of @xmath14 , with the pure fixed point being stable or unstable for @xmath17 or @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "in the first case the asymptotic growth law would remain the pure one , while , in the second case , there would be the crossover to an asymptotic behavior different from that of eq .",

    "therefore , the relevancy or irrelevancy of disorder can be deduced from the behavior of @xmath20 as @xmath25 .",

    "however , in spite of the huge numerical effort , we can not conclusively determine the exponent @xmath119 which characterizes the logarithmic regime .",
    "clearly , more work is needed in this direction .",
    "we use rg arguments to understand the crossover in the growth law in terms of the competition between a pure fixed point and a disordered fixed point . within this framework the corresponding crossover in two - time quantities , like the autocorrelation function @xmath120 and the autoresponse function @xmath121 , is expected .",
    "the scaling function for @xmath120 shows the onset of the crossover from a pure form to a disordered one .",
    "even though the numerical data are limited to the pre - asymptotic region , there is clear evidence that the su hypothesis does not hold for two - time quantities .",
    "a similar behavior is observed in the data for @xmath121 , where the crossover region is not entered deep enough for @xmath122 to develop the @xmath123-singularity which eventually should change the scaling exponent from the pure value @xmath114 to the disorder value @xmath113 .",
    "nonetheless , the measurement of the pure exponent @xmath116 is quite an interesting result in itself , adding new evidence in support of the phenomenological conjecture of eq .",
    "( [ aurf.2 ] ) .    at a more general level , the rg framework formulated in this paper , in the context of the @xmath6 rbim , proves to be comprehensive enough to give also a natural explanation for the known results for the @xmath4 rfim and @xmath4 rbim . as such",
    ", it is a good candidate for the understanding of coarsening in disordered systems , whose predictive power could be tested at higher dimensionality or in other systems , like the site diluted ising model , where the crossover region perhaps is more easily accessible than in the rbim  @xcite .",
