    "<S> rapid thermalization in ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collisions leads to fast changing potential between a heavy quark and antiquark from zero temperature potential to the finite temperature one . </S>",
    "<S> time dependent perturbation theory can then be used to calculate the survival probability of the initial quarkonium state . in view of very short time </S>",
    "<S> scales of thermalization at rhic and lhc energies , we calculate the survival probability of @xmath0 and @xmath1 using sudden approximation . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that quarkonium decay may be significant even when temperature of qgp remains low enough so that the conventional quarkonium melting due to debye screening is ineffective .    </S>",
    "<S> suppression of heavy quarkonia as a signal for the quark - gluon plasma phase in relativistic heavy - ion collisions has been investigated intensively since the original proposal by matsui and satz @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the underlying physical picture of this suppression is that due to deconfinment , potential between @xmath2 gets debye screened , resulting in the swelling of quarkonia . </S>",
    "<S> if the debye screening length of the medium is less than the radius of quarkonia , then @xmath2 may not form bound states , leading to melting of the initial quarkonium . due to this melting </S>",
    "<S> , the yield of quarkonia will be _ </S>",
    "<S> suppressed_. this was proposed as a signature of qgp and has been observed experimentally @xcite . however , there are other factors too that can lead to the suppression of @xmath0 because of which it has not been possible to use @xmath0 suppression as a clean signal for qgp .    in the above picture , suppression of quarkonia </S>",
    "<S> occurs when the temperature of qgp achieves a certain value , @xmath3 , so that the debye screening melts the quarkonium bound state . </S>",
    "<S> thus , if the temperature remains smaller than @xmath3 , so that debye screening length remains larger than the quarkonia size , no suppression is expected . </S>",
    "<S> this type of picture is consistent with the _ adiabatic _ evolution of a quantum state under changing potential . </S>",
    "<S> original quarkonia has a wave function appropriate for zero temperature potential between a @xmath4 and @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> if the environment of the quarkonium changes to a finite temperature qgp adiabatically , with debye screened potential , the final state will evolve to the quarkonium state corresponding to the finite temperature potential . if temperature remains below @xmath3 , quarkonium wave function changes ( adiabatically ) but it survives as the quarkonium .    </S>",
    "<S> we question this assumption of adiabatic evolution for ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collisions , such as at rhic , and especially at lhc . at such energies , </S>",
    "<S> it is possible that thermalization is achieved in a very short time , about 0.25 fm for rhic and even smaller about 0.1 fm for lhc @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> even conservatively , thermalization is achieved within 1 fm as suggested by the elliptic flow measurements @xcite . for @xmath0 and even for @xmath1 , typical time scale of @xmath6 dynamics will be at least 1 - 2 fm from the size of the bound state and the fact that @xmath6 have non - relativistic velocities . also , @xmath7 between @xmath0 and its next excited state ( @xmath8 ) is about 300 mev ( 400 mev for @xmath1 states ) , leading to transition time scale @xmath9 fm ( 0.5 fm for @xmath1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus the change in the potential between @xmath4 and @xmath5 occurs in a time scale which is at most of the same order , and likely much shorter than , the typical time scale of the dynamics of the @xmath6 system , or the time scale of transition between relevant states . </S>",
    "<S> the problem , therefore , should be treated in terms of a time dependent perturbation and survival probability of quarkonia should be calculated under this perturbation . </S>",
    "<S> it is immediately clear that even if the final temperature remains less than @xmath3 , if the change in potential is fast enough invalidating the adiabatic assumption , then transition of initial quarkonium state to other excited states will occur . </S>",
    "<S> such excited states will have much larger size , typically larger than the debye screening length , and will melt away . thus quarkonia melting can occur even when qgp temperature remains below @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> we mention that adiabatic evolution of quarkonia states has been discussed earlier for the _ cooling stage _ of qgp in relativistic heavy ion collisions in the context of sequential suppression of quarkonia states @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , as far as we are aware , validity of adiabatic evolution during the _ thermalization _ stage has not been discussed earlier .    given the large difference between thermalization time scale of order 0.1 - 0.2 fm @xcite , and the time scale of @xmath6 dynamics in a quarkonium bound state being of order 1 - 2 fm ( or the time scale of transition between relevant states being 0.5 - 0.7 fm ) , it may be reasonable to use the _ sudden _ perturbation approximation . </S>",
    "<S> the initial wave function of the quarkonium can not change under this sudden perturbation . </S>",
    "<S> thus , as soon as thermalization is achieved with qgp temperature being @xmath10 ( which may remain less than @xmath3 for the quarkonium state under consideration ) , the initial quarkonium wave function is no longer an energy eigen state of the new hamiltonian with the @xmath6 potential corresponding to temperature @xmath10 </S>",
    "<S> . one can find overlap with the new eigen states , giving us the survival probability of the quarkonium as well as the probability of its transition to other excited states .    for calculating the zero temperature wave function of the quarkonium we use the following potential between @xmath4 and @xmath5 .    </S>",
    "<S> @xmath11    where @xmath12 is the strong coupling constant and @xmath13 is the string tension . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath0 , we will use charm quark mass @xmath14 gev , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath1 , we use the bottom quark mass @xmath17 gev .    for calculating wave functions at finite temperature we use the following potential which incorporates debye screening @xcite    </S>",
    "<S> @xmath18    where @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> we have calculated wave functions for charmonium and bottomonium states at different temperatures with above potentials using numerov method for solving the schr@xmath20dinger equation . </S>",
    "<S> we have also used energy minimization technique to get the wave functions for the ground states and the binding energy and the results obtained by both the methods match very well . </S>",
    "<S> fig.1 shows plots of wave functions for @xmath0 at @xmath21 and 200 mev . with finite temperature potential ( eq.(2 ) ) , excited states of charmonium are not found for @xmath22 mev . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 shows wave functions for @xmath1 states at @xmath23 , and 500 mev . for bottomonium , </S>",
    "<S> we find excited state @xmath24 at @xmath25 mev which is shown in fig.3 , along with the ground state @xmath26 at @xmath21 .     states at different temperatures.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]     states at different temperatures.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]     and @xmath24 states at @xmath21 and @xmath25 mev respectively.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    as we mentioned , we use the sudden approximation to calculate the survival probability of quarkonium state which is calculated directly by calculating ( mod square of ) the overlap of the wave function of the zero temperature quarkonium state with the wave function of the appropriate state at finite temperature . </S>",
    "<S> figs.1 - 3 immediately give an idea of this overlap , which is clearly decreasing with increasing temperature implying decreasing survival probability of the quarkonium . </S>",
    "<S> fig.4 shows the plot of survival probabilities for @xmath0 and for @xmath1 as a function of temperature . </S>",
    "<S> survival probabilities are plotted up to a temperature @xmath3 beyond which the quarkonium state does not exist any more due to debye screening in the potential in eq.(2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we note dramatic decrease in survival probabilities down to about 10 % for both @xmath0 and @xmath1 as temperature increases to 270 mev and 560 mev respectively for the two cases . </S>",
    "<S> it is important to note that survival probabilities for @xmath0 and @xmath1 significantly reduce even when the temperature remains smaller than @xmath3 for the respective case . </S>",
    "<S> the overlap of @xmath24 wave function at @xmath25 mev and @xmath26 at @xmath21 ( fig.3 ) gives the transition probability of an initial @xmath1 to the excited state to be about 10 % .     </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0 and @xmath1 states in qgp at different temperatures calculated in the sudden ( quench ) approximation.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    we point out the main difference between our approach and the conventional approaches for calculating heavy quarkonium suppression in qgp . in conventional approach , </S>",
    "<S> quarkonium suppression is calculated for a qgp medium which has achieved high enough temperature @xmath3 so that debye screening becomes effective in making the quarkonium unbound . </S>",
    "<S> if temperature remains below @xmath3 one does not expect any suppression of the corresponding quarkonium state . </S>",
    "<S> our approach is to focus on the situation when temperature remains below @xmath3 ( for the specific quarkonium under consideration ) . </S>",
    "<S> if the initial thermalization of qgp happens very slowly in time scale much larger than the time scale of quarkonium which is of order 1 fm , then indeed we will conclude that no quarkonium suppression will be expected . </S>",
    "<S> however , in ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collisions thermalization is definitely achieved within a time scale of about 1 fm ( from elliptic flow measurements ) @xcite , which is of same order as the dynamical scale of @xmath6 in the quarkonium bound state ( or the time scale of transition between relevant states ) . </S>",
    "<S> in such a situation one can not assume that the initial zero temperature quarkonium state will simply evolve to the finite temperature quarkonium state . </S>",
    "<S> instead , time dependent perturbation theory should be used to calculate the survival probability of the initial quarkonium state . in fact </S>",
    "<S> expected thermalization time scale at rhic and lhc may be as short as 0.25 - 0.1 fm respectively @xcite . with such rapid thermalization , use of sudden perturbation approximation may be appropriate . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate survival probability of quarkonium ( and transition to excited state for @xmath1 ) and show that even when temperature of qgp remains much below @xmath3 , the quarkonium state can decay with significant probability . </S>",
    "<S> even if the temperature exceeds @xmath3 , during initial stages of heating the decay of initial quarkonium state due to time dependent potential , as discussed here , should be incorporated in calculating the final net quarkonium suppression .    one way to clearly distinguish our mechanism from the conventional mechanism </S>",
    "<S> is to study quarkonium suppression for varying qgp temperatures and the thermalization time scale independently . </S>",
    "<S> one may achieve this by considering different centrality , or rapidity , or by using different combinations of nucleus size and collision energies so that the thermalization time and qgp temperature can be varied independently . </S>"
