    "has strong impact in development of artificial intelligence , providing tools for knowledge representation , knowledge management and reasoning @xcite .",
    "many problems related to computer vision , speech recognition , extraction of information or diagnosis of diseases can be modelled by probabilistic graphical models which structures describe conditional dependencies between random variables @xcite . this kind of models is indirectly related with bayesian reasoning , which is a method of statistical inference based on bayes theorem .",
    "bayesian reasoning gives a possibility of decision making under uncertainty , which leads to updating of beliefs in light of new information .",
    "the bayesian approach to reasoning can be used in the well - known monty hall problem , which can be considered as a counterintuitive two - step decision problem .",
    "the probabilistic analysis of this problem develops an intuition about updating a prior belief as new evidence becomes , which gives a deeper understanding of bayesian methods used in the artificial intelligence .",
    "consequently , we use the monty hall problem as an illustration of quantum bayesian reasoning based on quantum information theory and quantum inferring acausal structures .",

    "subsequently , leifer with spekkens @xcite presented formalism of quantum inferring structures based on quantum conditional states .",
    "they described two cases of structures : causal ( one system at two times ) and acausal ( two systems at a single time ) .",
    "quantum inferring structures based on quantum probability theory allow for a novel causal interpretation and generalization of the results of quantum mechanics .",
    "recently , in many scientific disciplines , the inferring causal and acausal relations from observed correlations are relevant problems .",
    "the framework of quantum conditional operators was used by brunker @xcite to investigate quantum causality .",
    "the author assumed , that indefinite causal structures could provide methodological tools in quantum theories of gravity . in @xcite , the authors used the quantum conditional operators as causal maps to consideration of the problem of causal inference for quantum variables .",
