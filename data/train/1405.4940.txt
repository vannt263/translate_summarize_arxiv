    "in the area of nanoelectronics , single electron transistor ( set ) is well known due to its quantised nature of transport since its discovery @xcite that has found application for sensitive charge detections @xcite .",
    "the packing density of the mosfet devices in the present day cmos technology is limited by the gate lengths accessible using various lithography techniques and the tunnelling issues . as a result of which the industry is constantly looking for useful alternatives in next generation technology to achieve faster switching performance and speed .",
    "set s can be useful in this direction due to its small size and low power operation and performance that can be easily integrated towards large scale fabrication in future .",
    "while the conventional metallic set s were made using a metallic island artificially placed between the s / d electrodes , in the recent times growing interest was found in replacing the metallic island by an organic molecule and hence the area of molecular electronics was developed that has made significant progress towards developing single molecular devices ( smt ) with the organic molecules as the active component of the circuit @xcite .",
    "operation of such devices have been in presence for the past years which was first demonstrated by reed @xmath1 @xcite using benzene-1,4-dithiolate as the active molecule .",
    "experimental realisations of such devices were made successfully in carbon based systems @xcite , benzene @xcite , oligophenylenevinylene ( opv ) @xcite , fullerene @xcite , dipyridylamide @xcite and to design logic circuits @xcite etc .",
    "however , understanding the detailed nature of electronic transport in such devices in still under study and has not been well understood in details . in the strong coupling ( sc )",
    "limit , the conduction behaviour is usually dominated by the coherent electron transport that often overestimates the current / conductance and in the weak coupling ( wc ) limit , the sequential nature of transport is governed by the orthodox theory of coulomb blockade that underestimates the value of the energy gap @xcite . while the transport behaviour is usually estimated semi - empirically using a combination of non - equilibrium green s function formalism ( negf ) and density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite in the sc limit , the incoherent transport behaviour in the wc limit was formalised by a recent approach proposed by kaasberg @xmath2 @xcite and strokobro @xmath1 @xcite has introduced this within a dft framework for the estimation of various energy levels .",
    "this approach has been used computationally in the recent times to estimate the charging energy of systems based on benzene @xcite , fullerene @xcite , napthalene @xcite , dna chain @xcite etc . which has found excellent agreement with the experimental results .",
    "due to the incoherent nature of transport , a smt is incredibly sensitivity to its charge state similar to a set .",
    "while an incoming charge is capacitively coupled to the smt molecule , any change in the charge state can be sensed through the charge stability diagram . in a conventional smt",
    ", the gate electrode is placed in very close proximity of the island ( or the molecule ) to control the chemical potential independently . here in this present case",
    ", we have modified this geometry to introduce an additional gate electrode on top of the molecule to achieve better electrostatic control over the device and to find its influence on the energy levels of the molecule and to demonstrate its usefulness as a sensitive charge detector .",
    "in this present work , the active component of the the system under investigation is an 1,3-cyclobutadiene molecule working as the ` island ' in the smt devices .",
    "the molecule has a square central structure with 4 hydrogen atoms placed symmetrically at each corners of the carbon atoms as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig.1](a ) .",
    "the small and planar structure of cyclobutadiene is advantageous in such a device as the influence of electrical polarisation is significantly less than the direct gate - molecule coupling that determines the performance of a transistor . for the single and double gated smt @xcite as illustrated in fig .",

    "gold was chosen as the generic electrode material to ensure minimum contact resistance and good electrical conductivity at this temperature of operation .",
    "the equivalent capacitance network for the single and double gated devices were illustrated in fig .",

    "[ fig.1](e ) respectively which describes the nature of electrostatic coupling between the molecule and different electrodes .",
    "details of the capacitance estimation methods were described at a later stage of this article .",
    "the charging energies of this system was estimated by performing ab - initio calculations based on stokbro s method @xcite using the commercial atomistic toolkit package ( atk 11.2.3 ) made by the quantum wise division @xcite .",
    "this self - consistent calculations were performed using a nonspin - polarised dft framework under the local density approximation ( lda ) where the wave functions were expanded in double-@xmath7 polarised ( dzp ) basis set .",
    "considering the metal electrodes as equipotential surfaces , neumann boundary conditions were used while solving the poisson s equation assuming the perpendicular component of the electric field stays at zero at the interfaces , details of which could be found here @xcite .",
    "the island - s / d electrode separation was chosen to be large enough so that calculations can be performed in the weak coupling limit as it is possible to estimate the molecular energy states accurately when incoming electron gets sufficiently enough time to stabilise on the molecule , hence carrying no information about its initial or final states . in such a device , electronic transport is only possible when an electron can be moved from the highest occupied molecular orbital ( homo ) level to the lowest occupied molecular orbital ( lumo ) level and the minimum energy needed for this is called as the additional energy ( @xmath8 ) which can be expressed by , @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the number of electrons in the neutral state of the molecule .",
    "in fig .  [ fig.2](a ) , the total energy of the molecule in the smt environment has been estimated for different charge states ( @xmath11 ) as function of the backgate voltage ( @xmath12 ) for a fixed top - gate voltage @xmath13 = -8v .",
    "a part of the total energy ( @xmath14 ) is contributed by the metallic reservoir potential (= @xmath15 ) where @xmath16 is the work function of the metal electrode , which for the present case of au electrode is 5.28 ev .",
    "for all the charge states , @xmath14 showed monotonic dependence with the gate excitation . for the positive charge states ,",
    "the total energy gets reduced at negative gate voltages and the situation is opposite for negative charge states where positive gate voltage reduces @xmath14 .",
    "this happens due to the stabilisation of the positive charge states at @xmath17 and vice - versa for the negative charge states at @xmath18 which can be explained from the relative orientation of the molecular energy levels for different backgate voltages . under the application of a @xmath18",
    ", the lumo level goes below the fermi level ( @xmath19 ) of the electrode and this allows the transfer of an additional electron to the molecule and it becomes more negatively charged .",
    "however for @xmath17 , the homo level gets shifted towards a higher energy level and in this case , an electron moves from the molecule to the electrode making it more positively charged .    for investigating further dependence of @xmath14 with @xmath12 ,",
    "the energy can be analytically fitted by a @xmath20 order polynomial as , @xmath21 where coefficients @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the fitting parameters which for the present case were estimated to be @xmath22 = 0.224 and @xmath23= 0.01 ev@xmath24 .",
    "the @xmath20 term in the eqn .",
    "[ eqn.2 ] is proportional to @xmath11 which is due to the strong coupling of the backgate electrode to the molecule and the value of @xmath22 is a measure of the strength of coupling between them .",
    "the final term in eqn .  [ eqn.2 ] indicates the influence of the electrical polarisation of the molecule and is independent of the charge states .",
    "since the molecule stays flat parallel to the dielectric surface and hence the difference of the electric field experienced by different atoms is minimal and this term has a smaller contribution compared to the @xmath20 term as supported by @xmath25 .",
    "the values of @xmath22 and @xmath23 stay almost constant for different charge states and the dependence of @xmath26 with the charge states was illustrated in fig .",

    "the linear slope indicates that only in the presence of a @xmath13 , adding or removing a charge from the molecule at a specific state will have identically opposite influence on the zero - term in energy .    for investigating further dependence of the total energy on @xmath12 and the conduction behaviour , the charge stability diagrams ( also called as coulomb diamond plot )",
