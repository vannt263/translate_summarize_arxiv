    "motion of a test particle around a black hole is a very old topic of investigation to know the behavior of the gravitational field around black hole(for example [ 1 - 3 ] and any other book on general relativity ) .",
    "such investigation was started long back when within a year of publication of general theory of relativity by einstein(1915)[4 - 7 ] , schwarzchild [ 8 ] gave a vacuum solution to the einstein field equations .",
    "the solution describes the geometry of vacuum space - time outside a spherical massive body and is known today as schwarzchild black hole solution . at present in all text books on general relativity",
    "there is an exhaustive study of the motion of a test particle around the schwarzchild black hole(see for example [ 1 - 3 ] ) . in the present work",
    ", an investigation of the motion of a test particle is done around a general static non - rotating black hole .",
    "a general formula for determining bending of light is evaluated and is tested for schwarzchild black hole.gravitational field outside the black hole is approximated by pseudo - newtonian(pn ) gravitational potential and is compared with the corresponding effective potential for test particle motion .",
    "finally all results are verified for reissner - nordstrm black hole solution .",
    "+ the paper is organized as follows : section ii deals with the motion of a massive test particle around a general spherically symmetric non - rotating black hole . also effective potential , energy and condition for circular orbit are determined for the black hole .",
    "further some comments are presented point wise . in section iii trajectory of a photon and bending of light is studied .",
    "pseudo - newtonian gravitational potential is determined and it is compared with effective potential in section iv . as an example",
    "all results are deduced for reissner - nordstrm black hole in section v. the paper ends with a short conclusion in section vi .",
    "the line element of a static spherically symmetric space time which describes a black hole can be written as , @xmath0 where @xmath1 is at least a @xmath2 function and it should satisfy the following conditions so that line element ( eq.1 ) describes a black hole solution : i ) @xmath1 must have a zero at some positive r ( say @xmath3 ) so that time dilation is infinite at @xmath3 , ii ) the kretschmann scalar ( @xmath4 ) should be finite at @xmath5 but it diverges at @xmath6 i.e. the space time described by equation ( 1 ) has curvature singularity only at @xmath6 . here @xmath7is the metric on unit two sphere .",
    "suppose we consider the motion of a test particle of rest mass m around the black hole .",
    "the corresponding lagrangian will be @xmath8 where @xmath9 is any affine parameter .",
    "+ as the lagrangian has two cyclic co - ordinates @xmath10 and @xmath11 so the corresponding momenta must be constant .",
    "this leads to @xmath12 a constant and @xmath13 is also a constant .",
    "as the space - time is spherically symmetric so the motion is always confined to a plane which for convenience chosen to be the equatorial plane @xmath14 .",
    "the explicit form of the momentum components are @xmath15 @xmath16 @xmath17 @xmath18 using the above expressions for momentum components in the energy momentum conservation relation @xmath19 we obtain @xmath20 where @xmath21 is called the ( square of the ) effective potential .",
    "+ now differentiating both sides of equation ( 7 ) we have @xmath22 also from ( 5 ) the momentum in the @xmath11 direction gives @xmath23 so eliminating the affine parameter between @xmath24 and @xmath25 the differential equation of the trajectory of the particle in the equatorial plane is given by @xmath26\\ ] ] which can be written as @xmath27 where @xmath28    we can make the following conclusions on the trajectory of the particle : + @xmath29 the energy of the particle should not be less than the potential @xmath30 i.e. for a given @xmath31 the trajectory should be such that the radial range is restricted to those radii for which @xmath32 is smaller than @xmath31 .",
    "+ @xmath29 if @xmath33 for all values of @xmath34 then the particle comes from infinity and moves directly to the origin .",
    "this is called the terminating escape orbit .",
    "+ @xmath29 if @xmath35 has one positive zero then the particle either starts from finite distance moves directly to the origin ( known as terminating bound orbit ) or it may move on an escape orbit with a finite impact parameter @xmath36 .",
    "if @xmath35 has two positive zeros then we have two possible cases : i. if @xmath33 between the two zeros then the trajectory is called periodic bound orbit like planetary orbit or ii . if @xmath37 between these two zeros then the trajectory is either an escape orbit or a terminating bound orbit .",
    "+ @xmath29 the points where @xmath38 are known as turning points of the trajectory i.e. the value of r which satisfies @xmath39 are turning points and eq.(13 ) determines the potential curves .",
    "+ @xmath29for circular orbit @xmath40 we have from ( 9)@xmath41 i.e. circular orbits are possible for those radial co ordinates which correspond to maximum ( unstable ) or minimum(stable ) of the potential .",
    "thus for circular orbit we must have @xmath42",
    "to determine the photon trajectory we shall proceed as before . here from the energy momentum conservation relation we have    @xmath43    i.e. @xmath44 is the ( square of the ) effective potential . so differentiating both sides we get@xmath45 thus the differential path of a light ray is given by @xmath46}}\\ ] ] where @xmath47 .",
    "now for photon circular orbit we have @xmath48 i.e. the radius of the circular orbit satisfies @xmath49 one may note that the radius of photon circular orbit is independent of the angular momentum of photon .",
    "in particular , for a schwarzchild black hole the radius of photon circular orbit is @xmath50 .for an ingoing photon choosing @xmath51 we have @xmath52}}\\ ] ] where @xmath53 .",
    "+ note that if @xmath54 is a constant then @xmath55 has the solution @xmath56 ( choosing the constant to be unity ) a straight line .",
    "this is expected as f(r)=constant means the space time is minkowskian ( having no gravitational effect ) and photon trajectory will be straight line .",
    "further we see that at large distance ( small @xmath57 ) the gravitational field due to the black hole will be negligible so we may expand @xmath54 in a power series of u i.e. @xmath58 so keeping up to first order in @xmath57 we have from @xmath55@xmath59}}\\ ] ] let @xmath60 then @xmath61 .",
    "then the above differential equation becomes @xmath62 so on integration , @xmath63 if we choose @xmath64 as the initial incoming direction of light i.e. @xmath65 as @xmath66 and as in the approximation @xmath67 corresponds to the smallest @xmath34 that photon can travel then @xmath68 so the angle of deflection is @xmath69 , as the photon comes from infinity to the point of closest approach .",
    "hence the total deflection would be @xmath70 .",
    "therefore , considering the straight line path the net amount of deflection will be @xmath71 if we take schwarzschild solution then we have @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "further , if it so happen that @xmath74 then we choose @xmath75 . using the transformation @xmath76 the net amount of deflection will be given by @xmath77",
    "based on a general heuristic method([9 ] ) , the pn gravitational potential can be defined as @xmath78 where , r is the usual radial co - ordinate and @xmath79 is the general relativistic specific angular momentum i.e. @xmath80 is the ratio of the conserved angular momentum and energy per particle mass , related to the circular geodesic in the equatorial plane .",
    "+ in newtonian theory , the gravitational potential @xmath81 is given by @xmath82 with @xmath83 , the newtonian angular momentum per mass of the particle moving in the circular orbit .",
    "the motivation of choosing pn potential ( 27 ) is to match the newtonian angular momentum per particle mass on a circular orbit with the general relativistic angular momentum . in the present study , the general",
    "relativistic conserved angular momentum and energy per particle mass for circular orbit are given by ( from equations ( 13 ) and ( 14 ) ) @xmath84^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\ ] ] and @xmath85}}\\ ] ] i.e. @xmath86 hence from ( 27 ) the pn gravitational potential is @xmath87 where the constant of integration c is determined from the known result of the schwarzchild black hole as follows:(note that c has no physical meaning ) + for schwarzchild black hole , the well known paczyski - witta gravitational potential([10 ] ) is @xmath88 substituting in eq.(31 ) we get @xmath89 and hence the pn gravitational potential for a general spherically symmetric black hole described by eq.(1 ) is @xmath90\\ ] ] as for static radius @xmath91 gravitational potential should be zero so from ( 33 ) we have @xmath92 .",
    "hence from equations ( 28),(29 ) the circular orbit of the test particle exist for radius @xmath93 in the range([11 ] ) @xmath94 where @xmath95 satisfies @xmath96 i.e. @xmath95 is the photon circular orbit .",
    "thus all circular orbits of the test particle are lower bounded by the photon circular orbit and are extended upto the static radius .",
    "+ further , from eq.(33 ) we see that the pn potential diverges at the event horizon ( i.e.@xmath97 ) reaches its maximum value at @xmath98 ( where@xmath99 ) and then decreases for @xmath100 i.e. the gravitational field corresponding to pn potential become repulsive for @xmath100 . also if the metric(1 ) becomes asymptotically flat(i.e .",
    "@xmath101 as @xmath102 ) then @xmath103 asymptotically([11],[12 ] ) .",
    "moreover , for central gravitational fields , if we assume that the motion of the test particle is confined to the equatorial plane then for keplarian motion along the radial direction gives @xmath104 where e stands for total pn energy per particle mass and @xmath105 stands for pn effective potential per particle mass having explicit form ( [ 13 ] ) @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the pn gravitational potential given by eq.(33 ) and @xmath108 is the pn angular momentum per particle mass .",
    "thus circular keplarian orbits are characterized by the extrema of @xmath105(i.e.@xmath109 ) and we have @xmath110^{2}}\\ ] ] which can be written as ( using eq.s ( 28 ) and ( 29 ) ) @xmath111 the corresponding expression for energy is @xmath112\\ ] ] using @xmath113 it can be written as @xmath114\\ ] ] it is to be noted that angular momentum per particle mass is same for both general relativity as well as for pn effective potential theory .",
    "+ we shall now examine the stability of circular orbits studied above . as stability criteria is determined by the extrema of the effective potential @xmath105 , so we have @xmath115 for stable circular orbit and @xmath116 for unstable circular orbit . due to identical nature of @xmath79 both gr and",
    "pn potential theory have same criteria for stability",
    ". further , inner and outer marginally stable circular orbits corresponds to extrema of @xmath117 and we have @xmath118^{2}=f(r)\\left[3f'(r)+rf''(r)\\right]\\ ] ] hence for stability one should have @xmath119^{2}<f(r ) \\left[3f'(r)+rf''(r ) \\right]\\ ] ] finally , from the above expressions ( eq.s ( 36 ) and ( 38 ) ) of @xmath117 and @xmath120 we have the following observations : + @xmath121 at the event horizon(@xmath97 ) both @xmath117 and @xmath120 diverge while @xmath113 and @xmath122 exist if @xmath123 $ ] is positive definite .",
    "for example in case of schwarzchild - de sitter space time([11 ] ) they become finite while for our reissner - nordstrm black hole ( see next section ) they do not exist .",
    "+ @xmath121 at the static radius ( @xmath124 ) both @xmath117 and @xmath120 vanish while @xmath113 and @xmath122 depend on choice of @xmath1 .",
    "+ @xmath125 at the photon circular orbit ( @xmath126 ) both @xmath122 and @xmath113 diverge while @xmath127 and @xmath79 is finite there .",
    "+ thus we conclude that both in pn approach and in relativistic approach the circular orbits are bounded from above by static radius while bound from below by event horizon in pn approach and that by the radius of photon orbit in relativistic approach .",
    "this is due to the fact that we do not get photon circular orbit in pn approach([11 ] ) .",
    "for reissner - nordstrm(r - n ) black hole solution we have @xmath128 where m being the mass and q the charge of black hole .",
    "so for horizon we have @xmath97 i.e. @xmath129 black hole solution exists for @xmath130 and we have event horizon at @xmath131 and @xmath132 corresponds to black hole cauchy horizon .",
    "when @xmath133 then both the horizons coincide and it is the case of extremal black hole .",
    "the static radius is given by ( @xmath124 ) @xmath134 the radius at which @xmath135gives the solution@xmath136 one may note that @xmath137 so both the static radius and @xmath138 lie inside the event horizon . hence they have no physical significance for r - n black hole .",

    "finally , for stable circular orbit we have @xmath158",
    "in this work we give a general formulation of the trajectory of a test particle ( or a photon ) around any spherically symmetric black hole in four dimensional space time .",
    "we also classify the trajectories by studying the possible positive zeros of the function @xmath28 so once @xmath1 is given for a given black hole we can immediately tell the trajectories of a test particle or a photon around it . in the pn approach physical parameters for circular orbits are evaluated and are compared with the corresponding quantities in relativistic treatments .",
    "stability condition for the circular orbits are determined and bounds of the marginally stable circular orbits are compared in both formalism . as an example",
    "we have applied our results for r - n black hole solution .",
    "+ it is to be noted that the above analysis of the trajectory is not restricted to einstein gravity , it can also be applied to any black hole solution in a modified gravity theory .",
    "further our analysis can be extended to any higher dimension .",
    "for example , the metric ansatz for a @xmath159 dimensional black hole is written in the form @xmath160 where @xmath161 is the metric on unit @xmath162 sphere and is given by @xmath163 @xmath164 then due to spherical symmetry of the space time the motion of a test particle can be restricted to the equatorial plane defined by @xmath165 . as before energy @xmath31 and",
    "the angular momentum @xmath166 are two conserved quantities and the differential equation for the path of the test particle becomes @xmath167\\ ] ] where @xmath168 or @xmath169 for photon or massive particle .",
    "finally , one may note that throughout our calculations we have not used any specific gravity theory .",
    "so if we have a black hole solution given by equation ( 1 ) not only in einstein gravity but also in any other gravity theory , the above analysis of the trajectory of a test particle is valid .",
    "moreover from equations ( 56 ) and ( 57 ) , we may conclude that above analysis of particle trajectory can be extended to any dimension of space time .",
