    "the information is synchronized with the help of a gps clock and regrouped in bins .",
    "the south pole is out of reach for most communication satellites and high bandwidth connectivity is available only for about 6 hours per day .",

    "the receiving system parses the message and forwards information on the supernova candidate event to the international snews group . the time delay between photons hitting the optical module and the arrival of the datagram at snews stands at about , providing close to real - time monitoring and triggering . due to satellite bandwidth constraints ,",
    "the data are re - binned in intervals and then subjected to a statistical online analysis ; the fine time information in intervals is transmitted for a period starting 30 s before and ending 60 s after a trigger flagging a candidate supernova explosion .",
    "several effects contribute to the prevailing low noise rate of 540 hz : a poissonian noise contribution from radioactivity , atmospheric muons and remaining thermal noise , as well as correlated noise from cherenkov radiation and scintillation originating in the glass of the photomultiplier and the pressure vessel .",
    "it is suspected that residual @xmath8 and @xmath9 decays from trace elements in the uranium / thorium chain powers cerium - based scintillation , causing a series of pulses .",

    "thanks to the tight quality control , the average noise rates between doms vary only by 10% .    the expected signal sensitivity in icecube is somewhat reduced due to two types of correlations between pulses that introduce supra - poissonian fluctuations .",

    "the artificial deadtime suppresses - but does not completely remove - the effect .",
    "this leads to a broadening of a factor of @xmath35 in the standard deviation of single photomultiplier tubes w.r.t . to the poissonian expectation",

    "the slope of the rising neutrino flux following the collapse can be used to distinguish both hierarchies in a less model dependent way for distances up to 6 kpc at 90% c.l . as in the case of the inverted hierarchy",
    ", coherent neutrino oscillation will enhance the detectable flux considerably .",
    "a strikingly sharp spike in the @xmath49 flux , detectable by icecube for all stars within the milky way , would provide a clear proof of the transition for neutron to a quark star as would be the sudden drop of the neutrino flux in case of a black hole formation .",
    "further optimizations may be applied to the data acquisition and analysis in the future , e.g. by incorporating a more sophisticated method to remove correlated noise , by excluding the bin - by - bin contribution of measured cosmic ray muon hits to the rate measurement , by storing time stamps of all hits in case of a significant alarm to e.g. improve on the timing resolution , and by employing temporal templates in likelihood or cross - correlation studies .",
