    "diffusive shock acceleration ( dsa ) is one of the most favourable mechanisms to reproduce the energy spectrum of observed cosmic rays ( for a review , see drury 1983 ) .",
    "shock waves accompanied by the magnetic fields with small fluctuations ( alfvn waves ) are well established in space plasmas and operate as a powerful accelerator of charged particles @xcite . in earlier works ,",
    "substantial efforts were devoted to studies of acceleration by the simple ` parallel shocks ' in which both the magnetic field and the direction of plasma flow are parallel to the direction of shock propagation @xcite . at the parallel shock fronts ,",
    "all upstream particles are advected into the downstream region , gyrating around the mean magnetic field .",
    "according to the conventional resonant scattering theory , a particle with its gyroradius comparable to the turbulent alfvn wavelength is resonantly scattered and migrates back upstream after many times of small - angle scattering .",
    "cosmic ray particles acquire their energies in the process of transmission back and forth across the shock .",
    "since the particles gain only a small amount of kinetic energy in each traversal of the shock , the acceleration efficiency depends largely on the rate of shock crossing of the particles .",
    "relating to particle acceleration in the solar wind and the earth s bow shock , the more general ` oblique shocks ' , across magnetic field lines , have been studied @xcite .",
    "some researchers have argued that the acceleration efficiency is enhanced in oblique shocks , compared with that in parallel shocks @xcite . if the particle momenta along the magnetic field , @xmath0 , are larger than a critical value , the particles gain energy solely via successive transmissions through the shock front , just as in the case of parallel shocks .",
    "however , when the value of @xmath0 is smaller than the critical value , upstream particles can not penetrate into the downstream region with stronger magnetic field and are reflected back into the upstream region with weaker field , having their pitch angles reversed .",
    "on the basis of the conservation of magnetic moment , the turnover point of the pitch angle is determined by the ratio of the upstream / downstream magnetic field strength .",
    "this ` mirror reflection ' results in significant reduction of acceleration time .",
    "quite efficient acceleration is expected , in particular , for quasi - perpendicular shocks with larger inclination of magnetic field lines .",
    "it was also pointed out that the acceleration time for oblique shocks could be reduced owing to the anisotropy of the particle diffusion coefficient @xcite . the effective diffusion coefficient involved in the dsa time - scale",
    "can be represented by the tensor component normal to the shock surface , @xmath1 , which is decomposed into components parallel ( @xmath2 ) and perpendicular ( @xmath3 ) to the magnetic field ( see also section 2.1 ) . in the special case of parallel shocks",
    ", the effective diffusion coefficient reduces to @xmath4 . in the ordinary case of @xmath5 , reflecting one - dimensional ( 1d ) properties in the conventional magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) description @xcite , the value of @xmath6 decreases as the magnetic field inclination increases , and in perpendicular shocks , @xmath7 . within the dsa framework",
    ", the smaller value of @xmath6 leads to a shorter acceleration time , and thereby a higher acceleration efficiency .    summarizing the above discussions , in oblique shocks there exist two possible effects contributing to the reduction of acceleration time : mirror reflection at the shock surface , and diffusion anisotropy . in previous works ,",
    "these contributions were comprehensively treated with the ` oblique effect ' . in the present paper",
    ", we investigate the contribution of these effects separately and reveal which of these two effects contributes more dominantly to the acceleration time over the whole range of field inclination . for this purpose",
    ", we derive the expression for the acceleration time with and without the effects of mirror reflection . presuming that no particles are reflected at the oblique shock",
    ", we estimate the acceleration time _ without mirror effects _ , though still including the effects of diffusion anisotropy . to our knowledge , so far there has been no publication that quantitatively reveals the effects of anisotropy on the reduction of acceleration time for oblique shocks . here",
    "we demonstrate that mirror reflection makes a dominant contribution to the rapid acceleration for highly inclined magnetic fields , whereas anisotropic diffusion becomes effective at smaller inclination angles .",
    "in the following description , we use a unit system in which the speed of light is @xmath8 .",
    "upstream and downstream quantities are denoted by the indices i=1 and 2 , respectively .",
    "the subscripts @xmath9 and @xmath10 refer to the mean magnetic field , and subscript n refers to the shock normal .",
    "the subscripts @xmath11 indicate the processes of particle interaction with the shock : @xmath12r for reflection and @xmath1212 ( 21 ) for transmission of the particles from region 1 ( 2 ) to region 2 ( 1 ) . for non - relativistic flow velocities , calculations related to particle energy gain",
    "are performed up to first order in @xmath13 , where @xmath14 , and @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the flow velocity in the shock rest frame and the magnetic field inclination to the shock normal , respectively .",
    "to evaluate the dsa time - scale of cosmic rays , we need their spatial diffusion coefficient . according to the tensor transformation",
    ", the effective diffusion coefficient for the shock normal direction can be expressed as @xcite @xmath17 without going into the details of the scattering process , here we make use of the empirical scalings @xcite @xmath18 here , the scaling factor @xmath19 reflects the energy density of the mean to fluctuating magnetic fields , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 is the bohm diffusion coefficient , where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the gyroradius and speed of a test particle , respectively .    making the assumption that the magnetic moment of the particle is approximately conserved during the interaction with the discontinuous magnetic field at the shock front , we consider the situation in which small fluctuations are superimposed on the mean regular field , i.e. @xmath24 , in the vicinity of the shock ( free crossing limit ) .",
    "on the other hand , in the case of @xmath25 ( diffusive limit ) , the fluctuations significantly affect the coherent gyromotion of the particle , and precise numerical simulations are required @xcite . for @xmath24",
    ", we have the relation of @xmath26 .",
    "this means that , for large angles @xmath27 , the term involving @xmath3 becomes dominant on the right - hand side of equation ( 1 ) .",
    "thus , one finds that larger values of @xmath28 and @xmath16 are likely to lead to a shorter acceleration time .",
    "here it is noted that the acceleration time can not be infinitesimally small , because of the limits of @xmath6 and @xmath16 ( see section 2.2 ) .",
    "the parallel / perpendicular diffusion of cosmic rays in turbulent plasmas is a long - standing issue and is not yet completely resolved .",
    "analytic models are consistent with neither observations @xcite nor numerical simulations @xcite over a wide energy range .",
    "this situation has changed since the development of non - linear guiding centre theory ( nlgc ) by @xcite .",
    "recent calculation of the nlgc diffusion coefficient suggests reasonable values of @xmath29 for the typical solar wind parameters @xcite , which can be accomodated with the free crossing limit ( @xmath24 ) . in many astrophysical environments ,",
    "the perpendicular diffusion of cosmic rays still remains uncertain and is commonly inferred from fluctuations of the turbulent magnetic field .",
    "we will discuss this point in the conclusions .",
    "as long as the values of @xmath28 can be regarded as constants , the present consequences concerning the acceleration time are generic , apparently independent of the type of turbulence . however , for an application , when evaluating the maximum possible energy of a particle by equating the acceleration time with the competitive cooling time - scales , one should pay attention to the fact that , in general , @xmath28 depends on the ratio of @xmath22 to the correlation length of turbulence , deviating from the simplistic scaling @xmath30 @xcite . here , note that , in the bohm limit with @xmath31 , the above dependence is found to be weak , so as to appear as logarithmic . for the present purpose , below , we assume @xmath28 to be a constant much larger than unity , reflecting weak turbulence , and thereby larger anisotropy of diffusion .      following the kinematic approach developed by @xcite , for instruction we outline the derivation of the acceleration time for an oblique shock including the effects of both mirror reflection and diffusion anisotropy .",
    "for convenience , the energy and momentum of a test particle are transformed from the upstream / downstream rest frames to the de hoffmann - teller ( ht ) frame @xcite .",
    "since the particle kinetic energy is invariant in the ht frame , where electric fields vanish , one can easily estimate the energy gain of the particle during the interaction with the shock , presuming the conservation of magnetic moment of the particle .",
    "finally , all variables are transformed back to the original rest frames .    in the ht frame , if the cosine of particle pitch angle , @xmath32 , is in the range @xmath33 , the upstream particles are reflected at the shock surface . here",
    ", @xmath34 gives the critical value , where @xmath35 for the fast - mode oblique shock . in this case",
    "we have the following ratio of particle kinetic energies : @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the particle energies ( in the region 1 rest frame ) before and after reflection , respectively , and @xmath39 . if @xmath40 , the particles are transmitted to region 2 . in this case",

    "the cycle time can be written in the form @xmath49 where @xmath50 $ ] denotes the mean residence time in region @xmath51 and @xmath52 is the probability for process @xmath11 .",

    "the value of @xmath72 is smaller than that of @xmath73 .",
    "relating to the reduction of @xmath74 , we note that @xmath6 involved in the acceleration time ( equation 6 ) can take a value in the range @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the phase space density of particles .",
    "this inequality just reflects the condition that the diffusion velocity of particles must be larger than the shock speed .",
    "thus , the requirement that the gyroradius can not exceed the characteristic length of the density gradient @xmath77 , recasts the above condition into @xmath78 @xcite .      following the procedure explained above",

    "the latter comes directly from exclusion of mirror effects .",
    "the factor @xmath90 reflects the anisotropy of particle velocity , involved in the mean residence time @xmath91 .",
    "although in the evaluation of @xmath74 this factor was canceled out by the same factor from the expression for @xmath48 , in the present case it is not cancelled , because of the independence of @xmath92 in @xmath87 .",

    "the upper dotted curve denotes the acceleration time without mirror effects normalized by that for a parallel shock : @xmath100 the favoured reduction of the acceleration time for @xmath101 stems from the effects of diffusion anisotropy .",
    "it is noted that , for @xmath101 , the reduction of the shock normal component of the particle velocity , @xmath102 , increases the mean residence time @xmath91 , and thus degrades the shock - crossing . as seen in fig.1",

    "for example , in the case of @xmath94 , the difference in the @xmath115 values between @xmath95 and @xmath117 is at most 4.3 per cent at @xmath118 ( not shown in the figure ) . in the special case of @xmath119 ( parallel shock ) ,",
    "the effects of both mirror reflection and anisotropic diffusion vanish , so that @xmath120 per cent irrespective of the compression ratio . as @xmath92 increases ,",
    "the values of @xmath115 increase monotonically , and reach nearly 100 per cent at @xmath121 ( quasi - perpendicular shock ) .",
    "as would be expected , the contribution of mirror effects is larger in a stronger shock . for the @xmath94 case",
    ", the @xmath115 value reaches 50 per cent at @xmath122 and exceeds 80 per cent at @xmath123 .",
    "on the other hand , for @xmath109 ( weak shock limit ) , @xmath124 per cent can be achieved at @xmath125 .",
    "the difference in @xmath115 for the strong shock case from that for the weak shock case is more pronounced in relatively low inclination angles .",
    "it is also found that , in the range @xmath126 , the @xmath115 values merely vary slightly for @xmath127 . anyway , we can claim that the mirror reflection is effective in quasi - perpendicular shocks .",
    "for a non - relativistic , fast - mode oblique shock accompanied by weak mhd turbulence , we have quantitatively revealed the contribution of magnetic mirror effects and anisotropic diffusion effects to the reduction of the acceleration time of cosmic ray particles .",
    "we found in particular that , in the strong shock limit , for a magnetic field inclination angle ( to the shock normal ) of @xmath128 , mirror effects contribute dominantly to the reduction of the acceleration time ; whereas , for @xmath129 , anisotropic diffusion effects contribute dominantly to that time . in the small-@xmath92 region , the contribution rate of mirror effects",
    "is found to be small , but sensitive to the shock strength , such that a larger shock compression leads to a more enhanced contribution rate .",
    "while these consequences can be directly referred to the study of oblique shock acceleration in space and heliospheric environments , one should be a little more careful for an application to other objects , including supernova remnants .",
    "we also remark that the perpendicular diffusion of cosmic rays is still not well understood in many astrophysical aspects . in a common approach",
    ", the diffusion coefficient is related to the spectral intensity of magnetic field fluctuations .",
    "for example , spectral analysis of fluctuations in the solar corona shows that , in the region of the heliocentric radius of @xmath130 , the power - law indices can be fitted by @xmath131 , which can be approximated by @xmath98 for the kolmogorov turbulence , and in the @xmath132 region , @xmath133 , which can be approximated by @xmath134 for the bohm diffusion limit @xcite . in interplanetary gas clouds ( extrasolar planetary systems ) ,",
    "the power spectrum has also been characterized in analogy with the description of kolmogorov turbulence @xcite .",
    "although fluctuations have been confirmed in such various objects , this does not always mean that the estimated values of @xmath28 are pertinent to the present scheme .    in young shell - type supernova remnants ,",
    "especially , strong amplification of downstream magnetic field has been confirmed by recent observations ( e.g. bamba et al .",
    "2003 , vink & laming 2003 ) .",
    "filamentary structures of hard x - rays are interpreted as evidence of shock modification predicted by the non - linear theory ( e.g. berezhko , ksenofontov & vlk 2003 , berezhko & vlk 2004 , vlk , berezhko & ksenofontov 2005 ) , and analytical studies and numerical simulations of plasma instability @xcite .",
    "the expected @xmath28 values of these sources are of the order of unity , which arguably leads to effective acceleration , though the present formalism breaks down in the diffusive limit of @xmath135 , where the magnetic field inclination fluctuates largely , to be ambiguously defined .",
    "moreover , it is not appropriate to use the unperturbed trajectory of the guiding centre drift motion as an approximation while particles are reflected at the shock surface by magnetic mirroring .",
    "the relevant issues , departing from the free crossing approximation , are beyond the scope of this paper .",
