    "in the original , or `` standard '' , scheme of laser wakefield acceleration ( lwfa )  @xcite , a laser pulse of duration smaller than a period of plasma oscillation @xmath6 excites a wake electron plasma wave ( wakefield ) with a phase velocity close to the speed of light [ here and elsewhere , @xmath7 is the electron plasma frequency , @xmath8 is the electron plasma density , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the electron mass at rest and charge ] .",
    "when the electron density perturbation exceeds the background density , the accelerating electric field of the nonlinear wake can reach tens of gv / m , which is by three orders of magnitude higher than that can be achieved in the conventional accelerators without material breakdown . to excite such a wakefield , a short laser pulse of very high intensity",

    "hence , the observed energy gain of electrons injected in the wake was moderate in spite of a high accelerating gradient . also ,",
    "very narrow plasma wake driven by a tightly focused laser is ineffective for trapping and acceleration of injected electrons : the scale of radial variation was considerably smaller than the axial wavelength , and most of the electrons were expelled by strong radial electric fields .",
