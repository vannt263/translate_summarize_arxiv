    "the irac and mips images have a small field - of - view , while the _ herschel _ images are dominated by emission from interstellar material in the perseus arm which makes it hard to find emission - free regions .",

    "we have chosen to subtract these backgrounds from the images before convolution of all images to the 500@xmath3 m resolution .    to compare the emission of casa across all wavebands in an unbiased way , we convolved all ir / submm images to the same resolution , which was chosen to be the resolution of the spire 500@xmath3 m image ( fwhm = 36.3@xmath17 ) .",

    "for the sed modelling procedure described in section [ dustsed ] , we need to know the uncertainty on the flux in every pixel .",
    "these uncertainties determine how well the model fits the observations , and play an important role in setting the uncertainties on the contributions from different emission components .",
    "the main uncertainties are due to errors on the determination of the background levels , calibration uncertainties and uncertainties in the synchrotron subtraction .",
    "the background uncertainties are driven by both large scale background variations and pixel - by - pixel noise .",
    "the two independent background errors are computed as the standard deviation of the mean background values derived for different background regions and the mean of the standard deviation of the pixel - by - pixel variation in different background regions , respectively .",

    "it is , therefore , of interest to compare the flux measurements reported by to this work for the same aperture .",
    "while the pacs70@xmath3 m photometry is consistent within the error bars ( @xmath43=179@xmath4411 jy here and @xmath43=169@xmath4417 jy from ) , the other pacs photometric measurements published by ( @xmath45=192@xmath4419 jy , @xmath46=166@xmath4417 jy ) are 17.7@xmath5 and 29.7@xmath5 lower compared to the values derived here . in the 160@xmath3 m channel we might expect an opposite trend due to the optical field distortion that was not applied in ` hipe ` 12 and all earlier versions ( which caused an overestimate of the flux by 6 - 7@xmath5 ) .",
    "we believe the flux difference can mainly be attributed to the different data reduction techniques that were used to process the data . while the first ` hipe ` versions only allowed one to reduce data with the standard map making tool ` photproject ` , the latest version of the data reduction was performed with ` scanamorphos ` . while ` photproject ` applied a high - pass filtering technique to remove the 1/f noise ( mainly due to data with low spatial frequencies or large scale emission features in the maps ) , ` scanamorphos ` does not make any specific assumptions to model the low frequency noise and takes into account the redundancy of observations . `",
    "scanamorphos ` has been shown to give a better estimate of the background level in pacs maps compared to the ` photproject ` map - making algorithm which can remove or underestimate the emission of extended structures .",
    "given that the field around casa is populated with extended emission originating from ism dust , we believe that the discrepancy between fluxes is largely due to different estimates of the background levels .    in the spire wavebands ,",
    "our integrated fluxes are also higher by 8.3@xmath5 , 17.8@xmath5 and 12.2@xmath5 compared to the values published by ( @xmath47=168@xmath4417 jy , @xmath48=92@xmath4410 jy , @xmath49=52@xmath447 jy ) , but close to being consistent within the error bars . based on the spire beam areas that were assumed during the early days of _ herschel _ observations ( 501 , 944 and 1924 arcsec@xmath50 at 250 , 350 and 500@xmath3 m , respectively , ) compared to the more recent estimates ( 464 , 822 and 1768 arcsec@xmath50 )",

    "several pixels show an offset between observations and model up to -50@xmath5 .",
    "given that the offset arises in regions where the ism contribution is low , and the model overestimates the ism dust emission in those regions , we do not believe that this discrepancy will affect the determination of the sn dust mass in casa .          in this section",

    "based on local variations in @xmath58 in the areas surrounding casa ( see fig .",
    "[ ima_casa_interstellar ] , left panel ) it is however likely that regional variations occur , which might have an effect on the sn dust temperatures and dust masses derived for casa .",
    "the three sets of sed models that were run for @xmath58 = 0.3@xmath27 , 0.6@xmath27 and 1.0@xmath27 give an idea of the influence of the variation in radiation field illuminating the ism material on the sn dust mass and temperature estimates .",
    "we have not considered the results of ism models with a stronger isrf ( i.e. , @xmath58@xmath331.0@xmath27 ) due to an overestimation of ir - submm fluxes for casa upon scaling these ism dust model seds to the spire500@xmath3 m flux ( after subtraction of the synchrotron radiation ) .",
    "the best fitting sn dust masses and temperatures derived for these three sets of sed models can be examined in tables [ table_sedfit_resolved ] and [ table_sedfit_global ] for the spatially resolved and global sed fits , respectively .    comparing the sed fitting results for different isrfs",
    ", a general trend emerges that ism models with lower dust temperatures ( corresponding to lower @xmath58 ) yield larger sn dust masses , which trivially follows from the reduced ir / submm emission of ism dust and is compensated for with an increase in the sn dust emission at those wavelengths .",
    "figure [ ima_casa_resolvedsed_maps_g0 ] demonstrates how the derived sn dust temperatures , and consequently the sn dust masses , are sensitive to the radiation field that is assumed to illuminate the ism dust .",
    "the overall distribution of sn dust temperatures within casa is similar for the three models regardless of the isrf scaling factor . but with cold sn dust temperatures ranging from 20k to 40k ( middle panels ) , the total dust mass can differ by factors of a few .",
    "more specifically , we derive dust masses of 1.4m@xmath0 , 0.5m@xmath0 and 0.2m@xmath0 from the resolved sed maps assuming that the warm and cold sn dust is composed of mgsio@xmath15 grains with ism dust illuminated by a radiation field g=0.3g@xmath72 , 0.6g@xmath72 and 1.0g@xmath72 , respectively . similarly , the resolved sed fitting procedure for a mg@xmath64sio@xmath65 dust composition results in dust masses of 0.9m@xmath0 , 0.3m@xmath0 and 0.1m@xmath0 for different isrfs , respectively .",
    "the sn dust masses derived for a g=0.3g@xmath72 ism model exceed the maximum dust masses ( 0.4 - 1.4m@xmath0 and 0.3 - 0.9m@xmath0 for mgsio@xmath15 and mg@xmath64sio@xmath65 dust ) derived from the metal production predicted by nucleosynthesis models ( under the assumption that all the metals are locked in dust grains ) , and are therefore considered unrealistic .",
    "given the uncertainties on the nucleosynthesis models @xcite and the mass of the progenitor , we argue that the condensation of 0.3 - 0.5m@xmath0 ( for a 0.6g@xmath72 ism model ) or 0.1 - 0.2m@xmath0 ( for a 1.0g@xmath72 ism model ) of dust in casa is reasonable .    based on a total ejecta mass estimate of 2 - 4m@xmath0 derived both from x - ray observations of casa and kinetic arguments to determine the mass and explosion energy from optical observations @xcite , these dust masses imply that the condensation of elements has been extremely efficient .",
    "given that the progenitor has been predicted to have had a mass of 23 - 30 m@xmath0 , the total ejecta mass could be larger than 4 m@xmath0 , with the missing gas mass in the form of clumped neutral gas , which might also harbour the detected cold dust in the ejecta .",
    "alternatively , most of the initial stellar mass might have been lost by the progenitor prior to explosion with estimated values of the swept - up mass of @xmath18m@xmath0 up to possibly 20m@xmath0 .",
    "we have shown that the ism dust model with @xmath58 = 0.6@xmath27 most closely resembles the isrf along the sight line of casa ( based on sed fitting in the surrounding regions of casa , and a pdr analysis of submm emission lines ; see figures [ ima_casa_interstellar ] and [ ima_pdr_results ] , respectively ) .",
    "we therefore attach more weight to the sn dust masses of 0.5m@xmath0 ( mgsio@xmath15 ) , 0.3m@xmath0 ( mg@xmath64sio@xmath65 ) and 0.5 - 0.6m@xmath0 ( carbonaceous grains ) derived from sed models with @xmath58 = 0.6@xmath27 ism dust models . due to possible variations in the isrf along the line of sight",
    ", we can not rule out that the local radiation field near casa is closer to the solar isrf which would imply sn dust masses of 0.1 - 0.2m@xmath0 .",
    "being conservative , we can conclude that the mass of dust produced in casa is between 0.1 and 0.6m@xmath0 and likely consists of a combination of mostly silicate - type ( mgsio@xmath15 or mg@xmath64sio@xmath65 ) grains and some form of carbonaceous dust .",

    "the high level of polarisation ( 30@xmath5 ) of sn dust found by @xcite seems hard to explain in the framework of our model with a sn dust flux of only 0.4jy . if the polarised emission would instead come from ism dust , it surpasses the average intrinsic dust polarisation of 12@xmath5 measured by @xcite .",
    "the alignment of dust grains in the ism surrounding casa might be stronger than usually found in the diffuse ism , which might provide a possible explanation for the high degree of polarisation .",

    "given that we already derive a large sn dust mass ( 0.4 - 0.7m@xmath0 ) making a 0.4jy flux contribution at 850@xmath3 m , it seems highly unlikely that the model sn dust flux could be increased without invoking unrealistically high sn dust masses .",
    "we furthermore reject a scenario in which the offset at 850@xmath3 m is caused by model deviations from the galactic ism dust emission , given that the small relative offsets between the best fitting ism dust models and the observed pacs 100 and 160@xmath3 m and spire 250 , 350 and 500@xmath3 m data points are within the observational uncertainties .",
    "we thus argue that the missing emission at 850@xmath3 m most likely arises from synchrotron radiation . using a power law index of -0.54 determined based only on _ planck _ data ( see section [ sect_synchr ] ) would be sufficient to increase the synchrotron radiation at 850@xmath3 m to 37.6jy .",
    "the updated model for a mgsio@xmath15 warm+cold sn dust composition and ism model with @xmath58=0.6@xmath27 predicts 850@xmath3 m contributions of 7.9jy and 0.5jy from ism and sn dust emission , which would result in a total modelled flux at 850@xmath3 m of 46jy , consistent with the observed scuba850@xmath3 m ( 50.6@xmath445.6jy ) and _ planck _",
