    "a number of smgs that display no agn signatures in the rest - frame optical @xcite were classified as agns based on x - ray observations @xcite .",
    "this is likely due to geometrical effects in which the broad - line region of the agn remains hidden in the optical by intervening obscuring material . at high x - ray energies ,",
    "direct x - ray emission is detectable through even very high column densities , allowing the direct detection of agn at very high obscurations .",

    "a similar mix of agn and starburst activity is seen in local ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs , with total ir luminosities l@xmath18 l@xmath19 ; @xcite ) , most of which have been shown to be composite agn ",
    "starburst systems ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the smgs have ir luminosities which are comparable to ulirgs at low redshift , prompting the question as to whether smgs are high - redshift analogs of ulirgs and hence whether we can learn about the physical processes within smgs from studies of local ulirgs ( @xcite ) .",
    "the potential presence of luminous compton - thick agns ( n@xmath20@xmath17 ) in those smgs with no x - ray agn signature remains a significant caveat to these results .",
    "furthermore , the samples of smgs with the necessary ultra - deep x - ray observations to reveal the presence of highly obscured agn are still small .",
    "hence it is possible that a small fraction of luminous , but compton thick , agn lurk within the smg population ( see @xcite ) .",
    "rest - frame optical emission provides direct insight into the stellar emission and ionized gas of a galaxy , but suffers from obscuration due to intervening dust . at longer wavelengths",
    ", the mid - ir emission arising from the dust itself provides an indirect insight into the dust - enshrouded nature of smgs and suffers from much less obscuration than the shorter , optical wavelengths .",
    "we therefore designed a program to follow up a large sample of 24 smgs in the mid - ir using _ spitzer _ s infrared spectrograph ( irs ; @xcite ) in an effort to answer the following questions for a large and representative sample of the smg population : are smgs composite agn ",

    "the continuum emission at longer mid - ir wavelengths , @xmath21 m , arises from emission by very small grains of dust ( vsg ; @xmath22 nm ) found around obscured agn or star - forming regions .",

    "the smgs in our program were selected from the sample of 73 spectroscopically - confirmed , radio - identified smgs in c05 .",
    "we aimed for full coverage of the range in redshifts , radio , submm and total ir luminosities present in the c05 sample ( see fig .",
    "[ c05 ] ) to build a sample representative of the radio - identified smg population in general .",
    "the smgs in our sample have optical redshifts @xmath33 , radio and submm fluxes @xmath34jy@xmath35jy and @xmath36 mjy@xmath37 mjy ( c05 ) , and ir luminosities @xmath38l@xmath39l@xmath19 , where the latter are based on the bolometric values reported by c05 , corrected down by a factor of two , following @xcite .",

    "24@xmath4 m observations were not available at the time of the proposal , we estimated @xmath40 m fluxes for the smgs in c05 from fitting the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) to the radio ( 1.4ghz ) , submm ( @xmath41 m ) and available optical photometric data points ( see c05 and references therein ) .",
    "we assumed a power - law fit , @xmath42 , to the mid - ir with @xmath43 .",
    "we note that selection of @xmath40m - bright sources ( albeit estimated ) may introduce a two - sided selection effect .",
    "selection based on bright @xmath40m - fluxes will preferentially pick out the hot dust emission in agns .",
    "however , at redshifts @xmath10 , the @xmath44m - pah feature is redshifted onto the @xmath40m - band : this is a prominent emission feature , associated with star formation activity and will result in a boosted @xmath40 m flux .",

    "we observed all our targets using the low - resolution ( @xmath47126 ) long - low ( ll ) observing module of irs .",
    "the slit width for this module is @xmath48 , which corresponds to roughly 90kpc at @xmath49 , and so each target is fully enclosed in the observed slit and is thus treated as a point source . with shared coverage of the first ll order ( ll1 : 19.538.0@xmath50 m ) and the second ll order ( ll2 : 14.021.3@xmath4 m ) we aimed to cover rest - frame emission longwards of 6@xmath4 m to search for pah emission and for any silicate absorption at 9.7@xmath4 m . with a redshift range of @xmath513.2 for the full sample ,",
    "the ll1 irs module alone provides the relevant coverage for smgs with @xmath52 ; while the ll2 module is also required for smgs with @xmath53 .",
    "we observed each target at two different nod positions for a total integration time of 12 hours with each module .",
    "the data were obtained between august 2005 and june 2006 .",
    "we reduced the data using the _ spitzer _ irs s14 pipeline . to ensure homogeneity throughout the sample , we reprocessed the raw data from our earlier results @xcite , which had been processed by the s13 pipeline .",
    "we performed additional cleaning of the 2d spectra using the _ ssc _ utility irsclean to remove rogue pixels , by creating a mask for each astronomical observing request ( aor ) .",
    "we use the rogue pixel mask associated with the observing cycle as a base and then identify additional deviant pixels in a _ superdroop _ file resulting from the averaging of all droop files within a single aor .",
    "we relied on differencing between the two nod positions to subtract the residual background . to do this ,",
    "we median - combined all cycles for science images of a given smg with the same module order ( ll1 or ll2 ) and nod position . for each module order",
    ", we then subtracted the median of all science images at one nod position from that of the other nod position .    for each ll order",
    ", we used the spitzer irs custom extraction ( spice ) software to extract flux - calibrated 1d spectra from each 2d sky - subtracted median - combined nod .",
    "we used the _ optimal extraction _ mode included in spice .",
    "optimal extraction entails taking a weighted average of profile - normalized flux at each wavelength to increase the _ s / n _ in irs observations of faint sources @xcite . flux calibration is based on observations of a standard star during the same observing cycle as the science observations and has a 10% uncertainty ( see irs data handbook for details ) .",
    "the spice - extracted 1d spectra for the different nods within one ll order were then averaged together .",
    "we combined the orders using iraf to produce a final spectrum for each target , excluding the noisy edges at @xmath54 m and @xmath55 m .",
    "the resulting spectra are shown in fig .",
    "[ spectra ] .",
    " continued .",
    "the spectra in fig .  [ spectra ] show a range of emission and absorption features .",
    "one of the key advantages of our survey over previous studies is the availability of spectroscopic redshifts for the entire sample from c05 . with spectroscopic redshifts in - hand",
    ", we have a - priori knowledge of the observed wavelengths where emission and absorption features are expected .",
    "we therefore identified pah features , silicate absorption centered at @xmath56 m and a number of possible forbidden narrow emission lines , such as [ arii ] ( @xmath57 m ) and [ siv ] ( @xmath58 m ) .",
    "we see that a large fraction of our sample shows pah emission features and we mark these and the other spectral features on fig .  [ spectra ] .",
    "we fit our spectra to derive quantitative estimates of the strength of the emission and absorption features and determine their precise wavelengths .",
    "however , given our modest integration times ( table  [ obstab ] ) , we reach a signal to noise ( _ s / n _ ) of only 15 in the continuum emission at @xmath40m - window of @xmath59 m on the individual nod - subtracted 2d spectra ] . at this _",
    "s / n _ we found that intricate spectral fitting programs ( e.g.  pahfit ; @xcite ) are not appropriate .",
    "we thus adopted a simple and straight - forward fitting approach which we describe below .",
    "measurements of fluxes and equivalent widths ( ew ) of features in the spectra require that we first determine the continuum level for each spectrum before measuring the strength of each individual emission and absorption feature .",
    "the resulting ew and flux measurements are extremely sensitive to the fitting method selected , particularly in the determination of the continuum level .",
    "a number of alternative fitting methods have been used by different authors , making a fair comparison of pah strengths in different samples a rather subjective and delicate issue @xcite .",
    "in particular , the prevalence of interactive fitting methods has further complicated the reproducibility of mid - ir properties between samples . hence in this work",
    "we have adopted a method of continuum and pah fitting that ensures complete reproducibility . moreover , in order to make fair comparisons between the smgs in our sample and other low- and high - redshift sources , we have re - measured all the mid - ir features in all of these samples using our method . we have applied our method to local ulirgs from the bright _ iras _ sample studied by @xcite and @xcite , the low - redshift nuclear starburst - dominated galaxies presented by @xcite and the mid - ir selected high - redshift sources of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we note that within the context of pah luminosities and ews , we only include into our discussion those objects for which we could distinguish the pah features .",
    "as we mentioned earlier , we have also included in our comparisons the 13 smgs in the goods - north field studied by @xcite , nine of which have optical redshifts measured by c05 and thus naturally complement our sample .",
    "the thermal mid - ir continuum , arising either from starburst or agn activity can be described by a power - law , @xmath60 , where the power - law index @xmath61 indicates the steepness of the spectrum .",
    "flatter mid - ir continua with low power - law indices ( @xmath62 ) are usually associated with unobscured agns , where emission from the hot dust close to the agn is readily observed .",
    "steeper continua ( @xmath63 ) are on the other hand associated with starburst activity , but can also be found in dust - obscured agns .",
    "hence we determined the power - law continuum index @xmath61 for the spectra in our sample to : ( 1 ) characterize the continuum slope and investigate the underlying energetics , and ( 2 ) to define the continuum level on which pah emission features are superimposed .    to determine @xmath61 we use the @xmath64 minimization idl routine linfit to obtain the best linear fit to each smg spectrum in @xmath65@xmath66 space .",
    "we first obtain the best linear fit to each full spectrum and calculate the rms in the ( data @xmath67 fit ) residual spectrum .",
    "then , we identify those wavelength regions in the original spectrum where the data points lie more than @xmath68 the rms away from this first linear fit . in this way , we automatically identify the wavelength regions where emission and absorption features are present .",
    "we then perform a second round of linear fitting , where we exclude these wavelength regions from the fit .",
    "we adopt the results of this second fit as our final continuum , with the influence of emission and absorption features minimized .",
    "the resulting fits to the continuum for each spectrum are shown in fig.[spectra ] .",
    "having determined the continuum , we search for the presence of pah emission features at 6.2 , 7.7 , 8.6 , 11.3 and 12.7@xmath4 m . since our objects cover a range in redshifts of @xmath693.2 , the wavelength coverage varies from @xmath70@xmath71 m for the lowest redshift smg to @xmath725@xmath73 m for that with the highest redshift . out of all",
    "detected smgs in our sample , @xmath7490% cover of the @xmath75 m region of the spectrum , thus providing a large sample of 21 smgs to investigate the spectral features within this important wavelength region .",
    "we define a wavelength window around each spectral feature and use the iraf task splot to fit the pah features with individual gaussians , where the center and fwhm are left as free parameters within the fitting window .",
    "we create a cursor file specifying the fitting windows and continuum level for each spectrum to automate the fitting process and avoid the lack of reproducibleness inherent to other interactive fitting tasks .",
    "the wavelength regions used to fit the 6.2 , 7.7 , 8.6 , 11.3 and @xmath76 m pah features were approximately 5.906.60 , 7.108.3 , 8.308.90 , 11.0011.60 , 12.4013.00@xmath4 m , respectively .",
    "we adopt the splot output uncertainties in the resulting pah ews and integrated fluxes , which account for the noise level present in the spectra .",
    "these results are presented in table [ resultstab ] .",
    "we take advantage of the pah features in our spectra to determine mid - ir redshifts for the smgs in our sample . for this",
    "we derive a redshift associated to each pah feature from its observed central wavelength .",
    "the final pah - based redshift for spectra displaying multiple pah features corresponds to the weighted mean of the redshifts derived from the individual pah features , where the weights are provided by the pah fitting uncertainties .",
    "we present these results in  [ redshifts ] .",
    "finally , we quantify the strength of the silicate absorption . we define the optical depth as @xmath77 $ ] , where @xmath78 is the flux level observed at @xmath79 m and @xmath80 , the interpolated flux of continuum in the absence of any absorption .",
    "we measure the latter from our power law continuum fit . in  [ tau ] we present the resulting values for the smgs in our sample that provide sufficient wavelength coverage for a reliable determination of the continuum .      in the interest of obtaining a representative spectrum for the sample as a whole , with a higher _ s / n _ to enable identification of fainter underlying features , we also median - combined the individual rest - frame spectra of the smgs in fig.[spectra ] into a composite spectrum .",
    "the full collection of individual spectra in our sample cover the rest - frame wavelength range @xmath8122@xmath4 m . to avoid being overly biased towards the mid - ir properties of smgs within a narrower redshift range ,",
    "we only include in the composite spectrum wavelengths covered in _ at least _ five smgs .",
    "the individual spectra in fig .",
    "[ spectra ] also display a significant spread in rest - frame continuum level with @xmath820.2mjy and so we normalize them by their flux at a rest - frame wavelength of 8.5@xmath4 m .",
    "only the spectrum of smmj221733.12 does not cover this wavelength and is thus excluded from the composite .",
    "the final composite spectrum thus includes 22 detected smgs and is shown in fig .",
    "[ smgcomposite ] . the sample standard deviation of the composite spectrum increases towards longer wavelengths , in part reflecting the fact that fewer individual spectra contribute at @xmath83 m . to better demonstrate the redshift ranges which contribute to the different wavelength regions in the composite ( and their variations ) we divide our sample into three different redshift bins and construct composite spectra of low- , intermediate- and high - redshift smgs ( see fig .  [ smgcomposite ] ) and discuss these in  [ smgcomp ] .",

    "we follow the method described above to construct composite spectra of subsamples of smgs based on @xmath40m- and radio brightness to search for trends within our sample . however , composite spectra based on apparent brightness mix sources with different intrinsic luminosities at different redshifts .",
    "we attempt to minimize this bias by first defining luminosity - complete subsamples of smgs , then restrict the smgs included in each composite to those that fall within a redshift range where we are close to complete in terms of mid - ir and radio luminosity . at the median redshift of our sample , @xmath84",
    ", the observed @xmath40 m flux corresponds to redshifted rest - frame @xmath85 m emission .",

    "this additional warm continuum may be associated to obscured agn activity or to an additional starburst continuum component .",
    "we derive an upper limit to the contribution from an agn to the smg mid - ir spectrum by making the conservative assumption that this additional continuum arises uniquely from a dust - enshrouded agn .",
    "hard x - rays emission provides one of the most direct routes to estimate the luminosities of agn .",

    "an alternate probe for agn emission is the mid - ir emission from hot dust near the agn .",

    "we use the derived correlation for seyfert galaxies to estimate the x - ray luminosity of the agn component in the smg composite spectrum and hence gauge the agn contribution to the bolometric luminosity of smgs .    from the @xmath198 m continuum flux and the krabbe et al .",
    "relation we estimate an x - ray luminosity , @xmath200erg s@xmath9 , for the smgs in our sample at @xmath201 .",
    "encouragingly , this estimate is in close agreement with the absorption - corrected rest - frame 0.58kev x - ray luminosities found for the smgs in the _ chandra _ deep field @xcite , @xmath202 erg s@xmath9 . to assess the contribution of the agn to the energetics of the smgs we first estimate the far - ir luminosities of the smgs using the observed radio  far - ir correlation for smgs @xcite , yielding an average far - ir luminosity of @xmath203erg s@xmath9 .",
    "we then use the approach of @xcite and @xcite , and adopt the x - ray - to - fir luminosity ratio typically found for quasars ( @xmath204 ; @xcite ) to estimate that the agn in smgs contribute @xmath205% of the smg s far - ir luminosities or @xmath206erg s@xmath9 .",
    "we emphasize that this agn contribution estimate is a strong upper limit for the smg population .",
    "considering that the enhanced continuum in the mid - ir bright composite suggests that our selection criteria may bias us towards an increased agn contribution within our sample ( see  [ radioand24umcomp ] ) , the agn contribution estimate based on the smg composite is likely biased high .",
    "it is also very likely that some fraction of the red continuum unaccounted for by the local starburst template arises from dust emission heated by optically - thick starbursts in smgs , particularly considering the high mid - ir power - law index , @xmath197 , in the range associated with regions dominated by star - formation .",
    "therefore , we quote 32% as a firm upper limit on the agn contribution to the bolometric luminosity in typical smgs .    with an smg composite dominated by pah features ,",
    "it is clear that the bolometric luminosity of smgs is in general dominated by star - formation .",
    "however , the individual mid - ir smg spectra display modest variation in agn contribution and in some cases can reveal the presence of an agn that remains invisible at other wavelengths ( see table  [ signtab ] ) .",
    "in particular , there is evidence that smmj123553.26 is a compton - thick agn .",
    "this smg is undetected in the x - ray but is bright and dominated by continuum emission in the mid - ir , thus displaying no mid - ir signatures of star formation ( see fig.[spectra ] ) .",

    "however , we note that this smg lies very close to a second radio source ( @xmath212 ) , which complicates the deblending of the individual flux contributions in mips @xmath40m - imaging @xcite .",
    "we detect a single continuum trace in the irs 2d spectrum that , even though it coincides with the position of smmj123553.26 , likely corresponds to the blending of the mid - ir emission of both sources .",
    "therefore , it remains a possibility that the measured mid - ir flux of this source does not correspond to the x - ray source .",
    "we compare the ir luminosity associated with the agn component in the smg composite to that of obscured extremely luminous quasars at @xmath213 studied by @xcite .",
    "since the latter have been shown to have @xmath214 of their bolometric luminosity arising from starburst activity , it is reasonable to assume that the bulk of their ir luminosity arises from agn activity .",
    "we find that the ir emission contributed by the agn in smgs is roughly 10% the ir luminosity of these luminous quasars .",
    "since the bolometric luminosities in these two samples are similar , the respective agn contributions to the total ir luminosity conform with the evidence that these two populations are dominated by different power sources .",
    "furthermore , this demonstrates that systems dominated by star - formation , such as smgs , may attain as high luminosities as agn - dominated systems at high redshift .      with a sample of 23 detected smgs in this work , plus nine from @xcite and 13 from @xcite",
    ", we have statistics that allow us to uncover the range in mid - ir properties present within the smg population .",
    "the majority of smgs display prominent pah features atop an underlying weak power - law continuum , potentially arising from an agn .",

    "we note that 25% of the smgs in our sample lie at redshifts @xmath216 , which is a redshift range not covered by the other smg mid - ir studies .",
    "this extension to lower - redshifts provides us with an insight into the smg emission at the longer mid - ir wavelengths , @xmath217 m . in fig.[smgcompositebrandl ] we can see that it is at these longer wavelengths where the local starburst template becomes increasingly insufficient to account for the smg mid - ir emission and where the additional continuum component becomes increasingly significant .",
    "coverage of this wavelength region within our sample is thus crucial to compare the composite smg spectrum with potential local analogs and hence to assess the agn contribution , which we measure to be @xmath21832% of the bolometric luminosity .",
    "coverage out to these longer wavelengths is also critical for better constraining the mid - ir continuum slope , giving additional insight to the nature of the underlying power engine based on the measured steepness of the mid - ir spectrum .",
    "improved continuum constraints allows us in turn to quantify the strength of the 9.7-@xmath4 m silicate absorption and investigate the distribution of silicate dust in smgs , compared to other galaxy populations ( see  [ dust ] ) .",
