    "let @xmath0 be a distance - regular graph with adjacency matrix @xmath4 and @xmath5 distinct eigenvalues .",
    "in the recent work of brouwer and the author @xcite , we studied the situation where the distance-@xmath1 graph @xmath6 of @xmath0 , or kneser graph @xmath3 , with adjacency matrix @xmath7 , has fewer distinct eigenvalues . in this case",
    "we say that @xmath0 is _ partially antipodal_. examples are the so - called half antipodal ( @xmath3 with only one negative eigenvalue , up to multiplicity ) , and antipodal distance - regular graphs ( @xmath3 being disjoint copies of a complete graph ) . here",
    "we generalize such a study to the case when @xmath0 is a regular graph with @xmath5 distinct eigenvalues .",
    "the main result of this paper is a characterization of partially antipodal distance - regular graphs , among regular graphs with @xmath5 distinct eigenvalues , in terms of the spectrum and the mean number of vertices at maximal distance @xmath1 from every vertex .",
    "this can be seen as a general version of the so - called spectral excess theorem , and allows us to characterize those distance - regular graphs which are half antipodal , antipodal , bipartite , or with kneser graph being strongly regular .",
    "other related characterizations of some of these cases were given by the author in @xcite .",
    "for background on distance - regular graphs and strongly regular graphs , we refer the reader to brouwer , cohen , and neumaier @xcite , brouwer and haemers @xcite , and van damm , koolen and tanaka @xcite .",

    "@xmath19 , introduced by the author and garriga @xcite , are a sequence of orthogonal polynomials with respect to the inner product , normalized in such a way that @xmath20 .",
    "then , it is known that @xmath0 is distance - regular if and only if such polynomials satisfy @xmath21 ( the adjacency matrix of the distance-@xmath22 graph @xmath23 ) for @xmath24 , in which case they turn out to be the distance polynomials .",
