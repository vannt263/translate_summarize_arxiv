    "there has been a major research effort in recent years to understand the properties of high - temperature superconductors which have been discovered during the eighties .",
    "high - temperature superconductors belong to the class of superconducting materials known as type ii that allow for partial magnetic flux penetration whenever the external field satisfies @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the flux penetrates the sample in the form of flux - lines ( fl s ) , each containing a quantum unit @xmath4 of flux . at low temperature the fl s form",
    "an ordered hexagonal lattice ( abrikosov lattice ) due to their their mutual repulsion . at high temperature and/or magnetic field",
    "this lattice melts due to thermal fluctuations @xcite .",
    "high - temperature superconductors are anisotropic materials which are made from stacks of superconducting layers associated with copper - oxide planes",
    ". the layers are weekly coupled to each other .",
    "the parameter measuring the anisotropy is @xmath5 , defined as @xmath6 , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 denote the effective masses of electrons moving along the @xmath9 axis ( perpendicular to the superconducting planes ) and the @xmath10 plane , respectively .",
    "while for the material yba@xmath0cu@xmath11o@xmath12 known as ybco the anisotropy is somewhere between 5 - 7 , for the material bi@xmath0sr@xmath0cacu@xmath0o@xmath1 known as bscco , the anisotropy is estimated to be between 10 to a 100 times larger .    for bscco and highly anisotropic materials similar to it , each fl is represented more faithfully by a collection of objects referred to as pancake vortices or just `` pancakes '' @xcite .",
    "pancakes are centered at the superconducting planes .",
    "each pancake interacts with every other pancake , both in the same plane and in different planes .",
    "the interaction can be shown to consist of two parts .",
    "the first part is called the electromagnetic interaction ( or simply magnetic ) and it exists even in the case that the layers of the material are completely decoupled , so no current can flow along the @xmath9-axis of the sample .",
    "the electromagnetic interaction originates from screening currents that arise in the same plane were a pancake resides as well as in more distant planes .",
    "this leads to a repulsive interaction among pancakes in the same plane and an attractive interaction among pancakes in different planes @xcite .",
    "the second part of the interaction is called the josephson interaction @xcite .",
    "it results from the fact that there is a josephson current flowing between two superconductors separated by an insulator and this current is proportional to the sine of the phase difference of the superconducting wave functions .",
    "the two superconductors in the present case are the adjacent cuo@xmath0 planes .",
    "when two pancakes belonging to the same stack and residing in adjacent planes move away from each other , the phase difference that originates causes a josephson current to begin flowing between the planes .",
    "this results in an attractive interaction between pancakes that for distances small compared to @xmath13 is approximately quadratic @xcite in the distance . here",
    "we denoted by @xmath14 the inter - plane separation and @xmath5 is the anisotropy .",
    "when the two adjacent pancakes are separated by a distance larger than @xmath15 , a `` josephson string '' is formed , whose energy is proportional to its length @xcite .    in three recent papers @xcite we presented results of multilevel monte carlo simulations performed on high temperature superconductors . in the first publication @xcite both ybco and bscco were treated with and without columnar defects . in that paper",
    "we included the effect of the electromagnetic interaction only as an in - plane interaction which is valid in the approximation that the fl s do not deviate too much from a straight line and the anisotropy is not too large .",
    "this is usually the case for ybco @xcite and is justified for highly anisotropic materials if the anisotropy is not higher than about 250 , which is often not the case for bscco where for optimally doped samples one expects anisotropies in the range of 400 - 500 @xcite .    in the second paper we conducted multilevel monte carlo simulations including both the in and out of plane electromagnetic interactions plus the josephson interaction among nearest neighbor pancakes in adjacent planes .",
    "the josephson interaction is often neglected in simulations of the highly anisotropic bscco , but we showed that it is crucial to obtain the proper scaling behavior of the results and should not be entirely neglected .",
    "we also implemented periodic boundary conditions in all directions including the @xmath2 direction . in the third paper",
    "a newer approximation to the josephson coupling has been derived from a numerical solution of the two - dimensional sine gordon equation , which is meant to improve on the previous approximation introduced by ryu _",
    "_ @xcite .",
    "molecular dynamics ( md ) is a powerful tool for simulations of physical systems and it often serves as an alternative to monte carlo ( mc ) simulations .",
    "its advantage is that it can be used to investigate the real dynamics of the system as opposed to mc simulations that are used for obtaining equilibrium properties .",
    "however md simulations could be plagued by the absence of ergodicity when applied to systems represented by path integrals @xcite and there is also the problem of implementing permutations for the case of identical particles like bosons .",
    "the problem of ergodicity is really not much of an issue for langevin simulations since the thermal noise helps the system explore the configuration space and it can be shown by using the corresponding fokker - planck equation that equilibrium is reached in the long time limit . for flux - lines ( fl s )",
    "we have found a way to implement `` permutations '' in the md simulations by flux cutting and recombining as will be explained further below .",
    "we were also able to implement periodic boundary conditions in all directions ( including the @xmath2 direction ) and to include the in and out of plane electromagnetic interaction as well as the josephson interaction using the new approximation we have recently obtained @xcite .",
    "results that clearly show the first - order melting transitions in bscco for fields of 100 - 200 gauss are presented below .",
    "there is an excellent agreement with the results of our multilevel monte carlo simulations @xcite including the proliferation of non - simple loops corresponding to flux entanglement above the melting transition .",
    "at this point we should briefly discuss some previous applications of md langevin simulations for investigations of vortex - lattice phenomena .",
    "wilkins and jensen @xcite used langevin dynamics to investigate the melting transition in the presence of point disorder in layered superconductors .",
    "however they used the non - realistic gaussian potential among pancake vortices instead of the actual long - ranged logarithmic interactions derived by clem and others @xcite .",
    "they observed a signature of a first order transition that disappear completely when the disorder is strong .",
    "van otterlo _",
    "@xcite used langevin dynamics for the case of ybco where flux - lines rather than individual pancakes are the relevant dynamical variables .",
    "the electromagnetic interaction is taken only in plane and then there is the bending forces due to the line tension .",
    "the authors introduce point disorder and investigate the bragg glass to vortex glass transition .",
    "olson _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite use langevin dynamics for pancake vortices in bscco .",
    "however they take into account only the electromagnetic interaction and neglect the josephson interaction entirely , thus effectively using @xmath16 .",
    "they also do not implement periodic boundary conditions in the @xmath2 direction , nor do they implement flux - cutting and recombination .",
    "instead of varying the magnetic field they use an artificial parameter @xmath17 that changes the relative strength of the in - plane and out - of - plane interactions .",
    "however varying this parameter away from unity makes the interaction of a single pancake with a straight stack of pancakes a distance @xmath18 away different from @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "these authors are able to observe the decoupling transition of the superconducting planes that occurs at high magnetic fields .",
    "they also include the effects of point disorder and in addition they investigate the effect of a driving force , like an electric current going through the sample .",
    "@xcite use md simulations at t=0 which are therefore not of the langevin type .",
    "they implement periodic boundary conditions in all direction and include the full long ranged electromagnetic interaction but neglect the josephson coupling .",
    "they study current driven pancakes in highly anisotropic superconductors .",
    "fangohr _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite use both md langevin simulations and monte carlo to study the melting transition in highly anisotropic superconductors . as an alternative to including the full long - range electromagnetic interactions they use a mean - field approach in which the instantaneous density of pancakes in other layers than the currently simulated layer is replaced by an average density , thus leading to an effective `` substrate potential '' @xcite , that is adjusted self consistently .",
    "these authors do not include the josephson interaction .",
    "note that our results for the case of infinite anisotropy as discussed in the results section and in ref .",
    "agree with the results of this paper .",

    "the position @xmath25 is a two component vector in the plane . here",
    "we have used the over - damped model for vortex motion in which the velocity of the vortex is proportional to the applied force and @xmath26 is the viscous drag coefficient per unit length given by the bardeen - stephen @xcite expression @xmath27 with @xmath28 is the normal - state resistivity .",
    "@xmath14 is the interlayer spacing between @xmath29 planes that is taken to be equal to the width of the pancake vortex .",
    "@xmath30 is the potential energy depending on the position of all pancakes and includes both the magnetic energy and josephson energy .",
    "the force is minus the gradient of the potential energy with respect to the position of the @xmath20th pancake .",
    "@xmath31 is a driving force ( if present ) , for example the lorentz force induced by a current .",
    "@xmath32 is a white thermal noise term which satisfies @xmath33 in eq.([noise ] ) @xmath34 and @xmath35 refer to the @xmath36 and @xmath37 components of the vector @xmath38 and @xmath20 and @xmath39 are pancake labels .",
    "@xmath40 is boltzmann s constant . in our simulations we measure distances in units of @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the magnetic field .",

    "we have @xmath59  , @xmath60erg @xmath61 k / k . ref .",
    "[ ] quotes a value for @xmath26 for a single crystal bscco of around @xmath62 g/(cm s ) .",
    "based on this value the time unit is about @xmath63ns .",
    "the value of the time unit is unimportant for the results of the present paper since we report on equilibrium properties .",
    "we now discuss the expressions used for the various interactions and the methods used to implement periodic boundary conditions .      for the in - plane interaction between two pancakes one has , @xcite @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the radial distance in cylindrical coordinates .",
    "here @xmath66 is a two dimensional vector with components @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the interaction between two pancakes @xmath67 and @xmath68 is given in the case when the pancakes are situated at different planes by @xmath69 where @xmath70 , and @xmath71 .",
    "in the above equations we defined the residual interactions @xmath72 @xmath73 is some unimportant constant that cancels out upon taking energy differences . we see that @xmath74 .",
    "this form of energy can be derived either by starting from lawrence - doniach model @xcite or by following clem @xcite .",
    "we choose our simulation cell to have a rectangular cross section of size @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the number of flux lines ( number of pancake vortices in each plane ) .",
    "we usually worked with 36 flux lines .",
    "the aspect ratio of the cell was chosen to accommodate a triangular lattice without distortion , such that each triangle is equilateral . in the z - direction",
    "we take @xmath77 layers of width @xmath14 each , where in practice we have chosen @xmath78 .",
    "we now discuss how to implement periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) in all directions .",
    "let us consider first the implementation of pbc in the @xmath2-direction and later we will implement pbc in the @xmath36 and @xmath37 directions .",
    "periodic boundary conditions mean that every pancake interact not only with the actual pancakes in the simulation cell but will all their images in other cells which are part of an infinite periodic array .",
    "each image of a pancake is located at the same position in the corresponding cell as the original pancake in the simulation cell .",
    "thus it is not a reflection through a boundary .",
    "let us start with the interaction of a pancake in a certain plane @xmath23 with another pancake in plane @xmath79 .",
    "because of the pbc in the @xmath2-direction it also interact with all images of @xmath79 in positions @xmath80 where @xmath81 is an integer . thus concerning the first term in eq.([electromagnetic2 ] ) we have to evaluate the sum @xmath82 where we put @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "the dependence of @xmath85 on @xmath86 is rather weak .    for the second term we have to evaluate the sum @xmath87",
    "we now make the approximation , valid for the case when @xmath88 that the sum over @xmath81 can be replaced by an integral @xmath89 .",
    "the estimated error is small for the range of parameters under consideration .",
    "recall that for bscco , @xmath90 and it is equal to @xmath91  for the range of temperatures we work with , whereas @xmath92  for the value @xmath93 that has been used in the simulations .",
    "changing variables from @xmath81 to @xmath94 we find @xmath95 we can now change variables from rectangular @xmath96 to polar @xmath97 to get @xmath98 with @xmath99 being the modified bessel function of second kind of zero s order .",
    "the last integral was calculated by using the change of variable @xmath100 and then referring to formula 3.384/3 in ref .",
    "thus the total contribution to the out - of - plane pair interaction becomes @xmath101 it can be checked that to leading order    @xmath102    since @xmath103 . as @xmath104 , @xmath105 thus requiring that the energy to be finite in the limit @xmath106 we replace the prefactor of @xmath99 by @xmath107 , where the difference involves only higher order terms , and the correct limits are obtained both when @xmath18 is small and in the limit when @xmath18 is large and @xmath19 tends to zero .",
    "thus eq.([eq : tout ] ) is replaced by : @xmath108    we now turn to the interaction of pancakes in the same plane , again concentrating on one pancake , and its interaction with another in the same plane and all its images in other cells above or below a distance @xmath109 in the @xmath2-direction . for the images we must use the out of plane interaction . thus apart from the @xmath110 term",
    "we have the same calculation as above with only difference is that now @xmath111 .",
    "thus we get @xmath112 let us check if we get the right answer for the case of one pancake interacting with a straight stack of pancakes a distance @xmath18 away .",
    "summing all the pair interactions one obtains @xmath113 using the fact that @xmath114 one obtains @xmath115 which is the correct result for the interaction of a pancake with a straight _ infinite _ stack see ref .",
    "[ ] appendix a.    consider also a straight stack of pancakes with one pancake from the stack displaced a distance @xmath18 away .",
    "the interaction of that pancake with the rest will be in this case @xmath116 to leading order ( with correction of order @xmath117 ) , which coincides with the result obtained by clem @xcite provided @xmath73 is chosen appropriately so the energy vanishes as @xmath106 .",
    "thus far we only summed over images in the @xmath2-direction .",
    "we now have to implement the pbc in the transverse direction . in that case @xmath118 where the green s function @xmath119 satisfies london s equation @xmath120 with pbc in the rectangular cell of dimensions",
    "@xmath121 with @xmath122 .",
    "note that @xmath123 is _ not _ spherically symmetric .",
    "similarly in the case of @xmath124 one has to replace the logarithm by @xmath125 which satisfies pbc .",
    "again the expression is derived in the appendix . in this case",
    "an infinite constant independent of @xmath126 has to be subtracted to make the expression finite .",
    "our final expression for the pair energy with fully implemented pbc is @xmath127 and similarly @xmath128      in a recent paper @xcite we derived an approximation to the josephson interaction among pancakes in nearest neighbor planes .",
    "the approximation is based on a numerical solution of the nonlinear sine gordon equation in two dimensions . a string - like solution corresponding to a josephson string that connects",
    "two singularities has been investigated and its energy calculated .",
    "it is believed that the derived formula constitutes a better approximation to the josephson interaction than the one previously used @xcite .",
    "the formula obtained for the josephson interaction is @xmath129 where @xmath18 is the lateral separation of the pancakes and @xmath130 where @xmath5 is the anisotropy and @xmath14 is the inter - plane separation .",
    "since the josephson interaction is between nearest neighbor pancakes in adjacent planes it is quite straight forward to implement pbc .",
    "a pancake at the top plane ( @xmath131 ) interacts with the closest pancake in the bottom plane @xmath132 as well as with a pancake in plane @xmath133 .",
    "when calculating the lateral distance between pancakes we always measure the `` shortest distance '' defined as follows : if the actual @xmath134 separation is larger than @xmath135 we subtract or add @xmath136 depending on the sign of @xmath137 , and similarly for @xmath138 with @xmath139 replacing @xmath136 . this way the correct distance is obtained",
    "even when the adjacent pancake in the plane above has exited the simulation cell and emerged close to the other side of the simulation cell .",
    "this is because when a pancake exits the cell from one side it ( or what was its image ) enters the cell from the other side , so for the josephson interaction pancakes close to two distance boundaries can actually be neighbors .",
    "in the case of @xmath140 , string - string interactions that involve three and four - body interactions become important @xcite . however near the melting transition for the range of magnetic fields investigated in this paper @xmath141  whereas @xmath142 . thus large transverse fluctuations for which the string - string interactions become important are statistically rare and",
    "can be neglected .",
    "the simulation cell is divided into a @xmath143 mesh of small cells of area @xmath144 each where @xmath145 ( in units of @xmath146 ) , and we tabulate the functions @xmath123 and @xmath147 in each small cell thus creating two large @xmath143 matrices . during the simulations we use the tables as a lookup to calculate the pair interaction . for each table",
    "we also calculate the negative of the gradient and save the two components of the gradient in their own tables .",
    "we also tabulate the josephson interaction and its gradient . when simulating we allow pancakes to move to arbitrary real locations but in order to calculate the forces we divide the actual position by @xmath148 and round to the nearest integer to use for the lookup tables .    in each simulation step",
    "we move all the pancakes at the same time , using the instantaneous forces .",
    "this is done using a time step @xmath149 .",
    "it is very important to chose the time step correctly . consider the magnitude of the white thermal noise given in eq.([rnoise ] ) . on the average , the distance a pancake moves during a time @xmath150 is given by @xmath151 .",
    "we choose this distance to be either @xmath152 or @xmath153 as explained below .",
    "we have used two methods : first we have employed a simple euler method . for a given configuration of pancake",
    "we calculate the force on each pancake due to the pair potential due all other pancakes , both magnetic and josephson . to this force",
    "we add the constant driving force ( if any ) and the thermal noise .",
    "based on this forces we move each and every pancake simultaneously ( in parallel ) by a distance given by the total force acting on it just before the move times @xmath154 .",
    "then we calculate the new forces and repeat . at each step",
    "we generate the thermal noise by calling a gaussian vector random number generator to obtain a vector of length @xmath155 filled with random numbers ( total number of pancakes times two force components ) .",
    "the euler method works adequately but is relatively slow since in order to get good results we needed to simulate up to a time span of 72 time units or more .",
    "we found that we can improve performance by using a second order runge - kutta method .",
    "we have tried to use a forth - order method but there has been no further improvement over the second order method for reasons that will be explained below . in the second order method we use a larger time step of length @xmath156 , which is about 2.6 larger than in the euler method . in this method",
    "we first consider a virtual move of duration @xmath157 with the initial instantaneous forces , we then calculate the new forces at the end of the virtual move and we use these forces to move a full time step starting at the original initial position .",
    "the random noise is only generated once at the original point .",
    "exactly the same random noise is used both for the virtual move and for the actual move . thus the vector of random numbers is saved and used in the same order for the virtual and actual moves .",
    "of course each move now takes about twice the cpu time than before , but we gain both because the results are more accurate and because we use a larger time step that reduces cpu time for the same total time span . in this method",
    "we could get reliable results in about half to two thirds the cpu time needed for euler s method .",
    "we believe that the reason we did not get an improvement with the fourth order method is that in order to get a reduction in cpu time we need to increase the time step by at least a factor of two since each update move requires four evaluations of the forces instead of two .",
    "but for the same total time span this reduces the number of steps by at least a factor of two .",
    "this interferes with the statistics of averaging over the thermal noise since the number of steps is not large enough to get good statistics so the results are actually not as good as the results from the second order method ( for the same total time span ) .",
    "it is a nice feature of multilevel monte carlo that one can implement flux cutting and permutations @xcite , so that flux lines with pbc in the @xmath2 direction do nt end on themselves but form loops that wind more than once across the system .",
    "we term such loops non - simple or `` composite loops '' . for bosons ,",
    "the abundance of such loops characterizes the superfluid phase @xcite .",
    "they represent permutations of the particles that differ from the identity permutation .",
    "there is an approximate mapping from the world lines of bosons propagating along the euclidean time direction to fl s stretching along the @xmath2 direction @xcite . for flux - lines",
    "these composite loops represent the entangled state of the vortex liquid above the melting transition . in order for this concept to exist one must not neglect the josephson interactions even for a highly anisotropic material like bscco since it is the josephson interactions that really tie up a stack of independent pancakes into a flux - line even if loosely so since this interaction is weak .",
    "it is sometimes argued that one can not implement permutations in a molecular dynamic simulation as the motion through permutation space is discrete and molecular dynamics involves continuous evolution .",
    "however in our situation it is quite possible to introduce `` permutations '' in our system and see that they proliferate above the melting transitions .",
    "in fact the results obtained for the number of loops not ending on themselves agree amazingly well with the corresponding results from our monte carlo simulations of the same system .",
    "the way we implement `` permutations '' is through flux cutting and recombination .",
    "we assume that within the coupled - planes model , vortices may switch connections to lower their elastic energy ( in this case josephson energy ) when they cross each other @xcite . in the simulation",
    "we construct two matrices of size @xmath158 which we call the `` up '' matrix and the `` down '' matrix . for a given pancake @xmath24 in plane",
    "@xmath23 the `` up '' matrix points to the pancake in the plane @xmath159 ( or 1 if @xmath160 ) that is connected to the given pancake @xmath22 via a josephson interaction .",
    "generally this is the pancake closest to the given pancake in the next plane .",
    "the `` down '' matrix similarly points to the closest pancake below ( or in plane @xmath131 for @xmath161 ) .",
    "when we start from an initial configuration in which the fl are a straight stack of pancake the matrices simply point to the pancake just above or below a given pancake .",
    "when constructing the force matrix after each time step we check if indeed the `` up '' matrix points to the closest pancake above .",
    "if there is a closer pancake than the one given by the pointer then we find out its parent in the plane @xmath23 by using the down matrix , and we check if switching the two connections will decrease the sum of the squares of the two distances .",
    "if it does we cut and switch connections and update the `` up '' and `` down '' matrices .",
    "we term this precess an `` _ exchange _ '' .",
    "the reason we use the square of the distances is that in most instances the josephson interaction is proportional to the square of the transverse distance ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : jospot ] ) above ) .",
    "this procedure mimics the actual dynamics in which we expect the magnetic flux to choose a path that minimizes the josephson energy .",
    "we implement the flux cutting procedure after every update move of the system , but not during the virtual half - step in the runge - kutta procedure .",
    "note that the extent that flux cutting and reconnecting occurs in real experimental samples and the existence of the entangled state is still a debatable issue @xcite .",
    "flux cutting can allow an entangled state to disentangle and vice versa .",
    "our simulations show that just below the melting transition , even though some exchanges occur , they soon reverse themselves in space or in time , and thus they do not lead to what we refer to as an entangled state where composite loops or permutations are abundant . on the other hand when exchanges proliferate through the system , a phenomenon that occurs in our simulations just above the melting transition , the exchanges do not undo each other , and the system of fl s changes from being composed of simple loops each made up of a single fl , to a system composed mainly of composite loops that wind up several times around the simulation cell in the @xmath2 direction before returning to the original point .",
    "the reason that the exchanges proliferate above the melting transition is that the transverse fluctuations become strong enough to overcome the potential barriers due the repulsion among pancakes residing in the same plane and thus the crossing of fl s occur .",
    "crabtree and nelson @xcite give a rough back of the envelope estimate of the magnetic fields @xmath162 and @xmath163 such that when @xmath164 entanglement should occur in the flux liquid phase .",
    "for the system size and the values of parameters and field range that we use ( @xmath165 ) , we verified that indeed the fl liquid should indeed be entangled .",
    "it should be noted that wilkin and jensen @xcite measured flux cutting by simply observing the rate that the nearest neighbors of a given pancake in adjacent planes change during the course of a given time interval . in the liquid state",
    "many of those events occurred .",
    "however they did not implement `` exchanges '' , nor did they keep track of composite loops and their relative abundance compared to simple loops as we do in our simulations .",
    "we measured the following physical quantities . for details the reader",
    "is referred to our earlier work @xcite .",
    "the average energy was obtained by adding the electromagnetic energy of all pairs of pancakes combined with the josephson energy of nearest neighbor pancakes in adjacent planes .",
    "the translational structure factors @xmath166 is defined as ,    @xmath167    where @xmath168 stands for the time average , and @xmath169 stand for the basic reciprocal lattices vectors which are given by @xmath170 where @xmath171 or @xmath172 , @xmath173 , @xmath174 is the size of the unit cell of the triangular lattice and @xmath175 are the unit vectors along the rhombic unit cell such that @xmath176 notice that we normalized the structure factor to unity instead of @xmath76 .",
    "we actually try different orientations of @xmath177 to allow for situations that the lattice unit cell does not align with the simulation cell and numerically find the angle for which the average @xmath178 is maximal .",
    "we then record this value as the measure of translational order .      for each individual flux - line",
    "we define the position of the lateral center of mass as @xmath179 where the sum goes over all the pancake belonging to it .",
    "we then define the mean square deviations as @xmath180 where the sum is over all pancakes belonging to an individual flux - line and the average is over all flux - lines of the system and then taking a time average .",
    "the melting transition is expected to occur when this quantity satisfies @xmath181 where @xmath182 is the lindemann coefficient .",
    "as we allow for flux cutting and recombination , we can define the number @xmath183 as that fraction of the total number of fl s which belong to loops that are bigger than the size of a `` simple '' loop .",
    "a simple loop is defined as a set of @xmath131 beads connected end to end ( due to the periodic boundary conditions in the @xmath2 direction ) , @xmath131 being the total number of planes .",
    "loops of size @xmath184 , @xmath185 ... start proliferating at and above the melting temperature .",
    "parameters for bscco were taken as follows : @xmath186  , @xmath187  and @xmath188 k. the temperature dependence of @xmath45 in this work was taken to follow the ginzburg - landau convention @xmath189 .",
    "see discussion in ref .",
    "[ ] on the agreement of this choice with experiments . for the anisotropy",
    "we have used values of 250 - 400 .",
    "in this section we display some of the results for the melting transition obtained with the molecular dynamics method .",
    "the case of @xmath190 gauss and @xmath191 is depicted in fig . 1 .     and",
    "@xmath190 g. the following quantities are shown : ( a ) the translational structure factor normalized to unity , ( b ) the mean square transverse deviations about the fl s center of mass in units of @xmath192 , ( c ) the fraction of composite loops as a measure of fl entanglement , ( d ) josephson energy per pancake in units of @xmath43 .",
    "the temperature is measured in kelvin and so is the reduced temperature @xmath193 . ]    in subfigure ( a ) we see the decay of the normalized structure factor .",
    "the melting temperature is about 69k ( corresponding to a reduced temperature of 300k ) . in subfigure ( b )",
    "we observe the quantity @xmath194 defined above that measures the square of the transverse deviations from a straight line .",
    "we see that at the transition the lindemann parameter @xmath182 is about @xmath195 ( its square is about 0.06 ) . in subfigure ( c )",
    "we observe that composite loops corresponding to line entanglement start to proliferate above the melting transitions . in part ( d )",
    "we show the jump in the josephson energy corresponding to a first order transition .",
    "there is a corresponding jump in the total energy that is more difficult to observe since it is fractionally smaller .",
    "the jumps are of course smoothened by fine size effects , i.e. the fact that we have 36 fl s and 36 planes for a total of 1296 pancake vortices .",
    "the results agree with multilevel mc simulations carried by us and the fact that the fraction of non - simple loops agrees with the mc shows that `` permutations '' were implemented faithfully in the md simulations .",
    "some of our previous mc results are given in ref . .",
    "note that in that paper we used a different approximation for the josephson interaction as given by ryu _ at al . _",
    "and hence one has to adjust the values of the anisotropies in that paper by about 1.5 to correspond to the current simulation which treats the josephson interaction according to the approximation given in ref . .",
    "more recent mc are presented in ref . which uses the current scheme .",
    "in the mc simulations we investigated the finite size effects in more detail .",
    "we tried to increase the number of fls to 64 instead of 36 .",
    "we also simulated with the number of planes equal 25 , 36 and 50 .",
    "as the number of fls and planes increase the transition becomes sharper but its position does not move by more than 1k from its value for 36 fls and 36 planes which we use in the current simulations .",
    "our aim here is not to pinpoint the melting transition to a high accuracy but to have a simulation method that gives reasonable results , and can be the basis for simulations on larger systems if one needs to obtain better precision .",
    "the equilibration times in the md simulation were chosen to give a good agreement with the mc simulations .",
    "we also observed that if the equilibration time is not long enough the melting appears gradual . by increasing the simulation time the transition becomes sharper up to a point when increasing the equilibration time further has no noticeable effect on the results .",
    "that is how we fixed the equilibration time .",
    "usually it corresponds to at least 10,000 md moves ( in each move all the pancakes are moved at once ) out of which 5000 moves are discarded before the measurement process begins .     and @xmath190 g. the direction of the heating and cooling cycle is indicated by arrows . the temperature is changed by 0.5k increments.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    since the melting transition is a first order transition we expect hysteresis effects if we perform a heating an cooling cycle .",
    "the hysteresis should be enhanced by the fact that the fls in the liquid phase are entangled and it takes considerable time for them to disentangle .",
    "most of our simulations were done on a parallel machine where at each temperature we start from an ordered vortex configuration .",
    "however , in order to observe the hysteresis we carried out a heating and cooling cycle at 0.5k increments where at each temperature we started from the last configuration obtained in the previous temperature .",
    "we simulated for 72 time units at each temperature .",
    "the results for @xmath190 g and @xmath191 are depicted in fig .",
    "2 .     and @xmath196 g. the same quantities are shown as in fig.1 . ]    in fig .",
    "3 we see the melting transition for @xmath197 and as expected it occurs at lower temperature . from the figure one can read an approximate transition temperature of @xmath198 ( corresponding to a reduced temperature of @xmath199 ) . to simulate each point in the above figures took between @xmath200-@xmath201 processor - hours on a 1ghz processor .",
    "time spans were between @xmath202-@xmath203 time units ( in the units discussed in sec .",
    "2 above ) , and about half of this time was discarded for equilibration and half used for measurements .",
    "the cpu times are larger by of factor of 2 - 3 compared with the corresponding times in our multilevel mc simulations because of the need to calculate all of the forces , not just the energies .",
    "however since this method can be used to implement real dynamics in addition to the measurement of equilibrium properties only as done in mc simulations , the extra time can certainly be tolerated .",

    "notice that although we have chosen @xmath191 in order that the melting temperature for @xmath204 g will roughly agree with experimental results @xcite , the simulated melting curve is steeper than the observed experimental melting curve in pristine systems .",
    "this has been observed and discussed before @xcite .",
    "we should remember that experimental pristine systems always include a certain amount of point defects that tend to reduce the melting temperature .",
    "the effectiveness of these defects increases when the temperature is decreased and this causes the melting curve to flatten down in the experimental curves of the phase boundary in the @xmath42-@xmath205 plane as compared with the theoretical results for a defect free system . the experimental `` irreversibility line '' which lies just below",
    "the melting line is steeper and agrees better with the simulations . in ref .",
    "we also showed that when the josephson interaction is present the data for the melting line for different anisotropies collapses onto a single straight line when @xmath206 is plotted versus @xmath207 .",
    "this confirms a prediction of koshelev @xcite that when the josephson interaction is important the phase boundary is given by a single dimensionless function of the dimensionless parameters @xmath208 and @xmath209 . for @xmath16",

    "et al._@xcite and scaling is obtained when plotting @xmath210 vs @xmath211 .",
    "in this paper we have shown that molecular dynamics is a powerful tool that can be used to obtain the properties of the melting transition in a similar way to multilevel mc simulations .",
    "we showed how to implement flux cutting and recombination and obtained results showing flux - line entanglement similar to those obtained by implementing permutations in the mc simulations .",
    "we have included both the electromagnetic interaction among all pancakes and the josephson interaction among nearest neighbor pancakes in adjacent planes .",
    "we have implemented periodic boundary conditions in all directions .",
    "our next goal is to include defects , either in the form of columnar defects and/or point defects and to investigate steady - state , non - equilibrium properties of the system when a current is flowing .",
