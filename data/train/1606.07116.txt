    "kitaev s toric code @xcite is one of the most emblematic examples of topological quantum codes .",
    "it is defined by local constraints on qubits placed on a torus .",
    "the properties of the code depend on the topology of the surface .",
    "for instance , the number of encoded qubits is determined by the genus of the surface and the minimum distance is the length of the shortest cycle with non - trivial homology . such a code can be defined on an arbitrary closed surface .    for practical purposes ,",
    "a planar layout of the qubits is desirable .",
    "unfortunately , in such a case the prescription of kitaev to construct quantum codes yields a trivial code that preserves just a single state .",
    "the work of freedman and meyer @xcite and bravyi and kitaev @xcite extends kitaev s construction in two directions .",
    "\\(i ) kitaev construction can be extended to a surface with boundaries , that is a surface punctured with holes @xcite .",
    "\\(ii ) two different kinds of boundaries called open and closed boundaries ( also called rough and smooth respectively ) can be introduced along the outer boundary of a planar lattice @xcite .",
    "these modifications increase the degeneracy of the ground space of the hamiltonian , allowing for a non - trivial planar surface code .",
    "punctured planar lattices have been proposed as quantum memory or quantum computing architecture where logical operations are realized by braiding holes @xcite .",
    "understanding and optimizing their performance is a central question for the physical implementation of quantum information processing .",
    "surprisingly , mixed boundaries ( partially open and partially closed boundaries ) have been examined previously only for the outer boundary of a planar lattice as in ( ii ) , but not along all the punctures . in the present work ,",
    "we combine the two ideas ( i ) and ( ii ) , producing better surface codes .",
    "first , we introduce a family of generalized surface codes based on punctured surfaces where any holes can have partially open and partially closed boundaries .",
    "justifying the commutation relations between stabilizer generators as well as computing the parameters of these codes is non - trivial and requires an in - depth study of a notion of relative homology .",
    "we determine a closed formula for the parameters of these generalized surface codes and we describe graphically their logical operators .",
    "then , we propose a planar architecture based on holes with mixed boundaries which improves over the parameters of standard constructions of two - dimensional surface codes .",
    "we obtain a three - fold reduction of the overhead compared to the square lattice punctured with closed holes @xcite .",
    "besides providing new constructions of surface codes , the formalism developed here is necessary in order to optimize the performance of different fault - tolerant architecture . if it is clear that surface codes can make a quantum computer fault - tolerant , the details of the architecture of such a fault - tolerant quantum computer are still to be determined .",
    "optimizing the design of surface codes can lead to a much more favourable overhead .",
    "our formalism , which encompasses all the previously considered constructions of surface codes @xcite , provides an ideal framework to compare and optimize quantum computing architectures based on surface codes .",
    "generalized surface codes are defined in section  [ section : codes ] .",
    "the definition of these codes and the computation of their parameters rely on a particular notion of relative homology of surfaces with boundaries that we study in section  [ section : homology ] .",
    "finally , a planar architecture based on generalized surface codes is proposed in section  [ section : planar_codes ] .",
    "this last section , which focuses on the problem of optimizing the packing of logical qubits in a planar lattice , can be read independently .",
    "let us recall the definition of _ stabilizer codes _ @xcite . in what follows , @xmath0 and @xmath1 denote the usual pauli matrices .",
    "pauli operators are @xmath2-fold tensor products of pauli matrices @xmath3 where @xmath4 .",
    "denote by @xmath5 the set of @xmath2-qubit pauli operators .",
    "a stabilizer code of length @xmath2 is defined as the common @xmath6-eigenspace of a family of @xmath2-qubit commuting pauli operators @xmath7 .",
    "equivalently , it is the degenerate ground space of the hamiltonian @xmath8 .",
    "it is a @xmath9-dimensional subspace of @xmath10 , whenever the @xmath11 pauli operators @xmath12 are independent .",
    "the quantum code then encodes @xmath13 qubits into @xmath2 qubits and its parameters are denoted as @xmath14 $ ] .",
    "the group generated by the operators @xmath12 is denoted @xmath15 and is called the stabilizer group of the quantum code @xmath16 .",
    "assume that an encoded state @xmath17 is subjected to a pauli error @xmath18 .",
    "the system is then in the state @xmath19 .",
    "the correction procedure for stabilizer codes is based on the _ syndrome measurement _ , that is the measurement of the observables @xmath12 for all @xmath20 .",
    "these commuting operators can be measured simultaneously , providing a measurement outcome @xmath21 for all @xmath22 .",
    "the outcome of the measurement of a stabilizer @xmath12 is @xmath23 where @xmath24 is defined by the equation @xmath25 .",
    "this defines the syndrome @xmath26 . whenever the system being measured is in a state @xmath17 that belongs to the code space",
    "the syndrome is trivial .",
    "hence , a non - trivial syndrome indicates the presence of an error .    among stabilizer codes , _ css codes _",
    "@xcite are those defined by @xmath27 operators chosen from @xmath28 and @xmath29 operators chosen from @xmath30 . writing pauli errors as @xmath31 with @xmath32 and @xmath33",
    ", we see that the syndrome can be partitioned as a pair of vectors @xmath34 , where @xmath35 ( resp .",
    "@xmath36 ) contains the measurement outcomes of the @xmath27 operators of @xmath37-type ( resp .",
    "the @xmath38 operators of @xmath1-type ) .",
    "as suggested by the notation , the vector @xmath35 depends only on @xmath39 and @xmath36 depends only on @xmath40 .",
    "since quantum states are defined up to a phase , we can assume that the phase @xmath41 of the error is trivial .",
    "our goal will be to identify @xmath40 from its syndrome @xmath36 and @xmath39 from its syndrome @xmath35 .",
    "an error which has a trivial syndrome is called a _ logical operator _ or a _",
    "logical error_. these errors preserve the code space . a stabilizer , that is an element of the stabilizer group , is a particular logical operator that has a trivial action on encoded qubits . by a _ non - trivial logical operator",
    ", we mean a logical operator that is not a stabilizer .",
    "up to the stabilizer group @xmath42 , the set of logical operators , denoted @xmath43 ( for normalizer ) , is a group that has the same structure as the @xmath44-qubit pauli group .",
    "more precisely , the quotient @xmath45 is generated by @xmath46 operators @xmath47 which satisfy the same relations as the @xmath44-qubit pauli operators @xmath48 = [ p_i , q_j]$ ] .",
    "a family which satisfies these relations is called the _ symplectic basis _ of the logical operators .",
    "the _ minimum distance _",
    "@xmath49 of a stabilizer code is defined to be the minimum weight of a non - trivial logical error .",
    "it is a proxy indicator for the error - correction capability of the code .",
    "when @xmath49 is known , it is added to the parameters of the code denoted as @xmath50 $ ] . for css codes , the minimum distance is reached either by an error @xmath32 or by an error @xmath33 .",
    "one can thus obtain the minimum distance as @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the minimum weight of a non - trivial logical error @xmath32 and @xmath53 is the minimum weight of a non - trivial logical error @xmath33 .",
    "stabilizer codes and css codes can be considered as a quantum generalization of classical linear codes . the main obstacle which arises",
    "when we try to quantize a classical code construction is the constraint that stabilizers must commute . in kitaev s",
    "construction , qubits are placed on the edges of a cellulation of a surface , @xmath37-type stabilizers correspond to vertices and @xmath1-type stabilizers correspond to faces .",
    "the commutation relations are then an immediate consequence of basic homological properties ( the boundary of a boundary is trivial ) .",
    "the homology of the surface is also a crucial tool to compute the parameters of kitaev s code .    in this section ,",
    "we first introduce the surfaces that support our code construction .",
    "then , we define generalized surface codes and we state our main result which provides a full description of the parameters of these codes . the validity of the construction as well as the proof of our main result is delayed to section  [ section : homology ] through the study of relative homology .",
    "the goal of this section is to define an appropriate notion of surface in order to incorporate all extensions of kitaev s code . starting from closed surfaces , we bring two modifications .",
    "first , we authorize surfaces with boundaries .",
    "then , each edge on the boundary will be declared either open or closed .",
    "we choose the term open or closed for its topological connotation .",
    "a surface with only closed boundaries is a closed surface .",
    "those boundaries are sometimes called rough and smooth in quantum information .",
    "this notion of surface will allow us to consider a general construction of surface codes which encompasses both kitaev s original construction @xcite , its generalizations @xcite and extends it to any surface punctured with mixed holes that have open as well as closed edges on their boundaries , as one can see in figure  [ fig : surfaces ] .",
    "since it is only the combinatorial structure of the surface that plays a role in the definition of topological codes , we consider surfaces constructed by gluing a finite set of faces together along their edges in a coherent way .",
    "formally , a _ combinatorial surface _ or a simply a _ surface _ is a cellulation of a compact 2-manifold @xmath42 ( possibly with boundaries ) . in other words",
    ", it is a triple @xmath54 where @xmath55 is a finite graph embedded on the surface such that each connected component of @xmath56 is a disk which is a face @xmath57 of the cellulation .",
    "we often identify a face @xmath58 with the set of edges on its boundary , _",
    "i.e. _ we regard a face @xmath58 as a subset @xmath59 .",
    "topologically a face is a disk and its boundary is a set of edges that form a cycle in the graph @xmath60 .",
    "we assume that @xmath61 is embedded without overlapping edges or multiple edges .",
    "we also suppose that no edge belongs to the same face twice and that two faces share at most one edge .",
    "now that we have a surface @xmath62 , let us define its _",
    "boundary_. an edge of @xmath61 is defined to be a boundary if it is incident to a single face of @xmath61 .",
    "the corresponding faces are called boundary faces .",
    "the endpoints of boundary edges are the boundary vertices .",
    "we denote the sets of boundary vertices , edges and faces , respectively by @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "boundary elements will be either _ open _ or _",
    "closed_. first , a subset of edges living on the boundary of the tiling is declared to be open .",
    "once open edges are defined , a vertex of the boundary is said to be open if it is incident to an open edge .",
    "analogously an open face is a face of the boundary containing an open edge .",
    "an edge , respectively a vertex or a face of the boundary that is not open is said to be closed .",
    "this defines a partition of the boundary @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 , where @xmath68 denotes the open subset and @xmath69 denotes the closed subset .",
    "the set of non - open vertices , edges and faces are denoted respectively by @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 . by analogy with topology ,",
    "one may be tempted to define the set @xmath73 as @xmath74 .",
    "our definition makes the statements of our results simpler and emphasizes the similarities with standard results in homology .",
    "in this section we provide a unified definition for surface codes defined on surfaces with or without boundaries .    in order to construct a quantum error - correcting code from a surface @xmath62 ,",
    "we place a qubit on each non - open edge of @xmath61 .",
    "this leads to a global state living in the hilbert space @xmath75 .",
    "denote by @xmath76 , respectively @xmath77 , the pauli operator acting as @xmath37 , respectively @xmath1 , on the qubit indexed by @xmath78 and which is the identity on the other qubits .",
    "[ defi : surface_codes ] the _ surface code _ associated with the surface @xmath62 is defined to be the stabilizer code of stabilizer group @xmath79 , where @xmath80    in other words , this surface code is the ground space of the hamiltonian @xmath81 the commutation between the operators @xmath82 and @xmath83 , for all @xmath84 and for all @xmath57 , is ensured by lemma  [ lemma : boundary_composition ] .",
    "when the surface @xmath61 has no boundaries , this definition coincides with kitaev s original construction @xcite .",
    "when the surface has only closed boundaries it is freedman and meyer s generalization @xcite . finally , we recover bravyi and kitaev s construction @xcite when the surface is a sphere punctured with a single hole .",
    "our first objective is to establish a closed formula for the parameters of generalized surface codes .",
    "let us recall the key ingredients in the case of closed connected surfaces .",
    "* the rank of the @xmath1-stabilizer group @xmath85 is given by @xmath86 .",
    "* a @xmath1-error @xmath32 has trivial syndrome if and only if its support is a cycle and it is a stabilizer if and only if this cycle is homologically trivial .",
    "this proves that the minimum distance @xmath52 is the minimum length of a cycle with non - trivial homology . * replacing the graph @xmath61 by its dual exchanges the role of @xmath37 and @xmath1 , proving that @xmath53 is the minimum length of a cycle of the dual graph @xmath87 with non - trivial homology and that the @xmath37-stabilizer group has rank @xmath88    denote by @xmath89 the euler - poincar characteristic of the surface .",
    "based on the first and the third items , @xmath90 which is equal to @xmath91 when the surface is orientable and @xmath92 when it is not orientable .",
    "the minimum distance is given by the last two items as the minimum length of a non - trivial cycle of @xmath61 or its dual @xmath87 .",
    "in the presence of open and closed boundaries , these 3 items are altered .",
    "first , the rank of the stabilizer group depends on the boundaries in a non - trivial way ( see theorem  [ theo : code_parameters ] below ) .",
    "second , one needs an appropriate notion of homology that reproduces the behaviour of errors and syndrome measurements .",
    "lastly , one also needs to define a dual graph @xmath87 in such a way that graph duality coincides exactly with the duality between @xmath37 and @xmath1-errors .",
    "an important part of the present article is devoted to the study of the homology of surfaces with open and closed boundaries and to the construction of an appropriate notion of dual for these surfaces . in order to state our main result",
    ", we first provide a rough definition of these notions .",
    "rigorous definitions of these objects will be given in section  [ section : homology ] .         in order to describe the minimum distance of the code",
    ", we need to introduce a generalization of the notion of cycle for surfaces with boundaries .",
    "following bravyi and kitaev , we define a _ relative cycle _ of a surface with boundaries as a set of non - open edges which meet each non - open vertex an even number of times .",
    "three relative cycles are shown in figure  [ fig : rect_open ] .",
    "for instance , a path connecting two open vertices , like ( a ) and ( c ) in the figure , is a relative cycle though it is not a standard cycle .",
    "the support of an error @xmath39 with syndrome zero is a relative cycle since it can only be detected by measuring the operators @xmath82 associated with the non - open vertices @xmath84 .",
    "a relative cycle is said to be _ homologically trivial _ or simply _ trivial _ if it is the boundary of a subset of faces of the surface .",
    "examples of trivial and non - trivial cycles are depicted in figure  [ fig : rect_open ] . by definition of generalized surface codes",
    ", a trivial cycle induces an error @xmath39 which is a stabilizer ( again this cycle is the support of the error ) .    we will also have to extend the definition of the dual to surfaces with open and closed boundaries .",
    "inspired by the standard example of the square lattice with open and closed boundaries depicted in figure  [ fig : rect_open ]  @xcite , the dual graph will be defined in such a way that open and closed boundaries are switched under duality .",
    "this duality will be introduced and motivated in section  [ section : dual ] .",
    "our first result is a closed formula for the parameters of generalized surface codes defined on any surface , orientable or not , with boundaries or not , and where boundaries can be either open or closed .",
    "we use the notation @xmath93 for the number of connected components of @xmath61 containing no closed boundary edge @xmath94 and the notation @xmath95 for the number of connected components of @xmath61 containing no open vertex @xmath96 .",
    "[ theo : code_parameters ] the parameters @xmath50 $ ] of the generalized surface code associated with a surface @xmath62 are    * @xmath97 , * @xmath98 * @xmath99 where @xmath52 is the minimum length of a non - trivial relative cycle of @xmath61 and @xmath53 is the minimum length of a non - trivial relative cycle of @xmath87 .",
    "the first result is obvious .",
    "note that in the last item both the dual graph @xmath87 and the notion of cycle and trivial cycle are generalized to the case of surfaces with open and closed boundaries .",
    "this theorem will be proven through the study of the homology group of surface with open and closed boundaries , which is the focus of section  [ section : homology ] .",
    "it is the combined conclusion of corollary  [ coro : k ] and corollary  [ coro : d ] .    in order to avoid surface codes with minimum distance @xmath100",
    ", one can assume that any edge whose both endpoints are open is an open edge .",
    "see the remark at the end of section  [ section : dual ] .          as a first application",
    ", we find the parameters of surface codes defined over a surface punctured with open holes and closed holes .",
    "[ cor : k_uniform_surfaces ] let @xmath61 be a connected surface with @xmath101 closed - boundary holes and @xmath102 open - boundary holes .",
    "the number of logical qubits encoded in the corresponding surface code is @xmath103    as an illustration , a surface of genus 0 with 4 closed holes ( the external boundary is a closed hole ) and 2 open holes encoding @xmath104 qubits is represented in figure  [ fig : open_closed_holes ] .    if @xmath61 is an orientable surface of genus @xmath92 with no boundary , then its euler - poincar characteristic @xmath105 equals @xmath106 . for a non - orientable surface",

    "this implies that the number of open edges @xmath116 is equal to the number of open vertices @xmath117 .",
    "the terms corresponding to closed boundaries add up to @xmath118 and the contribution of open boundaries is @xmath119 overall , we obtain @xmath120 which is @xmath121 or @xmath122 depending on the orientability of the surface .",
    "this proves that the result holds .",
    "for instance , figure  [ fig : logical_punctured_2torus ] represents an orientable surface of genus 2 punctured by 2 closed holes @xmath123 and @xmath124 and 3 open holes @xmath125 and @xmath126 , resulting in a code that encodes @xmath127 logical qubits .",
