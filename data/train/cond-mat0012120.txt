    "observation of a significant discrepancy between numerical simulations and experimental results obtained for direct current ( dc ) superconducting quantum interference devices ( squids ) based on high - transition - temperature superconductors ( hts ) is one of the most important unsolved problems for hts dc squids which seriously hinders their optimization for applications @xcite .",
    "hts dc squids show frequently asymmetric behavior which may be attributed to the large spread in the critical current @xmath12 and normal resistance @xmath13 of hts josephson junctions .",
    "this may lead to asymmetric critical current @xmath14 or voltage @xmath15 vs. external flux @xmath16 characteristics of the dc squid @xcite and can affect the transfer function @xmath17 which is defined as the maximum slope of the @xmath0-curves .",
    "however , such an asymmetry has been usually neglected in numerical simulations of @xmath6 for hts dc squids .    in this paper",
    "we present a detailed study of the impact of asymmetry on the @xmath0-characteristics and in particular on the transfer function of dc squids .",
    "we first introduce the main parameters which define the asymmetric dc squid ( sec.[asymmetric dc squid ] ) .",
    "then we show that an asymmetry in @xmath12 of the two josephson junctions leads to a shift of the @xmath18- and in the @xmath0-characteristics , which can be used to determine the critical current asymmetry experimentally , as demonstrated on dc squids with @xmath4 ( ybco ) bicrystal grain boundary josephson junctions @xcite ( sec.[critical current vs. flux and voltage vs. flux characteristics ] ) .",
    "we present numerical simulation results for @xmath6 which we obtained within a wide range of parameters including the limit of large thermal fluctuations which are important for hts dc squids ( sec.[transfer function : numerical simulations ] ) , and we compare those results with experimental data on hts dc squids ( sec.[transfer function : numerical simulation vs. experiment ] ) .",
    "the asymmetric dc squid shown in fig.[f - esasymsq ] consists of a superconducting loop of inductance @xmath19 intersected by two josephson junctions with average values of critical current @xmath12 , resistance @xmath13 and capacitance @xmath20 .",
    "the asymmetry in the junction parameters is described via the asymmetry parameters @xmath1 , @xmath7 and @xmath21 , wich are defined according to @xmath22 i_{0,2}=i_0(1+\\alpha_i ) , & r_{2}=r/(1+\\alpha_r ) , & c_{2}=c(1+\\alpha_c ) , \\end{array}\\ ] ] where the subscripts 1,2 denote the parameters of the left and right junction , respectively .    throughout this paper",
    "we consider two different origins of the junction asymmetry , noting , that in real devices we may have a combination of both : ( i ) geometric asymmetry and ( ii ) intrinsic asymmetry .    in the case of geometric asymmetry",
    "we assume identical values of critical current density @xmath23 , resistance times area @xmath24 , and specific capacitance @xmath25 for both junctions . here , @xmath26 is the junction area with width @xmath27 and length @xmath28 .",
    "we then introduce an asymmetry via different values for @xmath27 , assuming constant @xmath28 . in the case of bicrystal grain boundary junctions",
    "@xmath28 equals the film thickness @xmath29 , which can be assumed to be constant in practical devices .",
    "the geometric asymmetry is then described by the asymmetry parameter @xmath30 according to @xmath31 and @xmath32 , with @xmath33 , and we find the simple relation for the asymmetry parameters @xmath34 .",
    "in the case of intrinsic asymmetry we assume @xmath35 and different values of @xmath36 and @xmath37 for the two junctions which may reflect the natural spread in junction parameters .",
    "for simplicity we neglect the spread in @xmath38 which is expected to be much smaller than the spread in @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the intrinsic asymmetry is then described by the asymmetry parameters @xmath39 and @xmath40 according to @xmath41 j_{0,2}=j_0(1+\\alpha_j ) , & \\rho_{2}=\\rho/(1+\\alpha_\\rho ) , \\end{array}\\ ] ] and we get @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 .    if we assume the scaling relation @xmath45 as derived from the intrinsically shunted junction model @xcite we derive the relations @xmath46/\\alpha_j\\quad { \\rm or } \\quad \\alpha_j=2\\alpha_\\rho/(1+\\alpha_\\rho^2 ) .",
    "\\label{eq - isj - correlation}\\ ] ]    finally , if we consider a combination of geometric and intrinsic asymmetry we can derive from the definitions of the asymmetry parameters given above the following relations between the asymmetry parameters @xmath47",
    "we derive now a very simple expression for @xmath1 , which can be used to determine its value experimentally without cutting the squid loop .",
    "let us first consider the @xmath18-characteristics of the dc squid [ c.f .",
    "fig.[f - esasymsq ] ] for @xmath48 : the maximum critical @xmath49 is maintained when @xmath50 and @xmath51 . in this case",
    "the circulating current @xmath52 is given as @xmath53 , which is flowing in the squid loop if we apply an external flux @xmath54 .",
    "hence , the maxima of the @xmath18-characteristics are shifted by @xmath55 along the @xmath16-axis , as compared to the symmetric squid with @xmath56 , where @xmath14 is maximum at @xmath57 .",
    "the same argument leads to a negative shift @xmath58 if the current direction is reversed .",
    "hence , the maxima of the @xmath18-characteristics for opposite polarity of the current are shifted by @xmath59 . using the screening parameter @xmath60 we arrive at the very simple relation    @xmath61    which is also valid for finite values of @xmath5 and for the shift of the minima of the @xmath0-characteristics measured at constant bias current @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "the clear - cut experimental determination of @xmath64 requires the measurement of @xmath0-curves at various values of @xmath3 , which can be varied by temperature .",
    "an example of such a measurement on one device at @xmath65k and 63.7k is shown in fig.[f - v_phi - curves ] .",
    "plotting the measured flux shift , normalized by @xmath66 vs. @xmath3 should give according to eq.([eq - deltaphi ] ) a linear dependence with slope 1 , with the reasonable assumption that @xmath1 does not depend on @xmath67 .",
    "fig.[f - dphi_beta ] shows the results of such measurements obtained for 6 different dc squids , where @xmath1 was obtained as a fitting parameter to give the expected slope of 1 . for comparison ,",
    "the results from simulated @xmath0-curves for various values of @xmath1 are also shown , which are in excellent agreement with eq.([eq - deltaphi ] ) .    except for one device ,",
    "these squids have intentionally been fabricated with a geometric asymmetry ( @xmath68 ) . from the known value of @xmath30 and the measured value of @xmath1",
    "the asymmetry parameter @xmath39 can be calculated using eq.([eq - alpha_ij_rrho - correlation ] ) .",
    "the results are listed in table  i. as a main result , we see that 3 squids show only a small asymmetry in @xmath36 with @xmath69 .",
    "however , for the three other devices the asymmetry in @xmath36 is significant with values of @xmath70 up to 0.4 , which demonstrates that the difference in critical current density for the two junctions can be quite large .",
    ".asymmetry parameters for various ybco dc squids .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "as already evident from fig.[f - v_phi - curves ] the asymmetry can induce distortions of the @xmath0-curves , which leads to different values of @xmath71 and @xmath72 for the maximum positive and negative slope of the @xmath0-curves , respectively . to understand the impact of the asymmetry on the transfer function we performed numerical simulations to solve the equations for the phase differences @xmath73 and @xmath74 of the two junctions @xcite over a wide range of values for @xmath3 and the noise parameter @xmath75 for both , the geometric and intrinsic asymmetry . in the latter case",
    "we assume the correlation between @xmath39 and @xmath40 as given in eq.([eq - isj - correlation ] ) .",
    "figure [ f - vphi_beta - sim_gb02 ] shows @xmath71 and @xmath72 vs. @xmath3 obtained for fixed @xmath76 for geometric and intrinsic asymmetry .    for @xmath56 we closely reproduced the results obtained in @xcite for symmetric dc squids .",
    "in most cases we find for @xmath10 for the asymmetric squid a reduction of @xmath6 as compared to the symmetric squid , which increases with decreasing @xmath3 and increasing @xmath1 .",
    "however , in the case of geometric asymmetry , we find for intermediate values of @xmath77 an increase in @xmath72 for @xmath1=@xmath78 , which is concomitant with a strong distortion of the @xmath0-characteristics .",
    "if we assume @xmath79 , we find that for geometric asymmetry @xmath7 is always larger than for intrinsic asymmetry ( for given @xmath1 ) .",
    "this implies that the distortion in @xmath0 is dominated by the asymmetry in the junction resistances which becomes important for @xmath80 . at @xmath81",
    "the reduction of @xmath71 and @xmath72 is similar for both types of asymmetry , indicating that for small @xmath3 the asymmetry in the critical currents gives the main contribution to @xmath6 .",
    "results similar to those shown in fig.[f - vphi_beta - sim_gb02 ] have been obtained over a wide range @xmath82 which corresponds to 4ph@xmath83160ph for the squid inductance at @xmath67=77k where @xmath84ph .",
    "we note that for the symmetric dc squid it was shown in @xcite that the normalized transfer function @xmath85 factorizes in @xmath86 where @xmath87 is given as @xmath88 . as a main result of our simulations for the asymmetric dc squid we find a similar factorization , with @xmath89 being now also dependent on @xmath1 , while @xmath90 shows no dependence on @xmath1 . for @xmath71",
    "this is shown in fig.[f - vphi - norm](a ) for geometric and in fig.[f - vphi - norm](b ) for intrinsic asymmetry .",
    "the simulation data shown in fig.[f - vphi - norm ] can be approximated as    @xmath91^{-1 } \\nonumber\\\\[2 mm ] f^+_{geo}(\\alpha_i,\\beta_l ) & = & \\!\\!\\!\\frac{(7.18\\cdot 0.31^{\\alpha_i^{8.42}}\\cdot 0.45^{\\alpha_i^{1.22}})\\beta_l^{0.18 + 0.49\\alpha_i^{2.68}}}{(1 + \\beta_l ) } \\nonumber\\\\[2 mm ] g^+_{intr}(\\gamma\\beta_l ) & = & [ ( 80 \\gamma\\beta_l)^{0.4 } + 0.91(4\\gamma\\beta_l)^{1.83}]^{-1 } \\nonumber\\\\[2 mm ] f^+_{intr}(\\alpha_i,\\beta_l ) & = & \\!\\!\\!\\frac{(7.18\\cdot 0.23^{\\alpha_i^{11.53}}\\cdot 0.41^{\\alpha_i^{1.7}})\\beta_l^{0.18 + 0.46\\alpha_i^{2.55}}}{(1 + \\beta_l ) } \\nonumber , \\\\[2 mm ] \\label{eq - gf - plus}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    which is plotted in fig.[f - vphi - norm ] as dotted lines .",
    "these equations enable one to calculate @xmath71 immediately for any value of @xmath3 , @xmath92 and @xmath1 , however _ only _ within the range of parameters displayed in fig.[f - vphi - norm ] .",
    "similar behavior was found for @xmath72 , again with the factorization @xmath93 with @xmath94 .",
    "for @xmath95 we did not derive expressions as for @xmath96 given in eqs([eq - gf - plus ] ) .",
    "as discussed above for @xmath95 the resistance asymmetry plays an important role .",
    "its impact on @xmath6 needs to be studied in more detail .",
    "to test the numerical simulation results we determined @xmath6 for various ybco dc squids ( # 2 - 6 from table i ) with @xmath97 and @xmath98 at @xmath67=77k .",
    "figure [ f - vphi_alpha ] shows that the simulation ( open symbols ) predicts a reduction of both , @xmath99 and @xmath100 as compared to the symmetric case .",
    "for @xmath99 the experimental data ( solid symbols ) lie between the values predicted for the symmetric and asymmetric case . for @xmath101 the measured and calculated values for @xmath99 are identical and lie almost a factor of two below the value predicted for the symmetric squid .",
    "this supports the idea that at least part of the discrepancy in @xmath6 between calculated and measured values can be attributed to asymmetry",
    ". however , most measured values for @xmath100 are clearly larger than predicted for either the symmetric or the asymmetric squid .",
    "the reason for this deviation is most likely due to the large uncertainty in the value for @xmath7 , which induces an increasing distortion with increasing @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "we finally note that a clear - cut comparison between simulation and experimental data for @xmath6 requires the experimental determination of at least @xmath1 , and preferably also of @xmath7 for a wide variety of hts dc squids .",
    "unfortunately , an extensive collection of such data does not exist yet . in order to obtain at least some information on the importance of asymmetry as a possible source for the discrepancy in @xmath6 between theory und experiment we show in fig.[f - vphi_beta - comp ] the prediction for symmetric dc squids ( dotted line ) compared with experimental data taken from the literature @xcite .",
    "in addition , the large open symbols show our simulation results obtained for various values of @xmath1 , assuming intrinsic asymmetry with @xmath102 .",
    "obviously , the observed deviations between experiment and simulation for symmetric squids can not be explained by asymmetry for large values of @xmath103 . for smaller values of @xmath3 , however , most of the experimental data lie within the range of values covered by simulations which take into account asymmetry in the squid , although a large reduction of @xmath6 due to asymmetry , say by a factor of five requires a very large @xmath104 .",
    "we have analyzed the performance of asymmetric hts dc squids both experimentally and by numerical simulation , with focus on transfer function .",
    "our simulations show that strong critical current asymmetry which may arise from a large spread in critical currents in hts josephson junctions can significantly reduce @xmath6 for small @xmath105 .",
    "this observation is important , since optimum performance requires the realization of small @xmath106 .",
    "we wish to stress that the asymmetry , which is most likely present in almost all hts dc squids , may be one source for the previously found discrepancy in @xmath6 between experiments and simulations , however it is not likely that this asymmetry is the major source of this discrepancy .",
