    "although neutrinos are famous for having extremely weak couplings to stable matter , this is not so for all the virtual particles that may appear in loops .",

    ", one has to run @xmath6 from @xmath4 down to @xmath55 with the appropriate rge to obtain the radiatively corrected neutrino mass matrix .",
    "these corrections have interesting implications for the neutrino masses , the mixing angles and the cp - violating phases .    as we will see , and has been discussed extensively in the literature , even if one starts with degenerate neutrino masses at the scale @xmath4 , the relevant radiative corrections ( with a typical size controlled by the tau yukawa coupling squared and a loop suppression factor ) tend to induce mass splittings that can be too large for some of the proposed solutions to the observed neutrino problems .",
    "they are particularly dangerous for the vo solution to the solar neutrino problem , and just about right for the samsw solution , which is certainly suggestive .",
    "they tend to be too small to explain the atmospheric mass splitting , which presumably requires to be generated by effects of the physics beyond @xmath4",
    ". one interesting possibility that , beginning with degenerate neutrinos , can produce radiatively a mass pattern in agreement with experiment is a see - saw scenario , for which the rg analysis was performed in @xcite .    degenerate ( or nearly degenerate ) neutrino mass eigenvalues , besides being a very symmetrical initial condition ( as befits the physics at a more fundamental scale ) offer two important bonuses : the mass splittings at low - energy would be entirely due to radiative corrections and the mixing angles can evolve quickly to some particular values .",
    "the reason for the latter is the following .",
    "in the presence of degenerate mass eigenvalues there is an ambiguity in the choice of the eigenvectors which translates to the definition of the mixing angles .",
    "when a perturbation is added that removes that degeneracy , the ambiguity is resolved in a well defined way ( which depends on the perturbation ) and a particular configuration of mixing angles is chosen . this is exactly what happens when a ( sufficiently precise ) initial mass degeneracy of two neutrino masses is lifted by radiative corrections . in rg language ,",
    "the mixing angles can be driven quickly to infrared quasi - fixed points .",
    "thus , rg effects could in principle be capable of explaining some of the measured values of the mixing angles .    in this paper",
    "we extend previous work of us @xcite and others @xcite along these lines . assuming three flavours of light majorana neutrinos",
    ", we derive the general renormalization group equations ( rges ) for their three masses , three mixing angles and three cp - violating phases ( information alternatively encoded in the rge for the mass eigenvalues and the complex mixing matrix @xmath8 ) .",
    "this form of writing the rges represents an advantageous alternative to using the rge for @xmath6 and , after obtaining the radiatively corrected mass matrix , extracting from it the physical parameters in whatever parametrization it is chosen .",
    "these two alternative methods can be described in short as diagonalize and run versus run and diagonalize. one advantage of the method presented here is that it avoids the proliferation of unphysical parameters ( notice that @xmath6 has 12 degrees of freedom , but only 9 are physical ) , which allows to keep track of the physics in a more efficient way .",
    "another one is that it permits to write the rges in a quite general form , without any reference to a particular scenario , such as the sm , the mssm , see - saw , etc .",
    "this allows to appreciate interesting features ,  the mentioned presence of stable ( pseudo infrared fixed - point ) directions for mixing angles and cp phases , which are not consequence of a particular scenario .",

    "these general rg formulas are extracted from the most general form of the rge for the neutrino mass matrix @xmath6 .",
    "these can be particularized to any model of interest .",
    "we give as particular examples the sm , the mssm and a see - saw scenario .",
    "some conclusions that hold in general are also discussed . in section",
    "3 , using the equations derived in the previous section , we study the implications of radiative corrections for neutrino physics in the sm case ( or the mssm ) neglecting the effect of cp violating phases , so that the mixing matrix @xmath8 is real .",
    "section 4 extends this analysis to the more general case of non - zero cp - violating phases .",
    "section 5 is devoted to the conclusions and the appendix contains some technical details regarding the stability conditions for the mixing matrix @xmath8 in the general case , and how they are reached .",
    "the energy - scale evolution of the @xmath5 neutrino mass matrix @xmath6 is generically described by a rge of the form ( @xmath56 ) : = -(_u m_+ m_p + p^t m _ ) , [ rgm ] ( in particular @xmath57 is preserved ) . for interesting frameworks , such as the sm , the mssm or the see - saw mechanism ( supersymmetric or not ) , @xmath58 and @xmath59 are known explicitly @xcite . in ( [ rgm ] ) ,",

    "the goal of this section is to extract the rges for the physical neutrino parameters : the mass eigenvalues , the mixing angles and the cp phases .",
    "we find convenient to work out the rges for the completely general case first (  without specifying the form of @xmath58 and @xmath59 ) , and later specialize them for particular cases of interest .",
    "this allows to appreciate interesting features ,  the presence of stable ( pseudo infrared fixed - point ) directions for angles and phases , which are not a consequence of the particular framework chosen .    using the parametrization and conventions of sect .  1",

    "( [ alfae][alfatau ] ) ] .",
    "however , the explicit rges for the physical parameters @xmath64 and @xmath67 do not depend on @xmath19 as it should be the case ; 2 ) from ( [ rgcp1][rgcp3 ] ) we also see that , if no phases are present in @xmath8 originally , they are not generated by radiative corrections ( unless @xmath59 contains phases .",
    "if it does , one could generate radiatively small non - zero phases in @xmath8 ) ; 3 ) from the structure of @xmath68 ( or @xmath69 ) we see that large renormalization effects can be expected in two cases : a ) if some couplings in @xmath59 are large ( not the case of the sm ) or b ) if there are ( quasi)-degenerate mass eigenstates at tree level ( causing @xmath70 ) .",
    "an aspect of central importance in the discussion of the rg effects is that when the neutrino spectrum has ( quasi)-degenerate eigenvalues , one expects large ( even infinite for exact degeneracy ) contributions to @xmath71 .",
    "the reason is the following .",
    "when two mass eigenvalues , say @xmath12 and @xmath13 , are equal , there is an ambiguity in the choice of the associated eigenvectors , and thus in the definition of @xmath8 .",
    "in particular , the columns @xmath72 could be rotated at will ,  the matrix @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is an arbitrary rotation in the @xmath12-@xmath13 plane , will also diagonalize the initial @xmath6 matrix . when the perturbation due to rg running is added , the degeneracy @xmath75 will be normally lifted and a particular rotation of the columns @xmath72 will be singled out : @xmath76 , giving @xmath77 and removing the singularity in eq .",
    "( [ rgu ] ) .",
    "the form of @xmath74 is thus determined by the matrix @xmath59 . in the appendix we give the derivation of @xmath74 for a general @xmath59 .",
    "the matrix @xmath78 may be very different from the form of @xmath8 originally chosen , thus the initial big jump in the evolution of @xmath8 .",
    "it is easy to see , however , that the subsequent evolution of the matrix @xmath8 will be smooth , even in the presence of a large @xmath79 .",
    "if the initial degeneracy is not exact , but nearly so , then @xmath70 and the initial @xmath8 , whatever it is , will be rapidly driven by the rg - running close to the stable @xmath78 form .",
    "thus , @xmath78 plays the role of an infrared pseudo - fixed point .",
    "therefore , if some initial neutrino masses are ( exactly or approximately ) degenerate , we have the interesting possibility of predicting some low - energy mixing angles or cp phases just from radiative corrections .",
    "this possibility will be exploited in the next sections .",
    "it is also useful to indicate that , in cases for which one particular @xmath65 gives the dominant contribution to the rges , the following quantities are approximately conserved ( here @xmath80 can take any value ) : [ cons ] & |u_ki|^2+|u_kj|^2 & , + & im(u_ki^*u_kj)&,[cons2 ] + & [ _ ij]^-1re(_ij ) & , [ cons3 ] as can re readily proved by using ( [ rgu ] ) and keeping only terms @xmath81 ( for the last conserved quantity we assume that @xmath82 is never of the order of @xmath68 , which is quite reasonable to expect ) .",

    "the radiative corrections to the mass splittings are potentially dangerous for the vo scenario , which becomes unviable if @xmath286 , unless @xmath418 , the `` solar '' @xmath158 angle is close to maximal and the common mass is below the range of cosmological relevance .",
    "we have also shown that previous claims ( realized in the two - flavour approximation ) in the sense that the rg running could provide a substantial enhancement of the atmospheric mixing , @xmath242 can not work in practice , since the mechanism leads to an unacceptably large `` solar '' splitting , @xmath208 .",
