    "with the deeply going of the study of the nucleon structure , three dimensional imaging has become the very frontier and a hot topic in recent years .",
    "it is commonly recognized that the three dimensional imaging contains much more abundant physics on the nucleon structure and the properties of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "the study was initially triggered by the experimental finding of striking single - spin asymmetries ( ssa ) in inclusive hadron production in hadron - hadron collisions with transversely polarized hadron  @xcite .",
    "gradually it grows into a field aiming at a comprehensive three dimensional description of the nucleon structure including spin and transverse momentum dependences .    the one dimensional imaging of the nucleon is provided by the parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) such as the number densities , @xmath0 , the helicity distributions , @xmath1 , and the transversities , @xmath2 , for quarks of different flavors in the nucleon .",
    "these one dimensional pdfs can be studied in inclusive high energy reactions and are necessary for the description of such inclusive processes . in the three dimensional case , i.e. where the parton transverse momentum is also considered ,",
    "not only the direct extensions of these distribution functions to include transverse momentum dependences are involved , but also many other correlation functions that describe in particular the correlations between the transverse momenta and spins such as the sivers function , the boer - mulders function , the pretzelocity etc .",
    "they are generally called transverse momentum dependent ( tmd ) pdfs . moreover , higher twist effects become also important and need to be considered consistently .",
    "the content of the studies is therefore much more abundant and more interesting .",
    "these tmd pdfs can be studied in semi - inclusive reactions and are necessary for the description of such processes .",
    "the study on the three dimensional imaging of the nucleon is in a rapid developing phase and it is not so easy to make a comprehensive overview of all different aspects of the studies . here",
    ", we choose to arrange the review in the following way : first we will make a brief review of what we did in one dimensional case with inclusive deep inelastic lepton - nucleon scattering ( dis ) . in this way",
    ", we hope that we can find out the main line of what we need to do in three dimensional case .",
    "after that we will try to summarize the progresses already achieved along this line and what we need to do next .",
    "such a brief review of the one dimensional case will be presented in sec .",
    "2 . in sec . 3",
    ", we will make a short summary of tmds defined via quark - quark correlator . in sec .",
    "4 , we will present a brief overview of what we have for constructing the theoretical framework of semi - inclusive processes . in sec .",
    "5 , we will make a short summary of the available experimental results and tmd parameterizations extracted from them .",
    "finally we will make a short summary of this review in sec",
    "this overview article is an extended version of a plenary talk at the 21st international symposium on spin physics ( spin2014 )  @xcite . as can be imagined that the simplest and basic picture is what we have at the leading order in perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) and at the leading twist .",
    "hence , there are also two major directions in theoretical developments towards a comprehensive description of the semi - inclusive processes .",
    "one is to take higher order pqcd into account , and the second is to consider higher twist contributions .",
    "these contributions are important not only for higher accuracy but also for consistency .",
    "the major progresses that have been made in recent years are also in these two directions separately , i.e. either at the leading twist but leading and higher order in pqcd or leading order in pqcd but leading and higher twists .",
    "the talk  @xcite was mainly concentrated on the second direction . for higher order pqcd contributions where evolutions of pdfs are involved ,",
    "an overview talk was also presented by daniel boer in the same conference  @xcite .",
    "there are also many other reviews and monographs ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the study for higher order in pqcd and higher twists seems to be rather difficult and even the factorization properties are unclear  @xcite . in this article",
    ", we follow the same line as in the talk  @xcite but briefly summarize the progresses in the studies on qcd evolutions and refer the interested readers to those reviews .",
    "our studies on the structure of a fast moving nucleon started with inclusive dis such as @xmath3 .",
    "we recall that , under one photon exchange approximation , the differential cross section is given by the lorentz contraction of the well - known leptonic tensor @xmath4 and the hadronic tensor @xmath5 , i.e. , @xmath6 the leptonic tensor is calculable and is given by , @xmath7 information on the structure of the nucleon is contained in the hadronic tensor defined as , @xmath8 here , @xmath9 and @xmath10 denote the 4-momenta of the lepton and the nucleon respectively , those with prime are for the final states ; @xmath11 stands for the helicity , and @xmath12 for the polarization vector of the nucleon .",
    "we use the light - cone coordinate and define the light - cone unit vectors as @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , so that a general four - vector can be decomposed as @xmath16 , with @xmath17 , and @xmath18 .",
    "we work in the center of mass frame of the @xmath19 and choose the nucleon s momentum as @xmath20-direction so that @xmath10 and @xmath12 are decomposed as , @xmath21 the bjorken variable is defined as @xmath22 , @xmath23 ; and we also define @xmath24 .    the theoretical framework for inclusive dis has been constructed in the following steps .",
    "first , we studied the kinematics and obtained the general form of the hadronic tensor by applying the basic constraints from the general symmetry requirements such as lorentz covariance , gauge invariance , parity conservation and hermiticity , e.g. , @xmath25 where @xmath26 denotes the results of @xmath27 after space reflection , i.e. , @xmath28 .",
    "the general form of the hadronic tensor is given by the sum of a symmetric part and an antisymmetric part , @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are given by , @xmath32 respectively .",
    "we found out that the hadronic tensor is determined by four independent structure functions @xmath33 ,",
    "@xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 , where the first two describe the unpolarized case and the latter two are needed for polarized cases .",
    "our knowledge of one dimensional imaging of the nucleon starts with the  intuitive parton model \" that is very nicely formulated e.g. in @xcite . here",
    ", it was argued that , in a fast moving frame , because of time dilation , quantum fluctuations such as vacuum polarizations can exist quite long . in the infinite momentum frame ,",
    "such fluctuations exist forever . in this case",
    ", a fast moving nucleon can be viewed as a beam of free  partons \" .",
    "the probability of the scattering of an electron with a nucleon is taken as the incoherent sum of that of the scattering with each individual parton , more precisely , a convolution of the number density of the parton in the nucleon with the probability of the scattering with the parton , i.e. , @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the number density of parton of flavor @xmath39 in the nucleon . in this way",
    ", we obtained the famous results  @xcite , @xmath40 here , we would like to point out that , with this intuitive parton model , we are doing nothing else but the impulse approximation that we often use in describing a collision process where we do the following approximations ,    * during the interaction of the electron with the parton , interactions between the partons are neglected ; * the electron interacts only with one single parton each time ; * the scatterings of the electron with different partons are added incoherently .",
    "although the physical picture of the intuitive model is very clear and the model is elegant and practical , we are not satisfied with the formulation because it is partly qualitative or semi - classical hence it is not easy to control the accuracy .",
    "a proper formulation should be based on quantum filed theory ( qft ) and is obtained by starting with the feynman diagram fig .",
    "1(a ) . here ,",
    "from this diagram , we obtain immediately that , @xmath41,\\label{eq : wincl0}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 is the 4-momentum of the parton .",
    "@xmath43 is a calculable hard part .",
    "the matrix element @xmath44 is known as the quark - quark correlator describing the structure of the nucleon . by taking the collinear approximation , i.e. taking @xmath45 , and neglecting the power suppressed contributions i.e. the @xmath46 terms",
    ", we obtain @xmath47 f_q(x).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this is exactly the same result as that obtained from eq .",
    "( [ eq : intuitive ] ) based on the intuitive parton model . at the same time , we obtain the qft operator expression of @xmath38 defined via the quark - quark correlator given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : phi0 ] ) as , @xmath48 by inserting the expanded expression of the field operator @xmath49 in terms of the plan wave and the creation and/or annihilation operators , we see clearly that @xmath38 is indeed the number density of parton in the nucleon . however , from this expression , we see also immediately a severe problem , i.e. this expression is _ not _ ( local ) gauge invariant !",
    "we understand that the physical quantity has to be gauge invariant and therefore have to find a solution for this .     with ( a ) @xmath50 , ( b ) @xmath51 and ( c ) @xmath52 gluons exchanged.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]",
    "the gauge invariant formulation is obtained by taking into account the multiple gluon scattering shown by the diagram series in fig.1(a - c ) .",
    "this is clear since ( local ) gauge invariance implies the existence of the gauge interaction that needs to be taken into account . in this way , we obtain , @xmath53 where @xmath54 represents the contribution from the diagram with exchange of @xmath55-gluon(s ) . they are all expressed as a trace of a calculable hard part and a matrix element depending on the structure of the nucleon .",
    "e.g. , corresponding to fig .",

    "as did in @xcite , we will mainly focus on the theoretical framework at lo pqcd but taking leading and higher twist contributions into account consistently . before that",
    ", we would like to emphasize the following two of the historical developments that may be helpful to us in constructing the theoretical framework for the tmd case .",
    "first , as mentioned , the study of three dimensional imaging of the nucleon was triggered by the experimental observation of the single - spin left - right asymmetries ( ssa ) in the inclusive hadron - hadron collision with transversely polarized projectile or target .",
    "it was known that pqcd leads to negligibly small asymmetry for the hard part  @xcite but the observed asymmetry can be as large as 40%  @xcite .",
    "the hunting for such large asymmetries lasts for decades with the following milestones :    * in 1991 , sivers introduced  @xcite the asymmetric quark distribution in a transversely polarized nucleon that is now known as the sivers function . * in 1993 , boros , liang and meng proposed  @xcite a phenomenological model that provides an intuitive physical picture showing that the asymmetry arises from the orbital angular momenta of quarks and what they called `` surface effect '' caused by the initial or final state interactions . * in 1993 , collins published  @xcite his proof that sivers function has to vanish due to parity and time reversal invariance . * in 2002 , brodsky , hwang and schmidt calculated  @xcite ssa for sidis using an explicit example where they took the orbital angular momentum of quark and the multiple gluon scattering into account . * in 2002 , immediately after @xcite , collins pointed out  @xcite that the multiple gluon scattering is contained in the gauge link and that the conclusion of his proof in 1993 was incorrect because he forgot the gauge link .",
    "he further showed that by taking the gauge link into account the same proof leads to the conclusion that sivers function for dis and that for drell - yan have opposite sign .",
    "belitsky , ji and yuan resolved  @xcite the problem of defining the gauge link for a tmd parton density in light - cone gauge where the gauge potential does not vanish asymptotically .",
    "the second historical development that we would like to mention concerns the azimuthal asymmetry study in sidis .",
    "it was shown by georgi and politzer in 1977  @xcite that final state gluon radiations lead to azimuthal asymmetries and could be used as a ",
    "clean test to pqcd \" .",
    "however , soon after , in 1978 , it was shown by cahn  @xcite that similar asymmetries can also be obtained if one includes intrinsic transverse momenta of partons .",
    "the latter , now named as cahn effect , though power suppressed i.e. at higher twist , can be quite significant and can not be neglected since the values of the asymmetries themselves are usually not very large .",
    "the lessons that we learned from these historical developments are in particular the following two points , i.e. , when studying tmds ,    * it is important to take the gauge link into account ; * higher twist effects can be important .",
    "+    both of them demand that , to describe sidis in terms of tmds , we need the proper qft formulation rather than the intuitive parton model . +",

    "<S> we present a short overview on the studies of transverse momentum dependent parton distribution functions of the nucleon . </S>",
    "<S> the aim of such studies is to provide a three dimensional imagining of the nucleon and a comprehensive description of semi - inclusive high energy reactions . by comparing with the theoretical framework that we have for the inclusive deep inelastic lepton - nucleon scattering and the one - dimensional imaging of the nucleon , we summarize what we need to do in order to construct such a comprehensive theoretical framework for semi - inclusive processes in terms of three dimensional gauge invariant parton distributions . after that , we present an overview of what we have already achieved with emphasize on the theoretical framework for semi - inclusive reactions in leading order perturbative qcd but with leading and higher twist contributions . </S>",
    "<S> we summarize in particular the results for the differential cross section and the azimuthal spin asymmetries in terms of the gauge invariant transverse momentum dependent parton distribution functions . </S>",
    "<S> we also briefly summarize the available experimental results on semi - inclusive reactions and parameterizations of transverse momentum dependent parton distributions extracted from them and make an outlook for the future studies . </S>"
