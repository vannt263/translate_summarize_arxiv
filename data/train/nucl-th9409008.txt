    "this representation of the deviations from chemical equilibrium is valid whenever the quarks and antiquarks are non - degenerate , so that maxwell - boltzmann statistics can be used in place of fermi statistics , and when the production from quark - antiquark annihilation ( which is proportional to @xmath69 ) is small .",

    "@xmath66 is a monotonically increasing function of @xmath40 , so one can infer @xmath40 given @xmath66 from the measured photon spectrum.@xcite this can be seen in the lowest curve , where we have run our simulation without transverse expansion .    including transverse expansion",
    ", we find that we can no longer infer @xmath40 from @xmath66 , due to the non - monotonicity of the relation ( except for long thermalization times ; see the curve with @xmath70=1.0 fm/@xmath10 , corresponding to @xmath73 mev ) .",
    "this demonstrates the large effect of the transverse motion of the fluid on the photon spectrum : lowering @xmath40 decreases the bag constant , which increases the ratio @xmath74 in the qgp , producing more transverse motion .",
    "the increase in @xmath49 caused by the fluid motion is enough to overcome the decrease of @xmath66 with decreasing @xmath40 found without transverse expansion .",
    "this non - monotonicity occurred for all parameter sets we tried , although for some ( e.g. , @xmath75 fm/@xmath10 ) the minimum appears outside the range of @xmath40 investigated here .",
    "as the initial temperature is lowered , the value of @xmath40 below which the effects of flow dominate also decreases . this may be attributed to the fact that , as @xmath32 approaches @xmath40 , less flow develops before the mixed phase is reached .",
    "contrary to experience without transverse expansion,@xcite increasing @xmath76 to 150 mev decreases @xmath66 , another indication that the transverse motion has a large effect on the spectrum .",
    "apparently the lower - temperature hadronic matter expands outward at a velocity high enough that the contribution to @xmath49 from this motion more than makes up for the low temperature .",
    "thus , removing the contribution from the late stages ( by raising @xmath76 ) decreases @xmath66 .    for @xmath77 , the quantity we call @xmath40 on the figure is the chemical equilibrium ( @xmath78 ) transition temperature , @xmath79 rather than the larger non - equilibrium transition temperature used in the simulation , which is given by eq .",
    "( [ tcb ] ) .",
    "we do this because the equilibrium transition temperature is more useful for comparisons with theoretical calculations .",
    "the curve for @xmath80 shows that @xmath66 is about 3 mev higher than for @xmath78 .",
    "the increase occurs because the temperature of the mixed phase , which makes a large contribution to the photon spectrum , is raised when @xmath42 is lowered .",
    "we do not show results for other values of @xmath42 ; the change in @xmath66 is approximately linear in @xmath42 .",
    "the effect of increasing @xmath70 to 1 fm/@xmath10 is dramatic : @xmath66 becomes monotonic within the range of interest , and is lower than for the other parameter sets considered . as mentioned above , this is due to the decrease in the role of the transverse expansion , which is assumed to start at @xmath70 .",
    "figure 2 displays the effect of varying the parameters on the spectra , keeping the value of the critical temperature fixed ( @xmath81 mev ) .",
    "we plot @xmath82 vs.  @xmath49 for different scenarios .",
    "the spectra are nearly exponential .",
    "it is seen that increasing the equilibration time ( i.e.  decreasing the initial temperature ) decreases the high @xmath49 contribution to the photon spectrum and thus decreases the fit temperature . increasing the freezeout temperature",
    "removes a fraction of the radiated photons and decreases the yield , also as expected . excluding the @xmath2 resonance decreases the yield by about one - third in the transverse - momentum range investigated",
    "this is roughly consistent with several other calculations.@xcite    figure 3 shows @xmath82 vs.  @xmath49 ( per central collision ) for the preliminary wa80 data ( assuming a minimum bias cross - section of 3600 mb ) , along with calculated spectra using selected parameter sets .",
    "the data between 1 and 2 gev are best fitted with @xmath83 mev , using eq .",
    "( [ tfit ] ) .",
    "we use this value of @xmath66 and figure 1 to extract the value of @xmath40 ( between 150 and 200 mev ) for each parameter set . the experimentally determined fit temperature",
    ", @xmath83 mev is below the values predicted by the model for some parameter choices . in these cases @xmath40 was estimated by minimizing @xmath66 .    for the standard parameter set and for @xmath80",
    "we used @xmath40=170 mev .",
    "note , however , that for @xmath77 , the non - equilibrium transition temperature is larger than this , as explained earlier .",
    "the difference is sufficient to counteract the decrease in the number of degrees of freedom in the plasma , leading to a somewhat higher yield than with the standard parameters . due to the large error bars of the preliminary wa80 data , the calculated spectra are consistent with the data points , although generally below them for these parameters . in the absence of transverse expansion",
    ", photon production is increased by approximately a factor of two by including pion masses,@xcite so agreement with the preliminary wa80 data will probably be further improved with a more realistic equation of state .",
    "increasing the equilibration time to @xmath70=1 fm/@xmath10 ( and accordingly decreasing the initial temperature ) leads to @xmath40=190 mev .",
    "the increase in @xmath40 increases the photon yield .",
    "in addition , the lower initial temperature and the higher critical temperature results in less flow being built up by the time the system reaches the mixed phase than with the standard parameter set .",
    "therefore , the system spends a longer time in the mixed phase for this set of parameters .",
    "this also increases the yield , as pointed out by shuryak and xiong.@xcite to quantify the difference between these scenarios , we `` measured '' ( in the code ) the total four - volume associated with the mixed phase and found it to be about 25% larger for @xmath70=1 fm/@xmath10 than for @xmath70=0.2",
    "our results with the long equilibration time ( @xmath70=1 fm/@xmath10 ) tend to overestimate the data .",
    "excess photons come from both the qgp and the hadronic phases in our calculation relative to ref .",
    "@xcite .    increasing the freezeout temperature to @xmath76=150 mev decreases the photon yield partly because a contribution is removed , and partly because we use @xmath84 mev ( rather than 170 mev ) in this case .",
    "note that 160 mev@xmath85 mev all give approximately the same @xmath66 for @xmath76=150 mev , though the photon spectrum has a larger magnitude when @xmath40 is increased due to the large contribution from the mixed phase .",
    "thus , even if @xmath40 can not be determined by @xmath66 alone , it may be possible to ascertain @xmath40 by comparing to the total production rate as well .",
    "figure 4 displays predicted spectra for a central pb+pb collision at sps energy , using the parameter sets from fig .",
    "the initial temperatures corresponding to @xmath70= 0.2 fm/@xmath10 and @xmath70= 1 fm/@xmath10 are @xmath86 mev and @xmath87258 mev , respectively .",
    "the shapes of the spectra and the relative production rates are similar to those for the s+au collisions . for comparison",
    ", we also show the spectrum obtained in the absence of transverse expansion , taking @xmath88 mev .",
    "we find that transverse expansion has a large effect on the production rate , in apparent disagreement with ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "our conclusion is that transverse expansion destroys the correlation suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite , so that @xmath40 can not be determined just from measurements of the shape of the single photon spectrum , as parametrized by @xmath66 .",
    "the monotonic dependence of @xmath66 on @xmath40 is destroyed because the transverse flow increases as @xmath40 decreases . however , the total production rate is also sensitive to @xmath40 , so it is possible that comparison to the production rate instead of just the shape of the transverse momentum spectrum may be sufficient to determine @xmath40 from data . in the transverse - momentum range",
    "studied , the inclusion of the @xmath2 resonance increases the photon yields by about 50% .",
    "preliminary wa80 data appear to rule out large values for the equilibration time .",
