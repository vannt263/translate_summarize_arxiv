    "entanglement @xcite as a measure of quantum correlations existing between subsystems of a composite quantum system has been shown to be indispensable in performing several quantum information tasks @xcite . to deal with challenges such as decoherence due to system - environment interaction , entanglement distillation protocols @xcite to purify highly entangled states from a collection of states with relatively low entanglement",
    "have also been invented .",
    "parallely , various counter - intuitive findings such as substantial non - classical efficiency of quantum states with vanishingly small entanglement , and locally indistinguishable orthogonal product states @xcite have motivated the search for quantum correlations not belonging to the entanglement - separability paradigm . this has led to the possibility of introducing more fine - grained quantum correlation measures than entanglement , such as quantum discord ( qd ) @xcite , quantum work deficit ( qwd ) @xcite , and various discord - like measures @xcite , opening up a new direction of research in quantum information theory .",
    "although establishing a link between the measures of quantum correlations belonging to the two different genres has also been tried @xcite , a decisive result is yet to be found in the case of mixed bipartite quantum states .",
    "note , however , that all these measures reduce to von neumann entropy of local density matrix for pure states . in recent years",
    ", the interplay between entanglement distillation and quantum correlations such as qd and qwd has been under focus @xcite .",
    "however , proper understanding of the relation between such measures and distillable as well as bound entanglement @xcite is yet to be achieved .",
    "there has been a substantial amount of work in determining qd for various classes of bipartite as well as multipartite mixed quantum states @xcite . a common observation that stands out from these works",
    "is the computational complexity of the task , due to the optimization over a complete set of local measurements involved in its definition @xcite . for general quantum states ,",
    "the optimization is often achieved via numerical techniques .",
    "it has recently been shown that the problem of computing quantum discord is np - complete , thereby making the quantity computationally intractable @xcite .",
    "the lack of a well - established analytic treatment to determine qd has also restricted the number of experiments in this topic @xcite . despite considerable efforts to analytically determine qd for general two - qubit states @xcite , a closed form expression exists only for the bell diagonal ( bd ) states @xcite .",
    "a number of recent numerical studies have shown that for a large fraction of a very special class of two - qubit states , qd can always be calculated by performing the optimization over only a small subset of the complete set of local projection measurements @xcite , thereby reducing the computational difficulty to a great extent .",
    "these states are constructed of the three diagonal correlators of the correlation matrix , and any one of the three magnetizations , which is similar for both the qubits .",
    "the subset , in the present case , consists of the projection measurements corresponding to the three pauli matrices , @xmath0 , and @xmath1 .",
    "curiously , the assumption that qd can be optimized over this subset for the entire class of such states results only in a small absolute error in the case of those states where the assumption is not valid @xcite .",
    "this property also allows one to determine closed form for qd for the entire class of such two - qubit states within the margin of small absolute error in calculation @xcite .",
    "optimization over such a small subset of the complete set of local projection measurements is logical in the situations where a constraint over the allowed local measurements is at work .",
    "the knowledge of such a subset may be important in quantum estimation theory @xcite , in relation to quantities that are non - linear functions of the quantum states , such as the qd , where estimation of the parameter values to determine the optimal projection measurement depends on the the number of measurements required to obtain the desired quantity within a manageable range of error . also , the existence of such subsets has the potential to be operationally as well as energetically advantageous in experimental determination of the qd and similar measures for a given quantum state .",
    "however , the investigation of the existence of such _ special _ subsets of allowed local projectors in the computation of quantum correlations like qd and qwd , as of now , are confined only to special classes of quantum states in @xmath2 systems @xcite .",
    "a natural question that arises is whether such subsets of local projectors can exist for general bipartite quantum states .",
    "the possible scaling of the absolute error resulting from the limitation on the number of allowed local projectors in the subset is also an interesting issue .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the issue of simplifying the optimization of quantum correlation measures like qd and qwd in the case of general two - qubit mixed states of different ranks with positive as well as non - positive partial transpose ( nppt ) @xcite by using a restricted set of local projection measurements .",
    "we provide a mathematical description of the optimization of quantum correlation measures over a restricted set of allowed local projection measurements , and discuss the related statistics of computational error . using a set of plausible definitions of the restricted set , we show that the absolute error , resulting due to the constraint over the set of projectors , dies out considerably fast . using the scaling of the error with the size of the restricted subset , we demonstrate that even a small number of properly chosen projectors can form a restricted set leading to a very small absolute error , thereby making the computation of quantum correlation measures considerably easier .",
    "our method also helps us to find expressions with negligible error for qd and qwd of several important classes of quantum states .",
    "we demonstrate this in the case of two - qubit `` @xmath3 '' states @xcite , which occur , in general , in ground or thermal states of several quantum spin models .",
    "hence , our approach provides a way to study cooperative phenomena present in such systems with less numerical difficulty , as demonstrated here for anisotropic @xmath4 model in the presence of external transverse field @xcite .",
    "we extend the study to the paradigmatic classes of bound entangled ( be ) states , where the computation of qd and qwd using a special restricted subset is discussed , and their analytic forms with small error are determined .",
    "the results indicate that the error resulting from the restricted measurement in the case of states with positive partial transpose ( ppt ) is less compared to the states with non - positive partial transpose ( nppt ) .",
    "such constrained optimizations can be a powerful tool to study physical quantities in higher dimensions , and to obtain closed forms of qd and qwd .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "[ twoqubit ] , we discuss a set of constructions of the subset in relation to the statistics of the error for general two - qubit mixed states in the state space .",
    "we also consider a general two - qubit state in the parameter space , and show how symmetry of the state helps in defining the restricted subset .",
    "we demonstrate how our method can be used to determine closed form expressions of quantum correlation measures , and comment on the applicability of the method in real physical systems like quantum spin models .",

    "we now introduce the physical quantity , which will help us to reduce the computational complexity involved in evaluation of qd and qwd .",
    "in particular , we consider the bipartite quantum correlations in the scenario where there are restrictions on the complete set of projectors defining the local measurement on one of the subsystems .",
    "let us assume that constraints on the local measurement restrict the class of projection measurements to a subset @xmath35 @xmath36 , where there are @xmath37 sets of projection measurements in @xmath38 . performing the optimization only over the set @xmath35 , a constrained quantum correlation ( cqc ) , @xmath39 , can be defined .",

    "when @xmath57 , we may ( but not necessarily ) have @xmath58 , resulting in @xmath59 , whence ve vanishes .",

    "if @xmath62 for a quantum state even when the optimization is performed over the set @xmath35 , we call the quantum state an `` exceptional '' state .",
    "apart from the quantum information - theoretic measures having entropic definitions , such as qd and qwd , there exists a variety of geometric measures of `` discord - like '' quantum correlations .",
    "these measures are based on different metrics quantifying the minimum distance of the quantum state from the set of all possible classical - quantum states @xcite .",
    "although a collection of distance metrics have been used to characterize geometric measures of quantum correlations , it has been shown that out of all the schatten @xmath63-norm distances , only the one - norm distance has properties that are rather similar to the qd as well as qwd @xcite .",
    "but due to the difficulty in optimizing the measure , analytically closed forms of one - norm geometric discord has been obtained only for some special types of states , e.g. , bell diagonal states , and the x states @xcite .",
    "our methodology , along with the traditional qd and qwd , is applicable also to the geometric measures that require an optimization .",
    "motivated by the usefulness of qd and qwd in certain quantum protocols @xcite , we choose these measures for the purpose of demonstration .",
    "in the case of a @xmath64 system where each of the subsystems consists of a single qubit only , the rank-@xmath18 projection measurements are of the form @xmath65 , @xmath66 , where @xmath67 , a local unitary operator in @xmath68 , can be parametrized using two real parameters , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 , as @xmath71 here , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 denotes the computational basis in @xmath75 .",

    "define the optimal projection measurement for the computation of the fixed quantum correlation measure , @xmath40 .",

    "a similar definition holds for the probability @xmath91 also .    in the case of two - qubit systems ,",
    "an uniform distribution of the projection measurements in the measurement space corresponds to the uniform distribution of the @xmath92 points on the surface of the bloch sphere .",

    "note that the maximum ve is committed in the separable region ( of the order of @xmath384 ) , whereas it is smaller ( of the order of @xmath143 ) in the be region .",

    "analytic expression for @xmath235 can be obtained using the above analysis , as shown in the previous cases .",
    "we conclude the discussion on the state @xmath385 by pointing out that the qwd of the state coincides with the qd since @xmath385 has maximally mixed marginals , i.e. , the local density operator of each of the parties is proportional to identity in @xmath400 @xcite .",
    "to summarize , we have addressed the question whether the computational complexity of information theoretic measures of quantum correlations such as quantum discord and quantum work deficit can be reduced by performing the optimization involved over a constrained subset of local projectors instead of the complete set .",
    "we have considered four plausible constructions of such a restricted set , and shown that the average absolute error , in the case of two - qubit mixed states with different ranks , dies down fast with the increase in the size of the set .",
    "quantitative investigation of the reduction of error with the increase in the size of the restricted set has been performed with a comparative study between quantum discord and quantum work deficit , and the corresponding scaling exponents have been estimated .",
    "we have also considered a general two - qubit state up to local unitary transformation , and have shown that the computation of measures like quantum discord and quantum work deficit can be made considerably easier by carefully choosing the restricted set of projectors .",
    "we have also pointed out that insight about constructing the constrained set can be gathered from the probability distribution of the optimizing parameters .",
    "if a very special restricted set consisting of the projection measurements corresponding to only the three pauli matrices is considered , we have demonstrated that the state space of a two - qubit system contains a large fraction of states for which exact minimizations of quantum discord and quantum work deficit are obtained only on this set , resulting vanishing error .",
    "we have also pointed out that this feature can be utilized to obtain closed - form expressions of quantum correlation measures up to small error for some special classes of states , which can be used to study physical systems such as quantum spin models .",
    "the usefulness of this methodology has been demonstrated in the finite size scaling analysis of the well - known transverse - field @xmath4 model at zero temperature , and for the thermal state of a two - qubit @xmath4 model in an external inhomogeneous transverse field .",
    "moreover , we have found that the absolute error in the value of quantum correlation calculated using the constrained set in the case of two - qubit ppt as well as ppt be states is low compared to the nppt states .",
    "the investigations show that these measures can be obtained with high accuracy even when restrictions in the optimizations involved in their definitions are employed , thereby reducing the computational difficulties in their evaluation .",
    "although we have investigated only information theoretic measures , this study gives rise to a possibility to overcome challenges in the computation of other quantum correlation measures that involve optimization over some set .",

    "<S> we address the issue of reducing the resource required to compute information - theoretic quantum correlation measures like quantum discord and quantum work deficit in two qubits and higher dimensional systems . </S>",
    "<S> we show that determination of the quantum correlation measure is possible even if we utilize a restricted set of local measurements . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the determination allows us to obtain a closed form of quantum discord and quantum work deficit for several classes of states , with a low error . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the computational error caused by the constraint over the complete set of local measurements reduces fast with an increase in the size of the restricted set , implying usefulness of constrained optimization , especially with the increase of dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> we perform quantitative analysis to investigate how the error scales with the system size , taking into account a set of plausible constructions of the constrained set . </S>",
    "<S> carrying out a comparative study , we show that the resource required to optimize quantum work deficit is usually higher than that required for quantum discord . </S>",
    "<S> we also demonstrate that minimization of quantum discord and quantum work deficit is easier in the case of two - qubit mixed states of fixed ranks and with positive partial transpose in comparison to the corresponding states having non - positive partial transpose . applying the methodology to quantum spin models , </S>",
    "<S> we show that the constrained optimization can be used with advantage in analyzing such systems in quantum information - theoretic language . for bound entangled states , </S>",
    "<S> we show that the error is significantly low when the measurements correspond to the spin observables along the three cartesian coordinates , and thereby we obtain expressions of quantum discord and quantum work deficit for these bound entangled states . </S>"
