    "in the past few years , there has been considerable interest in both genuinely discrete and continuum but periodic systems @xcite .",
    "these arise in diverse physical contexts @xcite , including coupled waveguide arrays and photorefractive crystals in nonlinear optics @xcite , bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) in optical lattices ( ols ) in atomic physics @xcite , and dna double - strand dynamics in biophysics @xcite .",
    "one of the most interesting themes that emerges in this context is the concept of `` effective discreteness '' induced by continuum periodic dynamics .",
    "there have been many efforts both to derive discrete systems that emulate the dynamics of continuum periodic ones @xcite and to obtain continuum systems that mimic properties of discrete ones @xcite .",
    "additionally , the connection between discrete and continuum systems in various settings is one of the main research thrusts that has emerged from studies of the fermi - pasta - ulam problem @xcite .",
    "this paper examines a type of excitation , not previously analyzed ( to the best of our knowledge ) , with the intriguing characteristic that it can be observed in continuum periodic systems but _ can not _ be captured using a genuinely discrete description of the same problem .",
    "the reason for this is that these states bear the unusual feature that their length scale is a fraction of that of the continuum periodic potential .",
    "thus , the `` fractional - period '' states reported in this paper are not stationary states of the latter problem , but rather transient excitations that persist for finite , observable times .    to illustrate these fractional states , we consider the example of a trapped bec in which an ol potential is turned on ( as a non - adiabatic perturbation ) @xcite .",
    "our results can also be applied in the context of optics by considering , for example , the effect of abruptly turning on an ordinary polarization beam in a photorefractive crystal @xcite .",
    "our particular interest in becs is motivated by recent experiments @xcite , where after loading the condensate in an ol , the amplitude of the pertinent standing wave was modulated and the resulting excitations were probed .",
    "these findings were subsequently analyzed in the framework of the gross - pitaevskii equation in @xcite , where it was argued that a parametric resonance occurs due to the ol amplitude modulation .",
    "these results were further enforced by the analysis of @xcite , which included a computation of the relevant stability diagram and growth rates of parametrically unstable modes .",
    "the results of @xcite were also examined in @xcite by treating the bose gas as a tomonaga - luttinger liquid .",
    "a similar experiment , illustrating the controllability of such ols , was recently reported in @xcite , where instead of modulating the amplitude of the lattice , its location was translated ( shaken ) periodically .",
    "this resulted in mixing between vibrational levels and the observation of period - doubled states .",
    "such states were predicted earlier @xcite in both lattice ( discrete nonlinear schrdinger ) and continuum ( gross - pitaevskii ) frameworks in connection to a modulational instability @xcite and were also examined recently in @xcite .",
    "period - multiplied states may exist as stationary ( often unstable ) solutions of such nonlinear problems and can usually be captured in the relevant lattice models . to obtain fractional - period states , which can not be constructed using bloch s theorem @xcite",
    ", we will consider a setting similar to that of @xcite , akin to the experiments of @xcite .",
    "however , contrary to the aforementioned earlier works ( but still within the realm of the experimentally available possibilities of , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , we propose applying a strong non - adiabatic perturbation to the system ( which originally consists of a magnetically confined bec ) by abruptly switching on an ol potential . as a result ,",
    "the bec is far from its desired ground state .",
    "because of these nonequilibrium conditions , the system `` wanders '' in configuration space while trying to achieve its energetically desired state . in this process",
    ", we monitor the fractional - period states as observable transient excitations and report their signature in fourier space . after presenting the relevant setup",
    ", we give an analysis of half - period and quarter - period states in a simplified setting .",
    "we illustrate how these states emerge , respectively , as harmonic and 1:2 superharmonic resonances of a parametrically forced duffing oscillator describing the spatial dynamics of bec standing waves ( see appendices a and b for details ) .",
    "we subsequently monitor these states in appropriately crafted numerical experiments and examine their dependence on system parameters .",
    "finally , we also suggest possible means for observing the relevant states experimentally . the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we present the model and the analytical results . ( the details of the derivation of these results",
    "are presented in appendices ; appendix a discusses half - period states and appendix b discusses quarter - period states . ) we present our numerical results in section iii and summarize our findings and present our conclusions in section iv .",

    "furthermore , we observe that other states that can also be characterized as half - period ones ( which tend to have longer lifetimes than quasi - harmonic states ) are also formed during the time - evolution , as shown in fig . 3 at @xmath122 .",
    "these states , which we will hereafter call `` non - harmonic '' half - period states , have a shape which is definititvely non - sinusoidal ( in contrast to the quasi - harmonic states ) ; they are nevertheless periodic structures of period @xmath110 . in fact",

    "interestingly , the non - harmonic half - period states seem to persist as @xmath126 is increased , even when the resonance condition @xmath74 is violated .",
    "for example , we found that for time - independent lattices ( i.e. , @xmath115 ) , the lifetime of a half - period state in the resonant case with @xmath104 ( recall that @xmath29 ) is @xmath127 , whereas for @xmath128 it is @xmath129 .",
