    "over the last few years a significant amount of effort has been devoted to the study of spin chains of haldane  shastry ( hs ) type , due to their remarkable integrability properties and their interest in connection with several important conjectures in quantum chaos .",
    "this class of chains , intimately related to integrable dynamical models of calogero  sutherland type  @xcite , are characterized by the fact that the interactions between the spins are both long - ranged and position - dependent .",
    "for instance , in the original haldane  shastry chain  @xcite the spins occupy equidistant positions on a circle , the strength of the interactions being inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the spins measured along the chord . historically , this model was introduced while searching for a spin chain whose exact ground state coincided with gutzwiller s variational wavefunction for the one - dimensional hubbard model in the limit of large on - site interaction  @xcite .",
    "in fact , the hs chain can be obtained in this limit from the hubbard model with long - range hopping in the half - filling regime  @xcite . in haldane s original paper  @xcite ,",
    "the spectrum of the hs chain with spin @xmath1 was inferred on the basis of numerical calculations . in particular , it was observed that the levels are highly degenerate , which suggests the presence of a large underlying symmetry group and the possible integrability of the model .",
    "this symmetry group was subsequently identified  @xcite as the yangian @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the number of internal degrees of freedom . as to the model s integrability , it was established around the same time by fowler and minahan  @xcite using polychronakos s exchange operator formalism  @xcite .",
    "the rigorous derivation of the spectrum of the hs chain with arbitrary @xmath0 spin was carried out by bernard et al .",
    "@xcite by taking advantage of its connection with the generalization of sutherland s model to particles with spin  @xcite . at the heart of this connection is the mechanism known as polychronakos s `` freezing trick ''  @xcite .",
    "the physical idea behind this mechanism is that when the coupling constant of the spin sutherland ( trigonometric ) model tends to infinity , the particles concentrate around the equilibrium of the scalar part of the potential , so that the dynamical and internal degrees of freedom decouple .",
    "it can be shown that the coordinates of this equilibrium are essentially the hs chain sites , and that in this limit the internal degrees of freedom are governed by the chain s hamiltonian .",
    "the freezing trick can also be applied to the spin calogero ( rational ) model  @xcite , obtaining in this way a spin chain the so - called polychronakos ",
    "frahm ( pf ) chain  @xcite with non - equidistant sites given by the zeros of the @xmath4-th degree hermite polynomial , @xmath4 being the number of spins .",
    "the original calogero and sutherland models mentioned above are both based on the root system @xmath5 , in the sense that the interaction between the particles depends only on their relative distance . as shown by olshanetsky and perelomov  @xcite",
    ", there are integrable generalizations of these models associated with any ( extended ) root system , the rank of the root system basically coinciding with the number of particles .",
    "for this reason , the most studied models of calogero  sutherland ( cs ) type are by far those associated with the @xmath6 root system ( including the hyperbolic sutherland model )  @xcite , and to a lesser extent with the @xmath7 system  @xcite .",
    "a hyperbolic variant of the sutherland model of @xmath5 type with an external confining potential of morse type has also been considered in the literature , in both the scalar  @xcite and the spin  @xcite cases .",
    "for all the spin cs models mentioned in the previous paragraphs , a corresponding spin chain of haldane  shastry type has been constructed by means of the freezing trick  @xcite . in the case of the rational and trigonometric chains",
    ", this mechanism has been applied to derive a closed - form expression for the partition function in terms of the quotient of the partition functions of the corresponding spin and scalar dynamical models  @xcite , whose spectrum can be easily computed . expanding the partition function in powers of @xmath8 , one can compute the chain s spectrum for relatively large values of @xmath4 and determine some of its statistical properties .",
    "a common feature of all of these chains is the fact that when the number of sites is sufficiently large the level density is approximately gaussian .",
    "this result , for which there is ample numerical evidence , has also been rigorously established in some cases  @xcite .",
    "the knowledge of a continuous approximation to the ( cumulative ) level density is of great importance in the context of quantum chaos , as it is used to transform the raw energies so that the resulting `` unfolded '' spectrum has an approximately uniform level density  @xcite .",
    "the distribution of spacings between consecutive unfolded levels is widely used for testing the integrable vs.  chaotic character of a quantum system . indeed , according to a long - standing conjecture of berry and tabor  @xcite , the spacings distribution @xmath9 of a `` generic '' quantum system whose classical counterpart is integrable should follow poisson s law @xmath10 . on the other hand , the bohigas  giannoni ",
    "schmidt conjecture  @xcite asserts that the spacings distribution of a fully chaotic quantum system is given by wigner s surmise @xmath11 , characteristic of the gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) in random matrix theory .",
    "both of these conjectures have been shown to hold in many different systems , both in the integrable  @xcite and fully chaotic cases  @xcite .",
    "rather surprisingly , the spacings distribution of all the integrable spin chains of hs type studied so far is neither of poisson s nor wigner s type  @xcite .",
    "thus , at least in this respect , spin chains of hs type appear to be exceptional among the class of integrable systems .    unlike their rational or trigonometric counterparts , hs chains with hyperbolic interactions have received comparatively less attention in the literature .",
    "in particular , the spectrum of the hyperbolic @xmath6 chain is not known , whereas that of the @xmath5 chain has been conjectured  @xcite only for spin @xmath1 .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is precisely to fill this gap for the hyperbolic chain of @xmath5 type , which we shall henceforth refer to as the frahm ",
    "inozemtsev ( fi ) chain .",
    "although at the formal level this chain is the hyperbolic analog of the original haldane  shastry chain , in practice both chains turn out to be quite different . indeed , while the sites of the hs chain are equidistant on a circle , those of the fi chain are not and , moreover , depend on a parameter @xmath12 in a nontrivial way .",
    "we shall see that the energies of the fi chain also depend on this parameter , which complicates the statistical analysis of the spectrum .",
    "an important consequence of this dependence is the fact that for generic values of @xmath12 the spacings distribution is qualitatively different from that of the integrable spin chains of hs type studied so far . at any rate , for all values of @xmath12 the spacings distribution of the fi chain",
    "is neither of poisson s nor wigner s type , in spite of the fact that this chain is probably integrable  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec.themodels ]",
    "we recall the definition of inozemtsev s hyperbolic spin dynamical model and its scalar counterpart , and explicitly construct the frahm ",
    "inozemtsev spin chain by applying the freezing trick to these models .",
    "section  [ sec.specdyn ] is devoted to the computation of the spectrum of inozemtsev s spin dynamical model , which was partially known only in the case of spin @xmath1 .",
    "our approach is based on relating the hamiltonian to an auxiliary differential - difference operator , which we triangularize by expressing it in terms of suitable dunkl ",
    "cherednik operators of type a  @xcite .",
    "in section  [ sec.partfunc ] we use the freezing trick and the results of the previous section to derive a closed - form expression for the partition function of the @xmath0 fi chain . using this expression and some general results for other spin chains of @xmath5 type  @xcite ,",
    "we obtain a simple formula for the spectrum in terms of the usual _ motifs _  @xcite . in particular",
    ", this provides a rigorous proof of frahm and inozemtsev s conjecture for the spectrum in the spin @xmath1 case . with the help of the partition function , in section  [ sec.spectrum ]",
    "we analyze several statistical properties of the chain s spectrum . when @xmath13 , our numerical computations show that the level density is gaussian as the number of sites tends to infinity .",
    "taking as the spectrum unfolding function the cumulative gaussian distribution , we have also studied the density of spacings for large @xmath4 and different values of the spin when the parameter @xmath12 is @xmath14 .",
    "our calculations clearly indicate that the density of spacings exhibits the behavior previously found in other chains of hs type only when @xmath12 is an integer or a rational with a `` small '' denominator .",
    "the paper ends with two technical appendices in which we prove the existence of a unique solution of the system defining the chain sites , and derive a closed - form expression for the mean and variance of the chain s energies .",
    "in this section we describe inozemtsev s hyperbolic spin dynamical model  @xcite and its corresponding spin chain of haldane  shastry type  @xcite , whose study is the purpose of this paper .",
    "the hamiltonian of the spin dynamical model is given by @xmath15 where the sums run from @xmath16 to @xmath4 ( as always hereafter , unless otherwise stated ) , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and the operators @xmath20 permute the spins of the @xmath21-th and @xmath22-th particles .",
    "more precisely , let @xmath23 be the space of internal degrees of freedom , and denote by @xmath24 , with @xmath25 , an element of the canonical basis of @xmath26 .",
    "the action of @xmath20 on @xmath27 is then given by @xmath28 it is well known that the operators @xmath20 can be expressed in terms of the generators @xmath29 of the fundamental representation of @xmath0 for the @xmath30-th particle as @xmath31 where we have used the normalization @xmath32 .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the above model is completely integrable for arbitrary @xmath3 . regarding its spectrum , in the latter reference",
    "only a few eigenstates ( including the ground state ) and their corresponding energies were computed in the special case of spin @xmath1 ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "the hamiltonian   is the spin version of the scalar model @xmath34 previously studied in ref .",
    "@xcite . in particular , in the latter reference the spectrum of @xmath35 was computed in closed form , together with the eigenfunctions of the ground state and several excited states .",
    "it should be noted that , due to the impenetrable nature of the singularities of @xmath36 and @xmath35 in the hyperplanes @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) , the configuration space of both hamiltonians   and   should be taken as one of the weyl chambers of @xmath5 type , say @xmath39    we shall next apply polychronakos s `` freezing trick ''  @xcite to the spin dynamical model   in order to construct its associated spin chain of haldane  shastry type . to this end , we rescale the strength of the morse potential as @xmath40 and consider the strong coupling limit @xmath41 .",
    "the hamiltonian   can be written as @xmath42 where the scalar potential @xmath43 is given by @xmath44 we shall show in appendix  [ sec.minimum ] that @xmath43 possesses a minimum in the set @xmath45 if and only if @xmath46 and that this minimum is in fact unique .",
    "it follows that , as @xmath41 , the eigenfunctions of @xmath36 become sharply peaked around the unique minimum @xmath47 of @xmath43 in @xmath45 . since @xmath48 where @xmath49 in the limit @xmath41 the dynamical and internal degrees of freedom decouple , the latter being governed by the hamiltonian @xmath50 as shown in appendix  [ sec.minimum ] , the chain sites @xmath51 can be expressed in terms of the zeros @xmath52 of the generalized laguerre polynomial @xmath53 as @xmath54 recall , in this respect , that eq",
    "is precisely the condition which guarantees that the zeros of @xmath53 are positive and distinct  @xcite .",
    "in fact , since @xmath55 is invariant under @xmath56 , with @xmath57 a constant , we can alternatively define the sites of the chain   by the simpler formula @xmath58 we can also express the hamiltonian   directly in terms of the zeros @xmath59 of @xmath53 as @xmath60 we shall take eqs .  - as the definition of the hamiltonian of the frahm  inozemtsev chain , although it differs from the normalization used in ref .",
    "@xcite by a factor of  @xmath61 .",
    "if @xmath62 takes the value @xmath16 ( respectively @xmath63 ) the corresponding fi chain is of ferromagnetic ( respectively antiferromagnetic ) type .",
    "we shall sometimes use the more precise notation @xmath64 ( respectively @xmath65 ) to denote the hamiltonian of the ferromagnetic ( respectively antiferromagnetic ) chain . note finally that , unlike other spin chains of hs type associated with the @xmath5 root system , the hamiltonian of the fi chain depends on an essential parameter @xmath66 through the zeros @xmath59 .",
    "in this section we shall compute the point spectrum of inozemtsev s spin dynamical model   and of its scalar counterpart  . as is customary when studying quantum calogero ",
    "sutherland models with spin , we introduce the auxiliary _ scalar _ operator @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the coordinate permutation operator defined by @xmath69 the operator @xmath70 is naturally defined on ( a suitable dense subset of ) the hilbert space @xmath71 . on the other hand , due to the nature of their singularities on the hyperplanes @xmath37 ( with @xmath38 ) , the hamiltonians @xmath36 and @xmath35 act on ( appropriate dense subsets of ) the hilbert spaces @xmath72 and @xmath73 , respectively . however , proceeding as in ref .",
    "@xcite , one can show that these hamiltonians are isospectral to their extensions @xmath74 and @xmath75 to @xmath76 and @xmath77 , respectively , where @xmath78 and @xmath79 denote the projectors onto spin and scalar states with any fixed symmetry under particle permutations .",
