    "only the lightest elements ( hydrogen , helium , and traces of lithium , beryllium ) originate from a hot big bang phase in the early stage of the universe @xcite .",
    "all other nuclei have been produced thereafter in stars and stellar explosions .",
    "most nuclides above the fe group ( mass numbers ) originate from neutron captures and subsequent @xmath3 decays and thus are called neutron - capture elements @xcite .",
    "two main processes have been identified , the @xmath4 process ( slow neutron capture process , with a main component occurring in medium mass asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars and a weak component stemming from massive stars ) and the @xmath5 process ( rapid neutron capture process ) @xcite .",
    "the site of the latter process is disputed but core - collapse supernova explosions and/or neutron star mergers may provide viable alternatives @xcite .",
    "there are a number of proton - rich isotopes between se and hg which can not be produced by either process .",
    "they are called @xmath6 nuclei and further nucleosynthesis processes have to be invoked to explain their existence @xcite . among the originally 35 @xmath6 nuclei @xcite , large @xmath4 process contributions to @xmath7er , @xmath0gd , and @xmath8ta were found in modern agb models @xcite . also the abundances of @xmath9 in and @xmath10sn may receive contributions from the @xmath4 and/or @xmath5 process @xcite .",
    "the currently accepted production mechanism for the bulk of @xmath6 nuclei is the so - called @xmath1 process , synthesizing proton - rich isotopes by photodisintegration reactions @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1 process occurs in the outer layers of a massive star during its core - collapse supernova explosion @xcite . as an additional site , type ia supernovae have been suggested , where also the required temperatures are achieved @xcite . in both sites , quickly expanding zones of hot matter show production of @xmath6 nuclei when the reached peak temperatures are in the range . in order to produce the heavier @xmath6 nuclei it is necessary to stay at the lower end of this temperature range because they would be completely destroyed at higher temperatures . on the other hand , the higher end of the temperature range",
    "is required for the production of the light @xmath6 nuclei because lighter nuclei are more strongly bound and less easily photodisintegrated @xcite .",
    "the very rare @xmath11la can not be produced in a @xmath1 process but it was suggested to be formed through neutrino reactions on stable nuclei in core - collapse supernovae , the so - called @xmath12 process @xcite .    a @xmath1 process starts with ( @xmath1,n ) reactions on stable nuclei already present in the stellar plasma . when the temperatures remain high for a sufficiently long time , proton - rich isotopes are reached for which ( @xmath1,p ) or ( @xmath1,@xmath13 ) reactions are faster than ( @xmath1,n ) .",
    "this leads to a deflection of or branching in the nucleosynthesis path @xcite . due to the nuclear structure influencing the binding energies , ( @xmath1,p ) deflections are mainly found in nuclei with neutron number , whereas ( @xmath1,@xmath13 ) branchings are important in the region @xcite .",
    "_ stellar _ photodisintegration _ rates _ used in reaction network calculations are usually derived from _",
    "stellar _ capture _ rates _ by applying the principle of detailed balance @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that this reciprocity only applies to _ stellar _ rates , involving thermally excited nuclei in entrance and exit channel , but not to laboratory capture cross sections and their respective photodisintegration cross sections , unless the cross sections are dominated by single transitions between initial state , compound state , and final state @xcite .",
    "reactions involving light nuclei often include only a few transitions but this is never the case in the regime of high level - densities encountered in nuclei participating in the synthesis of @xmath6 nuclei .",
    "although direct ( @xmath1,n ) measurements have been performed also for intermediate and heavy nuclei ( e.g. , @xcite ) , it has been shown that these can not constrain stellar rates , as they only allow to study a single @xmath1 transition from the ground state of the target nucleus .",
    "its contribution to the stellar rate is less than 0.1% , contrary to capture data which allow to constrain a much larger fraction ( on the order of several tens of percent , depending on plasma temperature and the nuclear level structure ) of the stellar capture rate ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the contribution of ( @xmath1,p ) and ( @xmath1,@xmath13 ) ground - state transitions to the stellar rate is even lower due to the shift of the gamow window to higher compound excitation energies @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the ground - state contribution of the respective capture rates even is larger than those for ( n,@xmath1 ) at the same temperature due to coulomb suppression of transitions with low relative energy @xcite .",
    "this even applies to captures with negative reaction @xmath14 values on intermediate and heavy targets , allowing ground - state capture to always constrain a much larger fraction of the stellar rates than photodissociation measurements .",
    "although capture measurements still can not completely constrain a high - temperature stellar rate , either , they can be used to test the predictions of charged particle widths .",
    "proton and @xmath13 widths determine the stellar photodisintegration rates because @xmath1-process temperatures , although being high even for stellar plasmas , still translate to comparatively low nuclear interaction energies , below the coulomb barrier when involving charged particles .",
    "this results in charged particle widths being smaller than the @xmath1 widths and thus a dependence of the rates primarily on these charged particle widths rather than on the @xmath1 widths @xcite .",
    "experiments can probe the charged particle widths in capture reactions but the small cross sections at subcoulomb energies make it difficult to measure in the astrophysical energy range . therefore , astrophysically relevant data are scarce .",
    "the few available data have shown considerable deviations from predictions , especially for reactions with @xmath13 particles @xcite .",
    "low - energy proton captures have been found to be predicted more reliably , although small modifications to the optical proton+nucleus potentials have been suggested @xcite .",
    "proton capture reaction cross sections for the @xmath1 process have been measured before , e.g. , by . since ( p,@xmath1 ) above the ( p , n ) threshold are sensitive not only to the proton width but also to the neutron and @xmath1 widths , additional information is required to be able to distinguish the impact of the various widths ( see also ) .",
    "such information can be obtained through a simultaneous ( p , n ) measurement because the ( p , n ) cross section well above the threshold is mainly determined by the proton width .",
    "some ( p , n ) measurements have been performed on @xmath4 or @xmath5 process seed nuclei that affect the abundances of the light @xmath6 nuclei , e.g. , @xmath15ge @xcite , @xmath16se @xcite , @xmath17rb @xcite , and on a @xmath6 nucleus @xmath18te @xcite .    here",
    ", we present a simultaneous measurement of ( p,@xmath1 ) and ( p , n ) cross sections of @xmath0gd . although the @xmath1-process contribution to @xmath0gd is small and originates from ( @xmath1,n ) reactions on other gd isotopes , a determination of proton - induced cross sections at low energy of this proton - rich , heavy nucleus allows to test statistical model predictions well below the coulomb barrier . for the first time",
    ", it was also possible to determine proton capture reaction cross sections below the ( p , n ) threshold for this nucleus .",
    "the @xmath0gd(p,@xmath1)@xmath2 tb and @xmath0gd(p , n)@xmath0 tb activation measurements have been performed in an energy range between 3.47 and as a test of the statistical model predictions over a broader energy region .",
    "the details of the experiment are given in .",
    "the experimental cross sections are compared to predictions in the hauser - feshbach statistical model in . a summary and conclusions",
    "are provided in .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      experimental cross sections of @xmath0gd(p,@xmath1)@xmath2 tb and @xmath0gd(p , n)@xmath0 tb reactions . ]    as mentioned in , the product of @xmath0gd(p , n ) reaction has both a ground ( @xmath19 tb ) and an isomeric state ( @xmath20 tb ) .",
    "based on the results of a talys calculation @xcite , the contribution of @xmath20 tb to the ( p , n ) reaction cross sections is less than 0.9% .",
    "this contribution can be neglected , especially because the short - lived isomer decays by high probability ( 78.8% ) to the long - lived ground state of @xmath2 tb , and is therefore included in the counting of the ground state decay . for the ( p , n ) reaction , hence , measurements of only @xmath0gd(p , n)@xmath19 tb have been performed .",
    "the measured ( p , n ) cross sections determined from two different @xmath1 transitions , as explained in , were found to be statistically consistent with each other . as a result ,",
    "the weighted averages of the @xmath0gd(p , n)@xmath0 tb reaction cross sections deduced from these two @xmath1 transitions are presented .",
    "the uncertainty in the final results has been determined based on the propagation of partial errors : counting statistics ( 0.2% to 21% ) , decay parameters ( 0.4% to 9% ) , detection efficiency ( 5% ) , target thickness ( @xmath21 7% ) , and beam current integration ( less than 3% ) .",
    "the uncertainties in the effective center - of - mass energies range between 0.08% and 0.4% ; they were calculated with the srim code @xcite based on the proton energy loss in the targets .        in order to gauge the dependence of the cross sections on the various ingredients of the calculation and to understand what properties can be constrained by a comparison of predictions and experiment , it is useful to first consider the sensitivities of the astrophysical reaction rates and cross sections .",
    "the sensitivity @xmath4 of a cross section or rate @xmath22 is extensively discussed in @xcite .",
    "it is defined as @xmath23 as is the standard in general sensitivity analysis . in the current context ,",
    "the sensitivity measures by how much a rate or cross section @xmath22 changes when one of the averaged total widths @xmath24 appearing in the hauser - feshbach formalism is varied .",
    "for example , if the cross section changes by the same factor by which a width is varied , the sensitivity is , if it does not change , .",
    "the sign of @xmath4 provides information on whether the change in @xmath22 is in the same direction as the change in the width , i.e. , increase with increasing width , or in opposite direction , i.e. , decrease with increasing width .",
    "although the @xmath0gd(p,@xmath1 ) rate is not directly important in the @xmath1 process , its sensitivity to a variation of the total proton- , neutron- , and @xmath1 width is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sensi_rat ] .",
    "similar results are also obtained for most ( p,@xmath1 ) reactions in the @xmath6 nuclei range below @xmath25 . due to the coulomb barrier , the proton widths are quickly becoming smaller than the @xmath1 widths and thus dominate the sensitivity .",
    "therefore it is of astrophysical interest whether the present experimental data can confirm the predictions of proton widths .",
    "figures [ fig : sensi_pg ] and [ fig : sensi_pn ] show the sensitivities of the reaction cross sections of @xmath0gd(p,@xmath1)@xmath2 tb and @xmath0gd(p , n)@xmath0 tb , respectively , to variations of predicted total widths as function of center - of - mass energy , within the same energy range as shown in .",
    "all cross sections are insensitive to the total @xmath13 width as it is too small and therefore it is not shown in the figures .",
    "below the ( p , n ) threshold , the ( p,@xmath1 ) cross section is only sensitive to the proton width , above it the importance of @xmath1 and neutron width quickly increase with increasing energy .",
    "the situation is reversed in the ( p , n ) reaction cross section which becomes less and less dependent on the @xmath1 and neutron widths with increasing energy . in both reactions , however , the sensitivities on the two widths act oppositely .",
    "this has to be taken into account when trying to reproduce data for both reactions simultaneously .",
    "regarding the proton width , it dominates the cross section sensitivity at the lowest measured energies in the ( p,@xmath1 ) reaction and at the highest measured energies in the ( p , n ) reaction .",
    "it has to be noted that different nuclear properties enter the calculation of the widths ( for details , see sec.5.4 in @xcite ) . for the particle widths , most important are optical potentials required for the calculation of transmission coefficients and low - lying excited states .",
    "in the radiation width ,",
    "transitions to states at higher excitation energy are important @xcite and therefore this width is sensitive to the choice of @xmath1-strength function and nuclear level density .",
    "the latter enters because it is used above the last included discrete excited state in a nucleus ( see , e.g. , eq.64 in @xcite ) .    close to stability",
    ", nuclear spectroscopic information is abundant but nevertheless it is not trivial to decide at which excitation energy to set the cut - off for inclusion of experimentally determined nuclear levels in each nucleus .",
    "it is essential for the correct prediction of particle widths to use a _ complete _ level scheme . towards higher excitation energies , more levels",
    "are missed in experimental studies and the level information given in the usual databases can not be considered to be complete anymore .",
    "this may lead to misestimated widths in the calculation when contributing transitions are not included due to the missing excited states . in this case",
    "it is advantageous to only include the lowest experimental levels and use a theoretical level density above them , even when further levels have been identified at higher excitation energies ( see , e.g. , sec .",
    "5.4.2 in @xcite ) . a practical example for this has been discussed in @xcite .",
    "this is not an issue in @xmath1 widths close to stability because the mainly contributing @xmath1 transitions involve states at high excitation energies , in the unresolved resonance region , anyway @xcite .",
    "the theoretical calculations shown in have been obtained with version of the nuclear reaction code smaragd @xcite , which makes use of level schemes from @xcite , also included in the 2010 version of nudat @xcite . at most 40 experimental states",
    "are used for each nucleus , as long as they are found as a consecutive sequence of levels with known spin and parity assignment .",
    "a peculiar situation arises for the neutron widths in the reactions studied here : the ( p , n ) energy range measured here extends into a region of incomplete level information because only rotational bands with spins are known above 345 kev excitation energy in @xmath0 tb .",
    "varying neutron- and @xmath1-widths , as well as the included @xmath0 tb levels , it was found that a simultaneous reproduction of the ( p , n ) and ( p,@xmath1 ) data is only possible when using a theoretical nuclear level density above .",
    "this indicates that further , unidentified low - spin levels must be present in addition to the experimentally determined rotational bands , which is not surprising as the total level density is expected to strongly increase with increasing excitation energy .",
    "no such problem was found for the proton width , indicating that the relevant excited states at low energy are already included in the experimental level scheme .",
    "it should further be noted that the above treatment of excited states was also used to calculate the sensitivities shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : sensi_rat]@xmath26[fig : sensi_pn ] .",
    "therefore they differ from the sensitivities given in @xcite , which used the default nudat set of experimental states .",
    "as pointed out above , the low - energy proton width is the quantity of astrophysical interest here . as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : sensi_pg ] and [ fig : sensi_pn ] the cross sections are sensitive to the proton widths across all investigated energies .",
    "the additional dependence on the neutron- and @xmath1-widths can be addressed by simultaneously comparing to the ( p,@xmath1 ) and ( p , n ) data which exhibit different sensitivities , as discussed above . since the sensitivities are almost symmetric in the neutron- and @xmath1 widths , only the ratio between the two widths can be determined . for the reactions discussed here , however ,",
    "the neutron width is already well determined through the requirement of ( p , n ) cross section reproduction close above the threshold , which was also used to study the excited states cut - off .",
    "any remaining discrepancies between theoretical and experimental cross sections at the high end of the measured energy range of the ( p,@xmath1 ) reaction and close to the ( p , n ) threshold are likely due to deficiencies in either the theoretical description of the proton width through an optical potential or the @xmath1 width , which includes two only theoretically known quantities , the @xmath1-strength function and the nuclear level density .",
    "the action of the two widths can be distinguished , however , through their different impact on the ( p,@xmath1 ) and ( p , n ) cross sections .",
    "we compared the measured cross sections to smaragd predictions using different popular optical potentials while keeping all other ingredients to the calculations fixed .",
    "the results are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : pg ] and [ fig : pn ] .",
    "essential is a simultaneous reproduction of ( p,@xmath1 ) and ( p , n ) data . of special interest is the comparison with the three lowest ( p,@xmath1 ) data points which are below the ( p , n ) threshold , where the cross sections are only sensitive to the proton width . at all other energies ,",
    "the impacts of neutron- , proton- , and @xmath1-widths have to be disentangled .",
    "the semi - microscopic optical potential of @xcite , including low - energy modifications for astrophysics by @xcite ( marked lej in figs .",
    "[ fig : pg ] , [ fig : pn ] ) , was also used in the large - scale reaction rate calculations of @xcite .",
    "it results in a different energy dependence than observed in the low - energy ( p,@xmath1 ) cross sections although the absolute magnitude is reproduced well at these energies .",
    "there is also a problem at the higher energies .",
    "since the predicted cross sections are below the data for both reactions , it is not possible to amend this problem by changing the @xmath1- and/or neutron width .",
    "similarly to the potential by @xcite , the more recent potential by @xcite ( marked lane - consist. in the figures ) is the lane - consistent version of a potential obtained from a brckner - hartree - fock model using a local density approximation but with parameters fitted to recent experimental data .",
    "although the ( p , n ) cross sections at higher energy are reproduced well with this potential , the low - energy ( p,@xmath1 ) cross sections are significantly below the data .",
    "changing the ratio of the neutron- and @xmath1-width can not improve the overall agreement as it mostly affects the cross sections at the highest energies in the ( p,@xmath1 ) reaction and the ones at the lowest energies in the ( p , n ) reaction , while the ( p,@xmath1 ) cross sections below the ( p , n ) threshold remain unchanged .",
    "finally , it was found in previous work @xcite that an improved description of low - energy ( p,@xmath1 ) data is possible with a modified imaginary part of the potential by @xcite . also for the two reactions discussed here , use of this potential ( marked as mod lej in the figures )",
    "yields the best overall description of the data .",
    "a further slight improvement at low ( p , n ) and high ( p,@xmath1 ) energies can be achieved by increasing the @xmath1 width by about 10% but this does not change the conclusions regarding the proton optical potential .",
    "the reaction cross sections of @xmath0gd(p,@xmath1)@xmath2 tb and @xmath0gd(p , n)@xmath0 tb have been measured by the activation method at effective center - of - mass energies and , respectively , in order to extend the experimental database towards the heavier mass region for astrophysical reactions and to test the reliability of statistical model predictions . for the first time , ( p,@xmath1 ) cross sections below the ( p , n ) threshold of p+@xmath0gd were obtained , allowing to study the prediction of proton widths well below the coulomb barrier .    although the cross sections depend on a number of nuclear properties , by combining the ( p,@xmath1 ) and ( p , n ) data it was possible to disentangle the contributions of these ingredients and to focus on a test of the optical p+@xmath0gd potential . the measured cross section values were compared to hauser - feshbach statistical model calculations using the nuclear code smaragd @xcite .",
    "a good reproduction of all data across all measured energies can be obtained with the recently suggested potential by @xcite which is a modification of @xcite .",
