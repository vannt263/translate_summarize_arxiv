    "binary star systems are of astrophysical importance for various reasons .",
    "first , they compose an important portion of stars in the galaxy @xcite and thus theories about stellar formation and evolution should account for the binary nature of stars .",
    "second , binary stars allow us to directly measure the masses of their component stars . the determined masses in turn allow other stellar parameters , such as radius and density , to be indirectly estimated .",
    "these physical parameters help us to understand the processes by which binary stars form @xcite .",
    "in particular , the separation and mass of a binary system tell us about the amount of angular momentum in the system . because it is a conserved quantity , binaries with measured angular momentum",
    "give us important clues about the conditions under which the stars were formed .    despite the importance ,",
    "broad ranges of separations , distances , and component masses make it hard to detect and measure all binaries .",
    "nearby systems with wide separations may be directly resolved using high - resolution imaging , while systems with small separations can be detected as eclipsing or spectroscopic binaries .",
    "however , binaries with intermediate separations are difficult to be detected by the conventional methods .",
    "in addition , it is difficult to detect binaries if they are located at large distances or either of the binary components is faint . as a result ,",
    "samples are restricted to binaries in the solar neighborhood and are not complete down to low - mass stars . for a complete view of stellar multiplicity across a broad range of physical parameters , therefore , it is necessary to use a variety of observational techniques .",
    "gravitational microlensing can provide a complementary method that can detect and measure binaries that are difficult to be detected by other methods .",
    "microlensing occurs when an astronomical object is closely aligned with a background star .",
    "the gravity of the intervening object ( lens ) causes deflection of the light from the background star ( source ) , resulting in the brightening of the source star .",
    "if the lens is a single star , the light curve of the source star brightness is characterized by smooth rising and fall . however ,",
    "if the lens is a binary , the light curve can be dramatically different , particularly for caustic - crossing events , which exhibit strong spikes in the light curve . among caustic - crossing binary - lens events ,",
    "those with long time scales are of special importance because it is often possible to determine the physical parameters of lenses ( see more details in section 2 ) .",
    "the binary separations for which caustic crossings are likely to occur are in the range of order au , for which binaries are difficult to be detected by other methods .",
    "in addition , due to the nature of the lensing phenomenon that occurs regardless of the lens brightness , microlensing can provide an important channel to study binaries composed of low - mass stars .",
    "furthermore , most microlensing binaries are located at distances of order kpc and thus microlensing can expand the current binary sample throughout the galaxy .    in this paper , we report the detections and measurements of 2 binaries discovered from observations of long time - scale caustic - crossing binary microlensing events moa-2011-blg-090 and ogle-2011-blg-0417 . in  2 , we describe the basic physics of binary lensing and the method to determine the physical parameters of binary lenses . in  3 ,",
    "we describe the choice of sample , observations of the events , and data reduction . in  4 , we describe the procedure of modeling the observed light curves . in  5 , we present the results from the analysis .",
    "we discuss about the findings and conclude in  6 .",
    "for a general lensing event , where a single star causes the brightening of a background source star , the magnification of the source star flux depends only on the projected separation between the source and the lens as @xmath1 where the separation @xmath2 is normalized in units of the angular einstein radius of the lens , @xmath3 . for a uniform change of the lens - source separation ,",
    "the light curve of a single - lens event is characterized by a smooth and symmetric shape .",
    "the normalized lens - source separation is related to the lensing parameters by @xmath4^{1/2 } , \\label{eq2}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 represents the time scale for the lens to cross the einstein radius ( einstein time scale ) , @xmath6 is the time of the closest lens - source approach , and @xmath7 is the lens - source separation at that moment . among these lensing parameters @xmath6 , @xmath5 , and @xmath7 ,",
    "the only quantity related to the physical parameters of the lens is the einstein time scale .",
    "however , it results from the combination of the lens mass , distance , and transverse speed of the relative lens - source motion and thus the information about the lens from the time scale is highly degenerate .",
    "when gravitational lensing is caused by a binary , the gravitational field is asymmetric and the resulting light curves can be dramatically different from that of a single lensing event @xcite .",
    "the most prominent feature of binary lensing that differentiates it from single lensing is a caustic .",
    "a set of caustics form a boundary of an envelope of rays as a curve of concentrated light .",
    "the gradient of magnification around the caustic is very large . as a result ,",
    "the light curve of an event produced by the crossing of a source star over the caustic formed by a binary lens is characterized by sharp spikes occurring at the time of caustic crossings .",
    "caustic - crossing binary - lens events are useful because it is often possible to measure an additional lensing parameter appearing in the expression of the einstein radius .",
    "this is possible because the caustic - crossing part of the light curve appears to be different for events associated with source stars of different sizes @xcite . by measuring the deviation caused by this finite - source effect , it is possible to measure the source radius in units of the einstein radius , @xmath8 ( normalized source radius ) .",
    "then , combined with the information about the source angular size , @xmath9 , the einstein radius is determined as @xmath10 . the einstein radius is related to the mass , @xmath11 , and distance to the lens , @xmath12 , by @xmath13 where @xmath14 , @xmath15 is the distance to the source , and @xmath16 represents the relative lens - source proper motion . unlike the einstein time scale ,",
    "the einstein radius does not depend on the transverse speed of the lens - source motion and thus the physical parameters are less degenerate compared to the einstein time scale .    among caustic - crossing events , those with long time scales are of special interest because it is possible to completely resolve the degeneracy of the lens parameters and thus uniquely determine the mass and distance to the lens .",
    "this is possible because an additional lensing parameter of the lens parallax can be measured for these events .",
    "the lens parallax is defined as the ratio of earth s orbit , i.e. 1 au , to the physical einstein radius , @xmath17 , projected on the observer plane , i.e. @xmath18 with simultaneous measurements of the einstein radius and the lens parallax , the mass and distance to the lens are uniquely determined as @xmath19 and @xmath20 respectively @xcite .",
    "the lens parallax is measured by analyzing deviations in lensing light curves caused by the deviation of the relative lens - source motion from a rectilinear one due to the change of the observer s position induced by the orbital motion of the earth around the sun @xcite .",
    "this deviation becomes important for long time - scale events , which endure for a significant fraction of the orbital motion of the earth .",
    "therefore , the probability of measuring the lens parallax is high for long time - scale events .",
    "we searched for long time - scale caustic - crossing binary events among lensing events discovered in the 2011 microlensing observation season .",
    "we selected events to be analyzed based on the following criteria .    1 .",
    "the overall light curve was well covered with good photometry .",
    "at least one of caustic crossings was well resolved for the einstein radius measurement .",
    "3 .   the time scale of an event should be long enough for the lens parallax measurement .    from this search",
    ", we found 2 events of moa-2011-blg-090 and ogle-2011-blg-0417 . besides these events ,",
    "there exist several other long time - scale caustic - crossing events , including moa-2011-blg-034 , ogle-2011-blg-0307/moa-2011-blg-241 , and moa-2011-blg-358/ogle-2011-blg-1132 .",
    "we did not include moa-2011-blg-034 and moa-2011-blg-358/ogle-2011-blg-1132 in our analysis list because the coverage and photometry of the events are not good enough to determine the physical lens parameters by measuring subtle second - order effects in the lensing light curve .",
    "for ogle-2011-blg-0307/moa-2011-blg-241 , the signal of the parallax effect was not strong enough to securely measure the physical parameters of the lens .",

    "the @xmath21fun , planet , robonet , and mindstep groups are conducting follow - up observations of events detected from survey observations . the events were observed by using 12 telescopes located in 3 different continents in the southern hemisphere . in table",
    "[ table : one ] , we list the telescopes used for the observation .",
    "reduction of the data was conducted by using photometry codes developed by the individual groups .",

    "we present the light curves of events in figure [ fig : one ] and [ fig : two ] . to be noted is that the overall light curves including caustic crossings of both events are well covered by survey observations .",
    "this demonstrates that the observational cadence of survey experiments is now high enough to characterize lensing events based on their own data .",
    "the parts of light curves with 2455880 < hjd <",

    "these bumps were produced during the approach of the source trajectory close to a cusp of a caustic .",
    "@xcite pointed out that such triple - peak features help to better measure the lens parallax .",
    "in modeling the light curve of each event , we search for a solution of lensing parameters that best characterizes the observed light curve . describing the basic feature of a binary - lens light curve",
    "requires 6 parameters including the 3 single - lensing parameters @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath5 .",
    "the 3 additional binary - lensing parameters include the mass ratio between the lens components , @xmath25 , the projected separation in units of the einstein radius , @xmath26 , and the angle between the source trajectory and the binary axis , @xmath27 ( trajectory angle ) .",
    "in addition to the basic binary lensing parameters , it is required to include additional parameters to precisely describe detailed features caused by various second - order effects .",
    "the first such effect is related to the finite size of the source star .",
    "this finite - source effect becomes important when the source is located at a position where the gradient of magnification is very high and thus different parts of the source surface experience different amounts of magnification . for binary - lens events ,",
    "this happens when the source approaches or crosses the caustic around which the gradient of magnification is very high . to describe the light curve variation caused by the finite - source effect ,",
    "it is necessary to include an additional parameter of the normalized source radius , @xmath8 .    for long time - scale events , such as those analyzed in this work",
    ", it is required to additionally consider the parallax effect .",
    "consideration of the parallax effect in modeling requires to include 2 additional parameters @xmath28 , and @xmath29 , which represent the two components of the lens parallax vector @xmath30 projected on the sky along the north and east equatorial coordinates , respectively .",
    "the direction of the lens parallax vector corresponds to the relative lens - source relative motion in the frame of the earth at a specific time of the event .",
    "the size of the vector corresponds to the ratio of the earth s orbit to the einstein radius projected on the observer s plane , i.e.  @xmath31 $ ] , where @xmath17 is the physical size of the einstein radius .",
    "another effect to be considered for long time - scale events is the orbital motion of the lens @xcite .",
    "the lens orbital motion affects lensing light curves in two different ways .",
    "first , it causes to change the binary separation and thus the magnification pattern .",
    "second , it also causes the binary axis to rotate with respect to the source trajectory . in order to fully account for the lens orbital motion ,",
    "4 additional parameters are needed .",
    "the first two of these parameters are @xmath32 and @xmath33 , which represent the change rates of the projected binary separation and the trajectory angle , respectively .",
    "the other two orbital parameters are @xmath34 and @xmath35 , where @xmath34 represents the line - of - sight separation between the binary components in units of @xmath3 and @xmath35 represents its rate of change . for a full description of the orbital lensing parameters , see the summary in the appendix of @xcite .",
    "the deviation in a lensing light curve affected by the orbital effect is smooth and long lasting and thus is similar to the deviation induced by the parallax effect .",
    "this implies that if the orbital effect is not considered , the measured lens parallax and the resulting lens parameters might be erroneous .",
    "therefore , considering the orbital effect is important not only for constraining the orbital motion of the lens but also for precisely determining the physical parameters of the lens .    with all these parameters , we test three different models .",
    "in the first model , we fit the light curve with standard binary lensing parameters considering the finite - source effect ( standard model ) . in the second model",
    ", we additionally consider the parallax effect ( parallax model ) .",
    "finally , we take the orbital effect into consideration as well ( orbital model ) . when the source trajectory is a straight line ,",
    "the two light curves resulting from source trajectories with positive ( @xmath36 ) and negative ( @xmath37 ) impact parameters are identical due to the symmetry of the magnification pattern with respect to the binary axis .",
    "when either the parallax or the orbital effect is considered , on the other hand , the source trajectory deviates from a straight line and thus the light curves with @xmath36 and @xmath37 are different from each other .",
    "we , therefore , consider both the @xmath36 and @xmath37 cases for each of the models considering the parallax and orbital effects .    in modeling ,",
    "the best - fit solution is obtained by minimizing @xmath22 in the parameter space .",
    "we conduct this in 3 stages . in the first stage ,",
    "grid searches are conducted over the space of a subset of parameters and the remaining parameters are searched by using a downhill approach @xcite .",
    "we then identify local minima in the grid - parameter space by inspecting the @xmath22 distribution . in the second stage , we investigate the individual local minima by allowing the grid parameters to vary and find the exact location of each local minimum . in the final stage , we choose the best - fit solution by comparing @xmath22 values of the individual local minima .",
    "this multiple stage procedure is needed for thorough investigation of possible degeneracy of solutions .",
    "we choose of @xmath26 , @xmath25 , and @xmath27 as the grid parameters because they are related to the light curve features in a complex way such that a small change in the values of the parameters can lead to dramatic changes in the resulting light curve . on the other hand ,",
    "the other parameters are more directly related to the light curve features and thus they are searched for by using a downhill approach . for the @xmath22 minimization in the downhill approach ,",
    "we use the markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) method .",
    "once a solution of the parameters is found , we estimate the uncertainties of the individual parameters based on the chain of solutions obtained from mcmc runs .",

    ", we use an analytic hexadecapole approximation @xcite . in the region with large enough distances from caustics , we use a point - source magnifications .    in the finite magnification computation ,",

    "[ fig : three ] , we present the geometry of the lens systems where the source trajectory with respect to the caustic and the locations of the lens components are marked .",
    "we note that the source trajectories are curved due to the combination of the parallax and orbital effects .",
    "we also note that the positions of the lens components and the corresponding caustics change in time due to the orbital motion and thus we present caustics at 2 different moments that are marked in figure [ fig : three ] .",
    "these moments correspond to those of characteristic features on the light curve such as the peak involved during a cusp approach or a caustic crossing .",
    "to better show the differences in the fit between different models , we present the residuals of data from the best - fits of the individual models . for a close - up view of the caustic - crossing parts of the light curves , we also present enlargement of the light curve .    for both events ,",
    "the parallax and orbital effects are detected with significant statistical confidence levels .",
    "it is found that inclusion of the second - order effects of the parallax and orbital motions improves the fits with @xmath50 and @xmath51 for moa-2011-blg-090 and ogle-2011-blg-0417 , respectively . to be noted",
    "is that the orbital effect is considerable for ogle-2011-blg-0417 and thus the difference between the values of the lens parallax measured with ( @xmath52 ) and without ( @xmath53 ) considering the orbital effect is substantial .",
    "since the lens parallax is directly related to the physical parameters of the lens , this implies that considering the orbital motion of the binary lens is important for the accurate measurement of the lens parallax and thus the physical parameters .",

    "it is to be noted that both lens components of moa-2011-blg-090 and one component of ogle-2011-blg-0417 are m dwarfs which are difficult to be detected by other conventional methods due to their faintness .",
    "it is found that the lenses are located at distances @xmath81 kpc and @xmath82 kpc for moa-2011-blg-090 and ogle-2011-blg-0417 , respectively .    since full keplerian motion of the binary lens",

    "we note that the blended light of ogle-2011-blg-0417 comes very likely from the lens itself , implying that the lens can be directly observed .",
    "based on the measured mass of 0.57 @xmath0 , the primary of the binary lens corresponds to a late k - type main sequence star with an absolute magnitude and a de - reddened color of @xmath87 and @xmath88 , respectively .",
    "considering the distance of 0.89 kpc and assuming an extinction of @xmath89 and the color index of @xmath90 , the apparent brightness and color of the lens correspond to @xmath91 and @xmath92 , respectively .",

    "for ogle-2011-blg-0417 , the blended light comes very likely from the lens itself and thus it would be possible to check the orbital solution from follow - up radial - velocity observation .    studies of m dwarfs are important not only because they are the most abundant stars in the milky way but also they form a link between solar - type stars and brown dwarfs ; two mass regimes that might exhibit very different multiplicity characteristics . precise knowledge of multiplicity characteristics and how they change in this transitional mass region provide constraints on low - mass star and brown dwarf formation @xcite . despite the importance of m - dwarf binaries , only a few measurements of the binary fraction and distribution of low - mass stars have been made , e.g. , @xcite , and the samples are restricted to only binaries in the solar neighborhood . as a result , there are still large uncertainties about their basic physical properties as well as their formation environment . considering the rapid improvement of lensing surveys both in equipment and strategy , it is expected that the number of microlensing binaries with measured physical parameters will increase rapidly .",
