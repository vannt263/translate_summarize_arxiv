    "properties of mesons are key issues for understanding the confinement mechanism of qcd . within the traditional constituent quark models ,",
    "mesons are described as quark - antiquark ( @xmath14 ) states .",
    "this picture could explain successfully the properties of the ground states of the flavor su(3 ) vector meson nonet . however , there are many meson ( or mesonlike ) states that could not be explained as @xmath14 states . depending on their coupling to specific production mechanisms and their decay pattern ,",
    "these states are interpreted as molecular - type excitations or as tetraquark states .",
    "but , there is debate on their exotic structure , unlike for states that carry spin - exotic quantum numbers , e.g. @xmath15 , and hence can not be @xmath14 states .",
    "one has an example in the sector of light mesons with mass below @xmath16 gev , where the scalar mesons @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19  @xcite have been largely debated .",
    "long ago it was suggested that the @xmath19 and @xmath18 resonances could be weakly bound states of @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "the advent of chiral unitary theory has brought new light into this issue and by now the @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are accepted as dynamically generated states from the interaction of coupled channels @xmath21 in @xmath22 wave  @xcite .    similarly , in refs .",
    "@xcite , the former work of ref .",
    "@xcite on the @xmath23 interaction was extended to su(3 ) using the local hidden gauge formalism for vector - vector interaction and a unitary approach in coupled channels .",
    "this interaction generates resonances , some of which can be associated to known resonances , namely the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 , as well as the @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "the results obtained in those former works gave support to the idea of the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 as being quasimolecular states of two vector mesons . in reactions producing these resonances ,",
    "a pair of vector mesons are primary produced and these two vector mesons rescatter after the production , giving rise to the resonances that can be observed in the invariant mass distributions .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the important role of the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 in the @xmath26 decays was studied based on the vector - vector molecular structure of those resonances .",
    "related work was also done in ref .",
    "@xcite interpreting the @xmath6 radiative decay into these resonances .",
    "those latter works were then extended in ref .",
    "@xcite to study the decay of @xmath7 into @xmath27 and @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath7 into @xmath28 and @xmath29 . at the same time , in this latter work the ideas of ref .",
    "@xcite in the radiative decay were extended to the decay of @xmath4 , @xmath30 and @xmath7 .",
    "these hadronic and radiative decays for @xmath6 have also been addressed within a scheme where the @xmath24 , @xmath31 and @xmath25 states emerge as a result of glueball quarkonia mixing  @xcite . with the steady accumulation of experimental data ,",
    "new results are now available that can test these theoretical ideas and an update of the theoretical predictions has become timely . in particular the very recent cleo data on @xmath6 , @xmath32 and @xmath8 radiative decays  @xcite are most welcome .    in the present work ,",
    "we make a reanalysis of those decays taking into account the recent report of the cleo data .",
    "in addition to the @xmath6 and @xmath7 decays , we also made predictions for the radiative decay of @xmath8 and @xmath9 into @xmath33 , @xmath34 , or @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "we evaluate ratios of decay rates and can compare with eight experimental ratios .",
    "the agreement found with experiment is good , with one exception that will require future test due to present experimental difficulties .",
    "we extend here the formalism used in refs .  @xcite to study the decay of @xmath4 into @xmath36 and two interacting vectors , @xmath37 , that lead to the tensor state .",
    "the mechanism is depicted in fig .",
    "we follow the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite and write the @xmath38 and @xmath39 as a combination of a singlet and an octet of su(3 ) states @xmath40    the two @xmath41 states combine to @xmath42 , either with a @xmath43 or @xmath44 su(3 ) structure to match the su(3 ) singlet nature of the @xmath45 state .",
    "one obtains matrix elements for the @xmath46 and @xmath47 amplitudes with the results @xmath48 respectively , where @xmath49 is the @xmath50 matrix for the singlet of @xmath38 and the one of @xmath41 giving the vacuum and @xmath51 the corresponding part for the octet .",
    "similarly , for the @xmath52 and @xmath53 , we obtain @xmath54 respectively .",
    "it was found in ref .",

    "we apply the formalism to the same decay channels but from the @xmath9 state . in terms of quarks",
    "the @xmath9 state is the @xmath69 state with the same quantum numbers as the @xmath70 , with a radial excitation to the @xmath71 state of a @xmath69 potential .",
    "we then expect the same behavior as for the @xmath8 , which stands as the @xmath72 @xmath69 state . in the derivation",
    "we have only used two properties from the @xmath4 concerning these decays .",
    "first that it is an su(3 ) singlet , which can also be said of the @xmath30 state .",
    "the other dynamical feature is related to the okubo - zweig - iizuka ( ozi ) violation and the weight going into @xmath73 or @xmath74 in its decay , that we parametrize in terms of @xmath75  @xcite .",
    "given the fact that this is also a dynamical feature not related to the internal excitation of the @xmath69 quarks in the potential well , we shall also assume that the @xmath76 parameter is the same for @xmath5 as for @xmath4 .",
    "the normalization of the @xmath59 weights can be different but this will cancel in the ratios . with these two reasonable assumptions",
    "we can make predictions for the following four ratios that are discussed in the next subsection .",
    "we collect the new results on these two sets of reactions , which are @xmath8 and @xmath9 hadronic decays , respectively .    in ref .",
    "@xcite results were given for the ratios @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 , for @xmath81 , and the ratios were found compatible with experiments . we generalize them here to the @xmath8 decay .",

    "both assumptions hold equally here and hence the only difference in the results stems from an overall normalization , which disappears when ratios are made , and the momenta @xmath67 in the formula of the width , since now the @xmath114 mass is different to the one of the @xmath6 .",
