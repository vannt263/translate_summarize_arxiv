    "over the last decade , transport properties of one - dimensional systems consisting of coupled oscillators on a lattice have been the subject of many theoretical and numerical studies , see the review papers  @xcite . despite many efforts , our knowledge of the fundamental mechanisms necessary and/or sufficient to have",
    "a normal diffusion remains very limited .",
    "nevertheless , it has been recognized that conservation of momentum plays a major role and numerical simulations provide a strong evidence of the fact that one dimensional chains of anharmonic oscillators conserving momentum are super - diffusive .    in this paper we propose a new class of models for which anomalous diffusion is observed .",
    "the system under investigation presents several analogies with standard chains of oscillators , but , and it is our main motivation , has a simpler mathematical structure .",
    "let @xmath0 and @xmath1 be two potentials on @xmath2 and consider the hamiltonian system @xmath3 described by the equations of motion @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the momentum of particle @xmath6 , @xmath7 its position and @xmath8 the `` deformation '' .",
    "standard chains of oscillators are recovered for a quadratic kinetic energy @xmath9 .",
    "the dynamics conserves three physical quantities : the total momentum @xmath10 , the total deformation @xmath11 and the total energy @xmath12 with @xmath13 .",
    "consequently , every product probability measure @xmath14 defined by @xmath15 is invariant under the evolution . for later purposes ,",
    "let us also introduce the short - hand notation @xmath16    in this paper , we are mainly interested in the case @xmath17 ( except for instance in section  [ sec : secgeneral ] ) , which has the advantage of introducing more symmetries into the problem .",
    "the state of the system at time  @xmath18 is then more conveniently described by the variable @xmath19 with @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the dynamics can be rewritten as : @xmath22 the system can therefore also be interpreted as a fluctuating interface where the algebraic volume of the interface at site @xmath23 is given by @xmath24 and the energy by @xmath25 .",
    "we focus our study on the ( anomalous ) diffusion of the energy .",
    "the three quantities , momentum @xmath26 , deformation @xmath27 and energy @xmath28 , are conserved but , for reasons which will become clear later , our interest lies only in the `` volume '' @xmath29 and in the energy .",
    "energy transport properties depend strongly on the chosen time - scale .",
    "the first natural scale to consider is the hyperbolic scale where the system is followed on long times @xmath30 , the space being renormalized by a factor  @xmath31 , with @xmath32 .    to this end",
    ", we define the empirical energy / momentum / deformation measure as follows : @xmath33 at time @xmath34 , this measure is supposed to converge in probability to some macroscopic profile @xmath35 which has a density w.r.t . the lebesgue measure .",
    "if we assume that a _ local equilibrium hypothesis _ holds , it is not difficult to show that the expected macroscopic evolution equation for @xmath36 is given by a triplet of compressible euler equations : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the macroscopic current whose explicit expression is not important here . unfortunately , proving the local equilibrium hypothesis for ( [ eq : generaldynamics ] ) is out of the range of the current mathematical techniques .",
    "the main difficulty comes from our inability to show that the dynamics is ergodic ( in the sense of definition  [ def : ergo ] below ) .",
    "if the ergodicity is proved , in the time interval where ( [ eq : syslim0 ] ) has a smooth solution , the relative entropy method of yau ( see  @xcite ) can be adapted to show that the system has  ( [ eq : syslim0 ] ) as a hydrodynamic limit .",
    "hence , the problem can be reduced to proving the ergodic behavior of the underlying dynamics . deriving the convergence to  ( [ eq : syslim0 ] ) after the shocks is considerably more difficult since even the concept of a solution to a system of conservation laws is not fully understood .    to overcome the above mentioned lack of ergodicity of deterministic systems ,",
    "it has been proposed to add a stochastic perturbation to the dynamics .",
    "the theory of stochastic perturbations of hamiltonian dynamics has a long history .",
    "to our knowledge , the first paper on the ergodicity of infinite lattice models is  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "the added noise must be carefully chosen in order not to destroy the conservation laws we are interested in . in the general case @xmath39",
    ", the hamiltonian dynamics can be perturbed by a local noise acting on the velocities ( as proposed in @xcite ) but conserving the three physical invariants mentioned at the end of section  [ sec : description_model ] ( see section [ sec : secgeneral ] ) . with such additional noises ,",
    "the perturbed dynamics can be proved to be ergodic ( see theorem [ th : thgeneral ] ) , so that  ( [ eq : syslim0 ] ) is obtained as a hydrodynamic limit .",
    "however , our motivation being to simplify as much as possible the dynamics considered in  @xcite without destroyin g the anomalous behavior of the energy diffusion , we mainly focus on the symmetric case @xmath17 with a noise conserving only the two important quantities responsible of the anomalous transport behavior , namely the the energy and the volume .",
    "thus , we introduce a new stochastic energy - volume conserving dynamics , which is still described by ( [ eq : dyneq ] ) between random exponential times where two nearest neighbors heights @xmath24 and @xmath40 are exchanged ( see subsection  [ subsec : sto ] for a precise definition ) .",
    "observe that the noise still conserves the total energy and the total volume but destroys the conservation of momentum and deformation .",
    "therefore , only two quantities are conserved and the invariant gibbs measures of the stochastic dynamics correspond to the choice @xmath41 in  ( [ eq : invmeas007 ] ) .",
    "we denote @xmath42 ( resp .",
    "@xmath43 ) by @xmath44 ( resp .",
    "@xmath45 ) and we use in the sequel the short - hand notation @xmath46    the first main result of this paper is that the perturbed dynamics informally described above is ergodic ( see theorem  [ th:1 ] ) .",
    "consequently , before the appearance of shocks , the stochastic energy - volume conserving dynamics has a hyperbolic system of two conservation laws as a hydrodynamic limit ( see theorem  [ th : hl ] ) .",
    "in the second part of the paper we investigate the diffusion of the energy at a longer time - scale .",
    "if the process has a diffusive behavior then the relevant time scale is the diffusive one , where the system is studied over long times @xmath47 with space renormalized by a factor  @xmath31 .",
    "we claim that the system genuinely displays an anomalous energy diffusion so that the diffusive scale is not the relevant one .",
    "heuristically , we can interpret this anomalous diffusion as a consequence of the volume conservation law ( see section  [ subsec : linmodel ] ) .",
    "we start the infinite system ( [ eq : generaldynamics ] ) under the equilibrium distribution @xmath48 and consider first the fluctuation field in the hyperbolic time scaling : @xmath49 where @xmath50 is a smooth vector valued test function with compact support .",
    "we expect that @xmath51 converges in law to @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is solution of the linearized equation @xmath54 with @xmath55 the differential of @xmath56 at @xmath57 .",
    "hence , in the hyperbolic scaling , fluctuations evolve deterministically according to @xmath58 where @xmath59 \\partial_q$ ] and @xmath60^ * \\partial_q$ ] with @xmath61^*$ ] the transpose matrix of @xmath55 .    to see a nontrivial behavior of the fluctuation field , we need to look at @xmath62 on a longer time scale @xmath63 , for some @xmath64 . it is expected that , after subtracting the transport term appearing in the hyperbolic time scale , the field @xmath65 converges to some limiting field @xmath66 .",
    "the case @xmath67 would correspond to a diffusive behavior with @xmath66 the solution of the linear stochastic partial differential equation @xmath68 where @xmath69 is a standard space - time white noise .",
    "here , @xmath70 is the _ compressibility _ and @xmath71 the limiting _ diffusivity _ ( see ( [ eq : chi0 ] ) and ( [ eq : diff222 ] ) for the definitions of these quantities ) .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for a general background reference , and to @xcite for a rigorous proof of the convergence for asymmetric simple exclusion processes .    for the class of models we consider , our conjecture is that @xmath72 is in general strictly lower than @xmath73 .",
    "the value of @xmath72 and the nature of @xmath66 are not expected to be universal and should depend on some specific properties of the potentials .",
    "we also expect a similar picture when the deterministic dynamics ( [ eq : generaldynamics ] ) is replaced by the stochastic energy - volume conserving dynamics ( we then denote by @xmath74 and @xmath75 the corresponding diffusivity and current - current correlation function ) .",
    "this anomalous value of @xmath72 should be reflected in the divergence of the diffusivity @xmath76 ( @xmath77 for the stochastic dynamics ) in the large time limit @xmath78 .",
    "we are not able to study theoretically this problem for the deterministic dynamics and we have to turn to computer simulations of nonequilibrium systems in their steady - states .",
    "a chain of length @xmath79 is coupled at each extremity ( left and right ) to a thermal reservoir fixing the temperature ( @xmath80 on the left , @xmath81 on the right ) . in the stationary state @xmath82 ,",
    "the average current @xmath83 is measured ( see section  [ sec : sim ] for more precise definitions ) .",
    "the quantity of interest is the divergence exponent @xmath84 of the transport coefficient @xmath85 anomalous diffusion corresponds to @xmath86 .    for a normal transport",
    ", the link between the two situations can be seen through a green - kubo formula for the limiting diffusivity , which expresses the latter as a quantity proportional to the time integral of the equilibrium current - current correlation function ( see  ( [ eq : cbl ] ) and  ( [ eq : diff ] ) for a precise definition ) .",
    "it is widely accepted , but not proved , that for normal diffusive systems the limiting diffusivity coincides with the transport coefficient @xmath87 .",
    "for anomalous diffusion transport , @xmath88 and the current - current autocorrelation function which appears in the green - kubo formula is not integrable because it decays too slowly .",
    "consequently the limiting diffusivity is infinite .",
    "our second main results are the following .",
    "first , we show numerically that , for generic anharmonic potentials  @xmath1 , the dynamics ( [ eq : dyneq ] ) has an anomalous diffusion .",
    "we also show that this phenomenon persists if the deterministic dynamics is replaced by the stochastic energy - volume conserving dynamics , and that the divergence exponent  @xmath84 depends on the strength of the random perturbation . secondly ,",
    "for the stochastic energy - volume conserving dynamics and a harmonic potential @xmath89 , we compute explicitly the equilibrium current - current correlation function @xmath90 and show that it decays as @xmath91 for large @xmath18 ( see theorem  [ th : gk ] ) .",
    "this implies that the diffusivity @xmath92 diverges as  @xmath93 , which is a clear manifestation of the super - diffusion of the energy for this model .",
    "we present more precisely the model under investigation in section  [ sec : models ] .",
    "we first study the hydrodynamic limit in sections  [ sec : hyp_scaling ] ( presentation of the general result ) and  [ sec : erg ] ( proof of the fundamental ingredient for the limit to hold , namely the ergodicity of the dynamics ) .",
    "we then consider diffusion properties , starting with analytical results on the longtime tail of the current autocorrelation function , which can be obtained for harmonic potentials ( see section  [ sec : diffusive ] ) , and providing then scalings of the energy current obtained by numerical simulations of nonequilibrium systems in their steady - states in section  [ sec : sim ] .",
    "some proofs are gathered in the appendix .",
    "consider the finite box @xmath94 ( with @xmath95 ) .",
    "the product space @xmath96 is denoted by @xmath97 , and a typical element of @xmath98 is @xmath99 .",
    "the deterministic finite volume dynamics @xmath100 is defined by its generator @xmath101 where @xmath1 is a smooth convex potential such that the partition function @xmath102 is well defined for @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "the following microscopic energy - volume conservation laws hold for @xmath105 : @xmath106 ,   \\qquad { { { \\mathcal a}}}_n   \\eta_x = -\\nabla \\left [ j^v_{x-1,x } \\right],\\ ] ] where @xmath107 is the discrete gradient defined , for any function @xmath108 , by @xmath109 , and where the microscopic energy and volume currents are respectively @xmath110      the dynamics in the infinite volume @xmath111 , with formal generator @xmath112 is also very important . since the state space is unbounded , explosion problems can arise and the construction of solutions of the dynamics in infinite volume may become a technically non trivial problem . to avoid such issues ,",
    "we restrict ourselves ( apart from section  [ sec : sim ] ) to the case @xmath113 for some positive constant @xmath114 .",
    "then , the construction is quite standard since the pioneering work @xcite of lanford et al .",
    "we refer the interested reader to @xcite for further precisions . for any @xmath64 ,",
    "let @xmath115 be the set of configurations @xmath116 such that @xmath117 and equip @xmath118 with its natural product topology and its borel @xmath119-field .",
    "the set of borel probability measures on @xmath120 is denoted by @xmath121 .",
    "a function @xmath122 is said to be _ local _ if it depends of @xmath116 only through the coordinates @xmath123 , @xmath124 being a finite box of @xmath125 .",
    "we also introduce the sets @xmath126 ( @xmath127 ) of bounded local functions on @xmath120 which are differentiable up to order @xmath128 with bounded partial derivatives .    for each initial condition @xmath129 the existence and uniqueness of a solution to  ( [ eq :",
    "dyneq ] ) can be proved by a classical fixed - point argument _  la _ picard .",
    "the solution @xmath130 defines a process with continuous trajectories .",
    "moreover each path @xmath131 is a continuous and differentiable function of the initial data @xmath119 .",
    "we define the corresponding semigroup @xmath132 by @xmath133 for any bounded measurable function @xmath134 on @xmath120 .",
    "the differentiability with respect to initial conditions shows that the chapman - kolmogorov equations @xmath135 are valid . with these equations , probability measures @xmath136 invariant by the deterministic dynamics",
    "are characterized by the stationary kolmogorov equation : @xmath137 denoting the usual scalar product between two vectors @xmath138 by @xmath139 , and recalling the notation introduced in  ( [ eq : short_hand_notation ] ) , it is easily seen that every product measure @xmath140 defined by @xmath141 is invariant for the infinite dynamics . in the sequel , we denote the average of a function @xmath134 with respect to @xmath140 by @xmath142 .",
    "depending on the potential @xmath1 at hand , the properties of the dynamics can be very different .",
    "in the next subsection we discuss the case @xmath143 , which leads to a linear dynamics .",
    "a second remarkable potential is the exponential potential @xmath144 , corresponding to the so - called kac - van - moerbecke system , which is integrable ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "the corresponding system is related to the famous toda lattice  @xcite , _ i.e. _ a chain of oscillators with coupling potential @xmath145 , by a simple transformation .",
    "we consider here the specific case @xmath89 .",
    "the dynamics is then linear and can be solved analytically using fourier transform . to simplify the exposition we consider the dynamics in infinite volume .",
    "we introduce the @xmath128th mode @xmath146 for @xmath147 , the one - dimensional torus of length @xmath73 : @xmath148 then , the equations of motion are equivalent to the following decoupled system of first order differential equations : @xmath149 where the dispersion relation @xmath150 reads @xmath151 and the group velocity @xmath152 is @xmath153 by inverting the fourier transform , the solution can be written as @xmath154 note also that the energy of the @xmath128th mode @xmath155 is conserved by the time evolution , and that the total energy current @xmath156 takes the simple form @xmath157    we interpret the waves @xmath158 as fictitious particles similar to phonons in solid state physics . in the absence of nonlinearities , they travel the chain without scattering .",
    "if the potential is non - quadratic , it may be expected that the nonlinearities produce a scattering responsible for the diffusion of the energy . nevertheless , the conservation of the volume , which is expressed by @xmath159 plays a crucial role .",
    "the identity ( [ eq : consj ] ) is valid even if @xmath1 is not quadratic .",
    "it means that the @xmath160th mode is not scattered at all and crosses the chain ballistically .",
    "in fact , the modes with small wave number @xmath128 do not experience a strong scattering and they therefore contribute to the observed anomalous diffusion of energy . for anharmonic chains of oscillators ,",
    "a similar picture arises with @xmath161 replaced by the phonons . as the conservation of momentum for these chains is responsible for the small scattering of phonons with small wave numbers , the conservation of the volume for the model considered in this paper is responsible for the small scattering of the waves @xmath161 with small wave numbers .",
