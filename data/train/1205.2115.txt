    "_ friedel sum rule and conductance._the first step in calculating the conductance through the dqd using the friedel sum rule ( fsr ) @xcite is to use the following expression for the conductance @xcite @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the coupling of each qd ( @xmath69 , @xmath70 ) to its corresponding lead , and @xmath71 is the local density of states ( ldos ) of each qd at the fermi energy .",
    "the fsr ( valid if the ground state of the system is a fermi liquid , which is true in our case as long as @xmath72 @xcite ) expresses a relationship between @xmath71 and @xmath73 ( qd occupancy ) , @xmath74 where @xmath75 is given by @xmath76 and @xmath77 is the green s function for each qd , @xmath78 being @xmath79 the many - body self - energy , and @xmath80 the one - body part of the self energy , which can be calculated exactly by taking @xmath81 .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that , for the parameters used in this work , the integral in the calculation of @xmath75 is approximately zero ( within machine precision ) .",
    "therefore , the conductance per channel , per spin , can be calculated as , @xmath82 and the total conductance , through both channels , is given by @xmath83 as an example , we will use eqs .  ( 11 ) and ( 12 ) to calculate the conductance in the su(4 ) regime ( i.e. , @xmath84 ) , by using dmrg to calculate the ground state charge per spin @xmath73 for each qd for a wide range of @xmath85 values .",
    "we also apply a magnetic field that , contrary to previous works @xcite , couples to the spins in the dqd , but not to the orbital degree of freedom [ see eq .",
    "as there is complete symmetry between orbital and spin degrees of freedom in the su(4 ) regime , we should obtain similar results to the ones obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "indeed , this is what is shown in fig .",
    "[ figure7](a ) , where , at zero - field [ ( black ) thick solid line ] , one sees the three characteristic su(4 ) conductance plateaus at quarter- and half - filling . for these calculations ,",
    "we have used a small value of @xmath86 to place the dqd deep into the kondo regime ( at quarter- and half - filling ) . as shown",
    "previously @xcite , the magnetic field strongly suppresses the kondo effect at half - filling , but not at quarter - filling ( see ( black ) dotted thin lines ) , in agreement with the fact that orbital and spin degrees of freedom are equivalent in the su(4 ) kondo .",
    "the reason being that at quarter - filling one is left with an su(2 ) _ orbital _ kondo ( in this case , where the magnetic field couples to spins , while one was left with an su(2 ) _ spin _ kondo in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the field couples to the orbital degree of freedom ) .",
    "for @xmath87 the su(4 ) kondo has been completely suppressed at half - filling [ ( red ) dashed line ] .",
    "note that in panel ( b ) one sees very little field dependence in the _",
    "total_-charge variation with gate voltage for the whole range of field explored ( @xmath88 ) .",
    "this is deceiving , though , as there is obviously considerable dependence with field in the gate voltage charge variation _ per spin",
    "_ , as shown in panel ( c ) . in it , we see the interesting behavior at intermediate values of field ( @xmath89 , ( green ) dashed curve for spin up , and ( green ) solid dots curve for spin down ) , where , for gate voltage values for which the dqd passes through fluctuating valence regimes ( i.e. , close to charge degeneracy points ) , there are peaks ( dips ) in the spin down ( up ) occupancies ( see arrows ) . calculations ( not shown ) for larger values of @xmath68 lead to more pronounced peaks and dips .",
    "finally , note that for higher values of field ( @xmath34 , for example ) , the peaks and dips have been suppressed [ ( red ) dash - dot ( open circles ) line for spin up ( down ) in panel c ] .",
    "_ identifying regimes using dmrg density matrix elements._as a way of demonstrating the use of the density matrix elements ( dme ) to characterize different regimes in the dqd , we will compare dme results with those for specific correlations that are usually used for that same purpose .",
    "it is known that at half - filling the dqd passes through three different fixed points as the ratio @xmath90 varies from zero to slightly above one : su(2 ) @xmath91 su(2 ) , for @xmath92 , su(4 ) , for @xmath22 , and a charge ordered state for @xmath93 @xcite .",
    "figure [ figure8](a ) shows the evolution of spin [ ( red ) dashed line ] and pseudo - spin [ ( blue ) solid line ] correlations as @xmath90 varies from @xmath94 to @xmath95 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for definitions ) .",
    "first , concentrating on the su(4 ) point , one sees that both correlations are identical at that point , which is indicated by a dashed vertical line that separates the two regions associated to the other two fixed points . for small values of @xmath90",
    "the spin correlations dominate , the pseudo - spin correlations being very small .",
    "the opposite occurs for the @xmath96 region , indicating the charge ordered state @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ figure8](b ) , we show the corresponding dme results for all the half - filling configurations .",
    "the results neatly agree with the overall picture obtained through the correlations in panel ( a ) , demonstrating once more the use of dmes to uncover different phases in strongly correlated electron models ."
