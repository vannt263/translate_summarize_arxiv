    "the recent observation of superconductivity about 30 k in the layered iron selenides compound k@xmath11fe@xmath0se@xmath0 @xcite initiated extensive research on the iron selenide superconductors , which was formed by intercalating alkali metal between fese layers and had the thcr@xmath12si@xmath12-type structure ( fig .",
    "in contrast to the iron arsenide superconductors , a@xmath13fe@xmath14se@xmath0 ( a = k , rb , cs or tl ) is a new class of iron based superconductor .",
    "their electronic structures are very different from those in the iron arsenide compounds , that is , only electron fermi surfaces are presented around the zone corners while no hole fermi surface near the zone center , which is confirmed by the experimental measurement @xcite and the previous first principle calculations @xcite .",
    "the crystal structures of a@xmath13fe@xmath14se@xmath0 are complex since for different @xmath15 values there are different fe vacancy arrangement schemes.the x - rays , transmission electron microscopy , and neutron scattering measurements indicate that the composition of k - intercalated fese superconductors was close to k@xmath13fe@xmath16se@xmath0 with a fivefold expansion of the parent thcr@xmath0si@xmath0 unit cell in the @xmath17 plane , namely a @xmath18 fe - vacancies superstructure @xcite . another experiment show that there exists a rhombus fe vacancy pattern related to k@xmath13fe@xmath19se@xmath0 @xcite",
    ". however it is reported that in the same sample there exist two distinct phases , the insulating phase with well - defined @xmath18 fe - vacancies superstructure and another kfe@xmath0se@xmath0 phase containing no fe vacancies , the latter being suggested to be responsible for superconductivity @xcite . the composition and structure responsible for the suerconductivity is still in debate .",
    "most recently , li , na , ca , ba , yb , or eu layer is inserted between adjacent fese layers to optimize the superconduting properties of the iron selenides compounds @xcite .",
    "it is the surprising phenomenon that two superconducting phases were observed in k@xmath11fe@xmath12se@xmath0 with the one t@xmath10 of 30 k and another t@xmath10 of 40 k. in addition , two kinds of crystal unit cell with unexpectedly long lattice constant @xmath4=16.14  and @xmath4=20.48  were found to correspond to two superconducting phases , and the @xmath4=20.48  unit cell disappeared after one hour s exposure to air accompanying the t@xmath10 change from 40 k to 30 k. in the other reports , two superconducting phases were ever observed in k@xmath20fe@xmath21se@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "however , there are rare theoretical studies on the difference of crystal and electronic structures between these superconducting phases , and the reason for higher tc in new superconducting phase .    the wyckoff position of k atoms has a great influence on @xmath4 axis length of crystal unit cell and the fermi surface characters in kfe@xmath0se@xmath0 . in experiment the occupations of different wyckoff positions by alkali metal atoms are observed @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , the fact that no clear peak due to n - h vibrations is detected in infrared spectroscopy measurements @xcite excludes the existence of nh@xmath22 in kfe@xmath0se@xmath0 synthesized by the liquid ammonia method .",
    "so we can deduce that three superconducting phases of kfe@xmath0se@xmath0 with different lattice parameter @xmath4 should correspond to the different wyckoff position occupied by k atoms . in the paper",
    ", we focus on the effect of different wyckoff position of k atom in space group i4/mmm on the crystal structure and electronic properties of kfe@xmath0se@xmath0 , with k atom sited in @xmath1 , @xmath2 or @xmath3 wyckoff position respectively . the paper was organized as follows .",
    "firstly , we optimize the crystal structure and obtain the reasonable lattice constants of kfe@xmath0se@xmath0 , in agreement with the experimental values of @xmath4=14.04  , @xmath4=16.16  , and @xmath4=20.48  in three superconducting phases . secondly , the electronic structures of struc-4c is similar to those of struc-2a implying they have the similar superconduting behavior .",
    "the fermi surface of struc-2b exhibits the different characters , that is , the concentric cylinder like fermi surfaces are presented around @xmath6-z , which should have a necessary connection to the superconductivity with the higher t@xmath4=40 k.",
    "lastly , from three aspects of the fe - se - fe angle , electronic structures and the next neighbor superexchange interaction @xmath8 , we demonstrate that the struc-2b structure is closely related to the superconducting phase with t@xmath10=40 k , while struc-4c to the superconducting phase with t@xmath10=30 k in kfe@xmath0se@xmath0 synthesized by the ammonothermal method .",
    "in our calculations the plane wave basis method was used @xcite .",
    "we adopted the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) with perdew - burke - ernzerhof formula @xcite for the exchange - correlation potentials .",
    "the ultrasoft pseudopotentials @xcite were used to model the electron - ion interactions .",
    "after the full convergency test , the kinetic energy cut - off and the charge density cut - off of the plane wave basis were chosen to be 800 ev and 6400 ev , respectively .",
    "the gaussian broadening technique was used and a mesh of @xmath23 k - points were sampled for the brillouin - zone integration . in the calculations ,",
    "the lattice parameters with the internal atomic coordinates were optimized by the energy minimization .",
    "the struc-4c tetragonal unit cell should have included four k atoms , but only two k atoms is included in order to keep the same composition k : fe : se=1:2:2 for struc-2a , struc-2b and struc-4c .",
    "[ b ]    .[tab : table1 ] the lattice parameters @xmath4 , the fe - se - fe bond angle @xmath24 and the se height @xmath25 to fe plane of kfe@xmath0se@xmath0 in several magnetic orderings for the struc-2a , struc-2b and struc-4c phases . in bicoll - afm order the lattice constants @xmath26 shrinking lead to the decrease of @xmath24 along the fm direction and the distortion of fe layer lead to the fluctuation of @xmath25 , shown in bracket . for the struc-2b",
    "the bicoll - afm state is not stable . [",
    "cols=\"<,<,^,^,^ \" , ]     to qualify the magnetic interactions , we can assume that the energy differences among these magnetic orders mainly originate from the interactions between each two fe moments with spin @xmath27 .",
    "then the frustrated heisenberg model with the nearest , next nearest and third next nearest neighbor couplings @xmath28 , @xmath8 and @xmath29 can be used to describe the interactions in kfe@xmath0se@xmath0 system , namely , @xmath30 whereas @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 denote the summation over the nearest , next - nearest , and next - next - nearest neighbors , respectively . from the energy data in table .",
    "[ tab : table2 ] , the superexchange coupling parameters j@xmath34 and j@xmath0 are shown in the rightmost column in table . [",
    "tab : table2](the detailed calculation is referred to appendix of ref . ) .    by comparing these exchange coupling values ,",
    "we notice that the struc-2a and struc-4c phases have the similar features in the magnetic interactions , but the struc-2b phase is somewhat different from them . here",
    "we should pay close attention to the next neighbor superexchange interaction @xmath8 in three structures .",
    "theoretically , the two band model @xmath35 indicates that the t@xmath10 in iron based superconductor is proportional to the @xmath8 @xcite and we also have drawn the same conclusion in the previous first principles studies on the iron based materials @xcite . from this point of view , we can obtain the results that struc-2b phase has the higher superconducting transition temperature t@xmath10 than struc-2a and struc-4c , and the latter two structures have the similar t@xmath4 values , because the next neighbor superexchange interaction @xmath36 in struc-2b is larger than @xmath37 in struc-2a and @xmath38 in struc-4c .",
    "the opinion that the higher t@xmath10 superconduting phase occur in the struc-2b structure is consistent with our analysis about both the fermi surface features and the fe - se - fe angle .",
    "the consistency is easy to understand because the superexchange interaction @xmath8 between two next nearest neighbor fe atoms is bridged by se atom and has a direct connection to the fe - se - fe angle .",
    "in addition , we do some discussion about the issue why k atom can locate in @xmath2 or @xmath3 wyckoff position . fixed the lattice parameters to the experimental values",
    ", we optimize the k positions with initial k position sited in the @xmath1 , @xmath2 or @xmath3 respectively .",
    "the k positions do not change from the initial @xmath1 or @xmath3 to @xmath2 position with the fixed @xmath4 axis at 20.48  , or from the initial @xmath1 or @xmath2 to @xmath3 with the fixed @xmath4 axis at 16.16  .",
    "these calculations indicate that the struc-2b and struc-4c are the metastable structure phases relative to the struc-2a . as to the formation of these metastable phases",
    ", we can assume the process happened as blow .",
    "at first , the nh@xmath22 molecules and k atoms enter in between fese layers together and k atoms sit in @xmath2 or @xmath3 wyckoff positions , leading to the large length of lattice c. then , nh@xmath22 escape from the compounds and k atoms still sit in @xmath2 or @xmath3 position .",
    "we also investigate the energy change with the lattice parameter @xmath4 increasing for the struc-2a , struc-2b and struc-4c respectively . when the length of lattice parameter @xmath4 is large than 18.58  , the energy of the struc-4c begin to become less than the one of struc-2a phase . when the parameter @xmath4 is larger than 20.85  , the struc-2b energy is the lowest one among three structure phases .",
    "the results mean that with the large lattice parameter @xmath4 the k atom prefers to occupy the @xmath3 or @xmath2 wyckoff position .    in summary",
    ", we have investigated the effect of different wyckoff position of k atom on the crystal structure of kfe@xmath0se@xmath0 by the first principle calculations .",
    "we conclude that the occupations of wyckoff position @xmath2 and @xmath3 by k atom correspond to the t@xmath10=40 k and t@xmath10=30 k superconducting phases in experiment respectively , which are demonstrated by the calculated lattice parameters , fe - se - fe angle , electronic structures and superexchange coupling @xmath8 .",
    "our results have a good agreement with the experiment and provide a reasonable approach to understand the new superconducting phases in kfe@xmath0se@xmath0 .",
