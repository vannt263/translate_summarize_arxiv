    "voids are some of the most striking large - scale features of the universe .",
    "historically , their study can be loosely grouped into two categories : finding individual voids or using a statistical approach ( see @xcite for a detailed review of the history of void studies ) .",
    "the first focuses on identifying individual voids with sophisticated void - finding algorithms @xcite that allow voids to have any convex shape .",
    "the properties of galaxies in voids can then be studied , including their color distribution , luminosity function , concentrations and star - formation rates @xcite . @xcite",
    "analyze the recently - completed 2df galaxy redshift survey and find that void galaxies are , on average , bluer and show evidence for more recent star - formation than the full 2df galaxy population .",
    "properties of voids themselves can also be studied , including characteristic sizes , mean ellipticities , and radial density profiles .",
    "many of these observational quantities , such as size measurements , can only be interpreted with carefully constructed mock galaxy catalogs .",
    "extensive theoretical work has been carried out concerning void size distributions and density profiles @xcite , void halo properties @xcite , formation of galaxies within voids @xcite , and the properties of galaxies in voids @xcite",
    ". the question of whether simulations can produce voids as large and as empty as voids seen in the observed universe remains unanswered , and can potentially provide powerful constraints on galaxy formation and cosmology @xcite .",
    "the second approach to voids is somewhat more statistical and is in many ways complementary to the first .",
    "studies of this type focus primarily on the void probability function ( vpf ) which is defined as the probability that a sphere of a given size centered on a random point in the survey volume contains no galaxies . statistical void distributions in principle offer a wealth of information , as they can be related to the entire hierarchy of galaxy correlation functions @xcite . yet , due to the difficulties in interpreting void statistics , they have not received as much attention as more conventional statistical measures of large - scale structure such as the two - point correlation function . despite these difficulties , the theoretical framework underlying void statistics has been developed in detail @xcite , and has been extensively studied in simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "observationally , voids statistics have been investigated in almost every major galaxy redshift survey , including the cfa @xcite , ssrs @xcite , pscz @xcite , iras @xcite , lcrs @xcite and most recently , the 2df survey @xcite .",
    "results from the latter survey are representative of an emerging consensus ; subsamples of brighter and/or redder galaxies contain larger voids than samples of fainter and/or bluer galaxies .",
    "this is interpreted as brighter and/or redder populations being more strongly clustered than fainter and/or bluer subsamples .",
    "these trends are also reflected in the two - point correlation function of galaxies , @xmath2 , both at low ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and moderate ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) redshifts .",
    "we note that some studies of voids have not taken into account the fact that galaxy populations have different number densities which will strongly affect void statistics ; hence differences in the vpf across galaxy populations might as easily be attributable to the luminosity function as to varying clustering strengths .",
    "as brighter galaxies are rarer than fainter galaxies , even in volume - limited samples , brighter samples will have higher void probabilities . a critical question we wish to address here",
    "is the extent to which void statistics are governed by low - order clustering statistics .",
    "it is therefore important to separate the effects of clustering from the effects of number density on the vpf .",
    "void statistics can also be used to probe the relation between galaxies and dark matter .",
    "there are strong theoretical arguments that show that the clustering strength of dark matter and galaxies should be different ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "galaxies initially form in high density peaks of the dark matter distribution and hence are `` biased '' tracers of the dark matter at high redshift .",
    "baryonic physics and cosmic evolution also lead one to expect that the biasing between galaxies and dark matter should , in principle , be a function of scale , redshift , and galaxy properties such as color and luminosity .",
    "many of these expectations have been borne out in observations ( see for example * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    by studying voids in observational samples and comparing to dark matter simulations",
    ", one can hope to probe the galaxy bias in a unique way .",
    "the vpf has previously been studied in simulations where a biasing prescription was assumed in order to place galaxies in the dark matter distribution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite find that the vpf has limited utility in probing the bias , as the relation between dark matter and galaxies changes as a function of the sampling density of a galaxy survey . @xcite and",
    "@xcite however , find that the vpf can be a powerful discriminator between various biasing schemes , but that it is relatively insensitive to the value of the linear bias factor @xmath6 .",
    "for example , the vpf is very different , for fixed @xmath7 , when one statistically identifies galaxies with overdensities in the initial density field ( ` peaks biasing ' ) versus identifying galaxies with overdensities in the final matter distribution ( ` density biasing ' ) .",
    "more recently , the halo model ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) has emerged as a useful prescription for placing galaxies within dark matter simulations . instead of using a biasing scheme such as ` peaks biasing ' or ` density biasing ' to relate galaxies to the dark matter distribution , the halo model places galaxies within virialized dark matter halos as a function of the halo mass .",
    "although in principle the parameters of the halo model can evolve with cosmic time , there is evidence to suggest that the model does not strongly evolve from @xmath0 to @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "@xcite find that the vpf can be used to determine halo model parameters such as the minimum dark matter halo mass , @xmath8 , in which a galaxy of a given luminosity may exist , and can hence provide useful new constraints on the relation between galaxies and dark matter . in this paper",
    "we explore in detail the possibility of using the vpf to constrain the halo model .    until now , there has not been sufficient data to study the statistics of voids at intermediate redshift ( @xmath9 ) . from correlation function measurements using the deep2 dataset at @xmath0 @xcite",
    "we know that galaxies were in general less strongly clustered in the past ; one might expect this trend to be reflected in void statistics as well . as more data becomes available at higher redshifts , the importance of self - consistently investigating the evolution of galaxy properties and statistics can not be overemphasized .",
    "this entails using similar selection and analysis techniques at different redshifts .",
    "for this reason , we have chosen to include in this study an analysis of the sdss , which now has data for @xmath10 galaxies at @xmath11 , to allow for robust conclusions concerning the evolution of void statistics .",
    "it should be kept in mind that the two approaches to the study of voids outlined above use the term `` void '' in very different ways .",
    "while the first approach identifies voids as large underdensities in the galaxy distribution , allowing a void to assume any convex shape and allowing galaxies to exist inside voids , the second approach identifies voids as spherical regions in which surveyed galaxies are totally absent .",
    "furthermore , while the first approach only locates `` unique '' voids , insofar as it does not allow smaller `` sub - voids '' to be contained within larger voids , the second approach allows for `` voids '' to overlap ( see @xmath12[s : deep ] for a visualization of this idea ) .",
    "the statistical approach is only interested in the question : what is the probability that a given volume element in the universe is empty ? in this paper we are concerned with the second , statistical approach , and hence we define voids in the latter sense .    the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in @xmath12[s : thy ] we outline the theory behind void statistics and point out several problems that arise with the theoretical underpinnings of voids .",
    "@xmath12[s : meth ] describes our methodology .",
    "we statistically analyze voids in mock galaxy catalogs built from n - body simulations in @xmath12[s : mocks ] ; in @xmath12[s : deep ] we present our results from the deep2 galaxy survey at @xmath0 and in @xmath12[s : sdss ] we analyze the sdss galaxy survey at @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath12[s : disc ] discusses the implications and relevance of our results . throughout this paper",
    "we assume a flat concordance @xmath5cdm cosmology with @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 @xmath16 km s@xmath17 mpc@xmath17 .",
    "the void probability function ( vpf ) is defined as the probability of finding no galaxies inside a sphere of radius @xmath18 , randomly placed within a sample .",
    "the most common theoretical interpretation of the vpf is as an infinite sum of the hierarchy of correlation functions of the galaxy distribution @xcite .",
    "specifically , for spherical volume elements one may write the vpf as : @xmath19,\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the sphere radius , @xmath20 is the average number of galaxies within the sphere , and @xmath21 is the volume averaged @xmath22-point correlation function , where the volume average is defined by @xmath23    as @xmath24 depends on a recurring factor of @xmath20 , any meaningful comparison of @xmath24 between populations requires a careful handling of their number densities . for many comparisons made in this study , we choose to remove the dependency on @xmath20 by randomly diluting the samples to have similar number densities . in this way we can isolate the effects of clustering on the vpf .",
    "the vpf takes a much simpler form if one uses the hierarchical _ ansatz _ , @xmath25 to relate the hierarchy of correlation functions to the two - point function , @xmath3 .",
    "this allows for a complete and relatively simple description of the entire cosmological density field .",
    "ansatz _ has been formally derived only for an @xmath26 universe with the additional assumptions of stable clustering and self - similarity @xcite , which are both known to be invalid . in the linear regime ( @xmath27 mpc )",
    "perturbation theory seems to validate the _ ansatz _ , although this paper is largely confined to smaller scales .",
    "so far , the _ ansatz _ has not been ruled out by observations ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although it is worth mentioning that baugh et al . had to remove the largest structure in their sample in order to recover scale invariant @xmath28 values .",
    "there is no reason to believe that the _ ansatz _ should hold in the quasi - linear to strongly nonlinear regimes .",
    "although historically the @xmath28 values were assumed to be scale invariant , nothing in the formalism developed below requires them to be . with the hierarchical _ ansatz _",
    "the vpf becomes : @xmath29.\\ ] ] @xcite noted that eqn .",
    "[ eqn : fry ] could be manipulated to isolate the effects of the scaling coefficients ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "fry defined the reduced void probability function , @xmath30 : @xmath31 which , with the substitution of eqn .",
    "[ eqn : fry ] becomes : @xmath32 with this definition , @xmath33 becomes the independent variable , and hence only populations of galaxies with different @xmath28 values will have different reduced vpfs .",
    "although @xmath33 will in general have a different dependence on @xmath18 for each galaxy population , this quantity will always be an increasing function of @xmath18 since @xmath34 and @xmath35 with @xmath36 for all of the populations considered here .",
    "we now briefly summarize several models which predict values for the @xmath28 values .      as the dynamical equations governing gravitational clustering can not be solved in the weakly to strongly nonlinear regime using perturbation theory ( or any of its offspring ) ,",
    "various phenomenological models have been proposed to relate the higher order correlation functions to the two - point correlation function .",
    "these models provide a complete description of gravitational clustering , yet each is inadequate either theoretically or observationally .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : models ] for examples of predictions of the vpf from some of the more popular models ; for a detailed treatment see @xcite .    in a poisson model ,",
    "all moments with @xmath37 vanish , and the vpf can be described simply by : @xmath38 a gaussian model is almost as simple and equally inapplicable to the statistics of large scale structure in the universe on nonlinear scales at late times .",
    "this model implies that the entire statistical distribution is described by the two - point moment ( in this case @xmath3 ) and that all higher moments identically vanish .",
    "the gaussian and poisson models are obviously not actually hierarchical models ; we include them under hierarchical models for simplicity .",
    "more realistic models rely on the hierarchical _ ansatz _ to specify all possible moments of the galaxy distribution .",
    "these models can be thought of as prescriptions for the @xmath28 scaling coefficients .",
    "the simplest model in this case forces @xmath39 for all @xmath22 and is sensibly called the ` minimal ' model @xcite . yet another model was motivated by an attempt to combine the hierarchical _ ansatz _ with the bbgky kinetic equations @xcite .",
    "the bbgky model becomes unphysical for large void radii , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : models ] where @xmath30 becomes negative for @xmath40 .",
    "the ` thermodynamic model ' was first proposed by @xcite and arose from a theory which treated galaxy clustering by analogy to statistical mechanics .",
    "it was later extended into a more self - consistent model by @xcite : @xmath41/\\bar{n}\\bar{\\xi},\\ ] ] @xmath42    intriguingly , a model developed by @xcite which combines an excursion set approach to the evolution of the halo mass function with a simple model for the spatial distribution of such halos predicts the same values for @xmath28 .",
    "@xcite points out that this theory is only strictly true for large volumes , and that the derivations do not apply for @xmath43 ( @xmath44 @xmath45 mpc ) .",
    "it is also difficult to understand how such large scales could have become thermodynamically relaxed over the age of the universe .",
    "@xcite compared this model prediction to the vpf from the cfa survey , but their results were inconclusive .",
    "they did find , however , that volume limited subsamples of different minimum luminosities were hierarchically related in that samples with different @xmath20 and @xmath3 , had similar @xmath28 .",
    "the final model we consider has had a colorful history .",
    "the negative binomial distribution , also known as the modified bose - einstein distribution , was used early on by @xcite to study the count distribution of charged hadrons resulting from high - energy collisions and by @xcite to describe the observed distribution of zwicky clusters .",
    "the model can be described by : @xmath46 @xmath47 @xmath48^{1/\\bar{\\xi}}.\\ ] ]    @xcite analyzed the reduced vpf in the ssrs2 and cfa redshift surveys but could not discriminate between the thermodynamic and negative binomial models because of the size of their errors .",
    "the negative binomial distribution was re - derived in their appendix by considering a sample divided into small cells , with the occupation probability of each cell depending only on @xmath3 , and being independent of the other cells ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "unfortunately , the derivation contains little insight into the physical mechanisms that might drive point distributions to become negative binomial .",
    "this model has also been derived from thermodynamic arguments @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite independently analyzed the cfa survey and found the data to be more consistent with the negative binomial than thermodynamic model over a range of luminosity thresholds and morphological types , though the agreement between model and data was not conclusive .",
    "most recently , @xcite found that galaxies in the 2df survey follow the negative binomial model over a range of differential luminosity bins .",
    "the astute reader will have noticed two problems with the theoretical models presented above , one related to convergence and the other to the unintuitive nature of the sums in eqns .",
    "[ eqn : vpf ] , [ eqn : fry ] and [ eqn : chi ] .",
    "the form for the @xmath28 values associated with the thermodynamic and negative binomial models ( eqns .",
    "[ eqn : s_thermo ] and [ eqn : s_nb ] ) can be understood as arising from a taylor series expansion for the given @xmath30 values in eqns .",
    "[ eqn : thermo ] and [ eqn : nb ] .",
    "such an expansion is , however , only valid for @xmath49 ; the sum rapidly diverges if @xmath50 .",
    "the conclusion must be that the @xmath28 values often quoted for these models can not be correct for large @xmath33 , i.e. for @xmath51 @xmath45 mpc ( the precise @xmath52 at which @xmath53 depends on the sample ) .    realizing this issue , we have explored other forms for the @xmath28 values such that the sums in eqns .",
    "[ eqn : fry ] and  [ eqn : chi ] do converge .",
    "simplistic models such as : @xmath54 where a and b are free parameters , are consistent with recent observations of @xmath28 for @xmath55 @xcite and are also consistent with @xmath56 for small @xmath22 .",
    "although the sums converge with these @xmath28 values , they do not converge to a hierarchical model ; in fact , for many values of a and b , the sums converge to non - physical values ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "it is unclear how far one should pursue this , given ( 1 ) that the @xmath28 values are probably scale - dependent , and here we have assumed that they are not , ( 2 ) there is no theoretical reason to suspect that the higher - order moments should be simply proportional to a power of @xmath2 , and ( 3 ) though mathematically valid , the expansion of @xmath24 in terms of @xmath58 is not terribly useful in practice .    to illustrate ( 3 ) consider the following .",
    "one might think that increasingly higher - order moments would be increasingly _ irrelevant _ for void statistics .",
    "in fact , we have explicitly computed the sum in eqn .",
    "[ eqn : vpf ] for the first eight correlation functions in large galaxy mock catalogs and find that the resulting partial sum in no way approximates the vpf measured from the same mock catalogs .",
    "it seems that increasingly higher - order moments are , in fact , increasingly _",
    "relevant_.    in order to gain a clearer understanding of this we have investigated the sequence of partial sums of eqn .  [ eqn : vpf ] using the @xmath28 values given in eqn .  [ eqn : sp ] .",
    "we find that the sequence of partial sums for @xmath24 oscillates wildly for @xmath59 , but rapidly converges for @xmath60 .",
    "in other words , it is not the first few , but the first @xmath61 correlation functions that are necessary to accurately describe the void distribution . though it is comforting to know that the sum eventually converges , it is quite puzzling why convergence should require so many correlation functions .",
    "one possible explanation for the importance of higher - order moments is the following : since there exist clusters with twenty objects or more , we might expect the 20-point correlation function to be non - zero .",
    "this function describes the probability , in excess of random , that a region of space which contains 19 objects will contain a 20th .",
    "since this will almost never happen for a random sample , the 20-point function will likely be quite large , at least on small scales .",
    "hence one might expect contributions from @xmath22-point correlation functions as long as there are clusters of objects with @xmath22 members .",
    "we next describe our general methodology for obtaining void statistics from large samples of galaxies .",
    "issues concerning specific survey details , such as the proper handling of angular window functions , are treated as they arise in @xmath62 5 and 6 , where we use data from different surveys .",
    "investigating the vpf and reduced vpf requires the measurement of three quantities : @xmath20 , @xmath3 , and @xmath24 , all of which are functions of the sphere radius , @xmath18 .",
    "each of these quantities is straightforwardly determined by a counts - in - cells ( cic ) approach .",
    "one simply places large numbers ( @xmath63 ) of random spheres within the survey and counts the number of galaxies contained within each sphere .",
    "this is then repeated for many sphere radii .",
    "@xmath20 is the average number of galaxies in a sphere : @xmath64 where @xmath65 to refer to the number of spheres and @xmath4 to refer to the number of galaxies . ]",
    "is the total number of spheres placed and @xmath66 is the number of galaxies in the @xmath67th sphere .",
    "@xmath24 is the number of spheres containing zero galaxies divided by the total number of spheres , @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the number of spheres that contain zero galaxies , and @xmath3 is the variance in the number of galaxies per sphere : @xmath70 in the limit of large numbers of random points , the cic approach for determining @xmath3 is known to be mathematically equivalent to more conventional methods @xcite .",
    "we independently confirm this result by comparing our cic - measured @xmath3 to the volume - averaged correlation function obtained via the popular landy - szalay estimator @xcite .",
    "we find that the two approaches are entirely consistent . to test the sensitivity of these measured quantities to the total number of spheres used , @xmath65 , we have computed @xmath24 , @xmath20 , and @xmath3 using a sphere radius of @xmath71 @xmath45 mpc , as a function of @xmath65 ( fig .  [ fig : convergence ] ) , for mock galaxies in a simulation box of length @xmath72 @xmath45 mpc ( see below for simulation details ) .",
    "as expected , for small @xmath65 , these quantities are unstable , but for @xmath73 the quantities converge well .",
    "this rapid convergence holds for both smaller and larger void radii and is due to the fact that the simulation volume is well - sampled once the number of test volumes exhausts the number of independent configurations . to be conservative",
    ", we use @xmath74 to calculate these quantities .",
    "errors for all measured quantities are estimated by `` jackknife '' sampling .    before moving on , we should highlight the fact that all quantities used in analyses of void statistics are spherically averaged .",
    "this type of averaging effectively throws away much of the useful information contained in higher order statistics .",
    "for example , @xmath75 measures the skewness of the distribution , and will in general _ not _ be spherically symmetric . hence it is unclear whether or not spherically averaging @xmath75 is even the proper way to average @xmath75 ; these ambiguities make interpretation difficult .",
    "the @xmath3 used here and in other void analyses refers to the correlation function in _ redshift space _ ; the correlation function has not been de - projected into real space , which is the more conventional way of reporting @xmath2 .",
    "this is important because , as we will see , the real space vpf measured in mock catalogs is different from the behavior of the vpf in redshift space , and our main conclusions turn out to be valid only in redshift space .",
    "indeed , @xcite find that , at fixed void radii , @xmath24 in simulations is larger in redshift space compared to real space , with the difference increasing at larger void radii .",
    "these authors also find that redshift space void statistics closely follows one or another hierarchical model ( which model the statistics follow depends on gross cosmological models , i.e. closed v.s open and biased vs. unbiased ) , while the real space void statistics do not .",
    "one example of redshift - space effects relevant to this study is the flattening of the @xmath28 scaling coefficients in redshift space when compared to real space .",
    "this is due to the reduction of clustering strength on small scales caused by peculiar velocities ( known as the fingers - of - god effect ) .",
    "see @xcite for examples of this and other redshift space effects .",
    "finally , we require that the number density of the sample under consideration be independent of redshift , and so construct volume - limited samples for our analysis .",
    "specifically , we require that each galaxy be observable over the entire redshift range we consider .",
    "in this section we analyze void statistics in mock galaxy catalogs constructed from n - body @xmath5cdm simulations in order to help understand and interpret void statistics recovered from observational samples .",
    "first we measure the vpf and reduced vpf for dark matter particles and mock galaxies at @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "we then investigate the reduced vpf for different halo model halo occupation distributions ( hods ) and find that they are similar over a wide range of hod parameters .",
    "next , we determine the effects of redshift space distortions on the vpf and finally we compare vpfs for halo centers alone to vpfs for mock galaxies . throughout this section",
    "we use full simulation boxes at two outputs : @xmath76 ( `` @xmath1 '' ) and @xmath77 ( `` @xmath0 '' ) ; in @xmath12[s : deep ] , where we investigate the effects of survey geometry on the vpf , we extract light - cone geometries from the full simulation . except for @xmath12[s : rse ] , all analyses in this section are performed for galaxies , dark matter particles , and dark matter halos , in redshift space .",
    "the mock galaxy catalogs we use were constructed specifically for the deep2 survey . a complete description of the catalogs is given in @xcite ; we give the relevant details here .",

    "dark matter halos were identified by running a `` friends - of - friends '' group finder . galaxies",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "this `` no evolution '' hypothesis produces catalogs that are in agreement with two - point clustering measurements from deep2 at @xmath0 and the @xmath85-band luminosity function and two - point clustering of 2df galaxies at @xmath1 @xcite . for what we call the ` primary ' simulations ,",

    "this is not in conflict with the realization that at @xmath1 the galaxy distribution accurately traces the dark matter on large scales @xcite because ( 1 ) we are probing different scales and ( 2 ) these studies have only measured the linear and quadratic bias terms , whereas we are in principle sensitive to all non - linear biasing terms . the second result in fig .

    "@xcite do not find this good agreement between the thermodynamic model and dark matter particles drawn from the hubble volume simulations .",
    "we speculate that the much larger particle mass ( @xmath93 @xmath94 ) of these simulations does not afford an accurate measurement of the dark matter particle reduced vpf .",

    "a much larger up - turn has been seen in the cfa survey @xcite at similar void radii ( @xmath95 @xmath45 mpc , depending on the luminosity threshold ) .",
    "this may be due to fluctuations in the initial conditions of the simulations , as both the galaxies and dark matter at low and high redshift were derived from the same simulation .",
    "furthermore , these large scales ( corresponding to void diameters of @xmath96 @xmath45 mpc ) are approaching the limit at which a simulation with box size of @xmath97 @xmath98 mpc@xmath99 becomes unreliable due to the fact that large - scale modes , which become increasingly important on larger scales , can not be included in simulations with periodic boundary conditions .",

    "qualitatively , one would expect that placing more galaxies in halos would increase the @xmath28 values on small scales in real space .",
    "however , in redshift space , small - scale power is more smeared out because there are now more galaxies residing in massive halos with higher velocity dispersions .",

    "we calculate void statistics for our five hod models ( b1-b9 ) in real space and compare them to their redshift space analogs .",
    "the top panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : hod_rz ] displays the fractional probability increase of the vpf when comparing redshift space ( @xmath123 ) to real space ( @xmath124 ) .",
    "two competing effects are at work here : ( 1 ) peculiar velocities smear out small scale clustering , and ( 2 ) kaiser infall , due to the coherent infall of structures on larger scales @xcite , which has the effect of increasing the size of voids on large scales in redshift space",
    ".    the general trends in this figure are consistent with the underlying hod of each sample .",
    "for example , model b1 preferentially places galaxies in higher - mass halos compared to other hods , and more massive halos have larger velocity dispersions .",
    "the larger dispersions decrease the size of voids as seen in redshift space , explaining why there are fewer voids in redshift space compared to real space for the b1 model .",
    "this model also has the smallest differences on large scales .",
    "this is in part because velocity dispersions are small compared to the largest voids , but also because of kaiser infall , which increases the apparent size of voids in redshift space on large scales , is important primarily for lower mass halos that are falling into forming structures .",
    "since @xmath8 is so large in the b1 model , we expect that most halos in this model are not falling onto forming superstructures .    in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : hod_rz ] we see that the reduced vpf can in fact uniquely constrain the halo model when the analysis is performed in real space .",
    "the vpf for a set of catalogs can be entirely described by a single function @xmath125 , and hence can not be used to uniquely constrain models , if the reduced vpf for those models are all the same . yet for our five hod models , this is not the case in real space .",
    "instead , there is a definite trend of @xmath30 with @xmath8 ; samples with smaller @xmath8 are less like the negative binomial model . on larger scales ( @xmath126 @xmath45 mpc ) the hods",
    "are again indistinguishable , as is expected since hod parameters are relevant only on halo scales ( i.e. @xmath127 @xmath45 mpc ) .",
    "although it seems intuitive that the vpf should be capable of uniquely constraining the hod ( specifically @xmath8 ) , redshift - space effects make this extremely difficult in practice .",
    "we can better understand the insensitivity of the vpf to particular parameters of the hod by considering the vpf for the _ centers _ of dark matter halos ( restricted to have @xmath128 ) alone .",
    "[ fig : halo ] compares the reduced vpf for dark matter particles , dark matter halo centers , and mock galaxies .",
    "as the figure indicates , it is primarily the clustering properties of dark matter halos , not the number of galaxies within them , that generates agreement with the negative binomial model .",
    "we find the similarity in reduced vpf for halo centers and mock galaxies intuitive for two reasons .",
    "first , as most dark matter halos in our simulations with @xmath129 contain a single isolated galaxy , and galaxies in most halo models are placed first in the center of the halo , it is reasonable that the clustering of halo centers has more impact on the galaxy reduced vpf than @xmath118 .",
    "second , when more than one galaxy is placed in a halo , it is typically within @xmath130 @xmath45 kpc of the halo center , as very few halos have larger radii .",
    "hence a sphere containing a satellite galaxy will typically already include the galaxy at the halo s center .",
    "this also explains why void statistics are insensitive to the spatial distribution of galaxies within halos , as noted by @xcite .    in conclusion",
    ", the vpf does not seem to be capable of providing competitive constraints on the major parameters of the hod .",
    "this is due both to redshift space distortions washing out information on small scales and to the fact that the clustering of dark matter halos alone dominates the vpf .",
    "although one might have thought that the vpf for galaxies and halos would be uniquely sensitive to @xmath8 , it turns out that any changes in @xmath8 are likewise reflected in @xmath3 , in a way that can exactly account for changes in the vpf .",
    "we now measure void statistics in state - of - the - art redshift surveys that are mapping the three - dimensional positions of thousands of galaxies . in this section",
    "we probe void statistics when the universe was roughly half its present age ( @xmath0 ) . in the following section we focus on voids in the local universe ( @xmath1 ) .",

    "below , we define `` red '' and `` blue '' galaxies according to whether @xmath143 or @xmath144 ; this roughly corresponds to the saddle point of the color bimodality observed in deep2 data @xcite .",
    "the current study uses @xmath145 redshifts with @xmath146 in three fields covering @xmath147 deg@xmath134 .",
    "the three fields we use correspond to the deep2 pointings 21 , part of 22 , 31 , 32 , 33 , 41 , and 42 , as defined in @xcite .",
    "an important aspect in analysis of any large - scale galaxy survey is the proper handling of selection effects that may vary as a function of galaxy property , such as color and luminosity .",
    "deep2 is an @xmath18-band limited survey , which corresponds to restframe uv at @xmath148 , and results in fewer red galaxies being targeted at higher redshift compared to blue galaxies @xcite . due to this selection effect and the generally lower sampling density beyond @xmath0 , we limit our analysis in this study to @xmath149 .",
    "each deep2 field is much longer in the redshift direction than on the sky ; the @xmath150 deg@xmath134 fields used for this work span @xmath151 @xmath45 mpc in transverse comoving extent , while the range @xmath152 corresponds to @xmath153 @xmath45 mpc comoving in the redshift direction .",
    "the number of possible independent spheres contained within the survey , as indicated by @xmath154 , varies from @xmath155 for @xmath156 @xmath45 mpc spheres to @xmath157 for @xmath71 @xmath45 mpc spheres .",
    "one might be concerned that the survey geometry would skew void statistics when probing voids with diameters comparable to the short dimension of the survey .",
    "we have tested this effect by comparing the vpfs from a full mock galaxy simulation box at @xmath0 , constructed from the ` primary ' simulation ( see @xmath12[s : sims ] ) , to mock galaxy catalogs with a `` lightcone '' geometry similar to deep2 .",
    "the lightcone geometry is constructed by stacking together several simulation box outputs and slicing through them diagonally , so as not to pick up the same structures at different times .",
    "we find that , even at the largest radii tested , the vpf in the mock lightcone and larger simulation box agree to within @xmath158 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mock_ccm ] ) . of course , due to the decrease in the number of independent volume elements at large void radii , cosmic variance increases , and hence the scatter ( computed across three mock light cones ) increases .",
    "we conclude that the geometry of the deep2 survey allows us to accurately probe voids to radii of at least 7 @xmath45 mpc comoving .",
    "another selection effect is the survey completeness .",
    "the deep2 survey spectroscopically targets @xmath15960% of objects that pass the apparent magnitude and color cuts mentioned above . of those targeted objects , we are able to secure redshifts for @xmath160% .",
    "follow - up observations have shown that @xmath161% of the targets are objects at @xmath162 ( c. steidel , private communication ) .",
    "we therefore have successful redshifts for @xmath163% of all galaxies at @xmath164 in the surveyed fields with apparent magnitude of @xmath165 .",
    "this sampling rate is effectively scaled out when we dilute the mock galaxy catalogs to compare to the deep2 data .",
    "further complications arise because the sampling rate is non - uniform due to the necessities of slitmask design .",
    "spectra of objects are not allowed to overlap on the ccd , such that objects that lie near each other in the direction on the sky that maps to the wavelength direction on the ccd can not be simultaneously observed ; this results in modest ( @xmath166% ) under - sampling in regions with the highest density of targets on the plane of the sky ( each point on the sky is covered by multiple deep2 slitmasks to ameliorate this effect ) .",
    "we model this effect by applying the actual deep2 maskmaking algorithm to the mock galaxy catalogs and then computing the vpf .",
    "we find that the impact of the target selection algorithm on the vpf is negligible to within @xmath158 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : mock_ccm ] ) .",
    "one would have expected this , as the effect is most relevant on small scales and in overdense regions .",
    "there are also selection effects due to bright stars and other regions that were not observed .",
    "these result in inhomogeneities on much larger scales ( @xmath167 mpc ) that could potentially be more relevant for void studies . to take account of these effects for the deep2 sample ,",
    "we generate an angular window function that has , for each right ascension and declination , the completeness at that point determined from the bad - pixel masks used in making our photometric catalogs and the observed redshift success for slitmasks covering that point .",
    "this window function therefore masks unobservable regions such as areas around bright stars ( they are given a completeness of @xmath168 ) .",
    "we then convolve this window function with a circular kernel proportional to the path length through a sphere of radius @xmath18 projected on the sky ( i.e. , @xmath169 , where @xmath170 is the projected radius of the sphere in arcseconds , and @xmath171 and @xmath172 are the separations on the sky from the center of the kernel in the right - ascension and declination directions , respectively ) .",
    "this convolution has a simple physical consequence : we treat a test sphere completely inside the survey volume at a region of @xmath101% completeness as equivalent to a sphere only @xmath101% in the survey volume at a region of @xmath173% completeness . our final product is a window function that contains , at each point , the projected completeness averaged over a sphere of a given radius , weighting by the path length through the sphere .",
    "we then throw down random spheres only at points above a minimum convolved completeness .",
    "this allows us to robustly avoid regions of bright stars , regions of low completeness ( due , for example , to bad weather during observations ) and the edges of the survey . for deep2",
    ", we set the completeness threshold at @xmath174% so that the allowable completeness range varies over the survey by @xmath166% .",
    "it is more important for our purposes to be _ uniformly _ complete than highly complete , as an overall dilution of the sample does not effect the reduced vpf .",
    "we test the accuracy of this method by dividing the measured average number of galaxies in a sphere of radius @xmath18 , @xmath20 , by the sphere volume for each radius .",
    "we find that this inferred number density is constant with sphere radius , providing good evidence that the larger spheres do not tend to lay farther outside the survey geometry than smaller spheres .",
    "finally , we have spot - checked by eye the locations of the largest voids to ensure that they fall within the survey geometry ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : deep2_show ] ) .",
    "we investigate the vpf and reduced vpf for deep2 galaxies in three ways .",
    "first we consider an `` overall '' sample consisting of all galaxies with @xmath89 and @xmath164 .",
    "then we compute the vpf as a function of galaxy color and of luminosity , using volume - limited samples .",
    "errors for all deep2 measurements were derived from jackknife sampling using subvolumes of the three widely separated deep2 fields .",
    "we find excellent agreement between the overall deep2 sample vpf and the mock galaxy catalog vpf ( fig .",
    "[ fig : deep2_overall+colors ] , top panel ) .",
    "the mock catalogs were randomly diluted to have the same number density ( @xmath175 @xmath87mpc@xmath88 ) as the deep2 overall sample .",
    "the dashed line is a prediction of the negative binomial model .",
    "we show the reduced vpf , plotted as differences from the negative binomial prediction , for the overall sample in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : deep2_nb ] , top panel .",
    "the good agreement between the data and the model implies that the vpf can be described entirely by @xmath20 and @xmath3 .",
    "the largest deviations on large scales seen here and below are of low statistical significance ; the data are highly covariant from bin to bin , and hence our errors are underestimates of the true error .",
    "the excellent agreement between the overall sample and mock galaxy vpf reflects the fact that the mock galaxy catalogs were constructed to match the observed @xmath3 in the deep2 data .",
    "stated differently , since these samples have the same number density ( by construction ) , the fact that they have similar vpfs implies that they will have similar @xmath3 values , and vice versa .",
    "we next divide the deep2 sample into galaxies with @xmath144 or @xmath176 , roughly matching the observed saddle point in the color bi - modality .",
    "we find that samples of red galaxies have more and/or larger voids than samples of blue galaxies ( fig .",
    "[ fig : deep2_overall+colors ] , bottom panel ; both samples were randomly diluted to @xmath177 @xmath87mpc@xmath88 ) .",
    "this dilution is critical ; without it , the differences between the red and blue galaxy vpf would be dominated by differences in the observed number density of red versus blue galaxies .",
    "it would be very difficult to separate the effects of number density from clustering strength on the number and size of voids if we simply compared the vpfs of undiluted samples .    as with the overall sample , we find that the reduced vpf of both the blue and red galaxy populations follows the negative binomial model within the errors ( fig .  [",
    "fig : deep2_nb ] , top panel ) .",
    "again , this implies that the differences between the vpfs for blue and red galaxies ( fig .",
    "[ fig : deep2_overall+colors ] , bottom panel ) are solely due to differences in their two - point correlation functions .",
    "the similarity in reduced vpfs is somewhat surprising .",
    "we know that blue and red galaxies are biased differently relative to the dark matter ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , and that the @xmath28 values are dependent on the bias .",
    "we might have expected the reduced vpfs , which according to eqn .",
    "[ eqn : chi ] should depend on the @xmath28 values , to be different for these two populations .",
    "the halo model affords a more direct interpretation of these results .",
    "we have seen in @xmath12  [ s : constrain ] that the reduced vpf is insensitive to parameters of the hod . from studies of galaxy correlations at @xmath1",
    ", it is becoming apparent that different populations of galaxies can have very different hods .",
    "hence the result that red and blue galaxies have similar reduced vpfs is consistent with our tests using mock catalogs ; very different hods will still produce the same reduced vpf .",
    "we also investigate the deep2 vpf dividing the sample into three luminosity bins : @xmath178 , @xmath179 , and @xmath180 .",
    "we take a slightly different approach for this analysis .",
    "since the number densities of the three luminosity subsamples vary by roughly a factor of four , the dilution required for a direct comparison of vpfs can discard a great deal of information and unnecessarily increases poisson errors .",
    "for this reason , we begin by analyzing the reduced vpf for each luminosity sample ( fig .  [",
    "fig : deep2_nb ] , bottom panel ) , again finding good agreement with the negative binomial model . using this model , we can then use eqn .  [",
    "eqn : nbvpf ] to predict the vpf at any radius based solely on our knowledge of @xmath20 and @xmath3 at that radius . in fig .",
    "[ fig : deep2_mag ] we plot the vpf for each of the three magnitude bins ( without diluting the number density ) and also show the predictions based on the negative binomial model ; again , the agreement is within the errors .",
    "knowledge of the form of the reduced vpf allows us to separate the effects of number density from clustering on the vpf .",
    "we note that the three magnitude bins cover slightly different redshift intervals . while the faintest bin ( @xmath181 ) spans @xmath182 , the brightest bin ( @xmath183 ) spans @xmath184 .",
    "each redshift interval is chosen such that the sample being considered should have a roughly constant number density as a function of redshift .",
    "this ensures that there is no artificial redshift dependence in the void distribution ; i.e. , the samples are volume limited .",
    "the less luminous galaxies have a constant number density only over a limited redshift range because they have @xmath185 at higher redshifts .",
    "the reduced vpf of all populations of galaxies at @xmath0 is well fit by the negative binomial model .",
    "hence the vpf , a statistic that in principle relies on the infinite hierarchy of correlation functions , can in fact be accurately described solely by the number density and the volume - averaged two - point correlation function of the sample .",
    "we conclude that , at @xmath0 , the vpf provides no constraints on either the halo model or on cosmological parameters that can not be gleaned from studies of correlation statistics .",

    "the lrg sample we study here contains @xmath206 galaxies and spans the redshift range @xmath207 and luminosity range @xmath208 with @xmath209 ( note that this is the only case where we use sdss absolute magnitudes ) .",
    "since the sdss is a low - redshift survey , the angular size of a test void sphere of the same comoving radius varies enormously over the redshift range @xmath210 . paralleling our analysis of the deep2 sample",
    ", we account for geometry and completeness effects in the following way .",
    "we generate an angular window function for the sdss with the aid of _ mangle _ @xcite over a dense grid in right ascension and declination ; the resulting resolution is @xmath211 degrees in right ascension and declination .",
    "completeness values of either 0 or 1 were assigned to each right point of this grid depending on the spectroscopic coverage and locations of bright stars ( as sdss spectroscopy is highly uniform in depth ) .",
    "we then convolve this window function with a kernel that represents the depth through the test void projected on the sky ( see @xmath12  [ sec : deep_compl ] for details ) and only place random spheres in regions above a minimum convolved completeness .",
    "this allows us to avoid placing test spheres in poorly - sampled regions .",
    "we set this threshold at @xmath212% , so that the completeness within spheres placed down varies over the survey by @xmath166% .",
    "the net result of the strong scaling of angular size with redshift is that larger - volume test spheres can not be placed in the lowest redshift bins because they would span a region of the sky comparable to the entire survey .",
    "hence at larger void radii we are restricted to higher redshifts .",
    "this does not cause a detrimental bias , however , because we only consider galaxies over a redshift range such that their number density is approximately constant , i.e. , volume - limited samples .",
    "hence a bias towards slightly higher redshifts ( @xmath213 ) for larger voids will not skew our statistics , assuming that there is not strong void statistic evolution from @xmath1 to @xmath213 .",
    "indeed no significant evolution has been detected in the vpf out to @xmath214 @xcite .",
    "there is one final effect in the sdss data that , if not properly treated , could significantly bias our results .",
    "there is a massive structure in @xmath201 at @xmath215 dubbed the `` sloan great wall '' @xcite , which will strongly affect any clustering measurements .",
    "this structure has been removed in the correlation function studies of @xcite , and we do the same here by defining our samples to avoid @xmath216 in the @xmath201 sample .",
    "the structure extends across the entire angular extent of @xmath201 ; if included it would cause gross underestimates of the cosmic error in any large - scale structure measurement .",
    "based on many realizations of large cosmological simulations with gaussian initial conditions , it is expected that a structure of this size occurs in a volume the size of the sdss approximately @xmath217% of the time @xcite . with the full sdss dataset",
    ", it should be possible to accurately account for this enormous structure in the error budget without relying on simulations .    in order to accurately measure quantities via our counts - in - cells approach ,",
    "it is important that the number of randomly placed test spheres exhausts the number of independent volumes in the survey .",
    "the second data release of the sdss over the interval @xmath218 spans a volume of @xmath219 @xmath98 mpc@xmath99 .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath220 independent volumes for @xmath156 @xmath45 mpc spheres and @xmath157 for @xmath221 @xmath45 mpc spheres , a factor of @xmath217 more than in the deep2 survey .",
    "the number of spheres we use always exceeds the number of independent volumes .",
    "we now present void statistics in the local universe using the sdss dataset . as in our analysis of deep2 data ,",
    "we investigate void statistics for three sets of sdss samples : an `` overall '' sample with @xmath89 and @xmath222 , two subsamples split according to @xmath204 color ( at @xmath205 ) , and three subsamples differing in luminosity . in this section , as before , we plot reduced vpfs as differences from the negative binomial model in order to clearly show small deviations . as for the deep2 luminosity subsamples , all comparisons made in this section",
    "are made without requiring that samples have similar number densities , and by using the negative binomial model to predict the vpf ( via eqn .",
    "[ eqn : nbvpf ] ) .",
    "errors for all quantities were derived from jackknife subsamples .",
    "the reduced vpfs for the overall , red , and blue samples ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sdss_rvpf ] , top panel ) are all well described by the negative binomial model . as in the previous sections",
    ", we can use this measured agreement to predict the vpf at any radius based solely on @xmath20 and @xmath3 for that radius , ( e.g. as estimated from counts - in - cells ) , for each sample .",
    "[ fig : sdss_vpf ] ( top panel ) plots the vpf for these samples and compares them to the predictions from the negative binomial model ( lines ) .",
    "the trend that the red galaxy sample has more and/or larger voids than the blue sample is due to the fact that it is both more strongly clustered and lower in number density than our sample of blue galaxies . that the measured data agree with the negative binomial model within errors implies that , just as at @xmath0 , the vpf can not be used to uniquely constrain the halo model or cosmological parameters . as with the overall deep2 vpf",
    ", the blue sdss data do not agree within @xmath158 errors on the largest scales ; this is likely insignificant , as the data are highly covariant , and hence our errors are underestimates of the true error .",
    "next , we compare void statistics for samples of sdss galaxies as a function of luminosity . the reduced vpf for galaxies in all luminosity bins we consider ( @xmath183 , @xmath223 , and @xmath181 ) , is in good agreement with the negative binomial model ( fig .  [ fig : sdss_rvpf ] , bottom panel ) .",
    "we again make this agreement explicit by computing the vpfs for these samples and comparing to that predicted by assuming the negative binomial model from the values of @xmath20 and @xmath3 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sdss_vpf ] , bottom panel ) .",
    "since these samples are volume limited , each luminosity sample spans a slightly different redshift range , with the brightest spanning the largest range ( @xmath224 ) ( since bright galaxies can be detected at greatest distances ) and the faintest spanning the smallest range ( @xmath225 ) .",
    "finally , we compute the vpf for the lrg population , defined to be bright ( @xmath208 ) and red ( @xmath209 ) , spanning the redshift range @xmath207 . their low number density ( @xmath226 @xmath87 mpc@xmath88 ) and large redshift range allow for a measurement of the vpf out to unprecedented scales ( r@xmath227 @xmath45 mpc ) .",
    "[ fig : sdss_lrg ] shows that the lrg population is well described by the negative binomial model out to the largest void radii tested .",
    "unlike our analysis of other sdss data , we plot the vpf separately for the two regions used in this study ( denoted @xmath197 and @xmath201 ) .",
    "the difference between the two regions reflects the impact of cosmic variance on void statistics .",
    "the reduced vpfs of all galaxy populations explored at @xmath1 are in good agreement with the negative binomial model .",
    "it is quite surprising that this agreement , which provides a simple mapping from @xmath20 and @xmath3 to @xmath24 , is equally valid from @xmath0 to @xmath1 .",
    "what this tells us is that the evolution in the vpf for a given population from @xmath0 to @xmath1 must proceed in lockstep with evolution in the number density and two - point correlation function of that population .",
    "finally , it is encouraging that these conclusions at @xmath1 agree with @xcite , who measure void statistics for the low - redshift 2df survey , and find good agreement between the galaxy reduced vpf and the negative binomial model for a range of galaxy luminosities .",
    "we have presented measurements of the void probability function ( vpf ) and reduced vpf for galaxies as a function of color and luminosity at @xmath0 using deep2 data and at @xmath1 with sdss data .",
    "we find that all samples are well described by the negative binomial model .",
    "this agreement implies that the vpf for a given sample is determined entirely by the sample number density and volume - averaged two - point correlation function , @xmath3 .",
    "in particular , evolution of the vpf for a population of galaxies from @xmath0 to @xmath1 is governed by the evolution in @xmath3 and @xmath20 for that population .",
    "we have furthermore shown , using mock catalogs , that this simple relation between the vpf and @xmath3 holds for a wide range of halo models in redshift space , but breaks down in real space .",
    "we now discuss the relevance and implications of these findings .",
    "the vpf we measure at @xmath0 is in good agreement with the vpf measured in mock galaxy catalogs created from @xmath5cdm simulations .",
    "although this is encouraging , our result that the two - point correlation function and number density determine the vpf implies that this agreement found between data and simulations is simply a consequence of the fact that the simulations were constructed to match the number density and two - point correlation function of deep2 galaxies",
    ". stated differently , the vpf currently can not provide new constraints either on cosmological parameters or on the method in which galaxies are placed into dark matter n - body simulations .",
    "previous void studies have interpreted the vpf according to its mathematical expansion as an infinite sum of higher - order correlation functions , using the hierarchical _ ansatz _ to relate the higher - order functions to lower - order functions .",
    "these studies then attempt to use the reduced vpf to test the validity of this _",
    "ansatz_. strictly speaking , however , finding that the vpf for various populations of galaxies can be characterized entirely by @xmath20 and @xmath3 does _ not _ provide evidence for the validity of this _",
    "ansatz_. in fact , the interpretation of the vpf in terms of higher - order correlation functions implies that the reduced vpf depends only on the scaling coefficients ( @xmath228 ) , which suggests that populations with different biases ( and therefore different scalings between the three - point and two - point functions ) should actually not have the same reduced vpf .",
    "we find just the opposite in the data , namely that populations with different biases have the same reduced vpf .",
    "the interpretation of the vpf as a sum of correlation functions affords little insight into these results . despite this , the interpretation predicts that the reduced vpf of a sample should be independent of that samples number density , and this is indeed observed .",
    "the halo model provides a more tractable theoretical framework .",
    "we have shown that the reduced vpf of mock galaxies is quite insensitive to particular parameters of the hod when voids are measured in redshift space . using measurements of @xmath2 to constrain the halo model",
    ", it appears that blue and red galaxies have very different hods @xcite .",
    "the samples we investigate here hence likely have a range of hods .",
    "yet , based on the result that different hods generate the same reduced vpf , it is not surprising that different samples have the same reduced vpf .",
    "furthermore , an analysis of the dark matter _ halo _ reduced vpf has led us to conclude that it is the redshift - space distribution of halos themselves that is primarily responsible for the agreement between the measured reduced vpf and the negative binomial model .",
    "the reduced vpf changes very little when one populates dark matter halos with galaxies .",
    "it is only surprising that the minimum halo mass , @xmath8 , has very little effect on the reduced vpf as well .",
    "this insensitivity to @xmath8 implies that the changes in @xmath3 caused by changes in @xmath8 are enough to completely account for the changes in the vpf .",
    "we would like to stress that the strict dependence of the vpf on @xmath33 does not rely on any theoretical interpretation , including the hierarchical _ ansatz _ , and , in particular , does not depend on the reduced vpf following the negative binomial model .",
    "our result that all galaxy populations studied here have consistent reduced vpfs immediately implies that the vpf can be entirely described by @xmath33 .",
    "this , in turn , implies that the vpf is currently incapable of uniquely providing constraints on either cosmological parameters or particular aspects of the halo model , as any useful information provided by the vpf is likewise provided by two - point correlation function analyses ; the vpf is of little use in understanding the large scale structure of the universe .",
