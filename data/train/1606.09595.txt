    "frustrated magnetic materials continue to provide a fruitful interaction between experiment and theory [ 1 ]",
    ". in particular , large quantum fluctuations in systems with low spin and low dimensionality , coupled with frustration , can lead to novel states [ 2 ] , quite different from the usual nel state of classical antiferromagnetism .",
    "magnetic frustration can arise from the lattice structure itself , as in triangular and kagome systems , or from the presence of additional further- neighbor interactions which favor a different type of order from that which would arise from nearest - neighbor interactions alone .",
    "one such scenario is the inclusion of 2nd - neighbor interactions along one axial direction , in square or cubic lattices , referred to as the annnh ( axial next - nearest- neighbor heisenberg ) model [ 3 - 5 ] .    the annnh model is the obvious quantum extension of the ising version , the annni model , which was much studied primarily in connection with modulated phases in both magnetic and alloy systems [ 6,7 ] .",
    "the annni model was found to have an extremely rich finite temperature phase diagram , in both 2 and 3 dimensions , with modulated phases having both constant and continuously varying wavevectors .",
    "our motivation for studying the quantum annnh model is twofold .",
    "firstly , there are now a number of materials where commensurate - incommensurate transitions and modulated spiral and collinear phases have been recently observed to arise [ 8 - 11 ] .",
    "for example , in the materials lu@xmath0sr@xmath1mnsi , cycloidal antiferromagnetic order is argued to arise from an axial next - neighbor interaction [ 9 ] . in the material bimn@xmath2po@xmath3 also a number of commensurate and incommensurate phases are observed , driven by the spatial anisotropy of the interactions in a 3-dimensional spin system [ 10 ] .",
    "on the other hand , the material fese shows a ` pair - checkerboard ' collinear magnetic order [ 11 ] .",
    "it would be intersting to establish if such modulated collinear phases also arise in annnh models , like in their ising counterpart .",
    "secondly , on general grounds one expects that the presence of further neighbor interactions will favour spiral phases , in which the average moment varies sinusoidally with a wavevector along the frustration axis . while it is easy to demonstrate this for classical vector spins , we are not aware of any rigorous demonstration of this in the extreme quantum case s=1/2 . it is well known that quantum fluctuations can stabilize collinear phases [ 16 ] .",
    "thus , it is interesting to ask if such modulated collinear phases are stabilized in these systems due to quantum fluctuations .",
    "we find that such spiral phases do indeed arise in the quantum models . in two - dimensions ,",
    "long - range order only arises at zero temperature , but in 3-dimensional systems , such phases extend to finite temperatures , and their is a lifhitz point where neel , spiral and paramagnetic phases meet [ 15 ] .",
    "we find that , despite strong quantum fluctuations , the annnh model does not support modulated collinear phases . instead , the parameter region for the stability of the collinear neel phase is substantially enhanced by quantum fluctuations .",
    "we consider a heisenberg model with hamiltonian    @xmath4    where the sums are over nearest - neighbor bonds perpendicular to the modulation axis , nearest - neighbor bonds along the modulation axis , and next- nearest pairs along the modulation axis , with coupling constants @xmath5 respectively .",
    "this is shown in fig . 1 for the 2-dimensional ( 2d ) case",
    ". the @xmath6 are quantum spin s=1/2 operators . in the present work",
    "we consider all interactions to be antiferromagnetic ( @xmath7 ) , although other cases could be treated in a similar way .",
    "the phase diagram for classical spins is well known , but we repeat the argument here for completeness . the energy of a classical spiral ground state is    @xmath8    where q is the angle between neighboring spins in the modulation direction and",
    "n=1(2 ) for the square(simple cubic ) lattice .",
    "minimization gives    @xmath9    thus the small @xmath10 nel phase becomes an incommensurate spiral with wavevector q at the transition point @xmath11 .",
    "it can also be seen that in the large @xmath10 limit , where @xmath12 , a collinear phase in which each column has two spins up followed by two spins down , with neighboring columns ordered antiferromagnetically , will become degenerate with the spiral .",
    "such a phase has been termed [ 9 ] pair - checkerboard , but we will refer to it as a 2 + 2 phase. such a phase occurs in the annni model for large frustration and , while in the classical vector case ( eqn.3 ) it only occurs as a limiting case , its stabilty in the quantum case has not been investigated previously , to our knowledge .",
    "a number of studies of the quantum annnh model were reported in the 1980 s [ 3 - 5 ] , using bosonic hamiltonians obtained via standard holstein- primakoff or dyson - maleev transformations .",
    "these studies , which focussed only on the case of ferromagnetic @xmath13 , encountered difficulties in treating quantum corrections about the classical states in a consistent way . in any case , these analytic approaches are essentially large s theories , and their reliability for s=1/2 is uncertain .",
    "we are not aware of any previous work on this model with antiferromagnetic first- neighbor interactions .",
    "our aim in the present work is to explore the physics of this model for spin 1/2 , using series expansion methods [ 12,13 ] .",
    "this approach has been amply demonstrated to give reliable results for quantum spin models , and is a method of choice for models with strong frustration , where quantum monte carlo methods are defeated by the infamous minus sign problem . in the following sections we derive and analyse series for the ground state energy and magnetization for both the 2d and 3d models . in section 4",
    "we compute series at high t for spin - spin correlations and for the structure factor s(q ) .",
    "this analysis clearly shows that the large @xmath10 phase is an incommensurate spiral . following the 2d work , in section 4 we treat the 3d model , and present results at both t=0 and high t. clear differences from the 2d case",
    "are demonstated .",
    "finally , in section 5 , we summarize our results and suggest possible extensions of this work .",
    "we use the linked - cluster method [ 12,13 ] to obtain series for the ground state energy and magnetization . in this approach ,",
    "series are computed for a sequence of finite connected clusters , and these are combined to obtain series in the thermodynamic limit of a bulk lattice . for each finite cluster ,",
    "the hamiltonian is decomposed in the usual perturbative form @xmath14 , where @xmath15 describes a simple system with known ground state and v is treated perturbatively to high order . in the present work we use ising expansions",
    "in which @xmath15 consists of the diagonal @xmath16 terms , and v consists of the transverse quantum fluctuations .",
    "thus the su(2 ) symmetry is broken by the choice of @xmath15 , which reflects the order in the chosen phase , but is restored in the limit @xmath17 .",
    "provided there is no singularity for @xmath18 the true ground state will be reached in this limit .",
    "we refer the readers to more detailed expositions [ 12,13 ] for further details of the method .      to derive series to 8th order we need to consider clusters of up to 8 sites , having 3 bond types .",
    "there are a total of 10,644 distinct such clusters for the 2d case .",
    "the ground state energy and magnetization are expressed in the form    @xmath19    @xmath20    with the coefficients @xmath21 computed to 12 figure accuracy .",
    "the series are analysed by standard pad approximant methods to yield estimates of @xmath22 and @xmath23 for any values of the exchange constants @xmath24 . in the present work",
    "we choose @xmath25 and plot quantities versus the frustration parameter @xmath26 .",
    "the 2 + 2 phase has a 4-sublattice structure , and it is necessary to distinguish two types of @xmath27 bond , between like and unlike spins .",
    "this results in a total of 22,613 clusters with 4 bond types , to 8th order .",
    "the derivation and analysis of the series then proceeds in the same way as above .      to carry out an ising expansion for a non - collinear ordered phase we transform to a local basis , in which each spin is directed along its local z - axis",
    "this results in a hamiltonian of the form    @xmath28    with    @xmath29    and    @xmath30 \\nonumber \\\\    &    &   -{1\\over 4}j_2 \\sum_{<ij>}^{(2 ) } [ ( 1 - cos{2\\theta } ) ( s_i^+ s_j^+   + s_i^- s_j^- ) \\nonumber \\\\    &    &   -(1+cos{2\\theta } ) ( s_i^+ s_j^- + s_i^- s_j^+ ) \\nonumber \\\\    &    &   -2sin{2\\theta}(s_i^+ s_j^z + s_i^ -s_j^z - s_i^z s_j^+ - s_i^z s_j^-)]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where the superscripts 0,1,2 refer to the 3 bond types , and @xmath31 is the angle between successive spins in columns ( actually the angle is @xmath32 in the original picture , before a rotation of axes ) .",
    "this hamiltonian contains the angle @xmath31 as a parameter , and this is not known a - priori .",
    "thus we choose a range of values , plot the energy as a function of @xmath31 , and choose the correct @xmath31 from the minimum . in practice ,",
    "the minimum is quite shallow and it is difficult to choose @xmath31 with high precision .",
    "however , this doed not seriously affect the energy estimates .",
    "figure 3 shows the ground state energy and magnetization versus @xmath26 for the 2d annnh model , for the nel , spiral and 2 + 2 phases , obtained from our series .",
    "the series have been analysed by standard pad approximant techniques , using both the direct series and the logarithmic derivative .",
    "the latter are found to give slightly more stable results , but the two approaches are broadly consistent . where error bars are shown in the figues , they represent confidence limits based on the spread of different approximants .    we first comment on the ground state energy .",
    "these series are very regular , and any uncertainty is estimated to be no larger than the plotted points . the nel and spiral series appear to meet smoothly at a point near @xmath33 , well above the classical transition point @xmath34 .",
    "the series become a little erratic in the immediate vicinity of this value , and the transition appears continuous . in fig .",
    "3a we also plot the energy of the 2 + 2 phase .",
    "this clearly lies at higher energy , and is thus not a stable phase .",
    "it seems that , as @xmath35 , the energies of the spiral and 2 + 2 phases become asymptotically equal , as for the classical case .",
    "the magnetization series are less regular , and the error bars become quite large near the transition point .",
    "the most interesting feature is that both the nel and spiral phase magnetizations appear to be dropping to zero at the transition , between 0.45 and 0.5 .",
    "thus quantum fluctuations in this 2d model are large enough to destroy the long- range order at this point .",
    "indeed we can not exclude the possibility of a ( very ) narrow non - magnetic phase .",
    "we also show the magnetization for the 2 + 2 phase , but , since this phase has higher energy , it is of little significance .     for the 2d annnh model , title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]   for the 2d annnh model , title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]",
    "high temperature series [ 12 ] provide a complementary approach for studying the nature of magnetic orders . although the mermin - wagner theorem precludes any finite temperature ordered phase in the 2d model , it is expected that , as the temperature is lowered , the correlations that build up will reflect the nature of the order which occurs at t=0 .",
    "high t expansions for a correlator @xmath36 can be developed as    @xmath37    where @xmath38 , and @xmath39 is the partition function , which is itself expanded as a series in @xmath40 .",
    "we note that , since we are in a paramagnetic phase , the correlations have full rotational symmetry and it suffices to compute the ( zz ) correlators .    from these",
    "we compute a high t series , in powers of @xmath40 , for the static structure factor    @xmath41    which should develop a peak at whatever @xmath42 value reflects the t = 0 order .    to compute the structure factor series to 8th order , for general @xmath43 ,",
    "would require correlator series for all cluster space - types with 8 or fewer bonds , a total of over 600,000 distinct clusters .",
    "however , for @xmath43 in the modulation direction , this number can be reduced considerably , by effectively calculating correlator series between horizontal rows of spins .",
    "this requires only 76712 clusters .",
    "the @xmath44 series converge rapidly at high t ( small @xmath40 ) and can be evaluated using pad approximants down to about @xmath45 .",
    "we have carried out such an analysis for @xmath46 for various @xmath10 and results are shown in fig .",
    "4 , for the temperature @xmath47 . below",
    "this @xmath48 the series become too erratic .",
    "we see that for @xmath49 there is a rather sharp peak at @xmath50 , corresponding to an angle of 76 degrees . as @xmath10",
    "is decreased , the peak broadens and moves to larger @xmath51 ( smaller angles ) .",
    "note that @xmath52 would correspond to a modulation wavelength of a lattice spacings , as for the 2 + 2 structure , whereas @xmath53 corresponds to the neel phase .",
    "the peak positions do not change significantly with temperature .",
    "with q in units of @xmath54 , as calculated from high t series expansions ]",
    "we have used the same approach to study the annnh model on the simple- cubic lattice .",
    "the ground state energy and magnetization are shown in figure 5 .",
    "the following points can be noted : 1 .",
    "the energy series are very regular , and the curves meet smoothly at @xmath55 .",
    "the nel series can be accurately continued well beyond this point , as shown .",
    "we also note the maximum in the spiral phase energy near 0.4 , which then drops again to meet the nel curve smoothly .",
    "this feature occurs in the classical case , and is also apparent , though less clearly , in the 2d case ( fig.3 ) .",
    "the /nel / spiral crossover point , at @xmath56 , is again well above the classical value 0.25 , but the difference is less than in the 2d case , reflecting the smaller quantum fluctuations in higher dimension .",
    "the magnetization series are less regular , and this is reflected in the error bars , although the size of the uncertainty is exaggerated by the scale chosen for the figure .",
    "we note that the magnetization decreases on approaching the crossover point from either side , but only by approx .",
    "10zero , again showing that quantum fluctuations are less dominant .    as in the 2d case",
    ", we have also derived high t series for the structure factor @xmath57 . there is , however , one important difference . in 3d",
    "the system will retain long - range magnetic order at finite temperature , up to some critical temperature @xmath58 . on approaching @xmath58 from above , the structure factor @xmath57 at the appropriate wavevector",
    "is expected to diverge in the thermodynamic limit , reflecting the development of long- range correlations at the critical temperature .",
    "thus we may expect to be able to estimate the locus of this critical line from our series .",
    "some results are shown in figure 6 .     versus @xmath51 at a temperature t=1.2 , for several values of @xmath10 , for the 3d annnh model ;",
    "( b ) structure factor at the critical wavevector versus temperature , for several values of @xmath10.,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]   versus @xmath51 at a temperature t=1.2 , for several values of @xmath10 , for the 3d annnh model ; ( b ) structure factor at the critical wavevector versus temperature , for several values of @xmath10.,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]    figure 6(a ) shows @xmath57 versus @xmath51 for various @xmath10 . for @xmath59",
    "the maximum is at @xmath60 , corresponding to nel order . for larger @xmath10",
    "the peak moves continuously to smaller @xmath51 : @xmath61 for @xmath62 , @xmath63 for @xmath64 , @xmath65 for @xmath66 .",
    "this is indicative of an incommensurate spiral phase .",
    "the @xmath51 values are consistent with those found to give the lowest ground - state energy in the t=0 spiral phase .",
    "the point where the peak begins to move away from @xmath67 is close to @xmath68 .",
    "we have also analysed the @xmath57 series to estimate the values of the critical temperature as a function of @xmath10 . while the 8th order series are too short to provide estimated of high precision , pde approximants to the logarithmic derivative series do show a fairly consistent pole on the positive real axis , corresponding to a line of critical points .    in figure 6(b ) we plot the value of @xmath69 , at the critical wavevector @xmath70 , versus reduced temperature @xmath71 .",
    "a strong divergence is clearly seen .",
    "our best estimates for the critical temperatures are : 1.09 ( @xmath72 ) , 0.82 ( @xmath68 ) , 0.89 ( @xmath64 ) . for @xmath73 , the isotropic simple - cubic nearest - neighbor model ,",
    "a more precise estimate is available from longer series [ 14 ] .",
    "there are , as far as we know , no previous estimates of the critical line for the 3d annnh model .",
    "the critical temperature is lowest near @xmath74 , which is also where the peak in @xmath57 moves away from @xmath67 .",
    "this is a lifshitz point [ 15 ] , where paramagnetic , nel ordered and spiral phases meet and coexist .",
    "we have used a combination of perturbation series at t=0 and high t expansions to investigate the nature of magnetic order , and the magnetic phase diagram in the quantum spin s=1/2 annnh model , in both 2 and 3 dimensions .",
    "while it is easy to show , for classical vector spins , that an incommensurate spiral phase exists for large frustration @xmath10 , previous analytic studies for quantum spins have encountered difficulties .",
    "our study confirms that the classical picture remains qualitatively correct . however , quantum fluctuations shift the crossover point between nel and spiral phases substantially .    for the 2d model",
    "we find that the magnetizations in both nel and spiral ground states appear to tend continuously to zero at the crossover point .",
    "this was not expected , and is reminiscent of the behaviour in the @xmath75 model , where there is an intermediate non - magnetic phase .",
    "we see no evidence for such a phase here , although we can not exclude the possibility of a very narrow phase of this kind . in the 3d model , the magnetizations clearly cross over at a finite value .",
    "in the 3d model , the magnetic phases extend to finite temperature , and we have estimated the position of the critical line , and of the lifshitz point , where paramagnetic , nel and spiral phases coexist .    in the large @xmath10 limit a collinear phase , the 2 + 2 phase , becomes asymptotically degenerate with the @xmath76 spiral , both having a modulation wavelength of 4 lattice spacings .",
    "such a phase , termed pair- checkerboard , was claimed to exist in the fese monolayer system [ 11 ] .",
    "we find that , in the annnh model , such a phase always has higher energy than the spiral .",
    "thus , if it exists as a stable phase , a more complex hamiltonian would be indicated ."
