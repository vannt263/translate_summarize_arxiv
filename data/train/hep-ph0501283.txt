    "over the next five years the present generation of oscillation experiments at accelerators with long - baseline @xmath3 beams , k2k at kek @xcite , minos at numi beam of fnal @xcite and icarus and opera @xcite at cngs cern to gran sasso neutrino beams @xcite is expected to confirm the @xmath4 transitions observed in the atmospheric @xmath5 and measure @xmath6 and @xmath7 within @xmath8 of accuracy if @xmath9 ev@xmath10 .",
    "k2k and minos are looking for neutrino disappearance , by measuring the @xmath3 survival probability as a function of neutrino energy while icarus and opera will search for evidence of @xmath11 interactions in conventional @xmath3 beams .",
    "even not explicitly optimized for @xmath12 searches these experiments can explore @xmath13 oscillation parameter beyond the chooz limit @xcite .",
    "in particular icarus and opera @xcite can reach a combined sensitivity on @xmath13 ( cp violation and matter effects not accounted for ) a factor @xmath14 better than chooz in the allowed parameter region of atmospheric neutrino oscillations for five years exposure to the cngs beam at nominal intensity @xcite .",
    "the @xmath12 oscillations will be searched for as @xmath15 charge current events excess over the @xmath15 contamination of the beam : the key issue will be the knowledge of the neutrino beam composition and spectrum .",
    "a strong impact on @xmath13 sensitivity is expected from the systematics of the @xmath16 ratio , and in particular from its normalization error .",
    "the cngs beam - line design was accomplished on the basis of the previous wanf @xmath17 beam experience at cern sps @xcite for chorus and nomad experiments @xcite which allowed for a powerful study of the neutrino beam providing a strong benchmark for conventional neutrino beams and in particular for the cngs . in this sense",
    "the cngs beam systematics on @xmath16 ratio can be derived and predicted from the previous measurements and studies performed with the wanf .",
    "in the wanf @xmath17 facility 450 gev / c protons were extracted by the sps and sent into a segmented target composed by 11 be rods , 10 cm of length and 3 mm diameter each .",
    "the produced positive ( negative ) mesons , essentially @xmath18 and @xmath19 , were focused ( defocused ) by two pulsed magnetic lenses ( horn and reflector ) into a 290 m vacuum decay tunnel were neutrinos were produced .",
    "the resulting @xmath17 beam in nomad at 840 m from the be target , was characterized by an energy @xmath20 gev and a contamination of @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 of @xmath24 , @xmath15 and @xmath25 respectively .",
    "four main processes as sources of neutrinos were recognized :    * 450 gev / c proton interactions in the be target which produce @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , ... originating @xmath29 of the @xmath17 flux in nomad ; * primary protons non interacting or missing the target which produce in the horn and reflector walls , windows and beam - dump , mesons only weakly or not focused by the beam - optics ( @xmath30 of @xmath31 ) ; * `` prompt neutrinos '' generated in the decay of charmed particles and kaons in the target and dump yielding @xmath32 of @xmath25 ; * particles reinteractions along the beam - line affecting @xmath33 of @xmath17 and @xmath15 but @xmath34 of defocused component @xmath35 .",
    "-1.5 cm -0.5 cm    -5.0 cm    -1.3 cm    -0.5 cm    -0.7 cm in order to predict energy spectra , intensity and composition of the @xmath5 beam a sound knowledge of meson production in the target is required .",
    "indeed the accurate description of the @xmath36 and @xmath28 relative to the @xmath37 is essential to calculate the @xmath15 initial content in the beam .",
    "direct measurements of @xmath18 and @xmath19 production in be by 400 gev / c protons were performed by na20 collaboration @xcite and by the spy collaboration @xcite at 450 gev / c .",
    "accuracy of monte carlo generators of hadronic interactions for the meson production could limit the sensitivity to neutrino oscillation searches .",
    "the best agreement between predictions and data was found with fluka standalone code @xcite which reproduces the measured @xmath18 and @xmath19 yields at the level of @xmath38 in the momentum region @xmath39 gev / c which is expected to contribute most to @xmath5 flux @xcite .",
    "furthermore an accurate description of the primary proton beam spot , focusing system as well as of the materials inserted in the beam line from the target to the dump ( hadronic reinteraction processes ) is also mandatory especially for the neutrino beam minor components .",
    "a complete analysis of this @xmath5 beam was performed by a beam line simulation from the be target up to the nomad detector including the fluka generator with further corrections to the meson production based on the residual differences between the predicted and measured meson yield in be .",
    "these reweighting functions were calculated as a function of the meson momentum by integrating the particle production over 10 mrad of angular acceptance and including also the transport efficiency as a function of production angle along the beam - line .",
    "the @xmath40 reweighting was obtained from the corresponding for @xmath27 using a  quark - counting model  with 15 % of uncertainty @xcite .",
    "the agreement with the measured @xmath5 interactions in nomad was at the few percent level ( fig .",
    "[ nu - cc ] ) with a systematic normalization error of @xmath41 on @xmath3cc / p.o.t . essentially determined by the accuracy on the @xmath37 and @xmath36 production in the be target ( @xmath42 ) and on the proton beam spot position on",
    "the be target .",
    "the corresponding energy dependent error ranged between 2 and @xmath43 in the @xmath44 gev neutrino energy . due to correlations between the sources of the @xmath17 and @xmath15 fluxes , the normalization uncertainties on",
    "@xmath45 ratio was smaller the the uncertainties on the individual @xmath17 and @xmath15 fluxes : @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "the corresponding energy - dependent uncertainty ranged from 4 to 6 @xmath47 .    -0.9",
    "cm    -7.1 cm",
    "in the cngs neutrino beam facility ( fig . [ cngslayout ] ) the primary protons at 400 gev / c of momentum with nominal intensity of @xmath48 pot / year ( proton beam shared operations ) , will be extracted from the cern sps and sent to a carbon target , 13 graphite rods of 10 cm length , 5 and 4 mm of diameter , the first eight spaced by 9 cm .",
    "similarly to previous wanf neutrino beam a magnetic horn and a reflector will allow the focusing ( defocusing ) of positive ( negative)charged secondaries into a @xmath49 1 km long decay tunnel where an intense @xmath17 neutrino beam is produced .",
    "a large graphite and iron dump will absorb the residual hadrons at the end on the beam - line .",
    "a particular attention was devoted to have the full containment of the proton beam spot in the target and to reduce as well as possible the quantity of material in the beam line in order to maximize the neutrino flux in the gran sasso site .",
    "a full detailed simulation of the cngs beam line was performed within fluka framework . at the nominal proton beam intensity @xmath48 pot / year ( proton beam shared operations ) roughly 2900 @xmath17cc / kt / year are expected at the gran sasso site .",
    "the increase the proton beam intensity has been studied , resulting in a possible upgrade bigger than @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "the muon neutrino flux will be characterized by an average energy of @xmath51 gev and @xmath52 @xmath15 to @xmath3 contamination for @xmath53 gev ( fig .",
    "[ cngs - beam ] ) .",
    "the @xmath24 and @xmath25 component are below @xmath54 and @xmath55 respectively",
    ". the @xmath56 intrinsic level in the beam will be below @xmath57 allowing for clean @xmath0 appearance experiments with both icarus and opera detectors .",
    "due to the 732 km of baseline",
    "the contribution to neutrino beam from the @xmath58 , @xmath28 is reduced by a factor @xmath59 with respect to the wanf , while those from high energy proton interactions downstream of the graphite target and from prompt charmed particles and kaons decay in the target and dump are negligible .",
    "the @xmath15 component will be mainly produced in the @xmath60 decay instead from @xmath36 and @xmath28 as in the wanf .",
    "the previous scheme used for the wanf neutrino beam calculation based on fluka and spy , na20 hadroproduction data in be is well suitable for the cngs neutrino neutrino beam .",
    "the be - c scaling due to the different target material is expected to be almost independent on the secondary meson type , to depend only weakly on the transverse momentum of the meson , so contributing less than @xmath54 to the uncertainty on neutrino flux and less than @xmath61 to @xmath16 ratio .",
    "the systematics of neutrino flux at gran sasso can be evaluated from the wanf by properly rescaling the contribution of each meson to neutrino flux according to the different production processes .",
    "a total normalization error of @xmath62 can be predicted for both @xmath17 and @xmath15 where @xmath63 of uncertainty is the secondary production at the target and @xmath64 error is due to particle reinteractions along the beam - line .",
    "owing to the target configuration and the 732 km base - line , the position of proton beam on the target section , the beam - line optics such as horn and reflector currents and the amount of material included in the simulation are not critical but contribute only @xmath65 to normalization error of @xmath17 and @xmath15 flux . due to correlations between the sources of the @xmath17 and @xmath15 fluxes , where both neutrinos are essentially produced from @xmath37 of different momenta , the @xmath17 by pion decay and @xmath15 from the subsequent muon decay , a large cancellation occurs in the @xmath16 error evaluation .",
    "therefore the normalization uncertainty on @xmath16 is expected to be only @xmath66 .",
    "the corresponding bin - to - bin energy dependent error is estimated to be @xmath67 in the relevant part of the spectrum for @xmath17 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 ratio .    -1.0",
    "the cern to gran sasso cngs neutrino beam project for @xmath0 oscillation search with icarus and opera detectors largely benefits of the wanf experience with chorus and nomad experiments .    the neutrino flux can be predicted at gran sasso within a systematic uncertainty @xmath68 , the @xmath16 ratio will be known with @xmath66 normalization error and @xmath69 energy dependent error , better than quoted by icarus and opera , opening the possibility to search for @xmath1 oscillation exploring @xmath13 beyond the chooz limit .",
    "however the sensitivity on both @xmath0 and @xmath1 oscillation channels are completely dominated by the statistics . in 5 years of cngs standard operations ,",
    "@xmath48 pot / year , 12 @xmath56 cc events can be recognized in icarus and similarly in opera if @xmath70 ev@xmath10 . in the same time",
    "an excess of only 21 @xmath1 cc events over 120 @xmath15cc from beam contamination and @xmath0 is expected in icarus ( 2.35 kton fiducial mass ) for @xmath71 gev if @xmath72 ( @xmath73 ) .",
    "the foreseen increase of proton beam intensity is mandatory ."
