    "this should be compared to the predictions @xmath93 and @xmath94 obtained using the strong and ` weak - scalar ' fits of ref .",
    "indeed , in @xcite we concluded that the weak - scalar triple - pomeron coupling was disfavoured both by the fit to the triple - regge data and by the @xmath83 data . on the other hand ,",
    "the triple - regge data can be reasonably accommodated by the weak - vector coupling , although this triple - pomeron coupling is still a bit disfavoured , in comparison with the strong coupling regime , by the @xmath83 data .",
    "unfortunately , ( a ) we have no data at smaller @xmath95 and ( b ) the cross section of inelastic @xmath96 diffractive photoproduction has never been published in a journal .",
    "thus , these data can not be considered as a strong argument against the ` weak - vector ' coupling scenario .",
