    "the energy pumped into the homogeneous mode by the rf - excitation is only partly relaxed by intrinsic uniform mode damping . in fact , a significant portion of the energy is distributed to non - uniform modes by additional magnon - magnon scattering processes and subsequently relaxed by intrinsic damping as illustrated in supplementary figure s3 .",

    "in addition the spin - wave frequencies are shifted upwards by about 500 mhz relative to the dispersion in the linear regime.,scaledwidth=44.0% ]    in order to unravel the physical origin for this discrepancy we develop an analytic model that can describe the involved processes .",
    "compared to micromagnetics an analytic approach can provide insight into the physics and reduce the computational expense drastically .",
    "we start with the landau - lifshitz - gilbert ( llg ) equation for the dynamics of the magnetization ( see methods c ) .",
    "the uniform mode dynamics can be described by a macrospin , even when a linearization of the llg equation is no longer valid .",
    "as the non - uniform modes are not directly driven by the external field , their amplitudes are small ( at the thermal level ) .",
    "hence we restrict our considerations to linear terms in the spin - wave amplitude @xmath59 and write the equation of motion for the transverse components in matrix form @xcite : @xmath60 straight forward transformations allow to demonstrate the physical meaning more clearly .",
    "first , the separation of the transverse coordinates leads to the differential equation of a parametric oscillator for the spin - wave amplitudes @xmath61 @xmath62 in this equation one can recognize the parametric nature of the instability processes . by further appropriate algebraic transformations ( see methods ) one can rewrite eq .",
    "[ posc ] as follows @xmath63 with a time periodic function @xmath64 .",
    "this equation is very similar to the schrdinger equation describing a quantum particle in a 1d periodic potential ( see methods ) . under the assumption that @xmath65 is a harmonic function",
    "one can rewrite [ periodicpotential ] as the mathieu equation : @xmath66 this equation has been extensively studied due to its significance for fundamental quantum mechanical problems @xcite . while for a quantum particle the amplitude and phase of a wave function oscillates with the spatial period of the potential",

    "this procedure quickly provides the critical modes as well as wave vector dependent non - linear frequency shift and relaxation rates as demonstrated in fig .",
    "in addition to the non - linear shift of the dispersion also a pronounced frequency locking effect is found in the vicinity of the critical spin - waves ( fig .",
    "[ diso]b ) .",
    "a fundamental finding from our model is that the excited spin - waves do not precess at the driving frequency as expected for the 4-magnon scattering processes that usually lead to the 2nd order suhl instability @xcite .",
    "instead we find that the spin - waves precess non - monochromatically at frequencies that are half - integer multiples of the driving frequency with additional oscillations of their amplitude and phase at the driving frequency ( see fig .",

    "in agreement with micromagnetic simulations ( points ) we find that these modes are characterized by a significant modulation of the instantaneous resonance frequency @xmath67 .",
    "the blue lines show the envelope of the amplitude - phase - oscillations .",
    "b ) the instability diagram of the mathieu equation shows the relation between suhl instability processes and the instability processes described in this paper .",
    "the suhl instability processes only represent the special case of vanishing modulation amplitude ( high bias fields ) . , scaledwidth=48.0% ]    in fact the model we present here also well reproduces the 2nd order suhl instability at higher magnetic bias fields ( lower modulation strengths ) . using eq .",

    "@xmath70 , @xmath71 is the mean frequency of the spin - wave , @xmath72 is the frequency of the modulation and the parameter @xmath69 is the modulation strength .",
    "thus we can calculate a 2d instability diagram of the mathieu equation as shown in fig .",
    "[ apo]b . in this representation",
    "suhl instability processes occur for small modulation amplitudes .",
    "we would like to note that this behavior has was not considered so far and that it is worthwhile to examine previous experiments in light of these findings and we believe that these non - linear processes explain the observation of a wave vector dependent gilbert damping by two groups obtained under similar experimental conditions @xcite . reviewing the frequency dependent measurements performed by gerrits et al .",
    "@xcite we are able to reproduce their experimentally found threshold fields with our model quite accurately , as shown in supplementary figure s4 .",
    "we therefore conclude that the observed threshold fields correspond to the type of instability processes described in the present work . in order to verify the applicability of our model",
    "also for suhl instability processes the rf - threshold amplitude fields were calculated as a function of magnetic bias field , so called butterfly curves , and compared with @xcite for subsidiary absorption ( 1st order suhl instability ) and for resonance saturation ( 2nd order suhl instability)@xcite .",
    "we find very good agreement with the measurements in both cases using a wave number independent intrinsic gilbert damping parameter .    in order to further validate our experimental and theoretical results",
    "we also performed extensive micromagnetic simulations @xcite of large amplitude excitation at low magnetic bias fields .",
    "as shown in the inset of fig .  2 and by the points fig .",
    "5(a ) the results of the micromagnetic simulation are in excellent agreement with experiment and theory .",
    "evidence of this shown in supplentary figure s5 where the results of extensive micromagnetic simulations are displayed in k - space . in agreement with predictions from the mathieu equation ( see fig .",
    "4b ) the critical spin - wave modes oscillate at @xmath73 .    in conclusion , we investigated experimentally and theoretically the non - linear magnetization dynamics in magnetic films at low magnetic bias fields .",
    "our analysis led to a new and more general description of parametric excitation not limited to small modulations . using this method we found a new class of spin - wave instabilities that dominate the non - linear response at low fields .",
    "the recipe that has been developed here should prove very valuable for the description of non - linear magnetization dynamics .",
    "using our results it is clear that the gilbert damping parameter is wave vector independent for the wave vectors involved in 4-magnon scattering at low bias fields . in addition the model developed here allows to predict the critical spin - wave modes for high amplitude excitation very quickly .    financial support by the german ministry of education and research ( bmbf ) through project no .",

    "synchronization is ensured by a synthesized microwave generator , which uses the ring frequency of 500  mhz as a reference in order to generate the required rf - frequency .",
    "the phase of the microwave excitation with respect to the x - ray pulses is adjusted by the signal generator . in order to allow lock - in detection of the xmcd signal the phase of the microwaves is modulated by @xmath79 at a frequency of a few khz . due to the synchronization of the microwave signal and the x - ray bunches ,",

    "the normalized signal is an absolute measure of the amplitude of the magnetization dynamics , evaluated in units of the saturation magnetization or as cone angle of the precession of the magnetization vector .",

    "we can eliminate the damping term : @xmath96 with @xmath97 .",
    "now we introduce the dimensionless parameter @xmath98 and assume that @xmath64 varies periodically with the frequency @xmath99 .",
    "one thus obtains : @xmath100 where we use @xmath101 in order to find approximate solutions .",
    "this assumption only implies that the time dependent modulation of the parametric oscillator is sinusoidal with a single frequency ( for example the driving frequency @xmath99 ) .",
    "equation ( [ periodicpotential ] ) can then be written in the form of the mathieu equation : @xmath102 according to floquet s theorem @xcite the solutions of this equation are of the form : @xmath103 where the complex number @xmath104 is called the mathieu exponent and @xmath105 is a periodic function in @xmath5 ( with period @xmath106 ) .",
