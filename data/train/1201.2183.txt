    "ultra - high energy cosmic rays ( uhecrs ) are particles with energy above 10@xmath0 ev reaching the earth .",
    "almost a century after the discovery of cosmic radiation , the origin , chemical composition and mechanisms of acceleration and propagation of the uhecrs remain a mystery@xcite .",
    "the way their arrival directions are represented is by associating each event with its corresponding latitude and longitude in the celestial sphere . for charged particles ,",
    "the pervasive cosmic magnetic fields play an important role , affecting the distribution of arrival directions of uhecrs .",
    "several mechanisms of acceleration of uhecr in different astrophysical sites result on a power law differential energy spectrum@xcite , i. e. , @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the spectral index . for a single source emitting uhecrs of energy @xmath3 according to this spectrum ,",
    "the expected angular deflection is inversely proportional to the energy .",
    "therefore , particles with different energies will deflect differently and the greater the energy of the particle the smaller the angular deflection of the particle ( and vice - versa ) .",
    "so , if locally , the typical scale of the intervening magnetic fields ( coherence length ) is smaller or of the same order of magnitude of the larmor radius of the cosmic ray , filamentary structures in sky maps are expected to be formed .",
    "the cosmic ray events that compose this structure are ordered by energy , creating the so - called multiplets of uhecrs . for the galactic magnetic field the expected angular deflection ( @xmath4 ) is given by@xcite @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the distance to the source",
    ", @xmath7 is the magnetic field , @xmath8 is the atomic number of the nuclei and @xmath3 its energy in eev .",
    "in this work it is proposed a new method ( for another method refer to @xcite ) to identify multiplets in maps containing arrival directions of uhecrs .",
    "this method is based on the spherical wavelet transform@xcite and consists on the correlation of a signal with rotated versions of a given pattern , both defined on a spherical manifold .",
    "let @xmath9 be the coefficients of the spherical harmonic expansion of the signal , and @xmath10 be the same expansion for the sought rotated pattern ( in this case , a wavelet ) .",
    "the correlation coefficient is @xmath11 where the overline indicates the complex conjugate , @xmath12 designates wigner - d functions , @xmath13 is the band limit of the implemented algorithm , and @xmath14 are the euler angles associated to the rotation of the wavelet .    applying the spherical wavelet transform using a code called swat ( spherical wavelet analysis tool)@xcite to the distribution of arrival directions of uhecrs , if the correlation coefficient is high , this indicates a similarity between the pattern ( wavelet ) used and the signal .",
    "the euler angles provide information regarding the coordinates ( latitude and longitude ) where there is a maximal correlation coefficient , and the orientation of the pattern .",
    "even though the method is able to identify filamentary structures , it does not take into account the energy ordering of the events for the analysis .",
    "this is done by choosing a rectangle of dimensions @xmath15",
    "12@xmath16 @xmath17 1.5@xmath16 ( typical dimensions of a multiplet ) with the obtained orientation , and calculating the pearson coefficient for @xmath18 of the events within this rectangle .",
    "if this coefficient is high , it indicates an energy ordering and the filamentary structure is a possible multiplet candidate .",
    "events of uhecrs were simulated using the code crt@xcite , which numerically solves lorentz force equations of motion for charged particles in a magnetic field using fifth order adaptative runge - kutta routines .",
    "fifty proton events were simulated from a hypothetical source lying at a distance of 4 kpc from earth , with galactic coordinates @xmath19 . the source was assumed to have an injection spectrum with @xmath20 and to emit particles within a perfectly collimated jet .",
    "the magnetic field models used in the simulation are the ones proposed by harari , mollerach and roulet@xcite , namely the ass - s , ass - a , bss - s and bss - a models , were ass stands for axisymmetric spiral ( even under the transformation @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the azimuth angle ) and bss for bisymmetric spiral ( odd with respect to the mentioned transformation ) . the sufixes -a and -s indicate the parity of the transformation above and below the galactic disk , where -s is symmetric ( even ) and -a is antisymmetric ( odd ) with respect to the @xmath23 transformation . in this class of models the magnetic field in the disk of the galaxy",
    "can be decomposed in a radial and an azimuthal part , depending on the pitch angle ( @xmath24 ) of the logarithmic spiral that models the magnetic field of the milky way .",
    "the intensity of the magnetic field in the disk is @xmath25 where @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 is 1 for bss models and 2 for ass models .",
    "the @xmath30 component of the magnetic field is @xmath31^{-1 } \\zeta(z ) { \\    } { \\   } \\mu g,\\ ] ] where @xmath32 for -a models and @xmath33 for -s models , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 .    by applying the method to these specific simulations , using the wavelet transform with suitable parameters ( compatible with the expected dimensions of a multiplet ) ,",
    "the multiplet was correctly identified and the orientation for different models was calculated and is shown in table [ tab : tab ] .",
    "figure [ fig : mult ] shows the simulated events for the simulations .    [ tab : tab ]    .orientation ( @xmath37 ) for the simulated source in the class of models of harari , mollerach and roulet , for the different symmetries . [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : tab ]",
    "the orientation of the multiplet , i.e. , the angle it forms with the galactic plane , depends on the coordinates of the source and the magnetic field model adopted .",
    "therefore , it is possible to set limits on models of the galactic magnetic field by analysing the orientation of multiplets . when the method was applied to simulated data , the multiplets were correctly identified and it was noticed a relation between the orientation of the multiplet and the adopted model . if this method is applied to data collected by the pierre auger observatory or any other cosmic ray experiment and is able to successfully identify multiplets , a new tool to probe the galactic magnetic field will be available .",
