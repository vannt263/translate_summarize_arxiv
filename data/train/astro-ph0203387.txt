    "the widely accepted scenario for the formation of a millisecond pulsar is the recycling of an old neutron star ( hereafter ns ) by a spin - up process driven by accretion of matter and angular momentum from a keplerian disc , fueled _ via _ roche lobe overflow of a binary late type companion ( see bhattacharya & van den heuvel 1991 for a review ) . if the ns has a magnetic dipole moment ( typical values are @xmath1 g @xmath2 ) the disc is truncated at the magnetosphere , where the disc pressure is balanced by the magnetic pressure exerted by the ns magnetic field ( @xmath3 ) , where @xmath4 is the generic radial distance from the ns center .",
    "once the accretion and spin - up process ends , the ns is visible as a millisecond radio pulsar ( hereafter msp ) .",
    "indeed , a common requirement of all the models of the emission mechanism from a rotating magnetic dipole is that the space surrounding the ns is free of matter up to the light cylinder radius @xmath5 ( at which the speed of a body rigidly rotating with the ns equals the speed of light ) .",
    "an interesting evolutionary phase can occur during the accretion onto the ns if the mass transfer rate drops below the level required to allow the expansion of the magnetosphere beyond @xmath6 switching  on the emission from the rotating magnetic dipole ( e.g. illarionov and sunyaev , 1975 ; ruderman , shaham & tavani 1989 ; stella et al . , 1994 ) .",
    "in a standard shakura sunyaev accretion disk , it is common to identify four zones based on the different roles of opacities ( free  free or electron scattering ) and pressures ( radiation or gas pressure ) .",
    "the radius of separation between the zone ( b ) , in which the electron scattering opacity and gas pressure dominate , and the most external zone ( c ) , where the free - free opacity and gas pressure dominate , is @xmath7(see , e.g. burderi , king & szuszkiewicz 1998 ) , where @xmath8 is the luminosity in units of @xmath9 erg s@xmath10 , @xmath11 is the ns radius in units of @xmath12 cm , and @xmath13 is the ns mass in solar masses .",
    "the typical distance of the inner lagrangian point from the ns is larger than @xmath14 cm for orbital periods longer than @xmath15 hr . close to the roche - lobe",
    "the disc is then in zone c , where opacity is dominated by free - free processes and pressure is dominated by the gas contribution . in this case , @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the accretion rate .",
    "the radial dependence of the pulsar radiation pressure is @xmath18   ( where @xmath19   is the ns spin period ) , and then it is flatter than the radial dependence of the disc pressure close to the inner lagrangian point",
    ". therefore , @xmath20 dominates over @xmath21 for any @xmath22   and the whole accretion disc is swept away up to the inner lagrangian point @xmath23 by the radiation pressure of the pulsar . during this `` radio ejection '' phase , the mechanism that drives _ mass overflow _ from @xmath23 can well be active , but _ the pulsar radiation pressure at @xmath23 prevents mass accretion onto the ns_.    the occurrence of a radio  ejection phase in the pre  msp evolution has been recently proposed by burderi et al .",

    "a typical progenitor system of binary msps is made by a ns ( hereafter the primary ) accreting from a giant , or from a star on its way to become a giant ( hereafter the secondary ) .",
    "this is testified by the many msps with low mass ( @xmath24 ) white dwarf ( wd ) binary companions ( e.g. rappaport et al .",
    "1995 , van kerkwijk et al .",
    "1996 , burderi et al .",
    "1998 ) , the remnants predicted by this type of semidetached evolution .",
    "the ns spin ",
    "up occurs _ via _ the accretion of angular momentum of the mass overflowing the roche lobe .",
    "this mass transfer is dictated by the nuclear evolution of the secondary , and the losses of systemic angular momentum also contribute to determine the mass transfer rate .",
    "it is well possible that mass transfer during the spin  up phase suffers instabilities ( see below ) and the system temporarily detaches , allowing the pulsar to switch  on .",
    "however the companion evolution , which leads to radius expansion , will lead again to overflow .",
    "mass exchange to the ns and spin  up will go on , until the pulsar has been so much spun up that its radiation pressure at the inner lagrangian point is high enough to prevent mass accretion .",
    "modeling of the binary evolution at the time of action of this radio ejection mechanism is non trivial , and an adequate study of the physics involved and numerical simulations are needed to adequately investigate this problem , as it has been done for the case of  evaporation \" of low mass companions of msps ( tavani & brookshaw 1991 , banit & shaham 1992 ) .",
    "the destiny of the system is crucially dependent on global mass radius exponent of the mass losing component , on the mass ratio and on the specific angular momentum of the ejected matter @xmath25 ( see ritter , 1995 , for general discussion of the stability of mass transfer ) .",
    "we can foresee cases in which @xmath25  is very large with respect to the specific angular momentum of the system , and a dynamical phase of mass transfer can occur ( burderi et al .",
    ", 2002 , in preparation ) . here",
    ", we will follow only the case in which @xmath25  is the specific angular momentum at the inner lagrangian point , and the evolution is stationary : the orbit widens and the companion placidly expands on its nuclear timescale , keeping its contact with the roche lobe .    the main consequence of the occurrence of the radio  ejection phase , will be that _ the matter lost from the secondary will not be transferred to the ns_. this phenomenon may look like the so called `` ablation '' of the companion irradiated by the wind ( composed of electromagnetic radiation and relativistic particles ) of a msp ( tavani 1991 ) .",
    "the key difference is that , in the ablation mechanism , the process takes place once the companion is detached ( and is evolved into a low  mass white dwarf ) , while radio  ejection takes place _ during the active phase of roche lobe overflow by the secondary _ , and the energy requirements are much easier to be met .",
    "moreover , the energy available to ablate the companion is different , being the orbital binding energy in the case of radio  ejection and the pulsar rotational energy in the case of ablation .",
    "observationally , in both cases we expect to be in the presence of a radio msp which from time to time is obscured by the matter floating around the system .    in this paper we propose that this postulated radio ejection phase has now been detected in the system containing the eclipsing millisecond pulsar , discovered by damico et al .",

    ".    we will provide convincing evidence that is an example of a system in the radio  ejection phase , by modeling the evolution of the possible binary system progenitor .",
    "we also discuss why we should expect that this type of system may indeed suffer the detachments required in order to initiate the radio  ejection phase : in fact , the x - ray illumination of the secondary star during the accretion phases , which leads to the ns spin up , is such that the mass transfer rate is probably very unsteady .",
    "when : + i ) as a result of the accretion of matter and angular momentum , the ns spin period is so short that , potentially , the radiation pressure of a pulsar phase would be high enough to overcome the pressure of the matter overflowing the roche lobe , and + ii ) the oscillations in @xmath17 are large enough to allow the millisecond pulsar to switch  on , + the radio  ejection phase begins , leading to the appearance of the system as it looks now .",
    "we also show that the most luminous ` hot ' objects in ngc 6397 identified by taylor et al .",

    "similar variations have been observed , at 400 mhz , in the eclipsing pulsar psr b1957 + 20 close to the eclipse ingress and egress ( fruchter et al .",
    "1990 ) and in psr j2051 - 0827 , at 1.4 ghz , when the pulsed signal is occasionally detected during the eclipse ( stappers et al .",

    "this means that the eclipsing matter is beyond the gravitational influence of the companion star and must be continuously replenished .",
    "we can estimate a rough order of magnitude of the necessary mass loss rate from the secondary , @xmath17 , by assuming spherical symmetry ( which _ is not _ consistent with the randomly variable signal intensity shown by the radio data ) .",

    "we adopt the parameters given above , the derived @xmath64 cm @xmath65   and @xmath66 .",
    "we finally choose @xmath67 , typical of winds driven by the radiation of a pulsar ( tavani & brookshaw 1991 ) and @xmath403 times the escape velocity from the companion .",
    "we get @xmath68 . even considering the uncertainty on this estimate , winds induced by the pulsar radiation are more typically 23 orders of magnitude weaker ( tavani & brookshaw , 1991 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if such a wind were independent from the association with the pulsar in a binary , it would be a common feature in the evolution of the _ single _ stars in ngc 6397 .",
    "but the survival of lithium at the stellar surface is consistent only with rates smaller than @xmath69 yr@xmath10   ( vauclair and charbonnel 1995 ) as a stronger wind , acting over the 10 gyr of the cluster lifetime , would expose the stellar layers in which lithium has been destroyed by nuclear burning .",
    "the turnoff stars in ngc 6397 _ do show _ lithium at a level about normal for population ii stars ( pasquini and molaro 1996 ) , putting strong upper limits to the mass loss rates of main sequence winds .",
    "therefore , the mass loss rates which we derive are much more consistent with roche lobe overflow driven by nuclear evolution of the secondary and orbital angular momentum mass loss , than with a possible wind from the secondary , suggested by damico et al .",

    "the pulsar luminosity is in fact estimated to be @xmath76 erg s@xmath10 ( see below ) , of which , in the hypothesis of isotropic emission , a fraction @xmath77 impacts at the mass losing star surface ( @xmath78 and @xmath45 being the radius of the secondary and the orbital separation respectively ) . even in the most favorable case of a secondary filling its roche lobe the fraction of the pulsar luminosity impacting",

    "we considered secondary masses ranging from 0.25 up to 0.81 and corresponding ns masses from 2.0 down to 1.4 ( conservative mass transfer ) .",
    "we obtained values of @xmath81 ranging from @xmath82 to @xmath83 respectively .",
    "therefore the fraction of the pulsar luminosity reprocessed by the secondary is not very important for determining the hr diagram location of the star .",
    "the orbital period is moderately large , so any stage of mass transfer must have begun while the mass losing component was still not much evolved .",
    "+ 2 ) we exclude the possibility that the star is a normal ms star losing a stellar wind at rates @xmath84/yr , for the reasons given at the end of sect .",
    "+ 3 ) the pulsar spin up to 3.65 ms must be due to mass exchange in a previous evolutionary phase . indeed",
    "the possibility that the ns was born with such a period seems unlikely as the spin - down age of is @xmath85 myr ( d amico et al .",
    "2001 ) , which is much shorter than the age of the globular cluster ngc 6397 in which is located .",
    "the easiest way is to attribute it to the previous evolution of the system .",
    "therefore we model the initial parameter of the system as starting with a 0.85 component and a ns component of 1.4 .",
    "ngc 6397 is a post core collapse globular cluster ( diorgovski & king 1986 ) , in which a significant number of interacting neutron star plus main sequence binaries may have formed by tidal capture or exchange collisions ( e.g. davies , benz and hill 1992 , di stefano and rappaport 1993 ) .",
    "implicitly , we are making the assumption that the 0.85  component has been captured by the ns at such a separation to be able to begin mass transfer when it is not yet evolved as a giant .",
    "this is in line with what has been recently suggested by podsiadlowski , rappaport , and pfahl ( 2002 check ! ) that suggest , supported by the numerous ultracompact binaries found in globular clusters , that tidal capture seem to be a more likely way to produce this kind of system .      we follow the binary evolution with the aton1.2 code ( dantona , mazzitelli , & ritter 1989 ) .",
    "the mass loss rate is computed following the formulation by ritter ( 1988 ) , as an exponential function of the distance of the stellar radius to the roche lobe , in units of the pressure scale height .",
    "this method also allows to compute the first phases of mass transfer , during which the rate reaches values which can be much larger than the stationary values , due to the thermal response of the star to mass loss .",
    "the evolution of the system also includes orbital angular momentum losses through magnetic braking , in the verbunt and zwaan ( 1981 ) formulation , in which the braking parameter is set to @xmath86 .",
    "we also tested a case in which @xmath87 .",
    "we study four cases of evolution ( see table 1 ) . in all cases , we assume that the secondary initial mass is @xmath88 , the primary neutron star has @xmath89 , and the orbital initial period is 14.27hr .",
    "the nuclear age of the 0.85is @xmath90gyr when it begins the roche lobe overflow , so that it is only slightly evolved , and hydrogen is almost exhausted in its ( radiative ) core . in case 1 , we assume a ` standard ' conservative evolution .",
    "this produces mass transfer rates of @xmath91 yr@xmath10 .",
    "the system would thus appear as a low mass x ",
    "ray binary ( lmxb ) .",
    "the x  ray emission expected from the ns is @xmath92 erg / s .",
    "the evolution is typical for such systems ( e.g. bhattacharya & van den heuvel , 1991 ) .",
    "the end product will be a very low mass helium white dwarf ( @xmath93 ) in a much wider orbit ( @xmath94 hr ) with a 2  neutron star .",
    "being the hydrogen not yet completely exhausted in the stellar core when mass transfer begins , the initial binary period we have chosen is indeed very close to the `` bifurcation '' period below which the orbital evolution proceeds towards shorter binary periods .",
    "note that in our case the bifurcation period is shorter than that quoted by podsiadlowski , rappaport , and pfahl ( 2002 ) for a binary composed by a 1.4  ns plus a 1.0  secondary , namely @xmath95 hr .",
    "this is due to the fact that the main sequence radius of our 0.85 population ii secondary is @xmath96 smaller than the radius of a population i , 1.0  companion for comparable consumption of the hydrogen in the core .",
    "since for a roche - lobe filling secondary we have that @xmath97 , the bifurcation period for the population i , 1.0  companion will be @xmath98 longer than in our case and therefore consistent with the result of podsiadlowski , rappaport , and pfahl ( 2002 ) . having in mind the oberved system",
    ", we followed another case of evolution ( case 2 ) in which we assumed conservative evolution up to an orbital period of @xmath99 hr , and then we assumed that the matter lost from the secondary is all lost from the system at the inner lagrangian point l1 with its specific angular momentum .",
    "this alters slightly the conservative evolution , leading to marginally different mass loss rates and final parameters for the system when all the seconday hydrogen envelope is lost and the star becomes a white dwarf ( see table 1 ) .    when mass accretion on the ns is assumed , and the binary evolution suffers a lmxb phase , it is also important to consider how the x  ray phase would affect the binary evolution we are considering , as a fraction @xmath100 of the x  ray luminosity ( see point 1 above ) impacts at the secondary surface .",
    "there have been many attempts to model the effect of this irradiation on the binary evolution , when it has been realized that spherically symmetric illumination in lmxbs can have a dramatic effect on the structure of low mass secondaries having convective envelopes .",
    "in fact , x ",
    "rays block the intrinsic stellar flux produced by the nuclear reactions , leading to a stellar expansion , which affects the mass transfer rates ( podsiadlowski , 1991 ; harpaz & rappaport , 1991 ) . in reality",
    ", illumination will be non - spherical , because only one hemisphere is affected  in fact the donor star is tidally locked as it is filling its roche  lobe during this evolutionary phase  , and its effect will depend on the depth at which the energy is deposited below the photosphere and how fast it can be transported to the cool side of the star . if the circulation time is shorter than the cooling time of the heated matter , we go back to the spherical illumination case .",
    "otherwhise , the global secular evolution is not much affected , but the mass transfer occurs in  outbursts \" whose duration and peak mass transfer rates depend on the efficiency of circulation ( e.g. hameury et al .",
    "1993 , harpaz and rappaport 1994 , vilhu et al .",
    "1994 , dantona 1994 ) .",
    "all the existing computations refer to the evolution of lmxbs with main sequence companions .",
    "we are now dealing with a case of evolution in which the mass losing component is more evolved , and in addition has no important convective envelope at the time the mass transfer begins , so that it is important to have an idea of the possible effects of x  ray illumination in our specific case .",
    "on the other hand , self  consistent modelling is really very difficult , as the feedbacks are not easy to describe both physically and numerically .",
    "however we follow the evolution of an ideal limiting case , considering a system in which the secondary is affected by a fixed value of heating luminosity @xmath101 erg s@xmath10 ( case 3 ) .",
    "we include the effect of illumination as described in dantona and ergma ( 1993 ) , following tout et al .",

    "the phases of mass transfer are slightly altered by the new system conditions , but are globally very similar to case 1 . however , as the star loses mass , its radius becomes larger than the radius of the standard sequence .",

    "if the mass transfer decreases further , irradiation decreases too , the radius also will decrease , trying to reach its non irradiated equilibrium value and the mass transfer rate decreases more .",

    "once the disc has been swept away the pressure of the flow overflowing the inner lagrangian point should be used instead of the pressure of the disc .",
    "however it is possible to demonstrate that these pressures are comparable , which supports the validity of equation [ eq : pcrit ] .",
    "let us suppose that the flow of matter overflowing the inner lagrangian point has a cross sectional area @xmath111 with @xmath112",
    ". moreover the inward speed of the flow is @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the free fall speed and @xmath115 since the coriolis force deviates the flow motion from the radial direction .",
    "the ram pressure of the flow is @xmath116 , where @xmath117 is the density of the flow that is related by the continuity equation to the mass loss rate .",
    "the pressure of a shakura  sunyaev accretion disc is @xmath118 , where @xmath119 is the density of the disc that is , also in this case , related by the continuity equation to the mass loss rate , @xmath120 is the boltzmann constant , and @xmath121 is the temperature of the disc at its midplane ( see e.g. frank , king , and raine 1992 ) .",
    "after some algebraic manipulation , using the standard relations for a sakura  sunyaev accretion disc , we get @xmath122 , where @xmath123 is the half thickness of the disc and @xmath124 . as a good approximation we can take @xmath125 as the dependencies on the disc parameters are rather weak ( see again frank , king , and raine 1992 )",

    "if @xmath139 _ the system will remain in the radio  ejection phase during all the subsequent binary evolution_. in this case , the matter overflowing the roche lobe will be accelerated by its interaction with the pulsar radiation and ejected by the system .",
    "if we can assume ( but at least ballistic simulations should be done ) that this matter leaves the system with the specific angular momentum at the inner lagrangian point , @xmath140 ( @xmath141 is the distance between the ns and the center of mass of the system ) which in our case is quite close to the specific angular momentum of the system , the orbital evolution is indeed very similar to the more conventional evolution with conservative mass transfer to the primary ( as confirmed by our numerical computations of the conservative case 1 and the non conservative case 2 ) .",
    "the optical component of  indeed seems compatible with the evolution we have suggested .",
    "it lies along case 2 evolution , that not including irradiation , as , in fact , the pulsar luminosity is not important as irradiation source for the binary .",
    "we have considered the evolution of possible progenitors of the binary msp in the globular cluster ngc 6397 .",
    "we can reproduce the hr diagram location of the optical companion , starting mass transfer to the ns from a hypothetical secondary of mass 0.85 , slightly evolved off the ms when mass transfer begins . from equation [ eq : pcrit ] , adopting @xmath142 , @xmath143 , @xmath144 , @xmath145 , @xmath146 , @xmath147 , and @xmath148 ,",
    "the critical period @xmath149  to reach the ` radio  ejection ' phase is @xmath150 hr , not very different from @xmath151 , given the large uncertainties in the @xmath57  estimate .",
    "thus , is possibly in the radio  ejection phase . given that @xmath152 the fact that @xmath153 is compelling .",
    "* orbital evolution calculations shows that a slightly evolved 0.85 secondary orbiting a ns can transfer mass to the ns , and reaches a stage in which its mass is reduced to @xmath154 , and its optical location in the hr diagram is then compatible with the recently detected optical counterpart of ; * might represent a system whose evolution has been envisioned by burderi et al .",
    "( 2001 ) : the spin and the magnetic moment of the pulsar may keep the system in a radio  ejection phase in which accretion is inhibited by the radiation pressure exerted by the pulsar on the overflowing matter while the mechanism that drives the roche lobe overflow from the companion is still active , thus causing an intense wind which would be very difficult to explain otherwise .",
    "this evolution seems to be the only viable possibility to explain the long lasting eclipses and the strong intensity variation randomly occurring in the radio emission .    as a final remark we note that @xmath155 suggest the interesting possibility that this system could swiftly switch from the present radio pulsar phase to an accretion phase in which it should be visible as a @xmath156 ergs s@xmath10 lmxb .",

    "<S> we present an evolutionary scenario for the spin - up and evolution of binary millisecond pulsars , according to which the companion of the pulsar , recently discovered as a binary with orbital period of 32.5 hrs in the globular cluster ngc 6397 , is presently in a phase of ` radio  ejection ' mass loss from the system . </S>",
    "<S> the optical counterpart is a star as luminous as the cluster turnoff stars , but with a lower  ( a larger radius ) which we model with a star of initial mass compatible with the masses evolving in the cluster ( @xmath0 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this star has suffered roche lobe overflow while evolving off the main sequence , spinning up the neutron star to the present period of 3.65 ms . at present , </S>",
    "<S> roche lobe overflow due to the nuclear evolution of the pulsar companion and to systemic angular momentum losses by magnetic braking is still going on , but accretion is inhibited by the momentum exerted by the radiation of the pulsar on the matter at the inner lagrangian point . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of this matter around the system is consistent with the long lasting irregular radio eclipses seen in the system . </S>",
    "<S> roche lobe deformation of the mass losing component is also necessary to be compatible with the optical light curve . </S>",
    "<S> the  radio  ejection \" phase , which had been recently postulated by us to deal with the problem of the lack of submillisecond pulsars , can be initiated only if the system is subject to intermittency in the mass transfer during the spin  up phase . </S>",
