    "a ranque - hilsch tube is a mechanical device that , without any moving components , separates a stream of gas into a hot and a cold components .",
    "air at @xmath0 and a high pressure of 5.72 atm",
    ". enters tangentially at a cross section of the tube figure 1 . in our configuration the hot stream exits at @xmath1 and the cold stream at @xmath2 .",
    "our tube was constructed following the patent of ranque [ 1 ] .",
    "the physical phenomenon has not been completely understood .",
    "the ranque - hilsch tubes ( vortex tube ) are now commercially used for low - temperature applications . in order to increase the efficiency ,",
    "they have been proposed to replace the conventional expansion nozzle in refrigeration systems .",
    "before we seeded the flow we did nt know the existence of a swirling helicoidal motion , that can be observed in the slow motion videos ( 1200 fps , seeded with baby powder and water ) .",
    "we did expect the helicoidal mode . to introduce the baby powder or the water",
    ", we made an atomizer as shown in figure 2 .",
