    "recent neutrino oscillation experiments have provided significant amount of evidence which confirms the existence of the non - zero yet tiny neutrino masses @xcite . we know that the smallness of three standard model neutrino masses @xcite can be naturally explained via seesaw mechanism . in general ,",
    "such seesaw mechanism can be of three types : type i @xcite , type ii @xcite and type iii @xcite .",
    "all these mechanisms involve the inclusion of additional fermionic or scalar fields to generate tiny neutrino masses at tree level .",
    "although these seesaw models can naturally explain the smallness of neutrino mass compared to the electroweak scale , we are still far away from understanding the origin of neutrino mass hierarchies as suggested by experiments .",
    "recent neutrino oscillation experiments t2k @xcite , double chooz @xcite , daya - bay @xcite and reno @xcite provide the values of various neutrino oscillation parameters as follows : @xmath2 @xmath3 @xmath4 @xmath5 @xmath6 the above recent data have positive evidence for non - zero @xmath7 as well , which was earlier thought to be zero or negligibly small .",
    "the values of these mixing angles have non - trivial impact on the neutrino mass hierarchy as studied in a recent paper @xcite where the author showed that the atmospheric angle @xmath8 is found to discriminate the possible hierarchies in the type i and type ii seesaw frameworks using different texture zero mass matrices . in this context , to know the actual hierarchy of the neutrino masses has become equally important like the issue of non - zero @xmath7 both from neutrino physics as well as cosmology point of view .",
    "recent cosmological upper bound @xcite on the sum of three absolute neutrino masses @xmath9 has ruled out quasi - degenerate neutrino ( qdn ) mass models with @xmath10 .",
    "this has made studying the survivability of qdn models as important as the issue of normal and inverted hierarchical nature of neutrino masses .",
    "detailed analysis of normal versus inverted hierarchical neutrino masses using different approaches started just after the discovery of the neutrino oscillation phenomena .",
    "inverted hierarchical neutrino was studied exclusively in @xcite considering neutrino as a pseudo dirac particle with non - conservation of @xmath11 where @xmath12 denotes lepton number corresponding to individual lepton @xmath13 generation .",
    "use of specific grand unified models explaining the seesaw mechanisms has also been done in the last few years to study the hierarchy of neutrino masses .",
    "an analysis done in @xcite showed that every normal neutrino mass hierarchy solution of a grand unified model corresponds to an inverted hierarchy solution .",
    "it was also mentioned in their work that any future observation of inverted hierarchy would tend to disfavor the grand unified models based on the conventional type i seesaw mechanism . but",
    "models with type ii and type iii or models based on conserved @xmath14 symmetry may favor the inverted hierarchical nature of neutrino masses .",
    "models based on seesaw mechanism with three right handed neutrinos can also generate inverted hierarchical neutrino masses @xcite within the framework of bi - maximal mixing . as stressed earlier , along with the hierarchy of neutrino masses ,",
    "the explanation of non - zero @xmath7 as well as cp violation is also an unsolved agenda in neutrino physics . from supernova",
    "neutrinos point of view , it was shown @xcite that one can discriminate the inverted hierarchy from the normal one if @xmath15 . if a particular neutrino mass hierarchy is assumed this can bias cosmological parameter constraints @xcite like dark energy equation of state parameter as well as the sum of the neutrino masses .    in view of the importance of understanding the hierarchies",
    "as stressed above , this work is planned to present an analysis of normal and inverted neutrino mass hierarchies incorporating the contributions from both type i and type ii seesaw mechanisms . however , our analysis do not attempt to explain non - zero @xmath16 as has already been explained in the literature by considering deviations from the tbm mixing using different corrections .",
    "the present analysis is done within the framework of tbm mixing which theoretically , is a very close approximate description of neutrino mixing . in the present analysis we use the appropriate neutrino mass patterns in the framework of tbm mixing by considering neutrinos to be qdn .",
    "the mass matrices are parameterized for qdn case with the help of present neutrino oscillation data and the cosmological upper bound on the sum of neutrino masses . using these qdn mass matrices and considering two possible structures of the dirac neutrino mass matrix @xmath17 : charged lepton ( cl ) type and up quark ( uq ) type",
    ", we calculate the right - handed majorana mass matrix using type i seesaw formula .",
    "we then take into account the contributions from type ii seesaw term in a generic left - right symmetric theory @xcite . in the presence of both type i and type ii seesaw contributions ,",
    "we perform our detailed analysis to calculate the predictions for neutrino parameters to show the survivability of the qdn scenario . in the end",
    ", we also outline a simple extension of standard model by an abelian gauged flavor symmetry which can give rise to the specific structure of dirac neutrino mass matrices used in the analysis .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section [ method ] we discuss the methodology of type ii seesaw mechanism . in section [ numeric ]",
    "we discuss our numerical analysis and results . in section [ abelian ]",
    "we outline a simple extension of standard model by an abelian gauged flavor symmetry which can naturally give rise to the desired structure of mass matrices and then finally conclude in section [ conclude ] .",
    "type i seesaw framework is the simplest mechanism for generating tiny neutrino masses and mixing .",
    "there is also another type of non - canonical seesaw formula ( known as type - ii seesaw formula)@xcite where a left - handed higgs triplet @xmath18 picks up a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) .",
    "this is possible both in the minimal extension of the standard model by @xmath18 or in other well motivated extensions like left - right symmetric model ( lrsm ) @xcite .",
    "the seesaw formula can be written as @xmath19 where the usual type i seesaw formula is given by the expression , @xmath20 here @xmath17 is the dirac neutrino mass matrix .",
    "the above seesaw formula with both type i and type ii contributions can naturally arise in extension of standard model with three right handed neutrinos and one copy of @xmath18 . however , we will use this formula in the framework of lrsm where @xmath21 arises naturally as a result of parity breaking at high energy and both the type i and type ii terms can be written in terms of @xmath21 as we will see below .    in this present analysis , we consider @xmath17 in a diagonal form and @xmath21 in general non - diagonal form . in lrsm with higgs triplets , @xmath21 can be expressed as @xmath22 with @xmath23 being the vev of the right handed triplet higgs field @xmath24 imparting majorana masses to the right - handed neutrinos and @xmath25 is the corresponding yukawa coupling .",
    "the first term @xmath26 in equation ( [ type2a ] ) is due to the vev of @xmath27 higgs triplet . in the usual lrsm , @xmath26 and @xmath21",
    "are proportional to the vev s of the electrically neutral components of scalar higgs triplets @xmath28 and @xmath24 respectively .",
    "thus , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , where @xmath31 denote the vev s and @xmath32 are symmetric @xmath33 matrices .",
    "the left - right symmetry demands @xmath34 .",
    "the induced vev for the left - handed triplet @xmath35 can be shown for generic lrsm to be @xmath36 with @xmath37 gev being the weak boson mass such that @xmath38 in general @xmath39 is a function of various couplings in the scalar potential of generic lrsm and without any fine tuning @xmath39 is expected to be of the order unity ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "type ii seesaw formula in equation ( [ type2a ] ) can now be expressed as @xmath41    with above seesaw formula ( [ type2 ] ) , the neutrino mass matrices are constructed by considering contributions from both type i and type ii terms . here ,",
    "@xmath21 is defined as @xmath42 . if @xmath43 is held fixed , both terms in equation ( [ type2 ] ) vary as @xmath44 . here",
    "we hold @xmath21 fixed , so the first term is @xmath45 dependent while second term is fixed .",
    "however , different choices of @xmath23 for fixed @xmath21 would lead to different values of @xmath26 while keeping @xmath46 unchanged .",
    "this ambiguity is seen in the literature where different choices of @xmath23 are made according to convenience @xcite . however , in this present work we will always take @xmath23 as @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning that , here @xmath48 gauge symmetry breaking scale ( as in generic lrsm ) @xmath45 is the same as the scale of parity breaking @xcite . using this form of @xmath45 ,",
    "the seesaw formula ( [ type2 ] ) becomes @xmath49 since type ii term is inversely proportional to @xmath39 , smaller values of this parameter ( say , @xmath50 ) would give rise to more dominating type ii term whereas @xmath51 would correspond to the minimum possible contributions from type ii term .",
    "after fixing the symmetry breaking scales as above , we carry out a complete analysis of the normal and inverted hierarchical models of neutrino masses in the framework of tbm mixing .",
    "we vary the dimensionless parameter @xmath39 from @xmath52 to @xmath53 and check the survivability of neutrino mass models with contributions from type i and type ii terms .",
    "we adopt a _ natural selection _ for the survival of neutrino mass models which have the least deviation of @xmath39 from unity .",
    "nearer the value of @xmath39 to one , better the chance for the survival of the model in question .",
    "thus the value of @xmath39 is an important parameter for the proposed natural selection of the neutrino mass models in question .",
    "for detail numerical analysis we use the specific @xmath54 symmetric neutrino mass matrix @xcite which gives rise to tbm type mixing pattern    @xmath55    which has eigenvalues @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "then we parameterize the above matrix for qdn case . from presently available cosmological constraints ,",
    "the upper bound on sum of neutrino masses has come down to the lowest value @xmath59 @xcite which has ruled out qdn neutrino models with @xmath60 .",
    "parametrization of the matrix ( [ matrix1 ] ) is done with this upper bound and taking the largest allowed value @xmath61 consistent with the latest cosmological data . a classification for three - fold qdn neutrino masses @xcite with maximum majorana cp violating phase in their eigenvalues is used here .",
    "cp phase patterns in the mass eigenvalues for both nh and ih are taken as : @xmath0 ( denoted as @xmath62 ) and @xmath1 ( denoted as @xmath63 ) . using the best global fit values of neutrino oscillation observational data @xcite on solar and atmospheric neutrino mass squared differences , and taking @xmath64 , predictions for neutrino parameters are calculated within the cosmological upper bounds mentioned above .",
    "first , we calculate the neutrino mass parameters using the above form of the matrix ( [ matrix1 ] ) taking into account only type i seesaw contributions .",
    "these predictions along with the input parameters for ih and nh cases in presence of only type i seesaw are presented in table [ table : results1 ] .",
    "then we take into account contributions from type ii seesaw term given in equation ( [ type2b ] ) to study the survivability of the neutrino mass models .",
    ".input parameters and predictions for different parameters consistent with experiments using type i seesaw only [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table : results6 ]     as a function of @xmath39 in nh case for both charged lepton and up quark type @xmath17 as well as both types of maximal majorana cp phases ]     as a function of @xmath39 in nh case for both charged lepton and up quark type @xmath17 as well as both types of maximal majorana cp phases ]     as a function of @xmath39 in ih case for both charged lepton and up quark type @xmath17 as well as both types of maximal majorana cp phases ]     as a function of @xmath39 in ih case for both charged lepton and up quark type @xmath17 as well as both types of maximal majorana cp phases ]",
    "the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics , if extended by the inclusion of three right handed neutrinos which are singlet under the sm gauge group , can give rise to tiny neutrino mass by type i seesaw mechanism @xcite .",
    "alternatively , if the sm is extended by a scalar triplet , tiny neutrino mass can arise from type ii seesaw mechanism @xcite after the neutral component of the scalar triplet acquires a tiny vacuum expectation value .",
    "being singlets under the gauge group , the mass matrix of the right handed neutrinos can have off - diagonal terms as well .",
    "similarly , the gauge structure of the sm does not prevent off - diagonal dirac yukawa couplings .",
    "in other words both the dirac and right handed majorana mass matrices can be non - diagonal in general .",
    "however , throughout our analysis in the previous sections , we have restricted the dirac neutrino mass matrix to its diagonal form only .",
    "this can be achieved by incorporating additional symmetries ( global or local ) with family non - universal gauge charges so that off diagonal mass terms are not allowed . in this work ,",
    "we take up one such highly motivated extended symmetry : abelian gauge extension of the sm .",
    "it should be noted that although our analysis in the previous sections considered the type ii seesaw formula ( [ type2 ] ) for a general left - right symmetric model , here we outline a simpler extension of the standard model by an abelian gauged flavor symmetry to explain the desired form of the mass matrices .",
    "abelian gauge extension of standard model is one of the best motivating examples of beyond standard model physics . for a review see @xcite .",
    "such a model is also motivated within the framework of gut models , for example @xmath65 . the supersymmetric version of such models have an additional advantage in the sense that they provide a solution to the mssm ( minimal supersymmetric standard model ) @xmath66 problem .",
    "such abelian gauge extension of sm was studied recently in @xcite in the context of neutrino mass and cosmology .",
    "here we consider an extension of the standard model gauge group with one abelian @xmath67 gauge symmetry .",
    "thus , the model we propose here is an @xmath68 gauge theory with three chiral generations of sm and three additional right handed neutrinos .",
    "we will consider family non universal @xmath67 couplings .",
    "the fermion content of our model is @xmath69 @xmath70 where @xmath71 goes over the three generations of standard model and the numbers in the bracket correspond to the quantum number under the gauge group @xmath68 .",
    "the @xmath67 gauge quantum numbers should be such that they do not give rise to anomalies .",
    "we consider the following solution of the anomaly matching conditions @xmath72 @xmath73 in particular , if we choose @xmath74 , only the following types of dirac yukawa terms will be present in the lagrangian .",
    "@xmath75 where @xmath76 is the higgs field responsible for breaking electroweak symmetry and has the quantum numbers @xmath77 with respect to the gauge group . for the chosen abelian charges",
    ", two singlet higgs fields must exist @xmath78 to give rise to a general structure of the right handed neutrino mass matrix .",
    "one of these singlet fields @xmath79 ( after acquiring a non - zero vev ) also breaks the gauge symmetry @xmath68 to that of the standard model . also ,",
    "since the quarks have zero charges under the additional abelian symmetry , they continue to have usual ckm ( cabibbo kobayashi maskawa ) structure of mixing matrix .",
    "such a model can have rich phenomenology from collider as well as cosmology point of view .",
    "however , for the purpose of our current work , we outline this model just to explain one possible origin of the specific structure ( diagonal ) of dirac neutrino mass matrix @xmath17 used in the analysis .",
    "a more detailed investigation of such a model is left for future studies .",
    "analysis of the effect of majorana cp phases in case of quasi - degenerate neutrinos is done with contribution from both type i and type ii seesaw formula within the framework of tbm mixing .",
    "fitting the neutrino mass matrix with best fit oscillation and cosmology data , the right - handed neutrino mass matrix is calculated using type i seesaw formula only for both cl type and uq type dirac neutrino mass matrices . adding type ii seesaw term ( which arises in generic left - right symmetric models ) to the type i , the predictions for neutrino parameters are calculated .",
    "it is observed that for the minimal possible contribution of type ii seesaw term ( which corresponds to the value of the dimensionless parameter @xmath39 in type ii seesaw term of order 1 ) to the neutrino mass matrix , all the neutrino mass models can survive in nature except the fact that for uq type @xmath17 the predictions for @xmath80 has deviated slightly from the @xmath81 range of experimental data .",
    "apart from this exception , all other predicted values of the neutrino parameters are consistent with neutrino oscillation data . apart from neutrino oscillation data , these predictions are also within the limit of the cosmological upper bound @xmath82 . in view of above , the scenario of quasi - degenerate neutrinos can survive in nature within the framework of type i and type ii seesaw mechanism and hence can not be ruled out yet .",
    "however , here we stick to the tbm mixing framework and have not made any attempt to explain the non - zero @xmath7 as confirmed recently by several neutrino oscillation experiments . as an extension of this work",
    ", one can incorporate various corrections to @xmath83 to explain non - zero @xmath7 which we have left for future studies .",
