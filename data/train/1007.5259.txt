    "it is used to identify and track chemical compounds in biological tissues . while spontaneous emission is well understood for isolated emitters , emission from a system of emitters",
    "varies extensively with their interaction , depending on the state of nearby emitters and the surrounding media . only by understanding the role of interactions in light emission",
    "can the state reliably be determined .",
    "the process of the collective decay rate being coherently increased is known as superradiance @xcite , and has received renewed interest with the development of nanotechnologies @xcite . in quantum optics , superradiance can be used to create entanglement between atoms and light @xcite .",
    "entanglement within a superradiant system is also being used to understand phase transitions in quantum systems @xcite . for this reason there is strong interest in methods that affect the interactions in cooperative emission .    a simple method to influencing the interaction strength",
    "is to place the system near a metal interface that supports surface plasmon modes @xcite .",
    "surface plasmons are charge density waves confined to a very small region close to the interface .",
    "the field of surface plasmons are consequently very large .",
    "this effect has long been used in techniques such as surface enhanced raman spectroscopy @xcite . in quantum information science , surface plasmon modes on a nanowire",
    "are proposed to create single - photon sources and transistors @xcite and enhance the emission properties of light emitting diodes @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the coupling of emitters to surface plasmon modes allows the collective excitation of superradiant surface plasmons @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we show how superradiance and surface plasmons can be combined to increase the interaction strength between matter and light by several orders of magnitude .",
    "we consider emitters near a planar metal interface in the kretschmann configuration for attenuated total reflection @xcite , see fig .",

    "surface plasmons induce a greater coupling of radiation into the far - field for a certain direction ( the surface plamon resonance angle ) where the flux of radiation is two orders of magnitude larger @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the increased radiation energy density in the near field of surface plamons leads to a stronger coupling between different emitters @xcite so that superradiance is further increased .",

    "the distance between the emitters needs to be much smaller than the wavelength of the radiation .",
    "the field amplitudes of the emitters then interfere constructively so that the radiation intensity is increased by a factor of @xmath8 compared to a single emitter .",
    "furthermore , light emitted by one of the scatterers can induce stimulated emission for another scatterer so that the collective decay rate is enhanced by a factor of @xmath0 if all emitters are initially excited .",
    "these two defining properties of superradiant emission are consequences of phasing and radiation reaction which can occur both in classical and in quantum systems @xcite .",
    "radiation reaction is generally affected by any surrounding dielectric material . in particular ,",
    "when atom - sized dipolar emitters are placed within a wavelength of a metal interface , surface plasmons can be generated .",
    "surface plasmons consist of electromagnetic fields that accompany electron density oscillations ( the plasmon ) on the surface of a metal . because the surface plasmon is confined within a nm - sized region on the interface the electromagnetic field is concentrated .",
    "this concentration depends strongly on the geometry and the dielectric properties of the interface .",
    "because of the increased intensity of surface plasmon fields , an emitter reacts strongly with surface plasmon modes when placed near a metal film and the radiative properties of the emitter are significantly affected@xcite . in the following",
    "we will study in detail how surface plasmons affect superradiance of emitters near a planar interface .",
    "we consider the behavior of @xmath0 atomic dipoles that are located near a thin metallic interface that supports surface plasmon modes , see fig .",

    "this is because the green s function contains all information about the propagation of electromagnetic waves between two arbitrary points in the presence of the interface , which is necessary to analyze emitters at different positions .",
