    "* proof : * first consider the simpler case where @xmath84 , that is , every spin interacts , though perhaps very weakly , with every other spin .",
    "the spin operator product @xmath85 is equivalent to @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is an operator which permutes spins @xmath8 and @xmath9 , and @xmath88 is the identity operator .",
    "each completely symmetric state is an eigenstate of each permutation operator separately , and so its energy eigenvalue is simply the sum of the coefficients of the individual permutation operators in the hamiltonian : @xmath89 .",
    "if a state @xmath90 is not completely symmetric , however , there is by definition some permutation operator which does not leave this state invariant . in the special case under consideration , such a permutation has a nonzero coefficient in the hamiltonian , say @xmath91 .",
    "now , @xmath92 , hence the maximum expectation value of a permutation operator in a normalized state is unity , so that @xmath93 , since the @xmath11 are negative numbers .",

    "<S> systems of exchange - coupled spins are commonly used to model ferromagnets . </S>",
    "<S> the quantum correlations in such magnets are studied using tools from quantum information theory . </S>",
    "<S> isotropic ferromagnets are shown to possess a universal low - temperature density matrix which precludes entanglement between spins , and the mechanism of entanglement cancellation is investigated , revealing a core of states resistant to pairwise entanglement cancellation . </S>",
    "<S> numerical studies of one- , two- , and three - dimensional lattices as well as irregular geometries showed no entanglement in ferromagnets at any temperature or magnetic field strength .    </S>",
    "<S> quantum correlations are responsible for much of the challenge in understanding interacting many - body quantum systems , and it is therefore of fundamental importance to have quantitative knowledge of these correlations . </S>",
    "<S> progress in quantum information theory has led to the development of new measures of the inseparability of a quantum state , and in the last few years these measures have been used to assess the quantum correlations in diverse physical systems . </S>",
    "<S> concurrence @xcite is an especially useful metric for such studies because it can be applied to mixed as well as pure states . </S>",
    "<S> it therefore can be used to quantitate the thermal entanglement in a system at nonzero temperature . </S>",
    "<S> it can also be applied to evaluate the inseparablilty of an equal incoherent mixture of degenerate energy eigenstates . </S>",
    "<S> however , concurrence is defined only for a pair of qubits . since </S>",
    "<S> a qubit is formally equivalent to a spin-@xmath0 particle when only the spin degree of freedom of the latter is considered , this has led to several analyses of the thermal entanglement between a pair of interacting spin-@xmath0 particles . </S>",
    "<S> two - spin systems studied in this way include the @xmath1 @xcite , @xmath2 @xcite , and @xmath3 @xcite heisenberg models , the @xmath4-model @xcite , the @xmath5-model @xcite , the heisenberg - dzyaloshinski - moriya model @xcite , and the ising model @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> inseparability at zero and finite temperture has also been studied in two - spin subsystems of one - dimensional spin chains , including the @xmath1-chain @xcite , the @xmath5-chain @xcite , the ising chain @xcite , and the majumdar - ghosh chain @xcite , as well as in the ground state of quasi - one - dimensional spin ladders @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> this paper will examine quantum correlations in isotropic ferromagnets without restrictions on the geometry of the spins ( such as one - dimensionality or periodicity ) or on the range of the spin - spin interaction . a suitably general model of a magnet , which will be called the heisenberg spin graph , consists of @xmath6 spins coupled by exchange interactions with arbitrary range and strength . </S>",
    "<S> it is defined by the hamiltonian    @xmath7    this can be visualized as a graph with a spin-@xmath0 particle at each vertex , where the edge between spins @xmath8 and @xmath9 , representing the exchange interaction @xmath10 between the two spins , is weighted by the coupling constant @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> the summation runs over each pair of spins once . </S>",
    "<S> the operator @xmath12 is the spin operator associated with the spin at the @xmath8th vertex of the graph ; its cartesian components obey the usual angular momentum algebra . as a matter of notation , </S>",
    "<S> states in the @xmath13-dimensional hilbert space @xmath14 of the model are specified with respect to basis states of the form @xmath15 , where the listed spins @xmath16 are aligned in the @xmath17-direction ( ` up ' ) and the remaining spins are antiparallel ( ` down ' ) . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath18 denotes the state with all spins down . </S>",
    "<S> one might anticipate that the heisenberg spin graph would be so general a model that nothing much could be said about it . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that when the coupling constants @xmath11 are nonpositive ( that is , ferromagnetic ) , certain features of heisenberg spin graphs are universal , in the sense that they do not depend on the exact values of the coupling constants or even on the number of spins . </S>",
    "<S> this universality allows a complete analysis of low - temperature correlations in such ferromagnets .    </S>",
    "<S> because the heisenberg spin graph hamiltonian @xmath19 commutes with the total @xmath20-spin operator @xmath21 , the two - qubit reduced density matrix for any two spins in an eigenstate of @xmath19 always takes the restricted form    @xmath22    for such a density matrix , the concurrence is @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> concurrence ranges from zero , for a separable state , to one , for a maximally entangled state . </S>",
    "<S> the entanglement of formation , another important entanglement measure , can be calculated directly from the concurrence , and is monotonically related to it . </S>",
    "<S> the method of calculating the concurrence for more general density matrices can be found in wootters @xcite .    in ref .   </S>",
    "<S> the authors have reported the absence of thermal and magnetic entanglement in the ferromagnetic heisenberg spin chain , based on the analytical solution of the @xmath24 case and numerical studies of @xmath25 chains . </S>",
    "<S> the following argument shows that the absence of thermal entanglement , at least at low temperatures , is a general feature of exchange - coupled ferromagnets , irrespective of the range of the exchange interactions , the dimensionality of the solid , or the precise boundary conditions ( free or periodic ) , even in the presence of inhomogeneous coupling strengths . </S>",
    "<S> consider the ferromagnetic heisenberg spin graph hamiltonian for @xmath6 spins : @xmath26 , where @xmath27 . because the exchange interaction can be rewritten in terms of a permutation operator and the identity operator as @xmath28 </S>",
    "<S> , the @xmath29 completely symmetric states    @xmath30    are eigenstates of @xmath19 with the common eigenvalue @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> these states span the ground subspace of the model ; there are no ` accidental ' degeneracies ( see appendix ) . at sufficiently low temperature , </S>",
    "<S> the thermal density matrix is an incoherent mixture of these @xmath29 states , the contribution from other states being negligible .    </S>",
    "<S> we choose any two spins in the solid and trace out the rest . because of the linearity of the partial trace </S>",
    "<S> , we can perform the trace on each of the completely symmetric states separately . </S>",
    "<S> the total reduced density matrix @xmath32 will then be    @xmath33    where @xmath34 , the reduced density matrix of the @xmath35th completely symmetric state , has the form :    @xmath36    from combinatoric reasoning we have    @xmath37    for the components of the density matrix @xmath34 .    </S>",
    "<S> carrying out the summation we find that the ground state density matrix is    @xmath38    thus the low temperature density matrix for any two spins assumes a universal form , irrespective of the strength , geometry , or homogeneity of the interactions or the dimensionality of the solid . </S>",
    "<S> the concurrence of this universal density matrix is zero . </S>",
    "<S> this shows that , at least at low temperatures , no two qubits in an isotropic ferromagnet share any entanglement . </S>",
    "<S> the correlations present , such as @xmath39 , can be regarded as purely classical .    </S>",
    "<S> the form of the reduced density matrix given in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ ferromagneticdm ] ) is of course strictly valid only in the limit of zero temperature . as the temperature @xmath40 increases , the remaining eigenstates of @xmath19 ( those not listed in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ symmetric states ] ) ) begin to contribute to the reduced density matrix @xmath32 describing the state of the two chosen spins . </S>",
    "<S> as there are a finite number of such states , it can be seen that the elements @xmath41 , of the reduced density matrix are continuous functions of @xmath40 . since at zero temperature @xmath42 </S>",
    "<S> , there must be some ( possibly infinite ) temperature interval , with @xmath43 as one endpoint and closed if the interval is finite , in which the concurrence is zero . </S>",
    "<S> thus the onset of entanglement in ferromagnets , if it occurs at all , happens as a phase transition at nonzero temperature .     _ </S>",
    "<S> ( upper curve ) _ , eq .  [ symmetric state concurrence ] , and of the pairwise mixed symmetric state @xmath44 ( _ lower curve _ ) , eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ pairwise mixed concurrence ] , for @xmath45 . ]    </S>",
    "<S> note that , individually , each @xmath34 is an inseparable state , except for @xmath46 and @xmath47 , with concurrence    @xmath48    it is the incoherent mixing of these inseparable states that washes out the quantum correlations . </S>",
    "<S> one might anticipate that this entanglement cancellation occurs pairwise , between states related by flipping the orientation of each spin , so that @xmath49 would be separable ; only the entanglement of @xmath50 when @xmath6 is even could not be eliminated in this way . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , this is not _ </S>",
    "<S> quite _ correct . </S>",
    "<S> rather , there are threshold values of @xmath35 at @xmath51 , below and above which pairwise cancellation occurs , but between which two - state mixing can not account for the loss of entanglement . </S>",
    "<S> analytically ,    @xmath52    with maximal entanglement of @xmath53 occuring at @xmath54 ( @xmath6 even ) or of @xmath55 at @xmath56 ( @xmath6 odd ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus it is the _ </S>",
    "<S> least _ entangled states which are most resistent to pairwise entanglement cancellation , as illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figure1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> further , the lack of quantum correlations in the ground subspace can not be explained by incoherent mixing of the states within the zone @xmath57 among themselves @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is already apparent from consideration of the @xmath24 and @xmath58 cases , where @xmath59 and @xmath60 respectively have no other states in their zones with which to mix . </S>",
    "<S> but it remains true at @xmath61 , where mixing of @xmath60 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 results in an inseparable state ( @xmath64 ) . </S>",
    "<S> as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figure2 ] , the concurrence of the incoherent mixture of the states within this zone decays as @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> the separability of the degenerate ground state therefore arises from the mixing of this inseparable core with the surrounding sea of pairwise - separable states .     as a function of @xmath6 . within this zone pairwise entanglement cancellation fails . </S>",
    "<S> the curve @xmath55 ( _ dashed _ ) is shown for comparison . ]    </S>",
    "<S> whether any isotropic ferromagnet can become entangled at any temperature remains an open question . </S>",
    "<S> it seems unlikely . </S>",
    "<S> if the first excited state is nondegenerate , or nearly so , then it will change the low - temperature density matrix @xmath32 ( eq .  [ def : sumdm ] ) by terms of order @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the energy difference between the ground and first excited state . </S>",
    "<S> such changes can be seen to be too small to result in an inseparable state , by considering the extreme case where the reduced density matrix for the excited state is a perfectly entangled triplet state . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> if the first excited state is highly degenerate ( as in the heisenberg spin chain , for example ) , or if there are many closely spaced levels just above the first excited state , then the thermal correction can be of order @xmath68 , but in this case one expects that incoherent mixing among the degenerate ( or almost degenerate ) excited states will result in a separable state , as occurred when the degenerate ground states mixed . in either case , there appears to be no way to form an inseparable thermal state .    </S>",
    "<S> since the obstacle to thermal entanglement seems to be the highly degenerate ground state , it is natural to wonder if the application of an external magnetic field would induce entanglement by relieving the degeneracy . to study this question , </S>",
    "<S> a simple extension of a model introduced by majumdar and ghosh @xcite , defined by the hamiltonian    @xmath69    was studied numerically . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath70 is a homogeneous external magnetic field directed along the @xmath17-axis , and periodic boundary conditions are assumed , so that @xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath72 are coupling constants , determining the strength of the interaction of a spin with its @xmath8th nearest neighbor . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath73 the model reduces to the majumdar - ghosh spin chain ; if @xmath74 as well , then it is the heisenberg spin chain @xcite . without loss of generality </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian can be rescaled so that @xmath75 for a ferromagnetic chain </S>",
    "<S> . concurrences were calculated numerically for each qubit pair in spin chains of lengths @xmath58 through @xmath76 . </S>",
    "<S> the coupling constants @xmath77 and @xmath78 were varied between @xmath79 and @xmath80 , while the temperature and magnetic field were varied between @xmath80 and @xmath6 . in no case did any qubit pair exhibit any entanglement . </S>",
    "<S> similar numerical studies of other geometries were also carried out , including open spin chains ( i.e. without periodic boundary conditions ) , nine spins arrranged as a @xmath81 grid with and without periodic boundary conditions , eight spins arranged as a cube , and several irregular geometries . </S>",
    "<S> these calculations also failed to reveal any entanglement between any qubit pair . </S>",
    "<S> thus it appears reasonable to conjecture that ferromagnets can not exhibit thermal entanglement at any temperature or applied field strength .    </S>",
    "<S> this paper has examined the quantum correlations present in isotropic ferromagnets . </S>",
    "<S> the ground subspace of an isotropic ferromagnet is spanned by the completely symmetric states , and it was proven that no other states intrude . as a result , the low - temperature two - spin reduced density matrix assumes a universal , separable form . </S>",
    "<S> pairwise entanglement cancellation can not entirely account for this separability , as there exists a core of states which remain inseparable even when mixed incoherently among themselves . </S>",
    "<S> numerical evidence was provided supporting the conjecture that isotropic ferromagnetic spin systems do not exhibit thermal entanglement , even in the presence of an external magnetic field .    </S>",
    "<S> in fact , universality in the entanglement behavior of magnets is even more general than described here . </S>",
    "<S> although anisotropic deformations of the exchange interaction can modify the structure of the ground subspace in several ways , universal behavior does reappear at low temperature even in anisotropic models . </S>",
    "<S> this will be discussed in detail in a subsequent paper .    </S>",
