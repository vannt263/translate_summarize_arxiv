    "it is well known that quantized sound waves , whose excitations are phonons , share several properties with relativistic quantum fields , such as the electromagnetic field . here",
    "we will be primarily concerned with fluctuations in the phonon ground state .",
    "these fluctuations can share certain features with electromagnetic vacuum fluctuations , including the creation of casimir - type forces  @xcite .",
    "the forces due to quantum or stochastic sound fluctuations have been discussed recently by several authors  @xcite . in this paper , we will study quantum density fluctuations in a fluid .",
    "the fluid in question could be either a classical or a quantum fluid , but we will consider only the regime where the dispersion relation is approximately linear .",
    "thus the analog models which we consider are rather different than those which model the hawking process  @xcite .",
    "the topic of hydrodynamic fluctuations has been reviewed , for example , in refs .",
    "@xcite . in sec .",
    "[ sec : nobound ] , we will discuss density fluctuations in a fluid in the phonon ground state without boundaries , and summarize work recently reported in ref .",
    "it was argued there that light scattering by quantum density fluctuations might be observable , even in fluids at room temperature .",
    "the effects of a squeezed state of phonons will be briefly discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : squeezed ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec : bound ] , we turn to the issue of the effects of boundaries in the fluid , and argue that this can be a useful analog model for the effects of boundaries on relativistic quantum fields .",
    "we also suggest that the boundary effects , at least in principle , create observable effects in the fluid case .",
    "we report on the result of several specific calculations for different geometries .",
    "the results will be summarized and discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : final ] .",
    "we consider the quantization of sound waves in a fluid with a linear dispersion relation , @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the phonon angular frequency , @xmath2 is the magnitude of the wave vector , and @xmath3 is the speed of sound in the fluid .",
    "this should be a good approximation for wavelengths much longer than the interatomic separation .",
    "let @xmath4 be the mean mass density of the fluid .",
    "then the variation in density around this mean value is represented by a quantum operator , @xmath5 , which may be expanded in terms of phonon annihilation and creation operators as  @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 here @xmath8 is a quantization volume .",
    "the normalization factor in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mode_fnt ] ) can be fixed by requiring that the zero point energy of each mode be @xmath9 and using the expression for the energy density in a sound wave , @xmath10 in the limit in which @xmath11 , we may write the density correlation function as @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 . the integral",
    "may be evaluated to write the coordinate space correlation function as @xmath15    this is of the same form as the correlation function for the time derivative of a massless scalar field in relativistic quantum field theory , @xmath16 .",
    "( this analogy has been noted previously in the literature .",
    "see , for example , ref .",
    "apart from a factor of @xmath4 , these two quantities may be obtained from one another by interchanging the speed of light @xmath17 and the speed of sound @xmath3 .",
    "if @xmath18 , then @xmath19    in the limit of equal times , the density correlation function becomes @xmath20 thus the density fluctuations increase as @xmath21 decreases .",
    "of course , the continuum description of the fluid and the linear dispersion relation both fail as @xmath21 approaches the interatomic separation .",
    "also note the minus sign in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rho = t ] ) .",
    "this implies that density fluctuations at different locations at equal times are anticorrelated .",
    "by contrast , when @xmath22 , then @xmath23 and the fluctuations are positively correlated .",
    "this is complete analogy with the situation in the relativistic theory .",
    "fluctuations inside the lightcone can propagate causally and tend to be positively correlated .",
    "fluctuations in a fluid for which @xmath24 can not have propagated from one point to the other , and are anti - correlated .",
    "this can be understood physically because an over density of fluid at one point in space requires an under density at a nearby point .      in ref .",
    "@xcite , the cross section for the scattering of light by the zero point density fluctuations is computed for the case that the incident light angular frequency is large compared to the typical phonon frequency .",
    "the result is @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the scattering angle , @xmath27 is the scattering volume , and @xmath28 is the mean index of refraction of the fluid .",
    "the @xmath29 dependence of the scattering cross section can be viewed as the product of the @xmath30 dependence of rayleigh - brillouin scattering and one power of @xmath1 , and hence of @xmath31 , coming from the spectrum of zero point fluctuations in the fluid .",
    "the factor of @xmath32 represents the influence of the fluid on light propagation before and after the scattering process , and arises as a product of a factor of @xmath28 in the incident flux and a factor of @xmath33 in the density of final states  @xcite . because light travels through the fluid at speeds much greater than the sound speed , light scattering reveals a nearly static distribution of density fluctuations .",
    "thus we can regard eq .",
    "( [ eq : cross_zp2 ] ) as a probe of the fluctuations described by eq .",
    "( [ eq : rho = t ] ) .",
    "the scattering by zero point fluctuations is inelastic , with the creation of a phonon .",
    "thus , the scattering described by eq .",
    "( [ eq : cross_zp2 ] ) is strictly brillouin rather than rayleigh scattering .",
    "this scattering by zero point density fluctuations should be compared to the effects of thermal density fluctuations .",
    "the ratio of the zero point to the thermal scattering can be expressed as @xmath34^{-2}\\,.\\ ] ] the index of refraction , @xmath28 , and the quantity @xmath35 , which involves a derivative of the fluid dielectric function with respect to density at constant entropy are both of order unity . hence @xmath36 is primarily determined by the ratio of the photon energy to the thermal energy , and the ratio of the speed of sound to the speed of light .",
    "as an example , consider the case of water at room temperature and violet light with a wavelength of @xmath37 . in this case",
    ", we have @xmath38 and @xmath39  @xcite .",
    "in addition , @xmath40  @xcite . for back scattering ,",
    "@xmath41 , this leads to @xmath42 . consequently , about @xmath43 of the stokes line is due to zero point motion effects .",
    "although this is a small fraction , it may be detectable , and will increase at lower temperatures and shorter wavelengths .",
    "now we consider the case where the phonon field is not in the vacuum state , but rather a squeezed state .",
    "the squeezed states are a two complex parameter family of states , but we will focus attention on the case of the squeezed vacuum states @xmath44 , labeled by a single complex squeeze parameter @xmath45 this set of states is of special interest because they are the states generated by quantum particle creation processes , and they can exhibit local negative energy densities . consider the shift in the mean squared density fluctuations between the given state and the vacuum @xmath46 the `` renormalized '' mean squared density fluctuation .",
    "the result for this quantity in a single mode squeezed vacuum state for a plane wave in the @xmath47-direction is @xmath48 \\right\\}\\,.\\ ] ] note that this quantity can be either positive or negative , but its time or space average is positive .",
    "the suppression of the local density fluctuations in a squeezed state is analogous to the creation of negative energy densities for a massless , relativistic field .",
    "if we introduce an impenetrable boundary into the fluid , the phonon field will satisfy neumann boundary conditions @xmath49 as a consequence of the impenetrability .",
    "thus there will be a casimir force on the boundaries which is analogous to the casimir force produced by electromagnetic vacuum effects .",
    "for example , consider two parallel plates , which will experience an attractive force per unit area of @xmath50 which is smaller than the electromagnetic case for perfect plates by a factor of @xmath51 , and is thus quite small in any realistic situation .    henceforth , we consider the local effect of boundaries on mean squared density fluctuations , and now define @xmath52 to be the change due to the presence of the boundary .",
    "this quantity is of interest both as an analog model for the effects of boundaries in quantum field theory , and in its own right .",
    "the shifts in density fluctuations are at least in principle observable in light scattering experiments .",
    "our interest in the phononic analog model is inspired by the fact that the study of boundary effects in quantum field theory is an active area of research , and has given rise to some recent controversies in the literature  @xcite .",
    "one question is the nature of the physical cutoff which prevents singularities at the boundary .",
    "an example of the subtleties is afforded by the mean squared electric and magnetic fields near a dielectric interface . when the material is a perfect conductor , these quantities are proportional to @xmath53 , where @xmath47 is the distance to the interface .",
    "specifically , in lorentz - heaviside units their asymptotic forms are @xmath54 and @xmath55 one might expect that a realistic frequency dependent dielectric function would remove this singularity , but this is not the case .",
    "instead one finds  @xcite that @xmath56 and @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the plasma frequency of the material .",
    "thus some physical cutoff other than dispersion is required . for realistic materials ,",
    "it is likely to be surface roughness , but fluctuations in the position of the boundary can also serve as a cutoff , as we showed several years ago  @xcite . in a fluid , there is always a physical cutoff at the interatomic separation , but in a given situation other physical cutoffs may be dominant . for the present , we will report the results of calculations of @xmath52 for several different geometries , and leave a more detailed treatment of physical cutoffs for later work .    in the remainder of this section , we will quote several results for @xmath52 in different geometries .",
    "the details of the calculations involved will be presented in a later paper  @xcite .      in both of these case , the renormalized density two - point function may be constructed by the method of images . for the case of a single plane",
    ", one finds @xmath59 where @xmath47 is the distance to the boundary . for the case of two parallel planes ,",
    "the result is @xmath60\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath61 is the separation of the two planes , and @xmath47 is the distance to one boundary .",
    "note that both of these expression are negative everywhere . in the absence of a physical cutoff , both of these expressions diverge as @xmath53 near the boundaries , just as do the squared electric and magnetic fields near a perfectly reflecting plane .      here",
    "we consider a rectangular box with periodic boundary conditions in all three spatial directions , with periodicity lengths @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "thus the three - dimensional space has the topology of @xmath65 .",
    "this is closely related to the geometry of a waveguide , where the fluctuations of a relativistic scalar field were discussed by rodrigues and svaiter  @xcite . as in the parallel plane case ,",
    "an image sum method may be employed , with the result @xmath66 here the prime on the summation indices denotes that the @xmath67 term is omitted . here",
    "@xmath52 is a negative constant .",
    "consider two intersecting plane which are at an angle of @xmath68 with respect to each other . now consider a point inside of this wedge which is located at polar coordinates @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the distance to the intersection line and @xmath71 .",
    "this geometry was treated for the relativistic case by candelas and deutsch  @xcite , and we may transcript one of their results [ their eq .",

    "as is well known , the space surrounding a cosmic string is a conical space with a deficit angle @xmath73 .",
    "quantum field theory in this conical space has been discussed by many authors , beginning with helliwell and konkowski  @xcite , and is similar to the wedge problem discussed above .",
    "we may follow the procedure in ref .",
    "@xcite . at a distance @xmath70 from the apex , we find @xmath74 which is also negative everywhere .",
    "the quantization of the electromagnetic field in the presence of a parabolic mirror was discussed by us in refs .",
    "@xcite , where a geometric optics approximation was employed to find the mean squared fields near the focus .",
    "this treatment lead to the result that these quantities are singular at the focus , diverging as an inverse power of the distance @xmath61 to the focus .",
    "this result holds both for parabolic cylinders and for parabolas of revolution , and basically arises from the interference term of multiply reflected rays with nearly the same optical path length .",
    "the geometry is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : para ] .",
    "an incoming ray at an angle of @xmath26 reflects at an angle of @xmath75 to reach the point @xmath76 , which is a distance @xmath61 from the focus @xmath77 , as illustrated .",
    "the distance from the focus to the mirror itself is @xmath78 .",
    "there can be two values of @xmath75 , denoted @xmath68 and @xmath79 , corresponding to two reflected rays .",
    "the difference in the optical paths of these two rays is denoted by @xmath80 .    the detailed expression for this distance @xmath80 used in refs .",
    "@xcite is not quite correct , as was pointed out to us by vuletic  @xcite .",
    "the corrected expression is @xmath81\\,.\\ ] ] this is to be used in the expression obtained from geometric optics , @xmath82 in this expression , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 , as will be discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .    a detailed discussion of the electromagnetic case will be given elsewhere .",
    "here we are concerned with @xmath85 , which is obtained from eq .",
    "( [ eq : e2 ] ) by letting @xmath18 and dividing by @xmath86 , leading to a result of the form @xmath87 this , and the analogous expressions for @xmath88 and @xmath89 , which also are proportional to @xmath90 , are striking in that they can be large when the focus is far from the mirror itself , @xmath91 .",
    "this result is controversial , and seems to be in conflict with a general result by fewster and pfenning  @xcite , which implies that quantities such as @xmath88 or @xmath85 should be proportional to the inverse fourth power of the distance to the mirror , which is to say @xmath92 in this case .",
    "on the other hand , there is a simple physical argument to the contrary in this case , which we find compelling : the interference term between multiply reflected rays is slowly oscillating when @xmath93 is small , and should give a contribution proportional to an inverse power of @xmath61 , as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : near_focus ] ) . in any case",
    ", the study of the phononic case provides an additional theoretical , and potentially experimental , probe to better understand this issue .",
