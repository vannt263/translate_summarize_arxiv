    "the set of transition pathways harvested in the course of tps iterations shows a quick departure of the trajectory regime from the collective motion inherited from the geometrical modeling .",
    "the graphite - diamond trajectories underwent three drastic shifts in the transition regime .",

    "<S> transition barriers can be computed and bottlenecks identified with ( stationary ) saddle points representing transition states on the potential energy surface @xcite . in complex systems with very rugged energy landscapes , saddle points cease to be characteristic points of the free energy barrier @xcite . the latter barrier encompasses a large set of configurations and the associated relevant degrees of freedom are very difficult to anticipate @xcite . to overcome this problem , we can use transition path sampling , a method based on collecting ensembles of dynamical trajectories @xcite . </S>"
