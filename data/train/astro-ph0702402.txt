    "the study of pulsars showing systematic subpulse drift patterns provides important clues for the understanding of the unsolved problem of pulsar emission mechanism .",
    "constraints provided by such observations can have far reaching implications for the theoretical models , as exemplified by some of the recent results in this area ( e.g. @xcite and ) . in this context ,",
    "pulsars with wide profiles @xmath0 interpreted as , emission coming from one magnetic pole of a highly aligned pulsar ( pulsar with the magnetic axis almost parallel to the rotation axis ) @xmath0 can provide extra insights because of the presence of multiple drift bands , as illustrated in the recent studies of b0826@xmath034 ( and @xcite ) and b0815@xmath809 ( @xcite ) .    b0818@xmath041 is a relatively less studied wide profile pulsar with emission occurring for more than 180of pulse longitude .",
    "discovered during the second molonglo pulsar survey ( @xcite ) , it has a period of 0.545 @xmath9 and is relatively old , with a characteristic age of @xmath10 years .",
    "the inferred dipolar magnetic field of this pulsar is @xmath11 g , which is a typical value for slow pulsars . from a study of its average polarization behaviour at 660 and 1440 mhz ,",
    "@xcite predict that the pulsar must have a small inclination angle between the magnetic and rotation axes .",
    "we have carried out high sensitivity gmrt observations of b0818@xmath041 , which bring out a unique pattern of subpulse drift , which is hitherto not reported .",
    "the main results from our initial observations and the interpretations thereof are reported in this paper .",
    "we observed b0818@xmath041 at 325 mhz , on 24th february , 2003 at the gmrt , using the phased array mode ( @xcite ) .",
    "the raw data were recorded with 0.512 msec sampling interval . during the offline analysis we further integrated the raw data to achieve the final time resolution of 2.048 msec .",
    "the duration of the observations was about 31 minutes ( i.e. 3414 pulses ) .",
    "41 at 325 mhz , with the average profile shown on top .",
    "signatures of radio frequency interference are present around pulse number 220 , 298 , 338 and 397.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    41 at 325 mhz , with the average profile shown on the top .",
    "signatures of radio frequency interference are present around pulse number 625 , 720 , 790 and 815.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    the raw data were first dedispersed ( with a dm value equal to 113.4 @xmath12 ) and then bad data points were filtered out from the dedispersed data . the final average pulse profile , illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : avg_prof ] , was obtained by synchronous folding of this data with the doppler corrected pulsar period .",
    "it shows a fairly steep sided and double peaked structure .",
    "the two components of the double peaked profile are separated by 86.6@xmath130.3and are joined by a saddle region .",
    "single pulse sequences from our data reveal an interesting pattern of drifting .",
    "[ fig : sp_200_400 ] shows a typical drift pattern over a sequence of 200 pulses .",
    "we see three different drift regions with two different drift rates @xmath0 an inner region with steeper apparent drift rate flanked on each side by a region of slower apparent drift rate .",
    "multiple drift bands ( typically 3 to 4 ) can be seen in the inner region for any single pulse , whereas the outer regions show only a single drift band .",
    "though the regular drift patterns seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : sp_200_400 ] are quite common in our entire 3414 pulse sequence , there are regions of disturbed drifting , as well as significant sections of nulls .",
    "an illustrative 300 pulse sequence of this kind is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sp_600_900 ] .",
    "changes in drift rate , including curved drift bands ( e.g. pulse # 720 to pulse # 780 ) are seen clearly . in this context",
    "this pulsar behaves similar to b0826@xmath034 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : sp_600_900 ] some instances of the pulsar in null state are also seen @xmath0 pulse sequences , 647 to 687 , 693 to 705 and 780 to 835 .",
    "we note that the inner and the outer drift regions are quite closely spaced with almost no discontinuity between the drift bands of the two region .",
    "furthermore , the two drift regions are clearly locked to each other in phase @xmath0 the subpulse emission from the inner drift region is in phase with that from the outer drift region on the right side , and at the same time the emission in inner drift region is out of phase with the outer drift region situated on the left side .",
    "this phase locked relationship ( hereafter plr ) is maintained for the entire stretch of the data and does not appear to get perturbed after intermittent nulling or during changes in the drift rate .",
    "we can characterise the observed drift pattern by estimating @xmath14 ( the measured time interval between the recurrence of successive drift bands at a given pulse longitude ) and @xmath15 ( the measured longitude separation between two adjacent drift bands ) . in practice ,",
    "the @xmath14 and @xmath15 values need not correspond to the true values ( @xmath16 and @xmath17 ) @xmath0 see @xcite .",
    "to determine @xmath18 , we use the fluctuation spectrum analysis technique ( @xcite ) .",
    "[ fig : flusp_full ] shows the phase resolved fluctuation spectrum for the 200 pulse sequence of fig .",
    "[ fig : sp_200_400 ] .",
    "there is one strong peak at @xmath19 ( where @xmath20 is the period of the pulsar ) .",
    "this feature is identified as @xmath21 and the error bar in @xmath18 is proportional to the reciprocal of the total length of the pulse sequence .",
    "[ fig : flusp_inner ] shows the fluctuation spectrum for the inner drift region for the same pulse sequence .",
    "the @xmath14 is found to be the same for both the inner and the outer drift regions , which is expected given the plr .",
    "the @xmath15 value for the inner drift region is calculated from the auto correlation function of the single pulses , averaged over the total number of pulses .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ccf ] , where the secondary peak is due to the correlation between the adjacent drift bands and the corresponding @xmath15 value is 17.5@xmath131.3 . because of the fact that one is not seeing simultaneous multiple subpulses from the outer drift region , @xmath15 for this region can not be estimated using the correlation analysis method .",
    "rough estimation of @xmath15 value for the outer region @xmath0 obtained from the slope of the drift bands in this region @xmath0 is around 28 .",
    "thus although the @xmath18 values are the same , the @xmath22 values are significantly different for the two drift regions .",
    "we interpret our observations and analysis results within the frame work of @xcite model and improved versions of the same ( e.g. @xcite and the references therein ) . according to these ,",
    "subpulse drifting is produced from a system of sub - beams ( subpulse associated plasma columns ) .",
    "sparks ( sparking discharges within the vacuum gap ) , rotating around the magnetic axis under the action of an e x b drift , gives rise to a circulating pattern of sub - beams , and the time for one full circulation is referred to as the carousel rotation period , which we designate as @xmath6 . as pulsar radiation beams are widely believed to be arranged in concentric cones , it it natural to expect the circulating sparks to be distributed in annular rings on the polar cap ( e.g. @xcite ) , each ring giving rise to one cone in the nested cones of emission . to confirm and support our interpretations ,",
    "we have carried out simulations of the expected radiation pattern for this pulsar .",
    "these are described at the end of this section , but their results are alluded to at the different stages of our interpretation , which are as follows .",
    "\\(1 ) the possibility that the observed drift pattern could be produced from sparks circulating in one ring can be ruled out on the basis of the large difference in @xmath22 values and the pattern of intensity distribution between the drift regions .",
    "a simple interpretation of the observed drift pattern is that the inner saddle region corresponds to an inner conal ring that is somewhat tangentially grazed by the observer s line of sight ( los ) , while the outer drift regions are produced by the intersection of the los with an outer conal ring .",
    "the simulation results show that the inner drift region can be produced by the intersection of the los with three / four neighbouring sparks of the inner ring , whereas the outer drift region can be created by the intersection of the los with one spark of the outer ring , on each side of the inner ring .",
    "\\(2 ) the closely spaced inner and outer drift regions can be explained with a rapid transition of the los from one ring to the other . for the inner los geometry ( negative @xmath23 ) , the los traverses the region between the inner and the outer region almost perpendicularly and as a consequence one can achieve quite closely spaced drift regions with reasonably well separated rings of emission .",
    "this is borne out by the simulation results ( see fig . [",
    "fig : sim ] ) .",
    "\\(3 ) the observed plr implies that the apparent angular drift rate is the same for both the inner and the outer rings .",
    "this can be achieved with two possibilities : different parts of polar cap plasma rotating at the same rate ( i.e. the rotation is quasi - rigid ) , or different parts of the polar cap plasma circulating with different speeds which are fine tuned to maintain the apparent plr .",
    "we do not see a natural way to achieve the later and hence , we suggest that the carousel rotation period , @xmath6 , and the number of sparks , @xmath7 , are the same for both the inner and the outer ring . the simulations with two rings of emission with same @xmath6 and @xmath7 , with 180out of phase emission between the rings , successfully reproduces the plr .",
    "\\(4 ) what are the likely values for @xmath7 , @xmath24 ( and hence @xmath6 ) , for this pulsar ? to start with , we note that for a los grazing the inner ring , the @xmath22 is expected to be close to @xmath25 .",
    "so , @xmath26 .",
    "now , for @xmath24 , there are two possibilities : ( i ) the @xmath18 represents an unaliased true drift rate i.e. , in successive pulses , the observer sees the same spark , shifted to a nearby longitude . in this case ,",
    "@xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "( ii ) the @xmath18 is an aliased version of @xmath24 i.e. , in successive pulses , a given spark drifts by an amount very close to the separation between adjacent sparks ( or a multiple thereof , depending on the order of the aliasing ) . as shown by @xcite , under the effect of aliasing , @xmath24 and @xmath18",
    "are related as , @xmath29 where @xmath30 $ ] and @xmath31 depend on the alias order , @xmath32 .",
    "note that we observe a negative drift rate for this pulsar .",
    "for an inner los geometry , this can happen for the case of an unaliased drift ( as in case ( i ) above ) @xmath0 the exb drift of the spark plasma is slower than the rotation of the star ( @xcite ) .",
    "for an aliased drift , this can happen when @xmath33 ( i.e @xmath34 .",
    "taking the case for the lowest possible alias order ( @xmath35 ) , and using @xmath36 , we obtain @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "this leads to the interesting result that the carousel rotation rate is the same as the measured @xmath18 . for this scenario ,",
    "the entire spark pattern rotates with an angular velocity of @xmath39 .    , @xmath40 ; drift rate@xmath41.,scaledwidth=44.0% ]    to confirm these interpretations , we simulate the radiation from b0818@xmath041 using the method described in @xcite .",
    "the goal of the simulations is to reproduce the following observed properties : ( i ) width of the pulse profile , ( ii ) the relative intensities of the drift regions and ( iii ) the overall pattern of drifting . based on our interpretation",
    ", we use 19 equi - spaced sparks in each of 2 concentric rings , rotating with a drift rate of @xmath42 .",
    "the other free parameters in the simulations are the angle between the magnetic and rotation axes ( @xmath43 ) , the angle between the magnetic axis and the los ( @xmath23 ) , the radii of the rings , the sizes and relative intensities of the sparks .",
    "we note that the presence of closely spaced drift regions with widely different @xmath22 values , and our inference that the los intersects only one spark from the outer ring , all favour an inner los geometry ( negative @xmath23 ) over an outer los geometry ( positive @xmath23 ) .    for an inner geometry",
    ", we find satisfactory results for a fairly narrow range of values of @xmath43 , @xmath23 : roughly from @xmath44and @xmath45to @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "[ fig : sim ] shows a typical simulation result , for the case of @xmath48and @xmath40 .",
    "here , the radius of the outer ring is 0.8 @xmath49 and the inner ring is 0.6 @xmath49 ( @xmath49 being the polar cap radius ) .",
    "as can be seen , most of the observed features of the average profile and the drift bands are well reproduced , including the significant change of @xmath22 between the inner and the outer drift regions , which is clearly a geometrical effect .",
    "interestingly , a 180phase shift between the spark locations on the inner and outer rings is needed to match the plr of the observed drift pattern ( see fig . [",
    "fig : sp_200_400 ] ) . for an outer los geometry ,",
    "typical best fit results are for @xmath50and @xmath51 . in this case",
    ", we find that for any reasonable geometry , ( i ) to reproduce the closely spaced inner and outer drift regions , the radial separation between the two rings needs to be rather small ( 0.72 and 0.82 @xmath49 ) ; ( ii ) to reproduce the observed @xmath22 in the inner region ( with the observed profile width ) , the sizes of the sparks need to be very small ; ( iii ) furthermore , the wide difference in @xmath22 values of the two regions is difficult to reproduce accurately .    finally , to investigate the relationship between @xmath6 and @xmath18 , simulations have been tried using sparks of unequal intensities to bring out the presence of @xmath6 explicitly in the fluctuation spectrum",
    ". different values of @xmath6 are achieved by using slightly different values of the drift rate . in the general case",
    ", two different features can be seen in the spectrum , corresponding to @xmath18 ( caused by periodic drifting features ) and @xmath6 ( caused by the amplitude modulation due to the unequal sparks ) . for the appropriate choice of drift rate ( equal to 20/@xmath20 )",
    ", these two features merge / overlap in the spectrum to produce the measured @xmath18 signal . for the real data",
    ", we believe that if the @xmath6 is present in the spectrum , it is co - located with the aliased @xmath2 signal , at @xmath18 .",
    "the remarkable subpulse drift pattern of b0818@xmath041 can be interpreted as being due to an unaliased drift with a @xmath52 , or an aliased drift with @xmath53 .",
    "we believe that the latter is a more likely scenario for this pulsar .",
    "an unaliased drift can not explain the occurrence of longitude stationary sub - pulses and sense reversal of the drift rate that is seen in our data .",
    "for an aliased drift rate , this can be explained by small variations of the drift rate that move the @xmath2 across the nearest nyquist boundary ( @xcite ) . though it is rare for the signature of carousel rotation period to be directly present as a low frequency feature in the fluctuation spectrum , we note that this has been claimed for at least two other cases : b0834 + 06 ( @xcite ) and b0943@xmath810 in q mode ( @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "it is interesting to compare our results with the theoretical models for @xmath54 drift , such as that given by @xcite . according to their equations ( 12 ) and ( 13 ) , the complexity parameter @xmath55 ( which can be represented as @xmath56 , with @xmath57 being the putative number of cones ) ,",
    "can be used to estimate the number of sparks in a ring as @xmath58 .",
    "taking @xmath59 , we get : @xmath60 . further , if @xmath61 , then from eqn .",
    "1 we obtain , @xmath62 . hence , @xmath63 , which relates the number of cones to the measured periodicity and the alias order . here",
    ", the plus sign applies for even alias orders , i.e. @xmath64 , @xmath65 and the minus sign for the odd alias orders , i.e. @xmath66 , @xmath67 .",
    "thus , for our measured periodicity of @xmath19 , the right hand side evaluates to @xmath68 for the inner los solution and first allowed alias order ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "for the outer los solution , it evaluates to @xmath70 for the first allowed alias order ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "the left hand side evaluates to @xmath72 for @xmath73 and to @xmath74 for @xmath75 .",
    "thus , the outer los solution is more compatible with the pulsar having two cones , whereas the inner los solution is in closer agreement with a three cone model .",
    "it is quite likely that the los misses the third innermost cone in this pulsar .",
    "note that drift with higher alias orders ( e.g. @xmath76 ) is incompatible with the above picture : either the number of sparks has to be twice as many ( which is unlikely ) , or the @xmath6 has to be shorter by a factor of 2 .",
    "furthermore , the complexity parameter can be used to estimate the screening factor @xmath77 for the partially screened gap model , which describe the inner acceleration region in pulsars ( @xcite ) . from equation ( 2 ) of @xcite , @xmath78 . for unaliased",
    "drifting ( @xmath79 ) , @xmath80 and @xmath81 for @xmath73 and @xmath75 , respectively . for aliased drifting with @xmath82 ,",
    "the corresponding estimates for @xmath77 are 0.14 and 0.19 . in @xcite ,",
    "calculated @xmath77 values for different pulsars range from 0.032 to 0.36 , with a typical value of @xmath83 meaning that on the average the actual potential drop is of the order of 10% of the pure vacuum gap ( @xcite . the @xmath77 value for the aliased drift case for b0818@xmath014 is comparable to this , whereas for the unaliased drift case it will be the lowest amongst the known values of @xmath77 .",
    "this lends further support to our preference for aliased drift in the case of this pulsar .",
    "the attempt to determine @xmath32 and @xmath6 has been successful only for a few other pulsars : b0834@xmath806 ( @xmath84 , @xcite ) , b0943@xmath810 ( @xmath85 , @xmath32=0 , @xcite ) , b0809@xmath874 ( @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xcite ) and b0826@xmath034 ( @xmath88 , @xmath69 @xcite ) .",
    "we note that compared to these values , our results for b0818@xmath041 give @xmath89 for the unaliased case and @xmath90 for the aliased case .",
    "the permanent plr between the inner and the outer drift regions is a unique feature in b0818@xmath041 .",
    "it suggests that the relative location of the circulating spark pattern in the two rings is strongly correlated , rather than being independent .",
    "furthermore , the circulation rate is the same for both the rings , indicating a common electodynamic control in the entire polar cap .",
    "arrangement of sparks located 180phase shifted in the inner and the outer rings would correspond to the sparks that are maximally packed on the polar cap .",
    "spark discharges occur in every place where the potential drop is high enough to ignite and develop pair production avalanche ( @xcite ) ,",
    "so sparks populate the polar cap as densely as possible . at the same time",
    "such arrangement of sparks should be quasi rigid , a property which is also suggested by the data .",
    "these results could be of significant implication for the physics of the polar cap .",
    "multiple drift regions , with their drifts phase related to each other , are known in only a few pulsars , e.g. b0815@xmath809 by @xcite , and b1839@xmath004 by @xcite .",
    "the mirrored drift bands for b0815@xmath809 are explained in the sparking gap model as emission coming from an inner core gap ( we refer as vacuum gap ) and inner annular gap ( @xcite ) .",
    "the closely spaced inner and the outer drift regions can constrain the radial distances between the rings of emission in the polar cap of b0818@xmath041 . the radius of the inner and the outer ring from the simulation ( fig . [",
    "fig : sim ] ) are , @xmath91 and @xmath92 @xmath0 are roughly in the range predicted for other pulsars by @xcite with a separate investigation method .",
    "to summarize , we find that b0818@xmath041 is a wide profile pulsar with unique drifting properties : closely spaced inner and outer drift regions , with apparently different drift rates , but permanently locked in phase to each other .",
    "to explain the observations , we find that the pulsar needs to be a fairly aligned rotator , with emission seen from two conal rings on the polar cap , likely viewed with an inner los geometry .",
    "each ring has about 19 - 21 sparks , and it is very likely that the carousel rotation period is about @xmath93 for this pulsar .",
    "the observations and analysis presented here constitute only a preview of the remarkable properties of b0818@xmath041 .",
    "follow up studies , including polarisation information and single pulse observations at different frequencies , are expected to provide new and interesting results .",
