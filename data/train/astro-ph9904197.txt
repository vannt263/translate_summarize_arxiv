    "high surface brightness blue galaxies have been a curiosity in samples of nearby galaxies for more than 40 years ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "while these types of compact galaxies were often excluded from traditional samples of galaxies that chose objects on the basis of angular size ( see @xcite ) , they can be readily found in surveys that select for blue colors or strong optical emission lines .",
    "follow - up studies to the markarian survey , for example , have shown that these high surface brightness galaxies consist of systems with agns and/or with extraordinarily high star formation rates ( sfrs ) , i.e. the starburst galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "recently interest in blue high sfr galaxies has been stimulated by their spectroscopic and morphological similarities to classes of galaxies which are commonly found at moderate to high redshifts ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "hence , studying nearby starbursts can further our understanding of rapidly evolving galaxies observed at moderate to large lookback times .    high surface brightness starburst galaxies with blue optical colors comprise about 5% of the local galaxy field population with optical luminosities of @xmath3 3@xmath410@xmath5 ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the origins , structures , and evolution of these luminous blue galaxies ( lbgs ) , however , are not well - understood .",
    "we therefore have undertaken a new study of nearby lbgs with the objectives of obtaining better information on their structures , characterizing spatial patterns of star formation , and measuring internal kinematics .",
    "the dynamics of these systems are particularly important for predicting their subsequent evolution .",
    "many of these galaxies are optically peculiar at the moment we see them , due to enhanced sfrs , but their appearance at later times may be determined by the present locations and kinematics of their stars and gas , which in turn influence future star formation processes .",
    "in this paper we report results from a study of emission line kinematics and optical imaging with the wiyn 3.5 m telescope in the archetypal `` clumpy irregular '' galaxy ngc  7673 ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this galaxy has a highly disturbed optical structure , which leads naturally to the question of its dynamical state .",
    "is this a disrupted system , or an example of unusual star formation processes within a dynamically normal disk galaxy ?",
    "a second paper in this series focuses on star formation patterns and timescales from high angular resolution imaging of ngc  7673 obtained with the wide field planetary camera 2 on the _ hubble space telescope _ ( @xcite ) .",
    "the unusual optical structure of ngc  7673 ( @xmath6 iv  zw  149 , mrk  325 ) was initially described in terms of the presence of multiple bright knots ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "high quality ground - based images , primarily obtained by j. heidmann and his collaborators , indicated this galaxy consists of giant star - forming clumps embedded in a diffuse halo , and thus ngc  7673 was classified as a clumpy irregular galaxy ( @xcite , @xcite ) . the superb ground - based images of coupinot et al .",
    "( 1982 ) also showed the spiral pattern that was noted in the rc2 and by huchra ( 1977 ) , which becomes clearer in images taken with wfpc2 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the hyperactive star formation within the clumps deduced by heidmann and collaborators was confirmed by gallego et al .",
    "( 1996 ) ; their data indicate that l(h@xmath0 ) for the three largest is 2 - 8@xmath410@xmath7 .",
    "these are each comparable to the total l(h@xmath0 ) seen in many starburst galaxy nuclei .",
    "emission line kinematics were measured in ngc  7673 by duflot - augarde & alloin ( 1982 ; hereafter da ) , who found a remarkably constant velocity across the galaxy .",
    "the lack of internal velocity spread led da to conclude that ngc  7673 is rather quiescent , and they therefore rejected a merger model , but noted that an interaction with its neighboring galaxy , ngc  7677 ( mrk 326 ) at a similar radial velocity ( 3554 @xmath8 versus 3405 @xmath8 ) , is possible , as suggested by casini & heidmann ( 1976 ) .",
    "further observations of the emission lines in ngc  7673 by taniguchi & tamura ( 1987 ) taken at higher spectral resolution showed the presence of a broad line component beneath the narrow emission line in clump b , the northwestern clump .",
    "they suggested that this broad feature , for which they measured a full width zero intensity ( fwzi ) of 420@xmath8 , is due to mass motions powered by supernova activity .",
    "ngc 7673 appears to be a member of a small galaxy group that is relatively isolated , possibly located on the outskirts of the pegasus i cluster and in front of the pisces - perseus chain .",
    "the immediate environment of the ngc  7673 - 7 pair was mapped in the hi 21  cm line by nordgren _",
    "( 1997 ) , who find an h  i mass of 3.6 @xmath9 0.5 x 10@xmath10 m@xmath11 for ngc  7673 .",
    "both galaxies contain extended hi disks ; ngc  7673 is apparently nearly face - on with a modest hi - asymmetry to the west .",
    "ngc  7677 contains a small outer hi irregularity that points towards its neighbor , and is at nearly its radial velocity .",
    "thus while an interaction is not excluded , there is no striking evidence for an on - going event in this system .    in this paper",
    "we assume h@xmath1275@xmath8 mpc@xmath2 .",
    "the recession velocity of 3405  @xmath8 for ngc  7673 then implies a distance of 46  mpc , and a linear distance of 222 pc per arcsec .",
    "other parameters in the nasa / ipac extraglactic database are b@xmath1312.81 implying m@xmath1420 and blue global colors of ( b@xmath15v)@xmath160.34 and ( u@xmath15b)@xmath170.38 .    our observations and reductions are detailed in  2 . in ",
    "3 we present our results , which are discussed in  4 , while  5 contains a summary and conclusions .",
    "all observations were made with the wiyn 3.5 m , f/6.5 telescope at the kitt peak national observatory .",
    "all data reduction was performed with iraf .",
    "images were obtained using a tektronics 2048 x 2048 pixel ccd with a field of 6.7 x 6.7 arcmin and a scale of 0.195 arcsec per pixel . on november 13 , 1996",
    "a 500 s exposure was taken with a harris r filter , and a 700 s exposure with a harris b filter .",
    "the images were corrected for bias and zero level and flat - fielded with the ` ccdproc ' task ; cosmic rays were not removed .",
    "the seeing in these images is 0.8 .",
    "narrow band imaging was undertaken on july 24 , 1997 , a non - photometric night with moderately poor seeing .",
    "we were able to get 2 exposures taken with a redshifted h@xmath0 filter , 1000 s and 631 s ( cloud - dodging ) , and a 300 s exposure taken with a harris r filter .",
    "the redshifted h@xmath0 filter is centered at 6618 @xmath18 and has a width of 72  .",
    "thus our h@xmath0 narrow band images also include emission from [ n  ii ] .",
    "these h@xmath0 and r images were processed in the same way as the earlier data , except that we removed cosmic rays from the pair of narrow band images .",
    "both the combined h@xmath0 and r image were scaled in such a way that subtracting the r image from the combined h@xmath0 image canceled out field stars , producing a continuum - subtracted h@xmath0 image .",
    "the seeing in this final h@xmath0 image is about 1.4 .      on october 23 , 1997",
    ", two 1500s exposures were taken with the fiber array densepak ( see @xcite ) on the wiyn nasmyth port .",
    "densepak is a fixed array of 91 red - optimized fibers arranged in a 7 x 13 rectangle .",
    "each fiber has a 3  diameter , and the fiber centers are each separated by 4  to form a 30  x 45  array .",
    "the fiber cable feeds the bench spectrograph , which for these observations was configured with a 316 line mm@xmath2 echelle grating and a grating angle of 62.581 degrees .",
    "we used the bench spectrograph camera and the 2048 x 2048 t2kc ccd detector with 24@xmath19 m per pixel , for a wavelength coverage of approximately 6300 to 6730   with a reciprocal dispersion of 0.13   per ccd pixel .",
    "a densepak schematic is shown in figure 1 .",
    "there are 4 fibers placed off the corners of the array : numbers 8 , 32 , 68 , and 90 .",
    "we were able to use these for the intended purpose of sky subtraction because these fibers were not covering the h@xmath0 emitting regions of the galaxy , so we did not have to move the telescope for a separate sky exposure . also note the gaps in numbering ; 23 and 28 have been skipped .",
    "fibers 46 and 59 are dead .",
    "bias frames and dome flats were taken at the beginning and end of the night and combined during reduction with the iraf task ` dohydra ' .",
    "for wavelength calibration , comparison spectra were taken with a thar lamp after each exposure . the 4 spectra from the sky fibers were combined to make a single sky spectrum and subtracted from each of the other fibers as part of the dohydra procedure . combining the 2 final zeroed , flat - fielded , sky - subtracted spectra was accomplished with ` scombine ' with reject=`crreject ' to remove cosmic rays .    to estimate the error in our measurements ,",
    "gaussian profiles were fit to the night sky lines in the combined sky spectrum with the iraf task ` splot ' .",
    "the observed wavelength of the h@xmath0 line is close to 6638 @xmath18 over the entire galaxy , so comparison night sky lines were chosen near this wavelength .",
    "the fwhm resolution determined in this way is 32 @xmath8 .",
    "the statistical uncertainty in central wavelength for a bright sky line refers to the scatter about the absolute wavelength , and is @xmath20 0.05  , which corresponds to 2.3 @xmath8 at 6638  .",
    "however , in some cases the complex profiles or low signal - to - noise ratios of the h@xmath0 emission lines makes the determination of accurate radial velocities difficult , yielding a greater uncertainty .",
    "gaussian emission profiles were assumed and fitting done with the iraf task splot.",
    "the deep r - band image is shown in figure 2a . ; an unsharp mask of the same image is shown in figure 2b .",
    "surrounding the bright central disk of ngc  7673 are several wispy , low - surface brightness features . in figure 2b",
    "one can see a broad bridge extending to the northwest connecting the inner disk to the first arc at 36  ( 8 kpc ) from the galaxy center .",
    "the next arc , or ripple , can be seen in figure 2a , located to the east at 52  ( 11.5 kpc ) from the center .",
    "the most striking ripple is located to the west at 1.55 ( 21 kpc ) from the center of the bright optical disk .",
    "this sharply defined arc was first reported by dettmar et al .",
    "( 1984 ) , who suggested this feature either could be stars or an emission line region . in figure 2b .",
    "there are several extensions to the main disk , most noticeablely two on the eastern edge and one in the southwest corner .",
    "the linear feature north of ngc 7673 is a background galaxy , which is confirmed by its extreme redness in the b@xmath15r image and the gallagher et al .",
    "( 1999 ) wfpc2 images .    the r - band image is shown again in figure 2c .",
    ", with a stretch that shows the structure of the inner disk , including the central bar . that the light gray smudge in the se corner is a background galaxy is confirmed from its b@xmath15r color and the wfpc2 images which reveal it to be a distant ( and beautiful ) spiral galaxy .",
    "a b@xmath15r color map is shown in figure 2d .",
    "the b and r images have not been photometrically calibrated , so the color map is a b / r ratio map after standard reduction and sky subtraction .",
    "the spiral nature of the inner disk is clearly visible ; there are prominent red dust lanes and bright blue clusters in this image .",
    "unfortunately , we were not able to get color information on the outer ripples ; they are too faint for reliable color measurements from these data . however , the ripples are present in both b and r images with comparable intensities , indicating that they are composed of stars .",
    "a continuum subtracted h@xmath0 image is shown in figure 3 .",
    "there are 3 main h  ii regions : the central nucleus , the large clump to the ne , and a smaller clump situated between the two .",
    "these correspond to clumps a , b , and c , respectively , as referred to by da and taniguchi & tamura ( 1987 ) . in the se corner",
    "there is a fainter h@xmath0 ring , where it is possible to identify smaller h  ii regions .",
    "a bright cluster of stars seen in the b and r -band images is located on the northern side of this crooked arm , nestled between edges of ionized gas visible in the h@xmath0 image .",
    "the gas directly between us and the cluster does not appear in the h@xmath0 image , but the gas in the surrounding galaxy plane is brightly lit .",
    "the diffuse outer features are not detected in our narrow band h@xmath0 image , consistent with our interpretation that they are starlight .",
    "we performed a kinematic study of ngc  7673 using the densepak fiber array and the h@xmath0 emission line redshifted to near 6638  . to find fiber placement on the galaxy , the narrow band h@xmath0 image , figure 3 ,",
    "is compared to the densepak map with flux in gray - scale , shown in figure 4 .",
    "the approximate placement of the densepak array is marked with a box in figure 3 .",
    "figure 4 was produced with the iraf task sbands , taking the flux in a 10  @xmath18 wide band centered on 6638  @xmath18 and using 6  @xmath18 wide bands to the blue and red for continuum subtraction .",
    "the fiber diameter of 3  covers a linear distance of approximately 650 pc at ngc  7673 , but we were not able to cover all of the main body of the galaxy with our single densepak pointing .",
    "no emission was detected in 29 of the 89 working fibers ; the fiber illumination pattern is consistent with our h@xmath0 image . of the remaining 60 fibers ,",
    "32 had emission fit by a single gaussian , and 28 were deconvolved into two gaussian components , one broad and one narrow .",
    "it became clear that deconvolution was necessary when a single component fit left large , broad , asymmetric shoulders of emission ; most of these broad lines are found in the northern half of the galaxy .",
    "sample spectra are displayed in figure 5 .",
    "fibers on the southern part of the galaxy were fit by a single gaussian , but in most cases small shoulders , or wings , of emission often remained .",
    "these wings are similar in shape to those in the middle of the array , but much less pronounced . even in spectra with similar peak emission ,",
    "the wings were smaller in the southern part of the galaxy .",
    "a deconvolution of these spectra into two components improved the fit , but with one or both of the components having a fwhm at or below the instrumental resolution .",
    "therefore , these spectra were fit with a single gaussian .",
    "figure 6 is a plot of fwhm , corrected for the instrumental profile ( fwhm@xmath21=(fwhm@xmath22)@xmath21-(32 km s@xmath2)@xmath21 ) , versus position , which shows the distinct widths of the two components , and some scatter , but no systematic variation @xmath23 10 km s@xmath2 in the fwhm of the narrow emission component over the galaxy .",
    "some spectra show what appear to be multiple peaks , perhaps due to emission from two or more individual h  ii regions , or splitting from expanding shells or bubbles .",
    "since most of these spectra have low s / n , a single - gaussian fit was forced to recover a mean central velocity and a fwhm of dubious meaning .",
    "such profiles were observed in 12 fibers ; 6 had fwhms consistent with the narrow component , and 6 had fwhm @xmath23 90 km s@xmath2 .",
    "the velocity field as measured by the heliocentric velocities of the narrow components is shown in figure 7 , where the velocity is in km s@xmath2 and grayscale shading is used to help visualize the velocity field . filled polygons indicate spectra with no narrow emission component .",
    "fibers with broad emission but not narrow are thus represented by filled polygons ; this includes fibers 55 , 62 , 72 , 79 , and 81 .",
    "fibers which were fit by both a narrow and a broad gaussian are marked with a small cross above the velocity .",
    "we find the narrow component velocity field to be fairly constant , with a radial velocity difference of only @xmath24 60 @xmath8 across the galaxy regions covered by densepak ( the western side of the galaxy was not sampled ) .",
    "the maximum velocity is 3444 km s@xmath2 in the sw corner , and falls to 3403 @xmath8 at the northern edge .",
    "the minimum , 3392 @xmath8 , occurs near the nuclear region , and the recession velocity of the nucleus itself is @xmath24 3407 @xmath8 .",
    "these results agree with previous measurements by da .",
    "this also agrees with the h i data ( @xcite which shows the peak emission to be at a heliocentric velocity of 3410 @xmath8 .",
    "the precision of the densepak absolute radial velocities is similar to that obtained from hi 21-cm line measurements .",
    "the shallow velocity gradient across ngc  7673 indicates that the h  ii regions are confined to a dynamically cold rotating disk that is nearly face - on .",
    "the optical and h  i morphology of ngc  7673 also suggest the presence of a disk , whose existence is confirmed by these emission line measurements showing rotation about its barred nuclear region .",
    "although the disk shows signs of perturbation , such as copious star formation and a disturbed spiral pattern , it has survived the event which triggered the starburst and appears to be rotating smoothly .",
    "the velocity gradient measured by optical emission lines ( here , and by da ) , although modest due to a small angle of inclination , differs from that of the h i disk ( @xcite ) .",
    "the western edge of the optical disk is approaching and the eastern receding , but the h  i velocity gradient is in the opposite sense .",
    "this may be a signature that moderate - scale kinematic disturbances remain in the disk of ngc  7673 , and high angular resolution h  i maps would provide a useful diagnostic of the state of this galaxy .",
    "in regions of low flux , the emission line profiles are usually gaussian in shape ; however , as previously mentioned , 12 fibers contain spectra with large asymmetries . over the central regions of the galaxy where the flux is highest , we find h@xmath0 emission lines with a relatively narrow core and broad wings , very similar to the integrated profiles of giant h  ii regions found in many previous studies ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . some of these emission lines are well fit by a voigt profile , but most have asymmetric shoulders , and thus are best fit with two gaussian components .",
    "we therefore assume that the emission line profiles which resemble voigt profile are a combination of two gaussian components with negligible velocity offset , and fit all such profiles with two gaussians , leaving the central wavelengths and line widths free to vary . taking the emission component(s ) in each fiber , we find the mean fwhm of each kinematic component is 56 and 149 @xmath8 , respectively ( @xmath25 @xmath24 24 km s@xmath2 , @xmath25 @xmath24 63 km s@xmath2 )",
    ". fibers with emission lines which were fit with two profiles are marked with a small cross in figure 7 .",
    "most of the broad components are at a slightly lower velocity relative to the narrow line in the same spectrum , but never by more than 10 @xmath8 .",
    "taniguchi & tamura ( 1987 ) also found a narrow and a broad component in the h@xmath0 emission line from clump b ; they measured the broad component as having a fwhm @xmath23 200@xmath8 , and found it was redshifted by 13 @xmath8 relative to the narrow component of fwhm @xmath24 70 @xmath8 .",
    "the mean fwhm of the narrow component is much broader than emission from typical h  ii regions in our own galaxy ( typical fwhm @xmath24 25@xmath8 , see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the origin of ionized gas with supersonic velocity dispersions is still a subject of debate , and thus a generally accepted model for this phenomenon does not yet exist .",
    "an l-@xmath25 ( luminosity - velocity dispersion ) and d-@xmath25 ( size - velocity dispersion ) correlation for giant h  ii regions has been firmly established ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , but it is still not clear what this relationship means .",
    "l and d should correlate with mass ; therefore one expects the velocity dispersion to also increase .",
    "however , the energy input to the ism in the form of ionizing photons , stellar winds , and supernovae should also correlate with l and d , increasing the amount of ionized structure ( expanding shells , filaments , etc . ) and turbulent motions , both of which may broaden the integrated emission profiles .",
    "there is evidence that apertures which include multiple ionized structures at various velocities can create a smooth gaussian profile with a broadened core ( @xcite , @xcite ) . in a study of ngc 604 , the brightest h ii region in m33 , yang et al .",
    "( 1996 ) showed that although some of the broadening in the integrated profile is due to averaging over many emitting regions , the mean corrected fwhm still shows a substantial velocity dispersion above that expected from purely thermal broadening .",
    "they concluded that the extra 30 @xmath8 could be explained as virial motions .",
    "this is in contrast to the case of the 30 doradus giant h ii region as examined by chu & kennicutt ( 1994 ) , where even a tenfold increase in the estimated mass of the region yielded a gravitational velocity dispersion that was negligible in comparison with the observed dispersion . in this case",
    "the conclusion was that the dominant contribution to the global velocity dispersion in 30 dor is from shell motions , but with turbulence also playing a role .",
    "it is not clear what is causing the width of the narrow emission cores in the case of ngc  7673 .",
    "if it is due to gravitational motions , we should expect to see wider lines in connection with the more massive h ii regions as shown in the h@xmath0 image .",
    "broadening due to averaging over many bubbles and filaments should also produce a spatial variation in the line widths , as some fibers cover a greater number of h  ii regions than others . due to the low spatial resolution of our observations and the uncertainty in fiber placement",
    ", we can not rule out either of these possibilities .",
    "the observed scatter of approximately 10 km s@xmath2 in the total fwhm about the mean value implies an extra velocity component of width @xmath24 35 km s@xmath2 ( fwhm , or @xmath1 15 km s@xmath2 ) is possible .",
    "we also see a broad emission component underlying the ( relatively ) narrow cores , which have been previously observed in h@xmath0 emission lines , but are not well - understood .",
    "broadened cores produced by averaging over many emitting areas have been found accompanied by low - intensity wings ( @xcite ) , presumably from expanding shells and bubbles .",
    "the recent study of ngc 604 ( @xcite ) also showed broad wings in the integrated profiles , again , from the inclusion of many expanding shells .",
    "it would be interesting to see if these integrated profiles can be deconvolved into narrow and broad components , and how the width and/or shape of the lines change as one averages over a larger area .",
    "there are three leading explanations for the broad wings : they may be the result of integrating over many ionized structures at different velocities , or a broad emission component may be present from hot , turbulent gas confined to large cavities carved out by massive stars , or they could be due to some type of break - out phenomenon , such as a champagne flow or a starburst - powered galactic wind .    massive outflow phenomenon is highly unlikely because of the absence of double - peaked emission profiles and/or a substantial velocity offset between the narrow and broad components , both of which are characteristic of superwinds ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this leaves us with the first two explanations as listed above .",
    "given the results of the studies by chu & kenicutt ( 1994 ) and yang et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , we favor the first explanation , where the line profiles are the result of integrating over many shells , bubbles , and filaments , which can also explain the highly supersonic line widths of the narrow component .",
    "ngc  7673 is a close projected companion to ngc  7677 , which has a similar radial velocity ; therefore these two galaxies are probably a physical pair ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the surrounding area is free of small h  i sources .",
    "a few minor appendages to the main disk of ngc  7673 are seen in the low - resolution h i map of nordgren et at .",
    "( 1997 ) , but there is an absence of classic interaction signatures , such as h  i tails . given the disturbed optical appearance of ngc  7673 , its overall h  i morphology is surprisingly symmetric .",
    "no h  i peculiarities near the location of the outer optical shell were detected , although this may be due to the low resolution of the h  i map . as mentioned previously , there is a warp in the disk of ngc  7677 and an h  i extension pointing towards ngc  7673 , but the outer h  i envelopes are widely separated .",
    "the h  i structure in these galaxies displays no indications of a significant on - going interaction between the two ; any serious interaction would need to have taken place long enough ago for the outer h i disks to recover to their observed relatively normal states .",
    "the discrepancy between the morphology of ngc  7673 and ngc  7677 is apparent on the digital sky survey frames ; ngc  7677 looks relatively regular , with a bright nuclear region and grand design spiral arms , in dramatic contrast to ngc  7673 , whose high levels of star formation create giant h ii regions and a remarkably clumpy appearance .",
    "if the starburst in ngc  7673 is due to an interaction with ngc  7677 , then the interaction scenario must be able to explain why ngc  7673 is so disturbed , and ngc  7677 relatively unscathed .",
    "we conclude that an on - going interaction with ngc  7677 is not the starburst trigger . even though no strong collision is currently in progress between ngc  7673 and ngc  7677",
    ", the disturbed outer optical disk of ngc  7673 does seem to be the signature of a past interaction .",
    "the sharp outermost arc , along with the wispy extensions and faint ripples that surround the bright inner optical disk , are features usually associated with merger candidate e , s0 , and a few sa galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "these structures are rare in later - type galaxies , but have also been found around another spiral starburst galaxy , ngc  3310 ( @xcite ) .",
    "there are striking similarities between ngc  7673 and ngc  3310 .",
    "they are both starburst galaxies with inner spiral structure surrounded by faint arcs and ripples , and their h@xmath0 emission lines are strong and asymmetric ( @xcite ) .",
    "the general consensus is that ngc  3310 has gone through a minor merger with a dwarf companion , which accounts for the starburst , peculiar arc , and ripple features in its outer parts ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the minor merger model therefore is also attractive for ngc  7673 .",
    "theoretical work concerning ripples and shells around galaxies has shown that they can be formed in a variety of circumstances around both elliptical and disk galaxies ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "observationally , it is often difficult to distinguish between the models , and thus the origin of ripples in any particular object is often a subject of debate .",
    "thus while mergers are the preferred model for the production of ripples and related features , their origin in other types of interactions can not be excluded .",
    "we therefore have two possible models : the ngc  7673 starburst could have been triggered by a past interaction with ngc  7677 that occurred long enough ago that any tidal streamers are gone , or a small galaxy could have merged with ngc  7673 in the past and the nearby presence of ngc  7677 is simply fortuitous . in either case the collisional event must have occurred long enough ago to allow the outer disk to mostly recover , and have been mild enough to avoid serious disruption of the main disk .",
    "any interloper must therefore have been much smaller than the accreting galaxy , probably @xmath26 10 @xmath27 of the mass of the disk ( @xcite ) , making ngc  7673 a minor merger candidate .",
    "we have obtained moderate resolution optical images and echelle spectroscopy of the luminous blue galaxy ngc  7673 .",
    "our b - r color map shows red dust lanes and blue star clusters in an irregular spiral pattern , and the h@xmath0 image confirms that these bright clusters are also giant h ii regions .",
    "the deep b and r -band images confirm the presence of the previously reported ripple 1.55 west of the galaxy center ( @xcite ) , as well as revealing several other faint extensions and ripples surrounding the bright optical disk .",
    "these features are composed of stars , probably in the outer disk of ngc  7673 .",
    "our fiber array measurements of the h@xmath0 kinematics demonstrate that the h  ii regions are embedded in a smoothly rotating disk that we are viewing near a rotational pole . despite the presence of a large - scale starburst",
    ", the disk velocity field appears to be remarkably regular . in areas of low flux ,",
    "the emission profiles are often highly asymmetric , and are not well described by a single gaussian profile .",
    "we may be seeing line splitting from isolated ionized super - shells , or the lines may be a combination of two or more h  ii regions with different radial velocities .",
    "double gaussian fits were performed on emission lines from the central regions of the galaxy to investigate the nature of the broad wings of emission .",
    "we find that a two component model , one narrow and one broad , fit the observed spectra rather well .",
    "the narrow component of complex emission line profiles have the same width as the single component lines , fwhm @xmath24 55 @xmath8 , and the broad component has a fwhm @xmath24 150 @xmath8 .",
    "the broad lines often have a slight velocity offset ( @xmath26 10@xmath8 ) , blue - ward of the narrow lines .",
    "we can exclude an active interaction with ngc 7677 as the starburst trigger , but we can not rule out a past interaction . if ngc 7677 is the culprit , then the starburst phase must be sustained well after the main encounter .",
    "the other possibility is capture of a dwarf companion , as in the case of ngc 3310 , the leading candidate for a major starburst induced by a minor merger .",
    "the morphological similarities between ngc  7673 and ngc  3310 and ngc  7673 s symmetric outer h i disk ( @xcite ) lend support to the minor merger hypothesis .",

    "<S> the morphology and kinematics of the luminous blue starburst galaxy ngc  7673 are explored using the wiyn 3.5 m telescope . </S>",
    "<S> signs of a past kinematic disturbance are detected in the outer galaxy ; the most notable feature is a luminous ripple located 1.55 arc minutes from the center of ngc  7673 . </S>",
    "<S> sub - arc second imaging in b and r filters also reveals red dust lanes and blue star clusters that delineate spiral arms in the bright inner disk and narrow band h@xmath0 imaging shows that the luminous star clusters are associated with giant h  ii regions . </S>",
    "<S> the h@xmath0 kinematics measured with echelle imaging spectroscopy using the wiyn densepak fiber array imply that these h  ii regions are confined to a smoothly rotating disk . </S>",
    "<S> the velocity dispersion in ionized gas in the disk is @xmath1 24  km  s@xmath2 , which sets an upper bound on the dispersion of young stellar populations .. broad emission components with @xmath1 63  km  s@xmath2 found in some regions are likely produced by mechanical power supplied by massive , young stars ; a violent starburst is occurring in a kinematically calm disk . </S>",
    "<S> although the asymmetric outer features point to a merger or interaction as the starburst trigger , the inner disk structure constrains the strength of the event to the scale of a minor merger or weak interaction that occurred at least an outer disk dynamical time scale in the past . </S>"
