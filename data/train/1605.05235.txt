    "superluminous supernovae ( slsne ) , characterized by peak luminosities 10 - 100 times higher than ordinary core - collapse and type ia sne , are a rare type of transients discovered in untargeted surveys over the past decade .",
    "their extreme energetics can not be explained by the same mechanism as ordinary sne , requiring either an additional energy source beyond @xmath4ni decay , or an exotic explosion mechanism . from an observational point of view",
    ", slsne can be classified into at least two distinct categories @xcite : h - rich slsne ( ` slsn - ii ' ) show balmer lines in their spectra , and most are similar to type iin sne and likely indicating strong interaction with circumstellar material ( csm ) ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in this case , a large fraction of the kinetic energy of the ejecta can be converted into radiation , powering the large luminosities .",
    "in contrast , h - poor slsne ( ` slsn - i ' ) typically have spectra distinct from any other known sn types , characterized by a very blue continuum with a few , broad features from intermediate - mass elements ( e.g. , @xcite ) . the primary power source for this class",
    "is debated : csm interaction can explain the energetics , but would require several solar masses of h - poor material shed in the last few years to decades before explosion @xcite .",
    "an alternative scenario is energy injection from a central engine , such as the spin - down of a newborn magnetar @xcite .",
    "@xmath4ni decay , which powers the optical light curve of ordinary type ibc sne , can generally be ruled out for this subclass as the fast timescales at peak are incompatible with the large ni masses that would be required to power the luminosities ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , some h - poor slsne do show slow decay rates that match that of radioactive @xmath4co .",
    "@xcite proposed that these be grouped into a third subclass , ` slsn - r ' ( the ` r ' stands for radioactivity ) , modeled on the unusual h - poor slsn sn2007bi @xcite .",
    "sn2007bi had both a slow decay rate and a nebular phase spectrum consistent with several solar masses of @xmath4ni produced in the explosion , leading @xcite to propose that sn2007bi was a pair - instability supernova ( pisn ) .",
    "this mechanism is theorized to be the final fate of stars with initial masses @xmath9 , where the high temperatures in the oxygen core leads to electron - positron pair production triggering a nuclear explosion @xcite . while originally thought to be mainly relevant for population iii stars in the early universe @xcite , models including rotation are able to produce pisne also from non - zero metallicity stars @xcite .",
    "the interpretation of sn2007bi as a pisn ( and by extension , the interpretation of ` slsn - r ' as a separate class from other h - poor slsne and powered by radioactivity ) is controversial , however .",
    "a key prediction of pisn models is a long ( @xmath10 ) rise - time due to the large ejecta mass , which in turn leads to a long diffusion time through the ejecta .",
    "as sn2007bi was discovered near peak , the rise was not observed , and csm interaction or magnetar spin - down models can also fit the observed light curve .",
    "in addition , other h - poor slsne with decay rates and spectroscopic properties similar to sn2007bi have since been discovered , showing shorter rise times incompatible with pisn models but well - fit by magnetar spin - down models @xcite , thus casting doubt also on the nature of sn2007bi . finding more slowly - evolving slsne with well - sampled light curves is therefore crucial in shedding light on the origins of this potential subclass .    here",

    "ps1/mds consists of 10 fields ( each with a single ps1 imager footprint ) observed in @xmath21@xmath22@xmath23@xmath24with a typical cadence of 3  d in each filter , to a typical nightly depth of @xmath26 mag ( @xmath27 ) ; @xmath25is used near full moon with a typical depth of @xmath28 mag .",

    "the detection image was also the first image taken of this field after 2013 may 10.3 , so we do not have any recent limits to constrain the explosion date further .",
    "the ps1/mds light curve shows an unusually slow rise over an observed time scale of two months , and ps1 - 14bj was selected for follow - up spectroscopy .",
    "an initial mmt spectrum taken on 2014 march 8.3 proved inconclusive , so an additional spectrum was obtained with gemini - north on 2014 march 28.4 .",
    "the broad spectral features in those data show an excellent match with the earliest spectrum of the unusual h - poor slsn sn2007bi @xcite , and an approximate redshift of @xmath29 was determined by cross - correlating the sn spectrum with that of sn2007bi .",
    "as the supernova faded , weak narrow - line [ ] @xmath75007 and h@xmath30 emission from the host galaxy became visible , yielding a precise redshift of @xmath31 , which is adopted throughout this paper .",
    "the somewhat higher redshift estimate obtained by comparison with sn2007bi is due to the higher expansion velocity of that object compared to ps1 - 14bj ( section  [ sec : spectra ] ) .",
    "we note that given this redshift , the observed peak magnitude of ps1 - 14bj is @xmath32 ( i - band ) .",
    "this is fainter than the proposed slsn cutoff at @xmath33 in @xcite , illustrating that such a cutoff is arbitrary .",
    "we determine the time of peak light by fitting a low - order polynomial to our constructed bolometric light curve ( section  [ sec : bollc ] ) , yielding a best - fit time of peak of mjd 56801.3 @xmath34 .",
    "all phases reported are relative to the time of peak light .      as ps1 - 14bj",
    "was discovered at the very end of ps1/mds , we have continued to follow it up from other telescopes to continue the light curve .",
    "additional optical imaging was mainly obtained with mmtcam , an f/5 imager on the 6.5  m mmt telescope ; with the low dispersion survey spectrograph ( ldss3 ) and the inamori - magellan advanced camera for surveys ( imacs ; @xcite ) on the 6.5  m magellan telescopes ; with the gemini multi - object spectrograph ( gmos ; @xcite ) on the 8  m gemini telescopes as part of acquisition for spectroscopy ; and some additional images from the large binocular cameras on the 8.4  m large binocular telescope @xcite , the retractable optical camera for monitoring ( retrocam ; @xcite ) on the mdm 2.4  m hiltner telescope , and the 1.3  m mcgraw - hill telescope at mdm observatory in direct imaging mode with the r4k detector .",
    "we also obtained two epochs of nir imaging with the fourstar infrared camera on the 6.5  m magellan / baade telescope @xcite .",

    "the field of view and consequently the stars available for photometric calibration varies between the instruments we used to follow ps1 - 14bj . to ensure consistency , we first measured the light curve relative to two nearby stars that are present in all images .",

    "we determine the total flux using aperture photometry , with the zeropoint determined from 2mass stars in the field , and subtract the expected host contribution numerically .",
    "the resulting @xmath37-band magnitudes are listed in table  [ tab : phot ] .",
    "@xmath38-band imaging was also performed in the second epoch , but the detection is marginal and close to the expected host galaxy flux within the uncertainties .",

    "we use observations of spectrophotometric standard stars ( archival in the case of gmos ) to apply a flux calibration and correct for telluric absorption .",
    "the final gmos - n observation was taken in nod - and - shuffle mode @xcite , but we find that the sky subtraction is adequate without performing the subtraction of nod pairs , so we simply shift and combine all exposures with the same grating tilt prior to spectral extraction .",
    "observations taken in red - sensitive setups used order - blocking filters .",
    "the slits were generally aligned near the parallactic angle @xcite , except at low airmass or with imacs , which has an atmospheric dispersion compensator , so the relative flux scales should be reliable , as demonstrated below by comparison to the photometry in section  [ sec : bb ] . in some cases ,",

    "we lack supernova - free galaxy templates in our specific camera and filter combinations , and therefore the image subtraction method can not yet be applied to analyze the light curves in detail .",
    "however , our data demonstrates that lsq14an was indeed discovered on the decline ( as was inferred from the initial pessto spectrum ) , and furthermore that it is also a slsn with a slow decline rate , establishing it as a reasonable comparison object for ps1 - 14bj .",
    "the host galaxy is visible in the pan - starrs 3@xmath48 image stack , at @xmath49 and @xmath50 ( @xcite ; inserra et al . in prep ) indicating that the flattening of the lightcurve in figure 4 is almost certainly due to contamination of the host .",

    "the light curve of ps1 - 14bj is significantly broader than the other events , in particular having a significantly longer rise time than any of the other events , and a flatter light curve with a lower peak luminosity . in the bluer band ,",
    "the decline of ps1 - 14bj appears shallower than the other events , but the decline in the redder filter is similar to the other events .",
    "the decay slope of lsq14an appears to be even shallower than ps1 - 14bj , but the photometry plotted for this event includes an unknown contribution from the host galaxy ( section  [ sec : lsq14an ] ) .",
    "interestingly , the light curve decline is not entirely smooth particularly in @xmath39- and @xmath51-band ( figure  [ fig : obslc ] ) , but shows some undulations around 100 - 200  days .",
    "the light curve of sn2007bi shows a similar kink @xcite , and recently @xcite showed that the well - studied sn2015bn also displays a `` knee '' in the light curve decline .",

    "bluer _ colors with time in @xmath57 .",
    "this is different from the color evolution observed so far in virtually all h - poor slsne , which usually start out very blue but turn redder as the ejecta expand and cool ( see e.g. ps1 - 11ap , shown in fig .  [",

    "we fit blackbody curves to the sed of ps1 - 14bj in order to track the temperature and radius of the photosphere with time , using the idl mpfitfun framework to fit a planck function to the observed photometry .",

    "we therefore exclude @xmath46-band measurements from our blackbody fits when calculating the bolometric correction in the red , and for most epochs only fit @xmath59 , here illustrated by the blue dotted curve . including the @xmath37-band photometry ( orange dot - dashed curve ) yields a very similar fit , indicating that the @xmath59 fit is a reasonable approximation of the sed shape redwards of the observed bands.,width=336 ]    figure  [ fig : bb ] shows the resulting blackbody temperatures ( top ) and radii ( middle ) , showing fits both to all filters ( black points ) and excluding @xmath46-band ( red points ) .",
    "the plotted error bars are the formal uncertainties returned from the blackbody fits given the photometry uncertainties . while the formal uncertainty is small ( in many cases @xmath60 and thus too small to be seen on the plot in figure  [ fig : bb ] ) , the fact that the difference between the set of fits is larger than the calculated error bars indicates that the systematic uncertainty associated with line blanketing is the dominant source of uncertainty on the actual temperature .",
    "we note that the trends in temperature and radius are the same for both sets of fits , however .",
    "the temperature fits show the same trends as are seen in the color evolution : the blackbody temperature is remarkably slowly evolving as well , and is in fact increasing with time over the entire time sampled by our light curve . with the overall flux declining , while the temperature is constant or increasing , the best - fit blackbody radius is decreasing as the light curve declines .",
    "we note that combining the estimated radius at peak ( 35 @xmath61 ) and photospheric velocity ( 5000  ; section  [ sec : spectra ] ) yields a rise - time of 70115  days , well within our observed rise .",

    "for the purposes of this correction , we use the fits that exclude @xmath46-band .",
    "blueward of the observed @xmath46-band , the spectra show that the flux is suppressed by line blanketing , and , in particular , not well approximated by a blackbody .",
    "we therefore do not attempt to add a correction for missing blue flux , and our reported bolometric light curve should be considered a lower limit .",
    "we do have a few spectra with coverage extending bluer than @xmath46-band ; from summing the total flux in the 2014 april 28 blue channel spectrum bluewards of @xmath46-band , as well as approximating the spectral shape in the blue as a polynomial and extrapolating , we find that the missing flux is of order @xmath62 of the total .    the resulting bolometric light curve is shown in figure  [ fig : bollc ] , and the data is listed in table  [ tab : bollc ] .",
    "open symbols show the light curve from only combining the observed flux at epochs where we have at least three filters , and the closed symbols include the bolometric correction to the red . for the earliest light curve points , where we lack color information",

    "similarly , for the last three epochs we only have the @xmath63 color , and we estimate the bolometric luminosity by assuming the same bolometric correction as for the last two epochs with multi - color data . the @xmath63 color in our latest epochs is consistent with the previous epochs within the uncertainties , so this is not an unreasonable assumption . as",
    "the color is somewhat different between these three epochs , we get different results depending on whether we scale from @xmath47- or @xmath39-band ; we take the mean value as our best estimate .",
    "we caution , however , that at these late times the spectra are dominated by line emission rather than continuum , and so the blackbody assumptions used to derive the bolometric corrections will break down .",
    "the error bars of the latest light curve points are therefore likely underestimated .",
    "the peak luminosity is @xmath64 or @xmath65 .",
    "as can also be glanced from figure  [ fig : lccomp ] , ps1 - 14bj is significantly lower luminosity at peak than other slowly - evolving slsne .",

    "however , while noisy , the latest light curve points ( around 400  days ) lie above the @xmath4co prediction ; including these points give a best - fit decay slope of @xmath68 .",
    "we estimate the time of explosion from fitting a @xmath69 polynomial to the rise portion of the light curve , setting the explosion date at mjd 56607.0 ( 2013 november 11.0 ) @xmath70 , with most of the uncertainty being due to the noisy nature of the early light curve .",
    "this suggests that ps1 - 14bj exploded a short time before ps1/mds resumed observing the field on 2013 november 22.6 , so our observed data covers most of the rise .",
    "we note that a @xmath69 polynomial is an excellent fit to the rise of the light curve , with a reduced @xmath71 value of 1.01 .",
    "we therefore do not find any evidence for a double - peaked light curve , as was seen in lsq14bdq @xcite , and argued to possibly be a ubiquitous feature of h - poor slsne @xcite .",
    "similarly , we estimate the time of peak by fitting a forth - order polynomial to the data near peak , and find the best - fit time of peak to be mjd 56801.3 @xmath34 ; here the uncertainty is mainly due to the flatness of the peak .",
    "this gives a rise time estimate of 128  days in the rest frame , the longest observed in a slsn so far .",
    "integrating our bolometric light curve over time gives an estimate of the total radiated energy : @xmath72 .",

    "lsq14an at + 60 days is also very similar to ps1 - 14bj despite the difference in phase , including the low velocities .",

    "figure  [ fig : pisn_comp ] shows the light curve of ps1 - 14bj compared to the theoretical pisn light curves from @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "overall , ps1 - 14bj is a reasonable match to the shape of these light curves , with a luminosity intermediate between the he100 and he110 models .",
    "it does have a flatter light curve peak and lower peak luminosity than the similar - width pisn light curves , however .",
    "unlike the simple arnett model fit in figure  [ fig : arnett ] , these light curves are derived from radiation hydrodynamics modeling of the supernova explosions given several different progenitor models , and therefore do not have the freedom to tune the nickel and ejecta mass separately as in the simple arnett fit .",
    "this explains why the fit in figure  [ fig : arnett ] can better reproduce the flatter light curve shape , even though both the pisn models and the arnett model are essentially ni - powered .",
    "the pisn models have the same problem as the arnett model in that the light curve points around @xmath101 lie above the model prediction .",
    "we note that while not a perfect match to the theoretical expectation , ps1 - 14bj at least shows that there exist slsne with the broad light curves and long rise times expected by pisn models .",
    "@xcite presented core - collapse models for the light curve of sn2007bi , showing that it could also be reasonably fit as an extreme core - collapse event rather than a pisn . in their model ,",
    "the light curve is fit by the explosion of a 43  m@xmath104 carbon - oxygen core , producing 6  m@xmath98 of @xmath4ni , and thus demonstrating that such large ni masses need not be the result of a pisn .",
    "the main discriminant between the core - collapse and pisn models is the supernova rise time , with the core - collapse having a lower ejected mass and thus a shorter rise time .",
    "ps1 - 14bj is not a good match to their core - collapse model , however : its rise time of @xmath1  days , as well as the relatively low velocities on the rise , are better matched by their pisn model .",
    "thus , if ps1 - 14bj is powered by @xmath4ni it is more consistent with a pisn than an extreme core - collapse sn interpretation .    arguing against a pisn/@xmath4ni model of ps1 - 14bj ,",
    "however , are the color and spectroscopic evolution . while ps1 - 14bj is redder than a typical slsn on the rise , it is still bluer than the expected colors of a pisn explosion due to the large amount of line blanketing from @xmath4ni ( e.g. , the models of @xcite have a maximum photospheric temperature of @xmath105 ) .",
    "the discrepancy grows worse after peak , as pisn models ( or indeed any @xmath4ni - powered model ) predict the color turning redder on the light curve decline , whereas ps1 - 14bj shows a nearly constant color that , if anything , turns bluer .",
    "we note that the 250 m model of @xcite shows a temperature plateau for about 200 days up to and around peak light , but even this model cools to a color temperature of @xmath106 on the decline .",
    "the spectral evolution of ps1 - 14bj also does not match what is expected from a pisn model .",
    "@xcite found a reasonable match between the spectra of their he100 model at 100 days after explosion with the earliest available spectra of sn  2007bi , despite not explicitly tuning the model .",
    "given the similarity between the two objects , that model should also be a reasonable match to the spectra of ps1 - 14bj near maximum light , except for the difference in expansion velocities .",
    "however , the spectra of the he100 model show significant evolution over time , with a smooth and relatively blue spectrum at 50 days after explosion evolving to a very red and line - blanketed one at 250 days ( their figure 9 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the spectra of ps1 - 14bj do not show such a rapid evolution and the models would not be a good match to our earliest and latest spectra ( figure  [ fig : spec_montage ] ) .",
    "recently , @xcite calculated model nebular phase spectra of pisne , which are also not a good match to our late - time spectra .",
    "specifically , their models have very little flux emerging bluewards of 5000   and are dominated by lines from in the wavelength range covered by our spectra .",
    "some contributing flux from [ ] @xmath786300,6364 is seen in their models , but no higher - ionization species of oxygen are predicted . beyond the theoretical models ,",
    "the fact that [ ] is not seen in nebular spectra of ordinary core - collapse sne is in itself an argument against @xmath4ni decay being the sole power source .",
    "ni mass of 10  m@xmath98 , and a total ejecta mass of @xmath107 .",
    "note that the bolometric correction of the last three points ( colored gray ) is highly uncertain , so the departure from the @xmath4co decay slope may not be real.,width=326 ]          since radioactive decay can not be the energy source for the majority of slsne , several alternatives have been proposed .",
    "one possible energy source is the rotational energy of a newborn neutron star rapidly spinning down in a strong magnetic field .",
    "theoretical calculations show that in the regime with initial spin of a few milliseconds and magnetic field of @xmath108  g , the magnetar spin - down time is comparable to the diffusion time through the supernova ejecta , producing a long - lived energy injection that can significantly boost the optical radiation @xcite .",
    "magnetar models have successfully been able to reproduce the light curves and other basic observed properties of a range of slsne ( e.g. , @xcite ) , including those with slow decay time scales such as sn2007bi @xcite .",
    "the key parameters of the magnetar model are the initial spin period @xmath109 , which sets the total amount of rotational energy as @xmath110 ; the magnetic field , which together with the initial period sets the spin - down timescale as @xmath111 , and the total ejecta mass which sets the diffusion timescale @xmath112 as before .",
    "the resulting luminosity can then be solved for semi - analytically as    @xmath113    this suggests that in order to create a magnetar - powered slsn with slow timescales , we need some combination of a larger ejecta mass ( increasing the diffusion time ) and larger ratio of @xmath114 ( increasing the spin - down timescale ) compared to more typical slsne .",
    "since @xmath109 sets the total energy scale , which is not that different in ps1 - 14bj to other slsne , in practice this means we require a weaker magnetic field .",
    "the green - dotted curve in figure  [ fig : magnetar ] shows the best - fit three - parameter magnetar model to the light curve of ps1 - 14bj .",
    "this model has an initial spin of 3.1  ms , a magnetic field of @xmath115  g , and a total ejecta mass of 22.5  m@xmath98 .",
    "it does a decent job of reproducing the overall broad light curve , but overpredicts the flux at late times and also starts declining earlier than the observed light curve ; the reduced @xmath71 of the fit is 2.9 .",
    "overpredicting the flux on the late light curve decline is a common problem of magnetar models , but can be overcome if the assumption that all of the spin - down energy from the magnetar is being thermalized in the ejecta is relaxed .",
    "as the ejecta expand , they become optically thin to hard emission and significant amounts of @xmath116- and x - ray photons can escape .",
    "@xcite considered this effect for slsne , and parametrized the changing opacity to @xmath116-rays as @xmath117 , so that equation  [ eqn : magnetar ] is modified by the expression @xmath118 @xcite . including this term , the purple - dashed curve in figure  [ fig : magnetar ] shows the best fit to ps1 - 14bj , found by first finding the best three - parameter fit to the data on the rise through peak , and then adjusting the leakage parameter to fit the decline .",
    "the model shown also has an initial spin of 3.1  ms but a lower magnetic field of @xmath119  g , a slightly lower ejecta mass of 16  m@xmath98 , a leakage parameter @xmath120 and a reduced @xmath71 value of 1.9 .",
    "this value of @xmath121 is within the range of typical values for ccsne ( @xmath122 ) though lower by a factor of @xmath123 than what one would derive from equation  4 of @xcite using the mass derived in the magnetar model and the velocities we measure from the spectra ( @xmath124 ) , suggesting either a lower effective gamma - ray opacity @xmath125 , or that the assumptions of uniform ejecta density distribution and constant expansion velocity may not apply .",
    ", width=326 ]    while the overall shape of the light curve can be fit by a magnetar model , this class of models also meets a problem in explaining the observed color evolution , particularly at late times .",
    "modeling the temperature evolution on the rise generally requires hydrodynamical simulations outside of the scope of this paper , but on the decline the magnetar model predicts that the ejecta is swept into a shell moving at constant velocity , and we can estimate the temperature by assuming blackbody radiation and a radius expanding linearly with time at the predicted velocity . for either version of the magnetar model this leads to a blackbody temperature decreasing with time , which is not what we observe for ps1 - 14bj ( figure  [ fig : bb ] ) .",
    "again , this simple calculation does not account for radiation from the magnetar itself escaping , however ; one could imagine a scenario where the late - time heating seen in ps1 - 14bj is due to such x - ray to uv breakout from the central power source .",
    "similarly , the [ ] lines could arise from o - rich ejecta being ionized from within becoming visible ; we note that ionization calculations of a pulsar wind nebula inside expanding sn ejecta predict [ ] @xmath75007 to be the strongest line in the optical window in the h- and he - free case @xcite .",
    "although these calculations were done considering the scenario of a much weaker pulsar wind nebula than the magnetar considered here , and considered the line emission at somewhat later times than our observations , it demonstrates that such a late - time optical signature of the central engine is at least plausible .",
    "interaction between the sn ejecta and h - free csm is a third alternative for powering slsne @xcite , and has been shown to reproduce the light curves of a wide range of slsne , including h - poor ones with slow evolution such as ptf12dam and sn2007bi @xcite .",
    "light curves from csm interaction depend on a number of parameters describing the mass , extent and profile of the csm , and generally requires hydrodynamical modeling outside of the scope of this paper . for an order - of - magnitude estimate of the required csm mass , we consider the simplified case of shock breakout from a dense wind described in @xcite . here , the csm profile is described as a wind with @xmath126 ( @xmath127 in cgs units ) out to some radius @xmath128 , where @xmath129 is a constant . the diffusion time @xmath130 scales with this density parameter as @xmath131  ( days ) , where @xmath92 again is the opacity . taking the observed rise time ( @xmath132  days ) as an estimate of @xmath130",
    ", for an opacity @xmath133 as in the other models , we get a density parameter @xmath134 .",
    "the wind radius @xmath128 is approximately the blackbody radius at peak ( @xmath135  cm ) ; integrating the density profile we get a required wind mass of @xmath136 .",
    "again , the derived mass scales inversely with the assumed opacity ; if we instead use @xmath137 ( appropriate for a fully ionized metal - dominated gas ) , the derived mass goes down by a factor of two .",
    "this number is subject to a lot of simplifying assumptions , but serves to illustrate that powering a light curve as luminous and as slow as ps1 - 14bj s with csm interaction will require a csm mass of tens of solar masses .",
    "alternatively , the unusually long risetime of ps1 - 14bj might also be accommodated by invoking an unusual csm density profile , as was necessary to explain the type iin sn2008iy , which had the longest measured risetime of a supernova known to date ( @xmath138  d ; @xcite ) .",
    "currently available csm interaction models ( e.g. , @xcite ) do not produce spectra that have the broad p - cygni features exhibited by ps1 - 14bj on the rise and near maximum light ( figure  [ fig : earlyspec ] ) . instead",
    ", the computed spectra tend to exhibit strong emission lines on a continuum with only narrow p - cygni features blueshifted by the wind velocity .",
    "however , only the hydrogen - rich case of slsn - ii , analogous to normal sne iin , has been explored in any detail .",
    "we do have spectra both at peak ( + 22 days ) and at late times ( + 202 days ) that go sufficiently red to cover h@xmath85 , and we do not detect h@xmath85 emission at either epoch  this indicates that the csm material around ps1 - 14bj would have to be h - poor .    rather than being the primary power source for the light curve ,",
    "csm interaction could also come into play at later times as the expanding sn ejecta encounter a previously ejected shell of material .",
    "evidence for delayed interaction with a csm shell was recently seen in the slsn iptf13ehe @xcite , which was originally classified as a sn2007bi - like slowly - evolving slsn , but developed broad h@xmath85 emission in its late - time spectra .",
    "this emission was interpreted to originate from interaction between the ejecta and a h - rich shell located at a radius @xmath139 , and from the ptf sample of slsne with late - time spectra they estimate that such interaction may be present in at least 10 - 15% of `` h - poor '' slsne . in the type ic sn2010 mb , @xcite argued that interaction with @xmath140  m@xmath98 of o - rich material was responsible for the slowly - declining light curve , blue continuum and strong [ ] @xmath75577 emission seen at late times .",
    "similarly , csm interaction could be the source of the persistent blue continuum and [ ] lines seen in ps1 - 14bj .",
    "in particular , broad [ ] emission has been seen in several core - collapse sne with interaction in years to decades after explosion and in sn remnants @xcite , and interpreted as o - rich ejecta being ionized by the reverse shock .",
    "a similar feature was recently seen in the type ib sn2014c at a phase of @xmath141  days past maximum light , also accompanied by h@xmath85 , x - ray and radio emission all consistent with csm interaction @xcite .",
    "we note that the line widths of 3000 - 4000   seen in ps1 - 14bj suggest that the [ ] emission is originating in the ejecta rather than in shocked csm , likely arising in the freely expanding ejecta being illuminated by the x - rays from the reverse shock @xcite . alternatively ,",
    "if the [ ] lines are instead originating in an oxygen - dominated csm shell , this shell would have to be moving at higher velocities than are typically seen in csm interaction in order to explain the line widths .    in the scenario where csm interaction is responsible for the late - time heating of ps1 - 14bj ,",
    "iptf13ehe @xcite makes for an interesting comparison .",
    "in particular , while the broad h@xmath85 feature in iptf13ehe was interpreted as a result of interaction , iptf13ehe did not show any corresponding [ ] features like we see in ps1 - 14bj . at face value",
    "this indicates that the temperature and density conditions in the oxygen - emitting region would be different between the two objects .",
    "we note , however , that in other sne with interaction signatures and late - time [ ] emission , the [ ] features are much weaker than h@xmath85 @xcite .",
    "if the flux ratio of h@xmath85 to [ ] was similar in iptf13ehe to these previous objects , we would not expect to see it above the noise level even if present .",
    "therefore , while we can not say much quantitatively about the ionization conditions in iptf13ehe versus ps1 - 14bj , they both illustrate the importance of late - time spectra in shedding light on the nature of slsn - i .",
    "if we assume that the [ ] lines in ps1 - 14bj are arising as a result of csm interaction , we can estimate the distance to the shell based on the time at which the features emerge and the velocities of the sn ejecta .",
    "the minimum value for the forward shock velocity is the maximum velocity in our fit to the spectrum ( @xmath142  ) , and the broad [ ] line is detected in our @xmath143 spectrum , corresponding to @xmath144  days after our estimated explosion date .",
    "this yields a shell distance of @xmath145 , similar to what was derived for iptf13ehe @xcite .",
    "we have shown that ps1 - 14bj is an unusually slowly evolving slsn with a number of peculiar properties .",
    "its key observed features can be summarized as follows :    * an exceptionally slow rise to maximum light , observed to be @xmath1  days , the longest yet reported in the literature for a h - poor slsn .",
    "independent of model , this implies a large ejecta mass . *",
    "continued slow evolution , with a nearly - flat peak and exponential decline over the first @xmath2  days past peak at a best - fit rate of @xmath66 , a remarkably close match to fully - trapped @xmath4co decay . * a peak bolometric luminosity of @xmath146  erg / s , and an estimated total radiated energy of @xmath147  erg . * unusual color evolution , with the color temperature rising prior to peak , and staying constant within our uncertainties around 8,000 - 10,000  k through the peak and decline . * a spectrum near peak dominated by features of , and , similar to other slowly - evolving slsne",
    "including sn2007bi , although with lower velocities . * a late - time spectrum ( 150 - 200 days past peak ) with strong emission features which we identify as [ ] @xmath74363 and [ ] @xmath784959,5007 , with a velocity width of 3000 - 4000  .",
    "all of these properties taken together are not easily explained by any of the single models suggested to power slsne .",
    "the long rise time , initially red colors , and decline rate initially following @xmath4co decay would support a pisn interpretation . in the classification scheme of @xcite , ps1 - 14bj is similar to other objects identified as slsn - r , such as the prototype sn2007bi @xcite .",
    "however , that scheme assumes that the underlying power source is radioactive decay to separate slsn - r from other slsn - i .",
    "here , we have shown that a model powered purely by cobalt decay can not match the colors or the late - time observations : pisn models are considerably redder than what is observed for ps1 - 14bj past peak , and predict a very different late - time spectrum than what we observe .",
    "we note that ps1 - 14bj at least demonstrates that there exist slsne with the long rise times predicted by pair - instability models , which has not been observed before . by extension",
    ", it is possible that sn2007bi may also have had a long rise - time .",
    "a simple magnetar model can reproduce the long time scales by a combination of lower magnetic field and larger ejecta mass than is typically used to fit slsne .",
    "however , this model has the same problem as the ni - powered model in explaining the near - constant rather than reddening color past peak , and generally overpredicts the late - time luminosity ( @xmath148  days past peak ) .",
    "both of these shortcomings could be overcome by relaxing the assumption that all the radiation from the magnetar is being thermalized in the ejecta ; in this scenario the late time heating would be due to emission from the pulsar wind nebula breaking out , and the [ ] lines similarly coming from inner parts of the ejecta being ionized by the central source .",
    "alternatively , the persistent blue continuum and [ ] lines could arise from material being shocked and ionized by interaction with a csm shell .",
    "such lines are often seen in core - collapse sne with csm interaction , though typically at later phases than we observe here .",
    "this scenario could be distinguished from the magnetar breakout by continued spectral monitoring as the line velocities are expected to decrease in the csm scenario , and stay constant or even increase in the magnetar case .",
    "x - ray or radio observations are another possibility .",
    "ps1 - 14bj further demonstrates the need to explore hybrid models that combine multiple power sources contributing at different points in the light curve ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "for example , @xcite proposed that interaction with csm shells emitted during the pulsational pair instability @xcite could explain the late - time h emission of iptf13ehe .",
    "our discovery of emerging [ ] features in the late - time spectrum further demonstrates the potential of late - time monitoring in revealing the nature of slsne .",
    "the discovery of a second slsn , lsq14an , with late - time features similar to ps1 - 14bj in its spectrum shows that they are not unique , and may not be rare in slowly - evolving slsne .",

    "<S> we present photometry and spectroscopy of ps1 - 14bj , a hydrogen - poor superluminous supernova ( slsn ) at redshift @xmath0 discovered in the last months of the pan - starrs1 medium deep survey . </S>",
    "<S> ps1 - 14bj stands out by its extremely slow evolution , with an observed rise of @xmath1 rest - frame days , and exponential decline out to @xmath2 days past peak at a measured rate of @xmath3 , consistent with fully - trapped @xmath4co decay . </S>",
    "<S> this is the longest rise time measured in a slsn to date , and the first slsn to show a rise time consistent with pair - instability supernova ( pisn ) models . </S>",
    "<S> compared to other slowly - evolving slsne , it is spectroscopically similar to the prototype sn2007bi at maximum light , though lower in luminosity ( @xmath5 ) and with a flatter peak than previous events . </S>",
    "<S> ps1 - 14bj shows a number of peculiar properties , including a near - constant color temperature for @xmath6 days past peak , and strong emission lines from [ ] @xmath75007 and [ ] @xmath74363 with a velocity width of @xmath83400 in its late - time spectra . </S>",
    "<S> these both suggest there is a sustained source of heating over very long timescales , and are incompatible with a simple @xmath4ni - powered / pisn interpretation . </S>",
    "<S> a modified magnetar model including emission leakage at late times can reproduce the light curve , in which case the blue continuum and [ ] features are interpreted as material heated and ionized by the inner pulsar wind nebula becoming visible at late times . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , the late - time heating could be due to interaction with a shell of h - poor circumstellar material . </S>"
