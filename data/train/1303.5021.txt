    "other sometimes more elementary representation - theoretic information requires more work to extract from standard young tableaux .",

    "we prove the following extension of the result of a.  reifegerste and j.  sjstrand :    let @xmath13 and write @xmath15 for its image under the generalized robinson - schensted map . given a primitive @xmath16 root of unity @xmath17 and the associated family @xmath18 of representations of @xmath0 , we have @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the total sum of the lengths of the even - indexed rows of the component tableaux of @xmath21 .",
    "to prove this , we define a particular set of equivalence classes on @xmath22 and show that the formula either holds or fails for all members of a given class . by construction , each class contains a representative for which the theorem is easy to verify by a direct appeal to the original symmetric group formula , thereby completing the proof .    for the classical weyl groups , all of which appear among the above complex reflection groups , the mbius function of the bruhat order can be expressed in terms of the values of the sign representation  @xcite .",
    "its use is ubiquitous in kazhdan - lusztig theory , and the above formulas allow the values of the mbius function to be read off from the images of the appropriate robinson - schensted map .",

    "similar reasoning can be applied to @xmath163 , thereby proving :    [ proposition : inversions ] a right admissible transformation changes @xmath161 by one while fixing @xmath162 for each @xmath153 , while a left admissible transformation changes @xmath164 by one while fixing @xmath165 for each @xmath153 .",
    "first note that @xmath167 for @xmath168 and consequently for each @xmath34 , @xmath169 since @xmath6 and @xmath94 are shape - based statistics and admissible transformations preserve the shapes of the underlying tableaux , the only possible difference between @xmath170 and @xmath171 lies in the signs of their left and right tableaux .",
