    "classical cepheids are among the most useful galactic and nearby extragalactic distance tracers because of their well - established period",
    " luminosity relations ( plrs ; also known as the  leavitt law  : * ? ? ?",
    "cepheids are commonly used to anchor extragalactic distances , constrain the hubble constant and study galactic structure .",
    "they also relate directly to secondary distance tracers , such as type ia supernovae , whose luminosities are calibrated using cepheids in their host galaxies @xcite .",
    "the carnegie hubble program @xcite aims at determining an accurate hubble constant based on the cepheid distance scale , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite have studied the milky way s structure in the galactic bulge based on cepheids , while @xcite and @xcite mapped the galactic spiral arms using distances to classical cepheids .",
    "cepheid plrs are not only important for measuring distances but also to constrain the pulsation physics and the evolution of cepheids .",
    "however , independent cepheid distances must be obtained , which can be achieved using ( i ) trigonometric parallaxes @xcite , ( ii ) baade  wesselink - type methods / surface - brightness techniques @xcite and ( iii ) main - sequence or isochrone fitting based on open cluster ( oc ) photometry @xcite .",
    "the oc parameters derived based on the latter method can be used as independent constraints on the distances , ages and reddening values of cepheids in these clusters .",
    "this method can also be used to study cepheids in heavily reddened environments .",
    "the key to establishing the plr using oc cepheids is to select high - confidence cluster cepheids .",
    "@xcite obtained @xmath4 plrs based on seven galactic ocs hosting cepheids , while @xcite found five oc cepheids using an eight - dimensional selection approach and obtained a @xmath5-band plr for 18 oc cepheids .",
    "@xcite found six new oc cepheids based on near - infrared ( nir ) data and derived a @xmath3-band plr for 19 oc cepheids .",
    "as more accurate data are becoming available , the number of oc cepheids is increasing , whereas the confidence of oc membership is improving simultaneously .",
    "@xcite provided new evidence to support the likely membership of the cepheid tw nor of the oc lyng 6 .",
    "@xcite discovered that su cas is a probable member of the oc alessi 95 ; @xcite conducted a detailed distance analysis of this latter oc and its member cepheids based on new x - ray and @xmath2 data .",
    "@xcite assessed the links between three cepheids and ngc 6067 based on data from the _ vista _ variables in the va lctea ( vvv ) survey .",
    "however , the number of oc cepheids that can presently be used to establish oc ",
    "cepheid plrs is still small , of order 20 .",
    "one limitation to further progress is that approximately half of the ocs in the daml02 catalogue @xcite are poorly studied .",
    "another limitation is a lack of availability of mean cepheid intensities in multiple passbands ; indeed , for many cepheids we only have access to their @xmath5-band light curves .    in this paper",
    ", we use vvv data release 1 ( dr1 ) @xcite to study faint ocs in the galactic bulge and the galactic midplane .",
    "we improve the quality of their age , reddening and distance determinations .",
    "we also convert single - epoch nir photometry to mean intensities based on application of light - curve templates .",
    "we have collected the current largest sample of 31 high - confidence oc cepheids based on nir photometry , thus enabling us to obtain the most accurate @xmath2 plrs for galactic oc cepheids to date . in fact ,",
    "in this paper we derive the first statistically meaningful oc  cepheid @xmath6- and @xmath7-band plrs ; our updated @xmath3-band plr represents a significant improvement with respect to our earlier derivation @xcite . in section 2",
    "we present the data , the method used and our oc  cepheid catalogue .",
    "section 3 discusses the oc membership characteristics of our four newly found cepheids . in section 4",
    "we discuss the cepheid @xmath2 plrs , while section 5 summarizes and concludes this paper .",
    "nir @xmath2 photometry is suitable for studies of young ocs , not only because of the small or even negligible effects expected owing to differential extinction , but also in the context of detecting heavily obscured main - sequence stars @xcite . using the two micron all - sky survey ( 2mass ) point source catalog @xcite ,",
    "thousands of oc parameters can be determined easily using main - sequence fitting .",
    "complete samples can reach distances of order 1.8 kpc @xcite . with the availability of nir surveys fainter than 2mass , such as the ukirt infrared deep sky survey ( ukidss ) dr6 galactic plane survey @xcite and vvv dr1 , even more distant",
    ", heavily reddened oc properties can be determined .",
    "the vvv survey is a @xmath8 photometric survey focussed on the galactic centre and a few fields along the galactic plane .",
    "it reaches four magnitudes fainter than 2mass . combining 2mass @xmath2 data and vvv data ,",
    "the available nir catalogues cover a range of more than 10 magnitudes , thus allowing us to study galactic stellar populations from bright cepheids to faint main - sequence dwarf stars .",
    "cepheids are young stars with ages near @xmath9 , so they can be present in young ocs . to find oc cepheids , we rely on properties such as their spatial positions , distances and proper motions , as well as their radial velocities , ages and metallicities @xcite . usually , the positions and distances are easily obtained , while proper - motion and radial - velocity data are only available for smaller numbers of specific ocs . to define our oc master sample ,",
    "we included not only the 2167 ocs in the january 2016 version of the daml02 catalogue , but also some other new ocs recently found by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . in addition , we collected all cepheids in the all - sky automated survey ( asas ) catalogue of variable stars @xcite , the general catalogue of variable stars ( gcvs ) and @xcite .",
    "positional cross - matching within 1 degree ( projected ) separation in the vvv field yielded 203 potential oc  cepheid pairs . in our next selection step",
    "we excluded cepheids that are located more than three times their host oc s apparent radius from the cluster centre , leaving 22 ocs for further analysis .    to obtain stellar samples of genuine oc members , we next proceeded with proper - motion analysis .",
    "proper - motion data were obtained from the the fourth us naval observatory ccd astrograph catalog ( ucac4 ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "stars with proper - motion errors in excess of 20 mas yr@xmath10 were excluded from our initial samples .",
    "subsequently , we calculated the average and standard deviation for all stars in the distribution so as to exclude high - proper - motion stars , adopting a 1@xmath11 selection cut .",
    "this process was repeated twice to obtain reliable proper motions for each cluster .",
    "all stars located within the 1@xmath11 proper - motion distribution were adopted as cluster members , while for some ocs with fewer than 100 stars within the 1@xmath11 distribution , we selected all stars inside the 2@xmath11 distribution instead .",
    "we then selected cepheids located within the 1@xmath11 proper - motion distribution of their host clusters for further analysis : see fig .",
    "[ c2f1.fig ] . to select genuine cluster members",
    ", we plotted the ( @xmath12 ) colour  magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) , combining 2mass and vvv data .",
    "vvv @xmath2 magnitudes were converted to the 2mass @xmath2 system following the prescriptions recommended by the cambridge astronomy survey unit .    for clusters exhibiting obvious main sequences , distances , reddening values and ages can be determined by fitting the cluster sequences with padova isochrones @xcite .",
    "since ocs generally belong to a relatively young milky way population , their metallicities are comparably high , on the order of the solar value . in addition",
    ", metallicity - dependent variations in the derived cluster parameters , including the ages and distances , are small ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "hence , we adopted solar metallicity .",
    "the scatter in the cluster sequences is mainly caused by differential reddening and the consequently faint stellar luminosities .",
    "we applied our isochrone fitting in an automated fashion to determine the smallest residuals pertaining to the parameter space defined by the cluster ages , reddening values and distance moduli .    for a given isochrone defined by a specific age , reddening and distance modulus ,",
    "our fitting procedure consisted of four steps .",
    "first , we linearly resampled ( interpolated ) the theoretical isochrone such that the intervals between two adjacent points were about 0.01 mag .",
    "second , we selected the nearest isochrone point to every observed data point and determined the distance between each pair of points thus selected . based on the mean distance and standard deviation , obvious field stars beyond the distribution s 1@xmath11 range were excluded .",
    "third , we calculated the mean distance and standard deviation for this initial , cleaned data set . for bright stars , @xmath13 mag , we adopted stars located within the 2@xmath11 range as cluster members ; for fainter stars , the selection criterion was established independently for every 0.1 mag bin between @xmath14 mag and @xmath15 mag .",
    "the standard deviation increases from bright to faint magnitudes .",
    "stars found within the 1@xmath11 range in each bin were selected as high - probability oc members .",
    "these cluster members are shown in the rightmost panel of fig .",
    "[ c2f2.fig ] . finally , we calculated the uncertainty in the colour excess , the error in the apparent distance modulus and the overall uncertainty .",
    "next , we allowed the age ( 0.1 dex age resolution ) , reddening ( 0.01 mag resolution ) and distance modulus ( 0.1 mag resolution ) to vary freely in order to find the best fit , i.e. , the result defined by the smallest overall error .",
    "figure [ c2f2.fig ] shows , from left to right and for all four newly found ocs hosting cepheids , the original cmds , the control - field cmds , the cleaned cmds and the cmds resulting from our automated fitting .",
    "the original cmds are composed of stars located in the cluster regions and based on 2mass and vvv data .",
    "the control fields are located at least twice the cluster radius from the cluster centre , and the size of the control field is the same as that of the cluster field .",
    "since the vvv fields are very well populated , the control fields could be used to statistically correct for field stars .",
    "the cleaned cmds show the candidate cluster members , resulting from having statistically subtracted the control fields from the cluster fields .",
    "they exhibit obvious cluster sequences from the saturation magnitude ( @xmath16 mag ) to @xmath17 mag .",
    "these sequences are comparable to the sequences resulting from our automated fits ( see the rightmost panels in fig .",
    "[ c2f2.fig ] ) .",
    "this confirms that the cluster sequences selected by our automated fits are statistically reliable .",
    "we did not fit the field - star - subtracted sequence directly , because the reliable range of object magnitudes is small , and so is the number of sources in the subtracted sequence . since the vvv survey images were taken with very short exposure times",
    ", it is more appropriate ( and more statistically meaningful ) to perform statistical analyses of large samples instead of analyses based on a smaller number of specific , extracted sources .",
    "the basic physical oc parameters thus obtained are included in table [ c2table2 ] .",
    "they form the basis for our oc ",
    "cepheid selection .",
    "upon application of all selection criteria , four high - confidence oc ",
    "cepheid pairs remain : see fig .",
    "[ c2f2.fig ] , where we show the approximate locations of the clusters instability strips .",
    "oc cepheids must be located inside the instability strip of their host cluster .     and 0.5@xmath11 radii of the clusters proper motions .",
    "black dots : stars with uncertainties smaller than our error cut of 15 mas yr@xmath10 ( the typical 1@xmath11 uncertainty in the proper - motion catalogue is 45 mas yr@xmath10 ) .",
    "blue dots : cluster members located inside the 1@xmath11 ( well - populated ocs ) or 2@xmath11 radii ( sparsely populated ocs ) .",

    "the availability of vvv dr1 provides a unique opportunity to uncover and study faint and highly obscured ocs in the galactic plane near the galactic centre . using the daml02 oc catalogue and other new ocs found in the vvv data",
    ", we have carefully examined 22 ocs and discovered four new oc cepheids .",
    "parameters such as distances , reddening values and ages were better determined compared with previous work based on isochrone fitting . by comparison of distances , apparent positions , proper motions and ages of the clusters and cepheids , the newly found oc ",

    "@xmath1 [ days ]  thus far found in an oc , which is important in the context of constraining the slope of the plr .",
    "the currently most complete nir cepheid plrs based on 31 oc cepheids were obtained ( a significant improvement from the previous plrs which were based on up to 19 oc cepheids ) , i.e. , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the associated uncertainties have been improved by 40 per cent compared with previous cepheid plrs based on the oc - matching method .",
    "our plrs are in good agreement with the best nir plrs available for all galactic cepheids obtained using other methods . particularly in the @xmath7 band ,",
    "the zero - point differences are very small ; differences of less than 0.06 mag are expected for any cepheid .",
    "since there are more than 20,000 cepheids and 20,000 ocs in the galaxy , we expect that thousands of oc cepheids will be discovered in the future .",
    "_ gaia _ will observe some 9000 cepheids @xcite , which will improve the distances , proper motions and radial velocities of not only the cepheids but also their host clusters . by combining the more accurate parallax distances from _ gaia _ with oc distances based on isochrone fitting ,",
    "the cepheid plrs will be left with only small systematic errors .",
