    "according to shannon formula : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the channel capacity , @xmath2 is the channel bandwidth , @xmath3 is the signal power , and @xmath4 is the noise power .",
    "we can see that the most effective way to increase the channel capacity is increasing bandwidth , and enhance the signal - to - noise ratio can also increase the channel capacity .    in current communication systems , to take full advantage of the spectrum ,",
    "carrier modulation technology is used .",
    "the principle of current carrier modulation is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , the real part of the baseband complex signal multiplied by @xmath5 and the imaginary part multiplied by @xmath6 , then add , as the following formula : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the modulation signal , @xmath9 is the carrier signal , @xmath10 is the baseband complex signal , @xmath11 is to take the real part . obviously in the current carrier modulation , although the baseband signal is complex , the carrier signal is complex , but the modulation signal is taken the real part , so a real signal is sent . in this paper",
    "it is called real - carrier modulation .",
    "in fact , the real - carrier modulation technology wastes a half of the spectrum resources and the signal energy , that is because of the incorrect understanding and using of negative frequency .",
    "so far , in all current communication systems , including wireless , cable and fiber the available bandwidth is defined in the positive spectrum .",
    "for example , the bandwidth defined in the latest version of lte protocol , see @xcite , negative spectrum is not used .",
    "so to make full use of spectrum resources , we must first rectify the understanding of the negative frequency .",
    "the negative frequency has a physical meaning , see @xcite . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , we define the angle of counterclockwise rotation as @xmath12 , the angle of clockwise rotation as @xmath13 , so the definition of angular frequency is : @xmath14 @xmath15 by ( [ eq3 ] ) , ( [ eq4 ] ) we can see that the positive angular frequency corresponds to the speed of counterclockwise rotation , the negative angular frequency corresponds to the speed of clockwise rotation , so `` negative angular frequency '' does not due to the `` negative time '' , but due to `` negative angle '' , positive and negative frequency represent two different directions of rotation in a plane , there are two kinds of frequencies is essentially because of the angle is defined in a plane , a plane has two sides .    with the understanding of the physical meaning of negative frequency , then how to distinguish between positive and negative frequencies , or how to describe these two directions of rotations in a plane ? that is the euler formula : @xmath16    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are two kinds of complex - frequency signals , corresponding to the negative and positive frequency signals .",
    "although in the `` time - complex '' direct product space , it is easy to distinguish positive and negative frequency signals , but in `` time - real '' direct product space , the projection of positive and negative frequency signals are the same real - frequency signal @xmath5 , that is : @xmath19 so when we see a real - frequency signal , we can not distinguish it between positive or negative frequency signals from its projection , the probability of the frequency signal being negative or positive is equal , it is 1/2 , that is : @xmath20 similarly : @xmath21 therefore , a real - frequency signal @xmath5 or @xmath22 is not complete , the complete description of a frequency signal must be a rotating complex - frequency signal @xmath23 , in complete description , the negative frequency signal @xmath24 and positive frequency signal @xmath25 are two distinguishable and independent frequency signals , they can carry different information .    in this paper , we define the positive frequency , which direction of rotation meet the right hand rule as the r - frequency .",
    "we define the negative frequency , which direction of rotation meet the left hand rule as the l - frequency . unless otherwise cited , this paper will use the terms l - frequency and r - frequency , l - band and r - band instead of the positive frequency and negative frequency , positive band and negative band .",
    "in this section , we will see that the current real - carrier modulation technology occupies all the l - band and r - band in the spectrum , so a half of the spectrum resources are wasted , and the current real - carrier demodulation technology only receives one of the l - band or r - band , so a half of the signal energy is lost .",
    "the principle of current real - carrier modulation is as formula ( [ eq2 ] ) .",
    "it is modulated by the r - frequency signal @xmath25 , according to the formula ( [ eq7 ] ) and ( [ eq8 ] ) :    @xmath26    where @xmath27 is the modulation signal , @xmath28 is the baseband signal , @xmath29 is the conjugated baseband signal , @xmath18 is the r - frequency signal .",
    "according to the multiplication of two signals in time domain is equivalent to their convolution in frequency domain , it can be seen from the above equation that the real - carrier modulation will move the baseband to the r - band and l - band , and the signal energy is divided equally .",
    "therefore , after being modulated by the r - frequency signal @xmath18 and taking the real part , the r - band signal is the same as the baseband signal , and the amplitude is a half , the l - band signal is conjugated symmetry to the baseband signal , and the amplitude is also a half .    similarly , if it is modulated by the l - frequency signal @xmath30 : @xmath31 where @xmath27 is the modulation signal , @xmath28 is the baseband signal , @xmath29 is the conjugated baseband signal , @xmath30 is the l - frequency signal .",
    "therefore , after modulated by the l - frequency signal @xmath30 and take the real part , the l - band signal is the same as the baseband signal , and the amplitude is a half , the r - band signal is conjugated symmetry to the baseband signal , and the amplitude is also a half .    in summary",
    ", the real - carrier modulation occupies all the l - band and r - band , and the information on the l - band and r - band are conjugated symmetric , not independent , and the signal energy is a half on each side .",
    "furthermore , currently people regard one of the bands as a `` image frequency component '' , as if it is not reality , in fact , the `` image frequency '' is caused by using the incomplete real - frequency signal as the carrier signal .",
    "a demo of band move of the real - carrier modulation is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , modulated by the r - frequency signal , amplitude spectrum .",
    "the current real - carrier demodulation also assumed to receive a real signal , so it is dealt as a real signal . as the real - carrier modulation does not distinguish l - frequency and r - frequency ,",
    "so the modulation signal maybe modulated by the l - frequency signal or the r - frequency signal , here assume the modulation signal is modulated by the r - frequency signal , as formula ( [ eq9 ] ) .",
    "if demodulated by the l - frequency signal @xmath17 , according to the formula ( [ eq9 ] ) : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the demodulation signal , @xmath27 is the modulation signal , @xmath28 is the baseband signal , @xmath29 is the conjugated baseband signal , @xmath17 is the l - frequency signal .",
    "after demodulation , the l - band @xmath34 is moved to two times far away and the r - band @xmath35 is moved to the baseband , after a low - pass filter , the l - band signal energy is discarded .",
    "similarly , if demodulated by the r - frequency signal @xmath18 , according to the formula ( [ eq9 ] ) : @xmath36 where @xmath33 is the demodulation signal , @xmath27 is the modulation signal , @xmath28 is the baseband signal , @xmath29 is the conjugated baseband signal , @xmath18 is the r - frequency signal .",
    "after demodulation , the r - band @xmath35 is moved to two times far away and the l - band @xmath34 is moved to the baseband , after a low - pass filter , the r - band signal energy is discarded . but the reserved l - band signal is conjugated to original signal .",
    "although information on the l - band and r - band is conjugated , but filtering out one of them will lost a half of signal energy .",
    "a demo of band move of the real - carrier demodulation is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , demodulated by the l - frequency signal , amplitude spectrum .",
    "as mentioned earlier , the complete description of a frequency signal is a rotating complex - frequency signal , in a complete descriptions , the l - frequency signal @xmath37 and r - frequency signal @xmath18 are two distinguishable and independent frequency signals , so they can carry different information .",
    "therefore , we can modulate the baseband signals by the l - frequency or r - frequency signal , in order to distinguish from the real - carrier modulation , it is called complex - carrier modulation in this paper . because there are two kinds of frequencies , so there are two kinds of complex - carrier modulations , in this paper the modulation using the l - frequency signal is called l - complex modulation",
    ", the modulation using the r - frequency signal is called r - complex modulation .    in this section",
    ", we will see that compared with the real - carrier modulation , the complex - carrier modulation uses the distinguishable and independent l - frequency signal @xmath37 and r - frequency signal @xmath18 as the carrier signal , they can carry different information , so the spectrum resources are full used , the signal energy carried by complex - carrier modulation is focused on a certain band , so the signal energy will not be lost by the complex - carrier demodulation .",
    "there are two kinds of complex - carrier modulation , l - complex modulation and r - complex modulation .",
    "the principle of l - complex modulation is as the following formula :    @xmath38    where @xmath27 is the complex - carrier modulation signal , @xmath28 is baseband signal , @xmath17 is the l - frequency signal .    similarly , the principle of r - complex modulation is as the following formula :    @xmath39    where @xmath27 is the complex - carrier modulation signal , @xmath28 is baseband signal , @xmath18 is the r - frequency signal .",
    "band move of the l - complex modulation is shown in fig .",
    "band move of the r - complex modulation is similar and omitted .",
    "the l - frequency and r - frequency are two distinguishable and independent frequency signals , so they can carry different information .",
    "the band move of carrying two different information is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , the baseband a and b are moved to l - band and r - band separately .    according to the formula ( [ eq13 ] ) the principle of l - complex modulation",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] :    it can be seen from the figure , the real part and the imaginary part of the l - complex modulation signal are modulated separately , they are two orthogonal signals in space , so the l - complex modulation signals in the transmission medium are the left rotating complex signals .",
    "the principle of r - complex modulation is similar and omitted .",
    "in essence , the principle of complex - carrier modulation and demodulation are the same , they are simply band moves , but in opposite directions .",
    "so the l - complex modulation signal is demodulated by the r - frequency signal , and the r - complex modulation signal is demodulated by the l - frequency signal .",
    "the l - complex modulation signal is demodulated by the r - frequency signal as the following formula : @xmath40 where @xmath33 is the demodulation signal , @xmath18 is the r - frequency signal , @xmath27 is the modulation signal , @xmath28 is baseband signal .",
    "the band move of the demodulation for the l - complex modulation signal is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] .",
    "the r - complex modulation signal is demodulated by the l - frequency signal as the following formula : @xmath41 where @xmath33 is the demodulation signal , @xmath37 is the l - frequency signal , @xmath27 is the modulation signal , @xmath28 is baseband signal .",
    "the band move of the demodulation for the r - complex modulation signal is similar and omitted .",
    "the different information on the l - band and r - band can be demodulated separately , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] .      as mentioned earlier , in essence , the principle of complex - carrier modulation and demodulation are the same , they are band moves .",
    "so in this paper , we use a single word `` band - move '' instead of the modulation and demodulation .",
    "furthermore , band - move is a transformation , it is the rotational speed transform in time domain , the move transform in frequency domain . like",
    "the reference system transform , we can see , the frequency is a relative value , its value is related to the reference frequency , as the following formula : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the frequency after transform , @xmath18 is the frequency before transform , @xmath44 is the reference frequency .    thus , a `` negative frequency '' can become a `` positive frequency '' after the band - move transform , which also confirms , on the other hand , that the `` negative frequency '' has a physical meaning , and the `` sign '' of a frequency is related to the reference frequency .",
    "the transformation has the following properties :    1 : the additive property , one band - move is equivalent to the sum of several band - moves , as the following formula : @xmath45 where @xmath27 is the band - move signal , @xmath28 is the original signal .",
    "2 : the commutative property , the result of several band - moves has nothing to do with the orders , as the following formula : @xmath46 where @xmath27 is the band - move signal , @xmath28 is the original signal .",
    "so the transformations of band - move make up a continuous abel group .",
    "from this section , we will see that the circularly polarized electromagnetic signals are exactly the complex - frequency signals , the right - hand and left - hand circularly polarized electromagnetic signals correspond to the r - frequency and l - frequency signals .    as we all know",
    ", light is electromagnetic wave , and the right - hand circularly polarized light wavefront is described as the following formula : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is electric vector , @xmath49 is the electric intensity , @xmath50 is the angular frequency , @xmath51 is the propagate distance , @xmath52 is the wavelength , @xmath53 is the initial phase .",
    "assume we observed this light at a certain place , that means @xmath51 is a constant , so @xmath54 is a constant , it can be seen as a initial phase @xmath55 , so the ( [ eq20 ] ) can be change to the following formula : @xmath56 it is a r - frequency @xmath57 which has a initial phase @xmath55 and a non - normalized amplitude @xmath49 .",
    "also we can see it contains a real part @xmath58 and a imaginary part @xmath59 , so the right - hand circularly polarized light is a complex - frequency signal , and the real part and imaginary part are orthogonal in space , that means we can send a complex - frequency signal by a circularly polarized signal .",
    "the right - hand circularly polarized light is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] , it is the same as the fig . [ fig3 ] .",
    "similarly , we can see the left - hand circularly polarized light is the r - frequency signal .",
    "furthermore , the linearly polarized electromagnetic signal is the real - frequency signal .",
    "so we can send out the r - band and l - band signals by the right - hand and left - hand circularly polarized electromagnetic signals .    by the way , formula ( [ eq20 ] )",
    "is a solution of schrodinger equation , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] , we can see , here `` i '' has a clearly physical meaning , it means orthogonal in space , not imaginary .",
    "in summary , we draw the following conclusions :      2 : a complete description of a frequency signal is a rotating complex - frequency signal , in a complete description , r - frequency signal and l - frequency signal are two distinguishable and independent frequency signals .                      due to the complex - carrier modulation and demodulation technology",
    "can make full use of the spectrum , and do not discard the signal energy , therefore , facing with the scarce of the spectrum resources , we sure that the complex - carrier modulation and demodulation technology will become the mainstream of the next - generation communication technology .",
    "for example , in the current lte technology , if the two code - words are modulated by the l - band and r - band separately , then clearly the channel capacity will be greatly improved .",
    "for another example , if up - link and down - link are modulated by the l - band and r - band separately , then up - link and down - link can communicate using the same frequency at the same time ."
