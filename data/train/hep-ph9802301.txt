    "considerable progress have been made over the last ten years or so , in our understanding of the spin structure of the nucleon .",
    "this is essentially due to a better determination of the polarized structure functions @xmath0 , from polarized deep - inelastic - scattering ( _ dis _ ) on different targets ( hydrogen , deuterium , helium-3 ) .",
    "however these fixed polarized targets experiments @xcite , performed at _ cern _ , _ desy _ and _ slac _ , cover only a limited kinematic region , that is @xmath1 , with the corresponding average @xmath2 between @xmath3 and @xmath4 . in spite of the constant progress realized in the accuracy of the data , they can still be described , non uniquely , in terms of several sets of polarized parton distributions .",
    "in particular , sea quark , antiquark and gluon distributions remain highly ambiguous .",
    "the restricted @xmath5 range accessible by the data makes also rather difficult , sensible tests of the @xmath5 evolution , predicted by recent higher order _ qcd _ calculations .",
    "moreover it is not possible to obtain a good flavor separation , to isolate the contribution of each quark to the nucleon spin .",
    "polarized hadronic collisions , which are another way to investigate this research field , have accomplished little progress due to the scarcity of the data in appropriate kinematic regions , and a low energy range , so far accessible to very few dedicated experiments .",
    "let us recall that the highest energy for studying polarized @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) collisions has been obtained at fermilab by the _ e704 _",
    "experiment @xcite with a @xmath8 polarized proton ( antiproton ) beam on a fixed target , that is @xmath9 .",
    "this situation will change drastically soon when the _ rhic _ facility at _ bnl _ will start running , by 1999 or so , part of the time as a polarized @xmath6 collider .",
    "a vast spin programme will be undertaken by the two large detectors _ phenix _ and _ star _",
    ", which will operate at _ rhic _ and also by the @xmath10 experiment , dedicated to @xmath6 elastic and total cross sections . before we go on and explain very briefly what will be done ,",
    "let us recall three key parameters , which will be crucial to answer some of the very challenging questions .",
    "the proton beam polarization @xmath11 will be maintained at the level of 70% , in both _",
    "longitudinal _ and _ transverse _ directions , the center - of - mass energy @xmath12 will be ranging between @xmath13 and @xmath14 and at its maximum value , the luminosity is expected to reach _ l_=@xmath15 .",
    "the _ siberian snakes _ magnets which preserve the degree of polarization in the _ rhic _ main rings and the _ spin rotators _ which select the beam spin direction , are under construction thanks to a substantial financial contribution from the japanese institute _ riken _ in collaboration with _ bnl_. the high luminosity will allow very copious effective yields for different reactions ( @xmath16 , jet , @xmath17 production , etc ... ) and therefore the measurement of the corresponding spin asymmetries will be made to a very good level of accuracy , in the kinematic regions relevant for _ qcd _ spin tests .",
    "the spin programme at _ rhic _ will provide answers to fundamental questions which will be listed now in turn .",
    "in the next section we will recall some basic definitions of the helicity asymmetries .",
    "section 3 will be devoted to prompt photon production and jet production , which will allow the first direct determination of the gluon helicity distribution @xmath18 inside a polarized nucleon .",
    "next we will show in section 4 , how antiquark helicity distributions @xmath19 can be isolated in @xmath17 production , which leads also to the _ u - d _ flavor separation .",
    "this has been done , rather inaccurately , in semi - inclusive _",
    "dis_. from transversely polarized proton beams , as we will see in section 5 , it is possible to make the first measurement of the transversity distributions @xmath20 in drell - yan lepton pair production .",
    "finally , in section 6 we will indicate the relevance of the parity violating asymmetry in single jet production .",
    "it might provide a clean signature for new physics and , as an example , we will consider the possible effects of a quark - quark contact interaction .",
    "fundamental interactions at short distances which are explored in high energy hadronic collisions , involve hard scattering of quarks , antiquarks and gluons .",
    "let us consider the general hadronic reaction @xmath21 where @xmath22 , in the cases we will consider below , is either a photon , a @xmath23 , a @xmath17 or a single - jet .",
    "in the hard scattering kinematic region , the cross section describing ( 1 ) reads in the _ qcd _ parton model , provided factorization holds , as @xmath24 .",
    "% \\end{array}\\ ] ]    the summation runs over all contributing parton configurations , the @xmath25 s are the parton distributions , directly extracted from _",
    "dis _ for quarks and antiquarks and indirectly for gluons . here",
    "d@xmath26 is the cross section for the interaction of two partons @xmath27 and @xmath28 which can be calculated perturbatively , some of which , at the lowest order , are given in ref.@xcite . if we consider the reaction ( 1 ) with _ both _ initial hadrons , @xmath29 and @xmath30 longitudinally polarized , one useful observable is the _",
    "double _ helicity asymmetry @xmath31 defined as @xmath32 when we assume parity conservation , i.e. d@xmath33 = d@xmath34 .",
    "its explicit expression , assuming factorization , is given by @xmath35 , \\ ] ] where d@xmath36 is given by eq.(2 ) and @xmath37 denotes the corresponding subprocess double asymmetry for initial partons @xmath27 and @xmath28 . the @xmath38 s are defined as @xmath39 where @xmath40 are the parton distributions in a polarized hadron with helicity either parallel ( + ) or antiparallel ( - ) to the parent hadron helicity . recall that the unpolarized distributions are @xmath41 and @xmath38 measures how much the parton @xmath42 `` remembers '' the parent hadron helicity .",
    "if the subprocess involves parity violating interactions , one can consider another interesting observable which requires only _ one _ initial hadron polarized , that is the _ single _ helicity asymmetry @xmath43 , defined as @xmath44 in addition , if both @xmath29 and @xmath30 are polarized one can also have two _ double _ helicity parity violating asymmetries defined as @xmath45 which can be simply related to @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "several sets of polarized parton densities @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) have been proposed in the recent literature [ 5 - 10 ] .",
    "using some of these parametrizations to calculate helicity asymmetries for various processes , we will show how the _ rhic - bnl _ spin programme will be able , in particular , to pin down the polarized helicity distributions which remain badly constrained by polarized _",
    "_ experiments .",
    "the cross section for direct photon production on @xmath6 collisions at high @xmath48 is considered as one of the cleanest probe of the unpolarized gluon distribution @xmath49 .",
    "this is partly due to the fact that the photon originates in the hard scattering subprocess and is detected without undergoing fragmentation .",
    "moreover in @xmath6 collisions the quark - gluon compton subprocess @xmath50 dominates largely and the quark - antiquark annihilation subprocess @xmath51 can be neglected .",
    "consequently the double helicity asymmetry @xmath52 ( see eq.(4 ) ) , which involves in this case only one subprocess , becomes particularly simple to calculate and is expected to be strongly sensitive to the sign and magnitude of @xmath18 . for the compton subprocess , @xmath53",
    "whose expression at the lowest order is given in ref.@xcite , is always positive and such that @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the center of mass ( c.m . )",
    "angle in the subprocess .    in fig .",
    "1 we show a complete comparison of the results we obtained for the @xmath56 distribution of @xmath57 , at pseudo rapidity @xmath58 , using the different sets of polarized parton distributions we have mentioned in the previous section , with a leading order @xmath5 evolution . actually we find that the smallest predictions are obtained from the sets ref.@xcite and ref.@xcite which have the smallest @xmath59 .",
    "the predictions differ substantially at large @xmath48 , which corresponds to the region , say around @xmath60 or so , where the distributions @xmath61 have rather different shapes .",
    "we have also indicated the expected statistical errors based on an integrated luminosity @xmath62 pb@xmath63 at @xmath64 gev , for three months running time .",
    "we have evaluated the event rates in the pseudo - rapidity gap @xmath65 , assuming a detector efficiency of 100% and for a @xmath56 acceptance @xmath66 gev / c .",
    "we see that up to @xmath67 gev / c or so , @xmath52 will be determined with an error less than 5% which therefore will allow to distinguish between these different possible @xmath68 . for very large @xmath56 , the event rate drops too much to provide any sensitivity in the determination of @xmath61 .",
    "the pseudo - rapidity distribution of @xmath69 at a fixed @xmath56 value has been also calculated in ref.(@xcite ) and it shows a systematic increase of @xmath52 for higher @xmath70 .",
    "inclusive jet production is also a physics area where one can learn a lot about parton densities and , considering the vast amount of unpolarized existing data , it has been regarded as an important qcd testing ground .",
    "event rates are much larger than for prompt photon production , but there is a drawback because many subprocesses are involved , unlike in the previous case . in principle one should take into account gluon - gluon ( @xmath71 ) , gluon - quark ( @xmath72 ) and quark - quark ( @xmath73 ) scatterings . although these subprocesses cross sections are not so much different , after convolution with the appropriate parton densities ( see eq.(2 ) ) , they lead to very distinct contributions to the hadronic spin - average cross section . here",
    "we will restrict ourselves to the double helicity asymmetry @xmath74 for single jet production and in order to clarify the interpretation of our results below , let us recall some simple dynamical features",
    ". in the very low @xmath75 region , say @xmath76 gev / c or so , @xmath71 scattering dominates by far , but its contribution drops down very rapidly with increasing @xmath75 . in the medium @xmath75 range , say 20 gev / c @xmath77 gev / c or so , @xmath72 scattering dominates and then decreases for large @xmath75 , to be overcome by @xmath73 scattering .",
    "of course these are rough qualitative considerations and accurate numerical estimates for the relative fractions of these different contributions depend strongly on the parton densities one uses.let us look at @xmath78 and , from the above discussion , we see that in the medium @xmath75 range where @xmath72 scattering dominates , @xmath78 should have a trend similar to @xmath79 , with perhaps a magnitude reduced by a factor two , since about half of the jet cross section is due to @xmath71 and @xmath73 scatterings .",
    "this is what we see approximately in fig.2 , where we present the numerical results for @xmath78 at @xmath80 gev , which should be compared to fig.1 .",
    "we have also indicated the statistical errors which are extremely small in this case , because of the huge event rates .",
    "let us now consider , for the reaction @xmath83 , the parity violating single helicity asymmetry @xmath43 defined in eq.(6 ) . in the standard model ,",
    "the @xmath84 gauge boson is a purely left - handed object and this asymmetry reads simply for @xmath17 production @xmath85 assuming the proton @xmath29 is polarized .",
    "here we have @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 . for @xmath89 production",
    "the quark flavors are interchanged ( @xmath90 ) .",
    "the calculation of these asymmetries is therefore very simple and the results are presented in figs.3,4 at @xmath80 gev , for different sets of distributions . as first noticed in ref.@xcite , the general trend of @xmath43 can be easily understood as follows : at @xmath91 one has @xmath92 evaluated at @xmath93 , for @xmath94 one has @xmath95 evaluated at @xmath96 and for @xmath97 one has @xmath98 evaluated at @xmath99 .",
    "therefore these measurements will allow a fairly clean flavor separation , both for quarks and antiquarks , for some interesting ranges of @xmath100 values .",
    "we see in fig.3 that @xmath101 , which is driven by the @xmath102 and @xmath103 polarizations , leads to similar predictions for all cases .",
    "this is mainly due to our knowledge of @xmath104 , except for @xmath105 where it comes out to be larger for the set proposed in ref.@xcite . in fig.4 , for @xmath106 which is sensitive to the @xmath107 and @xmath108 polarizations , we see that the various predictions lead to the same general trend , with some differences in magnitude due to a large uncertainty in the determination of @xmath109 .",
    "also in ref.@xcite , one has assumed a larger negative @xmath110 , which is reflected in the behaviour near @xmath94 .",
    "the statistical errors have been calculated with a rapidity resolution @xmath111 and taking into account only the events from the leptonic decay modes .",
    "they are smaller for @xmath112 production which has larger event rates .",
    "the existence of @xmath113 for quarks ( @xmath114 for antiquarks ) was first detected in a systematic study of the drell - yan process with polarized beams @xcite and some of its relevant properties were discussed later in various papers @xcite .",
    "pretty much like @xmath115 and @xmath116 , the transversity distributions @xmath117 are of fundamental importance for our understanding of the nucleon structure and they are all leading - twist distributions . due",
    "to scaling violations , these quark distributions depend also on the scale @xmath118 and their @xmath5-behavior is predicted by the _",
    "qcd _ evolution equations .",
    "they are different in the three cases but , due to lake of time , we will not discuss here this important question@xcite .",
    "we recall that @xmath119 ( or @xmath120 ) are not simply accessible in _ dis _ because they are in fact chiral - odd distributions , contrarely to @xmath121 and @xmath81 which are chiral - even  @xcite .",
    "however they can be extracted from polarized drell - yan processes with two transversely polarized proton beams . for lepton pair production @xmath122 @xmath123 mediated by a virtual photon @xmath124 ,",
    "the double transverse - spin asymmetry @xmath125 defined , similarly to eq.(3 ) , as @xmath126 , reads    @xmath127    where @xmath128 is the partonic asymmetry calculable in perturbative _ qcd _ and @xmath129 is the dilepton mass .",
    "the rapidity @xmath130 of the dilepton is @xmath131 , and for @xmath91 one has @xmath132 .",
    "note that this is a leading - order expression , which can be used to get a first estimate of @xmath133 from different theoretical results for @xmath134 and @xmath135 .",
    "if the lepton pair is mediated by a @xmath23 gauge boson , one has a similar expression for @xmath136 @xcite , namely @xmath137 where @xmath138 and @xmath139 are the vector and axial couplings of the flavor @xmath140 to the @xmath23 .",
    "however in the case of @xmath17 production one expects @xmath141 , because the @xmath84 gauge boson is a pure left - handed object ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath142 ) , which does not allow a left - right interference effect associated to the existence of @xmath143 @xcite .",
    "we show in fig.5 some predictions , at leading and next to leading orders , for @xmath144 , together with some expected statistical errors , where one sees a characteristic effect in the @xmath23 mass region .",
    "the asymmetry is only a few percents , due to the smallness of @xmath114 , but this is a real challenge for the experiment .",
    "let us consider again one - jet inclusive production .",
    "as discussed in section 3 , the cross section is dominated by the pure _ qcd _ subprocesses @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 scatterings , but the existence of the electroweak ( _ ew _ ) interaction , via the effects of the @xmath145 gauge bosons , adds to it , a small contribution .",
    "consequently , the parity violating asymmetry @xmath146 defined in eq.(7 ) and resulting from the _ qcd - ew _ interference is non - zero , as shown in fig.6 ( see curve _ sm _ ) and has a small structure near @xmath147 .    now if we introduce a new contact interaction , belonging purely to the quark sector and normalized to a certain compositeness scale @xmath148 , under the form @xmath149 where @xmath150 is a quark doublet and @xmath151 .",
    "if parity is not conserved @xmath152 and we show in fig.6 , how the _ sm _ prediction will be affected by such a new interaction assuming @xmath153 . as expected , the errors are large in the high @xmath154 region , but if the observation of such a signal is confirmed , it will be extremely important .",
