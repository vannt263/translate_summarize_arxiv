    "there are several obvious generalizations : one can replace @xmath6 by any integer @xmath7 ; one can allow several wavelet functions @xmath8 ; and one can consider an orthonormal basis for a closed subspace of @xmath3 .",
    "there have also been several publications of wavelets in higher dimensions , cf @xcite to name few .",
    "one of the differences in higher dimensions is that we now have many more choices in the sets of dilations and translations .",

    "@xmath19 stands for the fourier transform @xmath20 we will often write @xmath21 for the fourier transform of @xmath22 .    the most natural starting point is to consider groups of dilations and full rank lattices as translation sets",
