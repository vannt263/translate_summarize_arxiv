    "universality is sometimes expressed in a somehow defectively simple way : some critical properties ( the universal ones ) of a system are given by space dimensionality and the local properties ( i.e. near the identity element ) of the coset space @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the symmetry group of the high temperature phase and @xmath5 is the remaining symmetry group of the broken phase ( low temperature ) .",
    "as we shall discuss , the subtle point making the above statement not straightforward to use , is that @xmath4 needs not to be the symmetry group of the microscopic hamiltonian , but that of the coarse - grained fixed - point action .    on the spirit of the above statement , some time ago  @xcite",
    "a seemingly complete classification was obtained of the universality classes of three dimensional systems where @xmath4=o(3 ) . in this picture",
    ", a phase transition of a vector model , with o(3 ) global symmetry and with an o(2 ) low temperature phase symmetry , in three dimensions must belong to the o(3)/o(2 ) scheme of symmetry breaking ( classical heisenberg model ) .",
    "in addition , if @xmath5=o(1)=z@xmath6 is the remaining symmetry , the corresponding scheme should be o(4)/o(3 ) which is locally isomorphic to o(3)/o(1 ) .",
    "are irrelevant , only the local properties matter . ]",
    "this classification has been challenged by the chiral models@xcite .",
    "however , the situation is still hotly debated : some authors believe that the chiral transitions are weakly first - order@xcite , while others claim@xcite that the chiral universality class exists , implying the relevance of the global properties of @xmath3 .    in this letter",
    ", we shall consider the three dimensional antiferromagnetic ( afm ) @xmath2 model  @xcite , a model displaying a second - order phase transition and escaping from the previously expressed paradigm .",
    "it is worth recalling  @xcite that one of the phase transitions found in models for colossal magnetorresistance oxides  @xcite belongs to the universality class of the afm @xmath2 model .",
    "the microscopic hamiltonian of this model has a global o(3 ) symmetry group , while the low temperature phase has , at least , a remaining o(2 ) symmetry  @xcite .",
    "we will show here that the model belongs to the universality class of the three dimensional o(5 ) non linear @xmath1 model .",
    "some ground for this arises from a hand - waving argument , suggested to us by one of the referees of ref .",
    "@xcite ( see below ) .",
    "the universality class of the three dimensional o(5 ) non linear @xmath1 model has received less attention that @xmath7 models with @xmath8 and @xmath9 . in spite of that , it has been recently argued that @xmath0 could be relevant for the high - temperature superconducting cuprates  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , perturbative field theoretic - methods have been used to estimate the critical exponents  @xcite . from the numerical side ,",
    "only a rather unconvincing monte carlo simulation  @xcite was available until very recently .",
    "fortunately , there has been a recent , much more careful study  @xcite . yet , the scope of ref .",
    "@xcite was to determine whether an interaction explicitly degrading the @xmath0 symmetry to an @xmath10 group was relevant in the renormalization - group sense .",
    "to that end , those authors concentrated in producing extremely accurate data on small lattices .",
    "our purpose is to study in greater detail the critical properties of the three dimensional o(5 ) non linear @xmath1 model , and of the afm @xmath2 model .",
    "we improve over previous studies of both models , obtaining more accurate estimates for critical exponents , universal dimensionless quantities and non universal critical couplings .",
    "as symmetries play such a prominent role , we will also explore the possibilities of changing those of the low - temperature phase by adding a second - neighbors coupling to the hamiltonian of the afm @xmath2 model .",
    "we are considering a system of @xmath11-component normalized spins @xmath12 placed in a three dimensional simple cubic lattice of size _",
    "l _ with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the actions of our lattice systems are    @xmath13    where the sums are extended to all pairs of nearest neighbors . our sign convention is fixed by the partition function : @xmath14 @xmath15 being the rotationally invariant measure over the @xmath11-dimensional unit sphere .    to construct observables ,",
    "in addition to the vector field @xmath16 , we consider the ( traceless ) tensorial field @xmath17 the interesting quantities related with the order parameters can be constructed in terms of the fourier transforms of the fields ( @xmath18 ) @xmath19    for @xmath20 models , the local gauge invariance @xmath21 implies that the relevant observables are constructed in terms of the tensor field .",
    "however , for @xmath7 we have found very interesting to consider as well quantities related with the tensor field .",
    "we construct the scalars ( under global @xmath7 transformations and spatial translations ) @xmath22 which , in addition to the action , are the only quantities measured during the simulation .",
    "their mean values yield the propagators : @xmath23    in the thermodynamic limit and at the critical point , the propagator is expected to have poles at @xmath24 and , for the antiferromagnetic model , at @xmath25 : or @xmath26 does not explicitly appears , it will imply that the equation is valid _ both _ for vector or tensor quantities .",
    "the same convention will apply for superscript ( f ) ( ferromagnetic ) and ( s ) ( staggered ) .",
    "staggered quantities are useful only for antiferromagnetic models . ]",
    "@xmath27 where @xmath28 , and the exponents @xmath29 and @xmath30 correspond to independent wave function renormalization at each pole .",
    "note that close to the critical point @xmath31 and @xmath32 are expected to remain proportional to each other ( this will be explicitly checked numerically ) .    the ( non - connected ) susceptibilities are simply : @xmath33    in a finite lattice an extremely useful definition of the correlation length can be obtained from the ( discrete ) derivative of @xmath34 . using @xmath35 one obtains@xcite @xmath36",
    "we also compute the cumulants @xmath37 finally , the energy per link is @xmath38    we have computed @xmath39-derivatives of observables through their connected correlation with the action .",
    "furthermore , we have extrapolated mean - values from the simulation coupling , to a neighboring value of @xmath39 using the standard reweighting techniques , that cover all the relevant part of the critical region  @xcite .",
    "the relationship between the @xmath0 model and the @xmath2 model arises from the landau - wilson - fisher hamiltonian for the @xmath2 system  @xcite .",
    "indeed , at the mean field level  @xcite , the ferromagnetic quantities are simple functions of the staggered ones .",
    "this suggests to construct the landau - wilson - fisher hamiltonian from the staggered magnetization , which is a traceless , real , symmetric @xmath40 matrix : @xmath41 note that @xmath42 has 5 independent quantities .",
    "it is therefore a simple matter to obtain a five - components real vector @xmath43 such that @xmath44 .",
    "the less trivial part regards the fourth - order interaction terms . in principle , the @xmath45 symmetry of the microscopic hamiltonian would allow for a @xmath46 term and a @xmath47 ^ 2 $ ] .",
    "surprisingly enough , both terms are proportional to @xmath48 .",
    "thus , assuming that sixth - order terms are irrelevant , the landau - wilson - fisher hamiltonian is expected to have a @xmath0 symmetry group and both models belong to the same universality class .",
    "this does not only implies that both models have the same critical exponents but also that the @xmath49 limit of @xmath50 and of @xmath51 ( evaluated at their respective critical couplings ) coincide .",
    "in the @xmath0 model we have studied lattice sizes @xmath52 and @xmath53 at @xmath54 .",
    "we have combined a wolff s single cluster update with metropolis .",
    "our _ elementary _ monte carlo step ( emcs ) consists of @xmath55 wolff s cluster update and then a full - lattice metropolis sweep .",
    "we take measurements after every emcs .",
    "since the average size of clusters grows as @xmath56 , @xmath57 of simulation time we are tracing clusters for all @xmath58 , while metropolis accounts for @xmath59 of time and measurements for the remaining @xmath59 .",
    "the total simulation time time has been the equivalent to 600 days of pentium iv at 3.2 ghz .",
    "the number of emcs ranges from @xmath60 for @xmath61 to @xmath62 at @xmath63 .",
    "the integrated autocorrelation times for the susceptibility and for the energy are smaller than 1 emcs for all the simulated lattice sizes .",
    "since we are interested in high accuracy estimates , we have used double precision arithmetics .",
    "one also needs to worry about the pseudo random - number generator .",
    "we have therefore implemented a schwinger - dyson test .",
    "it turned out that the 32-bits parisi - rapuano pseudo random - number generator  @xcite produces biased results .",
    "either the parisi - rapuano plus congruential generator  @xcite or the 64 bits parisi - rapuano generator cured this bias .",
    "the 64 bits parisi - rapuano generator is faster and it has been our final choice .",
    "for the antiferromagnetic @xmath2 model , no efficient cluster method is available .",
    "we have simulated in lattice sizes from @xmath64 and @xmath65 at @xmath66 .",
    "we used a multi - hit metropolis sequential algorithm . making a new spin proposal completely independent from the previous spin value",
    ", we achieve an acceptance of about @xmath67 .",
    "we have used 2 hits what ensures a 50% acceptance .",
    "the observables have been measured every two metropolis full lattice - sweep ( our emcs ) .",
    "the number of emcs ranges from @xmath60 for @xmath68 to @xmath69 for @xmath65 . in units of the integrated autocorrelation time @xmath70 ( for the order parameter ) we have more than @xmath71 for @xmath65 .",
    "the data up to @xmath72 were obtained in pentium iv clusters ( simulation time was roughly equivalent to a 1000 days of a single processor ) . for the largest lattice ,",
    "data were obtained in the _ mare nostrum _",
    "computer of the barcelona supercomputing center ( simulation time was roughly equivalent to 3000 days of a single processor ) .",
    "we perform a finite - size scaling analysis , using the quotients method  @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "one compares the mean value of an observable , @xmath73 , in two systems of sizes @xmath74 and @xmath75 , at the value of @xmath39 where the correlation - length in units of the lattice sizes coincides for both systems .",
    "if , for the infinite volume system , @xmath76 the basic equation of the quotient method is @xmath77 where the dots stand for higher order scaling corrections , @xmath78 is the correlation - length critical exponent , @xmath79 is the ( universal ) first irrelevant critical exponent , while @xmath80 is a non universal amplitude . in a typical application ,",
    "one fixes the ratio @xmath81 to 2 , and consider pairs of lattices @xmath58 and @xmath82 . a linear extrapolation in @xmath83",
    "is used to extract the infinite volume limit .",
    "one just needs to make sure that the minimum lattice size included in the extrapolation is large enough to safely neglect the higher - order corrections .",
    "of course , any quantity scaling like @xmath84 at the critical point , such as @xmath85 , may play the same role in eq.([quotients - formula ] ) .",
    "however , usually @xmath84 yields smaller scaling corrections than @xmath86 .",
    "the extrapolation method based on eq.([quotients - formula ] ) is feasible for the antiferromagnetic @xmath2 model .",
    "unfortunately , for the @xmath0 model the amplitude @xmath80 is surprisingly small .",
    "in fact , resummation of the @xmath87-expansion yields @xmath88  @xcite , while blind use of eq.([quotients - formula ] ) on our numerical data would predict @xmath89 . we have then considered an additional correction term , @xmath90 .",
    "the exponent @xmath1 is an effective way of taking into account a variety of higher - order scaling corrections of similar magnitude ( an @xmath91 contribution , subleading universal irrelevant critical corrections , analytic corrections , effects of the non - linearity of the scaling fields , etc.@xcite ) .",
    "its utility will be in that it allow us to give sensible error estimates for the infinite - volume extrapolations , instead of bluntly taking @xmath92 .",
    "the most precise way of extracting the critical exponent , @xmath93 , and the critical point @xmath94 is to consider the crossing point of dimensionless quantities such as @xmath95 and @xmath86 . indeed , comparing their values in lattices @xmath74 and @xmath75 , one finds that they take a common value at @xmath96 the non universal amplitude @xmath97 depends on the considered dimensionless quantity .",
    "again , one usually take pairs of lattices @xmath58 and @xmath98 , and extrapolates to infinite volume using eq.([ajuste ] ) , maybe performing a joint fit for the crossing points of several dimensionless quantities . again , for the @xmath0 model the amplitudes @xmath97 are exceedingly small , and we need to add to eq.([ajuste ] ) an analogous higher - order term , where @xmath1 plays the role of @xmath93 , and with amplitude @xmath99 .",
    ".effective critical points , @xmath100 , of the @xmath0 model , from the crossing points of the dimensionless quantities @xmath101 and @xmath102 obtained in lattices of sizes @xmath58 and @xmath82 .",
    "we also show the value of both quantities at their respective crossing point . [ cols=\">,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
