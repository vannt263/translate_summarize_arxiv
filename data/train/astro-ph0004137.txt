    "several groups have been engaged in gravitational microlensing observations toward the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) and the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) in order to investigate the nature of massive compact halo objects ( machos ) in the galaxy s halo . until now , 8 microlensing event candidates have been found toward the lmc ( @xcite ) , and 2 candidates , including one possible binary lens event , have been found toward the smc ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the microlensing light curve informs us only of the event duration @xmath5 , in which the mass , velocity and distance of the lensing object are degenerate , and thus it is difficult to determine the mass or the distance of the lensing object for each microlensing event .",
    "therefore , the nature of machos in the galactic halo still remains unclear , and one can not rule out the possibility that the microlensing events are not caused by machos in the galaxy s halo but by unknown populations lying between the galaxy and the clouds ( e.g. , zaritsky & lin 1997 ; zhao 1998 ) , or by normal stars in the clouds themselves ( e.g.,sahu 1994 ) .    in order to understand the nature of lensing objects , some additional information that partially or fully break the three - fold degeneracy is required . over the past years",
    "several investigations have been made to extract additional information from special types of microlensing events .",
    "examples of which are binary events and parallax events , for which the lens proper motion and lens distance can be constrained ( e.g. , schneider & weiss 1984 ; @xcite ; miyamoto & yoshii 1995 ) .",
    "a transit event , in which the lens transits the extended surface of the source star , is another example of such types of microlensing events ( gould 1992 , 1994 ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "when the lens passes over the surface of the source star , the point source approximation fails and the peak of light curve deviates from that for a point source . from such a light curve , one can derive the radius of the source star scaled by the einstein ring radius projected onto the source plane .",
    "since the radius of the source star can be estimated from its spectrum , one can obtain the proper motion of the lens for transit events .",
    "the proper motion of the lens will be of great use in investigating the lens location , as the expected proper motion distribution of objects in the galaxy s halo differs significantly from that in the clouds .",
    "unfortunately however , the probability for transit events is expected to be extremely small ( @xmath6 ) for normal microlensing events ( @xcite ) .",
    "the probability for transit events is relatively high for eagle events , in which an invisible star is amplified above the detection limit , because eagle events are guaranteed to have a small impact parameter ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "since there are many more faint stars below the detection limit than visible stars that are usually used for microlensing search , the eagle event rate is expected to be fairly high ( @xcite ) .",
    "however eagle events have rarely been seen in the current observation programs in which the brightness of visible stars are measured based on a dophot - type analysis . recently however , a new ccd photometry method called ",
    "image subtraction has been developed ( @xcite , 2000 ; @xcite ; i.a .",
    "bond 1999 , private communication ) .",
    "this method , which compares an exposure frame directly with a reference frame , is much more powerful for detecting eagle events than the current monitoring of visible stars , and one can expect that plenty of eagle events will be detected with this method in the near future .",
    "if many eagle events are detected , one may be able to find several transit events because eagle events have small impact parameters .",
    "therefore , a search for eagle events will possibly provide a new opportunity to measure the lens proper motion in transit events , and thereby to constrain strongly the lens location .",
    "furthermore , statistics of transit eagle events alone may be useful for studying the nature of lensing objects .",
    "the fraction of transit events depends on the ratio of the physical radius of the source star @xmath7 to the einstein radius @xmath8 in source plane , i.e. @xmath9 . in the case where the lenses are the stars in the lmc itself ( self - lensing ) ,",
    "the einstein radius @xmath8 in source plane is much smaller than in the case where the lenses are machos in the galactic halo .",
    "thus the fraction of transit eagle events out of all eagle events for self - lensing in the lmc will be much larger than that for lensing due to machos in the halo .",
    "therefore the fraction of transit eagle events may be used to constrain the location and the nature of lens .",
    "eagle events will thus become one of the most powerful tools for investigating the nature of lensing objects .",
    "for these reasons , in this paper we investigate the properties of eagle events , and present a detailed calculation of the probability for transit eagle events . in section",
    "@xmath10 we briefly summarize the basic equations , and in section @xmath11 we estimate the event rate of eagles . in section",
    "@xmath12 we calculate the fraction of transit events , and in section @xmath13 we derive the event duration of eagles .",
    "discussion on the observation strategy for eagle search is made in section @xmath14 .",
    "the amplification a of the microlensing event for point source approximation is given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 here @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the distances from the observer to the source star , and to the lens object respectively .",
    "@xmath19 is the distance from the lens to the source projected onto the lens plane . @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the einstein radius and the projected einstein radius in the source plane , respectively .",
    "the parameter @xmath22 denotes the impact parameter in the lens plane scaled by @xmath20 .    in an eagle event ,",
    "an invisible star with magnitude @xmath23 is amplified beyond the observational detection limit @xmath24 .",
    "more precisely , to identify an eagle event , the source must become brighter than the eagle detection threshold @xmath25 , which is slightly brighter than the observational detection limit @xmath24 .",
    "thus , for an eagle event , the amplification @xmath26 must be larger than the threshold amplitude @xmath27 , which is written as : @xmath28 we define the threshold impact parameter @xmath29 as the largest impact parameter for an eagle event with a @xmath30 magnitude source star .",
    "the value of @xmath29 is determined so that @xmath31 . in the case of a point source and a small impact parameter",
    ", we can make the approximation that @xmath32 .",
    "the threshold impact parameter can be then be written as ( @xcite ) : @xmath33 however , in most of the cases we are interested in , the effect of a finite source is not negligible , and this approximation is not applicable .",
    "we thus calculate the threshold impact parameter @xmath29 by taking the finite - source effect into account .",
    "when the source size is finite , the amplification @xmath26 can not be given by equation ( [ eq : amp ] ) , but approximated by the following expression ( @xcite ) ,    @xmath34    here @xmath35 is the source radius scaled by @xmath8 ( @xmath7 is the physical radius of the source ) , and @xmath36 is the impact parameter in the source plane scaled by the radius of the source star @xmath7 .",
    "the function b(z ) describes the ratio of the amplification of a finite source to the amplification of a point source , which is written as @xmath37 we show the relation of the amplification and other parameters in figure @xmath38 .    to compute the amplification using equations ( [ eq : afin ] ) and ( [ eq : b ] )",
    ", one has to know the physical size of the source star that has a magnitude of @xmath23 . in this paper",
    ", we approximate the relation between @xmath39 and @xmath23 for a main sequence star ( @xcite ; @xcite ) as follows , @xmath40 using equations ( [ eq : afin ] ) , ( [ eq : b ] ) , ( [ eq : radius1 ] ) and ( [ eq : radius2 ] ) , one can derive the threshold impact parameter @xmath29 from the condition that @xmath41 .",
    "the eagle event rate depends heavily on the mass function and the luminosity function of source stars in the lmc and the smc . following nakamura & nishi ( 1998 ) ,",
    "we assume that a stellar initial mass function is in the power law form with index @xmath42 , that the star formation rates in the lmc have been constant for 5 gyr and was zero before 5 gyr ago . assuming that the lifetime of the sun is 10 gyr",
    ", we obtain the present day mass function as @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the lower and the upper mass limit of the stars , respectively",
    ". the initial mass function of the stars in the lmc are not so different from the salpeter imf @xmath46 ( @xcite ) .",
    "however for field stars the slope may be as steep as @xmath47 ( @xcite ) . in the following analysis we use the two extreme values of @xmath42 , 2.35 and 5.0 .",
    "we note that the results in the following sections do not depend strongly on the shape of the mass function beyond @xmath48 because the contribution of low mass stars is much more significant than that of massive stars .",
    "the mass - luminosity relation of the main sequence stars is expressed by ( @xcite ) @xmath49    the bolometric correction ( @xmath50 ) can be approximated as ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) @xmath51    then we can drive the @xmath23 band luminosity function of stars in the lmc using equations ( [ eq : imf1 ] ) to ( [ eq : bc3 ] ) .",
    "@xmath52 in this paper we will use these mass and luminosity functions .",
    "in this section we estimate the eagle event rate . instead of the absolute event rate ,",
    "we estimate the relative event rate normalized with the rate for normal microlensing events .",
    "when a lens object passes the line of sight with a normalized impact parameter @xmath53 , the source star is amplified according to equation ( [ eq : amp ] ) , where @xmath19 is the distance from the lens to the source in the lens plane .",
    "a microlensing event is defined as a phenomenon where the source star is amplified more than the given threshold amplification @xmath54 .",
    "this occurs whenever a lens enters the microlensing `` tube '' whose radius is @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the detection threshold impact parameter corresponding to @xmath57 ( griest 1991 ) .",
    "this means that all detected microlensing events have to satisfy @xmath58 .",
    "the probability that a lens passes this region is proportional to the length of this radius @xmath55 . for a normal microlensing event @xmath56",
    "is set to be unity corresponding to @xmath59 , and for an eagle event we use @xmath29 defined in section [ sec : basic ] as @xmath56 .",
    "hence the event rate is proportional to @xmath60 for a normal microlensing event and @xmath61 for an eagle event , i.e. , these event rates are proportional to the radius of each appropriate circle in figure [ fig : amp ] and einstein radius @xmath20 .",
    "the event rate is proportional to the density distribution of the lens @xmath62 ( griest 1991 ) .",
    "the event rate is also proportional to the number of source stars which is expressed as the luminosity function of source stars @xmath63 in the lmc .",
    "moreover , the event rate should be averaged over the probability distribution of the mass of the lenses using the mass function @xmath64 .",
    "thus , the differential form of the event rate averaged over the source stars for normal microlensing events is written as @xmath65 note that the integration with respect to @xmath23 means averaging over the source stars .",
    "similarly , the differential form of the rate for eagle events can be expressed as @xmath66 note that the threshold impact parameter @xmath29 appears in case of eagle events , since the event rate for eagle events is proportional to @xmath67 instead of @xmath20 . to calculate the normal and the eagle event rates",
    ", we must integrate them over the possible ranges of the parameters .",
    "the normal event rate @xmath68 can be estimated as @xmath69 where the integration is performed over the following ranges .",
    "@xmath70 here @xmath44 and @xmath45 denote the lower and the upper mass limit for the mass function , and @xmath71 denotes the luminous end of the luminosity function @xmath72 .",
    "similarly , the eagle event rate @xmath73 can be estimated as @xmath74 note that the integral ranges for @xmath18 , @xmath17 and @xmath75 are the same as for @xmath68 , but @xmath23 is in the range : @xmath76 note that @xmath77 denotes the faint end of the luminosity function .",
    "since the constant c is equal in both equations , one can easily obtain the ratio @xmath78 by integrating above equations numerically .",
    "as for the integral ranges for the luminosity in the lmc stars , we assume that @xmath79 and @xmath80 . we note that the results are not affected strongly by stars outside this magnitude range .",
    "we also assume @xmath81 , which is a typical observational limit for current microlensing programs .",
    "we consider two different values for the threshold magnitude ; @xmath30 = 19 and 20 .",
    "we calculate these integrals in the case where the lenses are stars in the lmc itself ( self - lensing ) and in the case where the lenses are machos in the halo . for these two cases ,",
    "there are the following differences which arise in the integral ranges of ( @xmath75 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 ) and the functions of ( @xmath62 and @xmath64 ) .    * in the case where the lenses are known stars in the lmc itself , for simplicity , we assume a constant spatial density distribution of the lens @xmath62 with depth @xmath82 . for the depth of the lmc @xmath83 , one finds that the bar can be as thin as the disk itself ( @xcite ) , and the thickness of the lmc disk is about 300pc ( @xcite ) .",
    "since there is not any more accurate information , we adopt two values , 300pc and 1kpc .",
    "we also assume that the distance to the lmc is 50 kpc , and also assume @xmath84 , @xmath85 for the lens mass distribution expressed by equations ( [ eq : imf1 ] ) and ( [ eq : imf2 ] ) in the case of self - lensing . * in the case where the lenses are machos in the halo , we fix @xmath86 kpc and integrate with @xmath18 from @xmath87 to @xmath86 kpc .",
    "we also adopt the standard halo model for the spatial distribution of the lens @xmath62 as follows ( griest 1991 ) : @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the local mass density , @xmath90 is the galactocentric radius , @xmath91 kpc is the galactocentric distance of the sun , and @xmath92 kpc is the core radius .",
    "we also assume a delta function mass distribution for machos , and we take two values of @xmath75 ; @xmath93 and @xmath94 .    the results for @xmath95 19 and 20 are listed in table [ tbl : eventrate ] , and the probability distribution of eagle events as a function of the source magnitude @xmath23 are shown in figure @xmath96 . from these results",
    "we conclude the following :    * from the results in table [ tbl : eventrate ] we can expect the eagle event rate is of the same order ( @xmath97 events / yr ) as the rate for normal events when @xmath98 , and much larger ( @xmath99 events / yr ) when @xmath100 . here",
    "we assume the normal event rate @xmath101 events / yr ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the event rate for eagles is high enough to allow the events to be detected . *",
    "the event rate for eagles for @xmath100 is @xmath102 times higher than that for @xmath98 .",
    "this strong dependence of the eagle event rate on @xmath42 indicates that we can obtain some information on the power index @xmath42 of the mass function of stars in the lmc from the eagle event rate .",
    "* when @xmath103 , the eagle event rate for halo machos is 3 times higher than that for the self - lensing case .",
    "so if @xmath103 , it is possible to determine whether the lens masses are machos in the halo or known stars in the lmc itself from the event rate of eagles . * in figure @xmath96",
    ", we can see the eagle event probability decrease for large @xmath23 , though the number of stars increases with increasing @xmath23 .",
    "the reasons are that @xmath104 is small for large @xmath23 and the source can not be amplified enough to be observed due to the finite - source effect . also , if @xmath103 , the distribution of the source star magnitudes may be useful for determining whether the lens masses are machos in the halo or are stars in the lmc , because this distribution is significantly different in each case ( see figure @xmath96 ) .",
    "in this section , we investigate the fraction of transit eagle events in all eagle events .",
    "the finite - source effect appears when @xmath36 becomes smaller than about 2 ( @xcite ) , where @xmath105 is the impact parameter ( in the source plane ) scaled by the radius of the source star @xmath39 ( see section 2 ) and @xmath35 is defined in equation ( [ eq : afin ] ) as the source star radius normalized by the einstein radius in the source plane .",
    "however , when @xmath106 , the effect is not strong and it is quite difficult to determine whether the event is a transit event or a non - transit event ( @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , here we define a transit event as an event with @xmath107 .",
    "the event rate of eagles is proportional to @xmath67 ( see section [ sec : event ] ) , and similarly , the probability that the lens transits the surface of the source star is proportional to @xmath108 . in short , these rates are proportional to the radius of the corresponding circle in figure [ fig : amp ] .    thus , the ratio of the transit eagle event rate to the total eagle event rate is proportional to @xmath109 . in order to estimate the mean value of the fraction of transit eagle events , one must integrate this ratio over all possible parameter ranges as above , in section [ sec : event ] .",
    "the mean value of this fraction can be estimated by evaluating the following : @xmath110 the results for @xmath111 and @xmath112 are shown in table [ tbl : ratio ] . from these results",
    "we conclude the following :    * the fraction of transit events in all eagle events is much higher than that for normal events ( @xmath113 ) ( gould 1994 ) .",
    "so we can expect a few transit eagle events per year using a 1-m class telescope depending on the lens location .",
    "if we obtain an accurate light curve and a good estimate of the radius of the source star by follow - up observations , we can get the proper motion of the lens for each event ( @xcite ) .",
    "since the lens proper motion is useful for constraining the lensing location ( and so the lens population ) , we can determine the location of the lens for each event .",
    "* moreover , the fraction of transit events strongly depends on whether the lens is in the halo or in the lmc .",
    "the transit fraction for the self - lensing case for @xmath46 is @xmath114 times larger than that for halo macho lensing case ( for @xmath103 , @xmath115 times larger ) .",
    "we can constrain the power index @xmath42 using the event rate ( see table [ tbl : eventrate ] ) and the distribution of the source star magnitude ( see figure @xmath96 ) . hence",
    ", if we can measure the fraction of transit events in all eagle events , we will be able to constrain the lens location ( and so the lens population ) statistically .",
    "so the eagle event search will be of great importance in investigating the location and the nature of the lensing objects .",
    "we discuss some quantitative examples about these in section [ sec : disc ] .",
    "in this section , we estimate the duration , @xmath116 of an eagle event .",
    "we define the duration of an eagle event @xmath116 as the time when the source star becomes brighter than the observation apparent magnitude threshold @xmath24 .",
    "the critical amplification @xmath117 is written as @xmath118 . if @xmath119 , we use equation ( [ eq : afin ] ) to derive @xmath120 . on the other hand , when @xmath121 , we use the standard equation ( @xmath122 ) , because equation ( @xmath123 ) is invalid and the finite - source effect is negligible for this case .",
    "the mean value of @xmath116 for the event with source magnitude @xmath23 can be written as @xmath124 where @xmath5 is the true duration of the microlensing event and @xmath125 is the transverse velocity of the lens object relative to the observer - source line of sight .",
    "we assume @xmath126 km / s for the machos in the halo and @xmath127 km / s for the stars in the lmc .",
    "the mean value of @xmath128 averaged over all possible values of distance , lens mass and source magnitude is : @xmath129    the results for @xmath111 and @xmath112 are shown in table [ tbl : te ] , and the probability distribution of @xmath116 for eagle events is shown in figure @xmath130 . in figure @xmath130 , the distributions",
    "are shifted to shorter durations for @xmath131 with respect to those for @xmath46 because the number of dim sources for eagles increases .",
    "we can also see a cut - off in the probability curves at smaller @xmath132 for self - lensing .",
    "this is because the event rate of eagles whose impact parameter is smaller than some threshold value decreases according to the finite - source effect . from figure @xmath130",
    ", we can see that the duration of the eagle is usually short ( 1 day @xmath133 40 days ) , especially when @xmath103 .",
    "hence , the nightly observational mode currently undertaken is not adequate for detecting eagle events , but an hourly observational mode is more suitable for detecting eagle events .",
    "if observations are made several times per night , there will be sufficient time resolution to detect the eagle events and to issue an alert for an occurring eagle event .",
    "we have seen that the eagle event rate is as high as that for normal events . since the duration of an eagle event is usually short ( 1 day @xmath133 40 days )",
    ", the nightly observation program currently undertaken by most groups is not adequate .",
    "hourly observation is necessary for finding eagle events .",
    "moreover , monitoring with a 1-m class telescope is sufficient to search for eagles and to make follow up observations near the peak , but not enough to follow up the wing of the light curve .",
    "this is because the source is visible only at the peak of the light curve but invisible during most of the remainder of the event . to get overall structure of the light curve , one has to observe the event with a larger telescope for a longer period ( but we do not need to observe so frequently ) .",
    "current microlensing experiments are being carried out toward very dense stellar fields .",
    "so , the determination of the absolute flux of the source has been an issue in microlensing because of source star blending . in the case of eagle events ,",
    "the source stars are fainter than the detection limit and thus the blending of brighter stars is significant , making the problem worse .",
    "attempts have been made to correct the blending effects for individual events by introducing an additional parameter , the blended flux , but this method suffers from very large uncertainties in the derived lensing parameters due to degeneracies among the parameters ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "one solution to correct for blending problem is to use the hubble space telescope ( hst ) .",
    "the high resolving power of the hst and the color information from ground - based observations enable us to uniquely separate the lensed source star from blended stars ( @xcite ) . the image subtraction method ( @xcite , 2000 ; @xcite ; i.a . bond 1999 , private communication ) should be used to locate the centroid of the lensed flux in the ground - based event image accurately to find the lensed star in the hst image .",
    "other high resolution telescopes like the vlt are also good candidates for performing follow - up observations . using a large telescope",
    "is also required for spectroscopic observations of the source star , from which one can estimate the source radius .",
    "we can do this even after the event is finished .",
    "using the image subtraction method has another advantage in microlensing experiments .",
    "the color change induced by the limb - darkened extended source helps the measurement of the proper motion of the lens and increases the possible number of proper motion measurement events ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "han ( @xcite ) found the color change measurement by using the image subtraction method enables one to obtain the same information about the lens and the source star , but with significantly reduced uncertainties due to the absence of the blending effect .",
    "so measuring the color change with differential photometry helps to derive the proper motion of the lens along with the other microlensing parameters , and at least , inform us whether a lens transited the surface of the source or not without requiring the absolute baseline flux .",
    "this information is useful in understanding the location of the lens object which we discuss below .    in order to perform follow - up monitoring and spectroscopic observations , one has to detect an eagle event in real - time and issue an alert . for the real - time detection of eagle events ,",
    "the image subtraction method is more suitable than the dophot analysis or the pixel analysis , since the image subtraction method can detect the luminosity variation at any position of the fields , even where no star was identified previously .",
    "thus , the most reasonable and practical observation strategy is to observe hourly ( with a 1-m telescope ) and to perform the real - time analysis with the subtraction method .",
    "an alert can then be issued , to observers around the world enabling frequent observations around the event peak .",
    "after that , high resolution observations with larger telescope should be carried out to determine the baseline flux of the source .    as seen in section [ sec : ratio ] ,",
    "a large fraction of eagle events is likely to be transit eagle events . if we can issue an alert for such an eagle event , observations with the global network",
    "will allow us to obtain a precise light curve near the maximum amplification . because the transit time is @xmath134 hours for self - lensing and @xmath135 hours for halo machos",
    ", it is possible to measure precisely the light curve in the transit region . since the overall structure of the light curve",
    "can be determined by follow - up observations with larger telescopes , one can obtain the source radius scaled by einstein radius @xmath35 from the full light curve and from the color change measurements due to a limb - darkened extended source ( @xcite ) . if one can obtain @xmath35 and also the radius of the source star @xmath7 from the color of the source star , one can obtain the einstein radius @xmath8 projected in source plane . since the event duration @xmath5 can be also determined from the full light curve , one can measure the proper motion of the lens object for a transit eagle event ( @xcite ) .",
    "the proper motion of the lens object is of great use in determining the lens location .",
    "since the proper motion of objects in the halo is @xmath136 times larger than that of stars in the lmc , one can know whether the lensing object exists in the halo or not from the proper motion of transit eagle events .",
    "even if we can not derive an accurate proper motion of lens , the fraction of transit events can be used to constrain the lens location , because that ratio for the self - lensing case is @xmath2 times larger than that for the halo machos case .    to demonstrate how we can constrain the nature of microlensing objects ,",
    "we show in figure @xmath137 the probability distribution of the transit events for both the halo lensing case and the lmc self - lensing case . for the typical parameters @xmath46 , @xmath138 and a detection efficiency of 50%",
    ", one can expect to find @xmath139 eagle events after a 3 year observation period of 11 square degrees of the lmc central region ( as the macho collaboration does ) . in these 21 eagle events",
    ", we can expect 1.1 ( 0.4 ) and 6.1 ( 4.6 ) transit events for halo machos whose mass is @xmath140 and for self - lensing with @xmath141 ( 1k ) pc , respectively .",
    "so if we do not detect any transit events in 3 years , we can reject the possibility of self - lensing at more than @xmath142 confidence level according to poisson statistics . in table",
    "[ tbl : conf ] , we show some other results on how strongly we can discriminate between the two possible locations of the lensing objects based on poisson statistics .",
    "it is possible that we may be able to constrain strongly the lens location based on the 3-year statistics of transit eagle events .    in conclusion ,",
    "the study of eagle events is very effective for constraining the nature of lens objects .",
    "if an eagle search is made for a few years , we can form strong constraints on lens objects in microlensing events .",

    "<S> we propose a new method to constrain the location of microlensing objects using eagle ( extremely amplified gravitational lensing ) events . we have estimated the rate of eagle events by taking the finite - source effect into account . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the eagle event rate for using a 1-m class telescope whose limiting magnitude is @xmath0 is the same as or higher than that of the ordinary microlensing events which have been found to date . </S>",
    "<S> we have also found that the fraction of transit eagle events is large enough to detect : between @xmath1 depending on the lens location . </S>",
    "<S> since the lens proper motion can be measured for a transit event , one can distinguish whether the lens is a macho ( massive compact halo object ) in our halo or one of the known stars in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) from the proper motion measurement for each transit eagle event . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we show that the fraction of transit eagles in all eagle events significantly depends on the lensing locations : the transit eagle fraction for the self - lensing case is @xmath2 times larger than that for halo machos . </S>",
    "<S> thus , one can constrain the location of lens objects by the statistics of the transit events fraction . </S>",
    "<S> we show that we can reasonably expect @xmath3 transit events out of 21 eagle events in 3 years . </S>",
    "<S> we can also constrain the lens population properties at a greater than @xmath4 confidence level depending on the number of transit events detected . </S>",
    "<S> we also present the duration of eagle events , and show how an hourly observational mode is more suitable for an eagle event search program . </S>"
