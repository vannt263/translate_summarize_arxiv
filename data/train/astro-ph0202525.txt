    "the interaction of magnetic fields with turbulence is a basic feature of many astrophysical systems .",
    "important , basic mhd turbulence problems common to many fields of astrophysics include the nature of mhd turbulence itself , the dynamo problem , the effects of magnetic fields on turbulent transport and turbulent mixing , the effects of small scale turbulence on large scale dynamics , and the formation and evolution of current sheets .",
    "although progress on all of these problems has been made analytically , numerical simulations are an increasingly powerful means of approaching them .",
    "accurate simulation of astrophysical magnetic fields under turbulent conditions presents extreme challenges of its own .",
    "the main reason is the smallness of the magnetic diffusivity , which leads naturally to the formation of thin current layers .",
    "most of the ohmic dissipation , and most of the change in magnetic topology , takes place in these layers .",
    "it is important to understand these diffusive effects in order to answer questions such as : how do dynamos amplify magnetic fields on large scales but not small scales ? what determines the ratio of magnetic flux to mass in self gravitating regions ?",
    "how is magnetic energy dissipated in a turbulent plasma ?",
    "the purpose of this review is to isolate some important problems related to magnetized turbulence in astrophysics , with emphasis on their computational aspects .",
    "the subject is vast , and we make no claim to be comprehensive .",
    "we cite literature up to early 2002 .    in  2 , we write down the magnetic induction equation ,",
    "derive some of its basic properties , and discuss the use of conservation laws in testing mhd codes . as an illustration",
    ", we carry out such tests on the zeus code . in  3 , we discuss the parameter space for astrophysical mhd . in  4 , we discuss some results on the dynamo problem , the turbulence problem , the formation of singularities , and the role of turbulence in large scale dynamics . in  5 , we discuss lightly ionized media , for which ambipolar drift yields an effective diffusivity which is much higher than the ohmic value . although the two forms of diffusion are not equivalent , ambipolar drift is a partial solution to the problem of small diffusivity .",
    "section 6 is a summary and discussion of future prospects .",
    "according to faraday s law , also known as the magnetic induction equation @xmath0 throughout this paper , we will assume @xmath1 is given by @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the electrical conductivity , @xmath4 is the magnetic diffusivity , and in the last step we have used ampere s law , neglecting the displacement current .",
    "the first and second terms on the rhs of eqn .",
    "( [ e ] ) represent inductive and resistive effects , respectively . in order to compare these terms",
    ", we introduce a characteristic speed @xmath5 and a characteristic lengthscale @xmath6 , and write @xmath7 and @xmath8 in terms of dimensionless velocities and coordinates ; @xmath9 ; @xmath10 .",
    "equation ( [ e ] ) can then be written as @xmath11 where the dimensionless parameter @xmath12 is defined by @xmath13 in some problems it is convenient to set @xmath5 to a typical alfvn speed @xmath14 , in which case @xmath12 is known as the lundquist number and denoted by @xmath15 .    the case @xmath16 is called _ ideal _ mhd .",
    "it is clear from eqns .",
    "( [ faraday ] ) and ( [ e ] ) that the limit @xmath17 is a singular limit , in the sense that at this limit the order of the magnetic induction equation drops from second to first .",
    "we therefore expect that as @xmath18 , thin boundary layers , or current sheets , will form .",
    "this should be anticipated when choosing numerical schemes (  [ subsec : numimplications ] ) .",
    "the high @xmath15 limit describes most astrophysical problems .",
    "the ideal form of the magnetic induction equation can be solved exactly in terms of fluid trajectories .",
    "suppose that the fluid at position @xmath8 at time @xmath19 was at position @xmath20 at time @xmath21 .",
    "define the deformation matrix @xmath22 by @xmath23 it can then be shown that the magnetic field @xmath24 is related to the initial field @xmath25 by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the determinant of @xmath22 .",
    "equation ( [ cauchy ] ) is known as the cauchy solution of the magnetic induction equation .",
    "it is the basis for the numerical technique used by kinney et al .",
    "@xcite to simulate 2d mhd turbulence .",
    "conservation laws can be used to test mhd codes .",
    "the cauchy solution embodies magnetic flux conservation .",
    "this basic property is in practice difficult to test , because in turbulent flow , fluid elements follow complex paths .",
    "the cauchy solution only makes sense as long as fluid trajectories do not intersect , but this can not be guaranteed in a finite difference code , which is always somewhat diffusive .",
    "therefore , we turn to a globally conserved quantity : magnetic helicity .",
    "the helicity @xmath28 of a fixed volume @xmath29 of fluid with magnetic vector potential @xmath30 and magnetic field @xmath31 is @xmath32 uncurling eqn .",
    "( [ faraday ] ) leads to an evolution equation for @xmath30 @xmath33 where @xmath34 is a free gauge function . according to eqns .",
    "( [ faraday ] ) and ( [ uncurl ] ) , the rate of change of @xmath28 is @xmath35 where we have integrated once by parts and used gauss s theorem .",
    "we now take periodic boundary conditions on @xmath29 , so that the surface integral vanishes , and use eqn .",
    "( [ e ] ) .",
    "equation ( [ hdot ] ) then becomes @xmath36 equation ( [ hdot2 ] ) shows that helicity is conserved in an ideal medium .",
    "the rate at which helicity varies is a global measure of the magnetic diffusivity @xmath37 .",
    "diffusion can cause helicity growth as well as decay .",
    "we obtain a slightly different conservation law if we assume that @xmath29 is comoving instead of fixed . in this case",
    ", we find that in an ideal medium , @xmath28 is conserved within @xmath29 as long as @xmath38 .",
    "however , in view of the difficulty of following comoving volumes in a turbulent fluid , it is more useful to treat @xmath29 as fixed , and to take it as the computational domain .    finally , we derive an equation for magnetic energy @xmath39 @xmath40 taking the scalar product of eqn .",
    "( [ faraday ] ) with @xmath41 , integrating over space , and assuming periodic boundary conditions yields @xmath42 the first term on the rhs of eqn .",
    "( [ wdot ] ) represents the work done by the flow on the field , and appears with opposite sign in the evolution equation for kinetic energy .",
    "the second term represents energy loss by ohmic decay .",
    "the zeus-3d code @xcite solves the equations of ideal , compressible mhd using a finite difference scheme and a von neumann artificial viscosity to capture shocks .",
    "the mhd induction equation is followed using the method of consistent transport along characteristics @xcite .",
    "zeus-3d is publically available , and has been of great service in the astrophysical community .",
    "if there were no numerical dissipation in the zeus code , magnetic helicity would be strictly conserved ( see eqn .",
    "( [ hdot2 ] ) ) . here , we investigate helicity conservation in the zeus code in two applications .    the first problem is the evolution of a twisted magnetic flux tube which is unstable to the kink mode .",
    "initially , the helicity of the tube is entirely in the twist of the field about the axis .",
    "theory predicts that the instability drives the system to a new equilibrium state in which some of the helicity is carried by a writhing deformation of the tube axis , and the total magnetic energy is reduced while the total helicity is fixed .",
    "the simulations confirm the broad outline of this picture .",
    "the growth rate of the kink during the linear phase agrees with an analytical calculation , and significant motion occurs only during the kinking phase , while magnetic energy is being released .",
    "however , both magnetic energy and magnetic helicity decline steadily once the system reaches equilibrium , as shown in figure ( [ fig1 ] ) for computations with 80@xmath43 and 160@xmath43 gridpoints . during the dynamical kink phase , the energy declines much faster than the helicity , confirming the importance of both dynamical and resistive processes in the evolution of magnetic energy .     is given in units of the alfvn crossing time for the flux tube with diameter @xmath44 .",
    "helicity is given in units of @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the number of rotations by @xmath47 of the twisted field lines about the tube axis over the domain length l , and @xmath48 is the total axial flux of the tube . ]",
    "we have used eqn .",
    "( [ hdot2 ] ) to estimate the mean pseudo- magnetic diffusivity @xmath49 , i.e. the mean numerical magnetic diffusivity , by writing the integral on the right hand side as @xmath50 which can be regarded as the definition of @xmath49 .",
    "the result is shown in figure ( [ fig2 ] ) , where @xmath49 is plotted for the two simulations in units of @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the grid scale . the near coincidence of the two curves shows that the numerical diffusion is linear in @xmath52 . during the dynamical phase , @xmath49 is enhanced over its  quiet \" value @xmath53 by about a factor of 3 , perhaps suggesting that numerical resistivity , like numerical viscosity , is proportional to velocity .",

    "we have also computed the evolution of @xmath28 in models of molecular clouds @xcite , with initially uniform magnetic fields , stirred by supersonic turbulence . in these models @xmath28 is initially zero , and should remain so , although the helicity density @xmath63 can vary arbitrarily between positive and negative values from point to point .",

    "the variance of @xmath28 around zero is smaller for the run at alfven mach number @xmath65 than for the run at @xmath66 , presumably because the field becomes less tangled if it is relatively strong .     and @xmath66 .",
    "]    figure ( [ fig4 ] ) shows mass density and helicity density , for the weak field model , in a plane perpendicular to the mean magnetic field .",
    "the figure shows that helicity density varies strongly with position , and that it is well correlated with mass density ( the correlation is not as good in the strong field case ) .    .",
    "]    the density compressions in these models are associated with shock fronts .",
    "helicity density can also increase across a shock .",
    "for example , consider a locally sheared , force free magnetic field of the form @xmath67 the vector potential is @xmath68 so the helicity density is @xmath69 .",
    "suppose the fluid is compressed in the @xmath70 direction , so that the initial and final coordinates @xmath71 and @xmath72 are related by @xmath73 , with @xmath74 . it can be shown from eqn .",

    "the helicity density then increases by a factor @xmath77 , which is the same factor by which the mass density increases .",
    "the dimensionless parameters of astrophysical turbulence define the scope of the problem and should influence the choice of numerical technique . here",
    "we define and give quantitative expressions for some important parameters .      the ratio of gas pressure to magnetic pressure is usually denoted by @xmath78 , which is closely related to the ratio of the sound speed @xmath79 to the alfvn speed @xmath80 ; @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the ratio of specific heats . if @xmath83 is either very small or very large , the acoustic and alfvn frequencies are very different , with consequences for choice of simulation technique",

    "the viscous diffusivity , or kinematic viscosity @xmath116 , is @xmath117 the reynolds number @xmath118 with respect to an organized flow @xmath29 on a lengthscale @xmath57 is defined as @xmath119 , and is almost always extremely large , confirming our expectation that astrophysical flow can be structured over a wide range of scales .    according to eqns .",
    "( [ lohm ] ) and ( [ nu ] ) , the ratio of viscous to magnetic diffusivity , which is known as the magnetic prandtl number @xmath120 , is @xmath121 typically , @xmath122 ; in the example of fully ionized interstellar gas introduced above , @xmath123 .",
    "therefore , the kinetic energy spectrum should be truncated on much larger scales than the magnetic fluctuation spectrum @xcite the computations by maron & cowley @xcite show that the essentially constant shear of the velocity field on scales near the resistive scale generates tightly folded , or hairpin - like , magnetic structures .    if the ion cyclotron frequency @xmath124 and the ion collision time @xmath95 satisfy the condition @xmath125 , the viscosity is highly anisotropic with respect to the magnetic field .",
    "the viscous force acting on shear flow parallel to the magnetic field is reduced by a factor of @xmath126 , while the parallel viscosity remains the same ( see @xcite for a full description ) . using eqn .",
    "( [ tauei ] ) , we see that @xmath127 is indeed large ; in our numerical example , it is nearly 10@xmath128 , implying very strong suppression of viscosity perpendicular to the magnetic field .",
    "maron & cowley @xcite have implemented the full tensor viscosity in their simulations of turbulent dynamos .      in order for a numerical method to include diffusive processes",
    ", we would ideally require two things , namely ( a ) that it can resolve the physically important scales and ( b ) that it can handle the disparate time scales . clearly , meeting each of these requirements alone is already a non - trivial task .    resolving the physically interesting scales",
    "means separating the intrinsic numerical diffusion existing in any scheme from its physical counterpart .",
    "simultaneously , it is desirable to cover scales much larger than the diffusive scales as well , in order to embed the problem in a realistic environment .",
    "currently , studies are restricted to one of these regimes , for obvious reasons .    there are various ways to parametrize the small - scale physics in the large scale approach .",
    "shock capturing is a familiar example ( for a detailed discussion see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "many finite - difference codes apply a von - neumann - richtmyer artificial viscosity @xcite , spreading out the shock across several support points and not affecting the solution in smooth regions .",
    "artificial viscosity mimicks physical viscosity in that it satisfies the rankine - hugoniot conditions , but on a much larger scale , which renders the numerical scheme very robust at low computational cost .",
    "it operates only where the flow is compressive .",
    "galsgaard & nordlund @xcite implemented an artificial resistivity algorithm similar to artifical viscosity in their simulations of formation and dissipation of current sheets in the solar corona ; see also caunt & korpi @xcite .     current sheet capturing \" is intrinsically more complex than shock capturing .",
    "as we discuss in  4.3 , the energy dissipated by a shock is independent of the magnitude of the diffusivity , but this does not hold for a current sheet . moreover , the topological evolution of the magnetic field is determined primarily by processes in current sheets , and this imposes additional requirements on how they are treated .",
    "detailed , small scale studies could be useful for developing a parameterization of the effects of diffusion on energy balance and topology .",
    "this is reminiscent of the approach taken in large eddy simulations , which numerically resolve the largest scales while treating the unresolved scales with a subgrid model ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "godunov - type methods @xcite avoid broadening the shocks over many zones .",
    "they solve the riemann problem defined by a set of advection equations for the physical variables and the physical states on both sides of the discontinuity .",
    "the upstream and downstream states are connected by a sequence of shocks or rarefaction waves , each of which satisfies the rankine - hugoniot conditions . as implementation of a full riemann solver would involve determining the full wave structure and all wave propagation speeds , a variety of approximate riemann solvers has been designed to simplify the process by disregarding certain wave types or linearizing the problem ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "riemann solvers utilize the wave nature of hyperbolic equations , however , the diffusive terms are parabolic , so that they can not be included in the riemann solver directly .",
    "an alternative approach has been taken in the so - called bgk - schemes @xcite , using the collisionless boltzmann equation as a model of gas dynamics ( see @xcite , and @xcite for mhd ) .",
    "needless to say , the @xmath129 regime can not be captured by numerical codes which solve the ideal fluid equations ( @xmath130 ) , since the numerical diffusivities for magnetic field and velocity are about the same size and occur at about the same scale , i.e. the grid scale .",
    "this is an argument for including viscosity and resistivity in the equations , in which case the physical diffusivities must be larger than their numerical counterparts , and their scales must be well separated .",
    "this is the approach taken by maron & cowley @xcite , who used a spectral code to study turbulence with widely separated , but resolved , viscous and resistive scales .",
    "several efforts have been made to connect the spatial scales by adaptive mesh refinement techniques @xcite for large eddy simulations @xcite , general hyperbolic systems @xcite , incompressible non - ideal mhd @xcite and for compressible mhd @xcite .",
    "however , turbulent flows by definition connect scales over the whole domain , which complicates finding a suitable refinement criterion and may in the end yield only modest savings of time .",
    "we have seen in ",
    "[ subsubsec : macroparm ] that timescales in astrophysical problems can differ by several orders of magnitude .",
    "including diffusive processes aggravates the problem , as their time scales are generally orders of magnitude longer than the dynamical times .",
    "any disparity in timescales leads to a stiff problem .",
    "explicit methods  often the first choice because of their low time and memory needs  advance the solution by a time step @xmath131 which is given by the so - called courant - friedrichs - levy ( cfl ) condition @xcite @xmath132 with the distance between two support points @xmath52 and a characteristic propagation speed @xmath133 .",
    "disparate characteristic speeds then lead to severe time step restrictions .",
    "moreover , the slowly varying components may introduce numerical errors @xcite .",
    "one solution to the problem is to choose a short timestep for the fast processes , and update the variables controlled by slow processes less frequently .",

    "@xcite used this so - called subcycling in their implementation of ambipolar diffusion in the zeus code . depending on the problem ,",
    "the critical processes often can be broken out and treated implicitly , while the remaining equations can be treated explicitly @xcite .",
    "fully implicit schemes ( e.g. @xcite ) can be unconditionally stable and independent of the time step chosen .",
    "their main limitation lies in the tremendous computational needs in the multi - dimensional case . for a discussion of implicit methods and for a comparison between explicit and implicit shock capturing methods",

    "see @xcite .",
    "as this brief discussion shows , a great variety of techniques can be brought to bear on mhd turbulence problems .",
    "which technique is best depends very much on the problem at hand .",
    "theory offers an interpretive framework for simulations , while numerical experiments test turbulence theory , and can inspire new developments . here , we discuss amplification of a field by turbulence in the context of dynamo theory , magnetic fluctuations , the formation of current sheets , and the dynamical effects of turbulence on large scales .",
    "the first three of these problems are closely related .",
    "the fourth is topical in view of recent simulations of star forming regions .",
    "amplification of a weak magnetic field by turbulence is one of the main components of dynamo theory .",
    "a successful astrophysical dynamo theory must demonstrate that a dominant , large scale magnetic field can be generated by small scale turbulence , on a timescale which is virtually independent of the lundquist number @xmath15 in the limit @xmath134 .",
    "this is a highly nonlinear problem , which involves multiple scales .",
    "it probably can not be solved without numerical simulations , but in view of the extreme parameters involved it is unlikely to yield to brute force alone .",
    "the growth rate of magnetic energy in a periodic domain is given by eqn .",
    "( [ wdot ] ) .",
    "although the resistive term appears as a sink , some resistivity is necessary to effect irreversible topological change .",
    "amplification occurs through work done by the flow . in general",
    ", there is also a surface integral @xmath135 on the rhs of eqn .",
    "( [ wdot ] ) , which represents an energy flux through the boundaries .    equation ( [ wdot ] ) says nothing about the structure of the field , and , in particular , whether magnetic energy is concentrated at large or small scales .",
    "if we formally set @xmath136 , the ratio of fieldstrength to line length is preserved by incompressible motions .",
    "the only way to lengthen fieldlines in a finite volume is to wind or tangle them .",
    "therefore , we expect that most of the energy will be in the _ rms _ field , rather than in the mean field .",
    "for example , if the protogalactic magnetic field were 10@xmath137 g @xcite , the fieldlines would have been lengthened by more than a factor of 10@xmath138 in the course of amplifying the field to its present strength . yet , the large scale and small scale components of the galactic magnetic field are observed to be roughly equal @xcite .",
    "it is not enough to argue that magnetic forces will prevent the field from becoming tangled on small scales .",
    "if the lines are nt somehow lengthened , the field wo nt be strengthened .",
    "of course , we are interested in @xmath139 , not @xmath136 . the fieldlines are allowed to break , and the question is whether they do so in a way which prevents power from piling up at the resistive scale and peaking instead at the large scale . because @xmath15 is so large , topological constraints are strong , and we expect resistive boundary layers to form",
    ".    let s see how theories and simulations of dynamo theory address this problem .",
    "the most influential and detailed dynamo theory is the so - called mean field theory , which was proposed by parker @xcite , and extended and formalized by steenbeck , krause & rdler @xcite .",
    "mean field theory is based on the idea that a large scale magnetic field @xmath140 can be generated from the average inductive electric field @xmath141 associated with small scale , helical velocity and magnetic fluctuations @xmath142 , @xmath143 .",

    "there is also diffusive transport of @xmath140 , which is known as the @xmath83 effect .",
    "although @xmath144 and @xmath83 are in general tensors , it suffices for our purposes to write them as scalars .",

    "( [ faraday ] ) and ( [ e ] ) .    if @xmath144 and @xmath83 are independent of @xmath140 , eqn ( [ meanind ] ) is linear in @xmath140 .",

( [ meanind ] ) has solutions which vary exponentially in time . at large shear and low wavenumber @xmath148 ,",
    "the growth rate is approximately the geometric mean of the shear rate @xmath149 and the turbulent frequency @xmath150 .",

    "a completely different perspective on kinematic dynamo theory emerges from solutions of the full magnetic induction equation for prescribed , chaotic flow .",
    "these studies , which are fully described up to 1995 in the volume by childress & gilbert @xcite , use a combination of numerical simulations at large @xmath12 and analytical theory to establish connections between the properties of the flow and the properties of the magnetic field . although there are known examples of flows which amplify the magnetic field at a rate independent of @xmath12 , as originally shown by galloway & proctor @xcite , the fields produced by these so - called fast dynamos are highly intermittent in space and fluctuate in sign , confirming at least qualitatively that small scale fields are dominant in kinematic dynamos at high @xmath12 .",

    "the differences in the spectra obtained with different codes and under different forms of driving ( biskamp & mller studied decaying or isotropically forced turbulence , cho & vishniac studied isotropically forced turbulence , and maron & goldreich studied anisotropically forced turbulence ) are at this point comparable to the theoretical disagreements . a joint exercise in which different groups simulated identical problems and implemented identical diagnostics",

    "in sweet - parker reconnection , @xmath183 @xcite , and resistive tearing modes in slabs and cylinders have @xmath184 , and @xmath185 , respectively @xcite .",
    "the formation and behavior of current sheets has been studied for many years .",
    "most of this work has focussed on plasmas in or near magnetostatic equilibrium , which can be expected if @xmath186 and the plasma is either allowed to relax or is driven at frequencies far below its characteristic alfvn frequency .",
    "such conditions hold , for example , in stellar coronae , in which the magnetic fieldlines are tied to the underlying photosphere , and evolve quasistatically in response to slow photospheric motion .    current sheets form as a plasma seeks equilibrium while obeying the topological constraints imposed by flux freezing @xcite .",
    "topological constraints can arise from features such as null points @xcite or separatrices @xcite .",
    "sweet  @xcite and parker  @xcite suggested that shearing and winding the footpoints of an initially uniform field will create current sheets .",
    "even a simple sinusoidal deformation of the boundaries of a sheared magnetic slab can induce the formation of a current sheet @xcite .    as a simple example of how current sheets can form , consider the magnetic field of a pair of neighboring , uniformly magnetized superconducting spheres , with antiparallel magnetic dipole moments , surrounded by a perfectly conducting , zero pressure plasma .",
    "some fieldlines have both endpoints on the same sphere , and others have one endpoint on each sphere .",
    "now suppose that one sphere rotates on its magnetic axis by an angle @xmath34 .",
    "the fieldlines which are not connected to the other sphere also rotate by @xmath34 , but the fieldlines which are connected to the other sphere can not rotate uniformly because one endpoint remains fixed . the separatrix surface which divides the two domains of magnetic connectivity becomes a current sheet : the field outside it is sheared while the field inside it is not .",
    "there is still no comprehensive theory for exactly when current sheets form , and how their properties reflect the underlying magnetic topology .",
    "nevertheless , analytical arguments @xcite and numerical experiments @xcite show that shear , or equivalently current density , grows exponentially rapidly in line tied magnetic fields with randomly moving footpoints .",
    "this has some of the same consequences as an exact singularity , which can not form in any case in even a slightly resistive plasma .",
    "these results are not fully applicable to mhd turbulence , in which the magnetic field is not in equilibrium . nevertheless , current sheets form in flows with magnetic null points @xcite . the underlying mechanism for the growth of the current is the random stretching of neighboring fieldlines , which leads to large cross - field shear .",
    "what are the consequences of current sheet formation for dissipation of magnetic energy ? that is , if energy per unit volume @xmath187 is being added to a system by a driving process , under what circumstances can this energy can be dissipated in current sheets ?    consider a current sheet of area @xmath188 and width @xmath189 .",
    "assume the current sheet structure is given by the sweet - parker theory , so that @xmath190 . if @xmath191 is the number density of current sheets with @xmath57 between @xmath57 and @xmath192 , then the rate at which energy is dissipated by current sheets in this size range is @xmath193 the rate of energy dissipation by all current sheets is obtained by integrating eqn .",
    "( [ dotdw ] ) over @xmath57 : @xmath194 if @xmath187 is independent of @xmath37 as @xmath195 , then @xmath196 must scale as @xmath197 in this limit .",
    "this would imply an unbounded number of current sheets as @xmath139 , which is virtually equivalent to a pileup of magnetic energy in fluctuations at the resistive scale .",
    "there are alternative possibilities .",
    "one is that the current sheets are not structured according to the sweet - parker picture .",
    "if @xmath189 scaled as @xmath37 , as it does ( up to a logarithmic factor ) in petschek s model of fast reconnection ( reviewed in @xcite ) , then @xmath196 could be independent of @xmath37 .",
    "note , however , that while in the sweet - parker theory , magnetic energy is converted to kinetic energy and to heat at about the same rate , in petschek s theory magnetic energy is converted predominantly to kinetic energy , and that the realizability of petschek s model has recently been questioned @xcite .",
    "the second possibility is that the magnetic and velocity fields adjust themselves such that the driving just balances the damping , as they do in mechanical systems such as linear harmonic oscillators .",
    "thus , the energy input rate @xmath187 would depend on @xmath37 , while the applied force itself , presumably would not .",
    "dedicated simulations of current sheets and reconnection regions themselves allow us to study the small scale aspects of the problem .",
    "it is equally important to understand how current sheets are embedded in the overall flow .",
    "this has already been done to some extent for laboratory experiments @xcite .",
    "ultimately , it may be possible to parameterize magnetic reconnection in simulations on larger scales .    finally , we mention an even more extreme form of intermittency : the segregation of the magnetic field into thin tubes .",
    "this is observed in the solar photosphere , where magnetic flux tubes , or sheets , just a few hundred km thick are seen at the borders of convective cells .",
    "flux tubes can form only in high @xmath83 plasma , so that gas pressure can balance magnetic pressure at the tube walls .",
    "early attempts to explain photospheric flux tubes relied on a two stage process , proposed by parker , for concentrating a diffuse field into organized structures . according to this scenario , thermal convection would sweep the field to the borders of convective cells , concentrating the field up to equipartition with the flow .",
    "then reduced convective heat transport would cool the gas ,  collapsing \" the tube and bringing it to equipartition with the thermal plasma .",
    "an alternative possibility is that intermittent fields are generated _ in situ_. it has been shown that small scale turbulent thermal convection operates as a dynamo , and generates a magnetic field with a broad tail of high energy features @xcite .",
    "it is unclear whether a dynamo operating in a high @xmath83 plasma should always produce flux tubes . in the solar case ,",
    "the turbulence is organized by stratification and the thermal gradient , and is subsonic .",
    "if the turbulence were supersonic and the field were amplified to equipartition , then flux tubes could not persist .",
    "the stresses associated with turbulence can exert dynamical forces . in mhd turbulence ,",
    "these forces include both magnetic stresses and the reynolds stress .",
    "observations suggest that these stresses are important in the interstellar medium , and especially in molecular clouds .",
    "it was realized early that supersonic motions are nearly ubiquitous in molecular gas , and pose a problem .",
    "if the motions are associated with gravitational collapse , the implied star formation rate would be very high @xcite , but if the motions are turbulent , they should be dissipated very quickly @xcite .",
    "this conundrum , together with the expectation that reasonably strong magnetic fields should be present , prompted analytical studies of alfvnic turbulence under molecular cloud conditions @xcite .",
    "this work demonstrated that even when @xmath198 and the waves are purely transverse , ion - neutral friction and nonlinear steepening are strong damping mechanisms , which limit the lifetimes of alfvn waves to a few 10@xmath199 yr or less under molecular cloud conditions .",
    "even so , under the assumption that the waves might be replenished by some energy source , various aspects of the theory of self gravitating clouds supported by alfvn wave stresses were developed and applied to model clouds @xcite . according to this theory , which is based on the the weak turbulence approach pioneered by dewar @xcite , alfvn waves have an isotropic stress tensor @xmath200 .",
    "the waves pressure - density relation is @xmath201 in a stratified , static medium , while @xmath202 under slow , spatially uniform changes in density with time .",
    "the negative polytropic index ( @xmath203 ) of the @xmath204 relation leads to a large center to surface pressure contrast , in accord with observations ( see @xcite for a good discussion ) .",
    "the theory of wave supported clouds is most relevant to objects which are slightly magnetically supercritical , that is , the ratio of mass to magnetic flux is slightly too large for magnetostatic support .",
    "if the clouds were subcritical they would be supported by the dc magnetic field .",
    "if they were highly supercritical , the amplitude of the turbulence required to sustain them would be so large that the weak turbulence theory would probably not apply , although they could still be turbulently supported .",
    "> from an observational viewpoint , the most likely candidates for wave support are dense cores with sonic or mildly supersonic linewidths @xcite .",
    "the picture of strongly supersonic turbulence which emerges from numerical simulations of molecular clouds is quite different from this analytical picture , primarily because , as we discussed in  4.2 , generation of compressive disturbances is entirely unavoidable .",
    "these compressive disturbances , or shocks , sweep up most of the mass into thin layers in which the local jeans length is small . these layers , and the even denser structures formed where layers intersect , collapse if the domain is magnetically supercritical , whether the turbulence is freely decaying or maintained in a steady state by driving @xcite .",
    "the driven models are globally stable in the sense that @xmath88 computed using the total turbulent energy and mean density is larger than the length of the domain . the small , high density structures collapse because the turbulent power at wavelengths less than the local jeans length is relatively small ( see eqn .",
    "( [ lambdaj ] ) ) , and because the intensity of turbulence inside the cores is comparable with the density outside . nevertheless , the bound structures are small , and the role of numerical diffusion within them , which damps the turbulence and removes the support by the dc magnetic field , has not been quantified .",
    "therefore , while the formation of turbulently supported clumps has not been found in the numerical models , their existence can not be ruled out based on the present models .",
    "as we have discussed in the preceding sections , both theoretical and computational aspects of astrophysical magnetohydrodynamics are dogged persistently by the enormous value of @xmath12 .",
    "there is one situation , however , in which the magnetic diffusivity is large whether or not it is enhanced by turbulence : in weakly ionized gas , the magnetic field and plasma drift with respect to the neutrals .",
    "this so - called ambipolar drift is not entirely equivalent to resistive diffusion , because it preserves magnetic topology ( the field is frozen to the plasma ) , but it does change the ratio of magnetic flux to mass , as originally pointed out in @xcite , and dissipates fluctuations on small scales .",
    "full treatment of ambipolar drift requires solving the equations of mhd for the plasma and neutrals treated as distinct species coupled by collisions , ionization , and recombination @xcite . at the low ionization fractions expected in molecular clouds , the ion alfvn speed @xmath205 can be several orders of magnitude larger than the other characteristic speeds in the problem , reducing the maximum possible timestep by a similar factor .",
    "this and other numerical issues related to implementation of ambipolar drift are discussed by @xcite .    on timescales longer than the ion - neutral collision time @xmath206 , and at low ionized mass fractions , the ion - neutral drift @xmath207 is determined by balancing the lorentz force on the ions against the frictional drag by neutrals @xmath208 where @xmath209 is a unit vector in the direction of the lorentz force . the second equality in eqn . ( [ vd ] ) can be taken as a definition of the magnetic lengthscale @xmath56 .",
    "the quantity @xmath210 has units of diffusivity , and from now on we refer to it as @xmath211 . with this definition ,",
    "note that @xmath213 and @xmath214 , so @xmath215 , and @xmath211 is often expressed in the latter terms .",
    "the ambipolar reynolds number @xmath216 is defined as the ratio of the bulk velocity @xmath84 to the drift velocity @xmath207 @xmath217 and measures how well the magnetic field is frozen to the bulk fluid on scale @xmath56 @xcite . setting @xmath218 correctly predicts the thickness of shocks in which the main dissipation mechanism is ion - neutral friction @xcite , the wavelength at which alfvn waves are critically damped @xcite , and the minimum size of an eddy which can wind up a magnetic field @xcite .",
    "simulations of supersonic mhd turbulence @xcite with varying strengths of ambipolar drift shows that , on average , the drift smooths out the current , and reduces the rms lorentz force .",
    "we expect ( with one caveat discussed at the end of this section ) that the magnetic field should show very little structure below the scale @xmath219 at which @xmath220 .",
    "consider a volume @xmath221 of turbulent gas with mean density @xmath222 , turbulent velocity @xmath84 , and mean magnetic field @xmath223 .",

    "of course , eqn .",
    "( [ lmin ] ) is entirely independent of @xmath239 .",
    "the modest value of @xmath216 in molecular clouds has been commented upon and exploited by @xcite .",
    "ambipolar drift is essentially diffusive when the magnetic field has a well ordered , well combed structure . because the ambipolar diffusivity is proportional to @xmath240 ,",
    "the diffusion is nonlinear .",
    "sharp fronts can be generated in the vicinity of magnetic nulls , and minima are steepened @xcite .",
    "the theme of this paper is how numerical simulations can best cope with the enormous magnetic reynolds numbers encountered in most astrophysical problems .",
    "we argued that , because @xmath12 ( and the lundquist number @xmath15 ) are so large , resistive effects occur primarily in thin sheets or filaments , which must be treated accurately in order to follow the topological evolution of the magnetic field .    in  2 , we reviewed the magnetic induction equation , giving the solution in the ideal limit , and derived equations for magnetic helicity and magnetic energy .",
    "we tested helicity conservation in the zeus code by simulating the evolution of the ideal kink mode , and studied fluctuations of helicity in a simulation of a turbulent cloud .",
    "the first of these problems is especially suitable for benchmarking numerical codes .",
    "that is , it yields a quantitative estimate of the numerical resistivity in the code , from which one can compute the resistive timescale ( at least in smooth regions , on large scales ) and assess whether it is much longer than other timescales of interest .",
    "one can also compare the performance of different codes .    in  3 , we discussed some important dimensionless parameters in astrophysical mhd problems .",
    "we verified the large size of the lundquist number @xmath15 and magnetic reynolds number @xmath12 under most conditions , and showed that the magnetic prandtl number , the ratio of viscous to magnetic diffusivity , is also usually large .",
    "this implies that magnetic structure will generally extend to smaller scales than velocity structure .",
    "we briefly summarized a variety of numerical techniques from the perspective of the large @xmath15 limit .    in  4",
    ", we discussed theoretical and numerical results on several basic problems . in ",
    "4.1 we discussed the amplification of magnetic fields by turbulence , and argued that the successful operation of a large scale dynamo depends on fast diffusion of the magnetic field . in ",

    "4.4 , we discussed the dynamical effects of turbulence , and its importance in molecular clouds .    in  5 , we discussed ambipolar drift as a mechanism for increasing the magnetic diffusivity in low density , weakly ionized gas .",
    "it is now possible to simulate turbulent molecular clouds at a resolution which accounts for all magnetic structure down to the ambipolar diffusion scale . under certain conditions ,",
    "however , ambipolar drift can mediate the formation of current sheets , possibly leading to rapid magnetic reconnection .",
    "it is fortunate that a number of different groups are simulating mhd turbulence under astrophysical conditions , using a variety of codes and techniques .",
