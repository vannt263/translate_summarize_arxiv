    "the mixed phase of type - ii superconductors with random pinning is generally regarded to be an archetypal test system for the study of the effects of quenched disorder on the structure and melting of solids . in this phase ,",
    "magnetic flux penetrates the sample as quantized vortex lines which form a special physical system known as `` vortex matter '' .",
    "the fascinating equilibrium and dynamical properties of vortex matter in the mixed phase of high - temperature superconductors ( htscs ) have prompted considerable experimental and theoretical attention for more than a decade ( see ref .",
    "for an early review ) . the mixed phase of htscs is strongly affected by the presence of pinning centers , either intrinsic or artificially generated .",
    "understanding the effects of pinning in these systems is basic for practical applications because pinning strongly influences the value of the critical current @xcite .",
    "the vortex lines in a pure type - ii superconductor form a triangular lattice ( the abrikosov lattice ) at low temperatures .",
    "because of enhanced thermal fluctuations in highly anisotropic , layered htscs , the abrikosov lattice in very pure samples , in a magnetic field perpendicular to the layers ( the field will be assumed to be in this direction throughout our discussion ) , undergoes a first - order melting transition@xcite into a resistive vortex liquid ( vl ) as the temperature @xmath0 increases .",
    "random pinning destroys the long - range translational order of the abrikosov lattice and leads to the occurrence of a variety of glassy phases at low @xmath0 .",
    "it is now generally accepted that in systems with random point pinning , a topologically ordered low - temperature phase with quasi - long - range translational order ( denoted as the `` bragg glass '' ( brg ) phase ) occurs at low fields if the pinning disorder is sufficiently weak .",
    "this has been established theoretically @xcite as well as experimentally ( see e.g. ref .  ) .",
    "the possibility of an amorphous vortex glass ( vg ) phase , with nonlinear voltage - current characteristics and vanishing resistance in the zero - current limit , in systems with strong pinning ( or at high magnetic fields where the effects of pinning disorder are enhanced ) was suggested by fisher@xcite ( see also ref .  ) .",
    "however , in spite of extensive investigations , the existence of a true vg phase ( i.e. , an amorphous glassy phase thermodynamically distinct from the high - temperature vl ) in systems with uncorrelated point pinning remains very controversial : different calculations @xcite lead to different conclusions and the experimental situation@xcite is similarly contradictory .",
    "a variety of `` glassy '' behavior has been reported in different experiments ( see ref .   and references therein ) near the first - order melting transition of the brg phase of both conventional superconductors and htscs with point pinning .",
    "it has been suggested@xcite that these observations may be understood if it is assumed that the melting of the brg phase occurs in two steps : the brg first transforms into a `` multidomain '' glassy phase that melts into the usual vl at a slightly higher @xmath0 .",
    "columnar pinning defects can be produced for example as damage tracks arising from heavy - ion bombardment .",
    "the technological importance of these extended defects oriented parallel to the direction of the external magnetic field has been long recognized@xcite : they are highly effective in increasing the critical current by localizing vortex lines along their length .",
    "heavy - ion irradiation produces a random array of parallel columnar defects each of which can trap one or more vortices at low temperatures .",
    "the effects of such random arrays of extended defects , oriented perpendicular to the superconducting layers , on the properties of the mixed phase of htscs have been extensively studied experimentally@xcite .",
    "the same question has also been examined theoretically@xcite and numerically@xcite . when the columnar pinning is strong , and their concentration exceeds that of the vortex lines , a so - called `` strong '' bose glass ( bog ) phase with nearly all the vortex lines localized at the pinning centers occurs@xcite at low @xmath0 .",
    "this phase is strongly disordered with very short - range translational and bond - orientational correlations .",
    "the behavior in this regime is fairly well - understood in terms of a mapping@xcite of the thermodynamics of the system to the quantum mechanical properties of a two - dimensional system of interacting bosons in a random potential .",
    "much less is known about the behavior in the dilute pin limit where the concentration of pins is much smaller than that of vortex lines . in such systems , one expects@xcite a `` weak '' bog phase at low temperatures , with a small fraction of vortex lines localized strongly at the pinning centers and the remaining ones localized relatively weakly in the interstitial region between pinning centers . as the temperature",
    "is increased , this phase should@xcite melt into an interstitial liquid ( il ) . in the il phase ,",
    "some of the vortices remain trapped at the pinning centers , while the other , interstitial ones , form a liquid .",
    "the pinned vortices are expected@xcite to delocalize , thereby forming the usual vl , at a crossover occuring at a higher temperature .",
    "the melting transition of the `` weak '' bog phase into the il is predicted@xcite to be first - order for small pin concentrations , whereas the `` strong '' bog to vl transition occurring for large pin concentrations is known@xcite to be a continuous one .",
    "a first - order melting transition of the `` weak '' bog phase has been observed@xcite in recent experiments on samples of @xmath1 ( bscco ) with a small concentration of columnar pins .",
    "the bog phase in these systems is found@xcite to have a polycrystalline structure with ordered vortex crystallites of different orientations embedded in the interstitial region between vortices pinned at the columnar defects .",
    "if the pin concentration is sufficiently small , the melting of this bog phase upon increasing the temperature occurs into an il phase with a fraction of vortex lines remaining pinned at the defects .",
    "these pinned vortices delocalize at a higher temperature@xcite .",
    "the temperature at which the first - order bog to il transition occurs is@xcite very close to the melting temperature of the same system without the columnar pins , if the pin concentration is small . as the pin concentration",
    "is increased , the melting temperature increases and the transition eventually becomes continuous .",
    "the difference between the melting temperature and the temperature at which the pinned vortices in the il phase delocalizes decreases and eventually goes to zero as the pin concentration increases .",
    "another interesting feature , found experimentally for both point@xcite and columnar@xcite pinning , is that the melting of the low @xmath0 `` solid '' phase is `` inhomogeneous '' in that it occurs locally over a range of temperatures : the local transition temperature , which can be measured from the local magnetization , is different in different regions of the sample .",
    "this inhomogeneity of the local melting temperature is believed@xcite to be closely related to the local arrangement of the specific pinning centers ( the so - called `` pinning landscape '' ) in each sample studied .",
    "the polycrystalline nature of the bog phase for small pin concentrations has also been observed in simulations@xcite .",
    "recent numerical work@xcite indicates that a brg phase , with topological order , may also exist in such systems provided that the pin concentration is sufficiently small . in these simulations ,",
    "the brg phase is found to melt into the il phase via a first - order transition as the temperature is increased .",
    "as the pin concentration is increased beyond a critical value , the brg phase disappears@xcite and a low - temperature bog phase with a continuous bog to il transition upon increasing the temperature is found@xcite .    in this paper , we approach these problems through a different numerical method .",
    "we consider a layered , strongly anisotropic superconductor ( such as bscco ) with a dilute random array of columnar defects oriented perpendicular to the layers , and with a magnetic field applied parallel to the columnar pins .",
    "we describe the equilibrium properties of this system in terms of vortex density variables , using a free energy functional of the ramakrishnan - yussouff@xcite ( ry ) form .",
    "we numericall minimize a spatially discretized version of this free energy functional and obtain the vortex density configuration at each local minimum .",
    "analysis of these density configurations , both in terms of a variety of correlation functions and by direct visualization of the arrangement of the vortices ( vortex positions are identified with those of local peaks of the vortex density ) , allows us to identify the nature of the phases corresponding to different local minima of the free energy .",
    "comparison of the values of the free energy at the minima as the temperature varies yields the transition temperatures .",
    "a similar procedure has been successfully employed for the case of a regular array@xcite of columnar pinning centers .",
    "we find in our study that that a bragg glass phase exists at low temperatures for samples with a small concentration of columnar pins .",
    "we will present evidence for this phase from our analysis of the vortex density and associated correlation functions . upon warming",
    ", this phase melts into what we show to be an insterstitial liquid ( il ) phase , but the melting is shown@xcite to occur in two steps : the brg and il phases are separated , over a narrow temperature range , by an intermediate phase which exhibits a multi - domain polycrystalline structure .",
    "we show that this intermediate phase should be identified as a bose glass ( bog ) .",
    "the temperature of the upper ( bog to il ) transition is approximately independent of the columnar pin concentration @xmath2 , at the low @xmath2 values studied .",
    "both the brg to bog and the bog to il transitions are found to be first - order .",
    "we also find that a local melting temperature can be suitably defined using a criterion based on the degree of localization of the vortices , and that its behavior ( in particular , its spatial variation ) is quite consistent with what is seen in experiments@xcite .",
    "the value of the local melting temperature is strongly correlated with the presence of topological defects ( dislocations ) in the vortex solid which , in turn , is correlated with the local arrangement of the pinning centers . we also show that the transition to the il phase corresponds to a percolation of regions containing liquid - like ( delocalized ) vortices across the sample .    after this introduction",
    ", we discuss our definitions , model and numerical methods in the next section .",
    "then in section [ results ] we present our results .",
    "we discuss first the free energy minima and their study through the use of tools such as correlation functions , local peak - density plots , and voronoi construction for the lattice formed by local density peaks .",
    "these tools allow the identification of the phases at each free energy minimum , as we shall show .",
    "then we derive the phase diagram and show that indeed the brg and il phases are separated by a thin sliver of bog .",
    "finally , our results for the nature of the local melting are displayed and discussed .",
    "a brief conclusions section recapitulates the main points of the paper and discusses them in the context of existing results .",
    "the general procedures that we use are quite similar to those employed in previous work on a regular array of columnar pins@xcite",
    ". we will therefore give here only a brief summary , emphasizing the details that are different in the random case considered here .",
    "the system we study is a layered superconductor in the extreme anisotropic limit , that is , with vanishing josephson coupling between layers , which are then coupled via the electromagnetic interaction only .",
    "this limit is appropriate for the bi- and tl- based htsc compounds in a large region of the magnetic field ( @xmath3)@xmath0 plane . in this work",
    ", we will use material parameter values appropriate to bscco . with these assumptions , one can write the energy of a system of `` pancake '' vortices residing in the layers as a sum of anisotropic two - body interactions . for straight columnar pins normal to the layers ,",
    "the pinning potential is the same in every layer .",
    "it is then possible to write the free energy as a functional of the _ time averaged _ areal vortex density @xmath4 : @xmath5-f_0=f_{ry}[\\rho]+f_p[\\rho ] .",

    "this range is determined by the following considerations .",
    "we will keep the field fixed at @xmath35 t , and vary the temperature .",
    "the melting temperature of the unpinned lattice is then @xmath36k@xcite , and we , therefore , consider the neighborhood of this temperature .",

    "this value , as pointed out in ref .  , is slightly higher than that of a triangular vortex lattice of density @xmath43 , which is @xmath44 .",
    "we define at each site @xmath45 on this computational lattice a variable @xmath46 , with @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the area of each computational unit cell .",
    "results reported here are for @xmath49 , which , for the chosen value of @xmath39 , corresponds to including @xmath50 4096 vortices in the calculation .",
    "preliminary and confirmatory results at @xmath51 ( 1024 vortices ) were also obtained .",
    "a number of pinning sites ( @xmath52 ) are put , at random , on some of the computational lattice sites .",
    "the results presented here , which correspond to the dilute limit , will be primarily for a pin concentration @xmath2 of @xmath53 , that is , a number of pins @xmath54 at @xmath49 ( or @xmath55 at @xmath51 ) .",
    "some preliminary results for @xmath56 ( @xmath57 at @xmath49 , or @xmath58 at @xmath51 ) will also be discussed briefly . with random pins ,",
    "the results depend on the particular random pin configuration and averaging over different such configurations is required .",
    "the dependence is however not strong : as we shall see , averaging over five to ten configurations is enough to make statistical errors sufficiently small for our purposes .    to perform our studies",
    ", we numerically minimize the discretized free energy with respect to the @xmath40 discretized density variables @xmath59 . to do so , the interaction term in the right side of eq .",
    "( [ ryfe ] ) must be repeatedly evaluated , and since this term is of a convolution form , this is most efficiently done in momentum space , through the use of efficient fast fourier transform ( fft ) routines .",
    "this avoids having to evaluate this term as a double sum which would be computationally much more cumbersome than performing the direct and inverse fft s . in performing the minimization",
    ", one must keep in mind that the variables @xmath59 must be nonnegative .",
    "this precludes the use of many efficient minimization algorithms .",
    "we use a procedure@xcite that ensures that this constraint is satisfied .",
    "numerical minimization is performed starting with an appropriate initial condition for the density variables .",
    "as explained in sec .  [ results ] below , different local minima may be found , at the same field and temperature , depending on the initial conditions .",
    "these minima correspond to different phases .",
    "the minimization procedure yields not only the value of the free energy at each minimum but also the detailed vortex density configuration at the minimum found , i.e. the values of the set @xmath59 at the minimum .",
    "it is then straightforward to analyze the actual density configuration in several ways .",
    "it is also possible to evaluate any desired density correlations .",
    "the nature of the phase corresponding to each local minimum of the free energy can be inferred from such analysis .",
    "the ( mean - field ) phase diagram is then obtained from a comparison of the free energies of the different minima as the temperature @xmath0 is varied .",
    "the results of carrying out this program are discussed below .",
    "as explained above , minima of the free energy are found by starting the minimization process with appropriate initial conditions .",
    "we use three different kinds of initial conditions .",
    "the first kind is a uniform density ( @xmath60 for all @xmath61 ) , corresponding to a completely disordered liquid state .",
    "this is typically used to obtain , as we shall see , liquid - like states at temperatures near the equilibrium melting temperature of the pure vortex lattice , which is@xcite @xmath62k for the value of @xmath8 considered here .",
    "the second kind corresponds to a crystalline initial state , with values of @xmath59 as obtained in ref .   for the pure vortex lattice . in our system with a spatially varying random pinning potential ,",
    "the pinning energy of such a crystalline density configuration depends on the choice of the computational lattice sites at which the periodic local peaks of the density are located .",
    "we take , among all possible choices equivalent by symmetry operations in the computational lattice , the one for which the pinning energy is lowest for the specific pinning configuration under consideration .",
    "these initial conditions are used to obtain ordered states at lower temperatures .",
    "finally , states originally obtained by either of these two procedures can be slowly warmed up , or cooled down : in this case the initial conditions are simply the final state obtained at the previous temperature . as one warms up or cools down a state , its nature in general changes",
    ": liquid configurations may become unstable upon cooling and ordered configurations upon warming .    whichever initial conditions one uses , a local minimum of the free energy is eventually found . at a given temperature , in general several local minima with different density configurations , characterized by the values of the set of @xmath59 variables ,",
    "are obtained .",
    "the minimum with the lowest free energy represents , at a given @xmath0 , the true equilibrium state .",
    "it is obviously necessary to develop systematic procedures to identify the structure of each of these diverse minima . since we have access to the full set of density variables at the computational lattice sites , we have at our disposal a variety of methods to achieve that goal .",
    "the first is to calculate the density correlations , e.g. the structure factor @xmath63 : @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the discrete fourier transform of the set @xmath59 .",
    "equivalently , one can consider the fourier transform of @xmath63 , which is the two - point spatial correlation function @xmath66 of the time - averaged local density .",
    "we will present here results for @xmath63 , considered as a function of the vector @xmath67 , and for the angularly averaged spatial density correlation function , @xmath68 .",
    "it is also very useful to consider the spatial structure formed by the _",
    "vortices _ at low temperatures . for this purpose",
    "we have extracted from @xmath59 the local peak densities .",
    "we say that the density locally peaks at site @xmath61 if the value of @xmath46 at @xmath69 is higher than that at any other computational lattice site within a distance @xmath70 from @xmath61 , where , as defined above , @xmath71 is the equilibrium spacing of the unpinned vortex lattice .",
    "as expected , we find that at low - temperature solid - like minima where the vortices are strongly localized , the number of local density peaks matches the number of vortices @xmath72 .",
    "the positions of these peaks determine what we will call the `` vortex lattice '' .",
    "much useful information about the spatial structure of this vortex lattice may be obtained by plotting directly the local density values at the vortex lattice points .",
    "an excellent , and complementary , alternative to help elucidate the degree of vortex lattice order is to carry out a voronoi construction : we recall that in the voronoi construction one determines cells around each lattice point by a wigner - seitz procedure . in a perfect crystal ,",
    "all the resulting wigner - seitz cells are identical , while in the general case the cells can have different sizes and shapes .",
    "the number of sides of the wigner - seitz cell surrounding a lattice point is identified with the number of `` nearest neighbors '' of that lattice point , and the difference between this number and the average ( six in our case ) marks the position of defects ( disclinations ) .",
    "we will make use of such plots below .    since we will be concerned not only about translational , but also with orientational order",
    ", we will also examine the bond - orientational correlation function @xmath73 in the vortex lattice defined as :    [ angular ] @xmath74 where the angular brackets denote overall average over the vortex lattice and the field @xmath75 is given by : @xmath76\\ ] ]    with @xmath77 being the angle that the bond connecting a vortex at @xmath78 to its @xmath45-th neighbor makes with a fixed axis , and @xmath79 is the number of neighbors of the vortex at @xmath78 .",
    "it is also possible , and as we shall see , useful , to define what we will call a `` translational correlation function '' in the vortex lattice in a way that is quite analogous to the definition of @xmath73 .",
    "this function , which we denote as @xmath80 , is defined by an equation identical to the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ ang1 ] ) , but with the field @xmath81 being defined as @xmath82 where @xmath83 is a reciprocal lattice vector of the triangular vortex lattice in the absence of pinning .",

    "1c of ref .  ) .",

    "this happens beyond the upper limit of the temperature range ( 16.8k @xmath102 18.8k ) we have considered here .    to study how the properties of a local minimum of the free energy change as the temperature is varied ,",
    "we have `` followed '' minima as the temperature changes : for example , starting with a minimum obtained by quenching to the lowest temperature of 16.8k , we `` follow '' that minimum to higher temperatures by increasing the temperature in small steps ( usually taken to be 0.2k ) and finding a new minimum at the higher temperature by running the minimization routine with the configuration at the minimum obtained at the previous temperature as the initial state .",

    "also , the low - temperature bog phase of the system in the presence of pinning is less ordered than the crystalline phase of the pure system , and the il phase is slightly more ordered than the vortex liquid in the system without pinning ( this is due to the local order of the vortices near the pinning centers which persists in the il phase ) .",
    "therefore , the net change of entropy in going from the bog phase to the il phase should be smaller than the entropy jump at the melting transition in the pure system . a comparison of our results for two sample sizes ( @xmath119 and 1024 ) does not show any appreciable dependence of the entropy changes on the sample size .",
    "we , therefore , conclude that there is no indication of any significant change in our phase diagram as the sample size is increased .",
    "since our mean - field treatment ignores the effects of fluctuations , it is important to address the question of whether one or both of the transitions found would become continuous if fluctuations were included .",
    "however , there are very few examples of such fluctuation - driven continuous transitions in three dimensions . in our calculations ,",
    "the effects of the electromagnetic interaction among vortices on different layers are included .",
    "so , we expect our results regarding the nature of the transition to remain valid if fluctuations were included .",
    "this conclusion is supported by the result that our density functional theory provides a _ quantitatively _ a correct account  @xcite of the first - order melting of the vortex lattice in the pure system .",
    "also , the transition in the presence of a small concentration of columnar defects is known to be first - order both experimentally  @xcite and from simulations  @xcite .",
    "the appearance of a sliver of the bog phase in our phase diagram may be qualitatively understood as arising from a competition between the elastic and pinning parts of the free energy .",
    "the elastic ( free ) energy plays a dominant role in the brg minima : the effect of the randomly located pinning centers is accommodated in this structure by small displacements of the vortices from their ideal lattice positions towards the nearest pinning center . where the occupation of a pinning center by a vortex would require a large displacement of the vortex ,",
    "the pinning center is _ not _ fully occupied .",
    "for this reason , the number of pinning centers occupied by vortices at a brg minimum is always slightly lower than the total number of pinning centers . at the corresponding bog minima , on the other hand , the pinning centers are always occupied ( except in very rare cases where",
    "two pinning centers are located very close to each other ) .",
    "since the bog minima are obtained from liquid - like initial conditions , the starting point has fully occupied pinning centers , and vortices localized in small crystalline patches in their immediate vicinity ( see , for example , the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] which shows such crystalline patches surrounding the pinning centers ) .",
    "the crystalline orientation of vortices around a vortex - binding pin site depends on the local arrangement of the pins.@xcite this orientation is , in general , different in different regions of the sample .",
    "these crystalline patches grow as the temperature is reduced , and eventually meet one another at grain boundaries to form a polycrystalline bog minimum .",
    "it is clear that the pinning centers are better accommodated in this structure than in the corresponding brg structure . on the other hand ,",
    "the creation of grain boundaries costs elastic energy .",
    "thus , the bog minima are expected to have lower pinning energy but higher elastic energy than the brg ones for the same pin configuration .",
    "the elastic energy dominates over the pinning energy at low temperatures in our low pin - concentration samples .",
    "this is why the brg phase is globally stable at low @xmath0 .",
    "both these components of the free energy decrease in magnitude as the temperature is increased .",
    "the softening of the lattice near the melting transition causes the elastic energy to decrease faster than the pinning energy .",
    "this makes the pinning component of the free energy more important than the elastic part near @xmath101 , thereby making the total free energy of the bog minima ( which , as discussed above , have lower pinning energy ) lower than that of the bog minima .",
    "the bog to il transition at a slightly higher temperature is driven by the usual entropic mechanism .",
    "we can substantiate this qualitative explanation by evaluating the pinning component of the free energy , as defined in eq .",
    "( [ pin ] ) , for the brg and bog minima .",
    "the results of our calculation , averaged over five samples ( each with 4096 vortices and 64 pins ) , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] .",
    "the pinning energy is negative for both kinds of minima , as expected .",
    "the absolute value of the pinning energy of the bog minima shows a smooth ( nearly linear ) decrease as the temperature is increased .",
    "this is because both the value of the parameter @xmath20 ( see eq .",
    "( [ single ] ) ) that determines the depth of the pining potential , and the height of the local density peak at a pinning center decrease with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "the plot for the brg minima shows a similar but much slower behavior , still monotonic or nearly so : it is not clear whether the very shallow minimum near @xmath0 = 17.6k is significant . in some of the samples ,",
    "the total number of occupied pining centers increases by a small amount near this temperature , thereby reducing the value of the total pinning energy .",
    "this may reflect a better accommodation of the pinning centers by the lattice , which softens as the temperature is increased .",
    "this plot clearly demonstrates that the pinning centers are better accommodated at the bog minima .",
    "the difference in the pinning energies of the two kinds of minima decreases with increasing @xmath0 , but the difference in the elastic component of the free energy decreases faster ( this is clear from our results for the total free energy ) due to a softening of the elastic constants with increasing temperature .",
    "the overall effect is a crossing of the free energies of the two kinds of minima near the melting transition .",
    "quantitatively , however , the values of the two parts of the free energy and their dependence on @xmath0 are determined by the material parameters of the superconductor and the properties of the pinning centers .",
    "since several experimental studies@xcite of the effects of irradiation - induced columnar pinning on the mixed state of bscco exist in the literature , we have used parameter values appropriate for this system . for other layered superconductors ,",
    "the bog phase might occur over a wider or narrower ( even vanishing ) range .      as mentioned in section  [ props ] ,",
    "the density distribution in both brg and bog minima is very inhomogeneous : at temperatures close to @xmath101 there are liquid - like regions , characterized by low values of the local peak densities in parts of the sample . in this subsection , we show that this inhomogeneity leads to a spatial variation of a `` local melting temperature '' , defined below . as mentioned in the introduction , such spatial variations of a local melting temperature have been deduced from measurements of the local magnetization in bscco samples with random point@xcite and columnar pinning@xcite .    since we are dealing with time averaged densities",
    ", it is clear that the value of @xmath120 at a local peak of the density field provides a measure of the degree of localization of the vortex whose average position corresponds to the location of the density peak .",
    "a high ( low ) value of the local peak density implies strong ( weak ) localization .",
    "smaller values of the local peak density imply mobile , liquid - like behavior .",
    "the value of the local density is , of course , equal to @xmath43 everywhere in the liquid state in the absence of pinning .",
    "the presence of pinning centers causes the local density to vary in space , but in the liquid state this variation does not lead to local peaks higher than about @xmath121 ( excluding the vortices localized at the pinning centers ) .",
    "a similar result was also obtained in previous studies  @xcite of vortices in the presence of pinning , where it was found that values of the peak density lower than about @xmath121 correspond to the liquid state .",

    "our method , based on numerical minimization of the appropriate free - energy functional , allows us to obtain very detailed information about the density distribution in the different free energy minima ( which allows us to reliably identify the phases corresponding to these minima ) , and to map out the phase diagram of the system .",
    "there are several salient results of our study .",
    "the first one is the occurrence of a topologically ordered brg phase at low temperatures .",
    "while the occurrence of a low - temperature brg phase in superconductors with a low concentration of random point pinning centers is well - established now , relatively little is known about the existence of such a phase in superconductors with random columnar pins .",
    "our results are consistent with those of a recent numerical study  @xcite of a similar system .",
    "it is clear from our work that the brg minima represent a phase distinct from the polycrystalline bog phase also found in our study .",
    "we can not conclusively rule out the possibility that free dislocations would appear at the nearly crystalline minima at length scales much longer than those considered in our numerical study .",
    "if this should happen , then the `` hexatic glass '' phase suggested in some earlier theoretical studies  @xcite would become a possible candidate for describing the brg minima found in our study .",
    "this phase , however , would be distinct from the bog .",
    "our second important result is the occurrence of a two - step melting transition : we find that the low - temperature brg phase transforms into a polycrystalline bog phase as the temperature is increased , and this bog phase then melts into the high - temperature il at a slightly higher temperature .",
    "this conclusion about the occurrence of two distinct transitions would remain valid even if the true nature of the low - temperature phase turns out to be slightly different from a bragg glass : our work shows that the brg and bog minima are quite distinct from each other .",
    "the possibility of occurrence of a two - step melting transition of the vortex lattice in systems with random point pinning has been suggested earlier  @xcite .",
    "our work provides support to this suggestion .    to our knowledge",
    ", the second ( lower @xmath0 ) transition between the bog and brg phases has not been observed in experiments on layered superconductors with a small concentration of random columnar pins .",
    "this may be due to strong metastability : the bog minimum into which the il is expected to freeze as the temperature is decreased remains locally stable at temperatures lower than that at which its free energy crosses that of the brg minimum , suggesting that it would be difficult to see in experiments the transition to the globally stable brg phase .",
    "the situation here may be similar to that found in a recent experimental study@xcite of a low-@xmath125 superconductor with weak point pinning which is expected to exhibit a brg phase at low @xmath0 .",
    "it is , however , found in the experiment that the vortex solid obtained by cooling the sample in the presence of the external magnetic field has a polycrystalline structure , indicating that the metastability of this disordered state prevents the system from reaching the more ordered ( brg ) equilibrium state at low temperatures . in our numerical work , the brg minima were obtained by performing the free - energy minimization from an initial configuration with crystalline order .",
    "it is not clear how a similar procedure can be adopted in experimental studies .",
    "a low - temperature brg phase has been observed in a recent simulation@xcite of a model of htsc with a small concentration of columnar pinning centers .",
    "however , this simulation finds a single first - order transition between the brg and il phases at low pin concentrations : the small intermediate region of bog phase found in our study is not observed .",
    "this is probably due to the smallness of the system sizes ( @xmath126 100 vortex lines ) used in the simulation . as discussed in sec .",
    "[ phasediag ] above , the polycrystalline bog minima are found only if the sample size is larger than the typical size of the crystalline domains : only the brg minimum is found at low temperatures if this condition is not satisfied . since the crystalline domains become large at small pin concentrations , it is quite likely that a simulation with small system sizes and low pin concentration would not see the bog phase .",
    "another possibility is that a narrow `` two - phase '' region found in ref .   near",
    "the brg melting transition actually corresponds to the intermediate bog phase found in our study .",
    "a third possibility is that the intermediate bog phase , which arises due to a competition between the elastic and pinning components of the free energy ( see sec .",
    "[ phasediag ] where it is shown that the pinning energy favors the bog phase ) , does not appear in the simulation of ref .   because the pins are assumed to be  weak  in that work .",
    "our study also illustrates the spatial inhomogeneity of the melting process in the presence of disorder : we have found that a `` local '' melting temperature defined using a criterion based on the degree of localization of the vortices shows considerable spatial variation .",
    "this spatial variation is strongly correlated with the  pinning landscape  associated with the random spatial location of the pinning centers .",
    "our results about the spatial inhomogeneity of the local melting temperature are consistent with those of recent experiments @xcite on superconductors with pinning disorder .",
    "these results establish the usefulness of our numerical method in dealing with the problem of vortex matter in the presence of random pinning .",
    "it would be interesting to examine the extent to which our results depend on the values of the parameters appearing in the free energy functional .",
    "it would also be clearly useful to carry out similar studies of other related problems , such as the complete phase diagram of systems with random columnar pins in the @xmath127 plane , and the phase behavior of systems with random point pinning .",
    "some of these investigations are currently in progress .",

    "<S> we study the melting transition of the low - temperature vortex solid in strongly anisotropic layered superconductors with a concentration of random columnar pinning centers small enough so that the areal density of the pins is much less than that of the vortex lines . both the external magnetic field and the columnar pins </S>",
    "<S> are assumed to be oriented perpendicular to the layers our method , involving numerical minimization of a model free energy functional , yields not only the free energy values at the local minima of the functional but also the detailed density distribution of the system at each minimum : this allows us to study in detail the structure of the different phases . </S>",
    "<S> we find that at these pin concentrations and low temperatures , the thermodynamically stable state is a topologically ordered bragg glass . </S>",
    "<S> this nearly crystalline state melts into an interstitial liquid ( a liquid in which a small fraction of vortex lines remain localized at the pinning centers ) in two steps , so that the bragg glass and the liquid are separated by a narrow phase that we identify from analysis of its density structure as a polycrystalline bose glass . both the bragg glass to bose glass and the bose glass to interstitial liquid transitions are first - order . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that a local melting temperature defined using a criterion based on the degree of localization of the vortex lines exhibits spatial variations similar to those observed in recent experiments . </S>"
