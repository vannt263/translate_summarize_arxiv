    "the heterotic string introduced an interesting simply - laced semi - simple group @xmath0 in 10 dimension(10d ) which can be a candidate for the fundamental theory near the planck scale  @xcite .",
    "however , one must compactify the six internal spaces so as to reconcile with the observed 4 dimensional(4d ) physics . among a few directions for compactification",
    ", the orbifolding has been known to be especially simple and efficient , and gives a rich spectra for 4d particles@xcite .",
    "in addition , this orbifold method has led to interesting 4d models which exhibit some desirable physical phenomena such as the standard model gauge group and the doublet - triplet splitting@xcite .",
    "the so - called _ standard - like _ models , leading to the gauge group @xmath1 with three chiral families , have been constructed vigorously along this line@xcite . in case of no wilson line ,",
    "there even exist extensive tables for all @xmath2 orbifolds@xcite .",
    "however , the possibilities for inclusion of wilson lines are exponentially larger than those without wilson lines .",
    "therefore , the inclusion of wilson line(s ) was limited to the study toward the standard - like models . along this line",
    ", an equivalence relation was even devised to ease the study  @xcite .",
    "however , this initial study toward string derivation of the supersymmetric standard model could not overcome two serious hurdles along this direction , one the @xmath3 problem and the other the problem of too many higgs doublets .",
    "therefore , recently the orbifold has been tried at the field theory level@xcite . here , the doublet - triplet splitting problem@xcite and the flavor problem@xcite have been reconsidered , but it did not exhibit a predictive power due to the arbitrariness of the field content introduced at the fixed points",
    ".    this led us to consider the string orbifolds again .",
    "one recent suggestion has been that a semi - simple gauge group such as @xmath4 is plausible for a unification group at high energy to solve the @xmath3 problem in the orbifold compactification@xcite .",
    "this opens a new door toward string orbifolds . in this respect , it is worthwhile to consider possible string vacua through orbifold compactifications .",
    "of course , the previous classifications can be useful , but they are not complete in that there does not exist a complete classification with wilson lines .",
    "therefore , in this paper we try to investigate how to implement the wilson lines without much computer time .    in this study ,",
    "the simple group theoretical method , originally devised by kac and peterson  @xcite , is found to be extremely useful .",
    "this method uses the dynkin diagram , and can be understood pictorially . in this method , we can easily tell the origin and the symmetry of the resulting gauge group .",
    "however , cases with more than one shift vector , which is the case of our interest with wilson lines , have not been studied completely . here ,",
    "generalizing kac and peterson , we present a systematic search criteria for the gauge groups in cases with more than one shift vector .",
    "and we seek the behind symmetry of group , which is in fact apparent in the dynkin diagram . with the criteria present in this paper ,",
    "it is in principle possible to classify the groups completely .",
    "we begin with the conventional root space the dimension of which is the rank of the group . let us restrict the discussion to the _ self dual _ lattices . for a group @xmath5 and its root lattice spanned by its roots @xmath6 , we can make a transformation of @xmath6 by the shift vector @xmath7 , @xmath8 where we have casted roots as states and @xmath9 is the set of cartan generators .",
    "if we require that this transformation is the symmetry of the system , it breaks the group @xmath5 into its subgroup @xmath10 , which consists of the root vectors @xmath11 satisfying @xmath12 the _ order _ of the shift vector @xmath7 is defined to be the minimum integer number @xmath13 such that @xmath13 successive transformation becomes the identity operation up to a lattice translation , i.e. , @xmath14 belongs to the root lattice .",
    "the orbifold embedding of shift vector is a natural realization of this property .",
    "an _ orbifold _ is defined by moding out the manifold @xmath15 by the space group @xmath16 , which is seen equivalently as moding out the torus @xmath17 by the _ point group _ @xmath18 , @xmath19 under @xmath16 , an element @xmath20 of @xmath15 transforms as , @xmath21 here , the ( usually rotation ) element @xmath22 also belongs to the point group @xmath18 , or the automorphism of the lattice vector defining the torus .",
    "the order @xmath13 has the same meaning as that of the shift vector , i. e. , @xmath23 .",
    "naively speaking , the orbifolding is the identification of points on @xmath17 up to the transformation @xmath22 .",
    "we associate this space group transformation with the gauge group transformation , @xmath24 we refer the latter as the wilson line shift vector .",
    "a simple lie group has many symmetries .",
    "any set of shift vectors which are connected by these symmetries are equivalent , leading to the same subgroup .    1",
    ".   _ lattice translation _ : although this is not a symmetry of the gauge group , it is the redundancy of the formulation by the shift vector . under the translation @xmath25 by a root vector @xmath26 , the condition ( [ master ] )",
    "does not change , since the root vector is also an element of the dual lattice ( self dual ) , any vector of which has only integer value when taking the dot product with any root vector .",
    "weyl reflection _ : the weyl reflection(@xmath27 ) is defined as a reflection about the plane whose normal vector is the root(@xmath26 ) of the group .",
    "@xmath28 we know that the set of any number of successive reflections form a group .",
    "the group generated by the weyl reflections is called weyl group .",
    "3 .   _ outer automorphism _ : the dynkin diagram , which is a diagrammatical representation of the cartan matrix , contains almost every information of the given group .",
    "every small circle(or bullet ) represents a simple root and the linking lines rerepresents the angle between the simple roots linked.[in our case , we consider only small circles and singly connected lines . ]",
    "some dynkin diagram possesses some exchange symmetry , which is the outer automorphism of the group .",
    "some of the previous works classifying orbifold models neglected this possibility .",
    "in fact , many breaking patterns turn out to be the identical one .",
    "what will be the subgroup @xmath10 which survives the condition eq.([master ] ) ?",
    "the basic method of finding the group structure is to identify the simple roots for the set of all roots which survive the projection ( [ master ] ) . by choosing the form of the shift vector carefully , one can find the simple roots without identifying all roots surviving the projection . for the case of one shift vector ,",
    "i.e. when there is no wilson line shift , kac and peterson  @xcite introduced a very useful choice of such form of the shift vector .",
    "let us concentrate on the group @xmath29 .",
    "@xmath29 has eight simple roots @xmath30 , represented by the small circles in the ( extended ) dynkin diagram in fig.([e8dyn ] ) .",
    "the highest root @xmath22 of @xmath29 is given by @xmath31 let us define the _",
    "coexter label _",
    "@xmath32 as the coefficients of @xmath33 in this simple root expansion : @xmath34 where @xmath35 .",
    "if we define @xmath36 , its dot product with the other simple roots vanishes except with @xmath37 , for which it is @xmath38 .",
    "it can not be included in the set of simple roots of @xmath29 , since @xmath39 is not linearly independent on the other simple roots @xmath33 nor a positive root .",
    "however , it can be a candidate of new simple root when some simple root fails to pass the criterion eq.([master ] ) .",
    "this set is called an extended root system @xmath40 and the extended dynkin diagram is shown in fig.([e8dyn ] ) .",
    "let us expand the shift vector in the basis of the fundamental weight , namely _ dynkin basis _",
    "@xmath41 , satisfying @xmath42 , @xmath43 where @xmath13 is the order of the shift vector and @xmath44 is given by @xmath45 .",
    "we can limit our consideration for the shift vector satifying @xmath46 for it is well known that one can always transform the shift vector into this standard form by lattice translation and weyl reflection of @xmath29 . with this form of shift vector ,",
    "it is easy to identify the simple roots of the surviving roots .",
    "let us define the set of indices @xmath47 which is made of the indices @xmath48 for which @xmath44 does not vanish .",
    "first , let us consider the case where the inequality of eq.([lessn ] ) holds .",
    "for any positive root @xmath6 of @xmath29 @xmath50 the projection condition eq.([master ] ) becomes @xmath51 this value is always smaller than one since that for the highest root is less than one .",
    "@xmath52 thus , any root having non - zero @xmath53 for @xmath54 , fails to pass the condition .",
    "this means we can safely remove the corresponding circle in the dynkin diagram without causing any side effect .",
    "the resulting subgroup can be read off from the resulting diagram .",
    "now , let us consider the case when the equality in eq.([lessn ] ) holds .",
    "in this case , there are some roots , which still survives the projection condition even though @xmath55 for some @xmath56 , which means we can not just remove the corresponding circle in the dynkin diagram .",
    "let us call the set of such roots as @xmath57 .",
    "any positive root @xmath58 in @xmath57 has @xmath59 for all indices @xmath54 , hence it is expressed as @xmath60 for some non - negative integer @xmath61 .",
    "hence any negative root @xmath62 , being the minus of @xmath58 , in @xmath57 can be expressed by the sum of the root vectors @xmath63 , @xmath33 for @xmath64 with positive coefficients .",
    "thus , by changing the definition of positive root for the root in @xmath57 in such a way that a previous negative root is a positive root and vise versa , one can confirm that \\{@xmath39 , @xmath33 for @xmath65 } forms a proper set of simple roots .",
    "thus the surviving subgroup is represented by the extended dynkin diagram with @xmath48-th circle being removed for @xmath54 , i.e. @xmath66 .    observing that whether we add the extended simple root @xmath39 to the dynkin diagram or not depends on the value @xmath67 defined by @xmath68 vanishes or not , both cases considered in the last two paragraphs can be treated universally by formaly defining the coexter label @xmath69 for the extended simple root @xmath39 as 1 and restrict our consideration to the case which satisfies @xmath70 for a solution @xmath71 of eq.([kacond ] ) , the unbroken subgroup by the shift vector given by eq.([shift ] ) can be read off from the extended dynkin diagram with @xmath72-th circle removed for any index @xmath72 with @xmath73 including @xmath74 .",
    "if the rank of the diagram is smaller than 8 , there are additional @xmath75 s which fill up the rank to 8 .",
    "the trivial case is @xmath76 where the group @xmath5 remains unbroken",
    ".    it will be interesting to think about what will be the unbroken subgroup for the shift vector which does not satisfy the condition eq.([lessn ] ) .",
    "for example , take @xmath77 , hence @xmath78 where @xmath79 .",
    "it is tempting to speculate that deleting the 5th circle(@xmath80 ) in the extended dynkin diagram resulting in @xmath81 .",
    "however , the set @xmath82 can not generate a root vector with @xmath83 which survives the projection . in this case",
    ", the proper simple root turns out to be @xmath84 it links to @xmath85 and @xmath86 , whose resulting `` extended '' dynkin diagram is again @xmath87 , which is depicted in fig .",
    "[ odde6 ] . by the theorem above",
    ", there is an equivalent shift vector obeying the condition ( [ lessn ] ) leading to the same subgroup .",
    "one can show that this is an equivalent breaking to the second one in table [ z3tbl ] , by lattice translations and weyl reflections .",
    "the complication of this example comes from the fact that there are surviving roots which can not be expressed in terms of the highest root and the surviving simple roots .",
    "those roots are allowed since @xmath88 is greater than 1 .",
    "hence this example shows the importance of the condition eq.([lessn ] ) in reading off the gauge group directly from the dynkin diagram .",
    "the power of the condition eq.([kacond ] ) lies not only in the easyness to identify the unbroken subgroup but also in the fact that there are only a few possible set of @xmath89 s that can satisfy it .",
    "thus the procedure of finding all possible gauge symmetry breaking by the shifts can be very simplified using the condition eq.([kacond ] ) and the extended dynkin diagram .",
    "for example , let us consider an order @xmath79 shift . from eq .",
    "( [ kacond ] ) and watching @xmath90 , there are only five possibilities .",
    "the shift vector  ( [ shift ] ) in the dynkin basis and the corresponding five unbroken groups are listed in table [ z3tbl ] .    .",
    "[ z3tbl ] the order @xmath79 breakings of @xmath29 .",
    "the last entry @xmath67 can be added automatically to satisfy eq .",
    "( [ kacond ] ) . [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "so far the procedure presented for finding an unbroken subgroup of @xmath29 by the dynkin diagram has been general . in string theory , however , the consistency under the quantum corrections demands further conditions which is called the modular invariance conditions . in this case , the unbroken group by the shift vectors is more restricted .",
    "the search for the groups via shift vectors was the original motivation for introducing the orbifold compactification  @xcite in physics .",
    "in fact , these root systems naturally arise from the heterotic string  @xcite . here",
    ", we employ the bosonic string description .",
    "a string state excited by an oscillator describes a cartan generator in eq .",
    "( [ cartan ] ) . the momentum and winding states around the compact dimension , which describe `` charged bosons '' under this cartan generator describe roots in eq .",
    "( [ charged ] ) .",
    "the modular invariance condition restricts the relations among these states .    by orbifolding we",
    "identify the space ( in the compact dimension coordinate @xmath91 ) @xmath92 similarly shift vector is defined on the group space @xmath93 by the definition of order , @xmath13 successive twist is identity operation , hence @xmath94 where the modulo 2 condition results for the case of spinorial states , e.g. in the @xmath0 theory .    here",
    ", the modular invariance condition  @xcite for the orbifold restricts the form of the shift vector . constraining the discussion on the abelian orbifold , i.e. when",
    "the orbifold action is commutative  @xcite then the only necessity from the modular invariance condition  @xcite is that under @xmath95 . in terms of the shift vectors @xmath96 and @xmath7 , we have @xmath97 where @xmath98 where the dot product between two vectors in the dynkin basis is understood . in this basis",
    ", we can easily read off the modular invariance condition from the inverse cartan matrix @xmath99 .",
    "this is especially useful in implementing the procedure into the computer code . for a concrete form of the cartan matrix ,",
    "see  @xcite .",
    "the presence of wilson lines changes the modular invariance condition  @xcite .",
    "in addition to eq .",
    "( [ modinv ] ) , we have the condition for each wilson line shift @xmath100 , @xmath101 here , by the point group action as well as the lattice translation by @xmath102 , the wilson - line - shifted vector is made coincident to another shift vector .",
    "since we have no preference on the choice of reference lattice axis , we can always set @xmath102 to be 1 .",
    "therefore , one can show that this can be simply restated as , @xmath103 this can be written in the dynkin basis as , @xmath104 and @xmath105    in the presence of more than one wilson line , these conditions constrain the theory severely and reduce drastically the number of possibilities .    in the @xmath106 heterotic string",
    ", we can independently consider two sectors independently .",
    "when we focus on the `` visible '' sector only , the modular invariance condition is loosened , because we can put the unwanted shift vector components into the hidden sector . for the modular invariance",
    ", the full rank16 group must be considered for the condition ( [ modinv ] ) .",
    "however , physics of the hidden sector is still important .",
    "when we consider twisted sectors , generally multiplets are hung on both sectors .",
    "it is easily checked that these modular invariance conditions are not spoiled by the automorphisms of the group . as seen in table [ e6furth ] ,",
    "therefore the same groups that come from the equivalent breaking survive together if one survives .",
    "from the above construction , we can classify which group emerges when we orbifold .",
    "the general strategy for obtaining an orbifolded unbroken group is the following :    1 .",
    "determine the number of compact dimensions and the orbifold which determines the order @xmath13 of the shift .",
    "2 .   find all possible shift vector @xmath107 having the coefficient @xmath44 which satisfies eq.([kacond ] ) for given order @xmath13 , for single gauge group @xmath29 .",
    "the allowed shift vector @xmath7 for @xmath108 can be selected from the combination of two shift vectors for single @xmath29 by requiring the modular invariance condition ( [ modinv ] ) .",
    "4 .   the surviving gauge group for the chosen shift vector can be read off from the extended dynkin diagram using the method explained in this paper .",
    "whenever we add wilson line @xmath100 , repeat the process from step 2 , using eq.([kacond_sub ] ) this time .",
    "* simple and intuitive .",
    "* complete classificiation : we can take into account all the symmetries from a given group . * easy to find the origin of a symmetry : we can see pictorially which symmetry comes from which group . from the example we presented earlier ,",
    "the origin of @xmath4 from @xmath109 is easily seen .",
    "since the above procedure is easily implementable in the computer program , we will present the classification tables of unbroken groups with shift vectors and wilson lines , including the matter spectrum , in a separate publication@xcite .    in this paper , we set out the rules for finding out all the unbroken gauge groups with all the possible shift vectors and wilson lines .",
    "the main point of the procedure we proposed is that we can exhaust the weyl reflection symmetry by requiring the shift vectors and the wilson lines to be the standard form for each subgroup , which is still simple enough to read off the surviving gauge group from the extended dynkin diagram at the same time .",
    "since we obtain all the allowed gauge groups with shift vectors and wilson lines , the search for models with different sets of chiral matters within a given gauge group is much more simplified and tractable .",
    "it is even straight forward to identify the untwisted and twisted matter representations for every possible orbifold models , since we have done the classification of the weyl - non - equivalent shift vectors and wilson lines , if needed by the aid of the computer program@xcite .",
