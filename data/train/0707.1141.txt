    "in a two - dimensional bilayer system of charged particles where the separation of the layers are large enough to prevent tunnelling , an external current applied in one ( active ) layer can drag the charges in the adjacent ( passive ) via the inter - layer coulomb interaction , and thus , induce a current .",
    "this phenomenon , known as the coulomb drag ( cd ) effect , which was proposed theoretically  @xcite , and investigated experimentally  @xcite .",
    "the coulomb drag is of fundamental interest , since it can be utilized as a probing tool to investigate the screened interaction in mesoscopic transport systems .",
    "a quantitative measure of the coulomb drag is the transresistivity @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the applied current in the active layer and @xmath2 is the induced electric field in the passive layer .",
    "the presence of perpendicularly applied magnetic field enriches the physics of the cd effect by introducing landau levels .",
    "the electrostatic and transport properties of the bilayer system were investigated first within the independent electron picture  @xcite and recently within a self - consistent screening scheme  @xcite .",
    "the main outcomes of the self - consistent scheme are ( i ) the formation of incompressible strips in the active layer at integer landau filling factor values , which affects the density and potential profile in the passive layer , and ( ii ) the tilting of the total potential within the active layer in the out - of - linear response ( olr ) regime , induced by a large external current  @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we combine these effects to formulate the interaction between the active and passive layers within the olr regime , in order to provide a self - consistent description of the cd effect .",
    "we investigate the effect of the current intensity , temperature and density mismatch between the layers on the inter - layer coulomb interaction in the olr regime .",
    "the electron bilayer system in the present work consists of two @xmath3 quantum wells ( having a width of @xmath4 @xmath5 m ) that are sandwiched between two silicon doped thick @xmath6 layers .",
    "this structure is grown on top of a @xmath3 substrate .",
    "the layers are translationally invariant .",
    "the electron density of the top layer is manipulated by a top gate .",
    "the electron layers are symmetric ( with respect to the growth direction ) and ( @xmath7 ) @xmath8 nm apart separated by an undoped @xmath6 layer .",
    "such a bilayer system is known to be electronically decoupled and can be represented by two different electrochemical potentials .",
    "we note that the electron tunnelling between the layers is not possible .",
    "both of the electron channels are formed in the interval @xmath9 , where @xmath10 sets the depletion length .",
    "the total electrostatic potential of an electron on the line @xmath11 due to a line - charge at @xmath12 is given by  @xcite v(x , z)= v_bg(x , z ) + v_h(x , z ) , [ eq : vvon_x]and v_h(x , z)= _ x_l^x_r dx_0 k(x , x_0,z , z_0 ) n_el(x_0,z_0 ) , [ eq : v_hartree ] where @xmath13 is the charge of an electron , @xmath14 an average background dielectric constant , and the kernel @xmath15 solves poisson s equation under the relevant boundary conditions given by [ perp - bilayer ] k(x , x_0,z , z_0)=- ( ) where the @xmath16 dependence is given by @xmath17 .",
    "the confining ( background ) potential is obtained by inserting a constant number density ( @xmath18 ) of the background charges into eq .",
    "( [ eq : v_hartree ] )",
    ". the gate can be described by an induced charge distribution @xmath19 , that is residing on the surface . in order to obtain a flat ( gate ) potential profile in the bulk we choose the induced charge distribution as @xmath20 where @xmath21 determines the strength of the gate potential whereas @xmath22 gives the slope of the induced charge distribution . with such treatment of the gate ,",
    "the average electron densities can be modified while keeping the depletion length constant .",
    "the hartree potential can be calculated from eq.([eq : v_hartree ] ) for the top ( bottom ) layer yielding a total potential v(x , z)= -v^t_bg(x , z)-v^b_bg(x , z)-v_g(x , z)+v_h^t(x , z)+v_h^b(x , z ) .[int1d]the electron densities are calculated within the tfa : [ eq : tfa]n^t , b_el(x)=ded(e)f([e+v(x , z_t , b)-^*_t , b ] ) , with @xmath23 is the landau density of states ( dos ) , @xmath24 $ ] is the fermi function , @xmath25 is the chemical potential ( being constant in the equilibrium state ) and @xmath26 is the position of top ( bottom ) layer , respectively .",
    "we employ the gaussian broadened landau dos  @xcite .",
    "the self - consistent numerical calculations start with obtaining the confining potential created by its own donors for each layer and the electron densities and the intralayer and interlayer hartree potentials  @xcite at zero temperature and zero magnetic field .",
    "the energies are scaled by the average pinch - off energy @xmath27 .",
    "the lengths are scaled by the screening length @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) expressed in terms of effective bohr radius , @xmath30 . the electron density and the electrostatic potential for finite",
    "temperature and magnetic field can be calculated self - consistently by the above scheme within the tfa .",
    "the crucial and distinguishing feature of the approach we implement is that we neither rely on a one - electron description nor use any phenomenological parameters to account for electron interactions , both for inter- and intra - layer . in the next step ,",
    "we drive a relatively high current from the active ( here , top ) layer and calculate the effect of this on the passive layer .",
    "we use a local version of the ohm s law to describe current densities employing a gaussian broadened dos defining the conductivity model  @xcite .",
    "we assume a local thermal equilibrium , where local quantities vary slowly on the quantum mechanical length scales . in the presence of current , it is well known that the landau levels are tilted due to the hall potential developed  @xcite , therefore the electrochemical potential @xmath25 , becomes position dependent and thus must be included within the self - consistent scheme .",
    "this brings two other self - consistent loops : ( i ) the re - calculation of the @xmath31 in each layer ; ( ii ) the response of the other layer to this modification . in this work",
    ", we also include this tilting to investigate its effect on the potential ( see fig  [ fig : fig1 ] ) and the density profile of the passive layer .",
    "the calculated potential profiles as a function of lateral coordinate , for zero and finite current applied to the top layer .",
    "the gate potential is chosen such that the resulting density mismatch is at the order of few percents , namely @xmath32 .",
    "calculations are done at @xmath33 for @xmath34 @xmath35 and interlayer spacing of @xmath36 nm . the @xmath37 field is selected such that @xmath38 assuming a fixed depletion length @xmath39    here ,",
    "we aim to show the effect of the combination of the inter- and the intra - layer coulomb interactions together with the effect of external current driven in at least one of the layers . if one drives a current perpendicular to the applied magnetic field a hall potential develops in the transverse direction to the current , i.e. hall potential , resulting from the lorentz force .",
    "if the system is all compressible , the hall potential is linear in @xmath40 , as one would expect to observe in a normal metal . here",
    "we observe a similar behavior for the top layer , depicted in fig.[fig : fig1 ] . on the other hand",
    "the response of the second layer is as expected in the first glance , since , if the top layer has a tilted electrochemical potential in one direction the other should be the opposite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] , we show the self - consistently calculated potential profiles of both layers . for zero bias",
    "the top layer ( broken black line ) and the bottom layer ( dotted cyan line ) are symmetric in @xmath40 .",
    "however , for a large current intensity ( @xmath41 , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) at the top layer to induce an electrochemical potential of this layer ( red short dashed - dotted lines ) a tilt is induced at the bottom layer with an opposite slope ( dark blue dotted lines ) . more interestingly , if a finite current is driven from the bottom layer with same current direction of the top layer , the tilting observed is slightly suppressed ( brown dashed - dotted line ) .    in summary , by exploiting the smooth variation of the external potential we have explicitly calculated the coulomb interaction in and between the bilayer quantum hall samples in the presence of a strong current driven in one layer .",
    "our preliminary results indicate that , a strong coulomb coupling induces modifications in the potential landscape of both layers , which clearly points that a self - consistent microscopic model is necessary to grasp the underlying physics of the coulomb drag effect observed in the bilayer systems .",
