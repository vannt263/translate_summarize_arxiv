    "catalogs of galaxy clusters throughout a large range of redshifts and cluster x  ray luminosities are an ideal basis for the test of cosmological parameters ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the bright and southern serendipitous high redshift rosat cluster ( sharc ) surveys provide a sample of clusters over two decades of x  ray luminosity ( 10@xmath0l@xmath110@xmath2erg / s ) with redshifts between 0.2 and 0.8 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we present here simple analysis results concerning the follow - up of these selected clusters with the xmm  newton satellite ( see @xcite for a summary of the project ) .",
    "our analysis is based on the three epic cameras , mos1&2 and pn , aboard xmm  newton . throughout the paper ,",
    "we use a cosmology with h@xmath3km / s / mpc , @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the error bars are given with a confidence level of 90% .",
    "the cluster rx  j1120.1 + 4318 was observed for 20ks and rx  j0256.5 + 0006 for 25ks with xmm  newton .",
    "we discard the data corresponding to high background periods caused by flares . to monitor this kind of background ,",
    "we extract light curve in the 1012kev energy band for mos data and in the 1214kev for the pn . in these energy bands , the effective area of xmm  newton is negligible and the emission is mainly due to particle induced background .",
    "we remove time bins in which there are more than 15cts/100s for mos data and",
    "22cts/100s for the pn data .",
    "the remaining exposure times after the flare rejection are listed in table [ smajerowicz - b3_tab : texpo ] .",

    "newton with off - axis angle and with energy  we use the method which is described in detail by @xcite .",
    "this method consists in calculating the ratio of on - axis effective area to effective area at the event position on the detector .",
    "the background subtraction is necessary for extended sources like clusters of galaxies . after removing flares",
    ", the background components are the high energy particle induced background , non - vignetted by the telescopes , and the cosmic x  ray background ( hereafter cxb ) which is vignetted and depends on sky position of the observation .    to remove these two components , we use a blank sky event file which was produced for each epic camera .",
    "we first subtract the blank field from the source .",
    "this step allows to subtract the high energy particle induced background .",
    "the second step consists in the correction for the cxb .",
    "this is done by using data in the region outside the cluster emission .",
    "we do the first step for this region and the expected residuals are the difference of emission between the local cxb and the cxb in the blank field .",
    "we finally subtract these residuals to the product of the first step .",
    "this technique to remove all background components is described with more details in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "rx  j1120.1 + 4318 is a distant galaxy cluster at a redshift of 0.6 . at",
    "this redshift one arc - minute corresponds in our cosmology to 470kpc . in the figure [ smajerowicz - b3_fig : rxj11img ] where all epic cameras were combined , we see that this cluster is most likely in a dynamical relaxed state since its shape of the x  ray emission is fairly regular and spherical .",
    "the surface brightness profile of this cluster ( see @xcite for more explanations about the code ) in the energy band between 0.3 and 3kev is shown in figure [ smajerowicz - b3_fig : rxj11sbp ] .",
    "this profile is background subtracted and we exclude all point sources in the field of view . we also regroup the data so that we have a signal - to - noise ratio of at least 3@xmath6 in each bin .",
    "the cluster is firmly detected up to 3 which corresponds to roughly 1.5mpc .",
    "we fit this profile with a @xmath7-model where the surface brightness @xmath8 is defined by  : @xmath9 @xmath10 is the so - called core radius .",
    "we obtain @xmath11 and @xmath12arc - minute or @xmath13kpc .      xmm ",
    "newton observations allow for the first time to determine the temperature profile of a cluster at redshift z=0.6 . to derive it ,",
    "we extract spectra in three concentric annuli and we fit these extracted spectra with an absorbed single temperature plasma model fixing the hydrogen column density to its galactic value .",
    "the measured mean temperature is 5.3@xmath140.5kev with a mean abundance of 0.48@xmath140.19 .",
    "the temperature profile is flat up to 950kpc from the cluster center and does not seem to show a decrease in the center . furthermore , no excess is observed in the surface brightness profile ( see figure [ smajerowicz - b3_fig : rxj11sbp ] ) .",
    "we can thus conclude that this cluster can not host a strong cooling flow in its center .",
    "rx  j0256.5 + 0006 is a medium distant cluster at a redshift of 0.36 .",
    "figure [ smajerowicz - b3_fig : rxj02img ] shows cluster image .",
    "this cluster appears bimodal .",
    "it is of interest to know whether this cluster is in fact in a merger state or whether the bimodal structure is due to chance alignment of two physically unrelated clusters .",
    "numerical simulations show ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) that cluster mergers create major shock fronts which heat the intracluster medium between the colliding components . to see possible spatial temperature variations in the cluster , we create a hardness ratio map ( see figure [ smajerowicz - b3_fig : rxj02hr ] ) .",
    "we do not see strong hardness ratio variations between the two components .",
    "however this might be due to lack of statistics .",
    "but it might also be linked to the possible merger geometry . in case of merging close to the line of sight ,",
    "the resulting shock waves are widely distributed in the plane - of - sight and not visible for us as concentration between the two components .        to know how far are the two components , we let the redshift as a free parameter for the spectrum fits and we find z@xmath17 and z@xmath18 .",
    "the two components can thus be at the same redshift and physically related , or unconnected to each other . in that case it seems that the smallest component is behind the biggest one .    with figure [ smajerowicz - b3_fig : rxj02sbp ]",
    ", we extract surface brightness profiles for the biggest component in the region where it is not affected by the emission of the second cluster . from the contours",
    ", we can already see the compression of the isophots in region 2 .",
    "it is clear that the gas distribution is not azimuthally symmetric .",
    "this indicates that this component is not in a relaxed state but in a merger state .    in conclusion",
    ", we can not yet definitely conclude on the exact dynamical state of rx  j0256.5 + 0006 , although there are several indications that it is not relaxed .",
    "this work is still in progress . in particular , some optical observations will be added and could help us by building galaxy spatial distribution and determining galaxy spectroscopic redshifts ."
