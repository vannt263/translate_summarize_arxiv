    "their abundance is approximately similar in agn of type 1 and 2 @xcite and they represent one of the major gaseous components of active nuclei .",
    "the precise nature and origin of cls are still a matter of debate .",
    "different scenarios have been considered in the literature , including winds from the molecular torus ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , ( x - ray ) ionized absorbers ( nlr ; e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , and a low - density component of the interstellar medium ( ism ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , up to now none of the above hypotheses has been fully discarded because of the lack of high - spatial resolution observations on a sizeable number of targets .",
    "the mechanisms powering the cls have also been a subject of strong debate , with two competing processes usually invoked : photoionization from the central engine and shocks between the jets and the nlr gas . @xcite and",
    "@xcite proposed that the emission in the nlr may be entirely caused by shocks .",
    "velocity splitting of over 1000 , reported by @xcite , in the vicinity of some of the bright emission - line knots in the nlr of 1068 provides evidence of the existence of fast shocks in agns . however , hubble space telescope ( hst ) data @xcite have shown emission - line ratios consistent with photoionization instead of shock heating mechanisms .",
    "moreover , models accounting for both photoionization from the central radiation source and shocks were required to explain both the continuum and nlr spectrum , including the cls , observed in the spectra of a sample active galaxies @xcite .",
    "furthermore , sometimes the same data sets have been explained by different scenarios . in particular , both mechanisms , shocks and photoionization ,",
    "may plausibly be at work in the same galaxy .",
    "therefore , high - resolution studies of nearby galaxies are essential in order to disentangle the effects and contributions of shocks and photoionization .",

    "@xcite , for instance , presented an analysis of the optical cls of a sample of 10 seyfert galaxies , including 1068 .",
    "these authors used the excellent spatial resolution provided by stis / hst to resolve the cl region ( clr ) and study the properties of the cls as a function of the distance to the nucleus .",
    "the optical cls were found to be very complex , showing strong variations in their intensities and profiles along the spatial direction , which in most cases was nearly aligned to the position of the radio jet .",
    "these lines are emitted from very compact regions ( @xmath5  pc ) up to regions of @xmath6  pc .",
    "the morphology and the kinematics of the lower - ionization cls ( i.e. ,  and ) are very similar to that of lower ionization lines such .",
    "on the other hand , cls with ip @xmath7  ev ( i.e.  and ) are emitted in much more compact regions and do not seem to share the same overall kinematics found for the lower ionization lines .",
    "several pieces of evidence ( e.g. lack of correlation between the radio and cl emission , and relatively good success of photoionization models in reproducing measured line ratios ) point towards photoionization from a central source as the main mechanism of formation of cls .    however , the stis results are restricted by the relatively small region covered by the slit width and along a particular direction that can be analysed with long - slit spectroscopy . in spite of the typical 0.1  arcsec spatial resolution , the limited area covered by",
    "the slit did not allow rejection of jet - nlr gas interaction in the production of the cls @xcite .",
    "a further step on this subject is expected to be achieved by means of ao integral field spectroscopy , which can give us a more detailed view of the innermost parsecs of nearby agns at similar angular resolutions as hst .",
    "1068 is a natural candidate for a follow up with ao integral field spectroscopy .",
    "this object is one of the nearest and probably the most intensely studied seyfert 2 galaxy in the literature .",
    "observations in all wavelength bands from radio to hard x - rays have formed a uniquely detailed picture of that source .",
    "it hosts a prominent nlr that is approximately co - spatial with a linear radio source with two lobes @xcite , extensively characterized from subarcsecond clouds probed by the hst @xcite to the ionization cone and extended emission - line region @xcite extending to radii of at least 30  arcsec ( @xmath8  pc for @xmath9 and @xmath10  mpc@xmath11 ) .",
    "the optical and nir cls of 1068 were first studied by @xcite .",
    "they found that the flux distribution peaks 50  pc ne of the nucleus and appears to arise predominantly in outflowing gas within the prominent ionization cone aligned with the radio jet .",
    "the line ratios argue against collisional ionization but could be explained with photoionization by radiation from the active nucleus .",
    "@xcite presented a  2.48  narrow band image obtained with the ir camera naco at the eso / vlt ( spatial resolution @xmath12  pc or 0.097  arcsec ) .",
    "the images show a diffuse coronal region with filamentary structure .",
    "the extent of the cl emission is larger than that predicted by photoionization models , which argues for additional in situ gas excitation , the most plausible energy source being shock excitation .",
    "@xcite reported a double - peak structure in the [ fevii ]  @xmath136087 line , with the relative separation between the two peaks increasing with the distance from the centre , signalling the presence of a highly energetic outflow , not detected in lower ionization lines . very recently , ( * ? ? ? * hereafter ms11 ) analysed the morphology and kinematics of  1.96  ( ip=166  ev ) cl of 1068 by means of @xmath1-band ao integral field spectroscopy sinfoni data .",
    "these authors confirmed the great complexity displayed by the  emission - line region of this galaxy and favoured a scenario where the radio jet has no strong influence in the formation and kinematics of the clr , probably only affecting the kinematics of some emission - line knots located at distances of less than 1  arcsec from the nucleus , towards the ne .    because of the above points",
    ", additional information is needed to remove these ambiguities and identify the dominant mechanism powering the cls . moreover ,",

    "spectra of 1068 were obtained with nifs @xcite on the gemini north telescope in december 2006 under programme gn-2006b - c-9 . the observations and data reduction",
    "have been described in detail by @xcite .",
    "nifs was used with the altair facility adaptive - optics system in its natural guide star mode .",
    "the compact seyfert nucleus of 1068 was used as the adaptive - optics reference object .",
    "the @xmath0 ,  and  observations discussed in this paper were obtained on 2006 december 15 , 12 and 13 ( ut ) , respectively .",

    "nifs is an image - slicer integral - field spectrograph with a square field of view of @xmath17 , which is divided into 29 slitlets each @xmath18  arcsec wide with a sampling of @xmath19  arcsec along each slitlet .",
    "the instrument was set to a position angle on the sky of 300  to align the slitlets approximately perpendicular to the axis of the radio jet and ionization cone observed in the nucleus of 1068 .",
    "this provided coarser spatial sampling along the jet axis , and finer spatial sampling across the jet .",
    "each data set consisted of sets of multiple 90  s exposures that began with an offset sky position and were followed by nine galaxy exposures obtained in a @xmath20-frame grid centred on the galaxy nucleus .",
    "a frame offset of @xmath21  arcsec was applied along and perpendicular to the nifs slitlets , so that the full field of view is @xmath22 on the sky , with maximum exposure in the central @xmath23 .",
    "this exposure grid was repeated nine times for each grating setting .",
    "the nucleus of 1068 was within each frame , so it was used to spatially register the exposures .",
    "an arc lamp exposure and a measurement of a telluric standard star were obtained after each data set .",
    "the data reduction was performed using the gemini iraf nifs package and followed standard procedures as described by @xcite .",
    "the data were flux calibrated using the observations of the telluric standard star , hip 5886 , which was assumed to have the intrinsic spectrum with a level set by its 2mass magnitude in the wavelength band of the spectrum and a shape defined by a 8600  k blackbody , which has the same 2mass @xmath24 colour as hip 5886 . the data reduction resulted in single data cubes at each grating setting with all instrumental signatures removed .",
    "the nir spectrum of 1068 displays numerous emission lines , the brightest of which are ,  1.26 , several 2  lines , and the high - ionization cls  1.25  ( ip=328  ev ) ,  2.48  ( ip=205  ev ) and  1.96  ( ip=166  ev ) . additionally , 1068 exhibits weak cl emission from  at 2.04  ( ip=285  ev ) and  at 2.32  ( ip=128  ev ) . fig .",

    "it can be seen that the cls virtually dominate the nir spectrum .",
    "the strongest cls observed , ,  and , are blended with the  1.26 , 2  1.96  and 2  2.48  emission lines , respectively .",
    "therefore , in order to study the cl emission it was first necessary to subtract the contribution from the  and 2  lines . for this purpose , we first used the continuum task of iraf to subtract the continuum emission from the spectra of the data cubes . the simplest case to handle was the @xmath29  blend , since these two lines are not very strongly mixed .",
    "for each spectrum , we represented the profile of each of these lines with a gaussian function , and subtracted the  emission from the data .",
    "this procedure was satisfactory for most of the spectra , although in some regions it was necessary to include an extra gaussian component to account for the strong asymmetries or double peaks displayed by the  line .",
    "these regions are located towards the sw of the nucleus , where the  line splits into two components , generally one redshifted and one blueshifted ( up to @xmath30  ) .",
    "note that , even though the  show large blueshifts , the separation in wavelength with the  line is still large enough to allow a clear deblending of the lines .",
    "detailed analysis of the kinematics of the  emitting gas , based on this same data set , can be found in riffel et al .",
    "( in preparation ) .",
    "deblending the @xmath292  lines was more challenging than the previous case because of the strong broad and complex profile displayed by  in many regions , making the discrimination of each line difficult ( see fig .",
    "[ f_jkspectra ] ) . for this task",
    ", we used as reference for 2  1.96  the 2  2.12  line .",
    "the latter was chosen because it is located relatively close in wavelength to the former and in a region free of any other features .",
    "we modelled the 2  2.12  line as the sum of two gaussian components ( to account for the asymmetries or double peaks displayed by this line in some regions ) , and assigned the same widths , velocity shifts and relative peak intensities of these two components to the ones used to describe the emission of 2  1.96 .",
    "additional constraints were necessary in some critical regions where the width and the intensity of the  line did not allow a clear discrimination between the coronal and molecular lines . in these regions",
    ", we applied an additional restriction , fixing the value of the 2  1.96/2.12  line ratio to 1.08 .",
    "this corresponds to the mean value derived from the measurements in the regions where the 2@xmath29  blend was not too strong .",
    "although this line ratio is not independent of the physical properties of the emission - line gas , the measured values showed no significant variations between the spectra .",
    "once modelled satisfactorily , the 2  1.96  emission was subtracted from the spectra .    as for the  line above",
    ", the observed  line is located in a spectral region containing 2  emission lines .",
    "nevertheless , because of the low intensity and particular distribution of the 2  emission ( see section  [ s_morphology ] ) , its contribution to the  emission is practically negligible .",
    "only when the  is analysed in velocity bins ( section  [ s_kinematics ] ) , a clear contamination is present in the region where the 2  emission reaches its maximum ( @xmath31  arcsec east of the nucleus ) .",
    "since the 2  emission does not contribute significantly to the  emission and , when it does , it can be easily pinpointed , we did not subtracted the 2  emission lines from the  nifs spectra .                  after applying the cleaning process described above , we constructed bi - dimensional maps of the flux distribution of the cls observed in the @xmath0 , , and  data cubes of 1068 .",
    "we also constructed flux distribution maps of other lines of interest , namely , , 2  2.12 , and  1.26 , for comparison purposes .",
    "the maps were constructed by integrating the flux under the emission - line profiles observed in the continuum - subtracted spectra .",
    "we used wavelength bins wide enough to include the emission from the highest velocity line - emitting gas .",
    "[ f_mapascls ] and [ f_mapaslil ] show the flux distribution maps of the cls and the selected low - ionization and molecular lines of the inner @xmath32 of 1068 .",
    "the maps are centred at the position of the continuum peak of the corresponding @xmath0- and @xmath1-band , which coincides with the location of the central black hole @xcite . in these maps , we only report values with a signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) higher than 2 .",
    "visual inspection of fig .",
    "[ f_mapascls ] shows that the region emitting the cls of 1068 is highly inhomogeneous and elongated along the ne - sw direction .",
    "the inhomogeneous distribution can also be seen in the flux distribution maps of the low - ionization lines ( i.e. ,  and , fig .",
    "[ f_mapaslil ] ) .",
    "the  map presented here is in agreement with the one reported by ms11 .",
    "however , some differences are observed due to the fact that these authors did not subtract the 2  1.96  emission , which can severely contaminate the  map at some particular locations .",
    "although the integrated flux distribution is not strongly affected by this , the analysis of the velocity channels is more compromised , especially in the high - velocity blueshifted bins ( see section  [ s_kinematics ] for details ) .",
    "the extension of the ,  and  cls towards the ne from the nucleus is very similar , extending to a distance of 2.3  arcsec ( @xmath33  pc ) .",
    "note , however , that the nifs data do not cover regions beyond this .",
    "therefore , we can not exclude the possibility of emission at larger distances from the nucleus .  and",

    "note that , when comparing the spatial extension of different lines one must keep in mind the snr at which these lines are detected , as the different sizes could be a simple artefact of the lower snr of the weaker lines .    at this point , it is useful to compare the cl emission found here with the continuum and line distributions at other spectral regions .",
    "1068 harbours a nuclear jet observed in radio , which could be playing an important role in the ionization structure and kinematics of the nlr and , in particular , of the cls of this galaxy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "it is easy to see from figs .",
    "[ f_mapascls ] and [ f_mapascontornos ] that the regions where the cls are more intense are the ones located towards the n - ne from the nucleus , forming an arc that starts in the nucleus and extends about 0.8  arcsec towards the ne .",

    "the lack of detection of this latter line in the optical is probably due to the strong extinction affecting 1068 in the sw ( * ? ? ?",

    "an inspection of the  map in fig .",
    "[ f_mapascls ] shows that the spatial distribution of this line is smoother and more symmetric than the other cls .",

    "this general pattern is not followed by the  and  emitting gas located at @xmath35  arcsec towards the sw from the nucleus , where the gas velocity is very close to that of the systemic velocity of the galaxy . moreover",
    ", this system seems to be disconnected from the parcel of gas located next to it , towards the nucleus , because the latter displays much higher velocities .",
    "overall , the  channel maps are consistent with the ones presented by ms11 ( see their fig .",
    "12 ) , with the exception of the higher blueshifted velocity channels , which are contaminated by 2  emission ( see especially the two extremely strong blobs of emission in the @xmath54  velocity bin ) .",
    "the kinematics of the  and  emitting gas derived in this work is compatible with that derived by @xcite for the optical cls along pa=22 .",
    "although it is not possible to make a point - to - point comparison between the two data sets ( due to astrometric imprecisions ) , we conclude that both optical and nir cls follow a similar behaviour : the nuclear lines show broad profiles with velocities close to the systemic velocity ; further out , towards the sw , the strongest emission is produced by gas with receding velocities . towards the ne ,",
    "the line profiles are split into at least two components , with both receding and approaching velocities .    fig .",
    "[ f_s9chmaps ] shows the channel map corresponding to the  emission .",
    "it can be seen that this cl follows a similar trend as those of  and .",
    "note , however , that in the former the emission appears more blurred than in the latter two due to a loss of spatial resolution in the @xmath0-band ( see section  [ s_results ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the  emission displays a smaller range of velocities than the silicon lines .",
    "the high - velocity gas ( both approaching and receding components ) in the silicon lines is mostly found in regions far from the nucleus ( both towards the ne and sw ) , where weak or no  emission is observed .",
    "overall , the integrated flux map of the cls presents a clear asymmetry along the sw - ne direction ( pa  @xmath5 ) , that is , aligned with the radio emission observed with vla ( see panel a of fig .",
    "[ f_mapascontornos ] ) . however , when we look at the channel velocity maps , it is possible to discriminate two different behaviours : the high - velocity gas is extended along the sw - ne direction while the low - velocity gas ( @xmath55300100  ) displays an asymmetry along the s - n direction .",
    "the latter corresponds to the original direction of the jet ( formed by the radio knots s1 and s2 ) before being deflected to its final direction ( pa@xmath5 ) . assuming that the jet is initially aligned to the collimation axis of the ionizing radiation ( i.e. the s - n direction ) before bending to the ne",
    ", we expect that photoionization by the central source will be more relevant in that direction .",
    "in contrast , processes related to the interaction of the jet and its surrounding medium should be enhanced along the ne - sw direction . taking this into account , it is possible to associate the low - velocity cl emission to gas photoionized by the agn while gas radially accelerated due to the interaction with the radio jet should display the largest velocities .",
    "indeed , figs .",
    "[ f_si6chmaps ] and  [ f_si7chmaps ] show that gas accelerated to velocities of up to 500  is present along the edges of the radio contours .",
    "this scenario would also account for the blue- and redshifted lines observed to the ne and sw of the nucleus , respectively .",
    "currently , two main competing models have been proposed to explain the kinematics of the ionized gas in the nucleus of 1068 : on the one hand , the observed nlr kinematics are the result of the interaction of the nuclear gas and the radio jet ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , the observed kinematics can be explained by a biconical radial outflow , pointing to scenarios where the gas acceleration is produce by radiation and/or wind pressure ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "while these models suggest very different scenarios , the observational data obtained to date are consistent with both models .",
    "very recently , ms11 tested the scenario proposed by @xcite using  channel maps derived from integral field spectroscopy sinfoni / vlt observations . although the detailed description of the kinematic modelling method was left for a future publication , these authors find that the best - fitting model parameters are in agreement with those of previous long - slit hst studies @xcite .",
    "note , however , that the derived parameters may be affected by the contamination of the 2  1.96  to the  emission line discussed above , which particularly affects the blueshifted high - velocity channels .",
    "the overall trend observed in the cls channel maps derived from the nifs observations is consistent with the main kinematic models proposed so far to explain the long - slit observations of the ionized gas in this galaxy .",
    "however , the richness of the 3d data presented here gives a more global view of the nucleus of 1068 , and will guide future modelling .",
    "emission - line ratios provide important information about physical properties of the emission - line gas ( e.g. density , temperature and metallicity ) averaged over all column densities along a particular line of sight . the excellent spatial resolution and broad wavelength coverage of the integral field spectroscopy data allow us to alleviate the limitations caused by projection effects by the analysis of the emission - line ratios produced by gas with different velocities .",
    "although it is not possible to guarantee that parcels of gas with similar velocity are co - spatial , we can assert that parcels of gas with very different velocities are located in different regions along the line of sight .",
    "thus , the resultant physical parameters are more representative of the different regions than the ones we would obtain integrating along the line of sight . in this section ,",
    "we analyse the / , /  and /  emission - line ratios in order to gain information about the ionization structure and the presence of shocks in the inner regions of 1068 .",
    "few works in the literature have reported the simultaneous detection of  and  in 1068 .",
    "to our knowledge , only @xcite and @xcite measured these two lines by means of long - slit spectroscopy .",
    "the relative strengths of the silicon emission lines found in these two works pointed to a hard spectrum photoionizing source as the primary excitation for the majority of the emission .",
    "it was assumed that the source was the nuclear central engine .",
    "moreover , @xcite suggest that shocks generated by the radio jet nlr interaction could provide the additional power required for line formation",
    ". individual  and  images , shown in figs .",
    "[ f_si6chmaps ] and [ f_si7chmaps ] , respectively , reveal resolved and extended emission in both lines , with at least three major separate components : one close to the nucleus , following the direction of the radio jet ; a second one at spot ` g ' of @xcite and a third at 2  arcsec sw from the nucleus . note that the latter two appear significantly stronger than or comparable to  emission .",
    "as both silicon lines are from the same element , their ratio is independent of the metal abundance . because of their difference in ionization potential (",
    "@xmath56  ev ) the ratio can be used to map the ionization structure and mechanisms powering the cls in greater detail than previous long - slit spectroscopy .",
    "[ f_si7si6 ] shows the /  line flux ratio in 1068 for the velocity bins between -1500  to 600  at a step of 300 .",

    "it can be seen that a large variation in the value of the ratio is found across the different regions , from @xmath58 to @xmath59 , that is , nearly 1 dex .",
    "the largest values are found in an elongated region coincident with the inner portion of the jet before bending ( s - n direction ) , where a ratio of @xmath60 is measured , and at about 1.3  arcsec sw from the centre ( cloud hst - h ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where a bright compact spot displaying a ratio of @xmath59 is observed . in velocity space , these two peaks correspond to gas at moderate blueshift ( @xmath61 ) and redshift ( @xmath62 ) , respectively .",

    "the smaller values ( /  @xmath53 ) are predominantly found around the ` g ' spot as well as in the emission region at 2.2  arcsec sw from the centre , and in some localized regions sw of the nucleus . in most other areas ,",
    "the line ratio varies between 0.9 and 1.4 . for reference , @xcite and @xcite measured a /  integrated flux line ratio of @xmath65 and @xmath66 , respectively .",
    "taking into account uncertainties , the flux ratios measured in the gemini / nifs data agree with the ones measured previously in the long - slit data except for the three peaks mentioned above .",
    "the fact that they do not coincide spatially with the nucleus , or are not symmetrically distributed around it , reflects the complexity of the inner regions of 1068 , where , for example , an anisotropic radiation field , gradients in density and/or selective absorption could be shaping the observed ionization structure",

    "they found that cls form at distances from just outside the broad - line region to @xmath70  pc , where @xmath71 is the ionizing luminosity in units of @xmath72  ergs  s@xmath11 , in gas with ionization parameter @xmath73 , suggesting that cls will form close to the nucleus in high - density gas and further out from the nucleus in lower density gas .",
    "the peak equivalent width of each line is provided by the models . since that quantity",
    "is referenced to the same point in the incident continuum , a comparison should indicate grossly the expected relative strengths of the cls . using table  1 of @xcite ,",
    "a /  ratio of 1.2 is predicted . at first sight , this result agrees , within a factor of 2 , with the values observed in 1068 .",
    "note , however , that the calculation refers to the peak in the equivalent width distribution , which occurs at distances of a few parsecs from the central source and gas density @xmath74  @xmath39 . at distances of about 100  pc",
    ", the ratio is expected to drop to a fraction of the peak value .",
    "the above result reinforces the need of an additional mechanism powering the cl emission in 1068 . in the light of all observational evidence seen in the preceding sections",
    ", we are therefore let to consider the role of shocks , produced by interactions of either the radio jet or a radially accelerated outflow and the ism .",
    "[ f_si7si6 ] shows , for instance , that spot ` g ' is particularly enhanced in the blueshifted bins ( v@xmath75 and @xmath76 ) , with a /  ratio of @xmath64 at the centre of the spot , surrounded by gas characterized by a line ratio @xmath77 .",
    "as the ne region of 1068 is very little affected by extinction ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , dust can not be blamed for the increase of  emission compared to that of .",
    "moreover , spot ` g ' is located at @xmath63  pc from the centre , which according to the results of @xcite is far from the outer radius where  emission is expected to occur ( @xmath78  pc ) assuming photoionization by the central source alone .",
    "cloud ` hst - h ' is also peculiar in this respect , as it shows the largest /  ratio ( @xmath59 ) and is located at a similar distance as spot ` g ' but in the opposite direction from the nucleus .",

    "they interpreted this as a higher collisional ionization at these locations and suggest that these clouds are strongly interacting with the jet , and that shocks driven into the obstructing clouds produce thermal x - ray emission .",
    "the increase in the /  ratio at these two locations reinforces this hypothesis .    in this regard",

    ", the clouds are moving outwards from the galaxy centre , with the shock front forming on the outer edge of the cloud , whereas the ionizing radiation reaches the opposite edge that faces the active centre .",
    "the ionization due to the primary radiation ( from the central source ) , to the diffuse radiation generated by the free - free and free - bound transitions of the shocked and photoionized gas , as well as the collisional ionization , are all accounted for .",
    "the shock velocity @xmath80 and the ionizing flux from the central source at the lyman limit reaching the cloud , @xmath81 ( in units of @xmath82  s@xmath11  ev@xmath11 ) , are the main input parameters .",
    "other parameters include the pre - shock density , @xmath83 , and the pre - shock magnetic field , @xmath84 .",

    "thus , shocks locally enhance the emission of cls even when taking into account its photoionized precursor . as the maps of fig .",

    "@xmath94 is consistent with the upper limit for the clr found in section  [ s_morphology ] .    additional support of the contribution of shocks to the cl emission in 1068 can be obtained from the work of @xcite .",

    "we should keep in mind , though , that the shock model predictions provide us with only a first - order approximation . in order to have a full description of the clr based on model - fitting , we should suitably combine clouds under different physical conditions ( i.e. , clouds with different @xmath80 and @xmath83 ) with the proper weight so that the emission lines and the observed continuum can be reproduced .",
    "this is far beyond the scope of this paper and is left for a future publication .",
    "what is most important here is that shock models are able to reproduce cl flux ratios at distances as far as a few hundred parsecs , where photoionization by the central source predicts no or very faint cl emission .",

    "observationally confirms the relevance of shocks as an important component of the cl emission in 1068 and , thanks to the spatial and spectral coverage of our integral field spectroscopic data , we are able to identify the particular regions where shocks play a significant role .",
    "a comparison with the exquisite x - ray map of the inner 200  pc of that galaxy is in accord with this scenario .    in summary ,",
    "the /  line flux ratio map found for 1068 reveals localized regions where the gas excitation can not be easily explained by simple photoionization by the central source .",
    "moreover , the fact that these regions follow closely the radio morphology at some specific locations , invokes a scenario where shocks originating from the interaction of the emitting clouds with the radio jet contribute to enhance the ionization state of the gas .",
    "however , other sources of shocks should also be considered ( the interaction of outflowing clouds with the ism , for instance ) .",

    "our main results can be summarized as follows .    1",
    ".   the cls observed in the spectra of 1068 , , , ,  and , display very asymmetric and inhomogeneous distributions .",
    "the emission is elongated along the ne - sw direction , with the stronger emission preferentially localized to the ne of the nucleus .",

    "the morphology displayed by the molecular hydrogen lines is completely different .",
    "the  emission appears to have a shock - excited component .",
    "cls are emitted by gas covering a wide range of velocities , up to @xmath108  relative to the systemic velocity of the galaxy .",
    "there is a trend for the gas located on the ne side of the nucleus to be blueshifted while the gas located towards the sw is redshifted . nevertheless , some redshifted emission is observed ne from the nucleus , consistent with the double - peak profiles observed in optical high- and low - ionization lines . 4 .",
    "the comparison of the line flux distributions with the radio emission suggests that the _ morphology _ of the emission - line gas is closely related to the radio jet observed in the nucleus of 1068 . on the other hand , although the overall gas _ kinematics _ is consistent with being driven by the radio jet , other mechanisms are also possible .",
    "the ionization structure , mapped by the /  emission - line ratio , is highly intricate .",
    "while this ionization map is not easily explained by photoionization by a central source , models taking into account the effects of shocks are able to reproduce the high values of /  observed in some regions .",

    "therefore , the use of integral field spectroscopy is essential in order to map the circumnuclear environment of nearby agn , to disentangle the effects of photoionization and shocks on emission - line properties , and to study the effects of radio jets on their gaseous environment .",
