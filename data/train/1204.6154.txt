    "our initial aim was to define _ a local analog of tropicalization _",
    ", adapted to the study of singularities and of their deformations .",
    "more precisely , we wanted to tropicalize ideals of formal power series rings of the form @xmath27 $ ] , where @xmath9 is any field , and to compare them with the previous ( global ) tropicalizations .",
    "as subvarieties of tori are most naturally studied by taking their closures in associated toric varieties , we wanted to be able to define , more generally , tropicalizations of ideals in formal completions of the coordinate rings of affine toric varieties at their closed orbits , that is , in rings of the form @xmath28 $ ] , where @xmath1 is a ( not necessarily saturated ) finitely generated subsemigroup of a lattice . in the sequel , following @xcite , we call such semigroups _ affine_. in order to get more geometric flexibility ( see remark [ reasnn ] ) , we consider not necessarily normal toric varieties , that is , not necessarily saturated semigroups .    in order to compare local and global tropicalizations , we have to change the ring defining the object under study .",
    "that is why we need to develop a sufficiently general functorial framework for tropicalization . among the characterizations 13 in the previous definition of ( global )",
    "tropicalization , it is the third one which lends itself most easily to such a functorial treatment .",
    "this is not surprising since the set described by ( [ valvp ] ) is an image of berkovich s analytification of @xmath7 , see @xcite .",
    "therefore , we propose the following general framework for tropicalization ( both local and global ) :    * start from a semigroup morphism @xmath29 from an affine semigroup to the multiplicative semigroup of an arbitrary commutative ring . *",
    "consider the space @xmath3 of valuations of the ring @xmath0 with values in @xmath30 .",
    "* consider the tautological map : @xmath31 * if @xmath6 is any subset of @xmath3 , its _ tropicalization _ is defined as the image @xmath32 .",
    "this construction is a functor from the category of pairs @xmath33 and commutative diagrams of morphisms between such pairs to that of maps @xmath34 and commutative diagrams between them .",
    "we speak about _ local tropicalization _",
    "when @xmath35 is a local ring , @xmath5 is a local morphism ( that is , @xmath36 is the set of non - invertible elements of @xmath1 ) , and @xmath6 is a subset of the space of valuations centered on @xmath0 ( that is , nonnegative on @xmath0 ) .",
    "there are two main instances of local tropicalization .",
    "the _ positive tropicalization _ of @xmath0 with respect to a local morphism @xmath5 is the tropicalization of the space @xmath6 of valuations which are strictly positive on the maximal ideal @xmath37 of @xmath0 .",
    "the _ nonnegative tropicalization _ is defined similarly , with the only difference that we tropicalize all nonnegative valuations on @xmath37 .",
    "we consider the following particular instances of the previous definition :    * @xmath38 , @xmath39 $ ] where @xmath7 is an algebraic subvariety of the torus @xmath8 , @xmath5 is the natural morphism which sends each basis vector @xmath40 of @xmath17 to the image @xmath41 in @xmath14 $ ] of the corresponding variable @xmath42 , and @xmath6 is the set of valuations extending the given one on @xmath9 .",
    "therefore , as a special case of our definition , we get the third version of the definition of the tropicalization of a subvariety of a torus as in theorem  [ t:3defs ] .",
    "* @xmath1 is an arbitrary saturated affine semigroup , @xmath39 $ ] , @xmath7 being an algebraic subvariety of the affine toric variety @xmath43 $ ] defined by @xmath1 over @xmath9 and @xmath6 is the whole space @xmath3 .",
    "we get then the notion of tropicalization of a subvariety of a normal affine toric variety introduced by payne @xcite .",
    "our definition of local tropicalization can be applied in the following new setting :    * we let @xmath44 be an ideal of a power - series ring @xmath28 $ ] , @xmath45 / i$ ] , @xmath5 be the natural semigroup morphism associating to each element of @xmath1 the image in @xmath0 of the corresponding monomial , and @xmath6 be the subspace of @xmath3 of valuations centered at @xmath0 which extend the trivial valuation of @xmath9 .    our main structural results about tropicalization state the piecewise - linear structure of the local positive tropicalization ( see theorem  [ t : main ] and proposition  [ globloc ] for the general statements ) . to give the reader an idea of these results , we state here a particular case .",
    "let us take @xmath46 .",
    "then @xmath28 $ ] is isomorphic to the ring of formal power series in @xmath47 variables .",
    "let @xmath44 be an ideal of the ring @xmath27 $ ] of formal power series in @xmath47 variables over an arbitrary field @xmath9 endowed with the trivial valuation .",
    "then :    1 .",
    "the finite part of the local positive tropicalization @xmath48 of the ideal @xmath44 ( that is , of the natural morphism from @xmath1 to the quotient local ring @xmath49/i$ ] ) is the support of a finite rational polyhedral fan in @xmath50 .",
    "if @xmath44 is prime and @xmath51/i$ ] has krull dimension @xmath52 , then @xmath48 has pure dimension @xmath52 .",
    "3 .   if @xmath44 is the formal completion of the localization at @xmath53 of an ideal @xmath54 of the polynomial ring @xmath55 $ ] , then the local positive tropicalization @xmath48 coincides with the global tropicalization @xmath56 of the subvariety of the torus defined by @xmath54 inside the open cone @xmath57 .",
    "the last point of the theorem shows that it is possible to reconstruct the ( global ) tropicalization of a subvariety of a torus from local tropicalizations of its closure at the closed points of various toric varieties associated to that torus . in this sense ,",
    "global tropicalization depends only on the boundary structure of the subvariety of the torus .",
    "in fact , the local tropicalization of an ideal @xmath44 of @xmath28 $ ] depends only on the toroidal structure of the ambient space @xmath58 $ ] . in order to show this",
    ", we prove that , more generally , we can tropicalize semigroup morphisms of the form : @xmath59 where @xmath60 denotes the subgroup of invertible elements of @xmath61 .",
    "this allows , e.  g. , to tropicalize objects which are not necessarily endowed with a toroidal structure :    * if @xmath62 is a germ of normal ( algebraic or analytic ) variety and @xmath63 is a reduced weil divisor on it , consider a finitely generated semigroup @xmath1 of effective cartier divisors supported on @xmath63 .",
    "then , taking @xmath64 , we have a natural semigroup morphism @xmath65 , obtained by associating to each cartier divisor a defining function in @xmath0 , which is well - defined modulo units .",
    "* we keep the same setting as in the previous example and let @xmath1 be the full semigroup of effective cartier divisors supported on @xmath63 .",
    "then we obtain a canonical tropicalization for each ideal @xmath44 of @xmath66 associated to the pair @xmath67 , by taking @xmath68 and the natural semigroup morphism @xmath65 given by composing the map of the previous example with the map @xmath69 induced by the quotient morphism @xmath70 .",
    "these examples should be useful for the local study of weil divisors on algebraic or analytic varieties , in such simple cases as those of germs of plane curves .",
    "in particular , they should allow to understand tropically a good amount of combinatorial invariants of singularities , for instance those extracted from weighted dual graphs of resolutions or embedded resolutions .",
    "each section in this paper begins with a brief description of its content .",
    "the comparison with the existing literature on the subject is concentrated in the last section , which also contains a brief description of possible interactions with developing fields of mathematics and two open problems .",

    "we are grateful to pedro d. gonzlez prez , hussein mourtada and bernard teissier for their remarks on previous versions of this paper .",
    "last but not least , we thank heartedly the two anonymous referees for their very careful reading and for their many suggestions for clarification .",
    "in this section we introduce the vocabulary and basic facts about semigroups that we shall use in this paper .",
    "[ defsg ] a * semigroup * is a set @xmath1 endowed with an associative binary operation @xmath71 .",
    "_ in the sequel , we shall consider only _ commutative _ semigroups_. the simplest examples are abelian groups , but semigroups are interesting precisely because of the existence of elements which are not invertible .",
    "if a semigroup has a neutral element @xmath53 , then we call it a semigroup _ with origin_. if it has an @xmath72 element ( also called _ absorbing _ ) , that is , an element which is unchanged by the addition of any other element , then it is called a semigroup _ with infinity_. we see immediately that , if they exist , then the origin and the infinity are unique .",
    "if the semigroup law is thought multiplicatively then , by analogy with @xmath73 , the origin is denoted @xmath18 and the infinity is denoted @xmath53 ( see for example @xcite ) , and we speak sometimes about semigroups _ with identity _ and _ with zero_. nevertheless , in the sequel we are consequent with the previous terminology and we say that , when @xmath74 is a ring , then @xmath53 _ is the infinity of _ the semigroup @xmath61 .",
    "if a semigroup @xmath1 has no origin , then we may canonically add such element to it , obtaining the semigroup with origin @xmath75 .",
    "if it has no infinity , we can analogously add to it a new element @xmath72 , getting @xmath76 .",
    "[ gensg ] a semigroup is called * cancellative * if , whenever @xmath77 satisfy @xmath78 , we have @xmath79 .",
    "it is called * of finite type * if it can be generated by a finite number of elements .",
    "it is called * torsion - free * if whenever @xmath80 and @xmath81 for some @xmath82 , we have @xmath83 .",
    "note that a semigroup with infinity is not cancellative , excepted in the degenerate case when it has only one element , which is necessarily both the origin and the infinity .",
    "the following type of semigroups will play an essential role in our paper :    [ toricsg ] a semigroup with origin @xmath84 is called * affine * if it is commutative , of finite type , cancellative and torsion - free .",
    "the simplest affine semigroups are the various @xmath85 .",
    "the terminology `` _ _ affine _ _ '' is motivated by the fact that those are precisely the semigroups associated to _ affine _",
    "toric varieties ( see the next section and @xcite ) .",
    "consider a semigroup @xmath1 with origin . if @xmath86 , an _ inverse _ of @xmath87 is an element @xmath88 such that @xmath89 . if it exists , the inverse of @xmath87 is unique and we denote it simply by @xmath90 .",
    "the set of invertible elements is a subgroup of @xmath1 , which we denote @xmath91 .",
    "we let @xmath92 be its complement in @xmath1 .",
    "it is a prime ideal of @xmath1 ( see lemma [ primid ] ) , in agreement with the next definition :    [ sgideal ] if @xmath1 is a semigroup , an * ideal * of @xmath1 is a subset @xmath93 satisfying @xmath94 . an ideal is called * proper * if @xmath95 .",
    "the ideal @xmath44 is * prime * if it is proper and , whenever @xmath96 satisfy @xmath97 , then at least one of @xmath98 is in @xmath44 .",
    "this vocabulary is motivated by the following fundamental example of semigroups :    [ multring ] let @xmath99 be a commutative ring . forgetting the addition , @xmath100 is a semigroup with origin @xmath101 .",
    "@xmath102 is cancellative if and only if @xmath0 is a domain .",
    "any ideal @xmath44 of the ring @xmath99 is an ideal of the semigroup @xmath61 .",
    "the converse is not true , as we do not ask for stability of the operation @xmath103 in the semigroup - theoretical definition of an ideal .",
    "for example , if @xmath104 , the semigroup - ideal generated by @xmath105 and @xmath106 is the set of integers divisible either by @xmath105 or by @xmath106 , which is not a ring - ideal .",
    "[ primid ] the subsemigroup @xmath92 of non - invertible elements of @xmath1 is a prime ideal of @xmath1 .",
    "let us first verify that @xmath92 is an ideal .",
    "suppose that @xmath107 and @xmath88 satisfy @xmath108 .",
    "this means that there exists @xmath109 such that @xmath110 . but",
    "this can be rewritten by associativity as @xmath111 , which shows that @xmath112 , a contradiction .",
    "therefore , @xmath113 , which is the definition of the fact that @xmath92 is an ideal .",
    "the fact that this ideal is prime is immediate , consequence of the fact that @xmath91 is stable under addition .",
    "it is a formal exercise to see that the preimage of an ideal by a morphism of semigroups is again an ideal and that , moreover , in this way , prime ideals are transformed into prime ideals .",
    "notice also that each semigroup @xmath1 with origin is _ local _ , in the sense that it contains a unique maximal ideal @xmath92 .    in ring theory ,",
    "ideals are precisely the kernels of the ring - morphisms .",
    "this is not true for semigroups . in order to speak about this phenomenon",
    ", we introduce basic notation about morphisms of semigroups .",
    "if @xmath114 and @xmath115 are semigroups , we denote by : @xmath116 the set of morphisms of semigroups from @xmath114 to @xmath115 .",

    "nevertheless , unlike for abelian groups , the knowledge of this kernel is not enough to determine the associated surjective map @xmath124 up to isomorphism .",
    "indeed , the fact that not all elements are invertible does not allow to conclude from @xmath125 that @xmath87 is obtained from @xmath126 by adding an element of the kernel .",
    "briefly said , in general the kernel does not describe _ all _ the fibers of the map @xmath127 .    in order to be able to reconstruct the whole map @xmath128",
    ", we have to encode the whole collection of its fibers .",
    "this may be done by looking at them as the equivalence classes of an equivalence relation @xmath129 .",
    "this equivalence relation on @xmath114 is _ compatible with the addition _ , so it is a _ congruence _ :    [ congr ] let @xmath84 be a semigroup with origin .",
    "a * congruence * on @xmath1 is an equivalence relation compatible with the addition .",
    "if @xmath129 is a congruence on @xmath1 , we see immediately that the addition on @xmath1 descends naturally to a semigroup law on the quotient @xmath130 , the quotient map becoming a morphism of semigroups with origin .    for instance",
    ", the relation defined by @xmath131 is a congruence .",

    "it may well happen that our work is very close to something already done or something currently being developed by other researchers . in this section",
    "we would like to explain what we think is new in our approach and what is taken from other sources .",
    "the idea of tropicalization , though the term itself is relatively new , appeared already in bergman s paper @xcite from 1971 .",
    "even all three definitions of the tropicalization ( using valuations , the definition based on initial ideals , and the one using @xmath9-valued points ) are present there .",
    "bieri and groves @xcite proposed the elegant point of view that the piecewise - linear complexes that are now called tropicalizations are _ invariants of the morphisms @xmath1571 from a finitely generated free abelian group @xmath254 to the multiplicative group @xmath1572 of a field @xmath9 _ or , more generally , of the morphisms @xmath1573 to the multiplicative semigroup of a ring @xmath0 .",
    "as the reader should remember , we defined local tropicalization as a subset of an extended affine space , and this subset corresponds to a morphism @xmath1574 from a semigroup @xmath1 .",
    "this generalizes bieri and groves point of view , though payne s work @xcite , where tropicalizations of embeddings into arbitrary toric varieties are studied , was also very motivating for us",
    ". extensions of affine spaces ( called linear varieties in our paper ) were already defined in @xcite . they are explained also in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ; our presentation has no substantial differences , but we describe in more detail the topology of those spaces .",
    "as far as we know , tropicalizations of semigroup morphisms @xmath1575 for arbitrary local rings @xmath0 have not been studied in the literature before .",
    "however , tropicalizations of not only algebraic but also analytic objects were defined and studied by touda @xcite , rabinoff @xcite , and gubler @xcite .    in fact , the main part of our paper ( sections  [ s : powerseriesring ] , [ s : lstruct ] , and [ s : localglobal ] ) were an extension of touda s work @xcite , though we started this project without knowing about it .",
    "touda studies tropicalizations of ideals in the ring of formal power series over the field @xmath703 of complex numbers .",
    "he works with the definition of local tropicalization using weights ( analog of the second one used for global tropicalization , as recalled in the introduction ) .",
    "he proves then a theorem about piecewise - linear structure of the local tropicalization . as an important tool in his proofs ,",
    "he uses the notion of local grbner fan of an ideal in a formal power series ring , as well as its properties proven by bahloul and takayama in @xcite .",
    "the differences with our approach are the following .",
    "we work in the more general setting of morphisms @xmath1574 , in particular , @xmath0 can be an algebra over an arbitrary field @xmath9 , and we consider general ring valuations which lead to local tropicalizations living in an extended affine space , whereas touda restricts only to the real part of the local tropicalization .",
    "another new result in our local finiteness theorem is the statement about dimension of local tropicalization .",
    "we should also note that some important steps of the construction of a tropical basis ( e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition  6.3 ) ) are left without proof in @xcite .",
    "the main objects of the papers @xcite and @xcite are rings of series with some convergence conditions over fields endowed with a _ nontrivial _ valuation and ideals in these rings . notice that our local conditions ( see definition  [ d : loctrop ] ) imply that if the local ring @xmath0 has a subfield @xmath9 , then any local valuation on @xmath0 is _ trivial _ on @xmath9 .",
    "thus we think that our work is in a way complementary to @xcite and @xcite .",
    "another important difference is that we could work completely without the theory of affinoid algebras that plays a major role in @xcite and @xcite , and in the proof of piecewise - linear structure of the tropicalization in @xcite .",
    "the local conditions lead also naturally to the question about extensions of nonnegative valuations treated in section  [ s : extval ] . despite the fact that the literature on the valuation theory is very rich",
    ", we are not aware of any reference for questions of this kind .    in the proof of the local finiteness theorem",
    "we follow well - known ideas .",
    "the use of grbner basis techniques in describing the structure of tropicalization is common , perhaps , since the paper @xcite of speyer and sturmfels . to show the existence of universal standard , or grbner , bases in power series rings we apply the method of sikora @xcite ( as explained by boldini in @xcite ) .",
    "different and more constructive proofs should exist , but we do not know about them",
    ". it would be interesting to check if sikora s method is applicable also to affinoid algebras . as it is said in (",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* remark  8.8 ) , a theorem on the existence of a universal standard basis for an ideal in an affinoid algebra would be an important part of the analytic tropical geometry .",
    "the method of a flat degeneration of an ideal to its initial ideal is rather standard , see , e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  15.17 ) .",
    "the fact that an ideal @xmath44 and its initial ideal @xmath790 locally around @xmath20 have the same tropicalization has also been observed earlier , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* remark  7.9.2 ) .",
    "as we showed in section  [ s : localglobal ] , the usual tropicalization of subvarieties of a torus or of a toric variety can be glued from the local tropicalizations . however , to claim that our local tropicalization generalizes the usual one would not be completely honest , since we essentially use properties of the tropicalization of subvarieties of toric varieties in the proof of theorem  [ t : main ] .",
    "we are not aware of any other treatment of tropicalization of subvarieties of toroidal embeddings .",
    "a new feature in this case is the absence of the `` big torus '' in a toroidal embedding .",
    "however , our local tropicalization is well suited for this situation since it uses only the `` formal torus embedding '' @xmath1576 $ ] .",
    "once the theory of tropicalization of ideals of the rings @xmath28 $ ] has been developed , the construction of tropicalization of subvarieties of toroidal embeddings is very natural and straightforward .",
    "one should be able to prove in the toroidal setting an analog of payne s main theorem from @xcite relating tropicalizations and analytifications in the berkovich sense .",
