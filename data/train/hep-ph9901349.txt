    "the interest in semileptonic b decays is currently increasing as the b factory in kek is scheduled to begin to collect data later this year .",
    "this domain of physics is likely to upgrade our knowledge on the standard model parameters as well as to provide tests on its validity .",
    "the semileptonic b decays can contribute to the former as their theoretical description is now far more successful than that of the hadronic processes@xcite@xcite .",
    "the polarization of the charged lepton does not depend on the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa matrix element and so it can be instrumental in finding the quark masses .",
    "the longitudinal polarization of the tauon including first order perturbative qcd corrections has been found analytically @xcite by taking the analytical decay width for the unpolarized case @xcite and calculating the width for a negative polarization .",
    "then the result can be integrated to give polarized tau energy distribution .",
    "the method used in that calculation can easily be modified to give other polarizations .",
    "this fact matters insomuch that experimentally it is the polarization along the intermediating @xmath1 boson direction that is easier to measure @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "the reason is that the direction of @xmath2 lepton can be determined at b factories with rather poor accuracy . on the other hand",
    "the direction of @xmath1 is opposite to the direction of hadrons in semileptonic b decays .",
    "the latter can be well measured at least for the exclusive @xmath3 and @xmath4 channels which probably contribute the dominant contribution to the inclusive decay rate .",
    "the present calculation includes tree level and hqet corrections only .",
    "we are unable to calculate perturbative qcd corrections because the analytic structure of expressions is far more complicated than in the case of the longitudinal polarization@xcite .",
    "however , indications exist that the effects of perturbative qcd corrections on @xmath2 polarization are negligible . in particular , the above - mentioned longitudinal polarization does not change visibly after the first - order perturbative corrections have been included either in the rest frame of the @xmath1 boson @xcite or that of the decaying quark @xcite .",
    "the paper is broken up into four sections . in sec.2 ,",
    "kinematical variables are introduced .",
    "secs.3 and 4 are to explain the method used in the calculation and then the results are shown is sec.5 . in appendix a some details of hqet calculations are explained including the discussion of singularity problems .",
    "such problems were also encountered in @xcite where a method was proposed to eliminate them .",
    "in this section we define the kinematical variables used throughout the article as well as their boundaries .",
    "the calculation is performed in the rest frame of the decaying @xmath5 meson , which coincides with that of the @xmath6 quark at the tree level in the parton model .",
    "the four - momenta of the particles are denoted as following : @xmath7 for the @xmath6 quark , @xmath8 for the @xmath9 quark , @xmath1 for the virtual @xmath1 boson , @xmath2 for the charged lepton , and @xmath10 for the corresponding antineutrino .",
    "all the particles are assumed to be on - shell so that their squared four - momenta equal their masses : @xmath11 the employed variables are scaled to the units of the decaying quark mass @xmath12 : @xmath13 henceforth we scale all quantities so that @xmath14 .",
    "the charged lepton is described by the light - cone variables : @xmath15 the @xmath1 boson is characterized likewise : @xmath16 the phase space is defined by the ranges of the kinematical variables : @xmath17 the limits above are obtained within the parton model approximation .",
    "they change if we allow for fermi motion , which we must in order to be able to discuss the hqet corrections to the decay widths@xcite@xcite .",
    "also , contrary to the parton model case , the energy of neutrino can vary within limits which depend in a non - trivial manner on the values of the variables @xmath18 .",
    "the details of the subject were discussed in @xcite , so we will only state here that the integrations involving delta functions and their derivatives have the effect of confining the range of the variables @xmath18 to that of the parton model .",
    "the polarization is found by evaluating the unpolarized decay width and any of the two corresponding to a definite polarization , according to the definition , @xmath19 where @xmath20 .",
    "the calculation of the polarized width is structured after the manner of that which has yielded the longitudinal polarization @xcite .",
    "thus in the rest frame of the decaying quark , one can decompose : @xmath21 the coefficients @xmath22 can be evaluated using the conditions defining the polarization four - vector @xmath23 , which reduce to the following when the parton model value of the neutrino energy is assumed : @xmath24 where the superscripts at @xmath25 denote the polarization of the lepton , while @xmath26 this observation is made relevant by the fact that the decay width for a definite polarization of the charged lepton is gotten from the analogous expression for the unpolarized case , @xmath27 where @xmath28 by formally replacing the lepton four - momentum by the following four - vector @xmath29 : @xmath30 then we obtain , @xmath31 although the expressions above are written for the born approximation , corrections received by the hadronic tensor obviously do not alter this scheme , so that we can apply it to the hqet calculations , too . however , the coefficients in the decomposition ( [ stolq ] ) need to be re - evaluated , taking into account the fermi motion and working in the rest frame of the decaying meson . for a derivation of these cf .",
    "appendix a. applying now the representation ( [ stolq ] ) of the polarization four - vector @xmath23 we readily obtain the following useful formula for the matrix element with the lepton polarized : @xmath32\\ .\\ ] ] the above expression is valid for the hqet corrections , too . the first term on the right hand side of ( [ abexp ] )",
    "can be calculated immediately once we know the result for the unpolarized case .",
    "then the other terms require the formal replacement of the four - momenta @xmath33 and @xmath34 in the argument .",
    "using the operator expansion technique , one can obtain corrections to the decay widths of heavy hadrons which effectively lead to new terms in the hadronic tensor appearing in the triple differential decay width , @xmath35 the hadronic tensor @xmath36 , related to an inclusive decay of a beautiful hadron @xmath37 , @xmath38 can be expanded in the form @xmath39 the form factors @xmath40 can be determined by using the relation between the tensor @xmath36 and the matrix element of the transition operator @xmath41\\ , \\ ] ] which is @xmath42 the coefficients @xmath40 of ( [ wn ] ) have all been found elsewhere , see eg .",
    "@xcite for a complete list",
    ". then the distribution ( [ d3 ] ) can be schematically cast in the following form : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the value of the neutrino energy in the parton model kinematics .",
    "the triple differential distribution must be integrated over the neutrino energy to give meaningful results .",
    "the final lepton energy distribution obtained on two subsequent integrations may be trusted except for the endpoint region where the operator product expansion fails . in the present paper",
    "we give the double differential distribution so that the lepton energy distribution has to be obtained numerically .",
    "the calculation does not show any features unfamiliar from the cases of the other known polarizations .",
    "the polarized distribution can be written in the form , @xmath45 where @xmath46 the first term on the right hand side of eq.([hqet2 ] ) stands for the unpolarized distribution , given e.g. in @xcite , eq.@xmath47",
    ". here we will only give the new other term : @xmath48\\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath49 @xmath50   { \\delta ( z_{\\pm } ) }   + { k_b } h_{4,\\pm } { \\delta^\\prime(z_{\\pm } ) } \\right\\}\\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath51 and @xmath52 @xmath53 @xmath54 the parameters @xmath55 , representing the kinetic energy and the chromomagnetic energy , are defined according to @xcite .      as regards the hqet correction terms",
    ", we only give the energy distribution in the form of a diagram evaluated numerically .",
    "beneath we also give the born level approximation analytically .",
    "the analytic formulae for the polarized distribution can be simplified if we split the kinematical range of @xmath56 into two parts , separated by the value of the charged lepton energy where the virtual @xmath1 boson can stay at rest .",
    "this value is @xmath57 in the formulae below , the superscripts @xmath58 refer to the appropriate regimes : @xmath59 the energy distribution of polarized @xmath2 lepton reads , @xmath60\\ .\\ ] ] the function @xmath61 represents the unpolarized case , @xmath62 + ( 3y-6\\eta)(2-y)\\right\\}\\quad , \\ ] ] with @xmath63 the function @xmath64 reads , @xmath65 with @xmath66 @xmath67 \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath68 where @xmath69 the function @xmath70 can be written in the form , @xmath71 with @xmath72 due to terms containing inverse powers of @xmath73 the expression ( [ eq : deltaf ] ) for @xmath64 is apparently divergent at @xmath74 . however , expanding @xmath64 in powers of @xmath73 for @xmath75 and @xmath76 one can check that this function is regular at @xmath74 .",
    "= 270pt = 270pt    the hqet contribution to the decay distributions is known to render them unreliable near the endpoint values of the tauon energy .",
    "this ambiguity reveals itself in the polarization as well .",
    "similar problems appear also in calculations of perturbative corrections@xcite .",
    "all these problems are cured if instead of distributions their moments are considered@xcite . in the case of @xmath2 polarization",
    "a better defined quantity is the integrated polarization @xmath77 where both the lowest - order perturbative and the hqet terms are included . in fig.[fig1 ]",
    "the integrated polarization is shown as a function of the scaled energy @xmath56 of the @xmath2 lepton .",
    "the lowest order prediction corresponds to the dashed line and the solid line is obtained including hqet corrections .",
    "the question arises whether the perturbative qcd corrections can change this result significantly . as already suggested in the introduction , it is plausible that no such thing happens .    on integration over the whole range of",
    "the charged lepton energy one arrives at the total polarization at the tree level corrected for the @xmath78 effects as predicted by hqet . for @xmath79 gev and @xmath80 gev",
    ", we obtain @xmath81 taking @xmath82 gev@xmath83 and @xmath84 gev@xmath83 we obtain @xmath85 .",
    "although we are mostly concerned with the tau lepton polarization here , the formulae derived in the present work may well be used in evaluating the polarization of the light leptons .",
    "interestingly , in the limit of a vanishing mass of the charged lepton the polarization falls to zero apart from the endpoints , c.f .",
    "( [ eq : deltaf ] ) and ( [ lw2 ] ) .",
    "it is due to the chiral @xmath86 structure of the weak charged current that , according to eq.([kliniowy ] ) , the decay widths with a definite polarization differ by a term proportional to @xmath87 .",
    "the polarization four - vector of the charged lepton can be decomposed as follows : @xmath88 where @xmath89 is understood to mean the part of the three - vector @xmath90 perpendicular to the direction of the charged lepton .",
    "the quantities @xmath91 and @xmath92 denote , respectively , the energy and the three - momentum value of the charged lepton .",
    "this form can easily be seen to meet the definition of the polarization four - vector , c.f .",
    "appendix a. as the lepton mass approaches zero eq.([eq : smu ] ) gives @xmath93 however , if we want to keep the angle subtended by the polarization vector and the lepton momentum constant the parallel part of the polarization should be proportional to the perpendicular one , thereby forcing the factor of @xmath94 to be of order of @xmath95",
    ". then the r.h.s of eq.([eq : msmu ] ) tends to zero for @xmath96 . for the vanishing charged lepton mass",
    "the polarization can be non - zero only where the virtual @xmath1 boson is collinear with the charged lepton .",
    "in general the contribution to polarization is appreciable only for @xmath1 direction within the cone defined by the condition @xmath97 in particular this happens if @xmath92 is much larger than the energy of the neutrino . for semitauonic",
    "b decays the condition ( [ eq : cond ] ) is satisfied in the whole phase space and the resulting polarization is fairly large .",
    "the polarization of the tau lepton along the @xmath1 boson direction in semileptonic @xmath98 decays has been found at the tree level in perturbative qcd and the leading order hqet corrections have been included .",
    "the quantity is of experimental interest .",
    "the fact that it does but slowly vary in the regime of low energies of the charged lepton is rather favorable in this context @xcite .",
    "the qcd one - loop corrections are unknown but their irrelevance for the longitudinal polarization both in the rest frame of the decaying quark and that of the @xmath1 boson indicates that no great change is to be expected once they are incorporated .",
    "we would like to express our gratefulness to professor m. raska whose suggestion has provided the experimental rationale for this work .",
    "we will presently construct the four - vector @xmath23 representing a charged lepton polarized along the direction of the @xmath1 boson .",
    "the defining properties of @xmath23 are @xmath99 and @xmath100 complemented by the relation @xmath101 .",
    "since we are working in the rest frame of the decaying meson , the four - vector @xmath23 can be decomposed as @xmath102 where @xmath103 and @xmath1 stand for the four - velocity of the @xmath98 meson and the four - momentum of the intermediate @xmath1 boson , respectively .",
    "while this form automatically satisfies @xmath104 , the other two relations ( [ s1 ] ) and ( [ s2 ] ) have to be imposed , hence yielding the expressions for the coefficients appearing in ( [ sdecomp ] ) . with @xmath105 ,",
    "one readily identifies : @xmath106 these combined with the other dot products lead to the following formulae : @xmath107 the evaluation of the hqet corrections involves differentiation over the neutrino energy , once or twice .",
    "the denominator in the above expressions is easily seen to vanish at the point where the @xmath1 boson is at rest .",
    "it is known that the kinematics of the process , together with the delta functions and their derivatives , finally reduces to integration over the partonic phase space .",
    "then there is one such point where the denominator vanishes , @xmath108 one might thus raise the question of analyticity of the expressions obtained in this way .",
    "however , the divergences cancel and moreover the resulting distribution is continuous if we ignore the endpoint behaviour",
    ". that this is so indeed , may be verified by changing the variables from @xmath109 to the square of the three - momentum of the @xmath1 boson .",
    "then the singularity makes its presence only on integration over @xmath110 rather than affecting the analytical structure of the distributions .",
    "it turns out that using this variable one obtains an analytic expression .",
    "this is made clear once one notices that the only terms that occur in the course of the calculation are the dot products of the four - vector @xmath23 and the other four - vectors .",
    "writing them out explicitly , @xmath111 with @xmath112 where the subscript denotes the polarization direction , we easily verify that the triple differential distribution is analytic in the neutrino energy .",
    "lastly , let us note that another change of variable can be useful for evaluating the distribution .",
    "namely , using the cosine of the angle subtended by the tau lepton and the neutrino@xcite eliminates the singular terms from the double differential distribution .",
    "we have checked numerically that the resulting distribution is the same .",
