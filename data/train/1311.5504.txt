    "<S> we review some of the issues that arise in attempts to compute the hadronic corrections to the muon anomalous magnetic moment using lattice qcd . </S>",
    "<S> we concentrate on the dominant contribution , which requires an accurate evaluation of the hadronic vacuum polarization .    0.7 cm it is well - known that at present there exists a discrepancy of about 3 to 3.5 @xmath0 between the experimental value for the muon anomalous magnetic moment , @xmath1 , and the best theoretical estimate of its value currently available.@xcite since it is expected that the e989 experiment at fermilab will improve the experimental error by a factor 4 , to about 0.15 ppm , it is important that theory keeps up , both in bringing down the error on the theory side , as well as by corroborating the reliability of the theory error .    </S>",
    "<S> the dominant source of error comes from the hadronic contributions to @xmath2 , in particular from the leading - order hadronic vacuum polarization correction ( hvp ) , and from the hadronic light - by - light correction ( hlxl ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore natural to see whether lattice qcd can provide first - principle computations of these contributions with competitive errors . </S>",
    "<S> this would be the first completely theoretical computation of these quantities , since the current best estimate for hvp is based on a dispersive analysis of the experimentally measured @xmath3 cross section , while all estimates for hlxl are based on models . in order to be interesting , such computations should reach at least an accuracy of order 1% for hvp , and 10 - 20% for hlxl . here </S>",
    "<S> we will therefore focus on hvp.@xcite one may also hope that lattice estimates might shed light on potential discrepancies between various non - lattice theory estimates , such as the discrepancy between the @xmath4 determination of hvp , and the estimate in which the @xmath5 part of the spectral function is obtained from @xmath6 decays .    eventually , it will be possible to put quarks , gluons and photons on the lattice , in a combined lattice qcd@xmath7qed framework . </S>",
    "<S> this system can then be probed with a muon , obtaining the full hadronic contribution to @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> this approach is still in the future , although attempts to use this approach are being explored for hlxl.@xcite at present , significantly smaller errors for hvp can be expected by treating the photons as a perturbation , using the lattice to compute the purely hadronic vacuum polarization only . </S>",
    "<S> cross section contains higher - order corrections in @xmath8 . ]    in the latter approach@xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 as a function of euclidean @xmath11 is obtained from the hadronic vacuum polarization @xmath12 , @xmath13 is a known kinematical weight function , and @xmath8 is the fine - structure constant .     </S>",
    "<S> behavior of the integrand @xmath14 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ amu ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> red points show typical data on a @xmath15 lattice with lattice spacing @xmath16  fm and periodic boundary conditions.[f1],width=264 ]    fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ f1 ] shows the integrand of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ amu ] ) in the low-@xmath11 region ; it is peaked around @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> the points with error bars show typical lattice data for this integrand.@xcite the lattice data are restricted to values of @xmath11 available with periodic boundary conditions in finite volume . </S>",
    "<S> the figure demonstrates an important problem in obtaining hvp from the lattice : to obtain lattice data near the peak of the integrand , lattices with a linear volume @xmath18 , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ , @xmath19  fm would be needed ! with a lattice spacing @xmath20 of order @xmath16  fm necessary in order to reach the continuum limit , this would imply @xmath21 , clearly out of reach given present computational resources .    </S>",
    "<S> there are two ways in which one might proceed in order to make progress . </S>",
    "<S> one method is clearly to obtain more data at smaller @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> if one makes use of twisted instead of periodic boundary conditions , one can in principle reach smaller @xmath11 values without increasing the size of the lattice . </S>",
    "<S> investigations in this direction are in progress.@xcite the other is to obtain more precise data at currently available values of @xmath11 , using for instance ama error reduction.@xcite if a theoretically reliable fit function for the @xmath11 behavior of @xmath10 can be found , it may then be possible to extrapolate the integrand of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ amu ] ) to smaller values of @xmath11 , so that the integral @xmath22 can be computed with a small enough error . </S>",
    "<S> quite likely , a combination of these methods will be necessary in practice .    </S>",
    "<S> the most commonly used fitting functions are based on the assumption of vector meson dominance ( vmd).@xcite the problem with these is that such fits assume that the lowest singularity in @xmath10 is at @xmath23 , while in reality @xmath10 has a cut starting at @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , the use of this assumption introduces a model element into the computation , in conflict with the notion of the lattice providing us with an approach from first principles !    theoretically , one can do much better . based on results obtained in the literature on pad approximants ( pas ) , </S>",
    "<S> it was proven in ref .   </S>",
    "<S> that the functions @xmath25}\\frac{a_n}{b_n+q^2 } \\right)\\ , \\quad a_{n\\ge 1}>0\\ , \\quad b_n\\ge 4m_\\pi^2\\ ] ] with either @xmath26 or @xmath27 free provide a series of pas converging to the vacuum polarization everywhere except near the cut @xmath28 $ ] on the minkowski axis . </S>",
    "<S> we note that choosing @xmath29 , @xmath26 and @xmath30 corresponds to a vmd - type assumption , but it does not correspond to a valid pa : as we increase the order of the pa , the poles in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ pa ] ) should approach the branch point at @xmath31 .    while initial explorations of the pa - based fitting method of the low-@xmath11 behavior of @xmath10 look promising,@xcite it is important to have an independent test of any fitting method . </S>",
    "<S> this is particularly important as long as the data in the strongly peaked region of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ f1 ] will remain sparse . </S>",
    "<S> reference   describes the construction of a qcd - based model that allows us to set up a `` test laboratory '' for fits of the low-@xmath11 behavior of @xmath10 .  </S>",
    "<S> gev@xmath32 part of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ amu ] ) can reliably be obtained from a trapezoidal rule approximation of the integral.@xcite ] this model combines the non - strange vector @xmath6 spectral data with a quantitative description beyond the @xmath6 mass using perturbation theory and a model for duality violations in order to create a model for @xmath10 using a dispersion relation . in this model , </S>",
    "<S> the `` exact '' value of the integral below @xmath33  gev@xmath32 is @xmath34 where the tilde reminds us that this quantity is not @xmath2 itself , but instead corresponds to twice the @xmath5 part below 1  gev@xmath32 . using a covariance matrix for @xmath10 data points obtained from a lattice computation </S>",
    "<S> , we may now use the model in order to create realistically correlated fake data sets at typical lattice values of the momenta @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> these data sets can then be fitted using vmd- or pa - type fit functions , allowing us to compare fitted values for @xmath35 with the exact value in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ exact ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> results for such fits are shown in table  [ t1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> vmd@xmath7 corresponds to vmd plus a linear term , and the pa fits correspond to eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ pa ] ) with @xmath36 , @xmath26 or @xmath27 free . for details </S>",
    "<S> , we refer to ref .  . </S>",
    "<S> the first column lists the type of fit , the second column gives the value of @xmath35 from the fit , the third column the error from the fit , and the fifth column the value of @xmath37 per degree of freedom for the fit . from the @xmath37 values </S>",
    "<S> , one would conclude the vmd@xmath7 fit to be reasonable , and one would accept the pa fits @xmath38 $ ] , @xmath39 $ ] and @xmath40 $ ] , if no extra information were available .    </S>",
    "<S> however , in our model tests , we can compare the fitted value with the exact value . </S>",
    "<S> the fourth column shows the `` pull , '' defined by @xmath41 from its values , we see that both vmd - type fits are very bad fits ; there is a large discrepancy between the precision as measured by the fit error and the accuracy as measured by the pull ( even though the vmd@xmath7 fit has an acceptable @xmath42dof ) . </S>",
    "<S> also the @xmath38 $ ] pa is not very good  only the higher order pas yield good fits , but the fit error is of order 5% . for illustration , we show the vmd@xmath7 fit in fig .  [ f2 ] . while the @xmath10 fit looks very good , this is not the case for the integrand of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ amu ] ) . a similar figure for the @xmath39 </S>",
    "<S> $ ] pa looks much better.@xcite     fit : green dashed curves ; model : blue solid curves . left panel : vacuum polarization ; right panel : integrand of eq .  </S>",

    "<S> units as in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ f1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> [ f2],title=\"fig:\",width=211 ]    in conclusion , we believe that it is important to pursue @xmath22 using lattice qcd , but it is clear that much work remains in order to ascertain the accuracy with which this can be done </S>",
    "<S> . in particular , we advocate the use of fit functions for the low-@xmath11 behavior of @xmath10 based on known convergence properties , and the use of detailed tests as sketched above in order to test fit strategies as part of the error analysis of any determination of @xmath22 from the lattice . </S>"
