    "the value - at - risk ( var ) and conditional value - at - risk ( cvar ) are two important risk measures that have been used extensively in recent years in portfolio selection and in risk analysis . whereas the var is closely related to a particular quantile of a random variable , the cvar is formally defined and analyzed by rockafellar and uryasev in two papers @xcite as a way to alleviate some of the computational difficulties associated with the optimization of the var . there is now a substantial literature on the applications and further developments of these two risk measures ; a partial list of this literature relevant to optimization includes the papers @xcite . in particular",
    ", the paper @xcite presents some cvar - based algorithms for computing the var in a portfolio selection problem ; in spite of their practical efficiency , however , these algorithms offer no guarantee of global optimality of the computed var .    setting aside some criticisms of the var mentioned in the literature ,",
    "part of which stems from the difficulty associated with the portfolio selection problem using the var criterion , we study the global optimization problem using a scenario formulation , which is the principal approach employed in the cited references for solving the ( c)var minimization problem .",
    "specifically , we consider the var minimization problem as an lpec @xcite , a linear program with equilibrium constraints , which is a subject pioneered by mangasarian , to whom this paper is dedicated . by exploiting the special structure of this program ,",
    "we derive linear programs whose optimum objective values yield upper and lower bounds for the optimal var .",
    "the bounding procedures are then used in a branch - and - cut algorithm for computing the latter value to global optimality .",
    "a numerical example is provided to illustrate the algorithm .",
    "an lpec is a special case of a mathematical program with equilibrium constraints ( mpec ) .",
    "since the publication of the two monographs @xcite , there has been significant computational advance in numerical methods for solving mpecs ; a partial list of recent references includes @xcite . in spite of such extensive efforts ,",
    "the computation of globally optimal solutions to mpecs remains elusive .",
    "while some mpec solvers are fairly robust in practice , there is no guarantee that their computed solutions are globally optimal solutions .",
    "an important reason for this lack of guarantee for global optimality is the fact that these solvers are all based on local improvement techniques and no global optimization is incorporated in their implementation . as a special mpec ,",
    "the var minimization problem is amenable to solution by any one of the ( local ) methods . in this paper",
    ", we do not stop with this routine adaptation of the existing mpec solvers ; instead , our goal is to develop a branch - and - cut algorithm for solving the minimum var problem to global optimality .",

    "in general , the lpec is initially solved with the complementarity constraint relaxed .",
    "if this problem yields a solution that is complementary , then it is also optimal . otherwise there exists a complementarity that is violated and we can branch on this complementarity .",

    "this process is best envisioned as a tree search where nodes correspond to lp relaxations and edges correspond to branches .",
    "unfortunately , searching the entire branch - and - bound tree is likely to be inefficient .",
    "instead , we will exploit the branch - and - cut methodology to construct the smallest tree that can be used to establish optimality of a given feasible solution .",

    "the mpec solver required 5 iterations to produce an upper bound for the example on hand , which turns out to be globally optimal .",

    "we have also established the convergence of a smoothing approach to compute an approximate var . whereas the var minimization problem is special ( and yet important in its own right )",
    ", we maintain that the bounding schemes can be extended to more general lpecs , and possibly even to other `` convex '' mpecs , namely , mpecs whose only nonconvexity is the complementarity constraint .",
    "indeed , the extension of the upper bounding scheme is fairly straightforward ; it is the lower bounding scheme that is very much problem dependent .",

    "a lesson we have learned from the computational experiments in this paper is that while the nlp solvers are generally very robust , one still requires a proof such as the one given in subsection  [ subsec : branching optimality ] to ascertain the quality of the solutions they produce . for mpecs , we believe that the time is now ripe for combining existing local methods with some global branch - and - cut schemes in order to obtain solutions with proven global optimality .                                .",
