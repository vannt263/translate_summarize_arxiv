    "opportunistic beamforming ( obf ) is a well known adaptive signaling scheme that has received a great deal of attention in the literature as it attains the sum - rate capacity with full channel state information ( csi ) to a first order for large numbers of mobile users in the network , while operating on partial csi feedback from the users . in this paper",
    ", we consider a cellular network which operates according to the obf framework in a multi - cell environment with variable number of transmit beams at each bs .",
    "the number of transmit beams is also referred to as the transmission rank ( tr ) in the paper , and we focus on optimally setting the transmission rank at each bs in the network .",
    "the earliest work of obf appeared in the landmark paper  @xcite , where the authors have introduced a single - beam obf scheme for the single - cell multiple - input single - output ( miso ) broadcast channel .",
    "the concept was extended to @xmath0 random orthogonal beams in  @xcite , where @xmath0 is the number of transmit antennas .",
    "the downlink sum - rate of this scheme scales as @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the number of users in the system  @xcite .",
    "recently , the authors in @xcite have considered using variable trs at the bs , and they have showed that the downlink sum - rate scales as @xmath3 in interference - limited networks , where @xmath4 is the tr employed by the bs .",
    "the gains of adapting variable tr compared to a fixed one is clearly demonstrated in  @xcite , however , how to select the tr for obf is still an open question which has only been characterized in the asymptotic sense for the single - cell system in  @xcite-@xcite , and a two - transmit antenna single - cell system in  @xcite .    in all of the above works ,",
    "the users are assumed to be homogeneous with the large - scale fading gain ( alternatively referred to as the path loss in this paper ) equal to unity .",
    "obf in heterogenous networks has been considered in  @xcite-@xcite . in  @xcite",
    ", the authors focused on the fairness of the network and obtained an expression for the ergodic capacity of this fair network . in @xcite",
    ", the authors modeled the user locations using a spatial poisson point process , and studied the outage capacity of the system . in  @xcite",
    ", the authors considered an interference - limited network and derived the ergodic downlink sum - rate scaling law of this interference - limited network .",
    "the trs in  @xcite-@xcite are considered to be fixed .    in this paper , we are interested in the quality of service ( qos ) delivered to the users . more precisely , we focus on a set of qos constraints that will ensure a guaranteed minimum rate per beam with a certain probability at each bs .",
    "previous studies have shown that user s satisfaction is a non - decreasing , concave function of the service rate  @xcite ; this suggests that the user s satisfaction is insignificantly increased by a service rate higher than what the user demands , but drastically decreased if the provided rate is below the requirement  @xcite .",
    "the network operator can promise a certain level of qos to a subscribed user . to this end , the qos is closely related to the tr of the bs . increasing",
    "the tr will increase the number of co - scheduled users .",
    "however , increasing the tr will also increase interference levels in the network , which will decrease the rate of communication per beam .",
    "a practical question arises ; what is a suitable tr to employ at each bs while achieving a certain level of qos in multi - cell heterogeneous networks ? the authors in  @xcite have performed a preliminary study of this problem for a single - cell system consisting of homogeneous users with identical path loss values of unity .",
    "the main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows .",
    "we focus on finding the achievable trs without violating the above mentioned set of qos constraints .",
    "this can be formulated into a feasibility problem .",
    "for some specific cases , we derive analytical expressions of the achievable tr region , and for the more general cases , we derive expressions that can be easily used to find the achievable tr region .",
    "the achievable tr region consists of all the achievable tr tuples that satisfy the qos constraints .",
    "numerical results are presented for a two - cells scenario to provide further insights on the feasibility problem ; our results show that the achievable tr region expands when the qos constraints are relaxed , the snr and the number of users in a cell are increased , and the size of the cells are decreased .",
    "we consider a multi - cell multi - user miso broadcast channel .",
    "the system consists of @xmath5 bss ( or cells ) , each equipped with @xmath0 transmit antennas .",
    "each cell consists of @xmath2 users , each equipped with a single receive antenna .",
    "a bs will only communicate with users in its own cell .",
    "let @xmath6 denote the channel gain vector between bs @xmath7 and user @xmath8 in cell @xmath9 .",
    "the elements in @xmath6 are independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . )",
    "random variables , each of which is drawn from a zero mean and unit variance _ circularly - symmetric complex gaussian _",
    "distribution @xmath10 .",
    "the large - scale fading gain ( may alternatively referred to as path loss in this paper ) between bs @xmath7 and user @xmath8 in cell @xmath9 is denoted by @xmath11 . the path loss ( pl ) values of all the users",
    "are governed by the pl model @xmath12 for @xmath13 , where @xmath14 represents the distance between the user and the bs of interest .",
    "therefore , the random pl values are also i.i.d . among the users , where the randomness stems from the fact that users locations are random .",
    "moreover , we assume a quasi - static block fading model over time  @xcite .",
    "the bss operate according to the obf scheduling and transmission scheme as follows",
    ". the bss will first pre - determine the number of beams to be transmitted .",
    "bs @xmath9 generates @xmath15 random orthogonal beamforming vectors and transmits @xmath15 different symbols along the direction of these beams ( @xmath15 is the tr employed by bs @xmath9 ) .",
    "this process is simultaneously carried out at all bss .",
    "for bs @xmath9 , let @xmath16 and @xmath17 denote the beamforming vector and the transmitted symbol on beam @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "the received signal at user @xmath8 in cell @xmath9 can be written as    where @xmath19 is the additive complex gaussian noise .",

    "we assume @xmath23 . each user will measure the sinr values on the beams from its associated bs , and feed them back .",

    "let @xmath26 and @xmath27 denote the distributions of the sinr on a beam at user @xmath8 and the maximum sinr on a beam , respectively . since the maximum number of co - scheduled users in cell @xmath9 is equal to @xmath15 , increasing @xmath15 will have the effect of increasing the number of co - scheduled users .",
    "however , increasing @xmath15 will also increase the amount of intra - cell and inter - cell interference , which will decrease the rate of communication per beam .",
    "therefore , we focus on finding an achievable @xmath28 tr m - tuple with a set of qos constraints at all the bss that will ensure a guaranteed minimum rate per beam with a certain probability . to this end , we consider that an outage probability of @xmath29 can be tolerated at each bs , where the outage event refers to the received sinr of the scheduled user on a beam being below a target sinr threshold value @xmath30 , _",

    "we focus on finding the achievable @xmath15s such that these constraints are not violated .",
    "this is a non - trivial problem for the system of interest due to the presence of intra - cell and inter - cell interferences , and the sinr values on a beam being not identically distributed among the users due to their different locations .",
    "we note that there is an implicit constraint that @xmath15 must be an integer . for the analysis",

    "<S> in this paper , we consider a multi - cell multi - user miso broadcast channel . </S>",
    "<S> the system operates according to the opportunistic beamforming framework in a multi - cell environment with variable number of transmit beams ( may alternatively be referred as the transmission rank ) at each base station . </S>",
    "<S> the maximum number of co - scheduled users in a cell is equal to its transmission rank , thus increasing it will have the effect of increasing the multiplexing gain . </S>",
    "<S> however , this will simultaneously increase the amount of interference in the network , which will decrease the rate of communication . </S>",
    "<S> this paper focuses on optimally setting the transmission rank at each base station such that a set of quality of service ( qos ) constraints , that will ensure a guaranteed minimum rate per beam at each base station , is not violated . </S>",
    "<S> expressions representing the achievable region of transmission ranks are obtained considering different network settings . </S>",
    "<S> the achievable transmission rank region consists of all achievable transmission rank tuples that satisfy the qos constraints . </S>",
    "<S> numerical results are also presented to provide further insights on the feasibility problem . </S>"
