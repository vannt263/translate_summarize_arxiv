    "this linear breit - wheeler process refers to a perturbative qed process . in the seminal works by reiss @xcite and others @xcite , the authors fully analyzed and discussed the generalization of the breit - wheeler process to the nonlinear process ( [ one - wave ] ) of @xmath3 pair production off a probe photon colliding with an intensive monochromatic plane wave .",
