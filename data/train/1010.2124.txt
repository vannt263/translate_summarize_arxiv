    "the structure of condensed matter is commonly probed by x - ray or neutron scattering techniques , that yield quantities such as @xmath0 , the static structure factor , and its dynamical counterpart @xmath1 , the intermediate scattering function @xcite . however , in recent years , with the advent of modern confocal microscopes , which are able to characterise the structure of colloidal suspensions in real - space , there is an equally great emphasis on determining the radial distribution function @xmath2 and its dynamical counterpart @xmath3 , the van hove distribution function @xcite .",
    "the van hove distribution function @xmath3 is a real - space dynamical correlation function for characterising the spatial and temporal distributions of pairs of particles in a fluid .",
    "it gives the probability of finding a particle at position @xmath4 at time @xmath5 , where @xmath6 , given that one of the particles was located at the origin at time @xmath7 .",
    "the intermediate scattering function @xmath1 is simply obtained from @xmath3 via spatial ( three - dimensional ) fourier transform .",
    "pair correlation functions are important because of the significant amount of information that they contain : transport coefficients can be calculated via kubo formulae  for example the diffusion coefficient @xmath8 can be obtained from @xmath3  and thermodynamic quantities such as the internal energy and the pressure can be related to spatial integrals@xcite involving @xmath2 . whether or not a liquid is near to freezing",
    "can often be discerned from inspecting the height of the principal peak in @xmath0 : it was first noticed by hansen and verlet @xcite that many simple liquids freeze when the principal peak in @xmath0 at @xmath9 , takes the value @xmath10 .",
    "whether a system is a glass ( i.e.  an amorphous solid ) rather than a fluid may be determined from the long time limit value of @xmath1 , because in a fluid the @xmath11 limit of @xmath1 is zero , whereas for a glass this limit takes non - zero values .",
    "this brief ( and incomplete ) survey is intended to demonstrate that both dynamical and static pair correlation functions are fundamental for characterising and understanding liquids .    in the history of liquid state physics , fluids of hard spheres",
    "have proved to be an important model system for developing new techniques and theories .",
    "the hard sphere model is composed of particles interacting via the pair potential @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the distance between the centers of the particles and @xmath14 is the hard sphere diameter .",
    "hard spheres play an important role in describing real systems , because attractive interactions such as those present in the lennard - jones potential , can often be treated as a perturbation to the hard sphere system @xcite .",
    "hence a theory that can successfully describe the properties of the hard sphere fluid forms a good candidate to work for more realistic systems .",
    "the hard sphere model has further grown in importance in recent decades due to the fact that eq .",
    "provides a good model for the effective interaction potential between colloidal particles in suspension , in the case when the charges on the colloids are small or well screened ",
    "see e.g.  ref . for an example of such a system . as the density of a hard sphere fluid",
    "is increased , the system freezes to a crystalline state , and the hard sphere model has played an important role in developing our understanding of this phase transition .",
    "in contrast , although the glass transition has attracted much interest in recent years , it is still not completely understood .",
    "an introduction to the vast literature on this subject can be found in refs .   and references therein .",
    "a number of universal processes have been discovered , including dynamical heterogeneity @xcite , stretched exponential decay of correlation functions @xcite , and two - stage relaxation times @xcite . in order to understand the processes involved in structural arrest , a number of different theoretical approaches have been used . in particular , mode - coupling theory ( mct ) has been successful in describing the bulk glass transition for hard sphere colloids @xcite , and has been applied e.g. to suspension rheology  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , alternatives to mct have been developed @xcite .",
    "what is clear from the many studies of arrested systems , is that key signatures of the slow dynamics are manifest in dynamical pair correlation functions .    in our previous rapid communication @xcite ,",
    "a theory to calculate the van hove function was proposed . for a bulk fluid of particles interacting via gaussian pair potentials ,",
    "comparison with brownian dynamics ( bd ) computer simulation results showed that the theory is very reliable for determining @xmath3 for this particular model system .",
    "the theory is formulated for inhomogeneous systems and hence was also applied to investigate the dynamics of hard spheres confined between two parallel hard walls @xcite .",
    "this approach has since been applied to investigate dynamics in liquid crystalline systems @xcite . in the current paper",
    "we explore the theory further , and apply it to study a bulk fluid of brownian hard spheres .",
    "we present results for the self and distinct parts of the van hove distribution function , @xmath15 and @xmath16 respectively , and by fourier transforming , for the intermediate scattering function @xmath1 .",
    "we also display results for the scaled intermediate scattering function @xmath17 evaluated at the wave number @xmath18 .",
    "this function is often the central object of focus of mct @xcite .",
    "the two stage relaxation of @xmath19 , that mct predicts close to the glass transition , is also present in our theory .",
    "we also determine @xmath3 and @xmath1 using bd computer simulations and compare these results with those from the theory .",
    "our starting point is a dynamical generalisation of percus test - particle approach @xcite for determining the radial distribution function @xmath2 .",
    "percus showed that for a fluid of classical particles interacting via the pair interaction potential @xmath20 , that if one sets the external potential acting on the fluid @xmath21 , then the one body density distribution @xmath22 of the fluid around the fixed ` test ' particle is equal to the radial distribution function , multiplied by the bulk fluid density @xmath23 ; i.e.  percus showed that @xmath24 .",
    "when using equilibrium density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite to study a fluid , the test - particle method provides a useful route to obtain @xmath2 because @xmath25 ( and hence @xmath20 ) enters the framework explicitly .",
    "we also describe an alternative ` zero - dimensionality ' approach for calculating @xmath2 .",
    "this forms a stepping stone in the development of the dynamical theory .",
    "we apply a dynamical extension of percus idea , together with dynamical density functional theory ( ddft ) @xcite in order to calculate the van hove function @xmath3 in general inhomogeneous situations .",
    "we implement the method using the very simple ramakrishnan - youssouff ( ry ) approximation for the helmholtz free energy functional @xcite .",
    "we find that the results from the theory agree well with those from bd computer simulations when the fluid density @xmath26 . at higher densities",
    "the free energy underlying the dynamics develops a minimum , corresponding to the appearance of a free energy barrier that must be traversed for a particle to escape from the cage formed by the neighbouring particles .    in addition",
    ", we compare our results for @xmath3 to those obtained by assuming that @xmath15 takes a simple gaussian form for all times @xmath5 , together with the vineyard approximation @xcite , which sets @xmath16 to be a simple convolution of @xmath15 and the radial distribution function @xmath2 , as described in detail below .",
    "we find that in contrast to the received wisdom @xcite , the simple vineyard approximation is actually a fairly good approximation for the van hove function for brownian hard sphere fluids at low and intermediate densities .",
    "we also compare to an equilibrium dft based approach with which we are able to calculate a series of density profiles that agree well with those from the ddft .",
    "this is done by performing a constrained minimisation of the free energy through the judicious choice of a suitable external potential to confine the test particle .",
    "this approach is easier to implement than the full ddft and allows for the free energy landscape underlying the dynamics to be mapped out and examined in detail .",
    "however , this approach does not give any of the time information that the full ddft gives ",
    "i.e.  it yields the van hove function with the time labels ` removed ' .",
    "one of the advantages of this approach is that for a particular ( parabolic ) choice of external potentials , we are able to calculate exactly the fluid density profiles , which are precisely those predicted by vineyard s theory @xcite .",
    "we discuss the significance of this result below , after we have laid out the general structure of the theory and shown the results .",
    "this paper is structured as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : back ] we outline the necessary theoretical background , including the definition of the van hove function , the vineyard approximation , ddft , and the static test particle limit .",

    "appendix [ app : a ] presents an exact solution of a corresponding equilibrium situation .",
    "we first recall the definition of the van hove function and some of its properties ; for a more detailed account see refs .. consider a set of @xmath27 particles with time dependent position coordinates @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the particle index , and @xmath5 is time .",
    "the van hove correlation function is defined as the probability of finding a particle at position @xmath4 at time @xmath5 , given that there was a particle at the origin at time @xmath7 : @xmath30 where @xmath31 represents an ensemble average and @xmath32 is the three - dimensional dirac delta function .",
    "@xmath3 can be naturally separated into two terms , conventionally referred to as its `` self '' and `` distinct '' part , by discriminating between the cases @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively .",
    "so @xmath35 where the self part , @xmath15 , describes the average motion of the particle that was initially at the origin , whereas the distinct part , @xmath16 , describes the behavior of the remaining @xmath36 particles .",
    "at @xmath7 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : van_hove_3 ] ) reduces to the static particle - particle auto - correlation function , which is defined as @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the ( static ) pair distribution function . for the homogeneous bulk fluid @xmath39",
    "; isotropy implies that the dependence is only on @xmath40 .",
    "thus , at @xmath7 : @xmath41 from the definitions of @xmath15 and @xmath16 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : van_hove_3 ] ) , it is clear that the volume integral of these functions must be a conserved quantity for all times @xmath5 : @xmath42 the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath3 in bulk in the thermodynamic limit is obtained by considering @xmath43 and volume @xmath44 such that @xmath45 is finite : @xmath46 a key quantity that we use below to characterise @xmath15 is its width @xmath47 defined via @xmath48 the second moment of @xmath15 .",
    "it is often convenient to consider the intermediate scattering function which is related to the van hove function via a spatial fourier transform , @xmath49 this quantity is directly accessible in light and neutron scattering experiments @xcite .",
    "a commonly used approximation for the self part of the van hove function is to assume a gaussian shape @xcite : @xmath50 where the width @xmath51 , when @xmath47 is calculated via eq .  .",
    "the form is exact in the limits @xmath52 and @xmath53 for all densities when the system is fluid @xcite .",
    "it is also exact for all times @xmath5 in the low density limit @xmath54 , where interactions between the particles can be neglected .",
    "there are a number of approximations for @xmath55 . in molecular dynamics , at very short times @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the mean collision time , particles in a fluid do not experience collisions and therefore move freely at a constant velocity .",
    "this is akin to an ideal gas where the particle velocities follow a simple maxwellian ( gaussian ) distribution , giving @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the particle mass . over longer times @xmath60 the particles in the fluid",
    "undergo many collisions with neighbouring particles , so that the trajectory of a given particle is a random walk and thus its probability distribution @xmath15 is the solution of the diffusion equation @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the long time self diffusion coefficient . for the dirac delta initial condition , the solution of eq",
    ".   corresponds to the gaussian form , with @xmath63 for colloidal particles , the collisions with the solvent atoms happen so frequently that the time scale @xmath57 is much smaller than all other time scales relevant for the dynamics , such as the brownian time scale @xmath64 which is roughly the time for a particle to travel a distance equal to its own diameter , and also the typical time scale between collisions of pairs of colloids , @xmath65 .",
    "this means that we may set @xmath66 and that for a low density suspension of colloids eq .",
    "holds for all times @xmath5 .",
    "thus , we may combine eqs .   and to obtain @xmath67",
    "we find below that for brownian hard spheres this approximation is not only reliable in the low density limit , but is also fairly good up to intermediate densities @xmath68 .",
    "vineyard @xcite suggested that one may rewrite the distinct part of the van hove function as @xmath69 which is merely a redefinition of @xmath16 in terms of the unknown function @xmath70 , which is the probability that if there was a particle at the origin at time @xmath7 and a second particle located at @xmath71 , this second particle is later located at @xmath4 at time @xmath5 .",
    "vineyard s approximation is to replace @xmath70 by @xmath72 , giving @xmath73 some comments in the literature state that the vineyard approximation ignores important correlations that inhibit the rate at which the structure of the liquid breaks up and it therefore predicts too rapid decay of this structure @xcite .",

    "[ fig : energy_landscape ] .",
    "we find that this curve is located close to the ddft landscape for @xmath203 but that the deviation grows with increasing density .",
    "we also calculate the free energy landscape via the equilibrium approach described in the previous subsection and compare this to the results from both the dynamic approach and the exact equilibrium result in fig .",

    "[ fig : vineyard_energy_landscape ] , do not follow the exact result , but are very similar to those from the ddft and dft approaches and even exhibit minima for @xmath227 and 0.8 .",

    "for @xmath216 we find that this curve is no longer monotonic and has two disconnected branches .",
    "systems which are in a glassy or jammed state are by definition non - ergodic .",
    "a way of modelling non - ergodicity in brownian dynamics is to measure the state of the system over too short a time frame .",
    "we demonstrate this effect by simulating a fluid where a single tagged particle is trapped in a parabolic potential well ; c.f . eq .  .",
    "if the radius of the well is sufficiently large and the simulation time is too small , then the particle is not able to fully explore the outer regions of the potential well . in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : width_lambda ] we plot two results pertaining to this scenario where the fluid density is @xmath216 , and @xmath271 is the simulation run time . the results for the longer simulation run time agree well with the exact result , but results over the shorter time underestimate the width , particularly at the smaller values of @xmath255 .",
    "a similar effect may exist in the dft approach , where the non - ergodicity arises from not including the states where the particle is far from the origin . recall that formally the density profile from dft is an average over all possible states of the system . using an approximate functional some of these states",
    "may be neglected @xcite .",
    "on the basis of the theoretical and simulation results that we presented in this paper for the dynamics of the bulk hard sphere fluid , we conclude that the dynamical test particle limit , combined with ddft , provides a reliable method for calculating the van hove ( and other related ) dynamical pair correlation functions at low and at intermediate densities @xmath26 . in the previous publication @xcite",
    "we have shown that the theory may be applied in a fairly straightforward manner also to inhomogeneous situations , hence we conclude that the dynamic test particle theory may indeed be used to calculate the van hove function for fluids at interfaces and under confinement .",
    "furthermore we have shown that , quite surprisingly , at low and intermediate densities the very simple vineyard approximation ( reviewed in sec .  [ sec : vineyard_appr ] ) is actually quantitatively fairly good .",
    "this approximation only requires as input the radial distribution function @xmath2 and the diffusivity @xmath62 and therefore provides a very useful quick approach for obtaining an approximation for the van hove function for colloidal fluids .",
    "the possible conclusions about the performance and even about the qualitative status of the predictions of the theory at higher densities are far more intricate though . in this regime , the theory in its current form is clearly quantitatively unreliable ",
    "compare for example , the results from bd simulations in fig .",
    "[ fig : sim](d ) to those from the dynamic test particle theory shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ddft](d ) for @xmath279 , where the theory predicts that the system jams , whereas in simulations the system is an ergodic fluid .",
    "moreover , at even higher densities , the monodisperse hard sphere system crystallises in simulations rather than undergoing a glass transition ; polydispersity would be required to suppress freezing @xcite .",
    "we believe that the behaviour of the theory at higher densities can primarily be ascribed to our choice of approximation for the free energy functional ",
    "see sec .",
    "[ sec : ry_func ] for the reasons for using the ry functional in the present study .",
    "we believe that if we had used a more accurate functional , such as rosenfeld s fundamental measure theory @xcite , quantitatively more accurate results could be obtained at these higher densities .",
    "nevertheless , the theory yields a clear prediction that there is a dynamic ( glass ) transition , whereby the tagged ( self ) particle becomes trapped in the cage formed by the surrounding particles .",
    "we can offer three possible interpretations of this result .",
    "firstly , one may conclude that this glass transition stems simply from the use of the approximate ry functional and since the theory predicts the glass transition to be at a density value that is well below where the glass transition is believed to occur , our results at higher densities should be disregarded .",
    "an alternative conclusion that one may draw is that the theory is correctly describing ( some of ) the physics of the glass transition , but that the predictions are only qualitative in nature and occur in reality at higher densities and in polydisperse systems .",
    "support for this point of view comes in particular from results such as those in fig .",
    "[ fig : intermediate ] , where we display results for @xmath226 . for @xmath280 , which is near to where the theory predicts the glass transition to be",
    ", we find a plateau in @xmath19 and the clear presence of two - stage relaxation , which indeed has been observed in hard sphere colloidal suspensions @xcite . hence our results are ( qualitatively ) similar to those from mct @xcite .",
    "further support for the above interpretation comes from the results in figs .",
    "[ fig : energy_landscape ] and [ fig : vineyard_energy_landscape ] for the behaviour of the free energy landscape that underlies the ddft .",
    "the appearance of a minimum in the free energy as a function of displacement , corresponding to a particle becoming trapped in the cage formed by its neighbours , is one central prediction of the theory by schweizer and saltzmann @xcite , who combined elements of mct , dft , and activated rate theory , in order to describe localization and transport in glassy fluids .",
    "furthermore , given some of the work in the literature based on dft to study the glass transition , our prediction that particles become localized should not come as a surprise : wolynes and coworkers @xcite developed a successful model of hard sphere vitrification , which is similar to the dft treatment of crystallization @xcite . using a random close - packed , non - periodic lattice they found a fluid - glass transition where the fluid `` crystallizes '' onto this lattice .",
    "the success of this method , along with its ability to model the freezing transition ( onto a regular lattice ) , has provoked a number of further developments @xcite .",
    "other approaches @xcite have investigated dense brownian systems through modelling via certain stochastic differential equations and found that the system exhibits glassy behaviour .",
    "thus , overall our results seem to be qualitatively consistent with other dft based theories and with mct for the glass transition . nevertheless , the density where the glass transition occurs , as predicted by the theory in its present form , is far too low .",
    "furthermore , it could be the case that the similarity between our results and those from the mct are somehow a mathematical ( rather than physical ) coincidence , since an essential feature of mct is the presence of memory in the dynamical equations .",
    "this important feature is absent from the present ddft .",
    "the third possible conclusion that one may draw concerns the question whether the minimum in the free energy and the localization of the tagged self particle are merely a signature of freezing in the theory .",
    "the ry functional is well - known to predict the freezing transition to occur at a density below that where it occurs in reality .",
    "it could simply be the case that this functional overly favours freezing , so that when it is applied in the way we use it here , where we constrain all density profiles , @xmath152 and @xmath151 , to be spherically symmetric , a signature of freezing shows up as the tagged self particle becoming localized .",
    "some merit can be found in all of the arguments outlined above and we find ourselves unable to judge which one(s ) are correct .",
    "indeed further work is required to provide a clear assessment of these issues .",
    "in particular , the dynamical test particle theory should be implemented with a more sophisticated approximation for the free energy functional than we have used here .",
    "as we have shown , our approach is based on integrating the smoluchowski equation over all except one of the position coordinates , in order to derive an equation for the one - body density distribution .",
    "an alternative approach is to integrate over all but two of the position coordinates , in order to obtain an equation for the two - body distribution function @xmath281 .",
    "the resulting dynamical equation depends on the three body distribution function @xmath282 . on making a suitable closure approximation ,",
    "this provides a different starting point for studying the pair correlations in a colloidal fluid ",
    "see e.g.  refs .   and references therein , which also consider the effect of the hydrodynamic interactions between the colloids .",
    "developing the theory for the dynamical pair correlation functions in this way is very natural .",
    "however , we believe that the strength of our method , where we use the dynamical test particle approach allowing us to work at the one - body level , is that we are able to use dft to close our equations and therefore we are able to describe the fluid spatial correlations very accurately .",
    "finally , we mention other possible directions for developing the theory in the future .",
    "one important aspect in the dynamics of colloidal dispersions , that we have entirely neglected here , are the hydrodynamic interactions between the particles .",
    "rex and lwen @xcite have shown how to include the hydrodynamic interactions in a ddft treatment and so it would be worthwhile to use their ddft formulation together with the present dynamical test particle limit , in order to calculate the van hove function under the influence of hydrodynamic interactions .",
    "a further aspect of our work , that offers possible extensions of the theory , concerns the question how to model the diffusivity of the tagged particle in a better way : in the dynamical test particle calculation one could replace the ( constant ) diffusion coefficient in eq .   with a diffusion coefficient that depends on time",
    "; i.e.  to replace @xmath283 . in doing this one",
    "could ensure that @xmath284 takes the correct values at both short and long times .",
    "however , doing this still does not treat memory effects in the dynamics .",
    "as mct demonstrates , memory effects are key for a system to exhibit the ideal glass transition scenario@xcite .",
    "thus , we believe that including memory into our theory would be a crucial step in future work .",
    "this could possibly be done along the lines of the interesting work of medina - noyola and coworkers @xcite . to include",
    "memory in our theory one could replace eq .",
    "( 29 ) with@xcite : @xmath285}{\\delta \\rho_i({\\mathbf{r}}',t')}\\right ] , \\label{eq : mt_ddft2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the mobility coefficient @xmath286 has been replaced by one that is non - local in time and space .",
    "however , this would result in a considerable increase in computational complexity as within dft the correlations in space are already treated in a complex manner and these would need to be coupled to the correlations in time . whether such non - locality helps to cure some of the deficiencies of our approach is an open question .",
    "we consider a fluid of @xmath27 particles with positions @xmath287 , momenta @xmath288 and mass @xmath59 in the presence of an arbitrary external field that acts _ only _ on particle @xmath289 , @xmath290 . assuming that we are in the classical limit , the hamiltonian is given by @xmath291 where the contributions are due to the ( classical ) kinetic energy , the total inter - particle potential ( not necessarily pairwise additive ) , and the external potential , respectively ; @xmath292 the _ canonical partition function _ , @xmath293 ,",

    "the integrations over momenta in eq .   can be carried out explicitly , leaving a _ configuration integral _ over positional degrees of freedom : @xmath297 note that for brownian particles @xmath298 is also the quantity that characterises the structure of the fluid . substituting our external potential into we obtain @xmath299 where in the second step",
    "we have made the substitution @xmath300 , for @xmath301 , so that we can do the integrations over the positions @xmath302 .",
    "this gives , @xmath303 where @xmath277 is the configuration integral for @xmath27 particles where one particle is located at the origin .",
    "the helmholtz free energy is then given by , @xmath304 where @xmath305 is the volume occupied by the particles , which yields @xmath306 therefore , the helmholtz free energy only depends on the confining potential in a simple way .",
    "one can also obtain the one body density profiles .",

    "it can be shown that since @xmath152 is a gaussian , then @xmath219 and @xmath255 are simply related by @xmath311 and we can rewrite eq .",
