    "scaling concept plays a vital role in describing critical phenomena associated with a second - order phase transition .",
    "the fundamental hypothesis states that , in the vicinity of a critical point , the largest length scale of the fluctuation of the order parameter diverges and all length scales contribute with equal importance @xcite .",
    "theoretical arguments based on this hypothesis explain why most thermodynamic quantities near the critical point exhibit power - law behaviour with characteristic exponents that are independent of the microscopic details of a system @xcite .",
    "a primary example of a physical model exhibiting a second - order phase transition is the two - dimensional ising model with ferromagnetic interaction @xcite .",
    "this model has been used extensively for innumerable projects in statistical physics , mainly due to its simplicity and broad applicability to real systems .",
    "whereas its physical properties have been thoroughly investigated , it still continues to raise interesting issues that are relevant to a wide range of critical phenomena .",
    "most intriguing among them is the critical properties of the ising model defined on curved geometry @xcite .",
    "in fact , several studies have been carried out on ising lattice models with topologies ranging from a torus @xcite , and sphere @xcite to genus two curved surfaces @xcite , as well as those with brascamp - kunz boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "the results of these studies are consistent with the fact that an alteration in the topology or the boundary condition of the ising lattice does not change its scaling behaviour , and thus the system remains in the flat - space onsager universality class @xcite .",
    "the objective of the current study is to focus on an alternative property of curved geometries  surface _ curvature _  instead of their _",
    "topology_. our main concern is whether a uniform change in the constant surface curvature affects the scaling behaviour of the mounted ising lattice model .",
    "it should be noted that in most systems considered thus far , the magnitude of surface curvature is spatially concentrated on a portion of the surface , even producing a conical singularity .",
    "this inhomogeneous distribution of local curvature would possibly make it difficult to distinguish the effect of curvature from among other incidental contributions on the critical properties .",
    "in addition , when a surface has a closed form ( e.g. , a sphere ) , its ability to attain the thermodynamic limit with a constant surface curvature is disabled .",
    "this limitation can be removed successfully by employing a surface with a constant negative curvature .",
    "this surface , in which the gaussian curvature possesses a finite constant value at arbitrary points , is simply connected and infinite @xcite .",
    "hence , such a surface can serve as an example for considering the geometric effects on the critical properties of the mounted system .    in the present paper",
    ", we investigate the critical behaviour of the two - dimensional ising lattice model defined on a curved surface with a constant negative curvature .",
    "monte carlo ( mc ) simulations and finite - size scaling analyses are employed to compute the critical exponent @xmath0 for the zero - field magnetic susceptibility and @xmath1 for the correlation volume .",
    "we demonstrate that the values of both @xmath0 and @xmath1 deviate from those for the planar ising lattice model , which indicates the relevance of the intrinsic geometry of the underlying surface to the critical properties of the mounted ising model .",
    "moreover , when reducing the boundary contributions , the values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 exhibit a tendency to shift to those derived from the mean - field approximation .",
    "this non - trivial behavior of the critical exponents is qualitatively consistent with the conclusion based on the series expansion analyses @xcite and that deduced from the quantum field theory @xcite .",
    "we also calculate the fourth - order binder s cumulant that provides a check of the results of finite size scaling .",
    "let us briefly review the framework of the scaling argument that successfully explains the critical properties of the two - dimensional planar ising lattice model @xcite .",
    "the scaling hypothesis states that , in the vicinity of the critical temperature @xmath2 , the singular part of the free energy @xmath3 of the ising lattice per site should be a homogeneous function : @xmath4 where @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 represents an external magnetic field .",
    "the parameter @xmath8 with a spatial dimension @xmath9 indicates the rescaling of the total number of sites from @xmath10 to @xmath11 ; this results from the transformation of the linear dimension of the entire ising lattice : @xmath12 . by eliminating @xmath13 from ( [ eq_01 ] ) , we obtain the scaling relation of @xmath3 : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a universal scaling function",
    ". the appropriate differentiation of ( [ eq_02 ] ) yields the power - law form of thermodynamic quantities such as the zero - field susceptibility @xmath16 , where the critical exponents are expressed as functions of @xmath17 and @xmath18 ( for instance , @xmath19 )",
    ".    equation ( [ eq_01 ] ) is justified when the ising lattice is defined on a flat plane , since the rescaling of @xmath20 by @xmath13 is equivalent to that of @xmath10 by @xmath8 .",
    "however , this is not the case when the ising lattice is defined on a curved surface ; while a wide range of regular lattices can be constructed on curved surfaces with a constant gaussian curvature @xcite , the relation @xmath21 become invalid for these lattices due to the differences in the metric of the underlying geometry .",
    "hence , the rescaling @xmath12 does not imply @xmath22 , which requires some modifications of ( [ eq_01 ] ) .",
    "we thus introduce an alternative rescaling parameter @xmath23 for considering the scaling relation of the ising model on curved surfaces : @xmath24 where @xmath23 represents the rescaling of total sites @xmath25 .",
    "when the underlying geometry of the lattice is flat , the relation ( [ eq_03 ] ) reduces to ( [ eq_01 ] ) since @xmath26 . in this case , the parameters @xmath27 and @xmath28 given in ( [ eq_03 ] ) are defined as @xmath29 and @xmath30 , thus yielding identical values of critical exponents ( for instance , @xmath31 ) .",
    "in contrast , when the underlying geometry is curved , @xmath23 can be no longer expressed as a power of @xmath13 ; thus , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are not related to @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "consequently , the critical exponents for the latter model , which are determined by @xmath27 and @xmath28 , may quantitatively differ from those for the planar ising lattice .",
    "this naturally motivates us to evaluate the critical exponent directly by constructing the ising lattice model on curved surfaces .",
    "in this figure . all heptagons depicted within the circle are congruent with respect to the metric given in eq .",
    "( [ eqa_03 ] ) .",
    "the circumference corresponds to an infinite distance from the center of the circle.,width=188 ]    a simple spherical surface seems to be the optimal geometry to consider the curvature effect on the critical properties of the ising model .",
    "in fact , a number of efforts have been preformed on the ising model with lattices whose topology is equivalent to a spherical surface @xcite .",
    "it is noted that , however , the thermodynamic limit can not be considered for the closed form of sphere - like surfaces having _ positive _ curvature while maintaining their finite curvature .",
    "this is because a spherical surface reduces to a flat plane in this limit , where the curvature effect vanishes completely .",
    "therefore , instead of a sphere , we consider a curved surface with _ negative _ constant curvature , termed _ a pseudosphere _ @xcite .",
    "the pseudosphere is a simply connected infinite surface in which the gaussian curvature at arbitrary points possesses a constant negative value .",
    "( the definition of the pseudosphere will be given in appendix . )",
    "hence , it serves as a suitable geometry for considering the curvature effect on the critical properties of a system .",

    "this is achieved by a tessellation procedure , where the entire surface is covered by non - overlapping regular polygons meeting only along complete edges or at vertices .",
    "it is known that a regular tessellation of the pseudosphere with @xmath34 regular @xmath35-sided polygons meeting at each vertex satisfies the following property : @xcite @xmath36 hence , the series of integer sets @xmath37 satisfying ( [ eq_04 ] ) results in an infinite number of possible regular tessellations of a pseudosphere .",
    "this is in contrast to the case of a flat plane , where only three regular tessellations are allowed : @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 satisfying the condition @xmath41 . for simplicity",
    ", we adopted a heptagonal @xmath42 tessellation to construct the ising lattice on a pseudosphere .",
    "figure 1 illustrates the local bond structure of a regular heptagonal lattice in terms of the poincar disk representation .",
    "the resulting lattice comprises concentric layers of congruent heptagons surrounding a central heptagon .",
    "the ising lattice models embedded on a pseudosphere have been considered thus far @xcite ; however , explicit temperature dependences of thermodynamics quantities close to the transition are yet to be concerned .    due to a peculiar metric of a pseudosphere , the total number of sites @xmath10 of our heptagonal lattice exhibit a non - trivial evolution behaviour with the increase in the lattice size",
    ". the size of our lattice is determined by the number of concentric layers of heptagons , denoted by @xmath32 , which effectively serves as a linear dimension in our lattice . for a given @xmath32 ,",

    "; this means that @xmath10 rapidly increases with @xmath32 in comparison with the case of the planar ising model .",
    "the exponential increase in @xmath46 is a manifestation of the constant negative curvature of the underlying geometry of our lattice .",
    "it should be noted that , when considering thermodynamic properties of our lattice , careful treatments on boundary effects are required .",
    "the exponential increase in @xmath46 results in that the ratio @xmath47/n(r)$ ] approaches a non - zero constant @xmath48 in the limit @xmath49 .",
    "this means that the boundaries of our lattices can not be neglected even in the thermodynamic limit , but contain a finite fraction of the total sites .",
    "boundary effects coming from these sites are difficult to be eliminated completely , because the periodic boundary conditions are hard to be employed to regular lattices assigned on a pseudosphere .    in order to extract the bulk critical phenomena ,",
    "therefore , we have followed the procedure mentioned below .",
    "suppose that an ising lattice consists of @xmath50 concentric layers of heptagons .",
    "then , for computing physical quantities of the system ( magnetic susceptibilities , for instance ) , we take into account only the ising spins involved in the interior @xmath51 layers ( @xmath52 ) so as to reduce the contribution of the spins locating near the boundary . in actual calculations ,",

    "the susceptibility for a finite system size can be expressed as a function of the order parameter @xmath59 as @xmath64 or alternatively , @xmath65 despite the difference in their definitions , both @xmath62 and @xmath66 yield the same critical exponent @xmath0 by the finite - size scaling method , as described in ref @xcite .",

    "the energetically preferable configurations of the vector spins differ from those in planar systems @xcite , which implies that the critical behaviour of these vector - spin lattice models is markedly influenced by a finite surface curvature .",
    "further noteworthy is , however , the fact that the geometric curvature continues to be relevant to the critical behavior of the system despite the omission of the vector property of the interacting spin variables ; this was demonstrated by our results .",
    "evidently , the spin variable of our model is set to be a scalar , and thus the ising hamiltonian given by ( [ eq_05 ] ) is devoid of the metric factor .",
    "nevertheless , the surface curvature is surely relevant to the ising model on curved surfaces since it enables to construct peculiar lattice structures that can not be realize in a flat plane .",
    "this means that the surface curvature induces the alteration of the global symmetry of the system even when the interacting entities do not exhibit any vector property .",
    "besides , in the vicinity of the critical point , the discreteness of the lattice becomes irrelevant and the model can be considered to be a continuum surface with a constant curvature .",
    "therefore , the metric of the underlying geometry plays a crucial role in the scaling behaviour of the ising lattice model defined on the surface . in this context , the mean - field nature of the critical exponents @xmath0 and @xmath1 are expected to be universal for all lattice structures other than the heptagonal one ; this point is being investigated .",
    "we remark that it is also interesting to study the dependence of the values of the bulk critical exponents on the interior lattice size @xmath51 we have introduced . obviously , the condition @xmath170 is desirable to determine the bulk properties of the lattice with accuracy . if the @xmath51 is not so large ( compared to the curvature radius of the underlying surface ) , the system can be regarded as an ising lattice defined on a nearly flat surface .",
    "thereby , the resultant critical exponents will become comparable with those for the planar ising lattice rather than the true bulk critical exponents ( i.e. , the mean - field exponents ) .",
    "this implies that , by gradually increasing the size of @xmath51 , the system go through a crossover from the planar ising class to the mean - field class .",
    "we conjecture that this crossover phenomenon is observed in the shift of the asymptotic value of @xmath0 deduced from the plot in figure [ fig_5 ] ( a ) ; that is , when increasing the size of @xmath32 employed in the analyses , the asymptotic value of @xmath0 at @xmath171 will shift downward from @xmath172 to @xmath173 .",
    "accordingly , it is possible that the curve of @xmath0 plotted in figure [ fig_5 ] ( a ) converges to an intermediate value between @xmath124 and @xmath112 under the present numerical conditions .    in conclusion",
    ", we have investigated the critical behaviour of the ising model defined on a curved surface with constant negative curvature .",
    "mc simulations and finite - size scaling analyses were employed to compute the critical exponent @xmath0 and @xmath1 for the zero - field magnetic susceptibility and correlation volume , respectively .",
    "the resulting values @xmath0 and @xmath1 show distinct values from those for the planar ising model , and exhibit a tendency to the mean - field exponents @xmath137 and @xmath132 due to the peculiar intrinsic geometry of the negatively curved surface .",
    "as well , we have revealed quantitatively how the boundary spins contribute to the determination of @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , and argued the possibility to occur the crossover from the planar ising class to the mean - field ising class .",
    "we hope that the generalization our statistical model ( with regard to the lattice structure , dimensionality of the embedding space , distribution of interacting strength , _ etc . _ ) would unveil a wide variety of interacting critical properties of the physical systems assigned on general curved spaces .",
    "we thank t.  nakayama and k.  yakubo for useful discussions .",
    "this work was supported in part by a grant  in ",
    "aid for scientific research from the japan ministry of education , science , sports and culture .",
    "one of the authors ( hs ) is thankful for the financial support from the 21st century coe ",
    "topological sciences and technologies , \" and for the conversation with s.  tanda , y.  asano , and k.  konno .",
    "numerical calculations were performed in part on the supercomputer center , issp , university of tokyo .",
    "the pseudosphere is defined as one sheet of the double - sheeted hyperboloid @xcite @xmath174 possessing the minkowskian metric @xmath175 . since ( [ eqa_01 ] )",
    "specifies the locus of points whose squared distance from the origin are equal to @xmath176 , it is called a _",
    "pseudo_sphere having the radius @xmath177 by analogy with the sphere .    while the above definition is rigorous , it is clumsy for computations since three coordinates are used for only two degrees of freedom .",
    "this cumbrousness is removed by using an alternative representation of the pseudosphere , called the poincar disk model @xcite .",
    "suppose that the upper hyperboloid sheet is projected onto the @xmath17-@xmath18 plane using the following mapping : @xmath178 this transforms the upper sheet to a unit circle endowed with the metric @xmath179 the unit circle possessing the metric ( [ eqa_03 ] ) is referred to as a poincar disk , and it serves as a compact representation of the pseudosphere .",
    "the boundary of the disk corresponds to the points at infinity of the hyperboloid .",
    "the gaussian curvature @xmath180 on the disk is calculated using the formula : @xmath181 from ( [ eqa_03 ] ) and ( [ eqa_04 ] ) , we see that @xmath182 at arbitrary points on the disk .",
    "thus it follows that the pseudosphere is a curved surface with a constant negative curvature @xmath182 .",
