    "this has ended with the commissioning of the _ far - ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer _",
    "( fuse ) , a facility that has been specially designed to cover wavelengths from 905 to 1187    with an efficient 2-dimensional detector .",
    "the spectroscopic capabilities of fuse and its in - flight performance are discussed by moos et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and sahnow et al .",
    "this paper reports on initial fuse results for absorption in the galactic halo .",
    "the spectral integrations with fuse were obtained in the time - tagged photon address mode between september and december 1999 .",
    "the observations were obtained with the objects centered in the large 30@xmath1230  aperture of the lif1 channel and generally extended over spacecraft night and day .",
    "most of the effective area in the @xmath111031.93 , 1037.62 wavelength region is provided by the spectra obtained with the lif channels .",
    "we have restricted our analysis to the observations in the lif1 channel .",
    "to produce the final composite spectra in the region of , we followed the basic data handling procedures discussed by sembach et al .",
    "the spectra have a velocity resolution of approximately 25kms@xmath13  ( fwhm ) .",
    "the zero point of the wavelength scale in the vicinity of the lines was determined with reference to nearby h@xmath14 lines or and lines .",
    "sample fuse spectra extending from 1020 to 1045     for ton  s210 and pg  0804 + 761 are shown in figure 1 .",
    "the weaker @xmath15 line is near strong absorption by @xmath16 @xmath17 and the h@xmath14 ( 50 ) r(1 ) and p(1 ) lines at 1037.15 and 1038.16   .",
    "the stronger @xmath18 line is usually relatively free of blending with other species since the nearby h@xmath14 ( 60 ) r(3 ) and r(4 ) lines at 1031.19 and 1032.36    are often weak and well - separated in velocity from ( @xmath19 = 214 and + 125 kms@xmath13 , respectively ) . blending from the hd ( 60 ) r(0 ) and r(1 )",
    "lines at 1031.93 and 1032.36  is not a problem because the amount of molecular gas along these sight lines is small ( shull et al .",
    "2000 ) . for most paths through the galactic halo ,",
    "the contamination of the @xmath15 line is severe .",
    "therefore , we concentrate our attention on the @xmath18 line in this letter and use the @xmath15 line only to evaluate possible saturation in the @xmath18 absorption .",
    "the @xmath18 absorption is sufficiently broad that it is nearly fully resolved by fuse .",
    "therefore , we converted the observed absorption line profiles into measures of apparent column density per unit velocity , n@xmath20(@xmath21 ) , through the relation n@xmath22 [ ions  @xmath23 ( kms@xmath13)@xmath13 ] = @xmath25 @xmath26=3.768@xmath1210@xmath27 @xmath28 , where @xmath29=0.133 is the oscillator strength of the @xmath18 line ( morton 1991 ) , @xmath0 is the wavelength in  , and @xmath30(@xmath21 ) is the apparent absorption optical depth ( see savage & sembach 1991 ) .",

    ", we find the same values of @xmath1n@xmath20(@xmath21 ) near maximum absorption as those obtained for the stronger @xmath01031.93 line .",
    "therefore , there is no evidence for unresolved saturated structure in the absorption .",
    "values of the integrated apparent column density are given in table  1 along with errors including statistical and continuum placement uncertainties ( sembach & savage 1992 ) .",
    "column densities and equivalent widths were integrated over the velocity range spanned by @xmath31 to @xmath32 as listed in table  1 .",
    "the absorption profiles illustrated in figure 1 and in sembach et al .",
    "( 2000 ) are often complex and trace a wide range of phenomena in or near the milky way .",
    "those portions of the profiles between approximately 100 and + 100 kms@xmath13are likely tracing gas in the thick halo of the milky way , which is the primary subject of this paper .",
    "however , an inspection of the profiles reveals high velocity ( 100 @xmath33 300 kms@xmath13  ) absorption toward 7 of the 12 objects : mrk  876 , mrk  509 , pks  2155 - 304 , h  1821 + 643 , ngc  7469 , ton  s180 , and ton  s210 .",
    "sembach et al .",
    "( 2000 ) discuss the properties and possible origins of this high velocity absorption .",
    "we comment on one case here .",
    "the absorption toward h  1821 + 653 reveals local gas at @xmath21 = 0 , gas above the perseus spiral arm at @xmath21 = 70 kms@xmath13 , and gas in the outer warped region of the outer milky way at @xmath21 = 120 kms@xmath13  ( oegerle et al . 2000 ) . in calculating the column densities listed in table 1 ,",
    "the velocity limits were set to exclude high velocity except for h  1821 + 643 , where the value of n ( ) includes the outer galaxy gas absorption extending to @xmath21 = 160 kms@xmath13 .",
    "this high velocity absorption is likely produced by differential galactic rotation , which causes the absorption to extend to large negative velocities .",
    "total column densities of through the galactic halo coupled with estimates of the mid - plane space density of , @xmath4 , can be used to obtain information about the stratification of away from the plane of the galaxy .",
    "we assume an exponential gas stratification with @xmath34 = @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the scale height .",
    "it then follows that the column density perpendicular to the plane for an object with latitude @xmath37 is given by n()@xmath38 = @xmath39 , where n ( ) is the line - of - sight column density to an object at a distance @xmath40 away from the plane . for extragalactic objects , where @xmath41 , n()@xmath38 = @xmath42 .",
    "values of @xmath1[n()@xmath38 ] toward 11 extragalactic objects observed by fuse are listed in table  1 along with the orfeus value for 3c  273 from hurwitz et al .",
    "the large value ( 14.80 ) for the 3c  273 sight line is likely a consequence passing through radio loops i and iv and the north polar spur .",
    "such structures are local examples of the regions that likely feed hot gas into the halo .",
    "since the 3c  273 sight line is a special case , we do not include it in our synthesis of general conclusions below . without 3c  273 ,",
    "the median @xmath1[n()@xmath38 ] in our sample is 14.21 with a spread of 0.4 dex .",
    "the irregular nature of the distribution is highlighted by the low value of 13.80 found toward vii  zw118 which lies @xmath44 degrees from pg  0804 + 761 and has @xmath1[n()@xmath38 ] = 14.21 .",
    "these irregularities must be considered when estimating the scale height .    from the _ copernicus _",
    "observations of absorption toward hot stars , jenkins ( 1978b ) estimated a mid - plane density @xmath4 = @xmath45 @xmath6 .",
    "however , that estimate assumed a small scale height ( 0.3 kpc ) for the absorbing layer , based on the limited data available at the time .",
    "we now find that the scale height must be about 10 times larger .",
    "accordingly , we have obtained a new estimate of @xmath4 from the _ copernicus _ survey that is appropriate for a large scale height absorbing layer with h @xmath46 2 kpc .",
    "the result is @xmath4 = @xmath47n ( ) / @xmath47@xmath48 = @xmath49 @xmath6 , where the reduced distance @xmath48 = @xmath36[@xmath50@xmath51 , compensates for the small reduction in density away from the galactic plane .",
    "this value for @xmath4 was obtained when all of the upper limits for the _ copernicus _ column densities were included at their stated values . if zero is substituted for these cases , a value of @xmath4 that is only 5% lower is obtained .",
    "this value of @xmath4 has not been adjusted to allow for the fact what we live in the local bubble .",
    "shelton & cox ( 1994 ) have reanalyzed the _ copernicus _",
    "measurements and have estimated that the mid - plane density beyond the local bubble is @xmath4 = @xmath52 @xmath6 for an absorbing layer with h @xmath8 3 kpc .",
    "for an mid - plane density of @xmath49 @xmath6 , we obtain the scale heights listed in table  1 from the simple relation h = n()@xmath53 . ignoring 3c  273",
    ", the values range from 1.0 to 7.0 kpc .",
    "we find median and average values of 2.6 and 2.9 kpc , respectively . in deriving this average and in the subsequent calculations we treat the upper limit for pg  0052 + 251 as a detection .",
    "if we adopt the shelton & cox ( 1994 ) mid - plane density estimate of @xmath54 @xmath6 and reduce the extragalactic column densities by @xmath55 @xmath23 to remove the local bubble contribution , we obtain median and average scale heights of 3.5 and 4.0 kpc .",
    "our incomplete knowledge of the mid - plane density introduces a 35% systematic uncertainty in the derivation of the scale height .",
    "another source of uncertainty involves the irregular distribution of the gas .",
    "edgar & savage ( 1989 ) devised an analysis procedure for estimating scale heights that accounts for the irregular distribution .",
    "the analysis includes a logarithmic patchiness parameter , @xmath56 , that is added in quadrature to the observed logarithmic errors in the column densities .",
    "the value of @xmath56 is varied until the minimized reduced chi square , @xmath57(min ) , of the scale height fit is acceptable . using n@xmath58 = @xmath49 @xmath6 and the 11 fuse values of n ( ) sin@xmath9b@xmath9 , we obtain @xmath57(min ) = 1.0 for h = 2.7 kpc and @xmath56 = 0.21 dex . adopting this value of @xmath56",
    ", we can then estimate the 1@xmath59 error in the scale height by determining the values of h where @xmath60 = @xmath60(min ) + 1.0 .",
    "the final result is h ( ) = 2.7@xmath70.4 kpc , where the listed 1@xmath59 errors do not include the additional 35% systematic uncertainty caused by the uncertain mid - plane density and local bubble correction .",
    "the scale height of 2.7@xmath70.4 kpc can be compared with the values of h = 5.1@xmath70.7 , 4.4@xmath70.6 , and 3.9@xmath71.4 kpc for , , and , respectively , determined by savage et al .",
    "( 1997 ) from hst and iue observations .",
    "the more confined distributions of and compared to are also apparent in plots of n()/n ( ) and n()/n ( ) versus @xmath40 toward objects in the disk and halo of the galaxy . in each case",
    "there is a clear increase in the ratio from the disk to the halo , suggesting that is more extended than and . for the ratio increases by about a factor of 2 from low to high @xmath40 ( see fig .",
    "6d in savage et al .",
    "spitzer ( 1996 ) noted that the value of n()/ n ( ) increases from @xmath80.15 in the disk to 0.9 for objects in the low halo with @xmath61 1.5 kpc .",
    "values of n ( ) have been measured using hst for mrk  509 , pks  2155 - 304 , 3c  273 , h  1821 + 643 , and eso  141 - 55 by savage et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and by sembach et al .",
    "( 1999 ) . combining",
    "these with the values of n ( ) from table 1 , we obtain n()/n ( ) = 0.58 , 0.63 , 0.45 , 0.63 and 1.74 , respectively , for the five extragalactic objects . the increase in this ratio by about a factor of 4 from the disk to the typical extragalactic halo sight line implies a large change in the ionization state of the highly ionized gas as a function of distance from the galactic plane .",
    "a major goal of the fuse program is to map out the distribution of in the disk and halo of the galaxy .",
    "once we obtain fuse observations for a substantial number of disk and halo stars and for additional extragalactic objects it will be possible to improve on our intitial estimate of the extension of into the galactic halo .",
    "these future studies will allow us to determine if a plane parallel , exponentially stratified , and patchy layer is indeed the most appropriate description of the distribution of .",
    "strong absorption toward 10 of 11 extragalactic objects observed by fuse implies the widespread existence of hot gas in the halo of the milky way as predicted by spitzer ( 1956 ) and also supported by the earlier observations of and with iue and hst . the decreasing scale heights in the sequence , , , to provides information about the changing ionization state of the gas with distance from the galactic plane .",
    "differences from element to element in the destructive liberation of atoms from dust grains could also influence the relative behavior of the z distributions of the highly ionized atoms .",
    "reviews of the many theories for the origins of the highly ionized atoms in the ism are found in spitzer ( 1990,1996 ) and sembach , savage , & tripp ( 1997 ) .",
    "the three primary types of theories involve conductive heating ( ch ) where cool gas evaporates into an adjacent hot medium , radiative cooling ( rc ) where hot gas cools as it flows into the halo or down onto the disk , and turbulent mixing layers ( tml ) where hot and cool gas are mixed through turbulent entrainment ( slavin , shull , & begelman 1993 ) .",
    "table  2 of spitzer ( 1996 ) provides a summary of the many models along with the references to the theoretical literature .",
    "the different models make specific predictions for the expected values of n()/n ( ) .",
    "the ch models are compatible with the value of n()/n ( ) @xmath8 0.15 found at low @xmath40 , while the larger values of @xmath80.6 found toward the extragalactic objects observed by fuse are better explained by a combination of the rc and tml models .",
    "shull & slavin ( 1994 ) developed a hybrid model for the highly ionized gas in the galactic halo in order to explain the smaller scale height of compared to and suggested by the iue and hst observations available in 1994 . in their model the highly ionized ions at low @xmath40 are produced mainly in isolated snrs while those at high @xmath40 are mainly found in radiatively cooling superbubbles that break through the disk producing rayleigh - taylor instabilities and turbulent mixing layers .",
    "possible support for the origin of the high ions at low @xmath40 in isolated snrs follows from the detailed snr modeling of shelton ( 1998 ) .",
    "confirmation that the scale height difference ( smaller scale heights for ions with higher ionization potentials ) first seen for and is also clearly present in the new fuse measurements suggests that such hybrid models offer substantial promise for explaining the origin of the highly ionized species in the galactic halo .",
    "another example of a hybrid model is that of ito & ikeuchi ( 1988 ) which includes the cooling gas of a galactic fountain flow ( shapiro & field 1976 ) to provide the hot collisionally ionized gas and photoionization from the extragalactic background ( hartquist , pettini , & tallant 1984 ; fransson & chevalier 1985 ) to assist in the production of and .",
    "the ionizing photons might also be provided by hot white dwarfs ( dupree & raymond 1983 ) .",
    "the new observations with fuse imply several processes may be required to achieve a more complete understanding of the origins of the low density highly ionized gas extending away from the galactic plane .",
