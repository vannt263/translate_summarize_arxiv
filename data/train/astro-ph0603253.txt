    "the evolution and eventual dispersal of discs around young stars is an important area of study , for theories of both star and planet formation .",
    "it is now well - established that at an age of @xmath2yr most stars are surrounded by discs that are optically thick at optical and infrared wavelengths ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and typically have masses of a few percent of a solar mass ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however at an age of @xmath3yr most stars are not seen to have discs , suggesting that disc lifetimes are typically a few myr ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "how stars lose their discs remains an unsolved question .",
    "observations of t tauri stars ( tts ) in the infrared and at millimetre wavelengths detect few objects intermediate between the disc - bearing classical t tauri ( ctt ) and disc - less weak - lined t tauri ( wtt ) states @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the transition from ctt to wtt is very rapid , with the dispersal time estimated to be @xmath4yr @xcite .",
    "moreover the simultaneous decline is disc emission across a wide range in wavelength suggests that the dispersal is essentially simultaneous across the entire radial extent of the disc .",
    "this `` two - time - scale '' behaviour is inconsistent with conventional models of disc evolution , which predict power - law declines in the disc and therefore predict dispersal times comparable to the disc lifetimes @xcite .",
    "however it has been shown that models which combine photoevaporation of the disc material with viscous evolution can reproduce this two - time - scale behaviour @xcite .",
    "models of so - called photoevaporative disc winds were first suggested at least 20 years ago ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however the first models which treated the flow and radiative transfer in a fully self - consistent manner were reported by @xcite and @xcite , and then extended in depth by @xcite .",
    "further studies have extended the study of the details in a number of ways ( e.g.  the effects of dust , @xcite ; the inclusion of external radiation fields and non - ionizing uv radiation , @xcite ; detailed numerical hydrodynamics , @xcite ) , but the underlying principles remain the same . ionizing radiation from the central star produces a hot ionized layer on the surface of the disc , with conditions akin to an hii region .",
    "near to the star the ionized gas remains bound to the disc , but outside some critical radius ( known as the gravitational radius and denoted by @xmath5 ) the ionized layer becomes unbound and flows from the disc surface as a wind .",
    "for solar - mass stars such as tts the gravitational radius is typically a few au . for a constant ionizing flux",
    "@xmath6 the wind rate is constant , as long as the disc remains optically thick to ionizing photons perpendicular to the plane of the disc .",
    "furthermore the diffuse ( recombination ) radiation field is the dominant source of ionizations at all radii of interest , which is much smaller than @xmath5 for parameters typical of tts . ] . in their `` weak - wind '' case , applicable to tts",
    ", @xcite found that the mass - loss rate due to photoevaporation is given by @xmath7 more recently , hydrodynamic modelling of a photoevaporative wind has resulted in slight modification of this result . when hydrodynamic effect are considered the `` effective @xmath5 '' is reduced by a factor of 5 @xcite , and the mass - loss rate is reduced by a factor of around 3 @xcite .",
    "however the qualitative behaviour is unchanged from that of @xcite .",
    "the so - called `` uv - switch '' model of @xcite couples a photoevaporative wind to a simple disc evolution model . at early times",
    "the accretion rate through the disc is much larger than the wind rate , and the wind has a negligible effect .",
    "however at late times photoevaporation becomes important , depriving the disc of resupply inside @xmath5 . at this point",
    "the inner disc drains on its own , short , viscous time - scale , giving a dispersal time much shorter than the disc lifetime .",
    "a number of similar studies have now been conducted @xcite , and this class of models shows a number of attractive properties .",
    "however @xcite highlighted two key problems with the model .",
    "firstly , the model requires that tts produce a rather large ionizing flux ( of order @xmath8 ionizing photons per second ) , and secondly that the outer disc , beyond @xmath5 is dispersed much too slowly to satisfy millimetre observations of tt discs .",
    "we have previously shown that it is reasonable to treat tt chromospheres as having a constant ionizing flux in the range @xmath9@xmath10s@xmath11 @xcite .",
    "we now seek to address the `` outer disc problem '' by highlighting a flaw in the original uv - switch model .",
    "the photoevaporative wind models described above are based on the premise that the disc is optically thick to lyman continuum photons at all radii .",
    "consequently the diffuse ( recombination ) radiation field is the dominant source of ionizing photons at large radii @xcite , and drives the photoevaporative wind .",
    "however once the inner disc is drained it becomes optically thin to lyman continuum photons , eliminating this diffuse field and rendering the simple wind prescription used above invalid . instead ,",
    "once the inner disc has drained we must consider direct ionization of the inner edge of the disc .",
    "@xcite neglect this process , and find that the time - scale for dispersal of the outer disc is limited by the time material takes to diffuse inward to @xmath5 ( as the most of the mass - loss occurs close to @xmath5 ) .",
    "further , the @xmath12 dependence of the wind profile at large radii @xcite means that the mass - loss rate due to photoevaporation decreases significantly with time as the inner edge of the disc moves outward .",
    "consequently the dispersal of the outer disc occurs on the viscous time - scale of the _ outer _ disc , and thus the outer disc is dispersed in a time comparable to the disc lifetime , much too slowly to satisfy observational constraints .",
    "we suggest that photoevaporation by the direct radiation field results in a dispersal time significantly shorter than that predicted by @xcite , and now seek to model the effects of this process on the evolution of the outer disc .    in this paper we model the photoevaporative wind produced by the direct field .",
    "in section [ sec : analytic_models ] we present an analytic treatment of the problem , highlighting the important physical processes . in section [ sec : hydro_models ] we extend our analysis by using numerical hydrodynamics , and describe the numerical simulations we have performed . in section [ sec : res ] we present our results , and show that the wind profile is well - matched by a simple analytic form . in section [ sec : disc ] we discuss the caveats that apply to our modelling , as well as the consequences of our results for disc evolution models , and in section [ sec : summary ] we summarize our conclusions .",
    "we consider the effects of our results on disc evolution models in detail in a companion paper ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper ii ) .",
    "we now consider the problem which we refer to as `` direct photoevaporation '' . as discussed above , after the inner - disc draining of the uv - switch model the inner disc becomes optically thin to lyman continuum photons , and so we must consider the influence of the direct radiation field rather than the diffuse field considered previously .",
    "we note that while the uv - switch model shows that the gas in the inner disc will become optically thin to ionizing radiation , some dust opacity may remain after the time at which the inner gas disc drains .",
    "an detailed treatment of gas - grain dynamics is beyond the scope of this work , but we will consider this issue qualitatively in the discussion ( section [ sec : disc ] ) .",
    "we expect similar physics to apply in the case of the direct field as in the diffuse field case , with the ionizing radiation creating a thin ionized layer on the surface of the disc ( see fig.[fig : direct_schematic ] ) .",
    "however the disc is truncated at some inner radius such that the ionized layer is unbound , and flows away from the surface as a disc wind .",
    "additionally , at the inner edge any flow perpendicular to the disc surface will move inward and so some material may be accreted on to the star ( although it must presumably lose angular momentum to do so ) .",
    "obviously this is a complicated dynamic process , and in the next section we use numerical hydrodynamics to model the dynamics of direct photoevaporation .",
    "however we first seek a theoretical framework in which to place these hydrodynamic models .    in order to study the problem of direct photoevaporation",
    "analytically we use a similar approach to that adopted by @xcite .",
    "we assume that the mass - loss per unit area from the disc at a given point is given by @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the density at the base of the region layer and @xmath15 is the sound speed of the ionized gas .",
    "consequently the density at the at the base of the ionized region is critical to the determination of the photoevaporative wind .",
    "we solve for the number density at the base of the ionized region ( i.e.  at the ionization front ) as follows .",
    "we neglect recombinations between the source and the disc surface , and assume that the location of ionization front is determined by ionization balance only .",
    "we also assume azimuthal symmetry , and integrate over the azimuthal coordinate throughout . consequently ,",
    "along any given line - of - sight from the source the rate of recombinations , @xmath16 , in a volume @xmath17 at the ionization front must balance the rate of ionizing photons absorbed at the front , @xmath18 . a column with polar angle @xmath19 and angular size",
    "@xmath20 has a total area equal to @xmath21 , so for an ionizing flux @xmath6 the ionization rate at the front is for spherical coordinates and @xmath22 for cylindrical .",
    "thus upper - case @xmath23 always represents cylindrical radius , while lower - case @xmath24 denotes spherical radius .",
    "] @xmath25 the geometry of the problem is shown in fig.[fig : geom_fig ] .",
    "we have assumed that at the ionization front we have ionization balance within some volume @xmath17 .",
    "perturbations to the disc structure on a length - scale shorter than the disc scale - height @xmath26 are unlikely to be dynamically stable ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so we assume that @xmath17 has a thickness ( perpendicular to the front ) that is equal to the disc scale - height @xmath26 .",
    "we verify this assumption _ a posteriori _ in section [ sec : inner_edge ] .",
    "consequently @xmath17 is given by @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the angle between the ray - path and the ionization front ( see fig.[fig : geom_fig ] ) .",
    "the spherical radius @xmath24 is related to the cylindrical radius @xmath23 by @xmath29 , and so the recombination rate is @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the number density at the ionization front and @xmath32 is the hydrogen recombination coefficient .",
    "if we equate the ionization and recombination rates and re - arrange we find that @xmath33 in general , therefore , the density at the ionization front at a given radius @xmath23 depends on the geometry of the ionization front .",
    "this in turn depends of the density structure of the unperturbed disc , and the form of the density profile does not permit exact analytic solutions",
    ". however we can look at the behaviour of the density in specific cases .",
    "for example , along the midplane ( @xmath34 ) we expect the ionization front to be perpendicular to the line - of - sight to the source , and so @xmath35 . in most discs",
    "@xmath26 is an increasing function of @xmath23 , and at radii beyond the inner disc edge we have @xmath36 and @xmath37 , so @xmath31 falls off more steeply than @xmath38 the exact profile of the base density is determined by the geometry of the ionization front , which must be evaluated numerically .",
    "however before we consider numerical modelling of the wind it is instructive to frame the problem in terms of known parameters and unknown scaling constants .",
    "we note at this point that the form we have derived for @xmath31 ( equation [ eq : base_den ] ) is qualitatively similar to the `` strong wind '' solution derived by @xcite . in this case",
    "a strong stellar wind modifies the disc structure out to a radius beyond @xmath5 , `` driving down '' the disc atmosphere and enabling radiation to penetrate to lower heights above the disc midplane at larger radii .",
    "consequently the @xmath39 scaling , which applies only to the inner disc in the weak - wind case , extends well beyond @xmath5 in the presence of a strong stellar wind .",
    "such a wind is not found for tts , and instead this case is more readily applicable to o- and b - type stars .",
    "however the geometry of the radiative transfer problem is similar to that considered here , with a similar lack of a disc atmosphere at small radii .",
    "the numerical scaling will differ , as even in the strong wind case the diffuse field still dominates , but we expect the form of the mass loss due to the direct field to be qualitatively similar to that derived by @xcite for the case of a strong stellar wind .      following @xcite , we evaluate the wind mass - loss rate per unit area as @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the mean molecular weight of the gas , @xmath42 is the mass of a hydrogen atom , and the factor of 2 accounts for mass - loss from both sides of the disc . the launch velocity @xmath43 is of order the sound speed of the ionized gas . for the moment we make the simplifying assumption that at the inner disc edge @xmath17 has a radial thickness comparable to the vertical scale - height . as noted above , along the midplane we have @xmath44 , and so the inner edge density @xmath45 can be expressed as @xmath46 where @xmath1 is the radius of the inner disc edge and @xmath47 is an order - of - unity scaling constant .",
    "we further assume that the base density @xmath31 ( equation [ eq : base_den ] ) can be related to the inner edge density @xmath45 by a dimensionless shape function @xmath48 , which depends on the disc structure ( and therefore depends on the form of @xmath26 ) .",
    "therefore @xmath49 and the launch velocity can be written as @xmath50 here @xmath51 is another order - of - unity scaling constant and @xmath52 km s@xmath11 is the sound speed of the ionized gas .",
    "therefore the mass - loss profile takes the form @xmath53 the total mass - loss rate is found by integrating this from @xmath1 to some outer radius @xmath54 : @xmath55 substituting for @xmath45 from equation [ eq : n_in ] and integrating gives @xmath56 typically , for tt discs , @xmath57 .",
    "further , if we assume that the integral converges as @xmath58 ( i.e.  that the form of @xmath59 falls off faster than @xmath60 ) , then we see that the mass - loss rate from the wind scales as @xmath0 . consequently we expect the mass - loss rate to increase as the inner edge of the disc evolves outwards .",
    "if we re - scale in terms of parameters typical of tts ( taking @xmath61 ) , we find @xmath62 as noted earlier , the shape function @xmath59 depends on both the radial density profile and the form of @xmath26 .",
    "we expect a profile that falls off faster than @xmath38 , but require numerical solution in order to determine the exact form of @xmath59",
    ". moreover we must also determine the scaling constants @xmath47 and @xmath51 numerically , so we turn to numerical simulations in order to pursue this problem further .",
    "in this section we construct and evaluate hydrodynamic models of the disc wind produced by direct photoevaporation .",
    "we first describe the computational method used to investigate the problem and the simulations used to study the behaviour of the wind .",
    "we then present our results , which are framed in terms of the scaling parameters described above , before discussing the various caveats which apply to the models .      to investigate the dynamics of direct photoevaporation we use the two - dimensional ( 2-d ) grid - based hydrodynamics code zeus2d @xcite .",
    "zeus2d uses operator splitting to integrate the hydrodynamic equations forward in time .",
    "each equation is split into parts , which are then evaluated consecutively using the results from the previous evaluation .",
    "further splitting is done between the two grid directions , with the order alternating on consecutive timesteps .",
    "the hydrodynamic equations are split into source and transport terms .",
    "the source terms are evaluated first , and the new values are then transported by computing fluxes across cell faces .",
    "the form of this computation makes it relatively straightforward to add heating due to ionizing radiation , as it is easy to update the local energy at the end of each timestep , before subsequent evaluation of the source terms .",
    "zeus2d provides several alternative options for the interpolation scheme and artificial viscosity .",
    "we adopt the standard van leer ( second - order ) interpolation scheme , and the standard von neumann & richtmyer form for the artificial viscosity ( with @xmath63 ) . in evaluating the timestep",
    "we adopt a courant number of 0.4 .",
    "additionally , we adopt the ideal gas equation of state @xmath64 throughout , where @xmath65 is gas pressure , @xmath66 is energy density ( per unit volume ) , rather than the more conventional energy per unit mass . here",
    "@xmath66 is equal to the quantity denoted by `` @xmath67 '' in most hydrodynamic texts .",
    "] , and @xmath68 is the adiabatic exponent .      in order to model the effects of ionizing radiation in zeus2d it is necessary to simplify the radiative transfer problem , as it is not practical to make a full radiative transfer calculation at each timestep . in order to solve the problem",
    "we assume that the only significant heat source is the absorption of lyman continuum photons , and that the only significant coolant is the re - emission of such photons by radiative recombination .",
    "consequently the problem of evaluating the heating and cooling due to radiation is reduced to a problem of computing ionization balance .",
    "we assume that the gas is either extremely optically thick to ionizing photons produced by recombination , in which case they are absorbed locally ( case b recombination ) , or assume that the gas is extremely optically thin to recombination photons , in which case they escape from the system ( case a ) .",
    "consequently recombination photons can be neglected in the computation of ionization balance .",
    "this approximation ( specifically the assumption of local absorption ) is known as the `` on - the - spot '' ( henceforth ots ) approximation . where the ots approximation is not valid is the case where ionizing photons produced by recombinations travel some distance before being re - absorbed .",
    "we discuss the validity of the ots approximation _ a posteriori _ in section [ sec : disc ] .    in order to model the effects of a central ionizing source",
    "we have added two routines to the code .",
    "these routines require that a polar [ i.e.  @xmath69 coordinate grid is used , so that the radial columns represent ray paths from the central source .",
    "the first routine is performed at the end of each timestep ( i.e.  after the transport step ) , and solves for ionization balance along each ray path in order to find the location of the ionization front .",
    "it then sets a flag array to indicate whether cells should be ionized , neutral or `` boundary '' . to do this we solve the equation of ionization balance along each radial grid column ( denoted by subscript @xmath70 ) @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the total number of ionized atoms in the along the @xmath73th radial grid column , @xmath32 the recombination rate coefficient , @xmath74 the particle number density at cell @xmath75 , and @xmath76 ( @xmath77 ) the cell volume .",
    "the term @xmath78 is the fraction of cell @xmath75 which is ionized , and is set to unity for ionized cells or zero for neutral cells . in `` boundary '' cells",
    "it has an intermediate value ( see equation [ eq : f ] below ) .",
    "the particle number density is obtained from the mass density by assuming that the gas is entirely neutral hydrogen : @xmath79 ( i.e.  @xmath80 ) . essentially the first term on the right - hand side is the number of ionizations per unit time in grid column @xmath73 , and the second term is the number of recombinations per unit time .",
    "thus the change in the number of ionized atoms in a single timestep of length @xmath81 is @xmath82 having evaluated this number we evaluate the updated number of ionized atoms along the column to be @xmath83 we then evaluate the number of atoms enclosed at a given radius @xmath84 along the @xmath73th column as @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the inner grid radius . if @xmath87 then the cell is flagged as `` ionized '' , and if @xmath88 then the cell is flagged as `` neutral '' .",
    "the cell along each ray path where equality is reached is flagged as the `` boundary cell '' .",
    "in this cell we evaluate the fraction , @xmath78 , of the cell which must be ionized so that @xmath89 : @xmath90 in addition , a check is performed to ensure that the recombination time - scale at each grid cell which is `` ionized '' , @xmath91 , is much longer than the dynamic timestep . as long as this condition",
    "is not violated we can safely neglect radiative cooling of the ionized gas .",
    "the density of the ionized material is sufficiently small that this is not a concern in any of our simulations .    following this",
    "we have added another subroutine , which adjusts the energy of the gas according to the values the ionization flags calculated as above .",
    "`` ionized '' gas is treated as isothermal with a sound speed of 10kms@xmath11 , `` neutral '' gas is left unchanged .",
    "thus at each cell the energy is adjusted as follows : @xmath92 where @xmath93kms@xmath11 , and the sound speed in the boundary cell @xmath94 is evaluated as @xmath95 in this manner the energy in the boundary cells is evaluated is as the weighted mean of the `` cold '' and `` hot '' energies .",
    "@xmath96 is evaluated as @xmath97 on the timestep when a cell first becomes partially `` ionized '' .",
    "the values of @xmath78 and @xmath94 are carried to the following timestep so that this value can be recovered from equation [ eq : c_bc ] if the ionization front remains in the same cell for one or more timesteps .",
    "lastly , in order to increase the performance of the code we have parallelised it , for a shared - memory architecture , using the openmp formalism . tests showed that the numerical results were identical to those obtained from running the code on a single processor , and that the parallelisation is around 8590% efficient when running on 4 processors .      to test the accuracy of this algorithm we consider the well - studied case of an hii region expanding into a uniform gas cloud of number density @xmath98 .",
    "this problem has a well - known 1-d analytic solution , first studied by @xcite .",
    "if an ionization front expands spherically into a uniform gas cloud of density @xmath98 , then the radius of the ionization front @xmath99 at time @xmath100 is @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the strmgren radius @xmath103    here @xmath104 is the case b recombination coefficient for atomic hydrogen at @xmath105k , which has a value of @xmath106@xmath107s@xmath11 @xcite .",
    "we use a @xmath108 cell grid covering the range @xmath109 $ ] and @xmath110 $ ] .",
    "our modified version of zeus2d solves this problem numerically , and a comparison between the analytic and numerical solutions is shown in fig.[fig : spittest ] .",
    "the code reproduces both the initial strmgren radius and the power - law rise well , accurate at the @xmath111% level .",
    "runs at higher resolution do not change the results significantly , indicating that the procedure is numerically converged .",
    "we note however that this is not a particularly stringent test of the code for the conditions we wish to model , as ionization of a disc means that the density profile rises exponentially along ray paths .",
    "consequently we expect the ionization front to remain in a single grid cell for many more timesteps in a disc simulation than in this test , and the treatment of the boundary cell is the primary uncertainty in the computational algorithm .",
    "however in a spherical geometry the expansion of an hii region into a cloud with such a steeply rising density profile would naturally be rayleigh - taylor unstable , so this problem can not be used to test the code . in short ,",
    "we find that our code performs well when considering the expansion of an hii region into a uniform density cloud , but note also that this is not an especially good test for the problem at hand .      in order to model direct photoevaporation",
    "it is necessary to set up a stable disc configuration in zeus2d .",
    "we neglect magnetic fields , disc self - gravity and radiation hydrodynamics ( these options are turned off in the code ) and adopt an @xmath112 grid covering a polar angle of @xmath110 $ ] ( i.e.  assuming symmetry and simulating only one quadrant of the disc ) . the rotation option in the code , which introduces a centrifugal `` pseudo - force '' is turned on , and accelerations due to gravity are evaluated using only a point mass placed at the origin .",
    "the ionization subroutines are included , but initially the ionizing flux is set to zero so that they have no effect .",
    "both the upper and lower angular boundaries are set to be reflective in order to account for the symmetry of the problem , and both the inner and outer radial boundaries are set as `` outflow '' boundaries .",
    "we address the influence of these boundary conditions later ( see section [ sec : numerics ] ) .    to determine initial conditions we use a 1-d reference model of the form described by ( * ?",
    "* see also paper ii ) .",
    "we use the updated wind profile of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* kindly provided in numerical form by ian mccarthy ) rather than the original profile of @xcite used by @xcite .",
    "we expect direct photoevaporation to become significant once the inner disc is drained , so we run the 1-d evolution model to the point where the inner disc ( inside the draining radius ) becomes optically think to ionizing photons .",
    "the reference model has an ionizing flux of @xmath113s@xmath11 , an initial disc mass of @xmath114m@xmath115 , and an initial accretion rate @xmath116m@xmath115yr@xmath11 . at the point",
    "when the inner disc is drained ( at an age of 11.1myr ) the disc has a total mass of 0.001m@xmath115 , and in order to remove numerical fluctuations we use a functional fit to the density profile at this point .",
    "the functional fit to the midplane density takes the form @xmath117 this is a @xmath118 decline at large radii , with a cutoff at radii close to some inner edge radius @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath119 is consistent with a @xmath120 surface density and constant @xmath121 .",
    "this profile peaks at a radius @xmath122 , with the parameters related by @xmath123 thus @xmath1 is the inner truncation radius and @xmath122 the radius at which the midplane density peaks .",
    "fitting this profile to the reference model gives @xmath124au and @xmath125au , and therefore @xmath126 .",
    "consequently the input parameters to the disc model are as follows : @xmath127 ( stellar mass ) , @xmath128 ( surface density at @xmath129 ) , @xmath1 , @xmath122 , @xmath121 and ionizing flux @xmath6 .",
    "the initial disc structure is obtained from these parameters as follows .",
    "the reference midplane density @xmath130 is evaluated as @xmath131 where the scale height at @xmath122 is @xmath132 .",
    "this fixes the constant of proportionality demanded in equation [ eq : func_form ] , and the cutoff index @xmath133 is evaluated as specified in equation [ eq : n_index ] .",
    "consequently , at every point on the @xmath112 grid the mass density and energy density are set thus and @xmath134 . ] : @xmath135 and @xmath136 the functional form is undefined for @xmath137 , and so the density and energy are set to a constant , small value in this region .",
    "( we use a value that is @xmath138 times the maximum value . )",
    "the radial and polar velocities are set to zero .",
    "the rotational velocity is set to the keplerian value , with small corrections made to balance the radial pressure gradient arising from the choice of density profile .    throughout our simulations",
    "we adopt a grid which is linearly - spaced in both @xmath24 and @xmath19 .",
    "there are computational advantages to using logarithmic spacing in @xmath24 ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in particular the fact that the grid cells can all be approximately square ( i.e.  @xmath139 ) . however a logarithmic grid naturally concentrates the highest resolution close to the inner boundary , while we seek to place the inner disc edge at larger radius .",
    "also , our simulations do not cover a large dynamic range in radius ( typically only around one order of magnitude ) .",
    "consequently we find that a logarithmic grid requires significantly more grid cells than a linear one in order to achieve the same resolution at the inner disc edge , resulting in significantly larger cpu requirements , so we adopt a linear grid throughout .      [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in order to study the wind profiles produced by the model we conducted the profile series of simulations .",
    "these simulations cover a large radial range , enabling the study of the wind profile over a wider range of radii than possible with the higher resolution edge simulations .",
    "the method adopted to analyse the results of these simulations was to study the mass outflow rate across given radial shells at each timestep . at radii outside the inner disc edge",
    "the outflowing ionized mass through a shell of constant @xmath24 comes from the disc surface inside a cylindrical radius @xmath140 ( where @xmath141 is the angular coordinate of the ionization front ) .",
    "consequently by sampling @xmath142 at many radii it is possible to study the mass - loss profile @xmath143 .    in order to study the simulations in more detail we compared our analytic prediction for @xmath144 ( derived in section [ sec : analytic_models ] ) with the values obtained from the simulation . in general",
    "we find that a power - law form for the shape function @xmath145 provides a good fit to the profile , although the values of @xmath146 varies for different values of @xmath121 ( i.e.  we fit a different shape function for different @xmath121 ) .",

    "our procedure for fitting these parameters is as follows .    at each timestep",
    "we evaluate @xmath144 at a large number of different radii on the grid .",
    "the mass outflow rate is evaluated as @xmath150 in the ionized region . here",
    "@xmath151 is the radial component of the fluid velocity at cell @xmath75 , the last term represents the area of the outer radial surface of each cell , and the initial factor of 2 accounts for flow from both sides of the disc .",
    "the smallest value of @xmath84 used was 0.5au larger than the inner edge radius at that timestep , and we do not evaluate @xmath152 in the region where the outer boundary becomes significant ( the outer 10% of the grid for most models , but somewhat larger where @xmath153 ) .",
    "we then solve for the values of @xmath146 and @xmath149 which give the best - fit to a straight line in the @xmath144/@xmath154 $ ] plane .",
    "these values fluctuate somewhat with time , but by studying a large number of timesteps it is possible to obtain best - fitting values . in each case",
    "it is necessary to wait until the simulation stabilises before studying the mass - loss profile : typically this takes around one outer orbital time .",
    "the evolution of the parameters with time for the profile1 simulation are shown in fig.[fig : mdot_params ] , and the mean values of the constants for each simulation are shown in table [ tab : mdot_params ] .",
    "in general we find that a single power - law index and a single normalisation constant provide a good fit to the mass - loss profile for fixed @xmath121 .",
    "for @xmath155 the best - fitting values are @xmath156 and @xmath157 : examples of this fit are shown in fig.[fig : mdot_fits ] .",
    "the single value obtained confirms that the mass - loss rate scales as @xmath158 , which in turn confirms that the flow is `` recombination - limited '' ( see * ? ? ?",
    "note also that this value of @xmath149 is consistent with @xmath159 , as estimated from the inner edge density , if @xmath160 .",
    "this suggests that the typical launch velocity is around 0.4 times the sound speed , a value consistent with numerical simulations of the photoevaporative wind driven by the diffuse radiation field @xcite .",
    "however the power - law index is rather sensitive to the value of @xmath121 , as seen in table [ tab : mdot_params ] .",
    "this is not entirely surprising , as the disc density decreases exponentially with @xmath161 , meaning that the density at which ionization balance occurs is rather sensitive to the disc thickness .",
    "this obviously has a knock - on effect for the integrated mass - loss rates , with thicker discs resulting is less efficient mass - loss at radii beyond the inner disc edge .",
    "however while the shape of the mass - loss profile in terms of @xmath143 varies significantly with the value of @xmath121 , the effect on the integrated mass - loss rate is not especially strong .",
    "this is illustrated in fig.[fig : hr_mdot ] , which shows the best - fitting mass - loss profiles for three different values of @xmath121 .",
    "larger values of @xmath121 result in mass - loss profiles which are rather more concentrated towards the inner disc edge , but the total integrated mass - loss rates differ only by a factor of 23 .",
    "in order to construct these models we have made a number of simplifications and approximations , and now seek to address their significance .",
    "the most important of these is the use of the on - the - spot ( ots ) approximation to simplify the radiative transfer problem . throughout the simulations we have adopted case b recombination coefficient , which has a value of @xmath162@xmath107s@xmath11 @xcite . adopting the case a value ( @xmath163@xmath107s@xmath11 ) has a negligible effect on the results , as the density in the ionization balance equation depends on @xmath164 .",
    "however we must also consider the possibility that recombination photons can be absorbed non - locally : were this to be significant the ots approximation would fail . in the simulations the ionized region is always optically thin to ionizing photons .",
    "( in fact , the density in the ionized region is sufficiently low that it would not be optically thick to ionizing photons even if the gas were entirely neutral . ) similarly , the density in the cold disc is sufficiently large that the mean free path of an ionizing photon is always much smaller than the length of a grid cell .",
    "consequently , if we consider recombinations at a given point on the front we see that any photons emitted in an upward direction escape the system , whereas any photons emitted downwards are absorbed locally . if we look at the geometry of the ionization front ( see figs .  [",
    "fig : snapshot ] & [ fig : sonic_surfs ] ) , we see that the front approaches the line - of - sight from the source asymptotically at large radii . therefore there is only a very small solid angle which permits recombination photons to be absorbed elsewhere along the front , and their influence is negligible by comparison to the direct field .",
    "consequently we are satisfied that the ots approximation is valid for this geometry .",
    "a further simplification related to the the use of the ots approximation is that recombination photons produced in the flow region are similarly neglected .",
    "this diffuse field is the field that drives the disc wind in the models of @xcite , and so by comparison to their work it is possible to estimate its contribution .",
    "@xcite found that the diffuse field produces around 10% of the flux of the direct field in the static region . here",
    "the diffuse field must come from ionized material that is flowing away from the disc , and so may be somewhat less efficient than in the static case .",
    "however if we neglect the motion of the flow it seems that neglecting the diffuse field produced by recombinations in the flow results in our model under - estimating the radiation field at the front by around 10% .",
    "we suggest , however , that a more detailed radiative transfer calculation is needed in order to confirm this .",
    "we note that both of the simplifications of the ots approximation result in our model under - estimating the ionizing flux at the ionization front , and therefore suggest that our mass - loss rates can be considered as lower - limits to the true mass - loss rates due to direct photoevaporation .",
    "moreover the wind rate scales as @xmath158 , and so a small increase in the effective value of @xmath6 does not have a strong influence on the total mass - loss rate .",
    "the second simplification we have made is the equation of state adopted in the `` boundary '' cells ( equations [ eq : eos ] & [ eq : c_bc ] ) .",
    "this approximation may be significant , as the treatment of the boundary cell can have a significant effect on the flow solution . as mentioned above",
    ", we treat the boundary cells in such a way that any material flowing `` laterally '' is assumed to be neutral . in practice the pressure gradients across the ionization front are upwards , from `` neutral '' to `` ionized '' , and so this should predict the correct behaviour .",
    "however with no model with which to compare our results it is difficult to quantify the accuracy of this approximation . as seen in section [",
    "sec : spitzer_test ] , comparison to the spitzer solution suggests an accuracy of around 5% , but we also note this is not an especially good test of the code s applicability to the direct photoevaporation problem .",
    "comparison of our results with independently obtained solution in the future will be a valuable test of the accuracy of the code .    as noted in section [ sec : analytic_models ] , our model neglects any possible dust opacity between the star and the inner disc edge .",
    "the presence of dust in the `` inner hole '' could attenuate the flux of ionizing photons reaching the disc , and consequently reduce the wind rate produced by direct photoevaporation .",
    "however it is not clear whether or not the viscous accretion of the inner gas disc will also remove the dust , and a detailed treatment of the gas - grain dynamics during the transition phase is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "some insight can be gained from the work of @xcite , which considers the differential motions of dust and gas in a simple photoevaporating disc model .",
    "in general they find that dust is rapidly accreted with the gas when the inner disc drains , but there is a complicated dependence on the various model parameters .",
    "the results of @xcite therefore suggest that the effect of dust opacity in the inner part of the disc will be small , but we note that this issue warrants further study .    as seen above , the mass - loss profiles obtained by the model are rather sensitive to the disc scale - height .",
    "we note also that real tt discs are expected to show significant `` flaring '' ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and are not generally consistent with a constant @xmath121 ratio . a flaring disc would show a slower decrease in the incidence term @xmath165 ( equation [ eq : base_den ] ) with @xmath23 than a disc with constant @xmath121 .",
    "consequently a flaring disc is expected to show greater mass - loss at large radii than seen in our models .",
    "however once again this suggests that our models provide a robust lower - limit to the mass - loss rates produced by direct photoevaporation .",
    "lastly , it is instructive to compare the mass - loss profile we obtain to that predicted by diffuse photoevaporation . in the diffuse model",
    "the wind profile takes the form @xmath166 with the profile normalised at @xmath5 regardless of the instantaneous location of the inner disc edge @xcite .",
    "therefore as the inner disc edge moves outward to @xmath167 , the integrated mass - loss rate decreases significantly .",
    "however when direct photoevaporation is considered we find that while the decline in the radial power - law is similar ( for @xmath155 ) , the profile is instead normalised at the instantaneous inner disc edge ( see equation [ eq : prof_form ] ) . as discussed in section [ sec : analytic_models ] , the form of the direct wind is qualitativelty similar to that found by @xcite for the case of a strong stellar wind .",
    "this form results in a significantly larger @xmath168 as the inner disc edge evolves outwards , as the integrated mass - loss rate scales with @xmath0 ( equation [ eq : mout_anal ] ) .",
    "additionally , the more effective radiative transfer in the case of direct photoevaporation results in a mass - loss rate that is larger than that expected in the diffuse case , by a factor of @xmath11110 at @xmath169 .",
    "therefore we expect that direct photoevaporation is much more efficient than diffuse photoevaporation in dispersing the outer part of the disc .",
    "this provides a possible solution to the `` outer disc problem '' of the original uv - switch model @xcite .",
    "we explore the effect of this modified mass - loss profile on the evolution of tt discs in a companion paper ( paper ii ) .",
    "we have highlighted a significant flaw in disc evolution models which incorporate photoevaporation , namely that such models neglect the direct radiation field after the inner disc has been drained .",
    "we have modelled the photoevaporative wind produced by the direct field , firstly using a simple analytic treatment and then using detailed numerical hydrodynamics .",
    "our models show that once the inner disc has drained the wind due to the direct field dominates over that due to the diffuse field .",
    "the presence of such a wind leads to a significantly faster dispersal of the outer disc than seen in existing models of disc photoevaporation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as the integrated mass - loss rate scales with @xmath0 as @xmath1 grows ( cf .",
    "@xmath170 in the diffuse case , @xcite ) .",
    "we suggest that this may be a solution to the `` outer disc problem '' in these models .",
    "our analysis results in a simple form for the mass - loss due to direct photoevaporation , and we explore the effects of this wind on models of disc evolution in a companion paper ( paper ii ) .",
