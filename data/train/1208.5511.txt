    "the scattering poles or resonances of @xmath10 are defined as the poles of this meromorphic continuation and they enjoy interesting interpretations and properties .",
    "the real part of a resonance corresponds to a frequency of a resonant wave , and the imaginary part , to the decay rate of the wave .",

    "[ fig : pfr ]     resonance free regions near the real axis have been extensively studied since the work of lax - phillips @xcite and vainberg @xcite where the presence of such regions was linked to propagation of singularities for the wave equation , and hence to the geometry of the obstacle @xmath19 .",
