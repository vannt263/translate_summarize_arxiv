    "since galileo discovered that objects of any weight and composition fall toward the earth at the same rate , the equivalence principle has played an important role in most of the theories of gravity .",
    "einstein formulated the general relativity based on the acceleration equivalence principle .",
    "as a consequence , a phenomenon observed in an accelerated system might also be observed in a gravitational field , e.g. hawking radiation and unruh radiation@xcite .",
    "there is no doubt that gravity and acceleration share common physical features . but galileo s original observation that objects of any weight and composition respond to gravity equally is still subject to questioning .",
    "it is known that an accelerated charged particle radiates away energy through the larmor radiation .",
    "this implies that a charged particle will emit radiation under gravitational acceleration and its trajectory is not going to be the same as a neutral particle s .",
    "the charged particle s equation of motion satisfies abraham - lorentz - dirac equation in curved spacetime instead of the simple geodesic path @xcite .",
    "since the free falling objects trajectories depend on their charges , galileo s original idea must be modified .",
    "however , most of the falling objects are not charged .",
    "so far only accelerated charged particles were studied in this context @xcite . however ,",
    "if the composite particle is neutral , the individual charges cancel out .",
    "it is still not clear whether a neutral composite object follows a trajectory different from the geodesic path .",
    "it is also unknown whether a neutral composite object radiates away energy , since the radiation might allow an observer to reconstruct the distribution of matter which made a black hole@xcite .    to study this question , we first note that a charged particle is different from a neutral particle , because it radiates away electromagnetic fields . therefore if one can study radiation , then he could reconstruct the distribution of matter in a composite object .",
    "similar problem has been studied in the synchrotron radiation theoretically and experimentally@xcite . in general ,",
    "electrons are accelerated in groups in a synchrotron .",
    "it is found that each electron radiates away electromagnetic field as a single charged particle if the radiation wavelength is shorter than the distance between electrons in the electron bundle . this is called decoherent radiation . charged particles in that case",
    "are independent from each other and must be treated independently . however , if the electromagnetic field s wavelength is longer than the size of the electron bundle , the radiation is the same as a single charged particle with charge @xmath0 ( @xmath1 is the number of electrons ) .",
    "the radiation is highly enhanced and is called coherent radiation .    based on the coherent radiation theory , radiation from a neutral composite object is highly suppressed for long wavelength mode , because the object must be treated as a coherent single object .",
    "but the object can radiate away short wavelength modes , because these modes are radiated by all the components independently .",
    "we study this coherent radiation and decoherent radiation with the use of an interference function @xmath2 . if @xmath3 , the radiation is coherent .",
    "we find that whether the radiation is coherent or decoherent depends on the object s size .",
    "for a charged particle pair with distance @xmath4 , the critical energy is @xmath5 . for a hydrogen atom ( its radius is about @xmath6 )",
    "the critical energy is @xmath7 .",
    "we compare an accelerated hydrogen atom s electromagnetic radiation to its gravitational radiation , while the atom is in a circular orbit around a star with mass equal to @xmath8 , and find that the gravitational radiation is stronger than the electromagnetic radiation if its orbital radius is larger than some critical radius . in the following we introduce the coherent radiation theory and use a charged particle pair as a simple example .",
    "then we calculate the hydrogen atom s interference function .",
    "it is known that an accelerated charged particle radiates away energy , which is called larmor radiation .",
    "its intensity distribution is @xcite    @xmath9    here @xmath10 is the velocity of light ( @xmath11 ) , @xmath12 is the direction from the charged particle to an observer at infinity , @xmath13 is the location of the particle .",
    "@xmath14 is the energy of the particle , @xmath15 is the particle s charge , and @xmath16 is the solid angle .",
    "we set @xmath17 . in general",
    ", an object is made of several particles which have their own charges .",
    "the radiation comes from each charged particle    @xmath18    @xmath19 , @xmath20 is the charge density .",
    "each particle s radiation interferes with radiation from other partcles .",
    "the object s center of mass is at @xmath21 .",
    "@xmath13 can be transfered to the center of mass frame , @xmath22 , with the relation @xmath23 .",
    "then the radiation can be written as@xcite    @xmath24    equation [ rad2 ] is similar to a single particle larmor radiation multiplied by an interference factor @xmath2 . therefore ,",
    "if @xmath2 is obtained , then the radiation is known . in the following ,",
    "we will focus on calculating @xmath2 .",
    "the simplest composite object is made of a charged particle pair .",
    "we assume that there is one particle with charge @xmath25 located at @xmath26 , and another particle with charge @xmath27 located at @xmath28 in the center of mass frame ( as in fig .",
    "[ two ] ) .",
    "the center of mass is located at @xmath21 . while in general particles",
    "may be free to move with respect to each other , we calculate only instantaneous radiation and keep the structure fixed .",

    "the interference function @xmath2 is @xmath30    this is the same as double slit interference with phase difference @xmath31 .",
    "if the observer is at @xmath32 , modes with @xmath33 cancel out each other and @xmath34 .",
    "the interference pattern appears for @xmath35 ( fig .",

    "while @xmath14 is large enough , a detector will not be able to pick up the oscillation pattern and it will record only the average effect . on average , the intensity is @xmath39 .",
    "this value is what one expects from two independent charged particles .",
    "therefore even though the object s total charge is @xmath36 , the high energy radiation is the same as the radiation from two independent particles .    , as a function of @xmath14 . for low @xmath14 ,",
    "radiation from these two particles is coherent and cancel out each other .",

    "it becomes equal to @xmath40 . for a finite size detector",
    ", one will not be able to distinguish the oscillations and it is as if the radiation is coming from two independent charged particles.,width=226 ]    for an observer at different location , the interference can be described by the angle @xmath41 . again",
    "the interference function , @xmath2 , is canceled out for @xmath33 and the interference pattern appears while @xmath42(fig .",

    "a neutral atom has no net charge . at first glimpse",
    "it seems that an accelerated atom will not radiate any electromagnetic wave .",
    "however , since an atom has its own structure , its high @xmath14 radiation should not canceled out . this can be tested by calculating the interference function @xmath2 . to make it simple",
    ", we will focus on the simplest atom , hydrogen .",
    "a hydrogen has a proton in the center and an electron circulating around it .",
    "the acceleration will distort the hydrogen s wavefunction @xcite . here",

    "@xmath54    an electron has a negative charge and a proton has a positive charge , so the total charge distribution is    @xmath55    .",
    "since the larger @xmath56 state has a larger radius , radiation becomes decoherent for much smaller @xmath14 .",
    "since all of the 4 quantum states are spherically symmetric , the observer s direction does not affect the interference pattern .",

    "the higher @xmath56 states become decoherent at lower @xmath14 than the lower @xmath56 states did , because the higher @xmath56 states have larger radii .",
    "however , the decoherent radiation is not a combination of the proton and electron .",
    "the electron s radiation is canceled out by itself , because of its own density distribution .",
    "only the proton s radiation is left .",
    "the atom radiates high @xmath14 modes as if it is a single proton .",
    "if the acceleration does not change very quick , there will not be much high frequency radiation ( @xmath60 as @xmath61 ) . in that case",
    "we find the ground state s @xmath62 is    @xmath63    in a low @xmath14 approximation    @xmath64    we consider non - relativistic approximation . the velocity is much lower than the speed of light , @xmath65 .",

    "it is known that an accelerated particle also radiates away gravitational waves .",
    "a freely falling composite object may radiate both gravitational waves and electromagnetic waves . to simplify the case , we study a composite particle under the gravitational influence of a heavy object with mass @xmath73 .",
    "we consider a circular orbit .",
    "then the average power of gravitational radiation over one period of the motion is @xcite    @xmath74    here @xmath75 is the orbital radius and @xmath50 is the composite particle s mass . in this study",
    "we assume that the composite particle is a hydrogen atom in his ground state .",
    "the orbital angular frequency is @xmath76 .",
    "the composite particle s electromagnetic radiation can be found from equation [ t - rad ] , @xmath77    one can compare equation [ radiation_gravity ] with equation [ radiation_em ] . the gravitational radiation is stronger than the electromagnetic radiation if its orbital radius is larger than the critical radius ,    @xmath78    if the heavy object is of the sun s mass ( @xmath79 ) , the critical radius is @xmath80 .",
    "this is much smaller than the sun s radius .",
    "therefore , in the sun s case , most a freely falling hydrogen atom still radiates away much more gravitational than electromagnetic energy .",
    "however , this may change for a very massive and compact object .",
    "we studied the decoherent larmor radiation from a neutral object which is made of charged particles .",
    "this radiation depends on the object s structure . for a charged particle pair separated by the distance @xmath4 , the characteristic energy is @xmath81 .",
    "the object s low @xmath14 radiation ( @xmath82 ) must be treated as if it is coming from a single object and radiation is highly suppressed .",
    "the object s high @xmath14 modes ( @xmath83 ) must be treated as if they are coming from independent particles .",
    "they are radiated decoherently .",
    "the same argument is applied to the hydrogen atom .",
    "a hydrogen atom s radius is about @xmath6 .",
    "its characteristic energy is @xmath7 .",
    "the @xmath84 modes are highly suppressed , because the charged particles radiate coherently .",
    "the @xmath83 modes are radiated decoherently and one can treat the electron and proton independently . however , at this energy scale electrons can not be treated as single independent particles .",
    "electron s radiation is canceled out because of electron s charge density distribution .",
    "the high @xmath14 modes are mainly from the proton .",
    "the radiation is similar to the radiation from a single charged particle , instead of the radiation from two charged particles .",
    "if the acceleration does not change very quickly , the high @xmath14 radiation is weak . in this case",
    "the total radiation depends on the third time derivative of velocity ( equation [ t - rad ] ) .",
    "an accelerated neutral atom emits not only electromagnetic waves but also gravitational waves .",
    "both of these processes are highly suppressed .",
    "the electromagnetic radiation is suppressed by charge cancellation , while the gravitational radiation is suppressed by the weak gravitational coupling .",
    "we compare these two types of radiations for a hydrogen atom orbiting a star of solar mass .",
    "we find the gravitational radiation is much stronger than the electromagnetic radiation if orbital radius is larger than @xmath80 .",
    "this result shows that an accelerated particle will radiate energy according to its structure .",
    "this radiation may be highly suppressed , because of the constituent particles interference , but it is not fully canceled out .",
    "therefore if we drop two objects with different internal structures in a gravitational field , these two objects will radiate away different amounts of energy and will fall at a different rate .",
    "the strong equivalence principle which states that gravitational motion does not depend on an object s constitution must be revised .",
    "it is also possible to reconstruct the falling matter s internal structure through the radiation@xcite .",
