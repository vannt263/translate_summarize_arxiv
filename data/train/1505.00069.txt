    "one of the cornerstones of quantum field theories and general relativity is lorentz invariance , which is assumed to be an exact symmetry .",
    "there is a lot of remarkably strong experimental support for this idea @xcite , with no violation detected .",
    "nevertheless , certain quantum - gravity theories possess mechanisms that can lead to lorentz violation @xcite , in which effects arising from modifications of space - time are expected to appear at distances of the order of the planck length .",
    "this has attracted considerable attention in recent years both from the experimental and theoretical perspectives , given that , in principle , this would allow a better understanding about the space - time structure .",
    "the standard model extension ( sme ) performed by kostelecky et al .",
    "@xcite is a framework where lorentz violation is motivated via spontaneous symmetry breaking ( ssb ) , in which non - dynamical tensor fields are now added to general relativity and the standard model and whose fixed directions induce the corresponding symmetry breaking in a given reference frame .",
    "these tensor fields are assumed to arise from non zero vacuum expectation values of some basic fields belonging to a more fundamental model , such as string theory @xcite . considering the sme as a framework motivated from a ssb ,",
    "the goldstone theorem ensures that massless particles will emerge @xcite .",
    "bjorken proposed that the photon can be a goldstone mode associated with the ssb of lorentz invariance @xcite .",
    "however , since the pure - photon sector of the sme is @xmath2 gauge invariant , all particles are massless , and an alternative interpretation of the goldstone theorem is required @xcite .",
    "in fact , in the spontaneously broken space - time symmetries case , the counting of massless modes has to be done carefully @xcite , and it may happen that one to six goldstone modes appear , each corresponding to one of the six lorentz generators .",
    "the properties of goldstone modes are , in general , model dependent and the knowledge of the fundamental theory is required to do a complete description . in the case of the sme some general conclusions about goldstone modes have been obtained in @xcite .",
    "the pure - photon sector of the sme includes the usual maxwell term plus the presence of the cpt - odd term ( @xmath3 ) , sometimes called the carroll - field - jackiw term @xcite , and the cpt - even term @xmath4 .",
    "both terms have been extensively studied in the literature @xcite , and experimental constraints exist for them @xcite .",
    "the search for new effects arising from these lorentz violating terms , and an improvement of the bounds for the magnitude of these coefficients constitute two of the main lines of study .",
    "the study of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) offers an opportunity to test the pure - photon sector of the sme at finite temperature @xcite , since the propagation of light would be affected , in the form of non - standard dispersion relations , polarization , birefringence properties , among other effects @xcite .",
    "as it may be expected , thermodynamic properties and the spectral distribution can be modified as well . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the partition function in the functional integral formalism was calculated in order to study the finite temperature behavior of the carroll - field - jackiw term , for the case of a purely spacelike background . in ref .",
    "@xcite the study was extend to the cpt - even term for particular configurations of the coefficients @xmath1 , to simplify the calculations . in both cases , lorentz violation corrections to the blackbody radiation and anisotropy in the angular distribution for the energy density were found .",
    "it remains unclear , however , if there is no information loss from the consideration of only a few particular configurations .",
    "the goal of this paper is to study the finite temperature properties of the cpt - even pure - photon sector of the sme in the most general case , following a scheme similar to that employed in @xcite .",
    "the outline of this work is the following . in section [ modelo ] the cpt - even pure - photon sector of the sme lagrangian is introduced and some properties are reviewed .",
    "following dirac s scheme for constrained systems , the hamiltonian analysis is performed , and the canonical quantization is carried out . in section [ functionpart ]",
    "the partition function is evaluated in the functional formalism and some thermodynamical properties are derived , a substantial improvement over the previous calculations is reported considering an arbitrary configuration for the @xmath1 coefficients .",
    "we compare the result with a classical thermodynamic approach .",

    "we focus on the pure - photon sector , and particularly on the cpt - even violating terms within the minimal sme .",
    "the lagrangian density is given by @xmath5 where the first term corresponds to the standard electrodynamics , being @xmath6 the electromagnetic stress tensor .",
    "the second term introduces lorentz - cpt symmetry breakdown , which is controlled by the non - dynamical spacetime - constant and dimensionless quantities @xmath1 ; these coefficients have the symmetries of the riemann tensor and a vanishing double trace , which imply a total of 19 independent components . the tensor @xmath1 is alternatively parametrized in terms of four @xmath7 matrices @xcite , @xmath8 , defined by @xmath9 the matrices @xmath10 and @xmath11 contain together @xmath12 independent components , while @xmath13 and @xmath14 possess together @xmath15 components , which encompass the @xmath16 independent elements of the tensor @xmath1 .",

    "we will use this second parametrization to express our main results .",

    "gauss law ( [ gausslaw ] ) is different from its standard electrodynamics form , being this even more evident when it is rewritten in terms of the electric and magnetic fields instead of the canonical momenta @xmath54 . in order to construct a quantum theory via canonical quantization ( @xmath55 $ ] )",
    ", we must remove the extra degrees of freedom .",
    "this means that we have to impose as many suitable gauge constraints  by hand \" as there are first class constraints ; these gauge constraints have to be admissible and convert the first class constraints into second class constraints , and then we can introduce the dirac brackets to perform the correct quantization .",
