    "[ fig : multipoles3ov2 ] we show the individual multipole fields for the state with transverse spin @xmath155 .      in this section",
    "we examine the sea quark dependence of the magnetic moment , radii and the quadrupole moment .",
    "they are extracted by fitting the @xmath10-dependence of the form factors to a dipole form . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : chiral ] the sea quark mass dependence is consistent with a constant for all quantities confirming that sea quark effects are small . in particular , the value of the magnetic form factor at @xmath129 is consistent with experiment . on the other hand extrapolating the magnetic moment",
    "we obtain the value given in table  [ resultstable ] .",
    "this is 5% smaller than experiment which is to be expected given the larger value of the strange quark mass .",
    "the reason is that the mass of the @xmath2 is 5% larger than experiment and this will affect the value of the magnetic moment when we convert to nuclear magnetons . in the fits for the magnetic moment and radii we did not include the results obtained in the hybrid action because of the small finite @xmath41 effects observed . given the large statistical errors on quadrupole moment such small finite-@xmath41 effects are negligible and therefore , in this case , we include the result using the hybrid action to obtain the extract the value at the physical point . in table",
    "[ resultstable ] we give the values that we find at the physical point for the radii and the dipole and quadrupole moments of the transverse charge density obtained from eq .",

    "the point shown by the filled square is the value extracted from the fit at the physical pion mass . in all cases except for the quadrupole moment",
    "the results using the hybrid action are excluded form the fit . ]",
    "by utilizing properly constructed sequential sources the dominant @xmath2 electromagnetic form factors @xmath109 and @xmath106 are calculated with good accuracy using dynamical domain - wall fermion configurations as well as a hybrid action .",
    "in addition , we extract the magnetic moment of the @xmath2 by fitting the magnetic dipole form factor @xmath106 to a two - parameter dipole form . we find a value that is within errors to the experimentally measured value  @xcite .",
    "the electric charge and magnetic radii ( @xmath162 and @xmath163 ) are computed and like the magnetic dipole moment they do not show sea quark dependence in the range of masses studied in this work .    finally , the subdominant electric quadrupole form factor @xmath107 is computed for the first time in an unquenched lattice calculation to sufficient accuracy to exclude a zero value .",
    "this has been accomplished by constructing an appropriate sink that isolates it from the two dominant form factors .",
    "we find consistent results with dwf and using a hybrid action .",
    "the positive non - zero values of @xmath107 at @xmath129 suggest that the structure of the @xmath2 baryon is non - spherical . in the light - front frame",
    "we find that the quark charge density in a @xmath2 for a state of transverse spin projection + 3/2 is shows an elongation along the axis of the spin ( prolate deformation ) .",
