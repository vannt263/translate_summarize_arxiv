    "the internal rotation of the sun is intimately related to the processes that drive the activity cycle .",
    "@xcite stated that , `` knowledge of the internal rotation of the sun with latitude , radius , and time is essential for a complete understanding of the evolution and the present properties of the sun , '' and this remains true today .",
    "the sun rotates on its axis approximately once every twenty - seven days ; however , the rotation is not uniform , being substantially slower near the poles than at the equator .",
    "this superficial aspect of the solar differential rotation was well known from sunspot observations as early as the seventeenth century .",
    "however it is only within the last thirty years that it has become possible to observe the rotation profile in the solar interior , and mostly within the most recent solar cycle that its subtle temporal variations have become evident .",
    "helioseismology  the study of the waves that propagate within the sun and",
    "the inference from their properties of the solar interior structure and dynamics  is the most important tool we have to measure this internal rotation .    in this review ,",
    "we start by introducing some of the basic concepts of helioseismology (   [ section : acoustic ] ) and the inversion problem (   [ section : inversionbasics ] ) as it applies to the internal solar rotation .",
    "next , after a brief historical overview (   [ section : obs ] ) of the observations , we consider what we have learned from helioseismology about the rotation profile and its variation with depth .",
    "we consider first the time - invariant part of the solar rotation profile .",
    "the main features of interest are ( figure  [ fig : quad ] ) :    1 .   the radiative interior and core , which appear to rotate approximately as a solid body , though the innermost core may behave differently ; (   [ section : interior ] ) , 2 .",
    "the tachocline , a relatively thin zone of shear between the differentially rotating convection zone and the radiative interior , which is believed to play an important role in the solar dynamo (   [ section : tachocline ] ) ; 3 .   the differential rotation in the bulk of the convection zone (   [ section : bulk ] ) ; and 4 .   the subsurface shear layer between the fastest - rotating layer at about @xmath0 and the surface .",
    "(   [ section : nearsurf ] ) .",
    "we will consider each of these in turn , working outwards from the core to the surface , and then discuss the time - varying part of the rotation  the torsional oscillation (   [ section : torsional ] ) and the possible variations at the base of the convection zone (   [ section : tachvar ] ) .",
    "we attempt to place the observations in the context of models ; however , this is a review from an observer s point of view , and an exhaustive examination of the models themselves is beyond its scope .",
    "the raw data of helioseismology consist of measurements of the photospheric doppler velocity  or in some cases intensity in a particular wavelength band  taken at a cadence of about one minute and generally collected with as little interruption as possible over periods of months or years ; the measurements can be either imaged or integrated (  sun as a star \" ) .",
    "an overview of the observation techniques can be found in @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : doppler ] shows a typical single doppler velocity image of the sun , and figure  [ fig : tseries ] a portion of an @xmath1 time series , derived by averaging the velocity over the visible disk for each successive image in a set of observations .",

    "@xmath4 modes \" can be classified by their radial order @xmath5 , spherical harmonic degree @xmath6 , and azimuthal order @xmath7 ; as discussed , for example , in   2.2 of @xcite , the radial displacement of a fluid element at time @xmath8 , latitude @xmath9 and longitude @xmath10 can be written in the form @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the radial eigenfunction of the mode with frequency @xmath13 and @xmath14 is a spherical harmonic . as seen in figure  [ fig : lnu ] , the power in the spectrum falls along distinct `` ridges '' in the @xmath3 plane , each ridge corresponding to one radial order .",
    "the modes making up the @xmath15 ridge are the so - called @xmath16 modes , which are surface gravity waves .",
    "the @xmath4 modes , so called because their restoring force is pressure , are excited at the surface and have their largest amplitudes there .",

    "the power in the modes peaks at about 3  mhz , or a period of 5  minutes ; useful measurements can be made for modes between about 1.5 and 5  mhz , with the frequency determination becoming more challenging at the extremes due to signal - to - noise issues and , at the high - frequency end , to the increasing breadth of the peaks .",

    "this amount of data was somewhat unwieldy in the early days of helioseismology .",
    "it is therefore common to express @xmath42 as a polynomial expansion , for example , @xmath43 where the basis functions are polynomials related to the clebsch - gordan coefficients @xmath44 by @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "indeed , in many analysis schemes coefficients of the expansion are derived by fitting directly to the acoustic spectrum and the individual frequencies are not measured .",

    "the line - of - sight projection factor is @xmath52 .    because only part of the solar surface is visible at any time , the masks are not completely orthogonal and the modes `` leak '' into neighboring spectra .",
    "this leakage complicates the analysis and can cause systematic errors in the measured frequencies if it is not correctly taken into account . for",

    "one example of the importance of the leakage is in the contribution of the so - called @xmath7-leaks ( @xmath59 ) to the estimation of low - degree splittings . as pointed out , for example , by @xcite ,",
    "these leaks are strongest for small @xmath60 ; they are also asymmetrical , especially for @xmath35 , where the @xmath61 peak has an @xmath62 leak on one side and no counterbalancing @xmath63 leak on the other . especially for @xmath64",
    ", this can introduce a serious systematic error into the estimate of the splitting if not properly accounted for .",
    "leakage also means that integrated - sunlight instruments ( which effectively use the @xmath1 mask ) can detect modes of @xmath65 , though the sensitivity falls off rapidly for @xmath66 .",
    "all these modes appear in a single acoustic spectrum ; the instruments are sensitive to odd-@xmath7 modes for odd @xmath6 and to even-@xmath7 modes for even @xmath6 , with the sectoral , or @xmath35 , modes most strongly detected .",
    "in general , the leakage has effects throughout the acoustic spectrum , but the most deleterious effects arise when the leaks can not be resolved from the target peaks .",
    "this occurs for @xmath7-leaks at frequencies above about 2  mhz ; for higher - degree modes the leakage between modes of adjacent @xmath6 becomes a problem , as the ridges become both broader , and more closely spaced in frequency , at around @xmath67 . beyond this point",

    "simple examination of the odd - order coefficients , sorted by the lower turning - point radius of the modes , reveals the existence of the near - surface shear , the differential rotation within the convection zone , and a discontinuity in the differential rotation at the base of the convection zone , as shown in figure  [ fig : coeffs ] .",
    "more sophisticated analysis is also possible .",
    "for example , @xcite gave approximate expressions for the rotation profile at different latitudes as sensed by a particular @xmath39 multiplet , @xmath68 , as follows : @xmath69 these estimates , where the subscripts on the lhs refer to the latitude in degrees , are noisy for individual multiplets , but @xcite were able to build up a picture of the internal rotation from bbso data by forming cumulative averages with the input data sorted in ascending order of @xmath20 .",

    "the averaging kernels are independent of the values of the data . however , because the uncertainties in the data are used to weight the inversion calculation that generates the coefficients @xmath89 , as described below in  ",
    "[ section : rls ] and [ section : ola ] , these do enter indirectly into the averaging kernels .",

    "@xcite found that the spatial scale over which the inversion errors are significantly correlated is usually similar to that for the averaging kernels , though for some cases where the inversion parameters have been badly chosen the results can be correlated over long distances even when the averaging kernels appear well formed .",
    "error correlations by definition should not distort the inferred profile beyond the distribution predicted by the formal uncertainty on the inferences , provided always that the input uncertainties are correct .",
    "however , the finite width of averaging kernels also gives rise to a systematic error that can be much larger .",
    "consider , for example , the case where a thin shear layer is not resolved ; then all the estimated rotation rates on one side of the shear could be underestimated , and those on the other side overestimated , by several times the formal uncertainty .",
    "such systematic errors and their relationship to the averaging kernels have been discussed , for example , by @xcite .",
    "@xcite pointed out that it is not sufficient for the rotation rates at two locations to have non - overlapping errors as calculated in equation  ( [ eq : erreq ] ) , and described a method for increasing the error estimates on inversions to allow truly significant differences between the inferred rotation rate at different locations to be determined .",
    "this method , however , has not been widely used .",
    "because the input data are noisy and of finite resolution , the inversion problem does not have a unique solution ; there will always be a tradeoff between noise and good localization .",
    "two widely - used approaches to balancing these criteria are  regularized least squares \" ( rls ) and `` optimally localized averaging '' ( ola ) .",
    "the rls approach to the inversion problem is to find ( essentially through a least - squares fit ) the model profile that best fits the data , subject to a smoothness penalty term , or regularization .",
    "more regularization  a larger weighting for the penalty term  results in poorer spatial resolution ( and potentially more systematic error ) but smaller uncertainties .",

    "the rls inversion has the advantages of being computationally inexpensive and always ( thanks to the second - derivative regularization , which amounts to an a priori assumption of smoothness ) providing some kind of estimate of the quantity of interest even in locations that are not , strictly speaking , resolved by the data . in this method ,",

    "if the choice of target kernel is poor  too narrow or too wide for the quantity and quality of the data  the reliability of the inversion will suffer . in ola inversions , setting target locations outside the regions that can be resolved using the data will result in averaging kernels displaced from their targets , and this should be taken into account when interpreting the results .",

    "another approach , older , and more computationally expensive , is the multiplicative ola ( mola ) described by @xcite . here",

    "alternatives to full 2-dimensional inversions are the so - called `` 1.5-dimensional '' approach , in which 1-dimensional radial inversions are carried out separately for each of the coefficients describing the latitudinal rotation variation , and `` @xmath107 '' inversions in which the radial and latitudinal variations of the rotation rate are integrated separately . for details of many of these methods , please see @xcite and references therein .",
    "it is important to bear in mind the limitations of the inversion process when considering the results .",
    "the deepest and shallowest depths that can be resolved , for example , are limited by the deepest and shallowest turning - point radii of the available modes .",
    "the rotational splitting at a given @xmath7 is to first order proportional to the rotation rate multiplied by @xmath60 ; since the only mode whose latitudinal kernel reaches the pole is the @xmath36 mode , which has no longitudinal structure and so can convey no rotational information , and the modes of small @xmath108 have only a few nodes around the equator and hence have low sensitivity to the rotation , the 2d inversion becomes progressively less reliable at high latitudes .",
    "furthermore , since only modes of relatively low degree ( @xmath109 ) penetrate into the radiative interior , the latitudinal resolution in this region is quite poor and becomes progressively worse with depth ; radial resolution also becomes coarser in the interior .",
    "the practical effects of such limitations can be assessed by careful inspection of the averaging kernels , or by performing forward - calculation tests in which the averaging kernels are convolved with known test profiles .",
    "another point to bear in mind when considering inversion results is that the inversion can measure only the north ",
    "south symmetric part of the profile ; any asymmetry between the hemispheres is averaged out .",
    "the inversions are also insensitive to meridional motions .",
    "some information on hemispheric differences can be obtained using the the techniques of local helioseismology , as reviewed by @xcite , but these techniques , using high - degree modes , are mostly sensitive only to the outer layers of the sun .",
    "systematic helioseismic observations stretch back nearly thirty years , as illustrated in the schematic chart in figure  [ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "prior to the identification of global low - degree modes by @xcite , observing runs were usually short and carried out at a single site .",
    "however , the advantages of more extended observations ( to obtain better frequency resolution ) , and of observations not modulated by the day - night cycle , were soon recognized . @xcite and @xcite carried out important observations at the south pole during the austral summer , but for long time series it is more practical to observe either from a network of sites spaced around the world , or from space .",
    "some of the first long - term sets of low - degree observations came from the active cavity irradiance monitor ( acrim ) experiment @xcite aboard the solar maximum mission spacecraft , which took helioseismic measurements in 1980 and 19841985 , the mark  i instrument in tenerife @xcite , and the precursors of the birmingham integrated solar network ( bison ) @xcite .",

    "and the high - degree taiwanese oscillations network @xcite deployed over the 19931996 period .",
    "all these observations will be considered in more detail as we proceed to examine the results pertaining to the interior rotation .",
    "interest in the rotation of the deep solar interior predates systematic helioseismic observation .",
    "one other possible diagnostic of the internal rotation is provided by the solar oblateness ; because the sun is not a solid body , both gravitational and rotational effects cause a very slight flattening . the lowest - order term in this effect",
    "is related to the quadrupole moment @xmath110 ; confusingly , the next - highest term , @xmath111 , is sometimes called octopole and sometimes hexadecapole . according to @xcite , who give a useful review of attempts to measure the solar oblateness , for a non - rotating sun the oblateness @xmath112",

    " a challenging endeavor that produced controversial results .",
    "models ( e.g. , @xcite ) suggested that the interior of the sun could still be spinning at the rapid rate at which it originally formed , while the exterior had been slowed down by the torque of the solar wind .",
    "( as will be further discussed in section  [ section : tachocline ] , in the absence of direct observations of the solar interior the picture of solar interior dynamics was not at all clear , although the existence of something like what we now call the tachocline could be inferred from theoretical arguments . )",

    "@xcite pointed out that the presence of magnetic field in the solar interior might well complicate the issue , and in an accompanying article @xcite suggested using a space probe in a highly eccentric orbit as a more direct test of general relativity  or , alternatively , that `` more complete theoretical and observational knowledge of the visible layers and the interior of the sun '' was needed .",
    "at least partly inspired by the controversy , @xcite studied the rotational velocities of young solar - type stars in the pleiades and concluded that angular momentum was lost on a timescale of about half a billion years , but noted in his conclusion that `` it is wrong to conclude that the present work in any way supports the dicke result . ''",
    "@xcite considered the stability of differentially rotating stars and concluded that it was possible but not likely that a radial rotation gradient such as that required by the @xcite result might exist .",
    "h. hill , a former colleague of dicke who had helped build the instrument with which the 1964 observations were made @xcite , and collaborators , also attempted to measure the solar oblateness , using an instrument , sclera [ santa catalina observatory for experimental relativity by astrometry ] , which was later to play a role in the early days of helioseismology .",
    "this measurement , carried out in 1973 , @xcite , found a @xmath120 value for the oblateness , much smaller than that of @xcite ; @xcite also pointed out a time - varying difference between the brightness of the solar limb and poles that might account for the anomalously high oblateness measurement .",
    "@xcite made an early attempt to deduce what the @xmath110 and @xmath111 terms should be based on a simple differential rotation profile deduced from surface measurements , obtaining predicted values of between 1 and @xmath121 for @xmath110 and between @xmath122 and @xmath123 for @xmath111 depending on the size of the convective envelope .",
    "@xcite repeated the 1966 measurements with an improved instrument , and obtained significantly smaller values for the oblateness , with some weak evidence for a solar - cycle variation .",
    "@xcite made measurements using a balloon - based instrument and obtained values of @xmath124 for @xmath110 and @xmath125 for @xmath111 . by this point , however , the focus in the solar oblateness studies had moved away from trying to infer the core rotation .",
    "@xcite used more realistic models of the internal rotation profile to suggest that the @xmath111 term should be particularly sensitive to the subsurface shear .",
    "recent work on determining the oblateness from the shape of the solar limb has taken into account considerations of near - surface temperature or magnetic variations .",
    "@xcite used observations from mdi during rolls of the soho spacecraft and @xcite used the rhessi x - ray telescope . the work with soho revealed a temporal variation in the shape of the solar limb , with greater apparent oblateness at solar maximum , suggesting that hotter , brighter activity belts have greater apparent diameter .",
    "this poses an apparent contradiction to the results obtained from helioseismic inferences of the asphericity .",
    "indeed , @xcite suggest that all the temporally - varying , excess oblateness found in the observations can be corrected away by removing an ad - hoc term related to magnetic elements in the enhanced network .",
    "meanwhile , a much more flexible tool  helioseismology  had become available for probing the interior solar rotation .      around the early 1970s",
    "there were numerous attempts to search for global @xmath4-mode oscillations , with interest at first focusing on longer - period oscillations , the low - order , low - degree modes .",
    "various theoretical predictions @xcite of the periods were available , offering the hope that global oscillations could be used to probe the rotation and structure deep inside the sun . at first most of the results @xcite , were negative , except for the 160-minute period of @xcite , which was later @xcite determined to be spurious and will not be further discussed here .",
    "the sclera group @xcite found a variety of longer - period fluctuations in their solar - diameter data , but these results were not universally accepted ; for example ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also references therein ) claimed that the sclera results were consistent with pure noise .",
    "low - degree helioseismology became a reality when the birmingham group @xcite identified oscillations in the five - minute frequency band in integrated sunlight as low - degree global modes , using observations from tenerife and pic du midi during the summers of 19761978 ; these initial data were adequate only to identify the spacing between modes of the same @xmath6 and different @xmath5 , without resolving separate @xmath1 and @xmath64 peaks .",
    "a french - american team @xcite obtained five days of continuous observations at the south pole in the austral summer of 19791980 , and were able to identify peaks of degree 0 , 1 , 2 , and 3 and even a weak @xmath126 peak by superposing sections of the acoustic spectrum with different radial order .",
    "these modes were identified as being of radial order around 1230 , as opposed to the very low - order modes that had been sought in the low - frequency spectrum ; both the noise characteristics of the spectrum and the low amplitude of the lower - order modes mean that the fundamental ( @xmath127 ) mode remains unobserved to this day , although some low - degree modes with single - digit @xmath5 have been identified @xcite .",
    "soon , the birmingham team @xcite , using 28 days of integrated - sunlight data from the tenerife site and an analysis that involved `` collapsing '' segments of the acoustic spectrum so as to average together modes of the same degree and different radial order , reported finding three rotationally split components in the @xmath64 modes and five in @xmath128 , with an average separation of 0.75  @xmath129hz .",
    "if correct , this would have implied a solar core rotation substantially faster than the surface .",
    "@xcite suggested that the excess component peaks ( when two and three would be the expected number for @xmath64 and @xmath128 respectively ) could be explained if the solar core were rotating on an oblique axis and had a very strong magnetic field ; this idea , which was also mooted by @xcite to explain an oscillation of about half the solar rotation period seen in the oblateness data @xcite , was rebutted in some detail by @xcite .",
    "@xcite reported that initial results from 5 days of low - degree observations at the south pole suggested quite short lifetimes , about 2 days ; the @xmath1 peaks appeared narrower than those of @xmath64 and @xmath128 .",
    "@xcite later identified about 80 normal modes in the south pole data , but did not confirm the @xcite rotational splitting result , instead reporting that the @xmath64 peak seemed too narrow to accommodate the reported splitting .",
    "@xcite reported a periodicity of approximately 13 days in the radial solar velocity , as measured using the resonant - scattering technique and the potassium d - line , and interpreted this as an effect of the solar core rotation ; however , this effect was quickly explained away @xcite as an artifact caused by the rotation of surface features  sunspots and plage  across the disk .",
    "meanwhile , the low - degree five - minute acoustic spectrum had also been observed using the active cavity irradiance monitor ( acrim ) aboard the solar maximum mission ( smm ) spacecraft @xcite .",
    "@xcite agreed with @xcite in finding that the modes had lifetimes of about two days , too short for the rotational splitting reported by @xcite to be real .",
    "later work @xcite revealed that the width of the peaks  inversely proportional to the mode lifetimes  was strongly dependent on frequency across the five - minute spectrum , with lifetimes of a few days in the middle of the five - minute band and weeks or months at low frequencies where , unfortunately , the amplitudes of the modes are also small . reliable direct measurement of the low - degree splittings would have to wait for some years , while sufficiently long , high - quality time series of data accumulated .      in the meantime , resolved - sun observations provided some information about the rotation in the radiative interior .",
    "@xcite reported observations at kitt peak , from 1026 may 1983 , for degrees @xmath130 . when plotted as a function of degree ,",
    "the results show a slow decrease in the rotational splitting , from the highest degrees down to about @xmath131 , with an unexplained bump at @xmath132 , followed by an increase at lower degrees up to a value of 660  nhz for @xmath64 .",
    "these data , inverted by @xcite , yielded a rotation profile with much of the radiative interior rotating at or below the surface rate , but with a modest increase in the interior .",
    "a similar pattern was found by @xcite , using 6 days of observations from the newly - developed fourier tachometer , a true 2-dimensional imaging instrument that gave access to all the azimuthal orders for degrees between 8 and 50 ; however , the coincidence of the @xmath132 bump seems to have been merely a coincidence of noise , as it was not reproduced in the early observations from the big bear solar observatory @xcite .",
    "@xcite derived splittings from the sclera low - frequency peaks , and from those inferred a core rotating at 6 times the surface rate ; however , @xcite used acrim data to place an upper limit of 2.2 times the surface rate on the interior rotation rate , inconsistent with these splittings .",
    "later , @xcite identified low - degree rotational splittings in the five - minute band of the sclera acoustic spectrum , but @xcite and @xcite found that these results were inconsistent with the other evidence and were probably the result of misidentification of the modes .",
    "given the complexity of the spectrum in question , whose derivation from measurements sampled at a few points on the solar limb made it difficult to separate out spectra of different degree , this seems a likely explanation .",
    "the next several years were active ones for low - degree helioseismology , with the development of the bison ( birmingham - based ) and iris ( based in nice ) networks .",
    "together with the iphir instrument that rode the phobos spacecraft on its cruise phase to mars , and the ground tests of the loi ( luminosity oscillations imager ) instrument that would later be mounted on the soho spacecraft , these brought a succession of estimates of the low - degree splitting , as summarized in table  [ tab : l1tab ] and figure  [ fig : l1tab ] .",
    "in addition to the mdi instrument for medium and high - degree observations , the soho spacecraft carried both loi and golf ( global oscillations at low frequencies ) specifically for observing low - degree modes . even though golf malfunctioned and could not be operated in its intended differential mode , instead being confined to making doppler observations on one side of an absorption line , it provided some of the best available long - term , low - degree observations .",

    ".summary of @xmath64 splitting measurements , 19882002 [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     @xcite and @xcite found no significant evidence for a variation in the position or thickness of the tachocline with latitude , but @xcite found a significant prolateness , with the tachocline @xmath133 shallower at latitude @xmath134 than at the equator . @xcite also found a slightly thicker and shallower tachocline at high latitudes , and speculated that the tachocline location might be discontinuous at the latitude ( around @xmath135 ) where the shear vanishes and changes sign .",
    "even the most generous estimates for the observed tachocline thickness are small enough to pose an interesting theoretical question : what prevents the shear from spreading further into the radiative interior , destroying the observed uniform rotation ?",
    "the literature on tachocline modeling is extensive , far beyond the scope of this review . in brief , three main candidate mechanisms have been proposed : turbulent flows @xcite ; `` fossil '' magnetic fields ( e.g. , @xcite ) ; and gravity waves , known to observational helioseismologists as @xmath17 modes ( e.g. , @xcite ) , but all these scenarios have problems when considered as the sole mechanism . recent advances in computing",
    "have made possible detailed three - dimensional simulations to explore these issues , but these models have not yet been able to reproduce a self - sustaining tachocline . for a review from a modeler s perspective , see @xcite .",
    "also , a variety of discussions of tachocline models are collected in the book edited by @xcite .",
    "the surface differential rotation , with the equator rotating faster than the poles , was known from , for example , sunspot tracking , long before helioseismology opened up the solar interior .",
    "most models in the pre - helioseismology era predicted or assumed a rotation rate constant on cylinders parallel to the axis of rotation .",
    "this is a consequence of the so - called taylor - proudman constraint , a well - known result in fluid dynamics .",
    "@xcite observed from the south pole , using only sectoral modes ; their instrument used intensity images in a calcium absorption line , scanning rather than imaging the whole sun at once .",
    "their main conclusion was that , `` most of the sun s volume rotates at a rate close to that of the surface . ''",
    "@xcite had a different instrument , the fourier tachometer , which produced @xmath136 pixel velocity images .",
    "@xcite s initial crude analysis of five days of data used cross - correlation , and expanded the multiplet frequencies using low - order polynomial fits ; the results showed little sign of any depth variation in the differential rotation .",
    "@xcite , again using data from south pole observations but now covering the full range of azimuthal orders , found values of the @xmath47 coefficient ( the first - order measure of differential rotation ) consistent with the surface rotation and rather larger than was consistent with the results of @xcite .",
    "@xcite , with 15 days ( not all consecutive ) of fourier tachometer data , could not distinguish between rotation on cylinders and latitude - dependence , but found that there was definitely less differential rotation in the radiative interior below the convection zone ; their @xmath47 values were now closer to those of @xcite , and they declared the previous ones erroneous .",
    "@xcite carried out a much more detailed analysis of the @xcite data , strengthening the evidence for mostly depth - independent rotation in the convection zone , as shown in figure  [ fig : brown89 ] .",
    "both the south pole observations and those of brown and collaborators were relatively noisy and of poor resolution ; although they strongly hinted at a picture with little radial differential rotation in the convection zone and little differential rotation at all below it , other interpretations were possible .",
    "@xcite published splittings from 100 days of bbso observations in summer 1986 , broadly confirming the results of @xcite with substantially smaller uncertainties .",
    "@xcite inverted these data , and inferred a sharp radial gradient at the base of the convection zone and roughly constant rotation at each latitude above that .",
    "they also found a bump in the rotation rate in the middle of the convection zone , to which we will return below .",
    "other inversions of the same data set were presented by @xcite and @xcite , with similar results , though not all the early inversions ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ) produce such recognizable results ; this may be an example of the difficulty of using ola - type techniques for data with insufficient higher - degree modes .",
    "another ( 2d ola ) inversion of these data , shown in figure  [ fig : scdt92 ] , was carried out by @xcite , who illustrated their averaging kernels ; these were rather broad , but adequate to rule out a rotation - on - cylinders model .",
    "this paper was also the first to make the important point that the so - called `` polar '' rotation rate inferred from inversions is actually localized somewhat away from the pole .",
    "@xcite continued to challenge the observers to completely exclude rotation on cylinders , pointing out that it was possible to construct a cylindrical model that satisfied the constraint of the bbso data , but @xcite showed that such a model could not be made consistent with both the fourier tachometer data and the gravitational stability of the rotating sun .",
    "@xcite analyzed fourier tachometer observations from 1989 and pointed out a `` wiggle '' in the splitting coefficients at @xmath137 , ( corresponding to a turning - point radius of about @xmath138 ) ; attributed to daily modulation of the observations , this now well - known effect accounts for the `` feature '' seen in the middle of the convection zone in many inversions of single - site data .",
    "better data , with long time series free from daily modulation , were obviously needed before much more progress could be made , and with the advent of the gong network in 1995 and the mdi instrument aboard soho in 1996 such data became available .",
    "preliminary rotation profiles were presented by @xcite for gong and by @xcite for mdi , both showing the now familiar pattern of almost - constant rotation in the convection zone , with shear layers both at the base of the convection zone and below the surface .",
    "@xcite carried out a comprehensive analysis of the rotation profile based on the first 144 days of observations from mdi , using and comparing several different rotation inversion techniques with an input data set consisting of coefficients up to @xmath139 for @xmath4 modes up to @xmath140 and @xmath16 modes up to @xmath141 .",
    "they were able to obtain consistent and robust results from the surface to about @xmath142 at low latitudes ; at higher latitudes the domain of reliability was shallower .",
    "roughly speaking , the inversions could not be well localized within about @xmath143 of the rotation axis .",
    "the results ( fig .",
    "[ fig : s98 ] ) showed that the rotation in the bulk of the convection zone , below @xmath144 , had a slow increase with radius at most latitudes , but was definitely incompatible with rotation on cylinders .",
    "1d sola , ( d ) 1.5d rls , from @xcite , reproduced by permission of the aas.,width=480 ]      in addition to the other general features described here , @xcite found some evidence for a `` jet '' of faster rotation at about @xmath145 latitude and @xmath144 ; although this was more obvious in some inversions than in others , it did seem to have a signature in the coefficients themselves ( see also @xcite )",
    ". however , this feature was not reproduced in inversions of gong data ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or even in inversions of mdi data analyzed with the gong pipeline @xcite , and it is now believed to be an artifact related to the mdi data analysis .",
    "once both gong and mdi had been running for a few years , it became evident that the two projects were producing inferences of the interior rotation profile that were different in some significant details , particularly at high latitudes within the convection zone .",
    "@xcite carried out a careful comparison , taking data from three epochs at different phases of the solar cycle from each project and deriving rotational splittings or splitting coefficients from each , both with the usual algorithms and with those regularly used for the other project s data , before using both rls and ola inversions .",
    "the results clearly showed that most of the discrepancies arose from the analysis pipelines rather from the data themselves .",
    "the `` ca '' peak - fitting algorithm used for the mdi data was able to extract modes from the gong data to somewhat higher degrees and lower frequencies than the `` az '' algorithm could manage with either gong or mdi input data .",
    "however , for both mdi and gong data , the `` ca '' algorithm introduced an anomaly in the splitting coefficients centered at around 3.3  mhz , which in turn caused the inversion inferences to show a higher rotation rate deep in the convection zone at higher latitudes .",
    "excluding these data brought the gong and mdi data ( analyzed with the `` az '' and `` ca '' pipelines respectively ) into much better agreement , at the cost of somewhat degraded resolution . restricting both data sets to the common mode set below 3  mhz reduced the discrepancies even farther , but did not remove the `` jet '' in the mdi data . since the `` jet '' feature was only seen in the mdi data analyzed with the ca pipeline , however , the authors concluded that this feature was probably spurious .",
    "although much of the debate in the early 1990s centered on discriminating between rotation constant on cylinders and rotation constant along radial lines , neither picture gave a complete description of the data .",
    "@xcite pointed out that the differential rotation in the bulk of the convection zone , at least at low- to mid - latitudes , could be quite well described by saying that the contours of constant rotation lay at about a @xmath146 angle to the rotation axis , as illustrated in figure  [ fig : slant ] .     to the rotation axis as dashed lines , after @xcite , and cuts at constant latitude as a function of radius ( right ) , after @xcite.,title=\"fig:\",height=192 ]   to the rotation axis as dashed lines , after @xcite , and cuts at constant latitude as a function of radius ( right ) , after @xcite.,title=\"fig:\",height=192 ]    figure  [ fig : cyl ] compares idealized rotation profiles for the cylindrical , radial , and slanted - contour configurations .     to the rotation axis",
    "( right ) .",
    "the top row shows contours of constant rotation , while the lower row shows rotation rate as a function of radius at constant latitude for latitudes at @xmath147 intervals from the equator ( top ) to @xmath145 ( bottom ) .",
    "the rotation rate is matched to the gong inferences at @xmath148 and smoothed to simulate the broadening effect of inversion resolution on the tachocline ; the near - surface shear was not included.,width=480 ]      another interesting feature revealed by the early gong and mdi observations @xcite was that , while the surface rotation rate was mostly well described by the usual three - term expansion in the cosine of the colatitude @xmath9 , @xmath149 , ( e.g. , @xcite ) the rotation rate close to the poles was significantly slower than that .",
    "the authors speculated that this might be a result of drag from the solar wind , and that the effect might therefore disappear or become less marked at epochs of higher activity .",
    "in fact , though the inferred high - latitude rate did speed up during solar maximum  as seen , for example , in @xcite and in figure  [ fig : torfig2 ]  it remained at all times lower than the extrapolation of the three - term fit .",
    "the interior rotation is only one part of the complex system that drives the solar cycle , but it is perhaps still the easiest part to measure in the solar interior ; the meridional circulation can be directly measured only in the shallower subsurface layers , and buried magnetic fields can at best only be inferred indirectly .",
    "the differential rotation in the convection zone must arise from the interaction of convection cells and coriolis forces , with the meridional motions playing an important part .",
    "early depictions of the solar dynamo ( see , for example , @xcite ) required a rotation rate increasing inward , and a meridional flow rising at the poles and sinking at the equator , in order to drive the solar cycle migration of the activity belts in the observed sense .",
    "this picture , taken together with rotation on cylinders , would have meant that the observed surface differential rotation was a superficial phenomenon , with the dynamo operating in the unobservable deeper layers . at this stage , there does not seem to have been a clear distinction made between the direction of the meridional circulation at the surface and the direction of migration of the magnetic activity belts during the solar cycle , which are of course now understood to operate in opposite directions ; the poleward meridional flow at the surface was first measured by @xcite .",
    "the models of @xcite and @xcite , which were among the first numerical simulations of solar rotation and the dynamo , have been cited , for example by @xcite as dating from `` prior to the advent of helioseismology , '' but this is not quite correct . in fact , both these papers refer to the duvall and harvey data , and @xcite also mentions the observations of @xcite , suggesting that the model results could be consistent with the helioseismic observations if there were a layer of inward - increasing velocity below the surface and above the domain of the simulation .",
    "the simulations in both cases , like their precursors over the previous several years such as that described by @xcite , produced rotation approximately constant on cylinders and increasing outward , which would result in a dynamo wave propagating poleward if the dynamo were operating in the bulk of the convection zone .",
    "the main message that modelers in the late 1980s seem to have taken from the observations was that the rotation rate was increasing outward , in agreement with the simulations of @xcite but in disagreement with the @xmath150-effect dynamo picture , which required a rotation rate increasing inward ; see @xcite for a review representing a theorist s perspective on the state of play at this stage .",
    "this led @xcite to suggest ( not for the first time ; see also , for example , @xcite ) that the dynamo might be operating in a thin layer at the bottom of the convection zone ; this speculation was further reinforced by the later helioseismic inferences that clearly showed this shear layer , or tachocline ( see section  [ section : tachocline ] ) and the approximately radial configuration of the rotation in the convection zone .",
    "even quite recent global simulations of convection ( * ? ? ?",
    "* for example , ) still show some tendency towards rotation on cylinders , but the higher - resolution calculation of @xcite mostly eliminates the cylindrical effect and produces a rotation pattern , based on giant convection cells , that after suitable temporal averaging looks quite solar - like , as illustrated in figure  [ fig : miesch ] .",
    "one persistent puzzle in the measurements of rotation at the photosphere had been that direct doppler measurements consistently gave somewhat slower rotation rates than the measurements made by tracing surface features .",
    "for example , @xcite summarized the results of @xcite as @xmath151 for magnetic features and @xmath152 for the surface plasma , respectively , where @xmath129 is the sine of the latitude . for an overview of such measurements ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the usual explanation for the discrepancy is that while the doppler techniques measure the velocity at the surface , the tracers such as sunspots are anchored in a faster - rotating layer deeper down .",
    "for example , @xcite noted that the observations implied a subsurface shear layer and suggested that this might arise from angular momentum conservation in the supergranular layer .    an extremely early attempt to measure the subsurface rotation was made by @xcite , when the identification of the 5-minute oscillations with @xmath4 modes was still a relatively recent discovery .",
    "these authors used high - degree modes , probing about the upper 20  mm ( @xmath153 ) of the convection zone , and detected an inwards - increasing gradient .",
    "if these measurements are reliable , they represent the first detection of the subsurface shear .",
    "however , most of the early helioseismic measurements of the internal rotation profile were restricted to a degree range that did not allow the near - surface shear to be resolved in inversions .",
    "@xcite , attempting to measure the rotation in the bulk of the convection zone , also saw hints of a gradient , opposite to that seen at the base of the convection zone , below the surface , and @xcite used forward calculation techniques on the data of @xcite and @xcite to deduce that the rotation rate must increase inward immediately below the surface .",
    "we should remember , however , that at this time the picture of the internal rotation profile was not as clear as it is today , and it is not always obvious whether interpretation of the observations as gradients of rotation refers to the near - surface shear , the shear at the base of the convection zone , or some unresolved amalgamation of the two .",
    "wilson , for example , was not arguing for a near - surface shear layer but against the model with rotation constant along radii .    with the advent of gong and mdi , measuring modes to higher degrees than had previously been possible , the near - surface shear could be seen in global inversions ; it is visible in the early results presented by @xcite for gong and by @xcite for mdi , in both cases apparently changing sign at higher latitudes .",
    "@xcite found clear evidence of the near - surface shear in inversions of mdi data .",
    "all the inversion methods agreed well on the shear at low latitudes , but at high latitudes the picture was complicated by the proximity of the submerged `` jet '' feature and the methods agreed less well .",
    "the disagreement may have been partly due to systematic errors in the splitting coefficients . in the comparisons of mdi and gong data and analysis carried out by @xcite ,",
    "the high - latitude reversal of the shear is seen only in data analyzed with the `` ca '' pipeline ; this may be partly because the `` az '' pipeline mostly fails to recover the splittings of the ( narrow , low - amplitude ) @xmath16-mode peaks , but the reversal persists in the mdi data even for the restricted common mode set .",
    "the near - surface shear ( down to about 15 mm ) was studied in detail by @xcite , using @xmath16 modes from mdi data .",
    "they measured the slope of the rotation rate , close to the surface at low latitudes , as about @xmath154  nhz/@xmath75 , decreasing to a very small value by about @xmath135 latitude and possibly reversing in sign at higher latitudes ( though this result , seen in only the outer 5  mm , was dependent on only the highest - degree modes , those with @xmath155 ) .",
    "the low - latitude rotation rate was found to vary almost linearly with depth in the subsurface region , while if angular momentum was conserved in parcels of fluid moving with respect to the rotation axis , it would be expected to vary with the inverse square of the distance from the axis .",
    "the near - surface shear is also accessible to the methods of local helioseismology , at least for latitudes below 5060@xmath156 .",
    "@xcite and @xcite compared results from local ring - diagram analysis and global inversions and found , at latitudes @xmath157 , quite good agreement between the @xmath158 values obtained from local and global inversion results . however , although the slope from local measurements does show some variation with latitude ( figure  [ fig : shfig ] ) , it by no means vanishes at 52.5@xmath156 , the highest latitude at which the measurement is made .",
    "the ring - diagram results allow us to consider the northern and southern hemispheres separately , but @xcite found very little difference in the shear between the two hemispheres .",
    "( a ) , @xmath147 ( b ) , @xmath135 ( c ) and @xmath159 ( d ) ; similar to @xcite.,width=480 ]    some attempts have been made to use the near - surface shear to drive or at least contribute to a solar dynamo , for example by @xcite , but @xcite showed that any dynamo contribution from the shear of the outer layers could only provide a fraction of the effect needed to power the solar cycle .",
    "the so - called torsional oscillation is a pattern of migrating bands of faster- and slower - than - average zonal ( i.e. , parallel to the equator ) flow associated with the equatorward drift of the activity belts during the solar cycle .",
    "it was first described by @xcite , who used twelve years ( 19661978 ) of full - disk velocity observations from the 150-foot tower at the mount wilson observatory and found evidence of a pattern of flow bands migrating towards the equator ; the greatest concentration of active regions is associated with the poleward edge of the main equatorward - moving band .",
    "they initially interpreted the high - latitude variations as consisting of bands of faster rotation starting at the poles and taking a full 22-year hale cycle to drift to the equator .",
    "@xcite , observing at the stanford solar observatory , found no evidence of changes in the equatorial rotation rate for data from 19761979 , but as this period was close to a solar minimum , and the resolution of the stanford instrument was not high , this is neither surprising nor inconsistent with the results of @xcite .",
    "@xcite note that @xcite ( at a aas meeting ) , had `` confirmed the existence of the global velocity field , '' though this is not apparent from the latter s published abstract .",
    "a somewhat different pattern of velocity variations is seen when magnetic features rather than doppler measurements are used to determine the surface rotation rate , as described for example by @xcite , who found that the pattern derived from magnetograms lay equatorward of that from doppler measurements , with the slower - than - average bands coinciding with the zones of greater magnetic flux .    mount wilson doppler observations since 1986 , clearly showing the pattern of migrating zonal - flow bands , were presented by @xcite ; see also @xcite for updated results .",
    "the bands extend over about @xmath160 in latitude , and have zonal velocities a few meters per second faster or slower than the surrounding material , corresponding to excess angular velocity of less than @xmath161 of the overall rotation , or a few nanohertz .",
    "the first hints of the signature of the migrating flow bands in helioseismic data can be seen in the bbso data @xcite , as was pointed out by @xcite , but these measurements do not give much information on the radial extent of the flows .",
    "@xcite found evidence of the flows , a few meters per second faster than the general rotation profile , in @xmath16-mode measurements from early mdi data ; @xcite found a similar pattern using the time - distance technique of local helioseismology , while @xcite and @xcite clearly showed that these flows were migrating in a manner consistent with the mount wilson doppler observations .",
    "the first radially - resolved evidence of zonal flow migration was reported by @xcite for gong and by @xcite for mdi , while @xcite combined mdi and gong data and concluded that the equatorward - migrating part of the flow pattern ( at latitudes below about @xmath162 ) penetrated to at least @xmath163 ( 56  mm below the surface ) .",
    "@xcite also reported similar findings .",
    "@xcite studied the evolution of the variations poleward of @xmath164 , which had much higher amplitudes than the equatorward - moving flows and which showed signs of propagating poleward over time .",
    "the larger amplitude of the high - latitude signal may be related to the smaller angular momentum closer to the rotation axis .      as more data accumulated , the signature of the torsional oscillation pattern in the helioseismic observations became clearer .",
    "@xcite studied the evolution of the flows in mdi data from 1996 through 2001 .",
    "they concluded that at least the high - latitude region of changing rotation involves the whole depth of the convection zone .",
    "the results on the radial extent of the flows at lower latitudes were less clear , with evidence that the bands of slower rotation might penetrate close to the base of the convection zone , while the bands of faster rotation appeared to reach about @xmath165 but no deeper .",
    "another interesting feature of that paper was the introduction of the use of 11-year sinusoids to characterize the variation of the rotation rate at any given location .",
    "this innovation had the useful effect of clarifying the pattern , making obvious the poleward propagation of the high - latitude flows even with data from little more than half a cycle .",
    "the existence of a weak third - harmonic component to the eleven - year cycle , however , was not confirmed in later work .    , obtained using two dimensional rls inversion of the gong data , from @xcite , reproduced by permission of the aas.,width=480 ]    -mode measurements , with smooth profile subtracted .",
    "based on a figure from @xcite , updated and used by kind permission of j. schou ( 2008 , private communication.),width=288 ]    @xcite found similar results in mdi and gong data up to 2002 , as seen in figure  [ fig : basu03 ] .",
    "these results also hint at another subtlety ; at low latitudes , the phase of the flow pattern is not constant along radial lines .",
    "in fact , the variation in the lower part of the convection zone appears to lead that close to the surface by a year or two , with the low - latitude band of faster rotation following roughly the same @xmath146 slant as the rotation contours .",
    "this tendency was further studied by @xcite , who compared inversions of mdi and gong data with forward - modeled profiles based on different flow configurations , including some derived from dynamo models . although some detail was lost and distorted due to the resolution and uncertainties in the inversions , the authors were able to conclude that the low - latitude branch probably penetrates through much of the convection zone , but is sufficiently displaced in phase at greater depths that the correlation between the surface pattern and that deeper down almost vanishes . in this work ,",
    "the 11-year sinusoid analysis showed evidence of a second - harmonic component rather than the third harmonic reported by @xcite .",
    "figures  [ fig : torfig1 ] , [ fig : torfig2 ] , and [ fig : torfig3 ] show the variations in rotation rate , based on the results and figures in @xcite , but brought up to date with the most recent gong and mdi observations available at the time of writing .",
    "the plots were prepared using the same 2-d rls inversion codes for both mdi and gong medium - degree data , and 2-d sola for mdi , that were used for the work of @xcite and the other related papers .",
    "figure  [ fig : phamp ] shows the phase and amplitude profiles for 11-year sine functions fitted to the rotation variations .         from left to right ; inversions are mdi ola ( top ) , mdi rls ( middle ) and gong rls ( bottom).,width=528 ]              the torsional oscillation pattern , at least at lower latitudes and closer to the surface , is also suitable for measurements using the techniques of local helioseismology , in which short - wavelength , short - lived waves are used to infer the structure and dynamics of localized areas of the sun .",
    "because these waves do not penetrate very far below the surface , such techniques are restricted to the outer few megameters of the solar envelope , but this region can be studied in much greater detail and with shorter averaging times than is possible with global helioseismology .",
    "@xcite detected the zonal flow migration using mdi data and the ring - diagram technique @xcite , in which the displacement of three - dimensional acoustic power spectra derived from small areas of the solar disk is used to infer horizontal flows in both the zonal and meridional directions .",
    "later , @xcite measured both the zonal flows and a corresponding modulation of the meridional flow pattern , as seen in figure  [ fig : zhfig ] ( left ) .",
    "@xcite , using the time - distance technique , which considers the correlations between oscillations at spatially separated locations , also found bands of meridional flow away from the activity belts associated with the zonal flow bands .",
    "@xcite , using data from the taiwan oscillations network [ ton ] ) , also found diverging meridional flows associated with the activity belts .",
    "@xcite measured the zonal ( figure  [ fig : zhfig ] right ) and meridional flows with the time - distance technique , and reported meridional flow converging on the activity belts above a depth of 12 mm , with diverging flows below 18 mm , forming circulation cells around the activity belts .",
    "the presence of inflows into the activity belts was also observed at the surface by @xcite .",
    "@xcite studied the flows in about a year of high - resolution gong ( `` gong+ '' ) data , and concluded that the overall flow pattern existed whether or not active regions were included in the analysis ; in other words , the zonal flow bands and their associated converging / diverging meridional flows appear to exist independently of the flows in the immediate vicinity of strong active regions .",
    "@xcite compared the results from ring - diagram analysis of the mdi data , global analysis of mdi and gong data , and the mount wilson doppler observations .",
    "they found very similar results for the north ",
    "south symmetrized flow pattern close to the surface in all three observations .",
    "both the global and local helioseismic data indicated that the strength of the flow pattern did not fall off steeply below the surface .",
    "it should be noted that the local helioseismic observations are somewhat prone to systematic errors , some of which follow the changing @xmath166 angle , or tilt of the solar rotation axis relative to the observer , as shown for example by @xcite .",
    "this can result , for example , in a pronounced and almost certainly non - solar north ",
    "south variation of the zonal flow measurements , which is generally corrected for by subtracting suitable averages .",
    "some further features of the torsional oscillation pattern as we know it from a full cycle of observations from gong and mdi ( and nearly two cycles of surface doppler observations ) are worth noting .    1 .",
    "the exact appearance of the pattern is quite sensitive to the background term that is subtracted .",
    "for example , compare the @xmath16-mode results shown in figure  [ fig : schoucolor ] , which were plotted as the difference from a smooth 3-term expansion of the rotation rate , with the plots in figure  [ fig : torfig1 ] , which were plotted by subtracting the temporal mean at each location .",
    "although the pattern repeats  of course not precisely  with each ( approximately ) eleven - year activity cycle , each equatorward - migrating flow band exists for about eighteen years , emerging at mid - latitudes soon after the maximum of one cycle and finally disappearing at the equator a couple of years after the minimum of the following cycle ; thus , the band of faster rotation associated with the activity of cycle  22 was still visible at the beginning of gong and mdi observations in early cycle  23 , and the band that is expected to accompany cycle 24 became visible around 2002 ( if we look at the mean - subtracted residuals ) , or 20052006 ( if we use the smooth - function subtraction ) . on the other hand , each poleward - moving branch seems to last only about nine years , appearing a year or so after solar minimum and moving to the pole before the next minimum .",
    "3 .   although the equatorward - migrating bands of faster rotation are clearly associated with the migrating activity belts of the magnetic butterfly diagram , the relationship is not completely straightforward .",
    "the new equatorward - propagating branch is clearly visible some years before noticeable new cycle active regions begin to erupt , and the phase / latitude profiles of the magnetic index and the velocity are very different .",
    "also , as was noted by @xcite and by @xcite , the strength of the torsional oscillation signal has not shown much change over the last few solar cycles , while the level of magnetic activity varies much more from one cycle to another .",
    "although the equatorward branch of the zonal flow migration pattern shows some relationship to the pattern of enhanced activity in the fe  xiv corona going back to 1973 @xcite , the `` extended solar cycle '' seen in these observations starts at a much higher latitude , apparently about @xmath167 , before migrating to the equator over about eighteen years ; thus even the equatorward edge of these coronal activity bands seems to be at higher latitude than the observed new branch in the zonal flows that starts at about the same time . 5 .   finally , we note that because the angular velocity changes associated with the torsional oscillation signal are relatively small compared to the difference in angular velocity between the surface and the bottom of the near - surface shear layer , while the amplitude of the signal does not decrease rapidly with depth , the magnitude of the shear at a given location varies by only a fraction of its value during the solar cycle .",
    "however , the fractional change in the shear is much greater than the fractional change in the rotation rate .      while observers , for example @xcite and @xcite have speculated that the torsional oscillation pattern might itself be part of the driving mechanism for the solar cycle , perhaps generating activity by shearing magnetic loops , modelers have generally seen it rather as a side - effect of the magnetic fields .",
    "@xcite and @xcite modeled the torsional oscillation as a result of the lorentz force due to dynamo waves ; according to the latter paper , the phenomenon would be important only close to the surface , and would have only equatorward , not poleward , moving bands .",
    "@xcite objected to the @xcite model on the grounds that it would predict a strong correlation between the strength of the surface magnetic field and that of the velocity signal , which did not seem to be the case in the observations .",
    "@xcite used a different mechanism to generate the torsional oscillation signal in their model , considering it as the response of the reynolds stress on the time - dependent dynamo magnetic field rather than a direct effect of the large - scale lorentz force .",
    "this model gave a very weak poleward branch for the torsional oscillation signal .",
    "once the flows had been shown observationally to penetrate well below the surface , @xcite suggested that , `` the pattern of torsional oscillations appear to have the potential of critically discriminating between different dynamo models as , e.g. , the babcock - leighton and interface models . ''",
    "@xcite used a model in which the observed rotation profile was imposed and the rotation variations arises from the action of the lorentz force of the dynamo - generated magnetic field on the angular velocity .",
    "they were able to simulate approximately solar - like patterns of zonal flow bands and magnetic activity . in subsequent papers they focused on the the possibility of so - called `` spatio - temporal fragmentation '' allowing cycles of different periods in different regions , and in calculations with no density stratification in the convection zone they found this to be feasible @xcite .",
    "the effect was not too sensitive to uncertainties in the rotation law @xcite , and somewhat sensitive to the boundary conditions at the outer surface @xcite . adding density stratification @xcite did not substantially change the results , though the amplitude of the oscillations in the deeper layers of the convection zone did decrease as the density gradient increased .",
    "however , they did find that introducing quite a small amount of @xmath150-quenching ( magnetic feedback on turbulent convection ) would suppress the torsional oscillation effect .",
    "@xcite modeled the torsional oscillation pattern as a `` geostrophic flow '' driven by temperature variations near the surface associated with magnetic activity , and therefore having its greatest amplitude at the surface and falling to 1/3 of its surface value at @xmath163 .",
    "this model also accounts for the observed inflows into the activity belts .",
    "there are some problems in reconciling this model with the observations ; it is difficult to see how the observed depth - dependent phase pattern could arise from a surface - originated cause , and the existence of the flows even at epochs where there are no active regions is also hard to explain , though @xcite suggested that the flows might be produced by unobserved small - scale and short - lived magnetic regions .",
    "@xcite used a mean - field flux - transport dynamo model , with a model - derived differential rotation profile and meridional flow , to investigate the effects of various driving mechanisms for the torsional oscillation .",
    "the author concluded that the poleward - propagating branch of the pattern could be explained by a periodic forcing at mid - latitudes without any underlying migration of buried polar field . on the other hand , in this type of model the observed equatorward - propagating branch could not be reproduced without adding a thermal forcing after the manner of the @xcite model .",
    "@xcite compared such a model with the observations , and found it not to be completely consistent with the observed interior behavior of the flows at lower latitudes .",
    "( top ) and @xmath168 ( bottom ) , for rls ( filled ) and ola ( open ) inversions of mdi ( red triangles ) and gong ( black circles ) data.,width=480 ]    @xcite reported finding variations of the equatorial rotation rate close to the tachocline with a 1.3  year period during the early years ( 19951999 ) of gong and mdi observations .",
    "the strongest signal was seen at @xmath169 , with a weaker anticorrelated signal below the tachocline at @xmath168 . at higher latitudes",
    ", there was also an apparent 1-year periodicity .",
    "the signal was more clearly seen in the gong data , and due to the different temporal sample of the mdi data it was difficult to make a quantitative comparison , but the visual appearance of similar variations in both data sets was quite persuasive .",
    "figure  [ fig : tach1 ] extends the data up to the present for the equatorial locations just above and below the tachocline .",
    "because of the role of the tachocline region in the dynamo , as well as the coincidence of the period with that seen in some heliospheric and geomagnetic observations @xcite , this claim attracted considerable interest , inspiring modelers such as @xcite to try to build models in which different periods could exist at the top and bottom of the convection zone .",
    "however , @xcite and @xcite , with a slightly different analysis of the same mdi and gong data , reported finding no significant variations .",
    "( @xcite did see a signal somewhat similar to that reported by @xcite but did not consider it significant . )",
    "moreover , the periodic signal disappears in the post-2001 data even in the original authors analysis @xcite , as shown in figure  [ fig : tach2 ] , and it seems likely that the high - latitude 1-year period was an artifact .",
    "intermittency in short - period variations is a known phenomenon in the geomagnetic - index data , @xcite , and does not in itself imply that the phenomenon was not real",
    ". it will be interesting to see whether the oscillation will reappear in the new solar cycle .",

    "the significance and meaning of this finding remain unestablished .",
    "given estimates of both density and rotation as functions of depth and latitude , one can calculate the solar angular momentum locally or globally .",
    "of course , such calculations will reflect , and in some cases enhance , any errors in the input data , and should therefore be approached with caution .",
    "@xcite investigated the angular momentum variation based on the inversions of gong and mdi data used by @xcite and found variations reflecting the torsional oscillation well into the convection zone and 1.3 year variations close to the tachocline .",
    "because the density increases steeply with decreasing radius , variations at greater depths will be more strongly seen in the angular momentum than in the rotation rate , but it should be remembered that no new information has been added to the data .",
    "@xcite approached the problem from the other direction , considering the role of angular momentum transport in the modeling of the torsional oscillation .",
    "@xcite investigated temporal variations of the solar kinetic energy , angular momentum and higher - order gravitational multipole moments as derived from helioseismic inferences of the internal rotation rate ; they found variations on the time scale of the solar cycle ( but not the 1.3 year cycle ) , with some discrepancies between mdi and gong results .",
    "they also speculate that the kinetic - energy changes might contribute to the observed irradiance variations during the solar cycle ; however , it is not clear that such a contribution is needed , as the usual view is that the solar - cycle variation in irradiance can be modeled simply from the effects of sunspots and plage on the surface , as discussed , for example , by @xcite .",
    "since the 1970s , helioseismology has provided several insights into the interior solar rotation : the approximately - rigid rotation of the radiative interior ; the differential rotation throughout the convection zone ; the thin tachocline ; the extension of the surface torsional oscillation throughout the convection zone . more than once ,",
    "these discoveries have overturned theoretical expectations , inspiring modelers to improve their calculations in an effort to reproduce the observed behavior . because of the surprising nature of many of the findings , it has been important to have more than one source of observations , so that it is possible to distinguish between real solar features  especially the unexpected ones  and systematic error .",
    "it may be that in the future solar cycle  23 , with mdi and gong operating in parallel , will be seen as a golden age of helioseismology . at the time of writing",
    ", we eagerly anticipate the launch of the solar dynamics observatory [ sdo ] with its helioseismic and magnetic imager [ hmi ] , a successor to mdi that will provide near - continuous helioseismic observations at higher resolutions than ever before and may help in unraveling the relationships between active region flows , magnetic fields , and geoeffective solar activity as well as providing a continued watch on the longer - term variations in the solar velocity fields .",
    "sadly , however , current plans call for both gong and mdi to cease to collect data soon after the successful launch of sdo , which would leave hmi without any independent cross - checks , while on the low - degree front the bison network has recently lost its funding and there are no new dedicated low - degree space - based instruments currently scheduled .",
    "there are still areas  such as the strength of the near - surface shear at high latitudes , the rotation of the inner core , and any inhomogeneities and changes in the tachocline  that remain unclear .",
    "furthermore , a complete numerical model of the solar dynamo ",
    "vital for any long - term predictive capability  is still lacking , and helioseismic observations still have an important part to play in constraining such models as they develop .",

    "<S> this article surveys the development of observational understanding of the interior rotation of the sun and its temporal variation over approximately forty years , starting with the 1960s attempts to determine the solar core rotation from oblateness and proceeding through the development of helioseismology to the detailed modern picture of the internal rotation deduced from continuous helioseismic observations during solar cycle  23 . after introducing some basic helioseismic concepts , it covers , in turn , the rotation of the core and radiative interior , the `` tachocline '' shear layer at the base of the convection zone , the differential rotation in the convection zone , the near - surface shear , the pattern of migrating zonal flows known as the torsional oscillation , and the possible temporal variations at the bottom of the convection zone . for each area </S>",
    "<S> , the article also briefly explores the relationship between observations and models . </S>"
