    "the two higgs doublet extension of the standard model leads to five physical higgs particles : two neutral scalars @xmath9 , @xmath10 ( with the mass relation @xmath11 ) , one pseudoscalar @xmath12 and two charged particles @xmath13 . in case of cp conservation ,",
    "their interaction with fermions and gauge bosons is characterized by only two additional parameters @xmath14 and @xmath15 , describing the mixing within the neutral scalar system and the ratio of the vacuum expectation values , respectively @xcite .",

    "a lot of attention has been devoted to two higgs doublet models embedded in the minimal supersymmetric model ( mssm ) . here",
    "strong relations between the various masses and also with the parameters @xmath14 and @xmath15 exist , such that at the tree level there are only two independent parameters and stringent experimental limits on higgs masses can be set . in this paper",
    "we discuss the cp - conserving two higgs doublet model ii , denoted 2hdm , which has a higgs sector as in mssm , but where these relations do not exist and the masses of the higgs particles are very weakly constrained .    in this model the couplings of the pseudoscalar @xmath12 to fermions",

    "couplings to gauge bosons @xmath18 and @xmath19 are forbidden .",
    "the couplings of the scalar @xmath9 to fermions ( and gauge bosons ) depend in addition on @xmath20 .",

    "theoretically the allowed ranges of @xmath20 and @xmath15 are only constrained through the requirement of the perturbativity of calculations which suggests @xmath24 to be between @xmath25 0.1 and 200 - 300 @xcite .",
    "important constrains on the neutral sector of the general 2hdm are due to searches for higgs boson production in @xmath3 decays .  from the absence of evidence for the higgs - strahlung process ( @xmath26 ) limits on the @xmath27 as a function of @xmath28 can be inferred . at least for up to @xmath29 50 gev they imply @xmath30 0.1 and thus @xmath31 @xcite .",

    "the measurement of the wilczek process @xmath42 points to possible constraints for the @xmath43 below 10 gev @xcite , unfortunately the interpretation suffers both from theoretical uncertainties and lack of experimental considerations of some aspects of the 2hdm . in conclusion , only very weak limits exist for this rather simple extension of the higgs sector .",

    "note that since the angular distribution for the @xmath9 and @xmath12 final state are identical up to a normalization factor @xcite these experimental results should also hold for the pseudoscalar @xmath12 .    in this paper we will first address the theoretical aspects of this process , the production rates and decay modes for a neutral higgs boson as a function of its mass and for various values of @xmath1 .",

    "the dependence on the charged higgs mass , in the limits of 54.5 to 330 gev becomes stronger with higher mass @xmath28 .",
    "the product branching ratios for the associated production of a pseudoscalar @xmath12 and a photon is similar to the one for scalars for @xmath24 below 0.2 and @xmath24 above 50 .",
    "thus similar limits to those for the scalar @xmath9 can be derived .",
    "they differ drastically for intermediate values of @xmath24 , where the pseudoscalar production rate is much lower , than for scalars because of the strong @xmath58 contribution in the latter case .    for a large parameter space of the 2hdm",
    "the data have no sensitivity to the expected yields . only for extremely high or low values of @xmath1",
    "some constraints can be derived .",
    "the large @xmath24 region of the 2hdm can be constrained by the data .",
    "these limits are stronger than those from the present @xmath41 data for muons for both a light scalar and a light pseudoscalar higgs boson . for the light pseudoscalar scenario the existing data from the yukawa process at lep lead to stronger limits , but for mass around 10 gev the @xmath142 decay becomes competitive .",
    "constraints on the 2hdm model can also be obtained for the low values of @xmath24 for both scalar ( similar remarks as above for the large @xmath24 case hold here as well ) and pseudoscalar production .",
    "also these limits are of interest , although they just touch the region of @xmath86 1 , which is required by perturbative calculations .    to summarize , the process discussed here leads to constraints of the parameters of the 2hdm for very large and very low @xmath24 for both scalar and pseudoscalar production .",
    "the one - loop calculation applied here may be improved in the future by taking into account higher order corrections .",
    "finally let us consider possible experimental improvements .",
    "although data taking at the @xmath3 has been completed , some improvements may be expected from the data since not the whole statistics has been used up to now for the various analyses and improvements seem possible .",
    "only one experiment has fully exploited the @xmath143 channel , the low mass region @xmath144 20 gev has also not been addressed by all experiments and finally most experiments have improved their beauty tagging compared to what has been published . assuming in addition a proper combination of the final data it may be possible to gain some factor 2 - 4 in sensitivity .",
    "this would imply a sensitivity to branching ratios of some 10@xmath53 .",
    "the drastically lower cross section at the high energies of 160 - 200 gev of lep and also the increased background from initial state photons above the @xmath3 pole , renders it unlikely that a sensitivity close to the expected yields within the 2hdm can be reached . on the other hand ,",
    "higher masses can be reached which in itself makes it important to consider this process .",
    "a first look  @xcite , however , did not reveal any new particle production .",
    "the interpretation of experimental results require a more general theoretical analysis which includes not only the production of on - shell @xmath3 decays .",
    "the high luminosities which are envisaged at a new linear @xmath145 collider or @xmath146 collider may allow some sensitivity to the associated @xmath147 production . however a detailed experimental study is still missing .",
