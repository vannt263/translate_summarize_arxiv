    "the influence analysis problem was initiated since the introduction of the viral marketing phenomena [ 42 ] .",
    "finding influenceres is considered as many body problem in which topological features play a very important role [ 4 ] . in general",
    "topologically centralized nodes plays an important role as influencer [ 2 ] , [ 40 ] but influential phenomena is not always depends on structural centrality of the node . sometimes weakly connected nodes can be influential node . since considering the collective influence effect top influencers are low degree nodes as compare to hubs in the network [ 38 ] .",
    "activity of the node plays a very important role in influential processes , i.e. , if the nodes are hub but not active , it can not help in spreading processes .",
    "activity of the node can be quantified as many ways such as rate of in degree or out degree formation and so on .",
    "here we have considered in degree formation with temporal effect .",
    "activity of the node can also be considered how fast the node is making links with other nodes such as in case of social network how actively user is involved in commenting , liking and creating posts .",
    "activity of the node can also be considered as how many friends or followers the user is able to make in recent past . to contain this information we have made network that contains both characteristics ;",
    "such as if user a comment or like on user b s posts then there is a directed link from a to b. in the same manner if user c followed user a then there is also a link from c to a , although our data set lacks this full information .",
    "so we have created only activity based network .",
    "if we are able to identify the critical node having specific characteristics in dynamically evolving network , it will help us in solving many problems from our daily life such as epidemics outbreak [ 39 ] , advertisement [ 26 ] , precluding failure of grids or internet[1 ] , managing transport problem [ 50 ] , telecommunication network and so on .",
    "preferential attachment explains effectively growth of time evolving real time system .",
    "most recently researchers have found that the popularity of online contents like news , blog posts , videos , mobile app download [ 22 ] in online discussion forums and product reviews exhibits temporal dynamics.[52 ] , [ 27 ] has also discussed how content popularity fluctuate with time .",
    "some items grow ones while some items can again gain popularity after decay [ 8 ] . in these cases when items can gain popularity multiple times considering recent popularity will give benefit .",
    "in other way in cases when content gain popularity many times the whole item or node degree will not be a good predictor , although recent popularity gain may help as it is found in predicting future popularity gain [ 37 ] , [ 10 ] , [ 41 ] , [ 37 ] . in some network such as paper citation the rate of attracting new node decays due to aging factor [ 41 ] , [ 37 ] .",
    "therefore we can say for making prediction aging factor also matters .",
    "although in some network such as citation network the new link formation will also matter on the fact that this node has been linked with which node .",
    "in other words if a paper has been cited by a popular scientist then it s probability increases that other will cite or make link with this node",
    ".    problem of finding influential user or node in network is being studied for quite long time such as [ 28 ] , [ 13 ] , [ 38 ] .",
    "they have considered static network and did not taken into consideration temporal dynamics of the node . since we know by time how network structure are changing there for its node centrality also get affected so to consider only static view of the network is not good in knowledge discovery .",
    "node centrality may vary from network to network especially when we consider the dynamics of the node .",
    "some researchers have solved this problem using supervised classification problem such as [ 45 ] .",
    "authors in reference [ 5 ] have proposed popularity based predictors(pbp ) for predicting popular item or node using bipartite network .",
    "it is `` preferential attachment '' theory based model ; they show that instead of whole degree of the node recent degree gain is a good predictor .",
    "in addition they also proposed the novel entries in the top list those were not in past time window . further ( [ 22 ] ) also came up that recent degree of the node is a good predictor for future popularity of the node .",
    "some researchers have found the aging or decay factor also in the time evolving node s degree [ 41 ] , [ 51 ] , [ 15 ] . [",
    "12 ] , [ 30 ] .",
    "pagerank based metrics has also been exploited by many researchers .",
    "the authors in [ 29 ] applied pagerank algorithm on twitter conversational network , they have considered metrics such as acceleration of the graph also .",
    "similarly authors in [ 36 ] have proposed userrank based on the tweet relevance for user influence . [ 16 ] came up diversity - dependent influence score ( dis ) in tweeter conversational graph for user influence by exploiting the social diversity and influence propagation phenomena .",
    "it has also employed the pagerank philosophy .",
    "the authors in reference [ 14 ] have proposed `` influence rank '' based recursive concept of user influence .",
    "authors in [ 33 ] have proposed tweet correlation based financial users prediction , they supposed if user a does similar tweet than user b then they will influence each other .",
    "although this method will not apply in macro level analysis , such as if we are interested in viral node .",
    "[ 21 ] proposed three algorithm based on pagerank namely `` infrank '' , `` leadrank '' and `` discussrank '' .",
    "infrank is the ability of a user to spread information and to be re tweeted by other influential users .",
    "leadrank quantifies the ability of user to stimulate other user to re tweet and mention from other user .",
    "discussrank identifies the active users who initiate discussion and involved others in discussion by replying and initiating tweets .",
    "[ 7 ] , [ 31 ] has applied pagerank algorithm on citation data sets , they have found google pagerank and citation positively correlated . [",
    "48 ] has proposed ` twitterrank ' algorithm extension of pagerank algorithm for identifying topic based influential users in micro blogging network such as twitter.[43 ] has considered recent citation with google pagerank to predict the future citation gain of the paper . a recent work by [ 46 ] has solved this problem by considering information flow pattern in the network .",
    "authors in reference [ 47 ] have solved this problem considering static network and exploiting k - core decomposition method .",
    "in this script we have given a model to find top - k emerging influential nodes in evolving network .",
    "we have modeled the problem by taking snapshot of the network at different time .",
    "snap shot contains all the information of the link before time @xmath0 only .",
    "the prediction problem is , considering node @xmath1 in any system at time @xmath0 and past time window @xmath2 , predicting the ranking of the node after future time window @xmath3 on the basis of number of links it has received in past time window @xmath2 .",
    "so in case of user item bipartite network [ 31 ] , [ 44 ] , [ 17 ] we can consider how many user have bought / rated as receiving link of the node @xmath1 . in case of other directed network , how many link node @xmath1 has received .",
    "so the prediction problem can be defined as given snap shot of the network at time @xmath0 and past time window @xmath2 we have to predict node s ranking in future at @xmath4 time on the basis of links received during @xmath5 , where @xmath3 is future time window .",
    "second we have to predict the novel entries or emerging influential node that were not in top @xmath6 list before time @xmath7 .",
    "pagerank given by [ 6 ] was developed to rank webpages on internet for google search engine optimization purpose .",
    "it can be applied in other networks also where structural property of the node plays an important role such as information diffusion [ 48 ] , scientific paper / author ranking [ 43 ] etc .",
    "pagerank has also been applied on bipartite network [ 3 ] , [ 19 ] pagerank algorithm can be given as follows:- if site @xmath8 have link to site @xmath9 there will be a directed link between node @xmath8 and node @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "if page / node @xmath9 has @xmath11 set of link to other pages / nodes then page will distribute its importance in @xmath12(number of nodes in set @xmath13 ) nodes equally .",
    "the transition matrix of a graph @xmath14 can be given as follows-    @xmath15    since there can be pages that do not have link to other pages although they are being pointed by other page , also known as _ dangling nodes _ , so new transformed matrix can be given as-    @xmath16    where @xmath17 matrix have all the elements zero except for * dangling nodes * column which are @xmath18 where @xmath6 is the number of rows or nodes in matrix . easy to find that those columns are normalized that sums to one for making column stochastic matrix",
    ". now the pagerank of _ dangling nodes _ will not be zero .",
    "since random surfer will follow the link from one page to another , suppose that random surfer follows the pagerank ( follows s ) with probability @xmath19 then there is ( @xmath20 ) probability that he will choose a random page .",
    "so now pagerank matrix also known as google matrix @xmath21 can be given as-    @xmath22    where @xmath23 is matrix of size @xmath24 , it s every element as one . since * google matrix *",
    "@xmath21 is combination of stochastic matrix and all the entries are positive which implies that m is primitive and irreducible .",
    "so pagerank vector @xmath25 can be calculated using power method as @xmath26 it will eventually converge to a static vector which is pagerank .",
    "importance of node depends on structural position as well as activity ( e.g rate of link formation ) of the node .",
    "if node is not active in current recent time it s structural centrality have no value in some context such as information spread .",
    "a webpage might be ranked high due to other important webpages are pointing to it but if people are not clicking on the link after recommendation it means it is not an important page at least in temporal sense .",
    "so to develop a good model for predicting influential node we have considered both characteristics in our model .",
    "@xmath27    where @xmath28 predicted rating score of node @xmath1 at time @xmath0 given past time window @xmath29 , @xmath30 structural centrality metric of node such as degree , closeness , pagerank at time @xmath0 etc and @xmath31 is dynamic centrality of the node at time @xmath0 given some past time window @xmath29 such as [ 51 ] , [ 5 ] , [ 32 ] has given model considering node s activity .",
    "@xmath31 can vary according to need such as in webpage ranking structural property can be pagerank while dynamic centrality can be a score based on it s click over time .",
    "pagerank is one of the best model that considers structural feature of the network so we have considered pagerank as structural centrality metric .",
    "the pagerank code is given by [ 34 ] .",
    "the original pagerank algorithm was given by [ 6 ] .",
    "the dynamic metric we have considered given by [ 51 ] .",
    "although the generic model above can be implemented according to need of the problem such as if we care about a critical node to prevent the node damage , we can use betweenness centrality as a structural centrality and dynamic centrality as it s ` work done ' such as in case of internet router network and power grid network .",
    "here we are considering pagerank as structural metric since it s wide application in different areas such as academic articles and authors [ 7 ] , [ 11 ] , [ 49 ] , image ranking [ 24 ] , urban road ranking [ 23 ] , protein interaction network [ 20 ] , software ranking on the basis of procedure call network ( pcn ) , since large software contains many procedures that call to each other [ 9 ] so our one of specific model is as following we name it m1 .    @xmath32    where k is a normalization constant which normalizes the score of all node which sums to 1 .",
    "here @xmath33 is the time when node @xmath1 received link , @xmath2 is the past time window .",
    "@xmath34 is decay rate , @xmath35 is pagerank score of the node @xmath1 , n is the set of rest of the node from which n has received link .",
    "@xmath36 condition tells that we consider only link that is formed after @xmath7 time .",
    "considering only recent activity ( @xmath2 ) of the node saves computation cost since in real time network size is very large .",
    "we are considering in degree of the node one can consider out degree also if activity of the node is based on out degree .",
    "since from the above model if the node is not receiving any link after time ( @xmath37 ) , its score will be zero . to overcome this weakness we assume even if node has not received any link during past time window @xmath2 there is a probability of getting new link in future according to its structural centrality .",
    "suppose probability of a node for getting in - links depends on recent gain in new links then we can say probability ( @xmath38 ) given past time window @xmath2 ) of node @xmath1 at time @xmath0 of getting links in future is -    @xmath39    so predicted rating score @xmath28 of a node can be given as follows-    @xmath40    where l is a normalization constant which normalizes the score of all node which sums to 1 .",
    "the above predictor makes sure that even if node has not received any link in recent past it will be ranked according to its structural centrality .",
    "although nodes which are more structurally central , and also active in recent past will be given more score .",
    "in addition if node s structural centrality is not high but recently it is very active then score will also be high which is why we call it `` strength of a weak node '' .",
    "such as in case of web page ranking if we want to consider both the centrality .",
    "if in any system people follows rich get richer phenomena as well as recent behavior",
    ". then we can model as follows , suppose with probability @xmath41 they follow already popular node or item and with probability @xmath42 they will follow recent behaviors of their peers . such as in case of author citation network people do care about scientists popularity and also if any new scientist does a potential discovery . in a system where people follow recent behaviors of their peers the model in equation ( 4 ) will be a good predictor for future popularity gain of the node .",
    "although it can be modeled as recent degree gain also , since if people follow recent behavior then recent degree gain `` must '' be a good predictor for future popularity or link gain of the node .",
    "we have considered decay effect because nodes in most of the time evolving systems show competition for getting links which causes aging effect in other nodes .",
    "introduction of aging phenomena helps in identifying emerging influential nodes .    @xmath43    where m is a normalization constant which normalizes the score of all node which sums to 1 .",
    "we have used netflix data set the original netflix data has @xmath44 users , @xmath45 ratings and @xmath46 objects .",
    "the original facebook data set have @xmath47 , @xmath48 objects and @xmath49 links . while data preparation we have sampled small subset from each by randomly choosing users who have rated at least @xmath50 movies .",
    "the original rating was in the form of numerical @xmath51 , we have considered the link between the user and object which object have received higher than two ratings .",
    "for all the three data sets facebook , movielens and netflix the time is considered in days . in case of facebook if user has posted / like or commented on other user s wall there will be a link between the user and the wall .",
    "the link between user and its own wall post have not been considered to avoid self - influence .",
    "the data description after cleaning process -    * * netflix * data contains @xmath52 users,@xmath53 movies and @xmath54 links , data was collected during(1st jan @xmath55 @xmath56 dec 2005 ) . * * movielens * data set contains @xmath57 movies , @xmath58 links and @xmath59 users and data was collected during(@xmath60 jan @xmath61 @xmath60 jan 2005 ) . * * facebook * data contains @xmath62 set of users and their @xmath63 wall post activity and @xmath64 links , during period of ( 14 sep @xmath65@xmath66 jan @xmath67 ) .",

    "<S> identifying emerging influential or popular node / item in future on network is a current interest of the researchers . </S>",
    "<S> most of previous works focus on identifying leaders in time evolving networks on the basis of network structure or node s activity separate way . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we have proposed a hybrid model which considers both , node s structural centrality and recent activity of nodes together . </S>",
    "<S> we consider that the node is active when it is receiving more links in a given recent time window , rather than in the whole past life of the node . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore our model is flexible to implement structural rank such as pagerank and webpage click information as activity of the node . for testing the performance of our model </S>",
    "<S> , we adopt the pagerank algorithm and linear preferential attachment based model as the baseline methods . </S>",
    "<S> experiments on three real data sets ( i.e movielens , netflix and facebook wall post data set ) , we found that our model shows better performance in terms of finding the emerging influential nodes that were not popular in past . </S>"
