    "some evidences suggest that swift j1644 + 57 is a tidal disruption of a star by a supermassive black hole ( smbh ) .",
    "this phenomenon triggered the bat three times after the initial trigger during the first few days @xcite .",
    "the late - time x - ray light curve was extended to a longer period by following the expected power - law decay for the tidal disruption of a star , i.e. , @xmath12 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "finally , the source of x - ray , ir , and radio emissions were well matched up with the center of the host galaxy where a smbh resides @xcite .",
    "there have been many studies performed to understand the nature of this event , such as the characteristics of the star that was disrupted .",
    "such a question is closely connected to the smbh mass ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "the disruption of a solar - type star is possible for all @xmath14 @xcite , but compact stars like a white dwarf can be disrupted only if @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "if so , then this kind of event provides the interesting possibility of discovering intermediate - mass black holes .",
    "unfortunately , there has been controversy concerning the mass of the smbh .",
    "@xcite provided a rough estimate of the smbh mass of @xmath16 using a black hole mass  luminosity relation and the lower limit of @xmath17 based on the x - ray variability .",
    "similarly , @xcite estimated @xmath13 to be @xmath18 ",
    "@xmath19 , derived from @xmath10-band luminosity , but at that time , @xmath10-band luminosity contained a significant amount of the transient light .",
    "@xcite utilized a relation between the black hole mass , the radio luminosity , and the x - ray luminosity , and found @xmath13 @xmath20 . using a quasi - periodic oscillation resonance hypothesis ,",
    "@xcite provided an @xmath13 estimate of @xmath21 .",
    "@xcite concluded that a white dwarf was tidally disrupted and the mass of smbh is less than @xmath22 in light of the short timescales of the x - ray light curve . in summary ,",
    "the @xmath13 estimates have centered around the two discrepant values of @xmath19 and @xmath22 or less . a better understanding of the host galaxy properties is needed to clear up the situation .",

    "@xmath65 is a variable parameter denpendent on @xmath64 , where @xmath66 and @xmath67 correspond to the de vaucouleurs and exponential profiles , respectively .",
    "although @xmath66 is commonly quoted for the ellipticals and classical bulges , the srsic index of ellipticals and classical bulges can assume a value in the range @xmath68 , whereas pseudobulges have @xmath69 @xcite .",

    ", the single exponential disk model provides a poor fit to the data as shown in figure 2 and with @xmath75 .",
    "the double exponential profile model fits the data nearly as well as the single srsic model and the srsic bulge+disk model in terms of @xmath76 .",
    "however , the analysis of the one - dimensional surface brightness profile shows that the model does not follow the outer part of the profile well , demonstrating a relatively steeper decline than that of the single srsic model and the srsic bulge @xmath71 exponential disk model .",

    "to estimate the transient component flux , we fit all the f606w and f160w images with a model containing both the point source ( transient ) and the host galaxy components . here",
    ", we adopt a single srsic profile with a fixed srsic index ( @xmath108 ) for the host galaxy component , and a psf profile for the transient component .",
    "the compactness of the host galaxy and the bright transient component in the f160w images create a serious degeneracy , particularly between the effective radius and the srsic index , when fitting multi - component models . to alleviate the degeneracy , we fixed the srsic index to be @xmath108 , similar to that of the f606w band .",
    "the flux fractions of the models as a function of time are shown in figure  [ hstfig ] .",

    "the point source contribution declines rapidly as time goes on in f160w , but it contributes to the total flux of the object until around @xmath109 days . on the other hand , the fluxes of the host galaxy component are almost constant in both bands over the entire period .",

    "the behaviors of these nir light curves are very similar to that of the x - ray light curve except that the x - ray light curve appears shifted ahead of the nir light curves at a time of @xmath11715 days .",
    "the similar shapes of these light curves indicate that the origins of the x - ray emission and nir emission are related to each other . on the other hand , the time gap between these two emissons denotes that the x - ray source and nir source are separated from each other as much as the time gap .",
    "@xcite suggested that x - ray source is in the close vicinity of the black hole due to the fact that the x - ray emission shows very rapid , high variability , while the ir and the radio sources are located a large distance from the black hole on account of the relatively smooth and small variability .",
    "they argued that the jet generated by black hole collides with the surrounding medium where the electrons are accelerated by the jet .",
    "these high - speed electrons emit the ir to radio photons through synchrotron radiation .",

    "tight scaling relations have been derived between smbh mass and several physical properties of the bulges ( velocity dispersion , mass , luminosity , etc . ) in many previous studies @xcite .",
    "some argue that ellipticals and classical bulges follow identical relations , while the pseudobulges follow a somewhat different relation with large scatter @xcite .",
    "we conclude from the best - fit galaxy models that the host galaxy of _ swift _ j1644 + 57 has a classical bulge , and have also found a minor possibility of the pseudobulge with b / t=@xmath173 . for now , we consider only the best model , that is , the case of the host galaxy having a classical bulge and being bulge - dominant .     and",

    "[ bhfig ] ]    in order to esimate the central smbh mass in the host galaxy of _ swift _ j1644 + 57 , we used the scaling relation between @xmath13 and the stellar mass of the bulge ( @xmath8 ) .",

    "the estimated mass of the smbh is @xmath178 based on the stellar mass of the host galaxy and the above relation . if we consider the b / t=0.83 and assume that the mass - to - light ratio is constant in the bulge and disk , the stellar mass is decreased by @xmath179 dex .",
    "it leads to a decrease in @xmath7 by @xmath179 dex .",
    "the tight scaling relations between @xmath7 and host galaxy properties suggest a close link between the smbh growth and the galaxy evolution . there may be a cosmic evolution of the scaling relations , for which there have been various studies @xcite .",
    "the evolution of the scaling relations is still controversial in terms of the selection effects in the high redshift regime .",
    "nevertheless , we can consider a case where the growth of @xmath7 happened ahead of the assembly of the stellar mass as suggested by some of these studies .",
    "@xcite suggest the redshift evolution out to @xmath180 , in the form of @xmath181 , based on 11 x - ray - selected broadline agns . considering this evolution effect and the redshift of _ swift _",
    "j1644 + 57 @xmath182 , the mass of the smbh could be larger by @xmath183 dex .",
    "we also estimated @xmath7 through the @xmath7 ",
    "@xmath10 band luminosity of bulge ( @xmath184 ) relation in @xcite , assuming that most of the nir fluxes come from the bulge .",
    "their relation is much improved compared with previous studies in view of serveral things .",
    "they excluded galaxies with black hole monsters which have over - massive smbhs despite having relatively small bulges and ellipticals .",
    "they also omitted galaxies with black hole masses that are measured based on the kinematics of ionized gas without taking line widths into account , since this method may yield underestimated masses .",
    "galaxies in the process of merging generally have low - mass black holes for their luminosities .",
    "thus they excluded these galaxies from the relation .",
    "they also did not include pseudobulges .",
    "the relation of @xcite is @xmath185 where the @xmath160 is @xmath186 , the @xmath164 is @xmath187 , and intrinsic scatters is 0.30 .",
    "@xmath188 is the @xmath10-band absolute magnitude of the bulge based on the photometric system of 2mass . using the best - fit sed derived earlier , we applied k - correction and evolution correction .",
    "we find @xmath189 vega mag including the evolutionary correction of 1.38 mag , which is derived by the difference in the @xmath10-band magnitude between 0.63 gyr old population as in table  [ sed2tab ] and 4.5 gyr old population , which is the age of this host galaxy in the local universe .",
    "then , the mass of the smbh is estimated to be @xmath190 . if we take b / t=0.83 into account and assume that this value is also applicable to the nir bands , then @xmath7 decreases by @xmath179 dex .",
    "if we use an @xmath191 value that has not been corrected for evolution , then @xmath7 becomes @xmath192 dex larger .",
    "the tidal disruption of normal stars by a black hole is not possible for @xmath193 , since the tidal radius where the disruption can occur is located inside the schwarzschild radius @xcite .",
    "our results on the mass of the smbh satisfy the condition for a tidal disruption event .",
    "although we favor the model in which the host galaxy of _ swift _ j1644 + 57 is a classical bulge , our analysis shows that it could be a galaxy with a pseudobulge with b / t=0.36 ( table  [ galfittab ] ) .",
    "if so , it is rather difficult to obtain an @xmath13 value , since the scaling relation is not well established for pseudobulges , especially in the low mass range of @xmath194 for the host galaxy .",
    "several works have shown that the @xmath195  host galaxy scaling relations are weak or zero with a large scatter for pseudobulges . over the @xmath196 range of @xmath197 to @xmath198 where such a relation has been studied",
    ", @xmath13 can have any value between @xmath199 to @xmath200 ( figure 21 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . to reach down to @xmath201 as implied from the pseudobulge fit of our data ,",
    "currently one can barely do so by relying on results from low mass agns @xcite .",
    "in such a case , an @xmath13 value between @xmath202 to @xmath203 is possible ( figure 32 of * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "overall , if the host galaxy harbors a pseudobulge , then we can only loosely constrain @xmath13 to have a value between @xmath202 to @xmath19 considering our current poor knowledge of the @xmath13 value in pseudobulges .",
    "it is also known that a small fraction of pseudobulges have a srsic index of @xmath204 .",
    "the best example is pox 52 , for which @xmath205  @xmath206 , @xmath207 , and @xmath208 @xcite . therefore , even if we accept the srsic index of @xmath108 as the best - fit result , we need to keep this kind of caveat in mind .",
    "figure  [ bhfig ] shows our overall results on @xmath7 and the results from the previous studies we mentioned in  [ sec : intro ] .",
    "it shows that our favorite results are compatible with the previous rough estimates from @xcite and @xcite , who also used scaling relations .",
    "however , our results are improved compared to the previous results , by revealing that the host galaxy has a significant bulge component through a two - dimensional bulge + disk decomposition of the surface brightness profile , and removing the transient component in nir light using a long - term light curve .",
    "the @xmath13 limit could be much looser ( the dashed line ) if the host galaxy harbors a pseudobulge .",
    "a critical test of the pseudobulge model would be to obtain a deep , high - resolution image to see how the surface brightness profile behaves at the outer region of the host galaxy . +",
