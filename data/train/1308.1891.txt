    "dusty spirals have been recently discovered to be common nuclear structures ( within the inner kpc ) of active galaxies @xcite .",
    "these compact spirals have been suggested to be possible mechanisms to channel gas inwards to fuel the nuclear supermassive black hole ( smbh , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with some recent observational work supporting such hypothesis @xcite .",
    "most nuclear spiral arms seem not to have associated star formation and show low density constrasts , unlike the larger spiral arms in the disks of the galaxies .",
    "the dust structures in these arms seem to be signatures of shock fronts of waves propagating in non self - gravitating circumnuclear gas @xcite .    in a previous study ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper i ) , we have reported the discovery of a two - armed nuclear spiral in a narrow - band h@xmath9 image of the active galaxy arp102b obtained with the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) acs camera . the origin of the nuclear spiral has been speculated to be the interaction with the companion galaxy arp102a @xcite and could also be tracing inflows triggered by this interaction .",
    "an image of the two galaxies does indeed show a tidal arm originating in the gas rich spiral galaxy arp102a which connects with arp102b from the north - east .",
    "nevertheless , in paper i , we also found that the spiral arm to the east ( the other is to the west ) is spatially correlated with a bent radio jet , suggesting that the spiral could be the result of the interaction of a radio jet with circumnuclear gas at the galaxy .",
    "the first detection of radio emission was made by @xcite , but it was found to have a jet - like structure only later by @xcite .",
    "these authors were not able to determine the radio emission mechanism .",
    "@xcite , studying the pair arp 102a and arp 102b , demonstrated that the radio jet was originated in an agn , rather than in a starburst , since its brightness temperature ( @xmath10k ) is too high to be due to starburst emission , whose values are at most @xmath11k . in paper",
    "i , we concluded that , in order to gauge the jet impact on the circumnuclear gas it would be necessary to map the gas excitation and kinematics .",
    "such a study would also provide constraints on the nature of the ionizing source as well as on the presence of outflows and/or inflows along the spiral arms , allowing us to investigate their nature .",
    "this is the goal of the present study .",
    "one particular characteristic of the active nucleus of arp 102b is the presence of very broad ( @xmath310,000kms ) and double - peaked balmer lines in its optical spectra .",
    "in fact , arp 102b is considered to be the prototypical `` double - peaker '' @xcite .",
    "the arp 102b nucleus is classified as a liner / seyfert 1 being more luminous but other than that similar to the one in ngc 1097 @xcite .",
    "arp 102b is classified as an e0 galaxy , thus the presence of the gaseous spiral arms was unexpected .",

    "away from the nucleus , the highest densities are observed along the east spiral arm , with an average value of about 500@xmath4 , but presenting two knots of higher density values at its northern and eastern borders .",
    "these knots seem to bound the region covered by the bent radio jet .",
    "in particular , a radio knot at 0@xmath148 east of the nucleus occurs adjacent ( below in fig .",
    "[ red ] ) to a high - density knot , suggesting that this high density knot may have deflected the radio jet , leading to its bent appearance .",
    "error values for the gas density are displayed in the right panel of fig .",
    "the density errors , in percent scale , are highest towards the borders of the ifu - fov .",
    "these uncertainties originate from flux errors measured with the monte carlo iterations , illustrating that measurements close to the borders of the fov are not reliable enough to estimate the gas density . however , the errors are small enough around the nucleus and in the high density knot , that they do not compromise our interpretation in these regions .    the presence of high density knots along the east spiral arm , as well as the radio knot 0@xmath148 east of the nucleus , combined with the high velocity dispersions observed along the east arm up to the radio knot ( right top and middle panels of fig . [ velocidade ] )",
    "support at least some contribution from shocks to the gas ionization in this region , leading to liner - like emission - line ratios .",
    "the gas excitaton with liner - like line ratios could be due to shocks or diluted radiation .",
    "although the velocity dispersion maps shows no unusual high values in the region , the scenario including shocks can not be ruled out , once the dispersion is not negligible along the spiral arms .",
    "we have also considered the possibility that the low [ oiii]/h@xmath20 values were due to the presence of a star forming region in the east spiral arm , but this hypothesis can be discarded , as the high [ nii]6584/h@xmath9 and [ oi]6584/h@xmath9 ratios are much larger than those observed in hii regions .",
    "[ velocidade ] shows that the centroid velocity fields suggest rotation , with redshifts to the west and blueshifts to the east .",
    "nevertheless , the isovelocity curves are distorted relative to the well known `` spider diagram '' ( characteristic of rotation ) , and a possible interpretation is a combination of gas rotation and outflow .",
    "the apparent s - shape of the central isovelocity curves could be due to the presence of what seems to be a `` blob '' of blueshifted line emission at @xmath88 south - east of the nucleus ( to the left of the nucleus in fig .",
    "[ velocidade ] ) with negative velocities in excess of @xmath89 in the h@xmath9 centroid velocity map .",
    "this `` blob '' could be interpreted as due to an outflow which could also explain the high velocity dispersions observed at its location . although not conspicuous in the channel maps as a detached structure , the blueshifted channel maps between velocities @xmath90 and @xmath89do show an extension to the south - east , at the location of this blob .",
    "another interesting feature of the centroid velocity maps is a region of lower blueshifts  co - spatial with the radio jet  surrounded by higher blueshifts . in the channel maps we see",
    "that although the jet region is dominated by blueshifts , there are also some redshifts observed at the same locations",
    ". this could be due to a broad outflow launched close to the plane of the sky , with the front part approaching and the back part receding , but slightly tilted toward us , so that the centroid velocities would still show blueshifts , but lower than the surrounding rotation velocities .",
    "thus the highest blueshifts to the east and highest redshifts to the west could be due to rotation , while the intermediate blueshifts and redshifts to the east would include the contribution from the front and back walls of the outflow .          in order to try to separate the contributions of possible rotation and outflow to the velocity field , we fitted a rotation model to the h@xmath9 centroid velocity map , assuming that the emitting gas is rotating in a central potential , as we have done in previous works @xcite . in this kinematic model",

    "the systemic velocity resulting from the modelling is close to the average value we adopted as systemic ( sec .",

    "the masked region is the only one with values larger than @xmath110 in the residual map .",
    "this indicates that our hypothesis of combined rotation and outflow in the blueshifted `` blob '' is a good representation of the data .",
    "a small redshifted region in the residual map ( residuals of @xmath111 ) , located to the right ( north - west ) of the nucleus , suggests the presence of a redshifted blob which could be the counterpart for the blueshifted `` blob '' , in the hyphotesis they are due to a bipolar outflow .",
    "[ vmodf ] shows that the rotation model is a good representation of the gas centroid velocity kinematics , and that the disk seems to be very inclined . in order to try to determine which is the near and far sides of the disk , we have looked for possible signatures of dust obscuration , which is usually larger in the near side of an inclined disk .",
    "dust lanes can be highlighted via structure maps @xcite , in which high contrast regions  such as those resulting from dust obscuration or high emission structures  can be enhanced , appearing as dark and bright regions , respectively .",

    ". a dark lane to the north - east of the nucleus running approximately east - west ( passing to the right of the nucleus in the figure ) could be due to extinction by dust in the near side of a highly inclined disk .",
    "the dust lane thus seems to support a high inclination for the rotating disk , as derived from our rotation model ( 79@xmath15 ) . and suggest that the spiral arms are not all in the disk , as they would not be visible at such high inclination .",
    "our hypothesis is that the jet is launched close to the plane of the sky and of the line of nodes of the rotating disk , then suffers a deflection to high latitudes relative to the rotating gas disk , dragging along gas from the disk .    in order to have more elements to interpret the overall kinematics",
    ", we decided to apply a pca analysis to the ifu data @xcite in a similar way as described in the previous study by members of our group of the gas kinematics of the nuclear region of m81 @xcite .",
    "the pca has been applied directly to the calibrated datacube separating the information , originally presented in a system of correlated coordinates , into a system of uncorrelated coordinates ordered by principal components of decreasing variance .",
    "these new coordinates called `` eigenspectra '' reveal spatial correlations and anti - correlations in the emission - line data .",
    "the projection of the data onto these new coordinates produce images called `` tomograms '' , which map the spatial distribution of the eigenspectra .",
    "the result of the pca is shown in fig .",
    "[ pca ] . from top",
    "to bottom the panels show the tomograms ( to the left ) and respective eigenspectra ( to the right ) , in order of decreasing variance .",
    "component pc1 , which carries the largest variance ( 97.9% ) , shows an eigen - spectrum dominated by the agn and the stellar continuum contribution , represented by the positive values in the eigenspectrum and showing a circularly symmetric spatial distribution in the corresponding tomogram .",
    "component pc2 is dominated by the contribution of the broad - line emission , originating in the nucleus  the red region of the tomogram , being spatially anti - correlated with the stellar population , which originates from the blue region ( circumnuclear region ) in the tomogram .",
    "the anti - correlation is revealed by the inverted stellar population features ( which appear in emission ) in the eigenspectrum ( e.g. the nai@xmath135890 and mg@xmath135175 absorption features characteristic of stellar populations ) .",
    "this eigenspectrum shows little contribution from the [ nii ] , h@xmath9 and [ sii ] emission lines , being remarkably similar to the stis nuclear spectrum ( see fig .",
    "[ large ] ) .",
    "we interpret this as being due to the smaller aperture of the stis spectrum , which is dominated by the broad h@xmath9 component .",
    "the pca has thus separated this nuclear component from the more extended narrow line emission in our datacube , even though our ifu data has a much smaller angular resolution than the stis data .",
    "this demonstrates the power of the pca technique @xcite .",
    "this eigenspectrum also shows that there is some [ oiii ] and [ oi ] emission originating in the same region as that of the broad h@xmath9 , or at least much closer to the nucleus than the other emission lines .",
    "the pc3 eigenspectrum shows narrow lines anti - correlated ( in absorption ) with the broad component of h@xmath9 ( in emission ) .",
    "this broad component originates in the red region of the tomogram , while the narrow lines correspond to blue regions in the tomogram .",
    "the narrow emission lines thus originate in two blobs , one more extended to the east and one less extended to the west of the nucleus , coinciding with the location of the beginning of the spiral arms .",
    "notice that there is no velocity gradient in the emission lines , indicating that the two blobs originate in gas at similar velocities .",
    "one possibility is that these blobs are due to gas being ejected close to the plane of the sky .",
    "this result supports the hypothesis put forth in the previous section that the jet is launched close to the plane of the sky ( approximately along the major axis of the rotating disk ) and that these blobs correspond to the inner parts of the outflows pushed by the radio jet .",
    "the pc4 eigenspectrum shows the narrow lines with components in blueshift ( in absorption ) , spatially anticorrelated with components in redshift ( in emission ) .",
    "the tomogram shows that the components in blueshift originate to the south - east of the nucleus , while the redshifted component originates to the north - west of the nucleus .",
    "the blueshifted region is very well aligned with the blueshifted `` blob '' .",
    "the counterpart structure observed in redshift has also been previously seen in the residual map of the velocity rotation model .",
    "both the blueshifted and redshifted regions show high velocity dispersions , and we propose that they are due to a bipolar outflow , almost perpendicular to the radio jet .",
    "another possible interpretation for such a feature is a compact rotating disk , smaller than the one observed in the centroid velocity maps",
    ". the disk would be almost perpendicular to the radio jet , suggesting that it could be a mechanism of fuelling the agn .",
    "the broad component that appears in the pc3 eigenspectrum is extended in an apparent bipolar distribution which is centered on the nucleus and oriented approximately se - nw , with the nw side the stronger .",
    "the most plausible explanation for this feature is that it represents scattered light from the broad - line region .",
    "it is also notable that this pc3 feature is approximately co - spatial , though slightly misaligned , with the structure in pc4 , which we identify as a bipolar outflow .",
    "this suggests that the broad pc3 feature is associated with scattering of broad - line emission in the outflow , with the spatial distribution indicating that the strongest scattering occurs in the redshifted ( receding ) side of the flow .",
    "the misalignment between the pc3 and pc4 structures also suggests that in both the blue and redshifted sides , the scattering is concentrated along one edge of the flow ( the eastern edge of the blueshifted flow and the western edge of the redshifted flow , respectively ) .",
    "this may be due to a density gradient across the flow .",
    "the outflow axis is approximately perpendicular to the line of nodes of the large scale rotating gas disk , the northern side of which we believe to be the nearside .",
    "this implies that the blue and redshifted sides of the outflow are in front of and behind the disk , respectively , with their the eastern and western edges being closest to the disk .",
    "the interpretation of the broad - line scattering obviously argues against the scenario of a rotating disk for pc3 .",
    "support for the bipolar outflow interpretation comes from spectropolarimetric observations of arp102b @xcite , which show that the broad h@xmath9 line is polarized with a position angle ( @xmath112 ) closely aligned with that of the radio jet .",
    "as scattering produces polarization perpendicular to the scattering plane ( i.e. , the plane containing both the incident and scattered rays ) , this is consistent with scattering in a structure elongated perpendicular to the radio jet axis , as suggested by the pc3 eigenspectrum .",
    "@xcite modelled the asymmetric double - peaked broad h@xmath9 line profile as emission from a relativistically rotating disk . adopting this model to represent the intrinsic line profile",
    ", @xcite showed that the shape of the broad h@xmath9 profile in polarized flux is well reproduced by scattering in a bipolar outflow ( see their fig .",
    "4 ) . @xcite assumed the scattering outflow to be aligned with the radio axis , and noted that in this case the polarization position angle should be perpendicular to the jet axis , contrary to what is observed .",
    "however , the observed alignment can be understood if the bipolar outflow is , in fact , perpendicular to the jet axis .",
    "we conclude that not only the pc3 and pc4 eigenspectra but also the broad h@xmath9 polarization are strongly suggesting a bipolar outflow which emits narrow lines and scatters nuclear broad - line emission .",
    "remarkably , the axis of this outflow , as determined both from the pca tomograms and from the polarization angle , must be approximately perpendicular to that of the radio source .",
    "we note that @xcite invoked a somewhat similar structure to explain the pca eigenspectra of their ifu data cube covering the center of the elliptical galaxy ngc7097 . in that case ,",
    "a pca eigenspectrum identified with the liner nucleus is attributed to scattering in an ionization bicone aligned with the axis of a rotating disk . unlike arp102b",
    ", however , there is no ( known ) radio jet and no optical polarimetry from which additional geometrical constraints might be obtained .",
    "two sets of perpendicular outflows have been observed previously in other targets , such as markarian 6 @xcite .",
    "this could be the case here : we are seeing a new outflow perpendicular to the first due to precession of a nuclear jet .",
    "in fact , seyfert galaxies have short - lived outflows ( @xmath113-@xmath11 years ) since the smbh spin - axes change frequently and the accretion disks are short - lived @xcite .          in paper",
    "i , we attributed the one - sidedness of the radio jet of arp 102b to relativistic boosting . even though our ifu observations favor a scenario where",
    "the jet is being launched close to the plane of the sky , we should still consider the interpretation of relativistic boosting , since we observe a bending of the jet about @xmath114 from the nucleus , probably towards our line - of - sight .",
    "it is possible , if the twin jets have different intrinsic powers , that an asymmetric density distribution in the surrounded interstellar medium can cause a disruption of the counter - jet .",
    "this could be supported by our density map ( fig .",
    "[ red ] ) , as long as this occurs within few hundred parsecs from the nucleus , where the gas density is highest . nevertheless , our data seems unsufficient to distinguish between these models .",
    "further radio observations , perhaps in several frequencies , would better constrain these possibilities .",
    "we estimated the mass of the ionized gas as :    @xmath115    where @xmath116 is the volume of the emitting region , @xmath117 is the filling factor , @xmath118 is the electron density and @xmath119 is the proton mass .    from @xcite , assuming case b recombination , we obtain :    @xmath120    where @xmath121 is the h@xmath20 luminosity in units of @xmath122 erg s@xmath12 and @xmath123 is the electron density in units of @xmath124 @xmath4 .",

    "we estimate the mass outflow rate for the first , stronger outflow , as it seems to have a much larger associated mass .    in order",
    "to estimate the mass outflow rate , we need to adopt geometric parameters for the outflow .",
    "the derivation of such parameters is a hard task , once there are projection effects and the outflow geometry is not clear .",
    "we have assumed a truncated conical geometry ( conical frustrum ) in which the nucleus is at the smaller base , which is a circle with a diameter of @xmath134 .",
    "the larger base ( at the outer end of the outflow ) is a circle with a diameter of @xmath135 , distant @xmath132 from the smaller base .",

    "the area of the top base , crossed by the outflow is @xmath137 , where @xmath138 ( @xmath139 pc ) , thus @xmath140@xmath141 .",

    "the observed geometry and low velocity for the outflow , as well as the pca results , suggest that the angle between the outflow and the plane of the sky is small .",
    "the fact that both blueshifts and redshifts are observed in the region of the outflow ( see fig .",

    "is that they are solely due to lateral expansion of ambient gas in a cocoon around the radio jet @xcite .",
    "blueshifts and redshifts would originate from the walls of the cocoon moving towards and away from the observer , in agreement with those observed in the channel maps .",
    "also , in this case , the velocity of the outflow should be smaller than previously estimated . under the assumption that the speed of the forward expansion along the radio jet is approximately the same as that of the lateral expansion we have calculated the mass outflow rate for @xmath162of @xmath163 assuming the geometry to be a truncated cone , and @xmath164 in the case where the outflow is shaped as a complete cone .",
    "if the gas emission is solely due to the cocoon , one may expect the emitting structure to be hollow .",

    "the jet , launched approximately along the line of nodes of the rotating disk , gets deflected to high disk latitudes in a high density gas knot , dragging along gas located in the disk , forming the spiral arms .",

    "<S> we present a two - dimensional analysis of the gaseous excitation and kinematics of the inner 2.5@xmath01.7kpc@xmath1 of the liner / seyfert1 galaxy arp102b , from optical spectra obtained with the gmos integral field spectrograph on the gemini north telescope at a spatial resolution of @xmath2pc . </S>",
    "<S> emission - line flux maps show the same two - armed nuclear spiral we have discovered in previous observations with the hst - acs camera . </S>",
    "<S> one arm reaches 1kpc to the east and the other 500pc to the west , with a 8.4 ghz vla bent radio jet correlating with the former . </S>",
    "<S> gas excitation along the arms is low , with line ratios typical of liners , and which rule out gas ionization by stars . </S>",
    "<S> the gas density is highest ( @xmath3500 - 900@xmath4 ) at the nucleus and in the northern border of the east arm , at a region where the radio jet seems to be deflected . </S>",
    "<S> centroid velocity maps suggest that most gas is in rotation in an inclined disk with line of nodes along position angle @xmath5 , redshifts to the west and blueshifts to the east , with lower blueshifts correlated with the eastern arm and radio jet . </S>",
    "<S> this correlation suggests that the jet is interacting with gas in the disk . </S>",
    "<S> this interaction is supported by the gas excitation as a function of distance from the nucleus , which requires the contribution from shocks . </S>",
    "<S> channel maps show blueshifts but also some redshifts at the eastern arm and jet location which can be interpreted as originated in the front and back walls of an outflow pushed by the radio jet , suggesting also that the outflow is launched close to the plane of the sky . </S>",
    "<S> principal component analysis applied to our data supports this interpretation . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate a mass outflow rate along the east arm of @xmath6 ( depending on the assumed outflow geometry ) , which is between one and two orders of magnitude higher than the mass accretion rate to the active nucleus , implying that there is mass - loading of the nuclear outflow from circumnuclear gas . </S>",
    "<S> the power of this outflow is @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> we propose a scenario in which gas has been recently captured by arp 102b in an interaction with arp 102a , settling in a disk rotating around the nucleus of arp 102b and triggering its nuclear activity . </S>",
    "<S> a nuclear jet is pushing the circumnuclear gas , giving origin to the nuclear arms . </S>",
    "<S> a blueshifted emitting gas knot is observed at @xmath8pc south - east from the nucleus and can be interpreted as another ( more compact ) outflow , with a possible counterpart to the north - west .    </S>",
