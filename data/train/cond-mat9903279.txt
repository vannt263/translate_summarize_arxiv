    "recent experimental development on the carbon nanotubes , especially electronic transport measurements for individual nanotubes , @xcite has promoted much interest in the nanotubes as one - dimensional conductor with nanometer size .",
    "@xcite many experimental works concern the theoretical prediction that the nanotube becomes metallic or semiconducting according to its circumference . @xcite the conductance of the metallic nanotubes with potential energy disorder has been studied .",
    "@xcite the junction structures with a shape of a part of a cone connecting two nanotubes with different radii have been also observed , @xcite and studied theoretically.@xcite they are formed by a pair of a pentagonal defect and a heptagonal defect .",
    "@xcite by composing the nanotube junctions , the electronic circuits with nanometer size might be designed .",
    "the atom bond network of the nanotube junctions is uniquely determined by its development map with the vector of the circumference of the connected thicker nanotube @xmath2 and that of the connected thinner tube @xmath3 .",
    "we have calculated the conductance with landauer s formula , i.e. , the transmission rate , for the various junctions connecting two metallic nanotubes by the tight binding model.@xcite surprisingly , the dependence of the transmission rate on the parameters , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , has a very simple form obeying the scaling law ; in the energy region @xmath0 where the channel number is kept to two in both the tubes , the transmission rate is independent of detailed atomic arrangements as well as the angle between the two tube axes but determined only by the two parameters ; one of the two parameters is the ratio of the circumference of the tubes @xmath5 and the other is the scaled energy @xmath6 .",
    "the close relation between the transmission rate and the wave function in the junction part is also found by the tight binding model.@xcite when @xmath7 , the transmission rate decays with the thickness of the junction as @xmath8 while the spatial decay of the corresponding wave function in the junction part obeys the same power law.@xcite when @xmath9 , the transmission rate shows a peak structure as a function of the energy , while the corresponding wave function shows a resonant feature , i.e. , its amplitude is enhanced in the middle of the junction part.@xcite    recently , matsumura and ando have confirmed the power law decay for @xmath7 by using the effective mass theory.@xcite we generalized their discussion to more general energy region @xmath10 , and obtained the complete analytical form of the transmission rate with the two parameters , @xmath5 and @xmath11 .",
    "@xcite the agreement of the analytical transmission rate with the numerical one is found to be fairly good so far as @xmath12 is not very close to @xmath13 . by our generalization of the effective mass approximation , the band structures of the periodic multiple nanotube junctions , which are called the helically coiled nanotube in ref.@xcite , can be also obtained as closed analytical forms and their relation to the configuration of the pentagon and the heptagon are clearly explained based on the symmetry features .",
    "@xcite the effective mass theory is derived from the tight binding model and is valid when the energy is near zero .",
    "it is suitable to obtain the analytical results and to explain the origin of the scaling law because it treats not the discrete space but the continuous space , i.e. , it does not necessitate the detailed atomic structures of the honeycomb lattice . @xcite though the analytical transmission rate of the nanotube junction by the effective mass theory has been studied in detail in this way , the close relation between the transmission rate and the wave function observed in the numerical result is not clarified by the effective mass theory yet . in this paper , the spatial variations of the wave function",
    "is expressed unambiguously by the effective mass theory and it gives an intuitive explanation for the dependence of the transmission rate on @xmath5 .",
    "furthermore it will be also found that its dependence on the energy has close relation to the other parameter @xmath11 of the scaling law .",
    "these points are discussed in section iii .",
    "the concise expression of the wave function characterized by only the two parameters will be useful when the stm images of the nanotube junction are analyzed .",
    "on the other hand , the discrepancy between the numerical transmission rate with the tight binding theory and the analytical one by the effective mass approximation become considerable when @xmath12 is very close to @xmath13 ; the numerical transmission rate shows a sharp dip there while the analytical one does not show .",
    "since the effective mass theory is an approximation derived from the tight binding model , the numerical result by the tight binding model is considered to be correct one .",
    "to discuss the origin of the sharp dip , the wave functions calculated by the tight binding model have to be compared with those calculated by the effective mass theory . to calculate the wave function by the tight binding model more efficiently ,",
    "a new numerical method is developed in section ii . from the comparison of the wave function calculated by the method in section ii with the analytical one , we found in section iv that the evanescent waves in the tube parts and the defect levels at the pentagon and the heptagon have important roles to form the dip structures .",
    "fig.[tenkaibars ] shows the development map of the nanotube junction .",
    "it is characterized by bars representing zig - zag segments of the c - c bond network in the circumferential direction of the single junction .",
    "they are aligned and numbered along the direction @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the basic translation vectors of the graphite plane .",
    "each bar is connected with adjacent bars by the remaining c - c bonds .",
    "the network is rolled up so that the atoms denoted by @xmath17 in the bottom of the @xmath17th bar and the top one of the same bar denoted by @xmath18 become the identical one .",
    "the @xmath17 and @xmath18 sites are shown by the filled and the open circles in fig.[tenkaibars ] , respectively .",
    "when @xmath19 , the @xmath17th bar is formed by the @xmath20 unit cells of the 2d graphite , where the @xmath21 unit cells are aligned along @xmath15 and the others are aligned along @xmath16 .",
    "so the @xmath22 tube defined in ref.@xcite is formed there . when @xmath23 , the @xmath17th bar is defined as such that made by adding @xmath24 unit cells and one atoms along the direction of @xmath25 to the bottom of the zeroth bar . for @xmath26 ,",
    "@xmath17th bar is made from the @xmath27th bar by exchanging @xmath28 unit cells and one atoms in its bottom aligned along @xmath25 with @xmath29 unit cells aligned along @xmath30 .",
    "the network made in this way represents the junction of the @xmath22 tube @xmath31 and the @xmath32 tube @xmath33 , where @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "this junction is called an @xmath22-@xmath32 junction hereafter",
    ". then fig.[tenkaibars ] corresponds to the ( 2,2)-(2,5 ) junction .",
    "a 7-membered ring is formed at the bottom of the 1st bar and a 5-membered ring is introduced between the @xmath27th bar and the @xmath36th bar .",
    "there are only 6 membered rings elsewhere .",
    "the number of the bonds connecting the @xmath24th bar and the @xmath17th bar is denoted by @xmath37 as @xmath38 the amplitudes of the wave function in the @xmath17th bar are represented by the vector @xmath39 .",
    "its component @xmath40 can be classified to the two groups according to whether the corresponding site connect with the right @xmath41th bar or with the left @xmath24th bar .",
    "these two groups are denoted by @xmath42 and @xmath43 , respectively , as is shown in fig.[rlbars ] . since each site in @xmath17th bar belongs to only and necessarily one of the two groups , the dimension of @xmath44 equals @xmath45 , which are denoted by @xmath46 hereafter .",
    "the bonds between the @xmath24th bar and the @xmath17th bar are numbered as fig.[rlbars ] from the bottom to the top . according to this way of numbering ,",
    "the amplitudes are also numbered by @xmath47 and @xmath48 , which have the bond numbered by @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "then the tight binding equation become @xmath51 and @xmath52 where the first and the other terms in the right hand sides represent the bonds between the neighboring bars and those within the bar , respectively .",
    "here we use the tight binding model including only @xmath53 orbitals with common hopping integral , @xmath54ev ) , and common site energy chosen to be zero . in order to get more accurate results",
    ", the effects from the mixing with @xmath55 orbitals caused by curvature of the graphitic plane also have to be considered .",
    "but we believe that this tight binding model gives a transparent view about this system and qualitative valid results .",
    "another reason why this model is used is that the purpose of this paper is to focus on the effects from the @xmath56 of the bond network rather than those from the curvature .    the tight binding equation , eqs .",
    "( [ tightr ] ) and ( [ tightl ] ) can be summarized by the matrix form as @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are a @xmath60 matrix and a @xmath61 matrix , respectively . in the left ( right )",
    "tube pars , i.e. , when @xmath19 ( @xmath62 ) , these matrixes become constant matrixes , @xmath63 and @xmath64 ( @xmath65 and @xmath66 ) .",
    "the transfer matrixes for the tube parts are obtained as @xmath67 for the left tube and @xmath68 for the right tube .",
    "the eigen values and eigen vectors of @xmath69 are classified into two groups as @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "hereafter , @xmath72 and @xmath73 represent the left thinner tube and the right thicker tube , respectively .",
    "the propagating waves in the former group , which are @xmath74 with @xmath75 , are assigned to @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is called the channel number of the corresponding tube .",
    "they carry the probability flow with the positive velocity , @xmath78 .",
    "the propagating waves in the latter group , @xmath79 , carry that with the negative velocity , @xmath80 . from now on , the normalized extended states with unit flow , @xmath81 and @xmath82",
    "are used instead of @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "the other states for @xmath85 are evanescent waves and the sign of @xmath49 means the direction along which they decay exponentially , i.e. , @xmath86 .",
    "the wave function in the tube parts are represented by superposition of these eigen vectors and its coefficients are represented by @xmath87 as @xmath88 where the @xmath49th column of @xmath89 is the normalized eigen vector @xmath90 , and @xmath91 is the diagonal matrix whose @xmath92 element is the eigen value @xmath93 .    unlike the tube parts , the usual square transfer matrix can not be obtained in the junction part , because the dimension of @xmath44 and that of @xmath94 are different , i.e. , the @xmath95 for @xmath96 becomes a rectangle matrix which has no inverse matrix .",
    "nevertheless there is a @xmath97 matrix which is similar to the inverse matrix of @xmath95 .",
    "it is denoted by @xmath98 and defined by @xmath99 this matrix satisfies the condition @xmath100 but @xmath101 . by this pseudo - inverse matrix , we can define the transfer matrix , @xmath102 .",
    "if eq.([ajbj ] ) is satisfied , then @xmath103 is satisfied , but its converse does not hold generally .",
    "it means that @xmath94 in eq.([tj ] ) can not be chosen to be arbitrary but has to satisfy @xmath104 to make eq.([tj ] ) equivalent to eq.([ajbj ] ) , the condition ( [ condition ] ) is necessary , so we call @xmath105 a conditioned transfer matrix hereafter . in our problem ,",
    "the number of the independent rows of @xmath106 is only one , so eq.([condition ] ) can be written as @xmath107 where @xmath108 is one of the nonzero rows of @xmath106 .",
    "multiplying @xmath105 generates the coefficient at the bar with the decreased @xmath17 , so we define the positive direction along which @xmath17 decreases , i.e. , from the right thicker tube to the left thinner tube .    by using the inverse matrix @xmath109 and @xmath110 ,",
    "the relation between @xmath111 and the right going waves in the thinner tube @xmath112 are summarized as @xmath113 the @xmath114 matrix in the left hand side of eq.([q ] ) is represented by @xmath115 hereafter .",
    "now we define all the necessary things to calculate the transmission rate and the wave function .",
    "when the electron is incident from the right and transmitted into the thinner tube , i.e. , when @xmath116 and @xmath117 , the reflected wave @xmath118 and the transmitted wave @xmath119 are obtained from @xmath120 and @xmath121 respectively .",
    "the corresponding wave function in the junction part , i.e. , @xmath44 for @xmath96 is given by @xmath122    for the inverse direction of the incident electron , @xmath123 and @xmath124 , the reflected wave @xmath125 and the transmitted wave @xmath126 are obtained from @xmath127 and @xmath128 in this case , the wave function in the junction part is given by @xmath129 the transmission rate is obtained from eq.([transmission+ ] ) or eq.([transmission- ] ) , while the reflection rate is obtained from eq.([reflect+ ] ) or eq.([reflect- ] ) from the matrix elements corresponding to the open channel , i.e. , @xmath130 with @xmath131 .",
    "we have confirmed that unitarity holds very well in the conditioned transfer matrix method .",
    "agreement of their results with those calculated by usual recursive green s function methods is also quite good . in both the methods , matrix inversions are necessary about @xmath27 times , but they can be done much faster in the conditioned transfer matrix method than in the recursive green s function method , because matrixes which have to be inverted are real sparse symmetric matrixes , @xmath132 , in the former method while those in the latter method are complex matrixes with no symmetry . therefore the conditioned transfer matrix method is much faster than the recursive green s function method .",
    "this efficiency is expected to be more important when more general related problems are calculated , e.g. , those including electron - phonon interaction or electron - electron interaction self - consistently .",
    "another advantage of the conditioned transfer matrix method over the recursive green s function method , which is not essential but practically important , is that it is more intuitive and easy to be implemented . in section iv ,",
    "the wave functions are calculated numerically by the conditioned transfer matrix method and compared to those calculated analytically by the effective mass equation .",
    "fig . [ junctiontenkai ] shows a development map of the nanotube junction neglecting the atomic sites .",
    "the vectors @xmath133 and @xmath3 represent the circumferences of the thicker tube and the thinner tube , respectively . lines @xmath134 and lines @xmath135 are sticked each other so that the points connected by @xmath136 become identical ( @xmath137 ) .",
    "then @xmath138 and @xmath139 turn out to be the centers of a heptagonal defect and a pentagonal defect , respectively .",
    "these points are marked also in fig.[tenkaibars ] .",
    "thus from now on , the indices 7 and 5 are used to represent the thinner and the thicker tube , respectively .    the equilateral triangles @xmath140 and @xmath141 with bases @xmath142 and @xmath143 have a common apex @xmath144 , which is chosen to be the origin of the coordinate @xmath145 in this paper .",

    "this definition of f s is different from other references @xcite by certain factors .",

    "when energy @xmath4 is zero , @xmath173 and @xmath174 are solutions of the tight binding model , so that the corresponding solutions of the envelop functions @xmath175 are constant . thus when @xmath4 is not zero but close to zero , spatial variation of the envelop functions is slow compared to the lattice constant , @xmath176 nm . in this case , it is a good approximation to take only the first order term in the taylor expansion of the envelop function as @xmath177 . from this approximation ,",
    "one obtains @xcite @xmath178 @xmath179 @xmath180 @xmath181 where @xmath182 and @xmath183 .",

    "when @xmath4 is close to zero , i.e. , @xmath194 , only possible number of @xmath43 is zero .",
    "it means that @xmath189 is perpendicular to @xmath136 so that @xmath188 is the angle of @xmath136 with respect to @xmath195 axis . within the effective mass theory scheme ,",
    "the possible maximum value of @xmath196 ( @xmath197 ) is the channel number of the thicker tube ( the thinner tube ) .",

    "for example , the site indicated by the square symbol near the origin @xmath146 in fig.[tenkaibars ] has the two different labels , which are @xmath323 defined by @xmath324 and @xmath325 defined by @xmath326 . under this transformation of @xmath203 and @xmath151 , the values of eqs.([psia ] ) and ( [ psib ] ) are invariant , that is to say , the results are independent of the way of the labeling , or choice of the vectors , @xmath15 and @xmath16 .    in order to relate the wave function to the transmission rate , the integral of the squared wave function defined below",
    "should be introduced : @xmath327 the third terms in r. h. s of eqs.([psia ] ) and ( [ psib ] ) do not contribute to the integral because @xmath328 varies rapidly as a function of @xmath313 .",

    "the radial norm is normalized so that it equals unity at @xmath330 , i.e. , at the exit of the transmitted wave from the junction part .",
    "it corresponds to the unit flow of the transmitted wave .",
    "thus at the entrance of the incident wave into the junction part , the radial norm @xmath329 becomes the sum of the amplitude of incident wave @xmath331 and that of the reflected wave @xmath332 .",
    "accordingly , the transmission rate @xmath280 can be given by @xmath333 , where @xmath334 for the positive incidence direction and @xmath335 for the negative incidence direction .",
    "figure [ scheme ] is the schematic development maps representing this relation between the radial norm and the transmission rate .",
    "it shows two junctions with a common thicker tube where the incidence direction is negative .",
    "though they have different transmission rates , @xmath336 and @xmath337 , their wave functions in the region ccdd and the transmitted wave are common . from now on , we call @xmath338 an inverse of the radial norm for simplicity .",
    "the inverse of the radial norm , @xmath339 , @xmath340 and the transmission rate @xmath280 of eq.([sigma ] ) are shown in fig.[transnorm ] as a function of @xmath6 by the dashed lines , the dotted lines and the solid lines , respectively .",
    "the curves are shown for the cases @xmath341 and @xmath342 .",
    "for each value of @xmath5 , the inverse of the radial norm is close to the corresponding transmission rate .",
    "therefore we can discuss the dependence of the transmission rate on @xmath5 and @xmath11 by the radial norm .",
    "for this purpose , we show in fig.[rationorm ] the radial norm for the negative incidence directions , @xmath343 , as a function of @xmath344 at six energies @xmath345 .",
    "there are four regions of the parameter space which have different characters ; they are region i @xmath346 , ii @xmath347 , iii @xmath348 and iv @xmath349 . in the region",
    "i , all the curves in fig.[rationorm ] are very close to unity .",
    "it indicates that the corresponding transmission rate is near unity and independent of @xmath11 as is shown by the lines of @xmath350 in fig.[transnorm ] . in the region",
    "ii , the radial norm shows monotonic decrease as either @xmath344 or @xmath11 increases . the decrease with respect",
    "to @xmath344 becomes steep as @xmath11 decreases and are almost proportional to @xmath351 when @xmath352 . in the region iii , however , the radial norm oscillates as @xmath344 increases . when @xmath353 the radial norm has a minimum value around @xmath354 .",
    "correspondingly , the curves of @xmath355 are larger than those of @xmath356 and 0.7 at @xmath353 in fig.[transnorm ] .",
    "it oscillates also with increasing @xmath11 when @xmath357 .",
    "the lines of @xmath358 in fig.[transnorm ] shows the corresponding oscillations . around the boundary between the region ii and iii , the decrease of the radial norm with increasing",
    "@xmath344 becomes critical as is indicated by the plateau of the curve corresponding to @xmath359 in fig.[rationorm ] .",
    "correspondingly , all the curves for @xmath360 and 0.3 in fig.[transnorm ] cross each other around the boundary energy @xmath361 . in the region iv ,",
    "the radial norm is nearly proportional to @xmath351 so that the transmission rate is almost proportional to @xmath362 at each value of @xmath11 .",
    "the oscillating behavior in the region iii can be interpreted as a resonant effect in the following discussion .",
    "the wave function propagates both in the radial and the angular direction .",
    "its wave length along the radial direction is assumed to be close to that of the plane wave obtained from the dispersion relation ( [ dispersion ] ) ; the wave length is given by @xmath363 . when the length of the junction part along the radial direction , i.e. , @xmath364 , coincides with the half of the wave length , the resonance occurs . from this discussion",
    ", the condition of the resonance can be easily obtained as @xmath365 the minimum points of the curves in fig.[rationorm ] in the region iii correspond to this resonance following approximately condition ( [ resonance ] ) ; it comes around @xmath354 when @xmath353 and moves towards the left as @xmath11 decreases . around the resonance point ,",
    "the transmission is almost perfect .",
    "such a resonance , however , does not occur in the region ii and iv , since the radial norm becomes divergent when @xmath366 approaches zero , i.e. , when either @xmath367 or @xmath344 approaches zero .",
    "this divergence comes from the terms of @xmath368 in eq.([norm ] ) which is almost proportional to @xmath369 for small @xmath366 values .",
    "accordingly , the transmission rate decays with the power law in proportion to @xmath362 in the region ii and iv .",
    "since the effective mass theory is an approximation of the tight binding model as is explained in the section iii , its results have to be confirmed by comparing them to the corresponding numerical results from the tight binding model . in this section",
    ", we shall compare the wave function calculated numerically by the tight binding model , @xmath44 , with those determined analytically by eqs.([psia ] ) and ( [ psib ] ) , @xmath309 .",
    "for the numerical calculation with the tight binding model , the conditioned transfer matrix method explained in section ii is used .",
    "figure [ ratiokp ] shows the ratio of the corresponding quantities , @xmath370 as a function of radial distance @xmath371 , for the energy @xmath372 .",
    "the values are plotted for the ( 3,3)-(13,13 ) junction in fig.[ratiokp]-(a ) and for the ( 10,10)-(13,13 ) junction in fig.[ratiokp]-(b ) . here",
    "the incidence direction is positive ; @xmath373 is caused by the incident waves @xmath374 . for the opposite incidence direction ,",
    "similar results are also obtained . here",
    "the factor @xmath375 defined by eq.([hpm ] ) is necessary because the transmitted waves have unit flow in eqs.([psia ] ) and ( [ psib ] ) , while the incident waves have unit flow in eq.([wavefunction+ ] ) .",
    "one can see that the ratio is close to unit , i.e. , the coincidence is fairly good . correspondingly , the transmission rate by the conditioned transfer matrix and that by eq.([sigma ] ) coincide well with each other when @xmath376 , as shown in fig.[t13 - 13 ] . the deviation from unity becomes smaller as @xmath12 approaches zero , because all the assumptions postulated in deriving eqs.([psia ] ) and ( [ psib ] ) are more valid for smaller @xmath12 .",
    "the deviations , however , become larger when @xmath377 in fig.[ratiokp]-(a ) , while such a feature is not found in fig.[ratiokp]-(b ) .",
    "the most natural explanation for this difference is that the deviations are caused mainly by the evanescent waves in the tube parts , and their effects become more significant as their decay lengths along the tube axis become larger , i.e. , as they approach the extended states .",
    "the decay length is determined by @xmath378 in eq.([tubebound ] ) as @xmath379 .",
    "thus the discussion below is concentrated to the most extended evanescent waves corresponding to @xmath380 .",
    "when @xmath381 as the case of fig.[ratiokp]-(a ) , the evanescent waves in the thicker tube side are much more extended and have larger effects than those in the thinner tube side . as a result ,",
    "the deviation near the thicker tube side is enhanced compared to that in the other place . on the other hand , when @xmath382 as the case of fig.[ratiokp]-(b ) , the evanescent waves have similar decay lengths both in the thicker and in the thinner tube side , so that the difference of the deviation does not depend on the sides .    to see the spatial variation of the wave function",
    ", we show @xmath383 of the ( 3,3)-(13,13 ) junction calculated by the conditioned transfer matrix method and the corresponding quantities determined analytically by eqs.([psia ] ) and ( [ psib ] ) .",
    "the former is shown by the closed symbols joined by the dotted lines and the latter is shown by the open symbols joined by the solid lines for @xmath384 in fig.[normcj]-(a ) and for @xmath385 in fig.[normcj]-(b ) .",
    "the horizontal axis is the number of the bar @xmath17 , which are almost proportional to the radial distance @xmath371 .",
    "the diamonds and the squares correspond to the positive energy and the negative energy , respectively .",
    "fig.[normcj]-(a ) shows that the results by the two methods agree quite well .",
    "enhancement of the deviation at @xmath386 is caused by the evanescent waves . in fig.[normcj]-(a ) , the wave function does not show monotonic decrease along the incidence direction but has a peak structure .",
    "it gives rise to the resonant peak structures near @xmath387 in fig.[t13 - 13 ] which is already discussed in the previous section .",
    "in contrast to the good agreement in fig.[normcj]-(a ) , the deviation becomes quite large in fig.[normcj]-(b ) especially near @xmath388 ; the wave function by the conditioned transfer matrix grows more rapidly than that by the analytical results with approaching the thicker tube side .",
    "when @xmath1 , as in the case of fig.[normcj]-(b ) , the decay lengths of the evanescent waves are very large , and cause the large discrepancies . corresponding to it ,",
    "large discrepancies occur also in the transmission rate ; only the data by the tight binding model show the sharp dips near @xmath389 in fig.[t13 - 13 ] .",
    "the sharp dip appears approximately when @xmath390 , i.e. , when the decay length of the evanescent waves in the thicker tube are larger than the diameter of the thicker tube . evanescent waves with their decay length larger than the diameter of the corresponding tube are called quasi - extended evanescent waves hereafter .    in fig.[ratiokp ] , data corresponding to sites belonging to the pentagonal defect or the heptagonal defect are shown by closed diamonds .",
    "they indicate that the numerical wave function calculated by the tight binding model is more localized at the defects than the analytical wave function .",
    "hereafter a localization strength for the @xmath313 direction at the defect is defined as the ratio between the numerical norm per site at the defect and that of the bars the defect belongs to .",
    "it is calculated by the tight binding model and represented by @xmath391 at the heptagon and @xmath392 at the pentagon with the notation of section ii . here",
    "@xmath393 means that site @xmath49 belongs to the @xmath394 membered ring defect .",
    "since the radial distance @xmath371 in the bar is almost constant , the analytical quantity corresponding to the localization strength has a maximum represented by @xmath395 which is shown from eqs.([psia ] ) and ( [ psib ] ) .",
    "therefore we can say that the wave function is quasi - localized at the defect when the localization strength is larger than two . the localization strength at the pentagon and that at the heptagon are shown as a function of the energy in fig.[pentagon]-(a ) and fig.[pentagon]-(b ) , respectively .",
    "the solid lines and the dashed lines show the localization strength for the the @xmath396-@xmath397 junction and that for the @xmath398-@xmath397 junction , respectively .",
    "the solid lines shows that the the wave function is quasi - localized at both the defects when @xmath1 and @xmath399 , i.e. , when there are quasi - evanescent waves in both the tubes .",
    "furthermore they also show asymmetry with respect to the energy axis ; the quasi - localization at the pentagon ( at the heptagon ) around @xmath400 ( @xmath401 ) is larger than that around the energy with the opposite sign .",
    "these results indicate that the quasi - localization occurs due to the mixing between the quasi - extended evanescent waves and the defect levels. here the defect levels are defined as @xmath394 discrete energy levels , @xmath402 @xmath403 , of an isolated @xmath394 membered ring calculated by the tight binding model . @xcite since the energy region around zero is considered now , the discrete level closest to @xmath7 , which is at @xmath404 for the pentagon , and at @xmath405 for the heptagon , is the most important . the closer distance in the energy between the two states enhances their mixing so that it causes the asymmetry with respect to the energy . since the defect levels are caused by the discreteness of the lattice , these results can not be reproduced by the effective mass equation .    the energy where the quasi - localized evanescent waves in the thinner tube side appear is around @xmath406 . when @xmath407 , it is distant from the considered energy region @xmath278 so that there is no quasi - extended evanescent waves in the thinner tube side .",
    "though there are the quasi - extended evanescent waves in the thicker tube side , the defect level of the heptagon can not be mixed with them due to the large spatial distance between the heptagon and the thicker tube .",
    "this is the reason why the dashed line in fig.[pentagon]-(b ) do not show the quasi - localization . in summary",
    ", we can say that the defect level is mixed with the quasi - extended evanescent waves only when they are close to each other both in the energy and in the space .    in this way , the analytical results by the effective mass approximation are not appropriate when the evanescent waves become quasi - extended .",
    "the width of this energy region , however , is only about @xmath408 . except these narrow energy region ,",
    "the analytical results are appropriate enough .",
    "in this paper , the junctions connecting the two metallic nanotubes with different circumferences by a pair of the pentagonal and the heptagonal defect are investigated .",
    "both the wave function and the transmission rate are analytically obtained by the effective mass equation , and a close relation between them is found . to discuss the close relation ,",
    "the junction part is divided into pieces according to the radial distance @xmath371 from the thinner tube side and the radial norm of the wave function is evaluated in each piece .",
    "the radial norm is determined by the two parameters , @xmath11 and @xmath344 where @xmath13 and @xmath409 are the threshold energy and the circumference of the thicker tube , respectively .",
    "the transmission rate approximates to the inverse of the radial norm where @xmath371 is substituted with the circumference of the thinner tube , @xmath410 . from the dependence of radial norm on the two parameters , the parameter space is roughly classified into the four regions ; region i @xmath411 , ii @xmath412 , iii @xmath348 and iv @xmath349 . in the region",
    "i , the radial norm is close to unity so that the corresponding transmission is almost perfect , independent of @xmath11 . in the region iii",
    ", the radial norm oscillates near unity as the function of either of the two parameters .",
    "the period of the oscillation with respect to @xmath371 is approximately the same as half wave length . here",
    "the wave length is that of the plane wave , i.e. , it is obtained from the liner dispersion relation of the monolayer graphite , eq.([dispersion ] ) .",
    "almost perfect transmission due to the resonance occurs in region iii when the radial length of the junction part , @xmath364 , coincides with this period , because the corresponding radial norm has a minimum value there .",
    "as either @xmath367 or @xmath344 decreases , however , the radial norm becomes divergent owing to the term @xmath368 so that the corresponding transmission rate approaches zero .",
    "it leads to the power law decay of the transmission rate proportional to @xmath362 in the region ii and iv instead of the resonant feature.@xcite    the nanotube junction can be considered as a combined system , that is the quasi two - dimensional structure (= the junction part ) connecting the two quasi one - dimensional structures (= the tube parts ) .",
    "the wave functions in the former part become the 2d waves , whose radial parts are given by the sum of @xmath413 and @xmath414 @xmath415 , while they are the 1d plane waves in the tube parts .",
    "nevertheless , the condition of the resonance in the region iii , eq.([resonance ] ) , is obtained from the wave length of the 1d plane wave .",
    "it indicates that the four components of the wave function in the junction part , @xmath413 and @xmath414 @xmath415 , are combined appropriately to be fitted well with the 1d plane waves in the tube parts . on the other hand ,",
    "the wave function shows the power law decay along the radial direction in the region ii and iv , because only the component @xmath416 becomes dominant . in other words ,",
    "the wave function in the junction part has the two dimensional character in the region ii and iv so that its matching with the plane wave in the tube parts becomes worse than in the region iii .",
    "the wave function in the junction part has different dimensionalities in this way .",
    "the wave functions analytically obtained by the effective mass equation are compared with that numerically obtained by the tight binding model .",
    "when @xmath12 is very close to @xmath13 , the discrepancies between them becomes considerable . from the dependence of the discrepancies on the radial distance",
    ", we speculate that they are mainly due to the evanescent waves with their decay length larger than the diameter of the corresponding tube and they are called quasi - extended evanescent waves .",
    "the quasi - extended evanescent waves cause the sharp dip of the transmission rate , which is absent in the analytical result .",
    "when the quasi - extended evanescent waves and the energy levels of the @xmath394 membered ring defect @xmath417 are close both in the energy and in the space , mixing between them appears as the enhancement of the wave function at the corresponding defect .",
    "nevertheless coincidence between the analytical wave functions and the numerical ones are fairly good except the narrow energy region @xmath418 .",
    "the nature of the wave function discussed in this paper can be observed by scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) , because stm images reflect the local density of states ( ldos ) , which are proportional to the sum of the squared wave functions , eqs .",
    "( [ psia ] ) and ( [ psib ] ) , in the nanotube junction part .",
    "the third terms in eqs .",
    "( [ psia ] ) and ( [ psib ] ) give rise to the @xmath419 pattern or the oscillation along the @xmath313 direction in the stm images .",
    "they fade away as @xmath12 approaches zero .",
    "it is also expected that the images depend on the direction of the electronic current along the tube axes , which should not be confused with that of the tunneling current from the stm tip to the sample. when @xmath420 and @xmath421 , for example , the squared absolute value of the wave function in the junction part is almost proportional to @xmath422 when the current flows from the thicker tube to the thinner tube and to @xmath423 when it flows along the inverse direction .",
    "we expect that these results will promote the investigation of the nanostructures composed by the nanotubes including the nanotube junctions .",
    "this work is supported in part by the core research for evolutional science and technology ( crest ) of the japan science and technology corporation(jst ) .",
    "in the tight binding model , the probability flow from site @xmath49 to site @xmath17 is represented by @xmath424 , where @xmath425 is the amplitude of the wave function at site @xmath49 and @xmath426 is the hopping integral connecting site @xmath49 and @xmath17 .",
    "conservation of the flow is guaranteed by the tight binding equation , @xmath427 . in this paper , @xmath426 is nonzero only when @xmath49 and @xmath17 are nearest neighbors .",
    "consider bars for @xmath19 forming to the @xmath22 nanotube part in fig.[tenkaibars ] .",
    "the amplitudes of wave functions are represented by @xmath428 and @xmath48 in the same way as fig.[rlbars ] .",

    "the absolute value of the second term in ( [ flowr7 ] ) is less than @xmath443 , since the energy region where the channel number is kept to two , i.e. , @xmath444 , is considered now .",
