    "the investigation of bound states of quarks provides insight into the strong force , by which they are held together .",
    "doing so with different kinds of hadrons allows one to study different manifestations of qcd . especially at low scales , however , modeling such phenomena is challenging .",
    "quark models predict systems of states for different quark configurations that can be confronted with experimental data . while several possible configurations would in principle be useful to study , including bound gluon - only states , the objects that lend themselves to this exercise more easily are mesons and baryons . beyond these",
    "two - quark or three - quark systems predicted within this framework , other bound configurations can exist that have quantum numbers not predicted in the nonrelativistic quark model ( `` exotics '' ) or have four or five quark constituents .",
    "this summary focuses on results that were new this summer .",
    "a selection of topics will be presented , illustrating ways to study the effects of strong interaction from low to high energies .",
    "this covers baryons and mesons . for a summary on pentaquarks ,",
    "i refer the interested reader to ref .",
    "the analyses divide into three categories : ( 1 ) new phenomena , ( 2 ) systematic surveys and complementary approaches to verify new phenomena , ( 3 ) precision measurements .",
    "heavy quarkonium , bound states such as @xmath0 or @xmath1 , are an ideal laboratory for studing the strong potential as the masses and widths of states are directly related to the strong force holding them together , mediated by gluons . from a researcher s standpoint , this is the same scenario as positronium , where the electron and positron are held together by the electric force , mediated by photons . however , the energy scale is vastly different for hadrons .",
    "bottomonium , with heavier constituents of about @xmath2 than charmonium , can be treated as non - relativistic . on the other hand , charmonium , with the lowest - lying state at just below @xmath3 ,",
    "affords the opportunity to study the importance of relativistic corrections .",
    "i will list examples for spectroscopy , decay , and searches for quarkonium states .",
    "while substantial bottomonium samples on the @xmath4 exist ( direct production or radiative return from higher energies ) , most progress this summer was made for charmonium .",
    "all charmonium states below open - flavor threshold have been observed  @xcite .",
    "large samples exist for the @xmath5 and @xmath6 , which are well - studied .",
    "the masses and widths have been determined at high accuracy .",
    "the focus is now on comparing the two states , identifying rare decays , and investigating the resonant substructure in multibody states . as for open charm",
    ", this provides information on the intermediate states produced and gives insight into the decay dynamics .",
    "a scan of the @xmath6 by e385  @xcite led to the current most precise results of @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the process used was @xmath9 with @xmath10 or @xmath11 .",
    "the analysis makes use of the small beam energy spread , which is comparable to the structure investigated as opposed to the @xmath12mev range to which @xmath13 machines are limited .",
    "the @xmath14 states can be studied using the reaction @xmath15 , where they are produced at a branching ratio of a little under @xmath16 each .",
    "once the transition photon is identified , the @xmath14 are easy to handle experimentally . given the @xmath6 sample sizes , this implies that the @xmath14 data are not far behind the @xmath6 in statistical power , and similar studies as for the @xmath6 are being conducted .",
    "the transition rates are affected by relativistic corrections , and thus measuring them accurately is important to guide theory .",
    "the @xmath17 and the @xmath18 are less well known , and studies to learn more about their properties and decays are under way .",
    "cleo - c presented a study of decays @xmath19  @xcite . branching fractions for the final states @xmath20 ( and resonant sub - mode @xmath21 ) , @xmath22 ( and resonant sub - mode @xmath23 ) , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 ,",
    "were determined .",
    "most of these are first measurements .",
    "isospin relations in the submodes @xmath21 and @xmath23 are found to be consistent with expectations .",
    "bes investigated the decay @xmath27",
    "the distribution of @xmath28 _ vs. _ @xmath29 shows the expected bands of the @xmath30 and the @xmath31 .",
    "the necessary fit components to get a reasonable description of the data are @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , a non - resonant contribution , and a breit - wigner with a mass - dependent width function for a broad enhancement in @xmath33 around @xmath34 , which does not match any known particles .",
    "it is not possible to use @xmath35 excitations to describe the observed distribution .",
    "@xmath36-parity conservation implies that this state should have odd @xmath37 and @xmath38 ; the fit prefers @xmath39 . the pole position , which is chosen instead of breit - wigner - like parameters to quote a result , as determined by the fit is @xmath40 ; a product branching fraction @xmath41 is found .",
    "future studies will focus on a search for the same phenomenon in isospin - related final states to clarify the nature of this state .",
    "studies of charmonium production in @xmath42  decay aim at gaining insight into the production mechanism and variations among different @xmath43 states .",
    "the @xmath44 , @xmath5 and @xmath45 ( and excitations ) along with a @xmath46 or @xmath47 can be created through @xmath48 , but production of @xmath18 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 must involve different mechanisms . a prediction  @xcite states that they can be produced as copiously as @xmath45 ( the branching fractions @xmath51 are of order @xmath52 ) .",
    "this holds for the @xmath49 , at @xmath53 , but the current upper limits for @xmath18 ( from @xmath54 ) and @xmath50 are an order of magnitude lower .",
    "babar presented preliminary results for @xmath55 and @xmath56 decay to final states with @xmath57 and @xmath58  @xcite : @xmath59 ( uncertainty improved by 50% ) , @xmath60 at 90%  cl ( in agreement with belle ) , @xmath61 at 90%cl ( first limit ) .",
    "the branching fraction @xmath62 is not known .",
    "the current level of sensitivity does not yet allow a firm conclusion on the level of suppression of @xmath18 production .",
    "little is known about charmonium states above @xmath63 threshold .",
    "candidates for the states @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) are identified as peaks in the spectrum of the inclusive hadronic cross - section ; their positions and widths match theoretical predictions for those states .",
    "observation of other states not accessible in @xmath13 collisions is possible in @xmath42  decay , @xmath68 production , or through a transition from a higher - mass state .",
    "a fit to the @xmath69 spectrum provides the masses and widths of the @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , but the extraction of these quantities is not without ambiguity .",
    "bes , for the first time , attempted to take interference between these broad resonances into account  @xcite .",
    "the parameters determined show substantial variation with respect to a fit without interference .",
    "an interesting question is what the inclusive cross - section is composed of ; a question that a fit to the cross - sections measured for exclusive decay samples in data taken in the charm region ( cleo ) or with initial state radiation from higher energies ( babar , belle ) can answer .",
    "belle presented a new study  @xcite of @xmath63 and @xmath73 ( not through a @xmath74 ) that augmented an earlier publication on @xmath75 , @xmath76  @xcite .",
    "summed up , the features of the inclusive spectrum from bes are reproduced , aside from a shift due to the smooth contribution from @xmath77 continuum . the components not present in such a comparison",
    "are expected to be of comparatively low cross - section : charmonium production , @xmath78 production , charm baryons , other @xmath79 ( non - resonant ) , @xmath80 ( cleo @xcite ) .",
    "the distribution of @xmath81 in the @xmath73 sample shows a preference for @xmath82 near the @xmath83 . selecting events of this type , namely @xmath84 , and plotting their invariant mass , a peak of @xmath85 statistical significance at the @xmath72",
    "is found at @xmath86 , @xmath87 .",
    "the mass and width extracted match those from the inclusive bes analysis  @xcite , @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "the @xmath73 events where @xmath82 is outside the @xmath83 region are consistent with background from sidebands below @xmath90 and show a slow rise thereafter , consistent with cleo - c s findings  @xcite , where @xmath73 is not observed at energies below @xmath91 .",
    "no other exclusive decay branching fractions have been measured for charmonium states above the @xmath92 ( only upper limits exist )  @xcite .",
    "the properties such as production / decay patterns or masses / widths of some other states have been found to resemble those of expected charmonium states .",
    "in most cases , it is difficult to come up with an unambiguous assignment for them based on the experimental evidence available to date .",
    "examples follow .",
    "belle analyzed their isr data for the decay @xmath93",
    "@xcite , in order to improve knowledge of the @xmath94 .",
    "this state has been seen before by babar , belle , and cleo , but thus far only been fit to a single breit - wigner resonance .",
    "belle attempted a fit using two breit - wigner shapes that interfere so as to obtain a better description in particular of the low - side tail of the @xmath94 .",
    "due to a mathematical ambiguity , two solutions are found that yield an identical description of the data , have the same values for masses and width , but result in substantially different product of couplings of the @xmath94 and the @xmath95 ( the resonance associated with the low - side breit - wigner ) to the initial and final state , @xmath96",
    ". the properties of the @xmath94 contribution are consistent with those published earlier by babar and cleo .",
    "the distribution of @xmath97 favors higher values for events taken from @xmath98 near the @xmath94 , matching the observation by other experiments , but is consistent with phase space for events above or below the @xmath94 peak region .",
    "belle also searched for @xmath99  @xcite .",
    "belle confirmed the babar observation of a peak at @xmath100 , with similar parameters , but a second peak at @xmath101 is found : @xmath102 , @xmath103 .",
    "the distribution of @xmath97 is inconsistent with phase - space decay for the lower - mass peak , but shifted towards higher values . in the case of the second peak ,",
    "the distribution strongly favors high values ; the @xmath97 distribution is suggestive of the @xmath104 .",
    "another as yet unexplained state is the @xmath105 , observed by belle in @xmath106 as a peak in the @xmath107 distribution of events recoiling against the @xmath5 .",
    "more belle data confirm  @xcite the existence of this state , with consistent parameters but improved significance . a question that needs to be addressed in order to facilitate a quantum number assignment and placement in the charmonium system is to which degree this state decays to @xmath63 , and to also check for structure in @xmath108 ( @xmath109 is well below @xmath110 though ) .",
    "the @xmath111 spectrum shows no peak at @xmath112 above background , but a broad threshold enhancement .",
    "before a limit for @xmath113 can be set , this will have to be understood . in @xmath114 , a broad peak of more than five sigma statistical significance",
    "is observed , which is identified as a new particle @xmath115 and fit with a breit - wigner function .",
    "while the parameters for the @xmath115 differ from those of the @xmath105 , there is some overlap due to the large widths of both .",
    "babar confirmed belle s observation  @xcite of the @xmath116 in @xmath117 , with substantially improved statistical and systematic uncertainties  @xcite .",
    "the babar mass and width are substantially , but not significantly ( @xmath118 and @xmath119 , respectively ) , lower than belle s .",
    "the theoretical treatment of particles with one heavy and one light quark differs in that the two degrees of freedom are decoupled and the heavy quark can be treated as stationary .",
    "similar guidelines as in quarkonium apply , and it is important to aim for a complete picture in which the existence and properties of the expected states are searched for .",
    "belle investigated angular distributions of the decay @xmath120",
    "@xcite , a state which has been observed before : @xmath121 , total angular momentum of the light degrees of freedom @xmath122 , known decays @xmath123 , @xmath124 , @xmath125 .",
    "a new mode was observed , @xmath126 ( but not through @xmath127 ) , and the ratio @xmath128 is found to be @xmath129 ( preliminary ) .",
    "the angular study of @xmath130 provides a handle on the mixing between two @xmath131 states @xmath132 and @xmath133 . within the heavy quark symmetry the state with @xmath122 ( which is naively expected to be @xmath132 ) decays to @xmath134 in a pure @xmath135-wave , while the one with @xmath136 does so in an @xmath137-wave .",
    "mixing between the two can result in an @xmath137-wave component in @xmath138 decay .",
    "this contribution to the total width is determined from a partial wave analysis and found to be substantial : @xmath139 ( preliminary ) .",
    "much more progress has been made in meson and baryon spectroscopy  @xcite .",
    "babar conducted a systematic search for charm baryons decaying to final states @xmath140 plus @xmath141 , @xmath142 , @xmath143 , @xmath144 , @xmath145 , @xmath146  @xcite .",
    "their preliminary results confirm the states @xmath147 , @xmath148 , and @xmath149 , improve the mass and width measurements of @xmath147 , and discover two new states : @xmath150 and @xmath151 .",
    "they are only observed by their decays to @xmath152 and @xmath153 , implying that contrary to the other cases the @xmath154 and the @xmath155 quark in the parent particle separate .",
    "theoretical treatment of mesons with only light quarks demands non - perturbative methods .",
    "guidance in these soft processes comes from scattering experiments as well as studies of decays .",
    "kloe investigated the decay @xmath156",
    "@xcite to help shed light on the nature of the @xmath104 .",
    "the analysis complements that of other final states such as @xmath157 or @xmath158 that are aimed at the @xmath104 and @xmath159 , broad scalar resonances that appear as intermediate states also in many heavy - quark decays .",
    "producing them in @xmath160 decay makes it possible to study them close to their production threshold .",
    "the dalitz plot @xmath161 _ vs. _",
    "@xmath162 is fit with two different models that test for the existence of an intermediate kaon loop ( @xmath163 ) or a pointlike coupling ( @xmath164 ) .",
    "both models fit the data resonably well , couplings are measured , and the product branching ratio is determined .    the @xmath165-@xmath166 system is often parametrized by a mixture of two components : @xmath167 and @xmath168 .",
    "the mixing angle can be determined for instance from the ratio @xmath169 . under the assumption that no gluonium contributes , kloe determines the mixing angle in the quark - flavor basis to be @xmath170  @xcite , the most precise result to date .",
    "states of pure glue content are predicted to exist at higher energies , yet low enough that they may mix with the @xmath166 .",
    "allowing for such a component in the @xmath166 introduces another mixing angle to quantify the gluonium contribution . within this parametrization and combined with other such ratios from external input , an improved agreement between su(3 ) predictions and the observed branching fraction results is achieved if a gluonium component is allowed .",
    "the squared amplitude coefficient for this component is determined to be @xmath171 .",
    "the result for @xmath172 is not very sensitive to this change in parametrization .",
    "the range of values for @xmath172 determined here is consistent with determinations in the octet - singlet basis in other experiments .",
    "searches for decay to undetectable final states are not only relevant in the perpetual quest for new physics , but also so as to ensure that the total decay width may be approximated by sum of all observed decays .",
    "bes searched for the decay @xmath173 , where the @xmath174 is produced in the reaction @xmath175  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath160 as a narrow resonance is readily identified via its decay into a charged kaon pair , and kinematics constrain the recoiling @xmath174 to a narrow region in the missing momentum .",
    "no signal is seen ; an upper limit is placed on the decay of @xmath174 to invisible final states relative to decay into two photons , which translate into absolute branching fractions of @xmath176 of @xmath177 and @xmath178 , respectively . for comparison ,",
    "similar studies for the @xmath179 led to a limit of @xmath180  @xcite .",
    "cleo used the transition @xmath181 with @xmath182 to study the @xmath165 meson . branching fractions and ratios thereof  @xcite",
    "were determined for @xmath183 , @xmath184 , @xmath185 , @xmath186 , and @xmath187 , a first for such a suite of modes within the same experiment .",
    "these branching fractions are of order @xmath188 or larger ; the ones not covered are at least an order of magnitude lower , and their sum is estimated to amount to no more than @xmath189 .",
    "deviations from previous determinations were observed for @xmath186 and @xmath187 at the level of three standard deviations .",
    "the kinematic conditions allowed cleo to measure the @xmath165 mass  @xcite through a fit of the invariant mass of the decay products ( except @xmath187 , which has too few events ) .",
    "the precision achieved is comparable with that of dedicated experiments .",
    "cleo , agreeing with na48 and kloe , indicates a recent gem result as an outlier .",
    "kloe s high - statistics study  @xcite of @xmath190 aims at testing the degree to which lowest - order current algebra is able to describe the decay dynamics .",
    "if this is accurate , then the decay amplitude can be used to extract a measurement of the @xmath191-@xmath192 quark mass difference in a simple way .",
    "a fit to the dalitz plot is performed up to third order in kinematic quantities .",
    "while coefficients that would indicate charge violation are found to be zero ( current best limits ) , in line with expectation , comparing a relationship between other components reveals that lowest - order current algebra is not sufficient .",
    "the decay rate for @xmath193 can be used to understand final state interactions , undertaken by na48  @xcite . in a simplified picture where the production of the three pions is instantaneous",
    ", the @xmath194 distribution shows a rapid rise at the kinematic limit and then quickly changes slope to an almost linear behavior .",
    "experiment shows the rise to be slower than expected and a distinct change in behavior ( `` cusp '' ) at @xmath195 production threshold . below this point",
    ", there is a depletion of events relative to the expectation .",
    "this is due to the fact that the amplitude for the direct decay @xmath193 interferes with rescattering amplitudes , for example the one - loop process @xmath196 .",
    "the area above the cusp allows to observe sub - leading effects .",
    "na48 s high - precision data ( updated , preliminary ) allow to explore the sensitivity of the dalitz plot to the scattering lengths @xmath197 and @xmath198 , for which theoretical predictions from chiral perturbation theory exist .",
    "the measured values are consistent with those obtained in @xmath199 and pionium lifetime measurements .",
    "a clean way to explore final state interactions close to threshold is @xmath199 , with new work by na48  @xcite .",
    "the fit to describe the amplitude uses a model - independent approach to measure form factor coefficients , achieving a new level of sensitivity , and allows to extract @xmath197 and @xmath198 in an independent manner ( albeit with further theoretical input ) .",
    "the new preliminary results are consistent with an earlier publication on a partial sample . for both the @xmath199 and @xmath193 decays , the evaluation of isospin breaking corrections are ongoing theoretical efforts .",
    "from highest to lowest energies , a range of phenomena induced by the strong interaction are being explored .",
    "all are important in order to arrive at a complete picture of qcd .",
    "much headway has been made in terms of precision measurements , while many observations remain unexplained .",
