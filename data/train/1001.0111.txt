    "it is well known that some liquids ( for example , water , silica , silicon , carbon , and phosphorus ) show anomalous behavior in the vicinity of their freezing lines @xcite .",
    "the water phase diagrams have regions where a thermal expansion coefficient is negative ( density anomaly ) , a self - diffusivity increases upon pressuring ( diffusion anomaly ) , and the structural order of the system decreases upon compression ( structural anomaly ) @xcite .",
    "the regions where these anomalies take place form nested domains in the density - temperature @xcite ( or pressure - temperature @xcite ) planes : the density anomaly region is inside the diffusion anomaly domain , and both of these anomalous regions are inside the broader structurally anomalous region . it is natural to relate this kind of behavior with the orientational anisotropy of the potentials , however , there are a number of studies which demonstrate the waterlike anomalies in fluids that interact through spherically symmetric potentials @xcite .",
    "it was shown @xcite that the thermodynamic and kinetic anomalies may be linked through excess entropy .",
    "in particular , in refs . the authors propose that entropy scaling relations developed by rosenfeld @xcite can be used to describe the the regions of diffusivity anomaly .",
    "rosenfeld based his arguments on the approximations of liquid by an effective hard spheres system . in this approach",
    "the kinetic coefficients are expressed in reduced units based on the mean length related to density of the system @xmath0 and thermal velocity @xmath1 .",
    "the reduced diffusion coefficient @xmath2 , viscosity @xmath3 and thermal conductivity @xmath4 are written in the form    @xmath5    @xmath6    @xmath7    rosenfeld suggested that the reduced transport coefficients can be connected to the excess entropy of the system @xmath8 through the formula    @xmath9    where @xmath10 is the transport coefficient , and @xmath11 and @xmath12 are constants which depend on the studying property @xcite .",
    "interestingly the coefficients @xmath13 and @xmath14 show extremely weak dependence on the material and can be considered as universal .",
    "another expression for relating diffusion coefficient to the excess entropy was suggested by dzugutov @xcite . in this approach",
    "the natural parameters of the system were chosen to be the particle diameter @xmath15 and the enskog collision frequency @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the value of radial distribution function at contact . in case of continuous potentials",
    "the value of @xmath15 corresponds to the distance of the first maximum of radial distribution function . defining the reduced diffusion coefficient as @xmath18 .",
    "dzugutov suggested the following formula for it    @xmath19    where @xmath20 is a pair contribution to the excess entropy @xcite .",
    "it was shown that this relation holds for many simple liquids . at the same time",
    "this equation is not strictly valid for liquid metals . in the work @xcite it was shown that in this case it is necessary to replace the pair entropy @xmath20 by the full excess entropy @xmath21 .",
    "it was also shown that dzugutov formula does not work for silica modelled with an angular dependent potential @xcite .",
    "it allows to say that rosenfeld relation is more general .",
    "remember that original idea underlying the rosenfeld relation is to refer the system under investigation to the hard spheres system . in this respect",
    "it is interesting whether the rosenfeld scaling relation is valid for the systems essentially different from the hard spheres .",
    "one of the examples of such systems is the system with potentials with negative curvature @xcite .",
    "it was shown in many publications that the behavior of such systems is very complex @xcite .",
    "in particular such systems can form complicated structures , like cluster liquids or different crystal phases .",
    "they can demonstrate maximum on the melting line and reentrant melting and many other unusual properties .",
    "in particular systems with negative curvature can demonstrate anomalous behavior @xcite .",
    "it was suggested that the rosenfeld relations can hold even in the case of anomalous diffusion @xcite .",
    "for example , in the paper @xcite the dependence of both excess entropy and diffusion coefficient on density are reported for the core - softening potential that consists of a combination of a lennard - jones potential plus a gaussian well .",
    "this potential can represent a whole family of two length scales intermolecular interactions , from a deep double - well potential to a repulsive shoulder .",
    "accordingly to these dependencies both excess entropy and diffusion have non monotonic behavior which allows to preserve exponential dependence of the diffusion coefficient on the excess entropy .",
    "it means that the thermodynamically anomalous regions are characterized by anomalous behavior of the excess entropy which induces anomalous diffusion as well .",
    "another example of systems which can not be approximated by a hard sphere model is the systems with bounded potentials @xcite .",
    "since these potentials have no singularity in the origin the behavior of such system is strongly different from the behavior of hard spheres .",
    "one of the most common model with bounded potential is the gaussian core model ( gcm ) .",
    "this system is defined by the potential    @xmath22    this potential was introduced by stillinger @xcite for simulation of the plastic crystals system .",
    "the phase diagram of the gcm demonstrates two crystal phases - fcc and bcc @xcite .",
    "starting from the densities around @xmath23 the melting curve has a negative slope .",
    "it was also shown that gcm demonstrates liquid state anomalies : density anomaly @xcite , diffusion anomaly @xcite and structural anomaly @xcite . interestingly stockes - einstein relation is also violated in the gcm system @xcite .    in the article",
    "@xcite an extensive study of another model with bounded potential was reported .",
    "this work is concerned to the herzian spheres system which is defined by the interparticle potential of the form    @xmath24    the phase diagram of the herzian spheres system demonstrates very complex behavior , including many crystal phases and reentrant melting .",
    "anomalous diffusion is also reported @xcite .    taking into account that the behavior of the systems with negative curvature potentials and the systems with bounded potentials is rather different from the behavior of hard spheres",
    "a question arises if the rosenfeld scaling relations are applicable for such systems .",
    "the purpose of this article is to analyze the validity of the entropy scaling for the systems with anomalous behavior . for our analysis",
    "we have chosen the diffusion coefficient since it is the simplest transport coefficient to calculate in simulation .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in the second section",
    "we describe the models investigated in the present work and the simulation setup .",
    "section iii gives the results of the simulations and the discussion of these results .",
    "finally the section iv represents our conclusions .",
    "three systems were studied in the present work : herzian spheres , gauss core model and a soft repulsive shoulder system .    for the simulation of the herzian spheres we used a system of @xmath25 particles in a cubic simulation box .",
    "nve md simulation was carried .",
    "equations of motion were integrated by velocity verlet algorithm .",
    "the time step was set to @xmath26 .",

    "additional simulations were done for computing the equation of state for the densities less then unity .",
    "free energy of the liquid was calculated by integrating the pressure along an isotherm @xcite and the excess entropy was obtained from the relation @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the internal potential energy of the liquid .",
    "the simulations were done for the set of ten isotherms : @xmath34 .    in the case of gcm",
    "the system consisted of @xmath35 particles .",
    "the time step was set to @xmath36 .",
    "the equilibration and production runs were @xmath37 and @xmath38 time steps respectively .",
    "the diffusion was computed for the densities from @xmath39 to @xmath29 with the step of @xmath40 for the isotherms @xmath41 .",
    "the calculation of the diffusion coefficient and excess entropy was carried in the same way as for herzian spheres .",
    "the last system considered in the present work is the continuous repulsive shoulder system introduced in the article @xcite .",

    "as it was reported in the paper @xcite this system demonstrates anomalous behavior due to its quasibinary nature .",
    "here we extend the investigation of the diffusion anomaly in the repulsive shoulder system with @xmath44 and check the rosenfeld relations for this system in the anomalous region .    for the simulation of the repulsive shoulder system we used parallel tempering technic @xcite .",
    "the details of the simulation were described in @xcite .",
    "we computed the diffusion coefficients along different isochors starting from the density @xmath45 to @xmath46 with the step @xmath47 .",
    "a set of @xmath48 temperatures between @xmath49 and @xmath50 was simulated .",
    "taking into account the exchange of the temperatures at the same density more then a hundred runs at the same isochor was done .",
    "this allowed us to collect a good statistics on the temperature dependence of the diffusion coefficient .",
    "the diffusion coefficient along an isochor was approximated by a @xmath51th order polynome of the temperature .",
    "the excess entropy was calculated in the way described above .",
    "usually excess entropy can be well approximated by the pair contribution only : @xmath52 , where    @xmath53,\\ ] ]    where @xmath54 is the density of the system and @xmath55 is the radial distribution function .",
    "we did not use the pair contribution to the excess entropy for the gcm and herzian spheres because of the considerable overlap of the particles for the bounded potentials .",
    "since the potentials studied in the present work have negative curvature regions or are bounded they can not be approximated by an one component hard spheres system .",
    "it allows us to pose a question about the applicability of the entropy scaling to these systems both in rosenfeld and dzugutov forms .",
    "note that dzugutov relation ( eq .",
    "( 5 ) ) involves the size of the particles @xmath15 which is ill defined for the negative curvature and bounded potentials systems .",
