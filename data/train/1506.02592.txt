    "<S> the long - distance description of our so(@xmath0 ) models is given by a rp@xmath72 theory ( in contrast to the cp@xmath72 description of su(@xmath0 ) models  @xcite ) , which can be described as @xmath0 real matter fields coupled to a @xmath73 gauge field . </S>",
    "<S> such a theory is expected to host three phases  @xcite , a symmetry breaking phase in which the matter condenses ( which we identify in our spin model as the sn ) , a stable phase in which the matter gets a gap and the @xmath73 gauge theory is deconfined ( identified here as the qsl ) and a phase in which matter is gapped and the @xmath73 is confined ( identified here as the vbs ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the sn - qsl critical point should be in the universality class of o(@xmath0)@xmath74 critical point  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the qsl - vbs phase transition should be in the same universality class as the critical point between these identical phases in the quantum dimer model since the magnetic fluctuations are gapped in both the qsl and vbs phases . </S>",
    "<S> a previous analysis of this phase transition has predicted an o(4)@xmath74 phase transition  @xcite , where the vbs order parameter is identified with a bilinear of the primary field .    </S>",
    "<S> a detailed study of the critical phenomena at @xmath30 and @xmath45 is clearly beyond the scope of the current manuscript . </S>",
    "<S> we shall be satisfied here with a brief analysis : at the qsl - vbs critical point , we are able to carry out reasonable data collapses  @xcite at both @xmath30 and @xmath45 for @xmath75 ( for both x and m ordering vectors , see fig .  [ fig : sk ] ) and @xmath76 , where we find , @xmath77 and @xmath78 for the anomalous dimension of @xmath79 . </S>",
    "<S> the unusually large value of @xmath80 is a direct consequence of fractionalization in the intermediate qsl phase and is often regarded as a smoking gun diagnostic of exotic critical points ( see e.g. ,  @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> more quantitatively , our critical exponents are in rough agreement with the best estimate of @xmath81 of the bilinear field and @xmath82 in the o(4 ) model  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the values for @xmath80 and @xmath83 agree within the quoted errors for @xmath30 and @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> taken together , this bolsters the case that the intermediate qsl phase has @xmath73 fractionalization , albeit more work is needed for a definitive identification . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , the sn - qsl transition , observed only at @xmath30 , has large corrections to scaling and we are unable to reliably determine its critical exponents or determine whether it is a weakly first order transition ( no direct evidence for a first - order transition has been found of the type shown for the @xmath65 case ) .     </S>",
    "<S> crossings of @xmath46 ( above ) and @xmath41 ( below ) signaling the location of the onset of long - range sn and vbs orders at @xmath30 ( left ) and @xmath45 ( right ) . at @xmath30 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 </S>",
    "<S> cross at close but significantly different couplings , @xmath84 and @xmath85 respectively . at @xmath45 </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath40 appears to have crossed at @xmath86 ( we can not study this region because of the sign problem ) , whereas @xmath87 crosses at @xmath88 . from the location of the crossings , for both @xmath30 and @xmath45 </S>",
    "<S> , we can infer an intermediate phase which is neither sn nor vbs , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : pd](b ) . </S>",
    "<S> we present arguments that this phase is a qsl . </S>",
    "<S> no direct evidence for first order behavior is found at either of the transitions , though a weakly first order sn - qsl can not be ruled out . </S>",
    "<S> the qsl - vbs transitions shows good scaling behavior with unconventional critical exponents . </S>",
    "<S> , width=336 ]    in summary , we have introduced a new family of sign - free so(@xmath0 ) spin models , which can be regarded as non - bipartite generalizations of their popular su(@xmath0 ) cousins . </S>",
    "<S> the triangular lattice model which we have studied thoroughly here hosts a spin nematic , a vbs with a large unit cell , a quantum spin liquid phase and unusual quantum critical points . </S>",
    "<S> the absence in the so(@xmath0 ) models of a direct continuous `` deconfined quantum critical point ''  @xcite is in striking contrast to previous simulations of the related bipartite su(@xmath0 ) models  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we have offered a plausible field theoretic scenario that naturally explains this difference . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting that the absence ( presence ) of a qsl in bipartite su(@xmath0 ) ( non - bipartite so(@xmath0 ) ) spin models seems to track the absence or presence of this phase in the kind of quantum dimer models that our model maps to at large-@xmath0  @xcite .    while the study in this paper has focussed on the triangular lattice , our family of models , eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : projmodel],[eq : qmodel ] ) may be constructed sign free on any two or three dimensional non - bipartite lattice . </S>",
    "<S> because of the larger degree of frustration , the kagome system may provide a wider swath of the qsl phase and hence could possibly allow a more detailed study of this phase , even if the phase diagram is of the same form found here . exploring the phase diagram and quantum phase transitions of the three dimensional pyrochlore system </S>",
    "<S> is an exciting open direction for future work .    </S>",
