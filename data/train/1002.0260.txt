    "black holes are intriguing solutions to einstein s classical equations for gravity , characterized by conserved global charges such as total mass , angular momentum , or electric charge .",
    "most prominently black holes display an event horizon which classically can not be crossed by light rays emitted from their interior .",
    "the simplest black hole solution in four dimensions , the schwarzschild black hole , has been discovered nearly a century ago @xcite , and many more solutions with increasing degree of complexity are known by now both in lower and in higher dimensions .",
    "the latter have received much attention recently due to qualitatively new solutions such as black rings which can not be realised in a low dimensional setup @xcite .",
    "recently , the physics of higher dimensional black holes has become of particular interest for the phenomenology of particle physics at colliders . in models where gravity propagates in a higher - dimensional space time while standard model particles are constraint to a four - dimensional brane @xcite , the fundamental quantum gravity scale is as low as the electroweak scale .",
    "this open the exciting possibility that particle colliders such as the lhc could become the first experiment to provide evidence for the quantisation of gravity .",
    "signatures of low - scale quantum gravity from particle collisions include real and virtual graviton effects @xcite , and the production and decay of tev size black holes @xcite .",
    "it is widely expected that a semi - classical description of black hole production and decay is applicable provided curvature effects remain small , and as long as the black hole mass is large compared to the planck scale @xcite . then the fundamental black hole production cross section is estimated by the geometric one , modulo grey body factors reflecting impact parameter dependences and inefficiencies in the formation of a horizon @xcite .    the inclusion of quantum gravitational corrections to the dynamics of space - time becomes a challenge once the black hole mass approaches the fundamental planck scale . here , quantum gravity effects are central for black hole production , decay , or the final stages of a gravitational collapse .",
    "furthermore , the quantisation of matter fields on a black hole background and the very notion of a black hole temperature has to be revisited once quantum fluctuations of space - time itself become dominant .",
    "an understanding of the planckian regime should clarify the so - called ` information paradox ' and the ultimate fate of an evaporating black hole .",
    "presently , a complete quantum gravity description of the above phenomena is not at hand .",
    "furthermore , the standard perturbative quantisation for gravity still faces problems .",
    "important advances , however , have been achieved along the lines of steven weinberg s asymptotic safety scenario @xcite .",

    ", we study quantum corrections to black holes in higher dimensions in the context of asymptotically safe gravity , the main results of which have been summarized in @xcite .",
    "it is our central assumption that the leading quantum gravity corrections to black hole metrics are accounted for by replacing newton s coupling constant through a ` running ' coupling which evolves under the renormalisation group equations for gravity .",

    "the classical schwarzschild radius @xmath9 is given as @xmath10 the black hole solution is continuous in the mass parameter @xmath6 and displays a bekenstein - hawking temperature inversely proportional to its mass .",
    "for large radial distance @xmath11 , we observe @xmath12 , indicating that the geometry of a schwarzschild space - time becomes flat minkowskian .",
    "the coordinate singularity at @xmath13 where @xmath14 vanishes , defines the event horizon of the black hole . in the short distance limit @xmath15",

    "this  renormalisation group improvement \" should provide a good description of the leading quantum corrections , because the primary , explicit , dependence of the schwarzschild black hole on the gravitational sector is only via newton s coupling @xmath4 .",

    "next we discuss the main implications arising from a running gravitational coupling . for the sake of the argument , we parametrize @xmath17 as @xmath20 for sufficiently small @xmath21 , where @xmath22 denotes a characteristic length scale where quantum corrections become dominant .",

    "interestingly , even if gravity weakens at short distances with an index @xmath33 , we still observe a horizon for arbitrary small black hole masses . *",

    "* @xmath38 . in this case",
    ", @xmath17 weakens fast enough to overcome the enhancement due to @xmath32 .",
    "therefore @xmath39 and @xmath16 may display either several zeros , a single one , or none at all , leading to several , one or no horizon depending on the black hole mass @xmath6 and the precise short - distance behaviour of @xmath17 .",
    "we conclude that for @xmath40 the schwarzschild black hole may no longer display a horizon for all mass , whereas for @xmath31 a horizon is guaranteed for all @xmath6 . which of these scenarios is realised depends on the short - distance behaviour of gravity . in the remaining part of the paper we access this picture quantitatively ,",
    "using the renormalisation group for gravity .",
    "in this section , we discuss field theory based approaches to quantum gravity including effective theory and the asymptotic safety scenario for gravity , and provide the renormalisation group running for newton s coupling .      in the absence of a complete theory for quantum gravity , quantum corrections of the form can be accessed in the weak gravity regime using methods from effective theory @xcite . in practice , this amounts to an ultraviolet regularisation of the theory by an uv cutoff @xmath41 of the order of the fundamental planck scale . in the weak gravity regime where @xmath42 with planck mass @xmath43 , it has been found that @xmath44 in four dimensions , and at the one - loop order @xcite , with @xmath45 ( see @xcite for earlier results ) . in higher dimensions ,",
    "no effective theory results are available and thus we have to provide the relevant rg input from a different source .      asymptotic safety of gravity is a scenario where gravity exists as a well - defined fundamental local quantum theory of the metric field @xcite .",
    "this set - up goes one step beyond an effective theory approach : it assumes that the ultraviolet cutoff @xmath41 from effective theory can safely be removed , @xmath46 , whereby the relevant gravitational couplings approach a non - trivial fixed point @xcite .",

    "consider the dimensionless gravitational coupling @xmath47 where @xmath48 denotes the rg momentum scale , @xmath49 is the running newton coupling , and @xmath50 the gravitational wave function factor .",
    "the wave function factor is normalised as @xmath51 at some reference scale @xmath52 with @xmath53 given by newton s constant @xmath54 .",

    "the @xmath290 extra dimensions are compactified with compactification radius @xmath474 . for simplicity , we assume that all radii are of the same order of magnitude , which can be relaxed if required .",

    "this implies that the length scale @xmath474 at which the extra dimensions become visible is much larger than the fundamental length scale @xmath479 at which the quantum gravity effects become important .",

    "@xmath481 is semi - classical , provided curvature effects are small @xcite .",
    "then , on the parton level , the geometric cross section reads @xmath482 with the physical mass replaced by the center - of - mass energy @xmath483 .",
    "there are formation factor corrections to which have been identified in the literature , taking into account inefficiencies in the production process ( see @xcite for reviews ) .",

    "for phenomenological applications , it is often assumed that the minimal mass @xmath484 is of the order of a few @xmath222 , limiting the regime where the semi - classical theory is applicable .",
    "our study adds two elements to the picture .",
    "the first one relates to the threshold mass , indicating that @xmath484 may in fact be lower , possibly as low as the renormalised planck mass @xmath485 this is a direct consequence of the rg running of the gravitational coupling , with @xmath180 relating to the critical physical mass ( defined as in ) , thereby marking a strict lower limit for the present scenario .",
    "consequently , the rg improved set - up has a larger domain of validity due to the weakening of gravity at shorter distances , equally reflected in the boundedness of the associated bekenstein - hawking temperature , see sec .",
    "the second modification takes the quantum gravity - induced reduction of the event horizon into account , replacing @xmath9 by @xmath211 in .",
    "this can be written in terms of a form factor , replacing by @xmath486 with @xmath487 see fig .",
    "we conclude that the rg improved production cross section is reduced with respect to the semi - classical one , already in the regime where the semi - classical approximation is applicable , see fig .",

    "]      next , we implement our rg improvement directly on the level of the classical schwarzschild radius rather than on the level of the underlying black hole metric . to that end , we interpret the energy dependence of the form factor in the production cross section as originating from an effective energy dependence of newton s coupling .",
    "the latter enters the classical event horizon as @xmath490 where the substitution @xmath491 has already been executed . under the assumption that the functional dependence of on the gravitational coupling @xmath4 remains unchanged",
    "once quantum corrections are taken into account , we can interpret the non - trivial energy - dependence of @xmath492 to originate from via the energy - dependence of newton s coupling .",

    "trans - planckian scattering in gravity becomes classical : @xmath495 approaches @xmath4 with increasing center - of - mass energy @xmath481 and the production cross section reduces to the geometrical one .",
    "this is a consequence of quantum corrections being suppressed for large black hole mass , see sec .",
    "[ pt ] , and thus for large @xmath483 .    with these results at hand",
    ", we can now turn the argument around and identify the matching @xmath497 which reproduces from the renormalisation group running of @xmath97 . to leading order in @xmath498 , the matching @xmath499 in  together with @xmath97 from the renormalisation group , see sec .",
    "[ rg ]  reproduces the form factor and the semi - classical limit .",
    "the result highlights a duality between the regime of large center - of - mass energy @xmath500 of a gravitational scattering process , and the low - momentum behaviour @xmath501 of the running coupling @xmath97 in the ` gravitational bound state ' of a black hole",
    ".    it would be interesting to have access to the behaviour of @xmath495 at below - threshold energies , where the energy dependence of newton s coupling should be obtained from standard field theory amplitudes for @xmath502-channel scattering in asymptotically safe gravity @xcite , which become strongly dominated by multi - graviton exchange at planckian energies @xcite . for recent developments along these lines within quantum string - gravity ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "it is useful to compare our results with a related renormalisation group study , where qualitatively different conclusions have been reached @xcite .",
    "there , black hole production cross sections are estimated from using the rg matching @xmath503 for newton s coupling , with @xmath97 taken from the renormalisation group and @xmath68 identified with @xmath483 , following @xcite .",
    "this would be applicable if @xmath483 is the sole mass scale in the problem , and if @xmath4 in is sensitive to the momentum transfer in the @xmath502-channel . however , the matching is in marked contrast to .",
    "most importantly , with no semi - classical limit is achieved in the trans - planckian regime , because @xmath504 becomes strongly suppressed .",
    "this conclusion is at variance with the findings of the present paper .",
    "the origin for this difference is traced back to the following observation : the rg improved schwarzschild radius depends on several mass scales , the planck scale @xmath222 , the black hole mass @xmath6 and , implicitly , the momentum scale @xmath68 . identifying both the mass @xmath505 and the renormalisation group scale @xmath506 with the center - of - mass energy in a gravitational scattering process entangles mass dependences with rg scale running . in turn , the dtour taken in sec .",
    "[ tp ] disentangles these effects by taking into account that the physics involves several mass scales .",
    "this also explains why @xmath222 enters the matching , besides @xmath483 , which is responsible for the qualitative difference with respect to .",
    "we conclude that the set - up laid out in this work is necessary to capture the semi - classical limit of trans - planckian scattering .",
    "how does quantum gravity modify the physics of black holes ?",
    "we have implemented quantum corrections on the level of black hole metrics , replacing newton s constant by a coupling which runs under the renormalisation group equations for gravity .",
    "if newton s coupling weakens sufficiently fast towards shorter distances , it implies the existence of a smallest black hole of mass @xmath180 .",
    "this is the case for all dimensions @xmath1 provided quantum gravity is asymptotically safe .",
    "the mass scale @xmath180 is dynamically generated and of the order of the fundamental planck scale @xmath222 .",
    "interestingly , a mere weakening of the gravitational coupling would not be enough to disallow the formation of an event horizon .",
    "the mechanism responsible for a lower bound on black hole mass relates with the rg scaling of the gravitational coupling at the cross - over from perturbative to non - perturbative running . in consequence ,",
    "the underlying fixed point is not primarily responsible for the existence of the lower bound and alternative uv completions may display a similar weakening down to length scales of the order of the planck length .    in the semi - classical regime @xmath507 ,",
    "corrections to the event horizon and black hole thermodynamics remain perturbatively small , but effects become quantitatively more pronounced with decreasing black hole mass @xmath6 . once @xmath19 becomes of order one , quantum corrections are more substantial .",
    "the specific heat changes sign , the black hole temperature displays a maximum , and vanishes with @xmath274 .",
    "this supports the view that critical black holes constitute cold , planck - size , remnants .",
    "direct implications of fixed point scaling are visible in the short distance limit @xmath508 .",
    "this limit becomes time - like rather than space - like as in classical schwarzschild black holes . also , asymptotically safe black holes with @xmath408 always also display a cauchy horizon besides the event horizon .",
    "it is noteworthy that the classical curvature singularity at the origin is significantly softened because of the fixed point , and either disappears completely , or becomes vastly reduced .",
    "the conformal structure of quantum black holes is very similar to classical reissner - nordstrm black holes , including the near horizon geometry of critical black holes which is of the ads@xmath509 type .",
    "our results have direct implications for the collider phenomenology of low - scale gravity models .",
    "interestingly , quantum corrections increase the domain of validity for a semiclassical description . at low center - of - mass energies , a threshold for black hole production is identified . at larger energies , quantum corrections to production cross sections",
    "lead to a new form factor .",
    "it reduces the cross section , and reproduces the semi - classical result in the trans - planckian limit .",
    "a quantitative implementation of this scenario for mini - black hole production is given elsewhere @xcite .",
    "it would be very interesting to complement this picture by explicit computations based on multi - graviton exchange at planckian energies along the lines laid out in @xcite .",
