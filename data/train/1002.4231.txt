    "let @xmath0 be a graph .",
    "a _ drawing _ of @xmath0 means a representation of the graph in the euclidean plane or the @xmath1-sphere , where vertices are points and edges are simple arcs joining their end - vertices .",
    "since each edge is simple , no edge admits self crossings .",
    "furthermore , we assume that the interiors of edges do not contain vertices , and that two edges do not intersect if they have a common vertex , and that two edges without common end - vertex intersect at most once , and if so , then they intersect transversally .",
    "these requirements are essential in this paper .",
    "a drawing is called a _ regular drawing _ ( resp . _ semi - regular drawing _ ) if it has only double ( resp .",
    "triple ) crossing points . from the requirements , we know that a graph has at least @xmath2 vertices if it admits a semi - regular drawing with at least one triple crossing point .",
    "the crossing number @xmath3 of @xmath0 is defined to be the minimal number of crossing points over all regular drawings of @xmath0 . in particular , @xmath4 if @xmath0 is planar . in this paper",
    ", we introduce a new variation of the crossing number .",
    "triple crossing number _",
    "@xmath5 is zero if @xmath0 is planar , and @xmath6 if @xmath0 does not admit a semi - regular drawing .",
    "otherwise , @xmath5 is defined to be the minimal number of triple crossing points over all semi - regular drawings of @xmath0 . in particular , @xmath7 if and only if @xmath0 is planar .",
    "the triple crossing number can be regarded as a specialization of the degenerate crossing number introduced by pach and tth @xcite .",
    "in addition , for example , the petersen graph is known to have the crossing number two ( and thus non - planar ) , and hence has the triple crossing number one from figure [ fig : petersen ] . in general",
    ", we have the inequality @xmath8 for these two notions , since we obtain a regular drawing from a semi - regular drawing by perturbing each triple crossing point into three double crossing points .        in this paper ,",
    "we determine the triple crossing numbers for all complete multipartite graphs .",
    "a complete multipartite graph is a graph whose vertex set can be partitioned into at least two , mutually disjoint non - empty sets , called the partite sets , so that two vertices @xmath9 and @xmath10 are adjacent if and only if @xmath9 and @xmath10 belong to different sets of the partition .",
    "if the partite sets are of sizes @xmath11  @xmath12 , then the graph is denoted by @xmath13 .",
    "we always assume that @xmath14 if @xmath15 .",
    "in particular , if all @xmath16 , then the graph @xmath17 is the complete graph @xmath18 with @xmath19 vertices .    here",
    "is how the paper is organized .",
    "after we describe basic lemmas , used in the paper repeatedly , in section [ sec : pre ] , we show that the triple crossing number of a complete @xmath19-partite graph is @xmath6 if @xmath20 in section [ sec:5partite ] . in the successive sections , we work on the cases when @xmath21 . here we should mention that the hardest part is the case where @xmath22 , in particular , long , but elementary , geometric arguments are needed to show that @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 with @xmath27 do not admit a semi - regular drawing .",
    "this is treated in sections [ sec : k54 ] , [ sec : k44 ] and [ sec : kn3 ] . after concluding the case where @xmath22 in section [ sec : bipartite ] , the cases where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are established in sections [ sec:4partite ] and [ sec : tripartite ] , respectively .",
