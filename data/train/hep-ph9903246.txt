    "in recent papers by buchmller , hebecker and collaborators @xcite diffractive processes are considered where a virtual photon scatters on a hadron or a nucleus , producing two jets out of a quark and an antiquark in the virtual photon s wave function , and a rapidity gap between the quark - antiquark pair and the hadron ( nucleus ) with which the virtual photon scatters . in the final state the hadron ( nucleus )",
    "forms a cluster of diffractively produced soft particles .",
    "the process is illustrated in fig .",
    "buchmller , hebecker and colleagues @xcite make the provocative claim that such processes may be computed in a semi - classical description of small @xmath1 processes where the effect of the hadron is taken into account as classical sources of color charge @xcite .",
    "they claim that such diffractive processes may be computed by first computing the amplitude of the process , then averaging it over the various color orientations of the source and finally squaring the amplitude to obtain the cross section . that way the squaring of the amplitude and averaging in the hadron s ( nuclear ) wave function are done in the order opposite to what one usually does when calculating total ( inclusive ) cross section .",
    "in this same theory @xcite , the structure functions for deep inelastic scattering are computed using the same distribution of classical sources .",
    "the only difference is that the amplitude is first squared and then averaged over color .",
    "if these prescriptions are true , then there is a subtle and deep relation between the structure functions computed in deep inelastic scattering and diffractive virtual photon production of jets .    in this paper",
    ", we find that we can derive this relation for a restricted class of diffractive processes with a rapidity gap where the hadron encountered remains intact ( see fig .",
    "[ gap]b ) .",
    "we shall call such processes quasi - elastic virtual photoproduction . although it might be possible to extend our methods to the more general case where the hadron fragments into soft particles , we are unable to do so with our current technique",
    ".    we shall present two types of arguments .",
    "the first is an intuitive argument similar to that invoked in glauber scattering .",
    "we shall pursue the argument in the context of a large nucleus where one has a simple picture of the sources of color charge arising from the nucleon valence quark distribution .",
    "we will then later generalize the argument to a hadron where the sources are largely gluonic and arise from a proper renormalization group treatment of the hadronic wavefunction .",
    "we shall perform this analysis when the averaging over color sources is gaussian in the same sense as was discussed in @xcite , or more generally local in transverse space . if the renormalization group analysis after including the qcd evolution in rapidity @xcite yields the weight function for averaging over sources which is not local , as it well might be , then our prescription would fail to impose the condition of a diffractive rapidity gap on the process at hand and should be understood in the sense of quasi ",
    "classical approximation only .",
    "we derive explicit expressions for the quasi  elastic structure function of a nucleus or a hadron .",
    "this structure function is analogous of the diffractive structure function of buchmller , hebecker and colleagues",
    ". we shall refer to it as @xmath3 with the caveat that we are capable at present of describing those processes which are quasi  elastic for the hadron .",
    "we also derive an expression for the structure function for deep inelastic scattering @xmath0 , showing that @xmath0 and @xmath3 are related by an interchange of color averaging and squaring of the amplitude .",
    "we analyze the large @xmath2 limit of the expression we obtain for the diffractive structure function @xmath3 .",
    "the result is very interesting .",
    "the diffractive structure function of the hadron or nucleus turns out to be linearly proportional to the gluon distribution of the hadron or nucleus : @xmath4 . that way we prove that due to the multiple rescattering effects diffraction becomes a leading twist effect @xcite , in the sense that diffractive structure function is not suppressed by extra powers of @xmath2 with respect to the total structure function . at large enough @xmath2",
    "diffractive structure function should depend on center of mass energy for deep inelastic scattering , or , equivalently , on bjorken @xmath5 , in the same way as the structure function @xmath0 .",
    "this statement is confirmed by recent hera data @xcite .",
    "the outline of the paper is the following : in sect .",
    "ii we construct the light cone wavefunction of a virtual photon .",
    "this will be useful as we shall derive the scattering amplitude by convoluting this wavefunction with the propagator of the quark ",
    "antiquark pair through the hadron which includes multiple scatterings of the @xmath6 pair on the gluons ( classical sources ) which constitute the hadron .    in sect .",
    "iii we analyze diffractive scattering from a large nucleus and derive an expression for @xmath0 .",
    "this example illustrates all the essential points of the more general analysis where a hadron is treated as a sum of sources arising from a renormalization group treatment of the hadron wavefunction .",
    "we show how in the large @xmath2 limit due to the multiple rescattering effects diffractive structure function behaves like a leading twist expression .    in sect .",
    "iv we generalize scattering off a nucleus to a hadron .",
    "we argue that if the weight function which is used to color average the sources is gaussian the result of the previous analysis are essentially reproduced .",
    "if the averaging procedure is local ( but not gaussian ) we shall see how the result above generalizes .",
    "we have not been able to generalize to a non - local ( in transverse coordinates ) averaging procedure .    in sect .",
    "v we summarize our results , and compare with the case of deep inelastic scattering by deriving expressions for the total inclusive cross  section and @xmath0 in the quasi  classical limit .",
    "here we are going to calculate the wave function of quark  antiquark fluctuations of a virtual photon . the diagram is shown in fig . [ wf ] . without any loss of generality we can work in a frame where the transverse momentum of the virtual photon is zero , so that the momentum of the photon is given by @xmath7 with @xmath2 the virtuality of the photon .",
    "the light cone momentum of the virtual photon @xmath8 is very large , so that in the spirit of the eikonal approximation we will neglect all the inverse powers of @xmath8 in the calculations below .",
    "however we will keep all the inverse powers of @xmath2 , therefore resumming all the `` higher twist '' terms .    using the light cone perturbation theory with the feynman rules from @xcite",

    "in the calculation of the quark  antiquark propagator through the nucleus we will make use of the quasi ",
    "classical approximation @xcite , which restricts the interactions of the @xmath38 pair with the nucleons to nothing more than a two gluon exchange with the nucleon in covariant gauge .",
    "light cone ( @xmath39 ) gauge analysis of the process is a bit more saddle , but leads to the same formulation of the classical limit @xcite .    as was stated above , in order to calculate diffractive ( or elastic ) production of the quark ",
    "antiquark pair one has to average the production amplitude in the nuclear wave function .",
    "after one does that all the one gluon exchange contributions would cancel resulting in two gluon exchange ( virtual ) interactions being the only possibility .",

    "[ ampl ] . there",
    "the gluon lines can hook in all possible ways to the quark lines ( see fig . [ prop ] ) . similarly to the wave functions , the propagator is calculated in the eikonal approximation , i.e. , the @xmath40 pair is assumed to have a very large light cone momentum , inverse powers of which in the amplitude will be neglected .    in order to calculate the quark ",
    "antiquark propagator we have to start at the lowest order case of one nucleon by summing the diagrams shown in fig .",
    "the vertical dashed line there indicates the final state of the @xmath40 pair .",
    "because the color averaging is done in the amplitude and the complex conjugate amplitude independently , the propagators in the amplitude and the complex conjugate amplitude effectively factorize .",
    "that way we can do the summation just in the amplitude and the answer for the complex conjugate amplitude will be the same .",

    "antiquark pair in the nuclear matter @xmath52 .",
    "@xmath13 is the mean free path of the pair in the nucleus .",
    "one can easily see that if we start including more and more nucleons , interacting with the @xmath40 pair , the answer for the propagator will be just an exponentiation of the lowest order result . since in light cone perturbation theory one has to also include the diagram without interactions , the final answer for the propagator of the pair in the nuclear matter will be @xmath53 one should note here that our convention is different from @xcite , since @xmath54 in our case is the quark ",
    "nucleon cross  section , same as in @xcite .",
    "an important fact to note is that in the two gluon exchange , no net transverse momentum is carried to the source .",
    "the gluon coming in has the same transverse momentum as the gluon going out .",
    "additionally , the longitudinal momentum transfer is very small , of order @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the rapidity gap between the source and the quark - antiquark pair .",
    "this rapidity gap will in general be large .",
    "therefore the source barely changes its momentum in the interaction .    in the language of the fock space wavefunctions",
    "one can see that the fock space wavefunction of the target nucleus is essentially the same after the interaction as it was before .",
    "therefore with probability close to one , the hadronic wavefunction is unchanged .",
    "therefore the procedure of averaging over the sources before squaring the amplitude projects out the quasi - elastic piece of the interaction . in the final state",
    "there is a quark - antiquark jet , a large rapidity gap , and finally a nucleus with its momentum largely unchanged .",
    "of course we expect that a real nucleus having small binding energies will fragment .",
    "presumably quasi - elastic means here only no inelastic particle production in the central rapidity region . on the other hand for a real hadron , where we imagine the sources as gluons arising from a proper renormalization group treatment of the hadron wavefunction , quasi - elastic means no fragmentation of the hadron .",
    "this leaves open the question of how one treats truly diffractive processes where one allows for some fragmentation of the hadron into pions which have momentum close to the hadron s initial momentum .",
    "presumably one can find a relationship to the quasi - elastic calculation , but we have not been able to do so .    in order to write down the final answer for the @xmath40 production cross ",
    "section it is convenient to work in the rest frame of the nucleus .",
    "analogous to @xcite we assume that the virtual photon ( or the quark ",

    "one should note here that the exact coefficient can not be precisely fixed by this method , since to be able to use @xmath91 as a cutoff in eq .",
    "( [ laq1 ] ) one should reach the kinematic region of large gluon distributions .",
    "this would correspond to evolving @xmath92 with some qcd evolution .",
    "however , in the strict sense , our @xmath91 should be taken only at the lowest order in @xmath79 [ see eq . ( [ lo ] ) below ] .",
    "nevertheless our qualitative conclusions should not be altered by introducing evolution in the gluon distributions .    that way we see that the diffractive structure function in the large @xmath2 limit is linear in @xmath91 with no @xmath2 suppression . due to the multiple rescattering effects ,",
    "the @xmath3 structure function becomes a leading twist expression , i.e. , it is not suppressed by powers of @xmath2 . by resumming higher twist terms",
    "we obtained an answer which is effectively leading twist .",
    "this result agrees with the previous predictions of @xcite .",
    "( [ laq ] ) shows that the diffractive structure function depends on energy in the same way as the structure function @xmath0 at large @xmath2 .",
    "this result agrees with the recent zeus data @xcite .",
    "to generalize the considerations above to the case of a hadron , we first recognize that the renormalization group treatment proposed in @xcite replaces the gluon distribution of a hadron by a set of sources which include both valence quarks and sea gluons .",
    "if we go to small enough x , the gluon density per unit area is large enough so that one can use a weak coupling analysis . in this respect ,",
    "the situation is entirely parallel to that for a nucleus .",
    "the essential difference is that the function which we use to average over sources changes .",

    "to do this we use the fact that the factor @xmath94 is the charge squared per unit area [ as defined in @xcite ] with @xmath95 the space  time rapidity , and the dglap equations @xcite . as was discussed in some detail by mclerran and venugopalan in @xcite the propagator of a single quark through the nucleus",

    "( [ propg ] ) .",
    "@xmath81 is the atomic number of the nucleus .",

    "iii one should make use of the double logarithmic limit of the dglap equation @xmath102 in the quasi  classical calculation of the previous section the gluon distribution function were taken only at the two gluon level . noting that in that two gluon exchange approximation the gluon distribution is given by @xmath103 one can easily see that eq .",
    "( [ prp ] ) reduces to @xmath104 which matches the exponents employed in derivation of eqs .",
    "( [ diffxs ] ) and ( [ diffsf ] ) if one substitutes eq .",
    "( [ vg ] ) into them . that way we showed that the result derived for the structure function of a nucleus [ eq .",
    "( [ diffsf ] ) ] is , probably , also valid for a hadron .",
    "there are two assumptions here .",
    "first is that one can use the dglap equations and the second is that the distribution of sources is local and gaussian .",
    "these are true when one is at high enough momentum transfer so that the density of gluon @xmath105 per unit area is small .",
    "this distribution at large @xmath106 goes as @xmath107 .",
    "as the transverse momentum is lowered therefore the density becomes large and our assumptions break down .",
    "the greatest complication in the small @xmath106 region ( @xmath108 less than or of the order of the color charge density of gluon per unit area ) is that the gaussian distribution changes to a presumably non - gaussian and non - local ( in transverse space ) form . in the exchanges of gluons between the produced jet of quark - antiquark pairs",
    ", some transverse momentum can be absorbed by the source . for local gaussian distributions @xmath109 factorizes into a product of terms such as @xmath110 the locality of this product and its translational invariance are what guarantee that the source absorbs no momentum .",
    "if there is non - locality in the gaussian averaging , then one couples together sources at different transverse coordinates .",
    "there will be overall no transverse momenta transferred to the sum of sources , but there may be momenta transferred to the individual sources at their respective transverse coordinates .",
    "( we have a picture in mind where we have coarse grained in transverse coordinate .",
    "each coordinate cell contains a separate source . )",
    "if this is the case , then the fock space wavefunction of the hadron has been modified somewhat from its original form as in the amplitude one has redistributed the transverse momentum among its various constituents .",
    "the problem has therefore become immensely more complicated .",
    "one should note however that this can only affect the soft transverse momentum part of the hadron wavefunction , so that perhaps this does not spoil the wavefunction so much .",
    "it may also turn out that the non - localities in the renormalization group improved distribution function for sources is small .    as a practical matter , the transverse momentum scale of interest for the non - linearities is presumably the virtuality of the photon @xmath2 . if one is at large @xmath2 , then non - linearities and non - locality is not important . in this case , the exponential factors in eq .",
    "( [ diffsf ] ) linearize , and one is back to the simple two gluon exchange model for diffractive processes .",
    "such a model has been derived in the literature @xcite from various considerations different than those above .",
