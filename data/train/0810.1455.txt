    "the dynamics of the magnetization of single - domain ferromagnetic bodies under various conditions has been studied with widely different motivations .",
    "ferromagnetic resonance has provided perhaps the best known example . in this case a strong static magnetic field * b * generates and stabilizes the single - domain state .",
    "the torque @xmath0 exercised by this field , being perpendicular to @xmath1 , causes a precession of the magnetic moment @xmath2 around the field , leaving the angle between @xmath3 and @xmath1 intact .",
    "the resonance is detected by means of an alternating field perpendicular to @xmath1 , whose energy is absorbed at a maximum rate at the larmor frequency , @xmath4 .    without a strong static field , in a sizable sample",
    "the single - domain state can be only achieved in a material of extremely large permeability .",
    "this requirement dictated the choice of `` soft iron '' in the famous einstein  -  de haas experiment @xcite , which provided the first experimental determination of the gyromagnetic ratio @xmath5 .",
    "the limitation to soft magnetic materials can be circumvented though with very small samples .",
    "clearly , samples smaller than the domain - wall thickness can not contain more than one domain .",
    "the dynamics of the magnetic moment of nanometre - sized single - domain particles is of interest in connection with a number of applications . in magnetic recording ,",
    "the processes taking place in magnetized particles under minor perturbations ( reading ) and during magnetization reversal ( switching ) are of paramount interest . in this case , the nanoparticles are immobile , their place and orientation are fixed .",
    "a fast process of magnetization reversal with minimal losses is the most important requirement for applicability in magnetic recording .",
    "ferrofluids contain mobile magnetic nanoparticles , whose position and orientation can be controlled by a magnetic field . in their application in hyperthermia ,",
    "the most important requirement is the absorption of large losses under repeated magnetization reversal .",
    "more precisely , the figure of merit to be maximized is the specific absorption rate ( also called the specific loss rate , or heating rate ) , i.e. , the amount of energy absorbed per second by a unit mass of magnetic nanoparticles .",
    "the conditions under which maximization has to be realized are quite demanding , as they are dictated by biophysical factors @xcite .",
    "the mobility of magnetic particles in ferrofluids is an important feature in the context of losses under repeated magnetization reversal .",
    "as the particles are free to rotate , the potential energy @xmath6 can be minimized in two ways : either the magnetic moment rotates within the particle until it is aligned with the field , or the particle rotates as a whole .",
    "two different processes are involved , nel and brown relaxation , respectively . in the latter",
    "the energy is transferred directly to the fluid , due to the viscous flow arising at the surface of the particle . in nel relaxation",
    "the energy is transferred to the lattice , i.e. , it is absorbed by phonons and magnons , before ordinary heat transport conveys it to the fluid .",
    "both processes are characterized by appropriate relaxation times , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , a parameterization that conceals the difference between the two mechanisms .",
    "the apparent similarity is further emphasized by the term magnetic viscosity , a misleading synonym for nel relaxation .",
    "the common practice in hyperthermia is to expose magnetic nanoparticles present in a ferrofluid , preferably inside the malignant tumours , to a magnetic field alternating at a frequency of the order of @xmath9 hz .",
    "the optimization of loss energy with respect to the amplitude and frequency of this linearly polarized field has been studied in detail @xcite . however , the effect of circularly polarized field received relatively little attention .",
    "this neglect is not justified though , as there is no obvious reason why the specific absorption rate should be indifferent to the nature of polarization .    in the present paper we report on the first stage of a systematic theoretical study of the dynamic response of a system of magnetic nanoparticles to linearly and circularly polarized magnetic field .",
    "the ultimate goal of this study is an analysis of the criteria for a maximum output of heating power applicable in hyperthermia",
    ". the relative importance of nel and brown relaxations is not clear .",
    "hergst et al .",
    "@xcite have made susceptibility measurements on a colloidal suspension of maghemite ( @xmath5fe@xmath10o@xmath11 ) particles at frequencies ranging from 10 hz and 1 mhz .",
    "the very broad peak in the imaginary part of the susceptibility found at 1 khz disappeared when the particles were made immobile by letting the solvent freeze . in this case , viscous losses ( brownian relaxation ) is clearly dominant .",
    "on the other hand , these authors also pointed out that the mobility of particles trapped in tumour tissue is not known .",
    "if they are clogged to the extent of not being able to rotate , the nel mechanism is the only relaxation process available .",
    "here we present analytic results for an immobilized single - domain particle . in section 2",
    "we briefly summarize the theoretical tools available for the study of the nel mechanism and recapitulate the relation between the landau  lifshitz and gilbert equations .",
    "section 3 treats the case of linearly polarized magnetic fields , for which we present exact analytical solutions of the landau ",
    "lifshitz equation , which are used to determine the heating power as a function of frequency and amplitude of the alternating field . in section 4",
    "approximate analytic solutions are presented for circular polarization , which are exact under specific initial conditions . for arbitrary initial conditions ,",
    "those solutions give an exact description of the dynamics in the steady state , which is stabilized after a short initial transient time - interval .",
    "the heating power is calculated for this steady state .",
    "the most conspicuous feature of the landau ",
    "lifshitz equation is that the vector standing on the right - hand side is perpendicular to the magnetization vector .",
    "it follows then that @xmath25 , that is , the magnetization vector s magnitude does not change under the influence of the external field . therefore ,",

    "therefore , it represents a good framework to look for the general solution of the llg equation or , alternatively , one can try to find approximate solutions of the llg equation .",
    "for example @xmath127 ^ 2 -[m_{\\eta}(t)]^2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] well approximates the numerical solution of the llg equation .",

    "the other consequence of the short transient process is , that irrespective of the initial conditions , the magnetization vector lies in the plane of the rotation , where it follows the driving field with a constant phase slip .",
    "we note that both in the limits of weak and strong relaxation the phase slip @xmath119 goes to zero .",
    "this is seen in the values of the parameters in equation ( [ mx0_my0 ] ) of the special solution ( [ rot_sol_relax_spec ] ) in the appropriate limits : @xmath131 and @xmath132 as in the limit of strong relaxation @xmath133 s@xmath67 values can be achieved . in general , the phase slip will depend on @xmath134 and @xmath33 according to the relation @xmath135 .      to calculate the energy loss per cycle for a single particle we use again equation ( [ def_loss ] ) . the special solution ( [ rot_sol_relax_spec ] ) can be used to assess the merits of circular polarization , because in hyperthermia the field is applied for a long time ( @xmath136 s ) compared to the duration of the initial transient process ( @xmath137 s ) . using this special solution ,",

    "in fact , the definition @xmath149 makes the limit @xmath150 meaningless , because the largest value of @xmath151 is @xmath152 , which is realized at @xmath153 .",
    "we have reported numerical and analytical results on the response of an immobilised single - domain magnetic particle under linearly and circularly polarized magnetic fields .",
    "comparison of the dynamics in the presence and absence of nel relaxation enables an interpretation of the results in terms of an interplay between larmor preccesion and relaxation towards energy minima .    in figure",
    "2a the resulting energy loss per cycle is depicted as a function of frequency and the dimensionless damping parameter @xmath16 . regarding the merits of linear or circular polarization of the magnetic field , we find opposite preferences for frequencies below and above the larmor frequency . in the former case , which is relevant to hyperthermia ,",
    "the energy absorbed by the magnet from linearly polarised field exceeds the absorption from rotating field by orders of magnitude .",
    "apparently the relaxation towards a steady state with a small phase shift between the rotating * h * and * m * fields ensures a smooth process with very small losses .",
    "this can not take place in a linear field , where the orientation of * h * changes abruptly twice in a cycle and relaxation towards the new energy minimum has to be repeated . in the case of high frequencies , which is not lacking technological relevance since the recent interest in materials with high microwave absorption @xcite ,",
    "the relaxation is slow compared to the rate of change of the magnetic field and the loss per cycle becomes frequency dependent .",
    "the tent - shaped curves in figure 2a reflect the relevance of the limiting cases worked out in sections 3.3 and 4.3 .",
    "the low - frequency behaviour , which seems to prevail through many orders of magnitude in frequency , reflects equation ( [ stat_sol_relax ] ) for the case of linear polarization and the first term in equation ( [ loss_rot_weak ] ) for rotating field .",
    "equation ( [ stat_sol_relax ] ) describes a relaxation process , which takes place after each change of sign of @xmath154 , apparently at the same cost in energy as long as the period of the oscillation of the field is much larger than the relaxation time .",
    "the loss per cycle is then always the same and we see no dependence on the damping constant either , except that for weaker damping the deviation from the constant value begins at a lower frequency . equation ( [ loss_rot_weak ] ) shows clearly that for frequencies much lower than the larmor frequency the loss is always proportional to the frequency , the slope scaling with the dimensionless damping factor @xmath16 ( in the log - log plot this translates to straight lines with the same slope , shifted by distances scaling with @xmath16 ) .",
    "in contrast , equations ( [ loss_osc_average_weak ] ) and ( [ loss_rot_max ] ) show that , in both cases , at high frequencies the loss is proportional to @xmath79 , which explains why all curves run parallel , with he same slope , and the dependence of their position on @xmath16 is not monotonic .",
    "figure 2b shows the same data in practical units , that is , it shows the proper specific absorption power in w / g for a single - domain particle of magnetite . at frequencies relevant to hyperthermia ( @xmath155 hz ) with linearly polarized field , respectable losses of kw / g order can be achieved , while the power absorbed from circularly polarized field is two to three orders of magnitude lower .",
    "our final conclusion is obvious : if nel relaxation in isotropic sample is the dominant mechanism , the technical complications of generating a circularly polarised field in difficult geometry need not be considered .",
