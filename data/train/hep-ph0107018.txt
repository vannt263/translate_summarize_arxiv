    "the photon - pion transition process @xmath2 provides a good example for tests of qcd .",
    "this is because , at tree level in pqcd , there only involve electro - magnetic interactions .",
    "the short distance interactions can be calculated in a definite way .",
    "the amplitude for the process @xmath2 can be expressed as @xmath3 , where @xmath4 means the pion momentum , @xmath5 and @xmath6 denote the momentum and polarization of the real photon and @xmath7 is the virtuality of the virtual photon .",
    "the qcd dynamics are contained in the form factor @xmath8 . in pqcd",
    ", the leading form factor @xmath8 can be expressed as f_(q^2)=4c__0 ^ 1 dx with @xmath9 the charge factor and @xmath10 the pion wave function . in the high energy limit @xmath11 ,",
    "the asymptotic of the form factor @xmath12 can be evaluated and have an extremely simple form @xcite @xmath13 that it is only in terms of the pion decay constant , @xmath14 mev and @xmath15 . however , the above asymptotic is about @xmath16 lower than the upper end of the experimental data @xcite .",
    "there have been many explanations about this difference between the theory and the experiment . for expample , the inclusion of nlo correction in @xmath17 @xcite and the transverse structure of the pion wave function @xcite .",
    "it has also been shown @xcite that the data can also be described by the brodsky - lepage interpolating formula @xcite for both @xmath11 and @xmath18 of @xmath8 @xmath19 where @xmath20 gev@xmath21 .",
    "this implies that the nlo power correction , the @xmath0 correction , might be important .    in this paper",
    ", we shall present a perturbative approach to calculate the nlo power correction for form factor @xmath1 .",
    "the calculations are related to the terminology of the collinear expansion @xcite .",
    "the expansion has the following features:(1 ) it preserves individual gauge invariance of the soft function and the hard function;(2 ) it can systematically separate the leading twist ( lt ) contributions from the next - to - leading twist ( nlt ) contributions ; ( 3 ) it encounters the high twist contributions from non - collinear partons , wrong spin projection and higher fock states;(4 ) it is a twist - by - twist expansion and free from twist mixing problem;(5 ) it is a feynman diagram approach such that the parton picture for high twist contributions is preserved .",
    "our main results are summarized as follows .",
    "we shall employ collinear expansion to derive the lt and nlt contributions for tree diagrams of processes @xmath2 .",
    "the nlt contributions to @xmath8 involve four nlt pion das .",
    "two of them come from non - vanishing masses of the valence quarks . by the help of equations of motion ,",
    "the four das are reduced to two das .",
    "the asymptotic forms for the remaining das are employed .",
    "the theory appears in a good agreement with the data .",
    "the organization of the remaining text is as follows .",
    "we sketch the collinear expansion for the process @xmath2 in sec .",
    "ii . the explicit formula up to order @xmath22 of the process @xmath2 are given in sec .",
    "iv is devoted to conclusions .",
    "we sketch the procedures of performing collinear expansion for @xmath2 .",
    "let @xmath23 represent the lowest order amplitude for @xmath24 as depicted in fig .",
    "1(a ) and ( b ) .",
    "the @xmath25 denotes the amplitude for partonic subprocess and the @xmath26 represents the meson da .",
    "the @xmath27 means convolution integral over the loop momentum @xmath28 and the traces over the color indices and spin indices .",
    "if we assign the momentum of the final state photon in the minus light - cone direction , @xmath29 , and the momentum of the light meson in the plus light - cone direction , @xmath30 , then the leading configuration for the process can be a function of the collinear momentum @xmath31 with @xmath32 the fraction of the momentum of the meson carried by the partons . @xmath33 and @xmath34 represent light - like vectors in @xmath35 and @xmath36 directions and satisfy @xmath37",
    "the first step is to perform a taylor expansion for the parton amplitude [ st1 ] _",
    "p(k)=_p(k = x p ) + ( _ p)_(x , x ) w^_^k^^+where we have assumed the low energy theorem _",
    "p(k)|_k = x p=(_p)_(x , x )  . and",
    "have employed @xmath38 and @xmath39 . the leading term @xmath40 contains leading , next - to - leading and higher twist contributions in accord with the spin structures of the leading parton amplitude @xmath41 .",
    "that is those terms are proportional to @xmath42 or @xmath43 .",
    "the terms proportional to @xmath42 would project collinear @xmath44 pair from the meson , while those terms proportional to @xmath43 would not diminish only when the @xmath44 pair carry non - collinear momenta .",
    "the second step is to substitute the leading parton amplitude @xmath41 into the convolution integral with the meson wave function @xmath45 to extract the nlt contribution @xmath46 from the leading one @xmath47 [ st2 ] _",
    "p=_p_0 + _ p_1 + , where @xmath48 and @xmath49 denote the leading and next - to - leading meson das , respectively .",
    "the high twist da @xmath49 contains both short distance and long distance contributions .",
    "the short distance contributions of @xmath49 arise from the non - collinear components of @xmath28 . by the equations of motion",
    ", the non - collinear components of @xmath28 will induce one quark - gluon vertex @xmath50 and one special propagator @xmath51 @xcite .",
    "because that the special propagator is not propagating , the quark - gluon vertex and the special propagator should be included into the hard function , @xmath41 . in this way",
    ", we may factorize @xmath49 as @xmath52 and absorb the short distance piece @xmath53 into @xmath41 .",
    "it leads to the third step [ st3 ] _",
    "p_1&=&_p ( ( _ 1^h)_w^_^ ( _ 1^s)^^ ) & = & ( _ p_1^h)_w^_^ ( _ 1^s)^^  , where @xmath54 containing covariant derivative @xmath55 is implied .",
    "notice that the light - cone gauge @xmath56 assures @xmath57 .",
    "the second term of eq.([st1 ] ) also contribute to high twist corrections , as it convolutes with @xmath48 . the momentum factor @xmath58",
    "will be absorbed by @xmath48 to become a coordinate derivative , denoted as @xmath59 .",
    "consider another nlt contributions @xmath60 from fig .",
    "1(c ) and ( d ) , where @xmath61 contains gauge fields .",
    "we have employed the approximation that @xmath62 is the leading term of @xmath63 .",
    "this comes to the fourth step : [ st4 ] ( _ p)_w^_^ _ 1,^^ + ( _ p)_w^_^_1,a^(_p)_1(_1^s )  , where we have employed @xmath64 .",
    "however , it will be found that @xmath65 diminishes as convoluting with twist-4 da @xmath66 ( see below definition ) . up to nlo",
    ", we may drop the @xmath65 term and arrive at the factorization for tree amplitudes _ 0 + _ 1_p_0 + ( _ p_1^h)_1 where @xmath49 means @xmath67 .",
    "there involves only one nlt da @xmath49 for nlo power corrections .",
    "to proceed , we need to consider the factorizations of the spin indices , the color indices and the momentum integrals over loop partons . for factorization of spin indices ,",
    "we employ the expansion of the meson da into its spin components as _ 0,1 & = & _ _ 0,1^where @xmath68 means dirac matrix @xmath69 .",
    "the factorization of the color indices take the convention that the color indices of the parton amplitudes are extract and attributed to the meson das .",
    "the factorization of the momentum integral is performed by making use of the fact that the leading parton amplitudes depend only on the momentum fraction variables @xmath70 .",
    "the identity can always be used ^1_0 dx_i(x_i - k_in)=1  .",
    "the choice of the lowest twist components @xmath71 of @xmath72 is made by employing the power counting .",
    "consider @xmath73 meson whose high twist da @xmath74 has the fermion index @xmath75 and the boson index @xmath76 .",
    "the fermion index @xmath75 arise from the spin index factorization for @xmath77 fermion lines connecting da and parton amplitude and the boson index @xmath76 denotes the @xmath78 power of momenta in previous collinear expansion and the @xmath79 gluon lines as @xmath80 .",
    "we may write [ pc1 ] ^_1_f;_1_b=_i ^_i-1e^_1_f;_1_b_i^i where @xmath81 denotes a small scale associated with da .",
    "spin polarizers @xmath82 denote the combination of vectors @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "variable @xmath86 represents the twist of da @xmath87 .",
    "the restrictions over projector @xmath88 are [ pc2 ] n__je^_1_f;_1_j_b_i=0 which are due to the fact that polarizers @xmath82 are always projected by @xmath89 .",
    "the dimension of @xmath74 is determined by dimensional analysis [ pc3 ] d()=3f+b-1 by equating the dimensions of both sides of eq.([pc1 ] ) , one can derive the minimum of @xmath86 [ pc4 ] _",
    "i^ = 2f+b+[1-(-1)^b ]  .",
    "it is obvious from eq.([pc4 ] ) that there are only finite numbers of fermion lines , gluon lines and derivatives contributes to a given power of @xmath90 .",
    "the factorization theorem for the nlo power correction should be proven in order to have a confident pqcd formalism . before this can be done",
    ", we can at least show that the collinear expansion is compatible with the conventional approach for proving the factorization theorem .",
    "the conventional approach is based on the factorization of the soft divergences from the ultraviolate divergences arising from the radiative corrections .",
    "the soft divergences are shown to be cancelled or absorbed by the meson wave function such that the parton amplitude is free from the soft divergences .",
    "the ultraviolate divergences can be absorbed by the parton amplitude .",
    "we shall assume that the factorization of the soft and ultrviolate divergences can be done upto nlo power correction .",
    "then , we can show that the the collinear expansion for tree diagrams can be straightforwardly extended to those diagrams containing arbitrary loop corrections .",
    "the starting point is to notice that the collinear expansion for the one loop corrections in the collinear region of the radiative gluons can be written down as [ cla1 ] & & ( _ 0^(0 ) + _ 1^(0)+_0^(1 ) + _ 1^(1))| _ & & _ j=0,1 _ p^(0)_0^(j ) + _",
    "p^(0)(_1^h)^(0)_1^(j)where superscript @xmath91 denote tree and one loop corrections , respectively .",
    "this is because , as the collinear gluons with momentum @xmath92 go through the fermion lines , the valence fermion momenta behave similarly to those in the tree level expansion .",
    "this leads to the fact that the collinear expansions for one loop amplitudes in collinear region can be performed just like for tree amplitudes .",
    "the soft gluon corrections can not affect the collinear expansion .",
    "the cancellations of double logarithms are assured in light - cone gauge by adding ladder and self energy diagrams .",
    "the one loop corrected parton amplitudes are determined by subtracting the amplitudes in collinear and soft regions from the full one loop amplitudes .",
    "following the standard considerations @xcite , the lt parton amplitude @xmath93 and nlt parton amplitude @xmath94 are infrared finite , and the soft divergences are absorbed by @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "the one loop factorization is derived up to nlt order [ cla2 ] & & ( _ 0^(0 ) + _ 1^(0)+_0^(1 ) + _ 1^(1 ) ) & & [ _ i=0 ^ 1 _ p^(i)]&&+[_i=0 ^ 1 _ j=0^i_p^(j)(_1^h)^(i - j ) ]  .",
    "the generalization to arbitrary loop orders can be obtained by iteration .",
    "suppose that = ( _ p)_0_0+(_p)_1_1 where & = & _ i=0^n ^(i )  , ( _ p)_0=_i=0^n ( _ p)_0^(i )  , _ 0,1=_i=0^n _ 0,1^(i)(_p)_1&=&_i=0^n ( _ p)_1^(i )  , where ( _ p)_1^(i)=_j=0^n _ p^(j)(_1^h)^(i - j )  .",
    "the above factorization still holds for @xmath97 order corrections , since the collinear gluons can not attach to the parton amplitudes .",
    "the remaining proof of factorization requires the cancellations of double logarithms of soft divergences , the single soft logarithms absorbed by pion das and the infrared finiteness of the parton amplitudes .",
    "this can be achieved by standard analysis ( see e.g. @xcite ) and it is left to other publish @xcite .",
    "the lowest - order diagrams are displayed in fig .  1 .",
    "by applying the previous collinear expansion to separate the lt and nlt contributions in a factorized form ,",
    "we may write the result as @xmath98 where @xmath6 denotes the polarization vector of the final state photon . the leading order of @xmath8 is calculated from fig.1(a ) and ( b ) as @xmath99 where the charge factor @xmath100 . @xmath101 and @xmath102 mean the charges of @xmath103 and @xmath104 quark in unites of the elementary charge .",
