    "molecular electronics is an active field with many potential applications and novel innovations in nanoelectronic devices @xcite .",
    "an ultimate goal in molecular electronics is to construct molecule - based integrated circuits . to achieve this goal , understanding electron transport through a single - molecule device ( junction ) is a required first step . during the past two decades",
    ", great experimental progress has been made on single - molecule junctions due to advancements in microfabrication and self - assembly techniques @xcite .",
    "in addition , improvements in theoretical modeling have enabled successful explanations and predictions of experimental observations , e.g. , kondo effect@xcite , thermoelectricity @xcite , orbital gating @xcite , destructive quantum interference @xcite , and conductance dependence upon molecular conformation @xcite .",
    "the landauer formula combined with the non - equilibrium green s function method @xcite has become a common approach to analyze electron transport through a single - molecule junction in the absence of applied fields . for a practical device",
    ", the capability of manipulating current by applying such fields is necessary .",
    "therefore , control of electron transport , e.g. , by means of light @xcite or gate electrodes @xcite , is a prime issue for molecular electronics .",
    "light is a potential control tool for operating ultrafast electronic devices due to a wide variety of control options , e.g. , field strength , phase , frequency , and polarization , compared with a static field provided by gate electrodes . since 1960s @xcite electron transport in the presence of a coherent light field",
    "has attracted general interest due to photon assisted tunneling observed in mesoscopic systems exposed to microwave radiation @xcite . in superconductor - insulator - superconductor tunnel junctions",
    "@xcite and semiconductor nanostructures @xcite , light - driven electron transport has been extensively studied for some time .",
    "recently , light - driven electron transport at the molecular level became an emerging field due to experimental improvements in molecular junctions @xcite .",
    "moreover , a wealth of coherent light sources in the visible and the infrared regime , compatible with electronic energy scales of molecular systems , motivated innovative theoretical studies in this field @xcite . within a time - dependent perturbation theory along with the extended hckel model , photon - assisted tunneling was predicted in the presence of high - intensity fields @xcite .",
    "theoretical studies using floquet theory together with a tight - binding model have shown that molecular wires can act as coherent quantum ratchets @xcite , and that current rectification @xcite , shot noise control @xcite , photon - assisted tunneling @xcite , and coherent destruction of tunneling could be observed in a linear molecular wire .",
    "vibrational effects @xcite , memory effects @xcite , and optimal control of shot noise @xcite have been investigated in a two - level model .",
    "however , most studies focus on linear molecular wires or few - level models and neglect the nature of molecular structure , e.g. , cross - conjugated molecules and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons , which offer multiple pathways for tunneling electrons .    multiple pathways in a molecular junction can be regarded as forming a `` network '' , which is of importance in molecular electronics for several reasons .",
    "first , such networks can be thought of as analogous to electric circuits , e.g. , a double - backbone molecule corresponding to a parallel circuit . based on kirchhoff s circuit laws ,",
    "the conductance of two parallel constituents in a circuit equals the sum of the conductance of the individuals .",
    "however , at the molecular scale kirchhoff s circuit laws do not hold since the phase coherence length of tunneling electrons is comparable to the circuit scale , i.e. , quantum interference effects play an important role .",
    "a conductance superposition law in a parallel circuit has been proposed @xcite and experimentally reported @xcite .",
    "second , pathway differences in a network can lead to destructive quantum interference @xcite , which can be exploited to form single - molecule optoelectronic switches @xcite , single - molecule electric revolving doors @xcite , and quantum interference effect transistors @xcite .",
    "destructive quantum interference with tunneling has been experimentally observed in aromatic hydrocarbons @xcite and cross - conjugated molecules @xcite at room temperature , indicating that molecular structure can be a key resource for coherent quantum transport .",
    "third , a network such as a single molecule connected to multi - terminals @xcite could form a nanoscale router . in order to manipulate current in a molecular router , an understanding of the correlation between the molecular structure and current direction",
    "is required .",
    "we present a new general formulation to explore laser - driven transport through three individual networks consisting of ( i ) a two - terminal molecular junction based on phenyl - acetylene macrocycle ( pam ) @xcite , ( ii ) pam with three terminals , and ( iii ) a parallel molecular circuit .",
    "the formulation generalizes a scattering analysis based on single - particle green s functions within the framework of the non - hermitian floquet theory @xcite .",
    "the new formulation is valid for arbitrary strength as well as frequency of a driving field and enables the modeling of light - driven transport through multi - terminal and multi - orbital systems in terms of transmission probabilities .",
    "we will discuss field - amplitude power laws in the weak - field regime , the effects of asymmetric molecule - electrode couplings , and the influence of laser polarization on electron transport through pam .",
    "electron transport through a single - molecule junction in the presence of time - periodic fields can be described by the time - dependent hamiltonian @xmath0 composed of the external - field - driven molecular hamiltonian @xmath1 , the lead ( electrode ) hamiltonian @xmath2 , and the molecule - lead coupling term @xmath3 , i.e. , @xmath4 . to focus on the effect of molecular networks , we remove other possible effects , e.g. , many - body interactions , and adopt a single - electron tight - binding model to describe @xmath1 @xmath5 where @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) are fermion operators which annihilate ( create ) an electron in the atomic orbital @xmath8 in the molecule .",
