    "an important outcome of string theory is the realization that coordinates may become noncommuting operators on a @xmath0-brane [ witten ( 1996 ) , seiberg & witten ( 1999 ) ] .",
    "the result is a fundamental discretization of spacetime due to the commutator [ * * x**@xmath1,**x**@xmath2= i\\,\\theta^{\\mu\\nu}$ ] , where @xmath3 is an antisymmetric matrix , in much the same way as the planck constant @xmath4 discretizes phase space [ gruppuso ( 2005 ) ] .",
    "moreover , noncommutativity is an intrinsic property of spacetime and does not depend on particular features such as curvature .",
    "it was pointed out by smailagic & spalluci ( 2003 ) that noncommutativity replaces point - like structures by smeared objects and so may eliminate the divergences that normally appear in general relativity .",
    "an effective way to model the smearing effect is by the use of the gaussian distribution of minimal length @xmath5 instead of the dirac - delta function . as a result , according to nicolini , smailagic & spalluci ( 2006 ) , the energy density of the static and spherically symmetric smeared and particle - like gravitational source has the form @xmath6 i.e. , the mass @xmath7 is diffused throughout the region of linear dimension @xmath5 due to the uncertainty . using this gravitational source in the einstein field equations ,",
    "the line element was found to be @xmath8 where @xmath9 here @xmath10 is the lower incomplete gamma function .",
    "the classical schwarzschild mass is recovered in the limit as @xmath11 .",
    "( recall that the lower incomplete gamma function starts at the origin , rises sharply , and then approaches unity asymptotically . )",
    "some modification will be required when applying these ideas to thin - shell wormholes , discussed in the next section .",
    "for now we need only to note that the throat is assumed to be a thin shell , a sphere of radius @xmath12 .",
    "so instead of a smeared particle , we have a smeared surface .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to show that the special thin - shell wormholes discussed here are stable to small linearized radial perturbations given a noncommutative - geometry framework , even though they are unstable in the framework of classical general relativity ( gr ) .",
    "for this reason the concentration will be on the smeared spherical surface of radius @xmath13 rather than on smeared point - like structures , since the surface is directly affected by radial perturbations .",
    "a powerful theoretical method for constructing a class of spherically symmetric wormholes from black - hole spacetimes was proposed by visser ( 1989 ) .",
    "the starting point is a spherically symmetric line element @xmath14^{-1}dr^2+r^2(d\\theta^2 +         \\text{sin}^2\\theta\\,d\\phi^2)\\ ] ] describing a black - hole spacetime .",
    "the construction begins with two copies of a black hole and removing from each the four - dimensional region    @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the ( outer ) event horizon .",
    "the topological identification of the timelike hypersurfaces @xmath17 results in a manifold that is geodesically complete and possesses two asymptotically flat regions connected by a throat .",
    "a dynamic analysis depends on the lanczos equations and is now considered standard .",

    "be a function of time , it is shown by poisson & visser ( ( 1995 ) that @xmath26 and @xmath27 ( the overdot denotes the derivatives with respect to @xmath28 . ) since @xmath22 is negative on the sphere , we are dealing with exotic matter .",
    "moreover , since the radial pressure @xmath29 is zero for a thin shell , the weak energy condition is obviously violated .",
    "as noted in the introduction , we are going to be concerned with a special type of thin - shell wormholes , analyzed by kuhfittig ( 2010 ) .",
    "they are characterized by having a  phantom - like \" equation of state @xmath30 , @xmath31 , on the shell , a natural analogue of the chaplygin - gas equation of state used by eiroa ( 2009 ) .    on the question of stability to linearized radial perturbations ,",
    "we assume , as always , that @xmath25 is a function of time .",
    "it it readily checked that @xmath32 which can also be written @xmath33 for a static configuration of radius @xmath13 , we have @xmath34 and @xmath35 . given the equation of state @xmath30 , eq .",
    "( [ e : conservation ] ) can be solved by separation of variables to yield @xmath36    rearranging eq .",
    "( [ e : sigma ] ) , we obtain the equation of motion @xmath37 here the potential @xmath38 is defined as @xmath39 ^ 2.\\ ] ] expanding @xmath38 around @xmath13 , we get @xmath40.\\ ] ] since we are linearizing around @xmath41 , we require that @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "the configuration is in stable equilibrium if @xmath44 .",
    "a discussion of thin - shell wormholes in noncommutative geometry has to take into account the nature of the thin shell .",
    "the reason is that we are now dealing with a surface rather than a point - like structure .",
    "moreover , we would expect the surface to be smeared as a consequence of the intrinsic uncertainty .",
    "so , returning to eq .",
    "( [ e : mass1 ] ) , observe that if a particle is located on the sphere @xmath12 , then its mass is given by @xmath45 here @xmath46 is the corresponding lower incomplete gamma function , a pure translation of eq .",
    "( [ e : gamma1 ] ) by a distance @xmath12 in the @xmath47-direction , i.e. , independent of @xmath48 and @xmath49 , as shown , for example , by rahaman , kuhfittig , chakraborty , usmani & ray ( 2012 ) . to visualize the process , one can simply choose a ray in a particular direction : now the function starts at @xmath12 instead of the origin and approaches @xmath7 asymptotically along the ray .",
    "the concentration on the radial direction is appropriate because we are interested in linearized radial perturbations .",
    "the distance to a smeared object is necessarily smeared .",
    "given the nature of the smearing in noncommutative geometry , we may assume that a smeared distance is proportional to the lower incomplete gamma function .",
    "the reason for this can also be seen from the following heuristic argument : consider @xmath50 for some arbitrary fixed @xmath51 .",
    "then the proper distance @xmath52 between two points is from line element ( [ e : line ] ) @xmath53 which is indeed proportional to @xmath54 .",
    "now , @xmath55 for any small interval @xmath56 containing @xmath51 , so that , for all practical purposes , @xmath52 is proportional to @xmath57 on this interval . as a result ,",
    "the smeared portion of the radius , which is necessarily small , is proportional to @xmath58 ( based on the expression for @xmath52 , the constant of proportionality would not be the same for every @xmath13 .",
    "however , in the qualitative discussion below , the constant of proportionality has no bearing on the outcome and can therefore be taken as unity for any particular @xmath13 . ) for this interpretation to make sense , we have to treat @xmath7 as a constant , just as @xmath13 is treated as a constant in ( [ e : mass2 ] ) .",
    "this is not a new assumption : even eq .",
    "( [ e : mass1 ] ) assumes , unavoidably , a fixed position at @xmath59 .",
    "one can argue that in noncommutative geometry any measured quantity will entail a degree of uncertainty . since the stability question centers around the effect of a radial perturbation on the shell , we need to compare this effect on the two types of surfaces , smeared and unsmeared .",
    "to do so , the values of the other measured quantities need not be known precisely , as we will see in the next section .",
    "recall that for a schwarzschild spacetime we have from line element ( [ e : line1 ] ) that @xmath60 .",
    "( [ e : potential ] ) @xmath61 making use of eq .",
    "( [ e : solution ] ) . from eq .",
    "( [ e : sigma ] ) with @xmath34 @xmath62 hence @xmath63 the first requirement , @xmath42 is met , but not the second . from @xmath64 we obtain the condition @xmath65 substituting in @xmath66 and simplifying , we obtain @xmath67 since @xmath68 must be greater than zero to avoid an event horizon , the last condition can not be met . as a result , there are no stable solutions for the schwarzschild case .    because of its simplicity , eq .",
    "( [ e : doubleprime ] ) provides a convenient bridge to analyzing the smearing effect in noncommutative geometry , i.e. , the effect of having a smeared surface . from ( [ e : smradius ] ) , @xmath69 ( the reason for the change in notation is that @xmath70 is now a function of @xmath47 in the neighborhood of @xmath12 . ) condition ( [ e : v ] ) can be easily met if the smearing is substantial enough , especially if @xmath71 is reasonably close to 2 .    to allow a comparison to the more complicated forms discussed later ,",
    "let us consider the plot of @xmath72 in the neighborhood of the shell . even though we are primarily interested in the qualitative features , we need to choose some specific values for the parameters to obtain a plot .",
    "suppose we arbitrarily choose @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "( for the purpose of illustration , @xmath75 is assumed to be equal to unity . ) being arbitrary choices , the fact that these parameters are smeared quantities is now irrelevant .",
    "( this is also born out in the graphs , as we will see shortly . ) for later convenience we will include @xmath76 on the left side : being a positive quantity , it can not affect the sign of @xmath72 in eq .",
    "( [ e : v ] ) .",

    "( [ e : m ] ) , is reduced in width , so that the region of stability gets ever more narrow : fig .",
    "3 shows @xmath81 for @xmath82 .     and @xmath82 .",
    "the region of stability is much reduced , implying that the wormhole is only stable to very small radial perturbations .",
    ", scaledwidth=60.0% ]    it is important to realize that the graph retains its basic shape regardless of the size of @xmath79 or the size of @xmath71 .    _ remark 1 : _ the invariance of the shape of the graphs shows even more clearly why , qualitatively speaking , the smearing of the parameters involved has no bearing on the stability analysis .",
    "other parameters , such as @xmath22 and the pressure @xmath23 do not come into play at all at this point , even though they are part of the dynamic analysis of the original shell @xmath25 in the gr case .    as a final comment ,",
    "as @xmath79 gets close to zero , the region of stability becomes vanishingly small , and the smaller the interval of concavity for @xmath83 , the smaller the radial perturbations allowed .",
    "_ remark 2 : _ since the smearing effect is necessarily small , the most important applications may very well be found in the quantum regime : submicroscopic thin - shell wormholes with equation of state @xmath30 , @xmath31 , would be stable in a schwarzschild spacetime .",

    "it is also shown that for a stable wormhole we must have @xmath94 to meet this condition .",
    "@xmath95 would have to exceed @xmath75 .",
    "the result is a naked singularity for the black hole .    as before ,",
    "since we now have a smeared surface , we replace @xmath71 by @xmath96 ( recall that there is no need to translate the curve by replacing @xmath47 by @xmath97 . )",
    "we are primarily interested in a comparison to the gr case .",
    "so we retain @xmath93 as a fixed parameter , allowing us to concentrate on the smeared surface , which is subject to the radial perturbation .",

    "the precise value is not needed , however , to draw the conclusion concerning stability , also reiterated next .    if we now arbitrarily let @xmath98 , then inequality ( [ e : naked ] ) yields @xmath99 . to show that the wormhole has a stable region without requiring a naked singularity , we choose @xmath100 and @xmath101 . denoting the lower incomplete gamma function by @xmath102 , we plot @xmath103 the graph is shown in fig .",
