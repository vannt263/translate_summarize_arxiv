    "however , in order to obtain more precise data , the triumf group measured recently the photon energy spectrum of the radiative muon capture ( rmc ) on a proton , @xmath14 and extracted a surprising result @xcite @xmath15 it exceeds the value obtained from omc as much as 44% .",
    "this discrepancy is serious because the theoretical value of @xmath1 is predicted in a fundamental manner based on pcac and agrees with the omc value .",
    "as long as pcac is assumed to be creditable , a doubt may be cast on the result of triumf experiment .",
    "recent calculations @xcite by chiral perturbation also says such a doubt .",
    "however , in order to solve this puzzle , one has to reexamine carefully the beder - fearing formula @xcite , which is a phenomenological model , used to extract the @xmath1 value from the measured rmc spectrum .    in finite nuclei , through the theoretical analyses of omc experimental results ,",
    "it is already reported @xcite that the @xmath16 value is quenched in medium - heavy and heavy nuclei while it is enhanced in light nuclei . since these analyses are carried out before the recent triumf experiment one needs to reconsider those analyses from another viewpoint .",
    "in this paper we present more successful analysis for the recent triumf data and show some progressive results for @xmath16 quenching problems in nucleus by applying our results on proton to nuclear matter .",

    "to describe rmc , we need a radiative axial current , which is used to obtain the transition amplitude of rmc by coupling to the weak current of lepton line .",
    "three different methods are considered in order to construct a radiative axial current .",
    "the 1st method @xcite is to start from the above lagrangians @xmath37 using covariant derivative , by which we introduce a photon field in u(1 ) gauge invariant way .",
    "the outcoming lagrangian gives a radiative axial current , which characteristic is its non - conservation through the explicit chiral symmetry breaking due to the electromagnetic interaction .",
    "the second method @xcite is to use the extended euler equation @xcite for the lagrangian @xmath37 .",
    "the third is to make it directly from the above axial currents , eq.(9 ) , by exploiting it minimal coupling scheme to the momenta of relevant particles .",

    "accordingly , this term was not included in the previous procedure of extracting @xmath1 value from the experimental rmc photon energy spectrum @xcite .",
    "the above transition amplitude can be also understood in terms of pseudo vector ( pv ) coupling scheme between nucleons and virtual pion , through which external axial current interacts with nucleons .",

    ", muon capture is dominated through the ortho and para @xmath72 molecular states @xcite .",
    "since these molecular states can be attributed to the combinations of hyperfine states of @xmath73 atomic states @xcite i.e. single and triplet states , we decompose the statistical spin mixture @xmath74 into such hyperfine states by reducing @xmath75 matrix elements to @xmath76 spin matrix elements . at this step ,",

    "then the nucleus are the fermi gas .",
    "our rmc capture rate in nuclear matter is given in the following way    @xmath77    where the integration intervals of nucleon momenta , which comes from the pauli blocking in nuclear matter , are calculated in detailed kinematics and @xmath78 is the fermi momentum .",
    "for finite nuclei , we need to know the corresponding muon wave functions and @xmath78 values , but which depends on the model . we already suggested a model @xcite for this purpose , but will be skipped here and concentrate on the case of nuclear matter .",

    "this curve is obviously much lower than the solid curve .",
    "when @xmath66 term is taken into account for @xmath16 = 6.77 , we obtain the dashed curve which is very close to the solid curve for the energy spectrum on @xmath80",

    "since the contribution of @xmath81 degree of freedom is known to be a few percent @xcite , it is not included in the present calculation .",
    "vector mesons such as @xmath85 and @xmath86 are also turned out to have very small contributions in this calculation .",
    "higher order terms are pointed out to be insignificant @xcite .",
    "it is confirmed that the matrix elements upto the @xmath65 term in eq.(19 ) satisfy gauge invariance .",
    "however , it is broken when the @xmath66 term and @xmath81 degree of freedom are included . as far as diagram method is adopted ,",
    "the gauge invariance is more or less broken because a series of diagrams will be cut somewhere . in order to estimate the rate of gauge invariance broken by the @xmath66 term",
    ", we evaluated the spectrum with @xmath66 alone .",
    "the result is shown by a dot - dashed curve in fig.1 .",
    "the gauge invariance breaking is not so large as expected .",
    "however , in the limit @xmath87 , the gauge invariance is restored .    in spite of such a burden of gauge invariance , our present calculation shows that @xmath16 = 6.77 is reasonable for both omc and rmc on a proton .",
    "figure 2 shows the photon energy spectrum in nuclear matter , which is presented as the ratio of rmc to omc in order to reduce the uncertainty from the nuclear structure . we compared our amplitude to fearing s analysis , which is ps coupling and has been used to extract the @xmath16 from the experimental data . at the same @xmath16 ,",
    "our ratio r is higher than the ps coupling scheme .",
    "it means that @xmath16 value to fit some experimental data becomes lower in our pv scheme .",
    "therefore @xmath16 quenching rate is smaller than the usual ps coupling scheme .",
    "these behaviour are nearly independent of effective nucleon mass in nuclear matter ( see the solid , dotted and dashed lines ) .",
    "figure 3 shows another interesting results for @xmath16 quenching in finite nuclei .",
    "the larger @xmath78 , which may mean the heavier nuclei , the smaller becomes the ratio r. as a result , @xmath16 quenching may be larger in heavier nuclei .",
    "but in relatively lower @xmath78 region just reversed results are shown .",
    "consequently @xmath16 may be enhanced in lower @xmath78 region . since we have to integrate the nucleon s fermi motion from the possible lowest momentum up to the fermi momentum , the mechanism in lower @xmath78 region could play a role of compensating @xmath16 quenching in larger @xmath78 region .",
