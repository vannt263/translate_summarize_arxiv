    "the fact that structure of initial cosmological singularity can be rather complicated have been recognized since 60-th of the last century when the conception of bkl chaos have been presented  @xcite .",
    "it appears that kasner solution being a general solution for a vacuum bianchi i universe becomes unstable in the case of metric with positive spatial curvature ( belonging to bianchi ix class ) and is replaced by a complicated sequence of transient `` kasner epochs '' .",
    "later it was found that some classes of an anisotropic matter can induce similar type of cosmological behavior even in flat bianchi i case .",
    "this can be shown for a magnetic field by leblanc  @xcite and for a general vector field by kirillov  @xcite .",
    "the bkl analogs for the flat magnetic universe is a typical behavior when off - diagonal terms in the metric in the frame determined by magnetic field are present . for a diagonal case",
    "see for example @xcite .",
    "possible generalisation of these results may involve studies in the framework of multidimensional cosmology as well as alternative gravity theories .",
    "analogs of magnetic field for multidimensional space - times have been studied in  @xcite .",
    "if we want to introduce some corrections to einstein gravity , the first goal is to find a solution which replaces kasner solution for a flat anisotropic universe . in the present paper",
    "we consider lovelock gravity as a generalization of general relativity .",
    "the principal feature of lovelock gravity is that this theory keeps the order of equations of motion the same as in gr , while other theories ( like popular now @xmath1-theory ) results in increasing of the number of derivatives in equations of motion .",
    "another important property of lovelock gravity is that it gives corrections to gr only in higher - dimensional space - time , so it is natural to consider it in the framework of multidimensional cosmology .",
    "as the number of non - einstein terms in lovelock gravity is finite for any given dimensionality of space - time , it is possible to consider regimes when these terms are not only small corrections to einstein gravity . in particular , it is reasonable to expect that the highest order lovelock term , consisting of highest power of curvature invariants , dominates near a cosmological singularity . in the present paper",
    "we consider the second lovelock term , which is the famous gauss - bonnet combination .",
    "it is the highest possible lovelock term for @xmath2 and @xmath0 dimensional spacetimes .",
    "as cosmology in the @xmath2 dimensional case has some pathological features , we restrict ourselves by the @xmath3 dimensional case with @xmath4 in the present paper .    in late 80-th some vacuum solutions for a flat anisotropic universe in gauss - bonnet gravity for @xmath5 have been found  @xcite .",
    "they replace kasner solution of gr . later these solutions have been rediscovered and verified for @xmath6 in  @xcite ; after that this solution have been generalized for all @xmath7 and also to the general lovelock gravity  @xcite .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to address question of its stability near the initial singularity .",
    "it is known that in the presence of an ordinary isotropic matter these solutions are stable to the past if the matter has the equation of state with @xmath8 , otherwise the solution tends to isotropic one  @xcite . for more interesting regimes near a singularity",
    "it is necessary to consider either anisotropic matter or curved geometries .",
    "as introduction of spatial curvature usually leads to very cumbersome equations of motion , we have chosen a magnetic fields as a possible source of instability . in this paper",
    "we restrict ourselves by the diagonal case .",
    "it is also known that in contrast to einstein gravity certain initial conditions lead to exponential solutions instead to those of power - law behavior  @xcite , we do not consider them in the present paper .",

    "[ preliminaries ] we describe the metric and matter content of the model studied , in sec .  [ 3 ] the model is investigated in the framework of einstein relativity .",
    "we present results on stability of kasner solution in the presence of magnetic field . the same model in gauss - bonnet gravity",
    "is studied in sec .  [ 4 ] with presentation made as parallel as possible to presentation in the preceding section in order to compare einstein and gauss - bonnet cases . in sec .",

    "in what follows we use a reference system chosen so that : in this section we looking for the energy - momentum tensor of a pure magnetic field in @xmath3-dimensional space - time . in the general case components of the energy - momentum tensor of the electromagnetic field are where @xmath9 is the faraday tensor .",
    "the components of the faraday tensor obey the following equations : or , in more detail : where @xmath10 . as it is known therefore we may rewrite system  ( [ sys ] ) in the form the components of the riemann connection have the form : its other components are equal to zero .",
    "since we consider the case of a homogenous space , faraday tensor depends on time @xmath11 only ; then , in view of  ( [ riem - conn ] ) the system  ( [ f ] ) takes the form : its solutions are hereinafter we will be interested in the case of a pure magnetic field ; so that @xmath12 and , as a consequence , in what follows we will deal with diagonal energy - momentum tensor ; in view of  ( [ g]),([t]),([psi ] ) and ( [ f0 m ] ) it implies that functions @xmath13 are linearly independent , therefore from  ( [ nondiag - t=0 ] ) it follows that each @xmath14 is multiplied by all that @xmath15 , which has one of the indices @xmath16 coincident with one of the indices @xmath17",

    ", we find the number of zero magnetic field components : we took into account that the number of pairs of indices without the same elements equals to @xmath25 for an odd dimensions and to @xmath26 for an even dimensions .",
    "the total number of components of the magnetic field is @xmath27 ; then the number @xmath28 of non - zero magnetic field components is in what follows they are exactly @xmath29 that we set to be non - zero ; other components of the faraday tensor are assumed to be zero .",
    "thus , components of the energy - momentum tensor of the electromagnetic field take the form : hereinafter it will be convenient to use notations like this : we assume that",
    "the action reads : where @xmath30 and @xmath9 are scalar curvature and faraday tensor respectively . here and after we use planck units : @xmath31 is the planck mass .",
    "the gravitational equations is given by where are the components of the einstein tensor .",
    "taking into account  ( [ g ] ) we get : as we consider the diagonal case here , then in view of  ( [ tmunu]),([t00-tnn]),([grav - eq]),([g00-gnn ] ) for an even number of dimensions the gravitational equations can be written as note that each expression like  ( [ grav - eq - basic - even ] ) describes two equations with numbers @xmath32 and @xmath33 simultaneously ( we use the notation  ( [ < n > ] ) here ) . in the case of an odd number of dimensions there is one more equation in addition to these : the left side of the expression  ( [ first - int ] ) is a first integral of  ( [ grav - eq - basic - even ] ) .      when there is no any matter the equations  ( [ grav - eq - basic - even])-([grav - eq - basic - odd ] ) lead to : these equations has the following solutions  @xcite : as a consequence , components of the metric tensor follows a power law : this is well - known multidimensional kasner solution .",
