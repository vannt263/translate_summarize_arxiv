    "the electromagnetic ( e.m . ) current operator and the states of a system must have correct transformation properties with respect to the _ same _ representation of the poincar group . for systems of interacting particles",
    "some of the poincar generators are interaction dependent and , therefore , it is not a simple task to construct a current operator , able to fulfill the proper poincar , parity and time reversal covariance , as well as current conservation , hermiticity and charge normalization . instead of including perturbatively the relativistic properties through @xmath3 series , or considering field - theoretic approaches , we adopt the front - form hamiltonian dynamics @xcite with a fixed number of particles , which includes relativity in a coherent , non - perturbative way and allows one to retain a large amount of the successfull phenomenology developed within the `` non - relativistic '' domain . in this dynamics seven , out of ten ,",
    "poincar generators are interaction free .",
    "in particular , the lorentz boosts are interaction free and the states can be written as products of total momentum eigenstates times intrinsic eigenstates . in the two - body case ,",
    "if the mass operator , @xmath4 , for the intrinsic functions is defined according to @xmath5 ( with @xmath6 the free mass operator and @xmath7 the interaction operator ) , then the mass equation has the same form as the nonrelativistic schroedinger equation in momentum representation @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite(a ) it was shown that all the requirements of poincar covariance can be satisfied , if , in the breit frame where the momentum transfer , @xmath8 , is directed along the spin - quantization axis , @xmath9 , the current operator is covariant with respect to rotations around @xmath9 . since in the front form the rotations around the @xmath9 axis",
    "are kinematical , the extended poincar covariance ( i.e. , poincar covariance plus parity and time reversal covariance ) is satisfied by a current operator which in our breit frame is given by the sum of free , one - body currents ( i.e. , @xmath10 , with n the number of constituents in the system ) . the hermiticity can be easily implemented and , in the elastic case , the extended poincar covariance plus hermiticity imply current conservation @xcite(a , e ) .",
    "our poincar covariant current operator has been already succesfully tested in the case of deep inelastic scattering @xcite(b ) . in this paper",
    "we calculate deuteron e.m .",
    "properties ; more details for the magnetic moment and the quadrupole moment and other results for the deuteron elastic form factors ( f.f . ) can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite(e ) and @xcite(c , d ) , respectively .",
    "in the elastic case , for a system of spin @xmath11 one has only @xmath12 non - zero independent matrix elements for the current defined in ref .",

    "form factors is no more plagued by the ambiguities which are present when , as usual , the free current is considered in the reference frame where @xmath13 ( indeed , if the current is taken free in the @xmath14 frame , one has four independent matrix elements to calculate the three deuteron f.f .",
    "@xcite ) .    our results for the deuteron magnetic and quadrupole moments , corresponding to different @xmath15 interactions ,",
    "are reported in fig . 1 , together with the non relativistic ones , against the deuteron asymptotic normalization ratio @xmath16 .",
    "a remarkable linear behaviour appears for both quantities and in our poincar covariant calculation the relativistic effects bring both @xmath17 and @xmath18 closer to the experimental values , except for the charge - dependent bonn interaction @xcite .",

    ", as well known , so that it can not be described , together with @xmath25 and @xmath26 , by a simple fit of the neutron form factors . in order to obtain a more precise description of the data one should explicitly introduce two - body currents , which will have to fulfill separately the constraints of extended poincar covariance and hermiticity .",
    "a more stringent comparison with new tjnaf data for @xmath26 will be possible in the near future .",

    "all the necessary requirements for extended poincar covariance , hermiticity , current conservation and charge normalization can be satisfied by a current obtained by free , one - body terms in that frame @xcite(a , e ) .",

    ", without any ambiguity .",
    "we were able to obtain , for the first time in a covariant relativistic approach without _ ad hoc _ assumptions on the values of specific matrix elements of the current , unambiguos results for both @xmath17 and @xmath18 , close to the experimental data @xcite(e ) .",
    "the f.f . @xmath25 and",
    "@xmath26 show remarkable effects from different models for the nucleon f.f . , while @xmath31 has an higher dependence on different @xmath15 interactions .",
    "our approach , based on the reduction of the whole complexity of the poincar covariance to the su(2 ) symmetry @xcite(a ) , can represent a simple framework where to investigate the many - body terms to be added to the free current .",
