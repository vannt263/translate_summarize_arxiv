    "the effect of passing an electric current down a ferromagnetic wire is of great current interest .",
    "if the magnetization is inhomogeneous it experiences a spin - transfer torque due to the current @xcite .",
    "the effect is described phenomenologically by adding terms to the standard llg equation @xcite .",
    "the leading term in the spin - transfer torque is an adiabatic one arising from that component of the spin polarization of the current which is in the direction of the local magnetization .",
    "however , in considering the current - induced motion of a domain wall , li and zhang @xcite found that below a very large critical current the adiabatic term only deforms the wall and does not lead to continuous motion . to achieve this effect they introduced @xcite a phenomenological non - adiabatic term associated with the same spin non - conserving processes responsible for gilbert damping .",
    "subsequently kohno _ et al _ @xcite derived a torque of the zhang - li form quantum - mechanically using a model of spin - dependent scattering from impurities .",
    "this may arise from spin - orbit coupling on the impurities .",
    "more recently wessely _",
    "et al _ @xcite introduced two further non - adiabatic terms in the llg equation in order to describe their numerical calculations of spin - transfer torques in a domain wall .",
    "these quantum - mechanical calculations using the keldysh formalism were made in the ballistic limit without impurities and with spin conserved .",
    "other terms in the llg equation , involving mixed space and time derivatives , have been considered by sobolev _",
    "et al _ @xcite , tserkovnyak _ et al _ @xcite , skadsen _ et al _ @xcite and thorwart and egger @xcite .",
    "the object of this paper is to give a unified treatment of all these terms in the llg equation and to obtain explicit expressions for their coefficients by quantum - mechanical calculations for a simple one - band model with and without impurity scattering .",
    "the strategy adopted is to consider a uniformly magnetized wire and to calculate the effect of a current on the energy and lifetime of a long wavelength spin wave propagating along the wire .",
    "it is shown in section 2 that coefficients of spin - transfer torque terms in the llg equation are directly related to @xmath0 and @xmath1 terms in the energy and inverse lifetime of a spin wave of wave - vector @xmath0 .",
    "the gilbert damping parameter is the coefficient of the @xmath2 term in the inverse lifetime , where @xmath2 is the spin - wave frequency .",
    "it corresponds to the damping of a @xmath3 spin wave while higher order terms @xmath4 and @xmath5 relate to damping of spin waves with finite wave - vector @xmath0 .",
    "the relation between the @xmath0 term in the spin wave energy and the adiabatic spin - transfer torque has been noticed previously @xcite .",
    "we find that the @xmath0 term in the spin wave lifetime relates to the zhang - li non - adiabatic spin transfer torque .",
    "our result for the coefficient of the zhang - li term is essentially the same as that obtained by kohno _",
    "et al _ @xcite and duine _ et al _ @xcite but our derivation appears simpler .",
    "the @xmath1 terms in the spin wave energy and lifetime are related to the additional non - adiabatic torques we introduced into the llg equation @xcite , together with an extra one arising from spin non - conserving scattering .",
    "explicit expressions for the coefficients of these terms are obtained in section 3 . in section 4",
    "we discuss briefly the importance of the additional terms in our extended llg equation for current - driven motion of a domain wall .",

    "@xmath16 is a unit vector in the @xmath10 direction along the wire .",
    "the equation expresses the rate of change of spin angular momentum as the sum of various torque terms , of which the @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 terms are proportional to the electric current flowing . the second term in the equation is the standard gilbert term , with damping factor @xmath24 , while the @xmath18 and @xmath25 terms introduce corrections for spin fluctuations of finite wave - vector .",
    "et al _ @xcite point out the existence of the @xmath25 term but do not consider it further .",
    "it was earlier introduced by sobolev _",
    "et al _ @xcite within a microscopic context based on the heisenberg model .",
    "the @xmath17 and @xmath26 terms are found to renormalise the spin wave frequency , but for the model considered in section 3 we find that @xmath17 is identically zero .",
    "we shall argue that this result is model - independent .",
    "et al _ @xcite and thorwart and egger @xcite find non - zero values of @xmath17 which differ from each other by a factor 2 ; they attribute this to their use of stoner - like and @xmath27 models , respectively .",
    "thorwart and egger @xcite also find the @xmath18 term and they investigate the effect of @xmath17 and @xmath18 terms on domain wall motion .",
    "their results are difficult to assess because the constant @xmath28 is not maintained during the motion . in eq.([eq:1 ] ) we have omitted terms involving the second order time derivatives , whose existence was pointed out by thorwart and egger @xcite ; one of these is discussed briefly in section 3.2 .    the first term on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) is due to exchange stiffness and the next term arises from an external magnetic field @xmath29 with dimensionless coefficient @xmath30 .",

    "@xcite , the first term vanishes and we recover the @xmath42 term of eq.(9 ) in ref . @xcite .",
    "its derivative form indicate that it arises from spin - conserving processes so we conclude that the coefficient @xmath22 is of that origin .",
    "this is not true of the last term in eq.([eq:1 ] ) and we associate the coefficient @xmath23 with spin non - conserving processes . for a spin wave solution of the llg equation , where we work only to first order in deviations from a state of uniform magnetisation , the last three terms of eq.([eq:1 ] ) may be replaced by the simpler ones @xmath43 apart from additional terms , eq.([eq:1 ] ) looks slightly different from eq.(7 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite because we use the spin polarisation unit vector @xmath44 rather than the magnetisation vector @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "furthermore the dimensionless coefficients will take different numerical values because we have used different dimensionless variables @xmath10 and @xmath8 to avoid introducing the domain wall width which was specific to ref .",
    "the torques due to anisotropy fields were also specific to the domain wall problem and have been omitted in eq.([eq:1 ] ) .",
    "we suppose that the wire is magnetised uniformly in the @xmath10 direction and consider a spin wave as a small transverse oscillation of the spin polarisation about the equilibrium state or , when a current flows , the steady state .",
    "thus we look for a solution of eq.([eq:1 ] ) of the form @xmath47 where the coefficients of the @xmath48 and @xmath49 components satisfy @xmath50 , @xmath51 .",
    "this represents a spin wave of wave - vector @xmath0 and angular frequency @xmath2 propagating along the @xmath10 axis .",

    "this form for the real and imaginary parts of the spin wave frequency is convenient for comparing with the quantum - mechanical results of the next section . in this way",
    "we shall obtain explicit expressions for all the coefficients in the phenomenological llg equation .",
    "coefficients of odd powers of @xmath0 are proportional to the current flowing whereas terms in even powers of @xmath0 are present in the equilibrium state with zero current .",
    "as a simple model of an itinerant electron ferromagnet we consider the one - band hubbard model @xmath61 where @xmath62 creates an electron on site @xmath63 with spin @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "we consider a simple cubic lattice and the intersite hopping described by the first term is restricted to nearest neighbours .",
    "the second term describes an on - site interaction between electrons with effective interaction parameter @xmath66 ; the last term is due to an external magnetic field .",
    "it is convenient to introduce a bloch representation , with @xmath67 the sum in eq.([eq:12a ] ) is over all lattice cites @xmath68 whereas in eq.([eq:12b ] ) @xmath69 are the nearest neighbour lattice sites . then @xmath70 to discuss scattering of spin waves by dilute impurities we assume that the effect of the scattering from different impurity sites adds incoherently ; hence we may consider initially a single scattering center at the origin , we therefore introduce at this site a perturbing potential @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is a unit vector whose direction will finally be averaged over .",
    "@xmath73 is the part of the impurity potential which is indepndent of the spin @xmath74 and the spin dependent potential @xmath75 is intended to simulate a spin - orbit @xmath76 interaction on the impurity .",
    "it breaks spin rotational symmetry in the simplest possible way .",
    "clearly spin - orbit coupling can only be treated correctly for a degenerate band such as a @xmath53-band , where on - site orbital angular momentum @xmath77 occurs naturally .",
    "the present model is equivalent to that used by kohno _",
    "et al _ @xcite and duine _ et al _ @xcite .",
    "in bloch representation the impurity potential becomes @xmath78 with @xmath79 and @xmath80 , @xmath81 . to avoid confusion",
    "we note that the spin dependence of the impurity potential which occurs in the many - body hamiltonian @xmath82 is not due to exchange , as would arise in an approximate self consistent field treatment ( e.g. hartree - fock ) of the interaction @xmath66 in a ferromagnet .",
    "in this section we neglect the perturbation due to impurities and determine expressions for the energy and wave function of a long - wave length spin wave in the presence of an electric current .",
    "the presence of impurities is recognised implicitly since the electric current is characterised by a perturbed one - electron distribution function @xmath83 which might be obtained by solving a boltzman equation with a collision term .",
    "we consider a spin wave of wave - vector @xmath84 propagating along the @xmath10 axis , which is the direction of current flow .",
    "lengths and times used in this section and the next , except when specified , correspond to actual physical quantities , unlike the dimensionless variables used in section 2 .",
    "we first consider the spin wave with zero electric current and treat it , within the random phase approximation ( rpa ) , as an excitation from the hartree - fock ( hf ) ground state of the hamiltonian ( [ eq:13 ] ) .",

    "the origin of the small @xmath22 term for a pure ferromagnetic metal was specific to the domain wall problem ; it was shown to be associated with those electronic states at the bulk fermi surface which decay exponentially as they enter the wall .",
    "the analytic derivation of @xmath22 in section 3 ( see eqn.([eq:54 ] ) ) is based on impurity scattering in the bulk ferromagnet and applies generally to any slowly - varying magnetization configuration . for a ferromagnetic alloy such as permalloy both mechanisms should contribute in the domain wall situation but the impurity contribution",
    "would be expected to dominate .    to describe a domain wall",
    "we must add to the right - hand side of eqn.([eq:1 ] ) anisotropy terms of the form @xmath237 where @xmath238 is a unit vector perpendicular to the plane of the wire .",
    "the first term corresponds to easy - plane shape anisotropy for a wire whose width is large compared with its thickness and the second term arises from a uniaxial field @xmath239 along the wire , so that @xmath240 .",
    "the solution of eqn.([eq:1 ] ) , with the additional terms ( [ eq:57 ] ) , for a stationary nel wall in the plane of the wire , with zero external field and zero current , is @xmath241 as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite there is no solution of the llg equation of the form @xmath242 , corresponding to a uniformly moving domain wall , when the @xmath22 term is included .",
    "it is likely that the wall velocity oscillates about an average value , as predicted by tatara and kohno @xcite for purely adiabatic torque above the critical current density for domain wall motion .",
    "however , we may estimate the average velocity @xmath243 using the method of ref .",
    "the procedure is to substitute the approximate form @xmath242 in the extended llg equation ( [ eq:1 ] ) , with the terms ( [ eq:57 ] ) added , take the scalar product with @xmath244 and integrate with respect to @xmath10 over the range @xmath245 .",

    "@xmath22 and @xmath25 are important because they do not depend on spin - orbit coupling .",
    "it is interesting to compare @xmath243 with the wall velocity observed in permalloy nanowires by hayashi _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "we first note that @xmath254 is the velocity which one obtains very simply from spin angular momentum conservation if the current - driven wall moves uniformly without any distortion such as tilting out of the easy plane and contraction @xcite .",
    "this is never the case , even if @xmath255 , @xmath256 , unless @xmath257 . for a permalloy nanowire , with @xmath258 t , @xmath259 m / s for @xmath260a/@xmath261 .",

    "in fact hayashi _",
    "et al _ @xcite measure a velocity of 110 m / s which implies @xmath263 since the spin polarization @xmath264 is certainly less than 1 .",
    "they suggest that @xmath265 can not exceed @xmath24 and that some additional mechanism other than spin - transfer torque is operating . however in the discussion following eqn.([eq:53 ] ) we pointed out that in the model calculations it is possible to have @xmath263 . even if this is not the case in permalloy we can still have @xmath266 if the last factor in eqn.([eq:60 ] ) is greater than 1 when @xmath22 and @xmath25 are non - zero .",
    "we can estimate terms in this factor using the observation from ref .",
    "@xcite , that @xmath267 nm , where @xmath268 is the width of the wall . from eqns.([eq:52 ] ) and ( [ eq:54 ] ) we find @xmath269 , where @xmath270 is a fermi wave - vector .",
    "in permalloy we have fe impurities in ni so that in the impurity potential @xmath271 we estimate @xmath272 1 ev and @xmath273 0.005 ev . the value for @xmath216 is estimated by noting that the potential @xmath274 is intended to model spin - orbit coupling of the form @xmath275 with @xmath276 ev and @xmath277 0.05 , @xmath278 being the component of orbital angular momentum in the direction of the magnetization @xcite .",
    "hence @xmath279 and @xmath280 so that @xmath281 .",
    "@xmath282 is expected to be of similar magnitude .",
    "we conclude that the @xmath25 and @xmath22 terms in the llg equation ( [ eq:1 ] ) can be important in domain wall motion and should be included in micromagnetic simulations such as oommf @xcite . for",
    "narrower domain walls these terms may be larger than the gilbert damping @xmath24 and non - adiabatic spin- transfer torque @xmath20 terms which are routinely included .",
    "reliable estimates of their coefficients are urgently required using realistic multiband models of the ferromagnetic metal or alloy .",
    "the coefficients of all the terms in an extended llg equation for a current - carrying ferromagnetic wire have been calculated for a simple model .",
    "two of these ( @xmath22 and @xmath25 ) are of particular interest since they do not rely on spin - orbit coupling and may sometimes dominate the usual damping and non - adiabatic spin - transfer torque terms .",
    "one term ( @xmath17 ) which has been introduced by previous authors is shown rigorously to be zero , independent of any particular model .",
    "solutions of the extended llg equation for domain wall motion have not yet been found but the average velocity of the wall is estimated .",
    "it is pointed out that the @xmath22 and @xmath25 terms are very important for narrow walls and should be included in micrmagnetic simulations such as oommf .",
    "it is shown that there is no theoretical reason why the wall velocity should not exceed the simplest spin - transfer estimate @xmath254 , as is found to be the case in experiments on permalloy by hayashi _",
    "et al _ @xcite    we are grateful to the epsrc for financial support through the spin@rt consortium and to other members of this consortium for encouragement and stimulation .    [ [ section ] ]",
    "the simple single - band impurity model used in the main text is useful for obtaining explicit expressions for all the coefficients in the llg equation ( [ eq:1 ] ) . here",
    "we wish to show that some of these results are valid for a completely general system .",
