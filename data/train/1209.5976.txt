    "many empirical studies have shown strong evidence against some of the underlying assumptions of the black - scholes  @xcite model , in particular the constant value that is assumed for the volatility .",
    "the incorporation of stochastic volatility in modeling the dynamics of asset returns plays a major role in explaining some of the stylized properties of financial time series .",
    "in particular , the pricing and hedging of options based on stochastic volatility ( sv ) models have been frequently studied in both discrete and continuous - time .",
    "the discrete - time literature has been dominated by the generalized autoregressive conditionally heteroskedastic ( garch ) models introduced by engle  @xcite and bollerslev  @xcite .",
    "although these models have been extensively investigated for pricing , they have rarely been used for option hedging purposes .",
    "the first proposal in this direction can be found in duan  @xcite who introduced a delta hedge obtained as the partial derivative of the option price with respect to the price of the underlying and computed it using monte carlo simulations in order to evaluate the corresponding locally risk neutralized valuation relationship ( lrnvr ) expectation .",
    "other approaches for computing this hedge ratio include the finite difference method proposed by engle and rosenberg  @xcite or the adjusted black scholes delta hedging computations based on analytic approximations of garch option prices ( see e.g. choi  @xcite ) .",
    "kallsen and taqqu  @xcite proposed a continuous time garch process under which the associated markets are complete and also investigated hedging in the black - scholes sense .",
    "duan s  @xcite definition of the delta hedge has been subjected to criticisms , the most important coming from garcia and renault  @xcite who pointed out that this specification ignores the fact that the option price depends also on the conditional variance , which is itself a function of the asset price .",
    "they showed that when the option price is homogeneous of degree one with respect to the asset price and the strike price , then the option delta hedge is consistent with duan s formulation .",
    "further discussions on homogeneity of option prices and delta hedging for scale - invariant models are provided in bates  @xcite and alexander and nogueira  @xcite . in order to take into account the stochastic volatility environment of garch models , engle and rosenberg  @xcite considered the computation of the option s deltas and gammas using the chain rule and studied the modifications in empirical performance when hedging options with changing variance term structure for different volatility specifications .",
    "the techniques briefly described above try to extend the hedging designed for complete markets to a garch context , and therefore are not optimal in the incomplete market setting , that is , the use of continuous time hedging ratios for discrete - time models may generate additional hedging errors .",
    "thus , various other hedging techniques have been proposed in the financial literature by minimizing different measures for the hedging error .",
    "one of the most influential strategies in this direction has been the local risk minimization scheme introduced by fllmer , schweizer , and sondermann ( see  @xcite , and references therein ) ; this approach uses the notion of sequential regressions in order to construct a generalized trading strategy ( not necessarily self - financing ) that minimizes daily squared hedging errors .",
    "local risk minimization is particularly convenient in the discrete time setup because it is well adapted to recursive algorithmic implementations and can be tuned to minimize hedging errors related to arbitrary prescribed hedging frequencies .",
    "the standard approach for constructing local risk minimization hedges is to minimize the conditional expected value of the quadratic cost of hedging under the historical probability measure .",
    "this optimization procedure also gives rise to a contingent claim price computed in the risk neutral world with the well - known minimal martingale measure .",
    "although local risk minimization has been widely used for pricing and hedging financial derivatives based on continuous time models , its implementation in discrete - time , and in particular for garch models , raises some issues .",
    "for example , in ortega  @xcite it has been shown that in the garch context the minimal martingale measure is signed , and it is only under very restrictive hypotheses ( the model innovations are required to be bounded ) that option prices arising from local risk minimization using the physical measure are guaranteed to be arbitrage free .",
    "additionally , a number of situations have been identified ( see e.g. ern and kallsen  @xcite ) in which the local minimization of squared hedging errors does not guarantee the minimization of the final unconditional expected squared hedging error ; this point has motivated recent important work which targets the minimization of the global hedging risk ( see e.g. ern and kallsen  @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , one has to consider the local quadratic minimization in a different context .    in this paper",
    "we provide a unified framework for the local risk minimization and the standard minimum variance delta hedges for a general class of asymmetric non - gaussian garch models .",
    "firstly , we introduce local risk minimization with respect to a martingale measure for different hedging frequencies under a garch model with an unspecified distribution for the driving noise . when local risk minimization is carried out with respect to a martingale measure ,",
    "a number of interesting features arise .",
    "for example , the option prices that result from the scheme are guaranteed to be arbitrage free and the hedging strategies in this case minimize , not only the local but also the global hedging risk .",
    "additionally , there is a decoupling between the expressions that determine hedges and prices that can be taken advantage of in order to create numerically performing schemes to compute them .",
    "an intuitive explanation behind risk neutral optimization and references to other research studies which undertake this approach are presented in cont _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite . to our knowledge ,",
    "the only attempts at exploring local risk minimization in a garch setting are due to ortega  @xcite and huang and guo  @xcite .",
    "the former investigates the use of the local risk minimization with respect to a martingale measure in the context of gaussian driven garch processes and shows how duan  @xcite and heston and nandi s  @xcite pricing formulas can be recovered in this fashion , while the latter investigates the risk adjusted expected quadratic cost of hedging minimal hedging strategies in the sense of elliott and madan  @xcite .",
    "when the time between two consecutive observations approaches zero , we show that the local risk minimization hedge ratio under a martingale measure can be approximated with a stochastic volatility type delta hedge .",
    "more specifically , the resulting delta consists of the sum of the option delta ( the first partial derivative of the option price with respect to the spot price ) and the option vega ( the first partial derivative of the option price with respect to the conditional variance process ) scaled by a so called vega multiplier",
    ". the name of this term is borrowed from engle and rosenberg  @xcite .",
    "however , this approximation is different to the one proposed in that paper since all our greeks and vega multipliers are computed directly based on a garch model instead of on an adjusted black - scholes price in the sense of hull and white  @xcite . using the extended girsanov principle of elliott and madan",
    "@xcite we derive simplified expressions for these quantities under the general non - gaussian setup , although the explicit computation of greeks involves monte carlo simulation .",
    "this result generalizes the static delta hedge proposed by duan  @xcite .",
    "in fact , the latter appears as a particular case of the one that we propose if changes in asset prices and conditional variances are uncorrelated .",
    "finally we derive the local risk minimizing hedges under the non - garch diffusion limits of our model and show their relationships with our proposed discrete - time counterparts .",
    "this result also serves as a further justification of why duan s",
    "@xcite hedge is the correct instantaneous delta hedge only under the aforementioned assumption .",
    "we provide an extensive numerical example in which we test the out - of - sample empirical performance of the proposed delta hedges for a special case of garch model driven by normal inverse gaussian distributed innovations in hedging a collection of european call options on the s&p 500 index .",
    "the garch model parameters are estimated via maximum likelihood based on the historical returns on the underlying s&p 500 index .",

    "a number of techniques have been developed over the years that tackle simultaneously the pricing and hedging problems by replacing the concept of replication with that of hedging efficiency .",

    "the minimal martingale measure is usually a signed measure in discrete time settings , so derivative valuation based on this approach might not be suitable .",

    "the variance of the resulting estimator is too high and makes the results unacceptable .",
    "moreover , the option prices that result from this technique can not be interpreted as arbitrage free prices if the hedging frequency is lower than periods at which asset prices are observed .",
