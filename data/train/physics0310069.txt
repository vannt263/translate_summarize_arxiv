    "the problem of fundamental units has many facets , three of which seem to be most important : theoretical , experimental and technological . at present",
    "they are inseparable .",
    "theory , the so called standard model , formulates basic physical laws and mathematical methods of their application .",
    "theoretical laws were established and continue to be established and tested on the basis of ingenious experiments and astronomical observations of higher and higher accuracy for an expanding space of parameters .",
    "precision experiments and observations , in their turn , are unthinkable without modern high technologies , including lasers and computers .",
    "these technologies are indissolubly connected with metrology  creation , perfection and unification of standards of physical units , while metrology is widely using the results of such theories as quantum mechanics , relativity theory , electrodynamics , condensed matter theory etc .",
    "thus the circle is closed .",
    "the situation is additionally complicated by the fact that the standard model is not a complete theory .",
    "it has many unsolved problems .",
    "perhaps the most burning is the problem of existence of fundamental scalar particles ( higgses ) , responsible for the masses of all fundamental particles ( from the heaviest one  @xmath3-quark to the lightest of the three neutrinos ) .",
    "we still do not understand the role of the three families of leptons and quarks",
    ". it would be too naive to think that their only justification is cp - violation .",
    "we still lack a successful theory unifying electroweak and strong interactions . the hypothesis of existence of moderately violated supersymmetry ",
    "symmetry between fundamental bosons and fermions is still not confirmed by experiments .",
    "mathematical constructs of the type of superstrings and m - theory which in the beginning were considered as attempts to unify quantum gravity with electroweak and strong interaction , as time goes by , withdraw into a separate field of mathematics , whose practioneers do not promise any applications to the real physical world .",
    "the situation might become drastically different if manifestations of extra space dimensions are discovered ; in particular if laws of gravity turned out to change at tev scale .",
    "sections 2 - 6 are devoted to the history of units based on @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 .",
    "sections 7 - 9 deal with the units based on @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath4 and precision frequency measurements .",
    "section 10 compares the gaussian units and si units .",
    "it is argued that while the latter are more convenient for practical purposes , the former allow to better understand the basic notions of modern physics . therefore the use of both systems of units should be allowed in physics textbooks .",
    "section 11 contains concluding remarks .",
    "the essence of theoretical physics is expressed by dimensionless equations for dimensionless quantities .",
    "however one can not do experimental physics ( and to teach physics ) without dimensional quantities and dimensional units .    in what follows",
    "we shall refer to dimensionless fundamental constants such as @xmath5 , or @xmath6 as fundamental parameters ( here @xmath4 is the electron charge , @xmath7 is the reduced quantum of action ( @xmath8 ) and of angular momentum , @xmath0  velocity of light in vacuum , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are masses of electron and proton respectively ) .    in the absence of established terminology",
    "we shall refer to dimensional fundamental constants as fundamental units .",
    "examples of units : @xmath0 ( for velocity ) , @xmath7 ( for action and angular momentum ) . according to our definition @xmath2 is also a fundamental unit ( though indirectly ) .",
    "when in 1899 - 1900 planck discovered @xmath1 @xcite , he used this discovery to introduce universal units , which at present are written in the form @xmath11 where @xmath2 is newton s gravitational constant .",
    "planck derived his units by using dimensional order of magnitude relations : @xmath12    he was inspired by the idea that his units are universal ( contrary to `` handcrafted '' earthbound ordinary units ",
    "meter , second , gram ) : they are the same at any far away corner of the universe .",
    "planck also considered as universal the planck temperature @xmath13 .",
    "but boltzman s @xmath14 is not a universal unit , it is a conversion factor : @xmath15 ev / k ( hint : @xmath16 ) .",
    "from the point of view of the future `` theory of everything '' it is natural to use @xmath18 as fundamental dimensional constants .    in 1928",
    "gamov , ivanenko and landau @xcite considered the theory `` of the world as whole '' in terms of dimensional fundamental constant @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 . in 1928 landau was 20 years old , gamow and ivanenko  24 ( see figs .",
    "they had written the paper `` world constants and limiting transitions '' ( see fig .",
    "3 ) as a humorous birthday present to their friend , a young lady . none of them ever referred this paper in their subsequent publications .",
    "but the ideas of the paper were fundamental . in 1936",
    "bronstein @xcite worked at a theory in which all three constants are finite .",
    "it was one of the first papers on relativistic quantum gravity . in 1967 ideas of refs .",
    "@xcite were presented in the form of a cube ( see figs .",
    "4,5 ) by zelmanov @xcite .",
    "later on it was further developed by others @xcite .",
    "the vertices of this cube represent nonrelativistic mechanics ( nm ) , nonrelativistic gravity ( ng ) , nonrelativistic quantum mechanics ( qm ) , special relativity ( sr ) , quantum field theory ( qft ) , general relativity ( gr ) and finally relativistic quantum gravity ( qgr ) or theory of everything ( toe ) .    the cube , made of units , is `` endowed '' with dimensionless parameters like @xmath19 , mixing angles , mass ratios , etc .",
    "their values are expected to follow from toe .",
    "similar to the cube is `` dimensional pyramid '' ( kuchar @xcite , sanchez @xcite ) with 4 vertices and 4 planes , fig .",
    "4 .    note that einstein tried to build a unified theory of electricity and gravity ( `` toe '' ) in the left - hand vertical plane of the cube , without quantum mechanics , without @xmath7 .",
    "planck units allow one to deal in the equations of toe only with dimensionless functions of dimensionless variables and dimensionless parameters of the type @xmath20 or @xmath6 . conceptually planck units are excellent , but practically they have serious shortcomings , caused by @xmath2 , the same @xmath2 which allows to bring gravitation and cosmology into the realm of quantum phenomena .",
    "thus the source of strength at the same time turns out to be a source of weakness .",
    "the obvious shortcoming of planck units is that they differ by many orders of magnitude from atomic units commonly used in physics .",
    "their values are natural for the early universe and toe , but not for mundane physics : @xmath21    the energy which corresponds to the planck mass is unattainable by accelerators even of the remotest future .",
    "( note , however , that it is only a few orders of magnitude larger than the grand unification scale of electroweak and strong interactions . ) the planck units of length and time are vanishingly small compared with atomic units .",
    "of course the huge powers of ten are not frightful by themselves .",
    "as is well known , atomic units also differ by many orders of magnitude from si units , which does not prevent atomic standards to be the base of modern metrology .    much more essential",
    "is another shortcoming of planck units , which stems from the fact that @xmath2 is known with rather poor accuracy ( of order of @xmath22 , by five  four orders worse than those of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , and by 12 orders worse than the precision of atomic clocks ) .",
    "thus it is impossible to use the planck units as standards in modern precision physics and technology .",
    "the use by planck of @xmath2 as a basis for defining the unit of mass was caused by absence at the beginning of the 20th century of another natural , not `` handcrafted '' , candidate for the unit of mass . in that respect",
    "planck s universal units resemble the universal units suggested 30 years earlier by irish physicist stoney ( 1826 - 1910 ) , secretary of irish royal society ( see figs .",
    "by studying electrolysis , he was the first who measured the value of elementary charge @xmath4 and introduced into physics the term `` electron '' for the carrier of this charge ( in modern terminology it is ion ) . from @xmath23   stoney @xcite constructed in 1870 - 1880 universal units with dimensions of length , time and mass : @xmath24 which he derived from dimensional equations : @xmath25    let us note that units of stoney are only by a factor @xmath26 smaller than those of planck .",
    "stoney s units look `` tailored '' for einstein s unified theory .",
    "constants @xmath4 , @xmath0 , @xmath2 contain the gist of classical electrodynamics and gravity .",
    "there is no @xmath7 in them .",
    "comparison with @xmath0 , @xmath7 , @xmath2 shows that @xmath7 is brought into stoney s set of constants `` through the back door of @xmath27 '' .",
    "therefore @xmath4 , @xmath0 , @xmath2 do not form a cube of theories with its limiting transitions considered by gamov , ivanenko and landau @xcite .",
    "during the 20th century the situation with standard of mass ( time , length ) has changed drastically .",
    "the fundamental identity of elementary particles and hence of atoms produced many candidates for standard of mass , known with much , much better precision than @xmath2 .",
    "thus , from the point of view of dimensions the necessity to use @xmath2 disappeared .",
    "however from the point of view of unifying physics the planck units became even more attractive .",
    "let us now look at two other fundamental constants : @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "let us start from @xmath0 and the frequencies of light and radio waves .",
    "in the second half of the 20th century physicists learned how to measure them in a digital way by counting the number of crests .",
    "this raised the accuracy of atomic ( cesium-133 ) clocks ( first suggested by i.  rabi in 1945 ) to the level of 1 second in 300 years ( nbs , 1955 ) .",
    "( now this has become 1 second in @xmath29 years : lptf , nist , ptb . ) but even the first figure was sufficient for the introduction into si of an atomic unit of a second ( in 1967 ) :    `` 1 s @xmath30 periods of radiation in transition between levels of hyperfine splitting of the atomic ground state of cs-133 '' .",
    "this , together with the independence of the velocity of light on its frequency , impelled bay et al .",
    "@xcite to suggest , instead of unit of length ( meter ) , to use as the basic unit the unit of velocity , namely the velocity of light @xmath0 . in 1983",
    "the definition @xmath31 was introduced in si .",
    "the traditional standard of length gave way to the new standard based on the value of the velocity @xmath0 .",
    "this velocity is defined as a number without uncertainty .",
    "further improvements of experiments which measured @xmath0 would mean further improvement of the realization of the meter . an international report `` practical realization of the definition of the metre , including recommended radiations of other optical frequency standards '' ( 2001 ) was published by t.  quinn in 2003 @xcite .",
    "( note that both spellings `` metre '' and `` meter '' are used in the literature , the former in metrology , while the latter one in physics . )",
    "further progress in accuracy of atomic clocks is connected with passing from microwave to optical frequencies @xcite .",
    "thus metrology made two momentous steps in the direction of fundamental physics : the place of macroscopic clocks and ruler ( the famous rod at bimp , in sevre , near paris ) became occupied by the velocity of light and by atoms of cs-133 .",
    "there remains now only one macroscopic standard ",
    "the kilogram at sevre .",
    "the prospect of expressing it through the quantum of action @xmath1 is connected with precision measurements in atomic and condensed matter physics .",
    "there are many promising quantities which are good candidates for such measurements .",
    "i shall touch upon only one project which is connected with two outstanding discoveries in condensed matter physics : the josephson effect @xcite ( nobel prize 1973 ) and the von klitzing effect @xcite ( nobel prize 1985 ) .",
    "josephson theoretically predicted the existence of a supercurrent and its remarkable properties .",
    "a supercurrent is a current of cooper pairs tunneling through an insulator separating two superconductors .",
    "a supercurrent can exist without external voltage .",
    "an external voltage @xmath33 creates an alternating supercurrent of frequency @xmath34 .",
    "the steps in @xmath33 are given by the relation : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is an integer , while the coefficient @xmath37 is universal and is called the josephson constant .",
    "it is reproduced in various experiments with unprecedented accuracy and is determined only by the ratio of fundamental constants : @xmath38    the effect , discovered by von klitzing , is called the quantum hall effect .",
    "this effect shows that there exists in nature a universal electric resistance , one which can be expressed in terms of fundamental constants .",
    "as is well known , the ordinary hall effect occurs in a solid conductor ( or semiconductor ) with density of current * j * in a magnetic field * h * which produce an electric field * e * ( with voltage @xmath39 ) orthogonal both to * j * and * h*.    the quantum hall effect was discovered in a two - dimensional electron system separating two parts of a silicon field transistor at very low temperature ( @xmath40 k ) and very strong magnetic field ( @xmath41 tesla ) .",
    "it was established that the hall resistance @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the total current , has quantum jumps : @xmath44 where @xmath36 is an integer , while @xmath45 is the von klitzing constant : @xmath46    it is obvious that @xmath47 this permits measurement of @xmath1 using macroscopic apparatus . a special two - story - high watt balance compared electrical and mechanical forces : @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the measured mass of a body , @xmath50  local gravitational acceleration , @xmath33  the voltage in a coil moving with a vertical velocity @xmath51 in a magnetic field , while @xmath43 is the current in the same coil , this time fixed in the same magnetic field .",
    "by calibrating @xmath33 and @xmath52 through the josephson and von klitzing effects williams et al .",
    "@xcite succeeded in connecting @xmath1 and the kilogram within uncertainty @xmath53 .",
    "it is hoped that in the not too distant future this accuracy might be improved by an order of magnitude , which would allow to use the watt balance for gauging the standards of mass and thus get rid of the sevres kilogram and to define the value of @xmath1 . as a result",
    "the value of @xmath1 would have no uncertainties in the same way as it occurred with @xmath0 .",
    "thus fundamental units of nature @xmath0 and @xmath1 would become fundamental si units of metrology .",
    "another definition of the kilogram has been suggested @xcite on the basis of equations @xmath55 @xmath56 `` the kilogram is the mass of a body at rest whose equivalent energy equals the energy of collection of photons whose frequencies sum to @xmath57 hertz '' .",
    "this definition should be taken with a grain of salt .",
    "the combined use of equations ( [ 0412 ] ) and ( [ 0413 ] ) implies that a photon of frequency @xmath34 has mass @xmath58 .",
    "this implication persists in spite of the words `` equivalent energy '' .",
    "the words `` the mass of the body at rest '' imply that mass is not lorentz invariant , but depends on the velocity of a reference frame",
    ". it would be proper to replace equation ( [ 0413 ] ) by @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the rest energy ( see e.g. ref .",
    "but then it would take some additional considerations in order to define the frequency @xmath61 corresponding to one kilogram . in particular massive atoms emitting and absorbing photons should be taken into account . from practical point of view the measurement of `` frequencies sum '' of order",
    "@xmath62 hertz is by eight orders of magnitude more difficult than that of the planck frequency @xmath63 .",
    "electromagnetism  the kinship of electricity and magnetism , discovered in 1820 by oersted , rather soon became the foundation of ampre s electrodynamics .",
    "the development of the latter by faraday and other outstanding physicists culminated in 1873 in the treatise of maxwell @xcite who linked electric currents with electric and magnetic fields and with the properties of light .",
    "none of these great physicists knew the genuine nature of the phenomena .",
    "maxwell considered vacuum filled with ether ; the carriers of charges were unknown to him .",
    "the electromagnetic field was described by four vector quantities : electric field * e * , electric induction ( or displacement ) * d * , magnetic field * h * , and magnetic induction ( or flux density ) * b*.    on the basis of these notions practical units ( such as volt , ampere , coulomb , joule ) were introduced by international electrical congresses in 1880s .",
    "the electric permitivity @xmath64 and magnetic permeability @xmath65 ascribed by maxwell to the ether were accepted by the community of engineers and physicists : @xmath66 , @xmath67 . in the middle of the 20th century",
    "these practical units became the basis of the systm international dunits ( si ) .",
    "the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th century were marked by great successes in understanding and applying classical electrodynamics .",
    "on practical side it was the use of electric currents in industry , transport and radio communications .",
    "on theoretical side it was unification of electrodynamics , optics and mechanics in the framework of special relativity @xcite .    according to special relativity , the 4-radius vector is @xmath68 ( @xmath69 ) , the 4-momentum vector is @xmath70 , the 4-potential of electromagnetic field @xmath71 , the density of the 4-current @xmath72 , where @xmath73 , and @xmath74 , @xmath4 is electric charge .",
    "( the current @xmath75 is consistent with the definitions of @xmath76 and @xmath77 , due to an appropriate coefficient @xmath0 in front of @xmath78 .",
    "the source of the field , the charge , is pointlike .",
    "otherwise there appears a problem of the field inside the finite - size cloud of charge . )",
    "the upper index @xmath79 of a 4-vector indicates a contravariant 4-vector ; a lower index @xmath79 indicates covariant 4-vector , its space components have minus sign . raising or lowering of indices",
    "is done with the diagonal metric tensors @xmath80 or @xmath81 respectively .",
    "the 3-vectors * e * and * h * are components of the 4-tensor of electromagnetic field @xmath82    the tensors @xmath83 and @xmath84 can be represented by matrices : @xmath85 and @xmath86 respectively , or in a condensed form : @xmath87 @xmath88    this 4-tensor is obviously antisymmetric . from the definition of @xmath83 it follows that dimensions of * e * and * h * are the same : @xmath89 = [ { \\rm\\bf h}]$ ] .",
    "the field equations have the form in gaussian units : @xmath90 @xmath91 here @xmath92 where @xmath93 is fully antisymmetric tensor ( @xmath94 ) .",
    "the equation describing the motion of charge in the electromagnetic field is given by @xmath95 \\;\\ ; , \\label{0423}\\ ] ] where @xmath96    note that according to special relativity there is no ether , @xmath97 , and the strength of magnetic field in vacuum @xmath98 has the same dimension as that of @xmath99 , the identity of @xmath100 immediately follows from the fact that the same @xmath4 determines the action of the charge on the field and of the field on the charge .",
    "( see expression for the action in ref .",
    "@xcite , eq .",
    "( 27.6 ) . )",
    "thus , there is no need to consider @xmath101 and @xmath102 in the case of vacuum . in classical electrodynamics",
    "they appear only in the continuous media due to polarization of the latter @xcite .    in a number of classical monographs and textbooks on classical electrodynamics @xmath99 and @xmath98 are consistently used for description of electric and magnetic fields in vacuum with @xmath97 ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "their authors use gaussian or heaviside - lorentz ( with @xmath103 in coulomb law ) units .    many other authors use * b * instead of * h * , sometimes calling * b * magnetic field and sometimes  magnetic induction in vacuum @xcite .",
    "most of them use the si units , according to which @xmath64 and @xmath65 are dimensional : @xmath104ha@xmath105 , @xmath106 , where h is henry , while a  ampere .",
    "the classical electromagnetic fields in vacuum are described by four physical quantities @xmath102 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 , @xmath101 , all four of them having different dimensions at variance with the spirit of special relativity .",
    "is similar to putting @xmath107 , when using @xmath0 as a unit of velocity .",
    "however this similarity is superficial . in the framework of special relativity",
    "one can use any unit for velocity ( for instance , m / s ) . but the dimensions and values of @xmath64 and @xmath65 are fixed in si . ] in that respect vacuum is similar to a material body .",
    "the si units are very convenient for engineers , but not for theorists in particle physics .",
    "in fact , theorists are not less responsible than metrologists for the gap between deductive basis of modern physics and mainly prerelativistic inductive basis of modern metrology .",
    "a good example is the 1935 article @xcite by a.  sommerfeld and his book `` electrodynamics '' based on lectures given in 1933 - 34 @xcite .",
    "his argument against absolute system ( that is based on units of time , length and mass ) was the presence in it of fractional exponents ( for instance from coulomb law the dimension of charge is @xmath108 @xmath109 ) .",
    "this argument was not very compelling in the 1930s and is even less so today .",
    "his argument against gaussian or heaviside - lorentz system was based on inductive , prerelativistic view on electromagnetism . though he was not quite happy , but @xmath110 '' .",
    "* 36 * ( 1935 ) 818 . ] with the new clumsy expression for fine structure constant @xmath27 introduced by him before the world war i , he kept insisting on mksa units and against gaussian units .",
    "his authority was not the least in the decision to legally enforce after world war ii the si as the obligatory system of units for all textbooks in physics .",
    "coming back to classical electrodynamics let us note that it is not a perfect theory : it has serious problems at short distances .",
    "to a large part these problems are solved by quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) .",
    "therefore the latter should be used as a foundation of a system of electromagnetic units . by the way",

    "is not a constant but a function of momentum transfer due to polarization of vacuum .",
    "let us stress that this polarization has nothing to do with purely classical non - unit values of @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "mutually fruitful `` crossing '' of fundamental physics and metrology gives numerous practical applications .",
    "one of them should be specially mentioned : the use of general relativity in global positoning system @xcite .",
    "remarkable achievements of metrology are not always accompanied by elaboration of adequate terminology . here",
    "we will mention only a few of widely spread delusions .",
    "the choice of @xmath0 as a unit of velocity leads many authors to the false conclusion that @xmath0 should be excluded from the set of fundamental units .",
    "they insist that @xmath107 , because @xmath0 in units of @xmath0 is equal 1 .",
    "( the same refers to @xmath1 in units of @xmath1 . ) but number 1 is not a unit of measurement , because such units are always dimensional .",
    "equations @xmath111 are simply wide spread jargon .",
    "some authors go even further by identifying space and time .",
    "( a detailed discussion can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite . )",
    "the number of physical units is not limited . when solving a given problem the choice of units",
    "is determined by considerations of convenience .",
    "however from the point of view of `` the world as a whole '' @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 ( or instead of @xmath2 some other quantity representing gravity ) are definitely singled out as fundamental dimensional constants .",
    "of course they must be accompanied by a number of dimensionless parameters .",
    "but the number of fundamental units could not be less than three @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of candela into the set of base units ( see fig .  9 ) seems to be unconvincing from the point of view of physics .",
    "of course , practically it is convenient to use it when discussing the brightness of light .",
    "but it does not look logical to put it on the same footing as units of length , time and mass .    as si is imposed on the physics literature by governmental laws , the obligatory usage in textbooks of such notions as permitivity @xmath64 and permeability @xmath65 of vacuum ,",
    "makes it difficult to appreciate the beauty of the modern electrodynamics and field theory .",

    "<S> the problem of fundamental units is discussed in the context of achievements of both theoretical physics and modern metrology . on one hand , due to fascinating accuracy of atomic clocks , the traditional macroscopic standards of metrology ( second , metre , kilogram ) </S>",
    "<S> are giving way to standards based on fundamental units of nature : velocity of light @xmath0 and quantum of action @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , the poor precision of gravitational constant @xmath2 , which is widely believed to define the `` cube of theories '' and the units of the future `` theory of everything '' , does not allow to use @xmath2 as a fundamental dimensional constant in metrology . </S>",
    "<S> the electromagnetic units in si are actually based on concepts of prerelativistic classical electrodynamics such as ether , electric permitivity and magnetic permeability of vacuum . </S>",
    "<S> concluding remarks are devoted to terminological confusion which accompanies the progress in basic physics and metrology .    [ 04 ] </S>"
