    "it is an old idea to define generalized space - times by association with jordan algebras @xmath4 , in such a way that the space - time is coordinatized by the elements of @xmath4 , and that its rotation , lorentz , and conformal group can be identified with the automorphism , reduced structure , and the linear fractional group of @xmath4 , respectively  @xcite .",
    "the aesthetic appeal of this idea rests to a large extent on the fact that key ingredients for formulating relativistic quantum field theories over four dimensional minkowski space extend naturally to these generalized space times ; in particular , the well - known connection between the positive energy unitary representations of the four dimensional conformal group @xmath5 and the covariant fields transforming in finite dimensional representations of the lorentz group @xmath6  @xcite extends to all generalized space - times defined by jordan algebras  @xcite .",
    "the appearance of exceptional lie groups and algebras in extended supergravities and their relevance to understanding the non - perturbative regime of string theory have provided new impetus ; indeed , possible applications to string and constitute the main motivation for the present investigation .    in this paper",
    ", we will present a novel construction involving the maximally extended lie group @xmath0 .",
    "this construction of @xmath0 together with the corresponding construction of @xmath7 contain all previous examples of generalized space - times based on exceptional lie groups , and at the same time goes beyond the framework of jordan algebras .",
    "more precisely , we show that there exists a quasiconformal nonlinear realization of @xmath0 on a space of 57 dimensions ) ; it will be called `` conformal '' if it is based on a three graded decomposition ( as e.g. for @xmath8 ) . ] .",
    "this space may be viewed as the quotient of @xmath0 by its maximal parabolic subgroup  @xcite ; there is no jordan algebra directly associated with it , but it can be related to a certain freudenthal triple system which itself is associated with the `` split '' exceptional jordan algebra @xmath9 where @xmath10 denote the split real form of the octonions @xmath11 .",
    "it furthermore admits an @xmath12 invariant norm form @xmath13 , which gets multiplied by a ( coordinate dependent ) factor under the nonlinearly realized `` special conformal '' transformations .",
    "therefore the light cone , defined by the condition @xmath14 , is actually invariant under the full @xmath0 , which thus plays the role of a generalized conformal group . by truncation",
    "we obtain quasiconformal realizations of other exceptional lie groups .",
    "furthermore , we recover previous conformal realizations of the lower rank exceptional groups ( some of which correspond to jordan algebras ) . in particular , we give a completely explicit conformal mbius - like nonlinear realization of @xmath12 on the 27-dimensional space associated with the exceptional jordan algebra @xmath9 , with linearly realized subgroups @xmath15 ( the `` rotation group '' ) and @xmath16 ( the `` lorentz group '' ) .",
    "although in part this result is implicitly contained in the existing literature on jordan algebras , the relevant transformations have not been exhibited explicitly so far , and are here presented in the basis that is also used in maximal supergravity theories .",
    "the basic concepts are best illustrated in terms of a simple and familiar example , namely the conformal group in four dimensions  @xcite , and its realization via the jordan algebra @xmath17 of hermitean @xmath18 matrices with the hermiticity preserving commutative ( but non - associative ) product @xmath19 ( basic properties of jordan algebras are summarized in appendix a ) .",
    "as is well known , these matrices are in one - to - one correspondence with four - vectors @xmath20 in minkowski space via the formula @xmath21 where @xmath22 .",
    "the `` norm form '' on this algebra is just the ordinary determinant , i.e. @xmath23 ( it will be a higher order polynomial in the general case ) . defining @xmath24 ( where @xmath25 ) we introduce the jordan triple product on @xmath17 : @xmath26 with the standard lorentz invariant bilinear form @xmath27 .",
    "however , it is not generally true that the jordan triple product can be thus expressed in terms of a bilinear form .",
    "the automorphism group of @xmath17 , which is by definition compatible with the jordan product , is just the rotation group @xmath28 ; the structure group , defined as the invariance of the norm form up to a constant factor , is the product @xmath29 , i.e. the lorentz group and dilatations .",
    "the conformal group associated with @xmath17 is the group leaving invariant the light - cone @xmath30 . as is well known , the associated lie algebra is @xmath31 , and possesses a three - graded structure @xmath32 where the grade @xmath33 and grade @xmath34 spaces correspond to generators of translations @xmath35 and special conformal transformations @xmath36 , respectively , while the grade 0 subspace is spanned by the lorentz generators @xmath37 and the dilatation generator @xmath38 .",
    "the subspaces @xmath39 and @xmath40 can each be associated with the jordan algebra @xmath17 , such that their elements are labeled by elements @xmath41 of @xmath17 .",
    "the precise correspondence is @xmath42 by contrast , the generators in @xmath43 are labeled by _",
    "two _ elements @xmath44 , viz . @xmath45",
    "the conformal group is realized non - linearly on the space of four - vectors @xmath46 , with a mbius - like infinitesimal action of the special conformal transformations @xmath47 with parameter @xmath48 .",
    "all variations acquire a very simple form when expressed in terms of above generators : we have @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the jordan triple product introduced above . from these transformations",
    "it is elementary to deduce the commutation relations @xmath51    & = & s_{a b } \\",
    ", , { \\nonumber \\\\ } { } [ s_{a b},u_c ] & = & u_{\\{abc\\ } } \\ , , { \\nonumber \\\\ } { } [ s_{a b } , \\tilde u_c ]     & = & \\tilde u_{\\{bac\\ } } \\ , , { \\nonumber \\\\ } { } [ s_{a b},s_{c d } ] & = & s_{{\\{abc\\}}\\ , d } - s_{{\\{bad\\ } } \\ , c } \\,.\\ ] ] ( of course , these could have been derived directly from those of the conformal group ) . as one",
    "can also see , the lie algebra @xmath52 admits an involutive automorphism @xmath53 exchanging @xmath40 and @xmath54 ( hence , @xmath55 ) .",
    "the above transformation rules and commutation relations exemplify the structure that we will encounter again in section 3 of this paper : the conformal realization of @xmath2 on @xmath3 presented there has the same form , except that @xmath17 is replaced by the exceptional jordan algebra @xmath9 over the split octonions @xmath56 .",
    "while our form of the nonlinear variations appears to be new , the concomitant construction of the lie algebra itself by means of the jordan triple product has been known in the literature as the tits - kantor - koecher construction  @xcite , and as such generalizes to other jordan algebras .",
    "the generalized linear fractional ( mbius ) groups of jordan algebras can be abstractly defined in an analogous manner  @xcite , and shown to leave invariant certain generalized @xmath57-angles defined by the norm form of degree @xmath57 of the underlying jordan algebra  @xcite . however , to our knowledge , explicit formulas of the type derived here have not appeared in the literature before .",
    "while this construction works for the exceptional lie algebras @xmath58 , and @xmath8 , as well as other lie algebras admitting a three graded structure , it fails for @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 , for which a three grading does not exist .",
    "these algebras possess only a five graded structure @xmath62 our main result , to be described in section 2 , states that a `` quasiconformal '' realization is still possible on a space of dimension @xmath63 if the top grade spaces @xmath64 are one - dimensional .",
    "five graded lie algebras with this property are closely related to the so - called freudenthal triple systems  @xcite , which were originally invented to provide alternative constructions of the exceptional lie groups have more than one dimension , will not be discussed in this paper . ] .",
    "this relation will be made very explicit in the present paper .",
    "the novel realization of @xmath65 which we will arrive at , together with its natural extension to @xmath7 , contains various other constructions of exceptional lie algebras by truncation , including the conformal realizations based on a three graded structure . for this reason ,",
    "we describe it first in section [ e8-realization ] , and then show how the other cases can be obtained from it .    whereas previous attempts to construct generalized space - times mainly focused on generalizing minkowski space - time and its symmetries , the physical applications that we have in mind here are of a somewhat different nature , and inspired by recent developments in superstring and .",
    "namely , the generalized `` space - times '' presented here could conceivably be identified with certain internal spaces arising in supergravity and superstring theory , which are related to the appearance of central charges in the associated superalgebras .",
    "central charges and their solitonic carriers have been much discussed in the recent literature because it is hoped that they may provide a window on and its non - perturbative degrees of freedom .",
    "more specifically , it has been argued in @xcite that a proper description of the non - perturbative degrees of freedom might require supplementing ordinary space - time coordinates by central charge coordinates .",
    "solitonic charges also play an important role in the microscopic description of black hole entropy : for maximally extended @xmath66 supergravity , the latter is conjectured to be given by an @xmath12 invariant formula  @xcite .",
    "the corresponding formula for the entropy in maximally extended supergravity in five dimensions is @xmath16 invariant and involves a cubic form . in  @xcite an invariant classification of orbits of @xmath12 and @xmath16 actions on their fundamental representations that classify bps states in @xmath67 and",
    "@xmath68 was given .",
    "the entropy formula in @xcite is identical to the equation for a vector with vanishing norm in 57 dimensions ( see eq .",
    "( [ e8lc ] ) ) , provided we use the @xmath69form of the quartic @xmath12 invariant .",
    "this suggests that the 57th component of our @xmath59 realization should be interpreted as the entropy .",
    "however , we should stress that the quartic invariant can assume both positive and negative values , cf .",
    "the simple examples given in appendix b. in order to avoid imaginary entropy , one must therefore restrict oneself to the positive semi - definite values of the quartic invariant , corresponding to the `` time - like '' and `` light - like '' orbits of @xmath12 in the language of @xcite . with the 57th",
    "coordinate interpreted as the entropy and the remaining 56 coordinates as the electric and magnetic charges , it is natural from our point of view to define a distance in this `` entropy - charge space '' between any two black hole solutions using our eqs .",
    "( [ difference]),([n4 ] ) .",
    "if two black hole solutions are light - like separated in this space , they will remain so under the action of @xmath59 .",
    "maxwell - einstein supergravity @xcite defined by the exceptional jordan algebra the u - duality groups in five and four dimensions are @xmath70 and @xmath71 , respectively .",
    "the quasi - conformal symmetry of the exceptional supergravity in four dimensions is hence @xmath7 , with the maximal compact subgroup @xmath72 . ] .",
    "we should also point out that it is not entirely clear from the existing black hole literature whether it is the @xmath73or the @xmath69form of the invariant that should be used here ( the detailed relation between the two is worked out in appendix b ) .",
    "the @xmath73basis is relevant for the central charges , which appear in the superalgebra via surface integrals at spatial infinity and determine the structure ( and length ) of bps multiplets .",
    "by contrast , the 28 electric and 28 magnetic charges carried by the solitons of @xmath74 supergravity transform separately under @xmath69@xcite , and therefore the @xmath69form of the invariant appears more appropriate in this context .    for applications to it would be important to obtain the exponentiated version of our realization .",
    "one might reasonably expect that modular forms with respect to a fractional linear realization of the arithmetic group @xmath75 will have a role to play .",
    "we expect that our results will pave the way for the explicit construction of such modular forms .",
    "according to  @xcite these would depend on @xmath76 variables , such that the 57-dimensional heisenberg subalgebra of @xmath59 exhibited here would be realized in terms of 28 `` coordinates '' and 28 `` momenta '' .",
    "consequently , the 57 dimensions in which @xmath65 acts might alternatively be interpreted as a generalized heisenberg group , in which case the 57th component would play the role of a variable parameter  @xmath77 .",
    "the action of @xmath75 on the 57 dimensional heisenberg group would then constitute the invariance group of a generalized dirac quantization condition .",
    "this observation is also in accord with the fact that the term modifying the vector space addition in @xmath1 ( cf . eq.([difference ] ) ) , which is required by @xmath59 invariance , is just the cocycle induced by the standard canonical commutation relations on an ( 28 + 28)-dimensional phase space .",
    "[ e8-realization ]      we will start with the maximal case , the exceptional lie group @xmath59 , and its quasiconformal realization on @xmath1 , because this realization contains all others by truncation .",
