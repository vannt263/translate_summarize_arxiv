    "biological evolution presents a rich array of phenomena that involve nonlinear interactions between large numbers of units . as a consequence ,",
    "problems in evolutionary biology have recently enjoyed increasing popularity among statistical and computational physicists.@xcite however , many of the models used by physicists have unrealistic features that prevent the results from attracting significant attention from biologists . in this paper",
    "we therefore develop and explore individual - based models of coevolution in predator - prey systems based on more realistic population dynamics than some earlier models.@xcite",
    "recently the author , together with r.  k.  p.  zia , introduced a simplified form of the tangled - nature model of biological macroevolution , which was developed by jensen and collaborators.@xcite in these simplified models,@xcite the reproduction rates in an individual - based population dynamics with nonoverlapping generations provide the mechanism for selection between several interacting species .",
    "new species are introduced into the community through point mutations in a haploid , binary  genome \" of length @xmath1 , as in eigen s model for molecular evolution.@xcite the potential species are identified by the index @xmath2 $ ] .",
    "( typically , only @xmath3 of these species are present in the community at any one time @xmath4 . ) at the end of each generation , each individual of species @xmath5 gives birth to a fixed number @xmath6 of offspring with probability @xmath7 before dying , or dies without offspring with probability @xmath8 .",
    "each offspring may mutate into a different species  generally with different properties  with a small probability @xmath9 .",
    "mutation consists in flipping a randomly chosen bit in the genome .      in these models ,",
    "the reproduction probability for an individual of species @xmath5 is given by the nonlinear function @xmath10 } \\ ; , \\label{eq : pi}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is an external resource that is renewed at the same level each generation , and @xmath12 is the set of population sizes of all the species resident in the community in generation @xmath4 .",
    "the function @xmath13 is given by @xmath14 here @xmath15 is an  energy cost \" of reproduction ( always positive ) , and @xmath16 ( positive for primary producers or autotrophs , and zero for consumers or heterotrophs ) is the ability of individuals of species @xmath5 to utilize the external resource @xmath11 , while @xmath17 is an environmental carrying capacity@xcite ( a.k.a .",
    "verhulst factor@xcite ) .",
    "the total population size is @xmath18 .",
    "the main feature of this reproduction probability is the random _ interaction matrix _",
    "@xmath19,@xcite which is constructed at the beginning of a simulation run , and thereafter kept constant ( quenched randomness ) .",
    "if @xmath20 is positive and @xmath21 negative , @xmath5 is a predator and @xmath22 its prey , and vice versa . if both matrix elements are positive , the relationship is a mutualistic one , while both negative indicate an antagonistic relationship .",
    "two versions of this model were studied in earlier work . in the first version ,",
    "which we have called model a , there is no external resource or birth cost , and the off - diagonal elements of @xmath19 are stochastically independent and uniformly distributed over @xmath23 $ ] , while the diagonal elements are zero .",
    "this model evolves toward mutualistic communities , in which all species are connected by mutually positive interactions.@xcite    of greater biological interest is a predator - prey version of the model , called model b. in this case a small minority of the potential species ( typically 5% ) are primary producers , while the rest are consumers .",
    "the off - diagonal part of the interaction matrix is antisymmetric , with the additional restriction that a producer can not also prey on a consumer.@xcite in simulations we have taken @xmath15 and the nonzero @xmath16 as independent and uniformly distributed on @xmath24 $ ] .",
    "this model generates simple food webs with up to three trophic levels.@xcite    both of these models provide interesting results , which include intermittent dynamics with power spectral densities ( psds ) of diversities and population sizes that exhibit @xmath0-like noise , as well as power - law distributions for the lifetimes of individual species and the duration of quiet periods of relative evolutionary stasis . from a theoretical point of view",
    "they also have the great advantage that the mean - field equation for the steady - state average population sizes in the absence of mutations reduces to a set of linear ( if @xmath25 ) or at most quadratic equations and thus can easily be solved exactly.@xcite the models thus provide useful benchmarks for more realistic , but generally highly nonlinear models .    in fact , the population dynamics defined by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : pi ] ) and  ( [ eq : delta ] ) are not very realistic .",
    "in particular , by summing over positive and negative terms in @xmath13 , the models enable species with little food to remain near a steady state if they are also not very popular as prey , or have very low birth cost .",
    "a more serious problem is the _ ad - hoc _ nature of the normalization by the total population size @xmath26 in the resource and interaction terms in @xmath13 .",
    "while this is the source of the models analytic solvability , it implies an indiscriminate , universal competition without regard to whether or not two species directly utilize the same resources or share a common predator .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to develop models with more realistic population dynamics and explore the properties of their evolutionary dynamics .",
    "here we develop a model with more realistic population dynamics that include competition between different predators that prey on the same species , as well as a saturation effect expected to occur for a predator with abundant prey .",
    "in doing so , we retain from the models discussed above the important role of the interaction matrix @xmath19 , as well as the restriction to dynamics with nonoverlapping generations .",
    "we first deal with the competition between predator species by defining the number of individuals of @xmath22 that are available as prey for @xmath5 , corrected for competition from other predator species , as @xmath27 where @xmath28 runs over all @xmath1 such that @xmath29 , i.e. , over all predators of @xmath22 .",
    "thus , @xmath30 , and if @xmath5 is the only predator consuming @xmath22 , then @xmath31 .",
    "analogously , we define the competition - adjusted external resources available to a producer species @xmath5 as @xmath32 as in the case of predators , @xmath33 , and a sole producer species has all of the external resources available to it : @xmath34",
    ". with these definitions , the total , competition - adjusted resources available for the sustenance of species @xmath5 are @xmath35 where @xmath36 runs over all @xmath22 such that @xmath37 , i.e. , over all prey of @xmath5 .",
    "a central concept of the model is the _ functional response _ of species @xmath5 with respect to @xmath22 , @xmath38.@xcite this is the rate at which an individual of species @xmath5 consumes individuals of @xmath22 .",
    "the simplest functional response corresponds to the lotka - volterra model:@xcite @xmath39 if @xmath40 and 0 otherwise .",
    "however , it is reasonable to expect that the consumption rate should saturate in the presence of very abundant prey.@xcite for ecosystems consisting of a single pair of predator and prey , or a simple chain reaching from a bottom - level producer through intermediate species to a top predator , the most common forms of functional response are due to holling.@xcite for more complicated , interconnected food webs , a number of functional forms have been proposed in the recent literature,@xcite but there is as yet no agreement about a standard form . here",
    "we choose a ratio - dependent@xcite holling type ii form,@xcite @xmath41 where @xmath42 $ ] is the metabolic efficiency of converting prey biomass to predator offspring .",
    "analogously , the functional response of a producer species @xmath5 toward the external resource @xmath11 is @xmath43 in both cases , if @xmath44 , then the consumption rate equals the resource ( @xmath45 or @xmath46 ) divided by the number of individuals of @xmath5 , thus expressing intraspecific competition for scarce resources . in the opposite limit , @xmath47 ,",
    "the consumption rate is proportional to the ratio of the specific , competition - adjusted resource to the competition - adjusted total available sustenance , @xmath48 .",
    "the total consumption rate for an individual of @xmath5 is therefore @xmath49 the birth probability is assumed to be proportional to the consumption rate , @xmath50 \\ ; , \\label{eq : bi}\\ ] ] while the probability that an individual of @xmath5 avoids death by predation until attempting to reproduce is @xmath51 the total reproduction probability for an individual of species @xmath5 in this model is thus @xmath52 .",
    "we simulated the functional - response model over @xmath53 generations ( plus @xmath54 generations  warm - up \" ) for the following parameters : genome length @xmath55 ( @xmath56 potential species ) , external resource @xmath57 , fecundity @xmath58 , mutation rate @xmath59 , proportion of producers @xmath60 , interaction matrix @xmath19 with connectance @xmath61 and nonzero elements with a symmetric , triangular distribution over @xmath23 $ ] , and @xmath62 .",

    "a more realistic picture would be that an individual s total foraging effort is constant and can either be divided equally , or concentrated on richer resources .",
