    "since the seminal works by breuer and major @xcite , dobrushin and major @xcite , giraitis and surgailis @xcite , rosenblatt @xcite and taqqu @xcite , much attention has been given to the study of the asymptotic behaviour of normalized functionals of gaussian fields , as these quantities arise naturally in applications , for example , where models exhibiting _ long - range dependence _ are needed .",
    "the aforementioned papers focus on nonlinear functionals of a stationary gaussian field , for which one can derive a _ central limit theorem _ ( in a finite - dimensional sense or in a functional sense ) if the correlation function of the field decays sufficiently fast to zero ; see @xcite for a precise formulation . however , if the correlation function decays too slowly to zero , then only a _",
    "non - central limit theorem _ can be established , meaning that the limiting distribution fails to be gaussian ; see , for example , @xcite .",
    "in particular , these results apply to functionals of the _ fractional brownian motion _ ( fbm ) .",
    "let @xmath1 be a fbm with hurst parameter @xmath2 , which is the unique ( in law ) @xmath3-self similar gaussian process with stationary increments ; see ( [ ssi ] ) and ( [ si ] ) below for the definitions of these key properties . the behaviour of the so - called _ hermite variations _ of @xmath4 , depending on the value of @xmath3 , can be described as follows .",
    "let @xmath5 and let @xmath6 denote the @xmath7th hermite polynomial , the definition of which we recall in ( [ hermite - poly ] ) below .",
    "applying results from @xcite , one obtains that    if @xmath8 , then @xmath9    if @xmath10 , then @xmath11    if @xmath12 , then @xmath13    above , @xmath14 denotes convergence in law , @xmath15 denotes the centered gaussian law with variance @xmath16 , whereas @xmath17 stands for a so - called hermite random variable given by the value of an _ hermite process _ , of order @xmath7 with hurst parameter @xmath18 , at time @xmath19 .",
    "such an hermite process can be represented as a @xmath7-fold multiple wiener integral with respect to brownian motion , as proven by taqqu @xcite . moreover , the process is non - gaussian if @xmath20 .",
    "( more details on the hermite process are provided in section  [ ssecmain ] . ) the key observation here is that there are two regimes : _ gaussian _ , subsuming cases ( a ) and ( b ) , and _ hermite _ , case ( c ) , depending on the hurst parameter @xmath3 and on the order @xmath7 .",
    "the convergences in all cases ( a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) can be extended to more general functionals , which we call _ generalized variations _ in this paper , obtained by replacing the hermite polynomial @xmath6 with a function @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the so - called _ hermite rank _ of @xmath23 .",
    "( naturally , conditions on the summability of the coefficients @xmath24 have to be added . ) in this setting , the prevailing regime ( gaussian or hermite ) will depend on the hurst parameter @xmath3 and on the hermite rank @xmath22 analogously to the simpler setting discussed above .",
    "in addition , functional versions of these asymptotic results ( under additional assumptions on the coefficients @xmath25 ) can be proven in the skorohod space @xmath26)$ ] ; see @xcite .    in connection to applications that involve spatial or spatio - temporal modeling , processes of multiple parameters are also of interest .",
    "recently , there has been interest in understanding the asymptotic behaviour of realized quadratic variations and power variations of _ ambit fields _ @xcite .",
    "an ambit field is an anisotropic multiparameter process driven by white noise , or more generally , by an infinitely - divisible random measure .",
    "the problem of finding distributional limits ( central or non - central limit theorems ) for such power variations is , however , intricate because the dependence structure of an ambit field can be very general ; only a `` partial '' central limit theorem is obtained in @xcite . as a first approximation",
    ", it is thus useful to study this problem with simpler processes that incorporate some of the salient features of ambit fields , such as the non - semimartingality of one - parameter `` marginal processes '' ( see @xcite , section  2.2 ) and strong dependence . a tractable process that incorporates some key features of ambit fields is the _ fractional brownian sheet _ ( fbs ) , defined by ayache _",
    "@xcite , which is a multi - parameter extension of the fbm .",
    "in particular , it is a gaussian process with stationary rectangular increments .    for concreteness ,",
    "let @xmath27 ^ 2 \\}$ ] be a two - parameter anisotropic fbs with hurst parameter @xmath28 ; see section  [ ssecfbs ] for a precise definition . in view of the asymptotic behaviour in cases ( a ) ,",
    "( b ) , and  ( c ) involving the fbm , it is natural to ask what is the asymptotic behaviour of hermite variations of @xmath29 with different values of @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "consider , for example , the `` mixed '' case where @xmath32 and @xmath33 , which has no counterpart in the one - parameter setting . because of the structure of the fbs , it is tempting to conjecture that in this case the limiting law is a mixture of a gaussian law and a marginal law of an hermite process .",
    "however , as shown in @xcite , this is not the case and once again only two limiting laws can be obtained :    if @xmath34 , then @xmath35    if @xmath36 , then @xmath37    above , @xmath38 stands for the increment of @xmath29 over the rectangle @xmath39 , defined in section  [ ssecincrvar ] below , and @xmath40 is a suitable scaling factor ; see @xcite , pages 910 , for its definition .",
    "the limit in the case ( b@xmath41 ) is the value of a two - parameter _ hermite sheet _ ( see section  [ ssecmain ] ) , of order @xmath7 with hurst parameter @xmath42 , at point @xmath43 .",
    "contrary to the one - parameter case , the results obtained in @xcite are proved only for one - dimensional laws ; neither finite - dimensional ( except in the particular setting of @xcite ) nor functional convergence ( i.e. , tightness in a function space ) of hermite variations has been established so far .",
    "( in particular in the @xmath0-parameter realm with @xmath44 , tightness is a non - trivial issue , which has not been addressed in @xcite or in the related paper @xcite . )",
    "the first main result of this paper addresses the question about functional convergence in the general , @xmath0-parameter case for any @xmath45 .",
    "we prove a functional central limit theorem , theorem  [ gvar - clt ] , for generalized variations of a @xmath0-parameter anisotropic fbs @xmath29 .",
    "( as mentioned above , generalized variations extend hermite variations by replacing @xmath6 with a function @xmath23 of the form ( [ introf ] ) . )",
    "this result applies if at least one of the components of the hurst parameter vector @xmath46 of @xmath29 is less than or equal to @xmath47 , where @xmath22 is the hermite rank of @xmath23 .",
    "a novel feature of this result is that the limiting process is a new fbs , independent of @xmath29 , with hurst parameter vector @xmath48 given by @xmath49 for @xmath50 .",
    "note , in particular , that if @xmath51^d$ ] , then the limit reduces to an ordinary brownian sheet .",
    "the proof of theorem  [ gvar - clt ] is based on the limit theory for multiple wiener integrals , due to nualart and peccati @xcite , and its multivariate extension by peccati and tudor @xcite . to prove the functional convergence asserted in theorem  [ gvar - clt ] , we use the tightness criterion of bickel and wichura @xcite in the space @xmath26^d)$ ] , which is @xmath0-parameter generalization of @xmath26)$ ] , and a moment bound for nonlinear functionals of a stationary gaussian process on @xmath52 ( lemma  [ moment - bound ] ) .",
    "the second main result of this paper is a functional non - central limit theorem , theorem  [ gvar - nclt ] , for generalized variations of @xmath29 in the remaining case where each of the components of @xmath3 is greater than @xmath47 . in this case , the limit is a @xmath0-parameter hermite sheet and the convergence holds in probability and also pointwise in @xmath53 .",
    "assuming that @xmath29 is defined by a moving - average representation with respect to a white noise @xmath54 on @xmath55 , we can give a novel and explicit description of the limit ; it is defined using the representation introduced by clarke de la cerda and tudor @xcite with respect to the same white noise @xmath56 .",
    "this makes the relation between @xmath29 and the hermite sheet precise and constitutes a step further compared to the existing literature ( see @xcite ) , where the limiting hermite process / sheet is simply obtained as an abstract limit of a cauchy sequence , from which the properties of the limiting object are deduced .",
    "as an application of theorems [ gvar - clt ] and [ gvar - nclt ] , we study the asymptotic behaviour of power variations of the fbs @xmath29 . as a straightforward consequence of our main results ,",
    "we obtain a law of large numbers for these power variations .",
    "we then study the more delicate question regarding the asymptotic behaviour of rescaled fluctuations of power variations around the limit given by the law of large numbers .",
    "in the case of _ odd _ power variations , the rescaled fluctuations have a limit , either gaussian or hermite , but with _ even _ power variations , the fluctuations might not converge in a functional way if @xmath57 .",
    "we show that this convergence issue does not arise at all if one considers instead continuous , multilinear interpolations of power variations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ secmainresults ]",
    ", we introduce the setting of the paper , some key definitions and the statements of theorems [ gvar - clt ] and [ gvar - nclt ] .",
    "the proofs of these two main results are presented in sections  [ fdd - convergence ] and  [ fun - convergence ] , the former section collecting the finite - dimensional and the latter the functional arguments .",
    "finally , the application to power variations is given in section  [ secpower - var ] .",
