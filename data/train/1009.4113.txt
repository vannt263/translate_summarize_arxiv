    "for example , in simple systems with one relevant orbital per site , one would expect that when electrons are added to one site , the screening of the core charge increases , and as a consequence , the wave function of the orbital expands and the hopping to the nearest sites increases .",

    "has been solved exactly by the bethe ansatz @xcite .",
    "the simplest model with bond - charge interaction has been proposed by hirsch motivated by his theory of hole superconductivity @xcite .",

    "these quantities are also related to charge and spin localization indicators @xcite used for example to characterize valence - bond - solid states in quantum spin chains @xcite . while changes in the berry phase are proportional to changes in polarization , the spin berry phase tensor provides a geometric characterization of the ferrotoroidic moment @xcite .",
