    "in his seminal work , wyner [ 2 ] introduced the wiretap channel , a discrete memoryless channel where the sender alice transmits confidential messages to a legitimate receiver bob , in the presence of an eavesdropper eve . both reliable and confidential communication between alice and bob is shown to be achievable at the same time , by exploiting the physical difference between the channel to bob and that to eve , without the use of cryptographic means .",
    "many results of information theoretical nature are available in the literature for various classes of channels ranging from gaussian point - to - point channels to relay networks ( see e.g. @xcite for a survey ) capturing the trade - off between reliability and secrecy and aiming at determining the highest information rate that can be achieved with perfect secrecy , the so - called _",
    "secrecy capacity_. coding results focusing on constructing concrete codes that can be implemented in a specific channel are much fewer ( see @xcite for examples of wiretap codes dealing with channels with erasures ) .    in this paper",
    ", we will focus on gaussian wiretap channels , whose secrecy capacity was established in @xcite .",
    "examples of existing gaussian wiretap codes were designed for binary inputs , as in @xcite .",
    "a different approach was adopted in @xcite , where lattice codes were proposed , using as design criterion a new lattice invariant called _ secrecy gain _ , which was shown to characterize the confusion at the eavesdropper .",
    "this suggests the study of the secrecy gain of lattices as a way to understand how to design a good gaussian wiretap code .",
    "_ unimodular _ lattices were shown to be good candidates in @xcite and for _ even unimodular _ lattices , both secrecy gains for a special class of lattices called _ extremal _ lattices were computed and the asymptotic behavior of the average secrecy gain as a function of the dimension @xmath4 was investigated .",
    "these two papers were further developed in @xcite , where coding examples were detailed and it was shown that as @xmath4 grows to infinity , all even unimodular lattices behave in the same way , so that optimizing the secrecy gain makes sense in small dimensions .    the work of @xcite deals with even unimodular lattices , which only exist in dimensions a multiple of 8 .",
    "we pursue the study of unimodular lattices by considering odd unimodular lattices , which on the contrary exist in every dimension and in great number , giving thus more flexibility in the code design .",
    "we will also show examples of odd unimodular lattices outperforming even unimodular lattices .",
    "our contributions can be summarized as follows :    * we develop a general formula for the secrecy gain of both odd and even unimodular lattices that generalizes the existing one for even unimodular lattices .",
    "* we obtain the secrecy gain of unimodular lattices in dimension @xmath5 , covering the @xmath1 extremal odd unimodular lattices as well as all the @xmath2 non - extremal unimodular lattices . *",

    "secrecy gains of extremal odd unimodular lattices are computed to complete the study of extremal unimodular lattices . finally , secrecy gains of unimodular lattices in dimension @xmath6 , both odd and even , are computed , ending the classification of unimodular wiretap lattice codes in dimension @xmath5 . in section iv ,",
