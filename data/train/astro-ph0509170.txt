    "field be stars near the sun represent a sample of objects in different stages of the main sequence evolutionary phase ( ms ) .",
    "several hypothesis have been put forward to explain the distribution of the frequency of be stars against the spectral type . as be stars belong to the high velocity tail of a single b star velocity distribution ( zorec et al .",
    "2005 , martayan et .",
    "al . 2005 ) , there is no physical reason that the fraction of be stars be mass - dependent as apparently it comes up from statistics .",
    "in this contribution we show that the observed distribution of the frequency of be stars is determined by the balmer line emission efficiency as a function of the effective temperature .",
    "the probability of detecting a be star can be written as :    @xmath0    where @xmath1 is the probability that a b star becomes be ; @xmath2 is the average intensity of the h@xmath3 emission produced by a circumstellar disc of opacity @xmath4 in the center of the h@xmath3 line seen under an aspect angle @xmath5 ; @xmath6 is the probability the disc had an opacity @xmath4 ; @xmath7 is the total number of stars having effective temperature @xmath8 ; @xmath9 is the probability of seeing the disc at an inclination @xmath5 .",
    "the emission intensity factor is @xmath10 @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the photoionization- , thus , @xmath13-dominated h@xmath3 line source function ; @xmath14 contains geometrical parameters of the disc , which we assume be the same for all stars .",
    "the expected number of be @xmath15 is then given by @xmath16 @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the number of all stars in the studied mass or @xmath8 interval . since we assume @xmath19 @xmath20 , it comes up that @xmath21 @xmath20 which implies the number of expected be stars in a given mass range is not mass - dependent .",
    "figure 1a shows @xmath22 against @xmath8 and @xmath23 . to represent @xmath24 we used the total counts of b and be stars per mass interval in the v = 7 magnitude limited volume around the sun , so as to reflect closely the local imf .",
    "figure 1b shows the histogram of the observed fractions of be stars and the histogram predicted by ( 2.1 ) with @xmath25 .",
    "distributions resemble each other closely and maxima at b2 and from b7/8 are well accounted for .",
    "the maximum at b2 is due to the high h@xmath3 emission , while that at b7/8 is due to the increase of the imf function .",
    "the slight excess of predicted be stars in the cool extreme of the distribution can be due to stars that have not yet developed the be phenomenon and to actual be stars with too tiny or cool discs whose emission has remained unseen .",
    "there is enough fast rotating b stars , called bn stars , which can fit the excess predicted in the low temperature side ( zorec 2004 ) .",
