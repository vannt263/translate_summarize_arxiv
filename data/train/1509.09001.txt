    "recent observations have identified diffuse ly@xmath0 halos ( lahs ) around ly@xmath0 emitters ( laes ) and lyman - break galaxies ( lbgs ) by the stacking analysis that enables to find very diffuse and faint ly@xmath0 emission associated with high - redshift galaxies @xcite . @xcite",

    "more recently , ( * ? ? ?",

    "these previous studies suggest the inherent presence of lahs around laes and lbgs , whereas they provoke new questions : what is the origin of lahs , and which physical parameters determine the structure of lahs .",
    "theoretically , the scattered light of ly@xmath0 photons by neutral hydrogen ( hi ) gas in the circum - galactic medium ( cgm ) is thought as one possible origin of an lah ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , these studies have predicted that a galactic scale outflow and the environment of galaxies could produce the extended feature of ly@xmath0 emission . @xcite",
    "have investigated properties of lahs based on ly@xmath0 radiative transfer modeling in cosmological reionization simulations , and indicated that the slope of a radial surface brightness ( sb ) profile depends on an outflowing velocity of the cgm . @xcite",
    "have explored the nature of ly@xmath0 photons in an lah found in mo14 by comparing the lah obtained from their cosmological hydrodynamic galaxy formation simulation .",
    "their results have suggested that the extent of their lah over @xmath16 kpc radius is contributed by ly@xmath0 photons from satellite galaxies and the cold streams . @xcite",
    "have demonstrated that the radial sb profiles of lahs are flatter at the epoch of reionization than those at the post - reionization epoch , since ly@xmath0 photons scattered by hi gas in the intergalactic medium ( igm ) .",
    "observationally , the correlation between the lah sizes and the central galaxy properties has been investigated .",
    "ma12 have explored the scale lengths of their lahs @xmath3 as a function of the surface number density of laes @xmath17 , and found that scale lengths of their lahs correlate with @xmath17 .",
    "ma12 have also studied the dependence between scale lengths and uv - continuum magnitude of their laes , but no correlation has been identified .",
    "the dependence of scale lengths on uv luminosity has been discussed in @xcite and @xcite as well . @xcite",
    "have shown a marginal difference in scale lengths between uv luminous and faint lbg samples .",
    "on the other hand , @xcite have suggested that their lahs of uv - bright galaxies are more extended than that of all galaxies .",
    "the discrepancy of these results is unclear .",
    "however , this would be explained by the following two reasons .",
    "( 1 ) galaxies samples used in both ma12 and @xcite are found in over - dense regions , and their data include environmental effects .",
    "( 2 ) a marginal detection of the lah found in @xcite may not allow to measure its scale length accurately . in order to clearly understand the properties and physical origin of lahs , the detailed lah observations of galaxies in low - density environments are necessary .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the lah profiles and sizes as a function of observational properties of the central laes .",
    "our lae samples , which reside in field regions at @xmath2 ( @xcite , mo14 ) , are large enough to detect lahs of subsamples defined by various physical properties of the central laes .",

    "if the physical origin of lahs is not external sources such as satellites ( section [ sec : satellite ] ) , total ly@xmath0 luminosities may be underestimated in the previous studies with the amount indicated in equation [ eq : lf ] . in this case , the total - ly@xmath0 luminosity functions and densities may be revised .",

    "theoretical studies suggest three physical origins of lahs : ( 1 ) scattered light of hi gas in the cgm , ( 2 ) cold streams , and ( 3 ) satellite galaxies .",
    "these three possible origins are illustrated in figure [ fig : scenario ] . in the following subsections",
    ", we discuss these possibilities with our findings in conjunction with recent observation and simulation results .",
    "the first scenario is the scattered light of hi gas in the cgm ( figure [ fig : scenario]a ) . in this scenario ,",
    "ly@xmath0 photons are produced in star - forming regions and/or agns , and these ly@xmath0 photons escape from the interstellar medium ( ism ) to the cgm .",
    "the ly@xmath0 escape mechanism is key , but poorly understood .",
    "theoretical studies have proposed various mechanisms , such as outflows , clumpy clouds , and low column density of neutral hydrogen in the ism @xmath50 ( e.g. @xcite ) . because our study investigates neither spectra nor gas distribution of the ism scale , no results from our study test this scenario .",
    "recent spectroscopic observations have reported the evidence of the outflow , although the velocity is as small as @xmath51 km s@xmath25 ( e.g. @xcite ) . @xcite",
    "have argued that their observational results could be reproduced by the clumpy dust distribution model of the ism ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "deep optical and near - infrared spectra for gas dynamics and line diagnostics indicate that the ism of laes have a low @xmath50 ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "so far , there are no conclusive observational tests including our results that rule out this first scenario .",
    "the second scenario is the cold streams ( figure [ fig : scenario]b ) .",
    "cosmological hydrodynamical simulations suggest that intense star - formation of the high-@xmath1 galaxies ( @xmath52 ) is responsible for a dense and cold gas ( @xmath53 k ) inflows that are dubbed cold streams ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the cold streams radiate ly@xmath0 emission powered by gravitational energy , and produce an extended ly@xmath0 nebula around a galaxy .",
    "numerical simulations have indicated that a size of the cold stream ly@xmath0 nebula depends on a dark halo mass @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "their massive ( @xmath55 ) and less - massive ( @xmath56 ) galaxies have large and small ly@xmath0 nebulae whose sizes are @xmath57 and @xmath58 kpc in radius , respectively , because more ly@xmath0 photons are produced in and around massive halos . since clustering analyses of high-@xmath1 galaxies show a positive correlation between dark halo masses and uv luminosities @xcite , the dark halo mass dependence can be investigated with uv magnitudes . our results in section [ sec : results ] indicate that large lahs are found in uv luminous laes .",
    "these results are consistent with the scenario that the lahs are produced by the cold streams .",
    "however , figure [ fig : cmu_muv ] shows that @xmath31(ly@xmath0 ) values of our @xmath59 subsamples are lower than @xmath8 ",
    ". if the cold streams are responsible for the lahs under the circumstances that the majority of ly@xmath0 photons generated in a central galaxy could avoid dust extinction and escape to the lah , the @xmath31(ly@xmath0 ) values at large radii should be larger than @xmath60  that is the maximum value for ly@xmath0 photons originating from regular population ii star formation @xcite .",
    "it indicates that the majority of ly@xmath0 photons of our lahs are not produced in the cold streams .",
    "the third scenario is the satellite galaxies ( figure [ fig : scenario]c ) .",
    "satellite galaxies exist around an lae , and radiate ly@xmath0 emission .",
    "if the total radiation from the satellite galaxies is strong , satellite galaxies would produce the extended ly@xmath0 emission structure around the lae in the composite ly@xmath0 image .",
    "the extended ly@xmath0 emission structure may be identified as the lah .",
    "some cosmological simulations also indicate the presence of extended lahs due to the ly@xmath0 emission from satellite galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if there exists the significant ly@xmath0 contribution from satellite galaxies , an extended uv emission made by stellar components of the satellites would be shown in the composite uv - continuum images .",
    "we have found no such an extended uv emission in our composite uv - continuum images of figures [ fig : image]@xmath35[fig : radi_all_2 ] .",
    "however , our composite uv - continuum images suffer from sky over - subtraction at the level of @xmath61 erg s@xmath25 @xmath62 hz@xmath25 arcsec@xmath63 as described in section [ nonlae_stacking ] .",
    "it may cancel out the uv emission from satellite galaxies .",
    "we thus can not reach a conclusion about the satellite - galaxy contribution to the lahs with our data .",
    "in sections [ sec : scatter]@xmath35[sec : satellite ] , we discuss three possible physical origins of lahs : ( 1 ) the scattered light in the cgm , ( 2 ) the cold streams , and ( 3 ) satellite galaxies .",
    "our results rule out the possibility that ( 2 ) the cold streams is a major contributor to the lahs .",
    "because there remain the two possibilities of ( 1 ) the scattered light in the cgm and ( 3 ) satellite galaxies , we can not conclude one most likely scenario .",
    "recently , theoretical studies have claimed that lahs can not be reproduced only by the scattered light in the cgm whose emission is originated from a central galaxy . @xcite",
    "have used hydrodynamic simulations including galaxy formation , and shown a drop - off of the ly@xmath0 radial sb profile at @xmath64 kpc that does not agree with the results of mo14 . on the other hand ,",
    "the simulations of @xcite reproduce the ly@xmath0 radial sb profile at @xmath65 kpc of the mo14 s lahs , if they include the contribution from satellite galaxies in their simulations .",
    "if these simulation results are correct , the lah at @xmath65 kpc would be produced by the satellite galaxies .",
    "( ly@xmath0 ) as a function of radius for the @xmath59 subsamples .",
    "the red , yellow , and green lines denote the subsamples of @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 , respectively .",
    "although two subsamples of @xmath69 and @xmath70 reach @xmath71 and @xmath72  at the maximum , respectively , the error bars of two subsamples of @xmath69 and @xmath70 are too large to distinguish between the large and small ( @xmath73 ) values in @xmath31(ly@xmath0 ) .",
    "we thus omit the data points of the @xmath69 and @xmath70 subsamples for clarity . ]",
    "in this paper , we investigate lahs radial sb profiles and scale lengths @xmath3 as a function of the four physical quantities of central galaxies , ly@xmath0 luminosity @xmath74 , rest - frame uv magnitude @xmath59 , rest - frame ly@xmath0 equivalent width @xmath31 , and uv slope @xmath75 , and discuss lahs properties and origins .",
    "the major results of this paper are summarized below .    1 .",
    "we detect lahs from all lae subsamples of @xmath74 , @xmath59 , @xmath31 and @xmath75 , where we carefully examine the statistical and systematic errors in both the composite ly@xmath0 and uv images with the sb radial profiles of the non - lae composite images . comparing the non - lae composite images with the lae composite images , we rule out",
    "the possibility that a total of systematic uncertainties ( i.e. artifacts ) do not produce the lahs found in our lae composite data .",
    "we confirm that @xmath3 of ly@xmath0 radial sb profiles of our lahs are consistent with those previously obtained in ma12 and mo14 .",
    "we characterize our lahs with the cumulative radial profiles of @xmath76 and @xmath31 . here , the cumulative radial profiles are shown with @xmath36(@xmath37 ) @xmath77 and @xmath36(@xmath31 ) @xmath77 that are defined as @xmath76 and @xmath31 values within an aperture of radius @xmath78 , respectively , which are normalized at @xmath30 .",
    "we find that the @xmath36(@xmath37 ) @xmath77 values are large in the @xmath74-faint , @xmath59-bright , and @xmath31-small subsamples ( figure [ fig : f_lya]a@xmath35c ) .",
    "similarly , we also find the large @xmath36(@xmath31 ) @xmath77 values in the @xmath74-faint subsamples .",
    "these results indicate that there are prominent lahs around laes that have a faint ly@xmath0 luminosity , a bright uv luminosity , and/or a small @xmath31 ( figures [ fig : f_lya]@xmath35[fig : f_ew ] ) . in other words , galaxies with properties similar to lbgs , a faint @xmath37 luminosity ,",
    "a bright uv luminosity , and a small @xmath31 have strong lahs .",
    "we estimate @xmath3 values from the differential radial ly@xmath0 sb profiles of our lahs , and investigate correlations between @xmath3 and four physical quantities of @xmath74 , @xmath59 , @xmath31 , and @xmath75 ( figures [ fig : size_llya]@xmath35[fig : size_beta ] ) .",
    "we find anti - correlations between @xmath3 and @xmath74 , @xmath59 , or @xmath31 , and a positive correlation between @xmath3 and @xmath75 .",
    "the spearman s @xmath79 estimates suggest that there exist significant correlations in those of @xmath74 , @xmath31 , and @xmath75 , while the @xmath79 estimates indicate that the correlation between @xmath3 and @xmath59 is not very clear .",
    "we identify a clear anti - correlation between @xmath36(@xmath37 ) @xmath38 and @xmath32 , where @xmath36(@xmath37 ) @xmath38 is @xmath36(@xmath37 ) @xmath77 for @xmath29 kpc ( figure [ fig : fraclyalya ] ) .",
    "the @xmath36(@xmath37 ) @xmath38 value is high , about @xmath41 , for the laes with @xmath42 erg s@xmath25 , and there is a clear anti - correlation between @xmath36(@xmath37 ) @xmath38 and @xmath32 . if the majority of ly@xmath0 emission of lahs are not originated from external sources such as satellites ( section [ sec : satellite ] ) , total ly@xmath0 luminosities of high-@xmath1 galaxies may be underestimated in a popular @xmath80-radius aperture photometry by the amount indicated in equation [ eq : lf ] .",
    "if it is true , the total - ly@xmath0 luminosity functions and densities would be revised .",
    "5 .   with our results ,",
    "we discuss three scenarios for the origin of lahs : ( 1 ) the scattered light of hi gas in the cgm , ( 2 ) the cold streams , and ( 3 ) satellite galaxies .",
    "our cumulative radial profiles of rest - frame ly@xmath0 equivalent width do not support the cold stream scenario ( 2 ) , because the ly@xmath0 equivalent width reaches only @xmath8  that is significantly smaller than 240 , the maximum value for ly@xmath0 photons originating from regular population ii star formation . on the other hand , our results do not test the scenarios of ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) .",
    "we thus conclude that there remain two possible scenarios of ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) .",
