    "the systematic study of the quark propagator on the lattice has provided fruitful interaction with other approaches to hadron physics , such as instanton phenomenology  @xcite , chiral quark models  @xcite and dyson - schwinger equation studies  @xcite . as a first principles approach lattice qcd has provided valuable constraints for model builders . in turn",
    ", such alternative methods can provide feedback on regions that are difficult to access directly on the lattice , such as the deep infrared and chiral limits .",
    "the quark propagator has previously been studied using clover  @xcite , staggered  @xcite and overlap  @xcite actions . for a review ,",
    "see ref .",
    "all these actions have different systematic errors and the combination of these studies has given us an excellent handle on the possible lattice artifacts in quenched qcd .    in this study",
    "we focus on the landau gauge quark propagator in full qcd , and extend our previous work  @xcite to a finer lattice with lattice spacing @xmath6 fm  @xcite but similar physical volume in order to test whether we are close to the continuum limit for these lattices .",

    "weighting for the fermion determinants is provided by the so - called , `` fourth root trick . '' .",
    "while the current numerical results  @xcite provide compelling evidence that the fourth root trick gives an accurate estimate of the dynamical fermion weight , the formal issue of proving that this provides the determinant of a local fermion action from first principles remains unresolved .",
