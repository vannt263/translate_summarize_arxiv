    "in the past few years , first - passage properties in nonequilibrium situations have attracted much interest , with numerous works devoted to the so - called persistence phenomenon ( for a recent review , see @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "the simplest setting might be within the field of phase - ordering kinetics where , as domain growth proceeds , the following question naturally arises @xcite : what is the fraction @xmath3 of space which has always been in the same phase ( say the @xmath4 one ) up to time @xmath5 ?",
    "equivalently for zero - temperature quenches , @xmath3 is the probability that a given spin has never flipped up to time @xmath5 , and is observed to decay in time as @xmath6 , @xmath7 being the persistence exponent .",
    "the latter can also be considered as a first - passage exponent , since @xmath8 represents the probability that an interface first sweeps over a given point at time @xmath5 .",
    "experimental measurements of @xmath7 have been conducted in breath figures @xcite , and in a system of nematic liquid crystal akin to the @xmath9 ising model dynamics @xcite . at par with the general view that thermal noise should be asymptotically irrelevant in coarsening systems ,",
    "several numerical methods @xcite indicate that @xmath7 seems to keep the same value for all quenches in the broken - symmetry region .",
    "unfortunately , exact calculations of this new critical exponent are scarce @xcite since , after integrating out at a given location in space the spatial degrees of freedom , one has to deal with an effective stochastic process which is generically non - markovian .",
    "perturbative techniques to calculate @xmath7 have therefore been developed @xcite , especially when a spin can be associated with ( the sign of ) a gaussian process , a situation common to various closure schemes @xcite of phase - ordering .",
    "other lines of investigation have been concerned with extending the notion of ( local ) persistence probability .",
    "this includes notably the definition of a persistence exponent @xmath10 for the global order parameter ( at @xmath11 @xcite , and below @xcite ) , the notion of block - persistence @xcite ( which encompasses both @xmath7 and @xmath10 ) , and two others generalizations @xcite , relaxing in a different fashion the no spin - flip constraint inherent to the definition of @xmath3 .",
    "here we shall deal with the extension introduced in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , which is based on the consideration of the local mean magnetization : @xmath12 this quantity is simply related to the proportion of time spent in one the two possible phases by a given spin @xmath13 .",
    "the distribution of @xmath14 contains also the persistence probability , for @xmath15 . yet , as soon as @xmath16 , changes of phase are allowed , and one observes that @xmath14 converges , when @xmath17 , to a broad limiting distribution @xmath18 , reminiscent of the classical arcsine law for brownian motion , whose singular behaviour @xmath19 at the edges @xmath20 of its support involves the persistence exponent @xcite .",
    "another conceptually related route giving access to @xmath7 is to consider , for a fixed value of the level @xmath21 , the persistent large deviations @xmath22 of the mean magnetization , which can be also interpreted as a the ( @xmath4)-persistence of the process @xmath23 $ ] . for large times",
    ", this quantity decays as a power - law @xmath24 @xcite , and the original persistence exponent appears as the limiting case @xmath25 of a continuously - varying family of .",
    "let us mention that another infinite hierarchy of exponents appears when one allows a spin to be `` reborn '' with a certain probability @xmath26 each time it flips @xcite , or when one considers the survival properties of ( spatial ) domains in coarsening systems @xcite . in fact , @xmath27 displays a non - trivial structure even for the simple ( uncorrelated ) binomial random walk @xcite .",
    "although the existence of level - dependent exponents is by no means new ( see , e.g. , @xcite for gaussian processes , and the more recent work @xcite ) , it is physically very appealing that , as pointed out in @xcite , both the limit law @xmath28 and the spectra @xmath29 seems to be _",
    "universal _ for the @xmath9 ising model in the whole region @xmath30 , up to a rescaling of @xmath31 by the corresponding equilibrium value of the magnetization , thus reflecting the fact that coarsening systems , though perpetually out - of - equilibrium , are nevertheless in _ local _ equilibrium .",
    "we have also argued recently @xcite that the global shape of the @xmath29 curve is a sensitive probe of the type of noise ( stochastic or deterministic ) vehicled by the domain walls motion , thereby suggesting an explanation to the discrepancy currently reported @xcite between the persistence exponents of the @xmath9 ising model and of its continuous counterpart , the time - dependent ginzburg - landau ( tdgl ) equation .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to present a family of models for which generalized persistence properties can be obtained analytically .",
    "we shall do this within the framework of the independent interval approximation ( iia ) used in @xcite to calculate the persistence exponent for a gaussian random field evolving under the diffusion equation .",
    "the iia has been used later to determine the limit law for this system @xcite , and our work is a natural continuation of this study .",
    "although the iia is an uncontrolled approximation , limited to `` smooth '' processes ( that is , if @xmath32 , the process @xmath33 must be everywhere ( with respect to @xmath5 ) differentiable ) , this method has given very accurate results , both for @xmath7 and @xmath34 .",
    "excellent agreement will be also found here when comparing our results with the spectrum @xmath29 obtained numerically for the diffusion equation . in a certain limit",
    ", there will also appear an unexpected similarity with an exact relationship obtained for the @xmath29 exponents of the lvy - based model studied in @xcite , although the latter process resembles the @xmath35 ising model and is non - smooth in nature . to conclude our motivation ,",
    "we mention that some of our analytical results rely on a technique to deal with multiplicative random recursions ( defining a so - called kesten variable @xcite ) , on which constraints are enforced .",
    "since such variables show up in a variety of one - dimensional random systems @xcite , it is also hoped that the method introduced here might prove helpful to tackle new questions in this field .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we review the iia .",
    "section 3 and section 4 are respectively concerned with the determination of generalized persistence properties when the number of spin - flips is fixed ( section 3 ) , and when the time is fixed ( section 4 ) .",
    "we conclude in section 5 with a discussion .",
    "to fix notations , we first give a brief account of this method used in @xcite to calculate the persistence exponent for the diffusion equation .",
    "owing to dynamic scaling , coarsening systems with algebraic growth laws can be rendered stationary by going over to `` logarithmic '' time @xmath36 .",
    "the principle of the iia is to assume that the lengths of the ( logarithmic ) times @xmath37 between successive spin - flips @xmath38 form a renewal process , the common probability distribution function @xmath39 of these intervals being determined by relating it to the scaling form @xmath40 of the spin - spin autocorrelation function ( which is known exactly for the diffusion equation , and more generally for any gaussian process ) .",
    "the relationship reads , in laplace space ( @xmath41 ) , @xmath42/2 \\over   1+{\\left\\langlel\\right\\rangle}[1-s \\hat{a}(s)]/2}.\\ ] ] in  ( [ loiiia ] ) , the average length @xmath43 between two zero - crossings is determined by the small-@xmath44 behavior @xmath45 of the correlator . if @xmath46 with an exponent @xmath47 , as happens in the @xmath35 ising model ( for which @xmath48 ) or for some interface growth models @xcite ( where @xmath49 is related to the roughness exponent ) , then @xmath50 is infinite and the iia can not be used as such ( see , however , @xcite ) to enumerate the spin - flips : any change of sign is likely to be followed by a dense sequence of zero - crossings ( of fractal dimension @xmath51 @xcite ) .",
    "otherwise , the expected large - time behavior @xmath52 of the persistence probability can be inferred from the existence of a pole at @xmath53 for @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "this procedure can be implemented in the ohta - jasnow - kawasaki closure scheme of phase ordering @xcite ( abbreviated from now on as the `` diffusion equation '' ) , where the dynamics of a spin is recast in terms of an auxiliary diffusing field , @xmath55 evolving from zero - mean random ( gaussian , or simply short - ranged ) initial conditions .",
    "the zeros of this diffusing field are interpreted as representing the positions of domain walls : @xmath56 . at a given location in space ,",
    "the normalized process @xmath57^{1/2}$ ] is still gaussian , therefore solely determined by its two - time correlation function : @xmath58^{d/4},\\ ] ] which depends only on the ratio @xmath59 of the two times .",
    "the spin - spin autocorrelation function is @xmath60 , ( this equality holding true for any gaussian process ) , and reads , when expressed in terms of the stationary timescale @xmath61 , @xmath62^{-d/2}\\right\\}}.\\ ] ] plugging this back into  ( [ loiiia ] ) gives values of the persistence exponent @xmath7 extremely close compared with those obtained by a direct simulation of  ( [ equadiffu ] ) : one finds respectively in @xmath63 space dimensions @xmath64 ,",
    "@xmath65 , @xmath66 , while @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 @xcite .",
    "the iia can also be used to calculate the limit law of the mean magnetization @xcite . for our later purposes , it is convenient to introduce the ratios @xmath70 of two successive flip - times .",
    "we denote their common distribution by @xmath71 .",
    "the laplace transform @xmath54 of the probability distribution of the @xmath72 s is nothing but the mellin transform @xmath73 of that of the @xmath74 s , which implies that @xmath75 in  ( [ fzto0 ] ) , the proportionality constant @xmath76 can be computed from the residue at @xmath53 of the mellin - laplace transform  ( [ loiiia ] ) ) .",
    "according to the sign of @xmath77 , one can now rewrite @xmath78 $ ] as @xmath79 here , @xmath80 is the length of ( logarithmic ) time since the last zero - crossing , and the `` weights '' @xmath81 s ( which belong to the interval @xmath82 ) are identified as kesten variables , for they obey the following random multiplicative relation : @xmath83 in the large - time limit , the random variable @xmath81 converges in distribution to the solution of @xmath84 , which means that the probability distribution @xmath85 of @xmath86 has to satisfy the following integral equation : @xmath87 the solution of  ( [ integralg ] ) represents the major step for the determination of the limit law of the mean magnetization , since for a renewal process the law of the backward recurrence time @xmath88 is known : @xmath89 .",
    "one of the very few cases where the dyson - schmidt integral equation  ( [ integralg ] ) can be inverted explicitly is when the distribution @xmath90 is a pure powerlaw in @xmath91 , that is when @xmath92 @xcite .",
    "one then finds @xmath93 ( @xmath94 being the usual beta function ) , and eventually that the limit density of the mean magnetization is a beta - law on @xmath95 : @xmath96 this particular choice for @xmath97 , proportional to the tail - behavior of the true distribution , nevertheless contains much of the physics of the persistence phenomenon since , in all coarsening systems , the limit density of the mean magnetization is found to be numerically indistinguishable on its whole support from the law  ( [ loibetam ] ) @xcite .",
    "this can also be demonstrated within the iia for the diffusion equation ( using the full law @xmath98 determined by  ( [ loiiia])-  ( [ correldiffu ] ) ) , where one finds ( by extrapolating the large - order behavior of the moments of @xmath99 ) that the tail - behavior @xmath100 contains an overwhelming proportion of the full measure @xcite .",
    "let us now define the quantities of interest in the present work .",
    "depending whether the number of spin - flips @xmath101 or the time @xmath5 is fixed , we want to calculate @xmath102 in  ( [ defrnx ] ) , @xmath103 is the value of the mean magnetization at exactly the @xmath104-th flip - time .",
    "these two aspects of generalized persistence properties are different , but we shall show that they are related .",
    "let us start with a study of @xmath105 .",
    "we assume from now on that initially @xmath106 , and that the the first spin - flip ratio @xmath107 possesses the same law as the others : @xmath108 , with @xmath109 .",
    "since the last condition @xmath110 in  ( [ defrnx ] ) can only be violated had it been satisfied earlier when a spin is journeying in the minus phase , that is , after an odd number of spin - flips , one has @xmath111 .",
    "expressed in terms of the weights @xmath112 introduced earlier , the @xmath101 conditions to be maintained at the @xmath113th spin - flip time are : @xmath114 instead of considering all the instances taken by the @xmath112 s and then applying the constraints  ( [ conditions_w2n ] ) , it is sufficient to consider the ensemble of constrained variables @xmath115 $ ] transformed by @xmath116 ( henceforth to simplify notations we do not display the dependence of the variables @xmath112 upon @xmath31 ) .",
    "this does not define a map on @xmath117 $ ] , since some variables may fall outside the interval .",

    "indeed , sites satisfying ( [ defrtx ] ) must at least have their local magnetization @xmath253 , and in the long - time limit there is a fraction @xmath254 of such sites .",
    "conversely , the decay rate @xmath29 ( with respect to the logarithmic timescale @xmath255 ) of the generalized persistence probability @xmath27 should be proportional to @xmath256 , at least when correlations and constraints can be neglected , that is for @xmath184 .",
    "the simplest possibility ( on dimensional grounds ) is then that the proportionality factor between @xmath29 and @xmath256 be given by the usual persistence exponent @xmath7 .",
    "however , as testified by ( [ tax_el_rho ] ) , other constants may show up when @xmath7 does not parametrize completely the distribution of intervals between zero - crossings ( i.e. when the latter is not exactly equal to @xmath257 , which implies in particular that @xmath43 and @xmath258 are different ) , which is the generic situation for smooth processes . note also that , for the lvy - model studied in @xcite , there is no other scale than the one given by @xmath7 ( when the lvy laws have an infinite mean , i.e. for an exponent @xmath259 ) , and  thanks to the sparre andersen theorem ( see , e.g. , the appendix of @xcite )  the equality @xmath260 holds exactly for any level @xmath31 .",
    "we now turn to a comparison of our analytical results with numerical measurements of @xmath29 conducted for the diffusion equation ( figure [ fig2 ] ) , in one and two space dimensions .",
    "= 7.5 truecm    the behaviors predicted by ( [ taxto1])-([taxtom1generic ] ) are confirmed , even though they have been derived within the iia . at the lower edge of the spectrum ,",
    "a power - law rise @xmath261 is compatible with the data ( despite the obvious numerical imprecisions in this region ) . at the upper edge of the spectrum , where we have a much smaller statistical uncertainty",
    ", @xmath29 approaches its limiting value @xmath262 with a vanishing slope .",
    "a numerical fit of the data of the form @xmath263 would give an exponent @xmath264 , which is in fair agreement with our prediction ( [ taxto1 ] ) .",
    "we have also represented on figure [ fig2 ] the spectrum of generalized persistence exponents obtained by direct simulation of a temporal process for which the laws of successive spin - flip ratios are taken to be uncorrelated and distributed according to a pure powerlaw @xmath133 , with an exponent @xmath265 .",
    "for such a zero - dimensional process , clean powerlaws extending over fifteen decades of time can be obtained without much effort , and the numerical accuracy on the @xmath29 spectrum is very high .",
    "let us note that in this case the probability density function @xmath171 does not vanish near @xmath172 and , browsing through the chain of arguments leading to ( [ taxto1 ] ) , the correct prediction near @xmath170 is that @xmath29 reaches its limiting value with a finite slope .",
    "this is indeed observed in our simulations .",
    "one also remarks that , even within this `` doubly '' simplified model , the overall agreement with the real spectra is rather good .    to quantify better the effect of temporal correlations , we have also determined numerically the @xmath29 spectrum for a process with a distribution of ( uncorrelated ) intervals given by the full law ( [ loiiia ] ) .",
    "we have first followed @xcite , taylor - expanding ( [ loiiia ] ) in powers of @xmath174 . inversion term by term gives the expansion of @xmath39 near @xmath266 , and the resulting series is resummed by constructing rational pad approximants of the form @xmath267 , @xmath268 and @xmath269 being polynomials of respective degree @xmath270 and @xmath271 . for the @xmath9 diffusion equation",
    ", we have extended the order of the pad approximants to @xmath272 .",
    "the spin - flip ratios are generated using a rejection method , and the @xmath29 can then be obtained .",
    "a comparison with the real spectra computed for the @xmath9 diffusion equation is presented on figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "= 7.5 truecm    on the whole range of the @xmath31-values , the agreement is excellent .",
    "of course , beyond a certain range of times , the pad approximants are not able anymore to mimic the exponential decay of the probability distribution function @xmath39 ( see inset of figure [ fig3 ] ) , which is the reason why the curve corresponding to the pad method is systematically overshooting the real one .",
    "= 7.5 truecm    to circumvent this limitation , we have eventually parametrized the probability distribution function @xmath39 as @xmath273 , @xmath274 being polynomials in @xmath275 of respective order @xmath270 and @xmath271 .",
    "the coefficients of these polynomials are determined to match faithfully both the small-@xmath275 ( @xmath276 ) and large-@xmath275 behavior ( @xmath277 ) of the law of the intervals .",
    "the implementation of this procedure ( with @xmath278 ) for the @xmath9 diffusion equation leads to a discrepancy ( figure [ fig4 ] ) on the whole spectrum of @xmath29 exponents which does not exceed the difference between  and is of the same sign as  the numerically measured value @xmath279 and the value @xmath280 predicted by the iia .",
    "we have shown in this work how it is possible to gain a better understanding of persistence properties for processes having a finite density of zero - crossings .",
    "the analytical results we have obtained , even though they have been derived within an approximate scheme , are in excellent agreement with numerical simulations conducted for the diffusion equation , which is considered as one of the simplest  yet non - trivial  model of coarsening .",
    "furthermore , unexpected connections with relationships obtained in another class of stochastic processes have also emerged , which indicates that a certain universality of first - passage properties may exist in those systems , at least on a formal level .",
    "let us also emphasize that , if one forgets the relationship ( [ loiiia ] ) between the distribution function of intervals and the correlation function , it becomes possible @xcite to account for all types of @xmath29 spectra encountered in coarsening systems .",
    "finally , outside the realm of persistence and of its siblings , the method we have presented in section 3 should have a wide range of applicability for multiplicative stochastic processes .",
    "for instance , the calculation we have presented in section 3 for generalized persistence properties after a fixed number of spin - flips can be rephrased in terms of the exact solution of a random fragmentation problem , the latter topic being of ongoing interest @xcite .",
    "it is also striking to note that first - passage exponents calculated recently for reaction - diffusion problems in the presence of disorder with the help of an asymptotically exact renormalization group also obey hypergeometric equations similar to ( [ mainresult ] ) @xcite .",
    "actually , the persistence probability is slightly different from the distribution function of intervals , since in the former , one does not condition on having zeros at both endpoints of the interval .",
    "but the large - time behaviour ( @xmath281 ) of these two quantities is the same .          indeed , while this article was being accepted for publication , two very recent works by t. w. burkhardt and g. de smedt , c. godrche , j .-",
    "luck ( preprint _ cond - mat/0009001 _ ) dealing with another smooth gaussian process for which our method is relevant have been brought to our attention .",
    "these authors have calculated exactly ( independently and by completely different methods ) the partial survival exponent @xmath282 for a randomly accelerated particle ( i.e of which the position @xmath283 obeys @xmath284 , @xmath285 being a gaussian white noise ) .",
    "this stochastic process ( see for a list of references on this problem ) , being the integral of brownian motion , has a finite density of zero - crossings @xmath286 .",
    "the fact that our equation ( ) does match their result @xmath287 in the @xmath288-limit ( identifying @xmath26 with @xmath289 in this weakly - constrained regime , as we have argued before ) gives us further credence to the general validity of the results we have obtained in this section ."
