    "pulsating pg1159 stars ( also called gw vir or dov stars ) are very hot hydrogen - deficient post - asymptotic giant branch stars with surface layers rich in he , c and o ( werner & herwig 2006 ) exhibiting multimode pulsations ( non - radial @xmath0-modes ) with periods ranging from 5 to 50 minutes ( winget & kepler 2008 ) .",
    "it is generally accepted that these stars have their origin in a born - again episode induced by a post - agb he thermal pulse ( althaus et al . 2005 ) .",
    "recently , considerable observational effort has been invested to study pulsating pg1159 stars . particularly noteworthy",
    "are the observational efforts devoted to rxj 2117.1 + 3412 ( vauclair et al .",

    "2008 ) . on the theoretical front , recent important progress in the numerical modeling of pg1159 stars ( althaus et al . 2005 ; miller bertolami & althaus 2006 ) has paved the way for unprecedented seismological inferences for the mentioned stars ( crsico et al .",

    ", we present a seismological study of the high - gravity pulsating pg1159 stars pg 2131 + 066 and pg 1707 + 427 , two stars that have been intensively scrutinized with the whole earth telescope .    our pulsation analysis is based on a new generation of stellar models that take into account the complete evolution of pg1159 progenitor stars with initial masses on the zams ranging from 1 to @xmath4 ( althaus et al .",
    "2005 ; miller bertolami & althaus 2006 ) .",
    "all the post - agb evolutionary sequences were computed using the lpcode evolutionary code and were followed through the very late thermal pulse and the resulting born - again episode that gives rise to the h - deficient , he- , c- and o - rich composition characteristic of pg1159 stars .",
    "the masses of the resulting remnants are 0.530 , 0.542 , 0.556 , 0.565 , 0.589 , 0.609 , 0.664 , and @xmath5 .",
    "we computed @xmath6 @xmath0-mode adiabatic pulsation periods for these equilibrium models with the same numerical code and methods we employed in our previous works ( crsico & althaus 2006 ) .",
    "here , we constrain the stellar mass of  and  by comparing the asymptotic period spacing and the average of the computed period spacings with the _ observed _ period spacing . these approaches are based on the fact that the period spacing of pg1159 pulsators depends primarily on the stellar mass , and the dependence on the luminosity and the he - rich envelope mass fraction is negligible ( kawaler & bradley 1994 ; crsico & althaus 2006 ) . fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] displays the asymptotic period spacing for @xmath7 modes as a function of the effective temperature for different stellar masses .",
    "also shown in this diagram is the location of , with @xmath8 kk ( dreizler & henber 1998 ) and @xmath9 s ( reed et al . 2000 ) , and , with @xmath10 kk ( dreizler & heber 1998 ) and @xmath11 s ( kawaler et al . 2004 ) . the asymptotic period spacing is computed as in tassoul et al .",
    "( 1990 ) . from the comparison between the observed @xmath12 and @xmath13 we found a stellar mass of @xmath14 for and @xmath15 for . in fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] we show the run of average of the computed ( @xmath16 ) period spacings ( @xmath6 ) for   ( left panel ) , and   ( right panel ) in terms of the effective temperature for all of our pg1159 evolutionary sequences . from the comparison between the observed @xmath17 and @xmath18 , we found a stellar mass of @xmath19 and @xmath20 for   and , respectively .",
    "these values are @xmath21 ( for ) and @xmath22 ( for ) smaller than those derived through the asymptotic period spacing , showing once again that the asymptotic approach overestimates the stellar mass of pg1159 stars that , like  and , exhibit short and intermediate pulsation periods .",
    "in this approach we seek pulsation models that best matches the _",
    "individual _ pulsation periods of  and . for both stars ,",
    "we assume that all of the observed periods correspond to @xmath6 modes ( kawaler et al . 1995 ; kawaler et al . 2004 ) .",
    "the goodness of the match between the theoretical pulsation periods ( @xmath23 ) and the observed individual periods ( @xmath24 ) is measured by means of a merit function , @xmath25 , which takes into account the differences between the observed and theoretical periods squared . for each star ,",
    "the pg 1159 model that shows the lowest value of @xmath26 will be adopted as the `` best - fit model '' . for , we find a clear seismological solution corresponding to a model with @xmath27 and @xmath28 kk .",
    "this model provides an excellent agreement between the theoretical and observed periods .",
    "this is quantitatively reflected by the average of the absolute period differences , @xmath29 and the root - mean - square residual @xmath30 s. for , we find a unambiguous seismological solution for a model with @xmath31 and @xmath32 kk , an effective temperature compatible with the spectroscopic determination .",
    "we found @xmath33 s and @xmath34 s.    the main features of our best - fit model for  are summarized in table [ table3 ] .",
    "the total mass of the best - fit model ( @xmath35 ) is in agreement with the value derived from the average of the computed period spacings ( @xmath36 ) , but at odds ( @xmath37 smaller ) with that inferred from the asymptotic period spacing ( @xmath38 ) . also , the @xmath39 value of our best - fit model is substantially larger than the spectroscopic mass of @xmath40 ( dreizler & heber 1998 ; miller bertolami & althaus 2006 ) for . a discrepancy between the seismological and the spectroscopic values of @xmath39",
