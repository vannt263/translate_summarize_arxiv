    "the measurement of the @xmath0 coupling , made by the cleo collaboration @xcite , yelding the result @xmath3 , created embarrassement in the community of qcd sum rules ( qcdsr ) which , by means of various schemes , had predicted much smaller values .",
    "several different approaches of qcdsr were employed : two point function combined with soft pion techniques @xcite , light cone sum rules(lcsr ) @xcite , light cone sum rules including perturbative corrections @xcite , sum rules in a external field @xcite , double momentum sum rules @xcite and double borel sum rules @xcite . the lcsr prediction made in ref .",
    "@xcite became even smaller after the radiative corrections have been included  @xcite .",
    "the upper limit of these predictions was @xmath4 @xcite and it turned out to be 30% lower than the central value of the cleo measurement .",
    "although the qcd sum rule approach certainly suffers from large uncertainties , in several other cases good agreements with experiment were obtained .",
    "therefore , we can not simply be skeptical about the whole sum rule approach .",
    "the @xmath5 coupling constant does not seem , a priori , to be particularly exotic and other theoretical approaches did not produce such large discrepancies for this quantity . a careful discussion meant to reduce the uncertainties presented by quark models , performed in the framework of dirac equation  @xcite , and prior to the experimental measurement , has led to the result @xmath6 .",
    "it should be stressed that this result has been obtained in the heavy quark limit .",
    "the recent ( quenched ) lattice qcd calculation has produced @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "it is therefore important to understand the specific difficulty which the standard sum rule approach seems to encounter in this case .",
    "after the appearance of experimental data , three works @xcite tried to reconcile the lcsr estimates with the measured figure . in @xcite , it was noted that the inclusion of an explicit radial excitation contribution to the hadronic side of the lcsr ( often referred to as the left hand side of the sum rule ) could significantly improve the value of @xmath8 and , at the same time , the stability of the sum rule with respect to the borel parameter @xmath9 .    in the standard qcdsr approach of @xcite , a modification in the continuum contribution ( such as the explicit inclusion of a radial exictation ) does not seem to be neither necessary nor promising , because there the borel suppression is much more effective . in ref .",
    "@xcite the @xmath10 form factor was estimated as a function of the off - shell pion momentum @xmath1 . since the sum rule obtained from the three - point function adopted is not valid at @xmath11 , in order to determine the @xmath0 coupling , it was necessary to extrapolate the @xmath1 behaviour of the form factor .",
    "of course there are large uncertainties in this procedure , and , the value of @xmath12 obtained was much smaller than the experimental result . in a subsequent calculation of the @xmath13 vertex @xcite ,",
    "the @xmath13 form factor was calculated for both @xmath2 and @xmath14 off - shell mesons and the qcdsr results were parametrized by analytical forms such that the respective extrapolations to the @xmath2 and @xmath14 poles provided consistent values for the @xmath15 coupling constant .",
    "this method of double parametrization plus matching at the on - shell point was then employed in @xcite to recalculate the @xmath0 coupling and led to the value g_d^*d=14.0 1.5 .",
    "[ gd ]    while this number is much closer to the experimental value , there is still a discrepancy .",
    "moreover , the procedure of fitting the qcdsr points in the deep euclidean region and extrapolating them to the time - like region still contains uncertainties , such as , for example _ the analytical form chosen for the parametrizations _ , i.e. , monopole , exponential or gaussian .    in the present work we return to this question and employ hadronic loops , calculated by means of",
    "effective field theories ( eft ) , in order to produce a better parametrization for @xmath16 results derived by means of qcdsr .",
    "purely hadronic calculations are independent from qcdsr and involve the choice of an effective lagrangian , including the possible requirements of chiral symmetry and/or @xmath17 .",
    "however , beyond tree level , one has to deal with the problems and uncertainties associated with renormalization . as we discuss in the sequence , a suitable combination of eft and qcdsr results",
    "allows the elimination of undesired indeterminacies of both approaches , improving significantly their predictive powers .",
    "effective interactions are discussed in section ii , whereas results and conclusions are presented in sects .",
    "iv and v. as an straightforward exercise we also make a prediction for @xmath18 .",
    "the full @xmath16 vertex function is shown in fig .",
    "1 . leading contributions to this vertex come from both the tree interaction and the three classes of diagrams depicted in figs . 2 , 3 and 4 .",
    "meson loops are a necessary consequence of quantum field theory and do contribute to several hadronic observables . in practice , due to problems associated with infinities ,",
    "renormalization becomes unavoidable in the evaluation of loop corrections to observables .",
    "nowadays , this kind of procedure is rather well established at the hadronic level , in processes such as pion - pion and pion - nucleon scatterings . in the case of @xmath2 mesons , on the other hand ,",
    "the theory is much less developed and hence we resort to an alternative . the basic idea is to isolate the unknown loop parameters into some basic constants , in such a way that they can be determined by matching the results of loop and qcdsr results .    before proceding ,",
    "some remarks are in order .",
    "we first note that some diagrams , such as , for instance , that in fig .",
    "2a , contain internal vertices involving the @xmath16 coupling .",
    "this suggests that the calculation is `` cyclic '' , since one needs to use the @xmath16 form factor in order to calculate the @xmath16 form factor .",
    "actually , there are differences between the internal particles and the external ones .",
    "the former are always virtual , whereas the latter may be either real or put on mass shell in the extraction of the coupling constant . in the framework of perturbation theory , at leading order , internal particles",
    "are treated as elementary , without structure .",
    "they are assumed to be point - like and the evaluation of leading terms does not require the use of internal form factors .",
    "consistently , one must use bare coupling constants for these interactions .",
    "there are heavy mesons circulating in the loops shown in figs . 2 - 4 and",
    "one might be tempted to argue that other states should also be included .",
    "we do have , for example , fermion - antifermion components such as @xmath19 or @xmath20 in the loops .",
    "an incoming positive pion can split into a @xmath21 plus a @xmath22 , and so on .",
    "however , in a different context @xcite , it has been shown that this kind of splitting is suppressed with respect to the pion @xmath23 meson - meson splitting , by one order of magnitude .",
    "the neglect of this kind of contribution seems therefore justified .",
    "the same holds for the possibility of strangeness circulating in the loop , associated with virtual states such as @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 . using only @xmath28 s , @xmath14 s , @xmath2 s and @xmath29 s we cover the low and high @xmath1 regions of the form factor .",
    "thus it is enough to our purposes to work with a simple effective theory , involving only @xmath28 s , @xmath14 s , @xmath2 s and @xmath29 s that , as has been discussed elsewhere , @xcite , has proven to be phenomenologically successful .",
    "the same happens in this work .",
    "the diagrams considered in this calculation have been divided into three classes .",
    "the first one , represented in fig .",
    "2 , involves only triangular loops . the processes in fig .",
    "3 , on the other hand , contain bubble - type loops and four - leg vertices associated with the gauge structure of @xmath14 interactions .",
    "finally , diagrams given in fig . 4 involve bubble loops as well as single - particle propagators .",
    "this last feature might suggest that these interactions should be considered as mass corrections . however , the nature of the effective interactions described below is such that , in some terms , the poles of the single - particle states are cancelled .",
    "these terms do correspond to proper three - point functions and are kept in the evaluation of the form factor .",
    "pole cancellations are indicated by crosses in fig .",
    "we adopt an effective lagrangian constrained by @xmath30 flavor and chiral symmetries , as well as gauge invariance .",
    "the @xmath31 interaction is given by@xcite    _ d d^ * = i _ d d^*_a d_^ * - _ ^ * _ a d ^_a .",
    "[ 1 ]    where @xmath32 are the pauli matrices , @xmath33 denotes the pion isospin triplet , while @xmath34 and @xmath35 represent the pseudoscalar and vector charm meson doublets , respectively .",
    "the _ hat _ on top of the coupling constant indicates its bare nature .",
    "the @xmath36 couplings are assumed to be universal and are implemented by covariant derivatives of the form    ^= ^- i _",
    "^ , [ 2 ]    where @xmath37 is the universal coupling constant and @xmath38 is the isospin matrix suited to the field @xmath39 it is acting upon . in this work",

    "the @xmath40 vertex function @xmath41 for an off - shell @xmath2 is written as    ^a_(p^2 ) = - ^a q_g(p^2 ) , [ 3.1 ]    where @xmath42 is a form factor , such that the physical coupling constant is @xmath43 .",
    "we consider two kinds of loop corrections to this vertex , containing pion and rho intermediate states , denoted respectively by @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the perturbative evaluation of these functions gives rise to divergent integrals and @xmath42 can be determined only up to yet unknown renormalization constants .",
    "the use of standard loop integration techniques , such as dimensional regularization and @xmath46 subtraction of divergences , for all diagrams , allows one to write the form factor as    g(p^2 ) = k+ c_f _ ( p^2 ) + c_f_(p^2 ) , [ gfinal ]    where @xmath26 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 are constants .",

    "it is worth stressing that , apart from the approximations described in the introduction , our procedure has no new source of errors .",
    "we have developed a new method of improving qcdsr calculations of hadronic form factors , which consists in matching qcdsr results , valid mainly in the deep euclidean region , to meson loop calculations , valid when the @xmath2 is not too off - shell .",
    "this matching is well justified from the physical point of view , since in the intermediate and large @xmath1 regions the relevant degrees of freedom are the quarks and gluons , with non - perturbative corrections taken into account through the qcd condensates .",
    "the opposite happens for low values of @xmath1 , where sum rules calculations become non - reliable due to the lack of a large mass scale . at this point ,",
    "the meson exchange dynamics becomes the most reliable tool , but it depends on unknown constants associated with the renormalization of the mesonic vertices .",
    "although the exact frontier between meson dynamics and qcdsr can not be precisely known , the success of the method in the instances considered here supports the view that the matching may become useful in increasing the predictive power of both procedures .",
