    "multi - component quantum hall systems have exhibited a collection of interesting phenomena which are the manifestation of electronic correlations @xcite .",
    "such correlations become particularly prominent when two or more sets of landau levels ( lls ) with different layer , subband , valley , spin , or landau level indices are brought into degeneracy @xcite . in experimental systems , different lls can be tuned to cross by varying gate voltage , charge density , magnetic field or the magnetic field tilted angle to the sample .",
    "one of the attractions is the formation of quantum hall ferromagnets ( qhfs ) due to the exchange interactions of the two subbands states , termed as pseudospins @xcite .",
    "self - consistent local density approximation ( sclda ) and hartree - fock mean field method can be performed on the calculation of ground state energy and quasi - particle energy gap @xcite .",
    "recent experiments in single quantum well with two - subband occupied systems @xcite , showed evidence of qhfs when two lls were brought into degeneracy .",
    "the qhfs can either be easy - axis or easy - plane , depending on the details of ll crossing configurations @xcite . in this paper",
    "we follow the theoretical framework of jungwirth and macdonald @xcite and numerically calculate the pseudospin anisotropy energy using the sample parameters in the experiment of zhang _ et al .",
    "the result confirms the qhfs taking place at total filling factor @xmath2 and @xmath3 are expected to be easy - plane and easy - axis qhfs , respectively .",
    "as we will discuss in this paper , the gate bias voltage , which affects the spatial distributions of the wave functions of the two subbands , plays a leading role in the formation of easy - plane and easy - axis qhfs .",
    "the pseudospin representation is used to describe the valence lls degenerated in the fermi level @xcite . following the theoretic studies of pseudospin qhfs @xcite ,",
    "here we focus on a two - subband two dimensional electron system , in which the lls are labeled by @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is first / second subband ( in the no biased quantum well , also called symmetry / antisymmetry subband ) index , @xmath6 is landau level in - plane orbit radius quantum number , and @xmath7 represents real spin .",
    "when two lls are brought close to degeneracy but still sufficiently far from other lls , one of them can be labeled as pseudospin up ( @xmath8 ) and the other as pseudospin down ( @xmath9 ) . in the experimental work of zhang _",
    "@xcite , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : landau ] , we can label pseudospin up ( @xmath8 ) as @xmath10 and pseudospin down ( @xmath9 ) as @xmath11 at filling factor @xmath12 . at filling factor @xmath3",
    ", we label pseudospin up ( @xmath8 ) as @xmath13 and pseudospin down ( @xmath9 ) as @xmath14 . here the upper and lower signs before spin index refer to the crossing point at lower and higher magnetic field , respectively .",
    "are crossing to each other during the increasing of the magnetic field ( see text for details ) .",
    "three arrows point out the crossing point of landau levels at filling factor @xmath15 and @xmath16 . ]    at this moment , we would emphasize the essential similarity between two - subband system and ordinary bilayer system ( double quantum well ) . on one hand , due to a separation of charges to opposite sides of the well originating from the coulomb repulsion , a wide single quantum well can be modeled as an effective bilayer system wescheider , macdonald2000,abolfath .",
    "therefore in a single quantum well two - subband structure , the states of electrons can be characterized by two parameters similar to a bilayer system : the tunneling gap @xmath17 and effective layer separation @xmath18 .",
    "the @xmath17 is chosen as equal to the difference between the lowest two subband energy levels and @xmath18 is given by the distance between two centers of the charge distribution in this single quantum well .",
    "on the other hand , let us assume the two dimensional electron gas is in the @xmath19 plane in the following calculation and discussion , so the sample growth direction is aligned with the @xmath20 axis . in a no biased bilayer system , although the layer wave function in @xmath20 direction is spatially separated in two layers , once included in the effect of tunneling between two layers @xmath21 and rediagonalized the @xmath20 direction hamiltonian , it will be just like the two - subband system which has symmetry and antisymmetry subbands . and the symmetry - antisymmetry gap @xmath22 is equal to the inter - layer tunneling @xmath21 . even when a bias voltage between two layers exists , the circumstance is more or less the same .",
    "since they are theoretically identical , all the pseudospin language theory used in bilayer system is available in the two - subband system .",
    "while pseudospin up and pseudospin down lls are degenerate but the number of electrons is not enough to fill all the two lls , electrons will stay in a broken - symmetry ground state .",
    "actually , the state electrons choosing is a linear combination of two pseudospin lls which minimizes the system total energy .",
    "typically , the many - body ground state can be written as follows macdonald2000 : @xmath23 where @xmath24 creates the single - particle state oriented in a certain unit vector @xmath25 with wave function : @xmath26 here @xmath27 is the single - particle state wave function which contains growth direction subband wave function @xmath28 and in - plane ll wave function @xmath29 : @xmath30    then the hartree - fock energy of the system can be obtained as following macdonald2000 : @xmath31|h|\\psi \\lbrack \\hat{m}]\\rangle } { n_{\\phi } } = -\\sum_{i = x , y , z}\\left ( e_{i}-\\frac{1}{2}u_{% \\mathbf{1},i}-\\frac{1}{2}u_{i,\\mathbf{1}}\\right ) m_{i}+\\frac{1}{2}% \\sum_{i , j = x , y , z}u_{i , j}m_{i}m_{j}.   \\label{eq : hf_energy}\\]]whether the ground state is easy - axis or easy - plane only depends on the quadratic coefficient in pseudospin magnetization @xmath32 ( i.e. the pseudospin anisotropy energy @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 ): @xmath36the first @xmath37 term in eq .",

[ fig : v3_phase ] ) and @xmath60 ( fig .  [ fig : v4_phase ] ) . in the following discussion , in order to make consistency , we choose @xmath67 ( @xmath68 ) as the unit of energy . in the phase diagram ( fig .",

    "[ fig : phase ] , we find that the anisotropy energy difference @xmath64 is very sensitive to the bias voltage @xmath65 .",

    "so the fig .",
    "[ fig : energy ] is applicable to both filling factor @xmath59 and @xmath60 only if in the @xmath60 situation the @xmath80 term is set to a constant zero .",
    "the reason for the different behavior of @xmath33 at filling factor @xmath59 and @xmath60 will be discussed in the following .",
    "note that the dominated term in @xmath64 is the hartree term @xmath76 , which is due to the electrostatic potential of electrons .",
    "it shows that the @xmath76 term increases immediately with the increasing bias voltage @xmath65 .     as a function of bias gate voltage @xmath49 at the density of @xmath81 .",
    "three insets show the well profiles ( black dashed lines ) with first ( blue solid lines ) and second ( red dash - dot lines ) subbands wave functions at different bias voltage : @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 . ]    to examine what the role the bias voltage plays in the determination of easy - plane or easy - axis qhf , we give some sclda results in the fig .",
    "fig : d_vg .",
    "we define an effective subband separation @xmath85 to describe the distance between the cores of first and second subbands wave functions .",
    "the @xmath86 as a function of bias voltage is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : d_vg ] , also with some demonstrations of quantum well configurations and subbands wave functions in different bias voltages ( @xmath87 , @xmath88 , and @xmath89 ) . the data in fig .",
    "[ fig : d_vg ] are all selected from the same density @xmath90 as in fig .",
    "[ fig : energy ] .",
    "it is obvious that the bias gate voltage changes the effective separation of two subbands while changing the well potential @xmath91 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : schrodinger ] ) .",
    "the larger the bias voltage is added , the farther the lowest two subbands are separated . since at a well separated @xmath20 direction wave function configuration , all the electrons near the fermi level filling in the same subband , i.e. the same pseudospin level , will raise a larger electrostatic energy , the easy - axis qhf is not favorable .",
    "thus an easy - plane qhf can save more hartree energy in the larger bias voltage situation . on the other hand , when the potential of the quantum well maintains a good symmetry in the small bias voltage limit , electrons can pick up one of the two pseudospin levels to keep the hartree energy minimal and avoid the energetic penalty from inter - subband tunneling as well .    as mentioned before",
    ", the difference of @xmath33 between total filling factor @xmath59 and @xmath60 could be explained in the similar way .",
    "the anisotropy energy @xmath33 or @xmath34 is constituted of hartree part and fock part ( see eq .  ( [ eq : anisotropy_energy ] ) ) . in our numerical calculation , we find that the hartree terms of @xmath33 and @xmath34 are always zero at both @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "and the only non - zero term in @xmath33 or @xmath34 is the fock term @xmath92 at filling factor @xmath59 , which owes to the exchange interaction .",
    "it implies that at filling factor @xmath60 , where pseudospin up @xmath93 and pseudospin down @xmath94 have opposite real spins , the easy - plane anisotropy , in which the electrons stay in both subband equally , would cost much more exchange energy .",
    "but at @xmath59 the pseudospin up @xmath95 and pseudospin down @xmath96 have the same spin .",
    "then there is no such problem need to be considered .",
    "therefore , the easy - axis qhf is more likely to happen at total filling factor @xmath60 than @xmath59 .",
    "on the basis of above discussion , we may summarize as following .",
    "the bias gate voltage added to the sample changes the quantum well profile in the growth direction as well as the spacial separation of the lowest two subbands wave functions . for a larger bias gate voltage ,",
    "the potential of the well is much skewer , so the two subbands wave functions locate in the opposite side of the quantum well ( inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : d_vg ] ) . as a result ,",
    "the hartree energy will arise if all the electrons stay in one narrow subband or pseudospin level .",
    "thus a easy - plane qhf , in which the electrons fill the two pseudospin levels equally , is more energetically favorable at a large bias gate voltage .",
    "in addition , a state with opposite real spins will expend more exchange energy , so the easy - plane qhf is more easily to form at a pseudospin configuration in which the two pseudospin level have the same real spin ( filling factor @xmath2 in this paper ) .",
    "using self - consistent local density approximation method and hartree - fock mean field theory , we calculated wave function in the growth direction and the anisotropy energy in the two - subband quantum hall system .",
    "the data shows great consistent with the observed easy - plane and easy - axis quantum hall ferromagnets at filling factor @xmath2 and @xmath3 in the experiment of zhang _",
    "also , by analyzing the numerical result , we give an easy - to - understand explanation about the anisotropy occuring at these filling factors .",
