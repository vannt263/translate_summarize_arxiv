    "[ fig : diagrams ] with the unitary @xmath54 transition ( hatched circle ) replaced by the wt term ( this loop is sometimes referred to as `` triangle diagram '' in the literature ) .",
    "this parameter - free triangle graph is at order @xmath55 in the coupling and contributes at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) in the chiral expansion of the amplitude , as discussed in sec .",
    "3.2 of ref .",
    "@xcite ( cf . also ref .",
    "@xcite ) . the resulting ratio @xmath4 , shown as the dash - dotted line in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratio ] , is , of course , very different in magnitude from the full result ( dashed line )  replacing the strong , non - perturbative fsi by the tree - level wt term is certainly an oversimplification . note in particular that , since the wt term does not provide direct @xmath30 transitions , the otherwise large contribution from the @xmath9 photon loop is absent in this case . however , apart from the overall magnitude of the @xmath4 ratio , its energy dependence shows the same feature as the full result shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratio ] : in particular the slow fall - off around @xmath56 mev is present , followed by the very steep rise when approaching the @xmath24 threshold and the weak slope above the @xmath24 threshold .",
    "thus , on one hand a strong hadronic fsi interaction is needed to quantitatively explain the @xmath2 and @xmath3 cross sections in this non - perturbative energy region . on the other hand ,",
    "the pronounced resonance - like enhancement of @xmath2 compared to @xmath3 , at @xmath44 gev , is already present when considering the triangle diagram at nlo in the chiral expansion .",
    "note that this very triangle diagram ( with @xmath40 intermediate state ) is also quantitatively responsible for the pronounced energy dependence of the cusp structure in near - threshold @xmath57 photoproduction  @xcite  @xcite . ] .",
    "for the quasi - free processes",
    ". solid line : full result , same as in fig .",

    "[ fig : diagrams].,scaledwidth=46.0% ]    as discussed in the previous section , the final state interaction ( fsi ) from the unitarized @xmath51 transition is needed for a quantitative description of the results .",
    "this fsi is strong and non - linear and thus it is difficult to fully disentangle the individual contributions . in particular , thresholds are present not only in the photon loops but also in the @xmath51 amplitude , and for specific reaction channels , those thresholds may or may not appear pronounced .",
    "still , the sensitivity of the results to changes of the model can be tested , which is done in the following .    to start with , apart from the photon couplings to intermediate states discussed in the previous section , the current model  @xcite contains explicit isospin breaking from the different bare couplings @xmath60 and @xmath61 . to make sure these free parameters do not mock up the different cross sections in @xmath0 photoproduction on @xmath26 and @xmath27",
    ", we have removed all contributions from the two genuine resonances , i.e. the bare photon and strong couplings @xmath47 and @xmath62 have been set to zero .",
    "the result is shown as the dotted line in fig .",
    "[ fig : discussion ] .",
    "the energy dependence of @xmath4 is barely changed but its magnitude is shifted downwards .",
    "this is not unexpected , because one of the genuine resonances has its pole far in the complex plane and provides an almost energy independent background  @xcite .",
    "thus , removing this contribution results in the observed , almost energy independent shift of @xmath4 downwards .",
    "second , this exercise tells us that the peak in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratio ] does not primarily come from the @xmath7 contribution .",
    "we emphasize that this does not mean the @xmath7 plays no role in the current solution ; a closer inspection of the @xmath2 cross section shows a `` rounded cusp ''  @xcite at the @xmath24 threshold , which can be a signal for a bound state with respect to the @xmath24 channel . here",
    ", this would be the @xmath7 resonance .",
    "indeed , one needs this resonance for a quantitative description of the data shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : deueta ] and [ fig : ratio ] ( and for the other reactions discussed below ) .",
    "one can extract the resonance contributions to the amplitude in various ways . as argued in ref .",
    "@xcite , the most reliable and model independent procedure is the determination of pole positions and residues @xmath63 .",
    "we have performed this analysis for @xmath0 photoproduction on @xmath26 and @xmath27 using the current result . while the parameter set of the current solution is quite similar to that of ref .",
    "@xcite , the pole position of the @xmath25 has changed from @xmath64 mev to @xmath65 mev . for the analysis of the photoproduction amplitude , also the photon loop from fig .",
    "[ fig : diagrams](a ) has been analytically continued to the complex plane . however , it turns out that at the energies of interest of @xmath1 gev , higher order terms in the laurent expansion are important and the contributions from the resonance residues can not saturate the amplitudes on @xmath26 and @xmath27 ( although the energy dependence is matched quite well ) .",
    "this is a sign that resonances alone can not explain the observed cross sections .",
    "this is in agreement with the finding mentioned above , where the genuine resonances have been removed and the peak position and size of @xmath4 have persisted .    also , even if one evaluates @xmath4 using the original model from ref .",
    "@xcite , one still obtains a qualitatively similar result to that of the present study , although @xmath2 and @xmath3 are not well described individually at @xmath66 gev .",
    "the peak in @xmath4 is shifted , however , to somewhat lower energies of around @xmath34 mev .",
    "note also that in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath4 rises as a function of @xmath67 as can be seen in fig .",
    "13 of ref .",
    "although the position of the sharp rise in @xmath4 can vary in different models , it seems to be a rather stable feature of various calculations within the chiral unitary framework .",
    "we have assumed that the total cross sections on @xmath26 and @xmath27 are dominated by the @xmath5-wave , the only partial wave included in this study . for the reaction @xmath6 , the different partial wave analyses from ref .",
    "@xcite indicate that about 80 % of the cross section arises from the @xmath5 wave in the energy region of @xmath68 to @xmath69 gev . for the cross section on the proton ,",
    "the situation is similar  @xcite .",
    "thus , there is some but moderate change from higher partial waves , but assuming their energy dependence is smooth , those changes could be compensated by a refit of the current model , once these higher partial waves are taken into account .",
    "another question concerns the role of additional channels not included in the present model . we can estimate the influence of the @xmath59 channel by including it as in refs .",
    ". it should be stressed , however , that the @xmath59 channel introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite was fitted to @xmath59 data only up to the @xmath25 resonance energy .",
    "still , it gives a rough idea on how much this additional channel might alter the various pion- and photon - induced reactions described by the present model .",
    "the cross section in @xmath29 increases at the position of the @xmath25 , once the @xmath59 channel is included .",
    "in fact , it then matches the data at the @xmath25 position , both for free and quasi - free protons .",
    "the ratio @xmath4 including the @xmath59 channel is shown as the dash - dotted line in fig .",
    "[ fig : discussion ] ; the influence of the @xmath59 channel is small for the ratio .",
    "so far , we have not considered the @xmath37 coupling to the baryon component in the loop contribution as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : diagrams](b ) .",
    "although this process contributes little because it is subleading in the @xmath70 expansion  @xcite , it could significantly alter the ratio @xmath4 , because the photon can couple to additional intermediate states like @xmath71 .",
    "however , the result for @xmath3 and @xmath2 does not change much with these higher order effects .",
    "the resulting ratio @xmath4 is shown as the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : discussion ] .",
    "there are other higher order effects like magnetic couplings or the @xmath72 transition magnetic moment , all of them discussed in ref .",
    "we expect moderate modifications of the results from these sources , but no qualitative changes , because they are small and partly cancel each other  @xcite .",
    "the consistency of the present model with the two independent multipoles @xmath73 and @xmath74 in @xmath75 photoproduction should be ensured in analogy with @xmath0 photoproduction on @xmath27 and @xmath26 .",
    "the result of the present study is very similar to that shown in ref .",
    "@xcite and the multipoles @xcite are well reproduced in the considered energy range of @xmath76 to @xmath77 mev .",
    "in particular , the phase of the @xmath25 is consistent with the analyses of refs .",
    "@xcite . note that the @xmath17 threshold appears quite different in @xmath73 and @xmath74 ( cf .",
    "13 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) . just like in the present study of the @xmath15 and @xmath71 final states ,",
    "it is the distinct photo - excitation of intermediate states that renders these two pion - multipoles so different .    as for the other reaction channels evaluated within the present model",
    ", we mention that a pronounced @xmath24 threshold effect is observed in the @xmath23 photoproduction on the proton .",
    "this is in contrast to the case of @xmath0 photoproduction , where this effect appears pronounced on neutron but not on proton ( cf .",
    "[ fig : vaceta ] ) . whether or not a threshold will appear pronounced depends on the specific reaction channel , due to the non - linearity of the amplitude .",
    "we have also evaluated the other @xmath5-wave cross sections for the family of reactions @xmath78 and compared to the corresponding data .",
    "while there is a qualitative overall agreement for most of these reactions , for some reactions the results are sensitive to the @xmath59 channel , which is not fully consistently included in the present model .",
    "this is beyond the scope of the present study because an inclusion of such channels as done e.g. in refs .",
    "@xcite is difficult and requires the simultaneous study of all partial waves , beyond the @xmath5 wave as considered in this study .",
    "the excess of @xmath0 photoproduction on the neutron at photon energies around @xmath79 gev ( @xmath1 gev ) , compared to the proton case , has been studied within a unitary coupled channel model that includes the su(3 ) allowed meson - baryon channels @xmath9 , @xmath17 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 . the photon couples to this hadronic system respecting gauge invariance as dictated by the ward - takahashi identity and unitarity .",
    "the experimentally determined @xmath0 photoproduction cross sections on quasi - free neutron and proton can be explained quantitatively within the present model which accounts for the @xmath5 wave contribution only .",
    "the intermediate @xmath24 and @xmath23 loop contributions to the @xmath80 and @xmath81 processes have been identified as the primary source of the difference in the observed energy dependence in these two reactions which , in turn , leads to the occurrence of a relatively sharp spike - like structure in the corresponding cross section ratio @xmath4 .",
    "we emphasize that this is a direct consequence of the underlying hadron dynamics which , in the present model , is driven by the weinberg - tomozawa contact interaction with a relatively strong coupling to the @xmath23 and @xmath24 channels through the su(3 ) structure .    the appearance of the spike - like structure in @xmath4 is a stable feature resistant to various tests of the model , such as the removal of the genuine resonance states , the inclusion of the higher - order baryon pole term in the loop contribution ( cf . fig .  [",
    "fig : diagrams ] ) , or the inclusion of the @xmath59 channel .",
    "also , this spike - like structure is already present at nlo in the chiral expansion , where the triangle graph with the weinberg - tomozawa term contributes .    in summary ,",
    "while the present study does not rule out other explanations of the peak in @xmath4 , such as narrow resonances , it shows the stability of the result of our model , the consistency with other reactions , and delivers a simple and quantitative explanation .    * acknowledgements : * this work is supported by dfg + ( deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft , gz : do 1302/1 - 1 ) and the cosy ffe grant no .",
