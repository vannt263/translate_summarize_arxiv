    "bosonization , a concept which sounds quite mysterious , is in fact both easy to understand and ubiquitous . in this review",
    "we outline an approach via bosonization to the problem of many interacting fermions in spatial dimensions greater than one . as the virtue of multidimensional bosonization lies in the reduction of complicated four - fermion interactions to a gaussian problem",
    ", we stress the simplicity of the approach .",
    "multidimensional bosonization is more delicate than bosonization in one dimension . in particular",
    "the technique is not useful for certain strongly correlated systems , specifically those in which the fermi surface is obliterated by singular or unscreened interactions , as it relies heavily on the existence of an abrupt change in the quasiparticle occupancy near the fermi wavevector .",
    "it is also difficult to implement systematic perturbative expansions using bosonization . in these instances , it is more useful to work with the original fermionic variables",
    ". nevertheless bosonization provides a straightforward approach to many interesting problems and we begin this review with a brief introduction to the method in its several forms .    historically bosonization has been associated closely with the quantum physics of particles moving in one spatial dimension or with statistical mechanics in two dimensions .",
    "( for up - to - date reviews of one - dimensional bosonization , which contain material not covered here , see the articles by schulz@xcite , voit@xcite , and von delft and schoeller@xcite . ) but any fermion system which exhibits collective excitations has some sort of bosonic description .",
    "spin waves in a ferromagnet , plasmons in a metal , and superconducting order are well known examples . in these instances , some if not all of the low energy degrees of freedom have a bosonic description .",
    "we focus here on cases when _ all _ of the low - energy fermion degrees of freedom may be replaced by bosons .",
    "mathematically the replacement can be carried out , at least formally , by means of a hubbard - stratonovich transformation@xcite : auxiliary bosons are coupled to the fermion degrees of freedom , and then the fermions are integrated out yielding a purely bosonic effective theory . in practice , however , the transformation is useful only if there are additional constraints .",
    "the following two examples illustrate the power of bosonization when the fermions are subject to constraints in the form of infinite symmetries .",
    "consider first the problem of representing a spin-1/2 degree of freedom in terms of the underlying fermions .",
    "the angular momentum algebra is reproduced faithfully if we introduce fermion creation and annihilation operators @xmath2 and @xmath3 which obey the canonical anticommutation relations @xmath4",
    ". then we may write : @xmath5 subject to the constraint @xmath6 here an implicit summation over repeated raised and lower greek spin indices is assumed . more generally , to describe a quantum magnet for instance , we attach a site index @xmath7 to the operators : @xmath8 if , for example , we consider now the nearest - neighbor heisenberg magnet @xmath9 it is clear that its representation in terms of the underlying fermions is not as economical as its representation in terms of the spins themselves , since the spin operators of equation [ fermi - spin ] , and hence the hamiltonian equation [ haf ] , are invariant under @xmath10 gauge transformations at each lattice point@xcite : @xmath11 because the local phase rotation @xmath12 cancels out .",
    "we denote this infinite gauge symmetry @xmath13 .",
    "the physical meaning of this local symmetry is simply that the charge degrees of freedom are frozen out and play no role in the insulating magnet .",
    "the underlying fermions have both charge and spin degrees of freedom , but as the number of fermions on each site is fixed to be one , only the spin degree of freedom is active .",
    "spin operators @xmath14 and @xmath15 create particle - hole excitations , localized on a single site @xmath7 .",
    "that is , @xmath14 creates a spin-@xmath16 fermion and destroys a spin-@xmath17 fermion at site @xmath7 .",
    "these local particle - hole excitations , taken together , have a bosonic character , as two fermions bound together obey boson statistics . as the charge degree of freedom",
    "is frozen in place , the remaining spin degree of freedom can be represented instead in terms of bosons which obey the usual canonical commutation relations @xmath18",
    "= \\delta_\\alpha^\\beta$ ] .",
    "now it is permissible to write : @xmath19 these spins obey precisely the same algebra , and if we now constrain the number of bosons to be one per site , @xmath20 the operators are spin-@xmath21 .",
    "note that such a replacement of fermions with bosons ",
    "our first concrete example of bosonization  would not have been permissible for a model which contains both charge and spin degrees of freedom , such as the hubbard model .",
    "for instance , in the non - interacting @xmath22 limit , the hubbard model reduces to the tight - binding model @xmath23 which is clearly not invariant under the @xmath13 transformations , equation [ xu(1 ) ] .",
    "distinct @xmath10 rotation angles at neighboring sites , @xmath24 and @xmath25 do not cancel in general . physically this means that the full fermi character of the electrons is manifested , as they propagate from lattice site to lattice site .",
    "of course the ground state in the @xmath22 limit is a degenerate fermi liquid . for @xmath26 at half - filling , and for a bipartite lattice , on the other hand , the charge degrees of freedom are frozen out .",
    "then the low energy effective theory of the resulting antiferromagnetic insulator does exhibit the @xmath13 symmetry .    at this point",
    "it might be asked what _",
    "practical _ benefit can be gained by the replacement of the fermions with bosons .",
    "our model provides a nice illustration : with bosons , semiclassical approximations may be contemplated . in the case of the antiferromagnet with @xmath27 , for instance , an expansion in powers of @xmath28 about the limit of large on - site",
    "spin s is now possible @xcite , as the on - site spin can be increased simply by populating more bosons at each site : @xmath29 .",
    "( in the fermion representation this can only be done by attaching an additional orbital index to the fermions , and then enforcing hund s rule to align the fermions into a maximal spin state . ) in particular , the nel ordered state of the unfrustrated antiferromagnet on a square lattice can be accessed in this way even at the mean - field level .",
    "in contrast mean - field theories with fermions are disordered@xcite .",
    "there is another system which possesses infinite @xmath10 symmetry and which can be bosonized easily : the free , degenerate , fermi gas or liquid@xcite .",
    "we begin with the usual hamiltonian : @xmath30 the hamiltonian is invariant under an infinity of @xmath10 rotations , but now at each point in momentum space , rather than position space : @xmath31 this @xmath32 symmetry , like the @xmath13 symmetry explored above , has a clear physical interpretation : in the absence of interactions and disorder , momentum is a good quantum number for the single - particle states , as these are infinitely long - lived .",
    "thus we may make the identification : @xmath33    again the particle - hole pairs can be bosonized , and this bosonization furnishes us with another example of how some properties can be seen more clearly in the bosonic basis .",
    "recall the classic calculation of the specific heat at constant volume @xmath34 , @xmath35 , of a degenerate fermi liquid@xcite .",
    "two integrals , each a function of the temperature @xmath36 and the chemical potential @xmath37 , must be computed : the total energy of the system @xmath38 and the total number of fermions @xmath39 . to extract @xmath35",
    ", the chemical potential must be determined first , as it depends on temperature . taking this variation into account ,",
    "the correct answer at low temperatures is : @xmath40 here @xmath41 is the density of states per unit volume at the fermi surface",
    ". the same result may be recovered more readily by simply treating the particle - hole excitations as free bosons . more readily , because there is no chemical potential for the bosons as they are not conserved in number , but rather vanish in the zero - temperature limit .",
    "now the total energy of a system of free bosons with single - particle energies @xmath42 is given by : @xmath43 and therefore @xmath44    to apply this formula we need a sensible interpretation of @xmath42 .",
    "as we are interested in the low - temperature properties , we first linearize the spectrum of particle - hole excitations : @xmath45 where the second line holds in the limit @xmath46 .",
    "this restriction means that we are considering only particle - hole excitations where particle and hole have nearly the same momentum .",
    "we show below that this constraint , which is unphysical , can in fact be discarded . at low temperatures the particle - hole pairs lie near the fermi surface , and we may set @xmath47 , the fermi momentum",
    ". then the dispersion reads @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the component of the momentum parallel to the fermi wavevector @xmath50 at the fermi surface , @xmath51 .",
    "of particular significance is the fact that the energy of a pair has this simple form when @xmath52 , not depending on @xmath50 , but rather only on the relative momentum @xmath49 .",
    "the energy of a particle - hole pair , like that of a single free particle , is determined uniquely by a single momentum . substituting the dispersion into the specific heat formula , equation [ c_v ]",
    ", we obtain : @xmath53 upon making a change of variables , and using the fact that @xmath54 the exact result , equation [ freec_v ] , is recovered with the correct prefactor@xcite .",
    "why is it permissible to restrict @xmath52 ? at any non - zero temperature there are a macroscopic number of particle - hole excitations , some with large @xmath55 and some with small @xmath55 .",
    "however , in the vicinity of any point on the fermi surface there are statistically equal numbers of particles and holes . whether or not these particles and holes originate from small or large momentum scattering processes , they have the same statistical mechanical description , and they can always be re - assigned to small-@xmath55 pairs which are described accurately by the above bosonic calculation .    with this introduction to multidimensional bosonization",
    ", we turn now to a brief history of efforts to use bosonization to describe interacting fermion liquids . for more than forty years",
    "landau fermi liquid theory provided the framework to discuss the physics of strongly interacting fermion systems@xcite . in the phenomenological theory the coupling between electrons",
    "is given in terms of a few parameters which are determined by comparison with experiment@xcite .",
    "landau fermi liquid theory , focusing on the collective excitations of the fermi surface , is a type of bosonization .",
    "zero sound modes , ordinary sound , and paramagnetic spin waves all have a bosonic character , despite their origin in terms of fermions .    a microscopic interpretation of the landau theory was provided in the late 1950 s and early 1960 s via many body perturbation theory@xcite .",
    "although the main idea behind fermi liquid theory is deceptively simple , the concept of a quasiparticle , its realization in the microscopic theory is far from straightforward .",
    "qualitatively when an electron interacts with all of the other electrons it polarizes its immediate vicinity due to the electron - electron repulsion , and this complex entity is the landau quasiparticle . in this picture",
    "the interaction between electrons does not affect the quantum numbers of the electron , only its dynamics .",
    "for example the effective mass @xmath56 of the quasiparticle generally differs from the bare mass of the electron . in the microscopic approach",
    ", the existence of the quasiparticle can be ascertained by identifying a simple pole in the single - particle green s function . at zero temperature",
    "this pole yields a @xmath57-function peak in the single - particle spectral function at the fermi surface . in the non - interacting case",
    "all of the weight is in this peak and there is no incoherent contribution to the spectral function . for free electrons",
    "the single - particle occupancy @xmath58 has a discontinuity of magnitude @xmath59 at @xmath47 .",
    "when interactions are turned on , according to the landau hypothesis , the discontinuity remains , but is reduced in magnitude to @xmath60 , as shown in figure [ discontinuity ] with the remaining spectral weight appearing as incoherent background .",
    "= 10.0 cm    this idea is made explicit by considering a power - series expansion of the self - energy of the quasiparticle about the low - energy limit : @xmath61 in the absence of singular interactions , pauli blocking constrains the phase space for scattering , as shown in figure [ phase_space ] .",
    "= 10.0 cm    the scattering rate vanishes as @xmath62 in the low - energy limit@xcite , and thus the @xmath32 symmetry is recovered in this limit ( see below ) .",
    "the mapping of the bare fermions @xmath63 onto the landau quasiparticles @xmath64 may also be made explicit by writing : @xmath65 where in terms of the self - energy , equation [ self ] , we have @xmath66 and @xmath67 . with this renormalization ,",
    "the single - particle occupancy of the quasiparticles , @xmath68 , like that of free fermions , has a unit step at the fermi surface .",
    "according to luttinger s theorem@xcite , the discontinuity in the occupancy encloses the same volume in momentum space . in the special case of the isotropic fermi gas with a spherical fermi surface , the surface remains fixed at exactly the same position .",
    "the existence of landau quasiparticles implies the existence of a fermi surface , but the reverse does not necessarily hold .",
    "in one spatial dimension it is well known that the landau picture breaks down , perturbation theory diverges , and the quasiparticle is destroyed by the interactions . in this case a different paradigm , the `` luttinger liquid , '' ( the term having been introduced in 1981 by haldane@xcite ) describes a wide range of interacting fermion systems .",
    "the foundation for this picture was provided in early work by tomonaga@xcite who showed how to bosonize a one - dimensional interacting fermion system with a band cutoff .",
    "the foundations of one - dimensional bosonization were further developed by luther and peschel@xcite , coleman@xcite , and mandelstam@xcite .",
    "mattis and lieb@xcite showed that a model of interacting fermions proposed by luttinger@xcite ( a model which allowed only forward scattering and in which the cutoff was taken to infinity ) could be solved exactly .",
    "this solution demonstrated explicitly that the low energy degrees of freedom of the interacting one - dimensional electron gas are collective modes of charge density and spin density .",
    "nonetheless a fermi surface survives in the sense that the single - particle occupancy is non - analytic at exactly the same locations in momentum space as the free fermi gas , @xmath69 where the exponent @xmath70 depends on the interaction strength@xcite .",
    "the luttinger liquid fixed point has @xmath71 symmetry which reflects the conservation of the number of quasiparticles at each of the two fermi points . due to this enhanced symmetry",
    ", the hamiltonian can be expressed in terms of left and right current operators , @xmath72 and @xmath73 , and the bare two - body interaction can be replaced in the low - energy limit by the effective interaction @xmath74 as the current operators obey a simple type of harmonic - oscillator algebra , the problem reduces to that of diagonalizing a gaussian hamiltonian .    in spatial dimension",
    "@xmath75 , haldane pointed out that the @xmath71 symmetry enlarges , in the case of a landau fermi liquid , to the infinite @xmath32 symmetry@xcite .",
    "although the bare interacting fermion hamiltonian has only global @xmath10 symmetry reflecting global conservation of charge , the landau semiclassical energy functional @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the quasiparticle occupancy and @xmath50 and @xmath78 denote momenta on the fermi surface , has the same @xmath32 symmetry as the free system because the energy @xmath79 depends only on the occupancies @xmath58 , each of which separately is invariant under the @xmath32 transformation equation [ ku(1 ) ] .",
    "haldane proposed that a fully quantum mechanical description of the interacting fermion system might be obtained by bosonization , at least in cases where there is a well defined fermi surface . in this viewpoint",
    "the formation of the fermi surface is a zero temperature quantum critical phenomenon , an idea anticipated by anderson in his book _ basic notions of condensed matter physics_@xcite .",
    "of course the bare hamiltonian does not exhibit the enlarged @xmath32 symmetry ; rather only the effective low - energy theory has this symmetry .",
    "symmetry - breaking terms are irrelevant perturbations of the fixed point effective hamiltonian .",
    "indeed , for fermions with short - range interactions , this was shown explicitly in renormalization group ( rg ) calculations in a mathematical - physics style by feldman and trubowitz@xcite and by benfatto and gallavotti@xcite .",
    "shankar s particularly clear exposition of the rg approach to interacting fermions is the one we draw upon most heavily in the following@xcite .    a pioneering attempt to generalize the bosonization approach to spatial dimension greater than one was made by luther@xcite .",
    "luther studied free fermions in general dimension by bosonizing the fermion fields at each point on the fermi surface .",
    "the central idea was that the spectrum of the free fermion hamiltonian can be reproduced by the particle hole excited states in the radial direction in momentum space , @xmath80 and therefore it is possible to take the fermions to be one dimensional in each radial direction @xmath50 . in this construction , however , conservation of momentum makes it impossible for particle - hole pairs in different radial sectors to interact .",
    "this is where the subject remained until haldane@xcite showed that coupling between different points of the fermi surface could be incorporated by adopting a different geometry : he coarse grained the degrees of freedom near the fermi surface into patches of finite extent rather than along radial rays .",
    "the approach was developed as a calculational tool by the authors and their collaborators who emphasized the role of the current algebras@xcite .",
    "independently , castro - neto and fradkin used a coherent - state formalism which emphasized fluctuations in the geometry of the fermi surface to derive similar results@xcite .",
    "a program to include systematically corrections to the gaussian bosonic fixed point has been initiated by frhlich , gtschmann , and marchetti@xcite and also by kopietz and co - workers@xcite .",
    "one of the goals of this approach , which employs a hubbard - stratonovich transformation to replace the fermions with bosons , is to include non - linear terms in the fermion dispersion , as these terms are especially important in gauge theories of interacting fermions .",
    "see also work by khveshchenko@xcite .",
    "some of these later developments are summarized in a review article by metzner , castellani and dicastro@xcite who discuss the close connection between multidimensional bosonization and the ward identity approach@xcite .",
    "it has been demonstrated how the main results of fermi liquid theory can be recovered within this multidimensional bosonization approach@xcite . furthermore , the stability of the fermi liquid fixed point can be tested@xcite .",
    "more important , bosonization provides a non - perturbative approach to the study of non - fermi liquid fixed points that arise for example in the study of single layer quantum hall fluids at even - denominator fillings @xmath81 , and which may possibly be relevant in the cuprate superconductors , as we discuss below in section [ nest ] . in this instance , bosonization is a particularly appropriate tool , as within limitations described below it does not presuppose a fermi liquid form for the quasiparticle propagator , and therefore non - trivial zero - temperature fixed points can be accessed .",
    "the outline of the rest of our review is as follows . in section [ essentials ]",
    "we introduce the essentials of multidimensional bosonization . in section [ stability ]",

    "the difficult problem of calculating the fermion propagator is addressed in section [ propagator ] .",
    "two - particle properties such as the linear response to external density perturbations are examined in section [ two_particle ] .",
    "although bosonization is limited to a description of low energy phenomena , high momentum processes are contained accurately .",
    "in particular , we show that the kohn anomaly at wavevector @xmath82 is recovered within bosonization . in section [ hfll ]",

    "field operators @xmath84 and @xmath85 create and destroy these quasiparticles and are related to the bare fermion operators by @xmath86 for momenta @xmath87 which are restricted to a narrow shell of thickness @xmath88 around the fermi surface @xmath89 depicted in figure [ shell ] . note that an attempt is not being made to calculate the values of @xmath56 , @xmath90 , or the other effective parameters from first principles ; there is no generally reliable way to do this .",

    "the effective interaction is an instantaneous two - body interaction of the form @xmath101 this is the only marginal interaction as all terms with more operators or derivatives are irrelevant in the usual renormalization group sense@xcite ; retardation may be neglected for the same reason .",
    "the bare hamiltonian , equation [ bare - h ] , is rotationally invariant , and barring spontaneous magnetization we can restrict our attention to rotationally invariant effective interactions .",
    "the interaction is heavily constrained by momentum conservation which demands that @xmath102 in two dimensions there are only three possibilities : @xmath103 and @xmath104 ( forward scattering ) ; @xmath105 ( exchange scattering ) ; and @xmath106 ( bcs cooper pair scattering , where the ( - ) sign connotes the antipodal point ) .",

    "the fermi surface is now discretized , tiled into squat boxes with aspect ratio @xmath162 , where @xmath521 is the length of the box along the surface . in each squat box , currents defined in terms of the fermionic quasiparticles also have an equivalent representation in terms of bosonic fields .",
    "when it is legitimate to linearize the quasiparticle spectrum about the fermi momentum by dropping the non - linear terms , the complicated many - body interactions reduce to a quadratic form in the boson fields which possesses the large @xmath32 symmetry , assuming that there is no bcs instability .",

    "in one spatial dimension , well - known exact results are recovered .",
    "the ground state is generically a luttinger liquid , and the low - lying excitations are collective modes of charge and spin which propagate at different velocities . in higher dimension the landau fermi liquid",
    "is realized when fermions interact via a longitudinal interaction of either short - range , or of the usual coulomb form .",
    "unphysically longer ranged interactions , however , can destroy the landau quasiparticles .",
    "all of the important results of fermi liquid theory can be recovered within bosonization , the nonanalytic @xmath286 contribution to the specific heat in three dimensions , the equations of motion of charge and spin collective modes , as well as screening and quasiparticle damping in two and three dimensions .",
    "both long and short wavelength physics can be described provided the energy is low enough to be within a shell surrounding the fermi surface . for example the density response has the usual rpa form at low wavevectors , and at high wavevectors near @xmath965 the kohn nonanalyticity is found .    the possibility of non - fermi liquid ground states has been raised for systems interacting via transverse gauge fields , as these fields are not screened at low frequencies .",
    "such a scenario has been suggested as the mechanism underlying cuprate superconductivity , but a concrete example is furnished by quantum hall systems in two dimensions , specifically a two - dimensional electron gas in a perpendicular magnetic field such that only the lowest landau level is half - filled . in the widely used chern - simons gauge theory",
    "the physical electrons are mapped by a singular gauge transformation onto composite fermions which each carry two units of statistical flux and interact via a transverse gauge field in addition to the usual longitudinal density - density interaction . at the mean field level",
    "the average flux cancels the external magnetic field and the ground state is a free fermi gas .",
    "the stability of this state against gauge (= charge ) fluctuations was studied by determining the composite quasiparticle propagator .",
    "multidimensional bosonization broke down for longitudinal interactions shorter - ranged than coulomb as the transverse gauge fluctuations , which are moderated by the longitudinal interaction , are too strong in this instance . in the case of the coulomb interaction ,",
    "two important results were found . at equal time and at long distances",
    "the propagator has the form @xmath966 . in the opposite limit of long temporal separation , @xmath967 ,",
    "the leading terms can be fourier transformed and the self - energy extracted , yielding the marginal fermi liquid form , @xmath968 , identical to that found within rpa .",
    "this result has been criticized by several authors and remains controversial .",
    "the basis for the criticism is the linearization of the quasiparticle dispersion , an approximation which is especially useful in bosonization as it leads to a gaussian bosonic action .",
    "because gauge fluctuations carry relatively large transverse momentum , it has been argued that non - linear corrections to the quasiparticle dispersion should be retained , especially in the case of short - range longitudinal interactions .",
    "furthermore , altshuler , ioffe , and millis@xcite argue that , in the case of the coulomb interaction , when the quadratic @xmath969 term is retained the mfl form of the self - energy given above is the leading term , and all other higher - order terms are subleading .",
    "this claim has been criticized by kopietz who points out@xcite that the two - loop self - energy is more divergent than the single - loop self - energy .",
    "kopietz and castilla@xcite attempted to incorporate the @xmath970 term within a bosonized treatment and find that fermi liquid behavior is recovered , even in the case of short - range longitudinal interactions where the gauge fluctuations should be strongest and most disruptive .",
    "the nature of the composite quasiparticle propagator , and whether or not it is even physically meaningful , remains the subject of ongoing research .",
    "different , direct , schemes for bosonization of landau levels have been proposed@xcite , and these may prove useful .",
    "renormalization group methods , when combined with the ward identity approach@xcite are another route being pursued .",
    "a particularly important feature of multidimensional bosonization is that it can be combined with the renormalization group to analyze various instabilities of the fermi liquid , all of which are treated on an equal footing .",
    "bosonization is most useful in this context as the forward - scattering parts of the interaction , those which preserve the @xmath32 symmetry , can be incorporated exactly at the outset as part of the gaussian fixed point . as a simple example we have studied the bcs instability for a circular fermi surface , and",
    "have rederived the rg flow equations found by shankar@xcite in the fermion basis . for a nested fermi surface close to half - filling",

    "the normal state is a marginal fermi liquid , also in qualitative agreement with many experiments@xcite .",
    "bosonization is particularly appropriate here as the forward - scattering channel responsible for the marginal fermi liquid state is incorporated non - perturbatively . unlike other approaches , in multidimensional bosonization feynman diagrams receive rather less emphasis than algebraic and geometric ways of understanding correlated fermions . when combined with the renormalization group , bosonization yields insight into fermion liquids which does not rely on the resummation techniques of microscopic fermi liquid theory@xcite . by unifying the microscopic and landau pictures",
    ", multidimensional bosonization provides a new way to think about correlated fermions .",
    "finally we should mention some outstanding problems which remain unanswered .",
    "first , as we have noted , linearization of the fermion dispersion is a central approximation , crucial to the success of the approach . as pointed out originally by haldane@xcite , nonlinear corrections to the dispersion",
    "can only be included systematically in a perturbative treatment .",
    "when these terms are important , it is not clear how useful bosonization remains . the most important failing of bosonization to date , however , is that it remains unable to account for the intermingling effects of interaction and disorder leading to diffusion and the modification of screening@xcite . to understand the role of disorder it is necessary to confront the effects of interpatch scattering , which breaks the @xmath32 symmetry down to just the usual global @xmath10 charge conservation symmetry .",
    "some progress has been made in the special case of one spatial dimension where the weak - coupling rg equations have been worked out@xcite . in higher dimension , forward",
    "scattering by impurities can be included rather easily@xcite , but this has no effect once the @xmath972 limit is taken , as required if multidimensional bosonization is to be rigorous . in the regime of strong disorder ,",
    "belitz and kirkpatrick have used a hubbard - stratonovich transformation to decouple the fermion interaction along with replicated disorder by introducing bosonic @xmath973-fields@xcite .",
    "they emphasize that the soft , low - energy , modes of disordered systems differ qualitatively from the low - energy degrees of freedom in the clean limit , as they are diffusive rather than ballistic in character .",
    "it remains to be seen whether or not a theory can be constructed which interpolates accurately between the limits of weak and strong disorder .",
