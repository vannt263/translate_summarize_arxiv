    "a data file is stored at a distributed collection of storage devices / nodes in a network .",
    "since any storage device is individually unreliable and subject to failure ( i.e. erasure ) , redundancy must be introduced to provide the much - needed system - level protection against data loss due to device / node failure .",
    "the simplest form of redundancy is _",
    "replication_. by storing @xmath15 identical copies of a file at @xmath15 distributed nodes , one copy per node , a @xmath15-replication system can guarantee the data availability as long as no more than @xmath16 nodes fail .",
    "such systems are very easy to implement , but extremely inefficient in storage space utilization , incurring tremendous waste in devices and equipment , building space , and cost for powering and cooling .",
    "more sophisticated systems employing _ erasure coding _",
    "@xcite can expect to considerably improve the storage efficiency .",
    "consider a file that is divided into @xmath12 equal - size fragments .",
    "a judiciously - designed @xmath17 $ ] erasure ( systematic ) code can be employed to encode the @xmath12 data fragments ( terms _ systematic symbols _ in the coding jargon ) into @xmath11 fragments ( termed _ coded symbols _ ) stored in @xmath11 different nodes . if the @xmath0 $ ] code reaches the singleton bound such that the minimum hamming distance satisfies @xmath18 , then the code is _",
    "maximum distance separable _",
    "( mds ) and offers redundancy - reliability optimality . with an @xmath17 $ ] mds erasure code , the original file can be recovered from any set of @xmath12 encoded fragments , regardless of whether they are systematic or parity .",
    "in other words , the system can tolerate up to @xmath19 concurrent device / node failure without jeopardizing the data availability .    despite the huge potentials of mds erasure codes ,",
    "however , practical application of these codes in massive storage networks have been difficult .",
    "not only are simple ( i.e. requires very little computational complexity ) mds codes very difficult to construct , but data repair would in general require the access of @xmath12 other encoded fragments @xcite , causing considerable input / output ( i / o ) bandwidth that would pose huge challenges to a typical storage network .     is first split into five equal packets @xmath20 and then is encoded into @xmath21 packets , using a @xmath22 linear code .",
    "these @xmath21 encoded packets are stored at @xmath21 nodes @xmath23 , which are divided into three groups @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "each group can perform local repair of up to two node - failures .",
    "for example , if node @xmath27 fails , it can be repaired by any two packets among @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "moreover , the entire file @xmath30 can be recovered by five packets from any five nodes @xmath31 which intersect each group with at most two packets .",
    "for example , @xmath30 can be recovered from five packets stored at @xmath32 and @xmath33 . ]",

    "@xcite introduced the interesting notion of _ symbol locality _ in linear codes .",
    "the @xmath34th coded symbol of an @xmath17 $ ] linear code @xmath35 is said to have locality @xmath36 if it can be recovered by accessing at most @xmath9 other symbols in @xmath37 .",
    "the concept was further generalized to @xmath1 locality by prakash _",
    "@xcite , to address the situation of multiple device failures .",
    "according to @xcite , the @xmath34th code symbol @xmath38 , in an @xmath17 $ ] linear code @xmath37 is said to have locality @xmath1 if there exists an index set @xmath39 $ ] containing @xmath34 such that @xmath40 and each symbol @xmath41 , can be reconstructed by any @xmath42 symbols in @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is an integer .",
    "thus , when @xmath45 , the notion of locality in @xcite reduces to the notion of locality in @xcite .",
    "two cases of @xmath1 codes are introduced in the literature : an @xmath46 code is a systematic linear code whose _",
    "information symbols _ all have locality @xmath1 ; and an @xmath2 code is a linear code all of whose _ symbols _ have locality @xmath1 .",
    "hence , an @xmath2 code is also referred to as having _ all - symbol locality _ @xmath1 , and an @xmath46 code is also referred to as having _ information locality _ @xmath1 . a symbol with @xmath1 locality",
    " given that at the most @xmath47 symbols are erased  can be deduced by reading at most @xmath9 other unerased symbols .",
    "clearly , codes with a low symbol locality , such as @xmath48 , impose a low i / o bandwidth and repair cost in a distributed storage system . in a dss system",
    ", one can use `` group '' to describe storage nodes situated in the same physical location which enjoy a higher communication bandwidth and a shorter communication distance than storage nodes belonging to different groups . in the case of node failure , a _ locally repairable code _ makes it possible to efficiently recover data stored in the failed node by downloading information from nodes in the same group ( or in a minimal number of other groups ) .",
    "[ fig - dss ] provides a simple example of how an @xmath2 code is used to construct a distributed storage system . in this example , @xmath37 is a @xmath22 linear code of length @xmath21 and dimension @xmath49 .",
    "note that a failed node can be reconstructed by accessing only two other existing nodes , while it takes five existing nodes to repair a failed node if a @xmath50 $ ] mds code is used .",
    "locality was identified as a repair cost metric for distributed storage systems independently by oggier _",
    "@xcite , gopalan _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite and papailiopoulos _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite using different terms .",
    "in @xcite , gopalan _ et al .",
    "_ introduced the concept of symbol locality of linear codes and established a tight bound for the redundancy in terms of the message length , the distance , and the locality of information coordinates .",
    "a generalized concept , i.e. , @xmath1 locality , was addressed by prakash _",
    "it was proved in @xcite that the minimum distance @xmath51 of an @xmath46 linear code @xmath37 is upper bounded by @xmath52 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the length and dimension of @xmath37 respectively .",
    "it was also proved that a class of codes known as pyramid codes @xcite achieve this bound . since",
    "an @xmath2 code is also an @xmath46 code , ( [ eqn:1 ] ) also presents an upper bound for the minimum distance of @xmath2 codes .",
    "locality of general codes ( linear or nonlinear ) and bounds on the minimum distance for a given locality were presented in parallel and subsequent works @xcite .",
    "an @xmath2 code ( systematic or not ) is also termed a _ locally repairable code ( lrc ) _ , and @xmath2 codes that achieve the minimum distance bound are called _",
    "optimal_.    it was proved in @xcite that there exists optimal locally repairable linear codes when @xmath53 and @xmath54 . under the condition that @xmath53 , a construction method of optimal locally repairable vector codes was proposed in @xcite , where maximal rank distance ( mrd ) codes were used along with mds array codes .",
    "for the special case of @xmath4 , tamo _ et al . _",
    "@xcite proposed an explicit construction of optimal lrcs when @xmath55 or @xmath56 except for the special case that @xmath57 , no results are known about whether there exists optimal @xmath2 code when @xmath58 .    up to now , designing lrcs with optimal distance",
    "remains an intriguing open problem for most coding parameters @xmath59 and @xmath10 .",
    "since large fields involve rather complicated and expensive computation , a related interesting open problem asks how to limit the design ( of optimal lrcs ) over relatively smaller fields .      in this paper , we investigate the structure properties and the construction of optimal @xmath2 linear codes of length @xmath11 and dimension @xmath12 .",
