    "the interest in hawking radiation from a black hole @xcite is not decreasing .",
    "new derivations of this law , some of them very different from the original one and opening new avenues in quantum physics , have appeared in the last years .",
    "even more interesting , from the experimental ( i.e. , observational ) side results are quickly reaching limits which clearly indicate that some specific properties of black holes will be testable in the near future .",
    "there are a few semiclassical explanations of the origin of the quantum evaporation process of bhs .",
    "some of the most popular are : ( i ) evaporation is related with ` quasi - normal ' modes of black hole excitations @xcite and the emitted particles are radiated by means of a quantum tunnelling process from under the horizon @xcite .",
    "( ii ) the loop quantum gravity approach @xcite proclaims the quantum horizon , experiencing topological fluctuations , to be itself the source of the quantum radiation .",
    "( iii ) strong fields near the horizon lead to virtual pair creation in its outer vicinity , and while one of the particles falls into the horizon the other keeps going to infinity @xcite .",
    "this process can also be considered as a quantum tunneling via a classically energetically prohibited region , the klein paradox @xcite .    in the original derivation of bh evaporation , hawking described thermal radiation as quantum tunneling triggered by vacuum fluctuations , however , the treatment was based upon a fixed background , without a back reaction causing the fluctuations of the background geometry .",
    "consideration of the back reaction of vacuum fluctuations and their impact on the horizon was initiated by york @xcite who used spherical zero - point fluctuations ( ringing modes ) and the corresponding deformation of the space - time metric .",
    "this dynamical approach was also supported by loop quantum gravity @xcite and in subsequent work @xcite(see also the references in @xcite ) .",
    "however , the treatment was restricted to simplest deformations of the horizon , caused by spherical or ellipsoidal quasi - normal modes .",
    "meanwhile , recent analysis of rotating black holes @xcite in the kerr - schild formalism showed that the _ exact _ electromagnetic excitations on the kerr background has to be _ aligned with the kerr congruence .",
    "_ as a consequence , the elementary electromagnetic excitations turn out to be very far from the usual spherical harmonics .",
    "they constitute a brand new basis for elementary excitations and for elementary deformations of the horizon .",
    "the present treatment , based on these exact solutions , shows that horizons acquire a very specific topological deformation subjected to influence of vacuum electromagnetic excitations .",
    "we show that an elementary aligned excitation is accompanied by the formation of a singular light - like beam , which emerges from the black hole .",
    "the influence of those beams on the horizon was analyzed in our previous paper @xcite .",
    "it was shown there that the horizon is very sensitive to such beams , which form thereby narrow holes connecting the inner and outer regions . even weak elementary beams may be able to break through the kerr black hole horizon . moreover , the elementary deformations of the horizon turn out to be of topological nature .",
    "we consider also the wave aligned electromagnetic excitations of the kerr solution and show that they are asymptotically exact in the low - frequency limit .",
    "this result allows us to use aligned wave excitations for modeling excitations of massive black holes through weak fields of virtual photons , and to arrive to a new feature of deformation of the horizon , by invoking a large set of microscopic holes in the horizon , caused by singular beams .",
    "we put forward the conjecture that the complex - analytic structure of the kerr congruence and of the wave excitations which are aligned with the kerr congruence are at the base of the emission mechanism .",
    "as is well known @xcite , the kerr metric is the unique regular one representing a much broader kerr - schild class of einstein - maxwell solutions .",
    "there is an infinite set of exact rotating kerr - schild solutions containing semi - infinite light - like beams ( the singular @xmath0waves , see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the electromagnetic field of these solutions is aligned with the principal null congruence of the kerr geometry .",
    "we show in this letter that correspondingly aligned wave excitations of the kerr geometry tend to the above mentioned exact stationary kerr - schild solutions in the low - frequency limit .",
    "below , we summarize the discussion and specify the whole argument for the case of the kerr - newman solution in the kerr - schild form .",
    "the peculiarities of the kerr - schild approach rely on the kerr - schild _ ansatz _ for the metric , which is adjusted to an auxiliary minkowski space - time with a metric @xmath1 contrary to other approaches , in which the coordinate system is adjusted to a position of the horizon which is unstable itself and , as we will show , is very sensitive to the electromagnetic field .",
    "the kerr - schild approach allows one to see some peculiarities of the solutions which are not seen in other approaches .",
    "in particular , it exhibits complex - analytic properties of the black hole geometries which are related with two sheets of the space - time . on the kerr - schild background",
    "one sees that the kerr geometry is two - sheeted , having an ` in ' @xmath2 and an ` out ' @xmath3 sheet , and corresponding @xmath4 and @xmath5 metrics : g^()_=_-2h k^()_k^ ( ) _ , [ kspm]which are different on the ` in ' and on the ` out ' sheets .",
    "moreover , the fields on the ` in ' and ` out ' sheets do not interact with each other .",
    "in particular the principal null directions @xmath6 are different on different sheets , being determined by different functions @xmath7 and @xmath8 in the null cartesian coordinates @xmath9 namely k_^ ( ) dx^= p^-1(du + ^d+ y^d- y^^ ( ) dv ) .",
    "[ kpm]the known kerr singular ring is a branch line of space , and forms a gate to the negative sheet of the metric .",
    "the kerr principal null congruence ( pnc ) propagates from the ` in ' sheet of the kerr space to the ` out ' sheet through the kerr singular ring , covering the auxiliary minkowski space - time twice .",
    "this peculiarity of space - time has not been observed earlier by analysis of the usual spherical black hole solutions and leads to far - reaching consequences , as we intend to show .    the electromagnetic field corresponding to the exact kerr - schild solution has to be _ aligned _ with the kerr principal null congruence .",
    "this means that the maxwell tensor of strength @xmath10 and vector potential @xmath11 satisfy the following alignment condition k^f_^=k^ , k^a_=0 , [ align ] where @xmath12 is some scalar function .",
    "now , since the vector fields @xmath13 are different on the ` in ' and ` out ' sheets of the kerr geometry , one sees that the ` in ' and the ` out ' aligned fields can not possibly be on the same sheet simultaneously , in accordance with the structure of the algebraically special kerr - schild solutions .",
    "therefore , in the kerr geometry the ` in ' and the ` out ' modes of the aligned electromagnetic waves are positioned on the two different sheets of the real kerr space and do not interact ( at least classically ) .",
    "the alignment condition is very strong and leads to important physical consequences .",
    "it resembles the condition for exclusion of the longitudinal modes in dual - string modes and is the origin of the complex - analytic properties of the kerr geometry .",
    "note that , in the ordinary perturbative approach based on quasi - normal modes , the important two - sheetedness of the kerr geometry has been ignored . the perturbative approach breaks analyticity of the solutions and leads to a drastic change in the structure of the usual quasi - normal and aligned electromagnetic excitations of ( rotating ) black holes . in particular ,",
    "the analytic aligned wave excitations lead to the formation of light - like singular beams emanating from the black hole and changing the properties of its horizon , breaking up the usual classical structure of the black hole .",
    "we show here that the aligned wave solutions are asymptotically exact for slowly varying excitations , that is , in the low - frequency limit .",
    "similar beams will also appear for the aligned excitations of the rotating sources without horizons considered in @xcite .",
    "for the readers convenience we recall here the structure of the exact kerr - schild solution displaying the aligned electromagnetic field which produces the singular beams @xcite .",
    "the exact electromagnetic field which is aligned with the kerr null congruence , @xmath14 , depends on an arbitrary holomorphic function @xmath15 which determines the kerr - schild ( ks ) metric ( [ kspm ] ) via the function h = .",
    "[ hpsi ] in the kerr - newman solution , @xmath16 is the charge .",
    "however , any holomorphic function @xmath17 yields also an exact aligned solution . the function y",
    "= e^i 2 is a projective angular coordinate .",
    "it determines the kerr congruence ( [ kpm ] ) and also the ks tetrad @xmath18 with the real directions e^3=pk_dx , e^4 = dv + h e^3 , h = hp^-2 , [ e34h ] and the mutually complex conjugated forms e^1 = d - y dv , e^2 = d |- |y dv .",
    "[ e12 ] for the kerr congruence satisfying the _ geodesic _ and _ shear - free _ conditions : y,_2=y,_4=0,the einstein - maxwell field equations were integrated by debney , kerr and schild @xcite in a general form .",
    "they reduced them to a system of two equations for the electromagnetic field and two more for the gravitational field . the electromagnetic field aligned with the kerr congruence",
    "admits the self - dual tetrad components , _ 12=az^2 , _",
    "31=z - ( az),_1 , [ e6]where @xmath19 and the function @xmath20 is a complex expansion of the congruence , which for the stationary kerr - newman solution is inversely proportional to a complex radial distance @xmath21 where @xmath22 functions @xmath23 and @xmath24 obey the eqs .",

    "so , except for the kerr - newman solution , for which @xmath31const , the solutions @xmath26 need to be singular at some angular directions @xmath32 .",

    "the properties of the horizons of these solutions were considered in @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the black hole horizon is pierced by the axial singularity , with the appearance of a tube - like region which connects the internal with the external region , thus possibly allowing matter to escape from the bh . as a result",
    ", the kerr singularity turns out to be `` half - dressed '' .",
    "the structure of the horizons for the solutions containing axial singular lines follows from the kerr - schild form of the metric for the function @xmath43 , where the oblate coordinates @xmath44 are used on the flat minkowski background @xmath45 .",
    "for the rotating solutions , the horizon splits into four surfaces .",
    "two of them correspond to the statical limit , @xmath46 and @xmath47 , determined by the condition @xmath48 , and the other two surfaces correspond to the event and cauchy horizons , @xmath49 const , which are the null surfaces determined by the condition @xmath50    the simplest axial singularity is the pole @xmath51 in this case , the boundaries of the ergosphere , @xmath52 and @xmath47 , are determined by @xmath48 and the solution acquires a new feature : the surfaces @xmath52 and @xmath47 are joined by a tube , conforming a simply connected surface .",
    "the surfaces of the _ event horizons _ are null ones and obey the differential equation @xmath53 the resulting structure for the horizon is illustrated in fig .  1 ( taken from @xcite ) .",
    "the two event horizons are joined into one connected surface , and the surface of the event horizon lies inside the boundary of the ergosphere . as a consequence , the axial singularities lead to the formation of holes in the bh horizon , thus opening the interior of the bh to external space .",
    "corresponding exact solutions with wave electromagnetic excitations _ on the kerr background _ have been obtained and investigated in @xcite .",
    "they are asymptotically exact in the low - frequency limit , i.e. are also self - consistent , taking into account back reaction . in the far zone",
    "the wave beams were considered in @xcite and it was shown that locally they have the structure of the self - consistent exact @xmath0wave ( peres ) solutions .",
    "note , that similar singular ` axial ' strings where obtained long ago in the robinson - trautman class of solutions @xcite , and also for fermionic wave excitations on the kerr geometry @xcite .",
    "wave excitations propagating in the direction @xmath40 are described by means of the function _",
    "i(y , ) = q_i()\\{i}1 y - y_i , [ e8]where @xmath54 is a slowly varying amplitude of excitation with analytic dependence on the retarded time @xmath55 similar to the usual treatment of the plane waves , such infinitely extended beam solutions have to be replaced by physically realizable solutions with finite extension .",
    "in particular , the wave and nonstationary generalizations of these solutions have to contain some time - dependent amplitude factor @xmath56 which turns them into beam - like pulses .",
    "the pp - wave singularity can also be regularized , as it was considered in @xcite .",
    "the equations for the gravitational sector , obtained by debney , kerr and schild ( dks ) , are given in app .",
    "a. the most essential fact in the treatment of these wave and non - stationary kerr - schild solutions is the appearance of an extra radiation field @xmath57 which is absent in the term @xmath58 ( [ hpsi ] ) and does not have immediate influence on the metric tensor .",
    "however , it leads to the appearance of null radiation @xmath59 which is described by the vaidya shining star solution @xcite .",
    "this radiation leads to the loss of mass of the black hole , and we show in app .  a that it is small for low - frequency solutions , since the rhs of the gravitational equations @xmath60 tends to zero in the low - frequency limit @xmath61 therefore , the wave beam - like pulses tend to self - consistent kerr - schild solutions in this limit .",
    "the structure of the solutions contains the following very important physical peculiarity : the smallness of the function @xmath24 does not mean that the function @xmath62 in ( [ hpsi ] ) is required to be small too . the electromagnetic field determined by @xmath63 and the corresponding distortion of the metric and horizon by the function @xmath58 are independent from the frequency and can be in fact very strong .",
    "note also , that there is one subtle point in our treatment related with the fact that , due to the poles in the angular directions @xmath42 , the limit @xmath64 as @xmath65 is not a uniform one , which demands a thorough treatment .",
    "however , the general integral expressions for @xmath24 contain a free term , and in app .",
    "b we show that this term may be used for the regularization of these poles , without any influence on the function @xmath23 .",
    "since the aligned solutions here considered tend to the exact ones in the asymptotic limit @xmath66 , this also means , physically , that they must tend to the exact solution corresponding to ` ringing modes ' of a black hole subjected to a weak external electromagnetic excitation . in particular , it may be the vacuum field of virtual photons .",
    "it could be reduced to a standard quantum treatment of scattering plane waves on a potential barrier , if only the extra kerr - schild demand of the alignment of the exact solutions with the kerr congruence ( [ align ] ) would be obeyed . however",
    ", this demand is very hard , and the plane waves can not reside in the kerr background . even in the limit of zero mass term , the kerr background is not minkowski one and has a two - sheeted topology which does not admit plane waves .",
    "this situation is close related with the twistor analytic structure of the kerr geometry , and prevents the use of a standard scattering approach .",
    "the character of this paper does not allow us to discuss this problem .",
    "because of that , we will follow the simple idea of york @xcite to consider the back - reaction of an elementary excitation of a black - hole caused by an elementary interaction with a virtual photon . in most of the previous treatments of this sort , deformation of the horizon",
    "was related with the replacements @xmath67 and @xmath68 , retaining the spherical topology of the horizon . in our case , in accordance with the discussed solutions , an elementary excitation aligned with the kerr congruence represents a light - like beam , which in the far zone takes the form of @xmath41-wave string - like solution , and the corresponding elementary deformation of the horizon changes its topology , even at the low - frequency limit .",
    "we neglect the recoil and use expressions ( [ py3 ] ) for the stationary case , which allow us to get the exact solution for function @xmath23 in the form containing the wave excitations a=(y,)/p^2 .",
    "[ atot1]this equation is linear in @xmath69 and the total excitation caused by the virtual photons will be a sum over elementary excitations in the distinct directions @xmath70 ( y , ) = _ i \\{i_i } .",
    "[ psiyt ] the wave solution ( [ psiyt ] ) with many excitations will become exact on the kerr background , while the back reaction will break self - consistency , leading to some disclosure in the gravitational sector , as it is discussed in app .",
    "b , this disclosure is proportional to the term @xmath71 in the equations ( [ g7 ] ) , and has to tend to zero in the low - frequency limit together with @xmath66 .",
    "the corresponding retarded time has the form @xcite @xmath72 , which allows us to obtain the general retarded - time solution @xmath73 as the sum of the partial solution @xmath74 containing series of poles , _ 0 = _",
    "i c_i ( ) 1p^2y(y - y_i ) with oscillating factors c_i()=i 2 ^ 1/2q_i()\\{i_i } [ ci1 ] , and the term _ f = [ gamf1 ] which is determined by a free function @xmath75    the free term @xmath76 has to be tuned to have the same series of poles and the same oscillating factors of opposite sign to provide regularization of poles by subtraction .",
    "it is shown in app .",
    "b that such a regularization does not touch the function @xmath23 and provides a uniform low - frequency limit @xmath77 .",
    "following to analogues with family of green functions one can introduce the step function @xmath78 separating the solutions on the positive sheet @xmath79 from the solutions on the negative one , @xmath80 and consider the ingoing field of virtual photons as a non - regularized one , @xmath81 while the field @xmath23 and the regularized field @xmath82 may be considered as outgoing radiation @xmath83    the question can be asked , what is the mechanism which provides such a compensating regularization and discontinuity of the solutions ?",
    "we do not know a precise answer , although it is quite clear that the discontinuity has to be related to some source positioned in the vicinity of the kerr disk @xmath84 and that regularization minimizes the interaction between the vacuum field @xmath85 and the one induced by the kerr source excitations , in the form of the field @xmath23 .",
    "the process of scattering may be interpreted in this case as a type of scattering of the incoming vacuum radiation on the stringy structure of the kerr geometry .",
    "it should be emphasized once more that there is a principal difference between the roles played by the fields @xmath23 and @xmath86 the fields @xmath24 as well as @xmath87 do not act immediately on the metric , being respectable ones for the radiation and the appearance of singular micro - beams covering the celestial sphere @xmath88 .",
    "its influence on the metric is indirect and occurs only via the loss of mass by radiation , in accordance with expression ( [ g8 ] ) , where @xmath87 has to be substituted by the outgoing radiation , @xmath89 at the same time , the exact solutions for the electromagnetic field @xmath23 on the kerr - schild background , have direct influence on the metric , leading to the formation of the holes at the horizon . the direct influence of the field @xmath23 on the metric and on the horizon will result into formation of multiple micro - holes in the horizon and its topological fluctuations , as depicted in fig .",
    "2 .    in the far zone the stress tensor of the electromagnetic field",
    "is determined by the leading term @xmath90 ( [ e6 ] ) , which describes the null electromagnetic radiation along the rays of the congruence @xmath91 at the same time , the stress - energy tensor is represented by the @xmath92 component , which is determined by the @xmath93term t _",

    "in a number of recent works , the origin of thermal emission from black holes has been related with conformal - analytical structures inherent to two - dimensional , 1 + 1 dimensional and 2 + 1 dimensional black holes @xcite .",
    "the two - dimensional case is the most familiar and the corresponding conformal field theories have been elaborated in detail , including corresponding quantum gravity issues .",
    "quantum effects of the low dimensional black holes are related to some virasoro algebra which , on the other side , represents the core of the ( super)string theory .",
    "therefore , one observes the growing tendency that the methods of superstring theory acquire increasing meaning in the physics of black holes .",
    "the kerr - schild structure of the kerr geometry is based on the kerr theorem , the complex - analytic structure of which is expressed in terms of twistors .",
    "twistorial analyticity of the kerr geometry @xcite is a _",
    "natural _ four - dimensional analog to two - dimensional conformal - analytic stringy structures .",
    "the analyticity of electromagnetic excitations of the kerr geometry is expressed in terms of the alignment of the electromagnetic fields with the holomorphic structure of the kerr congruence , which is determined by the kerr theorem in terms of an analytic surface in twistor space @xcite .    a central role in the twistorial structure",
    "is played by the two - dimensional sphere @xmath100 parametrized by the analytic function @xmath101 which is a projective angular coordinate .",
    "the singular kerr - schild solutions are described by holomorphic fields on this sphere , just similar to topological excitations of the wzw model .",
    "therefore , the mechanism of the origin of the quantum spectrum in the kerr - schild geometry is to be similar to the suggested one for 2- and ( 2 + 1)-dimensional btz black holes , which is also based on the topological wzw model @xcite .",
    "in particular , it was obtained in @xcite that a btz black hole may be represented as a section of the four - dimensional kerr black hole in the equatorial plane @xmath102 it is known that the dual string models @xcite are based on conformal field theory @xcite , the core of which is formed by quantum oscillators obeying a virasoro algebra @xcite & = & ( m - n ) l_m+n + c 12 ( m^3 -m ) _",
    "m+n,0 , [ vir ] with similar expression for conjugate generators @xmath103 the central charge @xmath104 depends on the details of the quantum system considered and was studied for a large variety of different stringy models @xcite .",
    "however , numerous investigations of different models have shown @xcite that details of the theories are not important , and that the key requirement is the existence of the conformal structure , in particular , the @xmath105 isometry providing the algebra of the gauge field transformations diff @xmath106 the bekenstein - hawking thermal spectrum is reached in most of these models on the base of cardy s formula @xcite , with independence of the value of the central charge @xcite .",
    "similarly , the conformal group of the kerr - schild geometry forming the core of its analytic properties is related with the projective angular coordinate @xmath107 which is one of the three twistor coordinates of the projective twistor space .",
    "it has the stringy structure @xcite and may determine the spectrum of the radiation from the kerr black hole similar to btz black holes in accordance with cardy s formula .",
    "this demands extra considerations .",
    "the main goal of this paper was to show the existence of a very nontrivial beam - like form of excitations and of a related radiation of the kerr - schild geometry , as well as a quite nontrivial form of a corresponding topological deformation of the horizon , which are based on analytic properties of the kerr - schild geometry and determined by the alignment conditions for the electromagnetic excitations . in conclusion , we touched upon the old question : where is the black hole radiation created ?",
    "contrary to the familiar point of view that radiation is created near the horizon , we arrive at the conclusion that the horizon plays a rather passive role . being perforated by a series of beams , it provides a way to escape for radiation , while the creation of the radiation itself is related with the gravitational anomaly which occurs under regularization of the poles of the energy - momentum tensor . in this respect",
    "we share the point of view discussed in @xcite .",
    "indeed , in the case of a stationary field @xmath108 i.e. @xmath109 , the field @xmath24 is decoupled , the free flow of zero - point radiation @xmath110 obeys the conservation law @xmath111 , and the field @xmath24 may be decoupled from this system of equations @xcite .",
    "creation of the wave field @xmath23 is similar to a scattering process which , in accordance with @xcite , leads to an anomaly in general covariance , taking the form of a non - conservation of the energy - momentum tensor and signaling towards the interaction with some source in the core of the black hole , which is apparently the true source of radiation .",

    ", one should introduce the retarded - time parameter @xmath118 obeying the constraints satisfy @xmath119 the corresponding retarded time has the form @xcite @xmath120 which allows us to obtain the general retarded - time solution @xmath121 as the sum of the partial solution @xmath74 containing series of poles , @xmath122 with oscillating factors @xmath123 and",
    "the term @xmath124 which is determined by a free function @xmath75    the free term @xmath76 could be taken with the same series of poles and the same oscillating factors of opposite sign to provide regularization of poles by subtraction . however , the extra slowly varying function @xmath125 has the different degrees in the front of the functions @xmath126 and @xmath127 which prevents immediate compensation .",
    "working in a complex vicinity of i - th pole , one can set @xmath128 and expand the function @xmath129 in @xmath130 p(_i , y ) = p_i + 2 ^ -1/2 _ i ( y - y_i ) + o [ ( y - y_i)^2 ] , [ pan ] where @xmath131 .$ ] then the free function @xmath132 chosen in the form @xmath133 will regularize the solution , compensating the poles in @xmath134 the result of this compensation is the function _ reg= - _ i c_i ( ) . such a regularization does not touch the function @xmath23 and provides a uniform low - frequency limit @xmath135 the regularized function @xmath136 represents a stochastic process which is the sum of many oscillating terms .",

    "looking on the product @xmath138 one sees that the i - th pole in function @xmath23 is compensated by the k - th zero @xmath139 in @xmath140 by setting @xmath141 while for @xmath142 the product averaged over time @xmath143 vanishes due to the difference in the frequencies of oscillations .",

    "similar treatment of the correlation @xmath145 shows that the terms with @xmath146 do not correlate and vanish , while the sum with @xmath147 survives and turns out to be singular , displaying radiation along the kerr congruence , which is similar to the radiation of the vaidya shining star solution .",
