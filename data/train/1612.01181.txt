    "classical maxwell electrodynamics is a great theoretical and phenomenological success : its predictions are found to correctly describe a very wide variety of physical phenomena . in this scenario ,",
    "the sources are agglomerations of electrons , protons and neutrons  all spin-1/2 fermions ",
    "so that the maxwell equations actually encode the macroscopic interaction between photons and spin-1/2 particles .",
    "in the more general context of quantum field theories , however , the electromagnetic field is not bound to couple only to spin-1/2 sources , but may also interact with scalar ( spin-0 ) and/or vector ( spin-1 ) charged particles .",
    "at this point an interesting question arises : how can one distinguish between these sources via electromagnetic experiments ? or rather , can one find similarities  or universalities  among sources with different spins ?",
    "a way to ( partially ) answer these questions is by investigating the potential energy between the spin-0 , -1/2 and -1 sources .",
    "the study of the interparticle potential serves yet another important cause , namely , the determination of the properties of the mediator , such as whether it is massive or not , as well as provide information on the number of propagating degrees of freedom .",
    "this is specially important in scenarios with physics beyond the standard model , whose low - energy effective theories generate modifications to usual electrodynamics .",
    "the role of the sources , which couple to the gauge fields , is pivotal to understand  and experimentally probe  the features of modified electrodynamics . here",
    "we wish to pursue a comparative study of the potential energy between scalar ( spin-0 ) , spinorial ( spin-1/2 ) and vector ( spin-1 ) sources , all electrically charged and massive .",
    "similar analyses have been carried out e.g. in refs .",
    "@xcite  also including higher - order and quantum effects  in the context of pure maxwell electrodynamics ( and gravitation @xcite ) . here",
    "we focus on a simpler approximation and work only with potential energies generated by one - boson exchange .    the potential energy being a classical , macroscopic quantity , it is natural that we work in the limit of small velocities , i.e. , the non - relativistic ( nr ) limit .",

    "@xcite-@xcite , work in the extreme nr limit of static sources . though relevant , this restriction obscures the role of the spin of the sources , as can be easily seen in the case of spin-1/2 fermions , where the momentum is directly coupled to the spin matrices .    in order to exhibit the spin and momentum dependence in greater detail , we shall use the first born approximation @xcite , where the potential energy is given by @xmath1 with @xmath2 being the nr limit of the fully relativistic feynman amplitude @xmath3 .    for the sake of concreteness",
    ", we shall work in the center - of - mass reference ( cm ) frame , so that only a pair of momentum variables is independent : @xmath4 and @xmath5 , thus representing the average momentum and the momentum transfer , respectively ( cf . fig .  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "moreover , we assume elastic scattering , where @xmath6 , so @xmath7 .",
    "[ fig1 ]    in order to bring to light spin ( and momentum ) dependence , it is necessary to go beyond @xmath8 in @xmath9 . at this level",

    "for this reason we shall work with amplitudes up to @xmath11 , where more interesting effects become evident .",
    "as we shall see , at this approximation level one obtains spin- and momentum - dependent generalizations of the yukawa potential displaying , e.g. spin - orbit couplings as well as spin - spin interactions .    at this point",
    "it is important to briefly address the relationship between @xmath2 and @xmath3 in order to avoid confusion .",

    "this is specially true here , as we want to go up to @xmath11 .",
    "an important instance where this plays a role is in expressions involving combinations of energy and mass , such as @xmath13 , which are momentum independent up to @xmath14 , but give @xmath15 at the @xmath11 level . in the case of spin-1/2 sources , for example , we shall see that such corrections affect the monopole - monopole terms , but not the spin - dependent ones ( cf .",

    "first we consider the podolsky - lee - wick higher - order derivative model  @xcite-@xcite , where a heavy `` ghost ''  la pauli - villars is introduced and helps tame uv divergences .",
    "next we study the case of a massive neutral boson from a novel @xmath16 symmetry kinetically mixed with the photon  @xcite . since usual matter",
    "is not charged under @xmath16 , this boson remains hidden , being dubbed a hidden ( or dark ) photon .",
    "the kinetic mixing induces a photon - hidden - photon oscillation and modifies the electromagnetic interaction between electrical charges  @xcite .",
    "these two scenarios are representative and serve as applications for the more general discussion we wish to present .",
    "the main idea is to determine the role of the spin of the sources in the interparticle potential energy and , simultaneously , check for the signs of possible beyond the standard model effective models which may induce small corrections in the well - known maxwell electrodynamics .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec2 ] , we present a general and systematic discussion of the interparticle potentials for different sources , where we apply the nr approximation to the respective matter currents . in section  [ sec3 ]",
    ", we analyze the standard maxwell electrodynamics as a benchmark . in sections",
    "[ sec4 ] and [ sec5 ] , we work out the cases with the podolsky - lee - wick modified electrodynamics and with photon - hidden - photon oscillations , respectively .",
    "we dedicate section  [ sec6 ] to our concluding remarks .",
    "we use natural units ( @xmath17 ) and a flat metric @xmath18 throughout .",
    "let us set up our analysis by first considering the general structure of the nr potential energy for interactions mediated by neutral abelian vector bosons .",
    "as discussed earlier , the interparticle potential energy is given by the first born approximation , eq .. this is essentially the nr limit of the quantum field theoretical scattering process between two particles ( here labeled @xmath19 and @xmath20 ) with 3-momentum attributions as given in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "since the feynman rules at tree level are equivalent to considering the matter currents @xmath21 associated with the interacting particles as being the interaction vertex , the amplitude may be written  @xcite @xmath22 where @xmath23 are the currents associated with particles @xmath24 and @xmath25 is defined as the feynman propagator , @xmath26 , without its longitudinal part  this is possible once we have @xmath27 , i.e. , conserved currents @xcite .",
    "before we treat particular cases for the external currents , we note that one can simplify the expression above , eq .. if we consider that the field theory describing the vector boson which is responsible for the interaction at hand respects lorentz invariance and receives no contribution from topological terms , we can express the feynman propagator as a linear combination of the metric , @xmath28 , and momentum transfer , @xmath29 .",
    "schematically one may then write @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are scalar functions specified by the particular theory under examination .",
    "when contracted with conserved currents , only the part linear in @xmath28 survives and , as a consequence , one can write @xmath33 . inserting this into eq . , we finally get @xmath34    from now on we shall particularize the external currents to the cases of spin-0 , -1/2 and -1 sources in order to derive suitable expressions to compute the potential energy as mediated via one - boson exchange .",
    "we first consider the simplest case , where the charge carriers are described by spin-0 ( complex ) scalar fields .",
    "it is well known that the interaction vertex between an abelian vector field and a scalar field is given by @xmath35 with momenta flowing _ into _ the vertex . here",
    "@xmath36 is the coupling constant .",
    "taking into account the usual feynman rules and changing the final 4-momenta in favor of the momentum transfer and the initial 4-momenta , we obtain the following expression for the relativistic amplitude : @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 stand for the energies of the incoming particles and we used that @xmath40 in the cm frame , as well as @xmath41 , since @xmath7 .",
    "we note that we do not find extra @xmath42 terms .",
    "according to eq . , the nr amplitude is @xmath43 with the notation @xmath44 .",
    "now , bearing in mind that @xmath45 in the nr limit , we may recast @xmath46 as @xmath47    here it is important to stress that the energy - dependent pre - factors in eq .",
    "stem from normalization factors of the wave functions which compose the currents and , for this reason , we shall enforce our nr approximation by allowing terms up to and including @xmath11 in @xmath48 .",
    "this means that terms such as @xmath49 will be disregarded as in eq . above",
    "this choice might lead us to not recover contact terms @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , this approach is consistent with our approximation scheme and we shall make similar choices in the rest of this paper .    finally , using eq . along with eq .",
    ", we obtain the following formal result for the nr potential energy associated with spin-0 charged particles @xmath50 with the integral @xmath51 defined in appendix  [ integrals ] .    a similar analysis has been conducted in ref .",
    "@xcite for the case of scalar electrodynamics .",
    "our result , eq . , is different , as here we do not find a contact term ( which is still different from the one found in ref .",
    "the reason for this is simple : the two momentum variables we work with are @xmath52 and @xmath53 , which are orthogonal .",
    "this ensures that they are independent from each other .",
    "since we are integrating over the momentum transfer , it is convenient to separate terms in the nr amplitude that depend on it from those which do not .",
    "this is most easily done with the orthogonal variables , @xmath52 and @xmath53 . in ref .",
    "@xcite the extra contact term arises as the initial momentum of one of the particles is used , and this momentum is not independent from the momentum transfer , which must be integrated according to eq ..      we now consider the case of external currents associated with charged spin-@xmath54 fields .",
    "the conserved vector current is @xmath55 where @xmath56 stands for the positive - energy solutions of the dirac equation ( its conjugate is @xmath57 ) and @xmath36 is the coupling constant between the spin-1/2 fermion and the vector boson , as usual .    using the standard dirac representation for the gamma matrices , namely , @xmath58 one obtains @xmath59 with @xmath60 being the basic spinor .",

    "the modified photon - hidden - photon electrodynamics is by finding the effective action for the electromagnetic field by integrating out the @xmath164-field in eq .. this was carried out in ref .",
