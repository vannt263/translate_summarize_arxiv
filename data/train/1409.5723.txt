    "in recent years , the study of boundary conditions for topological quantum field theories ( tqfts ) has attracted much interest , both in the physics and mathematics literature ; see for instance @xcite , among others .",
    "namely , given an @xmath1-dimensional tqft , from the mathematical point of view it is a sensible question to ask when does such a theory produce genuine numerical invariants of an @xmath1-dimensional manifold with boundary , rather than vectors in a state space associated to it .",
    "this is possible if we can regard the boundary not as arising from a `` cut - and - paste '' procedure implementing locality , but rather as a `` constrained '' part of the manifold . in general",
    ", there will be obstructions in extending a tqft to manifolds with boundaries : the case of reshetikhin - turaev and turaev - viro tqfts has been recently investigated in @xcite . both reshetikhin - turaev @xcite and turaev - viro @xcite tqfts are extendeded topological field theories , namely these theories assign data also to manifolds of codimension 2 . in the present work , we focus our attention on tqfts that are extended down to codimension @xmath4 , and at the same time , most importantly , extended _ up to infinity _ to include diffeomorphisms , and their isotopies .",
    "this is the framework pioneered in @xcite , which makes extensive use of the language of @xmath2-categories , and which we find particularly suitable for our aims . indeed , by regarding @xmath1-categories as @xmath2-categories",
    ", we can introduce the notion of a _ tqft with moduli level @xmath0 _ : these are topological field theories which also detect information about the homotopy type of the diffeomorphisms group of manifolds up to a certain level @xmath0 .",
    "+ our main motivation to introduce and study such field theories is due to the fact that they provide a very natural and elegant description of _ anomalous _ tqfts .",
    "it is well known , for instance , that the reshetikhin - turaev construction produces from a modular tensor category @xmath5 a tqft which is defined on a central extension of the extended 3-dimensional cobordism category @xcite : namely , it gives rise only to a _ projective _ representation of the 2-tier extended cobordism category @xmath6 taking values in @xmath7 , and the anomaly , in this context , is represented via a 2-cocycle on the modular groupoid @xcite . in a more modern approach , ( topological ) anomalies are themselves field theories in higher dimensions , and of a special kind , namely they are _ invertible _ ; anomalous tqfts are then realised as _ truncated morphisms _ from the trivial theory @xmath8 to the given anomaly .",
    "we refer the reader to very recent works @xcite detailing this point of view . in the present work , we realise the anomaly theory as an invertible tqft of moduli level 1 of the _ same _ dimension as the anomalous tqft .",
    "namely , taking the higher morphisms into account there is no need for the involved tqfts to be truncations of tqfts defined in one dimension higher ; rather , truncated tqfts are a very particular example of moduli level 1 tqfts .",
    "this provides a unified language to describe anomalous theories extended down to codimension @xmath4 , and their category : given an anomaly theory @xmath9 , it is the @xmath10-category of natural transformations between the trivial theory and @xmath9 .",
    "moreover , this description allows for more general anomaly theories , as explained in the text , and it has a strong representation theoretic flavour : anomalous @xmath1-dimensional tqfts extended down to codimension @xmath4 give rise to homotopy fixed points for @xmath11-characters , a suitable and natural generalisation of group characters to the setting of @xmath2-groups . in codimension 1 ,",
    "these provide projective representations of the mapping class group of @xmath12-closed manifolds .",
    "+   + anomalous tqfts and boundary conditions are expected to intertwine in a subtle relationship .",
    "the most striking example is provided by chern - simons theory , which should best be regarded as a field theory living on the boundary of a 4-dimensional tqft @xcite .",
    "similarly , the reshetikhin - turaev theory arising from a modular tensor category @xmath5 is induced by a 4-dimensional crane - yetter theory @xcite . by basically using a _ dimensional reduction _ procedure ,",
    "we show that from a boundary condition of an ( invertible ) @xmath3-dimensional theory @xmath13 one can obtain an anomalous tqft , where the anomaly is induced by @xmath13 itself .",
    "one sensible question to ask concerns the converse statement , i.e. the possibility of producing a boundary condition for an @xmath3-dimensional theory from the datum of an anomalous tqft .",
    "in general , we do not expect this to hold : indeed , an anomalous tqft with anomaly @xmath9 contains too little information to determine a boundary condition @xmath14 .",
    "neverthless , when @xmath13 is a fully extended theory the situation is much more amenable to treatment : via the cobordism hypothesis _ for manifolds with singularities _ , we show that anomalous tqfts with anomaly given by a fully extended tqft @xmath13 do indeed produce boundary conditions for @xmath13 .",
    "in other words , in the fully extended situation , `` truncated morphisms '' of tqfts are just a shadow of something richer , namely tqfts with genuine boundary conditions .",
    "this is particularly clear thanks to the formalism used to describe anomalies , namely as morphisms of tqfts of moduli level 1 .",
    "+ the present work is organised as follows . +   + in section [ infinity ]",
    "we present a very gentle introduction to the language of @xmath2-categories , in the amount necessary to allow the reader acquainted with category theory to follow the rest of the paper .",
    "we also include some results we were not able to retrieve from the literature .",
    "+ in section [ cobordism ] we give some basic notions concerning cobordism categories , with emphasis on properties available once we consider extension `` up to infinity '' .",
    "+ in section [ tqft ] we introduce the notion of an extended tqft with moduli level @xmath0 , and provide some examples ; we show also how we recover ordinary extended tqfts .",
    "the fully extended case is discussed as well in this section .",
    "+ in section [ sec.anomaly ] , we introduce anomalies and anomalous tqfts via the language developed in section [ tqft ] . for consistency , we also discuss invertible theories , and some properties of the picard groupoid of @xmath1-vector spaces .",
    "+ in section [ twochar ] we take a little detour to introduce @xmath1-characters and their homotopy fixed points , which is a subject in its own .",
    "we present the basic definitions and results needed to provide a description of anomalous tqfts as homotopy fixed points , and we show how anomalous @xmath1-dimensional tqfts in codimension 1 give rise to projective representations of the mapping class group of closed @xmath12-dimensional manifolds , hence to projective modular functors .",
    "+ in section [ boundary ] we finally introduce boundary condition for tqfts , providing examples in the simplest situations , and comparisons with the existing literature when needed .",
    "+ in section [ boundanom ] we show how boundary conditions for invertible tqfts give rise to anomalous theories .",
    "moreover , we show that in the fully extended case also the contrary holds .",
    "we conclude with some remarks on recent results on 4-dimensional field theories arising from modular tensor categories .",
    "+   + not to burden the present work with technicalities of higher category theory , we have in several places appealed to intuition , and hence have preferred to give `` sketches '' of definitions , rather than full blown ones .",
    "we do feel the need then to be clearer concerning which aspects of our results should be regarded as rigorously established , and which ones still require a solid foundation , or at least technical details to be filled in . in the following we try to concisely state",
    "which tools we require : most of them are contained in @xcite , which , though lacking some amount of rigor in certain points , has had a wide influence in the study of tqfts , in particular concerning their classification .",
    "see , for instance , @xcite .",
    "+ first , for any nonnegative integer @xmath1 and any group homomorphism @xmath15 we assume there exists a symmetric monoidal @xmath16-category @xmath17 of @xmath18-framed cobordism .",
    "next , for any nonnegative integer @xmath1 , we assume there exists a notion of a symmetric monoidal @xmath1-category @xmath19 of @xmath1-vector spaces over a field @xmath20 , which , for @xmath21 , reproduces the usual monoidal category of vector spaces over @xmath20 .",
    "moreover , we require a natural equivalence of symmetric monoidal @xmath22-categories @xmath23 . in the last part of the present work ,",
    "we assume also the cobordism hypothesis to hold , namely that a symmetric monoidal functor @xmath24 is completely determined by its value on the @xmath18-framed point , and that this value can be any @xmath18-invariant fully dualizable object of @xmath19 .",
    "finally , we assume a robust notion of lax natural transformations between strong monoidal @xmath2-functors between symmetric @xmath25-categories .",
    "all the other results in the article are mathematically derived by these assumptions , and so they should be considered as mathematically established as soon as one is confident in assuming that in any rigorous foundation of the theory of symmetric monoidal @xmath16-categories , all of the above assumpions will have to be true .",
    "this is a widely expected to be so in the extended tqfts / higher categories communities .",
    "+ neverthless , for @xmath26 all the constructions we present here can be entirely reformulated using the language of ordinary categories , or the well established language of 2-categories and bicategories ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , the reader which is uncomfortable with the theory of @xmath2-category _ tout court _ can safely substitute @xmath4 and @xmath0 in the paper with 1 , and only have to deal with bicategories for the @xmath27-version of the results presented here . in particular , the main results of this article , i.e. , the construction of projective representations of the mapping class groups of manifolds from anomalous tqfts , and that boundary conditions for extended ( invertible ) tqfts do produce anomalous topological theories can be both entirely expressed within a bicategorical language .",
    "on the other hand , we have preferred to use the language of @xmath2-category because the naturality of the ideas contained in the present work become visibly clearer .",
    "moreover , it allows us to `` see far '' in the landscape of topological quantum field theories , and permits indeed interesting speculations , like the conjectural relation between reshetikhin - turaev anomalous 3d tqft , and the 4-category @xmath28 we present in the final part of the article .",
    "these could certainly be seen as additional motivations to pursue the consolidation of the foundation of @xmath2-category theory in all its aspects",

    "in this section we will collect relevant results concerning higher category theory , and in particular @xmath2-categories , which we will use in the paper , mainly following @xcite , to which we direct the reader for details .",
    "the experienced reader , instead , can skip this section altogether .",
    "+ an @xmath1-category can be informally thought of as a mathematical structure generalizing the notion of a category : we not only have objects and morphisms , but also morphisms between morphisms , morphisms between morphisms between morphisms , and so on , up to @xmath1 . in the case",
    "@xmath29 , a precise definition can be given ( see , e.g.,@xcite ) , where the crucial difference arises between _ strict _ and _ weak _ @xmath30-category .",
    "once we notice that a strict 2-category is equivalent to a category enriched in @xmath31 , we can give a recursive definition for strict @xmath1-categories as follows : for @xmath32 , a strict @xmath1-category is a category enriched in @xmath33 , the category of strict @xmath12-categories .",
    "the problem arises when we try to extend the above definition to obtain weak @xmath1-categories , i.e. an @xmath1-category where associativity for @xmath4-morphisms , etc .",
    "is only preserved up to @xmath11-morphisms , for @xmath34 , which obey the necessary coherence diagrams . a rigorous definition of weak @xmath1-category can nevertheless be given , and there are even different equivalent ways of formalizing this notion .",
    "basic references are @xcite .",
    "it goes without saying that weak @xmath1-categories are those of relevance in the mathematical world .",
    "an important example of ( weak ) @xmath1-category is that of @xmath1-vector spaces over a fixed characteristic 0 base field @xmath20 . for @xmath35 , the @xmath36-category ( i.e. , the set ) @xmath36-vect is the field @xmath20 ; for @xmath21 the @xmath37-category ( i.e. , the ordinary category ) @xmath37-vect is the category of ( finite dimensional ) vector spaces over @xmath20 . for @xmath29 ,",
    "the @xmath30-category @xmath30-vect comes in various flavours : by 2-vect one can mean the 2-category of kapranov - voevodsky 2-vector spaces @xcite , or the 2-category of ( finite ) @xmath20-linear categories with linear functors as morphisms and @xmath20-linear natural transformations as 2-morphisms , or the 2-category of ( finite dimensional ) @xmath20-algebras ( to be thought as placeholders for their categories of right modules ) , with ( finite dimensional ) bimodules as 1-morphisms and morphisms of bimodules as 2-morphisms , as in @xcite .- algebras and bimodules on the @xmath20-algebras of the form @xmath38 , for @xmath39 .",
    "] this latter incarnation of @xmath30-vect suggests an iterative definition of @xmath1-vect , see @xcite .",
    "for instance one can define @xmath40-vect as the 3-category whose objects are tensor categories over @xmath20 , whose morphisms are bimodule categories , and so on . in any of its incarnations",
    ", @xmath1-vect is an example of symmetric monoidal @xmath1-category .",
    "for instance , for @xmath29 the symmetric monoidal structure on the 2-category of finite @xmath20-linear categories is induced by deligne s tensor product @xcite .",
    "when one has @xmath4-morphisms for any @xmath4 up to infinity , one speaks of an @xmath2-category .",
    "just to settle the notation , we give the following    for @xmath41 , a @xmath16-category is a @xmath2-category in which every @xmath4-morphisms is invertible for @xmath42 .",
    "details , and a rigorous definition of an @xmath16-category as an @xmath1-fold complete segal space can be found in @xcite ; see also @xcite .",
    "notice that in the `` definition '' above , invertibily of @xmath4-morphisms must be understood recursively in the higher categorical sense , i.e. up to invertible @xmath11-morphisms .",
    "in particular , any @xmath1-category can be extended to an @xmath1-_discrete _ @xmath16-category , i.e. , an @xmath16-category in which all @xmath4-morphisms for @xmath42 are identities .",
    "we will often pass tacitily from @xmath1-categories to @xmath1-discrete @xmath2 categories in what follows .",
    "moreover , given an @xmath25-category and objects @xmath43 , there is a @xmath22-category @xmath44 of 1-morphisms .",
    "[ pathgrp ] the prototypical example of @xmath2-category arises from homotopy theory .",
    "indeed , let @xmath45 be a topological space .",
    "then there is an @xmath2-category @xmath46 , with objects given by the points of @xmath45 , 1-morphisms given by continuous paths in @xmath45 , 2-morphisms given by homotopies of paths with fixed end - points , 3-morphisms given by homotopies between homotopies , and so on . since the composition of paths is only associative up to homotopy , i.e. up to a 2-morphism , @xmath46 is necessarily a weak @xmath2-category .",
    "neverthless , the 2-morphism above , which is part of the data , is invertible up to 3-morphisms .",
    "indeed , all @xmath4-morphisms in @xmath46 are invertible , hence it is a @xmath47-category , which is usually called a @xmath2-groupoid .",
    "the guiding principle behind @xmath2-categories is that also the converse should be true , i.e. any @xmath2-groupoid arises as @xmath46 for some topological space , hence the theory of @xmath47-categories can be defined via homotopy theory .",
    "a genuine example of an @xmath16-category with @xmath48 is given by @xmath49 , the @xmath2-category of cobordisms , which can be informally described as consisting of having points as objects , 1-dimensional bordisms as 1-morphisms , 2-dimensional bordisms between bordisms as 2-morphisms , and so on until we arrive at @xmath1-dimensional bordisms as @xmath1-morphisms , from where higher morphisms are given by diffeomorphisms and isotopies : more precisely , the @xmath50-morphisms are diffeomorphisms which fix the boundaries , @xmath51-morphisms are isotopies of diffeomorphisms , @xmath52-morphisms are isotopies of isotopies , and so on .",
    "this is an example of a @xmath16-symmetric monoidal category , see @xcite .",
    "a rigorous and detailed construction of @xmath49 as an @xmath16-symmetric monoidal category can be found in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath16-category @xmath49 comes also in other `` flavours '' , depending on the additional structures we equip the manifolds with : for instance orientation and @xmath1-framing give @xmath53)-categories @xmath54 and @xmath55 , respectively .",
    "more precisely , let @xmath56 be a group homomorphism .",
    "for any @xmath57 , a @xmath4-manifold @xmath58 is naturally equipped with the @xmath59-bundle @xmath60 , and a @xmath18-framing for @xmath58 is the datum of a reduction of the structure group of @xmath60 from @xmath59 to @xmath18 . just as in the non - framed case , @xmath18-framed @xmath4-manifolds with @xmath57 are the @xmath4-morphisms for a symmetric monoidal @xmath16-category @xmath61 , called the @xmath16-category of @xmath18-cobordism .",
    "notice that one can consider an equivalent category of @xmath18-cobordisms , where our manifolds are equipped with a @xmath62-structure on the stable tangent bundle , and its @xmath18-reductions .",
    "the equivalence comes from the fact that @xmath62 is a retract of @xmath59 .",
    "we will implicitly make this identification later on .",
    "+ in particular , when @xmath18 is the trivial group , one writes @xmath55 for @xmath63 , and calls it the @xmath16-category of framed cobordism , while when @xmath18 is @xmath64 one writes @xmath54 for @xmath65 , and calls it the @xmath16-category of oriented cobordism .",

    ". we will use @xmath49 generically to indicate one of these @xmath18-framed versions , unless explicitly specified .    as for any mathematical structure ,",
    "there is a notion of morphisms between @xmath2-category , which are given by @xmath2-functors . informally speaking , an @xmath2functor @xmath66 between two @xmath2categories @xmath5 and @xmath67 is a rule assigning to each @xmath4-morphism in @xmath5 a @xmath4-morphism in @xmath67 in a way respecting sources , targets and ( higher ) compositions .",
    "for instance ,",
    "if one adopts the simplicial model for @xmath68-categories , i.e. , if one looks at @xmath68-categories as simplicial sets with internal horn - filling conditions ( with @xmath4-morphisms corresponding to @xmath4-simplices ) , then an @xmath2-functor between @xmath68-categories is precisely a morphism of simplicial sets .",

    "* chapter 1 ) and @xcite for details .",
    "in particular , given two @xmath2-categories @xmath5 and @xmath67 , we have an @xmath2-category @xmath69 .",
    "it is immediate to see that , if @xmath67 is @xmath1-discrete , then also @xmath69 is @xmath1-discrete ( or , more precisely , it is equivalent to an @xmath1-discrete @xmath2-category ) .",
    "+   + given an @xmath16-category @xmath5 we can obtain an ordinary category @xmath70 , called the _ homotopy category _ of @xmath5 , with objects given by the objects of @xmath5 , and morphisms given by equivalence classes of 1-morphisms up to invertible 2-morphisms in @xmath5 , where invertibility is understood in the @xmath2 setting . similarly , for @xmath71 we can associate to @xmath5 a @xmath4-category @xmath72 , called the _ homotopy @xmath4-category _ of @xmath5 , with objects and morphisms up to @xmath73-morphisms given by those of @xmath5 , and @xmath4-morphisms given by equivalence classes of @xmath4-morphisms up to invertible @xmath11-morphisms . by the usual identification of @xmath4-categories with @xmath4-discrete @xmath2-categories",

    "this is in agreement with the findings in the literature on extended 3-dimensional tqfts , where boundary decorations for a 2-dimensional surface @xmath150 with boundary components are objects in the modular tensor category the tqft associates to @xmath198 @xcite .",
    "as mentioned in the previous section , there is a close relation between boundary conditions for invertible tqfts and anomalous tqfts . in the present section",

    "namely , an anomalous tqft with anomaly @xmath9 contains too little information to determine a boundary condition @xmath14 .",
    "neverthless , in the case of fully extended tqfts the situation is rather different .",
    "the procedure of taking `` cartesian products '' with the constrained interval can be seen as a form of dimensional reduction for manifolds with boundaries .",

    "this argument can be assembled in the following    let @xmath13 be a fully extended invertible @xmath50-dimensional tqft .",
    "any @xmath1-dimensional anomalous tqft @xmath510 with respect to @xmath482 gives rise to a boundary condition @xmath14 of @xmath13 .",

    "notice that if we apply the loop operator to the morphism @xmath525 we obtain a 3-dimensional anomalous tqft extended up to codimension 2 with values in @xmath526 .",
    "+ on the other hand , given a modular tensor category @xmath5 , the reshetikhin - turaev construction also produces an anomalous 3-dimensional tqft extended up to codimension 2 , which we denote by @xmath527 .",
    "it is very tempting then to state the following        in conjecture [ conject ] , reshetikhin - turaev tqft is regarded as an anomalous theory with respect to the 4-dimensional crane - yetter theory , i.e. a natural transformation of ( higher ) functors , rather than a functor on a central extension of @xmath530 . in other words , we trade the additional structures on 1- , 2- , and 3-manifolds needed to define reshetikhin - turaev tqft as functors , as for instance in @xcite , with looking at them as natural transformations .",
    "an interesting playground to test and apply the language and results developed in this article is provided by the quantisation of classical lagrangian field theories , as in @xcite . in this case",
    "the tqft is obtained via a linearisation of the ( higher ) stack of classical fields over @xmath2-categories of groupoid correspondences : we expect therefore the anomalous theory to retain some `` classical '' properties concerning the anomaly .",
    "a particularly amenable situation is given by ( higher ) dijkgraaf - witten theories : indeed , in this case we expect to reproduce the results obtained in @xcite in 3-dimensions , which would provide a purely quantum field theoretic support to the ansatz therein proposed .",
    "+ on a closely related topic , we remark that there is a version of the cobordism hypothesis to incorporate _ defects _ between fully extended tqfts .",
    "indeed , a boundary condition for @xmath13 as presented in this article can be regarded as a defect between the trivial theory and @xmath13 .",
