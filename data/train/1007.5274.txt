    "in this paper , we study the temporal behavior of the distribution of stock prices for 24 stocks in the dow jones industrial average ( djia ) .",
    "this is done using a new method of measuring changes in the volatility and drifts of stocks with time . when this method is applied to time - series constructed from the daily close of stocks , changes as fast as one day",
    "can be seen in both .",
    "given that it is not possible to accurately _ measure _ ( as oppose to _ predict _ ) intraday changes in the volatility using only daily - close data , for two of the 24 stocks we have been able to reach the maximum resolution ( known as the nyquist criteria ) of one day in the rate that the volatility can change , while for the great majority of the remaining stocks , we have come within one day of this maximum .",
    "we believe that this method can measure changes in the volatility and drift that occur during the trading day as well if intraday price data is used . but",
    "even with only daily - close data , we have been extraordinarily successful at determining the temporal behavior of stocks in general , and of the volatility in particular , and in the process , we have furthered our understanding of the behavior of stock prices as a whole .",
    "we find that the stock prices of these 24 stocks can be well described by a stochastic process for which the volatility changes _ deterministically _ with time . on the one hand",
    ", this is a process where the yield at any one time is not correlated with the yield at any other time ; the process thus describes an efficiently priced stock . on the other hand , this is a process where the predicted kurtosis agrees with the sample kurtosis of the stock ; the process thus also provides a solution to the long standing problem of explaining how an efficiently priced stock can have a kurtosis that is so different from what is expected for a gaussian distribution .",
    "indeed , we find that abnormally large kurtoses are due solely to changes in the volatility of the stock with time .",
    "when this temporal behavior is accounted for in the daily yield , the kurtosis reduces dramatically in value , and now agrees well with model predictions .",
    "this finding is in agreement with rosenberg s ( 1972 ) observation that the kurtosis for nonstationary random variables is larger than than the kurtosis of individual random variables .",
    "we have also determined changes in the volatility of these stocks , and for three of the 24 stocks , variations of as fast as one day can be seen . for another 16 stocks ,",
    "this temporal resolution was two days or less , and for only five of the 24 stocks is this resolution longer than 2.5 days .",
    "the behavior of the drifts for all 24 stocks can also be determined using this method , and with the same resolution as their volatility .",
    "we find that the drift for the majority of the stocks is positive ; these drifts thus tend to augment the increase of the stock price caused by the random - walk nature of the stochastic process .",
    "this finding is not surprising , nor is it surprising that we find that the drift is much smaller than the volatility for all 24 stocks .",
    "what is surprising is that for three of the 24 stocks the drift is uniformly _",
    "negative_. for these stocks , the drift tends not to increase the stock price , but to depress it . that the stock price for these three stocks increase at all is because this drift is much smaller in the magnitude than the volatility . over the short term , growth in the prices of these stocksas they are for all 24 stocksis due to a random walk , and thus driven more by the volatility than the drift .",
    "indeed , this is the only reason that the prices of these stocks increase with time .",
    "finally , the distribution of the stock prices for the 24 djia stocks has been determined .",
    "when the temporal variation in the volatility is corrected for in the daily yield , we find that the resultant distribution for all but four of the stocks is described by a rademacher distribution with the probability that the yield increases on any one day being 1/2 .",
    "for the four other stocks , the distribution is described by a generalized rademacher distribution with the probability that the yield increases on any one day being slightly greater than the probability that it decreases .",
    "in 2005 , 403.8 billion shares were traded on the new york stock exchange ( nyse ) with a total value of $ 14.1 trillion dollars ( see nyse ) . during the same period ,",
    "468 million contracts were written on the chicago board options exchange ( cboe ) with a total notional value of $ 12 trillion dollars . at the nyse , traders , investors , and speculatorsbig and smallplace bets on the movement of stock prices , whether up or down .",
    "profits are made , or losses are reconciled , based on the changing price of the stock . as such , great effort is made to predict the movements of stock prices in the future , and thus much attentionwith attending analysisis focused on the price of stocks .    in the cboe ,",
    "traders , investors , and speculators write or enter into contacts to purchase or sell a predetermined amount of stocks at a set time in the future .",
    "profits here are made , or losses reconciled , based on the degree of risk that the movement of the stock will be down when expected to be up , or up when expected to be down . here , it is not so much the price of the stock that matters .",
    "it is the amount of volatility in the stock , and predicting how stock prices may move in the future is much less important .",
    "indeed , the pricing of optionsthrough the black - scholes equation and its variantsis based on the argument that it is _ not _ possible to predict how the price of stocks will change in the future . in this pricing , it is taken for granted that the markets are efficient , and that earning returns which are in excess of the risk - free interest rate is not possible .",
    "all is random , and the increase in stock prices seen is due to a simple random walk with a ( small ) drift .",
    "great interest is thus paid in modeling the _ distribution _ of stock prices , and the application of these models to the pricing of options and derivatives .",
    "given the $ 26.1 trillion dollars in trades and contracts in the nyse and cboe in 2005 , it is not surprising that much effort has been expended in determining the properties of the stock market . given the precipitous drop in stock market prices in october of 2008__which occurred over period of days__accurate determination of how these properties change with time has become even more important . since",
    "the work by bachelier ( 1900 ) at the turn of the 20th century , a great deal of these efforts have been focused on determining the distribution of the daily yields of stock prices ( osborne 1959a and osborne 1959b ) .",
    "inherent in this determination is determining the volatility of the distribution .",
    "use of this volatility is now pervasive in modern finance , and is a critical ingredient in such endeavors as the pricing of options , the general assessment of risk and the determination the value of assets at risk , and the construction of optimal portfolios . that this effort continues today is indicative of the difficulty in determining this distribution , its importance in modern finance , and the financial impact that its determination can have .    while bachelier ( 1990 ) characterized the distribution as a random walk with the prices of the stock having a given drift and a constant volatility , it has been known since the detail analysis of the behavior of stock prices by fama ( 1965 ) that the distribution of daily yields is only approximately gaussian ; the distribution calculated by famawhich does not take into account variations in the volatility with timehas a fatter tail than expected for a gaussian distribution .",
    "indeed , it is typically found that the kurtosis can be as high as 100 , while by comparison the kurtosis of a gaussian distribution is only three .",
    "this discrepancy between the distribution of daily yields as they are traditionally calculated and the gaussian distribution , while seemingly an inconsequential detail , nonetheless has wide - ranging consequences .",
    "mathematics tells us that if the distribution of daily yields of a stock is a gaussian distribution , then the daily yield on any one day can not depend on the daily yield on any other .",
    "this is the central limit theorem ( clt ) , and it is embodied in a number of waysthe various forms of the efficient market hypothesis ( emh ) ( see fama 1970 and fama and french 1988 ) , and the no - arbitrage conditionin modern finance .",
    "this lack of predictability is one of the underlying assumptions used in the pricing of derivatives .",
    "mathematics says we can also turn the statement of the clt around , however .",
    "namely , if the daily yield on any one day does not depend on the daily yield on any other , then the distribution of daily yields must _ necessarily _ be a gaussian distribution as long as the number of days used in its determination is large enough , and as long as the distribution is well behaved .    in the face of this mathematical result , there are two possibilities .",
    "the first possibility is that the distribution of daily yields for stocks is not gaussian .",
    "the daily yield on one day does depend on the daily yield on some other day , and it is possible , in principle , to predict future stock prices by looking at historical prices .",
    "the second possibility is that the emh nevertheless holds , and there are good , albeit unknown , reasons for the unexpectedly large kurtosis .",
    "the situation is further muddied when the autocorrelations of the daily yield of stocks are calculated .",
    "it is well known from these calculations that the value of the daily yield on different days are uncorrelated with each other , and we have seen this behavior for the stocks studied here as well .",
    "this independence extends also to other asset classes , as shown by kendall ( 1953 ) .",
    "there have been numerous attempts at using other distributionsthe levy and its generalization , the pareto , proposed by mandelbrot ( 1963 ) , the student t - distribution proposed by blattberg and gonedes ( 1974 ) , and the discrete mixture of gaussian distributions model proposed by kon ( 1984)to describe the distribution of stock prices ( see tyli , sysi - aho , and kaski 2004 for an overview and assessment ) .",
    "these attempts are based on the belief that the second of the two possibilities holds , and that the reason for the overly large kurtosis is because the distribution used to describe the stock was not correct . as such , for these distributions the daily yield on any one day also does not depend on the daily yield on any other day , and the consequences of the clt is instead evaded in various ways .",
    "these approaches have had various degrees of success .",
    "for example , while the pareto distribution does have a fatter tail than the gaussian distribution and has a kurtosis that can agree with observations , all moments with order greater than an integer @xmath0which determines the power - law behavior of the distributionis ill defined ; in this way , the distribution is not well behaved , and thus does not fall within the class of distributions for which the clt is applicable . for the levy distribution , the volatility itself ( as well as all higher moments ) is ill - defined , requiring the truncation of the distribution to price options using this model , as described in kleinert ( 2002 ) .",
    "the student - t distribution differs significantly from the gaussian distribution only when the number of data points are small ( thereby evading the clt ) , which begs the question of what happens when this distribution is applied to time - series with more than , say , 200 terms in it . kon s model is a of mixture of gaussian distributions , and thus the moments of his distribution are all finite .",
    "however , while the model is effective at describing the large kurtosis of stocks , it is nonetheless an empirical model ; the origin of the discrete mixture is not known , and the parameters used in its construction are determined only after the model is fitted to the stock data .    our approach is also based on the belief that the second of the two possibilities hold .",
    "but unlike the previous attempts at describing the distribution of stock prices mentioned above , we find that the underlying reason for the overly large kurtosis is because time variations in the distribution of stocks have not been properly taken account of .",
    "as observed by rosenberg ( 1972 ) , it is often assumed that the distribution of stock prices being analyzed does not change during the period of interest .",
    "this assumption was certainly made for all the models described above .",
    "in contrast to these approaches , we will take time variations in the distribution explicitly into account .",
    "doing so results in a distribution that can both explain the abnormally kurtosis , and still have the property that the yield on any one day is not correlated with the yield on any other . in the process",
    ", we will also be able to determine , for the first time , how the volatility and the drift changes instantaneously with time .    that the volatility of stocks changes with time is not a new observation .",
    "this behavior has been known since at least the work by osborne ( 1962 ) ( see also lo 1988 ) , and analyzed explicitly by rosenberg ( 1972 ) .",
    "indications of this have been reported by many others since then ( ball and torous 1985 , french and roll 1986 , conrad and kaul 1988 , andersen and bollerslev 1997 , kullmann , tyli , kertesz , kanto , and kaski 1999 , nawroth and peinke 2006 ) .",
    "much effort has since been made to determine how this volatilityand thus necessarily how the distributionchanges with time , with the main focus of this effort on extending the usual random walk description of stock market prices .",
    "this has lead to the introduction of the jump - diffusion model proposed by merton ( 1976 ) , where discrete , random jumps in the prices of a stock in time are incorporated in continuous stochastic processes , and to stochastic volatility models developed over a number of years by praetz ( 1972 ) , christie ( 1982 ) , hull and white ( 1987 ) , scott ( 1987 ) and heston ( 1993 ) where the volatility itself is modeled as a stochastic process with its own drift and volatility ( see also muzy , delour , and bacry 2000 for a multifractal - inspired , stochastic volatility model ) .",
    "however , as it was pointed out by hull and white ( 1987 ) , methods for directly _ measuring _ time - varying volatilities were not , at the time , known .    this inability to directly measure variations in the volatility",
    "has greatly constrained efforts in studying how the volatility of real market data varies with time . to a great extent",
    ", it has also driven the development of stochastic volatility models . by characterizing the volatility as a stochastic process",
    ", a time varying volatility can be modeled using a comparatively simple choice of a constant drift and a constant volatility for the process .",
    "even then , however , parameters in stochastic volatility models are determined not by a direct analysis of the daily yields of stock prices , but are instead determined indirectly .",
    "namely , the price of an option for a stock is calculated for the process in terms of a set of model parameters , and these parameters are then set by adjusting their values until the calculated price agrees with the market price of the option .    the inherent difficulty in determining from market data how a distribution changes with time is described in boyle and anathanarayanan ( 1977 ) , and is straightforward to understand . to determine the distribution of a stock",
    ", a collection of stock prices is required ; the larger the collection , the better .",
    "since stock prices change sequentially in time , this collection has to be done over a period of time , and because a relatively large collection is needed , this period must be correspondingly long .",
    "for example , most distributions are calculated using the daily close of a stock , if for no other reason then because these prices are readily available in the public domain .",
    "if the collection of prices used is as large as 500 daily closes , then the stock prices in this collection must span a period of nearly two years ; fama ( 1965 ) , for example , used stock prices that span a period of up to six years in his analysis . using a collection of 500 stock prices to determine the distribution of the stock through standard methods means that one is tacitly assuming that the price of the stock two years ago belongs to the same distribution__with the same volatility__as the price of the stock today .",
    "this strains credibility , especially given the rapid movements in the markets during the last quarter of 2008 .",
    "while it is possible to calculate the distribution with a fewer number of stock prices and thus shorten the period of time over which they are collected , statistical errors inherent in determining the distribution are proportional to @xmath1 , where @xmath2 are the number of data points in the sample , and will thus be correspondingly larger . at one point ,",
    "the period of time would be so short that we would not be able to say whether distribution is gaussian or not .",
    "indeed , we only have to look at the extreme case where the period is so short that there are only three stock prices collected over three days , resulting in only two daily yields to determine the whole distribution ; this clearly can not be done with any certainty whatsoever ! ( this inherent difficulty has lead to the development of other approaches to calculating volatility such as those found in ball and torous 1984 , parkinson 1980 , and longin 2005 ) where the number of daily close needed is reduced . )",
    "mathematics does not require that the distribution remains constant .",
    "the general theory of stochastic processes allows for volatilities that change with time .",
    "in fact , we will show below that even though the volatility of a gaussian distribution may change with time , the daily yield on any one day need not depend on the daily yield on any previous day ; the emh still holds for this case .",
    "instead , what has been lacking up to now is a method for _ calculating _ the statistical properties of a stock when the volatility changes with time .",
    "this we have been able to do .",
    "our approach is based on the observation that when the volatility depends solely on time , we can remove the time dependence of the distribution by dividing the daily yield by the volatility .",
    "this standardizes the daily yield , and a gaussian distribution with a time - varying volatility is mapped into a gaussian distribution with unit volatility .",
    "the volatility of this distribution is clearly constant , and thus the standardized daily yields all belong to the _ same _ distribution .",
    "the inherent difficulty in determining a distribution that changes with time mentioned above is thus circumvented .",
    "indeed , large collections of stock prices are now a benefitthey result in smaller standard errorsand not a detriment . that the volatility of the mapped distribution is _ known _ then allows us to determine how the volatility of the original daily yield changes with time .",
    "in addition , it is readily apparent from our analysis that the distribution of standardized yields is equivalent to a special case of the binomial distribution , and this observation allows us to extract easily the temporal behavior of the drift of the yield as well .",
    "this approach is straightforward , and at its heart resembles the process one goes through in using a table of values for the cumulative standardized gaussian distribution : the random variable at hand is scaled with its volatility to get the standardized gaussian distribution with unit volatility .",
    "the difference is that in our case the volatility is not know a prior ; it must be determined .",
    "this is done using a combination of statistical methods , fourier analysis , and signal processing techniques . while prevalent in other fields , many of these techniques are not commonly found in the finance or business literature , and it would be easy to become too involved with the mathematics while neglecting the finance when presenting our results . to avoid doing so , we will focus on finance in the main body of the paper , and when our model of stock prices is constructed , it will be motivated by , and justified with , an analysis of the time - series of the stocks at hand .",
    "importantly , a validation of each step taken will made .",
    "only enough of the underlying mathematical analysis needed to explain the essential ideas behind our approach will be presented in the main body of the paper ; we will refer the reader to the appendices for many of the details .",
    "our analysis will be applied explicitly to coca cola stock in this paper to demonstrate the underlying ideas behind the approach .",
    "this stock is chosen out of the 24 because for our purposes its underlying behavior is representative of all the others .",
    "analysis of the other 23 stocks studied here follow in much the same way , and we will only present a summary of the results for them , along with graphs of the volatilities for all 24 stocks as a function of trading day .",
    "it would not be an exaggeration to say that the only characterizations of a stock that is not model dependent is the price per share that it was sold at , the day and time it was sold , and the total number of shares of the stock that was sold over a given period of time .",
    "these are the only characterizations that are objective and verifiable , and for whom all can agree on how they are obtained .",
    "the distribution of the daily yields of a stock certainly is not , and herein lies the problem : how should any model of stock prices be validated ?    to see how difficult the problem of validation is to resolve ( this issue was explicitly studied by magdon - ismail and abu - mostafa 1998 for volatility models ) , consider the volatility of the 24 stocks considered here . as we will calculate the volatility of these stocks",
    ", it would seem that a comparison of the volatilities we obtain here with the volatilities calculated using any one of the many other approaches in the literature would be an effective way of assessing the validity of our model .",
    "however , irrespective of the approach taken to make this calculation , assumptions about the behavior of the stock will have already been made .",
    "the historical volatility , for example , uses a moving average to calculate the volatility on any given trading day .",
    "it implicitly assumes that the volatility does not change significantly over the window of time used when calculating the average , and thus can not effectively measure changes in the volatility that occur within this window .",
    "the implicit volatility , developed over a series of papers by latan and rendleman ( 1976 ) , schmalensee and trippi ( 1978 ) , and beckers ( 1981 ) , can measure instantaneous changes in the volatility , but it is calculated by inverting the black - scholes ( or any other ) equation for pricing options , and thus implicitly assumes that the particular pricing equation used accurately prices the option at any given time .",
    "autoregression approaches to calculating the volatilitysuch as the exponentially weighted moving average ( ewma ) , the autoregregressive conditional heteroskedasticity ( arch ) proposed by engle ( 1982 ) , the generalized autoregregressive conditional heteroskedasticity ( garch ) proposed by bollerslev ( 1986 ) , and a new approach that combines autoregressive and fourier ( spectral ) analysis techniques proposed by bollerslev and wright ( 2001)are designed more to _ manage _ volatilities that change with time than to _ characterize _ them .",
    "they depend on one or more parameters that must subsequently be set using some property of a stock , and are not designed to _ determine _ how the volatility changes .",
    "stochastic volatility models explicitly consider volatilities that change ( randomly ) with time , but to determine how this volatility changes , the approach adjusts the parameters that determine the volatility until the predicted option prices agree with market prices ( see lamoureux and lastrapes 1993 for a test of this approach ) . using a comparison of volatilities to validate models is therefore more a comparison of the underlying models of the market or methods of calculation than it is of the volatilities themselves . indeed , the question of which approach to calculating",
    "the volatility is the better one is one that has been address many times over the years ( see day and lewis 1992 , canina and figlewski 1993 , jorion 1995 , figlewski 1997 , andersen and bollerslev 1998 , chong , ahmad , and abdullah 1999 , szakmary , ors , kim , and davidson ii 2003 , and mcmillan and speight 2004 ) , apparently without consensus .",
    "this difficulty in validating models is particularly inopportune here .",
    "while many of the techniques we have used in this paper has been long used in other fields , our approach in this paper is novel , and have not been used in the analysis of stock market prices before .",
    "we therefore take a particularly stringent approach to validating our model .",
    "first , the model must be able to explain the observed properties of the stocks .",
    "this we accomplish by construction .",
    "properties of the stock price are presented _ first _ , and the model is then constructed explicitly to describe them .",
    "second , the model must be self - consistent , and must be able to predict some property the stock price , which can subsequently be verified .",
    "all models of stock market prices make a certain set of underlying assumptions about properties of the price ; these assumptions have consequences .",
    "these consequences can in turn be used to predict properties of the stock price that can then be used to validate it . for our model ,",
    "the distribution of standardized daily yields is described by a rademacher distribution or its generalization .",
    "this distribution gives specific values for the population skewness and kurtosis , and they provide a simple and statistically meaningful approach to validating our model .",
    "specifically , we calculate the sample skewness and kurtosis from each stock s time - series .",
    "we then compare this sample skewness and kurtosis to the population skewness and kurtosis predicted by our model .",
    "if the sample skewness and kurtosis agree with the population skewness and kurtosis of our model at the 95% confidence level ( cl ) , we assert that our model is valid .",
    "in fact , we find that this agreement holds for all 24 stocks considered here , and it does so over the whole of the time period spanned by their time series . indeed , for a number of the stocks , _ this period spans over 80 years_.    it is because of this operational approach to validating our model that we chose to analyzed stocks from the djia",
    ". first , all the stocks in the djia are large caps , and have a large daily trading volume ; they are precisely the type of stocks for which we expect the market to be efficient .",
    "they are in this way similar , and we would expect they can be described by the same type of model .",
    "second , each of these companies has been publicly traded for a number of years .",
    "we therefore have access to a large collection of daily close prices for these stocks with which to construct their time - series . these time series , for example , range in time from as short as 5,090 trading days for citigroup , to as long as 21,527 trading days for exxon - mobil .",
    "the availability of a large sample of daily close is particularly important as we will be numerically assessing the validity of each step in the construction of our model . with such large collections of stock prices , standard errors in our calculation",
    "can be as small as 0.7% , and as such , we are able to say with a great deal of certainty whether or not our approach is self - consistent .",
    "third , the 24 chosen were the simplest , in terms of their ownership , of the 30 stocks listed in the djia .",
    "the six djia not chosen were recently involved in mergers or acquisitions , which introduces unwanted complications ; an assessment of the temporal of these stock prices may not be as clear cut as the 24 stocks considered here .",
    "a detailed description of how the time - series are constructed is given in appendix @xmath3 , where any particularities in the analysis of stocks are listed as well .",
    "a list of these stocks given in terms of their stock symbol is presented in table i along with the starting date of the time - series and the total number of daily yields in each .",
    "the ending date for all 24 time - series is december 29 , 2006 .",
    "we begin our study of the temporal behavior of stock market prices with an application to finance .",
    "specifically , for the 24 stocks considered here we study whether the daily yield on december 29 , 2006 depends on the daily yield on any day previous to it .",
    "this property of the market , which has direct implications in finance , will be used as the starting point for the construction of our model of stock prices .",
    "indications of an efficiently priced stock    shown in fig .",
    "@xmath4 is a graph of the autocorrelation function of the daily yield for coca cola using eq .",
    "@xmath5 from the appendix @xmath6 .",
    "this autocorrelation is calculated between the daily yield of the stock on december 29 , 2006 , and the daily yield @xmath7 days _ before _ the 29th .",
    "the graph thus shows the dependency of the yield on the 29th on the yield on any previous day .",
    "if the yield on the 29th depends on the yield on day @xmath7 , then the autocorrelation function will not vanish on that day at the 95% cl .",
    "if , on the other hand , the yield on the 29th does not depend on the yield on day @xmath7 , then the autocorrelation function will be within statistical error of zero .",
    "also shown on the graph in fig .",
    "@xmath4 is the errorbar for each of the calculated values of the autocorrelation function .",
    "these errorbars are set at the 95% cl , which is @xmath8 times the standard error calculated using eq .",
    "@xmath9 for the autocorrelation function on that day .",
    "they thus set the 95% confidence interval ( ci ) about the calculated value for the autocorrelation function .",
    "if the value of the autocorrelation function falls within its errorbar of zero , there is a 95% probability that the autocorrelation on this day equals zero . with 21,522 total trading days in the time - series for coca cola ,",
    "the standard error for the values of the autocorrelation function shown in the graph is roughly 0.7% , and is thus quite small ; the errorbars shown are correspondingly small . the standard error for the majority of the stocks studied here are equally small .",
    "all but one of the errorbars for the autocorrelation shown in fig .",
    "@xmath4 straddles the @xmath10-axis . as such",
    ", we can say that the value of the autocorrelation function for @xmath11 is within a 95% cl of zero for all but one day . indeed ,",
    "when we continue this calculation all the way back to december 31 , 1925 , the starting date for the time - series , we find that the autocorrelation function for the daily yield on 20,279 out of a total of 21,522 trading days fall within the 95% ci of zero ; the autocorrelation function on 1,243 trading days , or 6% of the trading days , fall outside of the 95% ci ( see table i ) .",
    "this does not necessarily mean that there is a correlation between the 29th and these 1,243 trading days , however .",
    "statistically , we would expect values of the autocorrelation function to exceed the 95% ci on 5% , or 1,076 , of the trading days .",
    "we can only conclude that on at least 1% , or 215 , of the trading days the autocorrelation function does not vanish for @xmath11 .",
    "if instead a 99% ci in chosen , we find that the value of the autocorrelation function falls within the 99% ci of zero for 21,172 out of 21,522 trading days ; they fall outside of the 99% ci on only 2% , or 350 , of the trading days .",
    "we can therefore still conclude that for at least 1% , or 215 , of the trading days the autocorrelation function may not vanish for @xmath11 .",
    "the autocorrelation function of the daily yield for all 24 stocks have been calculated for the length their time - series , and we have found that the autocorrelation function for these stocks behave similarly to coca cola s .",
    "namely , the autocorrelation function is maximum at @xmath12 , and it does not vanish for at least 1% to 3% of the trading days for each stock ; for citigroup and verizon , this percentage is even lower .",
    "we may conclude from this analysis that for the vast majority of the time the daily yield of these stocks on any one day is not correlated with the daily yield on any subsequent day ; the market is thus extremely efficient for these 24 stocks . in addition , we will show below that for the 1% to 3% of the trading days when the autocorrelation function does not vanish , this is due to changes in the volatility of the stock with time , and not to correlations between daily yields .",

    "indeed , this limit is the reason why binomial trees are effective in the first place .      in this subsection",
    ", we will determine the drift of the standardized daily yield as a function of time .",
    "we do so by noting that it is apparent from fig .",
    "@xmath125 that the distribution of standardized daily yields is a binomial distribution .",
    "thus , at each time step , @xmath53 , there is a probability , @xmath134 , that the standardized yield will increase by an amount @xmath136 on that day , and probability , @xmath135 , that it will decrease by an amount @xmath137 . while in principle @xmath134 may be different at different time steps , the fact that @xmath136 and @xmath137 change in unison while keeping the average distance between position and negative standardized yields constant suggests that any variation in time is due to an overall shift in the distribution .",
    "variations in @xmath136 and @xmath137 are not due to a time - dependent @xmath134 , but rather to a drift for the standardized yield that changes with time .    with this realization , the drift can easily be determined for all 24 stocks . from eqs.@xmath47 and @xmath138",
    ", we can express the standardized daily yield as @xmath139 where @xmath140 is the discretized drift of the standardized yield , and @xmath141 is a random variable with zero mean and unit volatility such that @xmath142 = \\delta_{nm}$ ] . while for the continuous process @xmath143 would be a gaussian random variable , for the discrete process we will show that @xmath141 is a random variable for the generalized rademacher distribution described below .",
    "the standard way of calculating @xmath144 is to use a moving average over a window of @xmath145 days .",
    "however , just like for the volatility , calculating @xmath144 with a moving average will mean that variations in the drift faster than @xmath145 can not be clearly seen .",
    "we will instead calculate @xmath144 directly from @xmath71 , which is possible to do because the distribution of standardized yield is so simple .",
    "we first note that since changes to @xmath136 and @xmath137 is due to shifts in the distribution of standardized yield with time , these shifts must be due to the drift , @xmath144 , of the standardized yield .",
    "shifts in random variables are trivial changes to the distribution , however , and a drift that changes with time will not materially change the distribution of standardized yields .",
    "we next note that @xmath146 = 0 $ ] . as the values of @xmath71 lie close to @xmath147",
    ", we conclude that @xmath141 can only take the values @xmath148 .",
    "any deviation by @xmath149 from @xmath150 must be due to the drift .",
    "this drift can be determined by solving the equation @xmath151 for @xmath144 by taking the sign of @xmath141 to be the same as the sign of @xmath71 .",
    "this solution is straightforwardly implemented , and the results for coca cola is shown in fig .",
    "@xmath125c . for clarity",
    ", we have only shown the values of the drift between @xmath152 .",
    "while there are values that lie outside of this range , they occur in the first 10 time steps in the series , and are part of the transient behavior mentioned above .",
    "the drift for the standardized yield of all 24 stocks have be found using this approach . not surprisingly , we find that 21 out of the 24 stocks have a drift that positive for the great majority of the time - series .",
    "what is surprising is that for three of the 24 stocks ( exxon - mobil , merck , and proctor and gamble ) the drift of the yield of the stock is _ negative _ outside the transient region .",
    "for these stocks , the only reason why their price increases is due to the random walk , and because the volatility is so much greater than the drift .",
    "while in the last subsection we determined the drift of the daily yield , in this subsection we will show that the distribution of the standardized daily yield is a generalized rademacher distribution shifted by the drift , @xmath144 .",
    "this will be done by comparing the skewness and kurtosis of the rademacher distribution with the sample skewness and kurtosis for @xmath71 after the drift has been removed .",
    "we will show that the two agree at the 95% cl , and doing so will both determine the distribution and validate our model of stock market prices as a stochastic process with a time - dependent volatility .",
    "we begin by describing the properties of the generalized rademacher distribution .",
    "a generalize rademacher distribution consists of a random variable , @xmath153 , that takes the value @xmath127 with probability @xmath134 , and the value @xmath128 with probability @xmath135 .",

    "when @xmath166 , we call this the generalized rademacher distribution .    given the plot in fig .",
    "@xmath125b , we would expect that the distribution of standardized yields to be a rademacher distribution with @xmath167 at all time steps . to show that that this is the case , we have calculated the sample skewness and the kurtosis of the standardized yield after the drift , @xmath144 , has been removed from @xmath71 .",
    "this has been done for all 24 stocks using the entire time - series for each .",
    "we then compared these sample skewness and kurtosis with the population skewness and kurtosis for the rademacher distribution using the t - test . for completeness",
    ", we have also calculated the probability , @xmath134 , for each stock by counting the total number of @xmath168 , and compared it to the rademacher value of @xmath167 using the chi - squared test .",
    "the results of these calculations and tests are given in table iii .",

    "with @xmath21 now known and the drift for the standardized daily yield obtained previously , the drift for the daily yield , @xmath267 , can be found for all 24 stocks using the discretized version of eq .",
    "@xmath68 , @xmath268 , where the @xmath21 is the instantaneous volatility obtained above .",
    "since @xmath269 for all 24 stocks , @xmath270 .",
    "thus for all of the 24 stocks , the drift of the stock is smaller than the volatility of it .",
    "this is to be expected .",
    "if the drift of a stock is larger than the volatility , then future trends in the stock can be predicted with a certain degree of certainty ; the drift is , after all , a _ deterministic _ function of time . such trends could be seen by investors , and nearly riskless profits could be made .",
    "this clearly does not happen .",
    "it is instead very difficult to discern future trends in the price of stocks , and this is precisely because the volatility of the stock is so large .    the instantaneous volatility for the djia stocks , i    the instantaneous volatility for the djia stocks , ii",
    "as a continuous process , we have found that the 24 djia stocks can be described as a stochastic process with a volatility that changes deterministically with time .",
    "it is a process for which the autocorrelation function of the yield vanishes at different times , and thus one that describes a stock whose price is efficiently priced . from the results of our calculation of the autocorrelation function of the daily yield for the 24 stocks ,",
    "this property of our stochastic process is in very good agreement with how these stocks are priced by the market .",
    "it is also a process for which the solution of the stochastic differential can be , at least formally , solved .",
    "this solution is valid only because the volatility is a deterministic function of time , however .",
    "if the volatility is depends on the stock price , or if the volatility itself is a stochastic process , the solution of the stochastic differential equation will not be so simple , and the autocorrelation function need not vanish at different times .",
    "it is , however , only after using the discretized stochastic process that we are able to validate our model . after correcting for the variability of the volatility by using the standardized daily yield",
    ", we have shown that for all 24 stocks the distribution of standardized daily yields is well described by the general rademacher distribution . indeed , we found that the abnormally large kurtosis is due to a volatility that changes with time . for 20 of the 24 stocks , the sample skewness , kurtosis , and probability distribution agrees with a rademacher distribution where @xmath167 at the 95% cl ; the probability that these stocks will increase on any one day is thus equal to the probability that it will decrease .",
    "the other four stocks agree with a generalized rademacher distribution and have a @xmath134 slightly greater than @xmath218 .",
    "for these stocks , the probability that the yield will increase on any one day is slightly higher than the probability that it will decrease .",
    "we conclude that our model is a very good description of the behavior of these stocks .    that the kurtosis for the standardized daily yield is smaller than the kurtosis for the daily yield is in agreement with the results found by rosenberg ( 1972 ) .",
    "the daily yield is time dependent , and is thus a nonstationary random variable , while for the standardized daily yield , the time dependence due to the volatility has been taken account of .",
    "indeed , in many ways rosenberg ( 1972 ) presages the results of this work .    by combining the properties of our continuous stochastic process for the stocks with noise removal techniques , we have been able to determine the time dependence of both the volatility and the drift of all 24 stocks . unlike the implied volatility",
    ", the volatility obtained here was obtained from the daily close directly without the need to fit parameters to the market price of options .",
    "the theory is thus self - contained . for alcoa , caterpillar , and johnson&johnson",
    ", the time dependence of the volatility can be determined down to a resolution of a single trading day , while for another 13 stocks , they can be determined to a resolution of less than 1 1/2 trading days .",
    "while other , more sophisticated signal analysis techniques can be used , given that the time - series is based on the daily close and thus the resolution is ultimately limited to a period of two trading days , we do not expect that it will be possible to dramatically improve on these results .",
    "only when intraday price data is used will we expect significant improvement to this resolution . indeed , with intraday data we expect that changes to the volatility that occur during the trading day can be seen .",
    "we have deliberately used large cap stocks in our analysis , and we take care to note that this approach to the analysis of the temporal behavior of stocks have only been shown to be valid for the 24 stocks we analyzed here . while we would expect it to be applicable to other large - cap stocks , whether our approach will also be valid when applied to mid- or small - cap stocks is still an open question .",
    "indeed , it will be interesting to see the range of stocks for which the volatility depends solely on time .    with both the drift and the volatility determined down nearly to the single trading day level for most of the stocks , it is now be possible to calculate the autocorrelation function for both , as will as the correlation function between the drift and the volatility .",
    "in particular , the degree of influence that the volatility or drift on any one day has on the volatility or drift on any future day can be determined .",
    "this analysis is currently being done .",
    "the time - series for the 24 djia stocks analyzed here were obtained from the center for research in stock prices ( crsp ) .",
    "while the ending date for each series is december 29 , 2006 , the choice of the starting date is often different for different stocks .",
    "this choice of starting dates was not governed by a desire for uniformity , but rather by the desire to include as many trading days in the time series as possible , and thereby minimize standard errors .",
    "in addition , by maximizing the number of trading days included , we also demonstrate that our model is valid over the entire period for which the prices of the stock are available .",
    "although the daily close of stocks between the starting and ending dates are used as the basis of the time - series ( with dividends included in the price ) , a series of adjustments to the crsp data were made when the series were constructed .",
    "if the closing price of stock is listed by crsp as a negative numberan indication that the closing price was not available on that day , and the average of the last bid and ask prices was used insteadwe took the positive value of this number as the daily close on that day . if no record of the daily close was given for a particular trading day at allan indication that the bidding and asking prices were also not available for that datewe used the average of the closing price of the stock on the day preceding and the day following as the daily close for that day .",
    "next , the daily close of the stock prices were scaled to adjust for splits in the stock . for example , although the daily close for coca cola on december 12 , 1925 is listed by crsp as $ 153.625 , this price was scaled by a factor of 6745.134 to account for the accumulated splits that the stock has gone through since 1925 .",
    "the price recorded in the time - series is instead 0.022776 .",
    "because of this scale factor , the prices of stocks are listed in all time - series to an accuracy of at least @xmath271 to ensure that the daily close on any day can be reconstructed from the time - series .",
    "this level of accuracy or higher was then used in all the calculations in this paper .",
    "while we could have avoided this subtlety by scaling the daily close , $ 48.25 , of the stock on december , 29 , 2006 by @xmath272 , doing so would result in stock prices that are $ 300k , which is deceivingly large .    finally , from eq .",
    "@xmath88 we see that @xmath65 vanishes if @xmath64 vanishes , and yet from eq .",
    "@xmath273 , it is implicit that the quotient @xmath274 must be well defined .",
    "indeed , the reduction of eq .",
    "@xmath38 to eq .",
    "@xmath47 is only valid if @xmath21 is nowhere zero . in practice , there are trading days on which the daily yield vanishes ; for coca cola , this occurred 2070 out of a total of 21,523 trading days . to ensure that @xmath274 is well defined on these days ,",
    "we have added to the daily close a random number less than @xmath275 if the close on successive days are equal .",
    "this is done before the daily close is scaled to adjust for stock splits . since the stock price changes by at least $ 0.01 increments , doing so does not materially change the stock price , while still insuring that @xmath276 .",
    "we have not adjusted for inflation in our time - series , nor have we accounted for weekends , holidays , or any other days on which trading did not take place .",
    "we have instead concatenated the daily close on each trading day , one after another , when constructing the time - series .",
    "the time - series are thus a sequence of _ trading _ days , and not calendar days . while this concatenation is natural , issues of bias such as those studied by fleming , kirby , and ostdiek ( 2006 ) have not been taken into account .",
    "whether these issues are relevant for the stocks considered here we leave for further study .",
    "our focus is instead on the gross features of the stock price .",
    "finally , we list here the following particularities that occurred in our analysis of the 24 djia stocks .    _",
