    "<S> in addition , the spin texture in the case of the anisotropic so coupling is also investigated @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we further prove that the m - pcv are stable through the dynamic evolution of the spin texture @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we now consider the interplay between the so coupling and the interaction , due to the coupling of the spin of a particle with its motion induced by magnetic pulses and the transformation of magnetic order induced by the interaction , which leads to the rich phase diagrams of the monopoles . for a given @xmath56 being -75 , the phase diagram as functions of @xmath57 and @xmath62 </S>",
    "<S> is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 5(a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the monopole is metastable when @xmath57 is less than a critical value @xmath63 . for @xmath64 , </S>",
    "<S> the m - pcv exist when @xmath65 and @xmath66 , while the m - mhv emerge when @xmath67 and @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that a cyclic phase transition from the m - pcv to the m - mhv can occur with the increasing @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> note that if there is no the so coupling , such the cyclic phase transition will not occur . </S>",
    "<S> the m - sl occur when @xmath69 , confirming that at strong so coupling the monopoles are not affected by the interactions and can exist in the wide parameter region . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the phase diagram as functions of @xmath57 and @xmath56 for a given @xmath62 being 7500 is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 5(b ) . for @xmath64 , there exists the m - mhv when @xmath56 is less than 60 , while the m - pcv emerge when @xmath56 is more than 60 . </S>",
    "<S> this result suggests that the increasing the spin - dependent interaction only leads to the direct phase transition from the m - mhv to m - pcv .    </S>",
    "<S> we finally briefly discuss the experimental feasibility of creating the monopoles in so coupled becs ( see supplemental material @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> we consider spin-1 becs of alkali @xmath13rb atoms , where particle number @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> first of all , a quadrupole field is applied and turned on , which is realized by a pair of helmholtz coils . </S>",
    "<S> then , when a point source of the superfluid flow is formed @xcite , the quadrupole field is turned off . </S>",
    "<S> the pulsed magnetic fields are turned on , which creates two - dimensional so coupling @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we take some parameters from the recent experiments @xcite , which includes the isotropic optical trap @xmath71hz , the anisotropic optical trap @xmath72 hz and @xmath73 hz , the constant bias magnetic field @xmath74 g , and the quadrupole field gradient @xmath75 t / m . for the m - pcv , the so coupling strength @xmath76 . </S>",
    "<S> we find the dynamic period of the monopoles @xmath77 , which is much shorter than the lifetime of the becs and can be observed stably in experiments .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have shown that the weak so coupling leads to the emergence of the m - pcv that are stable and long - lived , and the strong so coupling leads to the emergence of the m - sl in spinor becs . </S>",
    "<S> we have predicted the rich phase diagrams of the monopoles by changing the so coupling strength , the spin - dependent interaction , and the spin - independent interaction . </S>",
    "<S> such monopoles can be proved by means of imaging the vortex lines in a real experiment . </S>",
    "<S> this work paves the way for future explorations of the monopole with respect to gauge field , topological defects and the corresponding dynamical stability in quantum systems .    </S>",
