    "long - lived @xmath17 states are especially well suited for testing qcd via lattice calculations @xcite and effective theories of strong interactions , like potential models @xcite . the narrow triplet @xmath18 states , @xmath7 , @xmath19 and @xmath1 , were discovered in 1977 in proton - nucleus collisions at fermilab @xcite .",
    "later , they were better resolved and studied at various @xmath8 storage rings .",
    "six triplet @xmath20 states , @xmath21 and @xmath22 with @xmath23 , were discovered in radiative decays of the @xmath1 and @xmath19 in 1982 @xcite and 1983 @xcite , respectively .",
    "there has been no observations of new narrow @xmath24 states since then despite the large number of such states predicted below the open flavor threshold ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : level ] ) .    in this paper , we present the first observation of the @xmath2 states . except for the yet unobserved @xmath25 states , these are the only long - lived @xmath26 mesons in nature .",
    "they are produced in a two - photon cascade starting from the @xmath1 resonance : @xmath27 , @xmath28 .",
    "to suppress photon backgrounds from @xmath29s , which are copiously produced in gluonic annihilation of the @xmath17 states , we select events with two more subsequent photon transitions , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , followed by the @xmath7 annihilation to either @xmath8 or @xmath9 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : level ] ) .",
    "the product branching ratio for these five decays in sequence was predicted by godfrey and rosner @xcite to be @xmath32 .",
    "the cleo iii experiment has recently accumulated @xmath0 @xmath1 decays , which makes the detection of such rare processes possible .",
    "the cleo iii sample constitutes roughly a ten - fold increase in @xmath1 statistics compared to the cleo ii data set @xcite , and roughly a four - fold increase compared to the integrated cusb data set @xcite .",
    "thanks to the good granularity and the large solid angle of the cleo csi(tl ) calorimeter , the cleo iii detection efficiency for these final states is about 4.5 times larger than in the cusb detector . even though the cleo iii calorimeter is essentially the same as in the cleo ii detector @xcite , the photon selection efficiency and detector resolution were improved in the endcaps and in part of the barrel calorimeter by the installation of a new , lower - mass , tracking system @xcite .",
    "another change was the replacement of the time - of - flight system by a rich detector in the barrel part .",
    "finally , the calorimeter endcaps were restacked and moved farther away from the interaction point to accommodate a new , higher luminosity , interaction point optics .",
    "we select events with exactly four photons and two oppositely charged leptons .",
    "the leptons must have momenta of at least 3.75 gev/@xmath33 .",
    "we distinguish between electrons and muons by their energy deposition in the calorimeter .",
    "electrons must have a high ratio of energy observed in the calorimeter to the momentum measured in the tracking system ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "muons are identified as minimum ionizing particles , and required to leave @xmath35 mev of energy in the calorimeter .",
    "stricter muon identification does not reduce background in the final sample , since all significant background sources contain muons .",
    "each photon must have at least 60 mev of energy .",
    "we also ignore all photons below 180 mev in the calorimeter region closest to the beam , because of the spurious photons generated by beam - related backgrounds .",
    "the total momentum of all photons and leptons in each event must be balanced to within 300 mev/@xmath33 .",
    "the invariant mass of the two leptons must be consistent with the @xmath7 mass within @xmath36 mev/@xmath14 .",
    "much better identification of the @xmath7 resonance is obtained by measuring the mass of the system recoiling against the four photons .",
    "the average resolution of the recoil mass is 17 mev/@xmath14 .",
    "cuts on the recoil mass are described below .",
    "the mass resolution of the produced @xmath2 state depends on the measurement of the energies of the two lowest energy photons in the event .",
    "thus , we require that at least one of them is detected in the barrel part of the calorimeter , where the energy resolution is best .",
    "the energy resolution as determined by the fit to the @xmath27 photon lines is @xmath37 mev for @xmath38 mev @xcite .",
    "the most prominent signal among @xmath39 decays are @xmath16 transitions . to identify these decays",
    ", we try all three combinations of four photons into two - photon pairs .",
    "we find the minimal @xmath29 mass deviation chi - squared among these combinations : @xmath40 ^ 2 + [ ( m_{\\gamma\\gamma}^{kl}-m_{\\pi^0})/\\sigma_{m_{\\gamma\\gamma}^{kl}}]^2\\right\\}$ ] . after the requirement @xmath41 , the deviation of the four - photon recoil mass from the @xmath7 mass , @xmath42 , is found .",

    "we obtain the following result for the product branching ratio : @xmath48 .",
    "the first error is statistical and the second is systematic .",

    ", we also present the analysis of the two - photon cascades between the @xmath1 and the @xmath7 or @xmath19 . branching ratios for two - photon cascades via @xmath57 and @xmath58 states",
    "were determined with improved precision compared to previous experiments .",
    "these data , together with the @xmath59 transitions , were used to obtain the calibration of absolute photon energies in the @xmath60 mev range . using the well known masses of the @xmath7 , @xmath19 and @xmath1 @xcite , together with",
    "the recoil mass distributions like the one shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mdrpi0pi0 ] , we calibrated the photon energies to a precision of @xmath61 .",
    "the photon energies observed in the two - photon cascade data for @xmath27 agreed well with the previous measurements .",
    "thus , the systematic effects in both rate and photon energy measurements are well under control .",
    "to look for four - photon cascades between the @xmath1 and @xmath7 , we must suppress backgrounds from the @xmath59 transitions .",
    "we first require , @xmath62 . in addition",
    ", every photon pair must have an invariant mass at least two standard deviations away from the nominal @xmath29 mass .    to look for @xmath2 events , we constrain events to be consistent with a photon cascade from the @xmath1 to the @xmath7 via one of the @xmath21 and one of the @xmath22 states ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "the masses of the @xmath20 states are well known from other measurements @xcite . for each @xmath64 ,",
    "@xmath65 combination we calculate a chi - squared : @xmath66 where @xmath67 are the measured photon energies ; @xmath68 are the expected photon energies from the masses of the @xmath17 states and the measured photon directions in the cascade .",
    "the masses of the @xmath2 states are not know .",
    "therefore , we minimize the above chi - squared with respect to @xmath69 which is allowed to vary for each event .",
    "the above formalism requires that we know how to order the four photons in the cascade . while the highest energy photon must be due to the fourth transition , and the second highest energy photon must be due to the third transition , there is sometimes an ambiguity in the assignment of the two lowest energy photons to the first two transitions , since the range of photon energies in the @xmath27 decay overlaps the possible photon energy range in the @xmath28 transition .",
    "we choose the combination that minimizes the above chi - squared .",
    "there are nine possible combinations of @xmath64 , @xmath65 spins .",
    "we try all of them and choose the one that produces the smallest chi - squared , @xmath70 .",
    "in addition to the four - photon cascade via the @xmath2 states , our data contain events with the four - photon cascade via the @xmath19 state : @xmath27 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath31 , @xmath73 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : level ] ) .",
    "this is a coincidence of the two - photon cascades , @xmath74 and @xmath75 , which were experimentally observed in the two - photon cascades detected in the @xmath1 @xcite and @xmath19 data @xcite .",
    "the product branching ratio for this entire decay sequence ( including @xmath73 ) is predicted by godfrey and rosner @xcite to be @xmath76 , thus comparable to the predicted @xmath2 production rate . combining the measured rates for @xmath77 @xcite and @xmath78 @xcite with the measurement of @xmath79 @xcite",
    ", we obtain a factor @xmath80 higher value . in these events , the second highest energy photon is due to the second photon transition ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : level ] ) .",
    "unfortunately , these events can be sometimes confused with the @xmath2 events due to the limited experimental energy resolution .",
    "the second and third photon transitions in the @xmath19 cascade sequence can be mistaken for the third and second transition in the @xmath2 cascade sequence .",
    "therefore , it is important to suppress the @xmath19 cascades . we achieve this by finding the @xmath64 , @xmath65 combination that minimizes the associated chi - squared for the @xmath19 hypothesis , @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is exactly analogous to @xmath83 with the @xmath69 replaced with @xmath84 .",
    "we then require @xmath85 .",
    "notice that the masses of all intermediate states are known for the @xmath19 cascade , thus this variable is more constraining than @xmath83 . to further suppress the @xmath19 cascade events , we construct a quasi - chi - squared variable , @xmath86 , that sums in quadrature only positive deviations of the measured photon energies from their expected values .",
    "this variable is less sensitive to fluctuations in the longitudinal and transverse energy leakage in photon showers that sometimes produce large negative energy deviations and correspondingly a large @xmath82 value . with the additional cut @xmath87 ,",
    "the cross - efficiency for @xmath19 events is reduced to 0.7%  and is further suppressed by a factor of two when a cut of @xmath88 is required .    the data @xmath83 distribution , after we require the four - photon recoil mass to be between @xmath89 and @xmath90 standard deviations from the nominal @xmath7 mass , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : chiddata ] .",
    "a narrow peak near zero is observed , just as expected for @xmath2 events . the signal monte carlo distribution for @xmath2 events is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : chidmc ] .",
    "the background monte carlo distribution for the @xmath19 cascades , after a factor of 10 enhancement relative to the @xmath2 normalization , is also shown for comparison .",
    "clearly , the @xmath19 cascade background can not produce as narrow a peak as observed in the data .",
    "the estimate of the number of @xmath19 cascade events passing the @xmath88 requirement is @xmath91 events ( depending on the assumed @xmath19 product branching ratio ) .",
    "we observe 44 events after this cut in the data .",
    "the cross - efficiency for @xmath59 events is @xmath92 in this sample , which gives a negligible contribution to the signal region .",
    "a flat tail in the @xmath83 distribution for the data , not observed for the signal monte carlo , indicates that there is still some background present from other processes like radiative qed events .",
    "since such processes can satisfy the multiple mass constraints built into the @xmath83 variable only by a random coincidence , the distribution of that background varies slowly in @xmath83 except for the bias towards lower values introduced by the @xmath83 minimization with respect to @xmath69 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "we use the @xmath16 monte carlo ( with the @xmath29 veto cuts removed ) as a model of the @xmath83 distribution for this background component ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : chidp0p0fit ] ) .",
    "normalization of this background is fixed from the observed tail of the @xmath83 distribution .",
    "this shape is likely to overestimate the amount of bias in @xmath83 towards the lower values since , unlike the @xmath16 process , the qed backgrounds do not automatically satisfy the @xmath93 mass constraint built into the chi - squared variable .",
    "therefore , we also used a linear background model , with the line parameters fixed by a fit to the tail of the @xmath83 distribution . depending on the background shape model , the @xmath88 sample has a @xmath94 background rate ( including the @xmath19 cascade background ) .",
    "a fit of the @xmath2 signal , on top of the backgrounds , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : chidfit ] .",
    "the @xmath19 background contribution was fixed from the monte carlo simulations .",
    "normalization of the other backgrounds was left as a free parameter in the fit .",
    "the fit gives a signal amplitude of @xmath95 events .",
    "if we try to fit the data with the background contribution alone , the likelihood value of the fit drops dramatically . from the change of the likelihood we estimate that the signal has a significance of 9.7 standard deviations .",
    "significant signals are observed in the @xmath96 and @xmath97 subsamples taken separately ( @xmath98 and @xmath99 , respectively ) .",
    "to turn the observed signal yield into a signal branching ratio , we need to estimate the signal efficiency .",
    "even though the signal shape in the @xmath83 variable is fairly independent of the masses and spins of the produced @xmath2 states , the selection efficiency does depend on these parameters via the cuts used to suppress the @xmath19 cascade background .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : effvsmass ] , where we plot the selection efficiency as a function of the mass of the @xmath2 state .",
    "three different curves are presented , for @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "the @xmath102 state is predicted by godfrey and rosner @xcite to be produced with the highest rate , @xmath103 .",
    "the @xmath104 , @xmath105 combination is predicted to be the main production and decay path for this state .",
    "the selection efficiency for the @xmath102 state gradually increases with its mass , but is reasonably high in the entire search window .",
    "the @xmath106 state , predicted with a @xmath107 rate , can only be produced via the @xmath108 , @xmath109 combination due to angular momentum conservation .",
    "this happens to be an unfortunate combination , since for a wide range of masses such a production fakes the @xmath19 cascade , and the detection efficiency after the @xmath19 suppression cuts is very low .",
    "we become sensitive to this state only if its mass exceeds about .",
    "finally , the @xmath110 state is predicted by godfrey and rosner to have the lowest product branching ratio , @xmath111 .",
    "this state is again predicted to be produced mostly via the @xmath104 , @xmath105 combination , and therefore our efficiency for this state is similar to the @xmath102 efficiency .    a straightforward way to measure",
    "the mass of the produced @xmath2 state is to calculate the mass of the system recoiling against the two lowest energy photons in the event .",
    "the distribution of the difference between the center - of - mass energy and this recoil mass , @xmath112 , which should peak at @xmath113 , is shown for the monte carlo simulation of a @xmath15 state with a mass of 10160 mev/@xmath14 in fig .",
    "[ fig : m3s1dmc ] .",
    "this distribution can be well described with a gaussian that has a power - law tail on the low side ( a so - called crystal ball line shape ) , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : m3s1dmc ] .",
    "the asymmetric tail is caused by transverse and longitudinal shower energy leakage in the calorimeter .",
    "the gaussian part has a resolution of @xmath114 mev/@xmath14 .    the mass value that minimizes @xmath83 is also an estimate of the true @xmath2 mass . the distribution of this mass for the same monte carlo sample as above is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : m1dfmc ] .",
    "a narrow peak at the correct mass is observed with a resolution of @xmath115 mev/@xmath14 .",
    "the mass resolution is improved in this method due to the constraints from the well measured masses of the @xmath20 states built into the @xmath83 variable . unfortunately , there are also two satellite peaks , one on each side of the main peak .",
    "these false peaks originate from photon energy fluctuations which can make a wrong @xmath64 , @xmath65 combination produce the smallest chi - squared value .",
    "the distributions of @xmath112 and the @xmath2 mass which minimizes @xmath83 for each event ( called the most - likely mass ) are shown for the data in figs .",
    "[ fig : m3s1ddata]-[fig : m1dfdata ] after the @xmath88 cut .",
    "the background fraction for this sample is in the @xmath116 range .",
    "two peaks are observed in the distribution of the most likely mass , around 10160 and 10175 mev/@xmath14 .",
    "the recoil mass distribution does not show a double - peak structure , but the mass resolution is worse in this variable , as discussed above .",
    "to analyze the most likely mass distribution , which has a better mass resolution , we fit the data to either a two - peak or a one - peak ( positioned either around 10160 or 10175 mev/@xmath14 ) hypothesis . the background is assumed to have a flat distribution .",
    "since the backgrounds are not significant , their parameterization is rather unimportant . because , in principle , up to three triplet @xmath2 states can contribute to our sample , we also tried to force a third peak into the fit function .",
    "however , the fit either makes the amplitude of this peak zero , with no effect on the amplitudes of the other two peaks , or the third peak collapses into one of the other two peaks .",
    "the two - peak fit , displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : m1dfit2 ] , gives the best confidence level ( @xmath117 ) .",
    "the amplitude ( mass ) of the first peak is @xmath118 events ( @xmath119 mev/@xmath14 ) , and of the second peak @xmath120 events ( @xmath121 mev/@xmath14 ) .",
    "the assumption that there is no peak around 10160 mev/@xmath14 produces a very low confidence level ( @xmath122 ) and can be ruled out . from the change of likelihood between these two fits ,",
    "the significance of the first peak is 6.8 standard deviations .",
    "the hypothesis of just one peak around 10160 mev/@xmath14 also produces a good confidence level of @xmath123 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : m1dfit1 ] ) , with @xmath124 events in the peak ( @xmath125 mev/@xmath14 mass )",
    ". furthermore , while the recoil mass distribution is consistent with the production of two states with the amplitudes and masses as determined by the fit above ( confidence level @xmath126 ) , it prefers to allocate most of the events to the lower mass state , @xmath127 , with only @xmath128 events attributed to the higher mass state , when the amplitudes are let free in the fit .",
    "this fit is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : m3s1dfit2 ] and has a confidence level of @xmath129 . the single - peak interpretation of the recoil mass distribution also has a high confidence level ( @xmath130 ) , with @xmath131 events at a mass of @xmath132 mev/@xmath14 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : m3s1dfit1 ] ) .    in the region of the first peak in the most likely mass distribution ,",

    "this is consistent with the monte carlo simulations for both the @xmath15 ( @xmath134 ) and @xmath135 ( @xmath136 ) states .",
    "furthermore , we have very low efficiency for the @xmath137 state at this mass ( fig .  [",
    "fig : effvsmass ] ) .",
    "when we remove the cuts suppressing the @xmath19 cascades , which are responsible for the efficiency loss for the @xmath137 state , the amplitude of this peak does not increase dramatically .",
    "therefore , this can not be the @xmath106 state .",
    "the @xmath15 state is predicted to be produced with a 6 times larger rate than the @xmath135 state @xcite .",

    "calculations of the fine splitting of the @xmath2 states predict the @xmath102 state to be close to the center - of - gravity mass @xcite .",
    "our mass measurement is consistent with these predictions .",

    "the recoil mass distribution shows no evidence for a state at 10174 mev/@xmath14 either .",
    "thus , there is no strong evidence for the second state in our data .",
    "more data , which will be accumulated by cleo iii at the @xmath1 in the future , will help to clarify the interpretation of these results .",
    "to calculate the signal efficiency in the fit to the @xmath83 distribution ( fig .",
