    "we consider the problem of coding over a quasi - static ( slow ) fading mimo channel , for example in a mobile wireless setting , where the channel is assumed to be fixed over the duration of a frame .",
    "compared to standard mimo channels , slow fading induces a loss in diversity , which can be compensated by using concatenated coding schemes , as for example space - time trellis codes @xcite .",
    "finer concatenated schemes enable to distinguish the two main design criteria , namely the rank and determinant criteria : an inner code guarantees full diversity , while combining with an outer code brings coding gain .",
    "any fully diverse space - time code can be used as inner code , but in this work , we will focus on codes built over cyclic division algebras @xcite whose algebraic structure is easier to analyze .",
    "most attempts in the literature to obtain coded modulation schemes for algebraic space - time codes focused on having the so - called golden code @xcite as inner code . in the first attempt @xcite ,",
    "the golden code was concatenated with an outer trellis code , whose drawback is its high trellis complexity .",
    "trellis coded modulation using a set partitioning of the golden code is studied in @xcite , where a systematic design approach is proposed : partitions of the golden code with increasing minimum determinant correspond to @xmath7 lattice partitions , which are labeled by using a sequence of nested binary codes . in @xcite , the algebraic structure of the golden code partitions",
    "is investigated , and the authors show that they are actually dealing with matrices over the finite field @xmath8 , or over the finite ring @xmath9 $ ] . the problem becomes thus the one of designing a suitable outer code over the given ring of matrices , for which only two examples are given : one repetition code of length 2 , and one ad hoc construction using reed solomon codes . in @xcite ,",
    "codes over @xmath3 and @xmath4)$ ] have been proposed , with applications to modulation schemes for the golden code .",
    "generalizations to higher dimensional perfect codes are reported in @xcite where a partition of a @xmath6 perfect code is considered , and in @xcite , where it has been shown that for dimensions 3 and 4 , codes to be designed are over respectively @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the original motivation for this paper is the observation that all previous works base their code design on a coarse bound depending on the minimum hamming distance of the outer code",
    ". instead , the determinant criterion drives us , here , to consider other weights than the hamming weight .",
    "these alternative weights can take more than one nonzero value , a feature that allows us to derive finer lower bounds .",
    "furthermore , the present paper deepens previous results in two main ways .",
    "first , we explore outer code constructions when the inner code has higher dimension than the golden code : we propose , for instance , a multilevel code construction over @xmath11 .",
    "second , for @xmath1 , we go one level deeper in the partition of the golden code , by quotienting with an ideal of higher norm .",
    "this enlarges the base ring , thus moving matrix entries from @xmath8 to @xmath9 $ ] .",
    "the material is organized in the following way .",
    "section [ sec : coset ] gives a general framework for dealing with @xmath0-dimensional coset codes .",
    "it gives a sequence of isomorphisms yielding four different representations of the outer code alphabet : the quotient of the inner code by a two - sided ideal , an algebra of matrices over a finite field , a cyclic algebra over a finite field , cartesian products of finite fields .",
    "section [ sec : codehigh ] studies weights on the outer code in relation with determinantal lower bounds , for @xmath12 and presents a multilevel construction for @xmath13 .",
    "section [ sec : m2f2 ] is dedicated to the special case @xmath3 , where codes for both the hamming and bachoc distances are considered . in section [ sec : m2f2i ] , we extend the bachoc weight to @xmath4)$ ] where a bidimensional lee - like distance is derived .",
    "corresponding codes are proposed .",
    "section [ sec : summary ] puts the preceding results into perspective and points out some challenging open problems .",
    "for a slow block fading channel , where the fading coefficients are assumed to be constant for @xmath14 time blocks , the goal is to design a codebook @xmath15 of codewords @xmath16 for @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is a set of codewords from a fully diverse space - time codebook , such that the minimum determinant @xmath19 of @xmath15 , given by @xmath20 is maximized . in this paper , @xmath18 will be a set of @xmath21 perfect space - time codewords @xcite .",
    "these codes are not only fully diverse , they further offer a good minimum determinant , independently of the size of the signal constellation .",
    "it is known that choosing the blocks @xmath22 independently does not bring coding gain .",
    "this is remedied by using outer codes , or more particularly in this setting , coset codes , as proposed in @xcite .",
    "consider the projection @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a two - sided ideal of @xmath18 seen as a ring , so that the quotient @xmath25 is a ring .",
    "we now take a code @xmath26 over @xmath27 .",
    "the coset code @xmath15 is obtained by considering @xmath28 .",
    "to evaluate the spectral efficiency of @xmath15 independently of the size of the signal constellation in use , we employ the notion of normalized redundancy @xmath29 per channel use , defined by @xmath30    to build coset codes as described above , the first step is to identify the quotient ring @xmath25 . in this section ,",
    "we show that if we start with @xmath18 a code built over a cyclic algebra , then @xmath31 also has a cyclic algebra structure however over a finite field .",
    "let us briefly recall the definition of codes built over cyclic algebras , introduced in @xcite , since perfect space - time codes that are of interest for this work are a subclass .",

    "note that @xmath32 is a priori any cyclic field extension . in this paper",
    ", we use both cyclic algebras over number fields and cyclic algebras over finite fields .",

    ", we consider the subset @xmath53 given by @xmath54 which is actually an order of @xmath55 , as identified in @xcite .    for the case of interest to us , @xmath56 is typically @xmath57 or @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is a primitive third root of unity , to allow the use of either qam or hex symbols .",
    "since their respective rings of integers @xmath60 $ ] and @xmath61 $ ] are principal ideal domains , it makes sense to speak of an @xmath62-basis for @xmath51 .",
    "we can now be more precise , and recall that for @xmath27 a noetherian integral domain with quotient field @xmath56 , and @xmath55 a finite dimensional @xmath56-algebra , we have the following definition .    [",
    "def : order ] an @xmath27-_order _ in the @xmath56-algebra @xmath55 is a subring @xmath63 of @xmath55 , having the same identity element as @xmath55 , and such that @xmath63 is a finitely generated module over @xmath27 and generates @xmath55 as a linear space over @xmath56 .",
    "an order @xmath63 is called _ maximal _ if it is not properly contained in any other @xmath27-order .    in the cyclic algebra @xmath55",

    "we naturally define the corresponding minimum bachoc distance @xmath65    let us now see how we can revisit the original design criterion based on the new weight we have just introduced .",
