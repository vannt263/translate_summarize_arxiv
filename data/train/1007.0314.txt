    "quantum erasing is a historical issue in discussion about quantum complementarity and reversibility of decoherence  @xcite . in traditional double - slit - based experiment ,",
    "the complementarity is written as a trade - off between which - way information and fringe visibility  @xcite . here which - way information is non - demolitionably transferred to another particle i.e. measurement probe , while this information collapses the superposition of propagating two different ways , and thus , the fringe disappears .",
    "generally speaking , arbitrarily interaction between a quantum system and its environment induces decoherence .",
    "nonetheless , in the case of non - demolishing interaction , proper measurement of the environment can , in principle , completely erase the information and perfectly reverse the decoherence . until now ,",
    "most of quantum erasers are proposed and demonstrated with qubits  @xcite . in the case of qubits ,",
    "controlled - not operation is utilized as the non - demolition interaction . however , in most of qubit eraser experiments , controlled - not operation is simulated by utilizing entangled photons as input quantum system and its environment .",
    "so , decoherence is not actually induced by the interaction .",
    "very recently , the quantum eraser which separates input state preparation and interaction was achieved  @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", continuous - variable ( cv ) quantum erasing reverses the decoherence induced by a quantum non - demolition ( qnd ) interaction  @xcite .",
    "the advantage of cv is that the process works deterministically .",
    "an interesting property of these quantum erasers is that coherence or state restoration does not depend on a state of the environment ( even arbitrary noisy )  @xcite .",
    "no special condition nor any pre - processing of the environment and the system are required to approach the perfect reconstruction .",
    "a typical discrete - variable qubit eraser works as follows . here",
    "`` signal '' and `` probe '' are a quantum system and its environment , which are denoted by the subscripts `` s '' and `` p '' , respectively .",
    "suppose the initial signal state is @xmath0 , i.e.  either @xmath1 or @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is a superposition of @xmath4 and @xmath5 which are orthogonal computational - basis ( cb ) eigen states .",
    "then , the signal qubit is entangled with the probe qubit in @xmath6 or alternatively @xmath7 via a controlled - not operation @xcite .",
    "the resulting state is a fully entangled state @xmath8 , or alternatively @xmath9 . now",
    "the state of signal qubit is decohered and becomes a fully mixed state when we consider only the signal qubit . here",
    "the density operator is @xmath10 for all the cases above , which is derived via tracing out the probe qubit .",
    "the controlled - not operation can be interpreted as perfectly copying the signal which - cb `` information '' to the probe qubit .",
    "this _ leaking information _ collapses the superposition , even without any measurement , and the resulting signal qubit state is incoherent mixture of @xmath11 and @xmath12 . by erasing the leaking information",
    ", we can reverse the decoherence .",
    "this is done by making a measurement in a superposition basis @xmath13 because the measurement reveals the _ complementary information _ and disenables us to access the leaking information .",
    "the measurement results in preserving superposition in the signal qubit as @xmath0 in the case of @xmath14 , or @xmath15 in the case of @xmath16 . in order to restore the initial qubit states @xmath0 , we perform a feed - forward correction , namely making unitary transformation @xmath17 if the state @xmath16 has appeared .",
    "note that this feedforward does not depend on whether the initial probe state is @xmath6 or @xmath7 .",
    "generally speaking , the erasing procedure is universal , i.e. , it works for any unknown input states of signal and probe , even if there is no entanglement after the controlled - not operation  @xcite .",
    "mechanism of a cv eraser well corresponds to that of the qubit eraser . instead of @xmath4 and @xmath5 for a qubit , coordinate eigenstates @xmath18 for any real number @xmath19 are the cb in the cv case .",
    "suppose initial signal state is @xmath20 as a superposion of the cb .",
    "then , the signal mode is entangled with the probe mode by a qnd interaction , where its unitary operator is @xmath21 .",
    "similary as for the qubit case , the qnd interaction transfers information only in the single variable .",
    "although initial probe state is arbitrary for cv quantum erasing , we assume @xmath22 ( denoted as @xmath6 for simplicity ) here . later , we describe the general case . in the case of @xmath6 ,",
    "the output state is @xmath23 .",
    "the signal - coordinate _",
    "information _ is completely copied to the probe by the qnd interaction .",
    "thus , the state of the signal mode becomes a mixed state whose density operator is @xmath24 .",
    "information transfer to the probe mode in the coordinate basis collapses the superposition . in the case that we access the _ information _ by making a measurement on the coordinate basis of the probe ,",
    "the signal state becomes a coordinate eigen state @xmath25 , where the measurement is known as a qnd measurement .",
    "in contrast , measurement on the momentum basis , namely @xmath26 , erases the _ leaking information _ and the coherence of the signal mode is restored .",
    "this is because the coordinate and momentum operators are conjugate to each other .",
    "the eraser can also restore the unknown initial state @xmath27 with proper feedforward , while experimental qubit erasers are usually evaluated only on recovery of the coherence  @xcite .",
    "this cv quantum erasing can be regarded as undoing qnd interaction with measurement and feedforward .",
    "the unitary operator of the qnd interaction is @xmath28 , so the interaction is reversible by another qnd interaction i.e. @xmath29 , which can be decomposed into measurement @xmath30 and feedforwarding phase space displacement @xmath31 .",
    "thus , quantum erasing corresponds to inverse operation of the qnd interaction based on the measurement and assisted by classical communication . from this reason , quantum erasing works equally well with any input states , in principle .    in the case of experiment",
    ", however , qnd interaction always contains some imperfection . in our implementation of qnd interaction  @xcite",
    ", the gain @xmath32 of the qnd interaction @xmath33 can be set to unity . on the other hand",
    ", there is some excess noise which originates from ancillary squeezed states utilized as resource for the nonclassicality of the interaction .",
    "this excess noise corresponds to imperfection in concealing the information which leaks to ancilla . through the erasing process",
    ", the leaking information in the probe is erased , but that in the ancilla can not be removed . so the excess noise contaminating the restored state originates from the qnd interaction and does not depend on either the initial signal or probe state . in this sense , both qnd interaction and quantum erasing works equally well with any set of input states .",
    "the first experimental cv quantum eraser was reported in ref .  @xcite . in the experiment ,",
    "the leaking information in the probe is partly erased .",
    "however , it was not demonstration of reversing qnd interaction , a beam splitter interaction is utilized instead . since",
    "beam splitter interaction is not a non - demolition interaction , both coordinate and momentum of the probe hold the leaking information . from this reason ,",
    "the probe state is limited to a squeezed state , whose anti - squeezed noise conceals the leaking information of momentum variable and thus permits erasing .",
    "in their scheme , the probe also works as resource for the nonclassicality , not the whole leaking information in the probe is erased without infinite squeezing , and thus restored state depends on the probe . without probe squeezing , the quantum erasing with beam splitter interaction requires pre - processing of the unknown input state  @xcite or measurement of both of the variables , which leads only to limited reconstruction of the input state  @xcite . in their experiment , performance for other than vacuum state is not demonstrated .",
    "moreover , the change in the coherence is not directly observed .",
    "we reported cluster state shaping as application of quantum erasing in ref .",
    "this technique provide flexibility of fixed large - scale cluster states and enable us to shape it into modified , smaller cluster states  @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , in that experiment , we also utilized beam splitters instead of qnd interactions for cluster state generation , and we dealt only with the cluster state and its resource squeezed vacuum states .    in this paper , we demonstrate cv quantum erasing as reversing a qnd interaction . with a qnd interaction , we can restore any initial signal state , and the resulting state does not depend on the initial probe state .",
    "first , we use a coherent and squeezed - vacuum states as the initial signal and probe states , respectively .",
    "we verify the change in the quantum states and coherence throughout the process by performing homodyne tomography .",
    "then , in order to verify the imperfection independence from the initial states , we exchange the role of input states , i.e.  we utilize a squeezed vacuum state as initial signal state and the coherent state as the probe .",
    "finally , we also verify information erasure by uncertainty relation between information and decoherence .",
    "in this section , we describe the quantum states throughout the process and discuss the relation between the _ leaking information _ and decoherence which are induced by qnd interaction .",
    "figure  [ fig : erasing ] shows a schematic of cv quantum erasing .",
    "input quantum states of signal and probe modes are independently prepared ( a ) , and then a qnd interaction couples them ( b ) , finally , measurement and feedforward restore the initial signal state ( c ) .",
    "hereafter , quantum states in these steps are denoted by superscripts or labels ( a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) and they are normalized with @xmath34 .",
    "@xmath27 and @xmath35 represent arbitrary initial quantum states of the signal and probe modes , respectively . for ease of explanation , we assume pure states as initial quantum states .",
    "note that we discuss the case of mixed state later . by qnd interaction ,",
    "these modes are entangled as follows , @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the input wave functions on coordinate bases of the signal and probe , respectively , while @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the input wave functions on momentum bases , which are obtained by the fourier transformation denoted by ``  '' via @xmath41 .",
    "obviously , this entangled state has correlation in both coordinate and momentum variables .",
    "the following density matrices represent the each mode state after the qnd interaction derived from eq .",
    "and eq .   by tracing out the other mode : @xmath42 where @xmath43 represent initial density matrices of signal and probe on coordinate bases , and on momentum bases , respectively , e.g.  @xmath44 , and @xmath45 with superscript @xmath46 represent density matrices after the qnd interaction",
    ". equations ( [ eq : qnd0]-[eq : qnd3 ] ) are also satisfied with mixed state inputs , and thus we deal with arbitrary input states hereafter .    among these equations ,",
    "eq .   represents that the probe state has the information of the signal coordinate .",
    "we can obtain the information by making a measurement of the probe coordinate .",
    "the measurement outcome @xmath47 is obtained with the probability being a convolution @xmath48 , where the probability is calculated by applying @xmath49 to eq .  .",
    "this measurement is known as the qnd measurement [ fig .",
    "[ fig : qndm ] ] .",
    "the measurement outcome @xmath47 contains the error which is the convoluted distribution of @xmath50 originating from the probe initial state .",
    "so the variance of the measurement outcome is the sum of those of the initial signal coordinate and measurement error i.e.  @xmath51 .",
    "the ambiguity of information can be defined as the standard deviation of the measurement error @xmath52 which equals to that of the initial probe coordinate @xmath53 .    as quantitative measure of the information ,",
    "we use fisher information  @xcite , denoted as @xmath54 .",
    "if the fisher information increases @xmath55-times , only @xmath56 times of repeated measurements are enough to achieve the same quality of estimation .",
    "it allows us on a physical basis to quantitatively compare any possible change of _ information _ accessible by the qnd measurement . in the case of gaussian",
    "added noise in measurement without a priori knowledge , it satisfies @xmath57 ( see appendix ) .",
    "the fisher information decoheres the signal state as represented in eq .  .",
    "the function @xmath58 is the ratio of each density matrix elements , i.e.  @xmath59 .",
    "the ratio function is equal to @xmath60 , and thus it equals to @xmath61 in the case of @xmath62 because of the normalization of @xmath63 . on the other hand ,",
    "it satisfies @xmath64 in the case of @xmath65 .",
    "so the diagonal elements of @xmath66 ( signal density matrix on the coordinate basis ) are preserved through the qnd interaction , while the off - diagonal elements ( @xmath65 ) become smaller in absolute value with the ratio of @xmath67 .",
    "thus , the distribution of @xmath68 is not demolished , while the superposition between any different coordinate basis states @xmath25 and @xmath69 is decohered .",
    "it well corresponds to double - slit - based qubit cases , where the fringe reflects the single off - diagonal element @xmath70 .",
    "the which - way ( 0 or 1 ) information makes the off - diagonal element smaller . here , not only a single off - diagonal element , but rather a continuous set of the off - diagonal elements describes the coherence in cv system .",
    "in momentum basis , this decoherence appears as the increase of variance as shown in eq .  , where the distribution of momentum @xmath26 is calculated to be @xmath71 . in the theory of quantum measurement  @xcite ,",
    "this increase of variance corresponds to back action of the measurement , i.e.  the back action increases as measurement error decreases .",
    "the trade off satisfies the following uncertainty relation of measurement  @xcite , @xmath72 where @xmath73 denotes the standard deviation of the back action which is the convoluted additional distribution in the signal momentum after the interaction , i.e.  @xmath74 . in this case",
    ", the backaction originates from the initial probe , i.e.  @xmath75 .",
    "thus , we have equality in eq .   if and only if the probe is in minimal uncertainty state @xmath76 . from the inequality , the minimal back action derived as @xmath77 .    as quantum erasing operation , we employ the measurement of @xmath78 , hereafter @xmath79 represents the measurement outcome . by applying @xmath80 to eq .",
    ", we calculate the distribution of the measurement outcome is @xmath81 .",
    "thus , the measurement result does not reflect any property of the initial signal state .",
    "besides , the measurement of @xmath78 erases the leaking information from @xmath82 owing to their conjugateness",
    ". therefore , the decoherence of the signal disappears together with the leaking information .",
    "the signal density matrix after the measurement is @xmath83 .",
    "thus , the initial signal state is restored by a feedforwarding momentum - displacement operation by @xmath79 , i.e.  @xmath84 .    with a perfect quantum erasing operation",
    ", the back action is completely removed , i.e.  @xmath85 , which corresponds to vanishing the fisher information . in experiments",
    ", there is some residual noise @xmath86 after the erasing operation due to imperfections of experimental qnd interaction  @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , the leaking information should be partly erased if the residual noise is below the minimal back action , i.e. , @xmath87 , or equivalently , @xmath88 we consider inequality as a sufficient condition for the success of information erasure .",
    "quantitatively , the maximal residual fisher information @xmath89 after erasing can be compared with the fisher information @xmath54 after the qnd measurement .",
    "note that this relation does not conflict with inequality because the erasure of leaking information corresponds to making the erorr in the qnd measurement infinity .",
    "@xmath52 represents measurement error without erasing , and thus @xmath52 and @xmath90 can not be obtained simultaneously .",
    "then we consider the case with experimental imperfect qnd operation  @xcite . the transfer gains ( coefficient of amplitude transfer ) of the qnd gate can slightly vary owing to change in optical interference visibilities .",
    "there are excess gaussian noises on both @xmath19 and @xmath26 quadratures coming from ancillary modes utilized as resource for entanglement . by taking acount of these imperfections ,",
    "density operator after the erasing is rewritten as follows : @xmath91 \\exp \\left[-\\frac{(x - x^\\prime ) ^2}{2\\sigma_p^2}\\right ] , \\\\",
    "\\text{where\\ } \\rho_{\\frac{\\pi}{4}}(\\alpha , \\beta ) & = \\rho \\left ( \\frac{\\alpha + \\beta}{\\sqrt{2}},\\frac{\\alpha -\\beta}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right ) , \\notag\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and where @xmath92 and @xmath93 denotes the gains in @xmath19 and @xmath26 quadratures i.e.  @xmath94 , @xmath95 ; and @xmath96 and @xmath97 denotes the variance of excess noises in @xmath19 and @xmath26 quadratues i.e.  @xmath98 , @xmath99 , respectively .",
    "these gains and excess noises fully characterize the qnd and erasing operation because they are gaussian operation ( i.e. operation whoes hamiltonian is no more than second order ) and its reverse operation , respectively .",
    "the residual noise is the same as the excess noise in @xmath26 quadrature i.e.  @xmath100 .",
    "note that @xmath101 and @xmath102 also contain excess noises of the qnd interaction in experiment .    in our scheme",
    ", a restored state does not depend on the probe because the back action from the probe is removed .",
    "this corresponds to full erasure of the leaking information in the probe , even with aforementioned experimental imperfections .",
    "since our qnd and erasing operations are fully gaussian , the amount of back action from the probe corresponds to the transfer gain from the probe to the signal .",
    "thus we experimentally estimate the transfer gain by utilizing a coherent state as the probe .",
    "figure  [ fig : ex_erasing ] shows our optical implementation of fig .",
    "[ fig : erasing ] .",
    "the experimental setup consists of the following parts : preparation of the input signal and probe states ( not shown in the figure ) , qnd interaction  @xcite , measurement , feedforward , and finally , the verification measurement .",
    "this setup is similar to that of our quadratic phase gate  @xcite .",
    "however , since the quadratic phase gate is generalized teleportation  @xcite , it requires a squeezed vacuum state as the initial probe state , while the quantum erasing operation does not depend on the initial probe state .",
    "besides , the mode to be measured and the mode to be suffered from feedforward are also different between these two operations .    as a light source ,",
    "we utilize a continuous - wave ti : sapphire laser with the wave length of 860  nm . as one of two input states , a coherent state at the 1.34  mhz sideband",
    "is generated by modulating a weak laser beam of about 10  @xmath103w using two electro - optic modulators ( eoms ) .",
    "one of the eoms modulates the phase of the beam and the other modulates the amplitude . in our optical implementation ,",
    "coordinate @xmath19 and momentum @xmath26 correspond to these amplitude and phase quadratures .",
    "thus , these two eoms can generate a coherent state at 1.34  mhz with any complex amplitude from the laser beam .",
    "as the other input state , a squeezed vacuum state is generated by a sub - threshold optical parametric oscillator ( opo ) .",
    "we also utilize another two opos in order to prepare resource squeezed - vacuum states for qnd interaction .",
    "each opo is a bow - tie shaped cavity of 500  mm in length with a 10-mm - long periodically - poled ktiopo@xmath104 ( ppktp ) crystal as a nonlinear medium  @xcite . in order to pump the opos ,",
    "we generate second harmonic ( 430  nm in wavelength ) of ti : sapphire output by a frequency doubler , which has similar structure of opo while it has knbo@xmath105 crystal instead of ppktp .",
    "each generated squeezed state has squeezing level of about @xmath106 db relative to the shot - noise level ( snl ) .",
    "the qnd interaction consists of a mach - zehnder interferometer with a single - mode squeezing gate in each arm  @xcite .",
    "each single - mode squeezing gate contains a squeezed vacuum ancilla , homodyne detection , and feedforward  @xcite .",
    "the four reflectivities of 72% , 38% , 38% , and 28% are chosen to achieve unity gain qnd interaction as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ex_erasing ]  @xcite .",
    "these reflectivities are implemented as variable beam splitters ( vbss ) , each composed of two polarizing beam splitters and a half - wave plate .",
    "this variability enables us to eliminate the qnd interaction when we measure input states , by setting the reflectivities of these vbss to unity .",
    "it is also useful when we exchange the signal / probe roles of two modes , in that case , we flip the two output ports of qnd interaction by adjusting the reflectivity of the fourth one from 28% to 72% .",
    "feed - forwarding displacement operation is performed by sending measurement outcome of homodyne detection to an eom which modulates phase of an auxiliary beam , and then by coupling the beam to main stream with a 99% reflector . at each beam splitter , we lock the relative phase of the two input beams by means of active feedback to a piezoelectric transducer . for this purpose , two modulation sidebands of 154 and 107  khz",
    "are used as phase references .    to verify the output state ,",
    "we employ another homodyne detection .",
    "we perform two different verifications . first , in order to reconstruct the resulting quantum state , we perform optical homodyne tomography , namely , quantum state reconstruction from the marginal distributions for various phases  @xcite .",
    "we slowly scan the phase of optical local oscillator ( lo ) and perform a series of homodyne measurements .",
    "the 1.34 mhz component of the homodyne signal is extracted by means of lock - in detection : it is mixed with a reference signal and then sent through a 30  khz low pass filter , and then , it is digitized with sampling rate of 300,000 samples per second .",
    "second , for accurate evaluation of variance in @xmath19 or @xmath26-quadrature , we lock the lo phase and extract 1.34 mhz component of the measurement outcome via a spectrum analyzer . through this variance evaluation",
    ", we verify the information erasure .",
    "the powers of the los are about 3  mw . the detector s quantum efficiencies are greater than 99% , the interference visibilities to the los are on average 98% , and the circuit noise of each homodyne detector is about 17  db below the snl produced by the lo .",
    "propagation losses of our whole setup are about 7% .",
    "these losses are compensated via the equality of losses between inputs and outputs .",
    "first , we examined quantum states throughout the process examined by homodyne tomography . here",
    "we utilize a coherent and squeezed - vacuum state as the initial signal and probe state , respectively .",

    "note that the residual noise mainly comes from finitely squeezed ancillas of the qnd interaction  @xcite .",
    "these relations correspond to the change in coherence shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : erasing_dm_diag](ii ) , where the black curve ( calculated with eq .  ) represents maximum coherence with the fisher information of 10.4 .",
    "after the qnd interaction , coherence drops below the black curve because of the leaking information . by erasing ,",
    "coherence gets restored above the black curve because the leaking information disappears .",
    "finally , we verify transfer gain and excess noise of our quantum eraser and estimate its average fidelity .",
    "since both the qnd and erasing operation are constructed with gaussian components ( squeezed states as resource , homodyne measurements , and phase space displacements ) , they can be fully characterized by the gains and excess noises in the @xmath19- and @xmath26- quadratures , as the components are characterized by those of them .",
    "this gaussian characterization allows to predict the erasing effect for any input state of the signal .",
    "coherent states with two different mean complex amplitudes , about @xmath133 and @xmath134 , are utilized as signal input state in order to obtain the gain in @xmath19- and @xmath26-quadrature , respectively .",
    "figure  [ fig : gains ] shows the input and output powers in both @xmath19- and @xmath26- quadratures compared with those of vacuum input . by the construction of qnd interaction , the gains can be adjusted to reach almost unity and the crosstalk between different quadrature can be neglected . from the results ,",
    "the gains are calculated as @xmath135 and @xmath136 .",
    "the excess noises are obtained as @xmath137 and @xmath138 . as the estimated average fidelity",
    ", we obtained @xmath139 for a set of coherent states whose mean amplitude is gaussian - distributed with the variance of @xmath140 i.e. ten times shot noise . here",
    "we neglect the saturation of detectors or electronic devices because the mean amplitudes are almost the same as aforementioned experiment .",
    "the average fidelity is high compared with that before erasing @xmath141 which calculated with the noise variances of @xmath142 and @xmath143 , and with the gains of @xmath144 and @xmath145 where the range of error on @xmath146 is enlarged by considering the saturation of detector slew - rate with the sum of antisqueezed variance and mean amplitude .    for verification of our qnd interaction ,",
    "we also evaluate the performance of qnd measurement with the criteria proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "the input states are the vacuum and squeezed vacuum states again .",
    "as already mentioned , measurement error @xmath147 is only @xmath148 .",
    "the qnd variable @xmath68 is well preserved within the variance @xmath149 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : variances ] .",
    "the verification setup represented in fig .",
    "[ fig : condv_setup ] yields conditional variance ( fig .",
    "[ fig : conditional_variance ] ) , @xmath150 which is suppressed below the snl . thus , there exists nonclassical correlation between the signal and probe quadratures .",
    "these results satisfy the qnd - measurement criteria  @xcite . furthermore , by adjusting subtracting gain @xmath32 in eq .   to unity",
    "i.e.  @xmath151 , we can also evaluate the entanglement between the signal and probe after the qnd interaction .",
    "we obtained the correlation of @xmath19 quadratures @xmath152 and the one of @xmath26 quadratures @xmath153 , which satisfy the duan - simon entanglement criteria  @xcite .",
    "therefore , our qnd interaction satisfies the qnd and entangling criteria .",
    "so we can conclude that our quantum eraser is undoing such an appropriate qnd interaction .",
    "in conclusion , we have experimentally demonstrated cv quantum erasing as reversing a qnd interaction . to verify that the quantum erasing works equally for different input states ,",
    "we have used a coherent state and a squeezed vacuum state as input states .",
    "we have entangled them by the qnd interaction , and then observed that each state is decohered owing to copying the information by the interaction .",
    "these decoherence are observed as decrease of off - diagonal elements of the density matrix .",
    "after that , we have restored either of the two input states .",
    "a full characterization of the quantum erasing as a gaussian operation have been obtained from estimation of the transfer gains and excess noises .",
    "initial coherent states has been restored with the fidelity of 86% , which is verified by two independent ways : homodyne tomography and average fidelity estimation from the transfer gains and excess noises .",
    "a squeezed - vacuum state has also been restored , which shows the erasing operation can recover non - classical properties .",
    "we have verified the erasure of information by using the uncertainty relation between measurement error and back action in conjugate variable , rewritten in terms of the fisher information and reduction of the off - diagonal elements in the measured basis . by this experimental test , a full analogy between the discrete variable and the continuous variable quantum erasing have been proved .",
