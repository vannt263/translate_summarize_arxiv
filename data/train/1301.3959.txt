    "ongoing studies of atomic bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) have contributed numerous fundamental insights in a wide range of phenomena  @xcite .",
    "this may be largely attributed to the precise control afforded by experiments , and to the existence of accurate , yet quite tractable models based on the gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe )  @xcite .",
    "many of the theoretical and experimental investigations have strong connections to other areas , such as condensed matter physics , nonlinear optics , superconductivity , and superfluidity .",
    "furthermore , ultracold gases trapped in external potentials may be utilized as quantum simulators of real materials @xcite .",
    "inter - atomic interactions in a bec enable the examination of a wide variety of nonlinear effects that have been summarized in a number of reviews and books such as @xcite .",
    "basic types of coherent structures built by the nonlinearity are bright solitons and soliton complexes chap01:njp2003b , kono , fatk , torner , extra - reviews , dark solitons  @xcite , vortices , and vortex lattices  @xcite .",
    "bright solitons were proposed for matter - wave interferometry @xcite , which is itself an active field of research @xcite .",
    "recent work focused on the role of the condensate s effective nonlinearity recent , as well as on advanced applications @xcite .",
    "solitons may provide for 100-fold improved sensitivity for atom interferometry , where their long lifetime , of the order of seconds , may enable precise force sensing  @xcite and measurement of small magnetic field gradients rosanov .",
    "robust bright solitons , appropriate for these applications , have been created under well - controlled conditions in becs with attractive chap01:bright1,chap01:bright2,chap01:bright3 and repulsive gap - solitons  inter - atomic interactions ( in the latter case , these were gap solitons @xcite supported by the optical - lattice potential ) .",
    "a topic of particular interest has been the splitting and subsequent recombination of solitons due to collisions with potential barriers .",
    "this was studied theoretically in detail @xcite , as summarized in a recent review  @xcite .",
    "however , it is relevant to stress that the analysis has been thus far carried out for a one - dimensional ( 1d ) model , i.e. , the 1d gpe with cubic nonlinearity ( although some features such as solitary wave collisions have also been recently explored in a 3d setting  @xcite ) . in the same framework , the quasiparticle - wave duality of solitons and their tunneling through a potential barrier was recently considered  @xcite .",
    "the subject of the present work is the interaction of the incident soliton with a potential barrier , acting as a beam splitter , and the subsequent recombination of the split fragments in the 3d setting .",
    "the three - dimensionality strongly affects the results in comparison with the 1d setting of the above recent studies .",
    "bright matter - wave solitons are experimentally created in cigar - shaped ( nearly-1d ) potential traps in which the self - trapping is driven by the intrinsic attractive nonlinearity solely in the axial direction .",
    "the number of atoms in the soliton , @xmath0 will be considered relatively close to the value at the collapse threshold , @xmath1 , and the actual shape of the solitons will be three - dimensional in the considerations that follow . accordingly , the solitary waves do not reproduce the conspicuous elongation of the underlying trapping potential , as known from previous works @xcite .",
    "thus , the character of the splitting and subsequent merger may be essentially three - dimensional too  in particular , transverse modes may ( and will , as we show ) be excited .    in the recently studied 1d counterpart of this setting ,",
    "results of an earlier work @xcite were used in @xcite to predict the transmission and reflection coefficients and the phase shift resulting from the interaction with a narrow barrier .",
    "a sinusoidal dependence of the transmission coefficient on the relative phase of two solitary waves colliding on the barrier was identified . in @xcite , both the primary splitting of a single solitary wave and the secondary collision of the two fragments was studied using the truncated wigner approximation , with emphasis on the comparison of the mean - field dynamics with the quantum dynamics .",
    "significant deviations between the two were identified for a relatively small number of atoms in the solitary wave . a step - wise ( discontinuous ) variation of the reflection and transmission coefficients due to quantum superposition",
    "was recently reported @xcite .",
    "the deviation between quantum and mean - field approaches is significant only for relatively small @xmath0 , becoming negligible for large @xmath0 . in this paper",
    ", we consider @xmath0 close to collapse , where @xmath2 .",
    "for this reason , quantum effects are not crucially important to us .",
    "collisions of 1d solitons with an attractive potential well , rather than the repulsive barrier , have also been studied recently , revealing a fairly complex phenomenology .",
    "the latter features alternating windows of transmission , reflection , and trapping with abrupt transitions between them as the potential depth varies  @xcite .",
    "our analysis is performed in two stages .",
    "first , we use the well - known 1d nonpolynomial schrdinger equation ( npse )  @xcite , which , unlike the cubic 1d gpe , captures the 3d phenomenology in some approximation ( in particular , it admits the possibility of collapse , although not in the same way as the 3d gpe ) .",
    "we will refer to this npse setting as a _",
    "quasi-1d _ description to clearly distinguish it from the 1d gpe setting where collapse is absent .",
    "secondly , we report results obtained from the full 3d gpe . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "both equations are used for the first time in this context .",
    "our main interest is to consider relatively large atom numbers @xmath0 ( @xmath3 ) , for which the phase coherence of the condensate is maintained and the soliton dynamics are most interesting .",
    "we explore the dependence of the results on @xmath0 , as well as on the height of the barrier , @xmath4 .",
    "there exist significant differences between the dynamics described by the ordinary cubic 1d gpe and predictions of the full 3d equation , as the excitation of transverse oscillations ( the feature which is obviously absent in the 1d description ) becomes prominent for @xmath5 . on the other hand ,",
    "the quasi-1d npse is found to be in reasonable agreement with the 3d gpe both in regard to its static properties ( although the stable branch of solutions at low @xmath0 is captured more accurately than the unstable collapsing one of high @xmath0 ) and to the dynamics of soliton - barrier interactions .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section 2",
    ", we introduce the quasi-1d and 3d models , compute their stationary solutions , and define diagnostics used to examine the dynamics . in section 3 , we report numerical results in detail , varying the barrier height and width , atom number , as well as phase imprinting applied to one of the fragments for simulating the interferometry .",
    "the paper is concluded by section 4 .",
    "we start by introducing the quasi-1d npse for the mean - field wave function , @xmath6 , of the condensate of @xmath7li atoms loaded into a cigar - shaped trap with axial coordinate @xmath8 ,    @xmath9    where @xmath10 , with the typical scattering length @xmath11 @xmath12 , where @xmath12 is the bohr radius , and transverse trapping radius @xmath13 @xmath14 m , which corresponds to a confinement frequency @xmath15 hz and atomic mass @xmath16 amu .",
    "the longitudinal potential @xmath17 includes a weak parabolic trap , which we assume has a typical value of the strength , @xmath18 hz , and the gaussian barrier of height @xmath4 and width @xmath19 , which will be varied below :    @xmath20    the total number of atoms , given by @xmath21 , will also be varied .",
    "the results produced by the npse ( [ eq : dyn1d ] ) will be compared to those obtained from the radially symmetric 3d gpe , written in the cylindrical coordinates , @xmath22 as    @xmath23    with @xmath24 and the 3d potential ,    @xmath25    equation ( [ eq : potential2d ] ) implies that we consider only fundamental axially symmetric solitons , but not ones with intrinsic axial vorticity , which are also possible in this setting @xcite .",
    "axial widths of the solitons generated by the quasi-1d npse and 3d gpe are defined as@xmath26    stationary solutions with chemical potential @xmath27 were sought for as @xmath28 .",
    "figure [ fig : norm ] compares @xmath29 and @xmath30 curves for the soliton families , produced by both the quasi-1d and 3d equations . in these plots",
    ", @xmath0 is normalized to the critical atom number , @xmath1 , which initializes the collapse , i.e. , the largest number atoms accessible ( by a stable standing wave solution ) in the given setting  @xcite .",
    "both equations yield nearly the same value , @xmath31 .",
    "the same plot includes the curves for the usual 1d cubic gpe , demonstrating that the latter model progressively deviates from the npse and the 3d gpe for @xmath32 .",
    "importantly , it is relevant to note that the solitons of the fomer model have a monotonic dependence of @xmath0 on @xmath33 corroborating their dynamical stability for all values of the chemical potential , contrary to the instability of the latter two models for @xmath34 .",
    "it is for these reasons that for the range of atom numbers examined herein , we will restrict our considerations hereafter to the latter two models .",
    "a straightforward analysis demonstrates that the general condition for the validity of the npse approximation is @xmath35 .",
    "indeed , it is observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : norm ] that stable solution branches generated by the npse  and 3d gpe are very close , while the discrepancy is conspicuous for the unstable branches . in the right panel of figure fig : norm , a horizontal line is drawn at @xmath36 @xmath14 m , which corresponds to the typical width of the barrier @xmath37 in the simulations reported below .",
    "it is seen that stable solitons are narrower than @xmath38 @xmath39 m only at @xmath40 .",
    "consequently , solitons are typically wider than the considered barrier .",
    "notice that in what follows , we will keep the trap strength fixed and will vary the number of atoms @xmath0",
    ". we will be interested in the regime of large @xmath41 ( and close to the onset of collapse ) , where the mean field approximation above is expected to adequately describe the system .",
    "on the contrary , for cases of tighter confinement or of lower atom numbers , effects of quantum fluctuations are expected to progressively become more important  martin .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     . .",
    "we have explored the collision of matter - wave solitons with a central barrier of variable width and height inserted into a shallow harmonic - oscillator axial trap , and the subsequent collision of the split fragments upon their return to the defect . this configuration forms the basis of a soliton interferometer . the non - monotonic variation of @xmath42 with @xmath0 and @xmath4 , evident for strong nonlinearity in figures [ fig : r2 ] and fig:1micron , is detrimental to the sensitivity of an atom interferometer .",
    "figure [ fig : phase1 ] , however , indicates that the sensitivity to phase variation can be regained by smaller nonlinearity and that the adverse effect of strong nonlinearity can be partially mitigated by a narrow barrier .",
    "narrow in this context , evidently means in comparison to the axial size of the soliton .",
    "our analysis accounted for relatively large atom numbers , which are not much smaller than the collapse threshold .",
    "this strong nonlinearity necessitates a full 3d solution , in contrast to the 1d gpe setting studied in previous works .",
    "the analysis was carried out , in parallel , in the framework of the quasi-1d npse and the full 3d gpe , indicating a good qualitative and even reasonable quantitative ( at least not too close to @xmath43 ) agreement between the two .",
    "a detailed computational map of the ensuing phenomenology has been generated as a function of number of atoms in the soliton , its initial distance from the barrier ( which determines the collision velocity ) , and the height and width of the splitting barrier .",
    "additionally , the effect of a phase shift imposed on the fragments at the moment of the largest separation was also examined .",
    "a number of general conclusions , obtained in the framework of the quasi-1d and full 3d settings , and their similarities and differences have been reported .",
    "while the results are similar between these two cases , they are essentially different from those generated by the 1d cubic gpe , which was used previously .",
    "the quasi-1d npse and 3d gpe produce similar values for the first reflectivities , systematically increasing with increasing barrier height @xmath4 and weakly decreasing with increasing number of atoms @xmath0 .",
    "the second reflectivity ( corresponding to the collision of the fragments after the first interaction with the barrier ) oscillates strongly from complete reflection to high transmission as function of barrier height ( and atom number ) .",
    "these oscillations are a fundamentally nonlinear effect , most pronounced for large @xmath0 .",
    "the excitation of the transverse breathing mode was also characterized in the framework of the 3d gpe .",
    "this effect was found to become progressively more significant as the critical number of atoms , corresponding to the onset of the collapse , was approached .",
    "phase imprinting was found to play a critical role in the outcome of the second collision , especially for small nonlinearity , modifying it between nearly complete transmission and full reflection .",
    "the highly nonlinear realm seems less sensitive to such variations , but the sensitivity may be restored for narrower barriers .",
    "it is important to corroborate these findings experimentally .",
    "regarding further theoretical analysis , a challenging problem is to study deviations of the results from the mean - field approximation in the 3d geometry as a function of the atom number @xmath0 , in analogy to the recently emergent studies in the 1d setting @xcite .",
    "an additional issue of interest is the use of potential wells , rather than barriers , for which more complex phenomenology may be expected in the 3d setting @xcite .",
    "lastly , extending such considerations to dark solitons in condensates with the self - repulsive nonlinearity @xcite , and to multi - component  systems @xcite are also compelling topics for further investigation .",
