    "sandpile models are the prime example of self - organized criticality ( soc ) @xcite , a control mechanism that forces a system with an absorbing - state phase transition to its critical point @xcite , leading to scale invariance in the apparent absence of parameters @xcite .",
    "soc in a slowly - driven sandpile corresponds to an absorbing - state phase transition in a model having the same local dynamics , but a fixed number of particles @xcite .",
    "the latter class of models is usually designated as _ fixed - energy sandpiles _ ( fes ) or _ conserved sandpiles_. continuous absorbing - state phase transitions characterized by a nonconserved order parameter ( activity density ) coupled to a conserved field that does not diffuse in the absence of activity , are expected to define a universality class @xcite .",
    "this class , referred to as c - dp ( that is , a model - c version , in the sense of halperin and hohenberg @xcite , of directed percolation , or dp ) , appears to be distinct from that of directed percolation @xcite .    in recent years",
    "considerable progress has been made in characterizing the critical properties of conserved stochastic sandpiles , although no complete , reliable theory is yet at hand . as is often the case in critical phenomena , theoretical understanding of scaling and universality rests on the analysis of a continuum field theory or langevin equation ( a nonlinear stochastic partial differential equation ) that reproduces the phase diagram and captures the fundamental symmetries and conservation laws of the system .",
    "important steps in this direction are the recent numerical studies of a langevin equation @xcite for c - dp .",
    "( the latter which appears to incorporate the essential aspects of stochastic sandpiles . )",
    "the critical exponent values reported in ref .",
    "@xcite are in good agreement with simulations of conserved lattice gas ( clg ) models @xcite , which exhibit the same symmetries and conservation laws as stochastic sandpiles .",
    "the langevin equation exponents are also consistent with the best available estimates for stochastic sandpiles in two dimensions @xcite , with the exception of the exponent @xmath2 governing the initial decay of the order parameter .",
    "( the discrepancy regarding @xmath2 likely reflects strong corrections to short - time scaling in sandpiles , due to long memory effects associated with initial density fluctuations @xcite . )",
    "pending a better understanding of this question , it appears that stochastic sandpiles are consistent with c - dp in two dimensions . in the one - dimensional case",
    ", however , there is a significant discrepancy between the langevin equation results and those for sandpile models .",
    "specifically , analysis of the langevin equation for c - dp yields , in one dimension , the order - parameter critical exponent value @xmath3 , while previous studies @xcite of stochastic sandpiles furnish values near 0.40 for this exponent .",
    "there are also smaller discrepancies for other critical exponents .",
    "if this discrepancy were to persist , one would be forced to conclude that the proposed langevin equation misses some essential aspect of sandpiles ( at least in the one - dimensional case ) , or that not all models with the same symmetries and conserved quantities belong to the same universality class . in an effort to clarify the situation ,",
    "i apply the recently devised quasistationary simulation method @xcite to the restricted - height sandpile introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the balance of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii i define the model and summarize the simulation method .",
    "numerical results are analyzed in sec .",
    "iii , and in sec .",
    "iv i discuss the findings in the context of universality .",
    "i study the `` independent '' version of the model introduced in ref .",
    "the system , a continuous - time , restricted - height version of manna s stochastic sandpile @xcite , is defined on a ring of @xmath4 sites .",
    "the configuration is specified by the number of particles , @xmath5 , or 2 , at each site @xmath6 .",
    "sites with @xmath7 are _ active _ , and have a toppling rate of unity .",
    "the continuous - time markovian dynamics consists of a series of toppling events at individual sites . when site @xmath6 topples , two particles attempt to move randomly ( and independently ) to either @xmath8 or @xmath9 .",
    "( the two particles may both try to jump to the same neighbor . )",
    "each particle transfer is accepted so long as it does not lead to a site having more than two particles .",
    "( if the target site is already doubly occupied the particle does not move .",
    "thus an attempt to send two particles from site @xmath10 to site @xmath11 , with @xmath12 , results in @xmath13 and @xmath14 . ) the next site to topple is chosen at random from a list of active sites , which is updated following each event .",
    "the time increment associated with each toppling is @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the number of active sites just prior to the event .",
    "any configuration devoid of doubly occupied sites is absorbing .",
    "although absorbing configurations exist for particle densities @xmath17 , the critical value @xmath18 ( above which activity continues indefinitely ) appears to be strictly less than unity . in ref .",
    "@xcite the model was studied in the site and pair mean - field approximation ( which yield a continuous phase transition at @xmath19 and 0.75 , respectively , in one dimension ) , and via monte carlo simulation using system sizes of up to 5000 sites .",
    "the latter yield the estimates @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "a similar value , @xmath24 , was obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite using a series of cluster approximations ( of up to 11 sites ) , combined with suzuki s coherent anomaly analysis @xcite .",
    "the studies reported here employ the quasistationary ( qs ) simulation method , which , due to increased efficiency in the critical region , permits a tenfold increase in the system size as compared to ref .",
    "the qs method , described in detail in @xcite , provides a just sampling of asymptotic ( long - time ) properties , conditioned on survival . in practice this is accomplished by maintaining ( and gradually updating ) a set of configurations visited during the evolution ; when a transition to the absorbing state is imminent the system is instead placed in one of the saved configurations .",
    "otherwise the evolution is exactly that of a  standard \" simulation algorithm such as used in ref .",
    "i performed two sets of studies using the qs method . the first is used to determine the qs order parameter ( defined as the faction @xmath25 of active sites ) , the moment ratio @xmath26 , and the mean lifetime @xmath27 of the quasistationary state , in the immediate vicinity of the critical point @xmath18 , for system sizes @xmath28 , 2000 , 5000 , 10@xmath0000 , 20@xmath0000 and 50@xmath0000 .",
    "( the qs lifetime is taken as the mean number of time steps between successive attempts to visit the absorbing state . )",
    "a second set of simulations is used to study the supercritical regime ( @xmath29 ) for system sizes @xmath30 , 20@xmath0000 and 50@xmath0000 .",
    "( for @xmath31 substantially larger than @xmath18 , the lifetime is much larger than the simulation time , so that the system never visits the absorbing state , and the qs method becomes identical to a standard simulation . )",
    "each realization of the process is run for 10@xmath32 time steps ; averages are taken in the qs regime , which necessitates discarding an initial transient that ranges from 10@xmath33 time steps ( for @xmath34 ) to 10@xmath35 time steps ( for @xmath36 ) .",
    "the number of saved configurations ranges from 1000 ( for @xmath34 ) to 400 ( for @xmath37 ) .",
    "the list updating probability @xmath38 ranges from @xmath39 ( for @xmath34 ) to @xmath40 ( for @xmath36 ) . during the initial relaxation period @xmath38",
    "is increased by a factor of ten to erase the memory of the initial configuration .",
    "i first discuss the studies focusing on the critical region . as in ref .",
    "@xcite , i study , for each system size , a series of particle number values @xmath41 , chosen so that @xmath42 lies immediately above or below @xmath18 .",
    "since the particle density can only be varied in steps of @xmath43 , estimates for properties at intermediate values of @xmath31 are obtained via interpolation .",
    "the results of the qs simulations were found to agree , to within uncertainty , with the corresponding results of conventional simulations @xcite , for @xmath44 , 2000 and 5000 .",
    "the criterion for criticality is power - law dependence of @xmath25 and @xmath27 on system size , i.e. , the familiar relations @xmath45 and @xmath46 , and constancy of the moment ratio @xmath47 with @xmath4 .",
    "the most sensitive indicator turns out to be the order parameter @xmath25 .",
    "using the data for system sizes 5000 - 50@xmath0000 , i rule out @xmath31 values that yield a statistically significant curvature of the graph of @xmath48 versus @xmath49 .",
    "this results in the estimate @xmath50 .",
    "( for the remainder of the analysis @xmath18 is fixed at this value and is no longer available as an adjustable parameter . )",
    "the associated exponent is @xmath51 , where the uncertainty represents a contribution ( @xmath52 ) due to the uncertainty in @xmath18 and a small additional uncertainty in the linear fit to the data .",
    "simulation results for @xmath25 as a function of @xmath4 , for various densities near @xmath18 , are shown in fig . 1 ; curvature of the plots for off - critical values is evident in the inset .    the data for the qs lifetime @xmath27 furnish a similar but somewhat less precise estimate , @xmath53 .",
    "fitting the data for @xmath54 - 50@xmath0000 , using the @xmath18 interval obtained from the analysis of @xmath25 ,",
    "i find @xmath55 .",
    "the moment ratio @xmath47 is also useful for setting limits on @xmath18 . as shown in fig .",
    "2 , this quantity appears to grow with system size for @xmath56 and vice - versa ; we may rule out the values 0.92976 and 0.92980 on this basis . the moment ratio data yield @xmath57 .",
    "the main contribution to the uncertainties in @xmath58 and @xmath47 is again due to the uncertainty in @xmath18 .",
    "the present estimate for @xmath18 is significantly greater than that found in ref .",
    "@xcite , although the difference amounts to about 0.01% .",
    "the results for the exponent @xmath58 are consistent , but the present study yields a substantially ( 16% ) lower estimate for @xmath59 than reported previously . the present result for @xmath60 is also substantially lower than the value 1.1596(4 ) reported in ref . @xcite .",
    "these differences highlight the strong finite - size corrections affecting stochastic sandpiles .",
    "i turn now to the results for the order parameter in the supercritical regime .",
    "3 shows that the data for system sizes 10@xmath0000 , 20@xmath0000 and 50@xmath0000 are well converged for @xmath61 , that is , finite - size effects are only present nearer the critical point",
    ". evidently , the data are not consistent with a simple power law of the form @xmath62 .",
    "indeed this departure from the familiar behavior of the order parameter was already noted ( with data for smaller systems ) in ref . @xcite . in the latter work the power law was ",
    "restored \" by introducing a size - dependent critical density @xmath63 , leading to a series of estimates for the critical exponent @xmath64 that increase systematically with @xmath4 , apparently converging to @xmath65 . with the present data , which are converged over a broader range of @xmath66 values",
    ", i find that shifting the critical value _ does not lead to an apparent power law_.    one is therefore left to conclude that either the order parameter does not obey power - law scaling , or that there are unusually strong corrections to scaling . including a correction to scaling term",
    ", one has    @xmath67 \\label{cts}\\ ] ]    so that there are now three adjustable parameters , @xmath64 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "even with a reasonably large number of data points ( 18 for @xmath70 ) , this induces a huge range of variation in the exponent @xmath64 .",
    "decent fits can be obtained with values as low as @xmath71 and as large as 0.3 .    to resolve this difficulty i return to the data in the immediate vicinity of @xmath18 .",
    "these data can be used to determine the correlation length exponent @xmath72 in the following manner .",
    "finite - size scaling implies that for @xmath73 , the moment ratio obeys the relation    @xmath74    where @xmath75 is a scaling function .",
    "this implies that    @xmath76    moreover , the finite - size expression @xmath77 implies that    @xmath78    and similarly for the derivative of @xmath79 at the critical point .",
    "the derivatives are evaluated numerically as follows . for each value of @xmath4",
    "studied , data for five values of @xmath31 clustered around @xmath18 are fit with a cubic polynomial ; the derivative of the polynomial is then evaluated at @xmath18 .",
    "the resulting derivatives are plotted in fig .",
    "4 ; clean power laws are observed , leading to @xmath80 , 1.323(14 ) and 1.372(21 ) , using the data for @xmath48 , @xmath47 and @xmath79 , respectively . pooling these results yields the estimate @xmath81 .",
    "then , using the values for @xmath59 and @xmath58 reported above , i find @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "using this value for @xmath64 , the data for the order parameter in the supercritical regime can be fit using the correction to scaling form , eq .",
    "[ cts ] , with parameters @xmath84 and @xmath85 . for @xmath86 , the correction term @xmath87 in eq .",
    "[ cts ] is @xmath88 , showing that there are sizeable deviations from a pure power law .",
    "it is usual to verify scaling by seeking a data collapse , plotting @xmath89 versus @xmath90 .",
    "for @xmath91 the order parameter does not follow a pure power law and so the data can not collapse .",
    "it is nevertheless of interest to construct such a scaling plot ( fig .",
    "although the data do not collapse over most of the range , they do collapse in the interval @xmath92 .",
    "a linear fit to the data in this interval yields a slope of 0.27(1 ) .",
    "this is close to the @xmath64 value obtained from the finite - size scaling analysis , suggesting that simple scaling is restricted to a narrow interval very near the critical point .",
    "a study of the one - dimensional restricted - height stochastic sandpile using quasistationary simulations permits study of systems an order of magnitude larger than previously studied , and yields critical properties different than those obtained previously . in the case of the critical density ,",
    "the small change ( about 0.01% ) from the previous estimate may be attributed to finite - size effects , which are known to affect sandpile models strongly .    of greater concern are critical exponent values , since they define the universality class of the model . since there is every reason ( based on symmetry considerations ) to expect the restricted sandpile to belong to the same universality class as the unrestricted version ( indeed , this seems well established in two dimensions @xcite ) ,",
    "i collect , in table i , critical exponent values from various studies of stochastic sandpiles , c - dp and the conserved threshold transfer process ( cttp ) , also expected to belong to the same class .",
    "the overall conclusion from table i is that studies using smaller lattices yield values in the range 0.38 - 0.42 for the exponent @xmath64 ( ref .",
    "@xcite is however an exception ) , and that the large - scale simulation of ref .",
    "@xcite , the numerical study of the c - dp field theory @xcite and the present work yield a consistent set of results , with @xmath93 .",
    "( a similar value has been found for a modified conserved lattice gas model @xcite . )",
    "although the system size ( 4000 sites ) used in the field theory simulations is not large , one should note that each ` site ' in such a simulation may represent a region comprising many lattice sites in the original model .",
    "compared with the earlier sandpile simulations , the distinctive feature of the present work may not be system size , but the fact that here the exponent @xmath64 is determined via finite - size scaling _ at the critical point _ , rather than from the usual analysis of the order parameter in the supercritical regime . indeed , it is easy to see from fig .",
    "3 that data for @xmath94 in the range @xmath39 - @xmath95 will yield larger estimates for @xmath64 .",
    "( the same observation applies to the cam analysis @xcite , which essentially probes the shape of the function @xmath96 at some distance from the critical point @xmath97 . )",
    "i observe a simple power - law behavior , and data collapse for various lattice sizes , only in a restricted range of the scaling variable @xmath98 .",
    "also included in table i are exponent values for one - dimensional directed percolation @xcite .",
    "the values obtained in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , as well as in the present work , are not very different from those of dp .",
    "a clear difference from dp scaling was however demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the initial decay exponent for one - dimensional c - dp is found to be @xmath99 , as opposed to @xmath100 for dp .",
    "the rather substantial differences found here in @xmath59 , and in the moment ratio @xmath47 ( 1.142(8 ) for the restricted sandpile compared with 1.1736(1 ) for dp @xcite ) , lend further support to the conclusion that the c - dp / stochastic sandpile universality class is distinct from that of directed percolation , as is evidently the case in two dimensions .",
    "( this despite the result @xcite , that when suitably modified to include ` sticky grains ' , sandpiles fall generically in the dp class . )    in summary , i have applied the quasistationary simulation method to a one - dimensional restricted - height stochastic sandpile , and obtained results consistent with recent studies of c - dp .",
    "this supports the assertion that the latter class includes stochastic sandpiles , as would be expected on the basis of symmetry and conservation laws .",
