    "cosmological biasing predicts that large - scale dark - matter fluctuations help push small - scale fluctuations over the density contrast required for gravitational collapse to occur @xcite , meaning that aggregates of rich clusters are expected to trace super - structures in the same way that aggregates of galaxies trace rich clusters .",
    "radio galaxies are ideal tracers of super - structures because they are associated with massive elliptical galaxies , which themselves tend to reside in clusters . because they are biased tracers of the mass @xcite , they therefore allow us to search large sky areas efficiently .",
    "it is only with the advent of radio surveys such as nvss @xcite and first @xcite that we can compile the large area samples of faint radio galaxies that we need to study the large - scale structure .",
    "the tons08 ( texas - oxford nvss structure 08@xmath9 region ) survey is in one of the areas covered by the 7crs @xcite and the texox-1000 ( toot ) survey @xcite . unlike 7crs or toot ,",
    "the tons08 survey is selected at 1.4 ghz from the nvss survey .",
    "it therefore goes to fainter radio flux densities than toot .",
    "it also has an optical magnitude limit imposed on it ( see @xcite ) .",
    "tons08 was specifically designed to seek further evidence for a giant super - structure found in this region of sky by analysis of the redshift distribution of in the 7c - ii survey @xcite .",
    "the redshift distribution in the 7c - ii survey revealed a prominent spike at @xmath10 @xmath4 0.25 of five radio galaxies from the 7crs . by going to fainter radio flux densities",
    "( @xmath11 3 mjy ) and optical limits ( @xmath1219.5 ) , the tons08 sample was optimised for looking at clustering of objects in a region of moderate ( 0 @xmath13 @xmath10 @xmath13 0.5 ) redshifts .",
    "the selection criteria for the tons08 survey was based on cross - matching positions of objects in radio ( nvss ) and optical ( apm ) surveys . to ensure a complete , flux - density - limited survey , we plotted radio contours from the first survey over optical poss - ii images , identifying radio galaxy identifications by eye .",
    "we obtained optical spectra for all the 84 radio galaxies in tons08 .",
    "all but three had secure redshifts ( see @xcite for spectra and more details ) . a representation of the three - dimensional distribution of the tons08 sample is shown in fig .",

    "in order to determine how significant the redshift spikes are , and to determine the radio galaxy overdensity , we constructed a model redshift distribution .",
    "this was obtained by fitting a model bivariate ( radio and optical ) luminosity function ( blf ) to data from radio galaxies in the 2dfgrs @xcite and integrating it over the optical and radio selection limits .",
    "a much more accurate and representative redshift distribution is obtained because the sky area is @xmath4 13-times larger than the tons08 area .",
    "the model redshift distribution , normalised to the tons08 sky area is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : zdistn_rlf ] . also plotted is the binned tons08 redshift distribution .",

    "[ fig:3d ] can be clearly seen as redshift spikes in fig .",
    "[ fig : zdistn_rlf ] . to determine whether they are significant",
    ", we used a simple method using poisson statistics in each redshift bin to work out the probability that the number of galaxies could be greater than the actual number given the number predicted by the model .",
    "we excluded the four 7c - ii objects at redshift @xmath16 0.27 to find independent evidence for redshift spikes , and found that the redshift spike at @xmath16 0.27 would be expected in only 0.3 per cent of random realisations .",
    "a redshift spike as large as the one at @xmath16 0.35 would , as a new feature in any one of the bins , be expected in 4 per cent of random realisations .",
    "we performed the same calculations using redshift distributions corresponding to the @xmath17 error on the model redshift distribution .",
    "this increases the chance of there being such a peak to 0.6 per cent and 14 per cent of random realisations for the @xmath16 0.27 and @xmath16 0.35 redshift spikes respectively .",
    "we conclude that the redshift spike at @xmath10=0.27 is significant , but that evidence for the @xmath10=0.35 redshift spike is less secure .    to match the data to theoretical overdensities , we chose to calculate overdensities in 50-mpc radius spheres centred at the peaks of the redshift spikes . in this case",
    "we found 13 radio galaxies in the @xmath10=0.27 super - structure and 12 in the @xmath10=0.35 super - structure .",
    "we find an overdensity of @xmath18 for the @xmath10=0.27 redshift peak and @xmath19 for the z=0.35 redshift peak .",
    "the errors quoted are 68 per cent confidence limits .",
    "the overdensity for the @xmath10=0.35 super - structure is larger than that of the @xmath10=0.27 super - structure even though the model redshift distribution is higher at @xmath10=0.35 .",
    "this is because the 50-mpc sphere takes up less of the survey sky area for the @xmath10=0.35 super - structure .",
    "to determine how probable it is that we detected these two super - structures , we calculated the probability of the tons08 survey intercepting such structures given the cosmological parameters and different degrees of radio galaxy bias .",
    "this was done using standard structure formation theory ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "we used a log - normal ( ln ) random field @xcite to make some attempt at correcting the mass overdensity to a non - linear - corrected mass overdensity .",
    "[ fig : prob_bias ] shows the probability of intercepting a super - structure of radius 50-mpc and the galaxy overdensity of the two super - structures .",
    "we assume the local value for the radio galaxy bias factor is @xmath20=1.65@xmath21 .",
    "this is determined by multiplying the relative bias factor of radio galaxies to optical galaxies ( 1.9/1.3=1.5@xmath22 6 per cent calculated by @xcite ) with the bias factor of optical galaxies relative to the dark matter ( 1.1@xmath227 per cent calculated by @xcite , and adding the errors in quadrature .",

    "if we assume a relatively high value for @xmath23 ( 0.94 ) and that the radio galaxy bias parameter is the same as for smaller scales in the local universe , fig .",
    "[ fig : prob_bias ] forces us to conclude that we have been very fortunate in our choice of survey area and have found two rare ( 4 and 5 @xmath5 ) fluctuations of which we would expect only 0.05 and 3@xmath24 in our sample volume ( for the @xmath10=0.27 and @xmath25 super - structures respectively ) .    to explain these results in the framework of standard @xmath26cdm model and the inflationary ( i.e.  gaussian fluctuation ) paradigm for structure formation , we need to determine why there is such a discrepancy between this theoretical result and the fact that we have found two super - structures in such a small survey volume .",
    "the probability of seeing two such fluctuations in tons08 is strongly dependent on how representative the survey region is of the universe .",
    "if , by targeting a structure discovered in the 7crs , we have focused on a particularly unusual part of the universe , then the probability of seeing two super - structures is roughly equal to the probability of finding only the @xmath10=0.35 super - structure , namely @xmath27 .",
    "if , however , the tons08 target region turns out to be a reasonably representative one , then given our assumptions , the probability of seeing two super - structures is @xmath28 .",
    "the most likely explanation of our results is that radio galaxies in super - structures are extremely biased tracers of mass ( i.e. more biased than local radio galaxies ) . this could be due to redshift evolution of the bias factor and/or due to different mechanisms being at work on super - structure scales . assuming an evolution of the bias factor with redshift that is consistent with previous studies @xcite , some boosting of bias in super - structures is still needed .",
    "we suggest that the most promising way of reconciling the low probability of tons08 intercepting both super - structures with the fact that we have detected them is either that the radio galaxies within the super - structure have a higher bias factor than is derived for large samples of radio galaxies at @xmath290 @xcite and @xmath291 @xcite and/or they trace collapsing systems",
    ". there are several plausible explanations for this .",
    "perhaps collapsed sub - structure within the super - structure , i.e. rich clusters , hosts the radio galaxies and the high bias simply reflects that of the rare rich clusters . perhaps there is an enhanced group - group merger rate within the super - structure which is enhancing radio galaxy triggering .",
    "perhaps as the super - structure goes non - linear , redshift space distortions and/or enhanced triggering due to high velocities boost the bias .",
    "the good news is that it may be possible to discriminate between these possibilities by studying the environment of the radio galaxies within the two super - structures and we are in the process of doing this .",
