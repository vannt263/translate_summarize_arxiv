    "since the measurements of top quark properties in run  i at the fermilab tevatron have small statistics , there remains plenty of room for new physics in the top quark sector .",
    "this stimulates a lot of efforts in the study of the top quark as a probe of new physics .",
    "theoretical studies show that the top quark processes are sensitive to new physics @xcite . in some new physics models like the popular minimal supersymmetric model ( mssm ) and the topcolor - assisted technicolor ( tc2 ) model @xcite",
    ", the top quark may have some exotic production and decay channels @xcite . among these exotic processes ,",
    "one kind is induced by the flavor - changing neutral - current ( fcnc ) interactions , which are extremely suppressed in the sm but could be significantly enhanced in some extensions @xcite . searching for these exotic processes will serve as a good probe for new physics .",
    "now such possibilities exist on our horizon : the ongoing fermilab tevatron collider , the upcoming cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) and the planned international linear collider ( ilc ) will allow to scrutinize the top quark nature @xcite .",
    "due to its rather clean environment , the ilc will be an ideal machine to probe new physics .",
    "in such a collider , in addition to @xmath0 collision , we can also realize @xmath2 collision and @xmath1 collision with the photon beams generated by the backward compton scattering of incident electron and laser beams @xcite .",
    "the fcnc top - charm associated productions via @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath2 collisions will be a sensitive probe for different new physics models and should be seriously examined . while these processes have been studied thoroughly in the mssm @xcite , the corresponding studies in the tc2 model are not complete : so far only the production at @xmath7 collision has been studied @xcite . from the studies of these processes in the mssm",
    "@xcite we know that the @xmath0 collision channel has a much smaller rate than @xmath2 collision or @xmath1 collision .",
    "so it is necessary to consider all the production channels to complete the calculations in tc2 models .",
    "this is one aim of this article .",
    "the other aim of this article is to compare the @xmath8 production rates predicted by different new physics models . such analysis will help to distinguish different models once the production rate is measured at the ilc .",
    "the reason for examining the tc2 effects in such top quark processes is two - fold .",
    "one is that the tc2 model is a popular realization of the fancy idea of technicolor and remains a typical candidate for new physics in the direction of dynamical symmetry breaking .",
    "this model has not been excluded by experiments so far and will face the test at future collider experiments .",
    "the other reason is that the tc2 model may have richer top - quark phenomenology than other new physics models since it treats the top quark differently from other fermions .",
    "in fact , the tc2 model predicts some anomalous couplings for the top quark , among which the most notable ones occur in the flavor - changing sector@xcite .",
    "so the tc2 model may predict a large top - charm associated production rate and hence single it out from other new physics models .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "ii presents the calculations of the top - charm associated productions in tc2 model at the ilc .",
    "iii compares the tc2 results with the predictions of the two - higgs - doublet model and the mssm . a discussion on observability at the ilc is given in sec .",
    "iv and the conclusion is given in sec .",
    "among various kinds of dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking models , the tc2 model @xcite is especially attractive since it connects the top quark with the electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) . in this model ,",
    "the topcolor interactions make small contributions to the ewsb , but give rise to the main part of the top quark mass @xmath9 with a model dependent parameter @xmath10 .",
    "the technicolor interactions play a main role in the ewsb , and the extend technicolor ( etc ) interactions generate masses of lighter fermions and give contribution @xmath11 to the full @xmath12 .",
    "this model predicts some scalars such as top - pions ( @xmath13 ) , which are condensates of the third generation quarks and have strong couplings with the third generation quarks . the existence of these new particles can be regarded as a typical feature of the tc2 model .",
    "another feature of the tc2 model is the existence of large flavor - changing couplings@xcite . in tc2 models the topcolor interactions are non - universal and",
    "therefore do not posses a glashow - illiopoulos - maiani ( gim ) mechanism .",
    "this non - universal gauge interactions result in some fcnc vertices when one writes the interactions in the quark mass eigenbasis .",
    "furthermore , the neutral scalars of tc2 model as @xmath14 condensates also exhibits the same fcnc vertices .",
    "for instance , the interactions of top - pions take the form@xcite @xmath15,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the top - pion decay constant , @xmath17 gev , and @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the rotation matrices that transform the weak eigenstates of left - handed up - type , down - type and right - handed up - type quarks to the mass eigenstates , respectively .    in tc2 model , both the up - type and down - type quark mass matrices ( @xmath21 and @xmath22 ) exhibit an approximate triangle texture at ewsb scale due to the generic topcolor breaking pattern@xcite , which can severely restrict the forms of the matrices @xmath23s in eq.(1 ) and in turn , may lead to contradiction with low energy data .",
    "such a problem was addressed in @xcite and it was observed that , given the textures of the mass matrices , it is possible to find a natural solution of the @xmath23s to evade all the low energy constraints . in this solution , a realistic but simple pattern of @xmath18 and @xmath19 is constructed so that the measured ckm elements are reproduced , and further , the form of @xmath24 , the information of which is hidden in the sm , can be obtained using the expressions of @xmath25 and @xmath18",
    ". one distinctive character of @xmath24 is that the mixing between @xmath26 and @xmath27 can be naturally large , reaching @xmath28 .",
    "this is what we are interested in .",
    "values of the elements of the @xmath23s relevant to our discussion are@xcite @xmath29 with @xmath30 denoting the topcolor contribution to the top quark mass .",
    "the tc2 model also predicts a cp - even scalar @xmath31 , called top - higgs @xcite , which is a @xmath32 bound state and analogous to the @xmath33 particle in low energy qcd .",
    "its couplings to quarks are similar to that of the neutral top - pion except that the top - higgs is cp - even while the neutral top - pion is cp - odd .",
    "since the tc2 contribution to the process @xmath34 in @xmath7 collision has already been calculated in the literature @xcite , we focus on the processes @xmath35 in @xmath36 collision and @xmath37 in @xmath38 collision . for completeness we will also take into account the process @xmath39 for @xmath7 collision , where the @xmath40 particles are radiated out from the @xmath41 and @xmath42 beams . although it is a high - order process compared with @xmath43 , its contributions may not be underestimated since there is no @xmath44-channel suppression .    in tc2 model ,",
    "the process @xmath35 proceeds at loop - level by exchanging the top - pions or top - higgs .",
    "the corresponding feynman diagrams are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] . compared with the corresponding diagrams in the mssm@xcite ,",
    "the contributions of tc2 model involve additional @xmath44-channel contributions , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1](r ) . the effective coupling between top - pion ( top - higgs ) and photons can be written as : @xmath45 where @xmath46 , @xmath47}{x}$ ] , @xmath48 , @xmath49 is the electric charge of the top quark , @xmath50 denote the momentum of the photons , and @xmath51 are the polarization vectors of the photons . for the top - pion ( top - higgs ) within the range between @xmath52 and @xmath53",
    ", the top - pion ( top - higgs ) decays dominantly into @xmath54@xcite , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57,@xmath58 , @xmath59,@xmath60 and @xmath61 . generally speaking ,",
    "the dominant decay mode is @xmath62 for @xmath63 , @xmath55 for @xmath64 and @xmath65 for @xmath66 . ] and thus such @xmath44-channel contributions become dominant if the c.m",
    ". energy of @xmath67 collision is high enough to produce a real top - pion ( top - higgs ) . in this case",
    "the cross section of top - charm associated production in the tc2 model may be quite large . in our calculation , we have considered all the decay channels of the top - pion and top - higgs and taken into account the width effects in the @xmath44-channel propagators .",
    "note that the reliability for doing such perturbative calculations should be carefully checked since the yukawa couplings between the top - pion and the top quark might be large in tc2 model .",
    "for example , from eq.(1 ) we see that such coupling strength is @xmath68 , which yields @xmath69 for a typical value of @xmath70 ( @xmath71 gev ) , a large value but still making the perturbative expansion valid .",
    "one may then wonder whether the perturbative expansion involving such large yukawa couplings converge well , or , in other words , whether the tc2 yukawa corrections to top quark processes can drastically change the leading order predictions .",
    "actually , such large yukawa couplings are often present in new physics models such as the two - higgs doublet model @xcite and the supersymmetric model @xcite with small or large @xmath72 .",
    "one - loop yukawa corrections to top production processes at hadron and linear colliders have been calculated @xcite , and it was observed that the corrections can maximally reach @xmath73 in amplitude and drop rapidly as the scalars becoming heavy .",
    "so we believe that the perturbative expansion involving the tc2 yukawa couplings is still a good expansion .",
    "another point that should be addressed is whether the top - pions can be regarded as point - like particles at the ilc energy . in the tc2 model",
    "the strong top - color gauge interaction causes the top - quark to condensate , which leads to the presence of top - pions .",
    "the compositeness scale of top - pions is about the mass scale of top - color gauge boson , which is usually assumed to be a few tev@xcite .",
    "so at the ilc energy ( a few hundred gev to 1 tev ) , the top - pions can be regarded as point - like particles .",
    "theoretically , the masses of top - pions can be quite light , well below the top - color scale , since they are a kind of pseudo goldstone bosons ( a detailed discussion on their masses are given in the proceeding section)@xcite .",
    "so the top - pions may be accessible at the ilc although the top - color scale is well above the ilc energy .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath35 can be written as @xmath74 where the sum is over all feynman diagrams and for each diagram @xmath75 takes the form @xmath76 here , @xmath77 are the momentum of outgoing top and charm quarks . the coefficients @xmath78 ( @xmath79 , @xmath80 ) can be obtained by a straightforward calculation of each feynman diagram . for the sake of conciseness , we do not present their lengthy expressions here .",
    "we checked that all ultraviolet divergences cancel out in our results , which is essentially guaranteed by the renormalizability .",
    "we also checked that our results satisfy the ward identity , @xmath81 and @xmath82 with @xmath83 being the sum of @xmath84 .",
    "in fact , the @xmath44-channel contribution mediated by either top - pion or top - higgs ( shown in fig.[fig : fig1 ] ( r ) ) satisfies the ward identity separately .",
    "this fact enables one to consider the @xmath44-channel contribution separately , as in ref@xcite . for the convenience of our discussion",
    ", we will divide tc2 contributions into the @xmath44-channel contribution and the non @xmath44-channel contribution , the latter of which includes the contributions from the @xmath85-channel , @xmath86-channel , quadric as well as box diagrams .",
    "the @xmath87 production in @xmath1 collision proceeds through the process @xmath88 , where the @xmath89-beam is generated by the backward compton scattering of incident electron- and laser - beam and the @xmath40 is radiated from @xmath41 beam .",
    "the subprocess @xmath90 has the same feynman diagrams as those shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] . in our calculation",
    "we use the weizs@xmath91cker - williams approximation @xcite which treats @xmath40 from @xmath41 beam as a real photon .",
    "thus the cross section is given by @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the probability of finding a photon with a fraction @xmath94 of energy @xmath95 in an ultra - relativistic electron and is given by @xcite @xmath96 note that the incoming electron may also radiate @xmath97-boson to contribute to the process @xmath98 .",
    "however , such contribution is suppressed by the probability function of finding a @xmath97-boson in an ultra - relativistic electron @xcite and can be safely neglected .    as for @xmath99 in @xmath0 collision",
    ", its cross section can be obtained by folding @xmath100 with @xmath101 , as done in eq.([e - gamma ] ) , @xmath102 where we define @xmath103 . in tc2 model , it is argued that the top - higgs may couple directly with @xmath104 or @xmath105@xcite .",
    "if so , the processes @xmath106 and @xmath107 may also be important for top - charm associated production at @xmath0 collision @xcite .",
    "we will take the results of ref.@xcite for comparison in our discussions .    for both @xmath2 collision and @xmath38 collision",
    ", the photon beams are generated by the backward compton scattering of incident electron- and laser - beams just before the interaction point .",
    "the events number is obtained by convoluting the cross section with the photon beam luminosity distribution . for @xmath108 collider the events number",
    "is obtained by @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the photon beam luminosity distribution and @xmath111 , with @xmath112 being the energy - square of @xmath7 collision , is defined as the effective cross section of @xmath113 . in optimum case , it can be written as @xcite @xmath114 where @xmath115 denotes the energy spectrum of the back - scattered photon for unpolarized initial electron and laser photon beams given by @xmath116 the definitions of parameters @xmath117 , @xmath118 and @xmath119 can be found in @xcite . in our numerical calculation , we choose @xmath120 , @xmath121 and @xmath122 .    for the @xmath123 collider",

    "noting the fact @xmath130 for the integrated range of x , one can infer that the cross section at @xmath67 collider is the largest , which will be shown in our results .",
    "in the following the major part of discussions will be focused on the production in @xmath108 collision .      in our numerical study ,",
    "the bottom and charm quark masses will be neglected , and the charge conjugate @xmath131 production channel is also included . the cross sections of top - charm associated productions in tc2 model depend on @xmath10 , @xmath132 , the top - pion decay constant @xmath16 and the masses of the top - pions and top - higgs . before starting numerical calculations , we recapitulate the theoretical and experimental constraints on these parameters .    * about the @xmath10 parameter . in tc2 model , @xmath133 parameterizes the portion of etc contribution to the top quark mass .",
    "the bare value of @xmath133 is generated at the etc scale , and subject to very large radiative enhancement from topcolor and @xmath134 by a factor of order @xmath135 when evolving down to the weak scale@xcite .",
    "this @xmath133 can induce a nonzero top - pion mass ( proportional to @xmath136 ) @xcite and thus ameliorate the problem of having dangerously light scalars .",
    "numerical analysis shows that , with reasonable choice of other input parameters , @xmath133 of order @xmath137 may induce top - pions as massive as the top quark@xcite .",
    "indirect phenomenological constraints on @xmath133 come from low energy flavor changing processes such as @xmath138 @xcite .",

    "we fix conservatively @xmath144 . *",
    "the parameter @xmath145 is upper bounded by unitary relation @xmath146 . for a @xmath133 value smaller than @xmath147 ,",

    "such a large value is less attractive since by the original idea of technicolor theory@xcite , one expects new physics scale should not be far higher than the weak scale . on the other hand , if one believe new physics exists at tev scale , i.e. @xmath156 tev , then @xmath157 gev , which means that @xmath14 condensation alone can not be wholly responsible for ewsb and to break electroweak symmetry needs the joint effort of topcolor and other interactions like technicolor . from the experimental point of view , probably the best way to determine @xmath70 is by precisely measuring the coupling strength of top - higgs with vector bosons at future linear collider , which is proportional to @xmath70 without any theoretical ambiguity@xcite . by the way , eq.([ft ] )",
    "should be understood as only a rough guide , and @xmath70 may in fact be somewhat lower or higher , say in the range @xmath158 gev . allowing @xmath70 to vary over this range",

    "some estimates have been done .",
    "the mass splitting between the neutral top - pion and the charged top - pion should be small since it comes only from the electroweak interactions@xcite .",
    "ref.@xcite has estimated the mass of top - pions using quark loop approximation and showed that @xmath160 is allowed to be a few hundred gev in reasonable parameter space .",
    "like eq.([ft ] ) , such estimations can only be regarded as a rough guide and the precise values of top - pion masses can be determined only by future experiments .",
    "the mass of the top - higgs @xmath31 can be estimated in the nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) model in the large @xmath161 approximation and is found to be about @xmath162 @xcite .",
    "this estimation is also rather crude and the mass below the @xmath163 threshold is quite possible in a variety of scenarios @xcite . on the experimental side ,",
    "current experiments have restricted the mass of the charged top - pion .",
    "for example , the absence of @xmath164 implies that @xmath165 gev @xcite and @xmath166 analysis yields @xmath167 gev @xcite .",
    "for the neutral top - pion and top - higgs , the experimental restrictions on them are rather weak .",
    "( of course , considering theoretically that the mass splitting between the neutral and charged top - pions is small , the @xmath166 bound on the charged top - pion mass should be applicable to the neutral top - pion masses . )",
    "the current bound on techni - pions@xcite does not apply here since the properties of top - pion are quite different from those of techni - pions .",
    "the direct search for the neutral top - pion ( top - higgs ) via @xmath168 with @xmath169 was proven to be hopeless at tevatron for the top - pion ( top - higgs ) heavier than @xmath170 gev @xcite .",
    "the single production of @xmath171 ( @xmath172 ) at tevatron with @xmath171 ( @xmath172 ) mainly decaying to @xmath55 may shed some light on detecting top - pion ( top - higgs)@xcite , but the potential for the detection is limited by the value of @xmath145 and the detailed background analysis is absent now .",
    "anyhow , these mass bounds will be greatly tightened at the upcoming lhc @xcite . combining the above theoretical and experimental bounds",
    ", we will assume @xmath173    fig.[fig : fig2 ] shows the dependence of the cross section of @xmath174 on @xmath160 under the assumption @xmath175 .",
    "one sees that for @xmath176 gev , the cross section first increases monotonously to reach its maximum value at @xmath177 , and then drops rapidly .",
    "this behavior may be explained as follows . for the results in fig.[fig : fig2 ] , the dominant contributions are from the @xmath44-channel diagrams ( we will comment on the effects of the non @xmath44-channel diagrams later ) , and the cross section then may be estimated by the narrow width approximation ( note that there is no interference between the contribution from the top - pion and that from the top - higgs due to the different cp property of @xmath171 and @xmath178 . ) : @xmath179 where @xmath180 is the rate for single top - pion ( top - higgs ) production , and @xmath181 is the branching fraction for @xmath182 . in the range @xmath183 , the cross section increases with @xmath160 since the @xmath184 decay mode of @xmath185(@xmath186 ) is getting a larger branching ratio and becoming dominant as @xmath160 increases .",
    "when @xmath160 passes the threshold of @xmath187 and keeps increasing , the cross section drops quickly since the @xmath188 is becoming the dominant decay mode of @xmath185(@xmath186 ) and @xmath189 is getting severely suppressed by the photon luminosity distribution .",
    "fig.[fig : fig2 ] shows that the @xmath8 production rate in @xmath2 collision can exceed @xmath135 fb . comparing with @xmath190 in @xmath0 collision , which can only reach @xmath191 fb in tc2 model @xcite due to the @xmath44-channel suppression",

    "there are two characters for such effects .",
    "one is that they are proportional to @xmath145 , and , therefore , may be sizable only for large values of @xmath145 .",

    "our findings are :    * in the most interesting range @xmath195 , the cross section is dominated by the @xmath44-channel contributions .",
    "the non @xmath44-channel effects , which in this case arise mainly from the interference with the @xmath44-channel diagrams , are less than @xmath196 .",
    "the main reason is that , as pointed earlier , in this region @xmath197 is the dominant decay mode of @xmath185 and @xmath186 produced in the @xmath44-channel .",
    "another reason is that under our assumption @xmath175 there exists a cancellation between the top - pion non @xmath44-channel diagrams and the top - higgs non @xmath44-channel diagrams .",
    "* in the heavy range @xmath198 , which is less interesting since the cross section is too small ( as shown in fig.[fig : fig2 ] ) , the cross section is also dominated by the @xmath44-channel contributions due to the cancellation of the non @xmath44-channel top - pion and top - higgs diagrams mentioned above . * in the light range @xmath199 , which is disfavored by @xmath166@xcite and thus the corresponding results are not shown here , the non @xmath44-channel contributions are dominant . in this region the @xmath44-channel contributions are suppressed since the top - pions and the top - higgs in the @xmath44-channel can not be on - shell .",
    "the non @xmath44-channel contributions are quite large in this region due to the following two reasons .",
    "one is that @xmath200 ( for @xmath86-channel ) and @xmath201 ( for @xmath85-channel ) in the propagators of the charm quark ( see fig.[fig : fig1 ] ( a , c , d , f , m , p ) ) can approach zero does not develop poles for the cross section since the poles from the @xmath86-channels are canceled by those from the @xmath85-channels . ] and thus the non @xmath44-channel contributions can be greatly enhanced .",
    "in fact , this is the advantage of @xmath67 collider over @xmath202 collider in exploring the top quark fcnc processes , as pointed out in ref.@xcite .",
    "the other reason is that the contributions from the box diagrams of fig.1 ( i - k ) are also quite sizable for light top - pions . from our numerical evaluation we found that in the region @xmath199 , among the non @xmath44-channel diagrams , the charged top - pion diagrams give dominant contributions and the cross section peaks at @xmath203 gev with @xmath204 . *",
    "note that our above analysis are under the assumption @xmath205 .",
    "although there is a good reason @xcite to expect the mass degeneracy for neutral and charged top - pions , the top - higgs mass @xmath206 may be quite different from the top - pion mass @xmath160(@xmath207 ) .",
    "if we allow a splitting between @xmath206 and @xmath160 , we found that in the allowed range of @xmath160 ( i.e. @xmath208 gev ) , the non @xmath44-channel contributions can be as large as @xmath209 for a relatively light top - higgs , as shown in fig.[fig : fig3 ] .",

    "fig.[fig : fig5 ] shows that @xmath221 .",
    "since the @xmath44-channel process @xmath222 is suppressed by the propagators of the intermediate photon or @xmath97-boson and was found @xcite to occur at a similar rate as @xmath223 shown in fig.[fig : fig5 ] , we conclude that the production rate in @xmath2 collision is largest at a linear collider .",
    "in this section , we first briefly recapitulate the sources of fcnc transitions in different models and then compare the typical magnitudes of various fcnc processes at the ilc predicted by different models .",
    "we arrive at the observation that the tc2 model predicts much larger fcnc transitions than other new physics models .",
    "it is well known that in the sm the fcnc transitions are absent at tree - level and can occur only at loop level by the gim mechanism .",
    "the source of such fcnc transitions is the non - diagonality of the cabbibo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix . in the extensions of the sm , although the ckm matrix can still induce additional contributions to fcnc via loops composed by new particles , some new sources for fcnc transitions usually come in .    as the simplest extension of the sm , the two - higgs - doublet model ( 2hdm )",
    "may naturally have fcnc mediated by the higgs bosons at tree - level , unless some ad hoc discrete symmetry is imposed .",
    "the generic type of 2hdm is the so - called `` type - iii '' model ( 2hdm - iii ) @xcite , in which the up - type and down - type quarks couple to both higgs doublets and thus the diagonalization of the quark mass matrices does not automatically ensure the diagonalization of the yukawa couplings . in a popular realization of 2hdm - iii ,",
    "one higgs doublet is responsible for the electroweak symmetry breaking as well as generating the fermion masses while the other doublet has fcnc couplings whose strength are usually parameterized as @xcite @xmath224 with @xmath225 being the generation indices , @xmath226 the quark masses and @xmath227 the dimensionless parameters . from eq.([coupling ] ) , we can learn the fcnc coupling without top quark is generally suppressed by the involved quark masses .",
    "one impressive feature of 2hdm - iii is that the coupling strengths of the fcnc are related with those of flavor - changing charged currents .",
    "the fcnc couplings @xmath228 and @xmath229 then contribute to some low energy observable and the bounds from low energy data are @xmath228 , @xmath230@xcite .",
    "the mssm @xcite also contains two higgs doublets .",
    "however , the homology of the superpotential requires that one doublet couple only to up - type quarks while the other doublet couple only to down - type quarks and hence avoids tree - level fcnc transitions in the higgs sector .",
    "note that when supersymmetry is broken , the couplings @xmath231 and @xmath232 are generated at one - loop level to induce fcnc yukawa couplings . while such fcnc couplings are generally small for up - type quarks , they may be quite large for down - type quarks due to the enhancement by large @xmath72@xcite .",
    "another source of fcnc in the mssm is the flavor mixings of sfermions@xcite , which induce fcnc transitions in the fermion sector through loops composed by sparticles , such as sfermion - gaugino loop and sfermion - higgsino loop@xcite .    as discussed in sec .",
    "ii , tc2 model , as one of the dynamic ewsb models , is quite different from the 2hdm and the mssm . in this model ,",
    "the scalar bosons are composite particles with properties quite similar to those of higgs bosons .",
    "one distinguished character of tc2 model is that the third generation quarks are special and have new top - color interaction@xcite .",
    "this non - universal topcolor interaction can result in fcnc transitions when expressing the interactions in terms of quark mass eigenstates .",
    "in particular , the triangle texture of the up - type quark mass matrix due to the generic top - color breaking pattern can lead to large flavor mixing between @xmath233 and @xmath234 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the fcnc transitions also exhibit themselves in the neutral scalar sector , which are @xmath14 condensates .",
    "therefore , the top flavor phenomenology is much richer in this model than in other models .",
    "so far as the top - charm associated productions are concerned , in the sm they are severely suppressed since they proceed through loops comprising of light down - type quarks ( much lighter than top quark mass scale ) and involving the small mixings between the third - generation quarks and the quarks of the first two generations .",
    "table i shows the rates for @xmath235 , @xmath236 and @xmath237 at the ilc . as can be seen , the rates predicted by the sm are too small to be accessible at the ilc .    in 2hdm - iii ,",
    "the process @xmath237 proceeds in a similar way to that in tc2 model except that the top - pions and top - higgs in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] should be replaced by the corresponding higgs bosons . however , due to the smallness of @xmath238 , its cross section is generally two orders lower than in the tc2 model . in table",
    "i , we present the predictions of 2hdm - iii for various production channels at the ilc .",
    "one impressive character is that the rates of @xmath239 and @xmath240 is comparable to @xmath237 and much larger than @xmath241 .",
    "the reason is that in 2hdm - iii the higgs bosons may couple at tree - level with @xmath104 or @xmath242 and , consequently , despite of the suppression of the probability to find the gauge bosons in an electron , its cross section may still be large@xcite .    in the mssm , @xmath243 proceeds via the loops comprising of squarks , gluinos , charginos and neutralinos .",
    "the corresponding results in table i are taken from @xcite where only susy - qcd contributions are considered .",
    "is generally larger than susy electroweak contributions @xcite , we may infer that the susy - qcd contributions represent the typical size of susy contributions .",
    "] as shown in table i , the cross sections in the mssm , although can be much large than the sm predictions , are generally much smaller than the tc2 predictions .",
    "the reason is twofold .",
    "one is that in the mssm there is no @xmath44-channel contribution like that shown in fig.1 ( r ) at one - loop level .",
    "the other reason is that there are cancellations between different diagrams due to the unitarity of the matrix diagonalizing the up - type squark mass matrix , which is often called the super - gim mechanism .",
    "table i : theoretical predictions for top - quark fcnc processes .",
    "the predictions of new physics models are optimum values .",
    "the @xmath7 collider energy is 500 gev for production processes .",
    "the cross sections are in the units of fb .",
    "the processes not referenced are estimated by us .    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     for completeness we also present the branching ratios of various top rare decays in table i. it may be surprising that the branching ratio of @xmath244 can reach @xmath245 in tc2 model if the top - higgs is light .",
    "in fact , this does not contradict with current experiments due to the small statistics of current top quark measurements @xcite .",
    "future bound on @xmath246 will not influence the optimum magnitude of @xmath247 since the favored region for the latter process is @xmath248 gev .",
    "we conclude from table i that tc2 model generally predicts much larger top quark fcnc transitions than any other models and the @xmath2 collision is the best channel in enhancing the magnitude for the top - charm associated productions at the ilc .",
    "given the predictions listed in table i , we now discuss their observability at the ilc .",
    "first , for the top rare decays other than @xmath249 , the hope to observe them at the ilc is dim since only about @xmath250 top quark events can be produced for an integrated luminosity of @xmath251 fb@xmath252 at the ilc @xcite . for the top - charm associated production processes , the observability is analyzed in the following .",
    "the cleanest signal for top - charm associated productions at the ilc is @xmath253 with @xmath254 being a light quark jet and @xmath255 or @xmath256 .",
    "generally speaking , the sm irreducible backgrounds for these processes are small due to the odd @xmath257-parity of the signal@xcite .",
    "so far as @xmath235 is concerned , the irreducible sm background arises from @xmath258 and is negligible due to the small size of @xmath259 .",
    "the leading sm background then comes from @xmath260 where the light quark jet @xmath261 or @xmath262 may be mis - identified as a @xmath257-jet .",
    "such backgrounds , mainly from @xmath263 pair productions as well as the @xmath263 bremsstrahlung processes @xmath264 , can reach @xmath265 fb in total @xcite .",
    "fortunately , these backgrounds can be efficiently suppressed by reconstructing the top - quark mass from the c.m .",
    "energy and the charm jet energy @xcite , _ i.e. _ @xmath266 with @xmath267 . according to the analysis in ref .",
    "@xcite , the @xmath8 production with a cross section larger than @xmath268 fb is observable at @xmath269 c.l .",
    "for an integrated luminosity of @xmath251 fb@xmath252 .",
    "from table i one sees that no new physics models can enhance the rate of @xmath270 to the level of @xmath268 fb .",
    "next we turn to the process @xmath271 .",
    "the signal is not as distinctive as @xmath235 due to the missing neutrinos .",
    "its sm reducible background is generated by processes such as @xmath272 and @xmath273 .",
    "these backgrounds can be suppressed by applying some useful cuts @xcite .",
    "so far the detailed monte carlo simulation for the observability of this process is still lacking .",
    "we expect conservatively that the production at the level of several fb may be accessible at the ilc . from table",
    "i we see that tc2 model can enhance this production to this level .",
    "finally , we consider the @xmath2 collision .",
    "the largest sm background for @xmath237 is from @xmath274 , which can reach @xmath275 pb . assuming a fixed c.m .",
    "energy of 500 gev for @xmath2 collision , a detailed monte carlo simulation @xcite showed that the background can be neglected at the expense of reducing the signal cross section to @xmath276 .",
    "noting the fact that the cuts used in @xcite are not sensitive to the energy of @xmath36 collision , one may infer that this conclusion is approximately valid for a realistic @xmath2 collision whose c.m .",
    "energy is not fixed .",
    "in fact , this point was also emphasized at the end of sec .",
    "iii and sec .",
    "iv in ref .",
    "@xcite . in practice , if we assume conservatively that the signal is reduced to @xmath277 to eliminate backgrounds , we may expect that the production @xmath3 as large as @xmath278 fb may be accessible at the ilc at @xmath279 level .",
    "compared with the predictions in table i , one sees that tc2 model can enhance the production @xmath3 to the observable level at the ilc in a large part of the parameter space .",
    "we calculated the top - charm associated productions via @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 collisions at linear colliders in the topcolor - assisted technicolor model .",
    "then we compared the results with the existing predictions of the sm , the general two - higgs - doublet model and the minimal supersymmetric model .",
    "we observed that the topcolor - assisted technicolor model predicts much larger production rates than other models and the largest - rate channel is @xmath237 , which can exceed 10 fb for a large part of the parameter space . from the analysis of the observability of such productions at the future linear colliders ,",
    "we conclude that the predictions of the topcolor - assisted technicolor model can reach the observable level for a large part of the parameter space while the optimum predictions of other models may lie below the accessible level .",
