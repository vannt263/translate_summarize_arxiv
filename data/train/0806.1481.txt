    "our discussion is based on the relaxation function established in the phenomenological relaxation theory @xcite .",
    "the microscopic representation of the relaxation function is given in the linear response theory @xcite .",
    "to explain the physical meaning of the relaxation functions , let us start from the israel - stewart equation for a simple system , where the conserved quantities are the energy and the momentum , and the dissipative effect comes solely from the shear viscosity .",

    "the meaning of eq.([eq:002 ] ) becomes clearer from the viewpoint of the phenomenological relaxation theory @xcite , where the linear but non - markovian constituent equation , @xmath26 is well established and @xmath27 is identically the relaxation function .",
    "therefore , we find that the israel - stewart causal hydrodynamics is equivalent to the special case of the phenomenological relaxation theory with @xmath28 i.e. , the exponentially damping relaxation function .",

    "equations ( [ eq:003 ] ) and ( [ eq:004 ] ) lead us to the relation between @xmath32 and @xmath38 given by @xmath39 this formula assures that the relaxation function can be obtained as the fourier transformation of @xmath40 , i.e. , the real part of the complex admittance @xcite , which is defined by @xmath41 here we notice the two important properties concerning the complex admittance @xmath42 : ( i ) the low - frequency and long - wavelength limit of the complex admittance , @xmath43 , gives the transport coefficients .",
    "in fact , with use of this representation , many groups @xcite have calculated the transport coefficients of qgp employing the lattice qcd .",
    "( ii ) using @xmath42 , we can write down the generic relaxation equation equivalent to the non - markovian constituent equation ( [ non - markov ] ) , @xmath44 by combining eqs.([eq : admittance ] ) and ( [ eq:2 - 004 ] ) , we can construct the relaxation equation from a given spectral function .",
    "the above observation tells us the following three points : ( a ) the relaxation function in qgp can be calculated from the spectral function for the microscopic current of qcd .",
    "( b ) the israel - stewart equation can be valid for the description of qgp only as long as the relaxation function calculated in the microscopic way is an exponentially damping function , and the relaxation time of qgp can be obtained as its damping time constant .",
    "( c ) if the relaxation function calculated from qcd is different from that derived from the israel - stewart equation , we should carry out the causal hydrodynamic calculation by incorporating the relaxation equation ( [ eq:2 - 004 ] ) or the non - markovian constituent equation ( [ non - markov ] ) into the continuity equation .",
    "it is interesting to investigate which spectral functions reproduce the exponentially damping relaxation function in the israel - stewart equation . taking the shear viscous dissipative process at the rest frame as a typical example",
    ", we find it to be a lorentzian function , @xmath45 in fact , it can be checked that eqs.([eq:005 ] ) and ( [ eq:2 - 005 ] ) give the exponentially damping relaxation function , @xmath46 and the correspondent complex admittance reads @xmath47 it is noteworthy that eq.([eq:2 - 004 ] ) with this complex admittance reproduces the israel - stewart - type relaxation equation , @xmath48 here we replace @xmath49 with @xmath50 in order to obtain the equation at an arbitrary frame from that at the rest frame .",
    "therefore it is found that the ansatz of the lorentzian - type spectral function shown in eq.([eq:2 - 005 ] ) is an essential point of the israel - stewart equation .",
    "notice that there is no reason to believe that the spectral function for the current of qcd is approximated well by the lorentzian function in the low - frequency and long - wavelength region .",
    "in this section , we demonstrate the first lattice qcd calculation of the relaxation function . from the viewpoint of availability of lattice data ,",
