    "the _ kepler _ space mission is designed to detect earth - like planets around solar - type stars with the transit method @xcite by monitoring continuously over 150000 stars with an unprecedented photometric precision .",
    "the lifetime of at least 3.5 years and the quasi - continuous observations make _ kepler _ an ideal tool to measure stellar photometric variability with a precision that is unachievable from the ground ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "ground - based photometric observations of cepheids usually consist of a few ( typically one or two ) observations per night .",
    "until now it has not been possible to adequately cover many consecutive pulsational cycles with ground - based photometry .",
    "ground - based studies of several types of variable stars  such as @xmath0sct stars , dov , dbv and dav white dwarfs , sdbv stars and roap stars  have benefited from multisite photometric observations .",
    "but because of their longer period , cepheids have not been the targets of such concerted efforts , with the notable exception of v473lyr @xcite .",
    "space - based cepheid observations were conducted earlier with the star tracker of the wire satellite and the solar mass ejection imager ( smei ) instrument on board the coriolis satellite @xcite .",
    "the lengths of these data sets ( @xmath1d ) are comparable to the nominal lifetime of the _ kepler _ mission .",
    "the wire and smei data of polaris ( @xmath2umi , @xmath3 ) confirmed that the pulsation amplitude of polaris has been increasing again , after a long period of decrease .",
    "_ kepler _ is capable of delivering comparably accurate photometric observations for the much fainter cepheid , v1154cyg ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "the kepler asteroseismic science consortium kasc was set up to exploit the _",
    "data for studying stellar pulsations .",
    "kasc working group number 7 ( wg7 ) is dedicated to the investigation of cepheids . in compliance with one of the original kasc proposals submitted before the launch of the space telescope , we searched for cepheids among a list of 40 targets , including the only previously known cepheid v1154cyg ( kic7548061 ) in the field . in this paper",
    "we describe the first results from _ kepler _ observations of a cepheid and a couple of not confirmed cepheids , complemented by extended ground - based follow - up observations .",
    "values ( small squares ) .",
    "the plot contains 5987 kasc targets ( red plus signs ) ; the selected cepheid candidates are shown by full ( blue ) squares .",
    "v1154cyg , the only confirmed cepheids is denoted by a large ( blue ) square .",
    "the linear cepheid instability strip is denoted by dashed lines.,height=309 ]    [ cols=\">,<,>,>,>,<,^ , < \" , ]      cepheids pulsate in one of the first three radial modes ( fundamental ( f ) , first ( o1 ) and second overtone ( o2 ) ) or simultaneously in two or three of them .",
    "some triple - mode cepheids pulsate in the first three overtones at the same time . from a pulsational and evolutionary point of view",
    "it is important to determine the pulsational mode of a monoperiodic cepheid .",
    "cepheids with pulsational periods similar to v1154cyg may pulsate in the fundamental or the first overtone mode .",
    "the usual way of distinction is the use of fourier parameters that show characteristic progression as a function of period .",
    "however , the fourier parameters of radial velocity curves are indistinguishable for fundamental and first overtone pulsators with periods around 5d ( see fig.3 of @xcite ) .",
    "light curve fourier parameters suffer from similar problems . based on fig.[fps ] ,",
    "@xmath5 and @xmath6 are the most promising parameters for mode discrimination .",
    "however , a closer inspection reveals that there is a @xmath7 difference between @xmath6 values of fundamental and first overtone galactic cepheids close to 5d period , therefore this particular phase difference is not a good discriminator in the case of v1154cyg .",
    "@xmath5 is higher for f cepheids , and lower for o1 cepheids .",
    "however it is amplitude dependent , and if we decrease the amplitude of the f cepheid it also goes to zero .",
    "v1154cyg is not a low - amplitude cepheid , and based on @xmath5 alone , it can be classified as a fundamental mode pulsator .",
    "though to draw a firm conclusion , we need more pieces of evidence .    analysis of the first order phase lag ( @xmath8 ) between the johnson @xmath9 light curve and radial velocity may come to the rescue @xcite .",
    "the phase lag method is a reliable tool to establish cepheid pulsation mode in this pulsation period regime .",
    "we used the simultaneous new rv data ( table[tabspec ] ) and johnson @xmath9 photometry ( fig.[bvri_v1154 ] and table[onl1 ] ) and derived @xmath10 which places our cepheid firmly among fundamental mode cepheids as is clearly seen in fig.[phaselag ] .",
    "we described the pre - launch selection of cepheid candidates within the _ kepler _ fov . of our forty candidates",
    "only five remained after inspection of the _ kepler _ light curves .",
    "aided by additional ground - based multicolour and spectroscopic observations we excluded further four stars including v2279cyg ( kic8022670 ) , which is most likely a rapidly rotating k dwarf with flares showing prominent emission lines .",
    "our results show that its previous classification as a cepheid is not correct .",
    "this leaves only one star , v1154cyg kic7548061 ) , which is a well - known cepheid .",
    "_ kepler _ has provided one of the most accurate cepheid light curves to date .",
    "high - order harmonics of the main pulsational mode were detected for the first time up to the @xmath11 harmonic .",
    "reliable investigation of cycle - to - cycle variations in the light curve is currently hampered by instrumental effects , but will be investigated as pixel - level data or finally corrected data are available for v1154cyg .",
    "period variation is investigated in a separate paper ( derekas et al .",
    "2011 , in prep ) .",
    "new , high - precision radial velocity measurements of v1154cyg do not confirm spectroscopic binarity hypothesized by @xcite .",
    "measuring the phase lag between simultaneous photometric and radial velocity data of the pulsation allowed us to determine unambiguously that v1154cyg is a fundamental mode pulsator .",
    "an intriguing feature of classical cepheids is the possible presence of nonradial pulsation modes in the case of a number of first - overtone cepheids in the large magellanic cloud @xcite . indeed ,",
    "theoretical computations by @xcite predict the presence of high - order nonradial mode close to and beyond the blue edge of the cepheid instability strip .",
    "although v1154cyg pulsates in the fundamental mode , we have searched for , but have not found any short period variability ( nonradial or stochastically excited modes ) .",
    "new kinds of investigations will become possible with upcoming years - long _ kepler _ data when all instrumental effects are understood .",
    "these include analyses of the light curve variation from cycle to cycle , and the detection of low - mass companions through the light - time effect .",
    "funding for thr _ kepler mission _ is provided by nasa s science mission directorate .",
