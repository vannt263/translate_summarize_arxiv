    "in the recent years , the @xmath3-minimal ( or @xmath4-minimal ) surfaces have been studied extensively in the framework of geometric measure theory ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) and from the viewpoint of partial differential equations and that of differential geometry ( e.g. , chmy04 , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "motivated by the isoperimetric problem in the heisenberg group , one also studied nonzero constant @xmath3-mean curvature surfaces and the regularity problem ( e.g. , pan82 , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , the notion of @xmath3-mean curvature ( `` @xmath3- '' stands for `` pseudohermitian '' ) can be defined for ( hyper)surfaces in a pseudohermitian manifold .",
    "the heisenberg group as a ( flat ) pseudohermitian manifold is the simplest model example , and represents a blow - up limit of general pseudohermitian manifolds .",
    "the equation of prescribed @xmath3-mean curvature in the @xmath1-dimensional heisenberg group @xmath2 is one of few known equations having geometric significance in @xmath5 for the plateau or dirichlet problem with smooth boundary value , we have reasons to believe that the minimizer is at least @xmath0 ( but not @xmath6 in general@xmath7 in @xcite three of the authors studied the regularity of the nonsingular portion of a @xmath0 smooth surface in @xmath2 .",
    "in this paper we study the local structure of the singular set of such a surface through an ordinary differential equation along the characteristic curves .",
    "results on the local structure of the singular set will be used in studying the global structure of the singular set later . note that the local structure of the singular set for @xmath6 smooth surfaces has been classified .",
    "namely , on a @xmath6 smooth surface , a singular point is either isolated or passed through by a @xmath0 smooth singular curve in a neighborhood under a mild condition on the @xmath3-mean curvature ( see theorem 3.3 in @xcite and remarks for the general case in section 7 there ) . on the other hand , the structure of the singular set of a @xmath0 smooth surface can be complicated as we will see in this paper .",
    "the understanding of the singular set of a @xmath0 smooth surface would help to solve the isoperimetric problem for @xmath0 smooth domains in @xmath2 ( see @xcite for more details on the isoperimetric problem ) .",
    "let @xmath8 be a domain of @xmath9 ( by a domain we mean an open and connected set ) and let @xmath10 be a weak solution to @xmath11where @xmath12 ( @xmath13 resp . ) is an @xmath14 vector field ( function , resp . ) in @xmath15 that is , for any @xmath16 there holds@xmath17    in which @xmath18 denotes the singular set of @xmath19 , consisting of the points ( called singular points ) where @xmath20 @xmath21 @xmath22 ( see ( 1.2 ) and ( 1.3 ) in @xcite ) .",
    "a point @xmath3 @xmath23 @xmath8 is called nonsingular if @xmath20 @xmath24 @xmath22 at @xmath25 we call @xmath26 nonsingular if all the points of @xmath8 are nonsingular .    note that a @xmath6 smooth solution ( i.e. satisfying ( [ 1.1 ] ) at nonsingular points ) may or may not be a @xmath0 weak solution .",
    "the reason is that ( [ 1.1 ] ) implies some equal - angle condition along @xmath18 if @xmath18 is a @xmath0 smooth curve , which a @xmath6 smooth solution may not satisfy ( see example 7.3 in @xcite ) . from the variational point of view , that @xmath19 satisfies the condition ( [ 1.1 ] ) is more natural than that @xmath19 satisfies ( [ 1.1 ] ) pointwise at nonsingular points .",
    "therefore we study the solutions satisfying ( [ 1.1 ] ) .",
    "let @xmath27 denote the planar vector @xmath28 at a nonsingular point@xmath29 since @xmath27 is of unit length , we can write @xmath30locally for some angular function @xmath31 ( @xmath23 @xmath32 if we assume @xmath12 @xmath23 @xmath33 let @xmath34 @xmath35 @xmath36 ( @xmath23 @xmath37 a priori ) and let @xmath38 @xmath35 @xmath39 @xmath40 suppose further that @xmath12 @xmath23 @xmath0 and @xmath41 exists and is continuous . in @xcite ( see theorem d therein )",
    ", we proved that @xmath31 is in fact @xmath0 and @xmath42 exists and is continuous . in this paper",
    "we will show that @xmath43 exists and is continuous .",
    "moreover , @xmath34 satisfies an ordinary differential equation of second order along any characteristic curve ( i.e. , integral curve of @xmath44 ( see theorem a below ) . for @xmath12 @xmath45 @xmath46 @xmath47 @xmath23 @xmath48",
    "we define@xmath49    ( note that in @xcite we used @xmath50 instead of @xmath51 denote @xmath42 and @xmath43 by @xmath52 and @xmath53 respectively .    * * theorem a**@xmath54 _ let _",
