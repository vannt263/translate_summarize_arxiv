    "one of the first expectations of neutron - star ( ns ) astrophysics , dating back to the epoch when such sources where theoretically proposed , is the possibility to detect thermal radiation from their hot ( millions of k ) surfaces @xcite .",
    "observation of the first sources of cosmic x - rays in the early sixties suggested that nss could indeed be detected , which added impetus to theoretical work as well as to modeling of expected ns observational properties .",
    "the crucial point , attracting a lot of interest in the astrophysical community , was that the study of ns cooling could constrain the physical properties of superdense matter in the interiors of the nss @xcite , under conditions that can not be studied in terrestrial laboratories .",
    "discovery of nss as radio pulsars @xcite further boosted ns cooling studies as well as observational efforts .",
    "however , the first detection of thermal radiation from the surface of inss @xcite had to wait the launch of focusing x - ray telescopes heao2/_einstein _ ( 19781981 ) and _ exosat _ ( 19831986 ) , which allowed for a dramatic leap forward in sensitivity to faint point x - ray sources .    our understanding of the physics of nss dramatically improved in the last decades . thanks to multiwavelength observations ( with an important role played by x - ray observations ) , we have discovered with much surprise that not all isolated nss ( inss ) behave as radio pulsars , but that there exist a rich diversity of ins classes , including rotation - powered pulsars , rotating radio transients , anomalous x - ray pulsars , soft gamma repeaters , central compact objects in supernova remnants , and the magnificent seven thermally emitting nss ( see the next section ) .",
    "it is now commonly accepted that magnetic fields plays an important role in shaping the electromagnetic emission properties of inss , e.g. mediating the conversion of their rotational energy into radiation ( as in rotation - powered sources ) , or directly acting as the energy reservoir for most of the ins luminosity ( as in magnetars ) .",
    "one of the main challenges is to disentangle different emission components , overlapping in the x - ray energy range . after discriminating thermal emission ,",
    "a detailed study of the thermal spectra can yield precious information about the ns surface temperature distribution , the properties of dense magnetized plasmas in their envelopes and atmospheres , as well as set constraints on the equation of state of the ultradense matter in the ns cores .    besides inss",
    ", some nss with observed thermal spectra also reside in binary systems . in low - mass x - ray binary systems ( lmxbs )",
    ", a ns accretes matter from a less massive star ( a main sequence star or a white dwarf ) , alternating periods of intense accretion and periods of quiescence .",
    "when accretion stops and the residual heat diffuses out from the crust , x - ray radiation comes from the heated ns surface @xcite . during the last decade , such quiescent sources ( qlmxbs ) yield ever increasing amount of valuable information on the nss .",
    "their spectra are successfully interpreted with models of ns atmospheres ( see * ? ? ? * for a discussion and references ) .",
    "another class of nss in binaries with thermal spectra are x - ray bursters  accreting nss in close binary systems , which produce x - ray bursts with intervals from hours to days ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) . during intervals between the bursts , a burster s atmosphere does not essentially differ from an atmosphere of a cooling ns . in such periods",
    ", the bulk of the observed x - ray radiation arises from transformation of gravitational energy of the accreting matter into thermal energy .",
    "some of the bursts ( so - called long bursts , which last over a minute ) occur during periods when the accretion rate is low enough for the luminosity not to exceed a few percent of the eddington limit . in this cases ,",
    "a thermal atmospheric spectrum can be observed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    as we will see , the number of known nss with an unambiguously identified thermal component in the spectrum is not large , but it steadily increases . some of them can be understood with models of nonmagnetic atmospheres , whereas others are believed to be endowed with strong magnetic fields , which must be taken into account .",
    "after the seminal work of @xcite , the nonmagnetic neutron - star atmospheres have been studied in many works ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "databases of neutron - star hydrogen atmosphere model spectra have been published @xcite , and a computer code for their calculation has been released @xcite .",
    "a database of carbon atmosphere model spectra has been also published recently @xcite .",
    "model spectra were calculated for neutron - star atmospheres composed of different chemical elements from h to fe ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and mixtures of different elements @xcite .",
    "in general , the thermal spectra of nss in binaries ( e.g. , bursters and qlmxbs mentioned above ) are interpreted with theoretical models without magnetic fields .",
    "thermal components of spectra of several millisecond pulsars ( e.g. , psr j0437@xmath04715 , @xcite and some thermally emitting inss ( e.g. , the source in cassiopeia a , @xcite ) have also been interpreted with the nonmagnetic atmosphere models . in this paper , however , we will not consider the nonmagnetic models ( see @xcite for a more general review , which includes a discussion of both the nonmagnetic and magnetic cases ) , but instead we will focus on models of thermal spectra of the inss that are significantly affected by strong magnetic fields .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "[ sect : insfamilies ] we give account of the different classes of inss . in sect .  [ sec : objects ] we list inss with confirmed thermal emission and give a summary of their main characteristics . in sect .",

    "[ sec : concl ] , we give brief conclusions . in the appendix",
    "we briefly describe the effects of thermal motion of atoms in a strong magnetic field on the atomic quantum - mechanical characteristics and on the ionization equilibrium of plasmas , that underlie calculations of the opacities for the strongly magnetized ns atmospheres .",
    "a short account of the main properties of the different classes of inss , with a focus on their emission in the x - ray range , is useful to set the context for the observational panorama of thermal emitters .",
    "@xmath1 = 0ex    * rotation - powered pulsars ( rpps)*. this is the class of inss with the largest observational database , more than 2,200 sources being known , mostly from radio surveys . a large population of radio - silent rpps is also emerging , thanks to gamma - ray observations by the fermi mission ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .    rotation of a magnetized ins induces electric fields which accelerate particles in the magnetosphere surrounding the star , initiating electromagnetic cascades .",
    "this mechanism produces synchrotron and curvature radiation along a peculiar beaming pattern , ultimately related to the magnetic field configuration , at the expense of the dissipation of the ns rotational energy ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) . because of such rotation - powered emission ( see also @xcite , this volume ) , rpps",
    "are typically observed as pulsating sources from radio wavelengths to very high energy gamma - rays  the spin - down luminosity @xmath2 ( where @xmath3 g @xmath4 is the ns moment of inertia ) being indeed much larger than the inferred electromagnetic luminosities .",
    "however , as a matter of fact , most of the spin - down luminosity is carried away by a relativistic particle wind which , interacting with the surrounding medium , powers bright pulsar wind nebulae , seen as diffuse structures in the radio , x - ray , and gamma - ray energy ranges .    in this picture , assuming the observed @xmath5 to be due to magnetic dipole radiation yields an estimate of the surface dipole field at the magnetic equator of the star @xmath6 g , as well as an estimate of the ns age @xmath7 , which is called characteristic age .",
    "the first estimate assumes @xmath8 , where @xmath9 g @xmath4 , @xmath10 is the stellar radius @xmath11 in units of @xmath12 cm , and @xmath13 is the angle between the magnetic and rotational axes .",
    "more realistic calculations give similar relations between @xmath14 and @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "the second estimate assumes a birth period much shorter than the current period @xmath16 , as well as a non - variable magnetic field .",
    "as can be seen in figure  [ fig : ppdot ] , the bulk of rpps have @xmath16 in the 0.11 s range and @xmath17 g. the separate subclass of millisecond pulsars ( msps ) , accounting for @xmath18 of the rpp sample , is supposed to include very old nss with a different evolutionary history , having experienced accretion in a long - lived binary system which eventually spun - up the nss to @xmath19 a few ms and quenched their magnetic field to @xmath20 g. for this reason msps are also called recycled pulsars ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "more than 120 rpps have been detected in the soft x - ray energy range ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and several of them display thermal emission from their hot surfaces in addition to the rotation - powered emission . while a thermal component related to the ns cooling is apparent in a few sources , an additional component with a higher temperature and a smaller emitting area can also be observed @xcite , probably related to re - heating of the magnetic polar caps by bombardment of magnetospheric particles .",
    "we note that rpps with the largest inferred magnetic fields ( @xmath21 g ) are often considered as a separate , `` high-@xmath14 '' class , ( hb , see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "hb rpps show some evidence for a larger thermal luminosity when compared to rpps of similar ages and can be the link between magnetars and rpps , with magnetic field decay playing an important role for their thermal evolution @xcite",
    ". at least in one case ( psr  j1846@xmath00258 , @xcite ) , a peculiar time variability , reminiscent of the behaviour of the anomalous x - ray pulsars ( see below ) , has been seen in a hb rpp .    * rotating radio transients ( rrats)*. discovered as sources of repeated , bright , short ( @xmath22 ms ) radio bursts occurring at integral multiples of an underlying periodicity , rrats were initially considered as a new class of inss @xcite .",
    "high time resolution radio surveys are unveiling new rrats ( about 70 are currently known  see @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "it has been observed that rrats , as a class , have a larger magnetic field with respect to the bulk of rpps , which prompted speculations about possible relationships of such sources with magnetars ( or with hb rpps , or with the magnificent seven nss considered below ) .",
    "interestingly enough , the most active rrat ( psr  j1819@xmath01458 )  the only source of its class being detected in soft x - rays  has an x - ray phenomenology ( as well as a position in the @xmath23 plane ) fully similar to the one of the magnificent seven , with a pulsed thermal - like emission and a broad spectral absorption feature superimposed to the continuum @xcite . in any case",
    ", it is currently believed that rrats are not substantially physically different from rpps  which also show time variability of the radio pulses  rrats have just a somewhat extreme temporal behaviour .    * soft gamma repeaters ( sgrs ) * and * anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps)*. about two dozen such sources",

    "the period of sgr / axps ( in the 212 s range ) is much longer than the one of the bulk of rpps ; their period derivative ( showing peculiar time variability ) is also very large , corresponding to dipole magnetic fields of the order of @xmath24 g ( see figure  [ fig : ppdot ] ) .",
    "these objects show a very complex high energy phenomenology .",
    "this includes a persistent , pulsed soft x - ray component ( often with a transient behavior ) , dominated by thermal - like emission , typically with a luminosity largely exceeding the spin - down luminosity .",

    "g @xcite or rapidly rotating massive ( @xmath25 ) white dwarfs with @xmath26  g @xcite . ] the magnetic field of magnetars is supposed to be much more intense than for other classes of inss and to have a peculiar topology .    * central compact objects ( ccos)*.",
    "this class includes a dozen of point sources , lying close to the center of young ( 0.310 kyr ) supernova remnants , discovered in the soft x - ray band and supposed to be young inss @xcite .",

    "this is consistent with an interpretation of the absorption lines as electron cyclotron features . in this picture , it is not clear what is the origin of the apparent , relatively large thermal luminosities and large temperature anisotropies for these nss .",
    "the spin - down luminosity is too low to explain the hot spot emission , while x - ray timing , as well as deep optical / infrared observations , rule out the existence of companion stars as well as accretion from debris discs @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that a strong crustal toroidal magnetic field could channel heat from the star interior , producing hot spots on the surfaces , while not influencing the ns spin - down ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the cooling theory of nss and several issues characteristic of magnetars are also discussed in other chapters of this volume . in this chapter ,",

    "the luminosity is always subject to the uncertainty in the distance measurement , while the inferred effective temperature depends on the choice of the emission model ( blackbody vs. atmosphere models , composition , condensed surface , etc . ) , and it carries large theoretical uncertainties in the case of strong magnetic fields .",
    "we often find that more than one model can fit equally well the data , without any clear , physically motivated preference for one of them .",
    "photoelectric absorption from interstellar medium further constitutes a source of error in temperature measurements , since the value of the hydrogen column density @xmath37 is correlated to the temperature value obtained in spectral fits .",
    "different choices for the absorption model and the metal abundances can also yield different results for the temperature . in addition , in the very common case of the presence of inhomogeneous surface temperature distributions , only an approximation with two or three regions at different temperatures is usually employed . moreover , in the case of data with few photons and/or strong absorption features , the temperature is poorly constrained by the fit , adding a large statistical error to the systematic one .",
