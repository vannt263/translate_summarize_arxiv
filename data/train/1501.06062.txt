    "<S> we explain the probe field transmission spectrum under the influence of a strong pump field in a hybrid optomechanical system , composed of an optical cavity , a mechanical resonator , and a two - level atom . </S>",
    "<S> we show fast ( superluminal ) and slow ( subluminal ) light effects of the transmitted probe field in the hybrid system for suitable parametric regimes . for the experimental accessible domain </S>",
    "<S> , we find that the fast light effect obtained for the single optomechanical coupling can further be enhanced with the additional atom - field coupling in the hybrid system . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we report the existence of a tunable switch from fast to slow light by adjusting the atomic detuning with the anti - stokes and stokes sidebands , respectively , as @xmath0 and @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the reported characteristics are realizable in state - of - the - art laboratory experiments . </S>"
