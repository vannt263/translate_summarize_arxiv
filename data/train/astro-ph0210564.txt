    "the majority of the known stellar mass black hole candidates ( bhcs ) are transient low - mass x - ray binaries .",
    "these systems remain in quiescence for periods of months to tens of years and occasionally show outbursts ( x - ray novae ) which are the result of a sudden increase in the mass accretion rate that generally lasts for a few months . during an outburst various spectral and variability properties",
    "are observed which seem to a great extent , but not uniquely , to be determined by the mass accretion rate ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "although the appearance of black hole x - ray binaries is often categorized into 4 to 5 canonical states , they in fact appear to go through a continuous range of states whose properties are determined by the interplay between the two dominating spectral components : a soft thermal disk component and a hard non - thermal power law component attributed to a comptonizing medium @xcite whose origin remains unclear but is often thought to be an outflow and/or corona surrounding the inner accretion disk .",
    "the variability properties of bhcs are strongly related to the relative contribution of the disk and the non - thermal components .",
    "when the latter dominates ( hard state ) , the power spectra of bhcs show a strong band limited noise component on which often are superposed one or more quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) .",
    "when the contribution of the non - thermal component to the spectrum decreases ( intermediate state ) , the noise becomes weaker and the qpos become more prominent , while their frequencies increase from typically 0.1 to 10 hz . when the thermal component dominates the spectrum ( soft state ) variability is very weak .",
    "in addition to low frequency qpos ( lf qpos ; @xmath00.110 hz ) five bhc systems have also shown high frequency qpos ( hf qpos ) with frequencies of 40 hz and higher ( for a recent overview see * ? ? ?",
    "they are mainly observed when neither the thermal nor the non - thermal component dominates the spectrum . unlike the khz qpos that are observed in the neutron star low - mass x - ray binaries @xcite and whose frequencies are variable and correlated to those of qpos at lower frequency , our view on hf qpos in bhcs is less complete and has evolved considerably during the past six years .",
    "currently , three of the five sources have shown pairs hf qpos , sometimes simultaneously detected : gro 165540 shows a pair at 300 and 450 hz ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , grs 1915 + 105 at 41 and 67 hz ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; see also * ? ? ? * ) and another at 164 and 328 hz ( * ? ? ?",
    "* not detected simultaneously with the other pair ) , and xte j1550564 at 184 and 272 hz @xcite .",
    "note that in the case of xte j1550564 there is also evidence for a peak at 92 hz @xcite and that single peaks at intermediate frequencies are also found @xcite .",
    "the frequencies of the 102284 hz peaks in xte j1550564 reported by @xcite seemed to correlate with the frequency of the lf qpos , although @xcite dispute this . in xte j1859 + 226",
    "@xcite and 4u 163047 @xcite only single peaks are detected that are consistent ( at a @xmath2 level ) with having a constant frequency .    although several detailed models had already been proposed to explain the frequencies of the hf qpos ( some of which will be discussed in section [ sec : disc ] ) , recently much interest has been sparked by the apparent harmonic ratios of the frequencies in the hf qpo pairs ( 3:5 and 1:2 in grs 1915 + 105 , 2:3 in gro j165040 , and 1:2:3 xte j1550564 ) , which , according to @xcite , might be suggestive of resonances between orbital and epicyclic motion in the kerr metric . in any case , the frequencies of the hf qpos strongly suggest that they find their origin in the inner parts of the accretion flow , close to the innermost stable orbit ( isco ) .",
    "when eventually the mechanism behind these oscillations is understood , their properties can be used to study the effects of general relativity and constrain the mass and spin of the black hole .",
    "already now such constraints can be made ; for example , assuming that the highest observed frequencies are caused by keplerian motion at the isco , for at least two of the above sources , gro j165540 and xte j1550564 , the derived values of the masses of the black holes ( 5.57.9 @xmath1 and 9.711.6 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the highest observed frequencies imply that the black holes _ must _ be spinning .",
    "the models proposed thus far to explain the frequencies of the hf qpos have all in common that their interpretation of the highest observed frequency requires even larger spin values than the ones based on the above simple assumption .    in this paper",
    "we report our search for high frequency qpos in the x - ray transient xte j1650500 .",
    "this source was first detected with the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) on september 5 2001 @xcite .",
    "follow up observations @xcite revealed a hard x - ray spectrum , strong variability and qpos around a few hz , marking the source as a black hole candidate .",
    "optical and radio counterparts were identified by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "optical follow - up observations performed when the source was close to quiescence , in october 2002 , revealed an orbital period of 0.212 days and a mass function which requires an inclination @xmath3 for the black hole mass to be larger than 3 @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "xmm - newton observations performed near the peak of the outburst revealed the presence of a broad , skewed fe k@xmath4 emission line that suggests the compact object in this system may be a kerr black hole @xcite .",
    "@xcite studied the variability properties during a @xmath020 day interval centered around a transition from the soft to the hard state that occurred on 2001 november 18 . in the power spectra they found lf qpos between 4 and 9 hz , but also broad bumps around 25 and 80 hz .",
    "no hf qpos were found , however . during the later stages of the outburst",
    "a 14-day period was found in the asm light curves , which is probably the disk precession period @xcite . in this paper",
    "we report the detection of high frequency variability in this source and in particular the detection of a 250 hz qpo . a more detailed spectral and variability study of the outburst",
    "will be presented elsewhere .",
    "the data used in this paper were taken with the proportional counter array ( pca , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) onboard rxte @xcite .",
    "the observations of xte j1650500 were performed between 2001 september 6 and 2001 november 22 .",
    "a total of 85 pointed observations were made , amounting to @xmath0185 ks .",
    "the data used in our analysis were in the following modes : standard 2 , which has a time resolution of 16 s and covers the 260 kev pca effective energy range with 129 energy channels , and e_125us_64m_0_1s / e_64us_64m_0_1s ( event modes ) , which provide a time resolution of @xmath5 s or @xmath6 s in 64 energy channels covering the same energy range as the standard 2 mode .",
    "the standard 2 data were used to create a light curve , a hardness - intensity diagram ( hid ) and a color - color diagram ( cd ) .",
    "only data from proportional counter units ( pcus ) 0 and 2 were used since these were the only two ( of the five ) that were always operational during our observations .",
    "the observations were background subtracted , but no dead time corrections were applied ( @xmath73.6% ) .",
    "two colors were defined ; a soft color , which is the ratio of counts in the 5.810.0 kev and 2.55.8 kev bands ( standard 2 [ i.e.  0128 ] channels 1019 and 29 ) , and a hard color , which is the ratio of counts in the 13.818.4 kev and 2.55.8 kev bands ( channels 2939 and 29 ) .",
    "the intensity used for the hid was the count rate in the 2.520.5 kev band ( channels 244 ) .",
    "fast fourier transforms ( ffts ) of the event mode data ( from all the active pcus ) were performed to create power spectra with a frequency range of 0.06254096 hz in the 7.522.2 kev band ( ` absolute ' [ i.e.0254 ] channels 15 - 49 ) .",
    "this energy range was chosen since high frequency variability in black hole lmxbs is in general most significantly detected in a similar energy range - an additional advantage of this energy range is that it does not introduce the instrumental broad high frequency features found by klein - wolt , homan & van der klis ( in prep . ) in the lowest energy channels .",
    "the data were not background subtracted and no dead time corrections were applied prior to the fft ; the effects of dead time were accounted for by our power spectral fit function ( see below ) .",
    "power spectra were averaged based on time , colors or count rate , and normalized according to the recipe described in @xcite .",
    "prior to fitting the power spectra the dead time modified poisson level was subtracted using the method of klein - wolt , homan & van der klis ( in prep . ) , which uses the analytical function from @xcite and @xcite as a basis .",
    "they found that this function often fails to describe the high frequency part of the power spectrum where no contribution from the source is expected and , instead of improving the fit at high frequencies by varying the parameters of this function ( which leads to unacceptable values for e.g. the instrumental dead time and vle window ) , the zhang function is scaled to provide the best fit to the power spectrum in the 10004000 hz range .    following a current trend initiated by @xcite @xcite we fit the resulting power spectra with a sum of lorentzians ,",

    "the fractional rms amplitudes quoted in this paper are the integrated power between 0 and @xmath13 .",
    "errors on fit parameters were determined using @xmath18 .",
    "upper limits on the strength of the lorentzians were determined by fixing the q and/or @xmath15 , but not the rms amplitude , to values similar to those obtained in another power spectrum and using @xmath19 ( 95% confidence ) .",

    "figure [ fig : lc - hid ] shows the 2.520.5 kev light curve and hid of the outburst of xte j1650500 .",
    "the first few observations were done during the final stages of the rise , when the source was very hard . after reaching a peak on september 10 ( day 3 ) a more or less exponential decline followed , lasting for @xmath08 days , during which the spectral hardness changed considerably .",
    "the period between september 25 ( day 18 ) and october 7 ( day 30 ) , which clearly shows up as a dent in the light curve , marks a transition from the hard to the soft state - during this period the day to day variations in count rate and hardness were more erratic than before and after , while both show an overall decrease .",
    "after this transition the changes were smoother , and around october 17 ( day 40 ) the count rate started to decline exponentially again .",
    "a minimum in the hardness was reached around november 1 ( day 55 ) .",
    "after november 16 ( day 70 ) the source showed a remarkable hardening accompanied by a strong increase in count rate .",
    "part of the decline ( @xmath020 days centered on our last observation ) is discussed in @xcite .",
    "our initial search for high frequency variability was conducted by selecting a few groups of power spectra based on their position in the hid with the aim to get an idea of how the variability changed along the track in the hid and also to increase the sensitivity to high frequency features .",
    "six selections were made whose location in the light curve and hid is indicated by roman numerals i  vi . the horizontal branch ( hereafter hard branch ) made up by groups i and ii was split in two parts since",
    "power spectral properties are known to correlate well with spectral hardness and we wanted to avoid too much smearing of frequencies .",
    "group iii represents the transitional zone discussed above , which stands out clearly in both the light curve and hid .",
    "group iv encompasses all the observations in the vertical soft branch and groups v and vi represent the last two observations .",
    "we note that , apart from the one between groups i and ii , all the group boundaries in the hid coincide with considerable changes in the shape of the low frequency part of the power spectrum .",
    "figure [ fig : pds ] shows the power spectra of groups i  iii and vi in a @xmath14 representation - the power spectra of groups iv and v are not shown since at high frequencies they were dominated by statistical errors .",
    "a summary of the fit parameters can be found in table [ tab : fit ] .",
    "the first three selections all show power at high frequencies , with the most eye - catching feature being the narrow qpo in selection iii .",
    "the lorentzian fit to this peak gives a @xmath15of 250@xmath205 hz , a q - value of 5.0@xmath201.2 , and an rms amplitude of 5.0@xmath21% ( 6.0@xmath22 detection ) , making xte j1650500 the sixth black hole candidate to show such coherent high frequency variations . in selections",
    "i , ii , vi high frequency variability is found at lower frequencies ( @xmath15=53139 hz ) with a lower coherence ( q=0.251.4 ) , whereas only upper limits could be determined in selections iv and v. note that for the power spectrum of selection ii , two lorentzians were needed to fit the high frequency part , one with properties similar to that of selection i , and one that was much narrower and at a considerably higher frequency .",
    "the properties of the @xmath050 hz and 250 hz features do not change significantly when using the non - scaled zhang function for the subtraction of the poisson level .",
    "the thick solid line shows the best fit to the data .",
    "the number of lorentzians used for each group was : 6 ( i ) , 8 ( ii ) , 6 ( iii ) , and 4 ( vi ) .",
    "the individual components are shown as dotted lines ( noise component ) , dashed lines ( low frequency qpos ) , and thin solid lines ( high frequency qpos ) . in all cases the poisson level was subtracted . note that for display purposes additional rebinning was applied to the high frequency parts of the power spectra in order to reduce the statistical errors.[fig : pds],height=680 ]    to determine whether the frequency of the high frequency variability changed within our selections , we made additional selections on hard and/or soft color . dividing group iii in two parts , based on position in the cd (",
    "not shown ) , we found qpos with frequencies of 245@xmath205 hz ( q@xmath04.9 ) and 270@xmath2010 hz ( q@xmath05.3 ) , for the spectrally hard and soft part , respectively .",
    "this frequency difference has a significance of 2.2@xmath22 . dividing the hard branch , consisting of groups i and ii , in four parts",
    ", reveals that the broad feature around 50 hz has a frequency consistent ( @xmath23 ) with being constant .",
    "the @xmath0140 hz feature in group ii seems to move from 109@xmath209 hz , in the hard part of that group , to 168@xmath2015 hz in the soft part .",
    "both these peaks are significantly detected ( @xmath24 ) , have @xmath25 , and have frequencies that are more than @xmath2 apart .",
    "although this might suggest a continuous change in frequency from the hard part of group ii to the soft part of group iii , we note that the four frequencies detected in the subselections of groups ii and iii are consistent ( within @xmath2 ) with frequencies that are 1/3 , 1/2 and 1 times the frequency of the qpo detected in group iii , i.e. 250 hz . unfortunately , dividing our data into smaller selections , to test the presence of intermediate frequencies did not result in significant detections .",
    "the 250 hz qpo is only significantly ( @xmath24 ) detected in a few of the 33 observations of group iii .",
    "combining those individual observations leads to a detection with a significance that is lower than that of the detection in the whole group , suggesting the qpo is also present in ( some of ) the other observations .    the strength of the 250 hz qpo seems to increase with energy",
    "; rms amplitudes of @xmath70.85% , 4.5% , and @xmath712.1% were found in , respectively , the 26.2 kev , 6.215.0 kev , and 15.060 kev bands .",
    "the low frequency part of the power spectra also shows considerable changes between the different groups . except for the first observations , all power spectra of groups i and ii show low frequency qpos , whose frequency smoothly increases with hardness from @xmath01 hz to @xmath08 hz",
    "the low frequency part of group iii generally show a qpo around 6 and/or 9 hz , although in a few observations no qpo is detected at all . in groups",
    "iv and v no low frequency qpos are detected - they reappear in group vi with a frequency of @xmath05.5 hz . in general the frequencies and q values of the lorentzians increase when the spectrum softens and decrease when the spectrum hardens , although there is clearly no one - on - one relation between hard color and frequencies ( see figures [ fig : lc - hid]a and [ fig : pds ] ) .",
    "although there is a trend for both the high and low frequency qpos to increase with hardness , the low number of simultaneous detections does not allow us to tell whether they show a tight correlation .",
    "our detection of a 250 hz qpo makes xte j1650500 the sixth bhc to show such high frequency variations .",
    "the properties like q and rms amplitude fall in the range observed for other sources . as was already mentioned in section [ sec : intro ] , hf qpos in black hole systems are predominantly observed when neither the non - thermal nor the thermal component completely dominates the energy spectrum - they have yet to be detected in the soft or hard state .",
    "xte j1650500 seems to be no exception to this ; a preliminary analysis of the energy spectra shows that the 250 hz qpo was detected when the contribution of the thermal component in the 2200 kev range varied between @xmath050% and @xmath070% ( @xmath01070% when including the marginal detections at @xmath0110 and @xmath0170 hz ) .",
    "interestingly , this group of observations also bridges the gap between two major branches in our hid , a hard branch ( groups i and ii ) and a soft branch ( group iv ) .",
    "the erratic changes in count rate and hardness in this transitional zone , as opposed to the smooth changes in the soft and hard branches , indicate that part of the accretion flow had become unstable .",
    "although it is not clear from our analysis what part of the accretion flow this would be , our results suggest that the hf qpos in xte j1650500 are enhanced when these instabilities in the accretion flow ( with a time scale of apparently hours to days ) occur .",
    "in addition to the 250 hz qpo we have also found a broad feature around 50 hz . this feature is present in the hard branch where its frequency was consistent with being constant . at the moment",
    "that the 250 hz qpo was detected this 50 hz disappeared , suggesting that at least to some extent the mechanisms behind them are connected . although the above might suggest that the broad 50 hz peak had evolved into the qpo at 250 hz , the two subselections of group ii suggest otherwise ; they show peaks at @xmath0110 and @xmath0170 , which are present simultaneously with the 50 hz peak .",
    "the constant frequency of this broad peak is remarkable though , especially since the lf qpos ( and possibly also the hf qpos , see below ) show clear changes in their frequency .",
    "four of the eight power spectra of xte j1650500 shown in figure 2 of @xcite also show broad peaks , three around 80 hz and one around 25 hz , and broad peaks at similar frequencies are also found in gx 3394 and cyg x-1 @xcite .",
    "it is not clear whether these broad peaks are the same as the 50 hz peaks we found .",
    "the frequency behavior of the 250 hz qpo itself is not clear either .",
    "there are indications that the frequency increased from @xmath0110 hz to @xmath0270 hz with decreasing spectral hardness , but the four independent frequencies that were measured ( @xmath0110 hz , @xmath0170 hz , @xmath0245 hz , and @xmath0270 hz ) are also consistent with being 1:2:3 harmonics of each other . in a sense",
    "this behavior is similar to what was found in xte j1550564 ; also in that source the frequency of the hf qpo seemed to increase with decreasing spectral hardness @xcite , while it was found later by @xcite that , when combining power spectra according to the type of lf qpo , the majority of the detected hf qpos appeared to have frequencies that were consistent with being 1:2:3 harmonics of each other ( with the relative strength of the harmonics being related to spectra hardness ) .",
    "however , in xte j1550564 hf qpos were also found at frequencies that did not obey this harmonic relation .",
    "we also note that in the case of xte j1650500 the relation between hf qpos and the type of lf qpo is not as strong as in xte j1550564 , since the power spectra of group iii showed considerable changes in the coherence and relative strength of the various low frequency components , while the frequency and harmonic content of the hf qpo did not change significantly .",
    "most models proposed to explain hf qpos in black holes @xcite have in common that the oscillations are produced in the accretion disc . some of them predict stable frequencies @xcite , whereas others interpret them as the black hole counterparts of the khz qpos in neutron star sources , and try to predict and explain their frequencies with respect to those of the lf qpos .",
    "unfortunately , the limited number of detections of hf qpos in this source does not allow us the make strong statements about any of the models .",
    "stable frequencies are still possible , if one interprets the different frequencies as harmonics of each other as suggested by @xcite for the pairs of peaks in grs 1915 + 105 and gro j165540 . on the other hand , the different frequencies might also reflect real changes in the frequency .",
    "as noted by other authors it might well be possible that more than one of the above mechanism are at work at once .",
    "the broad and possibly stable feature around 50 hz has not been specifically addressed by the current models .    if we simply interpret the maximum observed frequency of 270 hz qpo as being due to keplerian motion at the isco of a schwarzschild black hole , we derive a mass of 8.2 @xmath1 . for a black hole with a lower mass no spin is required ( and the radius of the keplerian orbit has to be larger than that of the isco ) , whereas for more massive black holes it is . since the properties of the broad , skewed fe k@xmath26 line detected with xmm - newton @xcite suggest that the black hole has a near maximum angular momentum",
    ", the mass of the black hole might well be much larger than 8.2 @xmath1 . assuming a mass ratio for the companion star and the black hole of 0.1 , the derived mass function for the system @xcite",
    "would then imply an inclination lower than 27@xmath27 , which is considerably lower than the values derived for grs 1915 + 105 ( @xmath28 * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , gro j165540 ( @xmath28 * ?",
    "* and references therein ) , and xte j1550564 ( @xmath29 * ? ? ?",
    "if we assume that the non - modulated x - ray emission is isotropic , this suggests that the mechanism responsible for the hf qpos in black hole x - ray binaries does not produce highly beamed modulated radiation .",
