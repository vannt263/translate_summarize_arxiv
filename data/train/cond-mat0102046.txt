    "since the discovery of the icosahedral phase in al - mn alloys by means of x - ray spectroscopy @xcite , the quasicrystaline systems have been extensively studied ( for a revision see @xcite ) . in particular , the physical properties of the so - called quasiperiodic structures have attracted a lot of attention from both theoretical and experimental point of view .",
    "although the term _ quasicrystal _ is more appropriate for natural compounds or artificial alloys , in one dimension there is no difference between this case and the quasiperiodic structure formed by the incommensurate arrangement of periodic unit cells . due to this motivation ,",
    "merlin and collaborators , using the molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe ) technique , grew in 1985 the first quasiperiodic superlattice following the fibonacci sequence @xcite .",
    "after that pioneer work , other quasiperiodic structures were experimentally realized @xcite .",
    "> from a theoretical point of view , a number of physical properties has been studied in quasiperiodic structures . among them",
    "we can cite the energy spectra of polaritons @xcite , phonons @xcite , electrons @xcite and spin waves @xcite , as well as the magnetoresistance and magnetization curves of quasiperiodic thin films @xcite .",
    "a quite interesting feature , common to all of these systems , is a self - similar pattern of their spectra .",
    "in fact , the energy spectra of the above referred particles and systems are highly fragmented and tend to cantor sets in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the origin of this fractality can be attributed to the long range order induced by the non - usual hierarchical structure of the quasiperiodic sequences used in the construction of the system .    a very interesting question aroused in the last few years",
    ": _ what are the consequences of a fractal energy spectra on the behavior of the thermodynamic properties of quasiperiodic systems ?",
    "_ in a recent work , tsallis and collaborators @xcite studied the specific heat properties of a fractal energy spectra generated by the _",
    "geometrical triadic cantor set_. they have found , as the main result of the paper , that the specific heat presents oscillations around the fractal dimension of the spectra .",
    "in addition , a non - uniform convergence between the so - called banded and discrete models was observed .",
    "their results were extended by vallejos _",
    "@xcite for the _ two - scale _ cantor set case . for this more general situation ,",
    "the specific heat also exhibits log - periodic oscillations around the fractal dimension .",
    "later carpena _ et al _ @xcite , using the properties of a _",
    "spectra showed under what conditions the oscillatory regime disappears .",
    "finally , curado and rego - monteiro @xcite examined the thermodynamic properties of a solid exhibiting the energy spectrum given by a logistic map .",
    "the aim of this work is to push a little bit more the understanding of the thermodynamic properties of quasicrystals , analyzing the specific heat of a _ real _ fractal spectra of spin waves in quasiperiodic fibonacci magnetic superlattices .",
    "we consider that the building blocks used here to set up the quasiperiodic structures are ferromagnetic materials , whose dynamics are described by the heisenberg hamiltonian . our main concern is to emphasize the differences between the specific heat profile obtained by using a _ real _ spin wave s _ multifractal _ energy spectra for a given in - plane wavevector , ( with , by instance , their proper scaling laws ) , as discussed in ref . 8 , and an _ idealized _ cantor set , considered in previous works . throughout the paper we use the classical maxwell - boltzmann statistics .    this paper is organized as follows : in section",
    "ii we discuss the theoretical method used to obtain the spin waves dispersion relation ( their energy spectra ) , and the rules used to build up the fibonacci superlattice .",
    "section iii is devoted to the specific heat theory of a general scaled energy band spectra .",
    "the application of this theory to the fibonacci quasiperiodic structure is then made , and the main features of the spectra obtained are discussed .",
    "finally , section iv presents the conclusions of this work .",
    "in this section we briefly describe the physical model for the quasiperiodic magnetic superlattices . a detailed description can be found in ref . @xcite .",
    "we consider superlattices in which @xmath0 layers of material @xmath1 ( building block @xmath1 ) alternate with @xmath2 layers of material @xmath3 ( building block @xmath3 ) . both materials are taken to be simple cubic spin-@xmath4 heisenberg ferromagnets having exchange constants @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively , and lattice constant @xmath7 . at the interface @xmath8 , the exchange constant is suppose to be equal to @xmath9 .",
    "the heisenberg hamiltonian for each component is :    @xmath10    here the sum in the first term is over sites @xmath11 and nearest neighbors ( @xmath12 ) @xmath13 , and @xmath14 is a static external magnetic field pointing in the @xmath15-direction .",
    "the spin wave dispersion relation in a superlattice can be found by solving the equations of motion for the operator @xmath16 , i.e :    @xmath17    where @xmath18 is the random phase approximation for the @xmath15- component of the spin operator .",
    "the solution of ( 2 ) , for material @xmath1 , is :    @xmath19 ( \\exp -i\\omega t)\\ ] ]    with similar expression for material @xmath3 .",
    "these solutions are linked together using the equation of motion ( 2 ) at the boundaries of the @xmath20-th unit cell , which can be written in a matricial form . using the translational invariance property of the excitations , through bloch s theorem",
    ", the spin wave dispersion relation follows as : @xmath21.\\ ] ] here @xmath22 is the blochwavevector of the collective mode , @xmath23 is the size of the superlattice s unit cell , and @xmath24 is a transfer matrix which relates the coefficients of the @xmath25 cell to the coefficients of the preceding one .    a fibonacci superlattice can be grown experimentally by juxtaposing the two building blocks @xmath1 and @xmath3 in such way that the @xmath26-generation of the superlattice @xmath27 is given iteratively by the rule @xmath28 , for @xmath29 , with @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "it is also invariant under the transformations @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "the fibonacci generations are , @xmath34 , \\hspace{0.1 cm } s_{1}=[a ] , \\hspace{0.1 cm } s_{2}=[ab ] , \\hspace{0.1 cm } s_{3}=[aba ] , \\hspace{0.1 cm } etc.\\ ] ] the number of building blocks increases according to the fibonacci number , @xmath35 ( with @xmath36 ) , and the ratio between the number of the building blocks @xmath1 and the number of building blocks @xmath3 , when @xmath37 , in the sequence tends to @xmath38 , an irrational number known as the golden mean .",
    "it can be shown that the transfer matrix for the @xmath26 generation of a fibonacci superlattice can be obtained by a simple recurrence relation given by @xcite , @xmath39 therefore , from the knowledge of the transfer matrices @xmath40 and @xmath41 , we can determine the transfer matrix for any generation and consequently the dispersion relation .",
    "note that the matrix @xmath42 recovers the periodic case .",
    "the spin wave fractal spectra for the fibonacci superlattices is depicted in fig .  1 , for a fixed value of the in - plane dimensionless wavevector @xmath43 .",
    "from there we can see the forbidden and allowed energies of the spin wave spectra against the fibonacci s generation number @xmath20 , up to their @xmath44 generation , which corresponds an unit cell with @xmath45 @xmath1 s and @xmath46 @xmath3 s building blocks .",
    "the number of allowed bands is equal to three times the fibonacci number @xmath47 , of the correspondent generation .",
    "notice that , as expected , for large @xmath20 the allowed band regions get narrower and narrower and they have a typical cantor set structure .",
    "we address now to the specific heat of the spectra indicated in fig .  1 .",
    "the description below is general and can be applied to any banded spectrum . in fig .  1 each spectrum , for a fixed generation number @xmath20 , has @xmath48 allowed continuous bands .",
    "we consider , without loss of generality , the level density within each band constant . the partition function for the @xmath26 generation",
    "is then given by :    @xmath49    here @xmath50 ( by choosing the boltzmann s constant @xmath51 ) , and we take the density of states @xmath52 . after a straightforward calculation",
    "we can write @xmath53 as ,    @xmath54.\\ ] ]    here the subscript @xmath20 is the generation number , @xmath48 is the number of allowed bands and @xmath55 is the difference between the top and bottom energy levels of each band .    the specific heat is then given by , @xmath56,\\ ] ] which can be written as , @xmath57 with , @xmath58.\\ ] ] and , @xmath59.\\ ] ]    therefore",
    ", once we know the energy spectra of the spin wave which propagates in a given sequence s generation of a quasiperiodic structure , we can determine the associated specific heat s spectra by using ( 10 ) .",
    "2 shows the spin wave specific heat spectra of the fibonacci superlattices , for the in - plane wavevector @xmath60 , as a function of the temperature . for the high temperature limit ( @xmath61 ) , the specific heat for all generation numbers converges and decays as @xmath62 , for arbitrary @xmath20 , in agreement with the triadic case",
    "this is a consequence of the existence of a maximum energy value in the spectrum ( once the spectrum is bounded ) .",
    "as the temperature decreases , the specific heat increases up to a maximum value .",
    "the corresponding temperature for this maximum value depends on the fibonacci generation number @xmath20 , although one can see a clear tendency for a common temperature value as @xmath20 increases .",
    "after the maximum value , the specific heat falls into the low temperature region . in this region",
    "it starts to present non - harmonic small oscillation behavior , as shown in the inset of fig .  2 . these oscillations , are _ not _ around a specific fractal dimension of the quasiperiodic structure , as in the _ idealized _ triadic cantor set ! besides , it _ can not _ be considered also an approximation of the idealized oscillations found in the triadic cantor set .",
    "their profiles define clearly two classes of oscillations , one for the _ even _ and the other for the _ odd _ generation numbers of the sequence , the amplitude of the odd oscillations being bigger than the amplitude of the even one .",
    "these behaviors are better illustrated in fig .  3 , where are depicted _ log - log _ plots of the specific heat against the temperature for several generation numbers .",
    "of course the number of oscillations observed in the specific heat spectra is related to the hierarchical generation number @xmath20 ( more oscillations appear as @xmath20 increases ) .",
    "another behavior of these oscillations can be seen in fig .  4 , where we have plotted the specific heat against @xmath63 .",
    "we can note a well defined period in the oscillations , which means that the specific heat is a _ log - periodic _ function of the temperature .",
    "the curves resemble the triadic case , with a mean value @xmath64 , around it @xmath65 oscillates log - periodically , although , as in the log - log plot , this value is not related with the fractal dimension of the fibonacci quasiperiodic structure . besides , the mean value is different for the even and odd fibonacci s generation numbers .",
    "in this paper we have studied the spin wave specific heat , for fixed values of the in - plane dimensionless wave vector @xmath43 , for the fibonacci magnetic superlattices .",
    "we have shown , as a common aspect of the model employed here , that the specific heat tends to zero in the high temperature limit ( @xmath66 ) , as @xmath62 , no matter its generation number .",
    "this asymptotic behavior is mainly due to the fact that we have considered our system bounded .",
    "it also presents a maximum whose corresponding temperature tends to a fixed value as the generation number increases .",
    "finally , in the low temperature region , a small oscillations arises as an indication that the specific heat is a _ log - periodic _ function of the temperature .",
    "these oscillations can be defined as the _ signature _ of the quasiperiodic system , and has no counterpart in the idealized case .",
    "it would be of interest to have experimental data to test our predicted theoretical results presented here .",
    "however , most of the experimental studies of magnetic multilayers to date , have been done for transition metals @xcite .",
    "further experimental studies carried out for multilayers structures of magnetic insulator or magnetic semiconductor materials , that would be better described by the heisenberg model employed in this paper , are welcome .",
    "suitable experimental technique to probe the spin wave spectra in the quasi - periodic structure discussed here is the inelastic light scattering spectroscopy of raman and brillouin type .",
    "however , the spectra can be obtained only for a given in - plane wavevector @xmath67 , which defines the incident angle @xmath68 of the light through the relation @xmath69 , @xmath70 being the the laser wavelength @xcite .",
    "this fact adds an extra complication to the experimental specific heat measurements , but we hope that the experimentalists can be encouraged to overcome it .",
    "techniques involving magnetic resonance ( for example , ferromagnetic resonance , standing spin - wave resonant etc . ) can also be used , and indeed they were previously been successfully applied to surface and bulk spin waves in various magnetic microstructures ( for a good account of these techniques see @xcite ) .      _",
