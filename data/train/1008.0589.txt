    "speckles are high - contrast fine - scale granular patterns occurring whenever radiation is scattered from a surface characterized by some roughness on the scale of the radiation wavelength .",
    "originally discovered for laser light in the early 1960s , the speckle phenomenon plays an important role not only in optics , but also in other fields , where it is used for several applications , including , for example , radar and ultrasound medical imagery @xcite .",
    "in recent years , optical speckles have been employed in combination with cold atoms @xcite and especially bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) @xcite in order to investigate the behavior of matter waves in the presence of disordered potentials @xcite .",
    "many interesting features of becs in one - dimensional ( 1d ) speckle potentials have been addressed from both the experimental and the theoretical sides .",
    "these include classical localization and fragmentation effects , frequency shifts and damping of collective excitations , and inhibition of transport properties @xcite , and have culminated with the observation of anderson localization for a bec @xcite .",
    "also , the superfluid - insulator transition @xcite and the transport of coherent matter waves have been recently investigated from the theoretical point of view for speckles in higher dimensions @xcite .    despite this intense research activity ,",
    "the properties of the single particle spectrum of the speckle potential have been addressed only partially , even in the 1d case . in @xcite",
    "it has been argued that for low energies the density of states ( dos ) of _ blue - detuned _ repulsive speckles is characterized by a lifshitz tail @xcite , whereas the presence  for higher energies  of an effective mobility edge , has been discussed in @xcite . in addition , though there is a vast literature about random 1d systems @xcite , most of the general theorems apply strictly to the case of uncorrelated disorder , whereas the speckles , being a correlated disordered potential , deserve an explicit treatment .    in this article",
    "we discuss the properties of dos for a 1d speckle potential , by comparing analytical predictions , based on the statistical properties of the speckles , with explicit calculations for the spectrum of numerically generated speckle patterns .",
    "we consider both _",
    "blue - detuned _ ( repulsive ) and _ red - detuned _ ( attractive ) cases .",
    "the speckles are characterized by their intensity @xmath0 and a correlation length @xmath1 , which represents the length scale over which the modification of the potential occurs .",
    "therefore , for dimensional reasons , the single - particle properties are determined by a single dimensionless parameter @xmath2 , with @xmath3 being the mass of the particle . in our conventions , the plus and the minus signs refer to the blue - detuned and red - detuned speckle , respectively .    in the presence of disorder ,",
    "the asymptotic behavior of the dos near the edges of the spectrum is dominated by rare large fluctuations of the potential . for the red - detuned potential , the low - energy tail of the dos originates from the deep wells at negative energies .",
    "the latter is closely related to the distribution of intensity maxima in the speckle patterns . in the case of a blue - detuned speckle the spectrum is bounded from below .",
    "the dos near the edge results from the large regions with very small intensity .",
    "for both cases we analyze the behavior of the dos throughout the @xmath4 range , from the semiclassical limit @xmath5 , down to the quantum regime @xmath6 , where smoothing effects become important .",
