    "brownian motors or ratchets are spatially periodic systems that are able to induce direct transport rectifying thermal fluctuations .",
    "two conditions are generally sufficient for the emergence of direct transport in these systems : breaking of thermal equilibrium and breaking of spatial inversion symmetry @xcite .",
    "these systems permit one to get an insight into non - equilibrium processes and are receiving increasing interest also due to their applications in nanotechnology and biology  @xcite .",
    "flashing ratchets are devices that rectify the motion of brownian particles by subjecting them to a spatially periodic potential that is alternatively switched on and off .",
    "open - loop flashing ratchets operate without regard to the state of the system ( open - loop control ) implementing a periodic or random switching to rectify thermal fluctuations by taking advantage of the asymmetry of the potential  @xcite . on the contrary , feedback ratchets ( or closed - loop ratchets ) use information on the particle distribution of the system to operate  @xcite , and the asymmetry of the feedback control protocol is able to induce a directed transport even for symmetric ratchet potentials . for instance , in the so - called maximization of the center - of - mass velocity protocol  @xcite the controller switches on the potential only if switching on would imply a positive displacement for the center - of - mass position ( i.e. , if the net force with the potential on would be positive ) .",

    ", a feedback scheme has been used to perform control of chaotic trajectories in inertia ratchets  @xcite .",
    "feedback flashing ratchets could be experimentally implemented monitoring the positions of a set of brownian particles  @xcite and subsequently using the information gathered to decide whether to switch on or off a ratchet potential according to a giving protocol .",
    "this experimental design will have to deal with a finite time lag between the collection of the information about the state of the system and the action because of the time interval needed for the measurement , transmission and processing of the information  @xcite .",
    "time delays in the feedback also appear naturally in complex systems with self regulating mechanisms ( see  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it is also remarkable for the ability of controlling chaos and improving coherence in excitable systems under delayed feedback  @xcite .",
    "the feasibility of nanotechnological feedback flashing ratchet devices and their performance under the presence of a time delay has been analyzed very recently in refs .  @xcite . in those works , and also in previous ones  @xcite , the two sources of spatial asymmetry involved , namely the feedback control and the shape of the potential , _ cooperate _ with the aim of maximizing the performance of the system . on the contrary , in this paper",
    "we investigate the effects of the _ competition _ between the potential asymmetry and the control asymmetry in a delayed feedback ratchet .    we have observed a rich dynamics that includes transport reversal .",
    "the inversion of the current direction upon the variation of the system parameters is a well - known phenomenon in brownian motors that can be produced by varying the characteristics of the non - equilibrium fluctuations  @xcite or the parameters of the time - dependent perturbation that drives the system out of equilibrium  @xcite .",
    "it also appears in other ratchet - like systems , such as deterministic inertial ratchets  @xcite .",
    "the phenomenon of current reversal has great importance in particle separation devices  @xcite , and in biology systems  @xcite . in our present study current reversal",
    "is achieved just by varying the time delay of the system .",
    "we start below with the description of the collective flashing ratchet and the delayed feedback protocol that we consider . in the next section , sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] , the evolution equations of the system are solved by langevin dynamics simulations and the rich dynamics encountered ( transport reversal , quasi - periodic modes of oscillation , multistability ) is analyzed .",
    "we finally review and further discuss in sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] the implications of the results .",
    "the feedback ratchet that we consider consists of @xmath0 brownian particles at temperature @xmath1 in a periodic potential @xmath2 .",
    "the force acting on the particles is @xmath3 , where the prime denotes the spatial derivative .",
    "the state of this system is described by the positions @xmath4 of the particles satisfying the overdamped langevin equations @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the friction coefficient ( related to the diffusion coefficient @xmath7 through einstein s relation @xmath8 ) , @xmath9 are gaussian white noises of zero mean and variance @xmath10 , and @xmath11 stands for the action of the controller .",
    "the feedback policy uses the sign of the net force per particle , @xmath12 as follows : the controller measures the sign of the net force and , after a time @xmath13 , switches the potential on ( @xmath14 ) if the net force was positive or switches the potential off ( @xmath15 ) if the net force was negative .",
    "therefore , the delayed control protocol considered is @xmath16 with @xmath17 the heaviside function [ @xmath18 if @xmath19 , else @xmath20 . we have used a sawtooth potential of period @xmath21 , i.e. @xmath22 , height @xmath23 , and asymmetry parameter @xmath24 : @xmath25 the height @xmath23 of the potential is the difference between the value of the potential at the minimum and at the maximum , while @xmath26 is the distance between the minimum and the maximum consecutive positions ( fig .",
    "[ fig : potential ] ) .",
    "thus when @xmath27 both the asymmetry of the potential and the feedback protocol favor transport in the same direction , whereas when @xmath28 there is a competition between them .",
    "we consider here the latter case .",
    "sawtooth potential [ eq .  ] of height @xmath29 and asymmetry parameter @xmath30 .",
    "units : @xmath31 and @xmath32 . ]",
    "we have performed numerical simulations of the langevin equations   by using an euler - maruyama scheme  @xcite , which reveals different dynamics of the collective ratchet for different ensemble sizes when the delayed feedback is present .",
    "we distinguish between few particles ( including @xmath33 as a particular case ) and many particles .",
    "following previous works  @xcite , we refer to the few particle case when the average long - time limit velocity of the center - of - mass , @xmath34 , is greater for the non - delayed feedback maximization protocol than for the optimal open - loop protocol , and many particle case otherwise .",
    "typically the frontier between these regimes corresponds to @xmath35 particles for potential heights of the order of @xmath36 or greater .",
    "let us begin our analysis with the non - delayed ( @xmath37 ) feedback ratchet .      for _ one particle _",
    "( @xmath33 ) the exact expression for the average velocity can be obtained by solving a fokker - planck equation with the proper effective potential that includes the action of the controller .",
    "this expression has been derived in  @xcite , and is indeed valid for any asymmetry parameter @xmath38 .",
    "it gives a positive flux that grows as @xmath39 for small potential heights ( @xmath40 ) , and tends to the finite value @xmath41 for large potential heights ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "the fact that the flux goes to a constant value for large potential heights is a direct consequence of the overdamped nature of the ratchet .",
    "we remark that enlarging the value of the ratio @xmath43 corresponds to effectively diminish the intensity of the white noise that accounts for thermal fluctuations .    for the collective ratchet compounded of",
    "a _ few particles _ an approximation for the center - of - mass velocity can be obtained assuming a purely stochastic behavior ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) .",
    "as the magnitude of the fluctuations of the force are of the order of the inverse of the square - root of the number of particles the stochastic approximation predicts the @xmath44 decay observed in our simulations for any asymmetries .",
    "in fact this qualitative behavior remains valid for any number of particles ( including _ many particles _ ) provided the asymmetry is @xmath28 . in this latter case",
    "the potential asymmetry acts against the feedback protocol , which tries to favor positive currents , and then the potential is turned on in very small intervals of time as the controller rapidly switches it off .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : evol_nodelay ] .",
    "thus the systems dynamics is effectively stochastic , contrary to the many particle case with cooperating asymmetries , where switches are slower and allow the system to have enough time to evolve in a quasideterministic way  @xcite .",
    "therefore when the potential asymmetry competes against the feedback the flux decays with the number of particles as @xmath45 even for many particles , contrary to the much slower @xmath46 dependence observed when both asymmetries cooperate  @xcite .    in any case the non - delayed protocol always gives a positive flux because it only switches on when it implies a positive displacement of the center - of - mass position .",
    "evolution of the net force per particle for the non delayed feedback ratchet for @xmath47 ( few particles ) and @xmath48 ( many particles ) .",
    "the potential is `` on '' only in the time intervals such that @xmath49 is positive .",
    "parameters of the potential : @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "units : @xmath31 , @xmath50 , and @xmath32 . ]",
    "the presence of a lag time in the control can cause negative currents and complicated dynamics that depends on the number of particles .",
    "let us first study the few particle case ( including one particle ) .",
    "when the control protocol presents a time delay the system performs worse because the delayed action of the controller implies some wrong actions .",
    "moreover , for large time delays the controller is unable to surmount the potential shape asymmetry and eventually the net current becomes negative .",
    "see figs .",
    "[ fig : flux_v0_10_n ] and  [ fig : flux_various_v0 ] .     center - of - mass velocity @xmath34 as a function of the time delay @xmath13 for different numbers @xmath0 of particles under the few particle regime .",

    "units : @xmath31 , @xmath50 , and @xmath32 . ]    for increasing time delays the correlation between the present sign of the net force and the measured sign that the controller actually uses decreases .",
    "thus the controller action begins to be uncorrelated to the present state of the system and it effectively begins to act as an open - loop ratchet  @xcite .",
    "in fact , for large delays the correlation between the state of the system and the measured retarded state is negligible and the negative flux becomes independent of the delay , because the ratchet is effectively open - loop controlled ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : flux_v0_10_n ] .",
    "therefore transport reversal appears here as a consequence of the competition between the asymmetry of the ratchet potential and the inherent asymmetry of the protocol .",
    "we stress that the influence of the asymmetry of the feedback protocol itself is not tuned here trivially , but changing the delay @xmath13 in the control .",
    "other ways of tuning the influence of the feedback protocol could not lead to current reversal .",
    "for example , it can be shown that a feedback protocol that switches on / off following the maximization protocol but with a probability of error @xmath52 does not enable negative fluxes even for asymmetries @xmath28 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    for the delayed protocol considered the critical value of the delay that gives zero current (",
    "thus the current is positive for smaller delays and negative for larger delays ) is related with the characteristic time in which the information about the state of the system is effectively lost , so the delayed maximization protocol is not able to achieve its goal of producing a positive current for delays larger than the critical one . increasing the height @xmath23 of the potential implies a faster dynamics .",
    "therefore the critical delay is expected to decrease with the height of the potential , in agreement with our simulations ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : flux_various_v0 ] .",
    "it is important to note that this critical delay tends to a constant _ nonzero _ value as @xmath53 .",
    "the reason is the same that makes the absolute value of the flux in both closed - loop and open - loop ratchets does not grow indefinitely as the potential goes up .",
    "these fluxes tend to a finite value because the time spent by the particles in diffusing during the off potential state goes to a constant in the absence of inertia .",
    "note also that the critical delay decreases with the number of particles ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : flux_v0_10_n ] . )",
    "let us now study the many particle case , which exhibits a completely different dynamics .      for large ensembles of particles ( @xmath54 )",
    "the flux is nearly zero in the non - delayed protocol ( see sec .  [",
    "subsec : non ] ) , but the introduction of a time delay stabilizes quasiperiodic solutions that give noticeable negative currents .",
    "we have found that , after a transient time , the delayed control allows the system to synchronize into a stable mode of oscillation such that the net force per particle evolves quasi - periodically .",
    "the evolution is not strictly periodic due to the stochastic nature of the dynamics .",

    "thus , as the adimensional delay must be multiplied by the factor @xmath76 in order to recover physical units , brownian particles of different shape and size respond differently to a given time delay .",
    "this effect could be useful for separating different kinds of macromolecules .",
    "we have seen that the performance of the system with competing asymmetries differs significatively from its counterpart ratchet with cooperating asymmetries . in the absence of delay",
    "the competition of asymmetries implies a decay of the current with the size of the ensemble much stronger than in the cooperative case ( @xmath77 ) . in the presence of delay",
    "the dynamics becomes richer with a current reversal for large delays .",
    "in the few particle regime the change from positive to negative current can be understood as a change from a purely closed - loop control to an effective open - loop control . on the other hand , in the many particle case",
    "the negative current regime appears for large enough delays as the consequence of the stabilization of several branches of quasiperiodic solutions .",
    "these stable branches have the opposite sign and are one semiperiod displaced with respect to those obtained for cooperating asymmetries , they also have a direct relation with them that allows the extension for the competing asymmetries case of the analytical results found in ref .",
