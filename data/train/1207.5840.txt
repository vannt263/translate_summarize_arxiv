    "the study of these galaxy populations provides us with the properties of their stellar population , including star formation rate ( sfr ) , stellar mass , and age .",
    "the gaseous properties of high - redshift galaxies , such as hydrogen and metal abundances , have also been studied in this decade , but these studies are mostly based on observations of intergalactic matter identified as hydrogen or metal absorption lines in the spectra of bright qsos .",
    "it is difficult to connect the stellar properties of the emission - line selected galaxies to the gaseous properties of the absorption - line selected galaxies , as they have very different selection biases .",
    "the emission - selected samples are biased by their flux and depend on the depth of the imaging surveys .",
    "therefore , they only provide information in galaxies at the brightest end of the luminosity function . in contrast , the absorption - selected samples are selected homogeneously by their gas content , and thus , they are less biased by the flux of the host galaxies . to connect stellar and gaseous properties of high - redshift galaxies , it is essential to detect the emission from the galaxies associated with the high - redshift absorption line systems .    among the several absorption lines seen in the spectra of background qsos , the damped ly@xmath0  absorption ( dla ) systems @xcite present unique opportunities to select h  i - rich ( h  i  column density ( @xmath14 ) @xmath15 @xmath16 ) galaxies at high redshift .",

    ", we reached an sfr upper limit of 1.0 @xmath7 yr@xmath8 , but no host galaxies were clearly detected . by contrast , host galaxies of strong mg  ii  systems ( @xmath37  ) at @xmath134 were detected with an sfr of more than 10 @xmath7 yr@xmath8 @xcite .",
    "this difference in the sfr between @xmath22 and @xmath11 was also argued in @xcite for the case of a very strong mg  ii  system with @xmath135  .",
    "they concluded that @xmath11 mg  ii  absorbers reside in smaller halos than @xmath22 systems .",
    "although our sample size is only two , our result for the strong mg  ii  systems with @xmath136 supports the scenario proposed in @xcite .",
    "using the grb absorbers , we were able to strictly constrain the continuum flux of the intervening absorbers , as the background grb afterglow used for identifying the absorbers had completely disappeared when we performed the deep imaging .",
    "thus , we did not need to consider the ambiguity of the noise estimation arising from the background psf subtraction .",
    "moreover , we could eliminate the possibility that the galaxy associated with the absorbers was hidden in the unsubtracted core of the background psf , even if there was no detectable galaxy around the position of the afterglow .",
    "these unambiguous constraints on the continuum level provide a unique opportunity to constrain the stellar mass of dla or mg  ii  host galaxies at @xmath13 for the first time .",
    "the upper limits on the stellar masses associated with the intervening dla or mg  ii  absorption systems at @xmath130 and @xmath90 were derived by fitting the stellar population synthesis models of @xcite to the upper limit for each object s continuum flux .",
    "we used the same set of stellar population synthesis models as were used in section [ color - color ] .",
    "we derived the upper limit of the stellar mass at each redshift for two separate cases : ( 1 ) we assumed that g1 was a host galaxy of the absorber , and ( 2 ) we assumed that no galaxy was associated with the absorber .",
    "figure [ mstar_rfix1 ] shows the fitted model seds at each redshift of the intervening absorption systems as a function of the observed wavelength , assuming case ( 1 ) . in the same figure , we also plot the flux of g1 in the @xmath73 band and the 3-@xmath5 upper limits on the fluxes in the other observing bands . in case",
    "( 1 ) , the model seds were scaled to fit the @xmath73-band flux of g1 . in this case , we excluded any model seds whose scaled fluxes exceeded any of the 3-@xmath5 upper limits for the observed bands other than the @xmath73-band . in case",
    "( 2 ) , the model seds were scaled to avoid exceeding any of the 3-@xmath5 upper limits in the observed bands .",
    "table [ tbl-2 ] summarizes the results of the stellar mass estimations .",
    "we found that the stellar mass of the dla or mg  ii  absorbers at @xmath137 is less than a few times @xmath12 @xmath7 , which is comparable to the mass of dwarf galaxies like lmc @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that our derived upper limits on the stellar mass for the less metal - rich dla at @xmath32 ( [ si / h ] @xmath138 ) and sub - dla at @xmath114 ( [ si / h ] @xmath139 ) are consistent with the stellar masses predicted from the observed mass - metallicity relation for @xmath13 star - forming galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .      in this section",
    ", we compare the measured ( or constrained ) sfrs and stellar masses for the dla and mg  ii  host galaxies at @xmath140 against those obtained for other @xmath13 galaxy populations , such as lbgs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and laes . to compare the distribution of their sfrs and stellar masses",
    ", we investigated their specific star formation rates ( ssfrs ) .",
    "the ssfr is defined as the ratio between the sfr and the stellar mass , and it is an indicator of the intensity of star formation in the galaxy . in figure",
    "[ ssfr ] , we plot the ssfr versus stellar mass for our dla absorbers at @xmath9 and mg  ii  absorbers at @xmath11 . given that we do not identify a galaxy corresponding to each absorber , we constrained the ssfr for each absorber in two separate cases : ( 1 ) we assumed that g1 was a host galaxy of the absorber , and ( 2 ) we assumed that no host galaxy was detected in our image .",
    "for all cases , we found that our absorbing galaxies were located between the low mass end of lbgs and laes .",
    "this implies that our sample absorbers , which consist of less metal - rich ( [ si / h ] @xmath141 ) dlas and mg  ii  systems , should not reside in the massive star - forming galaxies ( like typical lbgs ) .",
    "indeed , our derived ssfrs for the dla / mg  ii  absorbers are consistent with the ssfrs of @xmath142 , less metal - rich dlas , as derived from their abundance pattern using star formation histories ( sfhs ) similar to local irregular or dwarf starburst galaxies with weak star formation efficiency @xcite .",
    "we analyzed deep imaging data of the field around grb 050730 in optical to mid - infrared wavelengths to identify the host galaxies giving rise to the intervening dla and mg  ii  absorbers at @xmath143 , and @xmath90 .",
    "we used our own near - infrared and optical imaging data obtained with the subaru telescope , together with archived optical and mid - infrared imaging data obtained with the vlt and @xmath56 .",
    "we examined the color , impact parameter , and photometric redshift ( for the brightest galaxy only ) for the galaxies detected in our multi - color images to constrain the candidates for the galaxies associated with the intervening absorbers .",
    "we found no unambiguous candidate for the host galaxies in our data . using the @xmath86 limiting flux or the flux of the marginally detected galaxy ( g1 ) in the @xmath73-band image ( corresponding to the uv wavelength in the rest - frame of the intervening absorbers ) , we placed the following constraints on the upper limits of the sfr in the galaxies giving rise to the intervening absorbers : @xmath144 @xmath7 yr@xmath8 for the dla and sub - dla systems and @xmath145 @xmath7 yr@xmath8 for the mg  ii  systems .",
    "we used the 3-@xmath5 upper limit of the flux in each wavelength to constrain the stellar mass of the absorbing galaxies to be several times @xmath12 @xmath7 or lower .",
    "we confirmed that the stellar mass limits for the dla and sub - dla at @xmath32 and @xmath33 are consistent with the stellar masses expected from their metallicity , assuming the mass - metallicity relation observed at @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "both the sfr and the stellar mass for the intervening absorbers show properties similar to dwarf galaxies like the lmc @xcite .",
    "the intervening absorbers in the direction of grb 050730 , which consist of the less metal - rich dlas and mg  ii  systems with @xmath136  , show low ssfrs ( @xmath10 gyr@xmath8 ) , which are comparable to laes or lbgs at the low - mass end of their mass function .",
    "this low ssfr for our intervening absorbers favors the scenario that typical dlas and mg  iisystems with low metallicities are likely to reside in dwarf galaxies , rather than in massive star - forming galaxies like typical lbgs .",
