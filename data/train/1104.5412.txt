    "the general term on which one should perform the thermodynamic limit reads as follows : @xmath181 where in the trace above there are precisely @xmath182 creation and @xmath182 annihilation operators from the leads .",
    "we introduced the shorthand notations @xmath183 , @xmath184 and @xmath185 . the trace is further calculated using the wick theorem ( see @xcite ) which holds because the leads are noninteracting . the idea behind the wick procedure is to systematically use the anticommutation relations in order to reduce the monomial of order @xmath186 to a sum of monomials of order @xmath187 .",
    "the simplest case corresponds to all six combinations for @xmath188 .",
    "for example : @xmath189 where we used the cyclicity of the trace , the identity @xmath190 and the well known fact @xmath191 , where @xmath192 is the fermi function associated to lead @xmath5 .",

    "we perform the time integrals .",

    "it follows that the remaining off - resonant terms arise from @xmath267 for @xmath268 and from @xmath269 for @xmath270 . in these terms",
    "the delta functions impose conditions of the form @xmath271 , which means that the dot initially in the state @xmath272 passes to the state @xmath273 by exchanging _",
    "two _ electrons with the leads .",
    "this process is called _ cotunneling _ in the physical literature , because the electrons now tunnel pairwise . after collecting all these terms and taking advantage of some cancelations",
    "one arrives at the final expression for the cotunneling current given by eq.([cot1 ] ) of the theorem .",
    "let us make a few remarks on the cotunneling current . from the sequence of @xmath140 s appearing eq.([j4fin ] )",
    "one observes that the cotunneling processes always imply different leads .",
    "take for example the 3rd term .",
    "it describes the following sequence : an electron with energy @xmath42 enters the dot from the lead @xmath5 , while the second electron of energy @xmath274 leaves the dot to lead @xmath46 .",
    "the remaining two terms described the reverse process : the electron tunnels back from the lead @xmath46 and the second one tunnels out to lead @xmath5 .",
    "the other terms can be described in a similar way .",
    "also note that the cotunneling contributions explicitely contain the initial state of sample @xmath82 .",
    "a natural question is what we can say about the cotunneling current in the non - interacting case .",
    "let us recall here that @xmath234 are the eigenvalues of @xmath39 , i.e @xmath275 .",
    "then the operators @xmath276 and @xmath277 appearing in the coefficients @xmath140 in eq.([cot1 ] ) can be written in terms of @xmath278 . moreover , the sums over the many - body states of @xmath255 allow one to recover the resolvent @xmath279 and also the fermi - dirac operator @xmath280 . as an example we consider the 2nd term in eq.([j4fin ] . introducing the notation @xmath281",
    "one has : @xmath282 in the above calculations we used pull - through identities like @xmath283 or @xmath284 .",
    "now the only thing we should do is to use the wick theorem for the trace in the last line ( the theorem now holds as the interaction is absent ) : @xmath285 where @xmath286 and @xmath287 .",
    "the remaining terms in eq.([j4fin ] ) have to be manipulated in the same manner . collecting all of them",
    "one observes that all products of fermi functions vanish , and all factors like @xmath288 will only appear as @xmath289 with @xmath290 $ ] which allows us to drop @xmath93 .",
    "then the cotunneling current takes the following form ( which does not depend on the particle number @xmath291 ) :    @xmath292     one recognizes at once the 1st term in the expansion of the landauer formula w.r.t @xmath1 in the off - resonant case .",
    "so as expected , the off - resonant transport is still described by a landauer formula in the non - interacting case .",
    "as expected , in this case the steady - state current does not depend on the initial state of the sample .",
    "let us consider the same two - site system as the one in remark [ remarca244 ] .",
    "as we have already mentioned , one can numerically compute transients via the generalised master equation ( gme ) method @xcite .",
    "the main idea behind this method is to write down an equation for the reduced density operator ( rdo ) @xmath293 .",
    "note that @xmath294 only acts in the fock space of the sample .",
    "its derivative w.r.t time gives the evolution of the particle number in the sample which in turn is related to the currents flowing to and from the leads via the continuity equation .",
    "the method is usually formulated in terms of liouvillians ( see e.g. @xcite for relevant equations ) .",
    "although the main regime considered in other papers is the resonant one , here we pay more attention to the off - resonant regime .",
    "we are motivated by the fact that in our paper the transient current due to sequential tunneling processes is given by a rather simple analytical formula eq.([j2trans ] ) , which should be the main contribution on a time scale of order @xmath295 .    moreover , since gme also works for the resonant case , it would be a proper tool to compare the two - regimes .",
    "the off - resonant setup is achieved by taking a small hopping constant on the leads and by globally shifting the leads spectrum @xmath296 $ ] .",
    "the bias window @xmath297 $ ] is also fixed such that all the many - body states of the sample are below it .",
    "the time - dependent currents in the left ( l ) and right ( r ) leads are presented in fig",

    "the steady - state regime thus implies @xmath307 for some @xmath89 . instead of this one",
    "notices that both currents exhibit modulated oscillations around zero and no steady - state is achieved , although the amplitude of the oscillations decreases in time .",
    "this behavior could be predicted by our analytical result ( see eq.([j2trans ] ) ) .",
    "however , if one performs the ergodic limit the results converges to zero in the long - time limit , as clearly seen in fig.1b .    the transport in the resonant regime is shown in fig.2a for two initial conditions of the isolated quantum dot @xmath308 and @xmath158 . in this case",
    "we consider a larger @xmath309 and the bias window is chosen such that the first state of the dot is below it while the other ones within the bias window .",

    "the steady - state current _ does not depend on the initial condition of the sample_. this has already been rigorously established both in the non - interacting case @xcite and for weakly interacting systems @xcite .",
    "if the quantum dot is initially empty , the current on the right lead starts by being negative , which means that this lead actually feeds as well the dot .",
