    "there has been significant progress in the study of d - branes on calabi - yau manifolds in the recent past following the construction of d - branes at gepner points in calabi - yau moduli space . among the significant results",
    "have been the description of the a- and b - type boundary states , corresponding to d - branes , in gepner models and their transformation , under monodromy action as one moves in khler moduli space , to particular large - volume d - brane configurations@xcite .",
    "but once explicit results from the gepner points are available , one of the important issues is to understand how these descriptions of d - branes at gepner points can be recovered in a reasonably straightforward and algorithmic manner from the description of d - branes on large - volume cy manifolds .",
    "more generally , it would be useful to derive an understanding of the d - brane spectrum and other related properties including aspects of their world - volume theories in all possible `` phases '' of cy manifolds .",
    "while the ability to perform explicit computations is the reason to study some points in the khler moduli space , like the gepner points , the large - volume `` phase '' of cy manifolds provides a clearer geometric picture which is useful to understand in detail .",
    "as is well known in the closed string case , all `` phases '' can be reached by choosing appropriate values of the fayet - iliopoulos ( fi ) terms in the in the gauged linear sigma model ( glsm ) @xcite .",
    "thus the glsm seems to be the logical starting point for the study of d - branes in the different phases of the cy manifolds .",
    "of course , in the case of d - branes , we will have to understand the problem of marginal stability , whereby d - branes present at one point in khler moduli space may decay into other branes as the moduli are varied .",
    "but nevertheless one may hope to address even these issues by some means through the use of the glsm . in this paper",
    "it is this point of view , of trying to connect the behaviour of the d - brane spectrum in all the different phases by using the glsm description of d - branes , that we will pursue .",
    "various aspects of such a connection between the d - brane spectrum in different phases , and in particular at the the large volume limit and the gepner point have already begun emerging from the work of @xcite . among the most important result of these studies",
    "has been the uncovering of the special role of classes of exceptional bundles ( or more generally exceptional sheaves ) on cy manifolds .",
    "these d - brane configurations ( which have no moduli ) appear to be the building blocks of other brane configurations with moduli .",
    "the d - brane configurations which are seen at the gepner point by the recknagel - schomerus@xcite construction are all in this class .",
    "the @xmath2 orbit of b - type boundary states are all related to exceptional bundles in the large volume limit by monodromy transformations .",
    "the other b - type boundary states seen at the gepner point with @xmath3 are clearly bound states of these exceptional objects@xcite .",
    "the study of the case of the @xmath4 and its blowup to @xmath5 first showed a natural connection between the fractionally charged branes ( or equivalently wrapped branes pinned to the orbifold point in @xmath6 ) and a particular class of exceptional bundles on @xmath5@xcite . whereas the branes that exist at the orbifold point can be described by a quiver gauge theory , based on the mckay quiver ,",
    "the corresponding bundles on the blowup are related to a truncated version of this quiver , namely the beilinson quiver .",
    "moreover the beilinson quiver can be seen to be equivalent to the monad construction for bundles on @xmath5 .",
    "further , any sheaf on @xmath5 can be written as a cohomology of a complex involving the bundles that are the large - volume monodromy transforms of the fractional branes in the orbifold limit .",
    "this permits the description of d - branes in the large volume limit in terms of the numbers naturally associated with the labelling of charges of d - branes in the orbifold limit .",
    "this relationship immediately provides a handle on the question of marginal stability .",
    "whereas the charges of stable d - branes at the orbifold point ( in the orbifold basis ) have to be either all positive or all negative , the bundles in the large volume have no such restriction . clearly the candidates for decay ( in the passage ) from the large - volume limit to the orbifold point , are those branes which have a combination of negative and positive charges in the orbifold basis .    the extension of this procedure to the study of the landau - ginzburg(lg ) theory associated to the gepner point of a cy manifold is a logical one .",
    "one may regard the lg theory as an orbifold of the type @xmath7 if one disregards the superpotential .",
    "douglas and diaconescu@xcite ( see also @xcite for related observations ) considered only the so - called tautological line bundles on the orbifold @xmath7 ( this is equivalent to considering only the states associated with the vector representation of @xmath8 ) .",
    "then by using the inverse procedure of reconstructing a toric variety from the quiver data associated with the orbifold ( using the methods of @xcite ) , that one can construct the corresponding line bundles , @xmath9 on the space obtained by the resolution of the singularities of @xmath7 .",
    "one then constructs a set of vector bundles @xmath10 on the resolved space which are dual ( in the sense of k - theory ) to the @xmath9 .",
    "the restriction of these @xmath10 to the cy hypersurface provides exactly the set of exceptional vector bundles @xmath11 associated with the @xmath12 orbit of d - branes at the gepner point .",
    "more precisely , it was verified in @xcite that the d - brane charges associated with the @xmath11 were exactly the same as those obtained by monodromy transformation of the d - brane charges of the @xmath12 orbit at the gepner point .",
    "however the methods used by douglas and diaconescu to derive this remarkable result have two obvious limitations .",
    "first , the inverse procedure of reconstructing the toric variety that corresponds to resolving the singularities of the orbifold at the gepner point is a cumbersome one .",
    "more importantly , it is not clear that there is a canonically - defined procedure for all resolutions of the singularities .",
    "generically the cy hypersurface may not intersect some of the singularities and it is not clear how one may deal with such situations .    it is the attempt of this paper to show that in the frame - work of the glsm there is a method to construct a set of objects analogous to the fundamental objects of the douglas - diaconescu construction , namely the @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and the @xmath11 .",
    "the @xmath11 that we construct are identical to the set constructed by diaconescu and douglas in the examples they consider .",
    "the objects @xmath9 and @xmath10 are similar to theirs in the sense that the @xmath9 are a set of line bundles and that they are dual to the @xmath10 in the sense of intersection theory .",
    "further the restriction of @xmath10 to the cy hypersurface produces exactly the @xmath11 .",
    "furthermore we construct the @xmath9 in a canonical manner using the glsm in the neighbourhood of the large volume limit and show that the @xmath10 are defined by a consistent mathematical procedure that has a nice physical interpretation .",
    "the construction of the @xmath11 is then a straightforward matter . in a number of examples with one and two khler moduli",
    "we verify our claims . from the @xmath9 that we have constructed",
    "we can in fact reconstruct the quiver that is the analogue of the beilinson quiver in the general case .",
    "we take a further step and argue that the presence of the so - called @xmath13-field in the glsm allows us to reconstruct the mckay quiver that is associated to the orbifold lg theory , ( which indeed may or may not have a gepner construction ) .    in the next subsection",
    "we will sketch a more detailed overview of our method and results before we flood the reader with more technical details .",
    "the natural starting point for the construction of rigid d - branes on cy manifolds is the 6-brane .",
    "clearly there are no moduli in this case . in more mathematical terminology",
    "this is associated to the line bundle of degree zero on the cy manifold @xmath14 , denoted by @xmath15 .",
    "we can obtain this line bundle by restricting the line bundle @xmath16 on the ambient variety @xmath17 to the cy .",
    "we obtain an infinite set of other rigid objects @xmath18 , through the action of large - volume monodromy . the effect of the shift @xmath19 is implemented by the shift @xmath20 in the glsm .",
    "this has the effect of tensoring the initial bundle by a line bundle@xcite .",
    "this is physically equivalent to turning on d4-brane charges on the 6-brane together with lower brane charges .",
    "confining ourselves to the case where @xmath21 is @xmath1 for the moment , we can restrict our considerations to the set @xmath22 , where @xmath23 runs over @xmath24 to @xmath25 .",
    "this collection of line bundles @xmath26 will be our starting point . the collection @xmath27 is referred to as the foundation of a helix for reasons that will be made clear later . from the work of rudakov and",
    "others@xcite we have a well - defined mathematical procedure , known as mutations , that enable us to construct the @xmath10 .",
    "this procedure has a nice physical interpretation as has been demonstrated by hori , iqbal and vafa @xcite ( see also the earlier paper of zaslow@xcite ) .",
    "mutations correspond to brane creation in the mirror of the original variety @xmath21 .",
    "take a neighbouring pair @xmath28 in the set @xmath27 and consider the corresponding middle dimensional cycles on the mirror . in the mirror",
    ", a mutation corresponds to the creation of a new middle dimensional brane when the @xmath29 `` crosses '' @xmath30 .",
    "the mirror of this new middle - dimensional brane in the original variety @xmath21 is referred to as the mutation of the two @xmath29 that were our starting point .",
    "a sequence of such mutations enables us to construct all the @xmath10 up to a sign that is fixed so that the @xmath10 are in fact dual to the @xmath9 .",
    "if the chern classes of the @xmath10 are all that we are interested in then of course this can be obtained by simply examining the inverse of the euler matrix of the @xmath9 , as is indeed clear from the work of douglas and diaconescu . on restricting the @xmath10 to the cy hypersurface ,",
    "one obtains the @xmath11 .    for the general case ,",
    "going beyond @xmath1 , we formulate two conjectures that we verify in a variety of one and two khler modulus examples . + * conjecture 1 * : the large volume monodromy action on @xmath16 in the ambient variety @xmath21 produces an exceptional collection which is the foundation of a helix of appropriate period @xmath13 : @xmath31    * conjecture 2 * : all exceptional bundles and sheaves on @xmath21 can be obtained by the mutations of the helix @xmath27 given in conjecture 1 . in particular , there exists a mutated helix @xmath32 with @xmath33 , where @xmath34 corresponds to a sequence of @xmath23 left - mutations .    * conjecture 2a * :",
    "all the exceptional bundles on the cy which correspond to the the @xmath35 states at the gepner point are obtained by the restriction of the @xmath36 to the cy hypersurface .    indeed since exceptional collections and helices are known for a wide range of varieties including grassmannians , products of projective and flag varieties etc .",
    "( see @xcite and references therein ) it appears that we can carry out this procedure for a wide range of cy manifolds that can be described as hypersurfaces in such ambient varieties .",
    "( in the cases where there is no corresponding gepner construction , we would have to suitably generalise conjecture 2a ) .",
    "the corresponding quiver gauge theory can now be written down in a canonical way .",
    "it is interesting that we have circumvented the problem of determining which resolution of the singularities of the orbifold associated with the gepner point to deal with , since the large - volume limit of the glsm provides us with a definite resolution that we must deal with .",
    "however this quiver is the analogue of the beilinson quiver and misses the symmetry at the gepner point that is due to the orbifold group . restoring this symmetry corresponds to going to the corresponding mckay quiver from the analogue of the beilinson quiver .",
    "we argue that this is done by the @xmath13-field .",
    "it is the @xmath13-field that enables the missing link to be restored in the quiver diagram that then becomes the mckay quiver .",
    "the link was missing in the constructions of the large - volume limit since the @xmath13-field is set to zero in that limit .",
    "we leave the detailed argument to a subsequent section of this paper .",
    "this rule provides us , in principle , a means to write down the quiver gauge theories corresponding to the world - volume theories of the branes in different phases of the cy manifold , depending on which of the several @xmath13-fields are set to zero or acquire a non - zero vacuum expectation value in the world - sheet theory .",
    "finally , by using a generalisation of beilinson s methods for @xmath1 , one can in principle construct all sheaves on the ambient projective space .",
    "the restriction of these sheaves to the calabi - yau hypersurface @xmath14 provides one with a large collection of sheaves on @xmath14 .",
    "we would like to explain the motivation and background that have led to the results that are described in this paper .",
    "the work arose as a result of trying to understand d - branes ( in particular , d - branes with b - type boundary conditions ) in gauged linear sigma models with boundary .",
    "in particular , the theta term in the glsm lagrangian imposes non - trivial constraints on the possible boundary conditions .",
    "further , one needs to add a boundary _ contact _ term in order that boundary conditions in the glsm have a proper large volume ( nlsm ) limit@xcite . for the case of a six - brane ,",
    "i.e. , the d - brane associated with line bundle @xmath16 , one can see that this contact term ensures that the large - volume monodromy is captured properly in the glsm with boundary .",
    "this , in fact , carries over to the case of d - branes associated with non - trivial vector bundles .",
    "thus , the importance of large - volume monodromy is best seen in the glsm with boundary@xcite .",
    "as is well known , the glsm interpolates between different phases of the calabi - yau manifold . even in the simple example of calabi - yau manifolds with one khler modulus ,",
    "a key addition in the glsm to the fields which exist in the nlsm limit is the so - called @xmath13-field whose vacuum expectation value ( vev ) plays the role of an order parameter . in considerations of the glsm with boundary",
    ", this field again plays an important role .",
    "as we will see , even if one stays in the geometric phase , the transition from the nlsm to the glsm provides extra information about other phases as well provided we account for the behaviour of the @xmath13-field .",
    "mirror symmetry ( in its extended form ) also plays an important role in our considerations though they are not quite required for the results .",
    "the large volume limit gets mapped to a particular point in the moduli space of complex structures on the mirror .",
    "this point is rather special ",
    "it is the point of _ maximal unipotent monodromy _ and is given by the transverse intersection of divisors corresponding to degeneration of calabi - yau manifolds ( see @xcite and references therein for more details ) .",
    "further , the process of mutations has been related to brane creation on the mirror@xcite .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in section 2 , we set up our notation as well as conventions . in section 3 , we define helices and mutations and then describe our conjectures . as a result , we give a precise method to obtain the @xmath2 bundles for gepner models associated with calabi - yau manifolds . in section 4 ,",
    "we test our conjectures in several examples with one and two khler moduli .",
    "we also show how one deals with singularities ( in the ambient weighted projective space ) that are not inherited by calabi - yau hypersurfaces . in section 5 ,",
    "we show how one constructs the generalised beilinson quiver from the helices and then argue how the @xmath13-field enables one to recover the mckay quiver associated with the lg orbifold / gepner model .",
    "we conclude in section 6 with some remarks .",
    "we will be consider two classes of models in this paper .",
    "we shall use the language of the gauged linear sigma model ( glsm)/toric description in the discussion of the models      the glsm consists of six chiral superfields @xmath37 @xmath38 and a single abelian vector superfield .",
    "the bosonic components @xmath39 of the chiral superfields will later be identified with the quasi - homogeneous coordinates of some weighted projective space .",
    "the fayet - iliopoulos parameter is labelled @xmath40 and is related to the complexified khler modulus @xmath41 .",
    "the chiral superfield @xmath42 will also be called the @xmath43-field and plays a special role .",
    "the charge vector is @xmath44 with @xmath45 .",
    "the d - term constraint is given by @xmath46 in the absence of a superpotential , in the large volume limit , the space is a non - compact calabi - yau manifold corresponding to the total space of the line bundle @xmath47 over the weighted projective space @xmath48 .    the introduction of a superpotential @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is a quasi - homogeneous function ( of @xmath37 for @xmath51 ) of degree @xmath52 , gives rise to a compact calabi - yau manifold as a hypersurface @xmath14 given by the equation @xmath53 in weighted projective space @xmath54 in the nlsm limit ( @xmath55 ) and the compact calabi - yau hypersurface as @xmath14 .",

    "note that this in no way guarantees that the sheaf @xmath95 is stable or semi - stable .",
    "that has to be checked separately as has been noted by @xcite .",
    "note that , as pointed out in @xcite , the requirement that the @xmath314 be positive at the orbifold or gepner point is a physical one . from all known constructions for orbifolds",
    "it is clear that the d - brane spectrum there does not separately produce brane - anti - brane bound states .",
    "any such bound state is already present in the spectrum .",
    "hence there is no need to add anti - branes by taking some of the @xmath314 to be negative as in the theory at large volume .",
    "however this is not the case if we move away from the orbifold point .",
    "the dimension of the moduli space of the quiver gauge theory is given by the formula@xcite @xmath322 where @xmath323 is the _ cartan matrix _ associated with the quiver .",

    "however , the quiver gauge theory may have several branches and this formula holds for a specific branch .",
    "so far we have been restricting our attention to what we have called the generalized beilinson quiver .",
    "however , in general at an orbifold point , and presumably more generally , at a landau - ginzburg point , this can not be the full story . from the work of @xcite , it is clear that the quiver associated to the orbifold point is the mckay quiver . in the case of @xmath1 ,",
    "the mckay quiver is a closed quiver and the beilinson quiver is produced by truncating one of the links .",
    "thus , in the @xmath5 case the mckay quiver is a triangle with three vertices with three lines joining each vertex in ordered fashion .",
    "this clearly reflects the @xmath329 symmetry of the orbifold point ( see figure 3 ) .",
    "how can we reconstruct the mckay quiver if we began with the beilinson quiver ?",
    "we claim that the answer is clear from the construction of the glsm for the blow up of the @xmath4 orbifold . while in the large - volume limit , which is the setting for our construction of the @xmath29 , the @xmath36 and the corresponding quiver , we have set the @xmath13-field to zero , this is not true at the orbifold point . at the orbifold point ,",
    "the @xmath13-field , which has charge @xmath330 in this case , acquires a non - trivial vacuum expectation value , which gives rise to the twisted sectors of the orbifold theory .",
    "the combinations @xmath331 , ( for @xmath240 ) where the @xmath39 are the homogeneous coordinates of @xmath5 , in fact can give rise to homomorphisms from @xmath292 to @xmath16 because the combinations are of degree @xmath332 .",
    "this restores the missing link away from the large - volume limit .",
    "we can implement this procedure in any of the theories that we have considered .",
    "we give below the re - construction of the mckay - type quiver for @xmath5 ( figure 3 ) as well as for @xmath58 ( figure 4 ) .",
    "we depict the links obtained by using the @xmath13-field by dashed arrows .",
    "the quivers for the other examples that we consider can be worked out in a similar fashion .",
    "note that this reconstruction of the mckay quiver from the beilinson quiver gives us non - trivial information .",
    "for instance , bound states that use the link due to the @xmath13-field at the orbifold point are allowed in the spectrum but are likely to decay before we reach the large - volume limit , since there is no such link there and we have only the beilinson quiver .",
    "this point has also been made earlier , in @xcite , but the connection to the @xmath13-field was not realised there .",
    "another important example which illustrates the role of the @xmath13-field is the flop transition as seen by the quiver gauge theory .",
    "let us use the local model for the flop as given in @xcite where there are four fields , @xmath333 , with charges @xmath334 .",
    "in the limit of large and positive khler parameter @xmath335 , the fields @xmath336 and @xmath337 are set to zero .",
    "these play the role of @xmath13-fields in this limit .",
    "the corresponding quiver is given by the two nodes with two arrows joining them as in the first of the diagrams in fig .",
    "5 . in the flopped phase , where @xmath335 is large and negative , @xmath338 and @xmath339",
    "are set to zero and the other two are non - zero .",
    "the quiver for this phase is given by reversing the two arrows as in the second diagram in fig .",
    "it is interesting to note that this operation , in the derived category @xmath340 is equivalent to a change of @xmath341-structure . in general , the addition and removal of arrows , as well as the reversal of the direction of all arrows at a sink , under appropriate circumstances , correspond to changes of @xmath341-structure .",
    "we will not enter into a detailed discussion of the concept here but refer the reader to @xcite for definitions as well as other details .",
    "this procedure , of using the @xmath13-fields to add links in the quiver diagram appears to be completely general .",
    "in general at different limit points corresponding to different `` phases '' of the cy manifold , we can re - construct a quiver that would be in part , beilinson - like , and in part , mckay - like .",
    "given that we can do this from our considerations at the large volume end , we can thus obtain non - trivial information about the d - brane spectrum at different limit points deep inside different `` phases '' in the khler moduli space of cy manifolds .",
    "it would be interesting to apply this suggested technique to study the d - brane spectrum at a limit point in the hybrid phase of a two - khler modulus example and verify these , if possible , by an explicit computation using the periods of the cy manifold at such a point .",
    "note however that our procedure is not entirely complete .",
    "in general , on a n - dimensional ( weighted ) projective space considered at the orbifold or gepner point , there are not only states in the vector representation of @xmath342 but also states in other , higher - dimensional representations .",
    "we have not included these in our considerations so far , neither in the beilinson quiver nor in the corresponding mckay quiver .",
    "it is also time to sound a note of caution on one issue about which we have been somewhat cavalier so far .",
    "all our considerations above apply to constructions in the ambient variety @xmath21 in which the calabi - yau manifold is embedded as a hypersurface @xmath14 . thus to recover objects on the cy manifold we need to restrict these structures to the cy manifold .",
    "we have been careful about this in the large - volume limit but we have not really explored this issue at the orbifold point . while this has not been a problem with states associated to the @xmath12 orbit , this is unlikely to be true for other states which appear as bound states of the exceptional ones . but this takes us to issues , especially those regarding bound states , on which we will not have much to say in this paper .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that the entire discussion here in sec . 5 , regarding quiver theories , is somewhat different in spirit from the study of the mckay correspondence",
    ". given an arbitrary orbifold , it is not clear that there is a canonical resolution of the singularities of that orbifold .",
    "however , here our orbifold - like points in khler moduli space arise as the well - defined limit of a smooth cy manifold and there is no issue at all about which resolution has to be picked at the orbifold end of the story . but given that our aim here is to study d - brane spectra at different points in the kahler moduli space of a cy manifold , this is good enough .",
    "in this paper , we have presented a method of constructing exceptional bundles on weighted projective spaces using the helix naturally associated with the line bundle @xmath16 .",
    "these techniques generalise in a rather straightforward manner to spaces such as grassmannians , products of weighted projective spaces .",
    "however , in more general situations such as these , the helix associated with @xmath16 no longer consists of only line bundles .",
    "for example , the foundation of the helix on the grassmannian @xmath343 consists of spinor bundles and line bundles@xcite .",
    "this is presumably related to non - abelian nature of the glsm associated with the grassmannian and will be an interesting testing ground for some of conjectures and may also require some modifications before being adapted to more general situations . in this paper ,",
    "we have considered situations corresponding to cy compactifications where the cy manifold appears as a hypersurface in weighted projective space .",
    "there are other situations , such as f - theory compactifications where projective spaces and their blow - ups occur as the base of an elliptic fibration where our methods may have direct applications .",
    "the special role played by the line bundle @xmath16 is very much in line with recent k - theoretic considerations based on sen s study of non - bps branes@xcite .",
    "for example , in iib compactifications , all bps branes ( as well as some non - bps branes ) can be obtained as bound states of a certain number of d9 branes and anti - branes .",
    "further , d - brane charges in iib theories are classified by the k - theory group @xmath344 where @xmath21 is the spacetime on which the string propagates@xcite .",
    "if we restrict our considerations to the case for @xmath345 , where @xmath14 is a calabi - yau threefold and further , we consider only zero - branes in the non - compact spacetime @xmath346 , then the charges of the particles ( in iia string theory ) will be classified by @xmath347 . just as the d9-brane ( and its antibrane ) generates all other branes in flat spacetime , it is natural to expect the six - brane ( wrapping all of @xmath14 ) to generate all lower branes and hence charges .",
    "as we have seen , all exceptional branes can be generated by mutations .",
    "other branes must arise as bound states of these exceptional sheaves .",
    "this is in line with the claim of @xcite that the @xmath3 arise as bound states of the @xmath2 states .",
    "these issues will be discussed in a forthcoming publication .",
    "one issue that we have not considered in this paper is the precise location of lines of marginal stability .",
    "as we have pointed out in the introduction itself , our analysis allows us to identify candidates for stable objects at special points in the khler moduli space .",
    "it will be interesting to understand in more precise terms , where and how objects decay .",
    "it seems to us that the glsm would be the right setting to study this issue further .",
    "maybe , this might also be the way to obtain the flow of gradings proposed by @xcite .    in a companion paper@xcite",
    ", we discuss in detail the explicit construction of the exceptional bundles and some of their bound states in the glsm with boundary .",
    "these involve techniques similar to the constructions which appear in @xmath348 compactifications of the heterotic string though there are subtle differences .",
    "we suitably modify this construction to describe @xmath348 multiplets on the boundary of the worldsheet . as in our earlier paper@xcite ,",
    "an important issue is the inclusion of an appropriate contact term in order to have a sensible nlsm limit to the glsm .",
    "we find that this construction allows us to describe the tensoring of vector bundles by suitable line bundles under large volume monodromy transformations .",

    "is supported in part by the department of science and technology , india under the grant sp / s2/e-03/96 .",
    "consider a helix @xmath349 of period @xmath100 .",
    "the intersection matrix @xmath170 is upper - triangular with ones on the diagonal .",
    "we shall now prove that the process of left mutations corresponds to the diagonalisation of the upper triangular matrix @xmath350 .",
    "we will define the following sets of bundles @xmath351 , which are generated from the original helix @xmath27 .",
    "note that the sets @xmath351 for @xmath352 are not helices .",
    "consider @xmath353 and consider the matrix @xmath354 . on using the formula for the chern character of the mutated bundle is injective .",
    "the other case will include an additional minus sign , which can be compensated for in the definition of the entries in @xmath351 and is not important . ]",
    "@xmath355 , one can see that the matrix @xmath356 is also upper - triangular with ones in the diagonal .",
    "in addition , @xmath357 .",
    "the next set of left mutations will preserve the upper - triangular nature and will have @xmath358 .",
    "this is given by @xmath359 notice , that the first two terms of @xmath360 and @xmath361 are identical and in general , the first @xmath147 terms of the collections @xmath351 and @xmath362 coincide .",
    "the process ends after @xmath363 steps , after which the matrix @xmath364 is the identity matrix .",
