    "the ground state of the odd-@xmath0 tl ( @xmath6 ) nuclei are 1/2@xmath7  @xcite corresponding to the proton hole in the 3s@xmath8 ( below the z = 82 spherical shell closure ) orbital .",
    "the low - lying excited states in the odd-@xmath0 thallium nuclei in the @xmath9 region have been interpreted by the occupation of the odd proton in the @xmath10@xmath11 and @xmath10@xmath12 orbitals . however , the  intruder \" @xmath10@xmath13 and @xmath10@xmath14 orbitals are required to describe the higher spin levels in these nuclei .",
    "these orbitals intrude from the major shell above @xmath15 in to the shell below it for both prolate and oblate deformations .",
    "these orbitals play significant role in breaking the spherical symmetry in nuclei by inducing non - spherical shapes in them .",
    "it is important to note that the @xmath5 level lies above the @xmath16 spherical sub - shell closure .",
    "therefore , the  intruder \" @xmath5 level in the lighter tl nuclei provides a playground to study the properties of the levels for the heavy nuclei above @xmath16 which are otherwise difficult to study .",
    "rotational bands based on the intruder @xmath10[505]9/2@xmath17 nilsson state with oblate deformation and decoupled band based on the @xmath18 intruder level with prolate deformation have been reported in the odd-@xmath0 @xmath19tl nuclei  @xcite .",
    "similarly , the strongly coupled oblate band based on the @xmath10[606]13/2@xmath7 nilsson state and weakly coupled prolate band from the @xmath10@xmath14 orbital have also been observed in the neutron deficient ( n @xmath20 114 ) isotopes @xmath21tl  @xcite . however ,",
    "the excited state corresponding to the intruder @xmath10@xmath14 orbital has not yet been observed in @xmath22tl .",
    "it has been seen that the excitation energy of the 13/2@xmath7 state corresponding to the @xmath5 orbital in the odd-@xmath0 thallium nuclei increases gradually with the neutron number  @xcite and hence , it may become non - yrast for the heavy thallium isotopes . the non - yrast states can be better studied using light - ion beams , like @xmath2-induced fusion - evaporation reactions . in the present work , the @xmath23-ray spectroscopy of @xmath1tl has been studied using @xmath2 beam in order to investigate the proton intruder states along with the multi - quasiparticle states which may be originated from the coupling of the odd - proton with the aligned neutron pairs in this nucleus . to identify the intruder levels ,",
    "it is necessary to deduce the spin and parities of the excited states unambiguously .",
    "so , a clover hpge detector was used as a @xmath23-ray polarimeter to deduce the multipolarity of the @xmath23 rays which helps in the unambiguous determination of the parity of the excited states .",
    "the high spin level structures in @xmath1tl were earlier investigated by r. m. lieder et al .",
    "@xcite way back in 1978 .",
    "they had used two ge(li ) detectors to detect the @xmath23 rays in coincidence and for angular distribution study .",
    "they have proposed a level scheme from these studies which included a band based on @xmath18 orbital and a three - quasiparticle band .",
    "in the present work , the excited states in @xmath1tl were populated by fusion - evaporation reaction @xmath1au(@xmath24he , 4@xmath3)@xmath1tl using @xmath2 beam of energy 48 mev from the k-130 cyclotron at variable energy cyclotron centre , kolkata .",
    "a 5 mg/@xmath25 self supporting @xmath1au target was used in this experiment .",
    "the experimental set up consisted of a single - crystal large high purity ge ( hpge ) detector ( 80% relative efficiency ) , a clover hpge detector and a leps detector which were placed at 30@xmath26 , 90@xmath26 and 135@xmath26 angles , respectively , with respect to the beam direction .",
    "the detectors were arranged in a median plane configuration .",
    "a 50-element ( 25 each on the top and on the bottom ) @xmath27 multiplicity array was also used . the energy and the timing information from each of the ge detector and the multiplicity fold information were recorded in the list mode using a @xmath23-@xmath23 trigger .",
    "there was no hardware condition set on multiplicity fold .",
    "a hardware time - to - amplitude converter ( tac ) module was used to record the time between the master trigger and the rf signal of the cyclotron ( rf-@xmath23 tac ) to identify the  beam - on \" and  beam - off \" events .",
    "about 4.3 @xmath28 10@xmath29 coincidence events were recorded in this experiment .",
    "the detectors were calibrated for @xmath23-ray energies and efficiencies by using the @xmath30ba and @xmath31eu radioactive sources .",
    "the coincidence data were sorted into a @xmath23-@xmath23 matrix using the data from the single - crystal hpge and clover hpge detectors for offline analysis .",
    "this two - dimensional matrix was created with a gate on the prompt peak in the rf-@xmath23 tac .",
    "a prompt time window of @xmath3250 ns was chosen .",
    "the analysis has been done by using the program radware  @xcite .",
    "the multipolarities of the @xmath23-ray transitions have been determined from the angular correlation analysis using the method of directional correlation from the oriented states ( dco ) ratio , following the prescriptions of krmer - flecken et al .",
    "@xcite . for the dco ratio analysis ,",
    "the coincidence events were sorted into an asymmetry matrix with data from 30@xmath26 detector ( @xmath33 ) on one axis and 90@xmath26 detector ( @xmath34 ) on the other axis . the dco ratio ( for @xmath35 , gated by a @xmath23-ray @xmath36 of known multipolarity )",
    "is obtained from the intensities of the @xmath23 rays ( i@xmath37 ) at two angles @xmath34 and @xmath33 , as @xmath38 by putting gates on the transitions with known multipolarity along the two axes of the above matrix , the dco ratios were obtained for each @xmath23 ray . for stretched transitions ,",
    "the value of r@xmath39 would be close to unity for the same multipolarity of @xmath35 and @xmath36 . for different multipolarities and for mixed transitions ,",
    "the value of r@xmath39 depends on the detector angles ( @xmath34 and @xmath33 ) and on the mixing ratio ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "the r@xmath39 values were also calculated using the ` angcor ' code @xcite and were compared with the measured ones .",
    "the spin alignment parameter @xmath41 is important for such calculations which is normally taken as 0.3 for heavy - ion fusion - evaporation reaction . however , for the light - ion induced reaction , as in the present case , the @xmath41 value is expected to differ .",
    "therefore , the value of the @xmath41 parameter has been obtained in the present work by comparing the measured value with the calculated values of r@xmath39 of known multipole transitions in @xmath1tl . for this , the 685-kev stretched e2 transition was chosen gated by the 560.9-kev e1 transition .",
    "this choice was based on the fact that both are pure transitions of different multipolarities .",
    "the gate width was taken sufficiently narrow so that there is no contamination .",
    "the r@xmath39 value for this has been calculated for various values of @xmath41 and are shown in fig .",
    "it can be seen from this figure that a value of @xmath42 reproduces the mean experimental value of @xmath43 .",
    "this value of @xmath41 was used to calculate the value of r@xmath39 for the other transitions . for a pure dipole transition , gated by a stretched quadrupole transition",
    ", the calculated value of r@xmath39 is 1.64 while for a mixed dipole transition with @xmath44 , r@xmath39 is 0.71 .",
    "the validity of the r@xmath39 measurements was further tested by comparing the experimental values , obtained in this work for the in - band @xmath45 mixed @xmath46 transitions , for which the mixing ratios are known from lieder et al .",
    "@xcite , gated by the stretched @xmath47 transitions in @xmath1tl with the calculated ones .",
    "these agree well within the uncertainty of our measurements and the uncertainty of the reported mixing ratios .",
    "definite parities of the excited states have been assigned from the polarization asymmetry ( pdco ) ratio , as described in refs .",
    "@xcite , from the parallel and perpendicular scattering of a @xmath23-ray photon inside the clover detector , used in the present experiment .",
    "the pdco ratio measurement gives a qualitative idea about the type of a transition ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "the pdco asymmetry parameters have been deduced using the relation , @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the counts for the actual compton scattered @xmath23 rays in the planes parallel and perpendicular to the reaction plane .",
    "the parallel and perpendicular scattering data of the @xmath23 rays were obtained from the clover detector which was placed at 90@xmath52 for better polarization sensitivity .",
    "for the parallel counts ( n@xmath53 ) , the condition is set on the selection of events in which the @xmath23 rays recorded by a clover detector undergoes scattering between the segments parallel to the beam axis ( orientation axis ) . on the other hand , for perpendicular counts ( n@xmath54 )",
    ", the events scatter between the segments perpendicular to the beam axis were taken .",
    "the correction due to possible asymmetry and different response of the clover segments , a correction factor , defined by a(@xmath55 ) = @xmath56 , was determined using an unpolarized @xmath31eu source .",
    "the values of a(@xmath55 ) have been fitted using the expression a(@xmath55 ) = a + b@xmath55 .",
    "the fitting , shown in fig .  2 , gives the values of the constants as a = 0.990(12 ) and b @xmath57 10@xmath58 .",
    "positive and negative values of @xmath59 indicate electric and magnetic type of transitions , respectively .",
    "the low energy cut off for the polarization measurement was about 200 kev in the present experiment .",
    "the asymmetry parameters ( @xmath59 ) obtained , in the present experiment , for different @xmath23-transitions are shown in fig .",
    "single gated @xmath23-ray spectra obtained in this work , gated by the previously known 387-kev and 561-kev @xmath23 rays belonging to @xmath1tl , are shown in fig .",
    "4(a ) and fig .",

    "tentatively assigned 470-kev transition from the 3067-kev level and 535-kev transition from the 2801-kev level , reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , have been clearly observed in figs .",
    "4(a ) and 4(b ) , respectively .",
    "therefore , these @xmath23-ray transitions have been firmly placed in the level scheme . on the other hand ,",
    "the 412.5-kev @xmath23-ray , placed above the 3277-kev 29/2@xmath60 state in ref.@xcite , has been excluded in the present work based on its coincidence relation .",
    "an improved level scheme of @xmath1tl , obtained in this work , is given in fig .",

    "6(a ) and 6(b ) , respectively .",
    "it can be seen from these figures that the perpendicular counts ( n@xmath54 ) are clearly more than the parallel counts ( n@xmath53 ) for both the transitions and hence , the value of @xmath59 are positive for both the transitions .",
    "this suggests that both the 557.5- and the 561-kev @xmath23 rays are of electric type . it may be noted that because of the 561-kev gate in fig .",
    "6(a ) , there is no contamination of the 557.1 -kev transition from the 21/2@xmath17 level at 2597 kev which is of @xmath47 type .",

    "6(b ) , even if the gating transition contains some contribution from 557.1-kev peak , the counts in the 561-kev peak will not be affected as the 561- and the 557.1 kev transitions are not in coincidence .",
    "the @xmath69 value of 1.03(10 ) obtained for the 557.5-kev transition gated by the 561-kev known @xmath109 transition ( see table  i ) indicates that it is of same multipolarity as 561-kev , i.e dipole .",

    "a value of r@xmath112 has been obtained for the 561-kev transition using the 767-kev stretched @xmath47 gate , confirming its dipole assignment .",
    "it may also be noted again that there is no contamination from the 557.1-kev transition in the 767-kev gate .",
    "therefore , these measurements indicate that the type and the multipolarity of the 557.5-kev transition is same as that of the 561-kev transition .",
    "we have also calculated the value of polarization and pdco using the formalism given in ref.@xcite ( and references there in ) for the 557.5-kev transition assuming it to be @xmath109 and mixed @xmath46 transition with the mixing ratio as given in ref.@xcite .",
    "the measured value of + 0.13(2 ) is in better agreement with the calculated value of + 0.10 obtained assuming @xmath109 transition rather than the calculated value of + 0.04 obtained assuming mixed @xmath46 transition for the 557.5-kev @xmath23 .",
    "the calculations also yields a value of + 0.08 for the known @xmath109 transition of 561-kev , for which the measaured value is + 0.09(1 ) .",
    "all the above results indicate that the 557.5-kev @xmath23-ray is of @xmath109 type rather than a mixed @xmath46 type and hence , the spin and parity of the 1553 kev level is 13/2@xmath7 . also , as the 561-kev transition is an @xmath109 transition ( our results is in agreement with lieder et al . ) , the spin and parity of the 2114 kev level is 15/2@xmath17 .",
    "it may be noted that the angular distribution as well as the conversion electron measurements of the 557.5-kev @xmath23 ray from the 1553 kev level by lieder et al . were not free from the contamination due to the 557.1-kev @xmath47 transition but there was no such contamination for the 561-kev transition from the 2114 kev level .",
    "the multipolarity of the 811-kev @xmath23 ray , from the 2114-kev level to the 1303-kev level , has been found to be of mixed dipole ( @xmath46 ) character from our dco and the polarization measurements ( see fig .  3 and table  i ) .",
    "this lends additional support to the new @xmath113 assignments of the 2114- and 1553-kev levels in this work .",
    "better statistics for the higher lying @xmath23 rays , obtained in the present work , helped us to establish definite @xmath113 assignments of the 3169- and 3277-kev states which were only tentatively assigned in the previous work @xcite .    in one of the previous experiments  @xcite , the @xmath114 of the 1953- and 1867-kev states",
    "were assigned as 9/2@xmath17 and 9/2 , respectively . in the present work the 958-kev @xmath23 ray from the 1953-kev state to the 995-kev state has been found to be of @xmath109 type from the dco and the polarization measurements .",
    "the polarization measurement for the weak 871-kev @xmath23 ray from the 1867-kev level to the 995-kev level could not be measured , but the dco ratio value for this @xmath23 indicate that it is of mixed dipole character . as a result , the @xmath114 of the 1953- and 1867-kev levels",
    "have been assigned as 13/2@xmath7 and 13/2@xmath17 , respectively .",
    "the known @xmath23-rays in band b2 has been confirmed in the present work and the j@xmath115 assignments have been made .",
    "the tentatively - assigned 348- and 535-kev @xmath23-rays in this band have been placed firmly in this work from the coincidence relation with the other @xmath23 rays .",
    "neither the dco ratio nor the pdco ratio could be obtained for the weak cross - over transitions of energy 470 kev in band b1 and 348 , 535 , 614 kev in band b2 . however , the spin and parity of the states , from which these transitions are emitted , are fixed from the mixed ( @xmath46 ) transitions corresponding to those cross - over transitions .",
    "therefore , @xmath47 multipolarity has been adopted for the above transitions .",
    "a new band , b3 , has been observed for the first time in the present work .",
    "the @xmath23 rays belonging to this band has been observed in the gated spectra shown in fig .",
    "these @xmath23 rays are found to be of mixed @xmath46 in nature .",
    "the cross - over @xmath47 transitions could not be assigned with certainty in this work as they overlap with the other known strong transitions .",
    "they can only be placed unambiguously from a double gated spectrum , obtained from a tripple @xmath23 cube , which is outside the purview of the present work .",
    "the spin and parity of the band - head of this band is based on the r@xmath39 measurement of the 262-kev transition which decays from the 2376-kev band - head to the 2114 kev level .",
    "to avoid contamination due to the 263-kev and the 264-kev transitions from the 2529 kev and the 2860 kev levels , different gating transitions were chosen to obtain @xmath69 values of these transitions .",
    "the @xmath69 value of the 262-kev transition indicate that it is a @xmath116 transition and hence the band - head spin of 17/2 is assigned for the band b3 .",
    "however , as the 262-kev transition was assigned as an @xmath46 transition , only tentatively , the parity of this band is also tentatively assigned as negative .",
    "the proton fermi level for the tl isotopes lie below the @xmath117 shell closure near the @xmath118 and the @xmath119 orbitals whereas , the neutron fermi level lies near the @xmath14 , @xmath120 and @xmath121 orbitals .",
    "therefore , the 1/2@xmath7 ground state and the 3/2@xmath7 first excited state in the @xmath1tl are due to the occupation of the odd - proton in the @xmath122 and @xmath11 orbitals .",
    "the 9/2@xmath17 isomeric states , observed in the neutron deficient odd - mass tl isotopes in the mass region @xmath123 , have been interpreted in terms of the occupation of the odd proton in the @xmath13  intruder \" orbital .",
    "the [ 505]9/2@xmath17 nilsson orbital comes down in energy for oblate deformation and becomes available for the odd proton in tl nuclei .",
    "consequently , the observed band structures based on the 9/2@xmath17 isomeric states in the odd-@xmath0 tl nuclei , and similar to the band b1 in @xmath1tl , were interpreted as oblate deformed band .",
    "similarly , the @xmath10[606]@xmath124 orbital originated from the @xmath5 state also intrudes in to the fermi level for tl nuclei for such deformation .",
    "this is evident from the observation of the 13/2@xmath7 state in the odd-@xmath0 neutron deficient tl isotopes .",
    "band structure based on this state has been reported for the lighter isotopes of @xmath21tl @xcite . however , this state has not been reported so far in @xmath22tl .    in the present work ,",
    "we have observed two 13/2@xmath7 states at 1553 kev and 1953 kev ; either of which may be a candidate for the @xmath5 state .",
    "the decay pattern of the former 13/2@xmath7 state in @xmath1tl is quite similar ( a strong @xmath109 transition to the h@xmath125 band ) to the observed decay pattern of the @xmath5 states in the lighter tl isotopes @xcite .",
    "therefore , the 13/2@xmath7 state at 1553 kev in @xmath1tl seems to be a candidate for the @xmath10[606]@xmath124  intruder \" configuration .",
    "while collective structure based on this configuration have been observed for the lighter tl iostopes , single - particle interpretation was given for the band - like sequence based on the 13/2@xmath7 level in @xmath126tl @xcite .",
    "no collective band structure based on this state , however , has been observed in the present work for @xmath1tl .",
    "the variations of the excitation energies of the lowest @xmath127 states ( most likely originated from the @xmath10[606]@xmath124  intruder \" configuration ) in the odd-@xmath0 tl isotopes are shown in fig .",
    "7 as a function of the neutron number .",
    "the same for the bi isotopes are also shown in this figure for comparison .",
    "the excitation energy of the 13/2@xmath7 state in @xmath1tl , shown as a red encircled point , follows the systematic behaviour of the odd-@xmath0 tl isotopes similar to the case for bi isotopes . for the lighter isotopes of tl , the excitation energies of the 13/2@xmath7 states are at much higher energies compared to those in bi isotopes",
    "this is because of the fact that the proton fermi level of bi isotopes lies near the @xmath13 orbital above the @xmath117 shell closure and so , for relatively larger oblate deformation ( for the lighter bi isotopes ) the energy difference between the @xmath18 and the @xmath5 states is smaller compared to that at the smaller deformation ( for the heavier bi isotopes ) .",
    "however , the energy of this state relative to the @xmath18 state should be similar for both tl and bi nuclei , which is indeed true for the @xmath128 isotones of bi and tl .",
    "as the neutron number increases , the excitation energy of the 13/2@xmath7 state is observed to increase for both bi and tl and tends to saturate , suggesting near spherical shapes for the heavier isotopes .",
    "the alignments ( @xmath129 ) for the bands in @xmath1tl , observed in the present work has been shown in fig .",
    "8 as a function of rotational frequency @xmath130 along with those in the neighboring isotopes @xmath126tl and @xmath131tl .",
    "it can be seen from this figure that the initial alignments for the @xmath18 band of all the three isotopes are very similar .",
    "the experimental band crossing of this band in @xmath1tl , @xmath131tl and @xmath126tl  @xcite take place at the rotational frequencies of @xmath132 mev , 0.36 mev and 0.28 mev , respectively . although , there are differences in the crossing frequencies , the gain in alignments after the band crossing are seen to be very similar for the three isotopes .",
    "the first band crossing observed in @xmath126tl  @xcite was interpreted as due to the neutron pair alignments in the @xmath14 orbital . in comparison to that , the observed band crossing of band b1 in @xmath1tl may also be attributed to the neutron pair alignment in @xmath133@xmath14 orbital .",
    "therefore , the configuration of the higher lying states in this band ( above 2426 kev ) would be @xmath134 .",
    "the excitation energies of the bands b2 and b3 in @xmath1tl indicate that these negative parity bands are based on the three quasiparticle ( qp ) configurations .",
    "the similarities in the values of @xmath129 of these bands indicate that they are of similar configuration . in the neighboring",
    "even - even hg nuclei , the negative parity bands have been interpreted as two - qp decoupled bands with a microscopic structure of a completely decoupled @xmath14 neutron and a low - j neutron of opposite parity in the adjacent @xmath121 , @xmath135 or @xmath120 orbitals @xcite .",
    "the alignment pattern for the band b2 in @xmath1tl is quite similar to that for the 5@xmath17 band in its immediate even - even neighbor @xmath136hg .",
    "the alignment of this band in @xmath136hg was interpreted as the coupling of a fully aligned @xmath14 neutron and a poorly aligned low - j ( @xmath121 , @xmath120 or @xmath135 ) neutron @xcite .",
    "further alignment of two more @xmath14 neutrons has also been observed for this band in @xmath136hg at a higher spin with a gain in alignment of about 9@xmath137 .",
    "the similarities in the values of @xmath129 between the 5@xmath17 band in @xmath136hg ( before band crossing ) and the bands b2 and b3 in @xmath1tl indicate that their intrinsic structures are similar i.e one neutron in the @xmath14 orbital and another in a low - j negative parity orbitals .",
    "since most of the observed aligned angular momenta are taken care by these neutron configurations , the contribution of the odd - proton to the @xmath129 is very small and hence the odd - proton should be in a high-@xmath138 orbital of @xmath13 or @xmath14 , which is indeed the case for oblate deformation .",
    "considering the negative parity of the bands , the intrinsic configuration of the bands b2 and b3 in @xmath1tl may be considered as @xmath139 .",
    "a strong overlap of these bands to the @xmath5 state through an @xmath109 transition supports this assignment .",
    "it may be noted that for either case of the odd - proton be in @xmath13 or @xmath14 orbital , the contribution of the odd - proton to the aligned component of the angular momenta would be very small as it is in the high-@xmath138 orbital .",
    "so , the plot of @xmath129 would look similar for both the cases and it would not be possible to distinguish the two different configurations from the aligned angular momenta .",
    "the three - qp level structures above the 13/2@xmath7 state in @xmath126tl are somewhat different than those for the @xmath22tl . in @xmath126tl , several band structures or sequence of levels have been observed to decay to the 17/2@xmath7 state which is not the case for @xmath22tl .",
    "it seems that the configuration of the three - qp band in @xmath1tl is somewhat different from that in @xmath126tl although the aligned angular momenta ( @xmath129 ) are similar in these isotopes .",
    "however , the three - qp band in @xmath131tl has been reported to be of positive parity @xcite in contrast to the negative parity in @xmath1tl .",
    "therefore , it may be worthwhile to confirm the parity assignment of the three - qp band in @xmath131tl in a separate experiment",
    ".    the experimental band crossings of the band b2 have been observed to take place at @xmath132 mev which is little higher than that in @xmath131tl ( at @xmath140 mev ) .",
    "no band crossing has been observed for the band b3 which may indicate that the crossing is further delayed in this band .",
    "however , a gradual gain in alignment may be noticed for the band b3 .",
    "it would be interesting to extend this band to higher spin members to see if the gradual alignment continues or a band crossing occurs at a higher rotational frequency .",
    "an alternative interpretation of the band b2 and b3 may be given based on the recent results obtained for the excited states in the immediate even - even neighbor @xmath136hg .",
    "the excited states in this nucleus have been studied by ( @xmath2,x@xmath3 ) reaction up to 2.4 mev of excitation energy and the states ( up to 1.9 mev ) have been interpreted using a theoretical description within the @xmath141 extended supersymmetry model @xcite . in this model , @xmath136hg has been considered as a fifth supermultiplet member to the so - called magical quartet consisting of @xmath142pt and @xmath143au . in their study ,",
    "a low - lying 3@xmath7 state and a second 4@xmath7 state have been identified in @xmath136hg nucleus through precise spin determination .",
    "the band - head spin - parity of 15/2@xmath17 and 17/2@xmath17 for the bands b2 and b3 , respectively , in @xmath1tl may be considered as the @xmath13 proton coupled to the low - lying 3@xmath7 and 4@xmath7 states of its immediate even - even neighbour @xmath136hg .",
    "the difference in the excitation energies between the 4@xmath7 and the 3@xmath7 states in @xmath136hg ( @xmath144 kev ) is found to be very similar to that between the band heads of the bands b3 and b2 ( 262 kev ) in @xmath1tl .",
    "therefore , the configuration of the bands b2 and b3 may be considered as 3@xmath145 and 4@xmath146 , respectively .",
    "it would be interesting to investigate if the four neighboring nuclei @xmath147hg and @xmath148tl can be described as the members of a supermultiplet .",
    "the total routhian surface ( trs ) calculations have been performed for the @xmath18 ( band b1 ) and the @xmath5 configurations in @xmath1tl .",
    "the hartee - fock - bogoliubov code of nazarewicz   _ et al . _",
    "@xcite was used for the calculations .",
    "the procedure has been outlined in ref .",
    "a deformed woods - saxon potential and pairing interaction was used with the strutinsky shell corrections method .",
    "the trss were calculated in the @xmath149 deformation mesh points and minimized in the hexadcapole deformation @xmath150 .",
    "the contour plots of the trss , calculated for the band b1 have been shown in fig .",
    "9 . in these plots",
    ", @xmath151 corresponds to a prolate shape and @xmath152 to an oblate shape .",
    "the value of @xmath23 lies in between these two limits for a triaxial shape .",
    "9 clearly shows a minimum in the trs at a deformation of @xmath153 and @xmath154 , indicating an oblate shape for @xmath1tl for the @xmath18 configuration .",
    "therefore , the rotational band observed in @xmath1tl based on this configuration is due to the oblate deformation as in the other lighter tl isotopes .",
    "the surfaces calculated for the @xmath5 configuration in @xmath1tl have been shown in fig .",
    "the minimum in the routhian surfaces , in this case , has been found to be at @xmath155 and @xmath156 , indicating an oblate shape with very small deformation .",
    "rotational band like structure is not expected for such a small deformation .",
    "it may be noted that no rotational band structure has been observed in @xmath1tl based on the @xmath5 state in accordance with the trs calculations .",
    "the @xmath23-ray spectroscopy of the odd-@xmath0 @xmath1tl has been studied in the fusion - evaporation reaction of @xmath1au target with @xmath24he beam at 48 mev .",
    "a new and improved level scheme of @xmath1tl is presented from the present work which includes 8 new @xmath23-ray transitions .",
    "the previously known @xmath23-rays have been observed , some of the tentatively placed @xmath23-rays have been confirmed and a new band structure has been identified in this nucleus . the dco ratio and the polarization asymmetry ratio measurements",
    "have been carried out to assign the spins and parities of the levels .",
    "evidence for the existence of the @xmath5 intruder state has been observed for the first time in this nucleus .",
    "however , no rotational band structure has been observed based on this state .",
    "a negative parity for the band b2 has been assigned in this work from the polarization measurements and a new configuration has been assigned for this three - quasiparticle band . the new band b3 has been found to be based on 17/2@xmath60 band - head .",
    "possible configurations of the bands have been discussed in the light of the neighboring nuclei .",
    "configuration dependent trs calculations have been performed for @xmath1tl .",
    "the observation of rotational band based on @xmath18 configuration and the non - observation of any rotational band based on @xmath5 configuration are well corroborated by the deformation parameters obtained from the trs calculations .",
