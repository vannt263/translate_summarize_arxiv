    "we consider an environment without caustics and look for solutions of the form    @xmath8    where the eikonal function @xmath9 defines a surface of constant phase .",

    "transmitters send ray signals with known initial incident and azimuth angles at known transmission times .",
    "receivers receive reflected ray signals and record the time when the signal was received .",
    "the combined data leads to a set of data points @xmath22 where where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the initial incident and azimuth angles of the ray from the transmitter , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 are the coordinates of the transmitter endpoint of the ray , and @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 are the coordinates of the receiver endpoint of the ray , @xmath31 is the time of flight for the signal and @xmath32 is a frequency of the signal .",
    "we present algorithms for the shape and trajectory reconstruction problem for finite travel times and variable speed of sound derived from the equations for the shooting method for two - point seismic ray tracing@xcite .",
    "@xmath33    this system of equations derived from the eikonal equation has wide applications in seismology and is used in algorithms for seismic ray tracing @xcite . the system of equations [ shooting_method_equations ] is for a cartesian coordinate system where @xmath34 is the ray position vector , @xmath35 is the incident angle of the ray direction vector with the z axis and @xmath36 is the azimuth angle that the projection of the ray direction vector makes with the positive x axis .",
    "we consider that the speed of sound @xmath18 is known inside @xmath16 .",
    "we will reconstruct the position of the reflection point @xmath37 given the positions of a transmitter l and receiver s , the incident and azimuth angles of the transmitted ray with respect to a cartesian coordinate system centered at the transmitter , and the time of flight of the signal .",
    "we know the initial position @xmath38 and therefore we know the velocity of the ray at @xmath39 .",
    "we know the angle and initial speed of wave propagation for the transmitted signal at time @xmath39 .",
    "then , knowing the initial conditions , we can find numerically the signal path from the transmitter l through the reflection point p for a given travel time @xmath40 .",
    "let the travel time from the transmitter l to the reflection point p be @xmath40 and the total travel time from the transmitter l to the receiver s through the reflection point p be @xmath31 where @xmath41 .    from symmetry",
    ", we can imagine that the signal received at the receiver s is transmitted from the receiver s and that it arrives at the reflection point p in time @xmath42 because its travel time is @xmath43 .",
    "the ray path from s to p is again described by the above system of equations for seismic ray tracing , however we do not know the initial angles for the signal from the receiver s.    in order to reconstruct the intersection point @xmath44 of rays starting from the transmitter and receiver for a given data point @xmath22 containing the measured values for the signal , we step through a discrete set of values for @xmath40 .",
    "starting to trace a ray path from l , at each time step , each new point on the path is a candidate reflection point p. at this stage , this is basic initial value ray tracing .",
    "then we apply the two point seismic ray tracing shooting method to see if we can reach from receiver s candidate point p for the remainder of our time budget .",
    "if we can then we have found the reflection point p for this data point . otherwise , we continue with the next time step of the initial value ray tracing and check the next candidate point p. we repeat this until we find a reflection point p or exhaust our time budget @xmath31 . for example , let @xmath45 where @xmath46 is an integer that specifies the time - step resolution and @xmath47 is an integer that specifies the number of the time step and such that @xmath48 .",
    "each time @xmath49 corresponds to a unique point @xmath50 on the ray path starting from the transmitter l such that @xmath50 can be reached from @xmath51 in time @xmath49 .",
    "next , for each time step corresponding to time @xmath49 to reach candidate @xmath50 from l , we step through the range of initial angles for the signal starting from the receiver s and check whether the curve from s will intersect @xmath50 in time @xmath52 . alternatively , we can step through a range of reflection angles at the point @xmath50 that is found for the given @xmath49 and check whether the reflected signal will intersect s in time @xmath52 .",
    "the input to the following algorithm is the speed of sound @xmath53 for the domain @xmath16 and a set of data points or ray coordinates corresponding to broken rays .",

    "the above algorithm leads to a class of new algorithms when data structures are used to store the rays for faster processing .",
    "for example , when rays from the receiver in its set of directions are stored and looked up in a data structure such as an array , the performance of the algorithm can be improved to @xmath65 where t is the number of discretization points for the time of flight , and a is the number of discretization points for the angle space .",
    "these algorithms are very suitable for parallelization and their parallelized implementation is key for efficient real - time processing , performance and computational efficiency . for example",
    ", the computation for tracing the rays from the receiver can be parallelized in multiple threads . when the above algorithm is run on a set of points @xmath66 from one sampling time interval @xmath67",
    ", the algorithm reconstructs the shape of the obstacle during this sampling interval . in order to reconstruct the trajectory of the obstacle",
    ", the algorithm is run on the data points for each of the sampling intervals .",
    "the method can achieve high resolution because it can process a very large number of distinct points on the obstacle s boundary .",
    "in contrast to tomography where the focus of the reconstruction method is to recover the velocity structure of the domain , the shape and trajectory reconstruction procedure directly finds the shape and trajectory of the obstacle .",
    "i have developed a multithreaded java program that implements the parallelized algorithm from [ reconstruction_algorithm ] using euler s numerical integration method instead of rk4 and reconstructs the coordinates of reflection points from input data @xmath66 and a speed of sound function @xmath53 .",
    "consider a circular reflecting obstacle in the plane xy moving in the first quadrant away from the origin along the line x = y in a medium with variable speed of sound @xmath68 .",
    "we place a transmitter and a receiver at the origin and set @xmath69 . in this case",
    ", the domain @xmath7 is a circle of sufficiently large radius that contains the origin .",
    "table [ reconstruction_of_a_point_moving_on_the_line_x_y ] shows the computed trajectory of a reflection point on the obstacle on the ray path from the origin x = y , @xmath70 , corresponding to data for different travel times .",
    ".reconstruction of a point moving with speed @xmath68 on the line x = y for a fixed signal frequency @xmath71 .",
    "the initial transmission angles are @xmath72 and @xmath73 [ reconstruction_of_a_point_moving_on_the_line_x_y ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we check the accuracy of the computation in the above table by the java program as follows .",
    "the time for the ray to reach to obstacle can be computed by the formula    @xmath74    therefore , @xmath75    by symmetry , for this particular example , this time t is half of the total travel time t. then for a travel time @xmath76 , or @xmath77 , we compute @xmath78 .",
    "this result matches the corresponding result for px and py from table [ reconstruction_of_a_point_moving_on_the_line_x_y ] obtained by numerical integration . in the current implementation ,",
    "the reconstructed results are more accurate for shorter travel times as can be seen by comparing the result from the table with the result from the above formula [ numerical_example_formula ] for t=8 but this accuracy can be improved by using numerical integration methods with a smaller error .      the reconstruction method [ reconstruction_algorithm ] above finds the reflection point p for the signal from transmitter l to receiver s by finding angles of transmission @xmath79 and @xmath80 for the receiver at which a symmetric signal can be sent to l from s that will reach l over the reverse path of the signal detected at s. therefore , the receiver s can communicate with l by sending a response signal back to l along angles of transmission @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "l will receive this response if the positions of l or s have not changed signigicantly or if the speed of sound has not changed significantly in the region containing the communication paths . in order to create a more robust connection",
    "s can send to l several parallel rays that are very close to each other .",
    "s and l can send and receive acknowledgments and create or use an existing networking protocol stack .",
    "this approach integrates easily with current network protocols and architectures .",
    "s and l recompute the reflection point and transmission angles with the receipt of each message . when s and l receive from each other control messages with high frequency , s and l",
    "recompute a current set of transmission angles for routing back messages .",
    "the frequency of these control messages depends on the velocity of s ,",
    "l and the obstacle , and in the case of time - varying speed of sound , on the time derivative of the speed of sound or on how quickly the speed of sound changes as a function of time .",
    "shape and trajectory tracking of moving obstacles that reflect ray signals sent from moving internet hosts enables efficient one - hop routing through reflection to the nearest internet router or peer .",
    "a router in this architecture is a transmitter and receiver of ray signals .",
    "the architecture is based on a known cartesian global coordinate system .",
    "the physical position , for example , the high precision gps coordinates of the transmitter or receiver correspond to global coordinate system coordinates @xmath81 or @xmath82 from the reconstruction algorithms [ reconstruction_algorithm ] .",
    "we define a new physical layer networking protocol called ihop .",
    "the goal of this protocol is to route messages through the environment in at most one hop .",
    "the ihop address of a host is always relative to the position of another host , a transmitter , and consists of a pair of incident and azimuth angles @xmath79 and @xmath80 for reaching the receiver by sending a ray signal from transmitter to receiver .",
    "the ihop protocol is defined as addressing an ihop host from an ihop transmitter by the host s ihop address or by sending messages from the transmitter to the host along the direction determined by the ihop angles .",
    "a transmitter communicates with a router via the optimal path , the path that takes the least time , for the given speed of sound and reflection point . this network architecture",
    "is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ mobileinternetphonearchitecture ] .",
    "the combination of the methods for obstacle tracking from this work with the numerical methods for tomography in the presence of obstacles from @xcite , leads to a new method for networking with reflected rays based on tracking the location of reflectors and finding the speed of sound in the environment . through reflection",
    ", messages can be communicated around obstacles blocking the line of sight as well as around areas with a high error rate .",
    "the reflectors for the shape and trajectory tracking method do not have to be installed in order to enable a network and can be obstacles such as buildings or cars .",
    "the two initial angles provide a way of addressing the obstacle and the receiver i.e. a way of calling the obstacle and the receiver by dialing two angles of transmission .",
    "the communication path between transmitter and receiver is less prone to eavesdropping because communication is via a narrow ray .",
    "the network architecture described in the previous section enables high bandwidth networking because a receiver can receive information over several rays arriving from different directions .",
    "each ray is an independent communications channel and delivers information in parallel with other rays detected by the receiver .      in order to increase reliability ,",
    "the transmitter can send a message to the receiver along several different rays to several different reflection points .",
    "the receiver could in this case receive the same message from several different rays or directions .",
    "this provides a natural way for error correction and leads to high - performance networking because information from messages that are lost or delayed could be delivered quickly from a different direction .",
    "the fastest message is processed first and this policy improves end - to - end performance .",
    "the communication path is computed to match the speed of sound in the environment and therefore there will be less environmental errors .",
    "for example , the effects of temperature or humidity differences or other weather conditions are included in the computation of the communication path via the function for the speed of sound in the environment .",
    "the reduced error rate will lead to better quality of service .",
    "the architecture is particularly useful for streaming real - time content to home networks or peer - to - peer networks .",
    "the new network architecture makes it easier to connect home network devices via reflected rays compared to the current methods for wireless networking because there is no need for additional routers .",
    "ray signals may reach a host by an unbroken ray or by a broken ray when it reflects from an obstacle . for",
    "improved bandwidth and reliability , we can reach the host over different rays .",
    "the ihop address of the host specifies a ray .",
    "the authors would like to thank professor gregory eskin for his continuous guidance .             to reconstruct the reflection point at obstacle 1 and send back response signals in the direction of this reflection point .",
    "the algorithm from [ reconstruction_algorithm ] enables the reconstruction of the reflection point as well as the arrival angles of the signal at mobile internet phone 2 . ]"
