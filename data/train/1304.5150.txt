    "channel ordering plays an important role in analyzing the asymptotic behavior of iterative coding systems over binary - input memoryless output - symmetric ( bms ) channels .",
    "we say that two bms channels are _ ordered _ by a real - valued parameter , if the `` worse '' channel has a larger parameter than the `` better '' channel .",
    "e.g. , we might consider as a real - valued parameter the bit - error probability , the capacity , or perhaps the battacharyya parameter .",
    "one particularly useful way of imposing an order is to consider the notion of _ degradation _ @xcite .",
    "the main reason that this order is so useful is that many important functionals and kernels ( defined later ) associated with bms channels either preserve or reserve the ordering induced by degradation . in addition , the order of degradation is preserved under many natural operations one might perform on channels .    instead of considering a single bms channel",
    ", we are interested in a family of bms channels sharing certain properties . the cardinality of the family can be either finite or infinite .",
    "a particularly important example for our purpose is the family of bms channels having fixed capacity @xmath0 .",
    "this family is denoted by @xmath1 .",
    "the question we address is the following . given the family of all bms channels of capacity @xmath0 , can we find the `` best '' degraded channel and the `` worst '' upgraded channel with respect to this family .",
    "i.e. , can we find the channel that is degraded with respect to all members in the family and has the highest capacity , as well as the channel that is upgraded with respect to all members of the family and has the lowest capacity .",
    "determining these channels is both natural and fundamental . to mention just one possible application ,",
    "assume that we want to construct a polar code @xcite which works for all channels of a particular capacity .",
    "if we can find a channel which is degraded with respect to all elements in the family then a polar code designed for this channel will work a fortiori for all elements of the original family .",
    "we then say that this polar code is _",
    "universal_. this simple bound is somewhat too crude to construct a good universal polar code .",
    "but we can apply the same argument not to the original family but after a few steps of the polarization process .",
    "the more steps we perform the better the overall code will be ( i.e. , it will have higher capacity ) and the closer we will get to an optimal construction . in what follows we will not be concerned with applications but we will only be interested in describing these two extreme channels given a channel family . as we will see , we will be able to give an explicit answer to the question .",
    "a binary - input memoryless output - symmetric ( bms ) channel has an input @xmath2 taking values over an input alphabet @xmath3 , an output @xmath4 taking values over an output alphabet @xmath5 , and a transition probability @xmath6 for each @xmath7 and @xmath8 . throughout the paper",
    "we take the input alphabet @xmath3 to be @xmath9 and the output alphabet @xmath5 to be a subset of @xmath10 $ ] .",
    "given a bms channel @xmath11 , an alternative description of the channel is the @xmath12-distribution of the random variable @xmath13 a closely related random variable is @xmath14 whose distribution is called a @xmath15-distribution , conditioned on @xmath16 .",
    "moreover , denote by @xmath17 the absolute value of the random variable @xmath15 .",
    "then , the distribution of @xmath17 is termed a @xmath17-distribution and the associated density is called a @xmath17-density . given a bms channel @xmath11 ,",
    "we denote by @xmath18and @xmath19 the associated @xmath17-distribution and @xmath17-density , respectively .",
    "the @xmath17-density of a _ discrete _ bms channels is of the form @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 ; while @xmath23 is the ( dirac ) delta function and @xmath24 is finite or countably infinite .",
    "the _ capacity _ of a bms channel can be defined as a linear functional of its @xmath17-density @xcite .",
    "formally , the capacity @xmath25 in bits per channel use of a bms channel with @xmath15-density @xmath19 is defined as @xmath26 where @xmath27 , for @xmath28 $ ] , and @xmath29 is the _ binary entropy function_. the _ entropy functional _ is defined as @xmath30 , and the entropy of a discrete bms channel is @xmath31 .",
    "another important functional is the _ battacharyya parameter _ associated with the @xmath17-density @xmath19 .",
    "it is defined as @xmath32 if a bms channel has a @xmath17-density of the form in ( [ equ - abs - d - density ] ) , the battacharyya parameter is given by @xmath33 .",

    "let @xmath3 be the common input alphabet , and denote by @xmath5 and @xmath36 the output alphabets , respectively .",
    "we say that @xmath35 is _",
    "( stochastically ) degraded _ with respect to @xmath11 if there exists a memoryless channel with transition probability @xmath37 such that @xmath38 for all @xmath39 and all @xmath40 .",
    "conversely , the channel @xmath11 is said to be _ ( stochastically ) upgraded _ with respect to the channel @xmath35 .",
    "the following lemma gives an equivalent characterization of degradedness and upgradedness @xcite .",
    "[ lemma - degrad ] consider two bms channels @xmath11 and @xmath35 with the corresponding @xmath17-distributions @xmath18 and @xmath41 , respectively .",

    "now recall that the entropy functional @xmath48 associated with the @xmath17-density @xmath19 has @xmath49 as its kernel in the @xmath17-domain .",
    "this kernel is non - increasing and convex-@xmath44 on @xmath45 $ ] , and therefore condition ( ii ) in lemma [ lemma - degrad ] shows that a degraded channel has a larger entropy , and thus lower capacity , than the original channel .",
    "similarly , a degraded channel has a larger probability of error and larger battacharyya parameter than the original channel .",
    "note that there are many equivalent definitions for the _ least degraded _ channel .",
    "one particularly insightful characterization is that the least degraded channel is the unique channel which is degraded with respect to all elements of the family @xmath1 and is upgraded with respect to any other such channel .",
    "therefore it has the highest capacity , lowest error probability and lowest battacharyya parameter .",
    "the integral of @xmath50 from @xmath51 to @xmath52 , as suggested by lemma [ lemma - degrad ] , is important for characterizing degradedness among bms channels .",
    "therefore , for a bms channel @xmath11 , define @xmath53 note that @xmath54 is decreasing on @xmath45 $ ] , and since @xmath50 is increasing in @xmath55 , it follows that @xmath54 is a convex-@xmath44 function of @xmath51 .",
    "moreover , if the bms channel @xmath11 is discrete , the function @xmath54 has a simpler form given by @xmath56    condition ( iii ) of lemma [ lemma - degrad ] shows that , in order to find the least degraded channel with respect to @xmath1 , we take the maximum value of @xmath54 among all bms channels @xmath57 , for each fixed @xmath47 $ ] .",

    "canceling @xmath73 on both sides of ( [ equ - h - mass ] ) and using the fact that @xmath77 is decreasing and convex-@xmath44 on @xmath45 $ ] , we have @xmath83 which is equivalent to @xmath84 . now notice that , since @xmath85 , the term corresponding to @xmath80 that contributes to @xmath86 is equal to @xmath87 .",

    "the _ least upgraded _ channel is the unique channel which is upgraded with respect to to all elements of the family @xmath1 and is degraded with respect to any other such channel .",
