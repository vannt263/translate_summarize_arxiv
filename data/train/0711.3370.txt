    "scanning probe microscopy ( spm ) is nowadays an essential technique to measure local electronic properties of mesoscopic structures .",
    "scanning tunnel microscopy ( stm ) , consisting in probing the sample surface with a metallic tip , is the most popular among all spm techniques .",
    "stm experiments have first enabled the detection of standing wave pattern in confined surface electron systems such as quantum corrals.@xcite the physical interpretation of such images is immediate since they derive from direct tunneling between the surface electrons and the tip .",
    "hence , stm images represent the density of states of the system at a given position of the scanning probe.@xcite    later on , another spm technique , named scanning gate microscopy ( sgm ) , has been introduced in order to obtain similar information for structures buried under an insulating layer .",
    "this technique consists in scanning a biased tip over the sample surface .",
    "the gate acts as a local electrostatic ( repulsive or attractive ) potential on the electronic system and allows to obtain two - dimensional ( 2d ) conductance ( or resistance ) images of the scanned area as a function of the tip position . at the present time ,",
    "sgm or an alternative technique called scanning capacitance microscopy ( scm ) have been adopted to investigate the physics of quantum points contacts,@xcite quantum dots,@xcite carbon nanotubes,@xcite open billiards@xcite and edge states in the integer quantum hall regime.@xcite sgm on inas nanowires has evidenced the presence of multiple quantum dots inside the structure corresponding to circular coulomb blockade peaks in the conductance plots.@xcite    from a theoretical point of view , numerical simulations based on the keldysh - green s functions formalism have been exploited to demonstrate wavefunction imaging in open quantum dots@xcite and to associate conductance images to electron flow in quantum point contacts.@xcite    recently , isophase lines for electrons in an electrostatic aharonov - bohm ( ab ) experiment@xcite and local - density - of - states ( ldos ) mapping inside a coherent ab ring@xcite have been reported . in the latter work ,",
    "both experimental curves and numerical simulations have found a linear dependence of the conductance variation on the tip voltage .",
    "interestingly , clear wavefunction images were obtained only in this case,@xcite suggesting to limit the imaging technique to the linear - response regime .",
    "it was also noticed that the simulated conductance maps were not significantly influenced by the particular shape adopted to mimic the effective perturbing potential due to the scanning gate .",
    "since sgm is essentially an indirect measurement of the 2d electron gas ( 2deg ) properties , a physical interpretation of conductance images is not immediate .",
    "therefore , in this paper we try to clarify the physical meaning of sgm experiments and isolate the experimental conditions under which the linear response - regime holds .",
    "in section [ s2 ] we present an analytical model which provides a simple physical interpretation of the sgm conductance images in the single - channel transmission regime .",
    "we find that the conductance correction due to the scanning tip is related to the hilbert transform of the local density of states ( ldos ) of the system .",
    "moreover , we analyze the spatial and energetic conditions on the perturbing potential under which this direct relation is maintained .    in section [ s3 ]",
    "we present 2d numerical simulations of a realistic quantum ring characterized by the presence of randomly localized impurities .",
    "our calculations are based on a recursive green s functions method and illustrate the correspondence between ldos and conductance images of the system in such a complex case .",
    "in particular , we address the interesting case for which the wavefunction of the system is dominated by localized states due to charged impurities or by recursive semi - classical orbits .",
    "section [ s4 ] summarizes the relevant results .",
    "in this section , we evaluate the effect of a local perturbation on the total transmission of a non - interacting system connected to single - channel leads .",
    "we adopt the landauer - bttiker transport theory assuming the zero ",
    "temperature limit.@xcite    we consider a multi - states system connected to one - dimensional ( 1d ) leads and neglect the effect of inelastic scattering and electron - electron interactions .",
    "these assumptions are valid in the case of low - temperature experiments on mesoscopic samples working in the phase coherent transport regime.@xcite we model our system as a chain of @xmath1 sites with the @xmath2-th on - site potential @xmath3 coupled to two semi - infinite reservoirs with fixed chemical potentials . the coupling strength with the left and the right reservoir is denoted by @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the coupling with the leads and @xmath6 is the density of states of the reservoirs , respectively .",
    "moreover , each site is coupled only to its nearest neighbor with coupling constant @xmath7 , which for simplicity we assume not to depend on the position .    since the linear conductance of a system with fermi energy @xmath8",
    "is determined by the propagator from site 1 to site @xmath1 , we simply need to evaluate the element @xmath9 of the retarded green s function of the system @xmath10 . by adopting the common assumption of a large band - width coupling with the reservoirs",

    "( [ trans ] ) as @xmath25 where the index @xmath2 can have any value between 1 and @xmath1 .",
    "further , since we are interested in studying the stationary regime of transport , it is convenient to write the green s functions in the energy space representation by performing a fourier transform .",
    "we have @xmath26^{-1}$ ] and @xmath27^{-1}=[(g^{\\rm r}_{i , i})^{-1}-\\lambda_i+i\\gamma_i]^{-1}$ ] , where @xmath28 is a positive infinitesimal number , @xmath29 is the self - energy including the interactions with the system on the local @xmath30th green s function.@xcite    we now consider the effect on the transmission of a local perturbing potential which can be physically associated with the action of a charged tip scanning the system . we mimic the effect of the charged tip at position @xmath14 as a renormalization of the on - site energy @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the perturbing potential . assuming that the potential strength is sufficiently `` weak '' , the conductance correction is linear in @xmath32 and reads @xmath33 .",
    "\\label{corr}\\ ] ]    by comparing eq .",
    "( [ corr ] ) with eq .",
    "( [ ldos ] ) we find that the conductance variation due to the action of a local perturbing potential and the ldos are related in the same way as the real and the imaginary part of the green s function @xmath34 , namely by a kramers - kronig relation .",
    "mathematically , this is expressed in terms of the hilbert transform @xmath35= { \\cal h } \\ { { \\rm i m } \\left [ g_{i , i}^{\\rm r } ( \\omega ) \\right ] \\ } = \\frac{1}{\\pi } { \\cal p } \\int d\\omega ' \\frac{1}{\\omega-\\omega'}{\\rm i m } \\left [ g_{i , i}^{\\rm r}(\\omega')\\right]$ ] , where @xmath36 stands for the cauchy principal part .",
    "therefore , in the linear - response regime , the conductance ( transmission ) correction is proportional to the hilbert transform of the local density of states .",
    "notice that the sign of the conductance correction is determined by both the perturbing potential @xmath32 and by the relative position of the fermi energy with respect to @xmath37 .",
    "the physical origin of such a relationship can be understood by noticing that the main effect of the local perturbing potential @xmath32 is to renormalize the real part of the self - energy .    by analyzing eq .",
    "( [ corr ] ) we can deduce the conditions of validity of the ldos-@xmath0 correspondence . in order to deal with a `` weak '' perturbation giving rise to a linear correction",
    "the condition @xmath38 has to hold . a condition on the extension of the perturbing potential",
    "is given by the spatial periodicity of the wavefunction and limits the spatial range of the effective potential below the half - fermi wavelength @xmath39 .",
    "nevertheless , notice that in the multichannel transmission case that we discuss in section [ s3 ] , the spatial periodicity of the ldos can be larger than @xmath39 .",
    "interestingly , in the single - channel transmission regime the ldos is usually a sinusoidal function of the spatial coordinate , whereas the hilbert transform of such a function alters the original function by only a @xmath40 phase shift .",
    "more precisely , we have that the hilbert transform adds a @xmath41 phase for right - going states and @xmath42 for left - going states .",
    "this justifies the use of a scanning local perturbation , like that obtained with sgm experiments , as an efficient tool to image the ldos of the system .       for a double - barrier system .",

    "[ figure1 ] we show the ldos of the unperturbed system and the conductance correction due to a scanning potential acting as a local scatterer .",
    "the conductance is computed by means of eq .",
    "( [ trans ] ) after numerical calculation of the total green s function .",
    "the local perturbing potential is assumed to be a rectangular - shaped barrier with height @xmath49 ( or @xmath50 ) and width @xmath48 nm smaller than @xmath51 nm .",
    "let us discuss the @xmath0-ldos correspondence separately for the two regions inside and outside the two barriers .",

    "the effect of the local scatterer is different in the spatial region outside the two barriers . on the left ( right ) of the barriers",

    ".    since both energies are close each other , the mapped conductances are very similar and differ only for having opposite signs in complete agreement with eq .",
    "( [ corr ] ) .",
    "here , we want to emphasize that , even if the correct potential shape of the perturbing potential should be obtained by computing the electrostatics of the total system , still the conductance variation does not depend on the particular shape of the potential in the linear - response regime under study.@xcite    concerning the effect of an asymmetric tip - induced potential we observe that the small asymmetry in figs .",

    "we conclude that the effect of an asymmetric potential can be minimized by providing a tip - induced perturbation with limited spatial extension .",
    "in this section we extend the results obtained for the single - channel transmission to the case the conductance is the sum of several independent channels as expressed by the landauer - bttiker formula @xmath93 , where @xmath94 is the transmission probability of the @xmath95-th conducting transverse mode .",
    "this is the most common experimental situation .",
    "@xcite in particular , we want to verify whenever the ldos-@xmath0 correspondence depicted in section [ s2 ] is valid for realistic 2d structures .",
    "a first complication arises from the spatial resolution of the scanning tip . indeed ,",
    "in the multi - channel transmission case the ldos structure is usually very complex and presents a spatial periodicity related to half the fermi wavelength , whereas in experiments the extension of the perturbing potential is typically larger than @xmath39 .",
    "thus , one can expect that the spatial resolution of the tip - induced potential is smaller than the spatial extension of conducting modes related to lowest energies , but larger than those related to highest energies .",
    "this would lead to properly take into account only conducting modes corresponding to the lowest energies and lose a satisfactory correspondence with the ldos .",
    "another problem concerns the interpretation of conductance maps in terms of hilbert transform of the ldos .",
    "generally , in the multi - channel transmission case it is not possible to obtain a direct correspondence like in eq .",
    "( [ corr ] ) or ( [ res ] ) since the effect of the local perturbing potential due to the scanning tip is different for each conducting channels contributing to the conductance .",
    "however , it often occurs that the ldos and hence the conductance are dominated by one or few close transverse modes . in these specific cases the same ldos-@xmath0 correspondence for the one - channel case",
    "is recovered provided that the conditions found in section [ s2 ] are valid .",
    "this means that the spatial extension of the tip - induced potential has to be smaller than the spatial periodicity of the dominant channel _ and _ the potential height @xmath87 has to be smaller than the corresponding energy level .",
    "2.5 v and ( b ) averaged conductance variation @xmath96 as a function of the tip voltage @xmath97 measured in different device regions indicated in ( a ) . a clear linear dependence is present only in the region i inside the ring .",
    "the 2deg distance of the tip is @xmath98= 50 nm , @xmath99 k and a magnetic field of @xmath100 t is applied perpendicularly to the surface.,width=307 ]    from an experimental point of view we demonstrate the feasibility of the linear - response regime in fig .  [",
    "figure3](b ) , where an averaged conductance variation as a function of the tip voltage is shown for a coherent quantum ring .",
    "this is fabricated from a ingaas / inalas heterostructure using electron beam lithography and wet etching .",
    "the 2deg is located 25 nm below the surface , and its low temperature ( @xmath59 ) electron density and mobility are @xmath101 m@xmath102 and 10 m@xmath103/vs , respectively .",
    "the ring inner and outer ( lithographic ) radii are 120 nm and 290 nm ( this sample is the same as sample r1 in ref .  ) .",
    "notice that a clear linear dependence on the tip voltage is experimentally found only if the tip scans the region i inside the ring , where the former conditions are expected to hold .    in summary ,",
    "specific situations exist such that the total wavefunction of the system adopts a simple and regular shape and the conditions for a satisfactory ldos-@xmath0 correspondence are recovered . in the following of this section we give a few relevant examples and illustrate them with experimental data and numerical simulations .",
    "we first focus on a realistic ab ring with the same sizes as the one studied in section [ s2 ] , but with a random distribution of symmetry - breaking defects .",
    "these defects are probably responsible for the asymmetric conductance images in ref .  , where the wavefunction inside the ring is strongly influenced by localized states . in fig .",
