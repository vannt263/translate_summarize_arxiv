    "the radiative lepton flavor violating ( lfv ) decays exist at least at one loop level and they are rich from the theoretical point of view since the measurable quantities of these decays contain number of free parameters of the model used . in framework of the standard model ( sm ) ,",
    "these lfv decays are forbidden and , by introducing the neutrino mixing with the non zero neutrino masses , the lfv decays are allowed . however , their branching ratios ( brs ) are tiny and much below the experimental limits due to the smallness of neutrino masses .",
