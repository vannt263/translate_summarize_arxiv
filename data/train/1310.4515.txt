    "while the @xmath80 calculated for the flare on sdssj0221 is slightly larger , its uncertainties due to the estimation of the flare shape and the use of scaling relations are likely to be an order of magnitude . extrapolating the flare frequency distributions of @xcite to @xmath83 ergs , flares this large should occur on active mid - m dwarfs monthly , and active late - m dwarfs once per year .      at optical and uv wavelengths , flare emission originates from two components .",

    "the large range of continuum emission in the @xmath6 band during the quiescent phase is due to the faintness of the blackbody compared to the line emission and stellar flux ; in a large flare , the blackbody is likely to remain strong even during the decay phase .",

    "the resulting model spectra are shown in figure  [ fig : flarespec ] , both with the blackbody modeled as the only contribution to the flare @xmath6-band flux and scaled so that the blackbody contributes 95% during the impulsive phase and 50% during the gradual phase .",

    "those filling factors correspond to a physical area of ( 28 ) @xmath105 @xmath106 on an object this size , while the largest of the mid - m dwarf flares with detected peaks @xcite have flare surface areas of @xmath107@xmath108 @xmath106 ( 0.050.2% of a r = 0.35r@xmath94 star ) . during the gradual phase , a @xmath109 or @xmath110  k",

    "stars with dramatic flares are typically assumed to be young , but with the break down of the age - activity relation @xcite and the persistence of quiescent activity in late - m dwarfs for @xmath18 gyr @xcite , it is possible that ultracool dwarfs can have large flares even at typical thin disk ages .    the @xmath112 erg estimate of the energy released is comparable to the highest energies calculated for mid - m dwarf flares @xcite .",
