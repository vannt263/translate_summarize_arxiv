    "there has since been some debate as to whether the former result might have been caused by a dynamically warmer thick disk component @xcite and the latter might have been affected by the misidentification of faint blue extra - galactic sources ( @xcite , also see @xcite for a complete review ) .",

    "the grapes spectra of these sources were examined and a main - sequence star was selected ( uid 911 ) .",
    "the curves of growth of this object were measured separately in the  and  bands and were used to compute @xmath14 and @xmath15 values for all objects in the hudf .",
    "a new set of bright point sources , well distributed over the whole acs field , were then carefully selected based on their low @xmath14 values ( arbitrarily chosen to be @xmath16 ) .",

    "stamp images of these objects were individually drizzled @xcite and carefully re - centered to produce a stack of images which were then combined together to produce empirical  and   psf images .",
    "a sigma - based rejection algorithm was used to avoid the effect of any faint neighbor in the final combined images .",
    "final  and  band reference curves of growth were generated using these empirical psf estimates and all of the @xmath14 and @xmath15 values were re - computed .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the distributions of the values in both the  and  bands , as a function of magnitude .",
    "there are clearly two distinct groups of object in the hudf images : one group consists of object that are completely or partially resolved , forming a large distribution around the value of 0.2 and @xmath17 mag .",
    "a second group consists of unresolved objects with low values at all magnitudes .",
    "bright stars in figure [ fig1 ] are observed to have values which are consistently lower than 0.05 .",

    "four bright saturated stars were added to the final object list manually .",
    "the final list of unresolved udf sources contains objects , spanning the magnitude ranges of @xmath22 mag and @xmath23 mag .",
    "table [ table1 ] summarizes some of the properties of these objects .      the ability to distinguish between resolved and unresolved objects using values was extensively tested , using a subset of the hudf object catalog containing the 369 brightest ( @xmath24 mag ) objects in the field .",
    "simulated  and  band images of these objects  made 0.0 , 0.75 , 2.0 , 3.0 , 4.0 , 5.0 , 6.0 , 7.0 , 8.0 , and 9.0 magnitudes fainter  were created and values measured using each simulated image , exactly as described in section [ sindexsec ] .",
    "the value of each of these 369 test objects was thus measured 10 times , each measurement corresponding to a different apparent magnitude .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows how the value remains largely unchanged as an object is made fainter and noisier , all the way down to @xmath25 mag . the vertical pattern seen in this figure is a result of the 10 magnitude steps used in this simulation .",
    "this test demonstrates a very small fraction of misclassification : not a single extended object was misclassified as a star ( e.g. no object with @xmath26 originally in the hudf images was measured to have @xmath27 as the object was made fainter ) , and fewer than 5% of stars were misclassified down to @xmath25 mag . while some objects shown in table [ table1 ] are fainter than this , only objects significantly brighter than this limit ( @xmath28 mag ) are actually included in the analysis described below and these are expected to be bona fide unresolved objects .      some of the stars in the hudf objects could have a high tangential - velocity ( @xmath29 ) and a correspondingly large proper motion .",
    "such objects would be blurred in the combined hudf images and would appear to be resolved .",
    "similarly , nearby objects would suffer from a significant amount of parallax , again causing these objects to be blurred and mis - identified .",
    "the index proved relatively insensitive to a small amount of object motion .",
    "this is not unexpected since was tuned to the detection of faint extended components , the curves of growth produced by radprof were computed by summing , using several sigma rejection steps , the pixel intensities inside annuli of increasing radii .",
    "the effect of a nearby source is strongly diminished as its separation from the main source increases and the number of unaffected pixels increases .",
    "in addition , the use of a fifth order spline imposes some smoothness on the curve of growth which further lowers the effect of a nearby object .",
    "still , the effect of object motion on measured values of was carefully investigated by generating images of the unresolved hudf objects that were selected as described in section [ sindexsec ] .",
    "these were appropriately shift - and - added , accounting for the orientation and pointing used for each individual hudf observation while allowing objects to move as a function of time , to simulate the effect of proper motion .",
    "as larger values of proper motion were introduced , the values increased only slightly and was found to be mostly unaffected by shifts smaller than 2.5 hudf pixel ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "70% of objects were still properly identified as point sources when shifts 2.5 and 5.0 hudf pixels were applied ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "the spectral type of unresolved objects brighter than @xmath1 could be determined robustly using template fitting of their grapes spectra @xcite .",
    "the template set included @xcite main - sequence templates , l and t dwarf spectra @xcite , da and db white dwarf spectra @xcite obtained from the sdss archive , and some low temperature ( 3000k , 5000k , and 8000k ) model spectra of white dwarfs @xcite .",
    "the quality of each spectral fit was evaluated visually and the results of these fits are given in table [ table2 ] .",
    "objects too faint to have reliable fits are indicated .",
    "the grapes spectra and the two best - fits listed in table [ table2 ] are shown in figures [ all1 ] , [ all2 ] , and [ all3 ] .",
    "unresolved extra - galactic sources are labelled as gal in table [ table2 ] and are discussed in more details in section [ qso ] .",
    "+ of the point sources detected in the hudf , stars , all brighter than @xmath1 mag were identified . as shown in table [ table2 ] , the majority of stars in the hudf ( out of ) are found to be m dwarfs .",
    "figures [ vbv ] and [ ivi ] show these objects in  vs. -  and vs. -  plots .",
    "such plots have in the past shown a lack of faint red objects in the region @xmath32 mag and @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "objects found in this region of the plot , appear to be either extra - galactic or l - type dwarf spectra ( uid 443 , 366 ) .",
    "further nir observations will be required to verify the nature of these 2 l - dwarf candidates by confirming that they both have the expected blue nir colors of this type of object . + the hudf field is at high galactic latitude ( b=223 , l=54 ) and the effects of extinction and reddening are small ( @xmath34 , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the distances to the hudf stars , which are shown in table [ table2 ] , were determined using their observed  magnitudes , their estimated stellar types , and the dwarf star main - sequence absolute johnson v magnitudes from @xcite .",
    "the latter were converted to the  filter bandpass and ab magnitudes to be consistent with the data at hand .",
    "distance estimates obtained under the assumption that these objects are white dwarfs with intrinsic magnitudes of @xmath35 are also given .",
    "the galactic halo is isotropic and has no or little overall rotation .",
    "halo objects are therefore expected to lag behind the rapidly rotating galactic disk component ( and the local standard of rest ) with an average velocity of @xmath36 .",

    "no such object was found .",
    "+ the motion of objects in the hudf was further investigated by carefully measuring the position of objects separately in each of the eight available  band hudf partial image stacks .",
    "these positions were measured using the idl task mpfit2dpeak , using a fixed width ( fwhm=2.5 pixel ) gaussian fit .",
    "initially , the positions of the most compact sources ( @xmath40 and @xmath41 mag ) were examined .",
    "an average position and a standard deviation of the mean were computed for each object in the field using epoch 1 and epoch 2 hudf image stacks separately .",
    "average epoch 1 and epoch 2 positions were subtracted from one another to compute the observed shift of each object . these are shown ( scaled up by a factor of 500 ) in the left panel of figure [ figpm ] . repeated measurements of the position of sources in the field using hudf image stacks taken within the same epoch",
    "were always within 0.1 hudf pixel , or 0.003  .",
    "still , and as shown in figure [ figpm ] , there is a systematic , field dependent disagreement between the epoch 1 and epoch 2 measurements .",
    "this is likely caused by epoch 1 and epoch 2 images having been taken at position angles that are 90  apart , and/or the effect of telescope breathing , and/or very small amount of residual image distortion that is not taken into account in the current model of the acs distortion maps . to produce a @xmath4 detection with these data ,",
    "an object must have a measured proper motion larger than 0.54 hudf pixel or @xmath42 .",
    "no object in table [ table1 ] was observed to have such a large proper motion .",
    "+ the situation was however improved using a simple third order two dimensional polynomial fit to the observed distribution shown in the left panel of figure [ figpm ] .",
    "this fit , when applied as a correction , results in significantly lower systematics across the field , as shown in the right panel of figure [ figpm ] .",
    "the accuracy of the corrected shifts ( of compact objects ) between epoch 1 and epoch 2 is improved by a factor of 3 , with a @xmath4 detection now corresponding to a shift of 0.18 hudf pixel or @xmath43 .",
    "+ the search for high proper motion objects in the hudf was extended to all objects in the field by measuring and correcting ( using the correction determined above ) the observed shifts of these objects .",
    "only four sources were found to have moved significantly ( but with a significance slightly lower than @xmath4 ) from epoch 1 to epoch 2 .",
    "these objects are uid 443 , 9020 , 911 , and 7525 and they are all unresolved objects that are listed in table [ table1 ] .",
    "their measured shifts are 0.17 , 0.17 , 0.14 , and 0.15 hudf pixels respectively , or approximately 0.02/year , which is smaller than our imposed @xmath4 limit .      two unresolved , extra - galactic sources with @xmath28 were identified ( uid 6732 , 9397 ) .",
    "the grapes spectrum of these objects show prominent emission lines and the redshift of these objects is estimated to be z=3.2 and z=3.0 , respectively @xcite .",
    "identification of such objects using grapes spectra could easily be carried out down to magnitudes fainter than = 27.0 mag , as demonstrated by the fact that several fainter extragalactic objects with @xmath44 were easily identified ( e.g. uid 4120 , 8157 ) . without spectral information ,",
    "these objects would have been misidentified as stars ( e.g. uid 9397 would be a good candidate for a cool white dwarf at a distance of @xmath45 1 kpc ) .",
    "the issue of contamination by faint , blue extra - galactic objects in previous studies @xcite has been discussed in the past @xcite and figures [ vbv ] and [ ivi ] illustrate how these objects could be mistaken for a variety of stellar objects ranging from m and l dwarfs to white dwarfs .",
    "spectroscopic confirmation is therefore crucial to accurately determine stellar counts in deep fields such as the hudf .",

    "+ the extra - galactic objects ( uid 6732 , 9397 ) were used to check the accuracy of the proper motion measurements described in section [ pm ] .",
    "the measured shifts of these objects between epoch 1 and epoch 2 are smaller than 0.04 hudf pixel ( 0.0012  ) , which is what one would expect based on the proper motion error estimate quoted in section [ pm ] ) .",
    "+ there are a total of 14 faint ( @xmath44 ) , blue ( @xmath46 , @xmath47 ) objects listed in table [ table1 ] that were not included in the analysis above because they are either too faint to have useable grapes spectra or robust based classifications .",
    "some of these sources might well be faint white dwarfs in either the galactic disk or halo but are hard to distinguish from extra - galactic sources without higher signal - to - noise spectra or more accurate proper motion measurements .",
    "objects were identified to be m ( or early l ) dwarf main - sequence stars .",
    "two objects were found to be best fit by early l dwarf templates @xcite . both of these objects are red enough to be outside of the color range shown in figures [ vibv ] and [ izvi ] with @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "deep infrared observations of these two objects will be required to confirm that they are l dwarfs .",
    "nicmos observations of the hudf did not detect these objects in either the j or h bands .",
    "all other very red objects are best fit using m dwarf templates .",
    "the broad spectral features of m dwarfs listed in table [ table2 ] were well fitted using m dwarf @xcite templates , and for objects brighter than @xmath1 mag we believe the identification to be secure .",
    "+ because these late - type sources can be seen to great distances , they can be used to probe the structure of the galactic disk and halo as traced by the lowest - mass stellar components of these populations .",

    "assuming power - law representations of the mf , dn / dm @xmath50 m@xmath51 , for masses 0.005 to 0.2 m@xmath52 , luminosity ( lf ) and effective temperature ( t@xmath53 ) distributions were created using evolutionary models from @xcite over the range 100 @xmath54 t@xmath53 @xmath54 4000 k. for all simulations , @xmath55 was fixed at 1.13 for @xmath56 @xcite but allowed to vary between 0.51.5 for @xmath57 ; number densities are normalized to the empirical value at 0.1 m@xmath52 from the 8 pc sample @xcite .",
    "two separate populations were simulated : a disk population with a flat age distribution spanning 10 myr to 10 gyr ( the majority of sources have age greater than 1 gyr ) , and a halo population with uniformly sampled ages between 9 - 10 gyr and a relative number density of 0.25% @xcite .",
    "the resulting bolometric lfs were converted to @xmath58 ( cousins ) lf s using a polynomial fit to empirical data ( spanning @xmath59 ; i.e. , m4 to t8 ) from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "note that this fit is based on measurements for solar metallicity field dwarfs , and may not be appropriate for a subsolar metallicity halo subdwarf population .",
    "apparent @xmath58-band distributions were determined by first assuming a constant density population out to a limiting magnitude m@xmath60 = 27.5 ( taking into account the difference between hudf ab - magnitudes and vega magnitudes from the empirical data ) and then applying a correction for the vertical distribution of sources . for the disk population , we assumed a density distribution @xmath61 @xcite , where @xmath62 , @xmath63 is the source distance , @xmath64 is the galactic latitude of the hudf , and @xmath65 is the 1/e disk scale height , assumed to range between 200 and 500 pc . for the halo population ,",

    "figure [ mlf2 ] presents the results of these simulations in the form of cumulative number distributions as a function of  magnitude down to the limiting magnitude of our sample .",
    "these distributions show that variations in the disk scale height are far more pronounced than those from the different mf s assumed , and this analysis is limited to the former parameter .",
    "the cumulative distribution of the six dwarfs in table [ table2 ] with spectral types m4 and later ( consistent with the mass constraints of the simulations ) is also shown .",
    "the observed distribution matches that of the @xmath66 disk simulation very well , particularly out to @xmath67 mag where the halo population makes negligible contribution .",
    "because the simulated distributions are rather sensitive to the disk scale height , particularly at fainter apparent magnitudes , one can conservatively constrain @xmath65 to @xmath68100 pc assuming poisson uncertainties .",
    "this is in good agreement with the estimate of @xmath69 from @xcite which was computed using acs hudf parallel fields i - drops . for @xmath70 mag ,",
    "the observed distribution is slightly greater than the disk population alone but does not increase as sharply as the combined disk+halo distribution .",
    "indeed , the shape of the observed number distribution implies few if any halo stars in the hudf down to @xmath7 mag , consistent with the lack of significant proper motion sources in this sample .",
    "this suggests that either the number density ratio of halo to disk stars , or the adopted axial ratio for the halo density distribution , or both , may be smaller than assumed here .",
    "with no late - type halo subdwarf detections in this sample , we can not usefully constrain these possibilities .",
    "objects brighter than @xmath7 were individually examined and distances were estimated under various assumptions of what the exact nature of each object might be : ( 1 ) a main sequence star ; ( 2 ) a young white dwarf ; ( 3 ) an old white dwarf .",
    "the reddest objects , which are all well - fitted by m - and - later type templates , as well as the few extra - galactic objects identified in section [ qso ] were excluded from this analysis .",
    "the remaining objects were all initially considered to potentially be white dwarfs .",
    "+ assuming that an object is a white dwarf , one can use the measured @xmath71 color of that object ( table [ table1 ] ) and the cooling curves of @xcite ( after accounting for passbands and zeropoints differences ) , to derive an absolute  band magnitude , an age , and a distance to that object . as shown in figure 2 of @xcite , blue white dwarfs",
    "can either be young , hot objects ( @xmath72 , t @xmath73k , @xmath74 mag ) or older , cooler , intrinsically dimmer ones ( age @xmath75 10 gyr , t @xmath76 , @xmath77 mag ) .",
    "this results in several white dwarf distance estimates for each object . + proceeding via a process of elimination , the distinction between main sequence stars , young white dwarfs , old white dwarfs , and disk or halo white dwarfs is possible . assuming that a star is a main sequence star , which is intrinsically much more luminous than a white dwarf ,",
    "can cause the distance estimate for that object to be unreasonably large . assuming that a star is a young white dwarf ( @xmath78 ) implies that this object is less likely to be part of the galactic halo since the latter is composed of much older objects . also , and based on the lack of proper motion detection discussed in section [ pmm ] , one can define an upper limit to the tangential velocity ( @xmath79 ) of each object once its distance is determined .",
    "the motion of an object moving by more than 0.18 hudf pixel ( 0.027  / yr ) should have been detected at the @xmath4 significance level as discussed in section [ pm ] . as discussed above , objects in the galactic halo are expected to have velocities around 100 - 200 km / s . even if projection effects should result in lower values of @xmath80",
    ", one would expect at least some of them to have @xmath80 values larger than 30 - 60 km / s .",
    "a final clue to help narrow down the nature of a particular object is provided by the fact that an object that is nearby would suffer from a significant , easily measurable , parallax during the 73 days interval between epoch 1 and epoch 2 observations . calculating the parallax vector for the hudf exposures shows that an object 30 pc away would produce a parallax of about 0.060  or 2 hudf pixel between epoch 1 and epoch 2 observations .",
    "objects that are closer than 200 pc are therefore expected to produce a parallax that would be detected at more than @xmath4 level . + examining table [ table4 ] , objects 4322 , 4839 , 7768 , 9020 are unlikely to be main - sequence stars as this would make them very distant objects .",
    "the magellanic stream @xcite is too far away from the hudf to possibly explain the existence of main - sequence stars at such large distances .",
    "objects 1147 , 3166 , and 5921 which do not ( this is true of all objects listed in table [ table4 ] ) have measurable parallax or proper motion , are not likely to be white dwarfs .",
    "being either young or old white dwarfs would place these two objects less than 200 pc away and would have resulted in measurable parallax in the hudf image stacks .",
    "another object unlikely to be a white dwarf is object 9230 which was observed to have a fainter , unresolved companion 0.5  away .",
    "this companion , for which we have no grapes spectrum , has a  band magnitude of @xmath81 mag and the colors @xmath82 mag .",

    "the likelihood of any two stars being within 0.5  in the hudf , and at nearly the same distance , is very small ( @xmath84 ) and these two objects are likely to be part of a binary system , with object 9230 being a k type main - sequence star . independently of this ,",
    "object 9230 can not be an old white dwarf since this would place this object at distance of 34 pc where its parallax motion would have been very easily detected .",
    "+      four objects ( 4322 , 4839 , 7768 , 9020 ) remain as white dwarf candidates . using a simple 1/@xmath85 @xcite analysis , the white dwarf number density in the direction of the hudf can be computed .",
    "the detection of 4 white dwarfs in the hudf implies a local density of @xmath86 .",
    "the upper and lower limits on the density are computed using old or young white dwarfs respectively , while the errors reflect the large uncertainties in the intrinsic luminosities of young and old white dwarfs ( @xmath87 mag ) .",
    "note that this estimate is actually not affected by whether or not object 9230 was included as a hudf white dwarf .",
    "the contribution of this object to the 1/@xmath85 is negligible .",
    "for comparison , @xcite previously determined the local white dwarf density to be @xmath88 , while @xcite found a value of @xmath89 , and @xcite derived a density of white dwarfs in the thick disk of @xmath90 .",
    "the white dwarf density derived here is consistent with most of the previous density estimates . properly determining the disk and halo membership of the 4 white dwarfs identified in the hudf will be needed before a stronger conclusion can be made .",
    "re - observing the hudf field in the  band in 1.5 years would allow ( assuming that a 0.18 hudf pixel shift corresponds to a @xmath4 level detection ) one to unambiguously detect the proper motion of halo white dwarfs with @xmath91 km / s at distances up to 1000 pc .",
    "+ the above density estimate assumed that all four hudf white dwarfs were galactic disk objects .",
    "could some of these objects be in the galactic halo ?",
    "at least two of these objects ( 4839 , 7768 ) have @xmath92 values that are lower than 60 km / s .",
    "the probability that this is caused by a projection effect is under 10% ( assuming a relatively low velocity of @xmath93 km / s for halo objects ) .",
    "the last two white dwarfs listed in table [ table4 ] ( 4322 , 9020 ) are at slightly larger distances which average to 583 pc , and more importantly have larger values of @xmath92 .",
    "the average distance of these objects still seems a bit low for objects which would be part of a galactic halo whose density increases all the way up to 7 kpc @xcite , while white dwarfs with absolute magnitudes of @xmath94 mag @xcite should be detected all the way out to 1000 pc .",
    "unless these objects are intrinsically much dimmer , one would expect the average distance to these two objects to be larger than 583 pc and much closer to our limit of 1000pc .",
    "the @xmath92 values inferred for objects 4322 and 9020 , while higher than those of objects 4839 and 7768 , fall substantially short of expected typical halo velocities .",
    "the probability of observing each of the objects with the @xmath92 values listed in table [ table4 ] is between 1420% . as a group ,",
    "the probability that objects 4322 and 9020 are halo objects is under 3% .",
    "similarly , the hypothesis that all 4 detected white dwarfs in the hudf are halo rather than disk objects is excluded at the 99.9986 % level .",
    "overall , the distances to the four white dwarf candidates identified here is more consistent with them being part of a galactic thick disk .",
    "@xcite derived a disk scale height of 400600 pc using a study of low velocity white dwarfs .",
    "this value was somewhat larger than previous estimates of 250350 pc but it is interesting to note that the m - dwarf disk scale height derived in section [ mdwarfs ] , as well as the distance estimates of the white dwarfs listed in table [ table4 ] all appear to agree with this value .",
    "+ it would be interesting to attempt to set an upper limit on the halo white dwarf density based on the finding of up to two white dwarfs in the hudf . under this assumption , the upper limit to the galactic halo white dwarf density",
    "is computed to be @xmath95 .",
    "this result is consistent with the previous work of @xcite using the combined observations of the hubble deep fields north and south ( @xmath96 ) .",
    "+ a population ii halo white dwarf population that is older than 12 - 13 gyr would have remained undetected here ( an intrinsically fainter than @xmath97 mag white dwarf population would also help explaining the low average distances of the white dwarfs listed in table [ table4 ] ) .",
    "as discussed above , the white dwarfs identified in this work are more likely to be within the galactic thick disk .",
    "it is to be noted that @xcite recently observed a disproportionately large fraction of disk to halo white dwarfs in the hubble deep field north ( hdf - n ) .",
    "@xcite found no evidence of any white dwarfs with tangential velocities larger than 30 km / s down to @xmath98 mag and the authors concluded that the blue objects they saw were all part of the galactic disk .",
    "similarly , the hudf observations presented here successfully identified 4 white dwarf candidates with @xmath99 mag in the hudf , none very likely to be in the galactic halo while 23 detection would have been expected to be consistent with previous studies .",
    "+      while dynamical studies of the galaxy predict the dark matter white dwarf density as high as @xmath100 ( assuming that 100% of the dark matter halo mass is in the form of @xmath101 white dwarfs ) , the failure to detect a significant population of high velocity white dwarfs in the hudf points to a dark matter halo devoid of a significant white dwarf population . following the methodology of @xcite , one can estimate the amount of dark matter halo mass that is probed by the hudf images , and directly compute the fraction of the dark matter halo mass that could be contained in a white dwarf population .",
    "assuming a white dwarf absolute @xmath102 magnitude of 17.0 mag@xcite and a limiting magnitude of @xmath1 mag , the maximum probed distance is 1000 pc . in the corresponding volume , and in the direction of the hudf ,",
    "the included dark matter halo mass is 3 @xmath103 .",
    "a population of dark matter halo white dwarfs could possibly have remained undetected in this study for several reasons : ( 1 ) the method used in this paper may be inefficient at properly identifying halo white dwarfs in table [ table4 ] . in this case , if one assumes that the hudf contains 4 halo white dwarfs ( @xmath28 ) , these would account for @xmath104 , a significant fraction of the expected dark matter halo mass .",
    "this would however increase the ratio of halo to disk white dwarfs to unrealistically high levels ( i.e. @xmath105 ) , and would assume that all the white dwarfs seen in the hudf are from the dark matter halo and not from the pop ii halo , which is highly unrealistic .",
    "the lack of proper motion detections also makes this scenario unlikely ; ( 2 ) white dwarfs do not contribute significantly to the galactic dark matter halo mass . from microlensing experiements towards the magellanic clouds , the contribution of machos to dark matter",
    "has been estimated to be anywhere between 20% to less than 2% ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "furthermore , @xcite showed how an increased thick disk scale height of 400 - 600 pc makes it unlikely that white dwarfs could be the macho objects ; ( 3 ) white dwarfs could contribute significantly to the mass of the galactic dark matter halo but are too faint to be detected in this study .",
    "@xcite showed that an increase in the age of the white dwarf halo population from 10 gyr to 16 gyr is expected to reduce the number of white dwarf detection ( down to @xmath106 ) by a factor of 7 .",
    "the lack of high velocity white dwarf detections in the hudf puts upper limits on the contribution of an hypothetical white dwarf population to the galactic dark matter halo .",
    "based on the brightest objects in the hudf for which we have spectra ( i.e. @xmath28 ) , if the dark matter halo is as old as about 12 gyr @xcite then dark matter halo white dwarfs with @xmath107 ( @xmath108 ) contribute less than 20% to the dark matter .",
    "if the age of the dark matter halo is 10 gyr , white dwarfs ( @xmath109 ) contribute less than 2% to the dark matter .",
    "the possibility that there is a large population of faint white dwarfs that has remained unidentified in this study and which would account for a significant fraction of the dark matter halo can be investigated a little further . recall that in section [ qso ] ,",
    "14 sources with ( @xmath44 ) and blue ( @xmath46 , @xmath47 ) colors were identified .",
    "not all of these sources were expected to be bona - fide stars and some are likely to be extra - galactic sources , but as discussed in section [ test ] , it is estimated that 95% of the stars in the hudf were properly identified , so that this number should be considered to be an upper limit on the number of faint starts in the hudf .",
    "following the same methodology used above , but now using a limiting magnitude of @xmath110 , the hudf images probe through 79 @xmath103 of the dark matter halo . even under the extreme assumption that all 14 unresolved candidates in the udf are high velocities white dwarfs",
    ", this implies that , when reaching down to = 29.5 , faint white dwarfs in the galactic dark matter halo contributing less than 10% to the total dark matter halo mass for a dark matter halo age of 12 gyr .",
    "future observations of the hudf would allow more sensitive measurements of the proper motion of these faint objects ( section [ disk ] ) . setting tighter constraints on the maximum tangential velocities of these faint hudf unresolved objects would allow to exclude some of these objects from high velocity white dwarfs and would allow to further lower the maximum fraction of the dark matter halo mass that could be accounted for by white dwarfs .",
    "a systematic search for unresolved objects in the hudf identified objects with @xmath110 mag . using the grapes spectra of these objects , objects with @xmath28 mag",
    "were spectroscopically identified , including m and later dwarfs ( including 2 unconfirmed l dwarf candidates ) , and qsos .",
    "the m dwarf luminosity function of m4 and later - type stars was computed and compared to predictions based on monte - carlo simulations . assuming a simple analytical model of the galactic disk , the number of detected m dwarfs was shown to be large enough to constraint the scale height of the m and l dwarf galactic disk to be @xmath111 . out of 8 stars that were found to not be m or later - type stars ,",
    "four stars were determined to be old white dwarf candidates .",
    "not a single object was found to have a proper motion that is larger than 0.027/year making them likely galactic thick disk objects .",
    "further imaging of the hudf , using a time span larger than 1.5 year would provide more sensitive proper motion measurements .",
    "more sensitive proper measurements are required to positively place unresolved objects in the galactic disk or halo .",
    "it would also allow to search for high tangential velocity objects amongst the 14 fainter ( @xmath44 ) unresolved sources identified in the hudf . excluding halo membership of objects down to @xmath0 based on proper motion measurements",
    "would further constraint the maximum white dwarf contribution to the dark matter halo mass .",
    "the currently available observations of the hudf , spanning 73 days , show the absence of a significant population of high velocity white dwarfs down to @xmath7 , and a relatively small number of unresolved , faint blue sources in the field down to @xmath0 .",
    "this is interpreted as a consequence of white dwarfs accounting for less than 10% of the dark matter halo , assuming that the dark matter halo is 12 gyr old .",
