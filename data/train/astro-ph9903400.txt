    "in the rome meeting i presented a derivation of the dynamical behavior of a beamed gamma ray burst ( grb ) remnant and its consequences for the afterglow light curve .",
    "rhoads 1999 [ paper i ] ) . here ,",
    "i summarize these results and apply them to test the range of beaming angles permitted by the optical light curve of grb 970508 .",
    "suppose that ejecta from a grb are emitted with initial lorentz factor @xmath3 into a cone of opening half - angle @xmath0 and expand into an ambient medium of uniform mass density @xmath4 with negligible radiative energy losses .",
    "let the initial kinetic energy and rest mass of the ejecta be @xmath5 and @xmath6 , and the swept - up mass and internal energy of the expanding blast wave be @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "then energy conservation implies @xmath9 so long as @xmath10 .",
    "the swept - up mass is determined by the working surface area : @xmath11 , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the sound speed and time since the burst in the frame of the blast wave @xmath14 accreted material .",
    "once @xmath15 , @xmath16 and the dynamical evolution with radius @xmath17 changes from @xmath18 to @xmath19 ( rhoads 1998 , & paper i ) .",
    "the relation between observer frame time @xmath20 and radius @xmath17 also changes , from @xmath21 to @xmath22)$ ] .",
    "thus , at early times @xmath23 , while at late times @xmath24 .",
    "the characteristic length scale is @xmath25 , and the characteristic observed transition time between the two regimes is @xmath26 \\right)^{1/3 } \\zm^{8/3}$ ] , where @xmath27 is the burst s redshift .",
    "we assume that swept - up electrons are injected with a power law energy distribution @xmath28 for @xmath29 , with @xmath30 , and contain a fraction @xmath31 of @xmath8 .",
    "this power law extends up to the cooling break , @xmath32 , at which energy the cooling time is comparable to the dynamical expansion time of the remnant . above @xmath32 ,",
    "the balance between electron injection ( with @xmath33 ) and cooling gives @xmath34 .",
    "we also assume a tangled magnetic field containing a fraction @xmath35 of @xmath8 .",
    "the comoving volume @xmath36 and burster - frame volume @xmath37 are related by @xmath38 , so that @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the resulting spectrum has peak flux density @xmath41 at an observed frequency @xmath42 .",
    "additional spectral features occur at the frequencies of optically thick synchrotron self absorption ( which we shall neglect ) and the cooling frequency @xmath43 ( which is important for optical observations of grb 970508 ) .",
    "the cooling break frequency follows from the relations @xmath44 ( sari , piran , & narayan 1998 ; wijers & galama 1998 ) and @xmath45 . in the power law regime , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 ; while in the exponential regime , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 .",
    "the spectrum is approximated by a broken power law , @xmath52 , with @xmath53 for @xmath54 , @xmath55 for @xmath56 , and @xmath57 for @xmath58 .",
    "the afterglow light curve follows from the spectral shape and the time behavior of the break frequencies .",
    "asymptotic slopes are given in table  1 .",
    "for the @xmath59 regime , we study the evolution of break frequencies numerically .",

    "results are summarized in table  2 and figure  1 .",
    "the final @xmath68 per degree of freedom is @xmath69 .",
    "these large @xmath68 values make meaningful error estimates on parameters difficult .",
    "let us suppose @xmath68 is large because details omitted from the models ( clumps in the ambient medium or blast wave instabilities ) affect the light curve , and so attach an uncertainty of @xmath70 to each predicted flux . adding this in quadrature to observational uncertainties when computing @xmath68",
    ", we obtain @xmath71 . error estimates based on changes in @xmath68 then rule out @xmath72 at about the 90% confidence level even for our `` maximum beaming '' case ( @xmath73 , @xmath74 ) . to convert a supposed break time @xmath67 into a beaming angle @xmath0 , we need estimates of the burst energy per steradian and the ambient density .",
    "wijers & galama ( 1998 ) infer @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "combining these values with @xmath77 gives @xmath78 .",
    "@xmath79 and @xmath4 are substantially uncertain , but because @xmath80 , the error budget for @xmath0 is dominated by uncertainties in @xmath66 rather than in @xmath5 or @xmath4 .",

    "the irreducible minimum energy is thus @xmath87 , using the smallest possible redshift and beaming angle .",
