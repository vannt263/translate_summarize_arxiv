    "exotic hadron spectroscopy opens a new window into quark - gluon dynamics that could shift the paradigm that mesons and baryons consist of @xmath4 and @xmath5 constituent quarks , respectively .",
    "recent lattice qcd studies of the nucleon spectrum indicate that the excited nucleon states may exist with a substantial admixture of glue  @xcite .",
    "these recent predictions initiated the efforts aimed at a search for hybrid baryons in the future experiments at jefferson lab with the clas12 detector  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we discuss the feasibility of using the clas12 detector in search for exotic baryons with the quark core consisting of five constituent quarks including charm .",
    "this is motivated by refs .",
    "@xcite , where the authors propose to use photons to produce hidden - charm pentaquarks of the type that were reported by the lhcb collaboration in the @xmath6 channel  @xcite . in the lhcb data , two structures were observed , the broader has a width of @xmath7 and mass @xmath8 , and the narrower has width @xmath9 and mass @xmath10 .",
    "the preferred spin - parity assignment of these structures is that of @xmath11 or @xmath12 and opposite parities .",
    "here we focus on the narrower structure , referred to as @xmath0 , since we expect the broad one to be more susceptible to variations in the analysis model used to describe the coherent background .",
    "various interpretations of these structures have been proposed .",
    "the possibility of a loosely - bound molecular state of charmed baryons and mesons was investigated in  @xcite , while a resonance interpretation in terms of quark degrees of freedom was proposed in  @xcite .",
    "the possibility that these structures are nonresonant , for example due to the presence of nearby singularities in cross channels was discussed in  @xcite ( for recent reviews on the exotic charmonium - like sector , see  @xcite ) .",
    "if the resonant nature holds , it would be the first time that a signature of a hidden - charm baryon state is found .",
    "it is therefore important to look for other ways to produce the @xmath1 system near threshold  @xcite .",
    "for example , if a peak in the @xmath1 mass spectrum appears in photoproduction , the nonresonant interpretation of the lhcb result would be less likely .    in this paper",
    "we make a prediction for the @xmath2 photoproduction cross section measurement for the clas12 experiment at jlab .",
    "we closely follow the arguments of  @xcite , in particular for the application of vector - meson dominance ( vmd ) . to describe the baryon - resonance photoproduction we use the model of  @xcite that was successfully applied in the past to the analysis of @xmath13 photo- and electroproduction in the exclusive @xmath14 channel .",
    "compared to hadronic production , the exclusive @xmath3 photoproduction off protons is expected to have a large @xmath0 resonant contribution relative to the background .",
    "furthermore , unlike the lhcb case , there is no  third \" particle in the final state that the @xmath1 system could rescatter from .",
    "the existing photoproduction data  @xcite mainly cover the range of photon energies above @xmath15 , _",
    "i.e._well above the possible resonance signal , and it can be well understood as diffractive production .",
    "the few data points in the energy range of interest  @xcite have a mass resolution which is too low to identify a potential resonance signal .",
    "the lhcb peak in photoproduction is expected in a photon energy range where the diffractive cross section is rather low and one can expect a clearly visible resonance peak .",
    "the clas12 detector is replacing the clas apparatus in hall b at jlab and was optimized for measurements of nucleon resonances in electro- and photoproduction via decays to several exclusive meson - nucleon final states  @xcite .",
    "the excitation of the possible hidden charm resonance in the @xmath1 system requires photons with energies up to @xmath16 , and the identification of the resonance involves partial wave analysis . therefore the measurement of the differential cross section and spin - density matrix elements would be desired",
    ". the cross section measurement will be possible with the data from the forward tagger built into the new clas12 detector . ultimately , if the resonance signal is found , it would be of interest to extend the present study to @xmath1 electroproduction , to investigate its internal structure .",
    "the @xmath2-polarization information is currently not feasible with clas12 without muon detection capability , but if the signal is found it would be a good candidate for a detector upgrade .",
    "the nonresonant background is modeled by an effective pomeron exchange ( a ) while the resonant contribution of the @xmath0 in the direct channel ( b ) is modeled by a breit - wigner amplitude.,title=\"fig : \" ] [ fjpsiblob ]      photoproduction .",

    "[ fjpsiprod ] .",
    "the nonresonant background is expected to be dominated by the @xmath18-channel pomeron exchange , and we saturate the @xmath19-channel by the @xmath0 resonance . in the following",
    "we consider only the most favored @xmath20 and @xmath21 spin - parity assignments for the resonance .",
    "we adopt the usual normalization conventions  @xcite , and express the differential cross section in terms of the helicity amplitudes @xmath22 , @xmath23 here , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the incoming and outgoing center - of - mass frame momenta , respectively , @xmath26 is the center - of - mass scattering angle , and @xmath27 is the invariant mass .",
    "note that the electric charge @xmath28 is explicitly factored out from the matrix element .",
    "the contribution of the @xmath0 resonance is parametrized using the breit - wigner ansatz  @xcite , @xmath29 the numerator is given by the product of photo - excitation and hadronic decay helicity amplitudes .",
    "the measured width is narrow enough to be approximated with a constant , @xmath30 .",
    "the angular momentum conservation restricts the sum over @xmath31 , the spin projection along the beam direction in the center of mass frame , to @xmath32 .",
    "the hadronic helicity amplitude @xmath33 , which represents the decay of the resonance of spin @xmath34 to the @xmath1 state , is given by @xmath35 where @xmath36 are the helicity couplings between the resonance and the final state .",
    "there are three independent couplings with @xmath37 , @xmath38 , being the other three related by parity . for simplicity ,",
    "we assume all these couplings to be equal , _",
    "i.e._@xmath39 . the helicity amplitudes and the partial decay width @xmath40 are related by    @xmath41    with @xmath42 being the branching ratio of @xmath43 and @xmath44 the momentum @xmath25 evaluated at the resonance peak .",
    "we assume that the @xmath0 decay is dominated by the lowest partial wave , with angular momentum @xmath45 for @xmath46 and @xmath47 for @xmath48 .",
    "we recall that the following near - threshold behavior of the helicity amplitudes holds : @xmath49 .",
    "the helicity matrix elements of @xmath50 are usually parametrized in terms of two independent coupling constants , @xmath51 and @xmath52 , which are related to the matrix elements with @xmath53 , respectively .",
    "the other two helicities @xmath54 and @xmath55 are constrained by parity . using the standard normalization convention , in which the helicity couplings @xmath56 have units of @xmath57 and are proportional to the unit electromagnetic charge , @xmath58 with @xmath59 the momentum @xmath24 evaluated at the resonance peak .",
    "the electromagnetic decay width @xmath60 is given by @xmath61.\\ ] ]              the photon helicity amplitudes for a pentaquark are not known . to rely on data as much as possible , we start by following ref .  @xcite and assume a vmd relation for the transverse vector - meson helicity amplitudes @xmath62 with @xmath63 being the @xmath3decay constant which is proportional to the electromagnetic current matrix elements , @xmath64 the decay constant is related to the @xmath2 wave function via the van  royen - weisskopf relation , and can be estimated from the leptonic decay width of the @xmath65 , yielding @xmath66 .",
    "finally , the vmd leads to @xmath67 with the factor @xmath68 due to the fact that in eq .   only the transverse polarizations of the @xmath3contribute .",

    "[ flowlarge ] ) have been smeared with the experimental resolution .",
    "the mean value of the parameters and the uncertainties have been computed employing the bootstrap technique  @xcite .",
    "the bootstrap technique allows to take into account the correlations among parameters and to properly propagate their uncertainties to the observables @xcite .",

    "first we explored the parameter space with @xmath92 fits using minuit  @xcite in order to identify the region where the absolute minimum lies .",

    "once the parameter - space region where the absolute minimum lies has been identified , we use this information to randomly seed the starting values of the parameters for our fits .",
    "we generate @xmath93 data sets for each one of the two @xmath94 options ( @xmath95 and @xmath21 ) and three smearings ( @xmath96 , and @xmath97 mev ) by randomly sampling the experimental points and the pentaquark mass and width according to their uncertainties .",
    "the mass of the @xmath0 ( @xmath98 mev ) is sampled according to a gaussian distribution , while the width , in order to avoid negative values , is sampled according to a gamma distribution @xmath99 where @xmath100 mev is the pentaquark width and @xmath101 mev its uncertainty .",
    "the experimental data point with the lowest photon energy and @xmath91 ( see figs .  [ flowlarge ] and [ flowall ] ) is also sampled according to a gamma distribution to avoid a negative value of the differential cross section , while the rest of the experimental data points are sampled according to gaussian distributions . for each data",
    "set , an independent maximum likelihood fit is performed using minuit  @xcite . for each smearing option , once the @xmath93 data sets have been fitted , we can extract the best @xmath71 fits , whose mean value for each parameter provides the best values reported in tables  [ tab : spin32parameters ] and [ tab : spin52parameters ] and the upper and lower values for each parameter provide the uncertainties .",
    "with this set of parameters that correspond to @xmath102 confidence level ( cl ) we can compute each observable and its uncertainty  @xcite . computing quantities at a any other cl ( _ e.g. _ @xmath103 ) can be achieved in the same way , given that enough fits are computed .",
    "figure  [ flowall ] shows the results of the fits for the different smearing parameters we also show the high - energy data compared to our fit result for the case of no smearing in fig .",
    "[ fhighall ] .",
    "since there are no data for the resonance peak and there is no known lower limit for the branching fraction , the mean values of the parameters are naturally consistent with the non existence of the @xmath0 .",
    "we find that the upper limit for the branching ratio @xmath42 at a 95% cl ranges from @xmath104 to @xmath105 for @xmath11 , depending on the experimental resolution , and from @xmath106 to @xmath107 for @xmath12 .",
    "the resulting hadronic couplings , as well as the photocouplings , are summarized in table  [ tabresparams ] .",
    "it is worth noting that @xmath86 is highly correlated with @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath90 are also highly correlated , and that @xmath89 is correlated with @xmath86 and @xmath90 .",

    "[ fhighold ]     [ fhighnew ]            it is possible that a structure at @xmath108 had indeed not been seen in the past , because of the finite resolution as the peak strength decreases and becomes broader and flatter .",
    "its detection requires finer energy binning .",
    "the peak is expected to be narrow , falling in between two bins where data is available .",
    "therefore , it is important to perform an energy scan in this region to confirm the existence of the resonance .",
    "while there are no data on the angular dependence near threshold yet , we can make a few predictions based on the model presented above . in order to be able to do a deeper study of this dependence ,",
    "we now relax the vmd condition and let the relative sizes of the photocouplings vary .",

    "pronounced differences in the predicted angular distributions under different assignments for the @xmath0 photocouplings and spins demonstrate the prospect of determining these quantities from the future experimental data on @xmath3 photoproduction cross sections measured with clas12 in the near - threshold region .    finally , we discuss the results for the total cross section , shown in fig .",

    "the data available in this energy range are scarce and there is no measurement of the differential cross section .",
    "we tested the compatibility of the data and a simple two - component model containing the directly produced resonance and a diffractive background .",
    "we conclude that , the resonance peak being narrow enough , it could have escaped detection due to poor energy resolution .    from the fits to the available @xmath2 photoproduction data ,",
