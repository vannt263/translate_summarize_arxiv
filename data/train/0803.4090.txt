    "in recent years noncommutative geometry @xcite has received much attention due to the fact that spacetime may be noncommutative at very small length scale . for detail study on noncommutative space",
    "see the list of refs . of refs .",
    "although the noncommutative scale is expected to be pretty small , perhaps below the planck scale @xcite , people are looking for phenomenological consequences of the noncommutative geometry in low energy quantum mechanical regime .",
    "one such example is the fractional angular momentum quantum number and the existence of the zero point expectation value of the angular momentum in noncommutative space , which has been discussed in a recent paper @xcite .",
    "usually only the coordinate space is considered to be noncommutative when the noncommutative physics is studied .",
    "but in this letter we consider both the coordinate and momentum space to be noncommutative .",
    "however momentum space non - commutativity is not a new concept . as we know in quantum mechanics the generalized momentum components",
    "are noncommutative , which can be taken as a motivation for us to study the quantum mechanical model in noncommutative momentum space .",
    "also recently it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that in order to keep the bose einstein statistics intact at the noncommutative level the momentum space needs to be noncommutative besides the noncommutative coordinate space",
    ".    this letter is organized as follows : in section [ s1 ] we consider the isotropic @xmath2 oscillator in a space where both the coordinate and momentum are noncommutative .",
    "the spectrum of the system is found and its symmetry is discussed for a specific noncommutative parameters range . in section [ s2 ] the model of section [ s1 ] is compared with the landau problem and a relation between the noncommutative parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 with the magnetic field is established .",
    "finally section [ s3 ] is devoted to a discussion .",
    "we consider both the position and the momentum space to be noncommutative .",
    "the noncommutative algebra in the phase space can be written as ( in @xmath3 unit ) @xmath4&= & 2i\\epsilon_{ij}\\theta,~ \\left[\\overline{p_i},\\overline{p_j}\\right]=2i\\epsilon_{ij}\\overline{\\theta},\\\\ \\left[\\overline{x_i},\\overline{p_j}\\right]&= & i\\delta_{ij}\\left[1+\\theta\\overline{\\theta}\\right]\\ , , \\label{al4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath0 is the noncommutative parameter for the coordinate space , @xmath1 is the noncommutative parameter for the momentum space and @xmath5 .",
    "the fact that the noncommutative parameter @xmath1 is not a magnetic field will be discussed later in this paper .",
    "basically one can see that our algebra ( [ al4 ] ) is unaffected by the electric charge @xmath6 of the quantum particle .",
    "but in case of magnetic field the algebra should be affected by the limit @xmath7 .",
    "the 2d isotropic oscillator hamiltonian @xmath8 can now be defined as the same hamiltonian but now the coordinate and momentum are replaced by the corresponding noncommutative counter parts .",
    "the noncommutative counterpart of the above hamiltonian is @xcite @xmath9 it is possible to go back to the commutative space by replacing the noncommutative operators in terms of the commutative operators .",
    "we therefore need to get a representation of the algebra ( [ al4 ] ) in terms of the commutative coordinates .",
    "one possible representation is given by @xmath10 the above representation is consistent with the algebra ( [ al4 ] ) and can be used to go back to commutative space , where the problem can be handled easily .",
    "our hamiltonian ( [ 2dh ] ) thus becomes @xmath11 where @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "this hamiltonian can be solved exactly .",
    "it is possible to write the hamiltonian ( [ 2dh1 ] ) as a sum of two separate 1d harmonic oscillators with frequencies @xmath15 @xcite , @xmath16 where the annihilation operators @xmath17 ,",
    "@xmath18\\\\ b_{\\theta,\\overline{\\theta}}=\\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{m_\\theta\\omega_{\\theta,\\overline{\\theta}}^-}}\\left[(p_1-ip_2 ) - im_\\theta\\omega_{\\theta,\\overline{\\theta}}^-(x_1-ix_2 ) \\right ] \\label{annihi1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the corresponding creation operators @xmath19 satisfy the usual commutation relations @xmath20=\\left[b_{\\theta,\\overline{\\theta } } , b_{\\theta,\\overline{\\theta}}^\\dagger\\right ] = 1\\,,\\label{2doshac}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with all other commutators being zero .",
    "the explicit form of the frequencies are given by @xmath21 where @xmath22  .",
    "the number operators @xmath23 and @xmath24 satisfy the eigenvalue equation @xmath25 with @xmath26 .",
    "now the exact eigenvalue for the hamiltonian ( [ 2dosh ] ) is known in literature and is of the form @xmath27 which is non - degenerate due to the presence of non - commutativity .",
    "but it is also possible to get back the @xmath28 symmetry for a specific case when the ratio of the two frequencies is rational , @xmath29 , @xmath30 are relatively prime numbers . but before going into the complicated case we first mention the simplest case , @xmath31 , when also the @xmath28 symmetry is recovered .",
    "since for @xmath32 the third term in the hamiltonian ( [ 2dh1 ] ) is zero the hamiltonian becomes isotropic .",
    "so the the eigenvalue becomes @xmath33 where the frequency is @xmath34 .",
    "another important case is when @xmath35 due to the constraint ( [ cons1 ] ) the hamiltonian is infinitely degenerate and the eigenvalues are given by @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "note that the above spectrum is obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , but there the origin of momentum noncommutativity is due to magnetic field and thus coupled to the electric charge of the particle .",
    "now let us consider the non degenerate spectrum ( [ 2dosei ] ) which is known @xcite to have @xmath28 symmetry in a certain case .",
    "let us assume that for @xmath39 , the ratio of the two frequencies be such that , @xmath40 for certain constants @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "then the spectrum ( [ 2dosei ] ) becomes @xmath44 which has @xmath28 symmetry .",
    "note that the @xmath45 limit of ( [ 2doseisu2 ] ) should reduce to the results already obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite .     as a function of @xmath0 for @xmath46 , @xmath47 .",
    "the green curve corresponds to @xmath48 ( it corresponds to a spectrum given in eq .",

    "we now consider the landau problem on a plane",
    ". for different discussions on landau problems see refs .",
    "@xcite the hamiltonian in symmetric gauge @xmath51 is given by @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the constant magnetic field in the @xmath54 direction .",
    "the eigenvalues known as landau levels are known to be infinitely degenerate @xmath55 where @xmath56 .",
    "note the similarity between the landau levels ( [ 2doseib ] ) and ( [ comdeei ] ) . the two spectrum will overlap with each other if @xmath57 due to this similarity between the two spectrum one can exploit it and get a relation between the noncommutative parameters and the magnetic field in the landau problem . on comparing the mass term of the two hamiltonians , namely ( [ 2dh1 ] ) and ( [ 2dhl ] )",
    ", we obtain @xmath58 considering ( [ fre2 ] ) and ( [ mass1 ] ) together we get @xmath59 we used the unit where @xmath60 . for the quantum hall experiment",
    "the typical strength of magnetic field is @xmath61",
    ". then the noncommutative parameters are typically @xmath62 note that by comparing term by term of the hamiltonian of the landau problem and the hamiltonian of an oscillator in noncommutative coordinate space in ref .",
    "@xcite an inverse relation between the noncommutative parameter and magnetic field has been established , which is comparable with the second and third term of eq .",
    "( [ relation1 ] ) and numerical value of the noncommutative parameter due to coordinate non - commutativity is also obtained .",
    "one should keep in mind that the above relation ( [ relation1 ] ) is just an analogy but in general there is now relation of the two noncommutative parameters @xmath0 and @xmath63 with the magnetic field .",
    "although from the representation of noncommutative momentum given in eq .",
    "( [ rep3 ] ) one may think that it is analog to the generalized momentum @xmath64 in constant magnetic filed background written in symmetric gauge for the vector potential @xmath65 but this is clearly not so .",
    "the reason they are different will be evident if one consider neutral particle for which the noncommutative momentum still satisfy the commutative relation ( [ al4 ] ) but in magnetic field background now the generalized momentum @xmath66 ( because @xmath7 ) , which means they commute .",
    "in fact the momentum noncmmutativity is used for the neutral particle model of neutron in a quantum gravitational well @xcite and bounds for the noncommutative parameters have been obtained using the experimental result @xcite of neutron gravitational states .     for @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath46 ,",
    "@xmath47 is drawn . along the curve",
    "the @xmath28 symmetry is restored .",

    "isotropic oscillator on a plane is considered in this article , where we take both the coordinate and momentum space to be noncommutative .",
    "we discussed its general solution which is non degenerate .",
    "but it is possible to get back the degenerate spectrum when the noncommutative parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 satisfy certain constrants .",

    "( [ 2dh1e ] ) .",
    "note that for the condition @xmath69 bose - einstein statistics does not remain intact at the noncommutative level @xcite , which can be understood as follows .",

    "it is known from ref .",
    "@xcite that the angular momentum @xmath74 does possess zero point eigenvalue unlike commutative case where @xmath75 . in our notation @xmath76 , for @xmath77 .",
    "the zero point eigenvalue @xmath78 . the most general algebra satisfied by @xmath79",

    "it is to be noted from ( [ al4 ] ) that the planck constant is modified like @xmath83 due to simultaneous consideration the coordinate and momentum space noncommutativity as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite and in other papers also .",
    "finally , it may be noted that instead of starting with an isotropic oscillator on the noncommutative plane , one could have started with an anisotropic oscillator on the noncommuting plane @xcite . in that case",
    "only the mass @xmath84 would change and the relation concerning @xmath0 , @xmath63 and @xmath53 will remain unchanged ."
