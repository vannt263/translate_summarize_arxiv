    "success in achieving that goal is gauged by a detected signal ( _ e.g. _ , the mass spectrum in the case of selective molecular fragmentation ) , and this information is fed back into a learning algorithm @xcite , which alters the laser pulse shape for the next round of experiments .",
    "high duty cycles of @xmath0 seconds or less per control experiment make it possible to iterate this process many times and perform efficient experimental searches over a control parameter space defining the laser pulse shape .    as an example of this process ,",

    "yields of targeted species are typically enhanced considerably over those obtained by non - optimized methods .",
    "it is found that the optimal pulse shapes achieving these enhancements can be quite complicated , and understanding their physical significance has proven difficult .",

    "[ beables ] we will first describe john bell s beable model for finite dimensional hilbert spaces , in order to obtain a precise ( but non - unique ) definition of `` mechanism '' for quantum systems in terms of trajectories over their associated classical state spaces . for instance , in molecular systems a trajectory would take the form of a sequence of transitions that starts with a given initial molecular configuration and switches to another configuration at a distinct time @xmath1 , and then to another at @xmath2 , _ etc._to be contrasted with a continuously changing superposition of many such configurations .    the means to numerically implement this mechanism concept is presented in  [ simulating ] .",

    "@xmath6 incorporates the effect of the control field @xmath7 , and we can explicitly follow the evolution of @xmath8 into a desired final state @xmath9 .    this paper is concerned with the question : what is the importance of a given sequence @xmath10 of actual transitions  or , more specifically , of a given trajectory defined as a continuous function @xmath11 of time  in achieving the desired final state @xmath12 ?",
    "in other words , it is clear that the system _ is _ being driven into a desired state , but can we find a physical picture of _ how _ this is being accomplished ?",
    "a conventional answer to the question raised above , essentially that given by bohr on first seeing feynman s path integral , is to reject the question as ill - posed because quantum mechanics is said to forbid consideration of precisely defined trajectories over the classical state space @xmath13 .",
    "nevertheless , it is well established that there exist dynamical models generating an ensemble of trajectories @xmath11 whose statistical properties exactly match those associated with @xmath14 at each @xmath15 . in the case of a continuous state space ,",
    "the first such model was that of de broglie , later rediscovered and completed by bohm @xcite .",
    "they reintroduce classical - like particle trajectories into quantum theory by taking the probability current @xmath16 $ ] to describe a statistical ensemble of real particles .",
    "so , @xmath17 gives the velocity of a particle with mass @xmath18 and position @xmath19 at time @xmath15 , in de broglie - bohm ( dbb ) theory .",
    "the physical particle is taken to exist independently of , but also to have its motion determined by , the wavefunction @xmath20 .",
    "the time evolution of @xmath20 itself is just given by the schrodinger equation .",
    "bohm developed a full account of how ensembles of such classical - like particles could reproduce the predictions of quantum mechanics .",
    "a basic issue is to compare @xmath21 with the statistical distribution @xmath22 describing an ensemble of particles evolving by ( [ v ] ) .",
    "one can show that if the initial distribution of particles satisfies @xmath23 , then @xmath24 will hold for all @xmath25 .",
    "that is , if the ensemble is initially in the `` quantum equilibrium '' distribution given by @xmath26 , the dynamics([v ] ) for the particles , and the schrodinger equation for @xmath20will preserve this equilibrium , consistent with the predictions of standard quantum theory .",
    "the result is easily generalized to arbitrary interacting @xmath27-particle systems by taking @xmath19 as a point in the @xmath28 dimensional configuration space .    in dbb theory",

    "for instance , one might choose the momentum values @xmath31 as the beables of the theory , and the dbb trajectories @xmath32 would be replaced by momentum space trajectories @xmath33 .    in the context of a finite dimensional hilbert space with basis @xmath4",

    "the answer to the initial question regarding the importance of a given trajectory in achieving the desired state @xmath9 is now very simple .",
    "the importance may be taken as just the probability of realizing that trajectory with the jump rule ( [ t ] ) .",
    "we can express the final state population in terms of these path probabilities via the integral ( path sum ) version of ( [ dfp ] ) : @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the probability of realizing the path @xmath56 under ( [ t ] ) , and @xmath57 gives the beable configuration at @xmath58 .",
    "the first sum is taken over all such paths ending on @xmath59 at @xmath60 , and @xmath61 = \\{p\\ ; |\\ ; n_{p+1 } \\ne n_p\\}$ ] defines the jump set .",

    "the definition ( [ t ] ) might even be changed in ways that do not preserve ( [ modpsi ] ) , if one is willing to relinquish a strict probability interpretation for the trajectories @xcite .",
    "in general , there are many different ways to assign probabilities to trajectories that all result in the same time - dependent occupation probabilities @xmath51 .",
    "the predictions of quantum mechanics , therefore , can not select a single assignment .",
    "this non - uniqueness at the root of quantum mechanism identification can be dealt with only by reference to the simplicity and explanatory power of a given mechanism definition .",
    "below we adopt the definition ( [ t ] ) .",

    "consider the evolution of beable trajectories according to ( [ t ] ) , which appears to require a time step small enough that each part of @xmath92 , including the @xmath93 terms , not vary much over the step .",
    "nevertheless , the total probability of jumping from @xmath18 to @xmath34 over @xmath94 is given by the integral @xmath95 over that range with @xmath96 corrections .",

    "the finite - ensemble deviations are observed to be consistent with a @xmath113 convergence law .",
    "about 60% of the trajectories generated are found to involve four jumps , and of these the trajectories passing through sites @xmath114 are noticeably more probable than those passing through @xmath115 .",
    "6-jump trajectories comprise about 30% of the ensemble . and",
    "it becomes increasingly less likely to find trajectories with more and more jumps .",
    "the largest number of jumps observed in a single trajectory was 14 .",
    "three such trajectories occurred out of the ensemble total @xmath116 .",
    "a natural expectation is that the optimal field @xmath7 would concentrate on the higher probability trajectories and not waste much effort on guiding highly improbable trajectories , such as the 14-jumpers , to the target state @xmath117 , as the latter have essentially no impact on the control objective ( final population of the target state ) .",
    "interestingly , though , the vast majority of even the lowest probability trajectories are still guided to @xmath117 .",
    "apparently , the optimal field is able to coordinate its effect on low probability trajectories with that on other trajectories at no real detriment to the latter .",
    "we shall come back to this point later .",
    "one way to conveniently categorize the large set of trajectories , each expressible as a sequence of time - labeled jumps @xmath118 , is to drop the time labels , leaving only the `` pathway '' @xmath10 .",

    "this corresponds to the onset of heavy growth for @xmath120 around @xmath119 fs ( see fig .",

    "these 6-jumpers , along with other high - order contributions , thus explain the small surge in @xmath120 between 50 and 80 fs",
    ". another much smaller surge around @xmath124 fs and one still smaller around @xmath125 fs ( see inset of fig .",
    "[ psi6 ] ) are attributable to 8-th and higher order trajectories `` ringing '' back and forth on @xmath126 .    for @xmath127 ,",
    "many of the 6-jumpers are at @xmath117 and need to be de - excited on the @xmath128 transition before they can jump back up to @xmath117 .",
    "simultaneously , many of the 4-jumpers are at @xmath122 and should not be prematurely excited on @xmath129 , lest they not remain at @xmath117 through @xmath130 fs .",
    "the optimal field thus faces a conundrum : how to stimulate the @xmath131 transition preferentially for the 6-jumpers ( in @xmath117 ) over the 4-jumpers ( in @xmath122 ) .",
    "the means by which this feat is accomplished may be understood by reference to the jump rule ( [ t ] ) .",
    "@xmath7 induces jumps through the explicit @xmath132 factor but also through the @xmath101 quotient , which depends on @xmath7 through @xmath133 .",
    "in particular , ( [ rez ] ) implies that at any one time @xmath15 jumps on this transition must be either all upward or all downward .",

    "the correlation between @xmath135 and @xmath139 , which controls downward jumping , is @xmath140 over the same range .",
    "looking at the trajectories in more detail , one notices a distinct bunching of jumps .",
    "beables tend to jump together in narrow time bands , or else to abstain in unison from jumping .",
    "this behavior can be gauged by calculating the two - time jump - jump correlation function : @xmath141 where @xmath142 is the number of jumps of type @xmath143 occurring in @xmath37 , and @xmath143 is a subset of the entire ensemble of trajectories .",
    "for instance , the two - time function with @xmath143 taken as the set of jumps on the @xmath129 transition is plotted in fig.[j2 ] .",
    "the fs time - scale oscillations correspond to the level splittings @xmath144 and the dominant frequency components of @xmath7 .",
    "enhanced correlations around @xmath145 correspond to the jump bunching noticeable in the trajectories .",
    "two side - bands around @xmath146  fs are associated with 6-jump and higher order trajectories that go up , down , and up again on @xmath126 over the approximate time window @xmath147 .",
    "this conclusion can be verified by computing two - time functions with @xmath143 specialized to particular pathways .",
    "other much smaller features for @xmath148 fs ( see inset of fig .",
    "[ j2 ] ) are attributable to higher order trajectories ringing on @xmath126 .    in general ,",
    "the fs oscillations characteristic of these two - time functions show that @xmath7 works in an essentially discrete way , turning on the flow of beables over a given transition and then turning it off with a duty cycle of @xmath149  fs .",
    "the associated bandwidth of @xmath150 is small enough to discriminate between all non - degenerate @xmath144 except between @xmath151 and @xmath152 , which differ by only @xmath153 .",
    "this circumstance leaves effectively three distinguishable transitions . with a total time of 100 fs , the control field @xmath7",
    "can potentially enact roughly @xmath154 separate flow operations .",
    "the fact that trajectories with pathway probability @xmath155% are still almost always guided successfully to @xmath117 suggests that these @xmath156 operations are more than necessary to obtain the 97% success rate achieved by the optimal control algorithm in this simulation .",
    "it appears that the algorithm actively sweeps these aberrant trajectories back into the mainstream so as to maximize even their minute contribution to the control objective .",
    "using these beable trajectory methods to extract mechanism information directly from closed - loop data is complicated by the fact that we can not assume knowledge of a time - dependent wavefunction , hamiltonian , or possibly even the energy level structure of the system . frequently in the laboratory ,",
    "the only available information consists of final state population measurements and knowledge of the control field @xmath7 .",
    "the following analysis aims to show how a limited statistical characterization of beable trajectories may be generated from laboratory data associated with a given optimal control field .",
    "in particular , we will show how to extract @xmath157 , the minimum number of jumps necessary to reach the final state @xmath59 from the initial state @xmath158 ; also @xmath159 , the average number of such jumps over an ensemble of beable trajectories ; and possibly higher moments @xmath160 as well .",
    "after a general formulation of this analysis is presented , it will be applied to simulated experimental data in the case of the model 7-level system considered above .",
    "we propose to obtain mechanism information by examining the effect on the final state population @xmath161 of variations in the control field _",
