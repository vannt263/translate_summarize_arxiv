    "supersymmetry ( susy ) is one of the most elegant solutions , if not the best , to the gauge hierarchy problem .",
    "the fine - tuning argument in the gauge hierarchy problem requires susy particles at work at the tev scale to stabilize the gap between the electroweak scale and the grand unified theory ( gut ) scale or the planck scale .",
    "the most recent lower bound on the higgs boson mass has been raised to 114.4 gev @xcite .",
    "this in fact puts some stress on the soft susy parameters , known as the little hierarchy problem .",
    "since the higgs boson receives radiative corrections dominated by the top squark loop , the mass bound requires the top squark mass to be heavier than 500 gev . from the renormalization - group ( rg )",
    "equation of @xmath2 , the magnitude of @xmath3 .",
    "thus , the parameters in the higgs potential are fine - tuned at a level of a few percent in order to obtain a higgs boson mass of @xmath4 gev .",
    "recently , arkani - hamed and dimopoulos adopted a rather radical approach to susy @xcite .",
    "they essentially discarded the hierarchy problem by accepting the fine - tuning solution to the higgs boson mass .",
    "they argued that since the cosmological constant problem needs much more serious fine - tuning that one has to live with , one may as well let go of the much less serious fine - tuning in the gauge hierarchy problem .",
    "the only criteria in setting up the scenario are ( i ) the dark matter constraint imposed by the wmap data @xcite : @xmath5 ( @xmath6 range ) , and ( ii ) the gauge - coupling unification .",
    "the scenario is coined as `` split susy '' @xcite with the spectrum specified by the feature of the following distinct scales :    1 .",
    "all the scalars , except for a cp - even higgs boson , are very heavy .",
    "one usually assumes a common mass scale for them at @xmath7 gev to @xmath8 .",
    "2 .   the gaugino masses @xmath9 and the higgsino mass parameter @xmath1 are comparatively much lighter and of the order of tev in order to provide an acceptable dark matter candidate .    in this work , we propose a further split in the split susy by raising the @xmath1 parameter to a large value which could be about the same as the sfermion mass or the susy breaking scale .",
    "we call it the @xmath1-split susy scenario . in this scenario",
    ", we do not encounter the notorious @xmath1 problem @xcite . at the same time",
    ", our scenario can still achieve the gauge coupling unification and provide a viable dark matter candidate .",
    "the gauge coupling unification is satisfied because the rg running of the gauge couplings is mainly determined by the standard model ( sm ) particle and gaugino contributions .",
    "whether the higgsinos are very heavy has a milder effect .",
    "the dark matter constraint requires @xmath10 to be smaller than @xmath11 ; i.e. , the dark matter is wino - like .",
    "we summarize the differences between the split susy and our @xmath1-split susy scenarios as follows .    1 .",
    "the higgsino mass parameter @xmath1 is raised to a very high scale in our scenario while in split susy it is at the electroweak scale .",
    "2 .   the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) has to be the wino or gluino instead of the bino in our scenario because the bino would give a too large relic density , whereas the lsp can be the bino with @xmath12 in split susy .",
    "3 .   the wino dark matter can reach an interesting level of indirect detection , particularly the monochromatic photon signal , due to strong annihilation cross sections , and similarly for the anti - proton and positron detection . on the other hand , the signal for direct detection is vanishingly small because of the absence of light squarks or higgsino couplings . in split susy",
    "both the direct and indirect detection signals are present , depending on the nature of the lsp .",
    "4 .   in our @xmath1-split susy scenario , only chargino - pair production ( @xmath13 ) and chargino - neutralino associated production ( @xmath14 ) are possible at hadron colliders .",
    "the cross sections are in a certain ratio in terms of gauge couplings . moreover , at @xmath15 colliders only the chargino - pair production is possible . in split susy",
    "all pair production channels are possible .",
    "5 .   in our @xmath1-split susy scenario ,",
    "charginos can have long decays .",
    "since the mass difference between the chargino and the neutralino can be less than the pion mass , the chargino may travel more than a meter or so before it decays , and therefore producing ionized tracks in central silicon detectors . in split",
    "susy , the chargino decays promptly in general .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    ", we discuss a few issues in raising the @xmath1 parameter .",
    "we discuss the effects on gauge coupling unification in sec .",

    "in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) a dimensionful superpotential parameter @xmath1 is associated with the higgs superfields . a natural choice for the value of this parameter should be either zero or the scale of the ultra - violet ( uv ) theory , say , the planck scale , gut scale , or susy breaking scale .",
    "nevertheless , phenomenological analyses give us a different result .",
    "once the electroweak symmetry is broken , the weak scale , characterized by the @xmath16 boson mass , is given by the @xmath1 parameter and other soft susy breaking parameters : @xmath17 based upon the naturalness argument , @xmath1 along with other soft susy breaking parameters are required to fall in a range near the weak scale .",
    "this discrepancy between scales of @xmath1 based on the two different naturalness arguments is the so - called @xmath1 problem @xcite .",
    "it should be emphasized that although the value of @xmath1 has a lower bound set by the chargino mass , its upper bound purely comes from the naturalness requirement as outlined above .    since in the split susy model the fine - tuning of the light higgs boson mass is accepted , as is the case of the cosmological constant , we then do not need to worry about the possibility of an unnatural cancellation between the two terms on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : mz ] ) .",
    "moreover , @xmath1 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 are now raised to more natural values , such as the susy breaking scale , thus alleviating the @xmath1 problem .",
    "another issue is in the higgs potential given by @xmath20 where @xmath21 , @xmath22 is the @xmath23-term contribution and much smaller than the other terms in both the split susy and the @xmath1-split susy scenarios . in order to have a light higgs boson near the electroweak scale , a finely - tuned relation among all three terms is required @xcite . in the split susy , since @xmath1 remains small",

    "our @xmath1-split susy is better than split susy .",
    "moreover , one minimization condition of the higgs potential , eq .",
    "( [ eq : vscalar ] ) , gives @xmath30 as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , from the above expression split susy predicts that @xmath31 , thereby relating the two scales given the phenomenological constraint @xmath32 .",
    "this is because in split susy the light gaugino masses are achieved by a softly broken @xmath33 symmetry .",

    "we are left with three gauginos in the tev regime or less .",
    "first of all , the bino can not be the lightest .",

    "in such a situation , the lsp can still annihilate efficiently to give the correct relic density .",

    "it constitutes a substantial fraction of the dark matter in the universe only if the wino mass is of order @xmath68 tev .",
    "the relic density for the wino dark matter in the case of anomaly mediated susy breaking @xcite is given by @xcite @xmath69 if the effect of coannihilation from the charged wino is included , the coefficient in the above equation will be further reduced .",
    "therefore , if the wino is the dominant dark matter component , its mass has to be of order 2 tev .",
    "however , there is also the possibility that the wino comes from other non - thermal sources @xcite .",
    "one should also entertain the option that the gluino is the lsp , which has been discussed in the literatures @xcite .",
    "the gluino can hadronize into an @xmath33-hadron .",
    "if the lightest @xmath33-hadron is electrically neutral and its mass is of order @xmath71 tev , it can also form a major component of the dark matter in the universe @xcite .",
    "this is based on the assumption that the effective annihilation of the @xmath33-hadron is due to the annihilation of its internal gluino with the gluino from another @xmath33-hadron . since the annihilation of gluinos is via strong interactions ,",
    "the annihilation rate is typically large and therefore requires a gluino mass of order @xmath71 tev in order to be a dark matter .",
    "also , the gluino lsp with a mass of 2 tev or more is safe from the search for strongly interacting massive particles in anomalously heavy nuclei @xcite .",
    "since the wino needs to be very heavy ( @xmath72 tev ) to be the dominant dark matter , the whole susy spectrum can only be marginally produced at the lhc .",
    "the collider phenomenology will only be limited to a very small corner provided by a @xmath73 tev gluino .",
    "the production rate is not high enough for a good study .    on the other hand",
    ", there can be other non - thermal sources of dark matter .",
    "for example , in the context of anomaly - mediated susy breaking models @xcite the lsp is usually the neutral wino . for a relatively light neutral wino it can not be the dominant dark matter because of its large annihilation cross sections .",
    "however , an intriguing source of non - thermal wino for compensation is the decay of moduli fields @xcite , which can produce a sufficient amount of neutral winos . in this case",
    ", even a light neutral wino can constitute a major fraction of the dark matter .",
    "there are also other non - thermal sources of wino dark matter discussed in the literatures @xcite .",
    "pure wino dark matter , as explained above , can come from both thermal and non - thermal sources , with the latter source possibly being dominant .",
    "the wino dark matter has a very interesting signal for indirect detection in view of its large annihilation cross sections , e.g. , @xmath74 .",
    "in particular , the last two channels , though involving loop - suppressed cross sections , can give a very clean signal of monochromatic photon lines .",
    "if the resolution of the photon detectors ( either ground - based or satellite - based ) is high enough , a clean , sharp , unambiguous photon peak at hundreds of gev should be observed above the background .",
    "here we give an estimate on the photon flux in our @xmath1-split susy scenario .",
    "we use the results given in ref .  @xcite . in the limit of pure wino and very heavy sfermions ,",
    "only the @xmath75-@xmath76 loop is important .",
    "we obtain @xmath77 note that for comparison purposes , the value of @xmath78 for a pure higgsino case is about @xmath79 @xcite .",
    "the photon flux as a result of this annihilation is given by @xcite @xmath80 where we have used @xmath81 , @xmath82 gev , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 for the photon flux coming from the galactic center .",

    "it ranges from @xmath86 to @xmath87 @xcite . for a typical atmospheric cerenkov telescope ( act ) such as veritas @xcite and hess @xcite , the angular coverage is about @xmath88 and may reach a sensitivity at the level of @xmath89 at the tev scale .",
    "therefore , the signal of pure wino dark matter annihilating into monochromatic photons is easily covered by the next generation act experiments .",
    "since the wino annihilation into the @xmath90 pair is very effective , one can also measure the excess in anti - protons and positrons @xcite , which can be measured in anti - matter search experiments , e.g. , amsii @xcite .",
    "we end this section by noting that the direct search signal for our @xmath1-split susy scenario is very difficult because of the absence of light squarks or the higgsino components in the lightest neutralino .",

    "such a method of detecting the single photon plus missing energy is more difficult at hadronic colliders .    in summary , the detection of the chargino is easier when @xmath123 is very small ( @xmath137 ) or when @xmath123 is large ( @xmath138 a few gev ) .",
    "the former gives charged tracks in the silicon detector whereas the latter gives prompt leptons or jets plus missing energies .",
    "the intermediate range presents a challenge to experiments .",
    "the questions are how many layers of silicon that the chargino can travel and how well the resolution the non - pointing pion can be .    in the case of pure wino lsp ,",
    "the lightest neutralino and chargino are essentially degenerate in mass at the tree level .",
    "the radiative corrections can lift the mass degeneracy . in our @xmath1-split susy scenario ,",
    "the mass difference is due to the radiative corrections of the gauge boson loops @xcite , given by @xmath139 \\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath140 and @xmath141 are the sine and cosine of the weinberg angle , and @xmath142 .",
    "numerically , we obtain @xmath143 mev for @xmath144 tev .",
    "therefore , @xmath123 may fall into the very difficult regime .",
    "however , there may be higher order corrections or effects from other sources that can further increase or decrease @xmath123 .",
    "note that when @xmath28 and @xmath1 are of @xmath145 gev or above , the gluino will not decay within the detector , and the second lightest neutralino @xmath93 can not be produced in the collisions .",
    "thus , there is no production of the second lightest neutralino in colliders in such an extreme scenario .",
    "however , if @xmath28 is of order @xmath146 gev or less , the gluino can decay within the detector .",
    "it will produce the second lightest neutralino , which in turn decays into the lightest neutralino via an intermediate squark or slepton .",
    "therefore , the decay time is long .",
    "we will not go further into this low @xmath28 case .      in our @xmath1-split susy scenario ,",
    "the behavior of the gluino is the same as in the split susy scenario .",
    "once produced , the gluino is stable inside the detector or longer .",
    "the signature of the gluino as the @xmath33-hadrons has been studied in a number of papers @xcite .",
    "essentially , once the gluino is produced it hadronizes into an @xmath33-hadron by combining with light quarks or a gluon .",
    "when the @xmath33-hadron traverses through the detector , it will lose energy to the detector material , thus producing the signal .",
    "the detectability depends on the @xmath33-hadron spectrum and their electric charges .",
    "in fact , it involves large uncertainties because the @xmath33-hadron spectrum is not clearly known . also , the event rate has a large range depending on whether the @xmath33-hadron is electrically charged @xcite .",
    "further complication arises from the fact that there can be frequent swappings between various states of the @xmath33-hadron when it collides with nucleons of the detector material .",
    "another possibly clean signature was proposed to detect the gluino - gluino bound state called the gluinonium @xcite .",
    "since the gluino is stable , a pair of gluinos can exchange gluons between themselves to form a bound state .",
    "the gluinonium can then annihilate into a pair of heavy top or bottom quarks , experimentally forming a sharp peak in the invariant mass spectrum of @xmath147 or @xmath148 , provided the background can be efficiently suppressed @xcite .",
    "in the present paper we have considered an even more radical scenario than split susy .",
    "we call it @xmath1-split susy , characterized by the assumption that the @xmath1 parameter is raised together with the scalar sfermion to the high susy breaking scale .",
    "the higgsino masses are lifted accordingly .",
    "the main motivation is to solve the @xmath1 problem .",
    "we have investigated the effects on gauge coupling unification , dark matter constraints , and collider phenomenology .",
    "we have found that the gauge coupling unification is slightly worse than the split susy scenario mainly because of the change in the running of @xmath149 .",
    "nevertheless , the effect is mild . on the other hand ,",
    "there is a rather big change in the dark matter requirement .",
    "since the lsp does not have the higgsino component any more , the lsp can not be the bino because otherwise the relic density would be too large .",
    "the only sensible lsp is then the wino , with the wino dark matter receiving contributions from both thermal and non - thermal sources such that its mass can be less than one tev .",
    "the wino dark matter has a large annihilation cross section , and the annihilation into two photons is expected to give rise to a very clean and sharp monochromatic photon line .",
    "the flux is well above the sensitivity of the future act experiments .",
    "the collider phenomenology is also quite different from the usual mssm and split susy .",
    "the only possible gaugino production channels are the gluino pair , chargino pair , and associated chargino - neutralino pair",
    ". the behavior of the gluino will be the same as in split susy , i.e. , a long - lived gluino .",
    "however , the chargino - pair and the associated chargino - neutralino production channels are very different .",
    "the only production channels at hadron colliders are @xmath150 and @xmath151 , whereas at @xmath15 colliders only @xmath150 is possible .",
    "the production cross sections are in a certain ratio depending on the mass @xmath10 .",
    "no such behavior is seen in the split susy scenario .",
    "furthermore , in our @xmath1-split susy scenario the chargino has a long decay , which again is very different from the split susy .",
    "the differences are already detailed in the introduction .",
