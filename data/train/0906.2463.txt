    "one of the most important experimental result from the desy @xmath3 collider hera is the observation of a significant fraction of events in deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) with a large rapidity gap ( lrg ) between the scattered proton , which remains intact , and the rest of the final system .",
    "this fraction corresponds to about 10% of the dis data at @xmath4 gev@xmath5 . in dis",
    ", such events are not expected in such abundance , since large gaps are exponentially suppressed due to color string formation between the proton remnant and the scattered partons .",
    "events are of the type @xmath6 , where the final state proton carries more than @xmath7 % of the proton beam energy .",
    "a photon of virtuality @xmath8 , coupled to the electron ( or positron ) , undergoes a strong interaction with the proton ( or one of its low - mass excited states @xmath9 ) to form a hadronic final state system @xmath1 of mass @xmath2 separated by a lrg from the leading proton ( see fig .",
    "[ difproc ] ) .",
    "these events are called diffractive ( see @xcite for more details ) . in such a reaction ,",
    "@xmath6 , no net quantum number is exchanged and the longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath10 is lost by the proton .",
    "thus , the mongitudinal momentum @xmath11 is transfered to the system @xmath1 .",
    "in addition to the standard dis kinematic variables and @xmath12 , a diffractive event is also often characterised by the variable @xmath13 , which takes a simple interpretation in the parton model discussed in the following .    in order to compare diffractive data with perturbative qcd models , or parton - driven models ,",
    "the first step is to show that the diffractive cross section shows a hard dependence in the centre - of - mass energy @xmath14 of the @xmath15 system . in fig .",
    "[ figdata ] , we observe a behaviour of the form @xmath16 , compatible with the dependence expected for a hard process .",
    "this observation is obviously the key to allow further studies of the diffractive process in the context of perturbative qcd .",
    "events with the diffractive topology can be studied in terms of pomeron trajectory exchanged between the proton and the virtual photon . in this view",
    ", these events result from a colour - singlet exchange between the diffractively dissociated virtual photon and the proton .",
    "extensive measurements of diffractive dis cross sections have been made by both the zeus and h1 collaborations at hera , using different experimental techniques @xcite .",
    "of course , the comparison of these techniques provides a rich source of information to get a better understanding of the experimental gains and prejudices of those techniques .    , differential in the mass of the diffractively produced hadronic system @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) ,",
    "are presented as a function of the centre - of - mass energy of the @xmath15 system @xmath14 .",
    "measurements at different values of the virtuality @xmath8 of the exchanged photon are displayed .",
    "we observe a behaviour of the form @xmath16 for the diffractive cross section , compatible with the dependence expected for a hard process .",
    ", width=302,height=226 ]",
    "a diffractive structure function @xmath17 can then be defined as a sum of two factorized contributions , corresponding to a pomeron and secondary reggeon trajectories : + @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the pomeron flux .",
    "it depends only on @xmath12 , once integrated over @xmath20 , and @xmath21 can be interpreted as the pomeron structure function , depending on @xmath22 and @xmath8 .",
    "the other function , @xmath23 , is an effective reggeon structure function taking into account various secondary regge contributions which can not be separated .",
    "the pomeron and reggeon fluxes are assumed to follow a regge behaviour with linear trajectories @xmath24 , such that @xmath25    then , following @xcite , diffractive pdfs can be extracted . in fig . [ figfin ] we present the result for these diffractive pdfs ( quark singlet and gluon densities ) , obtained using the most recent inclusive diffractive cross sections presented in @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ figfin ] , the complete sets of published diffractive measurements are included in the qcd fits for both experiments h1 and zeus .",
    "note also that in all qcd fits , we let the global relative normalisation of the data set as a free parameter ( with respect to h1 lrg sample ) @xcite .",
    "the typical uncertainties for the diffractive pdfs in fig .",
    "[ figfin ] ranges from 5% to 10% for the singlet density and from 10% to 25% for the gluon distribution , with 25% at large @xmath26 ( which corresponds to large @xmath22 for quarks ) @xcite . within these uncertainties , a nice agreement between diffractive pdfs extracted from h1 and zeus data",
    "is obtained .",
    "this shows in an indirect way that data sets are well compatible and the underlying dynamics is similar in all sets .",
    ", the fractional momentum of the pomeron carried by the struck parton , derived from qcd fits on h1 and zeus inclusive diffractive data ( lrg)@xcite .",
    "the parton densities are normalised to represent @xmath12 times the true parton densities multiplied by the flux factor at @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "a good agreement is observed between both diffractive pdfs , which indicates that the underlying qcd dynamics derived in both experiments is similar . ]    then , an important conclusion is the prediction for the longitudinal diffractive structure function . in fig .",
    "[ figdisc2 ] we display this function with respect to its dependence in @xmath22 ( fig .  [ figdisc2 ] ( a ) ) and the ratio @xmath28 of the longitudinal to the transverse components of the diffractive structure function ( fig .",
    "[ figdisc2 ] ( b ) ) .     and @xmath29 as a function of @xmath22 at @xmath30  gev@xmath5 and @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "the dashed line prediction refers to the diffractive pdfs analysis discussed in this part .",
    "other curves represent dipole model calculations . ]    note that diffractive distributions are process - independent functions .",
    "they appear not only in inclusive diffraction but also in other processes where diffractive hard - scattering factorisation holds .",
    "the cross section of such a process can be evaluated as the convolution of the relevant parton - level cross section with the dpdfs .",
    "for instance , the cross section for charm production in diffractive dis can be calculated at leading order in @xmath32 from the @xmath33 cross section and the diffractive gluon distribution .",
    "an analogous statement holds for jet production in diffractive dis .",
    "both processes have been analysed at next - to - leading order in @xmath32 and are found to be consistent with the factorisation theorem . a natural question to ask",
    "is whether one can use the dpdfs extracted at hera to describe hard diffractive processes such as the production of jets , heavy quarks or weak gauge bosons in @xmath34 collisions at the tevatron . using results on diffractive dijet production from the cdf collaboration @xcite",
    "compared to the expectations based on the dpdfs from hera , a spectacular discrepancy has been observed @xcite .",
    "indeed , the fraction of diffractive dijet events at cdf is a factor 3 to 10 smaller than would be expected on the basis of the hera data .",
    "the same type of discrepancy is consistently observed in all hard diffractive processes in @xmath34 events . in general , while at hera hard diffraction contributes a fraction of order 10% to the total cross section , it contributes only about 1% at the tevatron .",
    "this observation of qcd - factorisation breaking in hadron - hadron scattering can be interpreted as a survival gap probability or a soft color interaction which needs to be considered in such reactions .",
    "in fact , from a fundamental point of view , diffractive hard - scattering factorization does not apply to hadron - hadron collisions .",
    "attempts to establish corresponding factorization theorems fail , because of interactions between spectator partons of the colliding hadrons .",
    "the contribution of these interactions to the cross section does not decrease with the hard scale . since they are not associated with the hard - scattering subprocess , we no longer have factorization into a parton - level cross section and the parton densities of one of the colliding hadrons .",
    "these interactions are generally soft , and we have at present to rely on phenomenological models to quantify their effects @xcite .",
    "the yield of diffractive events in hadron - hadron collisions is then lowered precisely because of these soft interactions between spectator partons ( often referred to as reinteractions or multiple scatterings ) .",
    "they can produce additional final - state particles which fill the would - be rapidity gap ( hence the often - used term rapidity gap survival ) .",
    "when such additional particles are produced , a very fast proton can no longer appear in the final state because of energy conservation .",
    "diffractive factorization breaking is thus intimately related to multiple scattering in hadron - hadron collisions .",
    "understanding and describing this phenomenon is a challenge in the high - energy regime that will be reached at the lhc @xcite .",
    "we have presented and discussed the most recent results on extraction of diffractive pdfs from the hera experiments .",
    "a large collection of data sets and diffractive cross sections are published , which present common fundamental features in all cases .",
    "the different experimental techniques , for both h1 and zeus experiments , provide compatible results , with still some global normalisation differences of about 10% .",
    "dpdfs give a good account of the main features of the all diffractive data sets .",
    "this is a very important message from hera that diffractive dpfs are well compatible for both experiments .",
    "of course , there is still much to do on the experimental side with large statistics analyses , in order to obtain a better understanding of data and backgrounds .",
    "qcd fits of these data will provide an interesting tool for the purpose of combining data .",
