    "the recent breathtaking progress involving precision cosmological observations , in particular of the cmb @xcite , provides rather strong evidence for a very early phase of slow - roll inflation driven by a scalar potential @xmath0 .",
    "a very common mechanism to protect the flatness of the scalar potential against radiative corrections is to invoke some symmetry , most straightforwardly a shift symmetry @xmath1 .",
    "radiative stability then requires that the potential itself constitutes the order parameter of the breaking of the shift symmetry .",
    "hence if the order parameter vanishes , the potential vanishes and the symmetry is exact .",
    "then by turning on the order parameter , one can control the potential and its possible corrections , rendering the inflationary model technically natural .",
    "an elegant suggestion along these lines is `` natural inflation '' @xcite , where the inflaton is a pseudo nambu - goldstone boson , and the potential is simply @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the axion decay constant . here",
    ", there is still a residual shift symmetry of @xmath4 . for successful inflation one needs @xmath5 , and in light of the recent bicep2 results @xcite",
    ", the axion decay constant has actually to be as large as @xmath6 to be in accord with a tensor to scalar ratio of @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath8 is the reduced planck mass .",
    "the predictions of natural inflation for such large decay constants are rather similar to those of a free massive scalar field , @xmath9 .",
    "such a large axion decay constant is challenging from the effective field theory point of view , and demands a uv completion to make sense of .",
    "specifically , we are interested in embedding such a scenario in string theory , where generically @xmath10 exacerbating the challenge .",
    "this is because in planck units , for all known cases @xmath11 with @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the volume of the compactified dimensions and for a controlled analysis @xmath14 , @xcite .",
    "scenarios providing some uv completions at various levels of rigour have been proposed in @xcite .    with an eye on string theory ,",
    "two mechanisms stick out @xcite . in the kim - nilles - peloso mechanism ( knp )",
    "@xcite , an effective @xmath15 is achieved by aligning two axion decay constants that are originally sub - planckian , @xmath16 .",
    "this requires a precise cancellation between parameters to the level of @xmath17 .",
    "recently @xcite have suggested generalizations of the alignment mechanism to more than two axions , partially relieving the tuning required in the original model , while  @xcite presented a very minimal embedding of single - axion and knp 2-axion inflation into supergravity , see also @xcite .    in dante s inferno",
    "( di ) @xcite , a generalization of the axion monodromy was proposed .",
    "the main idea was considering two canonically normalized fields / axions with @xmath18 .",
    "@xmath19 is some monomial in @xmath20 , generalizing the axion monodromy construction .",
    "a hierarchy between the decay constants @xmath21 and the energy scale @xmath22 allows one to integrate out a heavy mode , mostly @xmath20 , thus giving rise to effectively single field chaotic inflation dynamics @xmath23 .",
    "thus , the fundamental axion decay constants are sub - planckian and the entire inflationary dynamics are contained in a small region of field space of the fundamental fields @xmath24 with diameter @xmath25 .",
    "thus one avoids the need for `` functional fine tuning '' one generally encounters in the case of `` large field models '' , @xmath26 , while keeping all the predictions of such models intact .    in this note , we combine the best features of both knp and di  namely , we generate a parametrically super - planckian effective axion decay constant from fields with sub - planckian periodicity using only non - perturbative effects , while replacing the tuned alignment of knp with a simple hierarchy similar to that of di .",
    "the main tool in di is the integrating out of the mixed cosine term with @xmath27 . in our case",
    "however , @xmath19 is another axion term of the form @xmath28\\right)$ ] , which by itself still has a residual shift symmetry .",
    "actually @xmath29 can have arbitrary relative magnitude .",
    "the virtue is that first , @xmath30 suffices and there is no need for an additional hierarchy between the summands in the potential .",
    "the motion of the two axions is then kept entirely within a sub - planckian domain .",
    "second , as in di and contrary to knp , there is no fine - tuned alignment in the axion decay constants .",
    "third , such an additional axionic term supplemented by no requirements on the @xmath31 s is expected to be much easier to embed in a full string derived scenario .",
    "consider the two axion model with the potential given by v= _ 1 ^ 4 ( 1-)+_2 ^ 4(1- ) , [ eq : vrtheta ] where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are arbitrary and all decay constants are sub - planckian .",
    "the mass matrix for this system at the origin , takes the form m^2= (    cc + & + &    ) .    comparing the trace and the determinant of the mass matrix we find the exact relation    &",
    "+ + & = + +    this implies that in the limit of small @xmath34 this quantity blows - up , implying the vanishing of the smallest eigenvalue of the mass matrix , @xmath35 , and signalling the emergence of a flat direction .    in the limit of small @xmath36 the eigenvalues of @xmath37 are m_1 ^ 2=,m_2 ^ 2=+_2 ^ 4(+ ) and so we see that the mass spectrum is hierarchical , with @xmath38 .",
    "we stress that this result only relies on the the hierarchy between the decay constants and does not require any further tuning of the remaining parameters , namely of the @xmath31 s , as long as is smaller than this threshold , the expression of the @xmath39 changes to @xmath40 , satisfying @xmath41 . ]",
    "[ hierarch ] > .",
    "this simple lower limit on the allowed ratio of the @xmath31 s has the beneficial effect of allowing for an easier embedding into string theory .    to render the mass hierarchy more evident it is useful to rotate the field space basis by the matrix s= (    cc -f_r_2 & f__2 + f__2 & f_r_2    ) , such that (    c r +    ) =  s  (    c _ 1 + _ 2    )",
    "this implies the following approximate relation between the two field space basis : [ eq : fieldrelation ] r=_2-,=_1 + .",
    "we would like to emphasize here , that the whole analysis above will be exactly the same if we replace the @xmath32-term in the potential by a general positive function @xmath19 with @xmath42 and the @xmath33-term by a general positive function @xmath43 with @xmath44 in an @xmath45 region of @xmath46-values around the origin .",
    "arranging for the enlarged field range by covering the slope of @xmath19 with many terraced trenches then requires @xmath43 to be a periodic function with periodicities @xmath47 .    the relation eq .   allows us to write the axionic potential of eq .",
    "( [ eq : vrtheta ] ) as v&= & _ 1 ^ 4 ( 1- ) + & & + _ 2 ^ 4(1- ) , where @xmath48 denote subleading terms in the @xmath34 expansion . upon integrating out the heavy field @xmath49 one",
    "is left with a single axion model with enhanced decay constant given by f_eff .",
    "the crucial point is that a sufficient hierarchy @xmath50 can easily make @xmath51 super - planckian while keeping the fundamental @xmath52 . in this limit",
    "we get @xmath53 leading to @xmath54 , @xmath55 .    in table [ tab:1 ]",
    "we give three examples of sub - planckian @xmath56 leading to @xmath57 and with several orders of magnitude separating the light and heavy fields masses .",

    "namely , we generate a parametrically super - planckian effective axion decay constant from fields with sub - planckian periodicity using only non - perturbative effects .",
    "yet , we can do so without relying on the tuned alignment of knp , employing instead just a simple hierarchy of decay constants similar to di .",
    "we can see the relation with the knp setup by looking at its scalar potential v_knp&= & _ 1 ^ 4 ( 1- ) + & & + _ 2 ^ 4(1- ) [ eq : vknp ] upon rotating the field space into the eigenspace of the mass matrix , this potential can be rewritten as v_knp&=&_1 ^ 4(1- ) + & & + _ 2 ^ 4(1- ) with effective decay constants",
    "@xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 , with the latter given by f_l=. the knp mechanism then consists of tuning an alignment @xmath67 to get @xmath68 .",
    "we can see now , that our situation corresponds to a different regime of the same scalar potential which was not considered in  @xcite .",
    "first , note that our case arises if we take @xmath69 .",
    "then f_l=. our situation corresponds now to f_r_1,f__2 f_r_2 which implies @xmath70 , @xmath71 . in this limit",
    "we get f_l = f_=. we see , that our situation arises from setting @xmath72 in @xmath73 , upon which a simple hierarchy @xmath74 without any tuned alignment is enough to generate the large - field direction .",
    "the choice @xmath72 constitutes a simple discrete choice .",
    "this is different from a fine - tuning . to see this",
    ", we note that in the context of string theory constructions the linear combination of axion fields appearing in non - perturbative effects is governed by discrete topological quantities .",
    "hence , our mechanism takes the simplicity and control afforded by natural inflation incorporated in the knp mechanism  @xcite , and merges it with reduced amount of tuning from the dante s inferno scenario  @xcite which the condition @xmath74 represents compared to the knp mechanism .",
    "thus , our model may well represent the realization of sub - planckian periodicity natural inflation with super - planckian effective field range with : i ) utilizing only non - perturbative effects , ii ) the smallest number of axions , iii ) and the least amount of tuning of the input parameters .",
    "our discussion so far proceeded along the lines of 4d effective field theory . however",
    ", a model of natural inflation generating large - field directions with sub - planckian decay constants and mild tuning requirements should ultimately be embedded into string theory .",
    "therefore , we now shortly discuss the ingredients which type iib string theory with its well understood avenues for moduli stabilization , a pre - requisite for successful string inflation , supplies for axion inflation  @xcite .",
    "for the sake of concreteness , we will assume compactification of type iib on a calabi - yau orientifold with 3-form flux , which supersymmetrically stabilizes the complex structure moduli and the axio - dilaton @xmath75 at a high mass scale , see  @xcite and references therein .",
    "axionic inflaton candidates arise from the rr 4-form and 2-form gauge potentials @xmath76 and @xmath77 respectively .",
    "@xmath76 provides @xmath78 axions as partners of the khler moduli @xmath79 . here ,",
    "@xmath80 are the @xmath78 4-cycles surviving the orientifold projection .",
    "@xmath77 generates 2-form axions partnering with nsns @xmath81 in @xmath82 orientifold - odd chiral fields @xmath83 . here",
    ", @xmath84 denote the 2-cycles poincare - dual to the @xmath80 , while only the @xmath85 orientifold - odd combinations @xmath86 lead to @xmath87 axion multiplets .",
    "we now sketch two simple toy setups leading to an axion potential of the type of eq .  .",
    "first , let us consider a simple model with three kbler moduli @xmath88 and their @xmath76-axion partners .",
    "we stabilize these moduli using non - perturbative effects from d7-branes or euclidean d3-branes .",
    "assuming for simplicity a swiss cheese structure for the calabi - yau manifold , the effective action is governed by a khler and superpotential .",
    "k & = & -2 + & & + w & = & w_0+a_l e^-t_l+a_1 e^-t_r+a_2 e^-2(+ ) here @xmath89 is the vev of the flux superpotential after stabilization of the complex structure moduli and the axio - dilaton .",
    "the f - term scalar potential provides kklt - type minima for the moduli , while generating an axion potential for @xmath90 and @xmath91 of the kind of eq .",
    "after uplifting the kklt minimum to approximately zero vacuum energy . a moderate hierarchy @xmath92 provides for stabilizing at moderately large volume @xmath93",
    "alternatively , we may use a combination of @xmath94- and string - loop corrections to stabilize all or part of the real parts of the khler moduli  @xcite , while the perturbative nature of these corrections guarantees preservation of the @xmath76 shift symmetry .",
    "a complete discussion of the tuning of the parameters and stability requires the inclusion of moduli stabilization and the canonical normalization effects originating from a non trivial metric in field space . for the moment we focus only on the level of potential tuning that is achievable only at the level of w , postponing a full discussion for @xcite . choosing microscopic parameter values @xmath95 ( corresponding to an @xmath96 d7-brane stack ) , @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 , and @xmath102",
    ", we see that the kklt mechanism stabilizes the moduli at @xmath103  , @xmath104 , @xmath105 .",
    "this leads via the exponential terms in @xmath106 to @xmath107 and @xmath108 , while providing for right hierarchy of the effective decay constants @xmath109 and also @xmath110 . since @xmath103 implies a calabi - yau volume of @xmath111 , the f - term scalar potential along the inflaton direction has a scale @xmath112 which is in the right range to satisfy cobe normalization of the inflationary curvature perturbations .",
    "the actual field range of the inflaton - axion potential will depend on the canonical normalization of the @xmath113 axion as @xmath114 and so provided @xmath115 is not exceedingly small , @xmath116 , trans - planckian field ranges are attainable .",
    "an alternative setting can arise from utilizing the 2-form rr - axions .",
    "a simple setup involving lvs volume stabilization , utilizing two d5-brane stacks and an euclidean d3-brane ( ed3 ) looks like    k & = -2    & & + & & + w&= & w_0+a_s e^-2t_s+a_1 e^-g_r+a_2 e^-2(+)the first ed3 in @xmath117 fixes @xmath117 and the overall volume via @xmath118 by its interplay with @xmath119-correction parametrized by @xmath120 .",
    "then the d5-brane stacks provide a scalar potential similar to eq .   for the axions given by @xmath121 , while kklt fixing the @xmath81-components of the @xmath87 .",
    "we note that non - perturbative contributions to the khler potential arising from ed1 instantons can also generate the scalar potential for the @xmath87-axions  @xcite . in all cases , a crucial topological requirement for a string construction to reproduce an axion potential with a structure like eq",
    ".   seems to be tied with the engineering of a partially ample divisor depending on a linear combination of @xmath122 and @xmath123 .",
    "summarizing , we have shown that a combination of two cosine potentials for two axions with a simple hierarchy of sub - planckian decay constants can provide for successful large - field natural inflation with minimal tuning .",
