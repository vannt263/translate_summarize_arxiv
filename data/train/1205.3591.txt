    "as an achromat we understand a particle transport system whose linear transfer matrix is dispersion free ( first - order achromat ) and whose transfer map does not have nonlinearities of transverse motion up to a certain order @xmath0 ( @xmath0-order achromat ) .",
    "the first practical solution for the second - order achromat was presented at the end of 1970s in the paper  @xcite , where the theory of achromats based on repetitive symmetry was developed , and quickly becomes part of many accelerator designs . the way to construct the third and higher order",
    "repetitive achromats was pointed out about ten years later in  @xcite and was based on normal form theory .",
    "the capabilities of the mirror ( reversal ) symmetry for the cancellation of nonlinear aberrations were explored in  @xcite and , taking additionally into account the magnifying achromat  @xcite and the four - cell staircase achromat mentioned , for example , in  @xcite , the theory of achromats eventually came to the state when one has a set of different design recipes without a single theoretical framework and no answer to the question , if there is a magnet arrangement which will give better automatic cancellation of aberrations than those already known .    the way to create the unified theory of achromats",
    "was found in  @xcite by looking at the design of the symmetry based achromats from the point of view of the theory of finite matrix groups .",
    "this approach not only explains why all previously known designs work , but also says that there is no better cancellation of aberrations than cancellation provided by the action of finite cyclic or dihedral group ( at least as long as the linear transverse oscillations are uncoupled ) . in this paper",
    "we compare the actions of cyclic and dihedral groups using as test bed second and third order repetitive achromats with a mirror symmetric or mirror antisymmetric basic cell .",
    "note that these achromats are new by itself and were not considered before with the exception of the two - cell case , which was studied in  @xcite under simplifying assumption that the cell matrix is dispersion free .",
    "we consider the beam dynamics in a magnetostatic system which is symmetric about the horizontal midplane @xmath1 and use a complete set of symplectic variables @xmath2 as particle coordinates . in this",
    "set the variables @xmath3 describe the transverse particle motion and the variables @xmath4 and @xmath5 characterize the longitudinal dynamics  @xcite .",
    "we represent particle transport from one longitudinal location to another by a symplectic map and assume that for arbitrary two longitudinal positions the point @xmath6 is the fixed point and that the corresponding map can be taylor expanded in its neighborhood .",
    "we use that up to any predefined order @xmath0 the aberrations of a map @xmath7 can be represented through a lie factorization as    @xmath8    where @xmath9 , each of the functions @xmath10 is a homogeneous polynomial of degree @xmath11 in the variables @xmath12 and the symbol @xmath13 denotes equality up to order @xmath0 ( inclusive ) when maps on both sides of ( [ ifb_3 ] ) are applied to the phase space vector @xmath12 .",
    "we also use that the map @xmath7 of a magnetic system which is symmetric about the horizontal midplane @xmath14 satisfies    @xmath15    where @xmath16 is the mid - plane symmetry matrix . from equality ( [ two_c2_6 ] ) , time - independence , energy conservation and symplecticity it follows that the polynomial @xmath17 in ( [ ifb_3 ] ) does not depend on the variable @xmath4 and is an even function of the variables @xmath18 and @xmath19 , and that the matrix @xmath20 in ( [ ifb_3 ] ) has the following form    @xmath21    using the representation ( [ ifb_3 ] ) we can state that the map @xmath7 is a @xmath0-order achromat if , and only if , the matrix of its linear part @xmath22 is dispersion free ( i.e. @xmath23 ) and the polynomial @xmath17 is a function of the variable @xmath5 only .",
    "let us consider a midplane symmetric cell with the map    @xmath24    and let us assume that the cell transfer matrix @xmath25 allows the solution for the periodic ( matched ) dispersion to be found .",
    "if we denote by @xmath26 and @xmath27 the initial conditions for the periodic cell dispersion and its derivative respectively , then the cell transfer matrix can be represented in the form    @xmath28    where the matrix @xmath29 is dispersion - free and its @xmath30 upper left block @xmath31 coincides with the corresponding block of the matrix @xmath25 , and the matrix @xmath32 can be expressed in the form of a lie operator as follows    @xmath33    using the dispersion decomposition ( [ two_c_3 ] ) the cell transfer map ( [ two_c_1 ] ) can be brought into the form    @xmath34    with @xmath35 .",
    "let us now turn our attention to the special features of the dispersion decompositions of cells with symmetries .",
    "the matrix of a system which is mirror symmetric about the @xmath36 plane to the original system is given by    @xmath37    where @xmath38 is the reversion transformation matrix , and the matrix of the system which is mirror antisymmetric about the @xmath36 plane to the original system ( reversed and then rotated by @xmath39 around the longitudinal axis ) is given by    @xmath40    where @xmath41 .",
    "let us consider a mirror symmetric cell where the system with the transfer matrix @xmath22 is followed by its reversed image and let us assume that the @xmath42 element of the matrix @xmath22 is not equal to zero .",
    "then the cell transfer matrix @xmath43 allows dispersion decomposition ( [ two_c_3 ] ) with @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the equality @xmath45 is an remarkable property , because from it follows the commutation relation    @xmath46    which is very important for all our further considerations .",
    "the dispersion decomposition ( [ two_c_3 ] ) is also applicable to the mirror antisymmetric cell , if one assumes that @xmath47 and takes @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "the commutation relation in this case is the relation @xmath50 .",
    "let us consider a system constructed by a repetition of @xmath51 identical cells and let us assume that the cell matrix @xmath25 allows dispersion decomposition . then , using representation ( [ two_c2_1 ] ) for the cell map @xmath52 , the map of the repetitive @xmath51-cell system can be expressed as follows    @xmath53    @xmath54    in this representation the aberration functions @xmath55 and @xmath56 are given by the following formulas    @xmath57    @xmath58    where the binary operation @xmath59 is the poisson bracket .    if , additionally , the basic cell is mirror symmetric with the map @xmath7 of its first part given by the lie factorization    @xmath60    then the functions @xmath61 and @xmath62 in the formulas ( [ repsinglelie_7 ] ) and ( [ repsinglelie_8 ] ) can be re expressed using the commutation relation ( [ two_c_48 ] ) through the function @xmath63 as follows    @xmath64    @xmath65    @xmath66    where the @xmath30 matrix @xmath67 is the upper left block of the matrix @xmath68 .",
    "the formulas ( [ two_c_ms_2 ] ) and ( [ two_c_ms_3 ] ) are also applicable to the mirror antisymmetric cell with simple exchange of the matrix @xmath67 with the matrix @xmath69 and thus in the following we will restrict our consideration to the mirror symmetric case only .",
    "let us assume that the cell matrix @xmath25 allows dispersion decomposition ( [ two_c_3 ] ) . then , according to the formulas ( [ repsinglelie_7 ] ) and ( [ two_c_ms_2 ] ) , the function @xmath70 , which is responsible for the second order aberrations of the repetitive @xmath51-cell system , can be represented in the form                  for the general midplane symmetric cell the polynomial @xmath61 can have as much as 18 nonzero monomials responsible for the independent second order transverse aberrations .",
    "why should one expect that the polynomial @xmath76 defined by the equality ( [ repsinglelie_10 ] ) has a smaller number of them , i.e. why should one expect that the map of the @xmath51-cell system has less independent second order aberrations than the cell map ?",
    "no reason is seen for that in the case of an arbitrary matrix @xmath31 .",
    "the situation will change if the matrices      will form a finite matrix group .",
    "then the operator @xmath78 becomes the reynolds ( averaging ) operator of this group and , therefore , the polynomial @xmath76 is not an arbitrary polynomial anymore .",
    "it becomes ( as a result of averaging ) a polynomial which is invariant under the group action .",
    "moreover , the functions @xmath79 and @xmath56 , which are responsible for the third order aberrations , will satisfy the identities            it is clear that the only group which the matrices ( [ cyc_gr_111 ] ) can form is a cyclic group , and , in order to have a cyclic group of order @xmath51 and not several copies of some cyclic group of smaller dimension , we assume in the following that      besides that we assume that the @xmath85 horizontal focusing block of the matrix @xmath31 is not equal to the identity matrix , which , when combined with the equality @xmath86 , gives sufficient conditions for the existence of the periodic cell dispersion and for the property of the overall transfer matrix of the @xmath51-cell system to be a linear achromat",
    ".          what kind of group could it be ?",
    "one can check that while the last @xmath51 matrices in ( [ cyc_gr_222 ] ) are antisymplectic , the first @xmath51 matrices coincide with the set ( [ cyc_gr_111 ] ) and are symplectic , and thus must form a subgroup .",
    "so let us assume again that the conditions ( [ cyc_gr_1 ] ) are satisfied and the subset of the first @xmath51 matrices of the set ( [ cyc_gr_222 ] ) is isomorphic to the cyclic group @xmath75 .",
    "then the set ( [ cyc_gr_222 ] ) becomes isomorphic to the dihedral group @xmath87 consisting of @xmath51 reflections , @xmath89 rotations and the identity transformation , and the analogies of the formulas ( [ repsinglelie_101 ] ) and ( [ repthirdorder_3 ] ) take on the forms            from the equalities ( [ repsinglelie_10 ] ) , ( [ repsinglelie_101 ] ) and ( [ repthirdorder_3 ] ) it follows that the number of constraints which one has to satisfy ( typically , with usage of multipoles ) in order to make repetitive @xmath51-cell system a second or third order achromat is defined by the number of distinct invariant homogeneous polynomials in the variables @xmath83 of the cyclic group @xmath75 generated by the matrix @xmath31 . as an abstract object",
    "the group @xmath75 is unique and for all possible matrices @xmath31 satisfying ( [ cyc_gr_1 ] ) we have groups which are isomorphic to each other , but not all of them are conjugate .",
    "thus as groups of symmetries they can be distinct and can have different number of uncanceled second ( @xmath93 ) and third ( @xmath94 ) order aberrations , and this depends on the choice of the periodic cell phase advances @xmath95 . due to our assumptions about the matrix @xmath31        for arbitrary @xmath100 the numbers @xmath93 and @xmath94 can not be smaller than two and five respectively ( chromatic and nonlinear contributions to the cell tunes which can not be canceled only by group averaging ) , and their actual values depend on the number of resonances which @xmath100 satisfy and which are not forbidden by the midplane symmetry .",
    "the phase advances which are optimal for the construction of the repetitive third order achromats are given in the table 1 for @xmath101 .",
    "note that in the last column of this table only the generating pairs @xmath102 are shown . in order to obtain all optimal pairs",
    "one has to multiply generating pairs by all positive integers which are smaller than @xmath51 and are coprime to @xmath51 using modulo @xmath51 arithmetic .",
    "for example , for @xmath103 we have in this table the pair @xmath104 .",
    "this pair , when multiplied by @xmath105 , @xmath106 and @xmath107 using modulo 8 arithmetic , generates three more optimal pairs @xmath108 , @xmath109 and @xmath110 .    .",
    "[ tab : table1 ] the pairs @xmath111 which minimize the sum @xmath112 of the number of independent transverse second and third order aberrations of the midplane symmetric @xmath51-cell system . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]        one sees that if @xmath116 or @xmath117 , then the usage of the mirror symmetry reduces the number of aberrations left for correction by multipoles .",
    "so if the number of the independent multipole families required for the aberration correction is of concern , then it could be better to use achromats based on the @xmath87 group .",
    "but if the total number of multipole magnets has to be minimized , then achromats utilizing the @xmath75 group perform better , because in the mirror symmetric case one has to put multipoles into the basic cell in such a way that the symmetry is preserved ."
