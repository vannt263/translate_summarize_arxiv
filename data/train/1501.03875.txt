    "in the early days of equilibrium many - body simulation , intercomparisons of results from constant - temperature monte carlo with those from constant - energy molecular dynamics were indirect , requiring the conversion of isothermal @xmath0 data to isoenergetic @xmath1 data . only for hard disks and hard spheres , where temperature and energy are proportional , are the two ensembles identical@xcite .",
    "shuichi nos provided a conceptual breakthrough linking temperature @xmath2 and energy @xmath3 by discovering an isothermal canonical - ensemble molecular dynamics@xcite .",
    "he started out by including an additional time - reversible `` time - scaling variable '' @xmath4 in his novel hamiltonian : @xmath5 + \\phi(q ) + ( p_s^2/2 m ) + ( \\#kt/2)\\ln(s^2 ) \\ .\\ ] ] here @xmath6 is the number of degrees of freedom , _ including _",
    "@xmath4 , and @xmath7 is the momentum conjugate to @xmath4 .",
    "@xmath8 is a free parameter .",
    "getting to the canonical ensemble from nos s hamiltonian equations of motion requires just two more steps ; [ i ] `` scaling the time '' , multiplying all of nos s time derivatives by @xmath4 : @xmath9 then [ ii ] replacing all the scaled momenta @xmath10 by @xmath11 .",
    "nos showed that the resulting distribution for the @xmath12 is gibbs canonical distribution .",
    "starting instead with the `` nos - hoover '' equations of motion@xcite , @xmath13/\\tau^2 \\ , \\ ] ] hoover showed that gibbs canonical distribution , with @xmath4 absent and with @xmath14 _ not _ including that extraneous @xmath4 variable , is a stationary solution of the extended phase - space continuity equation , @xmath15 here @xmath16 is a `` friction coefficient '' proportional to nos s @xmath7 and the free parameter @xmath17 takes the place of nos s parameter @xmath8 .",
    "the stationary distribution function for the nos - hoover motion equations is canonical in the @xmath12 and gaussian in the friction coefficient @xmath16 : @xmath18 the relaxation time @xmath17 controls the decay rate of velocity fluctuations in a @xmath19-dimensional @xmath20-body hamiltonian system .    in order for averages using the nos - hoover equations to agree with canonical - ensemble averages",
    ", it is necessary in principle that the dynamics be `` ergodic '' , meaning that it must reach all of the @xmath12 phase - space states .",
    "of course in practice only a representative sampling of such states can be achieved .",
    "whether or not the motion equations are `` ergodic '' in this sense , _ capable _ of reaching all of the states described by gibbs canonical ensemble , depends upon the details of the underlying hamiltonian @xmath21 . for a simple harmonic oscillator hoover pointed out that neither the four original unscaled nos equations nor the three nos - hoover motion equations are ergodic : @xmath22 \\ ; \\ [ \\ { \\rm nos\\acute{e } , \\ not \\ ergodic } \\ ] \\ .\\ ] ] @xmath23/\\tau^2 \\ ; \\   [ \\ { \\rm nos\\acute{e}-hoover , \\ not \\ ergodic } \\ ] \\ .\\ ] ] these nos equations are singular while the nos - hoover equations are not .    with the relaxation time @xmath17 equal to unity , numerical nos - hoover calculations show that about five percent of the initial conditions drawn from the gaussian distribution @xmath24 are chaotic , making up a `` chaotic sea '' in the @xmath25 space which is penetrated by an infinite number of holes .",
    "the remaining 95% of initial conditions generate regular periodic toroidal solutions which fill in these holes .",
    "evidently this nos - hoover thermostated oscillator is far from `` ergodic '' [ where in this case an ergodic solution would have a smooth analytic gaussian density throughout @xmath25 space ] : @xmath26 \\ .\\ ] ]    in 1990 bulgac and kusnezov reiterated the usefulness of the phase - space continuity equation in formulating more complicated motion equations ( with two or three thermostating control variables ) .",
    "shortly thereafter they were able to use this approach to fill out the complete gibbs distribution for prototypical hamiltonian systems like the harmonic oscillator and the two - well `` mexican hat '' problems@xcite .",
    "there is no _ foolproof _",
    "test for ergodicity .",
    "the only reliable diagnostic for space - filling ergodicity is the lyapunov spectrum@xcite .",
    "if this spectrum , which measures the long - time - averaged sensitivity of the dynamics to initial conditions , is not only chaotic , but also the _ same _ for _ all _ initial conditions , the system is likely ergodic . for the harmonic oscillator",
    "this means that _ all _ @xmath27 oscillator states , all the way to infinity , will _ eventually _ occur . in nonergodic systems",
    "the long - time - averaged spectrum depends upon the initial conditions .",
    "in ergodic systems the long - time spectrum is always the same . by 1996",
    "there were three known simple types of differential equations [ hh = hoover - holian , jb = ju - bulgac , mkt = martyna - klein - tuckermann ] which were thought to produce ergodicity in a one - dimensional harmonic oscillator@xcite . in addition to propagating the phase variables ( @xmath28 ) all three included _ two _ additional control variables ( @xmath29 ) capable of generating gibbs canonical distribution .",
    "for the simple harmonic oscillator these three models take the form : @xmath30 \\ ; \\ ] ] @xmath31 \\ ; \\ ] ] @xmath32 \\ .\\ ] ] so far no one - thermostat oscillator system ( with just a single control variable ) has been shown to be ergodic though it certainly is possible that such a one will be discovered .",
    "we explicitly include the temperature @xmath2 in all of these models in order to set the stage for _ nonequilibrium _ systems incorporating both `` cold '' and `` hot '' degrees of freedom .",
    "it is worth pointing out that not all two - thermostat oscillator systems are ergodic .",
    "patra and bhattacharya showed that their very reasonable set of doubly - thermostated oscillator equations is not ergodic@xcite : @xmath33 \\ .\\ ] ]    our work here has three different aspects .",
    "first we explore the equilibrium lyapunov instability which facilitates the ergodicity of all three thermostats . in the equilibrium case , where the phase - space distribution is a smooth gaussian , the lyapunov instability embedded in that gaussian has a totally different multifractal character .",
    "we show that the equilibrium hh , jb , and mkt thermostats obey the zeroth law when coupled with one another or with other hamiltonian systems",
    ". these thermostats can provide gibbs complete canonical distribution provided that any internal energy barriers are not too large relative to @xmath34 .",
    "second we consider _ nonequilibrium _ cases , where heat flows between thermostats with the thermostat temperatures set at different values .",
    "the nonequilibrium dynamics is still ergodic but the phase - space distribution is no longer a smooth gaussian .",
    "it is instead an intimate multifractal combination of the attractor - repellor pairs common to macroscopic time - reversible , but dissipative , systems .",
    "we also illustrate the application of ergodic thermostats to kinetic barrier - crossing problems .",
    "last of all , we summarize the lessons learned in this study of three different sorts of applications of our ergodic time - reversible thermostats .",
    "the most convincing evidence for the lack of ergodicity with one thermostat variable , and its lack or presence in two - thermostat systems , is the lyapunov spectrum .",
    "here we concentrate on thermostated oscillators , the prototypical `` difficult '' case .",
    "a harmonic - oscillator system of four ordinary differential equations , such as the hh , jb , mkt , and pb sets for @xmath35 has four such exponents @xmath36 .",
    "these exponents describe the deformation of an infinitesimal hypersphere or hypercube in the four - dimensional phase space which contains the motion . shimada and nakashima@xcite , as well as benettin s group@xcite described general approaches to determining the spectrum of exponents",
    ".     plane .",
    "because a mirror reflection of the dynamics ( perpendicular to the @xmath37 axis ) changes the signs of both @xmath37 and @xmath38 the figure reveals an inversion symmetry . in the upper half plane",
    "red indicates a positive exponent and green a negative .",
    "the colors are reversed in the lower half plane .",
    "the probability density in the cross - sectional plane is a simple gaussian in @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "nevertheless the local lyapunov exponents vary in a multifractal manner throughout the four - dimensional space , reflecting their sensitivity to bifurcations in their past histories . in figures 1 - 4",
    "both @xmath37 and @xmath38 range from -3 to + 3 . ]    in an @xmath39-dimensional space their algorithms require the solution of @xmath40 sets of @xmath39 equations .",
    "in addition to a `` reference trajectory '' the equations describe the motion of an associated orthonormal set of @xmath39 comoving basis vectors , centered on the reference trajectory and locating @xmath39 nearby `` satellite trajectories '' in the @xmath39-dimensional space .",
    "the first lyapunov exponent gives the time - averaged rate at which two neighboring solutions of the equations diverge from one another , @xmath41 .",
    "the rate at which the _ area _ defined by three nearby solutions ( the reference and two others ) diverges ( or converges ) @xmath42 defines @xmath43 , while the rate at which the volume defined by four solutions and the hypervolume defined by all five of them define @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "although these exponents are typically `` paired '' for hamiltonian systems , with @xmath46      \\rightarrow \\sum_1 ^ 4\\lambda_i \\equiv 0 \\ , \\ ] ] with the sum total equal to zero , as implied by liouville s theorem , none of the two - thermostat systems is hamiltonian so that this instantaneous symmetry is missing in the time - dependent exponents @xmath47 .",
    "but because the equations of motion are time - reversible the time - averaged spectra @xmath48 _ are _ symmetric .",
    "for an _ ergodic _ system the long - time - averaged spectrum of exponents should be _ independent _ of the initial conditions . in practice , for the harmonic - oscillator system , a few hundred oscillations is time enough to indicate whether or not a chosen initial condition ( either from a grid or chosen randomly ) converges to a spectrum close to the unique long - time - averaged lyapunov spectrum .",
    "estimates of these long - time - averaged exponents , after a _ time _",
    "@xmath49 using a fourth - order runge - kutta integrator with an adaptive timestep , are as follows : @xmath50 in the hoover - holian case , and @xmath51 in the ju - bulgac case , and @xmath52 in the martyna - klein - tuckerman case .    , @xmath38 , @xmath16 , and @xmath53 as it is also in the @xmath54 plane displayed here .",
    "]    the increase in the largest lyapunov exponent with the number of quartic forces ( none for mkt , one for hh , and two for jb ) suggests , as emphasized by bulgac and kusnezov@xcite , that these terms are particularly well - suited to promoting chaos and/or ergodicity .",
    "it seems likely that sextic forces , controlling @xmath55 , would have no particular advantages and would slow numerical work .",
    "the probability densities for the three cases follow easily from the phase - space continuity equation .",
    "this makes it is easy to check for ergodicity by comparing relatively short - time estimates for the lyapunov spectrum starting out with initial conditions chosen according to the stationary multivariable gaussian distributions .",
    "the ergodicity of the martyna - klein - tuckerman oscillator was called into question by patra and bhattacharya in 2014@xcite , based on apparent `` holes '' in a @xmath56 = @xmath57 double cross - section plane , the analog of a poincar plane for a three - dimensional flow problem . to resolve this question , the subject of the 2014 ian snook prize@xcite , we chose one million different initial conditions from the appropriate four - dimensional gaussian distributions for the hh , jb , and mkt cases and determined that _ all of them _ were fully consistent with a unique chaotic spectrum .",
    "each of these initial conditions was followed for one million fourth - order runge - kutta timesteps of 0.005 each .",
    "the alternative possibility , a regular ( nonchaotic ) solution with all four of the long - time - averaged lyapunov exponents equal to zero , is easy to distinguish from the chaotic case . as an additional check the velocity moments generated by these three ergodic thermostat types likewise reproduce gibbs values for the second , fourth , and sixth velocity moments with five - figure accuracy : @xmath58    by contrast , the motion equations for a nos - hoover harmonic oscillator with a single friction coefficient @xmath59 and unit relaxation time , @xmath60 are known _ not _ to be ergodic despite their simple three - dimensional gaussian solution of the phase - space continuity equation .",
    "choosing initial conditions from this stationary distribution @xmath61 and measuring the tendency of a nearby initial condition to separate gives the largest _",
    "lyapunov exponent _ for the chosen initial condition , @xmath62 . because this system is conservative and time - reversible the long - time - averaged lyapunov spectrum is symmetric , @xmath63 , and sums to zero .",
    "@xmath64 initial conditions followed for a time @xmath65 divide neatly into two groups : @xmath66 557 initial conditions correspond to a lyapunov exponent significantly different to zero while 9443 correspond to nonchaotic toroidal solutions for which all three lyapunov exponents vanish .",
    "evidently roughly 6% of the stationary measure is chaotic ( with a positive time - averaged largest lyapunov exponent ) .",
    "the remaining 94% consists of regular tori with a vanishing lyapunov spectrum : @xmath67    . like the other models",
    "this martyna - klein - tuckerman oscillator has a four - dimensional gaussian distribution in its @xmath56 phase space which the dynamics samples ergodically . ]    in the language of control theory the nos - hoover equations control the time - averaged value of the kinetic temperature , @xmath68 .",
    "subsequent work strongly suggests that an ergodic oscillator requires control of at least two moments , not just one .",
    "such an approach requires four or more ordinary differential equations .",
    "bulgac and kusnezov@xcite as well as ju and bulgac@xcite added a fifth equation so as to be able to thermostat a free particle ( or a rotating and translating cluster of particles ) undergoing brownian motion .    .",
    "like the other models this patra - bhattacharya oscillator has a four - dimensional gaussian distribution in its @xmath56 phase space which the dynamics samples ergodically . unlike the other models about half the pb measure is regular rather than chaotic . ]",
    "four_-dimensional phase - space continuity equation shows that both the martyna - klein - tuckerman and the hoover - holian thermostats are consistent with exactly the same four - dimensional gaussian , @xmath69  .",
    "unlike the nos - hoover single - thermostat model we believe that the three two - thermostat models are _ all _ ergodic .",
    "we believe that this proposition has been thoroughly confirmed by the present work , confirming the chaos of one million independent initial conditions in each case . in view of the lack of other suitable entries in the 2014 competition ,",
    "we have awarded ourselves the snook prize for this finding .",
    "it should be noted that _ all _ of these thermostat models , ergodic or not , _ are _ time - reversible , with the friction coefficients @xmath70 and the momentum @xmath38 simply changing sign if the time - ordered sequence of coordinate values @xmath71 is reversed . for this reason the time - averaged lyapunov spectrum is symmetric , with @xmath72 . despite the simple analytic nature of the phase - space distribution , the chaos implied by a positive @xmath73",
    "engenders an amazing complexity , singular in its spatial behavior , to which we turn next .    in exploring the hh ,",
    "jb , and mkt ergodic oscillator solutions we uncovered an amazingly intricate multifractal structure most simply described in terms of the local largest lyapunov exponent , @xmath74 .",
    "the three phase - space distributions @xmath75 are all multidimensional gaussians , of the form , @xmath76 where @xmath39 is 2 for hh and mkt and 4 for jb . a closer look , using lyapunov instability as a tool , reveals the interesting structures shown for the three thermostated oscillators in * figures 1 - 3 * . for completeness",
    ", the corresponding patra - bhattacharya cross section is shown as * figure 4 * .",
    "for each of the three ergodic models we show the sign of the local lyapunov exponent , @xmath74 at the location @xmath54 .",
    "the plots are analogous to a poincar section for the more usual three - dimensional flows . at the equilibrium , @xmath77 ,",
    "these instability plots can be generated in either of two ways : [ i ] whenever a @xmath54 trajectory comes close to @xmath78 plot the sign of the corresponding lyapunov exponent at the location @xmath27 ; [ ii ] starting at @xmath54 integrate _ backwards _ in time for several hundred thousand timesteps , storing the backward trajectory .",
    "then process the reversed trajectory data in the forward direction , with lyapunov instability controlling a nearby constrained satellite trajectory , finding the local lyapunov exponent at the chosen endpoint location @xmath54 .",
    "it turns out that these two methods are roughly comparable in cost .",
    "the second method has the advantage of providing more detail in regions where the measure is small .",
    "the precision shown in figures 1 - 4 can be generated in simulations taking a day or two on a single processor .",
    "method [ ii ] above , reversing a stored trajectory , is particularly well - suited to parallel simulations .",
    "the figures use color to indicate the sign of the local exponent .",
    "these cross sections have a fractal look .",
    "in fact they are .",
    "the reason for this was pointed out in our paper with dennis isbister@xcite . as the `` past '' history of a point",
    "is being generated , backward from the `` present '' , `` bifurcations '' , where the direction of the trajectory is uncertain at the level of the numerical work limit the trustworthy scale of the lyapunov exponent when the stored integration is reversed , going forward in time .",
    "for the megapixel details shown in figures 1 - 4 a few hundred thousand fourth - order ( or fifth - order or adaptive ) runge - kutta timesteps suffice for reliable results at the resolution of the plotted sections .",
    "more detail can always be generated , at a cost exponential in the number of significant figures , by reducing the numerical error of the trajectory integration .",
    "the cross sections shown in the figures have inversion symmetry . as the source of this symmetry",
    "is not so obvious let us describe it .",
    "consider a solution of the equations of motion going forward in time , @xmath79  .",
    "viewed simultaneously in a mirror perpendicular to the @xmath37 axis an observor sees @xmath80 .",
    "evidently there is an inversion symmetry , with exactly the _ same _ lyapunov exponent at two different values of @xmath27 : @xmath81 this observation saves a factor of two in computer time .",
    "the two - dimensional cross sections where both of the friction coefficients vanish , @xmath82 are the starting points for the backward integrations .",
    "the figures indicate the magnitude of the largest lyapunov exponent obtained at the original starting point from a reversed trajectory , with red positive and green negative as the local exponents varies with position .",
    "this is the case for positive @xmath37 .",
    "the colors are reversed for negative coordinate values in order to eliminate the discontinuity that would otherwise occur at vanishing @xmath37 .    as is usual the fluctuations in @xmath74 are an order of magnitude larger than its long - time - averaged value .",
    "the variation of the local lyapunov exponent is not quite continuous .",
    "if the local exponent is plotted along a line in the @xmath27 plane there are occasional jumps , present on all scales , in the exponent value .",
    "the fractal dimension accounts for the variation of the jump magnitudes as a function of resolution . in the mkt",
    "case@xcite the data along such a line gave a fractal dimension of 1.69 rather than 1.00 .",
    "studies of the jumps along such lines reveal their fractal structure , seen here for the first time in two dimensions .",
    "all three of the two - thermostat hh , jb , and mkt models for heat - bath control of a harmonic oscillator are ergodic , because of this it was a complete surprise that patra and bhattacharya s control of both the kinetic and the configurational@xcite oscillator temperatures , using two thermostat variables , was unsuccessful , leading to a mix of regular and chaotic solutions .",
    "their model was : @xmath83 \\ .\\ ] ] the stationary phase - space distribution function for the pb equations is the same as that characterizing the hh and mkt models : @xmath84 but unlike the hh and mkt equations the patra - bhattacharya model _ fails _ the lyapunov - exponent test for ergodicity .",
    "about half the initial conditions chosen from the four - dimensional gaussian distribution give regular rather than chaotic solutions .",
    "although controlling _ coordinate _ moments like @xmath85 may seem unphysical landau and lifshitz showed ( in the 1951 russian edition of their _ statistical physics _ ) that what later came to be termed a `` configurational temperature''@xcite , based on a mean - squared force , can be derived from gibbs canonical distribution .",
    "a single integration by parts , in the canonical ensemble , relates the mean - squared force to the curvature of the potential through the temperature @xmath2 : @xmath86e^{-{\\cal h}/kt}dq \\equiv \\int [ \\ ( \\nabla{\\cal h})^2 \\ ] e^{-{\\cal h}/kt}dq \\ .\\ ] ] so control of @xmath87 can be viewed as regulating the fluctuations in the _ forces_. this concept is more appealing than coordinate control .",
    "but the lack of a physical `` thermometer '' capable of measuring force - based temperature is a disabling disadvantage of configurational temperature .",
    "the possibility of divergent or negative values of the instantaneous configurational temperature are further caution flags .",
    "the campisi `` thermostat '' is an example of both defects : @xmath88 formally , campisi dynamics is consistent with a gaussian momentum distribution .",
    "although at first glance appealing , this simple model exhibits a _",
    "negative _ configurational temperature , @xmath89 , in one dimension and a divergent one in two@xcite .",
    "disagreement between the kinetic and configurational temperatures is a clear violation of the zeroth law of thermodynamics , to which we turn next .",
    "to what extent do these minimalistic thermostats , described by one or two additional control variables , exhibit the characteristic properties of macroscopic thermal baths ?",
    "an essential characteristic of such baths is their consistency with the zeroth law of thermodynamics .",
    "two `` good '' thermal baths , both at a temperature @xmath2 , should , when coupled together or to another canonical equilibrium system at the same temperature @xmath2 , remain at that common temperature without modifying gibbs equilibrium distribution in either bath or in another equilibrium system .    for our thermostated oscillators",
    "this desirable property can be tested by coupling _",
    "pairs _ of heat baths together with a simple hookes - law spring .",
    "the modification of the equations of motion for oscillator number 1 and oscillator number 2 , both at unit temperature , are as follows : @xmath90    it is easy to verify that the two nos - hoover oscillators , coupled together by a spring , have nonergodic solutions , corresponding to a six - dimensional analog of the tori making up most of the single - oscillator phase space .",
    "one such solution occurs with initial values of the two oscillator momenta @xmath91 .",
    "accordingly we restrict our detailed investigation to the three ergodic two - thermostat heat baths to see whether or not they can obey the zeroth law .",
    "all the six combinations of like and unlike _ pairs _ of ergodic two - thermostat oscillators :    [ hh+hh , hh+jb , hh+mkt , jb+jb , jb+mkt , mkt+mkt ] , +    provide chaotic eight - dimensional regions in phase space with symmetric lyapunov spectrum .",
    "this symmetry implies ergodicity .",
    "* figure 5 * shows both the spectra and the spectral sums ( which give the growth rates of phase - space hyperspheres as functions of their dimensionality ) .",
    "even though there are relatively small but significant differences between the hh , jb , and mkt lyapunov exponents pairing _ any two _ of these systems together ( with a hookes - law spring ) gives no indication of the dissipation which would result if one phase - space bath were to grow at the expense of the other .",
    "we conclude from these six examples that the hh , jb , and mkt heat baths _ all _ obey the zeroth law of thermodynamics , quite a good outcome for dynamical systems which represent a thermodynamic heat bath with the low cost of only four phase - space dimensions .",
    "the largest lyapunov exponent in these eight - dimensional problems varies from 0.20 for two coupled mkt oscillators to 0.23 for two coupled jb oscillators .",
    "the exponent for two hh oscillators lies in between .",
    "evidently the quartic forces in the ju - bulgac and hoover - holian thermostats are slightly more effective in promoting chaos than are the cubic martyna - klein - tuckerman forces .",
    "this same conclusion follows from the time required to generate the structures seen in figures 1 - 4 .",
    "the additional chaos comes at the ( rather small ) price of an increased stiffness in the differential equations .",
    "if any of the three ergodic thermostats were not ergodic we would expect to see a dissipative strange attractor result in coupling it to an ergodic heat bath . in all six pairings of the equilibrium ergodic thermostats",
    "there is no evidence of dissipation or reduced phase - space dimensionality .",
    "evidently all three @xmath70 thermostats are good heat baths from the standpoint of the zeroth law of thermodynamics .",
    "coupling pairs of thermostated oscillators with a harmonic coupling reveals that all three of the ergodic models @xmath92 hh , jb , mkt @xmath93 remain ergodic when coupled and also provide the complete canonical distribution .",
    "the similar equilibrium behavior of the hh , jb , and mkt thermostats suggests a further comparison for simple heat - flow problems in which two coupled thermostats have _ different _ temperatures , leading to hot - to - cold heat flow and dissipation .",
    "dissipation is reflected in phase space by the formation of strange attractors with a fractional dimensionality reduced below the equilibrium value . in the linear - response regime",
    "the six two - bath possibilities must necessarily agree with green and kubo s theory as all the two - constant heat baths reproduce gibbs canonical @xmath27 distribution at equilibrium .",
    "let us be adventurous and treat instead the relatively far - from - equilibrium coupling of two thermostats with thermostat 1 at half the temperature of thermostat 2 : @xmath94 just as before all the masses , force constants , and relaxation times are chosen equal to unity .",
    "the far - from - equilibrium lyapunov data corresponding to the nine combinations of thermostats , with temperatures of 1 and 2 , are shown in * figure 6 * , both individually and as sums .",

    "closer to equilibrium , with cold and hot temperature of 1.0 and 1.1 , all nine thermostat combinations have a lyapunov sum of order -0.01 while temperatures of 1.0 and 2.0 provide dissipative sums in the range from -0.20 to -0.30 .",
    "compare * figures 6 and 7*. just as in heat conduction according to fourier s law , we would expect a linear - response dissipation _",

    "this set of ergodic thermostats represents a good toolkit for simulations with a few degrees of freedom as it gives an idea of the dependence of dissipation on the chosen form of the thermostat . with many degrees of freedom , where ergodicity is not an issue",
    "[ poincar recurrence takes forever so that the size of fluctuations determines the usefulness of the results ] any of these thermostats , as well as the single thermostat nos - hoover model , are likely equally useful .",
    "we have considered two _ nonergodic _ time - reversible thermostats , the patra - bhattacharya and nos - hoover , which reproduce the specified kinetic temperature but do not reproduce all of gibbs canonical distribution . when the pb or nh thermostats are coupled to the hh , jb , or mkt thermostats two qualitatively different results occur : [ 1 ] a dissipative strange attractor in the case of the pb model and [ 2 ] a conservative integer - dimensional chaotic sea when coupled to the hamiltonian - based nos - hoover oscillator .",
    "these results are similar for each of the three ergodic thermostats . in the pb case",
    "the dissipation is an indicator of the nonhamiltonian nature of the dynamics .",
    "any of the ergodic thermostats , hoover - holian , ju - bulgac , martyna - klein - tuckerman , can be used successfully in both equilibrium and nonequilibrium simulations .",
    "the first two of these can also be applied in nonequilibrium simulations where it is desired to specify the kinetic temperature of selected degrees of freedom .",
    "though there is no problem in solving the mkt equations for nonequilibrium problems brad holian pointed out long ago@xcite that this thermostat fails to return its target temperature due to the nonzero correlation linking the two mkt friction coefficients , @xmath114 .",
    "this relatively thorough investigation of ergodicity , based on one million independent initial conditions , should settle ( at least from the numerical , as opposed to analytical , viewpoint ) the question of the ergodicity of the martyna - klein - tuckerman oscillator .",
    "the apparent `` holes '' in that oscillator s cross section are still a small `` puzzle '' .",
    "a second such `` puzzle '' is the nature of the local lyapunov exponents .",
    "their intricate multifractal lyapunov structure is well concealed within an innocent gaussian distribution .    from the standpoint of dynamical - systems",
    "theory ( as opposed to thermodynamics ) we wish to emphasize the amazing nature of the chaos hidden within the simple ergodic gaussian distributions .",
    "the smoothness of the distributions and the good convergence of their moments conceals the fractal nature of their chaos , as shown in figure 1 through 3 .",
    "we recommend all three systems for further studies .",
    "the @xmath115 plane is only a single choice among the many possible . despite their fractal nature",
    "the cross - sectional values are well - behaved , accessible , and reproducible from the numerical standpoint .",
    "it is encouraging for the future that work originally chosen to settle some ergodicity questions turned out to generate a swarm of other problems still needing more detailed understanding .",
