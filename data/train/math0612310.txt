    "the part of the discriminant , consisting of irreducible curves on @xmath1 with only isolated singularities , splits into the union of _ equisingular families _ ( _ esf _ )",
    "@xmath3 , that is , into the varieties of irreducible curves @xmath4 having exactly @xmath5 isolated singular points of types @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "if , , @xmath7 a hyperplane divisor , we simply write for the variety of irreducible plane curves of degree @xmath8 with @xmath5 singularities of the prescribed types .",
    "we focus on the following geometric problems which have been of interest to algebraic geometers since the early 20th century but which are still widely open in general :    * a. existence problem * : is @xmath3 non - empty , that is , does there exist a curve with the given collection of singularities ?",
    "in particular , the question about the minimal degree of a plane curve having a given singularity is of special interest .    *",
    "b. t - smoothness problem * : if @xmath3 is non - empty , is it smooth and of the expected dimension ( expressible via local invariants of the singularities ) ?",
    "more precisely , let have singular points @xmath9 of types @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "we say that the family @xmath3 is _ t - smooth _ at @xmath11 if , for every @xmath12 , the germ at @xmath11 of the family of curves with a singular point of type @xmath13 in a neighbourhood of @xmath14 is smooth and has the expected dimension ( to be explained later ) , and , furthermore , all these @xmath5 germs intersect transversally at @xmath11 ( whence the name t - smooth ) .    * c. irreducibility problem * : is @xmath3 irreducible ?",
    "* d. deformation problem * : what are the adjacency relations of esf in the discriminant ?",
    "in other words , which simultaneous deformations of the singularities of can be realized by a variation of @xmath15 in @xmath2 ?",
    "in fact , this question is closely related to problem b. for instance , for , the t - smoothness of for analytic singularities @xmath10 is equivalent to the linear system @xmath16 inducing a joint versal deformation of all singular points of any member .",
    "similarly , the t - smoothness of esf for semiquasihomogeneous topological singularities @xmath10 implies that the independence of simultaneous `` lower '' ( w.r.t .  the newton diagram ) deformations of the singularities of ( see section [ sec : indep ] ) .",
    "of course , the same questions can be posed for , the variety of reduced ( but not necessarily irreducible ) curves with given singularities .",
    "no complete solution to the above problems is known , except for the case of plane nodal curves . however , in this overview article we demonstrate that the approach using deformation theory and cohomology vanishing ( developed by the authors of this article over the last ten years ) enables us to obtain reasonably proper sufficient conditions for the affirmative answers to the problems stated .",
    "more precisely , we intend to give sufficient conditions for a positive answer to the above questions which are    * _ numerical _ , that is , presented in the form of inequalities relating numerical invariants of the surface , the linear system , and the singularities , * _ universal _ , that is , applicable to curves in any ample linear system with any number of arbitrary singularities , and * _ asymptotically proper _ ( see the definition below ) .",
    "we should like to comment on the latter in more detail .",
    "let with a given divisor ( e.g. , if ) .",
    "then the known general restrictions to the singular points of a curve read as upper bounds to some total singularity invariants by a quadratic function in @xmath8 . as an example , consider the bound obtained by the genus formula for irreducible curves , @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the difference between the arithmetic genus and the geometric genus of @xmath11 imposed by the singularity @xmath13 .",
    "sufficient conditions for the  regular \" properties of esf appear in a similar form as upper bounds to total singularity invariants by a linear or quadratic function of the parameter @xmath8 . in this sense",
    "we speak of _ linear _ , or _",
    "quadratic _ sufficient conditions , the latter revealing the relevant asymptotics .",
    "furthermore , among the quadratic sufficient conditions we emphasize on _ asymptotically proper _ ones .",
    "we say that the inequality @xmath19 with @xmath20 a local invariant of singularities , is an _ asymptotically proper _ sufficient condition for a regular property ( such as non - emptiness , smoothness , irreducibility ) of esf , if    1 .",
    "for arbitrary @xmath21 and @xmath6 it provides the required property of the esf @xmath22 , 2 .",
    "there exists an absolute constant such that , for each singularity type @xmath23 , there is an infinite sequence of growing integers @xmath24 and a ( maybe , empty ) finite collection of singularities @xmath25 satisfying @xmath26 such that the esf @xmath27 does not have that regular property .",
    "if in ( 2 ) , we speak of an _ asymptotically optimal _ sufficient condition .    in less technical terms , we say that a condition is asymptotically optimal ( resp .",
    "proper ) if the necessary and the sufficient conditions for a regularity property coincide ( resp .",
    "coincide up to multiplication of the right - hand side with a constant ) if @xmath5 and @xmath8 go to infinity .",
    "_ t - smoothness .",
    "_ already the italian geometers @xcite noticed that it is possible to express the t - smoothness of the variety of plane curves with fixed number of _ nodes _ ( @xmath28-singularities ) and _ cusps _ ( @xmath29-singularities ) infinitesimally .",
    "the problem was historically called the _",
    "`` completeness of the characteristic linear series of complete continuous systems '' _ ( of plane curves with nodes and cusps ) .",
    "best known is certainly severi s @xcite result saying that each non - empty variety of plane nodal curves is t - smooth .",
    "but for more complicated singularities ( beginning with cusps ) there are examples of irreducible curves where the t - smoothness fails ( see below ) .",
    "that is , ether the esf is non - smooth or its dimension exceeds the one expected by subtracting the number of ( closed ) conditions imposed by the individual singularities from the dimension @xmath30 of the variety of all curves of degree @xmath8 . in this context , each node imposes exactly one condition .",
    "this may be illustrated as follows : a plane curve has a node at the origin iff the 1-jet of @xmath31 vanishes ( @xmath32three closed conditions ) and the 2-jet is reduced ( @xmath32one open condition ) .",
    "allowing the node to move ( in @xmath33 ) reduces the number of closed conditions by two .",
    "similarly , it can be seen that each cusp imposes two conditions .",
    "various sufficient conditions for t - smoothness were found .",
    "the classical result is that the variety  of irreducible plane curves of degree @xmath8 with @xmath34 nodes and @xmath35 cusps as only singularities is t - smooth , that is , smooth of dimension , if @xmath36 for arbitrary singularities , several generalizations and extensions of ( [ k<3d ] ) were found @xcite .",
    "all of them are of the form that the sum of certain invariants of the singularities is bounded from above by a linear function in @xmath8 .",
    "on the other hand , the known restrictions for existence and t - smoothness ( and the known series of non t - smooth esf ) suggested that an asymptotically proper sufficient condition should be quadratic in @xmath8 ( see below ) .    _",
    "restrictions for the existence . _ various restrictions for the existence of plane curves with prescribed singularities have been found .",
    "first , one should mention the general classical bounds @xmath37 ( for irreducible curves ) , resulting from the genus formula , respectively @xmath38 resulting from the intersection of two generic polars and bzout s theorem .",
    "if @xmath11 has only nodes and cusps as singularities then the plcker formulas give ( among others ) the necessary conditions @xmath39 by applying the log - miyaoka inequality , f.  sakai @xcite obtained the necessary condition @xmath40 where @xmath41 denotes the maximum of the multiplicities @xmath42 , .",
    "if are ade - singularities then @xmath43 is necessary for the existence of a plane curve with @xmath5 singularities of types ( cf .",
    "@xcite , resp .",
    "further necessary conditions can be obtained , for instance , by applying the semicontinuity of the singularity spectrum ( see @xcite ) .",
    "_ methods of construction . _",
    "the first method is to construct ( somehow ) a curve of the given degree which is degenerate with respect to the required curve , and then to deform it in order to obtain the prescribed singularities .    for instance , severi @xcite showed that singular points of a nodal curve , irreducible or not , can be smoothed , or preserved , independently .",
    "hence , starting with the union of generic straight lines in the projective plane and smoothing suitable intersection points , one obtains irreducible curves with any prescribed number of nodes , allowed by the genus bound ( [ genus formula ] ) , see fig .",
    "[ fig : lines ] .",
    "attempts to extend this construction to other singularities give curves with a number of singularities bounded from above by a linear function in the degree @xmath8 ( see , for example , @xcite for curves with nodes , cusps and ordinary triple points ) , because of the very restrictive requirement of the independence of deformations .",
    "the second method consists of a construction especially adapted to the given degree and given collection of singularities .",
    "it may be based on a sequence of birational transformations of the plane applied to a more or less simple initial curve in order to obtain the required curve . or it may consist of an invention of a polynomial defining the required curve .",
    "this is illustrated by constructions of singular curves of small degrees as , for instance , in @xcite , @xcite , or by hirano s @xcite construction of cuspidal curves , which led to a series of irreducible cuspidal curves of degree , with precisely cusps .",
    "note that in this case the number of conditions imposed by the cusps is more than the dimension of the space of curves of degree @xmath8 .",
    "two main difficulties do not allow to apply this approach to a wide class of degrees and singularities :    * for any new degree or singularity one has to invent a new construction , * even if one has constructed a curve with many singularities , it is hard to check that these singular points can be smoothed independently or , at least , that any intermediate number of singularities can be realized ( for instance , for hirano s examples the latter can hardly be expected ) .",
    "_ irreducibility .",
    "_ severi @xcite claimed that all non - empty esf of irreducible plane nodal curves are not only t - smooth but also irreducible .",
    "however , as was realized later , his proof of the irreducibility was incomplete , and the problem has become known later as _",
    "`` severi s conjecture''_.    for many years , algebraic geometers tried to solve this problem without much progress .",
    "a major step forward was made by fulton @xcite and deligne @xcite , showing that the fundamental group of the complement of each irreducible nodal curve is abelian ( which is a necessary condition for to be irreducible ) .",
    "finally , the problem was settled by harris @xcite .",
    "he gave a rigorous proof for the irreducibility of the varieties , by inventing a new specialization method and by using the irreducibility of the moduli space of curves of a given genus .",
    "since nodal curves form an open dense subset of each _ severi variety _",
    "@xcite , that is , of the variety of all irreducible plane curves of a given degree and genus , harris theorem extends to all severi varieties as well .",
    "later ran @xcite and treger @xcite gave different proofs . then ran @xcite generalized harris theorem to esf with one ordinary singularity @xmath44 ( of some order ) and any number of nodes .",
    "kang @xcite obtained the irreducibility of the families for @xmath45 the main idea of the proofs consists of using moduli spaces of curves , special degenerations of nodal curves , or degenerations of rational surfaces . in any case",
    "the proofs heavily rely on the independence of simultaneous deformations of nodes for plane curves , which ( in general ) does not hold for more complicated singularities , even for cusps",
    ".    _ examples of obstructed and reducible esf .",
    "_ already , segre @xcite constructed a series of irreducible plane curves such that the corresponding germs of esf are non - t - smooth : , .",
    "similar examples are given in @xcite .",
    "however , in these examples @xmath46 is smooth ( but of bigger dimension than the expected one ) . in 1987 , luengo @xcite provided the first examples of curves @xmath11 such that the corresponding esf is _ of expected dimension , but non - smooth _ , e.g.  .    concerning reducible esf",
    ", there is mainly one classical example due to zariski @xcite : .",
    "more precisely , zariski shows that there exist exactly two components , both being t - smooth .",
    "one component consists of cuspidal sextics @xmath11 whose singularities lie on a conic . for such curves ,",
    "zariski computed the fundamental group to be the _ non - abelian _ group . on the other hand",
    ", he showed that there exist curves @xmath11 whose singularities do not lie all on a conic and whose complement in @xmath47 has an _ abelian _ fundamental group .",
    "in particular , these curves can not be obtained by a deformation from curves in the first component .",
    "actually , this example belongs to a series @xcite : , , is reducible .",
    "more precisely , for there exist components with different dimensions . for there",
    "exist two different t - smooth components , as in zariski s example .",
    "in this section , we relate the esfs @xmath48 to strata of a hilbert scheme representing a deformation functor .",
    "this allows us to deduce geometric properties such as the t - smoothness or the irreducibility from the vanishing of the first cohomology group for the ideal sheaves of appropriately chosen zero - dimensional subschemes of the surface @xmath49 .",

    "existence of curves with prescribed singularities*. a natural question about the existence results for algebraic curves given in section [ sec : smoothness ] concerns a possible improvement of the asymptotically proper conditions to asymptotically optimal ones :    _ how to improve the constant coefficients in the general sufficient conditions for the existence ? _    concerning our method based on @xmath104-vanishing for the ideal sheaves , a desired improvement would come from finding better @xmath104-vanishing conditions for generic zero - dimensional schemes .",
    "for instance , from proving the harbourne - hirschowitz conjecture , which gives ( if true ) the best possible @xmath104-vanishing criterion for ideal sheaves of generic fat schemes @xmath249 .",
    "another type of questions concerning curves with specific singularities is the following : the known sufficient and necessary conditions for the existence of singular plane curves are formulated as bounds to sums of singularity invariants .",
    "but it seems that there can not be a general condition of this type which is sufficient _ and _ necessary at the same time .",
    "the simplest question of such kind is :    _ are there @xmath35 and @xmath8 such that a curve of degree @xmath8 with @xmath35 cusps does exist , but with cusps does not ?",

    "* t - smoothness and versality of deformations*. the following conjecture about the asymptotic properness of the sufficient conditions for the t - smoothness of topological esf of plane curves given in section [ sec : smoothness ] seems to be quite realistic ( and holds for semiquasihomogeneous singularities ) :    [ cop2 ] there exists an absolute constant such that for each topological singularity type @xmath23 there are infinitely many pairs such that is empty or non - smooth or has dimension greater than the expected one and .",
    "we propose a similar conjecture for analytic esf of plane curves , though it is confirmed only for simple singularities ( in which case it coincides with the conjecture for topological esf ) .    a closely related question , belonging to local singularity theory , concerns the @xmath294-invariant :    _ find an explicit formula , or an algorithm to compute @xmath295 , @xmath296 .",

    "there exists no infinitesimal deformation theory for topological types .",

    "this is known only for simple singularities ( see @xcite ) .",
    "hypersurfaces with specific singularities ( such as nodes ) attract the attention of many researches , mainly looking for the maximal possible number of singularities ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .",

    "_      * enumerative problems*. recently , the newly founded theories of moduli spaces of stable curves and maps , gromov - witten invariants , quantum cohomology , as well as deeply developed methods of classical algebraic geometry and algebraic topology have led to a remarkable progress in enumerative geometry , notably for the enumeration of singular algebraic curves ( see , for example , @xcite for the enumeration of rational nodal curves on rational surfaces , see @xcite for the enumeration of plane nodal curves of any genus , see @xcite for counting curves with arbitrary singularities ) .",
    "we point out that the questions to which this survey has been devoted , such as on the existence of certain singular algebraic curves , on the expected dimension and on the transversality of the intersection of esf , are unavoidable in all of the above approaches to enumerative geometry . the affirmative answers to such questions are necessary for attributing an enumerative meaning to the computations in the aforementioned works .",
    "we pose the problem to find links between the methods discussed above and the methods of enumerative geometry , and we expect that this would lead to a solution for new enumerative problems and to a better understanding of known results . as an example , we mention the tropical enumerative geometry @xcite , in which the patchworking construction and , more generally , the deformation theory play an important role .    *",
