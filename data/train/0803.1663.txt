    "there are more places for our data to be .        in order for the volume weighted probabilities to be physically meaningful as probabilities relevant for what we observe the universe must obviously last to the present age of 14 gyr .",

    "an important feature of the volume weighted probability distribution is that there is a wide region where the probability is strongly increasing with @xmath88 .",

    "for quadratic potentials this condition is satisfied well below the planck density .    for a realistic value of @xmath105 figure [ volume ]",
    "shows qualitatively that the two constraints of classicality and minumum age yield a restricted ensemble of histories whose volume weighted probabilities slightly favor a large number of efoldings .",
    "this can be understood analytically . since @xmath292 for the slow roll solutions predicted by the nbwf , and since @xmath293 , the volume factor @xmath286 is comparable to the no - boundary weight @xmath81 for @xmath294 , i.e. for solutions that start inflating near the planck density .",
    "hence the volume weighted probability distribution is peaked both at low @xmath180 and for solutions that start inflating near the planck density .",
    "the latter peak slightly dominates when the constraint that the universe lasts @xmath295 gyr is taken in account ( solid curve ) .",
    "we expect the effect of the volume factor on the probability distribution to be much more dramatic in the context of a landscape potential @xcite .",
    "indeed it appears likely that in some regions of a landscape potential and in particular around broad saddle - points of @xmath296 , the volume factor more than compensates for the reduction in amplitude due to the higher value of the potential .",
    "this would lead to the prediction that in a landscape potential , the most probable universe consistent with our data had a large number of efoldings and began in an unstable de sitter like state near a broad saddle - point of the potential . because the dominant saddle - points are well below the planck density we furthermore expect that the most probable histories lie entirely in the semi - classical regime @xcite .",

    "the overwhelming observational evidence for an early hot period in the universe suggests that most information from before the bounce could not get through to us in any accessible form .",
    "matter was in thermal equilibrium at least at temperatures high enough to dissociate nuclei and information encoded at lower energy scale phenomena would be wiped out . but gravitational waves whose coupling to matter is the same as that governing the expansion may not participate in this equilibrium .    but even if information could propagate from one side of the bounce to another we have to consider the thermodynamic arrow of time to discuss whether events on one side could influence events on the other .",
    "causation is generally possible only in that direction .",
    "that , for instance , is why we remember past events but not future ones .    in the trenchant analysis of the arrow of time by hawking , laflamme and lyons @xcite the thermodynamic arrow of time",
    "is taken to coincide with the time direction in which fluctuations away from homogeneity and isotropy grow .",
    "small fluctuations grow under the action of gravitational attraction into large inhomogeneities .",
    "that is order into disorder .",
    "hawking , laflamme and lyons examine the evolution of fluctuations in the extremizing solutions that provide the semiclassical approximation to the nbwf .",
    "they show that regularity conditions at the south pole imply that the fluctuations in the extremizing solutions are small there and therefore increase away from the south pole because they have nowhere to go but up .",
    "the lorentzian histories predicted by the nbwf are not the same as the extremizing solutions , but they are closely connected . in the homogeneous , isotropic case for example the curves of constant real part of the action are lorentzian trajectories in minisuperspace when the classicality condition holds .",
    "we have not yet calculated the fluctuations to these models .",
    "but when we do it seems reasonable to suppose that regularity at the south pole will imply that the fluctuations are small near the bounce and tend to increase away from it for a significant time .    assuming this result , the arrow of time in bouncing solutions increases away from the bounce .",
    "put differently it points in opposite directions on opposite sides of the bounce .",
    "it therefore seems unlikely on general thermodynamic grounds that events on the opposite side of the bounce could influence events on this side .",
    "to do so their influence would have to travel backward in time . unless intelligent aliens find some way to send information backward in time over billions of years we are as unlikely to find any messages from them as we are to find ones sent by intelligent aliens in our own future .",
    "can we say then that the other side of a bounce is ` real ' ?",
    "it is just as real as the pocket universes in an eternally inflating spacetime which also can neither communicate with us nor influence us .",
    "this situation is in sharp contrast with the causality in ekpyrotic cosmologies @xcite and in the ` pre - big bang ' models discussed in @xcite , where one typically starts with an ordered state in the infinite past and as the universe evolves , departures from this state grow in time .",
    "hence in these models the arrow of time always points forward",
    ".    however , a subset of the class of histories predicted by the nbwf has a singularity in the past .",
    "we have seen ( cf .",

    "the nbwf does not tell us whether evolution continues past this singularity , and it has in fact not been shown rigorously whether this is possible at all in any realistic model .",
    "but if evolution continues past this singularity , it is conceivable based on fig [ eta ] that the arrow of time in these histories will always point in the same direction .",

    "the nbwf measure is concentrated on a surface in phase space which in realistic models has a boundary arising from the classicality condition .",

    "causality in this set of histories would be very different from causality in ekpyrotic and pre - big bang cosmologies , where the arrow of time always points in the same direction .",
    "there is much to be done to extend these models to more realistic ones and to back up various theoretical assumptions that have been made .",
    "two extensions are of particular importance : first , relaxing the restriction to homogeneous and isotropic models would allow consideration of the evolution of quantum fluctuations whose effects could be detectable in the cmb .",
    "further , bubble nucleation , and the arrow of time could be discussed .",
    "second , as we suggested in @xcite in more realistic landscape potentials the classicality condition can act as a vacuum selection principle resulting in top - down probabilities that favor a bouncing universe that had a long period inflation and was always in the semi - classical regime .    on a technical level , going beyond the lowest semiclassical approximation that has been used here could yield more satisfactory probabilities and facilitate comparison with other measures such as the classical one developed in @xcite .",
    "a study of physically realistic coarse - grainings of spacetime geometry and the decoherence of sets of alternative histories defined by them would help back up a number of assumptions that we have made .",
