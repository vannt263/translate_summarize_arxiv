    "over the next decade , precision measurements of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) are likely to radically tighten existing constraints on cosmological models . although some upcoming experiments , , the nasa map satellite , already have their design and observing strategy essentially frozen in , many others do not , and face important tradeoffs between figures of merit such as resolution , sky coverage , frequency coverage and sensitivity .",
    "for instance , is it better to concentrate a given amount of observing time on a small patch , thereby improving the signal - to - noise per pixel , or to map a large area with lower accuracy ?",
    "the purpose of this paper is to investigate how such tradeoffs affect the accuracy with which cosmological models can be constrained , thereby providing some guidance for observers attempting to maximize the scientific  bang for the buck \" of their experiments .",
    "the approach taken with the first cmb experiments was to use numerical likelihood or monte carlo calculations to assess the accuracy with which various parameters could be measured from the data .",
    "it has gradually become clear that although such calculations are useful _",
    "post hoc _ , to compute accurate error bars once the experiment has taken place and the data set is in hand , simple and intuitive analytic approximations exist that are often accurate enough for studying the effects of design tradeoffs .",
    "for instance , it was shown that the effect of incomplete sky coverage is well approximated by two simple effects : to increase the sample variance by a factor @xmath6 @xcite , where @xmath7 is the fraction of the sky area that is observed , and to smear out features in the power spectrum on a scale @xmath8 @xcite , where @xmath9 is the size of the patch ( in radians ) in its narrowest direction . in a similar spirit",
    ", knox showed that the effect of uniform instrumental noise could be accurately modeled as simply an additional random field on the sky , with an angular power spectrum given by @xcite _",
    " = ^2n b_^2 = s^2b_^2 = w b_^2 , and we give a detailed proof of this in appendix a. here @xmath10 is the noise in each of the @xmath11 pixels , the solid angle covered is @xmath12 , @xmath13 is the detector sensitivity in units @xmath14 , @xmath15 is the total observation time , and @xmath16 is the raw sensitivity measure defined by @xcite w^-1 = 4s^2 .",
    "@xmath17 is the experimental beam function , which for a gaussian beam with standard deviation @xmath18 . ]",
    "is well approximated by b_= e^-_b^2(+1)/2 .",
    "thus early estimates of how accurately cosmological parameters could be measured based on monte carlo maps ( @xcite ) could be substantially accelerated .",
    "a further simplification was achieved by altogether eliminating the likelihood minimization ( performed say by simulated annealing @xcite ) , and computing the attainable error bars directly from the power spectrum and its derivatives @xcite .",
    "this procedure involves the formalism of the fisher information matrix ( described in detail in @xcite ) , and has now been used to study the accuracy with which about a dozen cosmological parameters can be simultaneously measured by _ map _ and the esa _ planck _ mission @xcite , going substantially beyond the obvious conclusions that it helps to increase the sky and frequency coverage , the resolution and the sensitivity .",
    "it was found that by increasing the angular resolution to fwhm@xmath19 , thereby measuring the power spectrum well beyond the first  doppler peak \" , much of the degeneracy between different parameters that had been termed `` cosmic confusion '' @xcite could be lifted , with _",
    "measuring most parameters to within a few percent . measuring polarization as well was found to improve the accuracy by a further factor of two assuming that foreground and systematics problems",
    "could be controlled @xcite .",
    "using the same method , a number of experimental design issues for both single - dish experiments and interferometers have been discussed with the attention limited to measuring the density parameter @xmath20 @xcite ( `` weighing the universe '' ) and the observability of a second doppler peak @xcite .      all the above - mentioned results focused on the link between completed cmb maps and cosmological constraints .",
    "in the presence of detector @xmath0 noise , however , it is important to pay attention also to the previous step in the data - analysis pipeline , where the time - ordered data ( tod ) is reduced to a map .",
    "handy approximations for the impact of @xmath0 noise when circular scans are averaged have been derived @xcite , and it is clear that the scan strategy ( by which we mean not merely how many times different pixels are observed , but also in what order ) has a substantial impact on the attainable noise levels in the map . it has been argued @xcite that it is desirable to have a scan strategy that is as  connected \" as possible , where each pixel is scanned through in many different directions .",
    "substantial progress has recently been made on the issue of how to analyze a given data set .",
    "computationally feasible methods are now available for reducing data sets as large as those of the upcoming satellite missions from time - ordered data to maps and from maps to power spectra and cosmological parameter constraints in a way that destroys no cosmological information , in the sense that parameters can be measured just as accurately as they could with a ( computationally unfeasible ) brute force likelihood analysis of the entire time ordered data set .",
    "a recent clever implementation of the minimum - variance method for reducing tod to maps @xcite is both feasible and lossless in this sense @xcite ( all the cosmological information from the tod is distilled into the map with nothing leaking out of the pipeline ) .",
    "a feasible and lossless power spectrum estimation has also been found @xcite for the case of gaussian fluctuations . the signal - to - noise eigenmode method ( see @xcite and references therein ) offers a feasible and lossless way of constraining parameters directly from maps as long as the number of pixels @xmath21 , as do the orthogonalized spherical harmonic @xcite and brute - force @xcite methods .      in this paper , we will adopt an approach to experimental design which combines the accuracy of these new numerical methods with the intuitive understanding of the analytical approximations .",
    "this has essentially not been done before .",
    "for instance , the published @xmath0 approximations @xcite were not based on the lossless mapmaking method @xcite , but on a straight pixel averaging which can be improved upon in many situations , and the resulting angular power spectrum of the noise was not computed exactly given @xmath0 noise , merely estimated with monte carlo simulations @xcite .",
    "similarly , the above - mentioned sample variance approximation was derived assuming a gaussian autocorrelation function @xcite , although as we will see , it is readily generalized to a signal - to - noise or power spectrum analysis . we will present a number of worked examples , using the above - mentioned lossless data analysis methods , and show how in each case , these results can be accurately matched by simple approximations .",
    "we then use these approximations to arrive at rules of thumb for experimental design .",
    "section 2 discusses the effect of varying four attributes of a map ; its size , shape , sensitivity and resolution .",
    "( for a discussion on the best choice of frequency channels with regard to foreground removal , see @xcite . )",
    "section 3 discusses the preceding mapmaking step , and how two attributes of the scan pattern ( the @xmath0 noise level and the amount of interconnectedness in the scan pattern ) affect the noise power spectrum in the map .",
    "in this section , we analyze a number of different types of maps with the signal - to - noise eigenmode method and the lossless power spectrum method , focusing on the effect of varying the map size , shape , sensitivity and resolution .      the signal - to - noise ( s / n ) eigenmode method distills the information content of a cmb map into a set of mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive chunks which have a number of properties that make them useful for measuring the cmb power spectrum and constraining cosmological models .",
    "although it has traditionally been a `` black box '' method , where all the details are hidden in the numerical diagonalization of a large matrix , we will see below that the workings of this box are in fact easy to understand both qualitatively and quantitatively by making some simple approximations .",
    "the s / n eigenmode method was introduced into cmb data analysis by bond @xcite and bunn @xcite , who both reinvented the method independently .",
    "it is a special case of the karhunen - love method @xcite , and since our focus here is not on data analysis methods but on experimental design , our review below is very brief and the interested reader is referred to other recent papers @xcite for method details .",
    "suppose the cmb map is pixelized into @xmath11 pixels whose center positions in the sky are given by the unit vectors @xmath22 .",
    "the map consists of @xmath11 numbers @xmath23 , where @xmath24 are the true sky temperatures and @xmath25 are the instrumental noise contributions .",
    "we group these numbers into @xmath11-dimensional vectors @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively , so @xmath29 .",
    "the signal @xmath27 and noise @xmath28 are assumed to have zero mean ( @xmath30 ) , to be uncorrelated ( @xmath31 ) , and to have a multivariate gaussian probability distribution with covariance matrices @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "the data covariance matrix is thus @xmath34 .",
    "the signal - to - noise eigenmodes are the @xmath11 vectors @xmath35 satisfying the generalized eigenvalue equation  _",
    "i = _ i_i . grouping them together as the columns of the @xmath36 matrix @xmath37 ,",
    "one computes a new data vector @xmath38 .",
    "these @xmath11 numbers @xmath39 are the above - mentioned information chunks .",
    "they are mutually exclusive in the sense that they are uncorrelated ( @xmath40\\delta_{ij}$ ] ) and collectively exhaustive in the sense that they retain all the information from the original data set ( since @xmath26 can be recovered by computing @xmath41 , as @xmath37 is invertible ) .",
    "moreover , the eigenvalues @xmath42 can be interpreted as signal - to - noise ratios for the coefficients @xmath39 , and sorting them by decreasing signal - to - noise , @xmath43 can be shown to contain the most information about the power spectrum normalization , followed by @xmath44 , @xmath45 , typically , the bulk of the coefficients are so noisy that they can be thrown away without appreciable loss of cosmological information , and such data compression has the advantage of greatly accelerating subsequent analysis such as likelihood computations , where the cpu time typically scales as the cube of the size of the data set .",
    "the expectation value @xmath46 generally equals a noise term stemming from @xmath47 plus a linear combination of @xmath48 , where the weights given to the different @xmath49 are denoted @xmath50 , the _ window function_. here @xmath51 is the customary angular power spectrum , and the window functions are given by ( @xcite ) w^(i)_b_^2_j=1^n_k=1^n _",
    "ji_ki p_(_j_k ) , where @xmath52 denotes legendre polynomials .",
    "@xmath53 is normalized so that @xmath54 , so we can think of @xmath55 as measuring a weighted average of the power spectrum coefficients @xmath49 , with the window function giving the weights . as the examples below will illustrate , the coefficients @xmath56 generally have the additional advantage of being fairly localized in the fourier ( multipole ) domain , by which is meant that they have narrow window functions , and this makes them useful for band power measurements .",
    "let us first consider a cmb map with an angular resolution @xmath18 covering the sky area within an angle @xmath57 from some given point . for @xmath58 , this region will simply be a ( rather flat ) disk of radius @xmath57 , whereas @xmath59 gives a full sky map .",
    "the sky fraction covered is = ^22 .",
    "we discretize the map into @xmath11 equal - area pixels which we assume to have uncorrelated gaussian noise with an amplitude @xmath10 . to keep things simple",
    ", we use a flat fiducial power spectrum @xmath60 with a @xmath61 quadrupole normalization , corresponding to @xmath62 , a ball park figure for recent degree - scale measurements .",
    "shows the eigenmodes for the case @xmath63 .",
    "some of the corresponding window functions are plotted in , and the eigenvalues @xmath42 are shown in . as we will now describe , the contents of all of these figures could have been approximately predicted without ever carrying out the full numerical calculation .",
    "let us first consider the eigenmodes .",
    "the exact choice of pixelization is clearly irrelevant as long as the pixel separation is much smaller than the beamwidth , so let us simplify the problem by considering an infinitely fine pixelization , where the eigenmodes are smooth functions @xmath64 .",
    "the spherical harmonics @xmath65 are eigenfunctions of the laplacian @xmath66 with eigenvalues @xmath67 , so multiplying by @xmath67 in the fourier ( multipole ) domain is equivalent to applying the angular laplace operator on the sphere . when the fiducial power spectrum is @xmath68 , we can thus think of the signal covariance matrix in as essentially @xmath69 .",
    "since @xmath70 , the eigenmodes are thus basically eigenfunctions of the laplacian .",
    "when @xmath58 , sky curvature is negligible and this reduces to the 2d helmholtz equation .",
    "for the circular case at hand , the solutions are well - known to correspond to bessel functions : b_m ( ) j_m(k_r ) e^i m , where @xmath71 . thus each mode",
    "is specified by some integer @xmath72 and some radial wave number @xmath73 .",
    "this is verified by our numerical results . since the discrete eigenvectors of are orthogonal when @xmath70",
    ", the combination of @xmath72 and @xmath73 will be such that the functions @xmath74 are orthogonal as well .",
    "also shows that the larger mode numbers tend to oscillate more .",
    "this reflects the fact that the window functions probe increasingly small scales ( large @xmath75 ) as the mode number increases , which is more clearly illustrated in .",
    "this is quite a general property of the cmb s / n method @xcite , and holds because whereas the signal @xmath51 generally decreases with @xmath75 , the noise power @xmath76 stays constant and eventually increases .",
    ", we will see that @xmath0 noise can in fact produce a falling @xmath76 .",
    "hovever , it generally falls no faster than @xmath77 whereas the cmb signal falls as @xmath78 , so our conclusion remains unaffected .",
    "] thus the mode with the highest s / n - ratio will probe the largest scales to which the map is sensitive , the runner up will be the largest scale mode remaining ( which is uncorrelated with the first one ) ,    the finite size of the survey places a crude lower limit on the width of the any window function @xcite : 1/ , where @xmath9 is the angular extent of the survey in the smallest direction , in our case @xmath79 ( a more careful discussion of this is given in section  [ windowsec ] ) .",
    "this limit is typically attained with the decorrelated quadratic method @xcite , whereas the s / n - method sometimes does significantly worse .",
    "we find that the mean of a window function , which we will denote @xmath80 or @xmath81 and define by _",
    "k_w_^(k ) is numerically well approximated by _ k .",
    "this can be understood as follows .",
    "if we fourier transform a finite patch of a homogeneous random field , the fourier coefficients become correlated over a _ coherence volume _ in fourier space whose size is roughly the inverse of that of the patch  this is a well - known effect in the context of galaxy surveys @xcite .",
    "the situation is quite analogous with spherical harmonics @xcite : the number of multipole coefficients that become correlated are roughly @xmath6 .",
    "there are @xmath82 multipoles @xmath65 with @xmath83 , so one expects to be able to form roughly @xmath84 uncorrelated linear combinations of them . since the s / n - coefficients are all by construction uncorrelated , one therefore expects there to be of order @xmath85 of them probing scales out to @xmath86 , in agreement with .",
    "as mentioned , a s / n - coefficient measures a weighted average of the power spectrum .",
    "as long as @xmath87 and the power spectrum lacks sharp features , this average is well approximated by the power at @xmath81 , and we arrive at the useful approximation _",
    "k.c__|_=_k , where @xmath88 and @xmath76 are given by equations and , respectively . as shown in ,",
    "this approximation is generally quite accurate .",
    "symmetries tend to cause groups of modes to be degenerate , with identical eigenvalues , causing horizontal lines to be visible for the first modes .",
    "for the all - sky case , the @xmath89 multipoles corresponding to different @xmath72-values are degenerate , and for azimuthally symmetric regions , the eigenvalues come in pairs corresponding to a sine and a cosine mode . at the opposite end , the very last modes are seen to contain even less signal than predicted by .",
    "this is because the effect of discrete pixelization becomes noticeable when the number of modes approaches the number of pixels .",
    "we have tested our approximation for maps of a garden variety of shapes and sizes , and in all cases find an accuracy comparable to that in . because it is both accurate and computationally trivial , it is a useful alternative to full - blown simulations and s / n - calculations when studying experimental design issues .      above we found that the accuracy with which band powers could be measured was accurately fit by the simple approximation given by equations and .",
    "let us now use this result to address the following question : given a fixed amount of observing time , how large a sky area should one spread it over ?",
    "it is better to scan as large an area as practically feasible , or to map a smaller patch with a lower noise per pixel ( resolution element ) ?",
    "let @xmath90 denote the power @xmath51 averaged over a multipole band @xmath91 , , a band of width @xmath92 centered on @xmath75 .",
    "how accurately can we measure the band power @xmath90 ? showed that as long as @xmath93 , each s / n eigenmode whose window function fell into this band would measure the power with a signal - to - noise ratio @xmath94 , which corresponds to measuring the band power with an error @xmath95 since the s / n - coefficient has a gaussian distribution .",
    "( these two terms correspond to sample variance and noise variance , respectively . ) from our mode counting above , we know that there are @xmath96 such eigenmodes probing the multipole band , so since they are by construction uncorrelated , the error simply drops by a factor @xmath97 when we use all of them , giving |c_this is to be compared with the equation c_ , which has frequently appeared in the literature and follows if we naively set @xmath98 in .",
    "this is of course not legitimate when @xmath99 , since is only valid when @xmath93 , which is just another way of saying that one can not measure an individual multipole @xmath51 alone when faced with incomplete sky coverage .",
    "there is , nonetheless , a sense in which can be used , with the appropriate precautions : as long as the power spectrum is smooth enough to be featureless on the scale @xmath100 , calculations assuming that we can make uncorrelated measurements of the individual multipoles with standard deviation given by will always give the right answer .",
    "for example , with this assumption , can be used to derive . also , the fisher information matrix @xmath101 , which determines the accuracy with which cosmological parameters @xmath102 can be measured @xcite , is correctly given by _",
    "ij=_(c_)^-2 c__ic__j in this case , where @xmath103 is given by .",
    "let us now vary @xmath7 to minimize the measurement error on the band power @xmath90 . substituting into gives _ ^-1/2 . requiring the derivative of this with respect to @xmath7 to vanish shows that the best choice of @xmath7 is = w b_^2 c_= n b_^2 c_4 ^ 2 . substituting this back into , we obtain @xmath104 ,",
    "so we see that this choice corresponds to making the noise and sample variance contributions equal .",
    "this choice of @xmath7 depends on the multipole @xmath75 that we are trying to measure , so which @xmath75 should be tailor the experiment for ?",
    "we argue that the natural choice is @xmath105 , the scale set by the beam resolution , for the following reasons :    1 .",
    "if one focuses on @xmath106 , using the narrow beam is like throwing pearls before swine , since one would obtain about as good results even with inferior angular resolution",
    "if one focuses on @xmath107 , the beam factor @xmath108 will be exponentially small and the resulting error bars will be exponentially large .    to obtain a rule of thumb for choosing the map size",
    ", we will therefore maximize the sensitivity to the scale @xmath109 , , where the experiment has its strongest comparative advantage over others . since @xmath110",
    ", this gives simply @xmath111 .",
    "let us translate this into a more intuitive expression . in terms of a flat band power @xmath112 , the power spectrum at @xmath113 is by definition c_= 245q^2_b(_b+1)~24q^2_b^25 . if we divide the map area @xmath114 into @xmath11 pixels of area @xmath115 , @xmath116 , then equations and together with our result @xmath111 gives n = 4fwhm^2 ~ 352q^2s^2 ~3q^2s^2 in other words , _ for a given resolution and sensitivity , it is best to cover a sky area of order the beam area times the signal - to - noise factor @xmath117_. again using , this tells us that the the noise per pixel should be of order ~2 q. since the cmb fluctuation @xmath118 in each pixel , given by = ^1/2 , differs from @xmath119 only by a logarithmic factor of order a few for typical angular resolutions and cosmological models , we arrive at the following useful rule of thumb :    * _ choose the map size such that the signal - to - noise ratio per pixel , @xmath120 , is of order unity_.",
    "thus if an experiment has a noise level per resolution element ( pixel ) of @xmath121 , it will be dominated by sample variance , and better results can be obtained by spreading the scan out over a larger sky patch .",
    "( since @xmath7 can not exceed unity , it of course still makes sense to aim for lower noise levels for full - sky experiments , such as for instance the upcoming satellite missions . )",
    "this rule of thumb agrees well with detailed calculations performed for the specific case of the msam2 experiment @xcite .",
    "above we used the fact that both noise and sample variance depends only on the _ area _ of a map to determine the best choice of map size .",
    "changing the shape while keeping the area fixed leaves the variance unchanged but affects the width of the window functions , the spectral resolution . to study this in more detail",
    ", we will now study the effect of elongating a map , returning to a discussion of how to best choose the map shape in the next section .",
    "consider a small rectangular map of size @xmath122 , where @xmath123 , so that we can neglect the effect of sky curvature .      as discussed above",
    ", we expect the signal - to - noise eigenmodes to be eigenfunctions of the laplacian , which for rectangular symmetry take the form b_mn(x , y ) ( k_x x+)(k_y y + ) , where the wave numbers @xmath124 and @xmath125 and the phases @xmath126 and @xmath127 are such that the modes are orthogonal .",
    "( we are using coordinates where the map is centered on the north pole , so @xmath128 , @xmath129 , @xmath130 . )",
    "is verified by our numerical computations , and illustrated in and , where six sample modes are plotted together with their window functions .",
    "shows that more oblong regions generally produce inferior ( wider ) window functions , but illustrates that there is also a strong dependence on whether the oscillations are mainly in the narrow or wide direction .",
    "all of this can be readily understood by considering two - dimensional rather than one - dimensional window functions , as illustrated in . in the context of 3d galaxy redshift surveys ,",
    "a mode probes a weighted average of the power in three - dimensional fourier space , and it is well - known that this weight function ( 3d window function ) is simply the square modulus of the fourier transform of the mode itself .",
    "the situation is analogous in the cmb case @xcite : in the flat sky approximation , we can replace the @xmath131 multipole space by a 2d fourier space @xmath132 , and we can compute the 2d window function by simply fourier transforming the signal - to - noise eigenmodes of , as illustrated in .",
    "shape _ of the 2d window , schematically illustrated by the ellipses , basically only depends on the shape of the sky patch .",
    "it is of order @xmath133 , so since the @xmath134 map is 16 times wider than it is high , the ellipses corresponding to its window functions are drawn 16 times higher than wide .",
    "the central _ location _ of a window function is determined by the wave vector @xmath132 in .",
    "for instance , mode c in has @xmath135 , , virtually no vertical oscillations , so its window function lies straight to the right of the origin ( the careful reader will notice that since the eigenmodes contain @xmath136 rather than @xmath137 , there should be a mirror image to the left , but this is omitted to avoid cluttering up the figure ) .    the 1d window functions plotted in and depend only @xmath75 ( which corresponds to the radius @xmath138 in ) , not on @xmath72 ( roughly corresponding to the angular direction ) , and are essentially the angular average of the 2d window functions .",
    "the width of the 1d window functions is therefore determined by how many of the concentric circles are crossed in :    * in , mode a has the worst window function , because its longest extent is in the radial direction .",
    "its spectral resolution is thus determined by @xmath139 , the narrowest dimension of the patch .",
    "* mode c has the best window function , because its shortest extent is in the radial direction . in the limit @xmath140 ( where it is very far from the origin in fourier space )",
    ", its spectral resolution is thus determined by @xmath141 , the broadest dimension of the patch . *",
    "modes like a and c constitute only a small minority , with typical modes being more like b , with comparable oscillations in the horizontal and vertical directions .",
    "for very oblong patches , the window function is a factor of @xmath142 narrower for mode b than for mode a , , it is still determined by the narrowest direction alone . *",
    "the three cases compared in are all  typical \" modes like b , but with patches whose aspect ratios are 1 , 4 and 16 , respectively .",
    "these modes are illustrated to the lower left in , and show why the skinniest patch produces the worst result .      above we saw how the window functions resulting from oblong sky patches could readily be understood in a two - dimensional fourier space picture .",
    "what does this tell us as regards the best choice of patch shape ?",
    "we want to be able to resolve all small - scale features in the power spectrum that carry information about cosmological parameters . what is this scale ?",
    "acoustic oscillations occur on a scale set by the horizon size at last scattering , corresponding to @xmath143 @xcite for an @xmath144 cdm universe , and if @xmath145 , this scale @xmath100 increases . to accurately measure the power spectrum , we clearly need more than one measurement per doppler peak , but a spectral resolution @xmath146 would appear adequate for crude measurements , and @xmath147 should retain virtually all cosmological information .",
    "the main exception is on the very largest scales , where the late integrated sachs - wolfe effect can cause variations on a scale @xmath148 if the universe has curvature of a non - zero cosmological constant .",
    "however , this is rather irrelevant to our present discussion , which is geared towards ground and balloon based experiments , since cobe has already measured these low multipoles with high spectral resolution , to near the cosmic - variance limit , and these measurements are unlikely to be improved before the map mission flies .",
    "thus although some speculative models ( , @xcite ) introduce sharp features into the power spectrum , a spectral resolution @xmath149 appears sufficient for constraining the parameters of both standard inflationary and defect - based cosmologies .",
    "above we saw that the signal - to - noise eigenmodes had @xmath146 for round regions of diameter @xmath150 . by eliminating ringing",
    ", the maximum - resolution method @xcite can reduce this to @xmath151 , but there are fewer uncorrelated modes that are this narrow , so to avoid increasing the sample variance , it is preferable to not go below this map size .",
    "we also saw that the picture was more complex for oblong regions .",
    "although there are typically a small number of modes ( which used alone would give a large sample variance ) with narrow window functions like case c , the bulk of the modes have their width determined by the narrowest direction of the survey .",
    "it is easy to see that a skinny mode centered at @xmath152 will have a window function width @xmath153^{1/2}$ ] , so if we use all the modes ( which is necessary to attain the sample variance from section  [ sizesec ] ) , then @xmath154 gets averaged over @xmath155 and we obtain ~. this means that if the patch is fairly oblong @xmath156 , then @xmath141 becomes completely irrelevant to the resolution , which is determined only by the narrowest direction , @xmath139 .",
    "thus although it is possible to extract some useful constraints from even narrower maps , we conclude our shape discussion with the following rule of thumb :    * _ avoid maps that are skinnier than a few degrees in the narrowest direction .",
    "_    we have seen that as long as the narrowest direction @xmath157 , the situation is greatly simplifies , since _ all _ modes will be narrow enough in fourier space to be cosmologically useful .",
    "this means that one need not worry about weeding out the widest modes , and can attain the minimal sample variance that the map area permits .",
    "the previous section discussed measuring the power spectrum and cosmological parameters from a map , focusing on how to best chose its size , shape , sensitivity and resolution . in this section",
    ", we turn to the preceding step in the data analysis pipeline : reducing time - ordered data ( tod ) to a map",
    ". our focus will be on @xmath0 noise , and how the power spectrum of the tod noise in the time - domain becomes processed into a map noise power spectrum in the multipole domain .",
    "specifically , once the shape and size of the map have been decided as above , what is the best choice of scan pattern if we want to minimize the map noise ? to what extent is it worth complicating the scan pattern to reduce the map noise ?",
    "the cmb mapmaking problem ( see @xcite for a recent review ) is to estimate the map vector @xmath27 of the previous section from @xmath158 measured numbers @xmath159 , which we will refer to as the _ time - ordered data _ ( tod ) , and group into an @xmath158-dimensional vector @xmath160 .",
    "assuming that the tod depends linearly on the map , we can write = + for some known matrix @xmath161 and some random noise vector @xmath28 . without loss of generality , we can take the noise vector to have zero mean , , @xmath162 , so the noise covariance matrix is .",
    "all linear methods can clearly be written in the form = , where @xmath26 denotes the estimate of the map @xmath27 and @xmath163 is some @xmath164 matrix that specifies the method . if we make the choice = [ ^t]^-1^t , where @xmath165 is an arbitrary @xmath166 matrix , then @xmath167 , which means that the reconstruction error @xmath168 , defined as -=[-]+ is independent of @xmath27 .",
    "in other words , the recovered map @xmath26 is simply the true map @xmath27 plus some noise that is independent of the signal one is trying to measure .",
    "we will therefore refer to @xmath168 as the _ noise map _ , and study how its statistical properties depend on the scan strategy ( specified by @xmath161 ) and the detector noise characteristics ( given by @xmath47 ) .",
    "equations and show that its covariance matrix @xmath169 is given by = ^t = [ ^t]^-1[^t][^t]^-1 if the matrix @xmath165 is symmetric .",

    "however , noise correlations manifested as off - diagonal elements in @xmath170 may also appear undesirable , and one might fear that there is a tradeoff between these two evils that muddles the issue as to how to choose @xmath165 . fortunately , this is not the case .",
    "@xmath171 is the best possible method in the sense that the map it produces can be shown @xcite to retain all the cosmological information from the tod , even if the map is non - gaussian , and it has also been shown to be numerically feasible @xcite , so there is no need to settle for anything less .",
    "if for instance wiener - filtered or maximum - entropy filtered maps are desired , these can always be computed directly from @xmath26 afterwards , without recourse to the tod .",
    "although direct application of equations and using a standard linear algebra package gives what we need ( @xmath26 and @xmath170 ) in principle , this would be too slow to be useful in practice , since @xmath47 is an @xmath173 matrix and @xmath158 is typically between @xmath174 and @xmath175 @xcite .",
    "fortunately , this can be remedied by some numerical tricks . a useful way of implementing the mapmaking algorithm described above was recently presented by wright @xcite .",
    "it handles the inversion implicit in by solving for the vector @xmath26 iteratively , with the conjugate gradient method , never computing @xmath170 , which means that one avoids inverting large matrices explicitly . in the present paper ,",
    "we specifically need the map noise covariance matrix @xmath170 , to compute the noise power .",
    "below we present tricks enabling explicit calculation of @xmath170 for huge data sets as long as the number of pixels @xmath176 , which should prove useful for some upcoming ground and balloon based cmb experiments .",
    "the tricks make use of the fact that all three of the huge matrices involved have very special properties : @xmath161 is extremely sparse , and @xmath47 and @xmath165 can be replaced by matrices that are both band - diagonal and circulant .",
    "our treatment is slightly more general than wright s fourier approach @xcite in that it treats discreteness and edge effects exactly and is applicable also if data blocks are too short to allow one to pre - whiten the noise exactly .      as this and the subsequent section are rather technical , the reader not interested in data analysis _ per se _",
    "is encouraged to jump directly to section  [ fourscansec ] .",

    "we saw that when @xmath196 is simply the differencing matrix , @xmath196 and @xmath197 are indeed band - diagonal .",
    "but what about @xmath165 , the inverse of @xmath197 ?",
    "shows the spectral function @xmath198 of @xmath199 and @xmath197 when all three types of noise are present . for this case , @xmath200 for all @xmath155 , so its inverse , which is the spectral function of @xmath165 , will be smooth and well - behaved , giving a band - diagonal @xmath165 as desired . if there is no brown noise component , however , we will have @xmath201 for @xmath202 ( lower panel ) , so the spectral function of @xmath165 blows up near the origin and @xmath165 will have inconvenient non - zero elements arbitrarily far from the diagonal .",
    "( differencing multiplies by @xmath203 near the origin , so this `` overkill '' of @xmath0 noise produces an @xmath165-matrix with @xmath0 noise . ) this can be remedied by a better choice of @xmath196 , whose spectral function exactly neutralizes the 1/f - noise at the origin . a simple choice that does this is the @xmath196 whose spectral function is @xmath204 , and is a  half - difference \" in the sense that doing it four times is equivalent to double differencing , which we saw multiplied the spectral function by @xmath205 .",
    "the explicit convolution filter is plotted in , and is seen to keep both white and @xmath0 noise close to diagonal .",
    "another attractive option @xcite is to _ prewhiten _ the data , by chosing the high - pass filter @xmath196 to have a spectral function that is the inverse square root of the spectral function of @xmath199 .",
    "this reduces @xmath199 ( and hence also @xmath165 ) to the identity matrix , so @xmath206 is the only circulant matrix remaining in .",
    "we remind the reader that all choices of @xmath196 produce the exact same answer , so the choice is merely one of numerical convenience .",
    "the choice of @xmath196 makes very little difference in practice as well , as long as one ensures that the resulting spectral function of @xmath197 is smooth and non - zero , since multiplying the various circulant matrices together in is virtually instantaneous compared to the other numerical steps .",
    "let us consider a square sky patch of diameter @xmath207 , divided into @xmath208 pixels , scanned in four different ways as illustrated in :    1 .",
    "* serpentine scan : * the beam sweeps back and forth horizontally , gradually shifting downward , not crossing its path until the entire patch has been covered .",
    "this is reversed , then everything is repeated .",
    "* grating scan : * a serpentine scan is augmented with an equal amount of time spent scanning up and down along the left and right edges . 3 .   * fence scan : * two sets of serpentine scans are performed in succession , one horizontal and one vertical ( rotated by @xmath209 ) .",
    "* random scan : * the beam jumps to a random pixel after each observation , but in such a way that all pixel pairs are connected equally many times .    in all cases",
    ", we make @xmath210 observations .",
    "these simple scanning strategies span the entire range of `` connectedness '' available in real - world experiments , with the serpentine scan being the least connected one possible and the random scan at the other extreme .",
    "an experiments with disjoint strips such as tenerife is more similar to the serpentine case , whereas double - beam differencing experiments such as cobe are very well connected and more similar to the random case .",
    "a _ planck _",
    "scan strategy pattern with great circles ( pointing @xmath209 away from the spin axis ) would be reminiscent of the grating case , with disjoint strips ( in this case circular arcs ) connected together at two points ( at the poles , where they circles ) .",
    "several recently flown and proposed balloon experiments have linear or circular scans intersecting at a variety of angles , which makes them similar to the fence case .",
    "if _ planck _ points @xmath211 away from the spin axis , as originally proposed , its scan pattern would also be rather fence - like .    to be able to isolate how the features of these scan patterns affect the ability to minimize various types of noise ,",
    "let us first study the effect of white and @xmath0 noise separately , then compute some cases where they are present in combination .",
    "we first note that pixel noise strictly speaking does not have a power spectrum at all in general , since its statistical properties are not isotropic .",
    "rather , the quantity of interest is how much power it adds to our estimates of the cmb power spectrum coefficients ( the expectation value of this noise contribution is of course subtracted out to make the @xmath51-estimates unbiased , but the noise still contributes to the error bars on these estimates ) .",
    "we will therefore compute the noise power just as we would compute the cmb power , using the minimum - variance method @xcite . using a simple white noise prior",
    ", this corresponds to computing _",
    "^_ , where the matrix @xmath212 is given by ^_ij = p_(_i_j ) and the @xmath52 are legendre polynomials .",
    "@xmath177 is the covariance matrix that would result from a white noise power spectrum ; @xmath213 .",
    "our four scan patterns were chosen such that all pixels are observed the same number of times ( except for the pixels on the left and right edges of the grating scan ) .",
    "this means that if only white noise is present , we will have uniform uncorrelated map noise ( @xmath214 ) , and the simple expression in applies .",
    "this is the lowermost line plotted in . to draw attention to the simple shapes of the noise power spectra",
    ", we are not including the beam smearing effect here ( @xmath215 ) , which would otherwise make @xmath76 blow up exponentially for large @xmath75 .",
    "note that the curve is only horizontal ( as predicted by ) on the scales probed by the experiment . on scales comparable to the pixel separation ,",
    "artifacts appear ( this is irrelevant when the map is properly oversampled , since beam smoothing destroys any cmb signal on these scales ) . on scales larger than the patch size ( corresponding to @xmath216 ) , the noise power drops as @xmath217 since the mapmaking algorithm is insensitive to the monopole ( mean ) of the map  this occurs automatically when @xmath0 noise is present , as the method removes baseline drifts .",
    "( the matrix @xmath218 $ ] to be inverted in will have one vanishing eigenvalue , corresponding to the mean , which is dealt with using the pseudo - inverse approach described in the appendix of @xcite ) .",
    "the other curves in show the effect of pure 1/f - noise . note that there is no scale in the problem other than the patch size ( to the left of which the monopole removal starts suppressing the power ) and the pixel separation scale ( where irrelevant artifacts appear and we have truncated the curves ) , so it should come as no surprise that the curves are rather featureless between these two scales .",
    "( the @xmath0 knee frequency can not imprint a feature here , since it is of course only defined when there is white noise present . )",
    "the normalization is arbitrary  doubling the receiver noise merely doubles the power spectrum .",
    "the random scan pattern is seen to produce a beautiful white noise power spectrum , indistinguishable in shape from the above - mentioned white noise spectrum plotted beneath it .",
    "this is quantitative verification of the claim @xcite that a well - connected  messy \" scan differencing widely separate parts of the sky produces a map with virtually uncorrelated pixel noise .",
    "this is also seen in , which shows how correlated different map pixels are with the one in the center .",
    "numerical inspection of the covariance matrix @xmath170 shows that it is to a good approximation proportional to the identity matrix , with the mean of all rows and columns subtracted off due to the monopole removal . both the fence and grating scans",
    "have roughly ^-1 over the range of scales probed by the experiment . in other words",
    ", their angular power spectrum obeys the same power law in @xmath75 as their time power spectrum does in @xmath219 .",
    "thus although the noise per pixel ( which is dominated by the contribution from @xmath75 around the pixel separation scale , where the three power spectra are comparable in magnitude ) are quite similar for the grating , fence and random scans , the first two give substantially more power than the third on larger scales .",
    "this is because there are no `` short cuts '' from one part of the map to the other , so that large - scale drifts inevitably leak from the time stream into the spatial noise distribution .",
    "another way of interpreting this excess large - scale noise is that although the pixel may be small , neighboring pixels are correlated so that the effective number of independent pixels is reduced .",
    "small - scale connectedness helpful as well , as the figure shows .",
    "the four power spectra rank in the same order as their degree of connectedness on all scales ( the only exception being the grating scan , where the small - scale noise is raised since half of the time was spent on the side bars ) .",
    "the serpentine scan is a particularly poor performer , with a full order of magnitude more noise power than the fence scan on most scales .",
    "the source of the problem with the serpentine scan is illustrated in .",
    "the fence scan would produce correlation stripes shaped like a @xmath220 symbol if the map were made by simply averaging the observations of each pixel , as is optimal for white noise .",
    "because of the high degree of interconnectedness , however , the data analysis method is able to eliminate this striping , and the correlation region is seen to be fairly round . for the serpentine scan , however , the correlation stripe along the scan path persists .",
    "this is because , as is easy to show , the matrix @xmath163 of becomes the same as for the white noise case in the absence of interconnections , apart from removing an overall drift over the entire serpentine . in other words ,",
    "the sophisticated mapmaking method is powerless against @xmath0 noise when the scan pattern is poorly connected .",
    "the situation is seen to be rather intermediate for the grating scan : the correlation is strong along the scan path until it reaches the side bars , where it gets connected with all the other rows .      shows the noise power spectra resulting from a combination of white and @xmath0 noise , where the knee frequency is a tenth of the sampling rate .",
    "once again , the better connected scan strategies are seen to produce less noise power , although the fence scan is actually very marginally better at the smallest scales .",
    "the random scan is seen to produce white noise as usual , whereas the logarithmic slope of @xmath76 for the other scan strategies is intermediate between the @xmath0 and white cases of @xmath221 and @xmath222 .",
    "( we have omitted the grating case to avoid over - crowding this plot . ) the noise power from maps containing the white and @xmath0 components alone are also plotted here for comparison , and it should be noted that the total power when both are present is always slightly greater than the sum of these curves ( even though all noise components of course add when @xmath163 is held fixed ) , since we can not optimize for two different types of noise at the same time .",
    "connectedness is clearly desirable since it reduces the contribution from @xmath0 noise to @xmath76 .",
    "it is also useful for reducing the susceptibility to systematic errors @xcite , and makes the maps easier to analyze by making noise correlations more isotropic .",
    "however , complicated interconnected scan patterns can also create problems .",
    "they might complicate the experimental design , perhaps requiring additional moving parts which can cause systematic problems . for ground and balloon based experiments ,",
    "a strategy requiring scans with non - constant elevation can introduce systematic modulations , since the amount of atmosphere that the beam must penetrate will vary with time .",
    "the relevant question is therefore how great efforts it is worth expending to increase the connectivity of the scan pattern .",
    "shows that to accurately constrain cosmological models , we want to minimize the variance @xmath223 for each multipole . as we discussed in section  [ sizesec ] , it is best to chose the map size so that noise and sample variance contribute roughly equally to @xmath224 on the pixel scale , , at the right edge of the curves in .",
    "the sample variance scales with @xmath75 like the cmb power spectrum , which is included in for comparison .",
    "it lacks the familiar rise at the doppler peaks simply because we have plotted @xmath51 rather than the more familiar quantity @xmath225 . since we found that @xmath76 never falls of faster than @xmath77",
    "( this was for pure @xmath0 noise , and a white noise component further reduces the slope ) whereas @xmath226 , @xmath103 will be almost completely dominated by sample variance for all but the largest @xmath75-values probed .",
    "this means that the huge visual differences between the noise power spectra are in fact relatively unimportant when it comes to measuring cosmological parameters , with the only really important quantity being the power on the pixel scale , which is roughly proportional to the pixel variance @xmath227 .",
    "@xmath10 turns out to to be only 16% smaller for the random scan than for the fence scan for pure @xmath0 noise , and when we included white noise , the fence scan was actually the marginally better one ( by 6% ) .",
    "our only clearly undesirable scan is the serpentine option , which adds noise power even on the smallest scales and whose pixel noise is almost a factor of two worse than the fence and random scans ( this ratio of course depends strongly on the knee frequency @xmath228 ) .    in conclusion , it is desirable to invest a moderate but not extreme effort into making the scan pattern more connected than the technically most convenient option . for a ground- or balloon - based experiment ,",
    "a serpentine - like scan can be readily made more fence - like by moving the sky patch to be mapped further away from the equator , so that repeated scans at constant elevation will cross due to earth s rotation .",
    "likewise , a grating - like _ planck _ great circle scan pattern can be made more fence - like by reducing the angle between the beam and spin axis , and still more by occasionally tilting the spin axis out of the ecliptic plane .",
    "on the other hand , going beyond fence connectivity , where one already has nice isotropic pixel noise with good systematics cross - checks , does probably not warrant the effort unless it can be done in a technically elegant way such as for _ map _ that does not introduce new potential systematic problems .",
    "we have discussed the various tradeoffs faced when designing a cmb mapping experiment from the point of view of maximizing the scientific `` bang for the buck '' .",
    "although the traditional approach to this problem has been numerically expensive monte carlo simulations , we have taken a no - simulation approach .",
    "we found that although state - of - the art data analysis techniques such as signal - to - noise eigenmode analysis and minimum - variance power spectrum estimation are normally treated as black - box methods , their results can often be accurately approximated by simple analytic expressions .",
    "this allows an intuitive understanding of how changing the various experimental parameters affects the ability to constrain cosmological models . illustrating these causal relationships with simple case studies",
    ", we arrived at the following rules of thumb .    * * size : * for a given resolution and sensitivity , it is best to cover a sky area such that the signal - to - noise ratio per resolution element ( pixel ) is of order unity . * * shape : * it is best to avoid excessively  skinny \" observing regions , narrower than a few degrees . * * 1/f - noise : * scan strategies of both the fence type and the random type allow the map - making algorithm to substantially reduce the effect of @xmath0 noise , which makes the noise correlations more isotropic and produces a noise power spectrum of slope between @xmath229 and @xmath77 .",
    "since this is much flatter than the true cmb spectrum is expected to be , slight large - scale noise modulations are cosmologically unimportant when the map size is chosen as suggested above , being dwarfed by sample variance .",
    "the author wishes to thank steve meyer , phil lubin and john staren for asking questions that stimulated this work , uro seljak and matias zaldarriaga for use of their cmbfast boltzmann code , and ned wright , the referee , for helpful comments . support was provided by nasa through a hubble fellowship , # hf-01084.01 - 96a , awarded by the space telescope science institute , which is operated by aura , inc . under nasa contract nas5 - 26555 .",
    "in this appendix , we derive .",
    "knox first treated the case @xmath230 @xcite , and early incorrect generalizations to the general case were corrected by magueijo & hobson @xcite .",
    "since no detailed derivation has yet been published for this case , we provide one here for completeness .",
    "when the pixel noise is uniform and uncorrelated , the quantities @xmath25 ( the noise in the @xmath231 pixel ) are random variables satisfying = _ ij^2 . ignoring beam smoothing for the moment , we want to show that the effect of this discrete pixel noise is the same as if there were a continuous random field @xmath232 on the sky with power spectrum @xmath233 .",
    "this is a white noise power spectrum , since it is independent of @xmath75 , which corresponds to a dirac delta correlation function = c(, ) .",
    "as long as the pixelization is uniform and fine enough , we can approximate the integral of any function @xmath219 over our patch ( of solid angle @xmath20 ) by a sum : f()d_i=1^n f(_i ) . when performing a statistical analysis of a cmb map ( for instance a signal - to - noise eigenmode analysis )",
    ", we always expand it in some functions , say @xmath234 , so the noise in these expansion coefficients , say @xmath235 , is given by a = n_i=1^n ( _ i)n_i .",
    "for gaussian noise , the statistical properties of these coefficients are completely specified by their covariance , which using is given by & = & ( n)^2 _ i=1^n _ j=1^n ( _ i)(_j ) + & = & ( n)^2 _ i=1^n ( _ i)(_i ) when computing this covariance as if the noise where a continuous random field , gives a()n()d , and using , we obtain & & ( ) ()dd + & = & c() ( ) d + & & cn_i=1^n ( _ i)(_i ) . comparing equations and , we see that the two ways of treating the noise give the same answer if @xmath236 .",
    "all that remains to prove is to divide the right hand side by the beam correction @xmath108 , noting that the noise is added to the sky signal _",
