    "in 1916 schwarzschild introduced the first exact solution of the vacuum einstein equations in four dimensions @xcite .",

    "if a compact dimension is added to the schwarzschild metric , it describes a five - dimensional black string .",
    "analogously the kerr spacetime turns into the spacetime of a rotating black string if a compact dimension is added .",
    "the idea of compact dimensions came up in the 1920s after kaluza suggested to add a fifth dimension to general relativity @xcite .",
    "this was one of the first attempts to unify gravity and the electromagnetic forces . in 1926",
    "klein proposed a physical interpretation @xcite : the added dimension is compact , i.e. , it is curled up in itself and has a certain length , which is too small to be observed .",
    "but still the theory of kaluza and klein could not explain the weakness of gravity in comparison to the electromagnetic forces .    in the 60s and 70s",
    "the string theory was developed . here",
    "the existence of higher dimensions is essential for the internal consistency of the theory , mostly they are also assumed to be compact . + the equations of motion for test particles in the schwarzschild spacetime were solved in 1931 by hagihara @xcite in terms of the elliptic weierstra @xmath0- , @xmath1- and @xmath2-functions . in the taub - nut @xcite , reissner - nordstrm @xcite and",
    "myers - perry @xcite spacetime the equations of motion were also solved in terms of the elliptic weierstra functions .",
    "the integration of geodesics was advanced in the papers of hackmann and lmmerzahl @xcite .",
    "they integrated the geodesics in the four - dimensional schwarzschild - de sitter space - time analytically in terms of the hyperelliptic @xmath3- and @xmath1-functions .",
    "the mathematical problem is based on the jacobi inversion problem which can be solved if restriced to the @xmath3-divisor .",
    "this method was also applied to find the analytical solution of the equations of motion in higher dimensional schwarzschild , schwarzschild-(anti)de sitter , reissner - nordstrm and reissner - nordstrm -(anti ) de sitter spactime @xcite as well as in kerr-(anti ) de sitter spacetimes @xcite and in higher dimensional myers - perry spacetime @xcite .",

    "the energy of the test particle is very close to a local maximum of the effective potential , so that the particle `` whirls '' around the black string before reaching the periastron and then `` zooms '' out to return to its elliptical orbit where it moves to the apastron .",
    "in this article we presented the complete set of analytical solutions of the geodesic equations of test particles and light in the static and the rotating black string spacetime .",
    "the static and the rotating black string metric are obtained by adding a compact dimension to the schwarzschild and kerr metric .    the geodesic equations can be solved in terms of the elliptic @xmath0- , @xmath1- and @xmath2-functions .",
    "using effective potential techniques and parametric diagrams , possible types of orbits were derived . in the static case bos , eos and tos",
    "are possible , while in the rotating case bos , mbos , eos , teos , cteos , tros and tos are possible .",
    "in contrast to the ordinary four - dimensional schwarzschild and kerr spacetime , bound orbits of light are possible both in the static and the rotating black string spacetime .",
    "+ hereby the analytic solutions do not only give a proof of the existence of bound orbits of light in the black string spacetime .",
    "they also present a usefull tool to calculate the exact orbits and their properties , including observables like the periastron shift of bound orbits , the light deflection of escape orbits , the deflecton angle and the lense - thirring effect .",
    "for the calculation of the observables analogous formulas to those given in @xcite can be used .",
    "observables can later be compared to observations .",
    "+ the black strings considered here are so - called uniform black strings , since there is no dependence of the extra dimension . however , uniform black strings are subject to the gregory - laflamme instability @xcite , which is associated with the emergence of a branch of non - uniform black strings , whose horizon size is not constant w.r.t .  the compact direction , but depends on the compact coordinate @xcite . at the endpoint of this nonuniform black string branch",
    "a horizon topology changing transition should be encountered @xcite .    to gain a better understanding of this transition , it is essential to solve the geodesic equations . however , for the construction of nonuniform black strings no analytic techniques are available , and numerical techniques have to be employed .",
    "likewise , the geodesic equations must be solved numerically .",
    "it is therefore of high relevance , to have analytic solutions of the geodesic equations available as a testbed .",
    "moreover , it will be very interesting to see , how the set of analytic solutions changes , as the black strings become more and more nonuniform .",
    "also non - uniform rotating and charged black strings have been considered in @xcite and @xcite whose geodesics would be very interesting to study . + it is also interesting to consider higher dimensional ( @xmath264 ) schwarzschild spacetimes , here stable bound orbits are no longer possible @xcite .",
    "one may wonder wether bound orbits of light become possible if a compact dimension is added to the metric .",
    "but it can be shown that unlike in the ( rotating ) black string spacetime in five dimensions , stable bound orbits of light are not possible if a compact dimension is added to higher dimensional schwarzschild spacetimes .",
    "+ moreover the bound orbits of light appear neither in the spacetime of an abelian - higgs string @xcite nor in the spacetime of two interacting abelian - higgs strings @xcite . there escape orbits are the only possibility for massless particles . for cosmic superstrings",
    "bound orbits of light are possible in melvin spacetimes but not in asymptotically conical spacetimes @xcite .",
