    "recent news in 2015 @xcite made a nearly hundred - years - old problem popular again : the complete characterization of all convex pentagons that tile the euclidean plane monohedrally ( i.e. , filling the plane completely without gaps or overlaps by using only congruent copies of one special tile ) .",
    "there is no hint that this characterization can be fully done in the near future , so only a systematic catalog of the existing tilings can be given ( e.g. , see @xcite or @xcite ) .",
    "but why are pentagons so interesting mathematically ?",
    "the reason is simple : for all other convex polygons the question is settled .",
    "so , the pentagons remained as an open problem .    in most papers about this subject",
    "the emphasis is put on periodic tilings .",
    "one reason might be the fact that all known families of pentagons tiling the plane are able to generate periodic tilings but only few of them also deliver rotationally symmetric ones ( e.g. , @xcite or at the end of @xcite ) .",
    "it is good practice to denote the type of symmetry in the catalogs of tilings .",
    "but we also could view the problem from the other direction : for which types of symmetry is a monohedral tiling with convex pentagons possible ?",
    "we will answer this question positively for all types of rotational symmetry . in our case",
    "the schoenflies notation for symmetry is the easiest one , which uses @xmath0 for @xmath3-fold rotational symmetry without reflection and @xmath1 for additional @xmath3 axes of reflection ( e.g. , see fig .",
    "1.1 ) .",
    "figure : :    1.1 examples for @xmath4 ( taken from @xcite ) and    @xmath5 symmetry    regarding the periodic case , only four types of rotational symmetry are possible : @xmath6 , 3 , 4 or 6 .",
    "it is interesting to observe that all of these cases occur in the catalog of known periodic pentagon tilings . for the non - periodic case , which is studied here",
    ", we will see that we can go further . from related work",
    "( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) tilings are known with arbitrary rotational symmetry but they are generated by rhombs or triangles as prototiles .",
    "here we define a class of pentagons , from which one can generate the proposed symmetry types .",
    "the following properties define the class :    [ [ property-1 ] ] property 1 :    let @xmath7 be the inner angles in anti - clockwise order of a pentagon @xmath8 and @xmath9 the edges with @xmath10 ending at corner @xmath11 and so forth .",
    "@xmath8 is regarded to have property 1 if all inner angles @xmath12 and @xmath13 and @xmath14 and ( @xmath15 ) where @xmath16 denotes the length of side @xmath10 .",
    "( see fig .",
    "2.1 for an example . )       obviously , this pentagon class is a subclass of  type 1 from @xcite and has three degrees of freedom : the angles @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 can be chosen within certain ranges and constraints but independently from each other .",
    "the other angles and proportions are dependent from these three .",
    "without loss of generality we assume for simplicity that angle @xmath17 divides 360 .",
    "( if @xmath17 and @xmath18 are interchanged , the following theorem also holds with equivalent proof . )",
    "[ [ theorem ] ] theorem :    for a given natural number @xmath20 any property-1-pentagon with @xmath21 tiles the euclidean plane with @xmath3-fold rotational symmetry .",
    "if @xmath22 and @xmath23 , the plane can be tiled with type @xmath1 , otherwise with @xmath0 . for @xmath6 or @xmath24",
    "such a tiling is possible with any @xmath25 , especially with property-1-pentagons .",
    "[ [ proof ] ] proof :    we start with the case @xmath20 .",
    "first , we should note that each pentagon @xmath8 with property 1 has parallel sides @xmath26 and @xmath10 .",
    "so we can take a copy of @xmath8 and glue both together at side @xmath27 to form a hexagon , in most cases not a regular one , but equilateral and with parallel sides .",
    "figure : :    2.1 a sector formed by congruent hexagons    putting copies of these hexagons together in form of growing rows , one can fill a kind of sector of the plane .",
    "the outer shape of this sector is fully characterized by the angles , since the length of the line segments is always @xmath28 . viewing this sector in upright position as in figure 2.1 , we see that the left border is a zig - zag - line with alternating inner angles @xmath11 and @xmath29 , the right border has angles @xmath18 and @xmath30 alternating .",
    "now we take a copy of this sector and connect it to the first one as shown in figure 2.2 . between both sectors",
    "a gap remains which has the following characterization : the innermost point has outer angle @xmath31 , which is @xmath32 , so the inner angle of the gap is @xmath17 .",
    "the left border is an equilateral zig - zag with alternating angles @xmath18 and @xmath30 , the right border has angles @xmath11 and @xmath29 alternating .",
    "figure : :    2.2 two sectors with a gap    it follows that the original sector from figure 2.1 perfectly fits into the gap after a reflection operation at the vertical axis and a suitable rotation .",
    "such a reflection plus rotation is allowed , since all parts within a sector remain congruent under this operation .",
    "figure : :    2.3 another sector copy fills the gap after reflection plus rotation    with these operations we have to generate @xmath33 sectors to fill the 360 angle around the origin of the plane and the @xmath3 gaps . by construction ,",
    "the symmetry @xmath0 is obvious . to introduce the additional reflection axes needed for @xmath1",
    ", we just have to view the case @xmath22 and @xmath23 ( see fig .",
    "2.4 ) . here",
    "the sector itself has reflection symmetry .",
    "finally , we have @xmath33 sector copies but each two of them share the same axis .",
    "so there are @xmath3 axes for @xmath1 .",
    "( for a full view , see also the examples in section 3 . )",
    "figure : :    2.4 sector with reflection symmetry    how can we see that our tilings are really plane filling ? to prove this , we can regard the tiling of each sector as a sequence of rows with a growing number of hexagons .",
    "consider those rows with a fixed number of @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) hexagons , which @xmath36 as a union @xmath36 always forms a closed ring built out of @xmath37 hexagons . then each of the described tilings can be seen as a growing series of rings around the centre with each ring consisting of hexagons .",
    "the first union with @xmath38 is topologically equivalent to a disk .",
    "each further ring enlarges this disk , the size of which must grow with linearly increasing diameter , since the shape of the hexagons can not degenerate .",
    "each new ring fits to the previous one without gap .",
    "so , for any point on the plane it will be covered by this growing disk after enough rings were added consecutively .",
    "but is it always possible to construct a pentagon with inner angles @xmath12 ?",
    "it is , since @xmath39 for all @xmath20 .",
    "then @xmath11 and @xmath18 can be chosen e.g. @xmath40 respectively , which is smaller than @xmath41 .",
    "the choice of @xmath19 can be @xmath42 , which is also between 0 and @xmath41 .",
    "finally we have to discuss the cases @xmath6 and @xmath24 . here",
    "the above construction will result in rectangles instead of hexagons , which will not deliver proper pentagons with angles @xmath12 .",
    "so we should look into the existing catalogue for pentagon tilings .",
    "the most simple ones , called ",
    "houses tiling  , will help .",
    "simple examples for @xmath6 are shown .",
    "the point of symmetry is marked by a dot .",
    "figure : :    2.5 examples for @xmath43 and    @xmath44 symmetry    the case @xmath45 means  neither rotational nor reflexion symmetry ( see fig",
    ". 2.6 left ) and @xmath46 has only one symmetry axis and no rotational symmetry ( see the right part of fig .",
    "2.6 ) .",
    "figure : :    2.6 examples for @xmath45 and    @xmath46 symmetry    so all symmetry types @xmath0 and @xmath1 were constructed with pentagons having property 1 , q.e.d .",
    "we should not finish the paper without showing some of the nice tilings resulting from the above construction .",
    "the first figure represents @xmath47 symmetry :        figure : :    3.1 @xmath47 symmetry with    @xmath48    the second one is representing @xmath49 :        figure : :    3.2 example for @xmath49 symmetry",
    "another visually attractive property of the above construction is the following .",
    "any tiling according to chapter 2 with @xmath3-fold rotational symmetry and @xmath2 can also be regarded as spiral tiling with @xmath3 congruent arms ( see @xcite for a precise definition of the term  spiral tiling ) . to give an example ,",
    "we can identify one of the seven spiral arms within the @xmath49 tiling from the above figure 3.2 .",
    "take one of the innermost hexagons for the spiral s begin and walk outward obeying the rule : find the dividing line in the hexagon s middle and choose the neighboring hexagon at the line s right endpoint as next hexagon for the spiral ( where  right means ",
    "right viewed from the origin ) .",
    "figure 4.1 displays this partition into spiral arms . in the well - known book of grnbaum and shephard @xcite it was put as an open question if spiral tilings exist with @xmath3 arms for any odd @xmath50 .",
    "later several spiral tilings have been published ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite or @xcite ) but to the author s knowledge those with higher number of arms had non - convex tiles .",
    "here we can show spirals with arbitrary number of congruent arms and with convex pentagons as prototiles .          to summarize the results of this paper",
    ", we can state that for any rotational symmetry type @xmath0 or @xmath1 there is a tiling of the 2d plane with convex pentagons representing this symmetry .",
    "each of these tilings with @xmath2 can also be regarded as spiral tiling with @xmath3 congruent arms . by construction",
    "it is obvious that this holds for hexagons , as well .    after handling all rotational symmetric cases",
    ", there remains an open question in the periodic case .",
    "the author s presumption is that it will not be possible to represent all 2d symmetry types by convex pentagon tilings , unless degenerated pentagons are used ( i.e. triangles or quadrangles ) ."
