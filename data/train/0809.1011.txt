    "the problem of designing nanomechanical devices , in particular , of reducing friction by means of nano- and micro - bearings  @xcite is nowadays a hot one .",
    "the idea of using spherical molecules such as fullerene c@xmath0 as molecular nanobearings gave rise to experimental attempts  @xcite as well as molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations  @xcite .",
    "other potentially rolling molecules were considered as additives in oil lubricants , and predicted to provide interesting tribological properties  @xcite .",
    "the simulations indicated that ball - shaped molecules may either slide or rotate over a surface , depending on the substrate and the position of the molecule , and suggested that the rolling configuration should indeed attain extremely low friction  @xcite , with a predicted friction coefficient of the order @xmath1",
    "@xcite or smaller  @xcite .",
    "all experimental attempts however met with scarce success so far .",
    "a single c@xmath0 molecule confined between solid substrates should begin to roll under a torque of order @xmath2  nm  @xcite .",
    "however , c@xmath0 molecules generally condense to form close - packed islands , their two dimensional ( 2d ) crystalline structure exhibiting order at low temperatures . through a first - order orientational order - disorder transition  @xcite at @xmath3",
    "k , the molecules actually unlock to attain seemingly free rotation at @xmath4 . at @xmath5",
    "there is indeed an abrupt change in friction  @xcite , but the lowest friction coefficient is still of order @xmath6  @xcite , worse than with traditional oil - based lubricants . coffey and krim  @xcite undertook a quartz crystal microbalance study of one or two c@xmath0 monolayers adsorbed on ag(111 ) or cu(111 ) .",
    "there are no rotations in a c@xmath0 layer on cu(111 ) , and only a slow change of molecular orientations for a c@xmath0 layer on ag(111 ) . in a bilayer ,",
    "c@xmath0 molecules in the top layer rotate freely at 300 k , as expected .",
    "nonetheless a molecularly thin methanol film deposited over the c@xmath0 bilayer failed to show either the expected low friction , or any essential difference between these systems .",
    "altogether , these results apparently doom the idea to replicate the bearing concept at the nanoscale . the questions why , and how this could be overcome are still quite open .",
    "first of all , even a small amount of charge transfer and/or bonding between c@xmath0 and the metal substrate may hinder the rolling ; therefore , chemically inactive , insulating substrates should be preferred to metals .",
    "a second handicap lies in the close packing of molecules .",
    "balls in bearings are arranged so as to prevent contact , but rolling molecules in a monolayer are in close contact , hindering , even in the apparently freely rotating phase , their mutual rolling and jamming the same way mutually ingrained rolling cogwheels would . as was found in earlier simulations",
    "@xcite , a way to avoid jamming is to lower dramatically the molecular coverage well below a monolayer ",
    "indicatively to coverages @xmath7  to approach the limiting rolling friction of a single molecule .",
    "a third element , not investigated so far , is a possible role of molecule - substrate matching . using a single molecule model as our starting point",
    ", we now find that this element is unexpectedly important .    in our ordinary , macroscopic world",
    ", the main source of rolling friction is deformation , since both substrate and roller elastically or plastically deform at the contact .",
    "the deformation energy is partly released and lost in the form of bulk frictional heat when the roller moves on  @xcite . by designing the bulk",
    "so that dissipation is poor in the right frequency range , rolling friction can be made @xmath8 to @xmath9 times lower than sliding friction , since the latter implies breaking and re - forming of slider - substrate bonds .",
    "as the roller size is decreased however , adhesion grows in importance , eventually becoming the main source of friction . to rotate a molecule ,",
    "one has to break the molecule - substrate bonds one side of the molecule and create new bonds on the opposite side ; hence , molecular rolling friction might not be much lower than sliding friction .",
    "our goal is to understand what physics may yield the lowest friction coefficient attainable for molecular rolling and which system parameters might provide it . in the end , we find that nanobearings might indeed work as well as macroscopic ones , but one has to choose properly the macroscopic counterpart , which here turns out to be a perfect rack - and - pinion matching as in cogwheels . because we are interested in general trends , we presently explore a minimal 2d model , which allows us to span a large number of parameters , and",
    "also provides an easier visualization of all processes .",
    "consider two substrates with lubricant molecules in between , all elements made up of classical point particles ( atoms ) .",
    "atoms can generally move in the @xmath10 plane , where @xmath11 is the sliding direction and @xmath12 is perpendicular to the substrates .",
    "the substrates , pressed together by a load force @xmath13 , consist of rigid atomic chains of length @xmath14 and lattice constant @xmath15 , so that the system size in the sliding direction is @xmath16 and the total mass of the substrate is @xmath17 ( we use periodic boundary condition along @xmath11 ) .",
    "the bottom rigid substrate is fixed at @xmath18 , the top one is free to move in both @xmath11 and @xmath12 , while driven along @xmath11 through a spring of elastic constant @xmath19 moving with speed @xmath20 .",
    "the spring force @xmath21 , whose maximum value before the onset of sliding measures the static friction force @xmath22 , and whose average during smooth motion @xmath23 is the kinetic friction force , is monitored during simulation ( throughout the paper we will normalize forces per substrate atom @xmath24 ) .",
    "thus , our model is a 2d variant of a typical experimental setup in tribology @xcite . between the substrates we place circular ( `` spherical '' ) lubricant molecules . as in ref .",
    "@xcite , each molecule consists of one central atom and of @xmath25 atoms on circle of radius @xmath26 so that their chord distance is @xmath27 . all atoms interact via a 12 - 6 lennard - jones ( lj ) potential @xmath28 $ ] , where @xmath29 or  @xmath30 for the substrate or molecular atoms respectively .",
    "the latter are additionally coupled to the central atom by stiff springs of the elastic constant @xmath31 , @xmath32 , where the distance @xmath33 $ ] is chosen so that the total potential @xmath34 is minimum at @xmath35 . with @xmath36 the resulting stiff molecular shape resisted destruction during the simulations .",
    "thus , the lubricant - lubricant interaction is described by the parameters @xmath37 and @xmath27 , while the lubricant - substrate interaction , by @xmath38 and @xmath39 ( direct interaction between the top and bottom substrates is omitted ) .",
    "we use dimensionless units , where @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and the energy parameters @xmath42 takes values around @xmath43 . because a 2d model can not reproduce even qualitatively the phonon spectrum of a 3d system , and because frictional kinetics is generally diffusional rather than inertial , we use langevin equations of motion with gaussian random forces corresponding to temperature @xmath44 , and a damping force @xmath45 , where @xmath46 are the atomic coordinates and @xmath47 are the coordinates of the top substrate ( the force @xmath48 is defined in the same way ) .",

    "clearly , by suitably choosing @xmath64 a very strong decrease of rolling friction is attainable",
    ".    the unexpected minima of @xmath69 can be explained by simple engineering  a `` rack - and - pinion '' model .",
    "consider the molecule as a cogwheel ( the pinion ) with @xmath25 cogs , primitive radius @xmath109 and external radius @xmath110 , where @xmath111 . the chord distance between nearest cogs is @xmath112 .",
    "best rolling conditions are expected when @xmath113 matches the substrate potential period @xmath15 , i.e. , for @xmath114 and its fractions , @xmath115 , @xmath116 , etc .",
    "the main minimum of @xmath69 is expected at @xmath117 as shown in fig .",
    "[ r15 ] , the cogwheel model ( [ rsmatch ] ) with @xmath118 , where @xmath119 is a parameter , fits extremely well the shift of minimum position with molecular size @xmath25 .",
    "moreover , it can explain its variation with load ( the radius @xmath120 and therefore @xmath121 decreases as the load grows ) as well as with the lubricant - substrate interaction @xmath38 ( @xmath120 and @xmath121 decreases with @xmath38 ) @xcite .",
    "it also accounts for the even - odd effect since odd @xmath25 involves perfect ingraining for one substrate at a time , justifying why roughly double values of @xmath119 are needed for even relative to odd @xmath25 .",
    "these insights for rigid molecules are confirmed by the static friction force obtained from simulation with deformable molecules ( fig .",
    "[ r09 ] ) .",
    "the friction coefficient @xmath122 ranges from @xmath123 at @xmath124 to @xmath125 or even @xmath126 at @xmath127 .",
    "the results are also robust to changes of model parameters . for example , fig .",
    "[ r09 ] compares the dependences @xmath128 for two values of the amplitude of lubricant - substrate interaction , @xmath55 and  @xmath129 , and for two values of the load , @xmath65 and  @xmath130 .",
    "we found both static @xmath70 and kinetic friction @xmath131 to increase approximately linearly with load , @xmath132 .",
    "visualization of md trajectories shows that for @xmath133 , where friction is high , rolling rotation is in fact discontinuous , and accompanied by a molecular shift / sliding  much as cogwheels with excessive clearance would do  which dissipates mechanical energy into vibrations , whereas for @xmath134 , where friction is low , the motion is a smooth rotation , corresponding to optimal rack - and - pinion coupling .",
    "simulations further showed that this scenario remains valid at nonzero temperature @xmath44 .",
    "as @xmath44 increases , both static and kinetic friction forces are found to decrease , the stick - slip changing to creep and finally to smooth motion at high temperatures .",
    "we also found transitions from stick - slip to smooth rolling for increasing velocity .",
    "the cogwheel effect remains , and for example calculated static friction for @xmath133 and @xmath134 still differ by a factor of ten or more .",
    "the critical velocity @xmath135 of the transition from stick - slip to smooth rolling also differs by a factor of about four in the two cases . in all cases",
    "we find @xmath136 @xcite .",
    "the present approach to the single rolling molecule can be extended to a finite coverage of lubricant molecules . for @xmath137 molecules",
    "the individual molecular load is @xmath138 so that the friction per molecule @xmath139 also decreases .",
    "however , the total friction force @xmath140 increases , so that the combined effect is a slow increase of the total friction with @xmath137 . in a real situation",
    ", coalescence may lead to jamming , with molecules blocking their mutual rotation . in our model , jamming starts already at @xmath141 and completely destroys rolling at @xmath142  @xcite ( here @xmath143 is the coverage , with @xmath144 the number of molecules in a monolayer ) .",
    "our 2d modeling leads to overall conclusions of considerable novelty . rolling spherical lubricant molecules",
    "can indeed provide better tribological parameters than sliding atomic lubricants",
    ". the effect may be as large as in macroscopic friction , where rolling reduces friction by a factor of @xmath145 , however only for low concentration of lubricant molecules , and for specially chosen values of the ratio @xmath103 , e.g. , for @xmath146 , corresponding to perfect rack - and - pinion matching .",
    "while of course the matching condition will be more delicate and difficult to realize in 3d than in 2d , the concept can surely be pursued experimentally , for different spherical molecules , different substrates , and different coverages .",
    "inert nonmetal surface ( such as perhaps self - assembled monolayers ) could represent a better choice of substrate than metals for fullerene deposition ; and lower coverages should be preferred to complete monolayers .",
    "because 3d rolling has an azimuthal degree of freedom , the novel cogwheel effect found here will be direction dependent , and rolling friction will exhibit anisotropy depending on direction . at fixed rolling direction ,",
    "increasing load could offer the simplest tool to change the rack - and - pinion matching through a pressure - induced decrease of @xmath118 . in this case",
    ", the effect would show up as a strikingly nonmonotonic ( non - amontons ) behavior of friction with load .",
