    "today , the understanding of particle physics is theoretically encoded in the standard model ( sm ) , a renormalizable quantum field theory unifying quantum mechanics and special relativity that describes the fundamental interactions ( except gravity ) via a local su(3)@xmath11 su(2)@xmath11u(1 ) gauge - symmetry group .",
    "the three gauge - symmetry terms give rise to the strong , weak and electromagnetic forces , while the particles fall into different representations of these symmetry groups .",
    "the sm lagrangian ( without neutrino masses ) contains 19 free parameters to be determined experimentally : 3 gauge couplings , 9 higgs  fermion yukawa couplings , 3 mixing - angles , 2 charge - parity ( cp ) phases , and 2 higgs boson couplings . despite its tremendous success to accurately and consistently describe all phenomena observed at particle accelerators so far including the recent experimental confirmation of the existence of its last missing piece , the higgs boson",
    "the theory is not complete and has several outstanding open questions to solve :    1 .",
    "dark matter ( dm ) : the sm describes only @xmath124% of the universe energy budget , the rest being in unknown dm ( and dark energy ) forms , pointing to the existence of new massive particles ( such as e.g.  susy partners , axions , heavy @xmath13 s ... ) .",
    "flavour problem : the huge dominance of matter over antimatter in the universe can not be explained by the known sm sources of cp violation .",
    "more generally , the sm fails to explain the rationale behind the observed pattern of fermion families masses and flavour mixings .",
    "neutrino masses : the generation of non - zero neutrino masses , called for by the observation of their flavour oscillations , is beyond the sm ( bsm ) and requires new particles such as right - handed @xmath13 s .",
    "hierarchy ( or `` fine tuning '' , `` naturalness '' ) problem : quadratically - divergent virtual sm corrections affect the running of the higgs boson mass between the widely separated electroweak and planck scales , calling for new ( e.g.  supersymmetric ) particles to stabilize such `` untamed '' quantum corrections .",
    "strong cp problem : the absence of cp - violation in qcd is naturally explained by postulating a ( peccei - quinn ) symmetry that gives rise to a new particle ( axion ) .",
    "other fundamental sm issues include the current inability to explain dark energy , the cosmological constant , the origin of inflation , or gauge - gravity unification .",
    "many ( or all ) such fundamental questions may likely _ not _ be fully answered through the study of p - p collisions at the lhc . despite their lower center - of - mass energies , @xmath0 colliders feature several advantages compared to their hadronic counterparts in terms of new physics studies : ( i ) direct model - independent searches for new particles coupling to z*/@xmath14 * with masses up to @xmath15 ; ( ii ) signals and backgrounds with very precisely known theoretical qcd and electroweak corrections with uncertainties ( well ) below 1% in many cases ; and ( iii ) very clean experimental environment with final states free of `` holes '' or `` blind spots '' typical of p - p searches involving new particles with difficult decay modes ( e.g.  in certain susy scenarios with soft final - states and/or without missing transverse energy ) .",
    "thus , combined with high - luminosities , an @xmath0 collider can provide access to studies with permil - level precision @xmath16 , allowing one to place indirect constraints on bsm physics appearing as virtual corrections to well - controlled processes up to very - high energies @xmath17  ( 1  tev)/@xmath18 . plans exist to build future circular ( fcc - ee  @xcite , cepc  @xcite ) and/or linear ( ilc  @xcite , clic  @xcite ) @xmath0 colliders ( fig .",

    "linear @xmath0 colliders , on the other hand , feature ( i ) much larger @xmath2 reach ( circular colliders are not competitive above @xmath19  400  gev due to synchroton radiation scaling as e@xmath21 ) , and ( ii ) easier longitudinal beam polarization . at the fcc",
