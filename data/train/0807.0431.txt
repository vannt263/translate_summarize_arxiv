    "during the lifetime of the energetic gamma - ray experiment telescope ( egret ) instrument on board _ compton gamma - ray observatory _ ( cgro ) 271 sources were detected with 66 being confidently identified as blazars in the third egret catalog @xcite .",
    "many differing statistical analyses of these gamma ray detected blazars have been conducted , among them @xcite;@xcite .",
    "some of these analyses concentrated on the direct statistical relationship between luminosities in the gamma - ray band and radio bands @xcite . of these , most have used single dish radio data , but some have used vlbi fluxes @xcite , all at various radio frequencies @xmath5 1 ghz .",
    "in addition , @xcite and @xcite use monte carlo simulations to aid in interpreting these relationships . though significant correlations are reported in all of these works , @xcite",
    "show that in some cases these will result from a combination of variability and selection effects . to investigate the variability effects further",
    ", @xcite have compared their statistical results using time averaged data for the entire sample to similar results for a restricted sample for which data were available during high and low states .",
    "they report a similar significant correlation in each case and show that using time averaged data tends to under estimate the underlying linear regression slope ( as applied to the logarithmic data ) .",
    "various models have been invoked to explain the origin of the gamma - ray emission of blazars and specifically , the radio gamma - ray correlation . among these are the synchrotron self compton ( ssc ) model @xcite and various models in which the source of seed photons for scattering is from a source external to the jet ( henceforth called ecs models for `` external compton scattering '' ) .",
    "@xcite use the accretion disk as the source of soft photons whereas others @xcite use broad - line region clouds as the source of soft photons .",
    "since the end of the egret mission there have also been several reanalyses of the significance of identifications of egret sources , particularly those of @xcite and @xcite.the @xcite survey excludes sources with @xmath6 ( the mattox papers exclude sources with @xmath7 ) , and thus may exclude additional sources that are thought to be blazars @xcite .",
    "likewise , some work continues on identifying other individual sources , such as 3eg j0416 + 3650 , possibly identified with 3c 111 @xcite . in the eight years since the end of the cgro mission , there has been substantial modification to the identifications given in the last catalog published by the egret team @xcite , so we present a comprehensive statistical analysis including all potential identifications , using homogeneous criteria for inclusion in the sample (  2 ) .",
    "we have also included various statistical techniques of survival analysis for the inclusion of upper and lower limits in the data (  3 ) .",
    "we later discuss whether or not the results of the analyses are dependent on the precise source list .",
    "the approach used in understanding the physical implications of our results is to use a monte carlo technique @xcite to generate multiple simulated samples under differing assumptions of overall theoretical or phenomenological model (  4,5 ) , distribution of physical parameters such as bulk lorentz factor ( e.g. , gaussian , power - law , etc . ) and selection effects .",
    "additional physical implications of observed correlations and implications for the gamma ray large area space telescope ( glast ) , successfully launched in june 2008 , are discussed in  6,7 .",
    "to construct a comprehensive list of identified gamma - ray blazars we have started with the third egret catalog @xcite .",
    "we note that we are not re - evaluating the detections themselves . to add or remove sources from this list of identifications using uniform criteria , we have further used the guidance of @xcite .",
    "though other standards for inclusion or rejection do exist , we have used these particular surveys to keep inclusion criterion standard .",
    "we have taken the best blazar identifications with figure of merit ( fom ) criterion greater than 0.25 @xcite .",
    "the fom used here is a statistic that incorporates both radio and x - ray spectral information in evaluating the probability that a particular radio source is a match to the gamma - ray source . for sources with multiple possible identifications ,",
    "we include the identification with the highest fom value .",
    "though the 0.25 cutoff is perhaps arbitrary , it is clear that well below this limit ( at about 0.1 ) , the probability for chance associations greatly increases @xcite .",
    "these authors and their current working group have not yet published an analysis for the sources between -40 and -90 declination .",
    "for these sources , we included all of the original catalog identifications , with the caveat that the more marginal identifications ( i.e. counterparts with 8.4 ghz radio flux density @xmath8 jy ) could possibly not hold up to the analysis using the fom criterion .",
    "the total number of such sources in this declination range is ten , with two below 0.5 jy ( the remainder all have flux density greater than 1 jy at 8.4 ghz ) .",
    "we also note that we could be excluding candidate identifications heretofore unmentioned in this declination range .",
    "a summary of the available data used in our statistical analysis has been compiled in table 1 .",
    "column(1 ) indicates the egret source name , column ( 2 ) indicates the best radio identification , followed by the redshift in column(3 ) .",
    "columns ( 4)-(6 ) give the monochromatic radio , optical and gamma ray luminosities , respectively ( all have units of @xmath9 ) . if the redshift is unknown , we substitute with z=1",
    ". there are no significant changes in the results if we use other assumptions , such as z=0.5 . to calculate the radio luminosity we use the 8.4 ghz flux densities and spectral indices ( column ( 7))between 1.4 and 8.4 ghz of @xcite except for the lowest declination sources discussed above .",
    "for these , we extract the similar radio data from the nasa extragalactic database ( ned ) to calculate the spectral index between 1.4 and 8.4 ghz .",
    "henceforth we use @xmath10 for defining spectral indices . in calculating the optical luminosities we use recent v magnitudes extracted from ned ( when available ) , and we derive an optical flux density and monochromatic luminosity from this magnitude using the conversions of @xcite .",
    "@xcite also provide archival r and b magnitudes from the usno catalog @xcite , which we have used to interpolate a v value if we did not otherwise have a reference for a v magnitude . in a few cases we only had o magnitudes from the poss - i survey or 2mass infrared magnitudes , and",
    "thus need to extrapolate to the v band . for sources that have no optical or near infrared magnitudes in the literature , and that were not detected in the poss - i , serc - j , or poss - ii we assume magnitude upper limits equal to the appropriate plate limits of the survey ( eg .",
    ", o=21.5,e=20 for poss - i @xcite ) and derive upper limits to the optical luminosities accordingly .",
    "the gamma - ray luminosities are determined from the flux and spectral index ( column ( 8) ) given in @xcite .",
    "we use the formula of @xcite to derive an exact 400 mev flux . if the spectral index is not known , we assume it is 1.0 ( note that we are referring to the energy spectral index and not the photon index ) .",
    "in all cases we use the co - added flux over all viewing periods . in the absence of simultaneous data at all wavelengths ,",
    "this is a better representation of broad band properties than any single value .",
    "each of the luminosities is calculated using equation ( 2 ) of @xcite and assumes a flat @xmath11 cosmology with @xmath12 and @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "though the luminosity distance can be calculated via numerical integration , it is preferred to find an analytic expression , especially for use in the monte carlo simulations where such a calculation will have to be performed many millions of times .",
    "@xcite offers such an option ; however this formula can differ from the numerically determined value by over 5% .",
    "therefore , a polynomial fit to the numerical solutions is determined for the redshift range z=0 - 5 using the wolfram research program _",
    "mathematica _ to attain a more accurate approximation . when luminosity distances determined via this polynomial fit",
    "were compared with the results of a direct numerical integration , the agreement was well within 1 % for the range @xmath14 ; however , at redshifts outside of this range , the disagreement is as large as 7% .",
    "column(9 ) shows the broadband spectral index , @xmath2 gives the index @xmath1 .",
    "column ( 11 ) has the gamma - ray variability parameter , @xmath15 , as determined by @xcite .",
    "column ( 12 ) gives the references for the data , where the first reference is for redshift , the second for the radio data , the third for the optical magnitudes , and the fourth for the gamma ray data .",
    "we have evaluated the strength and significance of correlation between monochromatic luminosities using non - parametric methods , such as kendall s @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "these results are given in table 2 .",
    "column(1 ) gives the independent variable , column(2 ) the dependent variable , column(3 ) the number in the sample , column(4 ) kendall s @xmath16 statistic , column(5 ) the probability of the null result for this statistic , column(6 ) the spearman s @xmath17 statistic , column(7 ) the probability of the null result for this statistic , and in column(8 ) the regression technique used . here bj refers to the buckley - james method , em refers to the em method and sb refers to schmitt s binned regression , as explained in the references that follow .",
    "column(9 ) gives the linear regression slope , and column(10 ) the linear regression y - intercept . in some cases",
    ", we have upper and lower limits to measured values , and to take this into account , we use the proper correlation and regression techniques as discussed in @xcite and utilized in the asurv software package . in reporting correlation",
    "coefficients , probabilities and regression fits we adopt the format of @xcite .",
    "that is , we report three significant digits down to 0.100 .",
    "between 0.010 and 0.100 we report two significant digits , and for all numbers with values below 0.01 , we only report with 1 significant digit .",
    "most notably , we determine that there is a strong correlation between gamma ray and radio luminosity ( figure 1 and table 2 ) . in order to determine whether the correlation is affected by including the sources with fom @xmath18 ( the lower confidence identifications )",
    ", we recalculate the correlation and regression coefficients while retaining only the 76 sources with fom @xmath19 .",
    "the strength of the correlation is similar , with a very slight steepening of the regression slope ( 0.78 instead of 0.77 , which is within the range of the uncertainty of the correlation slopes ) . if the sources with declination below -40 @xmath20 are also excluded , the the correlation slope flattens slightly to 0.73 . in all",
    "though , correlation is not significantly altered by such changes to the source list .",
    "for some correlations , we must account for the effect of a third variable , using partial correlation analysis @xcite .",
    "results of our partial correlation analysis are given in table 3 .",
    "column(1 ) gives the independent variable , column(2 ) the dependent variable , column(3 ) the third variable , column(4 ) the number in sample , column(5 ) kendall s @xmath16 , and column(6 ) , the probability of the null result .",
    "examples of this are the need to take into account the correlation of all luminosities on redshift , and the dependence of several broad band spectral indices on optical luminosity .",
    "in particular we note that the strong correlation between gamma ray and radio luminosity is significantly weaker , though still significant , once we account for the partial correlation with redshift .",
    "similarly , the correlation between the @xmath2 and @xmath21 still persists , even after the effect of the common dependence on optical luminosity is negated .",
    "we use the kendall s @xmath16 coefficient for this purpose , since to date it is the only coefficient for which there are methods to take into account censored data @xcite .",
    "a detailed discussion of the physical models for the luminosity correlation is addressed in  4 ,  5 .",
    "further discussion of the remaining correlations is deferred to  6 .",
    "our approach in this section is to see if particular models can be used to explain our statistical results above , particularly the radio and gamma - ray luminosity relationship .",
    "a radio and gamma - ray luminosity correlation would naturally be expected given any of the non - thermal inverse compton models linking low energy emission with gamma rays , such as in @xcite .",
    "as noted above , this luminosity correlation holds even after we take the effect of redshift into account . a linear or nearly linear correlation is possible within the synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) model if the range of possible physical parameters , particularly the optically thin spectral index , thomson optical depth and electron energy cutoffs do not vary too greatly in the sample .",
    "this can be illustrated by following @xcite for a spherical homogeneous source :    @xmath22    where @xmath23 is the frequency dependent compton luminosity , @xmath24 is the frequency dependent synchrotron luminosity .",
    "@xmath25 is a function of spectral index , tabulated in @xcite , @xmath26 is the normalization factor of the energy dependent electron density distribution , and @xmath27 is the radius of a spherical source .",
    "@xmath28 refers to the spectral turnover frequency in a plot of flux density versus frequency , and @xmath29 is the upper frequency cutoff in a similar plot .",
    "a correction to this formula needs to be applied if the observed gamma - rays are at a frequency beyond the high end spectral cutoff for compton scattering , or if the synchrotron photons are observed at a frequency at which the source is believed to be optically thick or partially opaque .",
    "the logarithmic term only varies a small amount for large changes in the parameters , so this term can usually be neglected relative to the others .",
    "the function of @xmath30 can vary over several orders of magnitude , but can be roughly constant if the optically thin spectral index of the sample is narrowly distributed .",
    "the factor of @xmath31 , proportional to the thomson optical depth , would also have to be tightly constrained . using a somewhat different formulation , @xcite calculate a particle injection compactness parameter , which is also proportional to the thompson optical depth .",
    "they show that this parameter , though distributed over 4 orders of magnitude for a sample of 51 egret blazars , has a clear peak value ( over half of the blazars with a value within 1 order of magnitude of the peak ) .",
    "thus , in adopting a linear model for use in the following monte carlo analysis , this parameter can be drawn randomly from a sharply peaked distribution .",
    "it is not as evident that these arguments can be extended to a relationship such as that observed , @xmath32 .",
    "we explore this possibility below .",
    "alternatively , the gamma - ray luminosity can be produced by an external compton scattering process ( ecs)@xcite . in this particular model",
    "the source of the soft photons is the accretion disk , and these photons scatter off of a plasma of relativistic electrons in a blob .",
    "adapting the formulas of @xcite to our notation :    @xmath33    here , the luminosity ratio is between the observed compton luminosity in the gamma - ray range and the observed accretion luminosity .",
    "@xmath27 refers to the radius of the blob , assuming it is spherical , and @xmath34 refers to the distance between the blob and the accretion disk .",
    "@xmath35 refers to the thomson scattering cross - section , @xmath36 refers to the electron rest mass , @xmath37 has the same meaning as above .",
    "@xmath38 is the doppler factor to correct for bulk relativistic motion of the emitting plasma and is defined by :    @xmath39 here @xmath40 has the usually meaning of ratio of bulk speed to that of light in a vacuum , and @xmath41 is the angle between direction of the bulk flow and the line of sight of the observer .",
    "the power to which the doppler factor is raised is dependent on the structure of the emitting region ( discrete blobs vs. continuous jet ) .",
    "the formula above is correct for discretely emitting blobs . for a continuous jet ,",
    "the power is reduced by one @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that the synchrotron luminosity can be proportional to the ultraviolet luminosity of the seed photons @xcite , thus providing a direct relationship ( though not necessarily linear ) between the gamma - ray and radio luminosity within the framework of the ecs model .",
    "furthermore , the underlying radio and gamma - ray correlation may also be explained by other means , since the gamma - ray luminosity in all relativistic compton scattering models is proportional to the thomson optical depth and the intrinsic radio luminosity can be proportional to the compton optical depth via the parameter @xmath37 and @xmath27 .",
    "other source parameters , such as the magnetic field , would have to fall into a narrow range for the sample in order for this correlation to hold .",
    "the goal of our monte carlo simulations is to generate the luminosities and flux densities of a hypothetical sample that , in principle , mimics the sample of gamma - ray detected blazars discussed above . to do that we need to define a radio luminosity function",
    "from which we will randomly draw to create the sample .",
    "we will also need a distribution of lorentz factors which will be used in determining doppler beaming factors needed to transform between observer frame luminosities and intrinsic luminosities . in addition , we will need a model that determines what the gamma - ray luminosity will be for a given radio luminosity .",
    "we will limit ourselves to the models discussed above .",
    "lastly , we will need to adopt a cosmological model in order to determine redshifts corresponding to randomly chosen enclosed volumes of space .",
    "we can then determine both radio and gamma - ray flux densities using these redshifts and the adopted cosmological model .",
    "following @xcite we have used an assumed radio luminosity function of the form :    @xmath42    valid between @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "we have adopted a luminosity evolution function :    @xmath45 \\eqno{(5)}\\ ] ]    where @xmath46 is the look - back time and @xmath16 is a constant in the approximate range of 0.1 - 0.5 that determines the degree of evolution .",
    "we have also assumed a distribution of lorentz factors for which :    @xmath47    valid between @xmath48 and @xmath49 and a linear model connecting gamma - ray and radio luminosities , i.e. , the inverse compton models discussed above , to generate a simulated sample with monte carlo techniques and then use the corresponding distributions ( luminosity , redshift , flux density , etc . ) and correlation diagrams to assess the validity of the model .",
    "we express these models using the following equations :    @xmath50 @xmath51    here , @xmath52 and @xmath53 refer to the predicted gamma - ray luminosities in the observer s frame , using the ssc and ecs models respectively .",
    "the k constants depend on the parameters discussed above , @xmath54 refers to the intrinsic radio luminosity , and the remaining factors are the appropriate functions of doppler factors for ssc or ecs assuming that the radiation is from discrete blobs @xcite . as mentioned above ,",
    "the powers in each case are reduced by one for the case of a continuous jet .",
    "@xcite rigorously determines radio luminosity function parameters based on simulations of the caltech - jodrell bank sample ( cj - f , as labeled by @xcite ) , taking into account distributions of bulk lorentz factors , redshifts , and luminosities .",
    "@xcite have recently arrived at comparable results for the similar mojave sample ( though the luminosity and redshift ranges differ somewhat ) .",
    "we begin by adopting the parameters that @xcite derived for the cj - f sample .",
    "we expect the cj - f parent population to be very similar to that of our sample , because it is selected for flat spectrum , compact structure and 5 ghz total flux density @xmath5 0.35 jy .",
    "additionally we take into account beaming effects appropriate for the ssc or ecs model . then , assuming both ssc and ecs in turn , the gamma - ray luminosity and flux density is determined for each source . in generating the gamma - ray luminosities from the intrinsic radio luminosities we assume a power - law distribution of the k values discussed above in equations 7 and 8 .",
    "this is an arbitrary choice of distribution , but the precise values of power - law slope and cutoffs do not significantly effect the results .",
    "we then generate 122 sources with gamma - ray flux that could have been detected by egret .",
    "we adjust the gamma - ray flux density limit to be slightly lower than that of egret ( about 85 % ) to allow for a proportion of upper limits that is similar to that we see in our observed sample . in looking for agreement between the simulated population and the observed one",
    ", we use the two distribution kolmogorov - smirnov test on the distributions of luminosity , redshift and flux density . the @xmath55 statistic is then used to measure the discrepancy between the two distributions .",
    "@xmath55 is defined as @xcite :    @xmath56    that is , @xmath55 is the maximum difference ( absolute value ) between the two distribution functions , @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "the distribution function is defined to be the probability that the particular value of the parameter in question is less than x. a value of @xmath55 near zero indicates agreement between the distribution functions , whereas a value near 1 indicates a large discrepancy .",
    "the associated probability is also determined following @xcite . in this case",
    ", a probability approaching 1 indicates a high probability for agreement between the distributions . for distributions that include upper limits we use the corresponding tests using the asurv program",
    "( this is only an issue for the gamma ray flux densities and luminosities).among these tests are the gehan generalized wilcoxon test and the peto & peto generalized wilcoxon test .",
    "the results of these tests are discussed below .",
    "we have applied these methods using the parameters of @xcite , summarized in table 4 . in table 4 , column ( 2 ) gives @xmath43 , column(3 ) gives @xmath44 and they refer to the lower and upper luminosity limits of the intrinsic luminosity function .",
    "column ( 4 ) gives g and refers to the luminosity function power law slope .",
    "column(5 ) gives @xmath48 , column(6 ) gives @xmath49 and column(7)gives s. these labels refer to the lower bulk lorentz factor distribution limit , upper bulk lorentz factor distribution limit and the slope of the power law , respectively .",
    "column ( 8) gives @xmath16 and in this case refers to the evolution parameter , assuming an exponential evolution model ( see equation 5 ) .",
    "column(9 ) gives @xmath59 and is the lower limit to the redshift distribution and column(10 ) gives @xmath60 and is the upper limit .",
    "column ( 11 ) gives @xmath61 as discussed in  2 , column ( 12 ) gives the minimum value of @xmath62 , column ( 13 ) the maximum value of @xmath62 and column ( 14 ) gives the slope of the power - law distribution of @xmath62 , where @xmath62 refers to either @xmath63 or @xmath64 ( equations 7 and 8) , whichever is appropriate for the simulation indicated .",
    "applying the values assumed by @xcite does not immediately lead to good agreement between the observed and modeled distributions ( see table 5 ) . for models",
    "marked `` lister ssc '' we have adopted an ssc model to generate simulated gamma ray luminosities and for `` lister ecs '' we have adopted an ecs model to generate simulated gamma ray luminosities .",
    "next we have explored parameter space to determine where better models might lie . since the number of parameters and the possible range of parameters is large , there are likely to be multiple models that would have similar agreement as seen by a k - s test .",
    "the results that give the lowest value of @xmath55 ( equation 9 ) with high significance are summarized in table 5 for the ssc and ecs models .",
    "column(2 ) gives the @xmath55 value for the radio luminosity function and column(3 ) gives the associated probability that the distributions are drawn from the same parent population .",
    "column(4 ) and column(5 ) give the same results for the gamma ray luminosity distributions , whereas columns ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) do so for redshift , and columns(8)-(11 ) do so for the radio and gamma - ray flux density distributions , respectively .",
    "these results can also be visually inspected in figures 2 - 11 .",
    "there is only weak agreement between the observed and predicted distributions for either ssc or ecs . for the special case of the gamma - ray flux and luminosity distributions ( which have limits as well as measured values ) , we have used the tests discussed above , and generally the associated probabilities ( for agreement of the two distributions ) for these tests fall in the range of 0.0002 - 0.0015 for ssc and 0.0001 - 0.0010 for ecs , thus also only very weakly confirming the ssc or ecs hypothesis .",
    "the parent population in these simulations was approximately 30 million for ssc and 300 million for ecs .",
    "both models require a range of lorentz factors of about 1 - 30 .",
    "this is the approximate range inferred by vlbi observations @xcite .",
    "however , some authors have made the argument that these bulk lorentz factors may not pertain to the same portion of the jet from which the gamma ray emission originates @xcite .",
    "a closer look at figures 2 - 11 show some features that are not as evident from just comparing results of kolgomorov - smirnov tests .",
    "a comparison of the radio luminosity distributions ( figures 2a,2b , & 7 ) shows that assuming an ssc or ecs model lead to similar results .",
    "both the ssc and ecs distributions have peak values near @xmath65 , with approximately 24 % of the sample having values near the peak for ssc and 21 % for ecs . the observed distribution of radio luminosity peaks near @xmath66 with approximately 33 % of the sample in the bin nearest to the peak .",
    "however , in conjunction with the redshift and flux density distributions we do see some important differences between the predictions of the ssc and ecs model , and can pin point particular observations that will be necessary in the glast era for differentiating these models using the methods we have discussed above .",
    "for instance , when looking at the simulated distributions of radio flux density ( fig . 4a , fig .",
    "9 ) , the simulated distribution assuming the ssc model is clearly peaked close to about 0.3 jy , whereas the same distribution for ecs is peaked close to 1.5 jy .",
    "the observed distribution is peaked closer to 0.3 jy and is more similar in overall shape to the predicted ssc distribution ( fig .",
    "ongoing radio monitoring of glast detected sources ( or at least updated to these older survey flux densities ) will be critical for determining the true observed distribution to be used for comparison to models .",
    "in addition , we can see that the redshift distribution ( fig .",
    "6a ) with ssc assumed is nearly identical to the corresponding distribution with ecs assumed ( fig .",
    "though the observed redshift distribution ( fig .",
    "6b ) is also peaked near z=1 , this is at least in part due to the assumed redshifts of z=1 for 13% of the sample .",
    "an additional challenge in th glast era will be obtaining re !",
    "dshifts for entire large samples ( possibly thousands of new quasars that have not yet been optically identified or observed spectroscopically ) .",
    "it is a bit harder to discern significant differences between the ecs and ssc predictions for either gamma - ray luminosity or gamma - ray flux density .",
    "however , a significant increase in sensitivity for glast should clarify the nature of the low - end of each of these diagrams .",
    "for example , we now can only see a very large drop - off in all of the flux densities near @xmath67 jy .",
    "this is caused by the flux detection limit of egret .",
    "in addition , the dramatic increase in number of gamma - ray detected sources to thousands @xcite will clarify the shape of of these distributions and increase the conclusiveness of comparisons to theoretical predictions .",
    "we have also used the monte carlo results to generate simulated luminosity - luminosity correlation plots between @xmath68 and @xmath69 by assuming , in turn , the ssc and ecs models .",
    "the ssc simulations generate the relationship @xmath70 , in agreement with observations .",
    "however , assuming the ecs model generates results with @xmath71 ( the results are plotted in figures 12a and 12b ) .",
    "this clearly shows that though the assumed underlying physical models in both the ssc and ecs case are linear between @xmath72 and @xmath73 , selection effects can lead to a simulated sample that shows a non - linear relationship between the luminosities .",
    "this effect is more pronounced for the ssc case .",
    "this is potentially an effect caused by doppler beaming factors raised to different exponents ( dependent on spectral shape ) .",
    "for instance , in the ssc case , if the exponents for the beaming factors are identical for both the radio and gamma ray part of the spectrum , then we would expect no change in going from the intrinsic luminosity correlations and the observed ones .",
    "however , in our model we do account for the possibility that the gamma - ray spectrum is considerably steeper than the radio spectrum .",
    "this leads to somewhat different exponents for the doppler beaming factors that are going into an overall beaming correction that is applied to the intrinsic radio and gamma ray luminosities .",
    "there are two additional effects which we have not modeled , but may contribute to the observed luminosity correlation",
    ". in particular , the radio source and gamma - ray source may not be spatially coincident , and may thus have different bulk lorentz factors , as discussed above . also , the bulk lorentz factors may be dependent on radio luminosity @xcite .    though similar effects are also at work with ecs process , it is less pronounced in our case due to a selection effect",
    "that is , because the range of @xmath64 is very narrow , and also has relatively low values , only the sources with the highest values of lorentz factors are detected in gamma rays .",
    "thus , relative to the ssc case , the doppler factors are closer to being constant for the sample .",
    "overall , this leads to a relationship between the gamma - ray and radio luminosities that is closer to being linear .",
    "in addition to the luminosity correlation that we have discussed at length we have also observed other significant correlations for the sample .",
    "the origin of the broad band spectral index correlation , @xmath1 vs. @xmath2 ( table 2 ) , becomes clear if we consider the conclusions of @xcite .",
    "they show that gamma - ray dominance ( the ratio of gamma - ray luminosity to luminosity at the model dependent synchrotron peak of the sed ) is positively correlated with the maximum frequency of the lower energy peak of the sed . in a simple homogeneous source",
    ", this lower energy peak corresponds to the upper synchrotron cutoff frequency discussed above .",
    "@xcite show that this correlation is a proxy for the underlying physical relationship between the maximum relativistic electron energy ( on which the low frequency peak strongly depends ) and the ratio of the compton and synchrotron luminosities . for a model",
    "in which both an internal ( ssc ) and external ( ecs ) radiation field are present , an increase in the energy density of the external field leads to an increase in compton cooling and thus a decrease in the maximum electron energy and an increase in the compton gamma - ray luminosity @xcite . @xcite further show that observed optical flux density can be substituted for the ( model dependent ) synchrotron peak flux density without loss of the compton dominance / spectral peak frequency correlation .",
    "we utilize this useful substitution below .",
    "@xcite also show that both @xmath74 and @xmath2 are separately but similarly correlated with this same spectral maximum frequency , so that the latter may be substituted for the former in the absence of x - ray data .",
    "though we have limited spectral data for many sources , and thus ca nt confirm this related correlation for our own sample , the same reasoning should apply to our sample , and thus we make this substitution as well . thus the correlation of @xmath1 and @xmath2 is a possible indicator of the relationship between dominance of gamma - rays produced by the ecs process and maximum electron energy .",
    "however , it is also possible that the broad band spectral index correlation is not independent of the radio / gamma - ray luminosity correlation discussed above .",
    "this is especially true if we take into account the common dependence of both spectral indices on optical luminosity ( table 3 ) .",
    "recent surveys have also suggested that the aforementioned correlations discussed in @xcite and @xcite may be due in part to selection effects @xcite .",
    "for instance , the low luminosity objects of @xcite were mainly x - ray selected , favoring selection of objects with seds peaked at higher frequencies , whereas the high luminosity objects were mainly radio selected , thus favoring the selection of objects with seds peaked at lower frequencies @xcite .    the correlation between radio luminosity and gamma - ray dominance ( which in our analysis would be characterized by @xmath1 ) , originally seen by @xcite is also seen here , after more than doubling the sample size . here , because of the way the broad band indices are defined , a lower value of @xmath1 corresponds to greater gamma - ray dominance .",
    "this correlation is further evidence for a blazar sequence defined by relative importance of the ecs model at higher luminosities .",
    "we have also examined a possible correlation between all parameters individually and the gamma - ray variability @xcite and find only a weak anti - correlation between gamma - ray spectral index , @xmath75 , and variability ( as parameterized by @xcite ; see table 1 ) .",
    "this may be related to a spectral hysteresis effect observed by @xcite for a sample of 26 particularly bright and well observed blazars .",
    "these authors find that during gamma ray flares the spectral index first tends to flatten with increasing flux , and then returns to a steeper index as the flare ends .",
    "thus , it is plausible that if a blazar is more highly variable there will be an increasing chance of observing it while its spectral index is flatter than for other blazars that are not gamma ray variables .",
    "after taking into account statistical tests and monte carlo analysis , we find the following :    1 .   for this sample of 122 gamma - ray blazars",
    "there is a strong correlation between radio and gamma ray luminosity which persists even after the effects of redshift and limits are taken into account .",
    "the correlation is of the form @xmath76 .",
    "this correlation remains with similar regression coefficients even when only the strongest 76 candidates are included in the sample .",
    "2 .   there is a correlation between @xmath1 and @xmath2 as well as a correlation between @xmath73 and @xmath1 .",
    "each correlation is consistent with the increasing dominance of the sed by gamma ray luminosity as the maximum relativistic electron energy decreases and the increasing importance of the ecs process at high radio luminosities and low maximum electron energy .",
    "a detailed simulation of source statistics using monte carlo techniques shows that the relationship @xmath76 can only be reproduced assuming the ssc model . though the assumed intrinsic physical model in the source frame is of the form @xmath77 , selection effects lead to a simulated sample with the relationship described above .",
    "this effect is much less significant when ecs is assumed as the underlying model .",
    "however , upon also comparing the observed and simulated distributions of the luminosities , flux densities and redshifts , both the ssc and ecs models are only weakly consistent with the data , assuming linear dependence of intrinsic gamma ray luminosity on intrinsic radio luminosity . taken together with the previous results , this would suggest that if either ssc or ecs is indeed responsible for the gamma ray emission , a more complex model is likely needed .",
    "in addition , effects of evolution and assumed cosmologies can be explored in more detail .    in the glast era",
    ", our findings can be clarified in the following ways .",
    "acquiring more gamma - ray data , including , particularly , detections of new dim sources near the glast detection limit will clarify whether the correlations we find are caused by truncation effects due to the flux limits of our instruments , or whether this is due , at least in part , to physical causes , at least down to the new limit established by glast .    in order to predict what we might see with glast",
    ", we can extend our observed radio / gamma ray luminosity correlation down to lower luminosities than what are covered in figure 1 .",
    "a radio luminosity of @xmath78 would lead to a gamma ray luminosity of approximately @xmath79 .",
    "we can then covert these luminosities to flux densities for a range of potential redshifts . for z=0.1 - 1.1",
    "the radio flux density would be in the range of 0.8 - 60 mjy and the gamma - ray flux density would be in the range , @xmath80-@xmath81 jy . greater values of redshift would lead to even lower flux density values .",
    "most of the range of radio flux densities ( @xmath5 few mjy ) would be detectable by the green bank telescope ( gbt ) , with the lower limit detectable with the very large array ( vla)@xcite .",
    "assuming that the sensitivity of glast is approximately @xmath82 jy at 100 mev , these sources would only be be detected if @xmath83 .",
    "a radio luminosity of @xmath84 corresponds to a gamma - ray luminosity of @xmath85 .",
    "the radio flux density would fall in the range of 0.1 - 8 mjy for z=0.1 - 1.1 .",
    "these sources could potentially be radio detectable with the vla under optimal conditions . at the higher flux density limit",
    "it would also be possible to detect with gbt , especially at higher frequencies ( i.e. , 40 - 50 ghz)@xcite .",
    "however , if the regression slope were actually closer to 1 , implying a d ! irect proportionality between radio and gamma ray luminosities , then radio sources in the same luminosity , redshift and flux ranges discussed above would not be detected in gamma rays at all . in short , for the observed luminosity relationship for egret blazars to be appreciably extended down to lower luminosities with glast detections , then a large percentage of glast sources near the detection limit would have radio flux densities about 10 mjy or greater ( and @xmath86 ) .",
    "several authors have stated that the predicted number of blazars to be detected by glast rougly matches with the sky density of flat spectrum radio sources down to 50 mjy at 5 ghz @xcite and 65 mjy at 8.4 ghz @xcite .",
    "however , our results show that a large number of glast sources would be detected at even lower radio flux densities if the luminosity relationship we observe for egret sources also holds up for glast sources .",
    "it is very likely that many new radio observations would be required in a !",
    "ny of the cases mentioned above , but especially for cases in w ! hich the putative radio source may not even be in any previous catalog .",
    "> from a theoretical perspective , confirmation of the previously determined correlation between gamma - ray and radio luminosities will lead to confirmation of ssc , though the precise agreement would have to be re - analyzed with these new data .",
