    "neglecting particle correlations , the collective dynamics of many - particle systems interacting via long - range forces obeys the vlasov equation  @xcite : @xmath0 here @xmath1 is the single - particle density function , while @xmath2 and @xmath3 are , respectively , the particle configuration and momentum coordinates .",
    "the long - range force is generated by the self - field @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the particle interaction potential , and @xmath6 is the particle density .",
    "there is growing evidence that the evolution of many - particle systems with long - range interactions lends itself to interpretation in terms of trajectories that trace a finite repertoire of collective patterns with abrupt transitions between them , thus corroborating the claim , stating that only a few effectively active degrees of freedom partake in dynamics of such systems , despite the huge dimensionality of the many - particle state space .",
    "presence of transitions indicates also the relevance of nonlinear dynamical effects : instabilities , which have the capacity to strongly alter the state of a system , even before a gradual thermalization of the particles .",
    "analysis of a dynamical system in terms of the properties of its invariant structures ( equilibria , manifolds , invariant orbits ) has been established as a fruitful approach to gaining insights into the nonlinear evolution of a system  @xcite . in particular",
    ", the stable equilibria can be identified with relevant collective patterns , the hyperbolic manifolds of the unstable equilibria with pathways of transitions . with the information about the lyapunov spectrum and lyapunov eigenvectors of such collective patters , control of the systems",
    "is feasible .",
    "effective representation of the equilibria and of their local lyapunov stability properties are one of the main challenges addressed in this paper . focusing on one - dimensional systems represented by density functions with gaussian - like tails in the momentum variable and spatially periodic boundary conditions in the configuration variable ,",
    "we demonstrate that a fourier - hermite expansion of @xmath7 can reproduce both the lyapunov spectrum and lyapunov eigenvectors with a small number of expansion coefficients .",
    "we also show that introduction of an appropriate scaling parameter , to be identified with the inverse of the system temperature , allows to improve the convergence of an expansion .    as a test model",
    ", we investigate lyapunov stability properties of stationary states of the hamiltonian mean - field ( hmf ) model  @xcite .",
    "prior studies of the hmf model have revealed non - trivial collective oscillations  @xcite and thermodynamical properties that pertain to a large class of long - range interacting systems  @xcite .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in",
    "we introduce the fourier - hermite expansion of a density function and discuss the scaling parameter .",

    "in the following , we focus on one dimensional systems . collective properties of many - particle dynamical systems are typically more evident when the system states are represented in terms of density functions .",
    "further discretization of a density function @xmath7 in terms of a finite set of coefficients @xmath8 provides an alternative representation of the system with , hopefully , few couplings among different @xmath9s . the latter step can be formalized , stating that the density function is a linear map @xmath10 of the coefficients @xmath11 , given by @xmath12 a galerkin projection  @xcite of a density function @xmath7 to a set of coefficients is an example of such a map . for the vlasov equation , discretization in momentum variable commands careful analysis .",
    "therefore we first consider a partial projection of @xmath7 :    [ e : fexpansion ] @xmath13    here @xmath14 are basis functions , and @xmath15 are basis weights .",

    "advantages of hermite polynomials include facts that the basis functions decay as @xmath21 for large @xmath22 , i.e.  in accordance with typical physical boundary conditions , and that the recursion relations , relevant to the vlasov equation , are simple :    [ e : recursion ] @xmath23    in general , the density @xmath24 can be expressed as @xmath25 , where @xmath26 , @xmath27 . in the asymmetrically weighted hermite expansion @xmath28 .",

    "the vlasov dynamics typically proceeds as an interplay between two mechanisms , the advection and the convection , and associated with them there are two scales of spatial variations .",
