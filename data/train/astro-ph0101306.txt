    "in dyer et al . 2000@xcite we used new x - ray synchrotron models along with information from the radio synchrotron spectrum to determine with a new degree of accuracy the total amount of synchrotron emission in the spectrum of sn  1006 .",
    "this analysis can be extended to regions of the supernova remnant ( snr ) .",
    "here we separate the snr into five regions  north and south limbs ( northeast and southwest ) , north and south polar caps and center , as shown in figure 1 .",
    "chandra observations of snrs will be able to analyze much smaller regions , limited only by signal to noise , so these methods of spatial - spectral analysis of complex thermal and nonthermal emission , may be necessary for other snrs .",
    "the synchrotron models were developed @xcite to describe the two dimensional distribution of synchrotron emission observed for a spherically symmetric snr expanding in a uniform upstream magnetic field .",
    "the one - dimensional spectrum extracted for _ sresc _ was was created by summing over the simulated snr .",
    "here we have developed subsets of the _ sresc _ model : _ limb _ , _ center _ and _ cap _ ( shown in figure 1 ) by summing over discrete regions in the simulated snr .",
    "the synchrotron emission from each region has a slightly different spectrum since it samples different populations of electrons interacting with the upstream magnetic field at different obliquity angles .    as in the _ sresc _ model ,",
    "these synchrotron models define the nonthermal emission with three parameters : the radio spectral index @xmath0 , 1  ghz radio flux [ jy ] , and the rolloff [ hz ] .",
    "the rolloff determines the curvature by specifying the frequency at which the model has dropped by a factor of @xmath16 from a powerlaw .",
    "many papers have investigated small changes in spectral index in radio synchrotron emission in snrs@xcite .",
    "however , flux uncertainties in interferometric measurements and nonlinear deconvolution processes have made unambiguous detections of these index changes difficult@xcite . in any case , the expected spectral index variation ( @xmath2 ) are expected to be small compared to the uncertainties in the spectral index ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "here we assume the spectral index is constant across the snr , a prediction that does agree with shock acceleration theory . for integrated spectral analysis",
    "the 1  ghz  flux is readily available .",
    "however , for spatially resolved spectral analysis the flux must be measured in each subregion . for large remnants such as sn  1006",
    "this can be a problem .",
    "maps from interferometers ( such as the vla ) are unsuitable for measuring small scale fluxes , since interferometers are not sensitive to flux on angular scales beyond those corresponding to the smallest spacing . correcting the image by adding a constant to bring it up to the single dish flux has not proven sufficiently accurate in small regions .",
    "the solution is to use images created with both interferometric and single dish data , which sample the flux at all spatial scales .",
    "here we use a map made with the molonglo interferometer plus the parkes single dish telescope@xcite to measure the flux in subregions .",
    "the curvature of the x - ray synchrotron is determined by _",
    "rolloff_. this factor was fixed by fitting a small region in the north limb expected to be dominated by synchrotron emission , and we have assumed , without evidence or theoretical expectation to the contrary , that this value is constant across the snr .",
    "these models reveal that there is significant nonthermal emission throughout sn  1006 . even the polar caps and center , which have prominent thermal lines , contain a synchrotron component ( see table [ table1 ] ) .",
    "as might be expected , it is most difficult to determine the amount of synchrotron emission in regions where thermal emission dominates .",
    "model fits of the center of sn  1006 will tolerate up to 16% of the flux in synchrotron .",
    "differences in temperature and abundances between the fits may make it possible to argue for or against a synchrotron component for the center of the remnant .",
    "lcc region & & + center & _ center _ & @xmath416 north polar cap & _ cap _ & 13 south polar cap & _ cap _ & 8 north limb & _ limb _ & 37    unfortunately there are no entirely satisfactory thermal models available to describe emission from type ia supernova remnants , such as sn  1006 .",
    "any attempts to model the thermal emission run into several complications : young snrs such as sn  1006 may require solutions intermediate between self - similar driven wave and sedov@xcite .",
    "integrated fits to the full remnant showed high abundances @xcite suggesting a reverse shock , so a two - shock description may be necessary . in light of this",
    "we use the plane shock model _",
    "vpshock _ as a starting point , making note of the fact it allows a range of ionization timescales , and can describe heavy element ejecta , but assumes a constant density and temperature .",
    "we have found that there is significant nonthermal emission in all regions of the sn  1006 , not only the limbs . with these new models",
    "it is now possible to separate the thermal and nonthermal emission in spatially resolved regions ( just in time for chandra observations ) .",
    "this is an absolute prerequisite if the thermal emission is to be understood .",
    "this work allows us to address new questions , among them : tev @xmath5-rays have been observed from the north limb but not the south limb of sn  1006 .",
    "are there differences in the synchrotron emission from the two limbs ?",
    "preliminary results indicate that the curvature is different for synchrotron in the north and south limb .",
    "h@xmath0 is observed at the edge of the north polar cap region .",
    "does the x - ray description of the thermal shock agree with optical observations ?",
