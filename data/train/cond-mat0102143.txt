    "unconventional superconductivity appears with a large variety of possible phases displaying many properties that are not shared by conventional @xmath3-wave superconductors .",
    "these phases are characterized by their symmetry properties , and in most cases not only the u(1)-gauge symmetry but other symmetries are also spontaneously broken .",
    "interesting physics emerges , in particular , when time - reversal symmetry @xmath4 is violated in a superconductor .",
    "volovik and gorkov have classified such superconducting states into two categories , the so - called `` ferromagnetic '' and the `` antiferromagnetic '' states.@xcite they are distinguished by the internal angular momentum of cooper pairs . in the ferromagnetic state",
    "the cooper pairs possess either a finite orbital or ( for non - unitary states ) spin moment , while in the antiferromagnetic state they have no net moments .",
    "examples of these two types of states were recently discussed in connection with high - temperature superconductors ; the so - called @xmath5-wave state represents a ferromagnetic pairing state , while the @xmath6-wave state is antiferromagnetic . in high - temperature superconductors",
    "a @xmath7-violating state is most likely to be realized only near surfaces or interfaces at very low temperatures.@xcite among the heavy fermion superconductors there are two well - known systems which have @xmath8-violating bulk superconducting phases : upt@xmath9 and u@xmath10th@xmath11be@xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "these materials show superconducting double transitions , and @xmath8-violation is associated with the second of the two transitions.@xcite a more recent candidate for @xmath8-violating superconductivity is sr@xmath14ruo@xmath15,@xcite a layered perovskite compound .",
    "experimentally , sr@xmath14ruo@xmath15 shows clear features of a strongly correlated quasi - two - dimensional fermi liquid above the onset temperature of superconductivity @xmath161.5k .",
    "it was suggested@xcite that , since this system in the normal state behaves like a two - dimensional analogue to @xmath17he , the superconducting phase would correspond to the superfluid a - phase , which is a well - known @xmath8-violating pairing state.@xcite indeed , the experimental evidence@xcite for unconventional superconductivity in sr@xmath14ruo@xmath15 is consistent with the basic order parameter symmetry,@xcite @xmath18 a @xmath19-wave ( spin - triplet ) state .",
    "here we have used the standard notation of the @xmath20-vector to represent the order parameter of the triplet state:@xcite @xmath21 , where @xmath22 are the pauli matrices .",
    "the @xmath20-vector ( [ chirp ] ) pointing along the @xmath23 direction implies that the spin part of the cooper pair wave function is the spin - triplet state with @xmath24 , i.e. , in - plane equal - spin pairing ( the @xmath23 direction is along the @xmath25-axis of sr@xmath14ruo@xmath15 ) . in a system with cylindrical symmetry",
    "the orbital part of the pair wave function is a state with finite angular momentum along the @xmath23-axis , @xmath26 . obviously the state represented by eq .",
    "( [ chirp ] ) is `` ferromagnetic , '' and is also called _ chiral @xmath19-wave _ state .",
    "the chirality of this superconducting state is characterized by a topological number @xmath27 defined by@xcite @xmath28 the unit vector @xmath29 is @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the kinetic energy measured from the chemical potential @xmath32 .",
    "( throughout this paper we will assume the cylindrical symmetry whenever microscopic modeling is necessary , although the inclusion of crystal field effects is straightforward .",
    "note that , being topological , the number @xmath33 can be defined without resorting to the cylindrical symmetry . )",
    "the topological number @xmath33 corresponds to the multiplicity of the wrapping of a sphere @xmath34 in the mapping of @xmath35 to another @xmath34 representing the unit vector @xmath36 .",
    "the vector @xmath37 does not vanish at any @xmath38 , allowing us to define the topological number @xmath33 uniquely . in the chiral @xmath19-wave state ( [ chirp ] ) the topological number @xmath33 is either @xmath39 or @xmath40 depending on the chirality of the state or the orbital angular momentum .",
    "a chiral superconductor has gapless chiral edge modes at interfaces between states of opposite chiralities ( domain walls ) or between a chiral state and a vacuum ( surface ) , as dictated by the index theorem .",
    "volovik pointed out@xcite that the topological invariant @xmath33 determines the number of gapless edge modes per spin at a boundary between different states.@xcite this yields @xmath41 such modes at the interface of two domains characterized by the topological numbers @xmath42 and @xmath43 , respectively . at an interface between a chiral @xmath19-wave state and a vacuum we find two modes ( one per spin ) .",
    "these states can be easily understood in terms of andreev bound states.@xcite recent point contact experiments provide the first indication for these states at the surface of sr@xmath14ruo@xmath15.@xcite    the presence of gapless chiral edge modes is reminiscent of quantum hall fluids .",
    "one can thus expect a chiral superconductor to have a hall effect .",
    "this is a spontaneous hall effect ( she ) in the sense that a transverse voltage appears in response to an external current even without an external magnetic field applied to the superconductor.@xcite the hall conductance is not quantized , however , contrary to a naive analogy .",
    "this is because the electric current can be carried as a supercurrent by superconducting condensate , or , in other words , the local charge density is not a conserved quantity in a superconductor.@xcite in fact , it has been shown@xcite that the spin and the thermal hall conductance are quantized to the topological number @xmath33 in appropriate units .",
    "even though it is non - universal , the spontaneous ( charge ) hall effect is interesting in its own right because it is an effect which can be experimentally measured , in principle .",
    "thus we would like to investigate in detail in this paper the origin and magnitude of the effect .",
    "to this end , it is necessary to understand what one would actually measure in an experiment trying to observe the she . computing a diagram for",
    "the current - current correlation function in a bulk superconductor does not give a proper solution to this problem .",
    "on the contrary , we have to understand physics near a surface of a chiral superconductor , taking into account issues such as ( 1 ) the spatial variation of the order parameter near the surface , ( 2 ) the spontaneous current running along the surface of the chiral superconductor , and ( 3 ) screening effects for both magnetic field and electric field in the superconductor .",
    "we study the surface properties using three different approaches : a numerical self - consistent analysis of the bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) equation , an extended ginzburg - landau ( gl ) theory with a scalar potential , and a phenomenological hydrodynamic formulation .",
    "we find that there are two basic contributions to the she .",
    "the first is the bernoulli force due to spontaneous currents which flow near the surface .",
    "they are the consequence of the chiral surface states , but can also be understood in terms of a transverse order parameter textures .",
    "naturally they lead to a hall response .",
    "the second originates from the intrinsic magnetic moment of the cooper pairs in the chiral @xmath19-wave state .",
    "the former contribution is present in both chiral and non - chiral superconductors , since both can have spontaneous surface currents , while the latter contribution exists only in chiral superconductors .",
    "we therefore conclude that even a non - chiral ( antiferromagnetic ) @xmath8-violating superconductor can have a she .",

    "there is a finite excess charge at the surface , which is screened due to thomas - fermi screening . as a result the charge density forms a dipole layer and is overall charge neutral",
    "this is the constraint that we have imposed by fixing the external electrical field to zero ( note that in our hall bar geometry a finite charge or equivalently a finite external electric field would correspond to an infinite field energy , since the capacitance is zero ) .",
    "the dipole layer induces a local electric field and causes a shift of the scalar potential relative to its value in the bulk of the superconductor which we choose to be zero .",
    "the charge distributions and potential at the surface are the same on both sides of the bar .    under the assumption that the hall bar is symmetric about @xmath130",
    ", there is no potential difference between the two sides .",
    "we would like to mention that scalar potential variations close to the surface are not unique to chiral superconducting states , but occur in any superconductor whose order parameter is influenced by surface scattering .",
    "if we introduce a net current driven from an external source , this external current will be distributed equally to both surfaces [ see fig .  [",
    "fig : bdg2](a ) ] .",
    "this affects the surface states differently for the two sides , because on one side the external current flows with the spontaneous current , on the other against it .",
    "furthermore , the scalar potential is not equal anymore at the two sides because the charge dipole layers are modified differently , as we can see in fig .",
    "[ fig : bdg2](b ) .",
    "this transverse voltage difference depends on the orientation of the external current and appears in the absence of an external magnetic field , thereby referred to as the she .",
    "our calculation clearly shows a linear relation between the source current @xmath120 and the transverse voltage @xmath131 as expected for the hall effect .",
    "deviations occur only when the current approaches the critical value where the order parameter starts to be strongly affected by the current . in fig .",

    "there is also a strong dependence on the material dependent parameters , indicating that the behavior is non - universal .",
    "unfortunately , in the numerical bdg scheme we are limited in the choice of @xmath136 , @xmath129 , @xmath2 and @xmath137 , because large difference in their magnitudes demands large - scale computation . in the next section we study",

    "the quantitative comparison with the self - consistent solution of the bdg equations encounters some drawback from the fact that for the sake of numerical accuracy the cutoff energy @xmath112 had to be taken comparable to the fermi energy .",
    "therefore , there are larger strong - coupling corrections not included in our phenomenological analysis .",
    "nevertheless , we find a reasonably good agreement between the phenomenological and the bdg estimates .",
    "the result from the numerical bdg calculation ( @xmath377 and @xmath378 ) is @xmath379 while eq .",
    "( [ v_h - from - hydro-2 ] ) with the same parameters ( apart from @xmath112 ) leads to @xmath380 the discrepancy is not only a result of weak - coupling versus strong - coupling approach , but we would like to remind that we have also used an approximate description of the order parameter texture at the surface .    obviously the resistance obtained here is considerably smaller than the universal unit @xmath381 .",
    "we would like to build now a connection between the she and the ordinary hall effect .",
    "we may look for the intrinsic magnetic field which causes the hall response to the externally induced current @xmath120 .",
    "comparing eq .",
    "( [ v_h - from - hydro-2 ] ) with the standard expression of the hall effect , @xmath382 we obtain the effective magnetic field @xmath383 the effective field corresponds to the density of magnetic moments of cooper pairs which is not the reduced magnetic moment in ( [ zeeman ] ) , but rather the full moment which is associated with the change of the cooper pair density .",
    "note that the factor @xmath384 $ ] is due to inhomogeneous field and current distribution .",
    "next we consider the reciprocal effect . in the presence of a weak external electric field",
    "@xmath385 at @xmath230 , the scalar potential in the superconductor receives a small perturbation , @xmath386 .",
    "this yields a small change in the current density , @xmath387 \\nonumber\\\\ & = & -2ce\\gamma n(0)ee^{-x/\\ell}\\left [ \\ell\\left(\\frac{e}{c}v_{ty}+\\frac{e^2}{mc^2}a^{(0)}_y\\right ) -\\mu_z\\right]\\hat{\\bbox{y}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which determines the change in the vector potential @xmath388 . solving the london equation , we find @xmath389 since the thomas - fermi screening length @xmath133 is much shorter than @xmath227 and @xmath2 , we may set @xmath390 , @xmath391 , and @xmath392 in @xmath393 in the integrand . with this approximation",
    "we obtain @xmath394 .",

    "( [ a_y^0(0 ) ] ) and ( [ delta a_y(0 ) ] ) for the approximate form ( [ approximate - eta_x ] ) , yielding @xmath396 in good agreement with the gl analysis .",
    "unfortunately , in this case the comparison with the bdg result does not agree well , which we attribute to the fact that @xmath136 is comparable to the other length scales in the numerical calculation .",
    "thus , there are strong correction to the above result in addition to the strong - coupling corrections .      although the phenomenon we discuss in this paper can be compared to the standard hall effect , it has actually some quite distinct aspects .",
    "flowing currents are an equilibrium property of the superconductor .",
    "it is , therefore , impossible to measure the transverse voltage by means of a standard voltmeters , using direct contacts to the surfaces .",
    "this problem was realized already more than 30 years ago , when the bernoulli response to a current was investigated in conventional superconductors.@xcite in this case a potential difference between the surface and the interior of the superconductor is expected , which is proportional to the square of the running current : @xmath397 the potential difference is actually independent of temperature as has been observed@xcite for pb .",
    "the method of measurement was based on a thin - film capacitor which picks up the voltage signal caused by an ac - current on the superconductor surface .",
    "the same kind of capacitor technique could also be used to detect the spontaneous hall effect . in an ac - measurement",
    "the above bernoulli force ( @xmath398 ) yields the second harmonic of the applied ac - current , while the signal corresponding to the she ( @xmath399 ) contributes to the first harmonic .",
    "hence we can distinguish the she from the standard bernoulli effect .",
    "we can estimate the magnitude of the hall response @xmath400 where @xmath401 is the total current running through a three - dimensional sample consisting of @xmath402 layers . using typical values for ordinary metals ( for example , @xmath403 at @xmath108 ) ,",
    "we obtain @xmath404 . if @xmath405na , then we expect @xmath406nv , which might be experimentally accessible . under the same conditions the conventional bernoulli signal is considerably smaller , @xmath407pv . it is worth noting that the capacitor technique in measuring the transverse potential change does not require a hall bar geometry , but a single surface is sufficient .",
    "unfortunately , besides the high sensitivity necessary in this kind of measurements a further problem has to be taken into account .",
    "this is the formation of domains of degenerate superconducting states with opposite chiralities .",
    "such domain formation is very likely to occur when a system enters the superconducting state .",
    "the two domains with opposite chiralities yield opposite sign of the transverse voltage so that the net effect might be diminished . since the spontaneous hall voltage is a surface effect , the number of domain walls intersecting the surface matters .",
    "it would be necessary to establish an experimental technique to realize a single domain phase , for example , by cooling in a weak magnetic field .",
    "we now consider the possibility of a spontaneous hall effect in non - chiral time reversal symmetry breaking superconductors . while for these superconducting states",
    "there is no anomalous cs - like coupling between scalar and vector potential , there are still spontaneous surface currents for certain orientations of the sample boundaries , despite the fact that the cooper pairs do not have a net angular momentum .",
    "these surface currents can be associated with andreev bound states .",
    "thus we would expect at least to find a contribution to the she due to the bernoulli force .",
    "we consider one of the well - known examples of a non - chiral superconducting state in a quasi - two - dimensional system that violates time - reversal symmetry , the @xmath408-wave state .",
    "we assume that the @xmath118-wave state has the @xmath409-symmetry , for which a spontaneous surface current runs along surfaces normal to the [ 100 ] or [ 010]-direction.@xcite it is possible here to express the spontaneous current again as a result of the order parameter texture analogous to ( [ spont - velo ] ) : @xmath410 where @xmath411 and @xmath412 denote the order parameters of the @xmath3-wave and @xmath413-wave component respectively .",
    "the currents can be of similar magnitude as for the chiral @xmath414-wave state and consequently the size of the she is comparable . there are , of course , some differences from the former case .",
    "since the two pairing components are not degenerate in general , various additional parameters may appear in the discussion .",
    "we have performed a bdg calculation for a specific set of parameters to verify the expectation of the above argument .",
    "figure [ fig : d+is ] shows the data obtained from the self - consistent solution of the bdg equation for the @xmath415-wave state at zero temperature . here",
    "we present the results for the case where a finite net current is running in the system . again",
    "the order parameter shows strong variation at the surface , whereby the @xmath118-wave component is suppressed and the @xmath3-wave component enhanced [ fig .",
    "[ fig : d+is](a ) ] .",
    "looking at the quasiparticle spectrum in fig .",
    "[ fig : d+is](b ) , we see obvious differences between the chiral and the non - chiral cases . in both cases there",
    "are chiral andreev bound states below the ordinary continuous spectra of scattering states . in the non - chiral case",
    ", however , there is no gapless edge mode , in accordance with the expectation from the index theorem .",
    "the electromagnetic properties in the hall bar geometry , shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : d+is](c ) and ( d ) , are very similar to the chiral case .",
    "also , the hall resistance @xmath138 for the parameters indicated in the figure caption is of similar magnitude .",
    "we thus conclude that for certain surface orientations the measurement of the transverse voltage in a non - chiral state gives a qualitatively identical result to a chiral state .",
    "hence , experiments of this kind on the [ 110 ] surface of high - temperature superconductors , where a low - temperature time - reversal symmetry breaking phase may be present , would not be able to give decisive results as to which state is realized , the non - chiral @xmath416-wave state or the chiral @xmath417-wave state .",
    "we have analyzed in detail the spontaneous hall effect in time reversal symmetry breaking quasi - two - dimensional superconductor of chiral and non - chiral nature .",
    "there are two contributions to the she .",
    "one is connected with the bernoulli ( or lorentz ) force due to the presence of spontaneous surface currents .",
    "the other originates from the presence of an orbital angular momentum of cooper pairs .",
    "while the former contribution appears in both types of superconducting states , there is no angular momentum in the non - chiral case .",
    "we have shown in our phenomenological treatment that the angular momentum gives rise to a chern - simons - like term in the lagrangian determining the electromagnetism of the superconductor , similar to derivations based on topological arguments.@xcite although it was suggested that the hall response would be , at least , close to a universal value , our analysis shows that the actual measurement of the hall voltage gives a considerably smaller non - universal value .",
    "nevertheless , the comparison of the she with the ordinary hall effect reveals the presence of an intrinsic effective magnetic field corresponding to the density of cooper pair magnetic moments .",
    "the effect depends on the presence of spontaneous surface currents . in our analysis",
    "we have restricted ourselves to the case of a perfect , specularly scattering surface .",
    "rough surfaces with diffuse scattering would reduce the spontaneous currents and the hall voltage .",
    "moreover , domain formation constitutes another obstacle to the measurement of the she , because different domains give contributions of opposite signs . nevertheless , we believe that experimental techniques available at present are sufficiently accurate to observe the spontaneous hall effect .",
