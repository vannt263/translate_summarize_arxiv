    "the knowledge of neutron fluxes in underground laboratories is crucial in experiments searching for and detecting rare events associated with neutrino interactions , double - beta decay and dark matter wimps ( weakly interacting massive particles ) .",
    "for example , in dark matter searches , in order to reach 10@xmath1  pb sensitivity to the wimp - nucleon cross - section , the neutron flux produced by muons underground must be known and suitably attenuated .",
    "other sources of neutrons can , in principle , be mitigated by using radio - pure materials and components together with appropriate shielding . in many existing underground laboratories ( gran sasso , wipp , kamioka , modane , boulby and others )",
    "the muon - induced neutron flux may be a key limiting factor for detector sensitivity and may require an active veto system to be installed around the target",
    ". this can easily be the dominant cost in a large detector system .",
    "atmospheric muons , generated in extensive air showers at high altitudes in the atmosphere , penetrate deep underground and produce neutrons in the rock surrounding a laboratory or in the materials inside it .",
    "most neutrons do not come directly from muon - nucleus spallation reactions , but from the muon - initiated hadronic and electromagnetic cascades .",
    "these neutrons spread away from the primary muon track , thermalising slowly , and finally get captured by protons or other nuclei .",
    "some , however , can strike a nucleus in the target volume transferring sufficient energy to be detected .",
    "this is an irreducible background for many underground experiments . in dark matter searches ,",
    "for example , the single nuclear - recoil signals from neutron elastic scattering can not be distinguished from wimp interactions .",
    "an increased gamma activity of some materials is also expected from neutron activation .",
    "underground neutron fluxes are difficult to measure since they are overwhelmed by gamma - rays from local radioactivity . in addition , most neutrons at the aforementioned underground laboratories come from rock radioactivity : muon - induced neutrons contribute typically less than one percent to the total , unshielded neutron flux .",
    "although these neutron events may have a clear signature of an associated muon and/or cascade , large detectors are needed to study them with sufficient accuracy , especially to understand the neutron behaviour at large distances from the muon track .",
    "monte carlo ( mc ) simulations are thus crucial in designing high - sensitivity detectors .",
    "naturally , this reliance on simulation alone must be accompanied by validation of the codes against other experimental data , and by comparison between different packages .",
    "fluka @xcite is a well - established simulation tool in nuclear and particle physics , and has been used for neutron calculations in a variety of experiments .",
    "however , it does not treat the elastic scattering of neutrons at low energies with sufficient detail ( on an event - by - event basis ) for the purpose of dark matter experiments .",
    "so - called ` kerma ' factors are used to generate energy deposition from nuclear recoils ( other than protons ) , which are equivalent to the average recoil energy for a certain neutron energy .",
    "the geant4 @xcite toolkit can potentially be used for end - to - end simulations of experiments , from background calculations down to detailed detector characterisation .",
    "its object - oriented design and open - source nature make it rather flexible .",
    "critically , it generates and tracks in a realistic way the recoiling nuclei from individual neutron elastic interactions .    in this paper",

    "muon propagation from the surface is not addressed here . instead , the mc code musun @xcite was used to calculate the muon energy spectrum and angular distribution at boulby in the way described in paper  3 .",
    "the present simulations made use of geant4 release 6.2 and fluka-2003 .",
    "the fluka modelling described in paper  3 was performed with fluka-2002 , whereas the results of paper  1 and paper  2 were obtained using fluka-1999 .",

    "the physics implemented in the toolkit is fully described in ref .",
    "muon - induced spallation ( or muon photonuclear interaction ) is modelled above 1  gev muon energy ; the final - state generator relies on parameterised hadronic models .",
    "gamma inelastic scattering , the real photonuclear interaction , generates its hadronic final states using a chiral - invariant phase - space decay model below 3  gev ; a theoretical quark - gluon string model simulates the punch - through reaction at higher energies .",
    "the hadronic interaction of nucleons , pions and kaons is simulated with the quark - gluon string model above 6  gev , an intra - nuclear binary cascade model at lower energies and a pre - equilibrium de - excitation stage below 70  mev .",
    "the equilibrium stage considers fragment and gamma evaporation , fission , fermi break - up and multi - fragmentation of highly - excited nuclei .",
    "neutron transport and interactions are described by data - driven models below 19  mev .",
    "the choice of electromagnetic physics is more straightforward and will not be described here , except to say that the so - called ` low energy ' package was used for @xmath2 and gammas interactions , and the standard models were applied to the remaining particles ( including muons ) .",

    "we compared the muon energy spectra at the end of the block from geant4 , fluka and the muon propagation code music @xcite and found them to be in good agreement @xcite .",
    "this validates the methods used to calculate muon interaction cross - sections .",

    "one must avoid double - counting inelastically scattered ones , which often share the final state with newly generated neutrons . in the geant4 simulation",
    "we consider that the highest energy one in the final state corresponds to the initial neutron and remove it from the count ( akin to the concept of ` stars ' in fluka ) .",
    "for muon energies below @xmath0100  gev one must also correct for muon energy loss , since the neutron yield decreases noticeably as the muon progresses through the material .",

    "the relative contributions of the most important mechanisms to the total neutron rate are shown in fig .",
    "[ processes1 ] for geant4 .",
    "there is a degree of agreement between the two codes , in that both predict neutron production in electromagnetic cascades ( real photonuclear interaction ) to dominate at lower energies and to decrease in importance with increasing muon energy , and generation in hadronic cascades to become more important with increasing muon energy .",
    "both codes confirm that most neutrons are not produced in direct muon - induced spallation , but rather in the cascades muons initiate , and more so at higher energies .",
    "however , the geant4 results reveal a greater dominance of electromagnetic cascades at low energies ( higher total neutron yield , cf . fig .  [ scintillator ] ) , and this scenario is not significantly different at high energies , where fluka predicts neutron production in hadronic cascades to take over . in this material , although geant4 appears to overproduce neutrons in electromagnetic cascades , it underproduces in hadronic cascades compared to fluka , giving similar total yield in both codes .",
    "it should be noted that this could be due to a difference in the total interaction cross - sections , in the neutron - production cross - sections or in the final - state multiplicity of secondary particles .        the neutron energy spectrum at production in the scintillator , calculated in the way described above for the total neutron yield , is shown in fig .",

    "these data are compared with a parameterisation of the relative spectrum given in paper  2 for fluka .",
    "measurements with the lvd detector @xcite , located at the gran sasso underground laboratory ( mean depth of 3.6 km w.e . ) , are also shown  normalised for visual agreement . although these experimental data do not show the neutron energy spectrum at production , but a volume - averaged spectrum instead , they are nevertheless a useful guide .",
    "note that the parameterisation of the neutron spectrum given in paper  2 does not show a feature above @xmath010 mev due to the giant dipole resonance ( gdr ) and the so - called ` quasi - deuteron ' region .",
    "this feature is , however , also seen in the fluka spectrum , averaged over the entire scintillator volume , presented in paper  1 .",
    "neutrons can be created some distance away from the primary muon track , an issue to consider when modelling veto performances .",
    "the fluka ` star density ' output is an estimator for the spatial distribution of neutron reactions , which can be compared to experimental measurements carried out with large scintillator volumes  as reported in paper  1 .",
    "a fluka ` star ' is a hadronic inelastic interaction ( neutron spallation , in this instance ) above a certain energy threshold .",
    "an equivalent quantity was calculated from the geant4 dataset , which was obtained for the input muon spectrum expected at 2.8  km  w.e . underground . the result",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ lateral ] .",
    "both simulations agree well with the lvd measurement @xcite . more recent lvd data @xcite suggest a higher number of neutrons at large distances from the muon track .",
    "note , however , that lvd is not a detector with a single uniform medium but has a modular structure with gaps between modules .",
    "thus any such comparison should be considered with caution .      neutron production in several other materials of interest to low background experiments was studied with geant4 for a fixed muon energy of 280  gev , using the block geometry and the neutron event selection rules described previously for organic scintillator .",
    "the variation of the total neutron yield with atomic weight of the element ( or average atomic weight for compounds ) is shown in fig .",

    "the statistical uncertainty associated with each data point is much smaller than the discrepancy between corresponding fluka and geant4 data points .",

    "[ processes2 ] break down the contribution of five inelastic scattering processes at 280  gev muon energy .",
    "real photonuclear interactions clearly dominate in all materials , increasing linearly with @xmath30 .",
    "this is indeed the dependence expected for the total cross - section , suggesting that the number of neutrons produced per reaction remains approximately constant  confirmed by the geant4 team @xcite .",
    "photoproduction in fluka gives less neutrons in scintillator ( @xmath39 compared to @xmath40 n/@xmath41/(g/@xmath5 ) in geant4 ) and more neutrons in lead ( @xmath42 and @xmath43 n/@xmath41/(g/@xmath5 ) , respectively ) .",
    "secondary neutron production in geant4 , resulting from neutron inelastic scattering , increases slightly more slowly ( @xmath44 ) than photoproduction .",
    "yields from pion ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 ) , proton and muon spallations vary approximately as @xmath45 .",
    "the scattered nature of the data for a given process is not statistical in origin .",
    "the relative error for direct muon spallation ( which also governs hadronic cascade statistics ) , is only a few percent .    in conclusion , muon - induced neutron production in geant4 is generally lower than that in fluka at high muon energies , although this difference is typically smaller than a factor of 2  an acceptable agreement for many purposes .",
    "this is due to a generalised neutron deficit from hadronic cascades .",
    "this underproduction with respect to fluka may be expected , since the latter does not model the emission of fast nuclear fragments from highly - excited nuclei ( multi - fragmentation ) , especially important in heavy nuclei , thus leaving more energy available for neutron evaporation @xcite . in heavy elements",
    "electromagnetic cascades also underproduce neutrons with respect to fluka but this is not the case for the light hydrocarbon scintillator .",

    "the first result is in good agreement with the mc predictions ( especially fluka s )  assuming that the total neutron yield was measured in the experiments  whereas the second clearly indicates a higher yield than the simulations .",
    "moreover , the quoted target thickness for these experiments is too small for the muon - induced cascades to develop fully , thus reducing the number of detected neutrons and making direct comparison difficult . in conclusion",
    ", some experiments may suggest that both fluka and geant4 underestimate neutron production in heavy targets , although more conclusive measurements are required .",
    "the inelastic scattering of muons off nuclei can be explained in terms of the exchange of quasi - real virtual photons  hence it is also known as the muon photonuclear interaction .",

    "several conclusions can be drawn from the data shown .",
    "firstly , if either mc is to be believed , then the experiment could not measure direct muon - induced spallation exclusively .",
    "the contribution of secondary reactions can not be neglected , especially for the carbon and copper targets .",
    "secondly , both codes agree quite reasonably , in fact better than anticipated given the results presented in the previous section . therefore the discrepancy observed for pb in fig .",

    "finally , it is apparent that the experimental points lie far above the mc data .",
    "if the disagreement for the light materials is already unreasonable , the case of lead can not be easily explained .",
    "in fact , even if a much lower neutron threshold of 1  mev is considered , both mc models would still predict a lower cross - section than those reported in ref .",

    "the simulations agree within statistical errors in the low - energy region below 100  kev .",
    "the discrepancy observed near 100  kev may be due to isotope - production followed by radioactive decay with gamma emission , which was modelled in the fluka simulation but not considered in this geant4 work .",
    "fluka predicts more gammas than geant4 between 100  kev and a few tens of mev  which is not surprising considering that it also produces more neutrons  but the general agreement is still reasonable . at higher energies , where the passage of primary muons causes",

    "the total number of recoils with any energy predicted by geant4 for the 250  kg target is 217@xmath339 per year , of which 10.3@xmath331.9 are not accompanied by additional energy deposits . in the visible energy range of 210  kev , where most wimp signals should occur",
    ", 3.3@xmath331.1 recoils are expected per year .",
    "a similar figure of 3.9@xmath331.0 is predicted by fluka .",
    "the results from the two codes are compared in table  [ table1 ] .",
    "note that the numbers presented in table  [ table1 ] for fluka agree with the previous simulations ( paper  3 ) for the total recoil rate , but are a factor of 2 smaller for ` pure ' nuclear recoil events .",
    "this is due to the lower energy cuts for gammas and electrons used in the present simulations ( 50 kev for xenon and its vessel , 100 kev for hydrocarbon and lead and 1 mev for rock ) .",
    "this makes the probability of coincidences between nuclear recoils and gammas / electrons in xenon higher , and reduces the rate of ` pure ' nuclear recoils .",
    "a detector with good spatial resolution can resolve the locations of multiple neutron elastic interactions , which occur on average several cm apart .",
    "these are not regarded as irreducible background since they should not be caused by wimps .",

    " i.e. which have a realistic chance of being detected  the fraction of single scatters decreases to 14% .",
    "finally , the simulation registered 2.6@xmath331.0 single recoils per year in the energy range 210  kev  e.e . , whereas fluka indicates 2.1@xmath330.7 recoils per year . in both mcs",

[ shielding ] :",
    "although the _ total _ yields from fluka can be a factor of 2 higher in materials such as salt and lead , the actual integral flux above 1  mev , capable of producing detectable nuclear recoils , differs by about 2030% .",
    "20  mev.,width=321 ]    although the nuclear recoil spectrum is generally harder in fluka than in geant4 , the number of events at 210  kev does not differ much in the two models .",
    "the difference between these spectra is mainly explained by the different treatment of neutron elastic scattering in the two codes .",
    "the data - based models describing elastic interactions below 20  mev are more accurate in geant4 than in fluka .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ nelastic ] , which plots the nuclear recoil energies in the xenon target obtained with fluka against the corresponding neutron energy .",
    "a new dataset was generated with geant4 for a log - uniform neutron energy distribution , also shown in the figure . both mcs exhibit a discontinuity at @xmath4720  mev , where parameterised models take over from the low - energy ones .",
    "the most striking difference is that fluka generates mono - energetic recoils ( based on kerma factors ) for a fixed neutron energy in the low energy region , whereas geant4 is much more accurate , reproducing the full recoil spectrum .",
    "we have investigated how geant4 and fluka model muon - induced neutrons in bulk matter in an attempt to validate these monte carlo codes for the simulation of the neutron backgrounds expected in underground laboratories .",
    "the total yields , neutron energy spectrum and lateral distribution from the muon track in hydrocarbon material obtained with both codes are consistent with the available measurements , with geant4 predicting fewer neutrons than fluka above @xmath0100  gev muon energy by a small factor ( @xmath6830% ) . in most other materials studied , geant4 also generates lower neutron fluxes for muon energies in the hundreds of gev . at 280  gev , the typical average muon energy at several underground laboratories , the total neutron yield can be a factor of 2 lower for some materials .",
    "these include salt and lead , which are important as rock and shielding media . in general",
    ", geant4 shows enhanced neutron photoproduction in electromagnetic cascades in light materials , although this tendency is less marked relative to the recent fluka release . for heavy elements , fluka produces more neutrons than geant4 in both electromagnetic and hadronic cascades initiated by muons . a new theory - driven model for the hadronic vertex of the muon - nucleus interaction will appear in a future geant4 release @xcite , which may increase the hadronic yields .",
    "experimental yields obtained for pb @xcite appear to be mutually inconsistent , but may suggest that both simulations underestimate neutron production in heavy targets . direct production in muon spallation reactions",
    "is similar in both codes , although the simulated rates for fast neutrons ( @xmath6110  mev ) disagree with experimental data obtained in the cern na55 experiment .",
    "such marked disagreement is not observed with measurements by the e665 collaboration for neutrons under 10  mev .",
    "the two packages were used to model the muon - induced background in an idealised wimp detector containing 250  kg of liquid xenon as an active medium .",
    "the simulated total fluxes of fast neutrons ( @xmath611  mev ) entering the underground cavern were found to agree within 20% .",
    "similar agreement was obtained for the neutron flux emerging after 30  cm of lead and 50  cm of hydrocarbon shielding .",
    "the nuclear recoil spectrum observed in the xenon target is slightly harder in the fluka simulation , which also predicts a small excess of ` pure ' recoil events .",
    "however , both simulations indicate a similar number of recoils with visible energy of 210  kev . a single - recoil rate of the order of 2  events / year is predicted by both models , which is probably not far below the value expected from an ` ideal ' monte carlo code",
    ". we do not expect a large enhancement in the neutron flux after all possible improvements to the codes have been implemented .",
