    "the nonlinear transport of electrons in two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron systems placed in a perpendicular magnetic field has been extensively studied in the past in connection with the breakdown of the quantum hall effect at high current densities.@xmath0 more recently , it was realized that the current causes substantial modifications of the resistance even in the region of weak magnetic fields and relatively high temperatures , when the landau levels are thermally mixed so the shubnikov - de haas oscillations ( sdho ) are suppressed .",
    "the present interest to the static ( dc ) nonlinear transport in 2d systems is stimulated by observation of two important phenomena .",
    "first , in high - mobility systems there appears a special kind of magnetotransport oscillations , when the resistance oscillates as a function of either magnetic field or electric current.@xmath1 second , it is found that the current substantially decreases the resistance even at moderate applied voltages.@xmath2 the observed phenomena are of quantum origin , they are caused by the landau quantization of electron states and reflect the influence of the current on the quantum contribution to resistivity .",
    "the oscillating behavior is explained by modification of the electron spectrum in the presence of high hall field,@xmath3 while the decrease of the resistance is most possibly governed by modification of electron diffusion in the energy space , which leads to the oscillating non - equilibrium contribution to the distribution function of electrons.@xmath4 a theory describing both these phenomena in a unified way has been recently presented.@xmath5    in contrast to the hall field - induced resistance oscillations , the phenomenon of decreasing resistance has not been studied extensively in experiment .",
    "though the available data@xmath6 support the theory@xmath7 predicting nontrivial changes in the distribution function as a result of dc excitation under magnetic fields , they are not sufficient for definite interpretation of the observed phenomenon in terms of this theory . for better understanding of the physical mechanisms of nonlinear behavior , further investigations are necessary .    in this paper",
    ", we undertake the studies of nonlinear magnetotransport in double quantum wells ( dqws ) , which are representative for the systems with two closely separated occupied 2d subbands .",
    "in contrast to the quantum wells with a single occupied subband , the positive magnetoresistance,@xmath8 which originates from the landau quantization , is modulated in dqws by the magneto - intersubband ( mis ) oscillations.@xmath9 these oscillations , whose maxima correspond to integer ratios of the subband splitting energy @xmath10 to the cyclotron energy @xmath11 , are caused by periodic variation of the probability of elastic intersubband scattering of electrons by the magnetic field as the density of electron states becomes an oscillating function of energy . as a result , the changes in the quantum contribution to the conductivity are directly seen from the corresponding changes of the mis oscillation amplitudes . in particular , we observe a remarkable manifestation of nonlinearity in dqws , the inversion of the mis oscillation picture , which appears when the quantum magnetoresistance changes from positive to negative as a result of increased current ( fig .",

    "in the low - field region , where the mis peaks are inverted , the calculation shows a considerable increase in their amplitudes above 0.2 t , where contribution of higher harmonics of the density of states becomes essential .",
    "this enhancement occurs because of the current - induced mixing between different harmonics of the distribution function , formally coming from the term with @xmath153 in the sum in eq .",

    "it is not surprising , because higher harmonics of the density of states contain the factors @xmath156 describing higher harmonics of the mis oscillations . above the inversion field ,",
    "the resistance is considerably smaller than the resistance predicted by the single - harmonic approximation , and a splitting of the mis peaks occurs .",

    "indeed , in the single - harmonic approximation the collision integral contains only the outcoming term proportional to @xmath98 .",
    "this approximation becomes insufficient in higher magnetic fields , when incoming terms in the collision integral ( 12 ) are also important , so the relaxation of the distribution function , which counteracts the diffusion of electrons in the energy space , becomes less efficient .",
    "this means that the effect of the current on the distribution function increases , and the resistance is lowered .",
    "the described suppression of the collision - integral term is more significant in the regions of the mis resonances , when @xmath157 is integer , because the peaks of the density of states are the narrowest in these conditions , and the energies transferred in the electron - electron collisions , @xmath101 , are small .",
    "away from the mis resonances , the energy space for electron - electron scattering increases , especially when the intersubband transitions are allowed ( see curve 2 in fig .",
    "therefore , the relaxation is less suppressed as compared to the center of the mis peak , and the effect of the current is weaker .",
    "the above consideration explains why the centers of the mis peaks drop down , so the peak splitting takes place .",
    "the scba has a limited applicability for description of the density of electron states in the magnetic field .",

    "this is understandable from the discussion given above : if different subbands contribute into the density of states independently , the efficiency of electron - electron collisions does not depend on the ratio @xmath157 and the reduction of the collision integral owing to incoming terms causes just a uniform suppression of the whole mis peak . in the scba ,",

    "in particular , we are able to determine the magnetic fields @xmath28 corresponding to the current - induced inversion of the magnetoresistance .",
    "this inversion manifests itself in a spectacular way , as a flip of the mis oscillation pattern .",
    "we point out that this behavior resembles recently observed@xmath166 inversion of the mis oscillations by the low - frequency ( 35 ghz ) microwave radiation .",
    "this is not surprising , because the physical mechanism in both cases is similar .",
    "apart from the flip of the mis oscillations , we have observed a wholly unexpected quantum phenomenon , the splitting of the mis oscillation peaks in the region of fields above the inversion point @xmath28 .",
    "we have shown that the theoretical explanation of all the observed phenomena can be based on the kinetic equation for the isotropic non - equilibrium part of electron distribution function .",
    "this function oscillates with energy owing to oscillations of the density of electron states in the magnetic field .",
    "the effect of electric current on this function , the increase of electron diffusion in the energy space , is equilibrated by the inelastic electron - electron scattering .",
    "theoretical explanation of the most of observed phenomena is done in a simple single - harmonic approach , which allowed us to determine the inelastic relaxation time @xmath109 by comparison of experimental data with theory .",
    "the values of @xmath109 for different samples are close to the theoretical estimates of this time , and confirm the predicted@xmath128 temperature dependence @xmath167 .",
    "thus , our data on the inelastic relaxation time in double quantum well samples are in agreement with the data obtained in single quantum well samples.@xmath6 the description of the splitting of mis oscillations requires a more detailed numerical analysis including consideration of higher harmonics of both the density of states and the distribution function .",
    "apart from the verification of the basic principles of the theory of ref . 7 , this analysis demonstrates sensitivity of the nonlinear behavior to the shape of the density of electron states and to the details in description of inelastic scattering .",
    "therefore , investigation of nonlinear magnetoresistance in relatively weak magnetic fields offers a tool for studying the electron states and scattering mechanisms both in single and double quantum wells . +",
