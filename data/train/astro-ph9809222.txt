    "sagittarius ( sgr )  a@xmath2 , the extremely compact non - thermal radio source at the galactic center , has been for many years considered the signpost of a massive black hole ( e.g. lynden - bell and rees 1971 ; lo 1985 ) .",
    "recent proper motion and radial velocity measurements of the stars in the immediate neighborhood of sgr  a@xmath2 have provided very compelling dynamical evidence for the existence of a compact dark mass of 2.5@xmath1 located within 0.015  pc ( 4.5@xmath9  cm ) of sgr  a@xmath2 , supporting the hypothesis that sgr  a@xmath2 is powered by a single massive black hole ( eckart and genzel 1996 ; eckart and genzel 1997 ; ghez 1998 ) . since sgr  a@xmath2 would be the nearest example by far of such a system , determining its intrinsic source structure would be very important for probing the region immediately surrounding the massive black hole .    up till now , very long baseline interferometric ( vlbi ) observations of sgr  a@xmath2 have not been able to probe its intrinsic structure , due to the scattering by the interstellar electrons ( e.g. davies et al , 1976 ; lo et al 1981 , 1985 , 1993 ; backer 1993 ; rogers 1994 ; krichbaum 1997 ; bower and backer 1998 ) . in this paper",
    ", we report our efforts to image sgr  a@xmath2 with the very long baseline array ( vlba ) nearly simultaneously at five wavelengths ( @xmath106.0 , 3.6 , 2.0 , 1.35  cm and 7  mm ) .",
    "the _ multi - wavelength _ imaging , with the same interferometer , is crucial for our differentiating interstellar scattering effects from the intrinsic source structure of sgr a*. finally , more than 20 years after its discovery ( balick and brown 1974 ) , we have for the first time determined that the intrinsic size of sgr  a@xmath2 is asymmetric , being 72  r@xmath3 by @xmath4 20  r@xmath11 , where r@xmath5  cm ) is the schwarzschild radius of a 2.5@xmath12  black hole . the new vlba result is consistent with the latest millimeter wavelength vlbi results at 3.5 and 1.4 mm , with 3 and 1 baseline respectively , which suggests that the intrinsic size of sgr a * may be 17@xmath139 r@xmath3 ( krichbaum , t. p. etal 1998 ) .",
    "the observations were carried out using eleven national radio astronomy observatory ( nrao ) 25-m radio telescopes : 10 vlba antennas and 1 vla antenna .",
    "the 7  mm observations were carried out on 14 february 1997 , while the 1.35  cm observations were interlaced with the 2.0  cm observations on 12 february 1997 , and the 3.6  cm interlaced with the 6.0  cm on 7 february 1997 , all at the same hour ranges of ut12h00 - 20h00 .",
    "quasars , nrao  530 and pks  1921 - 293 , served as amplitude calibrators and fringe detection sources .",
    "the data recording was in the standard vlba mode , with 32 mhz bandwidth for both circular polarizations at each telescope site .",
    "correlation of the data was done with the vlba correlator in socorro , new mexico .",
    "all the post - correlation reduction was carried out by using the nrao aips and the caltech vlbi package including difmap . with global fringe",
    "fitting , sgr  a@xmath2 was detected on the short and intermediate baselines depending on the observed wavelength , whereas both calibrators ( nrao  530 and pks  1921 - 293 ) were detected on all the baselines .",
    "the visibility amplitude calibrations were done using system temperature measurements at each site . at @xmath77  mm , special attention",
    "was paid to the elevation dependent opacity corrections , while at @xmath7@xmath141.35  cm the atmospheric opacity was not significant .",
    "images of sgr  a@xmath2 were produced for all five wavelengths using standard hybrid mapping .",
    "an elliptical gaussian model was fitted by the least - squares method to both amplitudes and phases in the calibrated visibility data to yield a quantitative description of the source structure .",
    "1 illustrates the model fitting to the 7 mm data , showing both the amplitude as a function of visibilities and the closure phase triangles .",
    "we emphasize by this figure the good quality of the data , the availability of many baseline where the structure can be fitted , and the robustness of the fit .",
    "the steadily improved performance of the vlba played a pivotal role in the quality of this data set .",
    "the total flux density ( s@xmath15 ) , fwhm major axis diameter ( @xmath16 ) , fwhm minor axis diameter ( @xmath17 ) , its axial ratio of minor to major axis diameters , and the position angle ( p.a . ) of the major axis of the model fit are given in table  1 , in which we also include previous 7 mm results from 1994.74 for comparison ( bower and backer 1998 ) .",
    "at wavelengths @xmath141.35  cm , the mean p.a . of the major axis",
    "is @xmath18 ( essentially e - w ) and the mean axial ratio is 0.53 @xmath13 0.07 . at 7  mm ,",
    "the axial ratio , 0.83@xmath130.11 , is significantly different from that at the longer wavelengths , while the p.a .",
    "our near - simultaneous multi - wavelength vlba mapping of sgr  a@xmath8 allows us to plot _ both _ the measured major and minor axis diameters versus the observing wavelength in fig .  2 .",
    "the measured major axis diameters ( open circles ) can be fit by @xmath19  marc s ( @xmath7 in cm ) , represented by the solid line . within the accuracy of the experiment , such an index is indistinguishable from 2 , so that the major axis diameters appear to follow a @xmath20 law over a range of @xmath7 from 7  mm to 6  cm , in excellent agreement with the previous result of 1.42  @xmath21 ( e.g. alberdi 1993 ) .",
    "this @xmath22-dependence is consistent with the measured size being dominated by the scattering angle that is a result of the radiation from sgr  a@xmath8 propagating through the interstellar medium with fluctuations in the electron density .",
    "the power spectrum of the density fluctuation of interstellar electrons is normally assumed to be @xmath23 , where k is the wavenumber of the irregularities .",
    "the scattering angle scales as @xmath24 , where @xmath25 2 , 2.2 for @xmath26 respectively ( romani , narayan , and blandford 1986 ) .    along the minor axis ,",
    "a fit to the measurements at all five wavelengths yields @xmath27  marc s which appears inconsistent with interstellar scattering .",
    "a fit to all points for @xmath281.35  cm , however , yields a dependence of ( 0.87@xmath130.23 )  @xmath29  marc s , which is consistent , within the errors , with the @xmath22-dependence expected for interstellar scattering . if we assume @xmath22-dependence derived for the major axis also applies to the minor axis , @xmath30 for @xmath28  1.35  cm ( cf fig .  1 ) .",
    "this dependence also agrees very well with @xmath31 and a constant axial ratio of 0.53 .",
    "_ this is the first time the @xmath7-dependence of the minor axis diameters is determined directly by observations _ , the results of which strongly suggest interstellar scattering dominates the observed minor axis image size at @xmath321.35  cm .",
    "the elongation of the scatter - broadened image can be caused by an anisotropic scattering medium in the vicinity of the galactic center .",
    "the anisotropy in the electron fluctuations in the interstellar medium has been postulated to be due to turbulence in a magnetized plasma , and the mechanism to generate the density fluctuation has been proposed to be due to the specific entropy being mixed by shear alfvenic turbulence that has `` eddies '' elongated in the direction of the magnetic field on small spatial scales ( higdon 1984 ; goldreich and sridhar 1995 ) .",
    "importantly , fig .",
    "2 shows a significant deviation at 7  mm between the measured minor axis diameter , @xmath33 , and the scattering angle , @xmath34 , extrapolated from 0.76  @xmath21 : @xmath35  marc s @xmath36  marc s @xmath37  marc s. the deviation of @xmath38 from the @xmath22 dependence is naturally expected when the intrinsic source diameter , @xmath39 , becomes comparable to the scattering angle , since @xmath40 ( narayan and hubbard 1988 ) .",
    "_ thus , this implies that at 7 mm , @xmath39 = ( 0.45  @xmath13  0.11 )  marc s for sgr  a@xmath8 along the minor axis ( p.a .",
    "= @xmath41 ; nearly n - s ) direction .",
    "_ if we use the measurements of bower and backer ( 1998 ) , @xmath42  marc s , @xmath43  marc s  and @xmath44  marc s. combining the two sets of measurements , we obtain @xmath45  marc s , @xmath46  marc s and @xmath47  marc  s. we note that this intrinsic size scale is larger than the value inferred at 1.4 mm by krichbaum etal ( 1998 ) .",
    "in addition to a possible @xmath7 dependence on the intrinsic size , we note that the 1.4 mm measurements were based on a single baseline .    the reasons that we can discern the intrinsic source size at @xmath7 7  mm , contrary to previous expectations that intrinsic source size is observable only at @xmath6  1  mm ,",
    "are ( 1 ) the scattering size along the minor axis is half that along the major axis , and ( 2 ) the near simultaneous multi - wavelength mapping of sgr  a@xmath8 , with the same instrument , over the same hour angle , and calibrated in a uniform manner , makes it possible to extrapolate precisely the minor axis scattering angle at @xmath7 7  mm .    conceivably , changes in the refractive properties of the interstellar medium could lead to the deviation indicated above , since the 7  mm refractive scattering time scale for sgr  a@xmath8 ( proportional to @xmath22 ) could be short : t@xmath48 year , where d , and v are the distance to the scattering medium , the relative velocity of the scattering medium and the observer , respectively . however , since the 7  mm source parameters did not change over 2.4 years and probably over a longer period , the deviation of the minor axis size from 0.76  @xmath21 is unlikely to be due to changing refractive scattering effects at 7  mm .",
    "furthermore , other evidence suggests that the refractive scattering effects for the galactic center must be very small ( romani , narayan , and blandford 1986 ) .    along the major axis ( p.a . of 80@xmath49",
    "; essentially e - w ) direction , the measured diameter of @xmath50 marc s and the extrapolated scattering size of @xmath51  marc s imply that the intrinsic size along the same direction has to be @xmath52 marc s. combined with the minor axis intrinsic diameter of 0.44 @xmath13 0.09 marc s derived above , this implies that _ the intrinsic source structure of sgr  a@xmath8 could be elongated along an essentially n - s direction , with an axial ratio of @xmath53 .",
    "_ this also implies an intrinsic brightness temperature of @xmath54 k.    up till now , there exist only limits to the intrinsic size of sgr  a@xmath8 . given that the intrinsic source size of sgr  a@xmath8 can now be estimated at 7 mm",
    ", we can also ask whether there are constraints on the wavelength dependence of the intrinsic source size . at @xmath73.5  mm , the upper limit to the observed size",
    "is 0.2  marc s , from which we can infer an upper limit to the intrinsic size along the minor axis of @xmath55  marc s ( rogers 1994 ) . at @xmath71.4  mm , the marginal detection with an interferometer with a fringe spacing of @xmath560.3  marc",
    "s suggests a size scale of 0.05 - 0.15  marc s ( krichbaum 1997 ; 1998 ) . from the absence of refractive scintillation due to focusing and defocusing of the scattered image by large scale plasma fluctuations",
    "( gwinn 1991 ) at @xmath71.3  mm and 0.8  mm , the respective lower limits to the intrinsic size are 0.02  marc s and 0.008  marc s. taken all together , a @xmath57-dependence of @xmath39 , with @xmath58 is not inconsistent with the above limits , at least along the minor axis direction .",
    "clearly , this very preliminary determination of the wavelength dependence of the intrinsic source size has to be improved with further observations .",
    "there have been several models for the structure and mechanism of radio emission from sgr  a@xmath8 .",
    "they typically involve synchrotron emission : from a pulsar wind that is confined by ram pressure ( reynolds and mckee 1980 ) , from thermal electrons heated by the dissipation of magnetic energy as the mass - loss in the winds from stars in the vicinity of sgr  a@xmath8 such as irs16 is spherically accreted by a massive black hole ( melia , jokipii , and narayanan 1992 ; melia 1994 ) , from a jet in a coupled jet - disk system ( falcke , mannheim , and biermann 1993 ) , or from the thermal electrons at an electron temperature of @xmath59 k of a two - temperature plasma in a rotating advection - dominated accretion flow ( narayan 1998 ) .",
    "until now , in the absence of the intrinsic source structure , for confirmation the various models rely on comparison to the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of sgr  a@xmath8 from the radio wavelength to the @xmath60-ray ( melia 1994 ; narayan 1998 ; duschl and lesch 1994 ; serabyn 1997 ; falcke 1998 ) .",
    "however , because of the insufficient angular resolution in the wavelength bands shortward of @xmath71  mm , it is uncertain that all the radiation in the sed actually originates from sgr  a@xmath8 , making the comparison less than definitive . in contrast , the intrinsic source structure derived here provides direct spatial constraints on the various models .",
    "specifically , the spherical accretion model ( melia 1994 ) predicts a @xmath7  7  mm size too large to be consistent with the results here , while the coupled disk - jet model ( falcke , mannheim and biermann 1993 ) predicts a jet size scale smaller than the 72@xmath61 obtained here .",
    "the advection dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) model for sgr  a@xmath8 can naturally account for the luminosity far below that implied by the estimated accretion rate ( narayan 1998 ) .",
    "however , if the @xmath7  7 mm radiation from sgr  a@xmath8 originates as thermal synchrotron radiation from the inner part of the advection dominated accretion disk , the current model has difficulty explaining the elongated shape with an axial ratio @xmath53 and the brightness temperature of @xmath54 k. an additional component , a radio jet , may be needed in the adaf model to account for the intrinsic elongation of sgr  a@xmath8 .",
    "obviously , observations of the intrinsic source structure at @xmath62  7  mm will probe ever closer to the event horizon of the massive black hole and will provide further constraints and stimuli for the models of sgr  a@xmath8 .",
    "given the proximity of the center of our galaxy , understanding the radio emission from sgr  a@xmath8 provides a unique opportunity for probing the physical conditions to within @xmath63 of a 2.5@xmath64 black hole .",
