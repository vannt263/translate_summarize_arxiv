    "nova monocerotis 2012 is the third gev nova discovered , with the distinction of being detected in @xmath0-rays before being discovered at optical wavelengths .",
    "the two others detected by the -lat ( atwood  2009 ) are the symbiotic - like nova  ( abdo  2010 ; shore  2011 ) and nova sco 2012 ( cheung  2012a ; wagner  2012 ) . for the @xmath0-rays",
    "are believed to be formed either by proton - proton collisions following fermi - acceleration in shocks formed when the high velocity nova ejecta impact the dense wind from the red giant ( rg ) companion , or from inverse - compton emission resulting from the shock - accelerated electrons   interacting with photospheric photons from the rg ( abdo et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "novae are due to run - away nuclear burning on a white dwarf ( wd ) ; material is slowly accreted from a binary companion until a critical pressure is reached at the base of the accreted envelope .",
    "they occur in binaries with orbital periods of 85  min to several decades ( e.g. munari , margoni & stagni 1990 ; bianchini  2003 ) , the rare examples at wider separations containing an rg with a strong wind , which may under - fill its roche lobe .",
    "cheung  ( 2012b ) first announced the discovery of a new @xmath0-ray source by the -lat in the galactic plane on 2012 june 22 . at the time , this area of the sky was too close to the sun for ground - based observations .",
    "however , on 2012 august 9 , a new optical nova , , was reported ( fujikawa 2012 ) , which cheung  ( 2012c ) associated with the source .",
    "was also detected in the radio before the optical discovery ; the radio flux increased in early 2012 september ( chomiuk et al .",
    "obrien  ( 2012 ) resolved the emission as a double radio source .",
    "high spectral resolution x - ray grating observations were taken by in september and december @xcite , 82 and 164 days after discovery .",
    "the first observation showed super - solar abundance , optically - thin emission from out - flowing plasma with kt  @xmath3  9  kev , while the second revealed that this plasma had cooled and that an additional hot wd component had emerged .",
    "munari ( 2013 ) confirmed as a neon nova on the basis of strong forbidden ne iii - v emission lines , thus implying a high mass wd .",
    "a 7.1  hr period was first identified in the ( gehrels  2004 ) data ( uv and x - ray ; osborne , beardmore , & page 2013 ) , and subsequently confirmed in the optical ( wagner , woodward , & starrfield 2013 ) .",
    "the decline of the super - soft source ( sss ) was reported by page  ( 2013 ) . following on from , and adding to , these data , in this letter we outline the x - ray / uv / optical / nir evolution of the nova and show that the near - main sequence secondary implied by an orbital period of 7.1  hr is not inconsistent with a recent model of @xmath0-ray emission in novae .    throughout this letter , day zero has been taken as the time of discovery : midnight on 2012 june 22 ( jd 2456100.5 ) .",
    "all magnitudes reported are on the vega system .",
    "after the optical announcement of , weekly observations commenced on 2012 august 19 .",
    "a hard x - ray source was found , fitted by a single - temperature , optically - thin thermal plasma ( nelson  2012a ) .    shortly after the emergence of the super - soft x - ray emission ( 2012 november 18 ; nelson  2012b ) , the cadence of observations was increased , with @xmath3  13  ks of data being collected most days .",
    "additionally , on 2013 january 16 a high - cadence campaign started , with snapshots ( individual spacecraft pointings ) of data taken during each orbit for the entire day to confirm an apparent @xmath3  7  hr period in the sss . on 2013 january 31 and february 1 , ten snapshots were obtained simultaneously with ground - based @xmath2-band data .",
    "differential time - series photometry was obtained in the @xmath2-band ( 7251025 nm fwhm ) on 2013 january 813 , 3031 , and february 1 ut ( days 200206 , 222223 and 224 ) with the 1.3-m mcgraw  hill telescope of the mdm observatory on kitt peak using the mdm4k ccd imager ( 1 pixel  =  0315 ) windowed to a field  of  view of 54 @xmath4 54 .",
    "5801 individual measurements , each with an exposure time of 15  s , were obtained at a time resolution of 30  s with respect to two anonymous comparison stars of comparable brightness to the nova .",
    "the primary comparison star is labeled # 117 on the aavso finding chart for the nova .",
    "the image quality was typically 12 fwhm , but occasionally reached 29 fwhm .",
    "bias frames and flat  field images of an illuminated screen in the dome were obtained to facilitate the data reduction . in addition , @xmath5 photometry was obtained in photometric conditions of the landolt ( 1992 ) photometric standard star sa98 563 , 62 from the nova , to calibrate the @xmath2-magnitudes of the two comparison stars used to place the nova magnitude on an absolute flux scale .",
    "@xmath1 and @xmath2-band photometry was obtained from the american association of variable star observers ( aavso ; see also hambsch , krajci , & banerjee 2013 ) .",
    "the majority of the aavso observers provided consistent measurements ; values from those which did not were excluded .",
    "these data , as well as our @xmath2-band photometry obtained after day 200 , are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fulllc ] .",
    "data were processed using heasoft 6.12 , following standard procedures . all x - ray telescope ( xrt ; burrows  2005 )",
    "data were collected in photon counting mode ; we used event grades 012 .",
    "when the source x - ray count - rate was @xmath6  0.6  count s@xmath7 , a circle of 1520  pixels ( 1  pixel  =  2.36 ) was used to extract the flux . otherwise an annulus was used to avoid pile - up in the inner region of the point spread function , excluding three to seven pixels radius , depending on brightness .",
    "uv / optical telescope ( uvot ; roming  2005 ) magnitudes were calculated using a 5  source region . for both instruments ,",
    "larger circular regions close to the source were used for background estimation .",
    "there was no detection of by the burst alert telescope ( 15350  kev ; barthelmy  2005 ) in 2012 june ( h.a .",
    "krimm , priv . comm . ) .",
    "-xrt data were extracted over 0.310  kev for the full band light - curve , with the hard and soft bands being defined as 0.30.8 and 0.810  kev .",
    "[ fulllc ] ( top ) shows the soft and hard x - ray light - curves , with a single bin per snapshot . before about day 140",
    ", the spectrum can be modelled by an absorbed , single - temperature , optically - thin component ( nelson  2012a ) .",
    "the absorbing column was initially high , declining by @xmath3  day 80 to around the interstellar value estimated by shore  ( 2013 ) . at later times , an additional , much softer emission component was required to model the emergence of the sss .",
    "this had negligible counts above 0.8  kev , hence the definition of the bands above .",
    "this soft component was variable by up to a factor of ten within a day .",
    "the -uvot initially collected data in the @xmath8 filter ( central wavelength 2246  ; fwhm 498  ) .",
    "once the super - soft emission emerged , most observations obtained data in all three uv filters : @xmath9 ( 1928  ; fwhm 657  ) , @xmath8 and @xmath10 ( 2600  ; fwhm 693 ) , see fig .  [ fulllc ] .      the images were reduced and analyzed using iraf 2.16 .",
    "each individual image of the nova was bias  subtracted and then corrected for pixel  to  pixel response variations using a single median flat - field image constructed from the set of flat - field images . the brightness of the nova ( v ) and the two comparison stars ( c and k ) was measured on each image using circular aperture photometry with annular background subtraction .",
    "the differential light - curves were constructed by differencing the observed instrumental magnitudes @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the photometric precision of the differential nova @xmath11 photometry was @xmath13 magnitude based on the @xmath12 measurements .",
    "finally , the nova photometry was placed on an absolute scale by the calibration of the primary comparison star c for which we measured @xmath2  =  11.18  @xmath14  0.04  mag based on the standard star observation .",
    "as demonstrated by the soft and hard x - ray light - curves in fig .  [ fulllc ] , there is clearly more than one emitting component after day 150 .",
    "the spectrum was modelled with a combination of a plane - parallel , static , non - local thermal equilibrium atmosphere component ( rauch 2003 ; rauch  2010 ) to parameterize the soft , wd emission , and a single - temperature optically - thin thermal plasma component at higher energies , both absorbed by a freely - varying column ( see fig .  [ spec ] ) .",
    "the bolometric luminosity estimated from these wd atmosphere fits , for a distance of 3.6  kpc ( shore  2013 ) , was around 0.11 times the eddington luminosity for a 1.2@xmath15 star .",
    "although a full spectral analysis is beyond the scope of this letter , no substantial spectral evolution in these two emission components , apart from the overall intensities , was seen .    at longer wavelengths ,",
    "the nova faded smoothly and at an increasing rate ; over extended intervals magnitudes are proportional to log(time ) , i.e. @xmath16 . the light - curves break at day  @xmath3  150 and more steeply at day  @xmath3  220 .",
    "the @xmath17 and @xmath2-bands decline similarly after day  150 , while the @xmath1-band decline is always markedly slower ; thus , @xmath18 gets redder , while @xmath19 gets bluer . between days 60150 , @xmath20  @xmath3  1.6 , 1.1 , 2.1 in the @xmath8 , @xmath1 and @xmath2-bands respectively .",
    "then until day 220 , the @xmath8 and @xmath2-bands showed @xmath20  @xmath3  2.8 , with @xmath21  @xmath3  1.5 .",
    "after this time , the decline indices doubled .",
    "we speculate that the slow decline in the @xmath1-band may be due to persistent line emission ( e.g. o and ne ; shore  2013 ) .",
    "a lomb - scargle periodogram of the data after day  150 showed evidence for a 7.1  hr period in both the uvot and xrt light - curves .",
    "the top panel of fig .",
    "[ foldlc ] shows the periodogram of the uvot @xmath8 data taken after the onset of super - soft emission ( days  150257 ) , following detrending by subtraction of the best - fit third - order polynomial .",
    "( the earlier data are too sparse to help constrain a period of a few hours . )",
    "a folding search technique was used to measure the period ( e.g. , leahy 1987 ; larsson 1996 ) , whereby @xmath22 is calculated as a function of trial period when the heliocentrically - corrected data are folded at each period ( into eight phase bins ) .",
    "fitting the resulting distribution of @xmath22 near its maximum gave a period of 0.29571  @xmath14  0.00010  day , where the error is at 90% confidence and was estimated by applying the same technique to monte carlo simulations of the data sampled at the same times as the observations , with appropriate gaussian noise added .",
    "the resulting utc ephemeris derived from the uvot @xmath8 data is @xmath23 where e is the cycle count and the numbers in parentheses indicate the 90% errors , with the uncertainty on the epoch determined by estimating the error in the centroid of a gaussian fit to the minimum seen in the phase - folded light - curve .",
    "consistent results were obtained from the other uvot filters and nir photometry .",
    "[ foldlc ] ( middle ) plots the high - cadence data obtained throughout 2013 january 16 , folded according to equation  1 . the modulation is clearly seen in the soft x - rays ( 0.30.8  kev ) and all three uv filters .",

    "the 90% upper limit on the modulation in the hard ( 0.810  kev ) x - ray data is 5% .",
    "fitting the xrt spectrum from january 16 with a combination of an atmosphere model and optically - thin thermal emission , we found that the optically thin component provides @xmath3  10% of the counts in this soft band . within this band",
    "there is no discernible spectral variation as a function of the 7.1  hr phase .",
    "[ simlc ] shows the data collected simultaneously by -xrt , -uvot and mdm .",
    "short - term variations are seen across all three bands .    the large amplitude variability of the super - soft x - ray emission ( fig .  [ fulllc ] )",
    "superficially appears random ; however , it can be decomposed into a slower intensity evolution and the observational sampling of the 7.1  hr periodic modulation .",
    "noting that the amplitude range , for much of the super - soft phase , is around a factor of ten , we constructed a count - rate model as a function of phase , of the form @xmath24 count s@xmath7 .",
    "the coefficients a and b were determined from an early section of the data ( a / b  =  1.71 ) .",
    "the normalization parameter , @xmath25 , was measured by fits to 3-day sequences of observations , a compromise between desired time resolution and sufficient phase coverage ( fig .",
    "[ mult ] ) .",
    "the point - to - point absolute variability in this plot averages @xmath340% , much less than the @xmath375% of fig .",
    "[ fulllc ] .",
    "much of the fast variation in fig .",
    "[ fulllc ] is due to the periodic modulation ; removing this reveals the more steadily rising and declining super - soft source .",
    "the large - amplitude variability seen in the early sss emission of rs  oph ( osborne  2011 ) is not present in this system .",
    "monitoring of the gev one revealed a slowly - evolving , hard x - ray - emitting , optically - thin plasma and a much more variable super - soft x - ray component , which was first seen on day 150 and which faded to 2% of its peak rate by day 250 .",
    "as shown by schwarz  ( 2011 ) , the late turn - on time of the sss suggests an explosion which was unusually energetic within that sample , with an ejecta mass consistent with that reported by shore  ( 2013 ) .",
    "the time of the start of the decline of the sss , around day 200 , is consistent with the h@xmath20 emission - line velocity of 2400 km  s@xmath7 fwhm ( shore et al .",
    "2013 ) , according to the relationship of greiner , orio , & schartel ( 2003 ) .",
    "the turn - off time suggests a two magnitude decline time from maximum of t@xmath26  @xmath6  10  day ( schwarz  2011 ) , placing in the very - fast class . the speed - class , together with the sss turn - off time ,",
    "are commensurate with the uv line - ratio - determined nuclear turn - off times measured by vanlandingham  ( 2001 ) for onemg novae .",
    "the wd temperature and t@xmath27 time are consistent with the correlation of orio ( 2012 ) , while the wd temperature requires a wd mass of @xmath3  1.25@xmath15 ( starrfield  2012 ) , consistent with its one composition . in summary , as an one nova , appears to be a typical member of its class .",
    "we now consider the implications of the main result of this letter .",
    "we found a coherent 7.1  hr periodic modulation in the soft x - ray , uv , optical and nir photometry of during the epoch when the sss is visible .",
    "this modulation is in phase over all wavebands , with the soft x - rays originating from the hot wd .",
    "the 7.1  hr period is almost certainly the orbital period of the system .",
    "we ascribe the modulation to the effects of an orbiting disk rim bulge viewed at moderately high inclination .",
    "novae occur in binary systems with a wide range of orbital periods , with most below one day ( warner 2008 ) . on - going accretion requires that the secondary star fills its roche lobe which , for orbital periods @xmath68  hr , dictates that it be close to the main sequence . in this case",
    "the secondary star mass is m@xmath27  @xmath28  0.8  @xmath15 , and it will have little appreciable wind .",
    "in contrast , symbiotic novae have orbital periods of order years , and giant secondaries with dense winds .",
    "the orbital period of makes it distinct from the gev nova which has an orbital period of 4050  yr ( munari  1990 ; ; shore  2011 ) , a mira rg secondary and , thus , a dense wind which acts as a target in the shock generation giving rise to the @xmath0-ray emission .",
    "shock acceleration of particles to tev energies can account for the lower shock velocity determined from x - ray temperature measurements than that measured by emission line widths in the ir , as was the case in the symbiotic nova rs  oph ( tatischeff & hernanz 2007 ) . energy loss from the shock is due to very high energy particles dominating the photon luminosity by a factor @xmath3  200 , thus motivating the @xmath0-ray emission model ( abdo  2010 ) .",
    "the inverse - compton and proton - proton gev @xmath0-ray mission models of were considered in more detail by martin & dubus ( 2013 ) , who showed that a better fit to the -lat data was achieved by a model in which a density enhancement around the wd gives rise to a dominant inverse - compton component , as opposed to the original rg wind model .",
    "density enhancement in the orbital plane is a natural consequence of the presence of the wd , which gives rise to an accretion disk with a high angular momentum outflow in the plane , and to an accretion wake in the case of a significant secondary wind .",
    "does not have such a wind , so we must look to the accretion disk and related structures for the material against which the ejecta shock .",
    "ejecta structure observed at high inclination is hinted at by the detection of a double radio source ( obrien  2012 ) .",
    "the presence of such structure is also consistent with the uv and optical emission line analysis of shore  ( 2013 ) , who show that the horned line profiles are consistent with inclinations around 5070@xmath29  =  82  @xmath14  6@xmath29 ] .",
    "highly non - spherical nova ejecta have been derived by walder , folini and shore ( 2008 ) and drake  ( 2009 ) for the symbiotic nova rs  oph , formed by an orbital plane density enhancement .",
    "the same mechanism may be at play in .",
    "we presume that the @xmath0-ray emission of is due to shock - accelerated electrons , generated by the nova ejecta impacting the accretion disk or related structure , and boosting the nova light as in the martin & dubus ( 2013 ) model for v407  cyg . in their favored model , the secondary star wind shock was not a significant source of @xmath0-rays .",
    "similarly , shore  ( 2013 ) conclude that internal shocks in the ejecta , rather than a wind shock , are the cause of the gev emission .",
    "the much smaller system dimensions of compared to  suggest a shorter gev emission episode ; however a more complete test of this hypothesis , also making use of the harder x - ray emission , is beyond the scope of this letter .",
    "our discovery of a 7.1  hr modulation shows that the accretion disk has reformed by day 150 , and that the binary system is seen at a moderately high inclination .",
    "x - ray modulation , such as seen here , occurs due to the passage though the line of sight of a raised sector of the accretion disk rim where the accretion stream from the secondary impacts the disk , possibly augmented by reflection around phase 0.5 .",
    "such a disk was seen to be reforming between day 2335 in the recurrent nova u  sco ( ness  2012a ) . treating the emitter as a point source , the lack of evident",
    "eclipses by the secondary star ( r  @xmath28  0.8@xmath31 ) restricts the system inclination to @xmath32  @xmath6  70@xmath29 .",
    "the fact that the modulation is in phase from the x - ray to the @xmath2-band suggests that the modulated emission in all these bands originates interior to the disk rim .",
    "residual nuclear burning on the wd , presumably also fed with fresh hydrogen - rich fuel by the accretion disk , is the cause of the observed super - soft x - rays , while the emission at longer wavelengths likely arises from the intensely illuminated disk itself ( suleimanov , meyer , & meyer - hofmeister 1999 ; 2003 ) .",
    "the broad shape of the x - ray modulation , with the dip covering around half the orbital cycle , implies an extended absorbing or emission region .",
    "an optically - thin electron - scattering cloud , potentially originating in gas stripped from the accretion disk surface , may be the cause of an extended emission region .",
    "beardmore  ( 2012 ) made a similar inference for the super - soft nova hv  cet which also exhibited in - phase x - ray , uv and optical orbital modulation .",

    "<S> is the third @xmath0-ray transient identified with a thermonuclear runaway on a white dwarf , that is , a nova event . </S>",
    "<S> monitoring has revealed the distinct evolution of the harder and super - soft x - ray spectral components , while -uv and @xmath1 and @xmath2-band photometry show a gradual decline with subtle changes of slope . during the super - soft emission phase , a coherent 7.1  hr modulation was found in the soft x - ray , uv , optical and near - ir data , varying in phase across all wavebands .  assuming this period to be orbital , the system has a near - main sequence secondary , with little appreciable stellar wind . </S>",
    "<S> this distinguishes it from the first gev nova , where the @xmath0-rays were proposed to form through shock - accelerated particles as the ejecta interacted with the red giant wind . </S>",
    "<S> we favor a model in which the @xmath0-rays arise from the shock of the ejecta with material close to the white dwarf in the orbital plane . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that classical novae may commonly be gev sources .   </S>",
    "<S> we ascribe the orbital modulation to a raised section of an accretion disk passing through the line of sight , periodically blocking and reflecting much of the emission . </S>",
    "<S> the disk must , therefore , have reformed by day 150 after outburst . </S>"
