    "most surfaces that are immersed in an aqueous solution obtain a net charge due to ion adsorption or dissociative processes at the surface . the resulting electrostatic force between such surfaces",
    "is essential for understanding the stability , osmotic pressure and flocculation behaviour of colloidal suspensions . in the standard ( linear ) screening picture , like - charged surfaces repel each other at distances of the order of the debye screening length,@xcite due to overlapping clouds of screening ions in the vicinity of the two surfaces .",
    "this electrostatic repulsion , combined with short - range attractive van der waals forces if there is a dielectric contrast between the colloidal particles and the solvent , is a basic result of derjaguin - landau - verwey - overbeek ( dlvo ) theory which dates back to the 1940s.@xcite more recent studies , based on nonlinear poisson - boltzmann theory , also find strictly repulsive electrostatic forces between pairs of like - charges surfaces.@xcite nevertheless , there are also experimental reports of attraction between like - charge colloids at ranges much longer than those of van der waals forces .",
    "ion - ion correlations , which are ignored in the mean - field type poisson - boltzmann theory , might be an explanation for these observed attractions in the case of multi - valent ions.@xcite however , evidence for electrostatic attractions has also been reported for suspensions with only monovalent ions,@xcite causing heated debates in the literature on the break - down of the classic dlvo theory due to many - body effects , the vicinity of glass walls , hydrodynamic forces , etc .",
    "interestingly , it has also been suggested that _",
    "charge inhomogeneities _ can be responsible for these attractions,@xcite where the heterogeneity of the surface charge may be due to an incidentally present or purposely designed underlying chemical structure , or by clustering of adsorbed surfactants .",
    "+ apart from the ill - understood electrostatic attractions in some systems , another good reason for considering heterogeneously charged surfaces in more detail stems from the fascinating recent advances in the chemical synthesis of a large class of novel patchy nanoparticles , featuring not only corners , edges , and facets due to their finite size , but also spots or stripes.@xcite understanding the large - scale self - assembly properties of these newly available nanoparticles is an important ongoing scientific quest that requires effective particle - particle interactions as an input . for this reason a better understanding is needed of the relations between the chemical heterogeneity of patchy particles , the resulting surface charge density , and the nature and geometry of the ionic screening cloud that ultimately dictates the effective electrostatic interactions . in this article",
    "we explore some of these relations within nonlinear poisson - boltzmann ( pb ) theory in the relatively simple geometry of chargeable stripes on a planar surface in contact with a bulk electrolyte .    in pb theory a key role is being played by the boundary conditions ( bc s ) , in particular those on the surface between the suspending electrolyte and the suspended colloidal nanoparticles .",
    "the most common bc is to predescribe the surface charge density of the colloidal particle , thereby imposing a fixed discontinuity of the displacement field at both sides of the surface while the surface potential itself increases upon the approach of another like - charged surface .",
    "this type of constant - charge bc was shown to be realistic for e.g. strongly acidic homogeneous surfaces that ionise completely in a polar solvent such as water.@xcite an alternative is to predescribe the electrostatic potential on the surface , such that the particles can adjust their charge density if another surface approaches .",
    "this constant - potential bc has turned out to be realistic for surfaces not too far from a point of zero charge.@xcite it is not clear , however , which of these bc s is realistic for surfaces with a heterogeneous chemical composition . for instance , it is not trivial how the charge of a highly charged patch on an otherwise weakly charged or neutral surface is distributed , and how the induced electrostatic potential propagates to affect the charging of nearby surface groups of other patches .",
    "the problem requires us to treat the interplay between the electrostatic potential and the surface charge density at the more microscopic level of a chemical equilibrium of attaching and detaching ions as modeled by charge - regulation bcs.@xcite such an approach has been applied to fit force measurements between two homogeneously charged plates,@xcite or to compute forces between periodically modulated charged plates within linearised pb theory.@xcite here , however , we combine charge regulation bc s with nonlinear pb theory for a single spatially heterogenous surface . using a newly developed numerical scheme we will reveal how surfaces with finite - sized discrete patches@xcite tend to charge up and get screened , where the full non - linear pb theory allows us to deal with highly charged patches next to oppositely charged or neutral areas with strongly varying ion concentrations perpendicular and parallel to the surface .",

    "deviations from a straight line are due to nonlinear couplings between the modes , and slopes far away from the surface are the mode - dependent screening parameters @xmath95 .",
    "it can be seen that , for this choice of @xmath1 , the nonzero modes also give rise to an electric field inside the solid medium , and for high @xmath126 the screening on both sides of the interface is equally efficient , as there are almost no ions involved .",
    "[ fig : contourplot](b ) shows a contour plot of the potential @xmath75 around the charged interface .",
    "it shows a local increase of the potential close to the stripe , which is caused by a local high charge density .",
    "the inhomogeneity in the potential persists for a few screening lengths into the liquid , as the stripe width is larger than the screening length , and thus ionic screening is the dominant type of screening there . in the solid medium ionic screening",
    "is not possible , and the inhomogeneity persists over a range of the order of the width of the stripe as was found below eq .",

    "[ fig : avcharge ] shows @xmath182 as a function of chargeability @xmath149 for multiple choices of the stripe geometry parameters @xmath141 and @xmath142 .",
    "all curves show , as expected , that the charge increases with the chargeability .",
    "it illustrates , however , that the charging of the stripes strongly depends on their width and the distance in between two successive stripes .",
    "charge densities are increased either by narrower stripes or by larger stripe - stripe distances , the strongest charging occurs for narrow stripes with relatively much space in between .",
    "this is intuitively clear since for stripes that are rather separated the charging of the edges is not hindered by the charge of neighboring stripes .",
    "moreover , narrow stripes have relatively more edge surface . for broad stripes",
    "this gain at the edges is small compared to the charge at the center , and we see from the line for @xmath167 and @xmath153 that the charge density indeed approaches the homogeneous limit ( @xmath183 ) , given in eqs .",
    "( [ phihom2])-([yhom ] ) and limiting behaviour  ( [ limitingcases ] ) .",
    "by contrast , the narrower stripe of width @xmath184 and the same periodicity @xmath170 has , for @xmath161 , a charge density that is a factor @xmath185 higher than the homogeneous limit , while the relative increase of @xmath182 compared to @xmath186 can be a factor @xmath187 for extremely narrow patches with @xmath188 and @xmath189 , as can be seen in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : avcharge ] .",
    "furthermore , we note that @xmath190 in the low - charge limit @xmath191 .",
    "this is not surprising either , as in this limit any charge , regardless its position on the surface , is essentially `` alone '' in a vanishingly small potential ; the vicinity of a neutral area `` 2 '' or an essentially neutral stripe `` 1 '' is indistinguishable in that case . +      as a way to better understand and quantify the charging mechanism of the patches , we now propose a method to estimate the stripe charge densities by an analytic procedure and check if the right physics emerges .",
    "the key element in the method is the fact that the charging of different surface groups is correlated .",
    "this correlation is mediated by the electrostatic potential and logically the ( longest ) correlation length is of the order of the screening length , as long as we use the assumption that @xmath192 .",
    "this correlation implies that a small area of charge - neutral plate around every stripe is involved in the charging as well . for the geometry of current interest",
    "this means we can think of an extra strip of width @xmath193 on each side of the charged patch of width @xmath141 , as illustrated in fig .  [ fig : method2 ] . now we presume that the stripe including the extra area charges up like a homogeneously charged plate , such that we can apply the analytic expressions ( [ phihom2])-([yhom ] ) from planar pb theory with an effective ( decreased ) chargeability @xmath194 for the enlarged stripe . +    the strip width @xmath193 depends on the local screening length , and therefore we set @xmath195 , with @xmath196 a fit parameter and @xmath197 the effective screening length defined below .",
    "the minimum condition is used to prevent overlaps , as the size of the additional strip area can not exceed the size of the uncharged region in between the charged stripes .",
    "the effective screening parameter @xmath198 is determined by the average electrostatic potential around the edge .",
    "the relation stems from pb - linearization procedures and is given for example in ref . @xcite .",
    "since the local surface potential at the strip must be somewhere in between zero and the value for a homogeneously charged plate with chargeability @xmath149 , we estimate the effective screening length to be their average , such that @xmath199 .",
    "the procedure is now to use this effective screening length in the calculation of the estimated strip width @xmath193 to obtain the effective chargeability @xmath200 . in the homogeneous limit",
    "this gives a charge density @xmath201 for the stripes plus the side strips via eqs .",
    "( [ yhom ] ) and ( [ phihom]).the average charge density @xmath182 on the original stripe follows by assigning the charge density to a smaller surface , @xmath202 . +    for the fit parameter @xmath203 , fig .",
    "[ fig : avestimate ] shows the resulting @xmath182 as a function of @xmath149 for several @xmath96 and @xmath204 , together with the numerically determined `` exact '' results based on eq .",
    "( [ yintegral ] ) .",
    "the agreement between the two is good , within a maximal error of @xmath205% , and we find the right trend with @xmath149 which suggests that this approximation holds for even higher stripe chargeabilities as well .",
    "it is expected that the fits will remain good or even become better for larger stripe distances or stripe widths than investigated here , since for broader stripes the relative amount of edge surface decreases .",
    "moreover , the choice of parameters @xmath153 in combination with @xmath206 describes a system in which the stripes are separated by multiple screening lengths , which is close to the @xmath207 limit where the patches do not mutually interact anymore .",
    "although the importance of charge inhomogeneities on the interactions between surfaces was already mentioned in many other studies , the relation between chemical inhomogeneity on the surface and the resulting inhomogeneity in surface charge was , to our knowledge , never studied in detail .",
    "we developed a numerical method , based on expansion into fourier modes , to find the electrostatic potential and charge distributions close to an interface with an inhomogeneous distribution of chargeable chemical surface groups .",
    "we focussed on the case where the chemical groups are clustered in stripe - like regions , with different chargeabilities , either of the same or different sign .",
    "for the case of striped chargeable patches on an otherwise neutral surface we showed a significant increase of charging of surface groups as the width of the stripes decreases below the debye length .",
    "for very small patches this increase of the surface charge density can easily be an order of magnitude , although patches that have little spacing show significantly less increase of charging because neighboring patches hinder each other s charging . from the numerical results we arrive at the observation that the edges of the patches are able to charge up optimally and will contribute significantly to the total charge of small patches .",
    "our calculated numerical results for the average charge density on a patch are in fine agreement with a very basic analytical model ( and one fit parameter ) which employs an effective patch size in combination with results for homogeneous plates .",
    "our results are stepping stone towards the study of interactions between heterogeneously charged surfaces , where charged patches may induce charges onto nearby ( otherwise ) neutral surfaces , thereby generating nontrivial forces and torques .",
    "this could be relevant for understanding self - assembly of patchy nanoparticles or proteins .",
