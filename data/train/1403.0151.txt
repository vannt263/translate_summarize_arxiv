    "ferroelectric materials are of great scientific and technological importance , especially for use in electronic devices such as non - volatile memory @xcite , tunable capacitors @xcite , and tunnel junctions.@xcite the fact that there are so few mechanisms capable of generating spontaneous polarizations with high curie temperatures in crystalline systems , however , suggests that there are limited opportunities to improve upon existing devices . understanding how ferroelectricity arises , as well as how to control and purposefully induce it in novel ways , is therefore critical to engineering new technologies based on ferroic transitions .",
    "the family of @xmath6o@xmath7 perovskite oxides is ideal for investigations of this nature , as the crystal family can accommodate a wide range of chemistries and exhibits strong electron - lattice coupling , which allow for highly tunable ground states through atomic substitution and strain.@xcite typically , ferroelectricity in transition metal perovskite oxides is realized by having a @xmath8 @xmath4-site cation or lone - pair active @xmath0-site cation , @xcite which undergo collective polar displacements through the so - called second order jahn - teller effect @xcite .",
    "an alternative strategy receiving considerable interest lately relies on an improper `` geometric route , '' whereby a ferroelectric polarization is produced as a by - product of some complex lattice distortion(s ) , as opposed to being directly driven by inversion lifting displacements originating in the chemistries of the cations.@xcite electric polarizations can arise in this manner through , _",
    "e.g. _ , rotations of corner - connected @xmath4o@xmath3 octahedra that are coupled to and induce polar displacements of the @xmath0 and @xmath4 cations in perovskites .",
    "if the compound is ordered as ( @xmath0,@xmath1)@xmath2o@xmath3 , then two chemically distinct @xmath0-sites will displace by different amounts due to a size differential , which leads to an observed electric dipole.@xcite previous efforts have defined the octahedral rotational patterns which , when combined with alternating @xmath0 and @xmath9 atoms along the [ 001 ] crystallographic axis , lift the symmetries preventing spontaneous polarizations . in the case of these ` layered ' superlattices , only a combination of in - phase ( + ) and out - of - phase (  ) @xmath4o@xmath3 octahedral rotations ( @xmath10 in glazer notation ) satisfies the required criteria put forth .",
    "@xcite energetically , this occurs because the modes describing the in - phase and out - of - phase rotations ( identified by the irreducible representations @xmath11 and @xmath12 of @xmath13 , respectively ) couple to a polar mode,@xcite resulting in an anharmonic term in the free energy expansion that ultimately stabilizes the polar structure .",
    "materials with spontaneous polarizations resulting from this coupling of two zone - boundary modes are known as  hybrid improper \" ferroelectrics.@xcite the fact that [ 001]-ordering is conducive to layer - by - layer growth of double perovskites through pulsed laser deposition or molecular beam epitaxy,@xcite and that the required @xmath10 tilt pattern is one of the most commonly adopted by perovskite oxides , make these compounds attractive for investigation .",
    "however , the fact that the polarization arises from a trilinear coupling leads to an often overlooked problem : mode condensation .",
    "there is the real possibility that the two rotational modes condense at different temperatures , leading to a _ staggered _ paraelectric to ferroelectric phase transition .",
    "although an avalanche transition ( in which the modes condense at the same temperature ) is possible in ferroelectric oxides @xcite , non - avalanche transitions are also likely to occur .",
    "@xcite this makes it difficult to predict whether or not there will be two phase transitions from the paraelectric to ferroelectric state , _",
    "i.e. _ , a cell - doubling antidistortive transition , owing to the rotations , followed by an inversion lifting one , in the material without detailed and careful experimental study .",
    "however , it is possible to avoid this problem if the spontaneous polarization is induced by only a single rotational mode , making such materials improper rather than hybrid - improper ferroelectrics .",
    "materials of this nature could find use in high - temperature electronic applications such as sensors.@xcite our previous work has shown that although both in - phase and out - of - phase rotations are required to lift inversion symmetry in [ 001]-ordered double perovskites , only out - of - phase rotations , which are described by a single mode , are needed if the @xmath0-sites are ordered along the [ 111 ] direction ( the difference in cation ordering is shown in ) .",
    "@xcite in this work , we examine the feasibility of this symmetry result using density functional theory calculations , and subsequently design a series of [ 111]-ordered @xmath14o@xmath3 double perovskites exhibiting only out - of - phase rotations with modest electronic polarizations .",
    "we also investigate their piezoelectric response and estimate the phase transition temperatures based on first - principles total energy differences .",
    "we find that while two compounds , ( la , pr)al@xmath5o@xmath3 and ( ce , pr)al@xmath5o@xmath3 , exhibit spontaneous polarizations in their polar ground state , they undergo a transition to a chiral phase at low temperatures accompanied by a disappearance of the polarization ; albeit , they then exhibit an order of magnitude increase in the piezoelectric response .",
    "these materials then transform to a centrosymmetric phase at 1300 k. while the third compound , ( la , nd)al@xmath5o@xmath3 , does not have a polar ground state , we predict it remains non - centrosymmetric to even higher temperatures .    , @xmath9)@xmath2o@xmath3 superlattice ordered along the ( a ) [ 001]-direction ( ` layered ' ) and ( b ) [ 111]-direction ( ` rock salt ' ) . @xmath0 and @xmath1 atoms are in green and orange , respectively , while @xmath4o@xmath3 octahedra are given in blue . ]",
    "all investigations were performed using density functional theory@xcite as implemented in the vienna _ ab - initio _ simulation package ( ` vasp`).@xcite we used projector augmented - wave ( paw ) potentials@xcite with the pbesol functional@xcite , with the @xmath15 valence electron configuration for la , @xmath16 for nd , @xmath17 for pr , @xmath15 for ce , @xmath18 for al , and @xmath19 for o. a plane - wave cutoff of 550 ev and a 6@xmath206@xmath206 monkhorst - pack mesh@xcite were used during the structural relaxations .",
    "the phonon band structure of each compound was computed using density functional perturbation theory@xcite with an increased plane - wave cutoff of 800 ev .",
    "the ground states were determined by performing a full structural relaxation on 15 candidate structures , which were generated using linear combinations of unstable phonons of each compound .",
    "the electric polarization was calculated using the berry phase method@xcite as implemented in ` vasp ` . finally , the piezoelectric and elastic tensors were computed within density functional perturbation theory.@xcite we note that dft calculations on ce - based compound often treat the @xmath21 electron explicitly , while also including a hubbard-@xmath22 correction of 6 - 10ev on those states . here",
    "we use a ce paw which does not include the @xmath21 states , instead placing these electrons in the core to eliminate any adjustable @xmath22 parameters in our calculations .",
    "we evaluated this approximation by performing a structural relaxation of bulk cealo@xmath7 , treating the @xmath23-electron both in the core and as valence electrons with @xmath24 - 10ev in increments of 1ev .",
    "the relaxed lattice parameters and rotation angles of cealo@xmath7 with the @xmath23-electrons in the core and treated explicitly as valence electrons with @xmath25 both agree with the experimental data to within 1% , showing that there is essentially no error if the @xmath23-electrons are not included .",
    "owing to the structural agreement , all presented results use the former paw .",
    "we first determined the ground state structures of four non - polar aluminate dielectrics which contain only out - of - phase alo@xmath3 octahedral rotations : laalo@xmath7 , ndalo@xmath7 , pralo@xmath7 , and cealo@xmath7 .",

    "additionally , it appears that pralo@xmath7 ( @xmath28 ) influences the tilt pattern of the ordered superlattice more so than the other bulk rare earth aluminates ; it turns off a rotation about one cartesian axis in laalo@xmath7 ( @xmath26 ) , stabilizing the @xmath28 rotation pattern . whereas it turns on a rotation when ordered with cealo@xmath7 ( @xmath32 ) to also give the @xmath28 rotation pattern .",

    "our estimate of the critical transition temperatures for each shows that these aluminates would only retain this spontaneous polarization to 93 k and 34 k , at which point they transition from a polar to chiral structure .",
    "however , all three compounds retain non - centrosymmetric structures up to high temperatures ( > 1300 k , see ) . to investigate their viability for use in high - temperature applications ,",
    "we compute the dielectric and piezoelectric tensors , as well as the born effective charges , for the non - centrosymmetric phases of each ordered compound ( ) . the total dielectric constant @xmath93 consists of electronic ( frozen - ion ) and ionic ( relaxed - ion ) contributions .",
    "we first find that the electronic dielectric tensor is approximately isotropic , as well as nearly equivalent across all chemical compositions ( a well - known phenomenon in perovskite oxides@xcite ) and structural phases .",
    "the ionic contributions are much larger ; we also find that on average they increase when transitioning from the polar @xmath39 to chiral @xmath41 structure .",
    "the total dielectric constant of each aluminate also falls well within the known range for perovskite oxides ; ( la , nd)al@xmath5o@xmath3 in particular displays a dielectric constant near the top of this range.@xcite the relaxed - ion piezoelectric stress ( @xmath133 ) and strain ( @xmath134 ) coefficients are related through the compliance tensor @xmath135 ( the inverse of the elastic tensor ) by @xmath136 .",
    "note that due to symmetry , the @xmath41 piezoelectric tensors have 5 components , but only 2 of which are independent ; the @xmath39 phase has 5 independent coefficients .",
    "first , the chiral @xmath41 phases of ( la , nd)al@xmath5o@xmath3 and ( la , pr)al@xmath5o@xmath3 exhibit relatively large piezoelectric coefficients , comparable to those of common lead - free piezoelectric materials such as batio@xmath7 and linbo@xmath7.@xcite interestingly , the _ polar _ @xmath39 phase of ( la , pr)al@xmath5o@xmath3 has piezoelectric coefficients that are an order of magnitude smaller .",
    "because the chiral phases have no net dipole due to the @xmath0-sites sitting on high symmetry positions , an applied stress will generate a much larger induced polarization than in the polar phases ( which already have a spontaneous polarization ) .",
    "additionally , the piezoelectric response of ( ce , pr)al@xmath5o@xmath3 is much smaller than either of the la - based aluminates ; it does , however , also show the same increase in response across the @xmath39-to-@xmath41 structural phase boundary ( ) .",
    "thus , while the polarization goes to zero across the @xmath39-to-@xmath41 transition in ( la , pr)al@xmath5o@xmath3 and ( ce , pr)al@xmath5o@xmath3 , there is a large increase in the piezoelectric response in the chiral structures .",
    "finally , the born effective charges were computed for the five phases . typically , proper @xmath6o@xmath7 ferroelectrics exhibit anomalously large born effective charges ; for example , the nominal charge for ba , ti , and o in batio@xmath7 are @xmath137 , @xmath138 , and @xmath106 , respectively , while @xmath139 , @xmath140 , and @xmath141.@xcite in these ordered aluminates , however , the born effective charges are close to their nominal values , with only the @xmath0-site cations displaying any significant deviation .",
    "this clearly highlights the difference in mechanism between proper ferroelectrics such as batio@xmath7 , where polarization arises from @xmath4-site displacements due to enhanced covalency with the surrounding oxygen anions , and improper ferroelectrics such as these ordered aluminates , where unequal anti - aligned @xmath0-site displacements result in layer dipoles .",
    "we showed that the ordering of @xmath0-site cations along the [ 111]-crystallographic axis in perovskite oxide superlattices , in conjunction with any rotational pattern containing only out - of - phase rotations results in a non - centrosymmetric space group . by selecting compounds which contain ground state rotational patterns described by only one lattice mode ( irreducible representation @xmath12 )",
    ", we were able to design three rock salt ordered superlattices , two of which display a spontaneous electric polarization originating from an improper ferroelectric mechanism .",
    "this type of design strategy prevents staggered paraelectric to ferroelectric phase transitions , possible in hybrid improper ferroelectrics where the most frequently pursued design route requires the @xmath10 tilt pattern , without sacrificing the desired electronic properties .",
    "additionally , we predicted the phase transition temperatures of each superlattice from first - principles , which showed that these compounds remain non - centrosymmetric up to 1300 k. across the ferroelectric phase transition , there is an order of magnitude increase in the piezoelectric coefficients comparable to conventional piezoelectric materials such as batio@xmath7 .",
    "this indicates that these materials may find potential use in high - temperature applications , as they have reasonable piezoelectric responses that persist over a broad temperature range .",
    "we hope the framework presented here encourages the synthesis of ultra - short perovskite superlattices on [ 111]-oriented substrates , and that it can be extended beyond these aluminates to other perovskite oxides with out - of - phase rotations .",
