    "the ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions provide a means to create a new state of matter at high temperature and density as the quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) predicts a phase transition from normal hadronic matter to quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) , a state of unconfined quarks and gluons . in recent years",
    "a considerable amount of theoretical and experimental activity is going on in this field .",
    "after the collision of two lorentz contracted nuclei , qgp is assumed to be formed and equilibrated in a very small time of the order of @xmath0 1 fm . in the usual description of the evolution of the plasma , it cools by expanding hydrodynamically till the critical temperature @xmath1 is reached at which a transition from qgp to normal hadronic matter takes place .",
    "the temperature remains fixed at @xmath1 until hadronization gets completed .",
    "this hadronization scenario corresponds to the ideal maxwell construction .",
    "however , in reality hadronization does not begin at @xmath2 due to the large nucleation barrier .",
    "recently csernai and kapusta have proposed a model for nucleation for the relativistic first order phase transition @xcite .",
    "supercooling , through nucleation of hadronic bubbles in qgp has been studied by several authors @xcite using the csernai - kapusta model of nucleation .",
    "a general outcome of these studies is that the plasma will cool according to the law @xmath3 till @xmath1 .",
    "the matter continues to cool below @xmath1 until the temperature goes down to about @xmath0 .8 @xmath1 , where bubble formation and growth becomes sufficient to reheat the system due to the release of latent heat .",
    "compared to the idealized maxwell construction the supercooling delays the transition and leads to an extra entropy production as the nucleation process allows dissipation around the hadronic bubbles .",
    "the dynamical prefactor @xcite in the nucleation rate includes quark viscosity coefficients which bring dissipative effect in the medium .",
    "in fact , the nucleation rate is limited by the ability of the dissipative processes to carry latent heat away from the bubbles s surface . however , for the dynamical evolution of the plasma the ideal hydrodynamics is used .",
    "this is not consistent as the viscosity dependent terms in hydrodynamics would also contribute to the entropy production .",
    "therefore , in this work we study the supercooling in the viscous hydrodynamics .",
    "the role of viscosity on supercooling and entropy production has been investigated in detail .",
    "the nucleation model computes the probability that a bubble of the hadronic matter appears in a system , initially in qgp phase near the critical temperature .",
    "further in the model a small baryon chemical potential is assumed .",
    "the bubble formation is assumed to take place in a homogeneous qgp phase consisting of @xmath4 and @xmath5 quarks and gluons , ignoring the role of inhomogenities such as strange quarks .",
    "it is further assumed that there is not substantial supercooling .",
    "langer s theory of nucleation gives the nucleation rate per unit volume at temperature @xmath6 as    @xmath7    where @xmath8 is the change in the free energy of the system due to the formation of a critical hadronic droplet , @xmath9 is a statistical prefactor which measures the available phase volume and @xmath10 is the volume of the system .",
    "the dynamical prefactor , @xmath11 determines the exponential growth rate of critical droplets which are perturbed from their equilibrium radius @xmath12 .",
    "the coarse - grained effective field theory approximation to qcd is utilised to obtain @xmath11 and @xmath9 .",
    "the factor @xmath9 is obtained as    @xmath13    where @xmath14 is the surface free energy and is determined as 50 mev/@xmath15 by lattice guage theory simulations without dynamical quarks .",
    "the correlation length @xmath16 is estimated as 0.7 fm .",
    "the dynamical prefactor @xmath11 is obtained as    @xmath17    where @xmath18 is the difference in the enthalpy densities of the two phases . @xmath19 and @xmath20 are respectively , the shear and bulk viscosity coefficients . inserting @xmath9 from eq .",

    "is simply taken as @xcite    @xmath33    where @xmath34 is the velocity of the bubble growth at temperature @xmath6 . by definition",
    "a critical size bubble is metastable and will not grow without a perturbation .",

    "the system must supercool at least @xmath0 5 % to attain a finite rate . in the evolution of the matter from qgp to hadron phase , the temperature varies with @xmath26 and its description by scaling hydrodynamics provides another equation so that @xmath25 and @xmath40 are determined from these equations at any proper time @xmath26 .",

    "the nucleation involves the surface free energy , correlation length , and the velocity of bubble growth , which have already been described in sec .",
    "the volume of a fluid element is @xmath101 .",
    "as @xmath102 does not change with @xmath26 in the scaling hydrodynamics , @xmath85 provides a measure of total entropy .",
    "so as to understand the role of supercooling and viscous heat generation , we have compared various scenarious ; ideal hydrodynamics ( ihd ) , ihd with supercooling , viscous hydrodynamics ( vhd ) and vhd with supercooling .",
    "we assumed that at initial time @xmath103 = 1 fm/@xmath104 , the temperature @xmath105=268 mev marked the beginning of the evolution .",
    "this corresponds to energy density @xmath53=8.51 gev/@xmath106 and entropy @xmath107=40.65 @xmath108 .",
    "these are appropriate for the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) energies . for further discussions ,",
    "it is instructive to examine @xmath26 versus @xmath6 plot . figure 1 shows such a plot for vhd calculations with supercooling included . from a initial point ( @xmath109 ) ,",
    "one moves on to @xmath110 where critical temperature is reached .",
    "however , the nucleation rate is zero at this point and system does not hadronize .",
    "the system keeps cooling to @xmath111 where significant nucleation rate and hadronization is reached .",
    "the system can not cool further as entropy can not decrease according to the second law of thermodynamics . at this point ,",
    "the hadron fraction is around 11 - 18 @xmath112 for various cases . as the temperature increases towards @xmath1 , the hadron fraction @xmath28 increases and slowly approaches a value of one at the point @xmath113 .",
    "after this , temperature starts decreasing finally reaching the point @xmath114 at the freeze - out temperature @xmath115 .",
    "this is the general character of @xmath116 curve .",
    "if one uses the maxwell construction , one reaches directly from ( @xmath117 to @xmath113 without any change in the temperature .    in figs . 2 and 3 , we show the results for @xmath6 , @xmath28 and @xmath85 as a function of @xmath26 for @xmath100=2.5 and 5 .",
    "for ihd , the critical temperature @xmath1 is reached earlier than vhd . similarly with supercooling included ,",
    "@xmath118 is approached earlier in ihd than vhd .",
    "the supercooling leads to an abrupt change in entropy starting from @xmath119 onwards , i.e. , in the reheating region .",
    "we find in our calculations that @xmath85 does not increase much beyond @xmath12020 fm/@xmath104 .",
    "therefore , @xmath121 represents reasonably well the total entropy produced .",
    "as @xmath122 is evaluated at @xmath1 for all cases , the total entropy is also a measure of the life time of the system upto the hadronization stage .",
    "figure 4 shows @xmath121 as a function of @xmath100 . with vhd ,",
    "entropy production increases with viscosity .",
    "supercooling leads almost to a constant shift of the curve for the vhd . in fig . 5 ,",
    "the excess entropy production due to supercooling is shown as a function of viscosity .",
    "for all values of @xmath100 , excess entropy does not change much .",
    "it is almost constant for the vhd calculation .",
    "we also found that the values of @xmath123 do not lead to significant hadronization and the system continues to cool in the qgp phase .",
    "sufficient value of @xmath100 is required for the transition to the hadron phase .",
    "the bubble growth velocity coefficient ( 3@xmath104 in our calculation ) also plays an important role in the transition as setting it to zero also blocks the transition .",
    "the viscosity plays very crucial role in the transition through nucleation .",
    "however , once viscosity enters into picture , the viscous hydrodynamics is to be used for consistency . in the presence of viscosity",
    ", the initial energy density estimates from the experimental rapidity density distribution would be lower than the ones calculated with the bjorken formula . though supercooling does not lead to significant increase in entropy production ,",
    "it is very much needed . for the description of the phenomena in relativistic nuclear collisions , the viscous hydrodynamics with supercooling",
    "is a more appropriate framework than the ideal hydrodynamics with or without supercooling .",
