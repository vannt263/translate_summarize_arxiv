    "it is somewhat paradoxical after many years of confirmation of quantum mechanics that new features can be learned on two of the simplest systems that are taught in the elementary courses : the hydrogen atom and the rigid rotor .",
    "it was indeed realized only in the early 90 s @xcite that a wave packet in the hydrogen atom evolves in time according to a universal scenario discovered theoretically by averbukh and perelman @xcite . for short times",
    "a well built wave packet moves around a kepler ellipsis , and then it spreads along the ellipsis .",
    "the surprise was that the wave packet is seen at specific times as a superposition of fractional wave packets concentrated around specific points on this trajectory .",
    "this behaviour results from the unitary quantum evolution and from self interferences . by changing the initial wave packet",
    "one can also obtain a radial wave packet without an analogue classical trajectory which will also experience the scenario of fractional revivals @xcite .",
    "an extension of these results has later been been made by bluhm and kostelecky @xcite who showed the existence of superrevivals for longer times .",
    "the aim of this article is to describe the similar steps for the rotation of symmetric rigid rotors with possible application to nuclei and to molecules .",
    "the theory of ref .",
    "@xcite is exact for all times if the energy spectrum is quadratic in one quantum like the infinite square well @xcite or in two quantum numbers like @xcite or the rigid top with axial symmetry . in ref .",
    "@xcite we studied various sets of angular momentum coherent states which represent an heteronuclear diatomic molecule or a rigid body with axial symmetry .",
    "our purpose is to show the rotation of a symmetric object described by a quantum pure state in the most obvious scheme ( i.e. if the law @xmath3 ) holds exactly ) for a wave packet specifically designed to rotate and what the motion is , if the initial preparation of the wave packet is different . because of the quantum spreading a quantum wp does not rotate at all like a classical rigid body , its spreading differs according to the initial conditions of its preparation .",
    "the introduction of this spreading is necessary if one introduces the concept of a wp which is not a common practice in the field of rotational nuclei or molecules .",
    "we must however acknowledge that this concept was first introduced in the past in the reference book by broglia and winther  @xcite on heavy ions collisions , then in a more extensive work by fonda et .",
    "@xcite who have discussed the mechanism of generation of several sets of rotational coherent wp .",
    "our work completes these two works in the sense that we give a full study of the time evolution of the wp which is now possible after the work of @xcite .",
    "our wp depend also on a new squeezing parameter @xmath0 introduced in @xcite which enables to change the geometry of the wp in a most significant manner .    before proceding to our work",
    "we must also quote most elegant papers by berry and golberg @xcite and berry @xcite who have studied the full time evolution of the propagator of a nuclear spin with a hamiltonian of the form @xmath4 .",
    "more recently various talbot effects were also discovered with the help of renormalization techniques @xcite .",
    "the occurrence of fractal dimensions both in space and time during the evolution of uniform wp in boxes of arbitrary dimensions has been also discovered @xcite .",
    "these last results show that the spreading of wp in a bound system is extremely rich .",
    "our purpose is to emphasize this richness for two dimensional wp on the sphere .",
    "in ref .  @xcite we have studied the properties and the time evolution of the following wp called the exponential coherent wp which depends on two parameters @xmath5 and @xmath0 .",
    "this normalized state is defined as @xmath6 for large enough values of @xmath5 the probability density associated to it is symmetric around @xmath7 and is peaked within a solid angle @xmath8 .",
    "thus , large values of @xmath5 correspond to defining the orientation of the axis of symmetry of the system in a very sharp way , quite independently on the value of the average angular momentum @xmath9 . for the components of",
    "l one can see that @xmath10 @xmath11 equation ( [ b3 ] ) is correct only for large @xmath5 , for small @xmath5 there is a small correction term not important for our discussion .",
    "therefore , the average of @xmath9 is fixed by the product @xmath12 .",
    "finally we have proved @xcite that the state ( [ b6 ] ) is made of a special class of angular momentum states called in the literature by the name of intelligent spin states ( for real values of @xmath0 ) .",
    "they obey the equation @xmath13 from this equation one can derive that the parameter @xmath0 has the meaning of a squeezing parameter since @xmath14 for all real values of @xmath0 the minimum uncertainty condition is satisfied @xmath15 the states ( [ b6 ] ) are such the analogous of the squeezed states of the electromagnetic field . in this article",
    "we will distinguish two limiting values of @xmath0 : the case @xmath16 corresponds to a purely real wp initially without momentum which we call the linear wp , the case @xmath17 , called a circular wp , is an eigenstate of @xmath18 .",
    "the other values correspond in the same terminology @xcite to elliptic wp .",
    "indeed these wp can be derived from gaussian wp which are respectively associated to linear , circular and elliptic trajectories if they evolve in 3d harmonic oscillator .",
    "the case of complex values of @xmath0 does not bring any interesting freedom @xcite , the main difference lying in the fact that the equality ( [ b4 ] ) is violated .",
    "therefore @xmath0 will take only real values in the following .",
    "the spherical harmonic expansion of the state ( 1 ) is written in terms of coefficients @xmath19 as @xmath20 @xmath21 for @xmath17 only the @xmath22 s with @xmath23 are non - zero .",
    "this is why these wave packets are called circular . in the case",
    "@xmath16 it is simpler to make a rotation of the coordinate axis to get an eigenstate of @xmath24 with eigenvalue 0 , the expansion of @xmath25 takes the form @xmath26 with @xmath27 given in terms of spherical bessel function of the first kind by @xmath28",
    "the situation we want to describe is that of an even , deformed nucleus with an axis of symmetry @xmath29 such that @xmath30 and with a plane of symmetry perpendicular to this axis .",
    "no other degree of freedom will be included .",
    "we therefore consider instead of ( [ b6 ] ) the following symmetrical combination @xmath31 \\ ; .\\ ] ] clearly for large @xmath5 it represents two antipodal waves , within the same solid angle as above and with the same symmetry around @xmath7 .",
    "the normalization constant @xmath32 depends now both on @xmath5 and @xmath12 because of an interference term between the two waves .",
    "it is given by @xmath33 \\right \\}^{(-1/2 ) }   % ( 12)\\ ] ] it should be stressed that the main difference in the time evolution of ( [ b6 ] ) and ( [ b1 ] ) comes from the interference between these two parts . as we will see it will become much different from a normalization factor .",
    "it is straightforward to verify that eqs .",
    "( [ b2 ] ) to ( [ b4 ] ) are still valid .",
    "we now express the wave packet @xmath34 in terms of new coefficients @xmath35 as @xmath36 and these coefficients are related to the @xmath19 by @xmath37",
    "let us study the evolution of @xmath34 for @xmath16 and @xmath17 assuming that the energy levels obey the rule @xmath38 in the following we will use @xmath39 and we define an average angular momentum by @xmath40 we can now use the work of @xcite to analyze the structure of the wave packets at time @xmath41 knowing simply that the wave packets are given by @xmath42 it is necessary to introduce two characteristic times as in @xcite @xmath43 note that @xmath44 if @xmath45 is large enough .",
    "we have with ( [ b15 ] ) and ( [ b16 ] ) @xmath46      let us sketch the general theory of @xcite which allows to find a universal scenario of fractional revivals . near @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is an irreducible ratio of two integers , it has been proved in @xcite that @xmath49 this sum contains @xmath50 non - zero terms if @xmath51 is even and @xmath52 terms if @xmath51 is odd .",
