    "one major problem in lattice gauge theory has been the increased amount of computer time and memory needed to do simulations near a critical point .",
    "the so - called critical slowing down can be countered , e.g. , with the fourier acceleration method @xcite .",
    "many other methods have been developed to accelerate convergence of the calculation , e.g. , the cluster algorithm @xcite , suitable for ising - type systems .",
    "when we studied the scalar @xmath0-model near the critical point on a _ momentum lattice _ @xcite , it turned out that quite reasonable results for the renomalized mass , wave function renormalization , etc .",
    ", could be obtained on relatively small lattices ( @xmath4@xmath5 ) . in this note",
    "we want to report a more detailed numerical analysis of the convergence behavior on a momentum lattice .",
    "momentum space has several interesting advantages over coordinate space :    * the kinetic energy of the action is local .",
    "* one can implement fourier acceleration to fight critical slowing down .",
    "* at the critical point , the correlation length goes to infinity .",
    "the behavior at @xmath6 in coordinate space corresponds to @xmath7 in momentum space . *",
    "the correlation function in momentum space behaves as @xmath8 near the critical point . at the critical point , @xmath9 , but one can stay away from the pole by choosing some @xmath10 . *",
    "although the action in momentum space is non - local , one can use a fast fourier transform to switch to coordinate space , where the interaction is local .",
    "we have used stochastic quantization , which is a direct method to go from the continuum formulation to practical algorithms for numerical simulations . we have studied the @xmath11 model and the non - compact @xmath12 gauge model .",
    "stochastic quantization was introduced by parisi and wu @xcite , and it has been applied by many authors ( for a review see damgaard and hffel @xcite ) .",
    "the idea is to consider the euclidean quantum field as the equilibrium state of a statistical system coupled to a heat reservoir .",
    "the evolution of this statistical system is described by the langevin equation , which reads in momentum space , @xmath13 } { \\delta \\hat \\phi(-k,\\tau ) }      + \\hat \\eta(k,\\tau),\\ ] ] where @xmath14 $ ] is the action in momentum space and @xmath15 is a field of gaussian noise .",
    "when @xmath16 the statistical system is `` equal '' to the euclidean field ; @xmath17 was introduced as fictitious time to evolve the system .",
    "our goal is to solve the langevin equation many times to generate a good representation of the canonical ensemble .",
    "then we perform the canonical averaging of the desired observable .",
    "the expectation value of an observable is defined by @xmath18 } } = \\lim_{\\tau \\rightarrow \\infty } \\frac{1}{\\tau }    \\int_{0}^{\\tau }    \\!\\ ! d \\tau ' \\ , o[\\hat \\phi(\\tau')].\\ ] ] because we suppose that our system is ergodic , the expectation value can be computed over the configuration space , @xmath19 \\right > = \\lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty } \\frac{1}{n }     \\sum^n_{n=1 }     o[\\hat \\phi_n].\\ ] ] so one must solve the langevin equation @xmath20 times in parallel , which can be done using a parallel processor .",
    "the langevin equation is a first order differential equation that we integrate up to a final value @xmath21 , by increments of @xmath22 .",
    "it can be solved using a standard method like euler s method where the truncation term is @xmath23 , or a higher order scheme like heun s method ( second order runge - kutta ) where the truncation term is @xmath24 .",
    "batrouni et al .",
    "@xcite have shown that a higher order integration scheme has many advantages , and our experience @xcite agrees with theirs .",
    "for the same level of error , heun s method is faster ; it takes fewer `` time '' steps . for the same `` time '' step ,",
    "it was 46% slower for the @xmath0-model , but in the case of the non - compact @xmath1-model it was only 12% slower ; in the case of the @xmath0-model , the second order scheme required the evaluation of two additional fast fourier transforms , but in the case of the @xmath1-model only a few more additions and multiplications were required . in fig.[1 ] we display for the @xmath0-model the behavior of the renomalized mass @xmath25 in the neighborhood of the critical point .",
    "we have computed in fig.[2 ] the renormalized mass @xmath25 as a function of @xmath21 for large @xmath22 on a lattice of @xmath4 points .",
    "this corresponds to a coupling parameter @xmath26 , while the critical point is at @xmath27 .",
    "stability of the solution is obtained for a value of @xmath28 by heun s method . for larger values of @xmath21 ,",
    "the accumulation of error becomes important and fluctuations can appear .",
    "we can see that the value of @xmath25 drops beyond @xmath29 in fig.[2 ] .",
    "it is easier to determine the stability region in the second order method .    for the non - compact @xmath1-model",
    "we have evaluated the expectation value @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the field tensor .",
    "we get very good agreement with the known exact value ; an error of less than 1% can be obtained easily . in momentum space",
    "@xmath32 is a local observable .",
    "we also computed the expectation value @xmath33 of the wilson loop observable , which corresponds to the creation of a quark - antiquark pair , the propagation of this `` meson '' and the destruction of the pair ( @xmath34 being the size of the rectangular loop measured in units of the lattice spacing ) .",
    "it is a non - local observable that can be computed analytically in the @xmath1-model .",
    "it seems to be more sensitive to fluctuations than @xmath35 .",
    "when integrating the langevin equation , if we continue to iterate too long after the equilibrium is reached , the field of noise @xmath15 creates some fluctations in the solution .",
    "these fluctuations are more important for non - local observables , which are difficult to evaluate on small lattices . in figs .",
    "[ 3 ] and [ 4 ] , we computed the expectation value of the wilson loop operator for different sizes of loops and for two different `` time '' steps on a lattice of @xmath36 points .",
    "we can see the fluctuation introduced by the noise field @xmath15 . in fig.[3 ] the `` time ''",
    "step was @xmath37 , and in fig.[4 ] the `` time '' step was @xmath38 .",
    "the important difference is the number of `` time '' steps .",
    "when we compare the results of figs .",
    "[ 3,4 ] we notice a difference which seems to exceed the error @xmath39 due to finite @xmath22 .",
    "we can reduce fluctuations by increasing the number of configurations of fields , but we can also average several values of @xmath17 up to @xmath21 .",
    "although we have not used the last method , we think it might reduce fluctuations @xcite .",
    "stochastic quantization allows us to choose the value of @xmath21 .",
    "the propagator for the free scalar theory in euclidean momentum space for finite @xmath21 is @xmath40 compared with the euclidean feynman propagator , @xmath41 we can see that one must choose @xmath42 large enough to make the exponential term negligible . for the non - compact @xmath1-model in momentum space , we are free to choose a value for each lattice point ( fourier acceleration ) .",
    "the point @xmath43 turns out to be dangerous in the @xmath1-model because there is no interaction between lattice sites . for the @xmath0-model that does not seem to be the case ; the convergence rate seems to be a little slower near the critical point , but does not differ very much .",
    "our study of two models shows the feasibility of doing lattice simulations on a small momentum lattice .",
    "the second order scheme was by far more appropriate because of its greater accuracy and speed .",
    "the difference in the results due to variation of @xmath22 encountered during the simulation of the @xmath1-model for the wilson loop operator does not seem to pose a major problem .",
    "we believe that the averaging over several values of @xmath17 up to @xmath21 can increase the numerical stability .",
    "this kind of behavior has not been seen in the @xmath0-model .",
    "the knowledge of the stability region is very important for simulations of theories like @xmath44 and @xmath45 . for these models ,",
    "the time needed for generating equilibrium configurations is much larger than for the @xmath1-model .",
