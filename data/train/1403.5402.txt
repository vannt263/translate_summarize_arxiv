    "the classical @xcite ( cir)/ @xcite square - root diffusion has been a workhorse in the stochastic intensity approach to the modeling of default risk in financial markets since the seminal work of @xcite and @xcite on reduced - form default modeling ; see monographs @xcite , @xcite and @xcite for surveys . in this framework ,",
    "the default time can be thought of as the first jump time of a doubly stochastic poisson process ( cox process ) with stochastic intensity following a diffusion process .",
    "the attractiveness of the cir diffusion as the model for intensity stems from , on one hand , its dynamics and , on the other hand , its analytical tractability .",
    "if the coefficient of the linear term in the drift is negative , and the constant term is positive , then cir diffusion is mean - reverting , which is an important empirical feature observed in credit markets . at the same time",
    ", the process stays nonnegative due to vanishing volatility and positive drift near the origin .",
    "its analytical tractability stems , on one hand , from its close connection with bessel processes [ @xcite , @xcite , chapter  6 of @xcite , @xcite ] and , on the other hand , from its membership in the class of affine processes [ @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ] .",
    "the former connection yields explicit expressions for the cir transition density and the associated feynman ",
    "kac semigroup , while the later connection yields an explicit expression for laplace transform of the time integral of the cir process , giving rise to a closed - form solution for the survival probability in the cir default intensity model that essentially coincides with the expression for the bond price in cir interest rate model .",
    "these properties lead to analytical pricing for a wide range of credit - sensitive instruments in cir - based models [ e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ] .",
    "a limitation of the cir default intensity model is its inability to capture jumps in credit spreads and prices of credit - sensitive securities ( other than the default event itself ) .",
    "this led a number of authors to introduce jumps into the cir model [ @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ( @xcite ) ] . to preserve analytical tractability ,",
    "all of the models considered in the literature so far have been in the affine class .",
    "the most general extensions of the one - dimensional cir diffusion with jumps that remain in the affine class are continuous state branching processes with immigration ( cbi ) of @xcite ; see @xcite for a detailed treatment in the context of applications to interest rate term structure modeling",
    ". roughly speaking , cbi - processes are nonnegative feller processes with cir - type diffusion components and one - sided , positive jumps with the compensator measure of the form @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the lvy measure of a subordinator , and @xmath8 is the lvy measure of a spectrally positive lvy process ; see theorem 4.3 in @xcite for the explicit expression of their infinitesimal generator and the summary of their properties .",
    "a limitation of cbi - processes is the one - sided nature of their jumps . from the standpoint of financial applications ,",
    "their sample path behavior is somewhat unnatural .",
    "cbi processes can only jump up , and can never jump down . assuming",
    "the drift of the cbi - process is mean - reverting , if the process experiences a large jump up bringing it far away from its long - run mean , the only mechanism for it to return back to its long - run mean is via its continuous mean - reverting drift , with no possibility to jump back down .",
    "moreover , jumps of cbi - processes are either state independent ( governed by @xmath7 if @xmath9 ) , or depend linearly of the current state via @xmath10 multiplying @xmath11 .",
    "the one - sided nature of jumps and their affine dependence on the state are common to general affine processes , for example , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , this is in contrast to the behavior often observed in financial markets where a jump in one direction may be followed by a jump in the opposite direction .",
    "this behavior is often observed in energy markets , where mean - reverting models are commonly used to capture the spike - like behavior of the spot price of electricity [ e.g. , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ] .",
    "this is also relevant in credit markets , where the succession of good and bad news about the financial health of an obligor , such as a firm or a sovereign viewed by the markets to be in distress , can result in sharp changes in its market credit spreads over relatively short periods of time ( witness the recent behavior of some european credit spreads sea - sawing under the influence of the rapidly changing flow of economic and political news ) .",
    "recent empirical literature studying positive and negative jumps in credit spreads includes @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this paper proposes a new approach to introducing more realistic two - sided jump behavior into diffusion intensity models via bochner s subordination .",
    "we start with a nonnegative diffusion intensity model and time change it with a subordinator , that is , a nonnegative lvy process with positive jumps and nonnegative drift .",
    "we show that this results in a jump - diffusion ( when the subordinator has a positive drift ) or a pure - jump ( when the subordinator is driftless ) intensity model with two - sided jumps that stays nonnegative . in particular ,",
    "when the diffusion is cir , the time - changed model possesses a nonnegative intensity process with two - sided , mean - reverting jumps .",
    "the compensator measure of this intensity process is state - dependent , and the state - dependence is such that it automatically prevents the process from going negative .",
    "while the process can experience downward jumps , the magnitude of negative jumps depends on the pre - jump state of the process to keep the process nonnegative . while the structure of the process is highly state - dependent ( and obviously nonaffine ) ,",
    "remarkably , the model remains fully analytically tractable by means of eigenfunction expansions .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ biv ]",
    "we review diffusion intensity models in the particular setting convenient for our purposes .",
    "namely , we consider a bi - variate process @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the state variable following a nonnegative diffusion process ( pre - intensity ) , and @xmath2 is an event indicator process @xmath2 .",
    "the bi - variate process is a markov process on @xmath12 and a semimartingale .",
    "this section contains a detailed discussion of the bi - variate process @xmath0 both from the markovian and from the semimartingale points of view .",
    "while the diffusion intensity model is very well known , this detailed presentation in the bi - variate form is provided for the reader s convenience to set up notation in preparation for our treatment of the time - changed ( subordinated ) model by both markovian and semimartingale methods . we note that this bi - variate point of view of diffusion default intensity models is also followed in some interesting recent papers by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite in the context of pricing multi - name credit derivatives . in section  [ sub.sec ]",
    "we time change the bi - variate process @xmath0 with a lvy subordinator @xmath3 with laplace exponent @xmath13 .",
    "the resulting time - changed process @xmath14 is a markov process with its infinitesimal generator given by the phillips theorem .",
    "we explicitly compute the generator from the phillips theorem and obtain its representation as an integro - differential operator . being a time change of a semimartingale ,",

    "we detail the eigenfunction expansion approach to calculate the semigroup associated to the bi - variate process @xmath14 and , in particular , to calculate the survival probability and prices of defaultable securities . in section  [ subcirspec ] we specialize @xmath1 to be the cir diffusion and thus obtain the subordinate cir ( subcir ) default intensity model .",
