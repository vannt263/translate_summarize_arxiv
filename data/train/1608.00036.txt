    "the problem of the elusiveness of the dark matter ( dm ) can be solved speculating that it interacts with particles and gauge fields of the standard model ( sm ) only by means of portals that connect our world to the dark sector .",

    "in addition , it has been pointed that the existence of an @xmath3 with a mass @xmath5 in the range @xmath6 $ ] and a coupling constant @xmath7 , might be responsible for the discrepancy currently observed between the theoretical expectation , based on the sm , and the measurement of the muon anomalous magnetic moment @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "if there are no particles in the hidden sector with mass smaller than one half of @xmath3 , it can only have sm decays ( visible decays ) .",
