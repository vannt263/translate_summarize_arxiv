    "cluster lensing has two major advantages over field surveys for exploring galaxy formation .",
    "in addition to the magnification boost , it is actually possible to derive source distances purely geometrically from the relative angles between sets of counter - images .",
    "this ability provides a very welcomed check of redshifts derived photometrically , particularly at high redshift where detection is weakest and restricted to fewer passbands . for this purpose an accurate lens model",
    "is required , based on many sets of multiply - lensed images and ideally sampling a wide range of source distances . the angles through which light is deflected scale with increasing source distance behind a given lens .",
    "distances derived this way can then be converted via cosmological parameters to source redshifts and compared with independently derived photometric redshifts .",
    "this method has been established using the large lensing cluster a1689 , where geometric distances provided a self - consistency check of the lens model @xcite .    currently , efficient detection of high redshift galaxies is best achieved using the ir channel of the hst wide - field camera-3 ( wfc3 ) , supported by the spitzer space telescope s infrared array camera ( irac ) in the mid - ir .",
    "this combination is now generating statistically useful samples of dropout galaxies to @xmath5 in several independent deep field surveys @xcite .",
    "the highest redshift galaxies reliably claimed at present has been discovered in the recently completed clash hubble treasury program @xcite despite minimal exposures of only one orbit in the nir bands .",
    "although the principal aim of the clash program is to establish a representative distribution of equilibrium mass profiles for relaxed clusters , several high magnification clusters have been included in the hope of striking relatively bright examples of distant magnified galaxies .",
    "the highest redshift claimed is a triply - lensed small round object that lies an estimated redshift of z@xmath610.7 @xcite , followed by a similar object at @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "both these objects lie behind high magnification clusters defined by the clash program .",
    "these discoveries have led to a dedication of a large hubble `` frontier field '' ( hff ) program of deep optical - nir imaging to utilise cluster lensing for the purpose of discovering statistical samples of even higher redshift galaxies ( hubble deep fields initiative 2012 science working group report ) .",
    "in fact , since the phenomenon of cluster lensing was first appreciated , it has consistently provided record breaking redshifts and relatively bright images useful for spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "the targets chosen for the hff include some of the most magnifying clusters known , caught in the process of merging and therefore having complex mass distribution .",
    "these systems are characterised by large einstein radii and shallow mass distributions , established in earlier hubble imaging , principally from the acs / gto program @xcite and by the recently completed clash survey @xcite .",
    "the largest known of these lenses is macs j0717.5 + 3745(z=0.55 ) , which has an elongated critical area equivalent to an einstein radius of 55(at z=2.5 ) as originally uncovered by @xcite .",
    "this cluster was established by the clash survey to be the most massive known cluster at @xmath8 when weak lensing is added to derive the full virial mass distribution from lensing @xcite .",
    "similarly , the merging cluster macs j1149.5 + 2223(z=0.54 ) has a very shallow unrelaxed mass profile ( zintrin & broadhurst 2009 ) from adjacent overlapping substructures , forming a large critically lensed central area with very high magnification . for macs",
    "j0416.1- 2403 , long complex critical curves have been uncovered in the clash survey @xcite with multiple linear substructures .",
    "more recently we visited this cluster but using hff data confirming the findings of @xcite @xcite . in the case of a2744 , which is the subject of the work presented here ,",
    "the impressive scale of lensing and the dynamical interaction of several mass components were reported by @xcite , offsets can be seen between the lensing mass components and the complex x - ray morphology , indicating collisions are on - going between perhaps three cluster sized objects . out of the six clusters selected for the new hubble frontier fields program ,",
    "four have already been imaged to shallower depths by hubble as part of the clash survey .",
    "several sets of multiply lensed images have been catalogued for each cluster , having reliable photometric redshifts based on 16 overlapping optical / nir filters and additional spitzer data in the mid - ir .",
    "the hff program is in fact the first deep campaign with hubble to utilise cluster lensing for studying galaxy formation .",
    "the high magnification clusters selected combined with long exposures in the near - infrared ( nir ) is anticipated to extend the detection of galaxies to @xmath9 , corresponding to the effective limiting dropout redshift of the nir filters employed by the hff .",
    "the magnified flux limit for small sources is substantially fainter than the comparable long integrations of the deep field surveys . supporting x - ray and",
    "mid - ir data will be provided by additional deep chandra and spitzer satellite imaging , thereby extending the scientific interest in this uniquely deep dataset .",
    "in addition a good case for very deep complementary radio imaging with the extended - vla ( evla ) can be made for these targets , given the potential serendipity value in the relatively unexplored radio regime at high redshift .",
    "the improving quality of lensing data for clusters imaged with the hst encourages improved lens modelling to take advantage of the increasing constraints on the distribution of dark matter .",
    "several lens models are already made publicly available , and can be catagorised as either parametric or free - form .",
    "parametric modelling , which uses light as a rough guide for where to place masses , is best suited to virialized clusters @xcite , and may be extended to accommodate obvious bimodal substructure . in general , however , the complexities of massive merging clusters such as those chosen for the hff program will require the definition of several new parameters for each additional model halo , with the choice of location being less than objective . the extent to which such modelling",
    "can capture the real complexities of tidally distorted dark matter during extreme gravitational encounters has prompted us to look harder at the possibility of grid solutions , whereby the lens plane can be represented on either a uniform or an adaptive grid . in early non - parametric studies , the uniform grid lens models were not accurate enough for identifying new sets of multiple images because they did not have high enough resolution to capture the local perturbing effects of cluster galaxies . a huge improvement has recently been achieved in this approach by incorporating the observed member galaxies along with the smoother and more distributed mass in a uniform grid .",
    "this then allows meaningful solutions to be found as the small scale deflections and additional multiple images locally generated by the member galaxies can be accounted for .",
    "this approach generates lens models that are sufficiently accurate and self - consistent for the identification of multiple systems , so that physically plausible mass distributions can be derived free of model assumptions .",
    "this has been demonstrated with both simulated data @xcite and actual observation on a relaxed cluster ( abell 1689 , @xcite ) .",
    "although only the nir part of hff observation on a2744 has been completed , with the optical part currently underway , there is already a large number of multiple images identified , sufficient for our non - parametric method to be applied .",
    "previous lens models and claimed high - z galaxies recently detected using the hff data behind a2744 are summarised in section [ sec : previous ] . we construct our own filtered colour images in the optical and nir and describe our photometric redshift measurements in section [ sec : colour ] . in section [ sec : model ] we describe our methodology of constructing a free - form lens model .",
    "we define `` geometric redshifts '' in section [ sec : geoz ] , based on the distance - redshift scaling for multiply - lensed galaxies . in section [ sec : individual ] we describe each of the 18 lensed image systems in turn , with relensed images , geometric and photometric redshift comparisons .",
    "our main results are described in section [ sec : results ] , with conclusions and discussion is section [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "standard cosmological parameters are adopted : @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "as part of the hff project , several lensing models of a2744 have been offered in the mast archive .",
    "the models differ considerably in terms of their magnification maps , but all are based on a similar set of multiple images , most of which were first reported by @xcite and uncovered by the method of @xcite .",
    "this semi - parametric method has proven to be a most effective tool for predicting the location of counter images , based on the assumption that the distribution of dark matter can be approximated by distribution of member galaxies . in this method , the masses of member galaxies are scaled by their luminosity and co - added , and a low order smoothing applied with free coefficients to allow for some flexibility in modelling the general cluster component . depending on the size of the lens and the complexity of the mass distribution , the typical positional uncertainty in predicting counter images using",
    "this method is in the range of 1 - 5 \" .",
    "since the aforementioned models were made available , several new spectroscopic redshifts of lensed images have been reported by @xcite , which we make use of in our work described below , as listed in table [ table1 ] .",
    "additional vlt and subaru images @xcite have also used to constrain these models .",
    "comparisons have been made between these model makers and a joint effort to understand and quantify systematic errors and other uncertainties , and hence the performance of reconstruction tools were assessed with simulations of cluster observations @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite reported 18 candidate lyman - break galaxies ( lbg ) at @xmath12 7 in the field of a2744 .",
    "the faintest sources detected are around ab magnitude 28.5 .",
    "a high quality sample of 24 objects with `` secure '' photometric redshifts greater than 7 is claimed , each with probability ( @xmath13 ) of being at low redshift .",
    "another object at @xmath14 has recently been reported by @xcite , and is consistent with the redshift estimated by @xcite .",
    "an early publication by @xcite has claimed 6 sets of multiple images with photometric redshifts in the range @xmath15 .",
    "as we will show , three of these sets need correcting , another seems spurious , and two others we complete with additional multiple images .",
    "@xcite revised their parametric model with new gemini spectroscopy for two of the multiply lensed systems of @xcite .",
    "@xcite discovered a double image pair of a z@xmath69.83 galaxy , becoming the multiply - lensed system with the highest redshift in the field of a2744 .",
    "@xcite claimed @xmath16150 multiple images using the complete hff data .",
    "we retrieved the drizzled science images from the online mast hff data archive .",
    "the individually reduced images are produced by _",
    "@xcite and publicly available .",
    "these deep images can probe faint galaxies to magnitudes of @xmath17 , not to mention the magnification due to cluster lensing , which could increase the limiting magnitude to @xmath18 .",
    "our analysis uses the complete hff data of a2744 .",
    "we refer the details of the observations to @xcite and the official website of hff .",
    "the identification of multiple images is made difficult for counter images that are buried in the light of bright member galaxies and when significantly contaminated by diffuse light in the cluster core .",
    "we produce colour images after processing the seven acs+wfc3 bands in order to ( i ) reduce the brightness from bright member galaxies and/or , cluster core , and ( ii ) increase the signal to noise ratio of faint distant objects .",
    "to increase the signal - to - noise ratio of faint objects , we smoothed the images in each passband with a gaussian filter of fwhm ranging from 60 milliarcsecond for the ir bands to 100 milliarcsecond for the optical bands .",
    "this smoothing also helps to compensate for the difference in angular resolution between the acs and wfc3 cameras , producing images more nearly matched in angular resolution . to reduce the glare of bright member galaxies",
    ", we applied a low - pass filter to the individual bands thus reducing the diffuse light around the centre . in this way",
    ", the surface brightness and internal structures of the objects falling in this region can be more reliably compared with possible counter images at larger radius .",
    "finally , as shown in figure [ combo_map ] , we adopted a combination of a power law plus a gaussian colour scaling to the images that we found provided a dynamical range of colours that matches the relatively faint range of brightness of the majority of lensed images .",
    "the filtering process described above , however , causes colour changes in images close to the diffuse intra - cluster light . as a result",
    ", multiple images might be mistakenly associated if relying on colour information only .",
    "therefore , we also generated a simple rgb image without subtraction of the smooth light component with the publicly available software _ _",

    "it is constructed from complete - hff data , with f435w and f606w bands constituting the blue colour , f814w for green , and the nir bands f105w , f125w , f140w , and f160w for red . the full resolution version can be found electronically online .",
    ", width=321 ]    using the optimised colour images produced , we identify obvious sets of counter images for those sources with distinctive morphologies and unusual colours .",
    "these images are then used to generate an initial free - form model described in section [ sec : model ] below .",
    "note that in the case of highly - magnified long arcs , we include points along the length of the arc as our model is designed to make use of this additional information .",
    "having generated an initial deflection field based on the obvious multiple systems , this model can then be used to help search for less obvious systems which are either less distinctive or for which counter images lie at locations that are not readily anticipated without the help of a model .",
    "for this purpose , free - form modelling is especially important because , unlike for more relaxed clusters , the lensing deflection field of a2744 is strongly perturbed by the on - going merging of sub - components as is evident from the multi - modal distribution of member galaxies and the observed spatial distribution of the cluster x - ray emission , and can not therefore be readily foreseen .",
    "we also compare the spectral energy distributions of candidate multiple - image systems to ensure consistency , given the achromatic nature of gravitational lensing .",
    "photometric redshifts for these images are estimated using the bpz method @xcite , for which the whole probability distribution is provided , as shown in figures [ bpz1 ] to [ bpz2 ] .",
    "the bpz algorithm uses a template library which consists of model spectra of five elliptical galaxies , two spiral galaxies , and four starburst galaxies with moderately strong emission lines .",
    "originally the templates were based on the pgase stellar population synthesis models @xcite , but have been empirically corrected using a subset of sources from the fireworks survey @xcite , for which photometric and spectroscopic redshifts can be compared .",
    "flat priors on both galaxy type and redshift in the range @xmath19 are assumed here , as is standard practice .",
    "apart from having similar sed , the positions of the images as well as their orientations must also be consistent with each other . for this purpose ,",
    "we have developed a relensing tool so that the pixels of any object can be delensed back to the source plane and then remapped onto the image plane to generate the expected appearance of counter - images . when relensing , we can make use of the photometric redshift information including its uncertainty , but this is not necessary and often ambiguous for very faint images . instead , we created relensed images to cover a range of source distances defining `` loci '' along which we search for counter images . in this way",
    ", we can both reliably identify relensed counter - images and obtain purely geometric distance estimates for each set of multiple images , as described more fully in the next section .    rather than using automated software to perform the photometry",
    ", we conducted our own photometry for most of the candidate lensed galaxies to construct their seds .",
    "the photometry for each lensed image is performed with tailored - made apertures and sky annuli .",
    "this refinement is necessary due to the highly distorted shapes of most of the candidate lensed galaxies , making it difficult for automated software to capture .",
    "it is also necessary for lensed images that appear close to member galaxies , where they are buried in bright intracluster light and could not be detected by the automated software .",
    "the size of each source aperture extends to where the source intensity falls to the noise level in the f160w band .",
    "the corresponding sky annulus is separated from the source aperture boundary by @xmath160.1 \" , and contains as many pixels as in the source aperture .",
    "the fits to seds and the resultant probability distribution function in redshift space along with relevant uncertainties are shown in figure [ bpz1 ] to [ bpz2 ] and summarised in table [ table1 ] .",
    "in addition to the photometric redshifts we obtained from the sed fits , we also evaluated the validity of claims of multiple - image systems by checking whether the sed s are similar to each other . unless a system has a reported spectroscopic redshift ,",
    "the photometric redshift of each system with the best fitted sed is chosen to be the input redshift when constructing the lens model , as described in section [ sec : individual ] .",
    "the free form lensing method developed by @xcite is a grid - based iterative method that can be constrained by both strong and weak lensing information , including sets of individual pixels subtended by resolved arcs in the case of strong lensing .",
    "we have recently demonstrated that this methods can be significantly improved by the addition of observed member galaxy deflections ( weak and strong lensing analysis package plus member galaxies : wslap+ , @xcite ) because typically one or more counter - images of each multiply - lensed system is either generated or significantly deflected by a local member galaxy .",
    "we have applied this method recently to the relaxed cluster a1689 @xcite and demonstrated that this combination of high and low frequency components can converge to meaningful solutions with sufficient accuracy to allow the detection of new counter - images for further constraining the lensing solution of a1689 . because this method is free - form",
    ", it should be especially useful for modelling the complex mass distributions ( which can not be readily foreseen ) of the clusters chosen for the hubble frontier fields program .",
    "parameterised models are inherently less useful in this context because many additional and uncertain parameters having limited constraints must be introduced .    here",
    "we outline briefly this new method , wslap+ , for the mass reconstruction and refer the reader for details of its implementation and testing to our previous papers @xcite .",
    "+ given the standard lens equation , @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the observed angular position of the source , @xmath22 is the deflection angle , @xmath23 is the surface mass density of the cluster at the position @xmath21 , and @xmath24 is the position of the background source , both the strong lensing and weak lensing observables can be expressed in terms of derivatives of the lensing potential @xmath25 where @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are , respectively , the angular diameter distances to the lens , from the lens to the source , and from the observer to the source . the unknowns of the lensing problem are in general the surface mass density and the positions of the background sources .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the lensing problem can be expressed as a system of linear equations that can be represented in a compact form , @xmath29 where the measured lensing observables are contained in the array @xmath30 of dimension @xmath31 , the unknown surface mass density and source positions are in the array @xmath32 of dimension @xmath33 , and the matrix @xmath34 is known ( for a given grid configuration and initial galaxy deflection field , see below ) and has dimension @xmath35 .",
    "@xmath36 is the number of strong lensing observables ( each one contributing with two constraints , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 ) , and @xmath39 is the number of grid points ( or cells ) that we divide the field of view ( @xmath40 ) into , which equals to @xmath41 in this case .",

    "@xmath43 is the number of background sources ( each contributes with two unknowns , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 , see @xcite for details ) .",
    "the unknowns are found after minimizing a quadratic function that estimates the solution of the system of equations [ eq_lens_system ] , with the constraint that the solution , @xmath32 , must be positive , and that the convergence of the solution does not exceed the angular resolution of the data .",
    "this constraint is particularly important to avoid the unphysical situation where the masses associated to the galaxies are negative ( which could otherwise provide a reasonable solution , from the formal mathematical point of view , to the system of linear equations [ eq_lens_system ] ) . imposing the constraint @xmath46 also helps in regularizing the solution as it avoids large negative and positive contiguous fluctuations .",
    "the minimization is carried out on the source plane , meaning that our algorithm iterates in search for a solution ( mass distribution and source positions ) such that the image pixels of each lensed system converges on the source plane . at each iteration ,",
    "the algorithm searches for a new solution in the direction of steepest descent ( in terms of chi - squared ) , which is also required to be orthogonal to that of the previous iteration .    when sufficient constraints are available , the addition of the small deflections by member galaxies can help improve the mass determination . for our study",
    "we select the brightest elliptical galaxies ( from the red sequence ) in the cluster central region and associate to them a mass according to their luminosity .",
    "member galaxies are selected to lie on the prominent colour - magnitude relation for early - type galaxies , by requiring their positions on the colour - magnitude diagram ( f435w - f160w vs f160w ) to be bounded by the empirical conditions y = -0.25*x + 8.0 , y = -0.15*x + 7.0 , and x = 22.0 , as marked in large red crosses in figure [ member ] .",
    "several stars that satisfied the requirements are identified and removed manually .",
    "finally , a total of 91 member galaxies were selected to construct the galaxy deflection field . from the h band ( f160w )",
    "ab magnitudes , a mass - to - light ratio of 20 m@xmath47/l@xmath47 is initially assumed to construct the fiducial deflection field summed over the member galaxies , each having a truncated nfw profile ( truncation radius equals scale radius times concentration parameter ) with a scale radius linearly related to its fwhm in the nir image . for our purpose ,",
    "the exact choice of profile for member galaxies is not particularly important ; what matters more is the normalisation .",
    "this normalization is the only free parameter of the fiducial deflection field , and is determined by our optimization procedure .",
    "in @xcite we tested this addition to the method with simulated lensed images , but with the real galaxy members from a1689 to be as realistic as possible .",
    "we also found that a separate treatment of the bcg lensing amplitude was warranted , adding a second deflection field i.e @xmath48 ( see definition of @xmath42 above ) to be solved for .",
    "here we follow the same procedure for a2744 incorporating member galaxies and the bcgs separately .",
    "we also find significant improvements in the residual by leaving free the amplitude of bright galaxies that significantly perturb nearby lensed images . in total , as shown in figure [ member_mass ] , we decomposed the fiducial deflection field into 10 components , comprising the central cd galaxy , the cd galaxy in the se and its companion , several other groups of galaxy where there are multiply - lensed images nearby , and the rest of the member galaxies .",
    "we estimate the uncertainties of the mass distribution , source positions , and magnification map using the ensemble of solutions we find compatible with the data .",

    "the accuracy of our identifications is demonstrated by delensing and relensing the well resolved images that have notable elongation / distortion and distinct internal structures .",
    "for these , as well as other multiply - lensed images that are not well - resolved , we also indicate the centroids of each predicted counter images in figures [ stamps1 ] to [ stamps6 ] . the distribution of such positional offsets between predicted and observed images are shown in figure [ histogram ] .",
    "it has a modal value of 0.4  , a mean of 1.0  , and an rms of 1.2  .",
    "some outliers correspond to those lying close to the critical curves where predicted positions become very model / redshift sensitive .",

    "we also provide our own model reconstruction of the images , using the pixels of each image in turn to generate the other two images for comparison with the observed images , as shown in figure [ system1 ] .",

    "we securely demonstrate that these four images are related by successively delensing and relensing to generate predictions for the other three .",
    "we can see that the agreement between the predicted images and the observations is in general very good in terms of the predicted centroids .",
    "there is a small difference in the orientation of the central radially directed images , indicating the dm distribution of the central cd galaxy may be more complex than the circular symmetry assumed in our model .",

    "the tangential critical curve of this `` caterpillar '' shaped object runs between images 3.1 and 3.2 showing reflection symmetry .",
    "our non - parametric algorithm , however , tends to produce a lens model with the critical curve lying 1  to the west of 3.1 rather than passing between 3.1 and 3.2 ; i.e. , a difference in the expected position of the critical curve of 2  . as a result ,",
    "additional images that are obviously not observed are predicted on the other side of the critical curve when we delens and relens 3.1 and 3.2 , as shown in figure [ system3 ] .",

    "the mass distribution we derive is smooth and generally follows the distribution of the bright member galaxies , but with some departures in detail . in figure [ mass ]",
    "we can see a clear hint that the x - ray emission from three of the brighter emission regions seem to be affecting locally the mass map we derived from lensing . more generally , the offset between the centroid of our dm map the bulk of the x - ray emission is highly indicative of a major head - on collision along an axis connecting the dm distribution and the nw cluster component that lies @xmath162 beyond the edge of our field , which is noticeable in the corner of the hubble data by virtue of strongly lensed images present there - see also @xcite .",
    "the disturbed hot gas lies in between the two massive clusters along the axis joining them and closer to the main mass in our map , indicating this is the larger of the two mass components , similar to the case of the `` bullet cluster '' . in light of our findings",
    ", a binary collision solution is motivated using the combined dm and hot gas information modelled with a combined hydrodynamical / n - body model , which has proved useful for several other major post - merger binary clusters including the `` bullet cluster '' and `` el gordo '' @xcite and most recently for the hff cluster macs0416 @xcite .",
    "we have found that the redshift distribution of multiply lensed images extends over a wide redshift range , from z@xmath161.0 to z@xmath1610.0 , and is fairly uniform in the high z range , so far as we may conclude on the basis of 21 sources . beyond this",
    "nothing compelling is yet found despite the high magnification for multiply - lensed images generated by a2744 .",
    "so it is interesting that the hff filters set does permit the detection of more distant objects , to z@xmath1611.5 , and yet despite the high magnification generated by this cluster there is only a few multiply - lensed galaxies above z@xmath167 .",
    "conceivably , we may establish ir dropout galaxies more confidently with the addition of the upcoming optical data amongst the fainter nir detections , but even with the full data set we do not anticipate significant additional numbers of multiply lensed galaxies with @xmath74 as very few very red nir detections are unmatched within the critically lensed region .",
    "this relative deficit of high - z galaxies is consistent with the conclusions for the single , less magnified high - z images identified photometrically by @xcite , with careful photometry combined with hff and spitzer imaging . in this study , there also seems to be a similar effective upper redshift limit of z@xmath69 , although the magnification of these single images is generally several times smaller than the highly magnified area where the multiply lensed sources lie .",
    "clearly it is now important to model this redshift distribution and the corresponding luminosity functions with careful consideration of the selection effects so that the reality and significance of this deficit can be quantified .",
    "a recent calculation by @xcite estimated 6 objects are expected in a typical hff field at z @xmath75 9 based on the luminosity functions extrapolated from that observed in @xmath76 convolved with the magnification maps submitted by the community .",
    "clearly we will need to model the expected redshift distribution carefully to quantify the level of this deficit and we need to examine the five additional deep hff clusters being scheduled , allowing for a more accurately defined redshift distribution averaged over large scale fluctuations in galaxy numbers .",
    "monotonously declining evolution is of course expected in the gravitationally scale free case of standard collisionless particle interpretation of cdm , and this is probably consistent with the measured evolution of the integrated star formation rate of @xcite , at @xmath77 , given the freedom to relate the observables to the predicted growth of the halo mass function .",
    "however , a sharp break above @xmath14 does look like a surprising departure in this context and may hint that the process of galaxy formation is not scale free as with cdm , but begins more suddenly than expected . or perhaps , the reionization period occurred , on average , at later times than suggested by recent polarization data of cmb , and more in line with measurements of the lyman@xmath22 forest . the sense of this difference may point towards a lack of small halos at this simplest level , and is certainly not in conflict with local observations of the galaxy mass function which does not seem to extend much below a few @xmath78 , as judged by the local dwarf galaxies @xcite .",
    "warm dark matter ( wdm ) may help reconcile this behaviour , where free streaming of previously relativistic dark matter is invoked to suppress small structures and provide shallow cores .",
    "however , detailed calculations of this do not seem to manage to be self - consistent , as the light particle mass of @xmath160.5 kev required to generate large cores , would eliminate the formation of too many galaxies , for which a higher minimum mass of @xmath163 kev is required to permit the formation of dwarf spheroidal galaxies @xcite .",
    "another possibility has emerged from consideration of cold dark matter in condensate form where the first simulations of this unexplored form of cdm show how the jeans scale inherent to a condensate can sharply suppress objects below @xmath79 , and provide `` solitonic '' cores of constant density in dwarf spheroidal galaxies , without preventing the formation of more massive galaxies . the precise redshift evolution predicted by this wavelike form of dark matter , termed @xmath80 dm by schive , chieuh @xmath81 broadhurst ( 2014 )",
    "will be very interesting to compare with the emerging hff data at high redshift with potentially profound implications for the nature of dark matter .",
    "by utilising cluster magnification the hff program provides unprecedentedly deep optical - nir imaging for detecting galaxies to higher redshifts and lower luminosities .",
    "the clusters chosen for this program are those established to have large sky areas of high magnification ( @xcite for the clusters a370 , macs1149 , a2744 , macs0416 respectively ) .",
    "to derive the physical properties of the distant galaxies detected it is of course essential that an accurate lens model can be constructed to reliably correct for the lens magnification over the field of view . in this paper",
    "we have demonstrated that our `` free - form '' lensing method , wslap+ , has significantly improved the ability to securely identify multiply lensed images in deep imaging data , allowing us to uncover 4 new systems with confidence and to identify errors in previous work based on the same hff data . typically even with the best hubble data a large proportion of faint arcs remain unmatched to counter - images , even with considerable modelling efforts .",
    "a significant part of this problem is the relative inflexibility of parameterised models .",
    "such models can only be partially appropriate at best for cluster mass distributions , particularly in the case of merging clusters where the complexities of tidal effects during encounters means the general mass distribution can not be expected to adhere to a sum of idealised elliptical , power - law mass halos usually adopted .",
    "this positional insecurity , and the increased quality of the new deep hff data has motivated our renewed examination of free - form modelling , augmented by the deflections from member galaxies .",
    "we simply combine a gaussian pixel grid for describing a smooth cluster component , together with small scale perturbations from the observed member galaxies .",
    "it is the combination of these high and low frequency components which we find provides meaningful solutions when searching for multiple images , as typically one or more counter - images in any set of multiply lensed images is locally perturbed or created by the presence of a member galaxy .",
    "we have tested our method previously with realistic simulations @xcite and we have applied it to the rich dataset of a1689 where we found 12 new multiple systems of images and improved the resolution of the recovered mass distribution @xcite .    this good agreement between photometric redshifts and geometric redshifts indicates a high degree of self - consistency , which other lens models of the same cluster have yet to demonstrate rigorously .",
    "the linearity enables us to estimate the redshifts of multiply lensed galaxies which were not used as constraints .",
    "this is illustrated in @xcite , in which our model excludes the possibility of the z=10 system being a low - redshift interloper .",
    "the free - form model - independence of our method can permit a joint constraint on the mass distribution and cosmology .",
    "the feasibility of this has been examined with simulations by @xcite , and now seems warranted by our improved observational precision achieved here .",
    "we have also examined the self - consistency of the model by comparing the predicted and observed brightnesses of the lensed images as shown in figure [ mag ] .",
    "we conclude from the precision and self - consistency of our lens model that we have constructed a reliable free - form lensing model of a2744 .",
    "it is apparent that this mass distribution is smooth in 2d , punctuated only by member galaxies , with no evidence of local perturbations that would otherwise imply over - constrained modelling .",
    "this model has allowed us to improve the reliability of multiply - lensed images with convincing identifications for 21 sets of multiply - lensed images , using the new deep nir imaging from the hff , combined with the existing optical / acs data from @xcite .",
    "our sample adds 4 new systems unknown prior to the hff program and , furthermore , we correct multiple errors in previous work based on the hff data .",
    "further improvements will come with the upcoming deeper optical data for reducing the ambiguity in identifying counter images amongst the many faint blue images lying at @xmath82 for a complete derivation of the redshift distribution .",
    "it will also be very interesting to examine the constraints we can impose on the mass profile of the bcg galaxy for which the pair of fortuitously long radial arcs of system 2 provide perhaps the best current constraints the mass profile of this interesting class of galaxy and may help in a better understanding of the origin of cd galaxies in relation to more normal cluster members .",

    "<S> hubble frontier fields ( hff ) imaging of the most powerful lensing clusters provides access to the most magnified distant galaxies . the challenge is to construct lens models capable of describing these complex massive , merging clusters so that individual lensed systems can be reliably identified and their intrinsic properties accurately derived . </S>",
    "<S> we apply the free - form lensing method ( wslap+ ) to a2744 , providing a model independent map of the cluster mass , magnification , and geometric distance estimates to multiply - lensed sources . </S>",
    "<S> we solve simultaneously for a smooth cluster component on a pixel grid , together with local deflections by the cluster member galaxies . combining model prediction with photometric redshift measurements , </S>",
    "<S> we correct and complete several systems recently claimed , and identify 4 new systems - totalling 65 images of 21 systems spanning a redshift range of 1.4@xmath09.8 . </S>",
    "<S> the reconstructed mass shows small enhancements in the directions where significant amounts of hot plasma can be seen in x - ray . </S>",
    "<S> we compare photometric redshifts with `` geometric redshifts '' , finding a high level of self - consistency . </S>",
    "<S> we find excellent agreement between predicted and observed fluxes - with a best - fit slope of 0.999@xmath10.013 and an rms of @xmath2 mag , demonstrating that our magnification correction of the lensed background galaxies is very reliable . </S>",
    "<S> intriguingly , few multiply - lensed galaxies are detected beyond @xmath3 , despite the high magnification and the limiting redshift of @xmath4 permitted by the hff filters . with the additional hff clusters we can better examine the plausibility of any pronounced high - z deficit , with potentially important implications for the reionization epoch and the nature of dark matter . </S>"
