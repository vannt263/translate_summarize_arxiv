    "elements up to the iron peak in the solar abundance distribution can be made in hydrostatic stellar burning processes , whereas heavier elements require extremer conditions , such as explosions resulting from thermonuclear burning or rapid ejection and decompression of gravitationally condensed and heated material .",
    "the former are connected to he - shell flashes in stars with less than 8 solar masses and to type ia supernovae , the latter are realized in core - collapse supernovae and neutron star mergers .",
    "although nuclear processes under explosive conditions  depending on the specific phenomenon  may also produce nuclei around and below the fe - ni region , heavier nuclides can not be produced in conditions encountered in hydrostatic burning . due to the different temperature and density ranges of explosive burning with respect to hydrostatic burning and due to the fact that heavier nuclei are involved , also different aspects of the nuclear processes have to be studied and the behavior of reaction sequences",
    "is often governed by different considerations than those for lighter nuclei .",
    "this is especially important for experimental studies which not only may encounter additional problems when studying heavy nuclei but also have to be adapted in order to extract the data actually important for constraining nucleosynthesis .",
    "nuclear theory also faces different challenges in heavy nuclei than in light ones and has to focus on the prediction of the actually relevant nuclear properties when applied to nucleosynthesis .",
    "finally , a 3-d hydrodynamical simulation of exploding dense matter not only probes the limits of our nuclear models but also is a considerable computational challenge . the combined astrophysical and nuclear uncertainties lead to generally less well constrained conditions for nucleosynthesis in such phenomena and thus to considerable leeway in the interpretation and consolidation of astrophysical models .",
    "in this section , i want to highlight the special considerations that apply to the nuclear aspects of nucleosynthesis of intermediate and heavy nuclei . some of the connected astrophysical uncertainties will be summarized in later sections .",
    "the connection between the astrophysical and the nuclear physics aspects of nucleosynthesis , in general , is made in the stellar reaction rate @xmath4 , which for any reaction @xmath5 is derived from the product of effective reaction area @xmath6 and the flux of incoming projectiles @xmath7 , where @xmath8 , @xmath9 are the number densities of target nuclei and projectile nuclei , respectively , in the stellar plasma with temperature @xmath10 , and @xmath11 is the relative velocity between the reaction partners @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the stellar reaction cross section @xmath14 also depends on @xmath10 because of the possible presence of nuclei in excited states  and not only in the ground state ( g.s . )  due to thermal excitation in the plasma .",
    "the implications of this will be discussed in later sections . to obtain the number of reactions per volume and per second , an integration over all relative velocities has to be performed , where the probability to find particles at a velocity @xmath15 is given by the maxwell - boltzmann distribution ( mbd ) @xmath16 and thus @xmath17 using center - of - mass ( c.m . )",
    "coordinates , with @xmath18 being the reduced mass , and inserting the mbd explicitly , this can also be rewritten as integration over the c.m .",
    "energy @xmath19 when realizing that @xmath20 and @xmath21 , @xmath22 which allows to use the more common form of an energy - dependent reaction cross section @xmath23 ( see also eqs .  [ eq : effcs ] , [ eq : stellcs]).@xcite instead of number densities @xmath24 , astrophysical investigations often use abundances @xmath25 , which implicitly contain the plasma matter density @xmath26 and avogadro s number @xmath27 .    in explosive burning",
    ", however , it is not always necessary to determine @xmath4 at all temperatures . as introduced above",
    ", explosive burning involves high temperatures and sometimes also high densities .",
    "typical temperatures and densities depend on the actual site and process but relevant temperatures , at which reaction rates have to be known , do not exceed 3.5 gk because forward and reverse rates are in equilibrium when the plasma is hotter .",
    "this means that the timescales for both forward and reverse reaction are short enough compared to the process timescale ( the time during which temperature and density remain at values allowing the reactions to significantly modify the abundances ) to permit the abundances of all involved nuclei to reach their equilibrium values , given by @xcite @xmath28 for a reaction @xmath29 and @xmath30 for a reaction @xmath31 ( see also eq .",
    "[ eq : revphoto ] ) , where @xmath32 are the g.s .",
    "spin factors , @xmath33 the normalized partition functions for a nuclide @xmath34 , and @xmath35 the reaction @xmath36 value when starting with @xmath37 . note that this does not imply that the abundances remain constant , they still depend on temperature @xmath10 which may vary with time as well as on @xmath38 and @xmath39 , which also depend on the plasma density @xmath26 .",
    "the fact that individual rates do not appear anymore implies that the rates have only to be determined up to about 3.5 gk while the reaction @xmath36 values ( derived from nuclear masses ) determine abundances at higher temperature .",
    "it should further be noted that not all reactions may be in equilibrium for given conditions .",
    "if all reactions were in equilibrium , this would lead to full _ nuclear statistical equilibrium _ for which all abundances can be computed from coupled equations without the use of rates.@xcite on the other hand , any subset of reactions may be in equilibrium ( e.g. , neutron or proton captures and their reverse reactions ) and the above equations can then be used to calculate the abundances affected by these reactions ( which will be the fastest reactions occuring and thus be dominating ) .    the lower temperature limit is not defined as clearly as it depends much more on reaction cross sections , process duration , and the temperature and density profiles obtained in the astrophysical models . generally , charged particle reactions freeze out at higher temperatures than reactions with neutrons due to the coulomb barrier and are mostly too slow to change abundances considerably at @xmath40 gk .",
    "equilibrium considerations limit the temperature range in which astrophysical rates have to be known . since the relevant energy window is determined by the energies giving non - negligible contributions to the integral in eq .",
    "[ eq : stellrate ] for a chosen temperature @xmath10 , the thermal energies of the interacting nuclei are low by nuclear physics standards .",
    "these energies are below 10 mev for charged particles and up to a few 100 kev for reactions with neutrons.@xcite especially for charged particle reactions on trans - iron nuclei , this implies tiny reaction cross sections which pose a significant challenges to their experimental determination .      of great importance in the nucleosynthesis of trans - iron nuclides is the fact that heavier nuclei have a higher nuclear level density ( ld ) and thus smaller level spacing than light species .",
    "this intrinsic ld is important in three ways .",
    "firstly , the ld at the formation energy of the compound nucleus ( which is the sum of incident projectile energy and separation energy of the projectile in the compound nucleus , @xmath41 ) determines the dominant reaction mechanism . in the absence of levels to be populated close to the given energy ,",
    "_ direct reactions _ to low - lying final states dominate the reaction cross section.@xcite when there is a small number of well separated excited states close to @xmath42 in the compound nucleus @xmath37 , this gives rise to resonances in the reaction cross sections , which can be described by the breit - wigner formula or by the r - matrix method.@xcite the challenge therein is to determine the properties of the resonances contributing to the reaction rate integral in eq .",
    "( [ eq : stellrate]).@xcite it is experimentally challenging to perform the required measurements for unstable nuclei and/or at low energy and theoretical _ ab initio _ methods can not be applied to heavy nuclei , yet .",
    "an extreme case of resonant reactions appears when the ld is high , leading to a large number of unresolved resonances which can be described by averaged resonance parameters .",
    "this is called the hauser - feshbach approach.@xcite the vast majority of reactions in nucleosynthesis of intermediate and heavy nuclei can be described in this model.@xcite despite of the increased number of nuclear transitions to be included in the model , this facilitates the predictions somewhat , as averaged quantities can be used .",
    "calculations of reaction rates from smooth hauser - feshbach cross sections are also somewhat more `` forgiving '' to fluctuations around the `` true '' cross section value because of the integration over the projectile energy distribution ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : stellrate ] ) .",
    "different quantities , though , have to be known as input to the calculations than for direct or resonant reactions , such as optical potentials ( related to the effective interaction in a many - nucleon system ) and level densities ( but not , e.g. , spectroscopic factors of isolated levels).@xcite exceptions are reactions with very low or negative @xmath43 because then @xmath42 is shifted to very low excitation energies at which the ld may be too low to apply the hauser - feshbach model even for heavier nuclei .",
    "typically this occurs close to the driplines . due to the lower ld at magic nucleon numbers ,",
    "the hauser - feshbach model may not be applicable for magic target nuclei and low plasma temperatures .",
    "this applies mainly for neutron captures , however , because the projectile energy range relevant for the calculation of the reaction rate is shifted to higher compound excitation energies when there are charged particles in entrance or exit channel.@xcite    the second consequence of a high ld is the availability of a larger number of states at low excitation energy which can be thermally populated in the stellar plasma .",
    "temperatures in explosive burning are higher than in hydrostatic burning and forming nuclei at higher excitation energies . combining the higher ld with higher @xmath10 has the consequence that the calculation of the _ stellar _ rate includes a larger number of reactions on excited states of the target nucleus than would be the case for lighter nuclei , for which excited state contributions are often negligible .",
    "in fact , most reactions in trans - iron nucleosynthesis processes require to include more nuclear transitions in the calculation of reaction rates than just the ones originating from the g.s .  of the target nucleus .",
    "the contribution of the rate @xmath44 obtained for a state @xmath45 with spin @xmath46 and excitation energy @xmath47 to the stellar rate @xmath4 can be quantified as @xcite @xmath48 the statistical weights @xmath49 are given by @xcite @xmath50 the reaction cross section @xmath51 of state @xmath45 is defined as @xmath52 and the effective cross section as @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the partial cross section from target level @xmath45 to final level @xmath55 ( cross sections at zero or negative energies are zero).@xcite the modified weights @xmath56 are specified in eq .",
    "( [ eq : new ] ) . for the g.s . , eq .",
    "( [ eq : xfactor ] ) simplifies to @xcite @xmath57 it is very important to note that this is different from the simple ratio @xmath58 of g.s .  and stellar rates , respectively.@xcite ( the ratio @xmath59 is called the _ stellar enhancement factor _ and in the past was mistakenly assumed to quantify the excited state contributions . ) using the above equation , the total excited state contribution @xmath60 can be defined , using a sum over discrete excited states and an integration over a ld @xmath61 above the last included excited state at energy @xmath62 , with generalized @xmath63 depending on excitation energy @xmath64 , spin @xmath65 and parity @xmath66 , analogous to eq .",
    "( [ eq : xfactor ] ) . in light nuclei , where the energy of the first excited state is larger than @xmath67 , @xmath68 and thus @xmath69 .",
    "then @xmath70 .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath71 and @xmath72 for heavy nuclei already at low plasma temperatures . a straightforward measurement of a reaction with the target nucleus being in the g.s .",
    "will therefore only constrain a small fraction of the stellar rate .",
    "even when experimentally determining several transitions , one has to be aware that many more transitions contribute to rates involving heavier nuclei than for light nuclides .",
    "this is especially pronounced for charged particle reactions but it was shown that already neutron capture rates on nuclei in the rare - earth region exhibit sizeable excited state contributions even at @xmath73 kev.@xcite    finally , a high ld alters the determination of resonance widths for resonant reactions and averaged widths in the hauser - feshbach model . in light nuclei , only few nuclear transitions @xmath74 between a small number of states determine the reaction cross sections . even when the cross sections can not be measured directly , often indirect methods allow to determine the few dominating transitions and thus to derive the cross sections and rates .",
    "the situation is different for nuclei with high ld , as many more transitions contribute .",
    "thus , resonance widths comprising all these transitions have to be measured or calculated .",
    "the utility of indirect methods or of studying reverse reactions is much smaller .",
    "for example , ( d , p ) and ( d , n ) reactions frequently used to study neutron and proton states , respectively , and their spectroscopic factors in light nuclei are of limited use here , as the number of levels at @xmath42 is too large when the hauser - feshbach model is applicable .",
    "also , the ( d , p ) and ( d , n ) cross sections themselves do not provide further information on the astrophysical rates unless they are applied to systems with low ld , for which the direct reaction mechanism dominates .",
    "they can be used , however , to identify low - lying isolated states which are of significance in the calculation of particle widths .",
    "similarly , coulomb dissociation is a helpful tool in studying light nuclei and can also be applied at radioactive ion beam facilities@xcite but for heavier nuclei only a small subset of the relevant transitions can be accessed by this method .",
    "the utility of indirect methods to study rates involving heavier nuclei is further decreased by the larger excited state contributions @xmath75 to the stellar rate , implying even more contributing transitions , as discussed above . on the other hand ,",
    "theoretical predictions are simpler for averaged quantities entering the prediction of widths , such as the compound nucleus ld in the calculation of @xmath2 widths , and do not require _ ab initio _ models but only effective theories .",
    "since systems with high ld exhibit different dependences of the cross sections on nuclear properties , an important quantity to consider is the sensitivity @xmath0 of cross sections or rates @xmath76 to a change in an input quantity @xmath77 , @xcite @xmath78 it is a measure of a change by a factor of @xmath79 in @xmath76 as the result of a change in the quantity @xmath77 by the factor @xmath80 , with @xmath81 when no change occurs and @xmath82 when the final result changes by the same factor as used in the variation of @xmath77 , i.e. , @xmath82 implies @xmath83 .",
    "this is equivalent to writing @xmath84 with @xmath85 and @xmath86 , as used in standard sensitivity analysis .    comparing the sensitivities of laboratory cross sections ( for nuclei in their g.s . ) and stellar reaction rates allows an improved judgement of the utility of a given experiment to constrain the rate or some relevant input.@xcite since @xmath0 is strongly energy dependent , a measurement outside the energy range mainly contributing to the rate may not provide the desired , astrophysically relevant information .",
    "different sensitivities of laboratory cross sections and rates also reflect the contribution of reactions on excited states to the stellar rate .",
    "such reactions on excited states proceed at smaller relative energy and thus have a different sensitivity than those on the g.s .  of a nucleus . in this context",
    "it should be noted that most determinations of relevant energies at which cross sections contribute significantly to the reaction rate , the _ gamow window _ , only provide them for the g.s .",
    "cross sections @xmath87 but when @xmath71 the relevant energies are much lower for the excited state contributions dominating the rate .",
    "the sensitivity @xmath0 is also central to the assessment of the remaining uncertainties in a rate after the inclusion of experimental data .",
    "this will be further discussed in section [ sec : sproc ] below .",
    "in order to determine the actual rate uncertainties it is important to not only know the experimental error ( or uncertainty factor ) but also to have an initial estimate of the theoretical uncertainty involved . would we know the uncertainty in the prediction of , say , the averaged widths , the sensitivities defined above could be directly used to determine the resulting uncertainty in the stellar rate ( or reaction cross section ) .",
    "unfortunately , this poses a fundamental problem because theoretical uncertainties are fundamentally different from experimental errors , at least when talking about statistical errors in data .",
    "several factors contribute to the theoretical uncertainty .",
    "first , an appropriate model has to be chosen , for example , by choosing which reaction mechanism to treat and in which way .",
    "obviously , it is _ a priori _ impossible to exactly determine the correctness of a model without being able to falsify it through comparison with data .",
    "this impossibility poses the fundamental problem of quantifying uncertainties of the theory approach.@xcite it is loosely related to systematic errors in experiments due to instruments and external effects , which are also hard to estimate . assuming that a `` correct '' model is used",
    ", the next step in the uncertainty analysis would be to check the reliability of the input required to perform calculations with the model",
    ". some of the input may be data bearing some measurement error .",
    "it is possible to propagate this error into the final model output , either analytically or , more likely , by variation studies , for example by a monte carlo variation of such input values within their errors .",
    "part of the input , however , may again be in the form of a model ( e.g. , the ld or an energy - dependent @xmath2-strength function ) . in this case",
    "the initial problem of determining the correctness of a model returns .",
    "even when several choices for model descriptions of a quantity are available , the uncertainty can not be determined by switching from one description to the other and observing the change in the result because this can not be considered drawing a random sample from a statistically distributed set .",
    "the different treatments may even yield similar results at one energy but vastly differ at another . without further knowledge of the underlying model assumptions it is even impossible to sensibly compare different approaches .",
    "therefore it is fundamentally impossible to specify an error bar for a model , especially not a statistically distributed one .",
    "theory uncertainties have to be estimated in comparison to available data but can not be as strictly defined as statistical errors in experimental data .",
    "it is in this sense that the term `` theory uncertainty '' is used below .",
    "monte carlo variation of input can therefore only determine part of the full uncertainty , specifically the uncertainty stemming from input data ( including natural constants ) .",
    "in addition to uncertainty analysis , the sensitivity can also be used to directly infer the impact of a ( experimentally or theoretically ) newly determined quantity @xmath77 ( for example , an averaged width in a hauser - feshbach calculation ) on the cross section or reaction rate . with @xmath88 being the previous value of the cross section or rate of interest , the new value @xmath89 is simply given by @xmath90 when @xmath91 is the factor by which the newly determined @xmath77 differs from its previous value used to calculate @xmath88 .",
    "in the following i want to discuss relevant nuclear and astrophysical uncertainties in selected nucleosynthesis scenarios .",
    "the list of topics and challenges is not exhaustive but rather is supposed to provide examples which enable the reader to generalize and apply the considerations when dealing with further details and other nucleosynthesis processes .",
    "the astrophysical slow neutron - capture process ( @xmath0 process ) produces about half of the elemental abundances between fe and bi.@xcite the @xmath0 process is attributed to environments of neutron number densities @xmath92 of typically @xmath93 @xmath94.@xcite when an unstable nucleus is produced by neutron capture , @xmath95 decays are usually faster than subsequent neutron captures , so the reaction path follows the valley of stability .",
    "the @xmath0 process takes place in different stellar sites .",
    "in particular , the @xmath0-process abundances in the solar system are made by contributions from different generations of stars , providing three different @xmath0-process components , a main , a weak and a strong component.@xcite    the main component dominates the @xmath0 contributions to the region between zr and pb .",
    "it is mainly associated with thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars of @xmath96 @xmath97 with an initial composition close to solar.@xcite during the agb phase , he burning takes place in a shell surrounding the c / o core of the star .",
    "thermal pulses are caused by he - shell flashes which occur because he burning can not sustain hydrostatic equilibrium within a thin shell . as a consequence of the mixing processes during the thermonuclear flashes , protons can be mixed downwards from the h - shell into the he - shell where they are used to produce @xmath98c from @xmath99c via @xmath100n in the interpulse phase .",
    "the he - shell contracts and heats up before igniting another he - shell flash .",
    "this allows neutrons to be released through @xmath98c(@xmath101,n ) before and in such a shell flash.@xcite during the temperature peak neutrons are further released in @xmath102ne(@xmath101,n ) reactions .",
    "the strong component also originates in agb stars but old ones , with metallicities much lower than solar.@xcite it is responsible for about half of the solar @xmath103pb abundance and for the @xmath0-process abundance of bi .",
    "the astrophysical challenge in the investigation of the @xmath0 process in agb stars is in the detailed modelling of the downmixing of protons from the h - shell into the he - shell and the formation of a @xmath98c `` pocket '' .",
    "the convection and mixing can only be understood as a 3d effect but a fully 3d stellar model including nucleosynthesis is computationally not yet feasible .",
    "therefore all agb @xmath0-process nucleosynthesis models include _ ad hoc _ assumptions and phenomenological parameters describing the @xmath98c pocket and it is not clear how these evolve for stars with different masses and compositions .",
    "the weak @xmath0 process takes place in massive stars ( with more than 8 @xmath97 ) which later explode as a core - collapse supernova , and is producing most of the @xmath0 abundances in the mass region between fe and zr.@xcite in these stars , neutrons are mostly produced at the end of core he - burning and during the later convective c - shell burning phase via @xmath102ne(@xmath101,n ) .",
    "typical neutron energies are @xmath104 and 0.03 mev for interpulse and flash burning and around 0.09 mev in massive stars .",
    "( note that the relevant plasma temperature in gk ( @xmath105 ) is then given by @xmath106 when @xmath67 is in mev . )    on the nuclear physics side , the challenges lie in the accurate determination of the neutron producing and consuming rates . in the last decades",
    ", considerable effort has been put into the measurement of precise and accurate neutron capture cross sections at @xmath0-process energies.@xcite it has been understood that the uncertainties in the present neutron capture rates are dominated by the experimental errors which are currently below 5% for most @xmath0-process captures.@xcite recently it has been shown , however , that even at the comparatively low @xmath0-process temperatures excited state contributions @xmath75 are not negligible , especially for deformed nuclei.@xcite this leads to larger remaining uncertainties because the laboratory cross section only constrains a fraction of the stellar rate .",
    "the situation is even worse when the experimental `` rate '' is inferred not from neutron capture but its reverse reaction , ( @xmath2,n ) .",
    "ground - state contributions @xmath107 are @xmath108 orders of magnitude smaller in ( @xmath2,n ) rates than in ( n,@xmath2 ) ones at the same temperature .",
    "this will be further discussed in section [ sec : gamma ] .    here , we take a look at an important example in the @xmath0 process , @xmath109w(n,@xmath2 ) .",
    "the nucleus @xmath109w is unstable and the location of a branching in the @xmath0-process path where neutron capture and @xmath95 decay are competing .",
    "the current version of the neutron capture compilation for the @xmath0 process ( kadonis , v0.3 ) recommends an experimental value with a 9% error at @xmath110 kev.@xcite even when assuming that the uncertainties in the predictions of the transitions originating on the g.s .  and",

    "even a sizeable theory uncertainty of a factor of 2 or more would be almost completely removed .",
    "a closer inspection of the source of the quoted rate , however , reveals that the recommended value is obtained by averaging the rates given by two photodisintegration experiments@xcite , measuring @xmath119w(@xmath2,n)@xmath109w cross sections .",

    "this implies that a variation of the neutron density or the ( n , p ) rate on these waiting points will mostly affect how fast nuclei with larger @xmath172 can be reached within the timescale given by the expansion .",
    "another nuclear - structure determined feature can be seen immediately in figs .",
    "[ fig : equiabuns ] and [ fig : flux ] : while the waiting points follow the @xmath177 line up to mo , they are extending further and further to neutron - richer isotopes between mo and sn , pushing the path gradually away from the @xmath177 line .",
    "the path is pushed strongly towards stability at the sn isotopes and above , providing a strong barrier for the efficient production of any elements beyond sn .",
    "two effects are acting here : the location of the waiting - points at neutron - richer nuclides with longer lifetimes with respect to both decays and ( n , p ) reactions , and the fact that also the proton captures become slower due to the higher coulomb barriers at larger @xmath172 .",
    "the latter leads to a dominance of ( n,@xmath2 ) reactions over ( p,@xmath2 ) and ( @xmath2,p ) as can be seen in figs .",
    "[ fig : equiabuns ] and [ fig : flux ] at high @xmath172 , and especially in fig .",
    "[ fig : lateflux ] showing the situation at late times .",
    "the neutron captures push the nucleosynthesis strongly towards stability and even beyond and prevent the production of appreciable amounts of matter above the sn region .",
    "the above general conclusions hold for any trajectory yielding an appreciable @xmath175p - process .",
    "moreover , the range of conditions permitting such a process are also set by nuclear properties . without neutrons ,",
    "the waiting points can not not be passed but a large neutron density ( caused , e.g. , by a higher @xmath167 flux ) would make the ( n , p ) reactions faster than ( p,@xmath2 ) on _ any _ proton - rich nuclide above @xmath168ni .",
    "on the other hand , too high a temperature prevents the outbreak from the @xmath168ni seed as ( @xmath2,p ) and ( @xmath2,@xmath101 ) reactions are faster than proton captures and always establish qse with @xmath168ni .",
    "finally , in a freeze - out charged - particle captures are suppressed according to the coulomb barriers and a further increase in @xmath172 is more and more hampered .",
    "the exact values determining the window of favorable conditions can thus be estimated from nuclear properties in the spirit of the classical b@xmath178fh paper.@xcite the astrophysical hydrodynamics just determines how long the ejected matter is subjected to those favorable conditions and thus how far up in @xmath172 and @xmath173 @xmath175p nucleosynthesis can proceed .",
    "the uncertainties in the astrophysical conditions are similar to those for the @xmath1 process in ccsn ( sec .",
    "[ sec : rproc ] ) because they stem from the same problems in the supernova modelling .",
    "the explosion mechanism and the neutrino interactions not only determine how much matter is ejected at high entropy from the innermost layers and the ejection speed but also influence the time evolution of the neutron - to - proton ratio .",
    "the details of the hydrodynamics also determine the wind termination when the supersonic inner layers run into the slower outer layers of the exploding star and abruptly decelerate.@xcite    another possible problem concerning the @xmath166 and @xmath167 spectra close above the neutrino spheres was pointed out recently.@xcite the difference in mean field potentials between neutrons and protons was incompletely considered in previous studies . including an improved treatment seems to render the ejected layers less proton - rich .",
    "the actual impact on the @xmath3 process is pending consistent nucleosynthesis studies . even when using the improved mean field effects",
    ", however , the remaining hydrodynamical uncertainties may be too large to arrive at a definitive conclusion regarding the significance of the @xmath3 process .    on the nuclear reaction side ,",
    "the results are mostly insensitive to proton captures due to the prevailing ( p,@xmath2)-(@xmath2,p ) equilibrium . only at late freeze - out times",
    ", this equilibrium is left and gives rise to some sensitivity to a variation of rates.@xcite the equilibrium abundances , in turn , are determined by the proton separation energies @xmath179 and thus by nuclear masses . in figs .",
    "[ fig : equiabuns][fig : lateflux ] circles mark nuclei where remaining experimental uncertainties in the @xmath36 values ( mass differences ) affect the @xmath175p - process results .",
    "it should be noted that the waiting points at lowest @xmath179 within an isotonic chain are somewhat different from waiting points in the @xmath165 process .",
    "the proton number density is much lower in the @xmath3 process than in the @xmath165 process and therefore there are no cases of uncertain waiting points which may be overcome by proton captures when the masses are changed within uncertainties .",
    "therefore also @xmath170ge still is a waiting point , although it is not anymore in the @xmath165 process after a recent mass measurement.@xcite changing the masses of the nuclei marked in the figures , nevertheless , affects the abundance pattern along the @xmath3 path which is obtained after decay to stability and may also impact up to which mass significant abundances can be created .",
    "another difference to @xmath165 waiting points is the fact that ( n , p ) reactions are much faster than @xmath95-decays and electron captures and therefore there is no actual `` waiting '' in the reaction flow , contrary to @xmath165- and @xmath1 process waiting points .    the flow to heavier nuclei is determined by ( n , p ) reactions on the waiting point nuclei ( figs .  [",

    "[ fig : lateflux ] ) .",
    "because of the large @xmath132 of proton - rich , unstable nuclei , ( n , p ) reaction @xmath36 values are large and thus @xmath42 is large and the hauser - feshbach model will be applicable . as pointed out in sec .",
    "[ sec : nld ] , this is bad news for experiments probing direct transitions or relying on the fact that only few transitions contribute . on the other hand , even though the hauser - feshbach model is well established , its input has to be determined reliably , especially for the cases where it predicts competitions between rates . in figs .",
    "[ fig : equiabuns][fig : lateflux ] diamonds mark targets for which ( p,@xmath2 ) , ( n , p ) , or ( n,@xmath2 ) rates are close and theoretical uncertainties in the predicted rates may be important .",

    "would be considerably impeded were these reactions dominating because the reaction cycles shown in figs .",

    "[ fig : breakout1 ] where @xmath181zn(@xmath2,@xmath101 ) has become slow but there still would be a cycle caused by the reaction @xmath181zn(p,@xmath101)@xmath183cu . to know whether this cycle occurs , the relative strengths of @xmath181zn(p,@xmath101 ) , @xmath181zn(n,@xmath2 ) , @xmath181zn(n , p ) , @xmath181zn(n,@xmath101 ) have to be known . in the current rate",

    "since a ( p,@xmath101 ) reaction is competing with neutron - induced reactions in this possible zn cycle , one might wonder whether an increase in @xmath187 would also help to avoid the cycle .",
    "this can only be achieved by a larger @xmath188 because a simple scaling of the density @xmath26 equally affects the ( p,@xmath101 ) reaction .",
    "there are two problems with this , however .",
    "firstly , both ( n,@xmath2 ) and ( n,@xmath101 ) would be increased and the competiton between these reactions within their uncertainties would not be lifted . secondly , to make the neutron - induced reactions faster than ( p,@xmath101 ) , the @xmath188 has to be increased so much that ( n,@xmath101 ) or ( n , p ) reactions become faster than ( p,@xmath2 ) for all nuclei in the subsequent isotonic chains , thereby dissolving the ( p,@xmath2)-(@xmath2,p ) equilibrium and pushing nucleosynthesis towards stability without the possibility to further move up in @xmath172 .",
    "nevertheless , if @xmath188 were increased moderately , this avoided a dominating ( p,@xmath101 ) reaction but required some fine - tuning .    in the second example",
    ", a cycle would form at ge if the reaction @xmath184ge(n,@xmath101)@xmath185zn was dominating , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : breakout2 ] . using the current rate set ,",
    "the reaction @xmath184ge(n,@xmath101)@xmath185zn is found to be in strong competition with @xmath184ge(n,@xmath2 ) but a re - evaluation of the reaction rates may change this picture .",
    "this cycle would be robust with respect to changes in @xmath188 .",
    "another cycle , close to @xmath168ni and acting down to @xmath189 gk was previously found:@xcite the reaction @xmath183cu(p,@xmath101)@xmath168ni cycles matter back to @xmath168ni .",
    "this cycle is also affected by possible competitions with other reactions . this nicely illustrates the uncertainties in @xmath3 nucleosynthesis due to reaction rates and underlines the importance of studying competing reactions . to better constrain the efficiency of the @xmath3 process from the nuclear physics side",
    ", it is necessary to establish tight bounds on the relative strengths of the strongly competing ( p,@xmath2 ) , ( p,@xmath101 ) , ( n,@xmath2 ) , ( n , p ) , and ( n,@xmath101 ) reactions on targets from ni to ge and with @xmath190 .",
    "these conclusions concerning the important rate competitions do not strongly depend on the chosen trajectory .",
    "the ratio of proton- to neutron - induced rates is independent of density changes .",
    "modifying the density at a given temperature affects the ratio of particle - induced to photodisintegration reactions and thus leads to altered break - out temperatures from @xmath168ni or from ( p,@xmath2)-(@xmath2,p ) equilibrium . since the temperature dependence of the reactivities , however , is exponential and the density dependence only linear , the break - out temperatures are shifted only slightly .",
    "the same is true when varying @xmath191 alone .",
    "due to the densities encountered in the ejected layers , @xmath192 always stays well below the values of an @xmath165 process , where ( p,@xmath2 ) would dominate .",
    "moreover , a realistic range of entropies in ejected proton - rich layers implies only a narrow range of temperatures at a given density .",
    "the only strong astrophysical dependence is on @xmath188 created by the @xmath167 flux present at a given temperature .",
    "however , this does not change the ratio between ( n,@xmath2 ) , ( n ,",

    "as pointed out above , there is not much room for modification of @xmath188 without destroying the possibility for @xmath3 nucleosynthesis .",
    "a low @xmath188 prevents @xmath3 processing because of slow ( n , p ) and ( n,@xmath2 ) reactions but a much higher @xmath188 also does not help the break - out as discussed above .    nevertheless ,",
    "although the rate competitions are robust with respect to changes in the hydrodynamic evolution , the impact of , for example , cycles as discussed above depends on the trajectory .",
    "the time evolution of the conditions within a trajectory determines how long the favorable conditions for a cycle ( if existing ) are upheld .",
    "if the relevant temperature - density-@xmath188 regime for a possible cycle is crossed quickly whereas the later evolution proceeds slower , leaving enough time for further @xmath3 processing , then the relevance of the cycle is diminished .",
    "for example , although the cycle formed by the @xmath183cu(p,@xmath101)@xmath168ni reaction is appearing at a given temperature , it has only moderate impact on the final abundances when chosing a regular freeze - out without significant wind termination shock .",
    "using a trajectory in which the wind termination shock keeps the temperature at slightly above 3 gk for an extended time will yield a large impact , however.@xcite    in conclusion , although the astrophysical constraints seem to be similarly weak for the @xmath3 process as for the @xmath1 process , it is better constrained by nuclear physics and exhibits smaller uncertainties therein , at least in the dominating rates .",
