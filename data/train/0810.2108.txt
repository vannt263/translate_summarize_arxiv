    "an old problem in classical mechanics is the existence and the number of periodic orbits of a mechanical system .",
    "as it is well known , there are two dual formulations of classical mechanics , namely the lagrangian one and the hamiltonian one .",
    "if a system is constrained on a manifold , say @xmath0 , then it is described by a ( possibly time - dependent ) lagrangian defined on the tangent bundle of @xmath0 or , dually , by a hamiltonian defined on the cotangent bundle of @xmath0 .",
    "a classical assumption is that a lagrangian function @xmath1 is tonelli with global flow .",
    "this means that @xmath2 has fiberwise superlinear growth , positive definite fiberwise hessian , and every maximal integral curve of its associated euler - lagrange vector field has all of @xmath3 as its domain of definition .",
    "the tonelli class is particularly important in lagrangian dynamics : in fact , whenever a lagrangian function is fiberwise convex , its legendre transform defines a diffeomorphism between the tangent and cotangent bundles of the configuration space if and only if the lagrangian function belongs to the tonelli class . in other words ,",
    "the tonelli lagrangians constitute the broadest family of fiberwise convex lagrangian functions for which the lagrangian - hamiltonian duality , given by the legendre transform , occurs .",
    "furthermore , the tonelli assumptions imply existence and regularity results for action minimizing orbits joining two given points on the configuration space . for a comprehensive reference on tonelli lagrangians",
    ", we refer the reader to the forthcoming book by fathi @xcite .",
    "the problem of the existence of infinitely many periodic orbits , for hamiltonian systems on the cotangent bundle of closed manifolds , is a non - compact version of the celebrated conley conjecture @xcite , which goes back to the eighties . in its original form ,",
    "the conjecture states that every hamiltonian diffeomorphism on the standard symplectic torus @xmath4 has infinitely many periodic points . under a non - degeneracy assumption on the periodic orbits ,",
    "the conjecture was soon confirmed by conley and zehnder @xcite , and then extended to aspherical closed symplectic manifolds in 1992 by salamon and zehnder @xcite .",
    "the full conjecture was established in 2004 by hingston @xcite for the torus case , and in 2006 by ginzburg @xcite for the aspherical closed case .",
    "other related results are contained in @xcite .    in the lagrangian formulation ,",
    "the periodic orbits are extremal points of the lagrangian action functional , and several sophisticated methods from morse theory may be applied in order to assert their existence . however",
    ", these methods only work for classes of lagrangians that are significantly smaller than the tonelli one . along this line , in 2000 long @xcite proved the existence of infinitely many periodic orbits for lagrangian systems associated to fiberwise quadratic lagrangians on the torus @xmath5 .",
    "more precisely , he proved the result for @xmath6 lagrangian functions @xmath7 of the form @xmath8 where @xmath9 takes values in the space of positive definite symmetric matrices , @xmath10 is the standard flat riemannian metric on @xmath5 and @xmath11 is a @xmath6 function .",
    "recently , lu @xcite extended long s proof in many directions , in particular to the case of a general closed configuration space .",
    "other related results concerning autonomous lagrangian systems are contained in @xcite .    in 2007 ,",
    "abbondandolo and figalli @xcite showed how to apply some techniques from critical point theory in the tonelli setting .",
    "they proved that , on each closed configuration space with finite fundamental group , every lagrangian system associated to a 1-periodic tonelli lagrangian with global flow admits an infinite sequence of 1-periodic solutions with diverging action . in this paper , inspired by their work and by long s one ,",
    "we address the problem of the existence of infinitely many periodic solutions of a 1-periodic tonelli lagrangian system on a general closed configuration space .",
    "our main result is the following .",
    "[ t : conley ] let @xmath0 be a smooth closed manifold , @xmath12 a smooth 1-periodic tonelli lagrangian with global flow and @xmath13 a constant greater than @xmath14 assume that only finitely many contractible 1-periodic solutions of the euler - lagrange system of @xmath2 have action less than @xmath15 .",
    "then , for each prime @xmath16 , the euler - lagrange system of @xmath2 admits infinitely many contractible periodic solutions with period that is a power of @xmath17 and mean action less than @xmath15 .",
    "here it is worthwhile to point out that the infinitely many periodic orbits that we find are geometrically distinct in the phase - space @xmath18 of our system , and the mean action of an orbit is defined as the usual lagrangian action divided by the period of the orbit .",
    "theorem  [ t : conley ] can be equivalently stated in the hamiltonian formulation .",
    "in fact , it is well known that the legendre duality sets up a one - to - one correspondence @xmath19 where two correspondent functions @xmath2 and @xmath20 satisfy the fenchel relations @xmath21 here , the definition of tonelli hamiltonian is the cotangent bundle analogue of the one of tonelli lagrangian : the hamiltonian @xmath22 is tonelli when it has fiberwise superlinear growth and positive definite fiberwise hessian .",
    "the legendre duality also sets up a one - to - one correspondence between the ( contractible ) integer - periodic solutions of the euler - lagrange system of @xmath2 and the ( contractible ) integer - periodic orbits of the hamilton system of the dual @xmath20",
    ". therefore theorem  [ t : conley ] can be translated into the following .",

    "a hamiltonian curve @xmath29 is @xmath30-periodic , for some integer @xmath30 , if and only if its starting point @xmath31 is a @xmath30-periodic point of the hamiltonian diffeomorphism @xmath32 , i.e. @xmath33 therefore , theorem  [ t : conleytonham ] readily implies the conley conjecture for tonelli hamiltonian systems on the cotangent bundle of a closed manifold .",
    "[ c : conleyton ] let @xmath0 be a smooth closed manifold and @xmath22 a 1-periodic tonelli hamiltonian with global flow @xmath25 .",
    "then the hamiltonian diffeomorphism @xmath34 has infinitely many periodic points .",
    "@xmath35    we shall prove theorem  [ t : conley ] by a morse theoretic argument , inspired by a work of long @xcite .",
    "the rough idea is the following : assuming by contradiction that the euler - lagrange system of a tonelli lagrangian @xmath2 admits only finitely many integer periodic solutions as in the statement , then it is possible to find a solution whose local homology persists under iteration , in contradiction with a homological vanishing property ( analog to the one proved by bangert and klingenberg @xcite for the geodesics action functional ) .    under the tonelli assumptions we need to deal with several problems while carrying out the above scheme of the proof .",
    "these problems are mainly due to the fact that a functional setting in which the tonelli action functional is both regular ( say @xmath36 ) and satisfies the palais - smale condition , the minimum requirements to perform morse theory , is not known . to deal with these lacks",
    ", we apply the machinery of convex quadratic modifications introduced by abbondandolo and figalli @xcite : the idea consists in modifying the involved tonelli lagrangian outside a sufficiently big neighborhood of the zero section of @xmath37 , making it fiberwise quadratic there .",
    "if we fix a period @xmath38 and an action bound , a suitable a priori estimate on the @xmath30-periodic orbits with bounded action allows to prove that these orbits must lie in the region where the lagrangian is not modified .",
    "some work is needed in order to apply this argument in our proof , since the mentioned a priori estimate holds only in a fixed period @xmath30 , while we look for orbits with arbitrarily high period .    moreover , we have to deal with some regularity issues in applying the machinery of critical point theory to the action functionals of the modified lagrangians .",
    "in fact , the natural ambient to perform morse theory with these functionals is the @xmath39 loop space , over which they are @xmath36 and satisfy the palais - smale condition .",
    "however , all the arguments that involve the morse lemma ( such as the vanishing of the local homology groups in certain degrees ) are valid only for @xmath40 functionals .",
    "we will show that these arguments are still valid , developing an analog of the classical broken geodesic approximation of the loop space : we shall prove that the action sublevels deformation retract onto finite dimensional submanifolds of the loop space , over which the action functionals are @xmath40 .",
    "in section  [ s : prel ] we set up the notation and we give most of the preliminary definitions and results .",
    "in the subsequent three sections we deal with lagrangian functions that are convex quadratic - growth ( the precise definition is given in section  [ s : lagr_settings ] ) . in section  [ s : discretizations ] we introduce a discretization technique for the action functional .",
    "in section  [ s : lochomemb ] we prove an abstract morse - theoretic result , which will be applied to the action functional . in section  [ s :",
    "homvansec ] , we prove a vanishing result for elements of the relative homology groups of pairs of action sublevels under the iteration map .",
    "the three sections [ s : discretizations ] , [ s : lochomemb ] and [ s : homvansec ] can be read independently from one another , with the only exception of subsection  [ s : applmorselagr ] , which requires section  [ s : discretizations ] . in section  [",
    "s : conv_quad_modifications ] we introduce the machinery of convex quadratic modifications of tonelli lagrangians , and we apply it to build suitable local homology groups and to prove a homological vanishing result for the tonelli action . finally , in section  [ s : proof ] we prove theorem  [ t : conley ] .",
