    "the principal question of topological fixed point theory can be phrased as follows ( cf .",
    "[ b ] , p. 9 ) . + _ given a selfmap @xmath2 of a ( connected ) topological space @xmath3 , what is the minimum number @xmath4 of fixed points among all the maps homotopic to @xmath2 ? _",
    "+ soon after the groundbreaking work of s. lefschetz [ l ] appeared , the danish mathematician j. nielsen made a decisive contribution ( cf .",
    "[ n1 ] , p. 256 , and [ n2 ] , p. 289 ) : he introduced a very natural equivalence relation among the fixed points of @xmath2 .",
    "counting the `` essential '' equivalence classes one then obtains the nielsen number @xmath5 of @xmath2 which is a lower bound for @xmath4 .",
    "actually already in the early 1940 s it was known that these two numbers are equal whenever @xmath3 is a compact manifold of dimension @xmath6 or a compact surface with nonnegative euler characteristic @xmath7 .",
    "so it came as a surprise when b. jiang was able to prove in 1984/85 that @xmath8 can be strictly positive , cf .",
    "[ ji1 ] , [ ji2 ] ( and even arbitrarily large , cf .",
    "[ z ] , [ ke ] , [ ji3 ] ) for suitable selfmaps of any surface with @xmath9 .",
    "+ it is natural to extend these studies in two directions .",
    "first one may investigate the fixed point behaviour of fiberwise selfmaps of a fibration and , in particular , those aspects which remain preserved under fiberwise homotopies .",
    "this was done e.g. by a. dold and resulted in the construction of his fixed point index ( cf .",
    "[ d ] ; see also [ je1 ] , [ je2 ] ) ; different approaches were used more recently e.g. in [ hkw ] , [ gns ] and [ kw ] .",
    "secondly we can extend the whole discussion to pairs of maps @xmath10 and their coincidence sets @xmath11 this stimulated an enormous amount of research in recent years ( see e.g. [ bgz ] , [ dg ] , [ gr1 + 2 ] , [ ko1, ... ,5 ] , [ kr ] and others ) and includes the fixed point question as the special case where @xmath12 and @xmath13 is the identity map @xmath14 .",
    "+ recently also coincidences of fiberwise maps",
    "@xmath15 \\ar[dr]_-{p_m } & & n \\ar[ld]^-{p_n}\\\\     & & b&\\\\    } \\ ] ] have attracted increased attention . here",
    "@xmath16 and @xmath17 are smooth fiber bundles ( with typical fibers @xmath18 and @xmath19 of dimensions @xmath20 and @xmath21 , resp . ) over the closed connected @xmath22-dimensional manifold @xmath23 , the total space @xmath3 is also closed and the maps make the diagram commute .",
    "one of the principal problems is to determine the * _ minimum number _ * @xmath24 * _ of coincidence points _ * among all the pairs @xmath25 of maps",
    "such that @xmath26 is fiberwise homotopic @xmath27 now , since we allow the dimension of @xmath3 and @xmath28 to differ , generic coincidence sets may well be higher dimensional submanifolds of @xmath3 , and @xmath29 need not be finite . thus it seems more interesting to study the ( finite ! ) _ * minimum number * _ @xmath30 * _ of pathcomponents of coincidence subspaces _ * of @xmath3 among all pairs fiberwise homotopic to @xmath31 .",
    "it is particulary important to know when the minimum numbers vanish , i.e. when the maps @xmath32 and @xmath13 can be deformed away from one another by fiberwise homotopies . in this case",
    "we say that the pair @xmath31 is _ * loose over @xmath33*_.    a strong tool is the normal bordism class @xmath34\\in   \\omega_{m+b - n}\\left(e_b(f_1,f_2);\\widetilde{\\varphi}\\right)\\ ] ] of coincidence data introduced in [ gk ] .",
    "it generalizes ( and often sharpens ) the fixed point index of classical nielsen theory and the strongest ( `` universal '' ) version of dold s ( fiberwise ) fixed point index ( compare [ gk ] ) .",
    "our first two coincidence data are best described by the commuting diagram @xmath35\\ar[d]^-{\\mathrm{pr}}\\save {      e\\small{e_b(f_1,f_2):=\\left\\{(x,\\theta)\\in m\\times p(n ) \\,\\left|\\ ,        \\begin{matrix } p_{n}\\ , \\circ\\,\\theta\\,\\equiv\\ , p_m(x);\\\\ \\theta(0)=f_1(x),\\\\      \\,\\theta(1)=f_2(x)\\end{matrix}\\right.\\right\\}}\\restore } \\\\",

    "already the decomposition of @xmath48 into its pathcomponents induces the decomposition @xmath50 into the closed manifolds @xmath51 ( which are almost all empty ) .          clearly @xmath58 and the nielsen number ( but _ not _ necessarily the reidemeister number ) is always finite .",
    "moreover it can be shown that both numbers depend only on the fiberwise homotopy classes of @xmath32 and @xmath13 and that @xmath59 ( compare [ ko2 ] ) .",
    "[ 1.10 ] + here @xmath23 consists only of one point and @xmath60 where @xmath2 is a selfmap of a connected manifold @xmath12 .",
    "there is a bijection from the classical (  algebraic  ) reidemeister set @xmath61 onto @xmath62 and @xmath63 records the indices of all the nielsen fixed point classes of @xmath2 ( cf .",
    "[ ko2 ] ) .",
    "in particular , our definition ( [ 1.1 ] ) agrees with the classical definition of nielsen and reidemeister numbers ( cf .",
    "similarly , @xmath64 is just the classical minimum number @xmath4 of fixed points ( cf .",
    "[ br]).@xmath65    in general the lower bound @xmath66 fails often to be also equal to @xmath67 ( for infinitely many counterexamples involving e.g. maps of the form @xmath68 see [ ko2 ] , 1.17 ) .",
