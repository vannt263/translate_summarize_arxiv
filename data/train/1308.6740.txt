    "in the modern treatment of phase transitions it is common to associate the emerging of such phenomena with the breaking of some symmetry of the system .",
    "however , many of the most familiar phase transitions have not been settled yet within this framework , e.g. the liquid - vapour phase transition of water ( see for instance the discussion in sec .",
    "4.1.3 in @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , in recent years special interest has been devoted to the thermodynamics of non - extensive systems , especially those for which long range interactions play a leading role in their description ( c.f . @xcite and references therein ) , which can not be treated in the context of standard extensive thermodynamics and therefore require a generalisation of the homogeneity condition of the thermodynamic potential .    in this work ,",
    "we consider systems whose thermodynamic potential is a homogeneous function of arbitrary order  @xmath0  of the _ extensive _ variables , that is [ eq.01 ] ( e^a ) = ^(e^a ) , where @xmath1 represents the thermodynamic potential , @xmath2 is a constant different from zero , @xmath3 denote the extensive variables and the index @xmath4 ranges from 1 to @xmath5 , the number of macroscopic degrees of freedom of the system .",
    "we argue that all such systems have a common theoretical symmetry that breaks whenever a coexistence of two phases is present , i.e. the _ legendre symmetry_. to this end , we will adopt a geometric point of view suitable for describing total legendre transformations as a symmetry acting on the appropriate space .",
    "our results will be consistent with those emerging from the non - equivalence of statistical ensembles as discussed in chapter 3 of @xcite and in @xcite .    according to the geometric description introduced by hermann @xcite and mrugala @xcite",
    ", one can define a _",
    "thermodynamic phase - space _ as a contact manifold where the first law of thermodynamics is promoted to an integrability condition defining the integral sub - manifolds of the contact distribution . for a system with @xmath5 degrees of freedom ,",
    "the maximal integral sub - manifolds ( its _ legendre sub - manifolds _ ) are precisely @xmath5-dimensional .",
    "this is characteristic of the fact that on such sub - manifolds the thermodynamic potential @xmath1 and the intensive variables @xmath6 can all be expressed as functions of the @xmath5 extensive variables @xmath3 .",
    "a symmetry preserving the contact structure of the thermodynamic phase space , induces a diffeomorphism between legendre sub - manifolds .",
    "this is the formal cause of the well known fact that we can use the equations of state to perform a total legendre transformation , changing the thermodynamic potential and exchanging the role of the independent variables of the system .",
    "we will show that this is always possible as long as the potential satisfies the global convexity conditions , that is , as long as the system is in a single phase @xcite .",
    "there are plenty of physical processes whose thermodynamic potentials undergo regions of instability where the legendre transformation is not defined . in practice , one recovers stability by means of the maxwell equal area law , but the legendre symmetry can not be restored @xcite .",
    "the breaking of the legendre symmetry allows auto - intersections of legendre sub - manifolds .",
    "this implies that there are processes that leave one thermodynamic phase and go to the other through a sequence of equilibrium states , i.e. the _ coexistence processes_. here , we give a geometric characterisation of such processes as curves lying on the @xmath7 dimensional intersection of two ( equilibrium ) legendre sub - manifolds characterising two different phases .",
    "we introduce a hamiltonian function on the thermodynamic phase - space which vanishes whenever the system is in equilibrium . a natural candidate for such a function",
    "stems from euler s identity for homogeneous systems , therefore , let us call such function the _",
    "euler s contact hamiltonian _",
    "( ech ) . in analogy with classical mechanics ,",
    "all thermodynamic processes are constrained to sub - manifolds where the ech is constant . moreover ,",
    "the exterior derivative of such hamiltonian is pulled - back to the equilibrium manifold to yield the generalized gibbs - duhem relation .",
    "we will discuss how this equation imposes constraints on the admissible thermodynamic processes and conclude that equilibrium among the system s sub - parts requires a reformulation of the zeroth law .",
    "these ideas have been discussed in the context of non - extensive thermodynamics ( c.f . discussions in @xcite , and @xcite for general issues on non - additivity and non - extensivity ) .",
    "finally , we discuss an example of a ` law ' stemming from a generalised notion of equilibrium , i.e. the tolman - ehrenfest effect .",
    "let us consider the contact description of the phase space of thermodynamics as given in @xcite .",
    "given a thermodynamic system with @xmath5 degrees of freedom , the _ thermodynamic phase space _ is the @xmath8-dimensional manifold @xmath9 , endowed with a contact structure @xmath10 , that is , a maximally non - integrable distribution of co - dimension one hyper - planes .",
    "we can characterise such a distribution with the aid of a 1-form @xmath11 such that = ( ) , and the non - integrability condition @xmath12 is fulfilled .",
    "equation can be understood as the necessary condition for a well defined volume form for the thermodynamic phase space .",
    "additionally , it is always possible to find a set of local coordinates for @xmath9 such that the 1-form @xmath13 can be written in the form @xmath14 where we have used einstein s convention for repeated indices and @xmath4 runs from @xmath15 to @xmath5  the number of degrees of freedom .",
    "note that at this level @xmath1 , @xmath6 and @xmath3 are coordinate functions for @xmath9 and do not posses any thermodynamic significance .",
    "the thermodynamic nature of such a set of coordinates is realised on the integral sub - manifolds of the thermodynamic phase space .",
    "of special interest are the _ maximal _ integral sub - manifolds , @xmath16 , i.e. those of maximal dimension which can be embedded in @xmath9 such that their tangent bundle is completely contained in the distribution @xmath17 .",
    "one can show that these correspond to @xmath5-dimensional sub - manifolds defined through the embedding = ( ( e^a ) , e^a , i_a(e^b ) ) , satisfying the condition ^ * ( ) = ( ( e^b ) - i_a ) e^a = 0 , equivalent to the first - law of thermodynamics ( e^a ) = i_a e^a , i_a = ( e^a ) .",
    "it is clear that in such sub - manifolds the coordinate @xmath1 can be interpreted as a thermodynamic potential depending on the _ extensive _ variables @xmath3 , and that their conjugate _ intensive _ variables @xmath6 correspond to the set of equations of state .",
    "note that the words _ extensive _ and _ intensive _ only apply in standard thermodynamics , whereas in the following we will work with generalised thermodynamics , where the potential and the variables @xmath3 need not be extensive . we will attach ourselves to the use of this convention .",
    "moreover , in the present work we will only consider situations where the potential @xmath18 is a homogeneous function of order @xmath0 .",
    "let us now turn to describe briefly the process of coexistence ( for a more detailed description see e.g. @xcite ) . to this end",
    ", we refer to the @xmath19 and @xmath20 diagrams of the liquid - vapour coexistence for a van der waals fluid presented in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] . above the critical temperature @xmath21 , the isotherms on the @xmath19 diagram are decreasing functions of @xmath22 and , therefore , are stable . on the contrary , below the critical temperature",
    ", the isotherms have a region of instability , which is `` cut - out '' by means of the maxwell construction , which consists in finding the equilibrium value for the pressure at which the two phases coexist at equilibrium .",
    "it turns out that such equilibrium value is given by requiring that the two areas indicated by @xmath23 and @xmath24 in the @xmath19 diagram be equal .",
    "it is crucial for our discussion to note that the way in which maxwell construction operates to restore equilibrium is by requiring that the intensive quantities be equal between the two phases @xcite , which is the standard definition of equilibrium between two parts of a system described by a homogeneous function of order one .",
    "diagram and on a @xmath20 diagram .",
    "two aspects are of major interest .",
    "the first is to note that the process of coexistence is represented by a line on the @xmath19 diagram and a point on the @xmath20 diagram .",
    "second , in order for the two phases to coexist at equilibrium , the temperatures and the pressures must be the same .",
    "more details in the text .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ]   diagram and on a @xmath20 diagram .",
    "two aspects are of major interest .",
    "the first is to note that the process of coexistence is represented by a line on the @xmath19 diagram and a point on the @xmath20 diagram .",
    "second , in order for the two phases to coexist at equilibrium , the temperatures and the pressures must be the same .",
    "more details in the text .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    it is worth noting that when a coexistence of two or more phases is present , the description in the variables @xmath3 is _ not equivalent _ to that using the variables @xmath6 .",
    "in fact , by looking at the two diagrams in fig . [ figure1 ] , one immediately sees that in the @xmath19 coordinates the coexistence is given by a line , whereas in the @xmath20 coordinates it corresponds to the single point , indicated by @xmath25 . as consequence ,",
    "the change of coordinates in that region is not well defined .",
    "from a perspective similar to that of the renormalisation group technique ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) , this signals that in such region new parameters might be involved to account for the ( now relevant ) extra degrees of freedom , such parameters being in this case the full set of @xmath26 thermodynamic variables in the phase space .",
    "furthermore , the need for more degrees of freedom hints at the breaking of some underlying symmetry . indeed , as we have already pointed out , the descriptions using the extensive or the intensive coordinates are equivalent _ as long as the legendre transform is well defined _ , i.e. when the global convexity conditions are strictly satisfied @xcite .",
    "in fact , the transformation from the thermodynamic potential @xmath18 to its total legendre transform @xmath27 induces a diffeomorphism @xmath28 on every legendre sub - manifold @xmath29 between the coordinates @xmath3 and @xmath6 given by the equations of state @xmath30 it is straightforward to calculate the push - forward of such transformation , which is @xmath31 where @xmath32 is any vector field on @xmath33 . for example , the ideal gas is a system that globally satisfies the _ strict _ convexity conditions , therefore , it has only one phase which is represented in contact geometry by a single , smooth , legendre sub - manifold .",
    "however , the majority of systems undergo regions of instability and phase separation .",
    "therefore , the legendre mapping between the two sets of coordinates is a diffeomorphism _ as long as the hessian of the potential @xmath1 is non - degenerate_.    there is a subtle point to note here . whenever we consider a homogeneous thermodynamic system of order one , the total legendre transformation is always degenerate , an indication that we are considering more degrees of freedom than needed .",
    "thus , one uses the scaling property of the system and fixes one of the extensive variables and divides the rest of them by such a fixed amount .",
    "since the system is extensive , the result of this also divides the potential by the same amount . in practice , one either chooses the particle number or the volume , and works with molarised or densitisised quantities , respectively , for which the total legendre transform is well - defined .",
    "let us explore the consequences of breaking the legendre symmetry over a region of coexistence .",
    "consider the total legendre transformation in @xmath9 .",
    "this corresponds to a redefinition of the coordinate functions given by @xmath34 such redefinition induces in the equilibrium space @xmath35 an exchange of the coordinates @xmath3 for the @xmath6 , and now the transformed potential becomes @xmath36 .",
    "first , we look at a thermodynamic process  represented by a parametrised curve @xmath37  lying on a subset of @xmath9 corresponding to single phase region ,",
    "that is , @xmath37 is contained in a single legendre sub - manifold @xmath29 , where the legendre transformation is well defined .",
    "along such process , the thermodynamic potential @xmath18 changes according to the first law , @xmath38 where we have denoted the tangent vector field to the curve @xmath37 collectively by @xmath39 .",
    "similarly , its total legendre transform @xmath27 also changes according to the first law , this time written as @xmath40    now , we look at a process taking place in a coexistence region , this time we label it by @xmath41 . in this case , the intensive variables are fixed by the requirement of equilibrium between the two phases , while the extensive variables change .",
    "@xmath1 varies along the coexistence process according to the first law ( [ 1stlawphi ] ) .",
    "however , @xmath42 , that is , the legendre transformed potential does not provide us with equivalent thermodynamic information about the process .",
    "the breaking of the correspondence between the changes in the two potentials is a motivation to define on the phase space the _ euler s contact hamiltonian _ ( ech ) as @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the function defined in ( [ tildepotential ] ) .",
    "note that this definition can be interpreted as the phase - space function ( 0-form ) generating euler s identity in the space of equilibrium @xmath45 from ( [ echzero ] ) it follows that _ all the leaves of the contact distribution are characterized by the zeroth level of the ech_. also note that , contrary to the symplectic case , every contact hamiltonian on the thermodynamic phase - space generates a flow tangent only to its zeroth level surface @xcite .",
    "therefore , the above result implies that the flow generated by the ech is tangent to the equilibrium sub - manifolds at every point , i.e. it is a thermodynamic process .",
    "this suggests that _ any _ thermodynamic process is characterised by the flow of the ech and completely determined by suitable boundary conditions consistent with the laws of thermodynamics , a matter which will be discussed elsewhere @xcite .    by direct computation",
    "we obtain the generalised gibbs - duhem relation on each legendre sub - manifold [ g - d ]    .^*(e)|_singlephase=&(1-)^*()-^*()= + = & ( 1-)i_ae^a+e^ai_a=0 .    now ,",
    "if we consider a process @xmath41 over the region of coexistence ( which by the gibbs phase rule necessarily happens on a sub - manifold whose dimension is not maximal , i.e. it is not a legendre sub - manifold ) , one has that @xmath46 is constant , that is @xmath42 , as we have already discussed",
    ". therefore , along a process of coexistence we have that [ g - dcoex ]    e(_c)&=(1-)(_c ) + & = ( 1-)i^c_ae^a(_c ) ,    where the notation @xmath47 indicates that the values of the `` intensive '' quantities are fixed along the coexistence process @xmath41 .",
    "it is immediate to see that in the case @xmath48 the relation ( [ g - dcoex ] ) is identically zero , therefore , both phases are in equilibrium through the coexistence process ( having the same values for the intensive quantities ) and , thus , the gibbs - duhem equation is satisfied .",
    "nevertheless , when @xmath49 , the exterior derivative of the ech  @xmath50  along the coexistence is not zero .",
    "this implies that the gibbs - duhem relation is not identically satisfied .",
    "this serves as a motivation to revisit the zeroth law of thermodynamics for non - extensive systems ( c.f .",
    "discussions in @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "there are numerous equivalent definitions of thermodynamic equilibrium . here , let us a agree that a system is in equilibrium when an observer can not distinguish past from future by the sole observation of the macroscopic state of the system at any given time .",
    "if this is not the case , the macroscopic state of the system has not settled yet and dissipative fluxes operate in order to ` homogenise ' the intensive parameters . for example , in the absence of external fields , a system whose temperature is not uniform settles down towards equilibrium by means of heat transfer from regions of higher to lower temperature .",
    "this situation is subtler when considering the effect of long range interactions .",
    "thus , for example , one can show that in the case of relativistic heat transfer of a dissipative fluid , the equilibrium condition does not imply that the temperature is uniform through the system s sub - parts , but that the combined effect of the temperature gradient and the external gravitational field ( or the fluid s acceleration ) balance one another so that there is no net heat flux within the system @xcite . this is the well known tolman - ehrenfest effect @xcite .",
    "a consequence of such effect is that the entropy becomes non - extensive .",
    "generally speaking , all systems with long range interactions have non - extensive properties . a generalised version of the tolman - ehrenfest effect for different types of long range interactions has been discussed in @xcite .",
    "let us note that our present study independently suggests a different definition for equilibrium in the case of non - extensive systems .",
    "in this section we show how to adjust the definition of equilibrium for non - extensive homogeneous systems in order to satisfy the generalised gibbs - duhem relation , equation ( [ g - d ] ) , when the system is sub - divided into various parts .    for an ordinary thermodynamic system ,",
    "the potential @xmath18 is a homogeneous function of order one of the variables @xmath3 . in this case , the conjugate variables @xmath51 are homogeneous functions of order _ zero _ , that is , these are _ intensive _ quantities .",
    "this fact is tacitly used in many textbooks to formulate the _ zeroth law _ ,",
    "namely , that for a given thermodynamic system , the intensive variables attain a constant equilibrium value through all the system s sub - parts @xcite .",
    "that is , if one scales the system by a non - vanishing constant factor @xmath2 , we have @xmath52 following the same reasoning , one can provide a redefinition of the thermodynamic conjugate variables @xmath51 to promote them to honest intensive quantities for thermodynamic systems of order different from one .",
    "such redefinition would preserve our primitive notion of equilibrium in homogeneous thermodynamic systems of order one and , moreover , it would allow us to recover the identity character of gibbs - duhem relation , that is , it would provide a consistent definition of first order phase transitions in a more general case .",
    "let the thermodynamic potential @xmath18 be a homogeneous function of order @xmath0 [ c.f equation ] . by the properties of homogeneous functions",
    ", it follows that the corresponding functions @xmath51 are homogeneous of order @xmath53 @xcite .",
    "thus , we define the generalised intensive quantities by @xmath54 it is immediate to verify that the @xmath55 are homogeneous functions of order zero .",
    "moreover , we say that _ the sub - parts of a system are in equilibrium between one another if and only if the values of the @xmath55 are constant_.    let us see now how the gibbs - duhem identity is recovered with the new definition of equilibrium over the region of phase separation . first , recall that in the region where the system is in a single phase , equation ( [ g - d ] ) is an identity for any homogeneous function , independent of the specific details in the definition of equilibrium at hand .",
    "the problem with the use of non - intensive quantities only arises when one divides the system into various parts .",
    "perhaps the most evident  and the most important  case is that of coexistence , in which the system naturally separates into two phases .",
    "thus , we start by rewriting equation ( [ g - d ] ) in terms of the @xmath55 defined in ( [ itilde ] ) , to obtain @xmath56 now , considering a process of coexistence @xmath41 as in the preceding section and rewriting equation ( [ g - d2 ] ) by expanding the second differential , we get @xmath57=0\\ , .",
    "\\end{split}\\ ] ] finally , imposing the condition that the coexistence process happens at equilibrium which , by our new definition , means that the values of the @xmath58 are constant , the first addend in the square brackets vanishes and we recover an identity .",
    "one of the necessary conditions for thermodynamic equilibrium in general relativity demands the existence of a time - like killing vector for the space - time under consideration @xcite . in the context of a fluid in a spherically symmetric space - time",
    "one can show that such a killing vector satisfies g_ab ^a ^b = g_00(r ) = -^2 = - t^-2 , where @xmath59 are the components of the metric , @xmath60 is the time - like killing vector , @xmath61 is the temperature of the fluid and @xmath62 denotes the radial coordinate .",
    "we observe that the condition for thermal equilibrium does not require the temperature to be constant along the radial direction , but instead it must satisfy @xmath63 , which in the weak field limit reduces to t(r ) ( 1 + ) = , where @xmath64 is the newtonian gravitational potential and @xmath65 is the speed of light .",
    "therefore , it follows from that the entropy of the fluid is s = ( 1 + ) ^ , and , hence , the system can not be extensive , i.e. one can not set @xmath0 equal to 1 unless the gravitational potential identically vanishes .",
    "we have seen that the breaking of the legendre symmetry can be always associated to first order phase transitions in the case of homogeneous thermodynamic systems of any order . moreover , in the region of coexistence the system separates into two phases and hence new parameters are necessary to fully describe it . we have argued that such parameters shall be the complete set of thermodynamic variables that constitute the thermodynamic phase space . besides",
    ", we have introduced a ( contact ) hamiltonian energy for thermodynamics that defines all the possible equilibrium processes as orbits constrained to sub - manifolds of the thermodynamic phase space defined as zero levels of such energy ( a detailed treatment of this will be given elsewhere @xcite ) .",
    "the construction has been given for homogeneous thermodynamic potentials of any order and therefore these results apply to any homogeneous generalisation of standard extensive thermodynamics .",
    "an interesting byproduct of our hamiltonian formulation of homogeneous thermodynamics is that a generalised zeroth law of thermodynamics shall be introduced in order to make the notion of equilibrium consistent with the gibbs - duhem relation .",
    "this definition can easily be extended to all quasi - homogeneous functions @xcite and therefore can apply to all the thermodynamic systems for which some scaling laws are computable . as a particular case ,",
    "we have used here the tolman - ehrenfest effect to show that the internal energy of a thermodynamic system on a gravitational field can not be homogeneous of order one unless the gravitational potential vanishes .",
    "these topics are of much interest , since our investigation is based on a purely mathematical approach .",
    "therefore we will investigate in more detail the relationship with the generalisations of the tolman - ehrenfest effect and with the equilibrium definition in statistical mechanics of non - extensive systems in a sequent work .",
