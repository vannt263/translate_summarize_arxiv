    "in the latest years a big effort has been made to investigate one of the most striking new features in nuclear physics : halo nuclei .",
    "they are weakly bound and spatially extended systems where one or two particles have a high probability of being at distances larger than the typical nuclear radius .",
    "general properties and the criteria for the ocurrence of nuclear halos have been discussed in @xcite and a review of nuclear halos has recently been published @xcite .",
    "the appearence of the halo structure in light nuclei along the neutron dripline @xcite gives special interest to this region of nuclei .",
    "the most general properties of them are well described by few - body models , dividing the degrees of freedom into the approximately frozen ( core ) and the active ( halo ) degrees of freedom .",
    "in particular , special attention has been paid to borromean systems consisting of three - body bound systems , where all the two - body subsystems are unbound @xcite .",
    "the prototypes nuclear halos are @xmath4he ( @xmath5he+n+n ) and @xmath0li ( @xmath6li+n+n ) , both thoroughly discussed in a general theoretical framework in @xcite .",
    "the ability to produce secondary beams of halo nuclei opens the possibility of investigating their structure by measuring the momentum distribution of  particles \" resulting from fragmentation reactions @xcite .",
    "however one major problem in the interpretation of such measurements is the inherent mixture of effects from the original structure of the projectile and the reaction mechanism . both",
    "should therefore be properly incorporated in model calculations .",
    "the simplest picture used to describe this kind of fragmentation reactions is formulated in the sudden approximation , where one of the three particles in the projectile is instantaneously removed by the target , while the other two particles remain undisturbed .",
    "clearly this can only be justified for reaction times much shorter than the characteristic time for the motion of the three particles in the system . since the projectile is weakly bound this requirement is well fulfilled for any high - energy beam .",
    "the observed momentum distribution should then provide direct information about the three - body wave function .",
    "the validity of this model as a first description of the reaction has been discussed in the litterature , see for example @xcite .",
    "the connection between the wave function and the momentum distributions is more complicated than originally anticipated when the early experiments were designed .",
    "it was found recently that momentum distributions are highly affected by the final state interaction ( fsi ) between the two particles remaining after the collision , especially when low - lying resonances are present @xcite .",
    "this essential ingredient must then be incorporated into the model .",
    "the final state two - body interaction is at the same time determining the three - body structure of the projectile ( halo nucleus ) , and therefore a consistent treatment of the initial and final states is needed to allow reliable interpretations of the experimental data .",
    "this paper is number four in a series discussing the general properties of three - body halo systems . in the first of these @xcite we discussed borromean systems , in the second @xcite we extended the discussion to general three - body systems and in the third @xcite we discussed the effects of finite spin of the particles . in this paper",
    "we investigate fragmentation reactions of borromean projectiles by use of the sudden approximation . a brief report containing a few of the pertinent results for @xmath0li",
    "is published @xcite .",
    "our main purpose is here to formulate a general procedure to incorporate the effects of final state two - body interactions .",
    "this two - body interaction is consistently included both in the final state wave function and in the description of the three - body projectile .",
    "we apply the method in detailed analyses of measured @xmath0li fragmentation reactions .",
    "we thereby obtain essential information about the unbound @xmath2li system .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : the mathematical formalism is developed in section 2 , which to facilitate the understanding is divided in five subsections .",
    "the general numerical results are presented in section 3 , where we as illustration use parameters relevant for @xmath0li fragmentation reactions . in section 4",
    "we perform realistic calculations for @xmath0 li and compare to experimental data .",
    "finally , section 5 contains a summary and the conclusions .",
    "some of the mathematical definitions are collected in an appendix .",
    "to describe three - body halo fragmentation reactions we shall use the sudden approximation .",
    "we are then assuming a process where a high - energy three - body halo projectile instantaneously looses one of the particles without disturbing the remaining two .",
    "we also assume a light target and we shall therefore not consider coulomb dissociation process , which then only contribute marginally .",
    "we work in the center of mass system of the three - body projectile and denote by * k * and * q * the total and relative momentum of the two remaining particles in the final state . the transition matrix of the reaction in the sudden approximation is then given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the three - body wave function , * r * is the distance between the two reamining particles , and * r * is the distance between the center of mass of the two - body system and the removed particle .",
    "this transition matrix describes the final state as a plane wave , which means that the interactions between the particles are neglected . in principle",
    "all of them should be included in the calculation , but under the experimental setup where one of the particles suddenly is removed , only the interaction between the two non - disturbed particles is present . to account for this final state two - body interaction the plane wave @xmath9 has to be replaced by the corresponding _ distorted _ two - body wave function @xmath10 .    in the following subsections",
    "we describe how we construct the initial three - body halo wave function @xmath8 as well as the distorted two - body wave function @xmath11 .",
    "finally we compute the transtion matrix and the momentum distributions .",
    "we shall use the jacobi coordinates , basically defined as the relative coordinates between two of the particles ( * x * ) and between their center of mass and the third particle ( * y * ) .",
    "three sets of jacobi coordinates can be constructed and the precise definitions and the corresponding sets of hyperspherical coordinates ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 ) are given in the appendix .",
    "one of the three sets of hyperspherical coordinates is sufficient for a complete description of the system , but the subtle correlations are easier to describe by use of all three sets .",
    "the volume element is given by @xmath16 , where @xmath17 .",
    "the total wave function @xmath18 of the three - body system ( with total spin @xmath19 and projection @xmath20 ) is written as a sum of three components @xmath21 , which in turn for each @xmath12 are expanded in a complete set of generalized angular functions @xmath22 @xmath23 where the radial expansion coefficients @xmath24 are component independent and @xmath25 is the phase space factor .",
    "these wave functions satisfy the three faddeev equations @xcite @xmath26 where @xmath27 are the two - body interactions , @xmath28 is the total energy , @xmath29 is the kinetic energy operator and @xmath30 is a cyclic permutation of @xmath31 .",
    "the angular functions are now chosen for each @xmath12 as the eigenfunctions of the angular part of the faddeev equations : @xmath32 where @xmath30 again is a cyclic permutation of @xmath31 , @xmath33 is an arbitrary normalization mass , and @xmath34 is the @xmath12-independent part of the kinetic energy operator .",
    "the analytic expressions for @xmath35 and the kinetic energy operator can for instance be found in @xcite .",
    "the angular functions @xmath36 are expanded in terms of the complete set of hyperspherical harmonics @xmath37 , where the quantum number @xmath38 usually is called the hypermoment , @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the orbital angular momenta associated with * x * and * y * , and @xmath41 is the coupling of these angular momenta . the result is @xmath42^{j",

    "the target suddenly removes one of the particles from the projectile and the remaining interaction in the final state therefore acts between the two non - disturbed particles . assuming that the two - body interaction does not mix two - body states with different spin @xmath45 and relative orbital angular momentum @xmath39",
    ", we can expand the two - body wave function in partial waves , see @xcite , as @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the spin projection of @xmath45 , @xmath57 is the radial and @xmath58 the angular distorted wave function . the angles @xmath14 and",
    "@xmath59 define the direction of * x * and * k*@xmath60 .",
    "these assumptions are usually strictly valid .",
    "the only exception arises from the tensor interaction and even then the resulting mixing is often very small and therefore insignificant in the present context .",
    "the two - body space and momentum coordinates * x * and * k*@xmath60 are defined consistently with the jacobi coordinates introduced in the three - body wave function ( see appendix ) @xmath61 where * r * is the relative spatial coordinate and @xmath62 the relative momentum .",
    "the mass @xmath33 is the arbitrary normalization mass and @xmath63 is the reduced mass of the two - body system .",
    "the radial functions @xmath64 are obtained numerically by solving the schrdinger equation with the appropriate two - body potential @xmath65 @xmath66 where @xmath67    when the interaction between the two particles is neglected the solution of eq.([schr ] ) is @xmath68 , and the expansion in eq.([2bexp ] ) reduces to the usual expansion of a plane wave in terms of spherical bessel functions @xmath69 .      to compute the transition matrix in eq.([tran ] )",
    "it is convenient to rewrite the three - body wave function in eq.([tot3b ] ) in terms of the set of jacobi coordinates where * x * is related to the two particles remaining after the fragmentation .",
    "this means that all three faddeev components in eq.([tot ] ) have to be expressed in terms of the chosen set of jacobi coordinates .",

    ", we get instead the two - dimensional relative momentum ( @xmath100 ) distribution .",
    "it should be noted that we have not specified any coordinate system and the axes @xmath103 , @xmath75 , and @xmath104 are therefore completely arbitrary .",
    "thus , in the sudden approximation the longitudinal and transverse momentum distributions are identical .",
    "comparison with the measured momentum distributions requires transformation to the center of mass system of the projectile . to do this we construct the momentum @xmath105 of one of the particles in the final state relative to the center of mass of the projectile as a linear combination of @xmath106 and @xmath107 @xmath108",
    "if the jacobi coordinate * x * refers to particles 1 and 2 , then @xmath109 and @xmath110 take the set of values ( see eqs.([pi ] ) and ( [ pj ] ) ) @xmath111    @xmath112    when we compute the momentum distributions of particle 1 and 2 , respectively .    using the momentum @xmath105 of one of the particles as the variable instead of @xmath106",
    "we obtain the relation @xmath113 where @xmath114 arises from the jacobi determinant for the transformation .    as before we must integrate eq.([rot ] ) over the unobserved quantities , i.e. @xmath74 and some of the components of * p*. it is then convenient to use both the initial ( arbitrary ) coordinate system and a rotated system where the @xmath115-axis is along * p*. the volume element is then written as @xmath116 where @xmath117 , @xmath118 , @xmath119 define the direction of * p * in the initial coordinate system and the angles @xmath120 give the direction of @xmath74 in the rotated system .",
    "we express the transition matrix in eq.([tm0 ] ) as a function of * p * referred to the initial system and @xmath74 referred to the rotated system . then we need the relations @xmath121 @xmath122 where @xmath123 is the rotation matrix ( the @xmath124-functions ) defined in @xcite , and the angles ( @xmath125 ) defining the direction of @xmath106 in the rotated system are given by @xmath126 @xmath127    finally , we need to express @xmath128 and @xmath129 in terms of the new variables @xmath1 , @xmath99 and @xmath130 , i.e. @xmath131 @xmath132    the numerically obtained function @xmath133 in eq.([tm0 ] ) depends on @xmath130 and only the integrations over @xmath134 and @xmath135 in eq.([rot ] ) can be done analytically .",
    "we then obtain the four - dimensional differential cross section or momentum distribution relative to the center of mass of the projectile    @xmath136    where we assumed that @xmath137 .",
    "when @xmath138 , the summation over @xmath139 should include an extra factor @xmath140 .",
    "three integrations must be done numerically in order to get the one - dimensional ( @xmath141 ) and two - dimensional @xmath142 momentum distributions of one of the particles in the final state relative to the center of mass of the projectile .",
    "if we assume that one of the particles in the final state , say particle 1 , has infinite mass , then the momentum distribution of particle 2 relative to the three - body center of mass should coincide with the momentum distribution relative to particle 1 .",
    "in other words , eq.([rel3 ] ) should be recovered by integrating eq.([cm3 ] ) over @xmath143 . then @xmath144 ( see eq.([ab2 ] ) ) , @xmath145 and therefore @xmath146 and @xmath147 .",
    "now @xmath128 and @xmath148 are independent of @xmath143 ( eqs.([kappa ] ) and ( [ akappa ] ) ) and the integration over @xmath143 can easily be done analytically leading directly to eq.([rel3 ] ) .",
    "in this section we apply the method to the fragmentation of two - neutron halo nuclei ( core+n+n ) .",
    "two different kinds of processes will be considered : neutron removal and core break - up reactions . in the first case one of the neutrons",
    "is removed by the target , and the neutron - core interaction in the final state must be considered . in the second case , where the core is violently removed from the projectile , the neutron - neutron interaction",
    "is involved in the final state .",
    "we take parameters corresponding to @xmath0li in our examples .",
    "we first specify the two - body potentials used in the calculation .",
    "we then investigate the momentum distributions and how they are affected by final state interactions and the structure of the projectile .",
    "loosely bound systems are mainly sensitive to the low - energy properties of the potentials .",
    "we shall therefore use relatively simple potentials reproducing the available low - energy scattering data and still allowing extensive three - body calculations .    for the neutron - neutron interaction in the singlet @xmath3-wave we use the gaussian potential introduced in ref.@xcite .",
    "the extension to the triplet @xmath1-wave is made by including spin - spin , spin - orbit , and tensor terms .",

    "this choice is convenient when we adjust the all - decisive energy positions of the virtual states and the resonances in the neutron - core subsystem .",

    "energy positions of the virtual @xmath169-state and the @xmath170-resonance in the neutron-@xmath6li subsystem ( first and second column ) and the parameters of the neutron - core potential for each case .",
    "the last two columns give the @xmath3- and @xmath1-wave content in the neutron-@xmath6li subsystem in the three - body wave function of @xmath0li . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     these two facts can be explained by the effects of the centrifugal barrier .",
    "a high @xmath1-wave content in the neutron - core subsystem increases the importance of the centrifugal barrier , see eq.([schr ] ) . consequently the effects of distortion from the short - range potentials is smaller for @xmath1-waves than for @xmath3-waves .",
    "therefore the effects of final state interactions decreases when the @xmath1-wave content increases .",
    "furthermore , the probability for the neutron to be outside the range of the two - body potential drastically decreases for @xmath1-waves @xcite .",
    "this decreases the spatial extension of the initial system when the @xmath1-wave content increases , and the momentum distribution is then broader .    in fig.[2 ] we show the one - dimensional neutron momentum distributions for a neutron removal process .",
    "the notation to distinguish the curves is the same as in fig.[1 ] .",
    "the fwhm for these distributions are shown in the fourth and fifth columns of table ii . let us focus first on the momentum distributions without final state interactions ( thin curves ) .",
    "as in fig.[1 ] we observe that a higher @xmath3-wave content in the neutron-@xmath6li subsystem decreases the widths of the momentum distributions .",
    "the fwhm decreases from 94 mev / c to 51 mev / c when the @xmath3-wave content increases from 22% to 97% .",
    "when final state interactions are included in the calculations ( thick curves ) , the change in the neutron momentum distributions is much more significant than for core momentum distributions . for low - lying virtual @xmath169-states ( upper part of fig.[2 ] )",
    "the width of the distribution decreases for a virtual state at 100 kev by as much as 45% due to final state interactions .",
    "we still observe that the lower the virtual @xmath169-state ( high @xmath3-wave content in the neutron - core subsystem ) the narrower the momentum distribution . for low - lying @xmath170-resonances in @xmath2li ( lower part of fig.[2 ] )",
    "we also observe a drastic modification of the neutron momentum distributions due to final state interactions .",
    "however , we now see that the lower the @xmath170-resonance ( higher @xmath1-wave content ) the narrower the momentum distribution .",
    "this result seems to contradict our experience from the core momentum distribution where the presence of the centrifugal barrier was decisive .",
    "but the effect of final state interactions on the much lighter neutron in a low - lying @xmath1-resonance is apparently much larger than the simultaneous broadening due to the centrifugal barrier .",
    "we can try to estimate the peak position of the @xmath1-wave contribution to the momentum distribution .",
    "the relative momentum ( @xmath62 ) between the neutron and the core in the final state preferably takes the value @xmath171 , where @xmath172 is the energy of the resonance and @xmath63 is the reduced mass of the two - body system .",
    "the momentum of the neutron relative to the center of mass of the projectile is very close to @xmath106 , since the constant @xmath173 in eq.([trans ] ) is close to zero due to the large mass of the core .",
    "then the neutron momentum distributions in fig.[2 ] would be concentrated around the relative momentum @xmath174 , see eq.([kp ] ) .",
    "if the resonance energy is low , the final state interactions would try to create a narrow momentum distribution .",
    "this argument is valid for both low - lying virtual @xmath169-states and low - lying @xmath170-resonances .",
    "thus , we can obtain a narrow neutron momentum distribution with fwhm compatible with the experimental value in table ii both with low - lying @xmath169 and @xmath170-states .    for two - dimensional neutron and core momentum distributions in a neutron removal process",
    "we obtain conclusions similar to those extracted from figs.[1 ] and [ 2 ] . as a general rule we can say that momentum distributions are narrower and more affected by final state interactions when a low - lying virtual @xmath3-state is present in the neutron - core subsystem ( high @xmath3-wave content ) than with a low - lying @xmath1-resonance ( low @xmath3-wave content ) . as for the one - dimensional distributions the neutron momentum distributions influenced by the final state interactions do not follow this rule .",
    "we can also get a narrow momentum distribution with a low - lying @xmath170-resonance in @xmath2li .    in fig.[3 ]",
    "we show the two - dimensional neutron momentum distributions for a neutron removal process .",
    "the solid curves correspond to the cases where a virtual @xmath169-state is present at 100 kev ( thick solid curve ) and at 200 kev ( thin solid curve ) in the neutron - core subsystem , while the dashed curves represent the cases where a @xmath170-resonance is at 100 kev ( thick dashed curve ) and at 200 kev ( thin dashed curve ) . in all these cases",
    "final state interactions have been included in the calculation .    for a neutron - core subsystem with a @xmath1-resonance at a given energy @xmath172 the momentum distribution ( with fsi ) will exhibit a peak at the relative neutron - core momentum @xmath175 . for @xmath176 kev and 200 kev",
    ", we then expect the peaks at @xmath177 mev / c and at 19 mev / c . in the two - dimensional neutron momentum distributions , we integrate away the dependence on @xmath102 and refer to the center of mass of the projectile .",
    "furthermore , even after including the @xmath3-wave contribution , which is 22% for the thick dashed curve and 36% for the thin dashed curve in fig.[3 ] , we still can see a clear bump in the momentum distributions corresponding to low - lying @xmath1-resonances .",
    "thus , the effects of final state interactions on the two - dimensional neutron momentum distributions results in shapes , which depend very much on the structure of the low - lying state .",
    "let us now turn to core break - up reactions , where the core is violently destroyed during the interaction , but where the sudden approximation still is valid .",
    "then the final state interaction ( neutron - neutron interaction ) is well known and the uncertainties involved in the calculations are reduced . in fig.[4 ] we show one - dimensional neutron momentum distributions for core break - up reactions .",
    "the fwhm for the curves in the figure is given in the fourth and sixth columns of table ii , where the neutron momentum distributions without fsi are identical to those in fig.[2 ] .",
    "we observe that the momentum distributions are rather insensitive to the structure of the neutron - core subsystem although the distributions are narrower for a higher @xmath3-wave content .",
    "this is due to the fact that the final state interaction ( neutron - neutron interaction ) is identical in all the cases and therefore independent of the characteristics of the neutron - core interaction .",
    "thus , the momentum distributions are sensitive to the @xmath2li structure only through the @xmath0li wave function . on the other hand ,",
    "the effect produced by the final state interaction is significant , especially for a low - lying @xmath170-resonance in @xmath2li .",
    "comparison with the experimental width for the neutron momentum distribution in core break - up reactions again suggests a low - lying virtual @xmath3-state in @xmath2li , see table ii .      up to",
    "now we have neglected the spin dependence of the neutron - core interaction or equivalently assumed that the spin of the core is zero . any realistic calculation should of course assume that the spin of @xmath6li is 3/2 , and the neutron - core potential should include a spin dependence splitting the two @xmath3-states in @xmath2li into states of total angular momenta 1 and 2 . to do this , we have in the neutron - core potential included a term proportional to @xmath178 , where @xmath165 is the spin of the neutron and @xmath164 the spin of the core . for simplicity",
    "the spin splitting term has been introduced only in the @xmath3-wave , see eq.([pots ] ) .",
    "the @xmath179 parameter has been chosen to be @xmath180 mev , the spin splitting parameter @xmath181 is taken as @xmath182 for the solid curve and as @xmath183 for the dashed curve . with these values",
    "the solid curves correspond to a situation where the lowest virtual @xmath3-state in @xmath2li has spin 1 and an energy of 50 kev , while the second @xmath3-state has spin 2 and energy 340 kev . for the dashed curves the lowest virtual @xmath3-state in @xmath2li has spin 2 and energy 97 kev , and the @xmath3-state with spin 1 has an energy of 460 kev . in both cases ,",
    "the average position of the virtual @xmath3-states is about 230 kev . in these calculations",
    "we have taken @xmath184 mev and @xmath185 mev , placing the lowest @xmath1-resonance in @xmath2li at 0.5 mev .",
    "final state interactions are included .",
    "the momentum distributions can now be divided into two parts arising respectively from angular momentum 1 and 2 of the final two - body state .",
    "this amounts to a separation of terms with @xmath186 and 2 in eq.([cm3 ] ) . in principle",
    "they can be measured independently . in fig.[5 ] we plot results for the one - dimensional neutron momentum distribution for a neutron removal process .",
    "we have computed and plotted three curves for each case .",
    "the lowest curve ( normalized to 3/8 ) is the one - dimensional neutron momentum distributions assuming that the final two - body system has spin 1 . for the next curve ( normalized to 5/8 )",
    "the final two - body state is assumed to have spin 2 .",
    "finally the upper curve is the sum of the two others and therefore normalized to 1 .",
    "for a final state of spin 1 , the widths of the momentum distributions clearly increase with the energy of the virtual @xmath3-state .",
    "compare the lowest solid and dashed curves with fwhm of 26 and 37 mev / c , respectively .",
    "this trend is also seen for a final state of spin 2 .",
    "compare here the intermediate solid and dashed curves with fwhm of 36 and 30 mev / c , respectively .",
    "we now assume that the spin of the two - body system in the final state is not measured .",
    "then the distributions for the individual spins should be averaged with the statistical weighting already included in the normalizations .",
    "this amounts to include the @xmath45 summation in eq.([cm3 ] ) .",
    "the two cases in fig.[5 ] resulting in the upper the solid and dashed curves can hardly be distinguished ( fwhm=32 mev / c ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that the statistically weighted average energy of the two virtual @xmath3-states in @xmath2li in both cases is about 230 kev .",
    "the pauli principle dictates that both @xmath3-states independent of splitting are equally occupied in @xmath0li .",
    "the influence of the @xmath1-resonance at 0.5 mev is insignificant and the @xmath3-wave content is always about 91% .",
    "therefore the narrow distribution arising from one state must then be compensated by the broader distribution from the other s - state .",
    "thus , when the spin of the final two - body state is unknown the momentum distributions are only sensitive to the average position of the virtual @xmath3-states and the @xmath3-wave content in the initial wave function .",
    "of course this conclusion also holds for core momentum distributions and core break - up reactions .",
    "if the momentum distributions could be measured for a given spin of the final two - body state , information about the lowest lying virtual @xmath3-state of @xmath2li could be extracted from our analyses in a very direct way .",
    "the calculations we made in the previous subsection , even though a very simple @xmath0li structure was assumed , indicate that the unbound @xmath2li nucleus has a low - lying virtual @xmath3-state ( table ii ) .",
    "a low lying @xmath1-resonance clearly overestimates both the width of the core momentum distribution and the neutron momentum distribution in a core break - up reaction .",
    "recent analyses suggest that a virtual @xmath3-state is present at around 50 kev @xcite together with a @xmath1-resonance at 0.5 mev @xcite .",
    "we first adjust the strength parameters in the neutron-@xmath6li potential , where @xmath187 and @xmath158 are chosen to place the lowest @xmath1-resonance at 0.5 mev .",
    "the spin - orbit parameter @xmath158 is used to vary the @xmath1-wave content in the neutron-@xmath6li subsystem of the total @xmath0li wave function .",
    "this is achieved by moving the higher - lying @xmath1-resonances up or down .",
    "then the values of the parameters @xmath179 and @xmath181 are chosen to give a low - lying virtual @xmath3-state and at the same time reproduce the correct binding energy and rms radius of @xmath0li .",
    "the lowest virtual @xmath3-state in @xmath2li is assumed to have spin 2 , but choosing spin 1 instead does not produce significant changes of the numerical results .",
    "the interesting physical parameters are then energy and size of @xmath0li , the @xmath1-wave content and the positions of the lowest @xmath3- and @xmath1-wave resonances in @xmath2li .    in fig.[6a ]",
    "we show one - dimensional @xmath6li momentum distributions from @xmath0li fragmentation .",
    "the energy of the lowest virtual @xmath3-state is 50 kev .",
    "different @xmath1-state contents in the neutron-@xmath6li subsystem have been considered , 4% ( solid curves ) , 18% ( short - dashed curves ) , 26% ( long - dashed curves ) , and 35% ( dot - dashed curves ) .",
    "the thick and the thin curves are the calculations with and without final state interactions , respectively .",
    "the experimental data correspond to longitudinal @xmath6li momentum distributions from a fragmentation process of a @xmath0li projectile of energy 468 mev / u and 648 mev / u colliding with an al target @xcite . as expected and observed in fig.[1 ] , the effect of final state interactions is not very big , due to the large mass of the core .",
    "however , even these small effects seems to be necessary to reproduce the measured core momentum distributions , which in fact are rather insensitive to the structure of the neutron - core subsystem .",
    "all the curves including final state interactions match the experimental data equally well .",
    "deviations between measured and computed curves increase with momentum .",
    "two different sources for this disagreement are obvious .",
    "first the three - body model does not include core degrees of freedom .",
    "therefore , if the neutron - core distance is smaller than the core - radius of about 3 fm , or equivalently the neutron - core relative momentum is larger than about 65 mev / c , the model is not applicable .",
    "secondly , only contributions from nuclear break - up reactions are included in the sudden approximation and other processes are assumed to be negligible .",
    "this is in general believed to be very well fulfilled assumptions , especially for the longitudinal core momentum distributions considered here .",
    "a convincing example is the fragmentation of @xmath4he into an @xmath13-particle and a neutron , see @xcite .",
    "our case of @xmath0li is expected to be more sensitive to possible additional contributions than this very well reproduced transverse momentum distribution of the @xmath13-particle .",
    "the good agreement for the major part of the momentum range in the fig.[6a ] is an aposteriori confirmation of the validity of the model assumptions , i.e. the accuracy of the three - body wave function , the treatment of the reaction mechanism and the incorporation of final state interactions .    when the energy of the lowest virtual @xmath3-state increases the core momentum distributions become broader as seen in fig.[6b ] , where the virtual @xmath3-state energy is 200 kev .",
    "the computed momentum distributions then overestimate the width of the experimental distributions , especially the ones with a higher @xmath1-wave content in the neutron-@xmath6li subsystem .",
    "this conclusion is perhaps only convincingly reached after both the visual impression from the figure and consultation of the numerical widths in table ii .",
    "we can then consider 200 kev as an upper limit to the energy of the lowest virtual @xmath3-state . on the other hand , a lower limit to this energy",
    "is not provided by the core momentum distribution , which remains unchanged for virtual @xmath3-state energies below 50 kev .",
    "let us focus now on neutron momentum distributions , where the effect of final state interactions is larger ( figs.[2 ] , [ 3 ] , and [ 4 ] ) . since for core break - up reactions the final state nucleon - nucleon interaction is well known , this kind of process is a good test for the model and the method of including final state interactions . in fig.[7",
    "] we plot two - dimensional neutron momentum distributions for core break - up reactions for the same @xmath2li structure as used in fig.[6a ] ( virtual @xmath3-state at 50 kev and @xmath1-resonance at 0.5 mev ) .",
    "the meaning of the curves is also as described in fig.[6a ] .",
    "the experimental data are obtained in a fragmentation reaction with a c target and a @xmath0li projectile of 280 mev / u @xcite .",
    "we observe that final state interactions now are crucial for reproducing the experimental distribution .",
    "the calculation with low @xmath1-wave content is too narrow , indicating that some @xmath1-state content is needed in the neutron - core subsystem .",
    "when we gradually increase the energy of the virtual @xmath3-state from 50 kev to 200 kev the momentum distributions remain esentially unchanged ( the variations are of the size of the width of the curves ) .",
    "this insensitivity to the neutron-@xmath188li structure is not surprising , since the remaining particles ( two neutrons ) constitute a different subsystem .    finally , we compute two - dimensional neutron momentum distributions for a neutron removal reaction .",
    "we first consider the case of a low - lying virtual @xmath3-state in @xmath2li with an energy of 50 kev .",
    "the two - dimensional neutron momentum distributions are plotted in fig.[8a ] .",
    "the meaning of the curves is explained in fig.[6a ] .",
    "the experimental data are taken from a fragmentation reaction with a c target and a @xmath0li projectile of 280 mev / u @xcite .",
    "we observe again that final state interactions are decisive in order to reproduce the experimental distribution .",
    "since now the final state interaction depends on the details of the neutron - core potential , the computed distributions show a stronger dependence on the @xmath1-state content in the @xmath2li subsystem . the momentum distribution with a low @xmath1-wave content underestimates the width of the distribution , while any neutron - core interaction producing more than 35% of @xmath1-wave content in @xmath2li overestimates the width .",
    "the best agreement with the experimental distribution is found for a @xmath1-wave content ranging from 20 to 30% .",
    "let us now investigate how these neutron momentum distributions are modified by a variation of the energy of the lowest virtual @xmath3-state in the neutron - core subsystem . in fig.[8b ] we plot the same distributions as in fig.[8a ] for a low - lying virtual @xmath3-state at 10 kev .",
    "the momentum distributions are now much steeper at low values of the momentum and the intermediate region is not well fitted",
    ". none of the distributions are able to reproduce the measured curve in the whole range of momenta .",
    "if we increase the @xmath1-wave content in the neutron - core subsystem to fit the intermediate region , we obtain too high values at large momenta .",
    "the best compromise would differ considerably more both at intermediate and high momenta than the compromise in fig.[8a ] .",
    "furthermore , the deviation at very small momenta also seems to be larger although only based on essentially one measured point with fairly large error bars .",
    "thus , we conclude that the virtual @xmath3-state energy in @xmath2li must be larger than 10 kev .    for energies of the virtual @xmath3-state larger than 50 kev",
    "the experimental neutron distributions distributions are also reproduced fairly well . in fig.[8c ] we show the same distributions as in figs.[8a ] and [ 8b ] , but for a virtual @xmath3-state energy at 100 kev .",
    "the agreement is improved from fig.[8b ] and remains almost unchanged from fig.[8a ] . even for higher virtual @xmath3-state energies the nice agreement",
    "is maintained . this is due to the lack of accurate experimental points at low momenta , which causes the uncertainty in the position of the origin of the distribution .",
    "a larger number of points in that region would further constrain the energy of the virtual @xmath3-state .    comparing figs.[8a]-[8c ] we see that the best agreement with the experimental neutron momentum distributions is obtained for a @xmath1-wave content between 20 and 30% .",
    "the reason is that the behaviour of the distribution for large momenta is determined by the @xmath1-wave structure of the neutron - core subsystem .",
    "this structure is essentially the same in all these figures , i.e. the lowest @xmath1-resonance is placed at 0.5 mev and the higher @xmath1-resonance considerably above .",
    "furthermore , the neutron momentum distributions are rather insensitive to the position of the @xmath1-resonances . a very large variation of these energies are needed to change the shape of the distributions significantly at large momenta .",
    "we have in this paper given a detailed formulation of a general method to describe fragmentation of high - energy three - body borromean halo nuclei on light nuclear targets .",
    "in the previous papers in this series we established general properties of the structure of three - body halo nuclei . the most detailed information about these structures can be obtained from measurements of momentum distributions of the fragments from reactions of halo nuclei with various targets .",
    "the inherent mixture of the initial halo structure and the reaction mechanism requires a description where both ingrediences are included .",
    "the present paper is devoted to construct a suitable method to study the properties of fragmentation products from halo nuclei .",
    "the initial wave function must be available with a good precision and three - body computations are necessary .",
    "the reactions are described in the sudden approximation , where one of the particles instantaneously is removed from the three - body system while the other two particles are left undisturbed .",
    "this approximation is very well adapted for the weakly bound halo nuclei moving with high energy relative to the targets .",
    "the remaining two particles of the projectile move roughly in the beam direction while they continue to interact after the collision .",
    "this final state interaction is essential especially when low - lying resonances are present in the two - body system .",
    "the model must include these effects .",
    "we use the recently developed method to solve the faddeev equations in coordinate space .",
    "the initial three - body wave function is then accurately determined .",
    "we first briefly sketch this method , which is particularly well suited for an accurate treatment of the large - distance behavior .",
    "the low - energy scattering properties described by the scattering lengths are the decisive quantities determining the large - distance behavior of the three - body system .",
    "therefore we parametrize the two - body interactions in terms of simple spin - dependent operators and gaussian radial shapes .",
    "we require that the relevant measured @xmath3- and @xmath1-wave scattering lengths as well as the singlet @xmath3-wave effective range are reproduced by the nucleon - nucleon interaction .",
    "the neutron - core interaction is adjusted to reproduce the size and binding energy of @xmath0li and selected properties of @xmath2li . the initial three - body wave function can now be accurately computed .",
    "the halo nucleus reacts with a light target nucleus and one of the three particles is removed instantaneously .",
    "the final - state two - body wave function is asymptotically approaching the plane wave limit , but at smaller distances is influenced by the interaction between the remaining particles .",
    "we include this modification by a distorted wave approximation .",
    "this final - state two - body interaction is identically the same as the interaction entering in the computation of the initial three - body wave function .",
    "we maintain this consistency throughout the paper .",
    "the model is now completely defined and we proceed to compute the transition matrix element which describes the probabilities for the various break - up processes .",
    "we integrate away analytically or numerically all non - observed quantities and end up with expressions for the observable momentum distributions of the remaining particles .",
    "both one- and two - dimensional distributions are computed . to compare with the experimental results we tranform the particle momenta to the center of mass of the three - body halo nucleus .",
    "this is a straightforward but technically rather lengthy procedure .",
    "numerical results are presented to illustrate general aspects .",
    "we first assume a spin - less core and vary the @xmath3 and @xmath1-state properties of the neutron - core system .",
    "the physical parameters are the energy of the lowest virtual @xmath3-state , the energy of the lowest @xmath1-resonance and the @xmath1-wave admixture in the neutron - core subsystem of the three - body wave function .",
    "the size and binding energy of the three - body system is left unchanged at values corresponding to @xmath0li .",
    "three different momentum distributions can be calculated , i.e. ( i ) the core momentum distribution after neutron removal , ( ii ) the neutron momentum distribution after neutron removal and ( iii ) the neutron momentum distribution in a core break - up reaction .",
    "they each carry different information . for ( i ) the effects of final state interactions increase and the widths of the distributions decrease with increasing @xmath3-wave content of the neutron - core subsystem .",
    "the centrifugal barrier is crucial for this behavior . for ( ii )",
    "the final state interaction is crucial and the momentum distributions strongly depend on the structure of the continuum spectrum of the neutron - core subsystem .",
    "the lower the virtual state or resonances the larger the effect . for ( iii )",
    "the well known neutron - neutron final state interaction has a significant effect on the distributions while the properties of the neutron - core subsystem are less important .",
    "the effects of finite core spin are necessary for realistic comparison with experimental data for halo nuclei .",
    "the resulting spin splitting of the lowest virtual @xmath3-states in the neutron - core system seems to produce quantitative and perhaps even qualitative differences .",
    "however , in most cases only the statistically weighted average energy is important due to the constraints from the pauli principle , the parity conservation and the known energy of the three - body system .",
    "one exception occurs when the two - body final - state total angular momentum is measured in addition to the momentum distributions .",
    "then the angular momentum of the relative state is determined and only one of the @xmath3-states contributes .",
    "the large difference , due to final state interactions , between the momentum distributions from the spin split states can in this way be observed .",
    "finally , we perform realistic calculations for @xmath0li and compare with the avalaible experimental data . since the final state neutron - neutron interaction is well known , core break - up reactions constitute a good test of the method used to incorporate final state interactions in the description of the process .",
    "the uncertainties involved in the calculation are therefore reduced .",
    "the other type of process , neutron removal reactions involve the structure of the unbound system @xmath2li ( @xmath6li + n ) , that simultaneously is crucial for the structure of the @xmath0li three - body projectile .",
    "the comparison with the experimental data permits us to conclude that the final state interaction is an essential ingredient in the computation of the momentum distributions , even for core momentum distributions .",
    "the @xmath1-wave content in the neutron-@xmath6li subsystem has been concluded to be between 20% and 30% . from the longitudinal core momentum distribution and the radial neutron momentum distribution for a neutron removal process",
    "we conclude that the energy of the lowest virtual @xmath3-state in @xmath2li must be between 30 kev and 200 kev . to improve the uncertainties in these conclusions , more accurate experimental data for neutron momentum distributions for low values of the momentum",
    "would be very helpful .    in conclusion , a consistent model has been developed to analyze momentum distributions of the particles after high - energy fragmentation reactions of three - body halo systems .",
    "final state interactions are essential .",
    "application to @xmath0li and comparison with available data led to rather severe constraints on the properties of both @xmath0li and the unbound @xmath2li nucleus . + * acknowledgments * we want to thank b. jonson and k. riisager for useful discussions and for making the latest experimental data available .",
    "one of us ( e.g. ) acknowledges support from the european union through the human capital and mobility program contract nr .",
    "we consider a system of three particles with masses @xmath189 and coordinates @xmath190 ( @xmath191 ) .",
    "the jacobi coordinates are defined as @xmath192 where @xmath30 is a cyclic permutation of @xmath31 , and @xmath33 is an arbitrary normalization mass .    from these definitions",
    "we find the momenta @xmath193 and @xmath194 to be : @xmath195 @xmath196 where @xmath197 , @xmath198 , and @xmath199 are the momenta of the three particles .",
