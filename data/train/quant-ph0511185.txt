    "most quantum information processing tasks require at some stage the transfer of quantum states between two quantum systems such as atoms or ions which are located a different positions in space .",
    "for transfer over long distances , photons sent through optical fibres seem promising .",
    "however the interactions between photons and the stationary systems , e.g. atoms , are weak and need to be controlled with high precision for transferring the state onto the photon and vice versa .",
    "finding alternative methods and carriers is thus of considerable interest , in particular for transfer over short distances . here",
    ", using condensed matter systems , e.g. a piece of solid , seems very appealing .",
    "therefore the possibilities of transferring quantum information with strongly coupled quantum many body systems such as spin chains have been studied in some detail in recent years and several scenarios showing close to perfect state transfer have been found @xcite .",
    "one question arises naturally in this context : how do the properties of the employed many body system relate to the transfer quality and speed ?",
    "a key property in this context is whether those systems feature an energetic gap between their ground state and excited states .",
    "most interestingly , this gap vanishes at the critical points of quantum phase transitions @xcite , where , at zero temperature , the ground state and an excited state exchange their roles as a parameter in the hamiltonian , such as a magnetic field , is varied .    as with classical phase transitions",
    ", quantum phase transitions are usually analysed in terms of the scaling behaviour of equilibrium properties , where a diverging correlation length is indicative of a critical point @xcite .",
    "an analogous scaling phenomenon was recently also found for the entanglement properties of a spin chain in the vicinity of a quantum phase transition @xcite . motivated by these findings and the recent experimental observation of the mott quantum phase transition in the well - controlled environment of an optical lattice @xcite",
    ", the dynamical entanglement properties of quantum many body systems undergoing a quantum phase transition are receiving increasing attention .",
    "for example , one recent approach @xcite was concerned with the dynamics of bipartite entanglement in spin chains resulting from an initial perturbation , while another studied the entanglement of two spins that are globally coupled to a quantum critical system @xcite . on another level , the zurek - kibble mechanism for classical phase transitions",
    "was recently generalised to its quantum analogue , further deepening our insight into the dynamics of quantum phase transitions @xcite .    in this article",
    "we study the relation between the size of the spectral gap of a quantum many body system and its capacity to transfer quantum information . specifically , we study the transfer of quantum states for two examples of linear chains of interacting quantum systems .",
    "we employ newly developed matrix product state techniques @xcite to simulate numerically the dynamics of spin chains exhibiting a quantum phase transition",
    ". then we proceed to study a harmonic chain where we may choose the on - site potential such that the energy gap above the unique ground state vanishes .",
    "the latter of the two models allows us to obtain a better understanding of the relevant physics since it permits an analytical study in terms of master equations and the verification of the validity of the assumptions inherent in the master equation by numerically simulating the dynamics of the harmonic chain with up to @xmath0 constituents @xcite .",
    "we find that the transfer properties crucially depend on the energy gap between the ground state and the lowest excited states , but does not significantly dependent on the detailed structure of the hamiltonian .",
    "in particular the transfer the characteristics of the state transfer through such systems may therefore be used to detect the critical point experimentally .",
    "we begin by considering a 1-d chain of spins with nearest neighbour interactions and open boundary conditions .",
    "the hamiltonian of our model reads @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the number of spins , @xmath3 is an applied magnetic field and @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 the interaction between neighboring spins .",

    "however , for finite distances no exact expression for the time dependent correlation functions is known @xcite .",
    "this is due to the fact that the subspaces of odd and of even number of fermions can not be diagonalised simultaneously .",
    "an attempt of an approximation restricted to only one subspace led to reasonable results for some parameter values but occasionally produced unphysical solutions which grew exponentially in time .",
    "therefore , such a master equation approach can not be considered reliable for our spin chains and was avoided .    to confirm the validity of the master equation approach for the harmonic chain , we compared it to results of a numerical simulation of a chain with 1400 oscillators .",
    "since the hamiltonians of harmonic oscillators and harmonic chains are quadratic in the position and momentum operators , gaussian states ( states with a gaussian wigner function ) remain gaussian throughout the time evolution . for these states the complete dynamics can thus be obtained by only considering the evolution of the covariance matrix ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "we found good agreement between our analytical and numerical solutions , with the relative errors being less than @xmath146 .",
    "the observed effects may also be formulated in quantum information language . in this way",

    "a possible initial state is @xmath148 the transfer of the entanglement across the chain may now be analysed by considering the entanglement between @xmath8 and @xmath147 as a function of time .",
    "since we assume@xmath14 , the state @xmath149 is by virtue of energy conservation approximately stationary , while the evolution of @xmath150 is the same as above ( modulo a phase ) . since states with more than one excitation are energetically not accessible , the logarithmic negativity @xcite for the reduced density matrix of @xmath8 and @xmath147 can be expressed approximately as @xmath151 hence , in this model @xmath152 implies that the entanglement has been transferred perfectly , too .",
    "the reference spin @xmath147 is initially maximally entangled with the sender @xmath7 , left plot .",
    "if an excitation , which was initially in @xmath7 gets perfectly transferred to @xmath8 , the entanglement will then be shared between @xmath8 and @xmath147 , right plot.,title=\"fig:\",width=151 ]   the reference spin @xmath147 is initially maximally entangled with the sender @xmath7 , left plot . if an excitation , which was initially in @xmath7 gets perfectly transferred to @xmath8 , the entanglement will then be shared between @xmath8 and @xmath147 , right plot.,title=\"fig:\",width=151 ]",
    "in conclusion , we have considered entanglement and excitation transfer through strongly coupled quantum many body systems . in particular we have studied the dependence of the transfer quality and speed on the size of the spectral gap between the ground and the lowest excited state of the considered system .    as a first main result",
    ", we find that the quality of transfer , and hence the quantum channel capacity , can be almost perfect whenever there is a finite , sufficiently large energy gap above the ground state .",
    "this opens up a generic way to design good quantum channels by using gapped systems , since the gap ensures high transfer quality irrespective of the system s details .    on approaching quantum critical points , the spectral gap shrinks and the transfer decreases in quality , but accelerates .",
    "this second main result suggests a possible experimental determination of the energy gap : if one finds in an experiment that the energy is not completely transferred from one ancilla to the other , one can infer that the energy gap is smaller than the available energy .",
    "the bound can be made tighter by lowering the energy available in the `` sender '' ancilla .",
    "this procedure might in particular be helpful for cold atom systems in optical lattices , where standard spectroscopy is not applicable .",
    "a quantitative study of the scaling of the transfer quality and time in between the two detected scenarios and its relation to critical exponents of various quantum phase transition universality classes @xcite should be a subject of future research . in that way an approach that originated in quantum information considerations might open up a new way to characterise and experimentally detect quantum phase transitions .",
