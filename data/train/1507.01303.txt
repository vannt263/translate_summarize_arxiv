    "the first gamma - ray burst ( grb ) afterglow emission was detected in 1997 , e.g. x - ray and optical afterglow from grb 970228 @xcite . over 18 years a variety of space- and ground - based facilities",
    "have detected hundreds of afterglows , with a wide coverage in both the spectral and temporal domains ( * ? ? ?",
    "* for a recent review ) .",
    "the standard interpretation for the grb afterglow emission was proposed before the discovery of the first afterglow data @xcite .",
    "the general picture is as follows ( * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) : regardless of the nature of progenitor and central engine , grbs are believed to originate from a  fireball \" moving at a relativistic speed .",
    "the fireball will inevitably be decelerated through a pair of shocks ( forward and reverse ) propagating into the ambient medium and the fireball itself .",
    "electrons are accelerated in both shocks and give rise to bright non - thermal emission through synchrotron or inverse compton radiation . due to the deceleration of the fireball , a broad band afterglow emission with power - law rising and decaying behavior",
    "is expected for the grb afterglow .    in the pre-_swift",
    "_ era , the simple external shock model provided successful interpretations for a large array of afterglow data @xcite , although moderate revisions were sometimes required , for instance , invoking wind - type density medium instead of constant density @xcite , refining the joint forward shock and reverse shock signal @xcite , considering continuous energy injection into the blastwave @xcite , taking into account the jet break effect @xcite , etc . entering the _ swift _ era , some new unexpected signatures in grb afterglows were revealed @xcite , which however are still acommodated within the standard framework , provided some additional physical processes are invoked self - consistently , such as a late central engine activity @xcite .",
    "the external shock model is elegant in its simplicity , since it invokes a limited number of model parameters ( e.g. the total energy of the system , the ambient density and its profile ) , and has well defined predicted spectral and temporal properties .",
    "given this model , the accumulation of afterglow data has led to great advances in revealing physical properties in grb ejecta as well as the circum - burst medium . in practice , there are two approaches for applying the external shock model to the observational data : one can start with the data , fit the lightcurve and spectrum with some empirical broken power - law functions to get both a temporal index @xmath14 and a spectral index @xmath15 , and then constrain the related afterglow parameters by applying the so called  closure relation \" @xcite ; or alternatively , one can start with the external shock model , draw predicted lightcurves and spectrum with varying parameters , and then constrain the relevant parameters by fitting the observational data with the theoretical prediction .",
    "both approaches encounter their own difficulties .",
    "the first approach is usually non - optional , since some complicated effects such as the equal arrival time effect and the gradual evolution of cooling frequency result in a smoothing of the spectral and temporal breaks @xcite , leading to imperfection of the  closure relation \" . for the latter approach , due to the simple behavior of the afterglow data and the simple power - law property of the synchrotron external shock model , the model parameters obtained by fitting individual bursts usually suffer severe degeneracy , unless the observed sed could fully cover all synchrotron characteristic frequencies ( kumar & zhang 2015 for a review ) , e.g. @xmath16 ( self - absorption frequency ) , @xmath0 ( the characteristic synchrotron frequency of the electrons at the minimum injection energy ) , and @xmath17 ( the cooling frequency ) . for the cases that all the observations are in the same spectral regime or only covers one break frequency , which usually happened when only optical and x - ray data are available , individual fitting can not make tight constraint on the parameters such as @xmath12 and @xmath9 , even though the model calculated lightcurve could nicely fit the data",
    "( e.g. see the recent results presented in japelj et al .",
    "2014 ) .    regardless of these difficulties",
    ", both approaches work best with the observational data in the early stages , which contain much richer information . on the other hand , although multi - wavelength observations are routinely carried out for many grbs , optical data are still generally the most valuable for model constraint .",
    "the reason is as follows : first , data in the radio band are still limited , although several radio lightcurves have been interpreted in detail and some interesting studies have been performed statistically ( * ? ? ? * and reference therein ) .",
    "second , the x - ray lightcurves are sometimes dominated by the x - ray flares and x - ray plateaus , which can not be fully interpreted with the simple external shock model , additional physical processes , such as a radiation component that is related to the late central engine activity , are needed @xcite .",
    "last but not least , in the early stage , the reverse shock spectrum is expected to peak in the optical band .",
    "investigation of reverse shock emission is very important for studying the detailed features of grb ejecta , such as the composition of the jet , since its radiation comes directly from the shocked ejecta materials .    assuming that afterglow parameters for different grbs come from the same distributions , statistical properties of a sample of grbs can be used to constrain the global features of model parameters .",
    "for instance , in the pre-_swift _ era , @xcite proposed to categorize the early optical afterglows into different types of combinations of reverse and forward shock emission and they suggested that the afterglow parameter space could be explored based on a morphological analysis .",
    "after a decade of successful operation of _ swift _ , a fairly good sample of early afterglow lightcurves is in hand .",
    "it is now of great interest to develop and implement the morphological analysis on the current observations to make reasonable constraints on the model parameters .",
    "specifically , the morphological analysis method can be divided into two separate parts : monte carlo simulations and observational sample analysis . in the simulation part ,",
    "we assume some intrinsic distributions for each afterglow parameter , simulate a sample of afterglow lightcurves , and then distribute them into their relevant lightcurve types . in the sample analysis part",
    ", we try to find a well defined sample of early optical lightcurves , and calculate the relative number ratios among different lightcurve types . by comparing the results between these two parts ,",
    "one can make constraints on relevant parameters .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows .",
    "we illustrate the morphological analysis method and the sample selection process in section 2 , including the definition of different lightcurve categories , and the theoretical scheme for determining categories for given values of the afterglow parameters . in section 3 , we apply the morphological analysis to the grb sample with monte carlo simulations , and explore the parameter regimes by comparing the simulation results and observations .",
    "we discuss our results in section 4 , and briefly summarize our conclusions in section 5 . throughout the paper ,",
    "the convention @xmath18 is adopted for cgs units .",
    "the morphology of early optical afterglows essentially reflects the relative relation between the forward shock and the reverse shock emission .",
    "since the strength of the forward and reverse shocks are determined by the same set of grb parameters , namely the initial lorentz factor , the kinetic energy of the fireball , the circum - burst density and the microphysics parameters , in principle a study of the morphology can yield direct model constraints .    in previous works ,",
    "the early optical afterglows for constant density medium model were usually classified into three categories @xcite :    * type i : re - brightening . at the very early stage ,",
    "the lightcurve is dominated by the reverse shock emission , but later a re - brightening signature emerges due to the forward shock emission contribution .",
    "both reverse shock peak and forward shock peak are evident in this type of lightcurve . *",
    "type ii : flattening .",
    "the forward shock peak is beneath the reverse shock component .",
    "the forward shock emission only shows its decaying part at the late stage , since the reverse shock component fades more rapidly . *",
    "type iii : no reverse shock component . in this case",
    ", the reverse shock component is either too weak compared with the forward shock emission , or is completely suppressed for some reason , such as magnetic fields dominating the ejecta @xcite .",
    "note that for forward shock dominated cases ( type iii ) , there are still two distinct shapes of lightcurve , depending on whether @xmath19 is larger than @xmath20 or not , where @xmath21 is the reverse shock crossing time @xcite . if @xmath22 , the rising slope of the lightcurve would have a very clear steep ( @xmath23 or @xmath24 ) to shallow ( @xmath25 ) transition , otherwise the rising slope is always steep . since an insight on",
    "the @xmath19 value could lead to strong constraints on relevant afterglow parameters , in this work we further categorize the forward shock dominated lightcurves into two categories :    * type iii : forward shock dominated lightcurves without @xmath26 crossing .",
    "the observed optical peak is the deceleration peak . * type iv : forward shock dominated lightcurves with @xmath26 crossing .",
    "the observed optical peak is the @xmath26 crossing peak .",
    "figure [ fig : typeshow ] shows the example light curves for all four types with typical afterglow parameters .",
    "consider a uniform relativistic shell ( fireball ejecta ) with an isotropic equivalent energy @xmath27 , initial lorentz factor @xmath28 , and observed width @xmath29 , expanding into a homogeneous interstellar medium ( ism ) with particle number density @xmath30 at a redshift @xmath31 . during the initial interaction ,",
    "a pair of shocks develop : a forward shock propagating into the medium and a reverse shock propagating into the shell . after the reverse shock crosses the shell ( at @xmath21 ) , the forward shock follows the blandford - mckee self - similar solution @xcite .",
    "synchrotron emission is expected behind both shocks , since electrons are accelerated at the shock fronts via the 1st - order fermi acceleration mechanism , and magnetic fields are believed to be generated behind the shocks due to plasma instabilities ( for forward shock ) @xcite or shock compression amplification of the magnetic field carried by the central engine ( for reverse shock ) .",
    "the instantaneous synchrotron spectrum at a given epoch can be described with three characteristic frequencies @xmath16 , @xmath0 , and @xmath17 , and the peak synchrotron flux density @xmath32 @xcite . the evolution of these four parameters can be calculated , with the help of notations to parameterize the microscopic processes , i.e. the fractions of shock energy that go to electrons and magnetic fields ( @xmath12 and @xmath9 ) , and the electron spectral index @xmath33 .",
    "it is then straightforward to calculate the lightcurve for a given observed frequency ( e.g. optical frequency @xmath34 ) , @xmath35 where the superscript @xmath36 and @xmath37 represent reverse and forward shock respectively .",
    "+   +    in principle , the morphology for a specific grb can be determined once the entire optical lightcurve is calculated . however , this process is time consuming and not conducive for realizing monte carlo simulation to explore a large parameter space . however , exploiting the power - law behavior of the afterglow emission , here we propose an efficient scheme to categorize the lightcurve type , by comparing the reverse shock and forward shock flux strength at some special time point , rather than comparing them for the entire duration .",
    "the detailed scheme is illustrated as follows :    the dynamical evolution during the reverse shock crossing phase can be classified into two cases @xcite , depending on whether the reverse shock becomes relativistic in the frame of the unshocked shell material ( thick shell case ) or not ( thin shell case ) .",
    "since the emissions from both reverse shock and forward shock behave differently in each case , our first step is to determine the thin / thick properties for given set of parameters .",
    "one practical way is to compare the duration of the burst @xmath38 and the deceleration time of the ejecta @xmath39 , i.e. , @xmath40 is for thick shell case and @xmath41 is for thin shell case , and @xmath42 @xcite .    for the thin shell case , before shock crossing time",

    ", we omit the superscript of @xmath49 and @xmath50 . with the expression of @xmath21",
    ", the values of @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 at the shock crossing time could be easily obtained .",
    "consequently , with the temporal evolution power - law indices of these parameters @xcite , one can calculate their values for the post shock crossing phase . at @xmath21",
    ", we have @xmath51 where @xmath52 factor is normalized to @xmath53 .",
    "we can see that for the time we are interested in ( e.g. , mainly around or after @xmath21 ) , both reverse shock and forward shock emission would be in the `` slow cooling '' regime ( @xmath54 ) for reasonable parameter regimes ) might be relevant at the shock crossing time .",
    "however , in those cases , @xmath55 could not be much smaller than @xmath56 , so that the real lightcurve shape would not deviate too much from the ones presented here ( under the slow cooling assumption ) . ]",
    "we take slow cooling for both reverse and forward shock emission in the following , so that the shape of the light curve essentially depends on the relation between @xmath57 and @xmath34 ( similar arguments also apply to the thick shell case ) .",
    "the evolution of @xmath57 for the thin shell case is shown in figure [ fig : illustration]a , which reads @xmath58 when @xmath59 is larger than @xmath34 , we call it fs i case ( otherwise fs ii case ) , and @xmath60 would cross the optical band once ( at @xmath61 ) .",
    "similarly when @xmath62 is larger than @xmath34 , we call it rs i case ( otherwise rs ii case ) , and @xmath63 would cross the optical band twice ( at @xmath64 and @xmath65 ) .",

    "we fit their initial decaying phase with a single power - law function , and keep the bursts which have a decaying slope larger than 1.5 as candidates for type i or type ii .",
    "other bursts with relatively slower slopes are excluded from the following analysis since in principle they could belong to any one of the four types .",

    "for type i / ii candidates , we fit their lightcurves with two separate broken power - law components .",

    "we count these as an overlapping type in the following analysis .",
    "eventually , we find 3 type i bursts ( @xmath1 ) , 12 type ii bursts ( @xmath2 ) , 30 type iii bursts ( @xmath3 ) , 8 type iv bursts ( @xmath4 ) and 10 type iii / iv bursts ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "the lightcurves for each type are shown in figure [ fig : lightcurve ] and their properties are collected in table 3 , including the grb name , the onset rising slope , decaying slope , peak time , peak flux and lightcurve type .",
    "in principle , if the intrinsic distribution function for each parameter listed in equation [ eq : para ] is available , we can simulate a sample of afterglow lightcurves , and distribute them into their relevant categories with the aforementioned theoretical scheme .",
    "the properties of the parameter distributions could in turn be constrained by comparing the simulation results with the observational results collected in section [ sec : sample ] .    in the literature , several statistical works have been done through fitting individual bursts , either for late @xcite or early @xcite broad - band observations .",

    "even if the adopted distribution functions may be deviated from the intrinsic ones , it is still possible to justify how each parameter affects the result of morphological analysis .",

    "the greatest challenge for the morphological analysis method arises from the sample selection .",
    "it is difficult to achieve the completeness of a certain sample , unless a sufficiently large number of triggered grbs can be rapidly followed - up in the optical band . on the other hand , systematic uncertainties could become large , and would be difficult to remove , if the afterglow follow - ups are obtained through different telescopes . a future dedicated facility with rapid response ability and wide field of view could help with these issues , and this is a key element in the chinese - french mission svom , the ground wide angle cameras ( gwacs ) @xcite .",
    "another challenge comes from the process of assigning the observed lightcurves into relevant categories . to better identify the type iii and type iv ,",
    "sufficient data points in the rising phase are required , while to precisely distinguish type i from type ii , observations in the decaying phase need to be dense enough .",

    "the theoretical scheme for determining lightcurve categories is based on the standard synchrotron external shock model . despite its great success ,",
    "the standard model has some limitations that sometimes hinder a precise description of grb afterglows .",
    "for instance , the real evolution of @xmath43 may deviates from a power - law behavior when @xmath115 is around @xmath21 , so that both the reverse shock and forward shock lightcurves should have a smooth transition around the peak , especially when equal arrival time effects are considered .",
    "these deviations may affect our results over some limited range of parameter spaces , e.g. , when @xmath116 is close to @xmath117 .",
    "such effects may average themselves out , as long as the simulated sample is large enough . in principle , one can use numerical simulations to calculate more precise lightcurves for given set of parameters , but this will dramatically increase the computation time while most of the calculations are redundant for the purpose of morphological analysis .    due to the limitations of the current facilities ,",
    "the sample selected in this work is still incomplete in some sense .",
    "as mentioned in section 2.3 , only 114 swift bursts have optical follow - up within 500 s , and some of them are hard to classify because of lack of sufficient data points in the rising phase .",
    "the incompleteness may cause some uncertainty in the parameter constraint results , but the general tendency of our results should be reliable in order of magnitude , e.g. , @xmath11 should be in order of 0.01 and @xmath10 should be in order of 100 .",
    "the analysis in this work is designed for a homogeneous interstellar medium . for grbs occurring in a wind type environment ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the lightcurves are easy to distinguish from what is discussed here , and these may thus be excluded during the sample selection phase @xcite .",
    "with decades of data accumulation and the prospects for future facilities , the grb afterglow field is entering the era of big data .",
    "it is essential to find efficient methods to provide insights into the general features of grb afterglows from the study of large samples . in this work ,",
    "we have developed and implemented a morphological analysis method using monte carlo simulations , and find that such a morphological analysis applied to early optical afterglows can efficiently constrain the microscopic parameters , e.g. , @xmath11 , @xmath90 and @xmath10 . to reproduce the current observational data , @xmath11 distributed around @xmath118",

    "if our interpretation is correct , two important implications can be inferred : 1 ) the preferred @xmath11 value is smaller than the commonly assumed value of @xmath120 . as a result , the same level of afterglow flux corresponds to a larger kinetic energy , which makes the measured radiative efficiency ( @xmath121 , lloyd- ronning & zhang 2004 ) lower than previously derived values .",
    "the internal shock models have suffered the criticism of a relatively low energy dissipation efficiency @xcite , which is typically a few percent .",
    "a lower @xmath12 in the external shock would mitigate the  low efficiency problem \" of the internal shock model , if @xmath12 during the prompt emission phase ( in the internal shocks ) is large ( say , @xmath13 ) .",
    "this may be achievable if the relatively low @xmath12 as found in this paper is only relevant for extremely relativistic shocks , so that the mildly relativistic internal shocks may retain a relatively large @xmath12 ; 2 ) values of @xmath122 correspond to @xmath123 , which is in agreement with the results of previous works which indicate a moderately magnetized baryonic grb jet @xcite .                                                ,",
