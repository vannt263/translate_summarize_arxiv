    "<S> a general quantum measurement on an unknown quantum state enables us to estimate what the state originally was . </S>",
    "<S> simultaneously , the measurement has a destructive effect on a measured quantum state which is reflected by the decrease of the output fidelity . </S>",
    "<S> we show for any @xmath0-level system that quantum non - demolition ( qnd ) measurement controlled by a suitably prepared ancilla is a measurement in which the decrease of the output fidelity is minimal . </S>",
    "<S> the ratio between the estimation fidelity and the output fidelity can be continuously controlled by the preparation of the ancilla . </S>",
    "<S> different measurement strategies on the ancilla are also discussed . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we propose a feasible scheme of such a measurement for atomic and optical @xmath1-level systems based on basic controlled - not gate .    </S>",
    "<S> measurement in quantum mechanics changes drastically measured quantum state . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , this change can not be done arbitrarily small . </S>",
    "<S> this main feature of quantum measurement can be simply proved by performing the estimation of the state after the measurement . at first sight </S>",
    "<S> this is a negative effect which does not allow many operations well known from classical physics . </S>",
    "<S> fortunately , there is also a positive aspect of this property . in principle </S>",
    "<S> , it can be exploited to make communication between two distant stations secure against eavesdropping attacks . </S>",
    "<S> namely , secret information can be sent by quantum states in such a way that any measurement on the transmitted states can be detected and consequently any attack on the link can be revealed @xcite . this property represents a fundamental distinction between quantum measurement and classical measurement that can be made in principle state non - destructive . </S>",
    "<S> such an ideal classical measurement has a quantum analogue called _ quantum non - demolition _ ( qnd ) </S>",
    "<S> measurement @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the qnd measurement is non - destructive in the sense that is preserves probabilistic distribution of so called _ non - demolition _ </S>",
    "<S> variable of the measured system and simultaneously , the measurement results give a perfect copy of the non - demolition variable statistics . from this point of view </S>",
    "<S> , they can be used as a perfect distributor of information encoded in the non - demolition variable of a quantum state . </S>",
    "<S> all noise arising in the measurement process is transfered to the complementary variables . </S>",
    "<S> the present work is devoted to ( 1 ) the analysis of the fundamental property of the qnd measurement and ( 2 ) to the feasible application of the qnd measurement for optimal distribution of information encoded in an unknown system variable .    </S>",
    "<S> suppose alice is given a @xmath0-level quantum system @xmath2 ( qu@xmath0it s ) in an _ unknown _ pure state @xmath3 and she sends the state to bob . </S>",
    "<S> suppose there is eve between alice and bob that wants to guess this state whereas disturbing it to the least possible extent . </S>",
    "<S> for this purpose eve can measure the state directly by a projective measurement and based on the outcomes of the measurement she can guess the state . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , eve can guess the state from measurement on an ancillary system that previously interacted with the original state . </S>",
    "<S> both the strategies produce two states , an estimate of the original state that is hold by eve @xmath4 and an output state @xmath5 after the measurement that continues toward bob . the quality of eve s guesses can be characterized by the mean fidelity @xmath6 ( estimation fidelity ) defined as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the integral over the space of pure states and @xmath9 is the measure invariant with respect to unitary transformations . </S>",
    "<S> the perturbation introduced by eve to the original state can be characterized by the mean fidelity @xmath10 ( output fidelity ) of the output state @xmath11 . according to the laws of quantum mechanics </S>",
    "<S> the fidelities @xmath10 and @xmath6 must satisfy the following inequality @xcite : @xmath12 the inequality sets a tightest bound between the mean fidelity @xmath6 of estimation of an unknown state from a general deterministic quantum operation on a single qu@xmath0it and the mean fidelity @xmath10 of the state after the operation . </S>",
    "<S> particularly important are quantum operations that saturate the inequality ( [ banaszekd ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> namely , these operations introduce the least possible disturbance to the original state in the sense that for a given estimation fidelity @xmath6 they provide the highest possible output fidelity @xmath10 .    in this article </S>",
    "<S> we show generally for a qu@xmath0it that a perfect qnd measurement randomly performed along all the basis in the hilbert space which is controlled by a quantum state of ancilla saturates the inequality ( [ banaszekd ] ) . in particular , such the qnd measurement for a single qubit can be implemented by the basic controlled - not ( cnot ) operation . </S>",
    "<S> the perfect qnd measurement means that eve has a perfect copy of statistics of the non - demolition variable . </S>",
    "<S> further , we discuss in detail an imperfect qnd measurement and we compare influence of different discriminations of ancillary states </S>",
    "<S> . finally , we shortly summarize feasible experimental implementations of the proposed measurement scheme and discuss open problems stimulating future research .    </S>",
    "<S> our protocol depicted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] consists of two steps . at the outset we consider the protocol without twirling operations @xmath13 and @xmath14 . in the first step the qu@xmath0it @xmath2 in an unknown state @xmath3 </S>",
    "<S> is coupled by the two - qu@xmath0it unitary interaction @xmath15 to another ancillary qu@xmath0it @xmath16 . in the second step </S>",
    "<S> the information about the state @xmath3 is gained from a suitable projective measurement on the ancilla and it is converted into the state of another qu@xmath0it @xmath17 . in order the operation to saturate the inequality ( [ banaszekd ] ) the interaction @xmath15 must satisfy two following conditions . </S>",
    "<S> first , there must exist a normalized vector @xmath18 of the ancilla @xmath16 such that @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the orthonormal bases in the state spaces of the qu@xmath0it @xmath2 and @xmath16 , respectively , and @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> the interaction ( [ 1 ] ) represents a perfect qnd coupling . </S>",
    "<S> second , there must exist a normalized vector @xmath22 that `` switches off '' the interaction @xmath15 , i. e. @xmath23 obviously , performing the measurement on the ancilla after the transformation ( [ 2 ] ) in the basis @xmath20 gives no information on the input state . </S>",
    "<S> now we show that if an unitary interaction @xmath15 satisfies the two conditions then it can be used to construct a quantum operation that saturates the inequality ( [ banaszekd ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the flow of information between the qu@xmath0it @xmath17 and the original qu@xmath0it @xmath2 can be controlled by the preparation of the ancilla @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> let us assume that the ancilla is prepared in the superposition @xmath24 and @xmath25 are positive real numbers satisfying the normalization condition @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> the interaction @xmath15 transforms the state as @xmath27 .    </S>",
    "<S> \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then , the ancilla is measured in the basis @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> if the ancilla is found in the state @xmath28 then eve prepares her qu@xmath0it @xmath17 in the state @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> the proposed scheme realizes a general quantum operation on qu@xmath0it @xmath2 that can be described by a set of operators @xmath30 , ( @xmath31 ) . in the basis </S>",
    "<S> @xmath32 the operators are represented by diagonal matrices with elements @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 is the kronecker symbol . since the operators satisfy the resolution of unity @xmath36 the operation is deterministic and one can use the following formulas @xcite : @xmath37 hence , one obtains using eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ a ] ) that @xmath38 substituting finally these mean fidelities back into the inequality ( [ banaszekd ] ) we find that they saturate the inequality . </S>",
    "<S> this means that the fidelities ( [ fg ] ) lie for any state ( [ ancilla ] ) of ancilla on the very boundary of the quantum mechanically allowed region defined by the inequality ( [ banaszekd ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , by changing continuously the parameter @xmath39 in this state from @xmath40 to @xmath41 one can continuously move along the whole boundary from its one extreme point @xmath42 to its other extreme point @xmath43 . up to now </S>",
    "<S> we have considered the device in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] without twirling operations @xmath13 and @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> such a scheme is not universal as the output state fidelity @xmath44 is dependent on the input state @xmath45 . in order to obtain a universal device where the fidelity @xmath46 is state independent and therefore @xmath47 it is sufficient to place the qnd interaction in between two twirling operations as is depicted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , the controllable optimal quantum operation ( [ a ] ) can be implemented using the qu@xmath0it cnot gate @xmath48 defined as @xmath49 where @xmath50 denotes addition modulo @xmath0 and @xmath51 are chosen sets of basis states of qu@xmath0its @xmath2 and @xmath16 @xcite . for the cnot gate the relevant states of the ancilla satisfying the conditions ( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ 2 ] ) </S>",
    "<S> are @xmath52 and @xmath53 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> eve then measures the ancilla in the basis @xmath54 and prepares the state @xmath55 if she finds the ancilla in the state @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> notice , that optimal quantum operation saturating the inequality ( [ banaszekd ] ) can be alternatively realized via teleportation scheme with two entangled ancillas @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> a specific feature of the quantum operation ( [ a ] ) is that it is diagonal in the basis @xmath32 and thus it preserves these basis states . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , our scheme can be interpreted as the qnd measurement on the qu@xmath0it @xmath2 of some observable ( non - demolition variable ) @xmath57 with non - degenerate eigenvalues @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the qnd measurement preserving the basis states @xmath32 can be implemented with a more general class of two - qu@xmath0it unitary interactions . to illustrate this , suppose eve is given an unitary interaction @xmath15 satisfying only the condition ( [ 1 ] ) where , in addition , the states of ancilla @xmath20 are in general nonorthogonal . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , in this case eve s best strategy is to discriminate among these states and since she has no a priori information about the occurrence of the states ( the complex amplitudes @xmath59 are unknown ) the states have equal a priori probabilities . in order to preserve the deterministic character of her operation when in each run of the protocol the measurement on the ancilla uniquely determines which of the basis states @xmath60 is to be prepared she has to use an ambiguous discrimination @xcite of the states @xmath61 . in this approach </S>",
    "<S> she applies a generalized measurement @xmath62 , @xmath63 ( @xmath64,@xmath65 ) on the ancilla @xmath16 discriminating among these states and prepares the state @xmath29 if she detected @xmath66 . making use of the eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ f ] ) and </S>",
    "<S> ( [ g ] ) one then finds that @xmath67 where @xmath68 is eve s error rate . </S>",
    "<S> the present quantum operation apparently preserves the basis states @xmath32 and therefore it can be again interpreted as a qnd measurement . </S>",
    "<S> the question that can be risen in this context is whether also this qnd measurement allows to gain maximum possible information on the input state similarly as in the previously discussed scheme . </S>",
    "<S> the eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ fgn ] ) reveals that this is not the case as soon as the states @xmath61 are nonorthogonal . </S>",
    "<S> namely , eve s error rate is always greater than zero for nonorthogonal states , i. e. @xmath69 , and therefore eve s estimation fidelity will be always less that the highest possible value @xmath70 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> another interesting question is whether and when the fidelities ( [ fgn ] ) saturate the inequality ( [ banaszekd ] ) . since the fidelity @xmath10 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ fgn ] ) is independent of the measurement on the ancilla the corresponding estimation fidelity @xmath6 will be maximized if eve performs optimal discrimination of the ancillary states @xmath20 that minimizes the error rate @xmath71 . for @xmath72 the minimal error rate can be found only numerically @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , for qubits ( @xmath73 ) the minimal error rate can be calculated analytically and it is given by the formula @xmath74 @xcite.(in this formula and in what follows we drop the subscript @xmath16 in states @xmath20 ) . </S>",
    "<S> hence , using the formula and eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ fgn ] ) one obtains the output fidelity and the estimation fidelity in the form @xmath75 where @xmath76 . substituting now the fidelities into the inequality ( [ banaszekd ] ) for @xmath73 </S>",
    "<S> one finds that they are saturated only if @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is an integer . </S>",
    "<S> the undesirable phase @xmath79 can be removed and thus this optimality condition can be established by applying the phase shift @xmath80 and @xmath81 on bob s qubit after the interaction @xmath15 . as a consequence , </S>",
    "<S> any two - qubit unitary interaction @xmath15 satisfying the condition ( [ 1 ] ) supplemented by the suitable additional phase shift on a qubit @xmath2 can be used for the qnd measurement that saturates the inequality ( [ banaszekd ] ) for @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> if , however , the states @xmath82 are nonorthogonal , it is not possible to achieve the maximum possible estimation fidelity @xmath83 and therefore one can not move along the whole boundary of the region defined by the inequality ( [ banaszekd ] ) for @xmath73 by changing the state @xmath18 of the ancilla.the dependences of the fidelities @xmath10 and @xmath6 given in eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ f ] ) and ( [ g ] ) where @xmath84 on the overlap @xmath85 is depicted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] .    </S>",
    "<S> however , the maximum possible estimation fidelity can be achieved , at least on a suitable sub - ensemble , if eve replaces the ambiguous discrimination by the unambiguous discrimination @xcite of the states @xmath86 . </S>",
    "<S> this strategy can be used if the states are linearly independent and it allows to discriminate them perfectly with a certain probability @xmath87 of inconclusive result . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding generalized measurement has three components @xmath88 , @xmath89 ( @xmath90 is orthogonal state to the state @xmath91 ) and @xmath92 ( @xmath93 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the component @xmath94 corresponds to the inconclusive result and this measurement is optimal in the sense that the probability @xmath87 attains minimum possible value @xmath95 . </S>",
    "<S> apparently , if eve detects the conclusive result @xmath96 , @xmath97 then she prepares the state @xmath98 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , on the sub - ensemble corresponding to the conclusive ( @xmath99 ) results eve prepares the state @xmath100 for which the mean estimation fidelity achieves maximum possible value , i. e. @xmath101 . </S>",
    "<S> on the same sub - ensemble , bob receives the same mixed state as prepares eve whence @xmath102 . </S>",
    "<S> the obtained result clearly illustrates that if eve uses unambiguous discrimination of the states @xmath86 than in cases when she detects the conclusive result she is able to obtain the best possible estimate of the state @xmath3 even if the qnd interaction is imperfect and encodes the information on the state into the nonorthogonal states of ancilla .    to experimentally test this peculiar property of the qnd interaction , </S>",
    "<S> the experimentalists can use a recent progress in the implementations of the cnot gates between the atoms and photons . </S>",
    "<S> due to a possible long time for manipulations of qubits ( represented by long - lived electronic states ) and high efficiency of state detection , trapped and cooled ions are ideally suited for implementations of quantum operations . </S>",
    "<S> a single - ion cnot gate has been realized some time ago in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recently , a two - ion cnot gate based on @xmath103 ions in a linear paul trap which were individually addressed using focused laser beams has been implemented @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> also two - ion @xmath104-phase gate demonstrated with @xmath105 ions in a harmonic trap @xcite can be used for the same purpose . </S>",
    "<S> further , probabilistic cnot gates , where the qubits are destroyed upon failure , have been experimentally tested in optical systems . despite of the fact that these cnot gates for polarization qubits @xcite and path qubits @xcite are </S>",
    "<S> not deterministic they are sufficient to experimentally prove the fundamental trade - off between the estimation fidelity @xmath6 and the output fidelity @xmath10 . to achieve universal character of disturbance introduced into the measured state mutually inverse twirling operations @xcite have to be implemented on qubit @xmath2 before and after the qnd interaction ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] ) . in summary , in all the mentioned experimental implementations of the cnot gates the fidelity trade - off can be thus directly experimentally measured .    </S>",
    "<S> there are few important and interesting consequences that have to be noticed . </S>",
    "<S> they can stimulate broad discussion and future work . </S>",
    "<S> first , our result shows that it is allowed to achieve any optimal fidelity measurement with a minimal disturbance by `` programming '' the qnd interaction by a single program ancillary state . </S>",
    "<S> this is an interesting result in the context of a previous proof that it is not possible to programme any single - qubit unitary operation and measurement using only a single qubit program @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> more generally , any optimal fidelity measurement of a qu@xmath0it can be programmed by an ancilla with the @xmath0-dimensional hilbert space . </S>",
    "<S> a network for this optimal fidelity measurement can be proposed , for example , for qu@xmath0it with @xmath106 as it was suggested in our previous work @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> second , the effect of ambiguous discrimination of ancillary states outgoing qnd interaction has been discussed . </S>",
    "<S> as we know there is still no bound on maximal success rate for this kind of measurement on a quantum system . </S>",
    "<S> it is an open question if such the optimal measurement can be also based on the qnd interaction . </S>",
    "<S> third , in fact we decomposed optimal fidelity measurement with minimal disturbance for a single copy into two steps : programmable qnd coupling and discrimination of ancillary states . </S>",
    "<S> thus qnd interaction is not only optimal for accessing information encoded in single preferred basis but also it is optimal for universal measurement without a preferred basis . </S>",
    "<S> the difference is only in the twirling operation which effectively changes the preferred basis . for many identical copies of input state </S>",
    "<S> it is an open question if optimal fidelity measurement is based on the same method . </S>",
    "<S> can be this strategy used to approach optimal fidelity measurement on many identical copies @xcite ? at the end , the problem of the quantum complementarity and erasure for the qnd coupling is closely related @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is known that perfect two - qubit qnd coupling with arbitrary pure ancillary state is perfectly reversible if eve implements an appropriate measurement and bob performs according to the measurement results an appropriate unitary operation . </S>",
    "<S> the remaining problem to be discussed is also how the imperfect qnd coupling can be reversed using only local operations and classical communication .    in this article , </S>",
    "<S> a fundamental property of the qnd measurement came to light : performing qnd measurement randomly along all basis in hilbert space of the system the tightest bound ( [ banaszekd ] ) between the estimation fidelity @xmath6 and the output fidelity @xmath10 of the measured system can be saturated . to change optimal ratio between these fidelities </S>",
    "<S> it is sufficient to control the ancilla of the qnd measurement . </S>",
    "<S> even when the used qnd measurement is not perfect we can still optimally control the fidelity trade - off but only in a restricted range if the output ancillary states are optimally ambiguously discriminated . </S>",
    "<S> these results are not only important from the fundamental point of view but they can be used to distribute information carried by quantum state without any preferred basis . </S>"
