    "carbon stars have traditionally been searched for in optical surveys with objective - prism plates .",
    "they were selected either through , initially , c@xmath3 bands in the blue ( secchi 1868 ) or , later , through cn bands in the `` photographic infrared '' ( nassau & velghe 1964 ) .",
    "more recently carbon stars have been selected from spectroscopic data obtained in the optical range in the course of the sloan digital sky survey ( margon et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "carbon stars have also been searched for in the iras survey on the basis of an emission feature visible at 11.3 @xmath0 m in the low resolution spectra and attributed to silicon carbide ( volk & cohen 1989 ; epchtein et al .",
    "a method to find carbon stars undergoing mass loss by combining iras and near - infrared ( 15 @xmath0 m ) color indices has been proposed by epchtein et al . (",
    "this method has been successfully used by guglielmo et al .",
    "( 1993 ) to discover new infrared carbon stars .",
    "carbon stars have been found also by selecting candidates from near - infrared color indices and then performing optical spectroscopy ( mauron et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "the formation processes of our galaxy have left traces at large distances from the sun which are best seen in the form of evolved stars .",
    "the fraction of carbon stars among evolved stars is an indicator of the metallicity in the original population , and there is evidence that this fraction is increasing with galactocentric distance ( guglielmo et al .",
    "inventories of cool carbon stars are of special interest because as these objects are evolved they can be used to trace matter at large galactocentric distances out to the magellanic clouds ( ibata et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "the latest published version of the general catalog of galactic carbon stars ( cgcs ) has 6891 entries ( alksnis et al .",
    "2001 ) ; most of them have been found on objective - prism photographic plates .    in the present work ,",
    "we examine the potential of finding carbon stars by using near - infrared spectro - photometric surveys . for that purpose",
    "we use the data provided by the japanese space experiment irts .",
    "the infrared telescope in space ( irts ) is a 15-cm diameter cooled telescope , operated in space , which surveyed , by continuous scanning , @xmath17  % of the sky ( 2700 deg.@xmath4 ) with 4 infrared instruments ( murakami et al .",
    "the near - infrared spectrometer ( nirs ) is a grating spectrometer that covers two spectral ranges , 1.42.5 @xmath0 m and 2.84.0 @xmath0 m , with a spectral resolution ranging from @xmath1  20 , at short wavelengths , to @xmath1  40 at the long wavelength end .",
    "the instrument was mainly designed to study the extended infrared emission and has an entrance aperture of 8@xmath58 . however ,",
    "more than 14000 point sources were also detected as peaks ( `` events '' ) over this extended emission .",
    "their spectra are useful to probe the physical properties of late - type stars ( e.g. matsuura et al . 1999 ) .",
    "we have also exploited them to study the contribution of mass - losing agb stars to the galactic cycle of matter ( le  bertre et al .",
    "2001 , paper  i , and 2003 , paper  ii ) .",
    "hereafter we use the 2002 data release ( nirs point source catalogue psc version 1 ) which is described in yamamura et al .",
    "( 2003 ) . for each event",
    ", a spectrum was constructed from the flux measurements in every channel by fitting the scan signal templates . then the spectra corresponding to the same point source were identified and averaged .",
    "errors are estimated from the errors on each measurement and the scatter of the data points .",
    "cool carbon stars are known to show molecular absorption bands in the near - infrared range . a nirs spectrum of a bright carbon star , y tau , is presented in fig .  [ ytau_ctype_wav ] .",
    "a c@xmath3 band at 1.8 @xmath0 m , a band attributed to c@xmath3h@xmath3 at 3.8 @xmath0 m and a blend at 3.1 @xmath0 m , due to c@xmath3h@xmath3  +  hcn ( ridgway et al . 1978 ) , are clearly visible as well as the co bands at 1.6 and 2.3 @xmath0 m .",
    "the c@xmath3h@xmath3 band at 3.8 @xmath0 m may not be visible in all carbon stars : yamamura et al .",
    "( 1998 ) show that it is seen preferentially in the intermediate mass - losing stars of the class iii defined by groenewegen et al .",
    "its presence may also depend on the phase of variability ; for instance it is visible in all iso short wavelength spectrometer ( sws ) spectra of v crb except the one obtained close to maximum ( see in sect .",
    "4.2 , fig .",
    "[ vcrb ] ) , possibly an effect of the strong dependence of the c@xmath3h@xmath3 abundance on the stellar effective temperature ( matsuura et al .",
    "cn also contributes to the steep decline at the shortest wavelengths ( @xmath1  1.4@xmath0 m ) .    in general ,",
    "the 3.1 @xmath0 m blend is much deeper than the band due to c@xmath3 .",
    "however , we caution that , in the nirs spectra , the spectral resolution around 1.8 @xmath0 m is lower than around 3.1 @xmath0 m which may lead to underestimating the corresponding c@xmath3 band depth , the c@xmath3 band width being about 0.05 @xmath0 m ( lanon & wood 2000 ) . also , as the entrance aperture was larger than the point sources , the individual spectra may have been displaced slightly over the detector array hindering the perception of this c@xmath3 band",
    ". this band can be useful when the signal - to - noise ratio is marginal in the range 2.84.0 @xmath0 m ( fig .",
    "[ spec_s07313 - 1149 ] ) .",
    "also it is reassuring to detect it as the presence of c@xmath3 absorption bands is the defining characteristic of c stars in the 0.40.6 @xmath0 m region .",
    "the 3.1 @xmath0 m blend is seen even in highly reddened sources ( fig .",
    "[ spec_s19248 + 0656 ] ) although it tends to be obliterated by circumstellar dust emission .    to identify carbon stars in the nirs psc",
    ", we use the 3.1 @xmath0 m index defined in paper ii .",
    "this index gives the depth of the band ( at 3.1 @xmath0 m ) relative to the continuum ( taken at 2.9 and 3.3 @xmath0 m ) ; the maximum depth is obtained for an index value of 0.0 whereas a value @xmath1 0.5 indicates a flat spectrum .",
    "the strength of the 3.1 @xmath0 m feature has been found to be a very sensitive indicator of the c / o abundance ratio ( catchpole & whitelock 1985 ) .    in paper",
    "ii we have used this index to discriminate oxygen - rich stars from carbon - rich ones in a sample of 689 mass - losing agb stars .",
    "a histogram of this sample is presented in fig .",
    "[ histog_xfc_kl_co ] .",
    "most of the carbon stars have an index smaller than 0.45 ( only 3 sources have an index larger than 0.45 ) ; the median value is at 0.34 .",
    "on the other hand , the oxygen - rich stars have in general an index around 0.5 .",
    "we should note at this stage that there is , in principle , a difficulty with some s stars with a c / o abundance ratio close to 1 , and in particular the sc stars . if such s / sc stars show the 3.1 @xmath0 m absorption band , with our procedure , they would be recognized as c stars , although strictly speaking they are only somewhat enriched in carbon",
    ". the sc class refers to stars that show zro bands and also cn bands .",
    "some show the 3.1 @xmath0 m absorption band ( catchpole & whitelock 1985 ) as well as a band attributed to cs around 4 @xmath0 m ( aoki et al .",
    "they constitute a rare group ( only 14 sc stars are in the general catalog of s stars  stephenson 1984 ) forming a continuous sequence from s to c stars . in principle",
    ", they do not show c@xmath3 bands ( stephenson 1984 ) . as most of our sources show the c@xmath3 band at 1.8 @xmath0 m and as sc stars are rare",
    ", we do not expect a significant contamination . on the other hand ,",
    "the discovery of more such rare objects would be of interest . in the irts survey",
    ", we found only one source ( nirs19505 + 5332@xmath6bscyg@xmath6cgcs4543 ) which belongs to this class .",
    "its spectrum , for which only the odd - numbered channels were transmitted , shows clearly the absorption band at 3.1 @xmath0 m ( fig .",
    "[ bscyg ] ) .",
    "it is classified as sc8/8 by keenan & boeshaar ( 1980 ) but does not appear in stephenson ( 1984 ) .",
    "catchpole & whitelock ( 1985 ) note that the sc star bh cru which has an absorption feature at 3.1 @xmath0 m may show occasionally characteristics of a cs star ( lloyd evans 1985 ) .",
    "this is supported by the recent discussion of this star by zijlstra et al .",
    "( 2004 ) who interpret such changes as a temperature effect .",
    "finally we note that some s stars show a weak absorption band at 3.1 @xmath0 m .",
    "two such cases have been observed by iso with the sws : w aql and s cas .",
    "the near - infrared part of their spectra is shown in fig .",
    "[ isosws_waql_scas_rscl ] together with the one of a carbon star , r scl .",
    "the 3.1 @xmath0 m blend is visible clearly in r scl and w aql and seems also present in s cas .",
    "the latter source has been observed by the irts , but the 3.1 @xmath0 m band is not visible in the nirs spectrum ( see fig .  4 in paper i ) .",
    "the source w aql is not in the nirs psc ; the 3.1 @xmath0 m index measured on the iso spectrum is @xmath1 0.46 . on the other hand ,",
    "the c@xmath3h@xmath3 band at 3.8 @xmath0 m is present in the spectrum of r scl but not in the spectra of the two s stars .",
    "there is an absorption from 4.0 to 4.2 @xmath0 m due to sio in the spectrum of s cas and perhaps w aql but not in the one of r scl . at the present stage ,",
    "we conclude that some s - type stars may show the 3.1 @xmath0 m absorption band , and we suspect that they do not show the band of c@xmath3h@xmath3 at 3.8 @xmath0 m . for these stars , the 3.1 @xmath0 m seems to stay weak , and we expect that a limit of 0.45 on the index value keeps them out of our selection .    we have considered the 8879 nirs sources for which the data are of sufficiently good quality to estimate their k and l magnitudes in the eso photometric system ( see paper ii ) . among them",
    "we obtained 471 sources with a 3.1 @xmath0 m index @xmath7 0.45 .",
    "each corresponding spectrum was examined visually .",
    "we found 139 sources that unambiguously show a c@xmath3 band at 1.8 @xmath0 m and/or the blend at 3.1 @xmath0 m and 220 which are very probably not carbon - rich .",
    "the former are reported in table  [ tab_c - rich ] .",
    "most of these carbon stars can be associated with an iras and a cgcs source . however",
    ", these associations should be viewed with caution because the entrance aperture of the nirs on the sky was 8@xmath58 . also , the accuracy of the pointing reconstruction is @xmath1 2  r.m.s .",
    "some carbon stars may have been missed , for instance among the remaining 112 sources for which the nirs spectra do not have a signal - to - noise ratio sufficient to characterize them .",
    "also , we remind that some carbon stars may have a 3.1 @xmath0 m index above 0.45 : three such cases were identified in paper ii ( see also fig .  [ histog_xfc_kl_co ] ) . for clarity , we have added these 3 cases at the end of table  [ tab_c - rich ] .",
    "the majority of the 220 sources that we have rejected have a 3.1 @xmath0 m index in the range 0.400.45 . also , there are sources which show an emission band at 3.3 @xmath0 m attributed to pahs .",
    "this emission raises the flux at 3.3 @xmath0 m relative to 3.1 @xmath0 m which mimics an absorption .",
    "these `` pah '' sources , which often have a large k@xmath2l , are readily identified from their nirs spectra .",
    "finally , it is worth noting that we did not find carbon stars with a k@xmath2l color smaller than 0.4 .",
    "tanaka et al .",
    "( in preparation ) have developed a similar , but slightly different , method .",
    "they use 5 parameters to separate m , c and s stars . applying this method to 4002 nirs spectra of good quality",
    ", they find 91 carbon stars .",
    "with our procedure we have obtained all their carbon stars , but one ( nirs 07281@xmath21216 @xmath6 iras 07280@xmath21217 @xmath6 cgcs 1735 ) .",
    "this source shows a weak 3.1 @xmath0 m absorption band ( 3.1 @xmath0 m index = 0.46 ) which explains why we could not select it . for completeness",
    "we have added this source at the end of table  [ tab_c - rich ] .",
    "the incidence of carbon stars in their sample is about 0.023 ( 91/4002 ) , whereas it is about 0.016 ( 139/8879 ) in our sample .",
    "this confirms that we miss some carbon stars at low signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "the few sources ( 14 ) in table  [ tab_c - rich ] that have no cgcs counterpart can be considered as new cool carbon stars .",
    "their nirs spectra are given in fig .",
    "[ nirs_new_cs ] .",
    "it is surprising that new carbon stars are found that do not have an extreme color ( k@xmath2l @xmath7 1 ) and still are relatively bright ( k @xmath1 6 ) .",
    "perhaps they have been missed in previous surveys because they are variable .",
    "some of these new carbon stars are in fields covered by near - ir objective - prism plates obtained by one of us ( macconnell 2003 ) .",
    "these plates have been re - examined , and the results are given in the notes to table  [ tab_c - rich ] .",
    "in the upper panel of fig .  [ diag_c_kminl ] we present the 3.1 @xmath0 m index as a function of k@xmath2l. most of the 8879 nirs sources with available k and l magnitudes are in a large clump around an index value of @xmath1  0.50 and a k@xmath2l color of @xmath1  0.3 .",
    "there is a tail going horizontally to the right and composed mainly of oxygen - rich late - type stars .",
    "in addition , there is a `` plume '' going downward to the right , which is marked by a straight line in the figure .",
    "this plume is made of carbon stars as can be seen in the lower panel of the figure .",
    "this feature shows that there is a relation between the 3.1 @xmath0 m index that characterizes the carbon - rich stellar atmospheres and the k@xmath2l color in the range 0.7 to 1.4 .",
    "this color is known to be related to the present mass - loss rate of carbon stars ( le bertre 1997 ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that the same kind of plume is visible when plotting the 1.9 @xmath0 m index ( which characterizes o - rich late - type stars ) versus k@xmath2l which , for these sources , characterizes their present mass - loss rate ( le bertre & winters 1998 ) .",
    "the trend is not a perfect correlation and sources are found also to the right of the plume .",
    "this might be an effect of dust emission filling in the 3.1 @xmath0 m band in spectra of sources undergoing heavy mass loss .",
    "groenewegen et al .",
    "( 1994 ) have obtained 2.83.5 @xmath0 m spectra for 16 carbon stars with a k@xmath2l index in the range 27 .",
    "they find that the 3.1 @xmath0 m feature weakens with redder k@xmath2l color and interpret this tendency also as an effect of filling - in by dust emission .    a possible interpretation of the trend observed in fig .  [ diag_c_kminl ]",
    "is that the mass loss and the absorption band at 3.1 @xmath0 m are both increasing with the degree of development of the extended stellar atmosphere where dust is likely to form .",
    "winters et al .",
    "( 2000 ) have shown that the mass loss of red giants is favored by a low effective temperature , a low stellar mass , a high luminosity and a large pulsation amplitude .",
    "the synthetic spectra of carbon - rich agb star atmospheres obtained by loidl et al .",
    "( 1999 ) from dynamic models show that the strengths of the c@xmath3h@xmath3 and hcn features increase in the same manner , because these molecules form preferentially at low temperature ( t@xmath82500k ) in the upper atmospheric layers .",
    "we have found 14 new carbon stars in a sample of 139 sources .",
    "the c@xmath3 band at 1.8 @xmath0 m has been useful to confirm the carbon - rich nature of the sources in the cases for which the signal - to - noise ratio at 3 @xmath0 m is poor .",
    "unfortunately , the spectral resolution of the nirs around 2 @xmath0 m ( @xmath1  20 ) is not enough to define an index measuring the depth of this band .",
    "the irts survey is limited in sensitivity to k @xmath1 8 and l @xmath1 7 ; furthermore in some regions of the sky , close to the galactic plane where the level of the extended emission is increased by confusion , the sensitivity was reduced by @xmath1 2 magnitudes ( paper  ii ) .",
    "most of the carbon stars that we have identified are probably at a distance between 1 and 5 kpc from the sun ( see figure 7 in paper ii ) . extrapolating to the whole sky ,",
    "a survey like the irts would reveal @xmath1 2000 cool carbon stars with possibly 200 new ones .",
    "these estimates would rise greatly for a survey with better sensitivity , spatial resolution and spectral resolution .",
    "the advantages of searching for cool carbon stars by near - infrared spectro - photometric means are multiple .",
    "the effective temperature of n - type stars ranges from 1800 to 4000 k ( bergeat et al . 2001 ) , and they reach the maximum of their energy distribution around 2 @xmath0 m .",
    "many of them are undergoing mass loss and are surrounded by circumstellar dust shells which shift their spectra towards long wavelengths ( @xmath1 3 @xmath0 m or more ) . as a result of the energy distribution , the infrared data provides also a more direct determination of the luminosity than those obtained in the optical .",
    "furthermore , carbon stars are often variable with an amplitude which decreases with wavelength ; therefore , it is less likely to miss a star that is at minimum if the survey is done at a long wavelength .",
    "there is also a general advantage of the infrared range for detecting sources in regions of the galaxy which are affected by dust extinction ( `` zone of avoidance '' ) .",
    "finally , as cool carbon - star spectra are characterized by wide molecular bands , a spectral resolution of @xmath9 40 is enough to clearly recognize them . with spectro - photometry",
    "it is easy to build photometric indices targeted to specific classes of sources . on the other hand , our experience ( sect .",
    "3 ) shows that the availability of a continuous spectrum over a large wavelength range is useful to identify the sources that contaminate the samples which are extracted on the basis of these photometric indices : the same data are used to select candidates and to confirm them .",
    "there are other categories of carbon stars , the majority being found in the r and ch classes .",
    "the r stars are a mix of giants with effective temperature lower than @xmath1 5000 k , in general non - variable , and of classical cool carbon stars ( late r type/ n type ) .",
    "the r stars proper ( excluding n type ) are too faint to be on the agb and do not show evidence of mass loss",
    ". they may owe their carbon enrichment to an he - core flash ( dominy 1984 ) and , perhaps , to a coalescence in a binary system ( mcclure 1997 ) .",
    "they are more easily selected by isolating the early r0r4 sub - types .",
    "a search for r stars in the nirs psc was performed by cross - correlating the positions in the psc with those in the cgcs catalogue ( alksnis et al .",
    "we found several associations .",
    "the nirs spectra of sources associated with early ( r0r4 ) type stars show sometimes co absorptions at 1.6 and 2.3 @xmath0 m , but no other distinctive features ( fig .",
    "[ rtype ] , upper panel ) .",
    "r stars of later type may show the c@xmath3 band at 1.8 @xmath0 m without the 3.1 @xmath0 m absorption band ( fig .",
    "[ rtype ] , lower panel ) , confirming our suspicion that the latter is not sufficient to select all cool carbon stars .",
    "it thus appears again that the 1.8 @xmath0 m band , as well as the 3.1 @xmath0 m band , could be very useful for future surveys .",
    "the galactic ch stars are metal - poor carbon stars which are characterized in the optical range by strong ch bands .",
    "they are spectroscopic binaries and probably owe their carbon enrichment to mass transfer from a more evolved companion ( jorissen 1999 ) .",
    "we have not identified any ch star in the nirs psc . however , at least 3 members of this class ( v  ari , v  crb , hd  189711 ) were observed by iso with the sws .",
    "apart from the long wavelength wing of the 2.3 @xmath0 m co band , no characteristic feature is visible in the ( 2.34.1 @xmath0 m ) spectra of v  ari and hd  189711 ; unfortunately , the region of the spectrum around 1.8 @xmath0 m is missing in the iso spectra . v  crb shows a strong absorption at 3.1 @xmath0 m and at some phases an absorption at 3.8 @xmath0 m ( fig .",
    "[ vcrb ] ) .",
    "however , this source is a mira variable and therefore probably not typical of the ch class .",
    "if objects like v  crb are in the nirs psc , they would be selected as cool carbon stars and probably not recognized as being of the ch - type .",
    "there are also the j - type stars which are characterized by strong @xmath10c bands indicating a low ( @xmath7 10 ) @xmath11c/@xmath10c ratio .",

    "sensitive near - infrared spectro - photometric surveys covering the range from @xmath1  1.5 to @xmath1  4.5 @xmath0 m with a spectral resolution @xmath13 40 have therefore the potential to reveal new carbon stars in the galaxy and in its satellites , as well as in other galaxies , and to provide useful information on their physical properties .",

    "<S> we have identified 139 cool carbon stars in the near - infrared spectro - photometric survey of the infrared telescope in space ( irts ) from the conspicuous presence of molecular absorption bands at 1.8 , 3.1 and 3.8 @xmath0 m . among them </S>",
    "<S> 14 are new , bright ( k @xmath1 4.07.0 ) , carbon stars . </S>",
    "<S> we find a trend relating the 3.1 @xmath0 m band strength to the k@xmath2l color index , which is known to correlate with mass - loss rate . </S>",
    "<S> this could be an effect of a relation between the depth of the 3.1 @xmath0 m feature and the degree of development of the extended stellar atmosphere where dust starts to form . </S>"
