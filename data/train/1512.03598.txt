    "in the past twenty years , the functional renormalisation group ( frg ) approach @xcite has been established as a versatile method allowing to describe many aspects of different physical systems in the framework of quantum field theory and statistical physics .",
    "applications range from quantum dots and wires , statistical models , condensed matter systems in solid state physics and cold atoms over quantum chromodynamics to the standard model of particle physics and even quantum gravity . for reviews on the various aspects of the functional rg see @xcite .",
    "the functional renormalisation group approach can be set - up in terms of an exact flow equation for the effective action of the given theory or model @xcite .",
    "the choice of the initial condition at some large ultraviolet cutoff scale , typically a high momentum or energy scale , together with that of the regulator function determines both , the physics situation under investigation as well as the regularisation scheme .",
    "the functional rg flow for the scale - dependent effective action depends explicitly on the choice of regulator , while the physics does not .",
    "the latter is extracted from the full quantum effective action at vanishing cutoff scale implying a vanishing regulator .",
    "hence , at this point no dependence on the choice of regulator is left , only the implicit choice of the regularisation scheme remains .    typically , for the solution of the functional flow equation for the effective action one has to resort to approximations to the effective action as well as to the flow .",
    "such a truncation of the full flow usually destroys the regulator independence of the full quantum effective action at vanishing cutoff .",
    "therefore , devising suitable expansion schemes and regulators is essential for reliable results .",
    "moreover , the related considerations also allow for a discussion of the systematic error within a given truncation scheme .",
    "this has been examined in detail for the computation of critical exponents in models with a single scalar field in three dimensions within the lowest order of the local potential approximation ( lpa ) , @xcite : an optimisation procedure , @xcite suggests a particular regulator choice  the flat regulator  which is also shown to yield the best results for the critical exponents .",
    "the optimisation framework in @xcite has been extended to general expansion schemes in a functional optimisation procedure including fully momentum - dependent approximation schemes .",
    "an application to momentum - dependent correlation functions in yang - mills theory can be found in @xcite .",
    "still , for more elaborate truncations , in particular higher orders of the derivative expansion in the lpa , including , e.g. , momentum dependencies or higher - order derivative terms , little has been done when it comes to a practical implementation of optimisation criteria . also , more complex physical models with different symmetries such as , e.g. , non - relativistic systems , or models with several different fields , for example mixed boson - fermion systems , demand for a thorough study of their regulator dependence in order to extract the best physical results from a given truncation .",
    "in this paper we study the impact of different regulator choices on truncated functional renormalisation group flows in various models and further develop the functional optimisation procedure set - up in @xcite . in its present form",
    "it allows for a practical and simple comparison of the quality of different regulators and for the construction of an optimised one .",

    "[ sec : frgflows ] we shortly introduce the frg approach and explain how the choice of a specific regulator influences a truncated frg flow .",

    "[ sec : multifield ] and [ sec : richard ] , respectively .",
    "to this end , we introduce a shift between the regulator scales of the different fields and show how this affects the results allowing for a change of the underlying physics upon varying the regulator .",
