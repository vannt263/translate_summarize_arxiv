    "the presence of strong fields introduces quantum phenomena , such as supercriticallity and spontaneous pair production which is one of the most interesting non - perturbative phenomena associated with the charged quantum vacuum .    during the last decades",
    ", a great effort has been made in understanding quantum processes in strong fields .",

    ", we solve the @xmath0 equation in the @xmath1 potential well and we make a graphical study for the resonance transmissions . among the advantages of working with the @xmath1 potential we have to mention that , in the one - dimensional case , the @xmath0 equation as well as the @xmath3 and dirac equations are solvable in terms of special functions and therefore the study of bound states and scattering processes becomes more tractable .",
    "we show that the antiparticle bound states arise for the @xmath1 potential well , which is a smoothed out form of the square well .",
