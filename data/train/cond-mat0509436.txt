    "for instance , the quantum melting of the bosonic wigner crystal  @xcite is found ( by similar qmc calculations ) to occur at @xmath22 so that for @xmath23 the fermionic statistics ( from which all the difficulties of the qmc calculations come , as we shall see ) is crucial to stabilize the crystal .",
    "also , the classical melting @xcite as a function of temperature does not occur in a one step process .",
    "the system first looses its translational order but retains some orientational order ( hexatic phase  @xcite ) while at a higher temperature , any order disappears .",
    "the possibility of an intermediate quantum hexatic phase was put forward in  @xcite .",

    "all these indications  @xcite lead us recently to revisit the melting of the wigner crystal in the framework of the fn - qmc calculations .",

    "the fn - qmc algorithm projects the gwf onto the ( true ) ground state of the system . however , to avoid the notorious sign problem that arises in qmc simulations involving fermions , one approximation is introduced : the projection is done with the constraint that _ the sign of the wave function ( nodal structure ) remains unchanged _ at every point of the hilbert space .",

    "the physical meaning of the fn approximation is not completely obvious .",

    "ii , we perform fn - qmc calculations on a small system of @xmath24 electrons ( section iii ) . as this system can be studied exactly , it is an interesting tool to study the nature of the fn approximation .",

    "we conclude this paper with a discussion of several topics linked with the present study .",
    "_ spin of the electrons .",
    "_ we restricted the present study to fully spin polarized electrons . indeed , as the interaction energy gets bigger , the system can minimize its interaction energy by antisymmetrysing the orbital part of its wave - function , and it was found ( for instance in ref .",
    "@xcite ) that above @xmath336 ( which is the range of our study ) the polarized liquid is more stable than the unpolarized one .",
    "a strong in - plane magnetic field would also polarize the system at a smaller value of @xmath13 .",
    "_ multiple exchange .",
    "_ at high @xmath13 when the crystal is well established , multiple exchange ( of two , three or more particles ) can take place  @xcite , leading to an effective interaction between the electronic spins .",
    "recently these exchange interactions were estimated using the ( finite temperature ) path integral qmc technique  @xcite .",
    "the authors proposed that the melting of the crystal is actually due to a divergence of multi - spin exchange . in those calculations",
    ", some sort of fn approximation was used below @xmath22 to stabilize the crystal .",
    "summing up the exchange energies calculated in @xcite , we find ( in our unit ) @xmath337 at @xmath281 ( where the calculation is most robust ) .",
    "this energy is relatively small and can not account for the difference observed between the hybrid and crystal gwf results .",
    "the difference between these path integral calculations and those presented in this paper lies in the fn approximation ( the one used in @xcite seems to stabilize a well localized crystal ) and the use of a rather large temperature @xmath338 ( which is roughly three times bigger than the energy difference between the crystal and the liquid at @xmath281 and a 100 times bigger than the calculated exchange energies ) .",
    "_ hexatic and supersolid phase .",
    "_ among the proposed intermediate phases is the presence of a hexatic quantum phase in between the liquid and the crystal  @xcite .",
    "such a phase would have orientational order , but no translational order .",
    "the hybrid gwf is made of bloch waves that have , by construction , a hexagonal fermi surface ( one full band corresponds to momentum in the first brillouin zone of the triangular crystal ) .",
    "however , we have also explicitely broken the translational symmetry so that , at the variational level , the hybrid gwf does certainly not correspond to a hexatic phase . upon applying the fn projection operator ,",
    "the translational symmetry tend to be restored ( see the left panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : dst - kin ] for instance ) so that the present calculations can not rule out the possibility of a quantum hexatic phase .",
    "another proposition is the presence of a supersolid phase  @xcite , i.e. the quantum coexistence of a liquid ( of delocalized defects for instance ) with the crystal .",
    "qualitatively , the hybrid phase is in agreement with the idea of the supersolid phase as discussed in ref .  .",
    "in the supersolid described in ref .   however , one expects the number of electrons in the crystal to be smaller than the total number of electrons .",
    "we tried to construct such a gwf without success .",
    "_ bubbles and stripes .",
    "_ around the melting point of a classical liquid - solid phase transition , the system gains some energy by being in a coexistence of the two phases . in the present system",
    "such a macroscopic phase separation is not possible since it would lead to a macroscopic dipole .",
    "spivak and kivelson recently proposed that a series of microemulsion phases ( bubbles / stripes of solid / liquid in the liquid / solid ) can however take place .",
    "@xcite if they exist , these microemulsions take place between the two values of densities @xmath339 and @xmath340 ( in electrons per bohr radius squared ) that come out of the maxwell construction : @xmath341/(n_l - n_s)$ ] ( energies in rydberg ) . solving for @xmath339 and @xmath340 using the fn energies",
    ", we find that the ( maximum ) range of @xmath13 where these microemulsions could occur is @xmath342 with @xmath343 ( @xmath299 is the transition point . to a good approximation , @xmath344 where the change of slope @xmath345 , defined as @xmath346 around the transition can be extracted from fig.[fig : intro ] or fig.[fig : rsstar ] . )",
    "the argument was originally developped for the liquid / crystal transition but holds equally well for the liquid / hybrid transition described in this paper ( a direct liquid / crystal transition would lead to @xmath347 ) .",
    "the maximum gain of energy given by the maxwell construction ( which uses the energies calculated for _ neutral _ phases , hence only a fraction of this energy can possibly be gained by microemulsions ) is @xmath348 ( @xmath349 in our units ) .",
    "_ metal - insulator transition .",
    "_ about ten years ago , a new interest in two dimensional systems arised from the work of kravchenko et al  @xcite who reported on an unexpected metal - insulator transition .",
    "it was followed by an important body of literature but the origin of this transition is still under debate  @xcite .",
    "the problem involves understanding the role of disorder in the system and lies outside the scope of this paper .",
    "indeed the effect of disorder is a complicated issue and depends not only on the strength of the disorder but also on the typical length scale on which the potential varies .",
    "for instance , the component of the disorder varying on the scale of the inter electron distance is likely to pin and stabilize a crystal ( or glassy ) phase .",
    "a disordered potential varying on larger length scale however will favor fluctuations of the density and hence phase separation . in actual samples , long length scale fluctuations have been observed using local compressibility measurements  @xcite .",
    "a natural question for us is weither puddles of hybrid / crystal phase are actually present in the experiments . as the mobility of the two dimensional systems improved in the past years , so had the critical value of @xmath13 where the transition is observed . in hole gaas devices it goes from  @xcite @xmath350 to  @xcite @xmath351 in the cleanest samples , i.e. well above @xmath352 . at @xmath239 ,",
    "the difference of energy between the liquid and the crystal phase is roughly 0.03 mry per particle ( see lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : intro ] ) so that the melting temperature of the crystal should be slightly larger ( the crystal should be stabilized by its spin entropy through the pomeranchuk effect  @xcite ) which translates into temperatures of a few tens of mk .",
    "those temperatures are therefore within the possibilities of a good dilution fridge through slightly below the temperatures that are usually studied .    _",
    "conclusion : how liquid is the hybrid phase ? _ to summarize the main message of this article , we find that in these intermediate regions of densities , where little of the physics is known , the fixed node quantum monte carlo technique should be viewed as a probe .",
    "the freedom in the choice of the gwf allows one to start with a gwf that captures some sort of physics ( as seen in the variational calculation ) and the evolution of the various ( not only the energy ) physical quantities upon applying the fixed - node projection operator gives us insights on the physics of the true ground state . in short , one introduces new physics in a gwf and sees weither this new physics is stabilized or washed out by the fn - qmc algorithm .    with this paradigm in mind",
    ", we followed the evolution ( from variational to fn ) of the physical quantities available within our algorithm . for @xmath353",
    ", we found that all of them show the same tendency to delocalization .",
    "the succes of the hybrid gwf with respect to the crystal one is associated to its ( much more ) delocalized nature that allow a better balance between kinetic and electrostatic energy .",
    "the success of the hybrid gwf with respect to the liquid one however is associated to the change in symmetry as the hybrid gwf is constructed out of delocalized waves .",
    "we conclude that while the nature of the ground state above @xmath352 might still not be fully elucidated , the fact that it is not a liquid , yet not a localized crystal neither is now put on very firm grounds . at large @xmath13",
    "the system eventually gets localized . at the present",
    "we can not say weither this occurs through a crossover or a second transition .",
