    "elliptic curves underpin some of the most advanced mathematics currently being pursued , most notably ( probably ) the proof of fermat s last theorem by sir andrew wiles .",
    "recreational number theory is enjoyed by many people with * no * professional mathematics qualifications .",
    "the purpose of the present survey is to show how , even a small knowledge of elliptic curves and a computer , can help solve many problems .",
    "these problems are all reasonably simple to understand but can lead to some very interesting mathematics .",
    "we start with a simple    * problem : * if possible , find rational numbers @xmath0 with @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a specified non - zero integer .",
    "the first stage is to analyze the problem .",
    "we will find that solutions are related to rational points on the elliptic curve @xmath3    the rational points form a group , often denoted @xmath4 , which is finitely generated .",
    "this means that every element @xmath5 can be written @xmath6 where @xmath7 are points of infinite order , called generators , and @xmath8 is a point of finite order , called a torsion point .",
    "the subset of points of finite order is small and easily determined .",
    "for example , the above curve has @xmath9 as elements of @xmath8 , together with the point at infinity which is the group identity .",
    "the torsion points often correspond to trivial solutions of the problem , and only rarely give a solution we seek .    the quantity @xmath10 is called the * rank * of the elliptic curve .",
    "it can be zero , so that there are only torsion points , which usually means no non - trivial solutions .",
    "we can estimate the rank using the famous birch and swinnerton - dyer ( bsd ) conjecture and a moderate amount of computing . if the rank is computed to be greater than one , it is often reasonably easy to find at least one generator , though there are exceptions to this rule .",
    "the real computational problems are with curves where the rank is estimated to be exactly @xmath11 .",
    "a by - product of the bsd calculations is an estimate of the height of the point - the higher the height , the more digits in the rational coordinates and so the point is harder to find ( in general ) .",
    "there are two possible height normalizations available and i use the one described in silverman @xcite , which gives values half that of pari s current * ellheight * command .    let me state at the outset that my primary interest is in computing * actual * numerical values for solutions of the many problems discussed rather than just proving a solution exists .    to get anywhere in this subject , you need a computer and some software .",
    "to help with the algebra in the analysis of the problems , some form of symbolic algebra package would be very useful .",
    "i tend to use an old ms - dos version of derive but this falls down sometimes , so i have been known to use maxima ( free ) or even mathematica ( not - free ) .",
    "more importantly , you need a package which does the number theory calculations on elliptic curves .",
    "the most powerful is magma , but this costs money .",
    "pari is a free alternative but does not have so many built - in capabilities .",
    "the vast bulk of my code is written using pari , since i only recently purchased magma as a retirement present to myself !",
    "if you have an old 32-bit machine , i would recommend ubasic for development work as it is very fast .",
    "i have tried to give the correct credit where appropriate .",
    "if you think i have failed in this task , please contact me .",
    "i have also tried to make each problem description self - contained so there is quite a lot of repetition between sub - sections .",
    "any mistakes are , of course , purely my fault .",
    "i would be extremely pleased to hear from readers with problems i have not covered .",
    "what is an * elliptic curve * ?    since i am aiming to make most of this report understandable to non - professionals , i will take a very simplistic approach , which will certainly appal some professionals .",
    "but you can get quite far in using elliptic curves , without worrying about topics such as cohomology or galois representations .",
    "there are several books that can be recommended on elliptic curves . at an introductory level silverman and",
    "tate @xcite is excellent .",
    "more advanced are the books by husemller @xcite , knapp @xcite and cassels @xcite .",
    "the two volumes by silverman @xcite @xcite have become the standard mathematical introduction .",
    "consider the simple cubic @xmath13 which has zeros at @xmath14 .",
    "these are the only zeros , so the curve is non - negative for @xmath15 and @xmath16 , but strictly negative for @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "make the very simple change of @xmath19 to @xmath20 giving @xmath21 which gives the curve in the following graph .",
    "firstly , this curve is symmetric about the x - axis , because if @xmath22 lies on the curve so does @xmath23 .",
    "secondly , there are no points for @xmath17 or @xmath18 , since @xmath24 in these intervals .",
    "this means that the curve has two disconnected components .",
    "the first for @xmath16 is a closed shape , usually called the `` egg '' - for obvious pictorial reasons .",
    "the second for @xmath15 is usually called the infinite component .",
    "this is all very nice and pretty , but it does not help us solve our problems .",
    "the problems we consider look for integer or rational solutions , and we can link these to finding rational points on the elliptic curve .",
    "a rational point is one where both coordinates are rational .",
    "there are @xmath25 obvious rational points on this curve , namely @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 .",
    "a little simple search shows that @xmath29 gives @xmath30 , so @xmath31 and @xmath32 are also rational points on the curve .",
    "let @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the line joining @xmath35 to @xmath36 has equation @xmath37 , and meets the curve where @xmath38 which gives the cubic equation @xmath39    this has at most @xmath25 real solutions , and we already know two of them , @xmath40 and @xmath29 . we also know from basic algebra that the product of the three roots is @xmath41",
    ". thus the third point of intersection must be @xmath42 which gives @xmath43 .",
    "so from two rational points we get a third rational point !",
    "thinking about this procudure , if @xmath35 and @xmath36 are any rational points , the line joining them will have rational coefficients .",
    "so the intersection with the curve will be a cubic with rational coefficients .",
    "the product of the three roots will be the negative of the constant in the cubic and so rational .",
    "since we know two of the roots are rational , the third must be rational .",
    "but the line has rational coefficients , so the y - coordinate must also be rational . so from two rational points we get a third rational point .",
    "this operation is thus closed on the set of rational points @xmath4 .",
    "a closed binary operation is the first requirement for a group . with some further fiddling",
    ", we can define an `` addition '' operation on @xmath4 , which gives a commutative group .",
    "this is discussed further in the appendices .",
    "the crucial point is that this group is finitely generated .",
    "this means that there are points @xmath44 such that @xmath45 where @xmath46 is any rational point , @xmath47 are integers and @xmath8 is an element of a small subset of @xmath4 which is called the torsion subgroup and which can be easily computed .",
    "thus , all we need to do to find rational points is to find @xmath48 and hence use these to find a solution to our original problem .",
    "the value of @xmath10 is called the * rank * of the elliptic curve , and it can be @xmath49 .",
    "for example , @xmath50 has rank zero .",
    "the challenge is to compute these generator points .",
    "it can be very difficult , but that is what provides the challenge .",
    "let @xmath42 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 . then @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "it is a natural question to ask if this happens for other integers apart from @xmath55 .",
    "@xmath56    the following lemma shows , however , that we are doomed to failure .",
    "* lemma . *",
    "the only integer solution is the one above .",
    "* we can assume , without loss of generality , that @xmath57 and so , either all of @xmath58 are positive or two of them are negative and one positive .",
    "suppose , firstly , that all the variables are positive and we can assume @xmath59 .",
    "we have @xmath60 and @xmath61    if the right - hand - side is negative then @xmath62 , contradicting @xmath63 being an integer . if @xmath64 , the only value of @xmath19 giving a positive rhs is @xmath51 , but this gives @xmath65 .",
    "@xmath66 gives @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "if @xmath42 , @xmath69 , which only gives integer values when @xmath70 , again for @xmath68 .",
    "if we now assume two of @xmath58 are negative , let them be @xmath71 and @xmath19 , with @xmath72 .",
    "but implies @xmath73 , a contradiction .",
    "thus , the only purely integer solution is the one at the start of the section .",
    "we now consider @xmath74 .",
    "we have @xmath75 , and , substituting , we have that @xmath76 must satisfy the quadratic equation @xmath77    for fixed @xmath2 , we can generate rational values of @xmath71 , and test if this quadratic factors into linear factors . for @xmath78 , the following results were obtained in a simple search    .equal sum and product results [ cols= \" < , > , > , > \" , ]     ( 8,8 ) ( 0,0)(1,0)12 ( 0,0)(0,1)8 ( 0,8)(1,0)12 ( 12,0)(0,1)8 ( 0,0)(2,1)8 ( 8,4)(1,-1)4 ( 0,8)(2,-1)8 ( 8,4)(1,1)4    finally , for the @xmath79 configuration , consider the rectangle shown .",
    "we have @xmath80 with a solution to the @xmath79 configuration when @xmath81 and @xmath82 .    from @xmath83 and @xmath84",
    "we have the quadratic equation @xmath85 which must have a discriminant being a rational square to give rational @xmath86 .",
    "thus , there exists @xmath87 , such that @xmath88    defining @xmath89 and @xmath90 gives the quartic @xmath91    using mordell s method , this can be transformed to the equivalent elliptic curve @xmath92 with @xmath93    there are , thus , two free parameters @xmath94 and @xmath95 . for each possible pair",
    ", we try to find curves with rank greater than zero , and possible generators",
    ". then generate points on the curve , and values of @xmath96 and solve the quadratic for @xmath86 . from these",
    "find @xmath97 and test if they are all positive and if @xmath82 .",
    "no solution has been found , and , in fact , bremner and guy conjecture that a solution does not exist .",
    "i must admit that i agree with them .",
    "an interesting question is how small can @xmath98 be ?",
    "it is easy to adapt the code for this .",
    "consider the @xmath99 magic square @xmath100 where we assume @xmath101 .",
    "can we find such a square where the nine entries are distinct squares ?",
    "so far , only a single square with @xmath102 square entries has been found , by andrew bremner @xcite @xcite .",
    "it is @xmath103    on the principle that one solution usually implies more than one , i have spent a lot of computer time looking for more solutions .",
    "they are all based on the elliptic curve approach described by bremner , starting from making @xmath55 entries square .    to illustrate the approach ,",
    "suppose we take the first and third rows to all be squares , so @xmath104 and we can , without loss of generality , consider all these variables to be rational .",
    "we have @xmath105 and @xmath106    if we think in terms of vectors , the first relation says that the lengths of @xmath107 are the same .",
    "thus each vector must just be a rotation of another , so @xmath108 and @xmath109 for some angles @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "these relations imply that the sines and cosines are rational , so @xmath112 and @xmath113 where @xmath114 .",
    "these give @xmath115 in terms of @xmath116 .",
    "substituting into the second relation gives a quadratic @xmath117 where @xmath118 is a fairly complicated rational function in @xmath119 .",
    "if this quadratic is to give rational values for @xmath120 , the discriminant @xmath121 must be a rational square .",
    "computing this , and clearing as many square terms as possible , we eventually arrive at the quartic in @xmath95 , assuming @xmath96 has been selected , @xmath122 @xmath123    this quartic has a rational solution when @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",
    "thus the quartic is birationally equivalent to an elliptic curve . after a reasonable amount of computer algebra , we find the relevant curve to be @xmath126 where @xmath127 with @xmath128 and @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",
    "the inverse transformation is @xmath131    the elliptic curve has @xmath25 finite points of order @xmath132 , at @xmath133 , @xmath134 and @xmath135 .",
    "there are also points of order @xmath136 when @xmath137 .",
    "the torsion subgroup is thus @xmath138 or @xmath139 .",
    "numerical testing suggests the former is always the case .",
    "if we take the denominator of the f - transformation , solve for @xmath140 , and substitute into the elliptic curve we find a point @xmath141 which gives a rational point on the curve .",
    "adding to @xmath26 gives @xmath142 which has @xmath143 , which suggests the curves have rank at least one .    as a numerical example , @xmath144 , gives @xmath145 .",
    "the positive value gives @xmath146 , but the negative value gives @xmath147 .",
    "this gives @xmath148 and @xmath149 as possible values . from these",
    ", we can compute @xmath0 with @xmath150 @xmath151 with @xmath152 @xmath153 @xmath154    sadly , none of the other @xmath25 elements of the magic square are squares .",
    "we can easily perform all these calculations in pari , as well as considering the @xmath155 other distinct configurations of six squares .",
    "bremner s solution is found quickly in several configuration calculations , but no second solution has yet been discovered .",
    "i would like to express my sincere thanks to andrew bremner for all his help , and his courtesy in answering lots of questions .",
    "the standard elliptic curve over @xmath156 can be written @xmath157 with @xmath158 .",
    "firstly , we transform the equation of the curve to a simpler form . from @xmath159",
    "we have @xmath160 so @xmath161    define @xmath162 , so @xmath163 giving @xmath164 so that @xmath165    now , define @xmath166 , giving @xmath167 and @xmath168    finally , set @xmath169 and @xmath170 leading to @xmath171 which we write as @xmath172 with @xmath101 .",
    "this is the form we use for all the elliptic curves in this survey .",
    "it has the great advantage of symmetry about the u - axis , so , if @xmath173 is a point on the curve , so is @xmath174 .",
    "we define addition of rational points in the usual chord - and - tangent way , see silverman and tate s @xcite excellent introduction to elliptic curves .",
    "if @xmath175 the line joining the points has equation @xmath176 and so substituting this into the equation gives a cubic in @xmath177 for the points where the line and curve meet .",
    "the constant of the cubic is @xmath178 which is rational , and also is @xmath179 where @xmath180 is the u - coordinate of the third intersection of the line and the curve .",
    "thus @xmath181 and the corresponding v - coordinate ( call it @xmath140 ) is also rational .    thus combining two rational points in this way",
    "gives a third rational point .",
    "this gives a closed binary operation on the set of rational points , which is often denoted by @xmath4 .",
    "this is the first requirement for defining a group .    to get the associative property needed for a group",
    ", we actually need to take the result of the operation to be the point @xmath182 and not the actual point of intersection @xmath183 .",
    "we define the `` addition '' of rational points as @xmath184    with this binary operation , the set of rational points can be shown to be an abelian group .",
    "the identity ( denoted by @xmath185 ) is the point at infinity , which is best approached by projectivising the curve , setting @xmath186 and @xmath187 to give @xmath188 and the point at infinity is @xmath189 .",
    "this gives the inverse of @xmath173 as @xmath174 .",
    "@xmath4 is a finitely generated group , and is isomorphic to @xmath190 , where @xmath10 is called the rank of the curve and @xmath191 is called the * torsion subgroup * and is one of    * @xmath192 , * @xmath193 .    as proven by mazur @xcite , though first conjectured by beppo levi much earlier in the 20th century .",
    "this means that there exist @xmath10 rational points @xmath7 such that all rational points can be written @xmath194 where @xmath195 and @xmath196 .",
    "the hard part in all the problems is finding @xmath197 .",
    "if @xmath46 is a point of order @xmath132 then @xmath198 , so @xmath199 . the only way this can happen is if the v - coordinate of @xmath46 is zero , so that the u - coordinate is a zero of @xmath200 .",
    "we want this root to be rational , but , since the coefficient of @xmath201 is @xmath11 , any rational root will actually be an integer root . thus point of order @xmath132 in @xmath4 can only come from integer roots of @xmath202 .",
    "there is a theorem of nagell and lutz , which states that for curves of the form , all rational torsion points have integer coordinates .",
    "there are two important points to note .",
    "this result does not always hold for curves of the form , and points of infinite order can have integer coordinates .",
    "if @xmath4 has a point of order @xmath132 , at @xmath203 say , if we define @xmath204 the elliptic curve reduces to the very simple but important form @xmath205 with @xmath206 .",
    "ten of the fifteen different torsion subgroup types have points of order @xmath132 so this form is a basic structure .",
    "suppose @xmath207 for a curve of this form .",
    "the point @xmath208 comes from the intersection of the tangent at @xmath46 with the curve .",
    "some simple algebra shows that the w - coordinate of @xmath209 is thus @xmath210 so must be a rational square and , by nagell - lutz , must be an integer square .",
    "this is an incredibly useful result .",
    "we now show how to transform the quartic @xmath211 with @xmath212 , into an equivalent elliptic curve .",
    "we first consider the case when @xmath213 , which is very common .",
    "if @xmath214 for some rational @xmath215 , we substitute @xmath216 and @xmath217 , giving @xmath218 thus , suppose @xmath219    we describe the method given by mordell on page @xmath220 of @xcite , with some minor modifications .",
    "we first get rid of the cubic term by making the standard substitution @xmath221 giving @xmath222 where @xmath223    we now get rid off the quartic term by defining @xmath224 , where @xmath177 is a new variable and @xmath225 is a constant to be determined .",
    "this gives the quadratic in @xmath63 @xmath226    if @xmath71 were rational , then @xmath63 would be rational , so the discriminant of this quadratic would have to be a rational square .",
    "the discriminant is a cubic in @xmath177 .",
    "we do not get a term in @xmath227 if we make @xmath228 , giving @xmath229 and , if we substitute the formulae for @xmath230 , and clear denominators we have @xmath231 with @xmath232 and @xmath233    if we set the denominator of to zero , we have @xmath234 which gives @xmath235 automatically giving a point on the curve .",
    "often , it will just be a torsion point , but , occasionally , we get the coordinates of a point of infinite order .",
    "note also , that if @xmath236 , then @xmath237 so we always have a point of order @xmath132 from @xmath238 .    in this latter case , if we transfer the origin to this point of order @xmath132 and simplify we get @xmath239 with @xmath240    if @xmath241 , we need a rational point @xmath173 lying on the quartic .",
    "let @xmath242 , so that @xmath243 giving @xmath244 @xmath245 where the coefficient of @xmath246 is , in fact , @xmath247",
    ". define , @xmath248 , and then @xmath249 giving @xmath250 @xmath251    we now , essentially , complete the square",
    ". we can write @xmath252 if we set @xmath253 and @xmath254    this gives @xmath255 and if we define @xmath256 we have @xmath257    multiply both sides by @xmath258 , giving @xmath259 which , on defining @xmath260 , gives @xmath261    define , @xmath262 and @xmath263 giving @xmath264 which is an elliptic curve .",
    "if we define @xmath265 , we transform to the form @xmath266    all of the above are easy to program in any symbolic package .",
    "a variant of the above problem , that occurs often enough to be important , is when @xmath236 , so the quartic is @xmath267    applying the above formulae gives an elliptic curve where the cubic right - hand - side has a linear factor , so the curve has a point of order @xmath132 .",
    "transforming to make this point the origin , and doing a variable scaling gives @xmath268",
    "in this section , we describe a very simple method for searching for rational points on @xmath270 where @xmath271 .",
    "suppose @xmath272 where we set @xmath273 , with @xmath274 and @xmath275 , and @xmath276 .",
    "then @xmath277    it is clear that @xmath278 iff @xmath279 , so suppose both @xmath280 .",
    "now @xmath281 can not divide @xmath282 since , if it did , that would give @xmath283 against @xmath274 .",
    "thus @xmath284 .",
    "similarly , we must have @xmath285 , so @xmath286 which implies there must exist an integer @xmath287 with @xmath288 and @xmath289 .",
    "thus @xmath290 and we can always write @xmath2 as @xmath291 where @xmath292 is squarefree . putting @xmath293 and @xmath294 into gives @xmath295 so that @xmath296 and @xmath297",
    ". thus @xmath298 and , since @xmath292 is squarefree by definition , @xmath299 .",
    "thus there must exist an integer @xmath140 such that @xmath300 .",
    "thus @xmath301 so that @xmath302 , and , since @xmath303 we must have @xmath304 .",
    "so we can determine possible values for @xmath292 from the squarefree factors of @xmath305 .",

    "quite often @xmath315 and we can parameterize @xmath316 as @xmath317 , @xmath318 and @xmath319 , which makes for a very simple program .    if @xmath320 , we can find an initial non - trivial solution @xmath321 of and use standard quadric parameterisation to give @xmath322 where @xmath323 .",
    "this gives @xmath324    this simple method provides lots of points of small heights .",
    "we can develop further by taking the numerator and denominator of this equation separately as @xmath325 @xmath326 where @xmath225 is squarefree .",
    "we try to satisfy both simultaneously .",
    "values of @xmath225 must divide the resultant of the two quadratics on the left - hand - sides of these two relations , so @xmath327 so there are only a computable finite set of possible values .",
    "suppose we find an initial solution @xmath328 to the first quadratic , then the line @xmath329 meets it again where @xmath330    substituting into the second quadratic , we must have @xmath331 with @xmath332 @xmath333 @xmath334 @xmath335 @xmath336    finding rational solutions to is a non - trivial problem .",
    "there is not enough space to describe the many tricks of the trade that should be employed to do this efficiently .",
    "this entire method has been the workhorse for finding hundreds of solutions .",
    "isogenies are a crucial tool in finding points with large heights by allowing us to consider curves which * might * have rational points with much smaller heights .",
    "the classic reference is the paper of vlu @xcite .      in this case ,",
    "points of order @xmath132 have coordinates @xmath338 , and other torsion points occur in pairs @xmath339 .",

    "consider , first , the curve @xmath351 with just the torsion point @xmath26 .",
    "then @xmath352 , @xmath353 and @xmath354 .",
