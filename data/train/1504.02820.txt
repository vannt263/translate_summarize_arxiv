    "it is well known that masive o - b type stars inject a considerable amount of mechanical energy into the interstellar medium ( ism ) , in form of stellar winds or supernova ( sn ) explosions .",
    "the energy input by these events is sufficient to drive strong shocks that expand into the ism generating a structure called bubble .",
    "the model proposed by @xcite and later expanded by @xcite and @xcite , is considered the standard model of bubbles driven by stellar winds .",
    "it considers the injection of mechanical energy to the ism from stellar winds that results in the formation of a bubble .",
    "this bubble is surrounded by a cool shell of ism material that has been swept by the expanding shock front .",
    "the shocked ( and thereby heated and compressed ) material in the interior of the bubble emits considerably in x - rays , whereas the outer , cooler shell emits at optical wavelenghts .",
    "the original @xcite model considers a single stellar wind source . some time later , in order to explain what is now known as _",
    "superbubbles _ , the model was extended to include multiple wind sources ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the simplest model of superbubble formation is as follows .",
    "consider a cluster with @xmath1 stars each having different mass - loss rate @xmath2 and a wind velocity @xmath3 .",
    "since the stars inject mechanical energy in the form of stellar winds , the total mechanical luminosity is given by    @xmath4    at first , the stellar winds collide with each other and with the enviromnent inside the cluster radius .",
    "thus the space between the stars is filled with hot shocked material from the winds .",
    "this happens until a stationary flow is established , giving rise to a common cluster wind that forms a _ supershell_. as this supershell expands through the surrounding ism it creates a superbubble structure with the following structure @xcite :    1 .",
    "the innermost region located near the stars ( where their winds collide ) produces thermal hard x - ray emission ( if the stellar winds have terminal velocities larger than @xmath5 km  s@xmath6 ) , and driving the expansion of the bubble through a pressure difference between the hot and dense interior and the colder and less dense environment .",
    "after the individual winds from the stars coalesce into a cluster wind , it expands freely from the cluster radius outwards . in this zone x - ray emission",
    "is important only close to the cluster radius , and it consists mostly of soft x - rays .",
    "3 .   behind the main shock pushing into the ism a reverse shock is formed . the reverse shock encounters the freely expanding wind and compress and heats it to soft x - ray emitting temperatures .",
    "the region filled by shocked wind is quite extended and dominates the emission in x - rays , particularly in the soft energy bands .",
    "the outermost region of the supperbubble consists of a shell of shocked ism that has been swept up by the main shock . beyond this zone",
    "there is only unperturbed ism material .",
    "the original wind blown bubble ( wwb ) model proposed by weaver et al .",
    "( 1977 ) overpredicts the x - ray luminosity .",
    "one reason is that this model includes thermal conduction and in consequence produces a denser interior that in the case without it , which in turn increases the x - ray luminosity .",
    "furthermore , the wind blown bubble models do not take into account the radiative losses within the cluster radius , and this can have a significant impact on the luminosity ( see rodrguez gonzlez et al .",
    "recent examples of this are the works of dunne et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and reyes - iturbide et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , which predict x - ray luminosities that exceed that of the observations by about one order of magnitude .    on the other hand",
    ", there are others models that predict an x - ray emission that underestimates the observed values ( for instance , see the work of harper - clark & murray 2009 ; rogers & pittard 2014 , in which only the cluster wind region is considered ) , a problem for which different solutions have been explored .",
    "@xcite proposed that in order to increase the luminosity of x - rays ( so as to match the observations ) one should consider shock waves produced by the explosion of supernovae inside the star cluster .",
    "@xcite presented models where the luminosity of soft x - rays is obtained as a function of the mass loss rate , the cluster radius and the wind terminal velocity .",
    "they do not take into account mass loading , but they consider it can be relevant for the study of soft x - rays in this type of massive clusters . the work of @xcite deals with the effect on the x - ray emission of the high metal content injected by the massive stellar winds and the sn remnants .",
    "@xcite showed that supernovae occurring near the centre of the cluster are not capable of reproducing ( completely ) the luminosity observed in x - rays , and neither do they help explain the kinematics of the shell ( without consider thermal conduction ) .",
    "they instead showed that off - centre sn explosions ( for n70 and n185 , see also @xcite ) could help explain the two or three orders of magnitude difference between the luminosity observed and the standard model predictions .",
    "however , in these models the x - ray luminosity agrees with the observed value for only @xmath7 years , making the probability of observing them in this regime rather low . on the other hand , @xcite presented models of the m17 superbubble where they considered the contribution of the gas of the parental cloud in the evolution .",
    "they showed that the mass loading from the parental cloud can help increase the luminosity of soft x - rays by up to an order of magnitude . in such work",
    "neither the metallicity nor thermal conduction were considered .",
    "the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) is filled with superbubbles with important soft x - rays emission .",
    "some of these superbubbles ( for instance , dem l50 and dem l152 , see @xcite ) show evidence for off - centre supernova events which seem to interact with the external shell pushed by the stellar winds . in the observations made by @xcite the gas of the supernova remnant is still seen .",
    "this remnant is located close to the superbubble edge .",
    "these objects have luminosities up to an order of magnitude higher than those predicted by the model of @xcite .",
    "moreover , the numerical models that appear in @xcite produce luminosities that are two orders of magnitude lower than the observations ( @xmath8 erg s@xmath6 )",
    ". therefore the authors explored the effect of the metallicity and of mass loading by clouds to bridge the luminosity deficit in soft x - rays .",
    "they calculated the mass of metal enriched material injected by the supernova explosions @xcite and found that metallicities from 3 to 10 times solar can be achieved , and using the equations of @xcite , they concluded that the effect is not sufficient to account for the differences .",
    "they conclude that the main mechanism that can explain such an important enhancement of the total x - rays luminosity is mass loading .",
    "recently , @xcite presented a study of the soft x - ray emission during the various evolutionary stages of massive stars embedded in a dense giant molecular cloud ( gmc ) , going through the red supergiant and wolf - rayet stages up to the supernova phase .",
    "they showed that the inclusion of the gmc results in a short lived attenuation of the x - ray emission of the cluster , during the time before an important fraction of the material is carried away from the wind interaction region .",
    "after this occurs , the luminosity remains practically constant .",
    "the x - ray emission of a star changes substantially as it goes through distinct evolutionary stages .",
    "for instance , the x - ray luminosity drops abruptly during the red giant phase and increases substantially once in the wolf - rayet phase .",
    "@xcite show that , in spite of the differences between their models and some observations , their results agree reasonably with other observations , such as the case of m17 and the rosette nebula .",
    "they found that the emission produced by their model during the early wind - dominated phase is smaller compared to the prediction from the standard model @xcite , but larger than the emission expected in models that only consider the emission at the interaction region of the winds of massive stars ( the cluster wind ) .",
    "finally , for stars in the main sequence , they found luminosities two or three orders of magnitude above those predicted by the standard model , lasting for more than @xmath9 .    in this work",
    ", we present a series of numerical models exploring the effects of supernova explosions , metallicty and heat conduction in the thermal soft and hard x - rays luminosity of a massive star cluster .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in section 2 we present the numerical setup of our models , describe the implementation of the thermal conduction and the metallicity in the gas dynamics equations , and in section 3 we show the resulting synthetic emission in the soft and hard x - ray bands as well as a brief discussion of our results . in section 4 we have made some comparisons of our numerical models with four interesting observed bubbles .",
    "finally , a summary is given in section 5 .",
    "with the purpose of exploring the effects of the interaction and influence of the sn explosions and metallicity , as well as thermal conduction in the cluster stellar winds , we performed a series of numerical simulations , and estimated the soft and hard x - ray emission that would be produced .",

    "the code solves the hydrodynamic equations ( [ eq : conmass]-[eq : conene ] ) on a three dimensional uniform cartesian mesh , using a second order finite volume method with hllc fluxes ( @xcite ) and a piecewise linear reconstruction of the variables at the cell interfaces with a minmod slope limiter .",

    "ism mass is larger than the ejected mass the metallicity of the shell remains close to that of the ism .      in order to include the effect of thermal conduction by free electrons in our numerical simulation , we add a heat flux term ( @xmath63 ) in the right hand side of the energy equation ( [ eq : conene ] ) .    the heat conduction due to collisions with free electrons in a plasma is given by the classical @xcite law : @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the thermal conductivity given by @xmath66 where , for a fully ionized hydrogen plasma @xmath67 ( see * ? ? ?",

    "these increments in the time interval with emission above @xmath126 and/or @xmath127  erg s@xmath6 will enhance the chance of such luminosities being observed .",
    "we can see that the inclusion of different metallicities and/or thermal conduction induces only small discrepancies in the soft x - ray emission .    from this models",
    "it is clear that the supernova explosions are a crucial ingredient for the thermal x - ray emission .",

    "we find that models with a centred explosion seem to still be underluminous .    a possibility that results in luminosities above @xmath128  erg  s@xmath6 is to place the sn at a distance from the centre of the star cluster .",

    "note that the blowout region ( located at the upper right corner of the simulation box ) provides the largest contribution to the luminosity increase seen 30 kyr after the explosion ( middle panels ) . by 200  kyr after the explosion ( bottom panels ) , the emissivity has almost returned to values comparable to its pre - sn level ; however , due to the now larger x - ray emitting volume , the luminosity remains slightly above the original level ( see figure [ f : lumxsoftr ] ) .",
    "an interesting exercise is to compare the predicted luminosity statistics of our simulations with those of observed superbubbles . for this purpose",
    "we have taken a sample of 26 bubbles with luminosities greater than @xmath126  erg  s@xmath6 from the literature @xcite . out of these , 18 have luminosities above @xmath127  erg  s@xmath6 while only 3 are observed with l@xmath143  erg  s@xmath6 .",
    "we can use our numerical results to predict how many bubbles out of these 26 should have luminosities above these two levels . in order to do this , we computed , from table 2 , the ratios of the times spent above these levels to the overall time where luminosity is above @xmath126  erg  s@xmath6 for model sr10tsn5zv ( the only one that reaches @xmath128  erg  s@xmath6 ) .",
    "we find that @xmath144 % and @xmath145 % .",
    "thus , assuming that all bubbles in this observed sample reach a luminosity of 10@xmath106  erg  s@xmath6 at some point in their evolution , this model predicts that about 14 should have a luminosity above 10@xmath105  erg  s@xmath6 while about 6 should be observed above 10@xmath106  erg  s@xmath6 .",
    "though the values do not coincide exactly , they reasonably match the luminosity ratios of l@xmath146/l@xmath147 12 % and l@xmath146/l@xmath148 70 % observed in the sample . here , l@xmath149 is a soft x - ray luminosity that is greater than or equal to @xmath150  erg  s@xmath6",
    ".    there could be several explanations for this difference .",
    "for one , it is hard to judge whether this small sample of superbubbles is representative of the general population , and thus some variability can be expected in the statistics . at the same time , our numerical results suggest that the position of a supernova explosion occurring inside the bubbles determines whether a luminosity of 10@xmath106  erg  s@xmath6 is reached at all during their lifetimes .",
    "thus , if not all of the observed bubbles have had off - centre sn explosion , it is to be expected that fewer of them would be observed above 10@xmath106  erg  s@xmath6 than what our models predict .",
    "hard x - ray emission is produced in the hottest regions inside the bubble where individual winds interact , when the gas flow is faster than a @xmath151 km  s@xmath6 , as well as during the early stages of the sn remnant evolution and where the cluster wind and/or the sn remnant are heated by the reverse shock .",
    "thus one should expect that metallicity should have a significant effect on the hard x - ray emission .    in table  [ table : hard ] we show the maximum thermal hard x - ray luminosity , and the time intervals for which the luminosity remains above @xmath152  erg  s@xmath6 ( @xmath153 ) and @xmath126  erg  s@xmath6 ( @xmath153 ) .",
    "figure  [ f : lumxhardr0 ] shows the evolution of the thermal hard x - rays luminosity for all models with the sn placed at the centre . in the models with different metallicities all three components exhibit maximum luminosities ( @xmath154  erg  s@xmath6 ) that are @xmath142 times larger than those of the models with homogeneous metallicity ( @xmath155  erg  s@xmath6 )",
    "we have to mention that the thermal hard x - ray emission produced inside the star cluster ( regions of wind collisions ) is underestimated by the models with homogeneous metallicity due to the rather low metallicity of the wind sources ( @xmath54 ) . in the models with the variable metallicity",
    "the wind is injected with a more appropriate metal content ( @xmath156 ) , thus the hard x - ray luminosity in these models should be closer to reality .    * 4c model & l@xmath157 & @xmath153 & @xmath158 + & [ erg s@xmath6 ] & [ @xmath81yr ] & [ @xmath81yr ] + sr0tsn2z0.3 & 2.88@xmath159 & 2.00 & 1.35 + sr0tsn3z0.3 & 2.88@xmath159 & 1.99 & 1.35 + sr0tsn5z0.3 & 2.88@xmath159 & 1.96 & 1.33 + sr0tsn2zv & 1.02@xmath113 & 2.03 & 1.84 + sr0tsn3zv & 1.02@xmath113 & 2.02 & 1.85 + sr0tsn5zv & 1.02@xmath113 & 2.00 & 1.83 + sr0tsn7.5zv & 2.81@xmath160 & 0.00 & 0.00 + sr0tsn2zvc & 9.90@xmath159 & 2.03 & 1.84 + sr0tsn5zvc & 9.93@xmath159 & 2.00 & 1.82 + sr5tsn5zv & 9.07@xmath159 & 2.00 & 1.81 + sr10tsn5zv & 9.84@xmath159 & 3.57 & 1.99",
    "+    we can see from table  [ table : hard ] that the maximum hard x - ray luminosity is significantly larger in the models with variable metallicity , typically an increase of @xmath161 times .",
    "the time interval that the emission remains above @xmath162 is similar , although slightly larger in the models with more realistic metallicity .",
    "in contrast , the time that the emission remains above @xmath120 is much larger ( a factor of @xmath134 ) than that obtained in the models with homogeneous metallicity .",
    "an important fact to notice is that the ratio of the maximum luminosities in soft - xrays to hard x - rays is on the order of @xmath130 .",
    "velzquez et al .",
    "( 2013 ) explored the ratios between soft and hard x - ray emission in the young star cluster m17 .",
    "this particular cluster is partially immersed in the cluster parental cloud , and their models resulted in a ratio of soft to hard x - rays of two orders of magnitude . from our models",
    "we notice that the time intervals of high luminosity for soft x - rays ( @xmath107 and @xmath111 ) are larger than those obtain for hard x - rays ( @xmath153 and @xmath158 )    this shows that very young star clusters with a sn event can produce hard x - ray luminosities that are only an order of magnitude fainter than the soft x - rays .",
    "however , this happens only for a short interval at the earlier stages of the sn remnant .",
    "after that the hard x - ray emission drops abruptly .     for hard x - rays luminosities .",
    "]     for hard x - rays luminosities . ]",
    "figure  [ f : lumxhardr0c ] shows the evolution of the hard x - ray luminosity for the two models with thermal conduction and their counterpart without thermal conduction .",
    "the maximum luminosities and the time intervals of high hard x - ray emission are remarkably similar in spite of the thermal conduction .",
    "although small differences can be seen , the position of the supernova explosion in the cluster does not have a significant influence in the overall and maximum thermal hard x - ray luminosity ( see figure  [ f : lumxhardr ] ) .     for hard x - rays luminosities .",
    "]    it is also intresting to note that for an sn exploding at the centre of the cluster the highest luminosity achieved is much lower if the explosion occurs at later times ( c.f .",
    "the long dashed curve in figure [ f : lumxhardr0 ] to the others ) .    the distribution of the hard x - ray emission before the sn explosion , at peak luminosity , and after the luminosity returns to its previous level can be seen as the ( logarithmically spaced ) contour levels in figure [ f : xrays ] .",
    "the emission during peak luminosity ( middle row ) is slightly more extended in the case where the sn is detonated off - centre ( panel f ) , but returns to being concentrated inside the star cluster after the effect of the explosion has had time to decay ( bottom row ) .",
    "the impact of thermal conduction on the hard x - ray emission is also evident . as can be seen , before ( top row ) or some time after ( bottom row ) the sn explosion the hard - band emission is at a much higher level in the cases without thermal conduction ( left and right columns ) .",
    "however , during the luminosity peak ( middle row ) all models display important hard x - ray emission regardless of the inclusion of thermal conduction .",
    "the difference lies mainly in that in the case including thermal conduction ( panel e ) the emission is slightly more centralised than in the cases without .",
    "we must note that the resolution used in the models is not enough to capture all the details of the flow .",
    "the use of higher resolution allows larger compression factors as well as more small scale structure inside the bubbles . to estimate the uncertainty in the x - ray luminosities due to poor resolution we have taken a test case ( model sr0tsn5z0 ) , and reproduce the setup in the walicxe-3d code @xcite .",
    "this code has adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) , which allows to increase the resolution at a lower computational cost , but the thermal conduction is not fully implemented .",
    "we ran the test case at an equivalent resolution of @xmath163 and @xmath164 cells , and while the details of the flow are different , the integrated x - ray luminosities seem to reach convergence .",
    "the peak luminosity in the higher resolution runs is a factor of @xmath165 larger than in the @xmath24 model sr0tsn5z0 . and the times above @xmath126 , @xmath166 , and @xmath137 are larger by a factor of @xmath167 .",
    "all the results presented above have an uncertainty of this order of magnitude due to the limited resolution .",
    "it is useful to compare our numerical models to the observations of particular superbubbles .",
    "we have thus turned our attention to four superbubbles located in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) : n70 , n185 , dem l50 and dem l152 .",
    "these superbubbles have some particular features ( as we will show ) that make them compatible with our results .",
    "n70 is a superbubble with a radius of approximately 53 pc . according to the observations",
    "there is a sn located closer to the center than the edge of the cluster .",
    "the x - ray luminosity reported by @xcite is about 2.4(@xmath168)@xmath169  erg s@xmath6 .",
    "we can see that our numerical results are in good agreement with these observations , in particular the models with the sn explosion in the center of the cluster .",
    "the case of n185 is quite similar to that of n70 .",
    "n185 has a spherical shape with an approximate radius of 43 pc @xcite .",
    "the x - ray luminosity obtained by @xcite is 2.1 ( @xmath170)@xmath171  erg s@xmath6 .",
    "following @xcite , a possibility to explain the high velocity of this superbubble is that a sn explosion ocurred . from its spherical shape ,",
    "we conclude that the sn explosion must be located near the centre of the cluster . as in the previous case ,",
    "our numerical models are in good agreement with the observed x - ray luminosities .",
    "two other interesting cases are dem l50 and dem l152 .",
    "these are two superbubbles with very intense x - ray emission . according to observations dm l152",
    "has a radius of approximately 50 pc @xcite , and dem l50 has roughly the same radius @xcite .",
    "@xcite reported an x - ray luminosity in the range 2.0 - 4.0@xmath172  erg s@xmath6 for dem l50 and an emission of 5.4 - 5.7@xmath171  erg s@xmath6 .",
    "these two superbubbles contrast with n70 and n185 in that they contain an off - centre sn explosion , which is clearly distinguishable in the observations .",
    "only numerical model sn10tsn5zv predicts a luminosity comparable to the observed values .",
    "the luminosities predicted by other models are not high enough to match with these observed values .        in order to better compare with observations",
    ", we have calculated the hardness ratio for three of our models ( see figure [ f : hardness ] ) .",
    "these models are those discussed in section 3 : two with a centred sn explosion that differ in the presence of thermal conduction , and the third with the sn explosion 10 pc off - centre . following @xcite , the hardness ratio is defined as : @xmath173 where @xmath174 is the flux energy in the 2 - 10  kev energy band ( corresponding to hard x - rays ) and @xmath175 is the flux energy in the 0.1 - 2  kev energy band ( corresponding to soft x - rays ) . after computing the fluxes and obtaining @xmath176 for each cell in the simulation , we integrate along the @xmath177 axis in order to project the result into a 2d map , assuming that the x - ray absorption due to the material inside the bubble can be neglected .    in figure [",
    "f : hardness ] we observe that , before the sn explosion occurs , in models without thermal conduction ( left and right columns ) the hardness ratio peaks at @xmath178 at the centre of the stellar distribution , and decreases as we approach the edge of the cluster ( the shell of swept - up ism material emits mainly soft x - rays ) . in the case of the model that includes thermal conduction ( middle column )",
    ", we observe that @xmath179 in most of the bubble , indicating that hard x - ray emission is largely negligible . as a result ,",
    "the material ejected by the stars is cooled quickly from hard x - ray emitting temperatures ( @xmath180 k ) to temperatures in the range @xmath181 - @xmath182 k where soft x - ray emission is favored .",
    "the sn explosion drastically alters the hardness maps for the models without thermal conduction .",
    "the sn shockwave sweeps the cluster volume , devoiding the center of the bubble of hard x - ray emitting gas and forming regions with @xmath183 closer to the edge of the bubble . in the model with thermal conduction ,",
    "the hard x - ray emission is small to begin with , and the effect of the explosion on the hardness ratio is not as noticeable .",
    "the predicted q values obtained in our numerical models are similar to those obtained by @xcite for dem l50 and dem l152 .",
    "nevertheless , the specific details and assumptions of our simulations make it hard to establish direct comparisons to specific observed bubbles . in order to use the hardness ratio to predict some of the physical processes that occur or have occurred in the super - bubbles we would need to separately simulate the specific physical details , such as the position and mass and energy injection rates of each star , the ism density , of each particular bubble , which is out of the scope of this work .",
    "in this paper we present 3d hydrodynamical models of the evolution of the soft and hard thermal x - ray luminosities produced inside superbubbles driven by massive stellar winds including the effect of a supernova explosion and thermal conduction .    in all models",
    "we include the injection of mass and energy by a cluster of wind sources and a single sn event .",
    "we have varied the position of the sn with respect to the centre of the cluster as well as the detonation time .",
    "also , we have worked out models with a uniform metallicity and models in which the environment , the winds and the sn have different metallicities .",
    "the metallicities are used to calculate the radiative cooling rate , and has an effect on the emissivity in x - rays .",
    "we have also taken into account the effects of thermal conduction in two of the models .    in the models with different metallicities we used @xmath184 for the environment , @xmath156 for the winds and @xmath80 for the sn ejecta .",
    "our models show that the contribution of the metallicity of the winds and the supernova remnant is negligible for the soft x - ray emission of superbubbles , but becomes important for the hard x - ray component . in these models",
    "the ratio of soft to hard maximum luminosity can be as extreme as @xmath130 ( i.e. the hard x - ray luminosity reaches 10% of the one for soft x - rays ) .",
    "the models with thermal conduction result in a noticeable increase in the total luminosity of soft x - rays , by a factor of @xmath185 . however , this factor is smaller than the two orders of magnitude difference predicted in the standard model of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the differences are likely to come from the fact that the standard model of @xcite considers just a single star , and the extension to a star cluster in @xcite and @xcite does not account for the cooling of the gas due to the interaction of the stellar winds .",
    "thermal conduction has a slightly larger effect on the total integrated emission of hard x - rays , increasing the luminosity by a factor of @xmath186 .",
    "the most important contribution to the emission of soft and hard x - rays is produced by the injection of mass and energy by supernova explosions . in soft",
    "x - rays the luminosity increases by up to two orders of magnitude when we consider a supernova explosion placed at the cluster centre , and up to three orders when it explodes at the edge the star cluster .",
    "another important factor to consider is the time during which the luminosity remains high ( i.e. observable ) .",
    "we show that when off - centre supernova events occur ( close to the shell ) the luminosity can increase by one or two orders of magnitude above that predicted by the standard model without sn , and that it can be maintained by a few tens of thousands of years . indeed , as the supernova explosion occurs closer to the shell of swept up ism , the maximum luminosity of soft x - rays as well as the time interval during which luminosity is enhanced increase .",
    "an important increase in the maximum soft x - ray luminosity is produced when the sn ejecta collide with the dense shell of swept up ism gas left behind by its interaction with the cluster wind . in these cases x - ray luminosities of @xmath128  erg  s@xmath6 can be achieved . on the other hand ,",
    "superbubbles where the sn explosions have not taken place near the shell , such as n70 and n185 ( @xcite and @xcite ) , have lower x - ray luminosity , and can be explained using our models with a slightly off - centre sn .    in clusters without sn events , or with a sn placed at the centre of the cluster ,",
    "the contribution to the luminosity made by the sn is hard to observe , in particular because the observable flux increase in the soft x - ray emission lasts for a short time .",
    "this could be happening in massive stellar clusters in the galaxy , such as arches , quintuplet and ngc3603 , that have a hundred massive stars with a total observed x - ray emission of @xmath187  erg  s@xmath6 .",
