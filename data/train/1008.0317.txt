    "the recent observation of spiral ( helical ) magnetic ground states in several chain cuprates , such as livcuo@xmath4 , licu@xmath5o@xmath5 , nacu@xmath5o@xmath5 , li@xmath5zrcuo@xmath4 , and li@xmath5cuo@xmath5 @xcite , which were identified as quasi - one - dimensional ( 1d ) frustrated spin-@xmath8 magnets with ferromagnetic ( fm ) nearest - neighbor ( nn ) in - chain @xmath2 and antiferromagnetic ( afm ) next - nearest - neighbor ( nnn ) in - chain interactions @xmath3 has stimulated intensive investigations of frustrated 1d heisenberg ferromagnets , see , e.g. , refs.@xcite .",
    "the 1d @xmath2-@xmath3 model considered in the most theoretical papers may serve only as the minimal model to describe the magnetic properties of these materials .",
    "several extensions , such as exchange anisotropy @xcite or interchain coupling@xcite might be relevant to explain experiments .",
    "in addition to the nn and nnn exchange integrals , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , also an exchange coupling to 3rd neighbors , i.e. @xmath0 , or even couplings to farther distant neighbors could play a role in real materials .",
    "one mechanism to induce such exchange interactions is strong spin - phonon interaction for frustrated chains within the antiadiabatic limit @xcite .",
    "even if these additional couplings are small , their influence on the spiral ground state ( gs ) correlations might be noticeable .",
    "in particular , there is a significant influence of @xmath0 on the critical frustration @xmath6 at which the fm gs gives way for the spiral gs , see below . except the possible relevance of the @xmath2-@xmath3-@xmath0 model for real materials",
    "the consideration of such a model is interesting in its own right as a basic model to study frustration effects in 1d quantum spin systems .",
    "moreover , very recently it has been argued that the magnetic properties of the kagome - like mineral volborthite cu@xmath9v@xmath5o@xmath10(oh)@xmath112h@xmath5o can be described by an effective chain model with farther distant frustrating exchange couplings@xcite .",

    "here we use the coupled cluster method ( ccm ) for infinite chains complemented by exact diagonalization ( ed ) of finite chains ( periodic boundary conditions imposed ) to investigate spiral gs correlations .",
    "both methods have been successfully applied to study the spiral ordering of the @xmath2-@xmath3 model@xcite . in refs.@xcite",
    "it was demonstrated that the ccm results are in good agreement with the dmrg data .",
    "however , in order to take into account the @xmath0 bonds properly , we go beyond the so - called sub2 - 3 approximation used in refs . @xcite and consider an improved approximation , namely the lsub@xmath16 approximation , see below .    the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "[ ccm ] we provide a brief illustration of the ccm and describe its application on the considered model . in sec .",
    "[ results ] our results for the fm - spiral phase transition and for the pitch angle in the spiral phase are presented and discussed . in sec .",
    "[ summary ] we summarize our findings .",
    "first we discuss the gs of the classical model ( spin quantum number @xmath17 ) . for the usual @xmath2-@xmath3 model ,",
    "i.e. the model with @xmath18 , @xmath19 , studied in many papers the critical frustration @xmath3 is @xmath20 .",
    "for @xmath21 there is a spiral gs with a canting angle between nn ( pitch angle ) @xmath22 given by @xmath23 and two decoupled afm chains at @xmath24 .",
    "noteworthy , @xmath6 is unaffected by quantum effects , see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite .    if farther afm couplings @xmath13 ( @xmath25 ) are relevant the destabilzation of the fm gs sets in for smaller values of @xmath3 . extending the classical model including arbitrary @xmath26 ( @xmath19 )",
    "one finds for the critical nn exchange @xmath27 this expression has been derived assuming a _ continuous _ transition between the fm and the spiral gs s .",
    "it holds for arbitrary afm long - range couplings @xmath13 with @xmath25 . in case that some of the exchange couplings are fm , i.e. @xmath28 for certain @xmath29 , the eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) holds only if the afm couplings dominate .",

    "even a tiny but fairly long range ferromagnetic coupling may introduce a discontinuous behavior at the critical point .",
    "for the sake of brevity , we will outline only some important features of the ccm which are relevant for the model under consideration .",
    "the interested reader can find more details concerning the application of the ccm on the frustrated heisenberg magnets with non - collinear gs s in refs .",
    "@xcite . for more general aspects of the methodology of the ccm , see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "first we mention that the ccm approach yields results in the thermodynamic limit @xmath52 . the starting point for a ccm calculation",
    "is the choice of a normalized reference ( or model ) state @xmath53 . related to this reference state we then define a set of mutually commuting multispin creation operators @xmath54 , which are themselves defined over a complete set of many - body configurations @xmath55 . for the considered frustrated spin system",
    "we choose a spiral reference state with spiral spin orientations along the chains ( i.e. , pictorially , @xmath56 ) characterized by a pitch angle @xmath22 , i.e. @xmath57 .",
    "such states include the fm state ( @xmath34 ) as well as the nel state ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "next , we perform a rotation of the local axis of the spins such that all spins in the reference state align along the negative @xmath59 axis . this rotation by an appropriate local angle @xmath60 of the spin on lattice site @xmath61 is equivalent to the spin - operator transformation @xmath62 where @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 are the spin operators in the rotated coordinate frame .",
    "the local rotation angle @xmath60 is related to the pitch angle @xmath22 of the spiral reference state by @xmath66 . in this new set of local spin coordinates the reference state and the corresponding multispin creation operators @xmath54 are given by @xmath67 where the indices @xmath68 denote arbitrary lattice sites .",
    "in the rotated coordinate frame the hamiltonian becomes dependent on the pitch angle @xmath22 .",
    "it reads @xmath69({\\hat s}_{n}^+{\\hat s}_{n+m}^-+{\\hat s}_{n}^-{\\hat s}_{n+m}^+)\\nonumber \\\\ & + & [ \\cos(m\\gamma)-1]({\\hat s}_{n}^+{\\hat",
    "s}_{n+m}^++{\\hat s}_{n}^-{\\hat s}_{n+m}^- ) + 2\\sin(m\\gamma)[{\\hat s}_{n}^+{\\hat s}_{n+m}^z \\nonumber \\\\    & - &    { \\hat s}_{n}^z { \\hat s}_{n+m}^+   + { \\hat s}_{n}^-{\\hat s}_{n+m}^z-{\\hat s}_{n}^z{\\hat s}_{n+m}^-]+4\\cos(m\\gamma){\\hat s}_{n}^z{\\hat s}_{n+m}^z,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath70 .    with the set @xmath71 the ccm parametrization of the exact ket gs eigenvector @xmath72 of the many - body system is given by @xmath73 contains the correlation coefficients @xmath74 , which can be determined by the so - called set of the ccm ket - state equations @xmath75 where @xmath76 .",
    "each ket - state equation belongs to a specific creation operator @xmath77 , i.e. it corresponds to a specific set ( configuration ) of lattice sites @xmath78 . by using the schrdinger equation , @xmath79 , we can write the gs energy as @xmath80 , which depends ( in a certain ccm approximation , see below ) on the pitch angle @xmath22 .",
    "+ in the quantum model the pitch angle may be different from the corresponding classical value @xmath81 .",
    "therefore , we do not choose the classical result for the pitch angle in the quantum model , rather , we consider @xmath22 as a free parameter in the ccm calculation , which has to be determined by minimization of the ccm gs energy @xmath82 , i.e. @xmath83 .",
    "+ for the many - body quantum system under consideration it is necessary to use approximation schemes in order to truncate the expansions of @xmath84 in eq .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) in a practical calculation . in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite it has been demonstrated , that for the @xmath2-@xmath3 model the so - called sub2 - 3 approximation leads to results of comparable accuracy to those obtained using the dmrg method @xcite . in this approximation",
    "all configurations are included which span a range of no more than @xmath85 contiguous sites and contain only @xmath86 or fewer spins .",
    "taking into account the @xmath0 bond we have to extent this approximation in order to take into account configurations including a range of @xmath16 contiguous sites .",
    "the corresponding approximation is the so - called lsub4 approximation , see e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite . within this approximation",
    "multispin creation operators of one , two , three or four spins distributed on clusters of four contiguous lattice sites are included .",
    "in addition , for the determination of the quantum tricitical point we have also used higher lsub@xmath87 approximations , see sec .",
    "[ results ] .",
    "however , the numerical complexity increases tremendously , since ( i ) the number of ket - state equations ( [ eq6 ] ) increases exponentially with @xmath87 , ( ii ) there are two free parameters @xmath3 , @xmath0 which have to be varied by very small increments to find the transition points , and ( iii ) the determination of the quantum pitch angle @xmath88 itself requires the iterative minimization of the ground state energy for each set of @xmath3 , @xmath0 .",
    "hence , except for the determination of the quantum tricitical point , we have restricted our ccm calculations to the ccm - lsub4 approximation .",
    "in what follows we set @xmath89 if not stated otherwise explicitly . the phase diagram of the @xmath2-@xmath3-@xmath0 chain with fm @xmath89 obtained by the ccm and by the ed is shown in fig .  [ trans ] . for the classical as well as for the quantum model the transition from the fm to the spiral gs can be second ( @xmath90 ) or first order ( @xmath91 ) , i.e. , the pitch angle @xmath22 does ( first order ) or does not ( second order ) jump from @xmath34 to a finite value @xmath92 at the transition . the tricritical point @xmath93 ,",
    "i.e. that point at the transition line where the second - order transition goes over in a first - order transition is @xmath94 for the classical model @xcite , see the black square in fig .",
    "[ trans ] . due to quantum fluctuations this point",
    "is shifted to smaller values of @xmath95 .",
    "the lsub4-ccm estimate for the quantum tricritical point is @xmath96 , see the red square in fig .",
    "[ trans ] .",
    "this result is quite close to the spin - wave result @xcite @xmath97 .",
    "we have determined the quantum tricritical point also using higher ccm - lsub@xmath87 approximations , namely lsub6 , lsub8 and lsub10 .",
    "the corresponding results are @xmath98 , @xmath99 , and @xmath100 . obviously , these values are quite close to each other , and there is a slight shift towards @xmath101 of ref .",
    "@xcite when increasing the order of ccm approximation .",
    "the ed data for the transition line are in very good agreement with the ccm data .",
    "there is only a slight deviation for stronger fm @xmath0 bonds , i.e. for @xmath102 .",
    "note , however , that in a tiny interval @xmath103 for finite chains the transition from the fully polarized fm state with total spin @xmath104 is not directly to a singlet state with @xmath105 , rather there are some intermediate states with @xmath106 . to give an example , for @xmath107 and @xmath108",
    "there is a sequence of transitions from the fm state to a singlet gs via partially polarized states in the interval @xmath109 .",
    "the estimation of the the tricritical point by ed is @xmath110 , cf .",
    "note that for @xmath111 the classical and quantum transition lines coincide , i.e. the relation @xmath112 is valid also for the quantum model .",
    "due to the quite large prefactor @xmath113 , already a weak 3rd neighbor coupling @xmath0 has a noticeable effect on the critical @xmath114 . for @xmath115 the transition point of the quantum model",
    "is shifted to smaller values of frustrating @xmath3 .",
    "that is to some extent surprising , since in most of the previous studies of models exhibiting a transition between a spiral and a collinear gs in the quantum model the opposite behavior has been found , i.e. , the transition to the spiral gs is shifted to higher values of frustration , see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite .    to illustrate the quantum tricritical point in more detail we show in fig .",
    "[ gamma ] the ccm results for the pitch angle versus @xmath3 for various values of @xmath0 around @xmath116 . for comparison",
    "we show also the classic pitch angle @xmath117 .",
    "it can be clearly seen how the continuous behavior of the pitch angle @xmath22 goes over into a discontinuous one .",
    "interestingly , at a particular value of @xmath118 the curves cross each other , i.e. the pitch angle is independent of @xmath0 . for the classical model",
    "the crossing point is at @xmath119 and the corresponding pitch angle is @xmath120 . for the quantum model the curves do not cross exactly in a point ,",
    "rather they approach each other very closely at @xmath121 .",
    "the pitch angle at that point is @xmath122 .",
    "furthermore the quantum pitch angle @xmath88 approaches the limiting value @xmath123 for much smaller values of @xmath3 than the classical one .    in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we present the height of the jump @xmath42 at the transition point in dependence on @xmath0 . for the classical model @xmath42 is given by eq.([eq_nr_1 ] ) for @xmath124 . for the quantum model the @xmath125 curve",
    "is characterized by two nearly linear regimes , one regime ( near the quantum tricritical point ) with a steep increase of @xmath42 and a second , almost flat one for @xmath126 .",
    "this scenario is confirmed by the ed results for the nn spin - spin correlation function shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] which may serve as a finite - chain analogue of the infinite - chain pitch angle .",
    "finally , let us discuss the pitch angle which appears in the limits of large @xmath3 or large @xmath127 .",
    "this limiting value of @xmath128 is the maximal pitch angle and it is monotonously approached from below increasing the corresponding bond @xmath3 or @xmath95 while fixing the other one . for @xmath129 ( and finite @xmath95 )",
    "the pitch angle approaches @xmath130 .",
    "in this limit the system splits into two decoupled afm chains with coupling strength @xmath3 .",
    "for @xmath131 ( and finite @xmath3 ) the pitch angle approaches @xmath132 , i.e. only acute pitch angles appear .",
    "for @xmath133 ( and finite @xmath3 ) the pitch angle approaches @xmath134 , i.e. by contrast to the pure @xmath2-@xmath3 model also obtuse pitch angles appear . as it is obvious from fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] pitch angles @xmath135 appear already for quite moderate values of @xmath0 .",
    "we mention that the above discussion is not purely academic , since at least values @xmath136 might be realized also in real materials , e.g.  in nacu@xmath5o@xmath5@xcite .",
    "using the coupled - cluster method ( ccm ) and the lanczos exact diagonalization technique ( ed ) we have studied the influence of a third - neighbor exchange @xmath0 on the gs of the spin-@xmath1 heisenberg chain with fm nn interaction @xmath2 and frustrating afm nnn interaction @xmath3 . in particular , we have analyzed the transition from the fm gs ( present for dominating @xmath2 ) to a singlet gs with incommensurate short - range spiral correlations .",
    "the results obtained by these two different approximations agree well .",
    "moreover , the finite - size effects inherent in the ed study appeared to be small .",
    "we have found , that in case of an afm coupling @xmath0 the fm - spiral transition point @xmath6 of the quantum model coincides with that of the classical model , and it is always continuous .",
    "however , the quantum pitch angle significantly deviates from the classical one . for a fm coupling @xmath0 quantum fluctuations shift the fm - spiral transition point @xmath6 to smaller values , and",
    "the transition becomes discontinuous .",
