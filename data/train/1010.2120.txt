    "the case @xmath241 describes the interaction between two identical copolymer stars .    finally , we conclude , that in all situations considered above , the presence of correlated disorder leads to an increase of the contact exponent .",
    "the stronger the correlation ( the smaller the value of correlation parameter @xmath242 ) , the stronger is the interaction between polymers in such an environment .",
    "let us recall , that the exponent @xmath243 corresponds to the situations of two interacting homogeneous polymer stars of @xmath153 and @xmath207 arms in solution in the presence of long - range - correlated disorder .",
    "this problem has previously been analyzed @xcite using a two - loop expansion series for @xmath244 in @xmath21 .",
    "the quantitative estimates obtained predict a decrease of the contact exponents with the strength of the disorder correlations in contrast to our present @xmath245-expansion results . revising the resummation",
    "as performed in @xcite we conclude that the number of terms in the two - loop expansion is probably too small to rely on those quantitative results .",
    "in the present paper , we have studied the scaling properties of copolymer stars , consisting of @xmath31 arms of polymer species 1 and @xmath32 arms of species 2 in a solution in which one or more of the intra- and interspecies interactions are found to be at their @xmath35-point with the further complication of a disordered environment with correlated structural defects .",
    "we assume that the disorder is correlated with a power - law decay of the pair correlation function @xmath0 at large distance @xmath5 .",
    "this type of disorder is known to be relevant for simple polymer chains @xcite and homogeneous polymer stars @xcite , and we address the question of the scaling of copolymer stars in this situation .    considering the @xmath31-arm absorbing star polymer with a special trap placed at the center of the star where @xmath32 free particles ( rws ) are to be trapped simultaneously , the reaction rate of this diffusion - limited reaction is found to scale with exponents , connected to the spectrum of critical exponents @xmath34 of star copolymers",
    "such a process is an example of a so - called diffusion - limited reaction , with the rate depending on the sum of diffusion coefficients of the reactants .",
    "another example , where star exponents govern physical behavior concerns the short - range interaction between the cores of star polymers in a good solvent .",
    "the present study aims to analyze the impact of structural disorder in the environment on these processes .    in the frames of the field - theoretical renormalization group approach , we obtain estimates for the critical exponents",
    "@xmath34 up to the first order of an @xmath246-expansion , which belong to a new universality class",
    ". in particular , this enables us to conclude that the rates of diffusion - limited reactions are slowed down by the presence of long - range - correlated disorder .",
    "the crucial point is that while long - range correlated disorder apparently does not influence the rws and thus the universal behavior of diffusion itself , the fact that the absorbing polymer changes its conformation in the lr background leads to a change of the rate with which particles are absorbed ( or catalyzed ) on specific sites of the polymer .",
    "the contact exponents , governing the repulsive interaction between two star copolymers in correlated disorder , are found to be larger than in the pure solution case .",
    "the stronger the correlation of the defects , the stronger is the interaction between polymers in such a disordered environment .",
