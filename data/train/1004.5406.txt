    "the study of relaxors has grown dramatically over the past two decades .",
    "while many interesting properties distinguish relaxors from conventional ferroelectrics , the hallmark of relaxors is a highly frequency - dependent dielectric response that peaks broadly at a temperature that is unrelated to any structural phase transition .",
    "@xcite although the origin of many relaxor properties are still not well understood , most researchers tend to agree that the chemical short - range order in these materials , which are primarily compositionally disordered oxides , plays a key role in determining the bulk response .",
    "@xcite in the case of the well - known lead - based , perovskite abo@xmath2 relaxors pb(mg@xmath0nb@xmath1)o@xmath2  ( pmn ) and pb(zn@xmath0nb@xmath1)o@xmath2  ( pzn ) ,  @xcite the mixture of 2@xmath7 and 5@xmath7 b - site cations leads to local charge imbalances that create random fields that destroy long - range polar order . on the other hand short - range polar order ,",
    "more commonly known as polar nanoregions ( pnr ) , appears at temperatures well above the temperature at which the dielectric susceptibility reaches a maximum ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "@xcite there have been substantial experimental evidences exist that suggest the pnr influence various bulk properties of relaxors such as the thermal expansion in pmn ,  @xcite the piezoelectric coefficients in pmn doped with pbtio@xmath2 ( pmn-@xmath9pt ) ,  @xcite and the transverse acoustic phonon lifetimes in pzn doped with 4.5%  pbtio@xmath2 ( pzn-4.5%pt ) .",
    "@xcite however , unlike the chemical short - range order , which is quenched and thus does not change with temperature , the polar short - range order ( pnr ) is sensitive to both temperature and external electric fields .",
    "it has therefore been the focus of numerous studies .",
    "different techniques including dielectric spectroscopy ,  @xcite raman scattering ,  @xcite and piezoelectric force microscopy  @xcite have been used to explore the behavior of pnr in relaxor systems . yet the most effective and direct probe of pnr within bulk relaxor samples is arguably obtained through measurements of the corresponding diffuse scattering , which reflects the presence of short - range ordered , atomic displacements .",
    "@xcite many neutron  @xcite and x - ray diffuse  @xcite scattering studies have been performed to determine the structure , polarization , and other properties of pnr .",
    "it has been shown that the diffuse scattering in pure pmn , pzn , and their solid solutions with low pbtio@xmath2 ( pt ) doping , exhibits very similar behavior .",
    "@xcite in all cases , the diffuse scattering intensities are strongly anisotropic , varying with brillouin zone , and can be affected by an external electric field .",
    "most neutron and x - ray diffuse scattering studies also agree that the diffuse scattering in both pmn-@xmath9pt and pzn-@xmath9pt systems extends preferentially along @xmath4 in reciprocal space .",
    "this diffuse scattering is rod - shaped but adopts an `` x '' or butterfly shape when measured in the ( hk0 ) scattering plane near reflections of the form @xmath10 .",
    "detailed analysis indicates that the butterfly - shaped diffuse scattering is associated with short - range ordered , ionic displacements oriented along @xmath11  @xcite and couples strongly to transverse acoustic ( ta ) phonons propagating along @xmath4 ( ta@xmath12 modes ) .",
    "@xcite for this reason we shall refer to it as `` t2-diffuse scattering '' in this article .",
    "the t2-diffuse scattering intensities come from pnr composed of ionic displacements that are neither purely strain ( no relative changes between a , b , and o site positions ) nor purely polar ( only relative changes between a , b , and o site positions ) , which suggests that the local atomic structure both within and around the pnr is very complicated .",
    "@xcite    when an external electric field is applied along [ 111 ] , the t2-diffuse scattering intensities are redistributed between different rods of diffuse scattering , while the overall diffuse scattering intensity appears to be conserved [ see panels ( a ) and ( b ) of fig .  [ fig:1 ] ] .",
    "@xcite however when an external field is applied along [ 001 ] , the t2-diffuse scattering is essentially unchanged .",
    "@xcite at the same time , there is evidence that suggests the presence of another type of diffuse scattering different from the t2-diffuse scattering . for example , gehring _",
    "et al_.  found that the diffuse scattering measured in pzn-8%pt near ( 003 ) along [ 100 ] , i.  e.  in a transverse direction , is strongly suppressed by an external [ 001 ] field , whereas that measured near ( 300 ) along [ 001 ] remains unaffected .",
    "@xcite this effect has been confirmed in our measurements on pzn-4.5%pt [ see panels ( c ) and ( d ) of fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ] and can not be explained by a simple redistribution of the t2-diffuse scattering .    in this article",
    "we report diffuse scattering measurements made under a [ 001]-oriented electric field on the relaxor ferroelectric pzn-4.5%pt at reduced wavevectors @xmath13 offset from various bragg peaks along @xmath14 in the ( h0l ) zone [ refer to the dashed lines in panel ( c ) of fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ] .",
    "we show that , in addition to the t2-diffuse scattering , which dominates the total diffuse scattering intensity in most cases , there is another component of diffuse scattering which is primarily distributed along @xmath14 .",
    "we shall refer to this component as `` t1-diffuse scattering '' because of its similarities in both polarization and propagation direction to that of t1 phonon modes in perovskite systems .",
    "the application of a [ 001 ] electric field has no obvious effect on the t1-diffuse scattering which is associated with short - range ordered , ionic displacements polarized along [ 100 ] , but strongly suppresses the diffuse scattering which is associated with short - range ordered , ionic displacements polarized along [ 001 ] .",
    "this effect is most prominent at temperatures slightly below @xmath15k .",

    "two pyrolytic graphite filters were placed before and after the sample to minimize the presence of neutrons with higher - order wavelengths . an external electric field @xmath16kv / cm was applied along [ 001 ] above 550k during all of the field - cooled ( fc ) measurements .",

    "@xcite linear @xmath13-scans of the diffuse scattering intensity measured at 400k under both fc and zfc conditions are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] .",
    "it is immediately clear that the diffuse scattering intensities are suppressed around ( 003 ) after field cooling whereas no such change occurs around ( 300 ) ; this effect is also evident in panel ( b ) of fig .",
    "[ fig:2.5 ] .",
    "these results are consistent with those obtained previously on pzn-8pt .",
    "@xcite at this point it is important to recall that the neutron diffuse scattering cross section resulting from correlated ionic displacements is proportional to @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is a unit vector along the displacement direction ( for a more detailed discussion see section .  [ calculation ] )",
    ". therefore measurements of the diffuse scattering intensity made near ( 300 ) are mainly sensitive to short - range ordered ionic displacements oriented along [ 100 ] while those made near ( 003 ) reflect the presence of ordered ionic displacements oriented along [ 001 ] .",
    "the data shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] therefore suggests that the short - range ordered ionic displacements oriented along [ 001 ] are significantly suppressed by an external electric field applied along [ 001 ] .",
    "this scattering is what we refer to as t1-diffuse scattering .",
    "mesh scans were also performed to map out the geometry of the diffuse scattering intensity distributions around various bragg peaks under different conditions .",

    "the corresponding intensity contour maps measured under fc conditions are shown in panels ( c ) and ( d ) . near ( 300 ) , the fc mesh scan reveals a shape that is very similar to that obtained under zfc conditions ; however the one measured near ( 003 ) appears to be slightly narrower , but only in the direction transverse ( [ 100 ] ) to the scattering vector @xmath31 .",
    "this asymmetry is important because it implies that the t1-diffuse scattering associated with short - range ordered [ 001 ] ionic displacements is distributed primarily along the transverse direction ( [ 100 ] ) near ( 003 ) but not longitudinally ( i.e.  not along [ 001 ] ) .",
    "this is why we call this scattering `` t1-diffuse scattering '' ; both its polarization and distribution in @xmath13-space resemble that of the t1 phonon mode . on the other hand ,",
    "the butterfly - shaped t2-diffuse scattering , which is strongly affected by an electric field applied along [ 111 ] , is _ not _ affected by an electric field applied along [ 001 ] .",
    "apparently the t2-diffuse scattering dominates the diffuse scattering intensity measured at most @xmath13 values ; the presence of the t1-diffuse scattering component only becomes evident through a change in its intensity once an external electric field is applied along [ 001 ] .",
    "our measurements near ( 300 ) and ( 003 ) suggest that an [ 001]-oriented electric field can only reduce the diffuse scattering intensities associated with ionic displacements that are parallel to the field .",
    "to test this idea further , we studied the diffuse scattering intensity near ( 101 ) as well .",
    "unlike the situation near ( 300 ) and ( 003 ) , both [ 100 ] and [ 001]-oriented atomic displacements / polarizations will contribute to the overall neutron diffuse scattering cross section near ( 101 ) because then @xmath32 $ ] .",

    "however , as was the case near ( 300 ) , this part of the t1-diffuse scattering is not affected by the external [ 001 ] field as is shown in panel ( c ) of fig .",

    "the temperature dependence of the field - induced suppression of the t1-diffuse scattering is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] .",
    "transverse @xmath13-scans across ( 300 ) and ( 003 ) were measured between 200k and 500k .",
    "these scans were fit to a resolution - limited gaussian function of @xmath13 , used to describe the bragg peak intensity , and a broad lorentzian function of @xmath13 , which describes the diffuse scattering intensity . in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] only the fitted diffuse scattering intensities are plotted versus temperature and @xmath13 and converted into color contour maps .",
    "there are only tiny differences between the zfc ( see panel ( a ) ) and fc ( see panel ( c ) ) measurements made near ( 300 ) ; however the diffuse scattering intensities near ( 003 ) shown in panel ( d ) are strongly suppressed in the fc condition for @xmath37 compared to those measured under zfc conditions ( panel ( b ) ) .",
    "this suppression seems to be largest for temperatures between @xmath28 and @xmath38k , and becomes less pronounced at lower temperatures .",
    "this can be understood if the pnr gradually freeze with cooling and become harder to be influenced by an external field .",
    "another question that has yet to be answered is whether pnr have a static or dynamic origin .",
    "previous work using cold neutron spectrometers , which provide significantly better energy resolution than do thermal neutron spectrometers , have shown that the onset of elastic ( static ) diffuse scattering occurs at much lower temperatures than previously believed , i.  e. well below the burns temperature @xmath39 .",
    "@xcite these results imply that at high temperature the diffuse scattering is ( at least partially ) dynamic in nature . in order to better",
    "probe the energy / time scale of the diffuse scattering , we have performed spin - echo measurements on the same pzn-4.5%pt single crystal at the reciprocal lattice point ( 0.05,0,1.0 ) at different temperatures .",
    "the diffuse scattering intensities shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] have been corrected for the instrumental resolution and plotted in the form of @xmath40 versus fourier time @xmath41 .",
    "these intensity plots can in fact provide information on how much of the total diffuse scattering at this * q * is static .",
    "one sees that at high temperature ( @xmath42k ) , the diffuse scattering intensity decays to @xmath43 within @xmath44ns . in other words ,",
    "less than 40% of the diffuse scattering is static , while the rest of the intensity is dynamic in nature having a relaxation time less than @xmath45ns ( see eqn .",
    "[ eqn:4 ] ) , which corresponds to an energy half width of @xmath46mev . on cooling the relative size of the static diffuse scattering component increases ,",
    "which is consistent with freezing of the pnr .",
    "at 200k , the diffuse scattering is almost completely static ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "these results are qualitatively similar to those obtained on pure pmn by stock _",
    "et al_.  @xcite    we have also studied the effect of an external field along [ 001 ] on the diffuse scattering measured at 400k . at ( 0.05,0,1 ) we should be sensitive to the t1-diffuse scattering associated with [ 001 ] ionic displacements , which should be partially suppressed by the [ 001 ] field .",
    "we find that , although the overall diffuse scattering intensity is reduced by the field , the static ratio @xmath48 at large fourier times is not affected .",
    "however , the dynamic component decays much faster when the sample is fc compared to zfc .",
    "the lines through the data shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] are based on fits to a one parameter decay function @xmath49 in table  [ tab:3 ] , we list the temperature dependence of these parameters , including the static fraction @xmath50 , and the relaxation time @xmath51 , as well as the energy half width at half maximum @xmath52 . at 400k , @xmath53ns under zfc conditions and @xmath54ns under fc conditions .",

    "the energy width ( half width at half maximum , hwhm ) is calculated from @xmath57 [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab:2 ]",
    "our neutron scattering measurements clearly show that in addition to the well - known butterfly - shaped diffuse scattering , a second , distinct , diffuse scattering component also exists in the pzn-@xmath9pt relaxor system .",
    "this so - called t1-diffuse scattering can be differentiated from the butterfly - shaped t2-diffuse scattering through its dependence on an @xmath14-oriented electric field .",
    "quantitative analysis of the short - range ordered , @xmath14-oriented , ionic displacements associated with the t1-diffuse scattering suggest that both acoustic / strain and optic / polar ionic displacements are present , a situation that is very similar to that for the t2-diffuse scattering .",
    "spin - echo measurements also show that the diffuse scattering cross section exhibits a large dynamic component at high temperature paraelectric phase above @xmath28 and gradually freezes , becoming almost entirely static for temperatures well below @xmath28 in the ferroelectric phase .",
    "the electric field dependence of the t1 and t2-diffuse scattering cross sections are quite different ; this implies that they might originate from independent nano - scale polar structures . on the other hand",
    ", they are very similar in many other aspects : both exhibit strain / polar components and both freeze with cooling .",
    "this raises another scenario in which the two diffuse scattering components might be associated within different @xmath14 and @xmath4 components of the ionic displacements with the same nano - scale polar structure .",
    "the average local atomic shifts in these nano - scale structures could very well be along other directions , e.g. , along @xmath58 directions as suggested by neutron pair distribution function ( pdf ) measurements from pmn  @xcite .",
    "the neutron diffuse scattering intensities that we observe here arise only from one or more components of these local displacements that become spatially short - range ordered .",
    "any components of atomic displacements that are entirely disordered will only contribute to the overall background and will not affect the diffuse scattering intensities discussed in this work .",
    "our data do not allow us to determine definitively which scenario is correct , thus more detailed studies are clearly required .",
    "however , our results do strongly suggest that when studying pnr in relaxor systems , the existence of complex nano - scale polar structures composed of both @xmath14 and @xmath4-oriented ionic displacements will have to be carefully taken into consideration ; indeed , these may affect the lifetimes of phonons propagating along these two sets of directions .",
