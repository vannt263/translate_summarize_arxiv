    "observational evidence @xcite indicates that approximately 70% of the energy density in the universe is in the form of a negative - pressure component , called dark energy , with the remaining 30% in the form of nonrelativistic matter .",
    "the dark energy component can be characterized by its equation of state parameter , @xmath3 , defined as the ratio of the dark energy pressure to its density : @xmath4 where a cosmological constant , @xmath5 , corresponds to @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "while a model with a cosmological constant and cold dark matter ( @xmath5cdm ) is consistent with current observations , there are many models for dark energy that predict a dynamical equation of state .",

    "we extend and generalize this previous work by deriving the exact conditions for stability for power law potentials , extending this discussion to exponential potentials , and examining noncanonical quintessence in the limit where the potential is nearly flat and the model is close to @xmath5cdm .",
    "canonical quintessence models with power - law or exponential potentials were among the first to be investigated @xcite , but these models have serious problems in fitting current observations .",

    "power - law and exponential potentials arise naturally in the context of many different models , so it is important to see whether the noncanonical models examined here can resurrect them as viable quintessence models .",
