    "for the case of the btz black hole , the information about the black hole parameters @xmath61 and @xmath62 is contained in the non - trivial holonomy of the connection @xmath58 around the non - contractible cycle @xmath52 . in the de sitter case the euclidean time is associated with the non - contractible @xmath52 cycle of the solid torus .",
    "this is so because the euclidean continuation of the lorentzian static patch @xmath31 , with @xmath37 as world line of the timelike observer sitting at the center of the disc involves , besides a wick rotation , a compactification of this line to obtain a solid torus .",

    "the variable conjugate to this holonomy is the holonomy around the other ( contractible ) cycle , which is _ not _ fixed any more to the classical value given by @xmath65 for de sitter space .",
    "we must sum over contributions from all possible values of @xmath78 in the partition function .",
    "this corresponds to starting with the value of @xmath55 for the classical solution , i.e. with @xmath65 in ( [ trh ] ) , and then considering all other shifts of @xmath55 of the form @xmath79 where @xmath80 is an arbitrary number .",
    "this is implemented by a translation operator of the form @xmath81 however , this operator is not gauge invariant . the only gauge - invariant way of implementing these translations is through verlinde operators of the form @xmath82 where @xmath83 .",

    "thus , taking into account all states with different shifted values of @xmath55 as in @xmath89 means that we have to take into account all the states in the boundary corresponding to the insertion of such wilson lines .",
    "these are the states @xmath90 given in ( [ c3 ] ) .",
    "\\(b ) in order to obtain the final partition function , we must also integrate over all values of the modular parameter @xmath68 , i.e. over all inequivalent tori with the same holonomy around the non - contractible cycle .",
    "the integrand , which is a function of @xmath55 and @xmath68 , must be the square of the partition function of a gauged @xmath91 wess - zumino model corresponding to the two @xmath3 chern - simons theories",
    ". it must be modular invariant  modular invariance corresponds to invariance under large diffeomorphisms of the torus .",
    "the partition function is then of the form @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the modular invariant measure , and the integration is over a fundamental domain in the @xmath68 plane . coefficients @xmath94 must be chosen such that the integrand is modular invariant .    as discussed in @xcite ,",

    "expression for the canonical partition function of quantum gravity on @xmath0 .",
    "we now proceed to compute the partition function by substituting in the expression above the values of @xmath55 and @xmath60 from ( [ uubar ] ) with @xmath65 .",
    "we work in the regime where @xmath86 ( and therefore @xmath97 ) is large .",
    "also , we must perform an analytic continuation to get the lorentzian result - this is done by taking @xmath98 , and @xmath99 . for the regime",
    "when @xmath86 is large , the leading contribution to the sum in the integrand comes from @xmath100 as in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath101 integral can in fact be done exactly .",
    "we have @xmath102 where @xmath103 , and @xmath104 is the bessel function of imaginary argument . using the approximation for the bessel function with large argument @xmath105 \\label{asyk}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the replacement @xmath41 for de sitter space , we get , in the large @xmath86 regime :    @xmath106    the form of the partition function indicates that at leading order , it is of the form @xmath107 , where @xmath108 is the semi - classical entropy . since this is the partition function in the canonical ensemble , we would have expected an additional term @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the energy of de sitter space .",
    "the notion of energy in asymptotically de sitter spaces needs to be defined carefully , due to the absence of a global timelike killing vector .",
    "the energy @xmath110 that emerges in our formalism is defined on the horizon , and not at asymptotic infinity , as has been done , for e.g in @xcite .",
    "our result seems to indicate that that energy @xmath110 is zero for de sitter space .",
    "such a result coincides with the definition of energy as given by abbott and deser @xcite . the canonical partition function at leading order is therefore the same as the density of states .",
    "the multiplicative prefactor in ( [ cpf ] ) is the leading correction to the semi - classical result .",
    "the entropy is therefore @xmath111 the leading term is the semi - classical bekenstein - hawking entropy that is proportional to the horizon  area \" .",
    "the second term is the leading correction that is logarithmic in area . in the following sections , we discuss in detail the results we have obtained - on the nature of the quantum fluctuations , and the logarithmic correction we have seen above .",
    "in our set - up , from the choice of ensemble and considerations of gauge invariance , the partition function ( [ dspf ] ) involved insertion of closed wilson lines of spins @xmath112 , @xmath71 .",
    "these correspond to defects centered at the origin of the @xmath26 coordinate in ( [ eucmet2 ] ) , i.e around the worldline of the timelike observer . as is well - known",
    ", such defects correspond to point masses in @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "a point mass in @xmath0 can be described in static coordinates by the metric @xmath113 where now @xmath114 and @xmath115 with @xmath116 as the radius of the cosmological horizon .",
    "let us consider the static patch metric ( [ pointmass ] ) of @xmath0 . near @xmath117 , the origin of the @xmath26 coordinate , it looks like minkowski space",
    ". then metric ( [ pointmass ] ) near @xmath117 can be rewritten as the minkowski metric @xmath118 where @xmath119 , @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "but since @xmath26 had a periodicity @xmath27 , @xmath122 has a periodicity @xmath123 .",
    "thus the deficit angle at @xmath117 is @xmath124 , i.e @xmath125 . when @xmath126 , the deficit is zero , and we have de sitter space .    in the partition function ( [ dspf ] )",
    ", there is a discrete sum over deficits in the @xmath26 coordinate - from ( [ ushift ] ) , the deficits are of the form @xmath127 where @xmath85 is an integer taking the maximum value of @xmath86 .",
    "@xmath128 corresponds to de sitter space , i.e no deficit .",
    "thus from the discussion above , we see that @xmath129 .",
    "the maximum deficit possible is @xmath130 .",
    "thus there seems to be a maximum allowed value for the `` mass '' of the point particle , @xmath61 .",
    "interestingly , this relation also implies that @xmath131 , and therefore the mass of the point particle takes only a _",
    "discrete _ number of values , labelled by the integer @xmath85 .",
    "though classically all values of deficit angle between @xmath132 and @xmath27 are allowed , gauge invariant quantization allowed only discrete set of values .",
    "there is another interesting observation : in the computation of the de sitter partition function ( [ dspf ] ) , we set @xmath133 - which corresponds to de sitter space .",
    "thus the partition function describes quantum fluctuations on the de sitter background .",
    "we could instead choose any value of @xmath78 from @xmath132 to @xmath27 .",
    "then the partition function would correspond to fluctuations around a background with the corresponding point mass .",
    "what does that partition function look like ?",
    "the exercise done in the previous section can be repeated for this case - and surprisingly , the leading answer is the same !",
    "quantum fluctuations of any such background are point masses taking the same set of discrete values as above .",
    "the dominant contribution to the partition function again comes from spin @xmath100 , which corresponds to _ empty _ de sitter space . doing the computation carefully ( taking into account the changed value of the temperature ) , we find that to the leading order , the entropy is the same as that of de sitter space , i.e @xmath134 . however , the logarithmic corrections to the entropy are more complicated now and carry the information about the point mass parameter .",
    "all this strongly suggests a quantization of point mass configurations in a quantum theory of gravity on @xmath0 .",
    "also , since the leading contribution to the entropy always comes from empty de sitter space , this presents an explicit realisation of the entropy bound of bousso @xcite in three dimensions .",
    "we note that in the expression for entropy ( [ entropy ] ) , the correction to the bekenstein - hawking entropy is logarithmic in area , with a coefficient @xmath1 .",
    "the logarithmic correction has been observed in many computations of black hole entropy in quantum gravity .",
    "it was first computed for the ( 3 + 1)-d schwarzschild black hole in the quantum geometry formulation of gravity - where , for a large massive black hole , the next order log(area ) correction had a numerical coefficient , @xmath135 @xcite .",
    "subsequently , this correction ( with the same numerical coefficient ! ) has been seen in computations of the ( 2 + 1)-d btz black hole entropy in various approaches @xcite , @xcite , leading to the question of whether this coefficient is universal .",
    "below , we clarify several issues related to the universality of this coefficient .",
    "incidentally , the logarithmic correction with a different coefficient was seen in a one - loop computation of the correction to the entropy of the btz black hole ( of small horizon area ) due to a scalar field @xcite . however , our discussion of the logarithmic coefficient is the correction due to quantum gravity fluctuations , and distinct from corrections due to scalar fields or other matter coupled to the black hole .",
    "the computation of btz black hole entropy in @xcite was done in the same ( chern - simons ) formulation as the de sitter case , and the numerical coefficient of the logarithmic term was @xmath135 , whereas for the de sitter case , it is @xmath1 .",
    "this is somewhat puzzling at first glance .",
    "the black hole entropy was computed in the regime @xmath136 , where @xmath131 is the black hole horizon radius and @xmath97 is the @xmath137 radius of curvature .",
    "then , there was an integral over the modular parameter similar to ( [ dspf ] ) .",
    "the saddle - point for @xmath101 , the imaginary part of the modular parameter occured when @xmath138 .",
    "thus this was the regime when @xmath101 was large .",
    "an interesting observation was made in @xcite that replacing @xmath139 in the black hole partition function by @xmath140 , where now @xmath141 , the @xmath137 gas partition function was obtained , with the coefficient of the correction being @xmath142 .",
    "this corresponds to a situation where the modular parameter @xmath143 is small .",
    "what happens when @xmath144 , i.e @xmath145 ?",
    "in fact , this is very similar to the de sitter case , since the de sitter horizon radius is exactly @xmath97 !",
    "the computation follows similar lines and leads to similar results .",
    "it can in fact be verified directly from ( [ dspf ] ) that the saddle - point is at @xmath146 . here",
    ", we see that the coefficient of the logarithmic correction is @xmath1 .",
    "thus , the coefficient of the correction seems to depend on the regime one is looking at .",
    "when , as in the above case , there are two independent length parameters @xmath97 and @xmath131 , only for @xmath136 do we get the coefficient @xmath135 .    summarising our result for btz black hole",
    "we find : @xmath147 where the last expression in ( [ regimetb ] ) for @xmath148 is the entropy of the ads gas .",
    "the above results are reminiscent of a duality proposed in @xcite between the euclidean btz black hole and lorentzian de sitter spaces . there ,",
    "the classical holonomy of the connection in the black hole case was related to the ratio @xmath139 . from the duality ,",
    "this was also the holonomy of the connection in a de sitter space with a point mass , the mass being related to the parameter @xmath131 .",
    "in particular , vacuum de sitter space corresponds to @xmath149 .",
    "although this duality is only at the level of _ actions _",
    "( for a lorentzian theory with positive @xmath150 and a euclidean one with negative @xmath150 ) , we find here that a btz black hole with horizon radius @xmath149 and vacuum de sitter space have the same entropy - both at the leading and sub - leading order !",
    "let us examine ( [ tau1int ] ) closer to understand how the coefficient of the logarithmic correction in the de sitter case is @xmath1 . using the asymptotic expansion of the bessel function ( [ asyk ] )",
    ", we see that the @xmath101 integration contributes a logarithmic term with a coefficient @xmath151 .",
    "the @xmath152 integration also contributes the same and the coefficient is thus @xmath1 .",
    "entropy of de sitter space can also studied from an alternative point of view by using ds / cft correspondence @xcite . in this framework",
    "all the information about quantum gravity in the bulk is expected to be contained in the conformal field theory at past or future infinity .",
    "the cft is described by considering all possible metric fluctuations keeping the asymptotic behaviour to be de sitter space .",
    "it consists of two copies of virasaro algebras , each with central charge @xmath153 . as shown in @xcite , the eigenvalues of the virasoro generators @xmath154 and @xmath155 for de sitter space are both equal to @xmath156 . using the rademacher expansion for modular forms",
    ", one can generalize the cardy formula for growth of states in a cft beyond the leading term . in @xcite , the sub - leading correction to the entropy of a btz black hole",
    "was determined from this generalisation .",

    "is given by @xmath159 where @xmath160 .",
    "this is the contribution from the virasoro generator @xmath154 .",
    "there is a similar contribution @xmath161 associated with the virasoro generator @xmath155 , given by replacing @xmath40 in the above by @xmath162 , the eigenvalue of @xmath155 .    substituting @xmath153 and @xmath163 in the above",

    "thus , the quantum gravity calculation of de sitter entropy and the entropy computation from the asymptotic cft agree even in the sub - leading correction to the bekenstein - hawking term .",
