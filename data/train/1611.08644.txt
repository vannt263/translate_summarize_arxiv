    "let @xmath1 be a riemann surface with a spectral covering @xmath2 for the group @xmath0 .",
    "in @xcite we proposed in general terms a reduction process that would construct a versal @xmath3-harmonic map to an @xmath0 pre - building .",
    "it was conjectured that if the @xmath3-spectral network @xcite has no bps states then the reduction process should be well - defined .",
    "this conjecture would lead to a precise calculation of the wkb exponents for singular perturbations whose spectral curve has no bps states , generalizing the known picture @xcite for quadratic differentials and @xmath4 .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to provide more details on the reduction process , particularly about the combinatorial structure of the singularities that occur and how they are arranged at each reduction step .",
    "we will show ( although the proofs are sometimes only sketches ) that the reduction steps are well - defined if there are no bps states .",
    "it is left for later to show that the process finishes in finitely many steps .",
    "assume @xmath1 is complete and simply connected . for",
    "the present one should think of it as being the complex plane with @xmath3 a spectral covering similar to the one considered in our original example @xcite .",
    "the case of the universal covering of a compact riemann surface would pose additional problems of non - finiteness of the set of singularities , and the right notion of convergence seems less clear .",
    "the process and results will be summed up in  [ scholium ] and the reader is referred there .    in the remainder of the introduction , we review the motivation for the reduction process considered here .",
    "a building @xmath5 for the group @xmath0 is a piecewise linear cell complex that is covered by copies of the standard appartment @xmath6 , and indeed any two points of @xmath5 are contained in a common appartment .",
    "one of the main properties characterizing a building is that it is negatively curved .",
    "a _ harmonic map _",
    "@xmath7 is a continuous map such that any point @xmath8 , except for a discrete set of singularities , admits a neighborhood @xmath9 such that there is an appartment @xmath10 with @xmath11 being a harmonic map .",
    "the differential @xmath12 is naturally a triple of real @xmath13-forms @xmath14 with @xmath15 .",
    "these are well - defined up to permutation .",
    "now , these real harmonic forms are real parts of holomorphic @xmath13-forms @xmath16 and the collection @xmath17 defines the spectral curve @xmath2 .",
    "we say that @xmath18 is a @xmath3-harmonic map .    for a given spectral curve we would like to understand the @xmath3-harmonic maps to buildings .",
    "we conjectured in @xcite that , under a certain genericity hypothesis , there should be an essentially uniquely defined map @xmath19 depending only on the spectral curve @xmath20 with the following properties : ( 1 ) the pre - building @xmath21 is a negatively curved complex built out of enclosures in @xmath22 @xcite , and ( 2 ) any @xmath3-harmonic map to a building @xmath7 factors through an embedding @xmath23 isometric for the finsler and vector distances .",
    "the conjectured genericity hypothesis for existence of @xmath24 is that the spectral network associated to @xmath3 should not have any bps states @xcite .    before getting to the proposed method for constructing @xmath21 ,",
    "let us consider the implications for exponents of wkb problems .",
    "there are several different ways of getting harmonic mappings to buildings , such as gromov - schoen s theory @xcite .",
    "parreau interpreted boundary points of the character variety as actions on buildings @xcite .",
    "in @xcite we extended parreau s theory slightly for the situation of wkb problems , getting a control on the differential .",
    "suppose @xmath25 is a singular perturbation of flat connections , for @xmath26 a large parameter .",
    "there are two typical ways of getting @xmath27 , the riemann - hilbert situation @xmath28 or by solution of hitchin s equations for the higgs bundle @xmath29 . in either case",
    ", there is an associated limiting higgs bundle @xmath30 and we let @xmath3 be its spectral curve",
    ".    for @xmath31 let @xmath32 denote the transport for @xmath25 .",
    "for an ultrafilter @xmath33 on @xmath34 define the _ exponent _ @xmath35 there is a similar _ vector exponent _ @xcite that is a point in the positive weyl chamber of @xmath22 .",
    "the groupoid version of parreau s theory @xcite gives a map to a building @xmath36 such that the finsler distance ( resp .",
    "vector distance ) between @xmath37 is the exponent @xmath38 ( resp .",
    "the vector exponent ) .",
    "we showed in @xcite for the riemann - hilbert situation that @xmath39 is a @xmath3-harmonic map .",
    "mochizuki @xcite showed this for the hitchin wkb problem .",
    "if there exists a @xmath3-harmonic map @xmath24 satisfying the properties ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) above , then it follows that @xmath40 is calculated as the finsler distance between @xmath41 .",
    "in particular , it depends only on the spectral curve @xmath3 .",
    "indepenence of the choice of ultrafilter means that the ultrafilter limit used to define the exponent is actually a limit , and we obtain a calculation of the wkb exponents for our singular perturbation .",
    "turn now to the reduction process for constructing @xmath21 .",
    "a conjectural yet detailed picture of this construction was set out in @xcite and readers are referred there for a full explanation . the first step was to make an initial construction .",
    "that is essentially what we shall be calling @xmath42 below , although the initial construction for the pre - building has to include additional small parallelogram - shaped regions corresponding to the folded pieces @xmath43 that we ll meet in  [ sec - initial ] below .",
    "our @xmath42 has these trimmed off .",
    "the main problem of the initial construction is that it contains points of positive curvature , referred to as @xmath44-fold points or @xmath45 points below .",
    "these have to collapse in some way under any harmonic map to a building @xmath5 since @xmath5 is negatively curved . the construction of the pre - building consists of successively doing such a collapsing operation .    unfortunately , the direction of collapsing at a @xmath44-fold point is not well - defined , rather there are two possibilities . for that reason",
    ", the notion of _ scaffolding _ was introduced in @xcite .",
    "the initial scaffolding formalizes the existence of small neighborhoods @xmath46 that map , in an unfolded way , into appartments of the building .",
    "it follows that @xmath46 should not be folded in the map @xmath24 to @xmath21 .",
    "the edges gotten by gluing together sectors are , on the other hand , to be folded further , and this collection of data is complete : every edge is either marked as folded or unfolded ( open ) in the scaffolding .",
    "the scaffolding tells us which direction to fold at a @xmath45 point .",
    "the remaining difficulty is to propagate the information of the scaffolding into the new constructions obtained by collapsing .",
    "it was conjectured in @xcite that this should be possible , under the hypothesis of absence of bps states in the original spectral network .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to prove this conjecture on propagation of the scaffolding .",
    "we show how to make a series of reduction steps and how to propagate the scaffolding and other required information so that the series of reduction steps is well - defined .",
    "the present work does not yet result in a full construction of @xmath21 .",
    "notably missing is a convergence statement saying that the process stops in a ( locally ) finite number of steps .",
    "some parts of our arguments are also sketches rather than full proofs , and we do nt provide here a justification for the choice of initial construction ( principle [ chooseinitial ] ) .    it was observed in @xcite that each step of the reduction process towards the pre - building , could be accompanied by a trimming of the just glued - together parallelograms . if one does that , then the sequence of constructions is a sequence of @xmath47-dimensional surfaces .",
    "this point of view will be useful for the program of generalizing bridgeland - smith s work on stability conditions , discussed briefly in  [ sec - further ] at the end .",
    "also , the combinatorics of the reduction steps are all contained in this sequence of surfaces .",
    "therefore , in the present paper we shall include the trimming operation as part of our reduction steps . in order to construct the pre - building @xmath21",
    "one should put back in the pieces that were trimmed off  the procedure for doing that was explained in @xcite .",
    "start by considering spectral networks in @xmath1 .",
    "away from the branch points , the spectral curve @xmath3 consists of three holomorphic @xmath13-forms @xmath48 and setting @xmath49 these define _ foliation lines _",
    "@xmath50 where @xmath51 .",
    "assume the ramification of @xmath3 consists of simple branch points .",
    "at a branch point , two indices are interchanged , picking out one of the foliations @xmath51 whose singular leaves starting from the branch point are the initial edges of the spectral network .",
    "away from the _ caustics _ where the three foliation lines are tangent , the coordinates @xmath52 define a flat structure on @xmath1 by local identification with the standard apartment @xmath53 for buildings of the group @xmath0 .",
    "we use this flat structure when speaking of angles .",
    "we are going to add some extra singularities , so suppose given a finite subset @xmath54 and for each @xmath55 one of the three foliations @xmath56 .",
    "spectral network graph _ is a map from a trivalent graph @xmath57 , that can have endpoints as well as at most one infinite end , to @xmath1 that sends endpoints of @xmath57 to elements of @xmath58 , that sends edges to foliation lines , and that sends trivalent vertices to _ collisions _",
    "@xcite , points where foliation lines @xmath59 meet at @xmath60 angles .",
    "we require that an endpoint of the graph going to @xmath55 has adjoining edge going to a foliation line for the given foliation @xmath56 .",
    "a foliation line in @xmath1 is an _ sn - line _ if there exists a spectral network graph such that the given foliation line is in the image of an edge of the graph that is either adjacent to an endpoint , or is an infinite end .",
    "a _ bps state _",
    "@xcite is a compact spectral network graph .",
    "our main hypothesis will be that these do nt exist .",
    "we now note how to add singularities while conserving this hypothesis .",
    "the original set @xmath61 of singular points is equal to the set of ramification points of the spectral curve , assumed to be simple ramifications .",
    "the foliation line @xmath56 at a ramification point is the one determined by the two sheets of the spectral curve that come together at that point .",
    "the following proposition will allow us successively to add points to the set of singularities .",
    "[ addsn ] suppose given a set of singularities @xmath62 such that the resulting spectral network does nt have bps states .",
    "choose a point @xmath63 in general position along the interior of a caustic curve , let @xmath64 be one of the foliation lines at @xmath63 and let @xmath65 .",
    "then the spectral network associated to @xmath66 also does nt have any bps states .",
    "suppose we are given a spectral network graph @xmath67 that is a bps state for @xmath68 .",
    "consider a nearby point @xmath69 obtained by moving it a small distance @xmath70 in one direction along the caustic curve ( the caustic is generically transverse to the foliation lines otherwise it would constitute a bps state itself ) .",
    "we may assume that the bps state follows to a nearby one @xmath71 .",
    "the foliation lines are defined by differential forms @xmath72 so this gives us a way of measuring transverse distances ; in these terms it makes sense to talk about the distance between one of the foliation lines and an adjacent one for the same foliation .",
    "we should choose for each edge of the graph a sign for the form in question .",
    "now , label edges of the graph @xmath73 by integers @xmath74 such that the edge @xmath75 moves by @xmath76 .",
    "an edge @xmath77 adjoining an endpoint of the graph that goes to a previous singularity @xmath78 has to be labeled with @xmath79 , since @xmath80 does nt move with @xmath70 .",
    "there is a balancing condition on the labels at the collision points .",
    "the edges that end in @xmath81 from one direction have to be labeled by @xmath82 whereas the edges that end in @xmath81 from the other direction have to be labeled by @xmath83 .",
    "however , the balancing condition at the trivalent vertices plus the condition that all the other endpoint labels are zero , means that the number of @xmath82 labels and the number of @xmath83 labels at @xmath81 have to be equal .",
    "therefore , we can pair up edges coming in from one direction with edges going out in the other , glueing these edges together pairwise .",
    "this results in a new graph @xmath84 that is a bps state for the previous set of singularities @xmath62 .    *",
    "boundedness*let us mention a boundedness hypothesis that will be useful .",
    "suppose that there exists a compact subset @xmath85 whose boundary @xmath86 consists of foliation lines , such that the corners of @xmath86 are convex in the sense that each corner consists of foliation lines separated by two sectors inside @xmath87 . and , we suppose that all ramification points of the spectral curve , and all caustics , are contained in the interior of @xmath87 .",
    "since the additional singularities were chosen on caustics , it follows that @xmath88 .    with this hypothesis",
    ", a spectral network graph has no collisions outside of @xmath87 , and any edge that leaves @xmath87 continues as an infinite end .",
    "indeed , all caustics are contained in the interior of @xmath87 , so @xmath89 has a flat structure modeled on the standard appartment @xmath22 .",
    "suppose @xmath90 were a collision point , say the first one outside of @xmath87 .",
    "then the two incoming edges must exit from @xmath87 , but two distinct foliation lines that exit from @xmath87 and meet , must exit from the same edge because of the convexity hypothesis on the corners .",
    "if they exit from the same edge and meet , then they must meet at a @xmath91 angle , contradicting the hypothesis that they form incoming edges of a collision .",
    "thus , such a collision can not occur .    referring to the reduction steps that will be discussed later ,",
    "any regions that are to be folded together have to stay inside @xmath87 by the same kind of considerations .",
    "therefore , we may follow our compact subset along into the sequence of constructions @xmath92 that will occur ; the compact subset will contain all modifications , and @xmath89 remains untouched as a flat space contained in each of our series of constructions .",
    "although we do nt discuss the question of convergence in the present paper , the existence of a series of compact subsets that contain all the modifications means that one could envision an argument using decrease of the area to conclude termination of the reduction process . that would require bounding from below the size of the reduction steps",
    "the _ initial construction _ is a construction @xmath42 obtained by a first process of folding together certain regions in @xmath1 and trimming away the resulting pieces .",
    "we consider a collection of regions @xmath93 covering the caustics , such that @xmath94 are bounded by foliation lines meeting in two points @xmath95 symmetrical with respect to the caustic . in any @xmath96-harmonic map to a building @xmath7",
    ", @xmath97 and @xmath98 have to map to the same point , and indeed @xmath99 has to factor through a map @xmath100 where @xmath43 is @xmath94 folded in two along the caustic @xcite .",
    "here is a picture of the regions @xmath94 in @xmath1        and here is what their images look like in any harmonic map to a building :        we assume that the boundaries of the regions @xmath94 are formed by new spectral network lines gotten after adding singularities along the caustics according to proposition [ addsn ] .",
    "that will be used for the refracting property in  [ sec - refracting ] .",
    "let @xmath101 denote the quotient of @xmath1 by the equivalence relation induced by the quotients @xmath102 .",
    "now let @xmath103 be the result of trimming off the folded - together pieces , in other words it is the closure in @xmath101 of @xmath104 , or equivalently the image of @xmath105 .",
    "the space @xmath106 is a topological surface , and we have cut out the caustics .",
    "thus , @xmath103 is provided with a geometric structure locally modeled on the standard appartment @xmath22 ; the three foliation lines at any point correspond to the three standard directions in @xmath22 . in particular",
    "@xmath103 has a flat metric .",
    "the conformal structure for this flat metric is different from the original structure of riemann surface on @xmath1 .",
    "it has singular points of positive and negative curvature , namely @xmath107-fold points of negative curvature whose total angle is @xmath108 and @xmath44-fold points of positive curvature whose total angle is @xmath109 .",
    "view @xmath103 as corresponding to a construction , i.e. a presheaf on the site of enclosures as discussed in @xcite .",
    "more precisely we have a construction @xmath42 whose usual set of points is @xmath110 .",
    "it is provided with a map @xmath111 that sends foliation lines in @xmath1 to segments in @xmath42",
    ".    this construction will be the starting point of our reduction process .",
    "it is provided with a _ scaffolding _",
    "@xcite : certain edges ( the image of @xmath112 ) are designated as `` fold edges '' while all the other edge germs are designated as `` open '' or `` unfolded '' .",
    "if @xmath7 is any @xmath96-harmonic map to a building , then its restriction to @xmath113 factors through a map @xmath114 that respects the scaffolding , in the sense that fold edges are folded and open edges are unfolded .",
    "let @xmath92 be a construction .",
    "we say that @xmath92 is _ complete _ if the associated metric space is complete .",
    "it is _ normal _ if the link at any point is connected .",
    "we say that @xmath92 is _ ecarinate _ if , at any edge there are two half - planes .",
    "notice that @xmath42 satisfies these conditions , and our reduction process will conserve them , so let us consider only complete normal ecarinate and simply connected constructions @xmath92 .",
    "in particular the set of usual points @xmath115 is a complete @xmath47-manifold .",
    "if @xmath116 is a point then the link @xmath117 is a connected graph such that each vertex ( corresponding to a germ of edge at @xmath118 ) is contained in two edges ( corresponding to germs of sectors at @xmath118 ) .",
    "therefore , the link is a polygon . by the parity property",
    "the polygon has an even number of edges .",
    "we assume that the number of edges in the link at any point is @xmath44 , @xmath119 or @xmath107 .",
    "most points are _ flat _ , meaning that their links are hexagons .",
    "the other points are called @xmath44-fold , or @xmath107-fold respectively .",
    "the @xmath44-fold points are points of positive curvature , and the @xmath107-fold points are points of negative curvature .    a _ scaffolding _ consists of the following structures : ( 1 ) a marking of each edge in @xmath92 as either _ open _ ( o ) or _ folded _",
    "( f ) , such that the fold edges are those from a discrete collection @xmath120 of straight edges in @xmath92 . ( 2 ) an orientation assigned to each fold edge . ( 3 )",
    "a marking of some subset of the fold edges said to be _",
    "refracting_.    our initial construction @xmath42 contains a scaffolding in which all the edges are already marked as refracting , see  [ sec - refracting ] below , and our reduction process will preserve the refracting condition so we henceforth consider only fully refracting scaffoldings .",
    "we assume that @xmath42 and its scaffolding have the property that there exists a harmonic mapping to a building such that the fold edges are folded and the open edges are unfolded .",
    "this constrains the local type of singularities .",
    "however , the number of possibilities is still rather large .",
    "we describe here a list standard examples that will be sufficient for our reduction process ",
    "the statement that we remain within this standard list is indeed one of the main conclusions of our treatment in the present paper .",
    "the notation will consist of a boldface number saying how many sectors there are , and a subscript saying how many folded lines in the scaffolding there are .",
    "arrows in the pictures indicate the orientations of the scaffolding edges .",
    "for example , points of type @xmath121 and @xmath122 are respectively @xmath119-fold and @xmath107-fold points with no adjoining fold edges .",
    "a point of type @xmath123 is a @xmath119-fold point with a single straight fold edge ( it is nonsingular ) ; a @xmath124 point has three folded edges separated by @xmath60 , and a @xmath125 point is the same with an additional folded edge .",
    "these may be pictured as follows : @xmath126    next we picture the @xmath107-fold and @xmath44-fold points .",
    "note that the pictures can not be conformally correct for the angles ; all drawn sectors represent sectors of @xmath91 in @xmath92 .",
    "the @xmath107-fold points have at most @xmath47 fold edges ; and if there are @xmath47 of them , they are separated by either @xmath13 or @xmath44 sectors .",
    "the fold edge orientations go outward , so after the @xmath122 picture there are three possibilities : @xmath127    recall @xcite that at a @xmath44-fold point , at least two of the four edges are folded , and if an edge is folded then so is the opposite one .",
    "our standard type is when only two edges are folded , and the edge orientations are inwards towards the singularity , so it has the following picture : @xmath128    [ singdef ] we say that the singularities of the scaffolding are _ initial _ if at any point of @xmath92 the picture is either @xmath121 ( a smooth point not on the scaffolding ) , @xmath123 ( an interior point of an edge of the scaffolding ) , an @xmath107-fold point of the form @xmath129 , or a @xmath44-fold point @xmath45 .",
    "we say that the singularities of the scaffolding are _ standard _ if at any point the local picture is one of the ones we have described , namely : @xmath130 shown above .    included in the above definitions are compatibility of the orientations of the fold lines with the singularity types as drawn in the pictures .",
    "recall that edges are oriented outward at @xmath107-fold points and inward at @xmath44-fold points . for initial scaffoldings",
    "we obtain the following characterization :    [ postcaustic ] given a scaffolding with initial singularities , the collection of fold lines decomposes into a disjoint union of piecewise linear curves called the _ post - caustics _ , whose endpoints are of type @xmath131 , and along which the @xmath44-fold points alternate with @xmath107-fold points . in particular ,",
    "the number of @xmath107-fold points on a connected post - caustic is @xmath13 more than the number of @xmath44-fold points .",
    "using proposition [ addsn ] to add spectral network lines along the boundaries of the regions @xmath94 used to define the initial construction , will give that the scaffolding of the initial construction @xmath42 is a fully refracting scaffolding .",
    "the `` refracting properties '' with respect to the spectral network are : ( r1 ) at singular points of the scaffolding , all unfolded edges are initial edges of the spectral network ; and ( r2 ) when a spectral network line crosses over a fold edge , it can continue on the other side in either one of the two available directions .",
    "suppose we are given a construction @xmath92 and a fully refracting scaffolding .",
    "spectral network graph for the refracting spectral network _ is a map from a graph @xmath132 satisfying the following properties : edges of @xmath57 go to segments in @xmath92 that are straight except when they cross the fold edges ; edges do not go along fold edges of the scaffolding ; when edges cross over the fold edges they can `` refract '' , that is to say they go out of the fold edge on the other side in either one of the two directions ; trivalent vertices of the graph go to collisions at @xmath121 points i.e. points not on fold edges of the scaffolding ; and endpoints of the graph go to singular points of the scaffolding or @xmath122 points of @xmath92 , with the adjoining edges going outward in any non - fold directions .    before choosing the regions",
    "@xmath93 that will be folded and trimmed to get @xmath103 , add points to the set of singularities of our spectral network , using proposition [ addsn ] .",
    "add these points along the caustic curves at the places where the boundaries of the @xmath94 meet the caustics , so that the boundary curves of the @xmath94 become spectral network curves .",
    "notice furthermore that at the corners @xmath95 , all three directions outward to the rest of @xmath1 are spectral network lines , two from continuing the boundary curves and the third by collision of the two boundary curves .",
    "our above somewhat heuristic discussion leads to the following principle .",
    "[ nobps ] if the original spectral network of @xmath1 had no bps states , then the refracting spectral network of @xmath42 has no bps states .",
    "we also need to know something about the arrangement of singularities of the scaffolding for @xmath42 .",
    "we state this as another principle :    [ chooseinitial ] the initial construction @xmath42 may be chosen to have only initial singularities ( definition [ singdef ] ) .",
    "the fold edges of the scaffolding are thus arranged into post - caustics as described in remark [ postcaustic ] .",
    "we do nt give here a formal justification for the possibility of choosing the initial construction in this way , but note that it is what happens in the pictures we have considered .",
    "for example , see @xcite for a picture leading to an @xmath133 point .",
    "this section begins the discussion of a step in the reduction process .",
    "the first question is to show the existence of a @xmath45 point about which some collapsing can be done .    [ prop - noloops ] suppose given a construction with a refracting scaffolding , such that there are no bps states in the resulting spectral network .",
    "suppose that the fold edges of the scaffolding are oriented and the singularities are all from our standard list .",
    "make a directed graph using the singularities as vertices , except that we separate a @xmath125 singularity into two vertices .",
    "the edges of the graph are the fold edges with their orientations ; at a @xmath125 point the `` spine '' ( consisting of the two fold edges that are opposite ) goes to one of the vertices and the other two edges go to the other one .",
    "this directed graph has no directed loops .    _",
    "( sketch)_consider a path parallel to a directed loop , just to one side of it .",
    "this will satisfy the collision and refracting conditions , so taken together with the appropriate initial sn lines coming from singularities , it constitutes a bps state .",

    ", our hypothesis that there are no bps states implies that there are no directed loops .",
    "therefore , the orientations of edges make the graph into a poset ; since it is finite it has a minimal vertex .",
    "the only type of point on the scaffolding that has all fold edges pointed inward is a @xmath45 point , therefore there exists a @xmath45 point .",
    "@xmath134    we now consider an extended collapsing operation at a @xmath45 point @xmath135 . for this , consider two pieces @xmath136 and @xmath137 that match up , and share a common vertex @xmath135 and common edges @xmath138 and @xmath139 .",
