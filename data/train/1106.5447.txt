    "the first of eq .   generates a displacement of the environmental oscillators , conditioned on the state of the corresponding tls .",
    "our approach to the description of the dynamics is to solve the problems embodied by each the subsystem made out of a single tls and the ensemble of local modes it interacts with .",
    "we thus consider @xmath21 and look for eigenstates of the form @xmath22 with @xmath23 and @xmath24 denoting the eigenbasis of @xmath25 .",

    "a treatment with an arbitrary number of modes per site , performed along the lines of the discussion above , is certainly possible although computationally demanding .",

    "such three paradigmatic cases allow us to well identify the effect of the entanglement among the environments on the dynamics of the tls s .",

    "we will also consider an @xmath0-mode a pure squeezed - vacuum state for the harmonic oscillators @xmath81 with @xmath82 and @xmath83 the squeezing parameter .",
    "this state can be expressed in the chosen oscillator basis following the very same lines highlighted above and using again the charlier polynomials .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that these two environmental states are locally indistinguishable as a squeezed vacuum is locally equivalent to a thermal state .",
    "we are now in a position to start addressing the effective dynamics of the tls chain under the influences of the various instances of environment introduced in the previous section . in order to strip down our discussion from unnecessary complications , we study here the smallest configuration of the model at hand , i.e. a two - tls chain ( a _ dimer _ ) affected by two individual harmonic oscillators , one per site . the two tls will be considered as identical .",
    "while embodying an interesting enough situation  @xcite , this case allows for an agile description of the physics involved .    in the dimer basis , the interaction hamiltonian in eq .",

    "the anti - diagonal form of @xmath90 helps considerably in working out a manageable expression or the time - evolution operator .",

    "this ensures that the reduced single - oscillator state obtained from the squeezed - vacuum environment is a thermal state having the same temperature as the one considered in the genuinely thermal instance . in this way",
    ", we can nicely isolate the effect of the entanglement shared by the environmental oscillators .    clearly , the revival of coherences at @xmath102 is only due to the presence of correlations in the environment and an indication of a significant deviation of the state properties in such two different environmental preparations .",

    "quite reasonably , at values of @xmath105 that are comparable with the tls - oscillator coupling , the differences between the thermal and squeezed - vacuum cases becomes very small .",
    "we can understand this by considering that , for decreasing values of @xmath105 , the non - local interaction between the sites of the chain becomes less relevant than the local tls - oscillator coupling .",
    "this implies that each tls is strongly tied to its associated mode so that the local features of the oscillator environment become more preponderant than the non - local ones and the differences with a configuration of independent environmental states fades away . on the contrary",

    "<S> we put forward a framework to study the dynamics of a chain of interacting quantum particles affected by individual or collective multi - mode environment , focussing on the role played by the environmental quantum correlations over the evolution of the chain . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of entanglement in the state of the environmental system magnifies the non - markovian nature of the chain s dynamics , giving rise to structures in figures of merit such as entanglement and purity that are not observed under a separable multi - mode environment . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis can be relevant to problems tackling the open - system dynamics of biological complexes of strong current interest .    </S>",
    "<S> the investigation on the interaction between a spin - like two - level system ( tls ) and an environment embodied by an ensemble of harmonic oscillators , the so - called spin - boson model  @xcite , has gained renewed momentum due to the current strong interest in the quantum - mechanical description of excitation - transfer processes in biological organisms or the dynamics of protein - solvent systems in photosynthetic complexes  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the interest in such a celebrated model is twofold , in this context . </S>",
    "<S> on one side , it is employed to understand the active role of an environment in assisting transport across such structures  @xcite . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the model is extremely useful to characterize the extent to which non - classical behaviors survive in systems affected by environmental worlds that are strictly adherent to the paradigm of being _ wet and warm_. in this respect , we aim at gathering a description of the tls - environment evolution that is as complete as possible and able to account for subtle yet potentially key features of such dynamics emerging from the finiteness the environment itself , its capability to retain information on the system it is coupled to ( and kick it back at later times ) and its inherent structure . for , instance , </S>",

    "<S> @xcite that environmental memory - keeping effects are crucial for preserving the coherent behavior of excitonic energy transfer processes in biological complexes .    stepping aside from interesting yet still controversial bio - physical scenarios , the general model addressed above plays an important role in various contexts of applied quantum physics , from cavity quantum electrodynamics to its solid - state analogues involving defects in diamond coupled to semiconducting microcavities  @xcite or superconducting devices and planar strip - line resonators  @xcite . in the latter case , very interesting regimes are quickly becoming available where the coupling strength of the coherent part of an evolution can be made comparable to the one responsible for the open - system dynamics due to the presence of the environment @xcite .    all such considerations and physical configurations </S>",
    "<S> demand the development of a framework apt to encompass and harness features of non - markovianity in various coupling regimes . </S>",
    "<S> formally , one is required to retain , to some extent , the degrees of freedom of the environment so as to allow for its possibly - non - trivial structure to influence the dynamics of the system of interest . </S>",
    "<S> this can be computationally very demanding and while sophisticated techniques have been put forward to determine the quantum statistical properties of interacting quantum many - body systems , they are either hardly suitable for non - linear configurations or face some difficulties in tracking the temporal dynamics of the system itself .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we contribute to the investigation on the interaction between a system of interacting tls s coupled to a bosonic environment by studying the effect that environmental entanglement has on the dynamics of a chain of interacting tls s . </S>",
    "<S> we build up a mathematical apparatus that , inspired by and significantly extending the approach in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , solves exactly the _ local _ interaction between a single tls and its multi - mode environment , so as to build an eigenbasis that is then used in order to tackle the inter - particle coupling by keeping track of the environmental properties . </S>",
    "<S> this helps us in incorporating the full quantum features of the environmental state , therefore enabling a quantitative study of the role of entanglement in the evolution of the chain under investigation and its relation to the non - markovian nature of the dynamics . we illustrate our techniques by addressing the cases of a dimer and a trimer , which are the smallest non - trivial configurations allowing us to study the most crucial attributes of such a complex problem . </S>",
    "<S> our investigation opens up the possibility to study full - scale networks of coupled tls s in an open - system fashion , covering the full range of coupling strengths with the environments , from the weak to the strong one . </S>",

    "<S> [ modelmethod ] we describe the method put forward in order to analyze the dynamics of an @xmath0-site chain interacting with individual multi - mode bosonic environments without resorting to the weak - coupling regime and thus allowing for a more complete overview of the effects of non - markovianity on the evolution of the chain . sec .  </S>",
    "<S> [ diff ] is devoted to the explicit study on a dimer of interacting particles affected by entangled environments . </S>",
    "<S> the key features in the dynamics of such configuration are compared to what is achieved under the assumption of independent environments so as to show that entanglement appear to enhance the non - markovian aspects of the time evolution . </S>",

    "<S> [ comm ] addresses the case of a common environment affecting the sites of our dimer , showing that the manifestations mentioned above are insensitive to the non - local nature of the environment , but rather depend on the properties of its state such as the entanglement - sharing structure , as studied in sec .  </S>",
