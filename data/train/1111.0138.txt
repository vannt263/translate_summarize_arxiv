    "bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) is the transition process , in which a macroscopic fraction of bosons goes into the lowest energy state , as the temperature is lowered below a certain critical temperature @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "it was predicted by einstein in 1925 , based on bose s explanation of black body radiation",
    ". a great deal of activity , both theoretical and experimental , has been seen in this field , since the experimental realization of bec in 1995 .",
    "although a number of static , dynamic and thermodynamic properties have been studied  @xcite , not much attention has been paid to the heat capacity of attractive condensates .",
    "the main motivation of this work is to fill this gap .",
    "+ in laboratory experiments , the condensate is trapped by a confining potential , usually a harmonic oscillator potential . an attractive condensate ( _ e.g. _ @xmath3li condensate ) has a negative value of the @xmath4-wave scattering length @xmath5 and collapses , when the number of particles @xmath0 in the condensate exceeds a critical number @xmath1 . on the other hand a repulsive condensate ( _ e.g. _ @xmath6rb condensate ) corresponds to @xmath7 and is stable for any @xmath0 , since repulsively",
    "interacting bosons are contained in the externally applied trap .",
    "the situation is quite different for an attractive condensate : attractive bosons tend to come to the center of the trap , which is balanced only by the kinetic pressure , resulting in a metastable condensate .",
    "the total attraction increases as the number of pairs @xmath8 , while the kinetic pressure increases as @xmath0 .",
    "thus for @xmath0 larger than a critical value @xmath1 , the net attraction dominates and a collapse occurs .",
    "+ in this communication , we report the calculation of heat capacity of an attractive condensate containing a fixed number of @xmath3li atoms , interacting via the realistic van der waals potential , appropriate for the experimental scattering length .",
    "the features are markedly different from those of repulsive condensates , only which have so far been investigated . in a repulsive condensate , the heat capacity @xmath9 for a fixed number @xmath0 of bosons in the trap , as also the critical temperature @xmath2 , smoothly approach a constant value as @xmath10  @xcite . as a function of @xmath11 , the heat capacity for a given @xmath0 increases to a maximum @xmath12",
    ", then falls rapidly to a saturation value @xmath13 as @xmath11 increases ( @xmath14 is the boltzmann constant ) .",
    "these features are qualitatively similar to those of a trapped non - interacting condensate  @xcite .",
    "however for an attractive condensate , there are important changes in the nature .",
    "this is due to the fact that the number of available energy levels of the system is limited , especially when @xmath15 , while for any @xmath0 , there are infinitely many energy levels for the repulsive or non - interacting condensate . in the limit of high @xmath11 , both the repulsive and the non - interacting condensate",
    "behave as the corresponding trapped bose - gas , resulting in a saturation in @xmath9 . on the other hand",
    ", an attractive condensate also shows similar behavior , only if it is allowed to absorb energy internally through rotational motion involving large orbital angular momenta .",
    "+ we provide an understanding of this peculiar nature based on the many - body picture . for the theoretical calculation , we adopt the correlated potential harmonic ( cph ) method  @xcite to solve the many - body problem approximately .",
    "this technique is based on the potential harmonics ( ph ) expansion method  @xcite .",
    "the laboratory bec must be very dilute to preclude three - body collisions , which lead to molecule formation and consequent depletion .",
    "hence only two - body correlations are relevant .",
    "the ph is a subset  @xcite of the full hyperspherical harmonics ( hh ) basis  @xcite , that involves only two - body correlations .",
    "hence the ph basis is a good approximation for expanding the condensate wave function .",
    "it reduces the bulk of the numerical procedure immensely , while retaining the most important basic features of the condensate . however , the leading members of the ph basis do not have the correct short separation behavior of the interacting faddeev component .",
    "this causes a very slow rate of convergence of the ph expansion basis . to correct for this",
    ", we include a short - range correlation function in the expansion basis .",
    "this correlation function is obtained as the zero - energy solution of the two - body schrdinger equation  @xcite .",
    "it is a correct representation of the short separation behavior and also incorporates the @xmath4-wave scattering length , @xmath5 , through its asymptotic behavior  @xcite .",
    "the technique has been shown to reproduce known results , both experimental and theoretical  @xcite .",
    "these include the following : ground state properties ( energy , wave function , condensate size , one - body density , pair - correlation , etc . ) as also multipolar moments of both repulsive and attractive condensates , correct prediction of the critical number and collapse scenario of attractive condensates , thermodynamic properties of repulsive condensates , properties of condensates in finite traps , etc .",
    "+ we can understand the behavior of heat capacity of attractive condensates in terms of the energy levels of the system produced by the cph method .",
    "this method generates an effective potential in which the condensate moves . for an attractive condensate",
    ", the effective potential has a metastable region ( msr ) , separated from a deep well on the inner side by an intermediate finite barrier .",
    "a finite number of energy levels are supported by the msr .",
    "as the number @xmath0 of atoms increases , the msr shrinks and the number of energy levels reduce drastically . as temperature increases ,",
    "particles are distributed in higher energy levels , according to bose distribution formula .",
    "thus at low temperatures the internal energy and @xmath9 increase with temperature . at higher temperatures ,",
    "the bosons have fewer levels to occupy , causing @xmath9 to differ from the repulsive case .",
    "there is also a dominant effect of the drastically reducing number of energy levels as @xmath15 .",
    "+ the paper is organized as follows .",
    "for easy readability and to introduce our notations , we briefly review the correlated potential harmonic method in section  ii . section  iii provides our numerical procedure .",

    "the energy of the relative motion is @xmath24 .",
    "next , we introduce hyperspherical variables corresponding to the set of @xmath25 jacobi vectors . first , a hyperradius is defined as @xmath26^{\\frac{1}{2}}.\\ ] ] the remaining set of @xmath27 ` hyperangles ' consists of @xmath28 polar angles of @xmath25 jacobi vectors and @xmath29 angles defining their relative lengths  @xcite . in the hyperspherical harmonics expansion method ( hhem )",
    "@xmath30 is expanded in the complete set of hyperspherical harmonics ( hh ) , which are the eigenfunctions of the grand orbital operator [ hyperangular part of the @xmath31 dimensional laplace operator , given by the sum in the first term of eq .",
    "( [ se_rel_motion ] ) ]  @xcite .",
    "substitution of this in eq .",
    "( [ se_rel_motion ] ) and projection on a particular hh result in a set of coupled differential equations .",
    "imposition of symmetry of the wave function and calculation of the matrix elements become increasingly difficult and tedious as @xmath0 increases . in addition , the degeneracy of the hh basis increases very rapidly  @xcite with the increase in the grand orbital quantum number @xmath32 .",
    "hence a convergent calculation using hhem with _ the full _ hh basis is extremely computer intensive and unmanageable for @xmath33 .",
    "this is the price one pays for keeping _ all many - body correlations _ in @xmath30 .",
    "+ however all these complications can be avoided and a much simpler computational procedure can be formulated for the laboratory bec , which is designed to be _ extremely dilute _ ( typical number density is @xmath34 @xmath35 ) in order to avoid recombination through three - body collisions .",
    "thus three - body correlations and three - body forces are totally negligible .",
    "we can then express @xmath30 as a sum of two - body faddeev component @xmath36 for the @xmath37-interacting pair  @xcite @xmath38 note that the assuption of two - body correlations only makes @xmath36 a function of the pair separation vector and the hyperradius only .",
    "one can then expand @xmath36 in a subset of hh , called the potential harmonics ( ph ) subset , which is sufficient for the expansion of the interaction potential @xmath39 as a function in the hyperangular space for the @xmath37-partition .",
    "since the labeling of the particles is arbitrary , we can choose @xmath40 .",
    "then the corresponding ph , @xmath41 ( the argument is the full set of hyperangles for the @xmath37-partition ) is independent of @xmath42 and a simple analytic expression is possible  @xcite .",
    "expansion of the faddeev component in the ph basis reads @xmath43 where @xmath41 is a potential harmonic  @xcite .",

    "as @xmath11 is gradually raised , the system absorbs energy by occupying higher available energy levels upto the top of the msr .",
    "however , there is a finite life time of atoms in higher energy levels due to tunneling through the ib into the dnw . thus there will be a decrease in the number of atoms in the msr .",
    "the rate of loss of atoms will increase with the energy of the level , as also with @xmath0 ( increase of @xmath0 will lower the ib ) . the usual definition of heat capacity , @xmath9 , is the rate of change of internal energy with respect to @xmath11 [ eq .",
    "( [ spheat ] ) ] , _ for a fixed number @xmath0 of atoms in the condensate_. this definition is unambiguous for a repulsive or non - interacting condensate , since in these cases there is no loss . however",
    ", since the loss is appreciable for an attractive condensate for @xmath0 close to @xmath1 , or if @xmath11 is such that @xmath129 is comparable with the highest excitation energy allowed by the ib , this definition demands that atoms be pumped into the condensate at the same rate as the loss rate from the condensate .",
    "such an experimental procedure has not been adopted yet . however , for @xmath126 and @xmath138 , the highest appreciably occupied levels will have negligible tunneling probability into the dnw . under these conditions ,",
    "the metastable attractive condensate is fairly long lived and the standard definition of @xmath9 is acceptable . hence standard experimental techniques can be adopted .",
    "thus our results presented in figs .",
    "4  6 are experimentally verifiable in the small @xmath0 , small @xmath11 limit .",
    "we have presented , for theoretical completeness , results for @xmath0 close to @xmath1 and for @xmath11 beyond @xmath2 .",
    "the question of how the system can absorb energy internally for such values of @xmath0 and @xmath11 was already discussed above .",
    "in this work , we report a detailed calculation of the heat capacity @xmath9 of an attractive bose - einstein condensate containing @xmath0 atoms of @xmath3li . the correlated potential harmonics method , which is appropriate for the dilute bec , has been used .",
    "the effective potential , in general , supports a large number of energy levels . at @xmath139 ,",
    "the lowest energy level accommodates all the bosons . as temperature increases ,",
    "particles are distributed in higher energy levels , according to bose distribution formula .",
    "thus the internal energy of the system increases .",
    "heat capacity @xmath140 for a fixed number @xmath0 of particles in the condensate is defined as the temperature derivative of the total internal energy . for a repulsive condensate trapped by an ideal harmonic oscillator",
    ", the effective potential has no upper cut off .",
    "hence the energy levels are not limited in energy .",
    "consequently , total internal energy and @xmath140 increase as temperature increases upto @xmath2 . for @xmath141 ,",
    "the ground state occupation becomes suddenly microscopic ( negligible ) and the system behaves like a harmonically trapped bose gas .",
    "hence @xmath140 decreases rapidly above @xmath2 , reaching its asymptotic value @xmath13 .",
    "thus @xmath140 first increases , reaches a maximum value @xmath12 and then decreases rapidly to its asymptotic value , as @xmath11 increases from zero .",
    "+ for @xmath142 bosons with mutual attraction , a metastable condensate is formed in the metastable region ( msr ) of the effective potential .",
    "on the left of the msr , an intermediate barrier ( ib ) , followed by a deep narrow well and finally a strongly repulsive core appear , as one approaches the center of the condensate . for @xmath126 ,",
    "the ib is very high and the minimum of the msr is very low , so that the metastable well is sufficiently deep compared with thermal excitation energy @xmath143 at @xmath2 , and a large number of energy levels are supported .",
    "hence for @xmath144 , even the most thermally excited particles do not feel the effect of the ib and @xmath140 increases gradually , as in the repulsive case .",
    "+ with increase of temperature , the system with a fixed @xmath0 absorbs energy internally by increasing the occupation probability of higher energy levels supported by the metastable region of the effective potential .",
    "atoms in energy levels close to the top of the intermediate barrier have appreciable probability to tunnel into the deep narrow well , causing the condensate to loose atoms .",
    "but such levels are not occupied with any appreciable probability if @xmath126 and @xmath138 .",
    "hence such a condensate is quasi - stable and @xmath9 calculated for a fixed @xmath0 is appropriate .",
    "when the rate of atom loss from the condensate is appreciable , standard definition of heat capacity at constant @xmath0 requires feeding the attractive condensate with additional atoms at a rate such as to compensate for the loss rate .",
    "although this is not the usual experimental technique , we investigate such cases for a complete theoretical study .",
    "in such a situation , there are drastic changes .",
    "the peak value of @xmath9 ( the temperature at which this occurs is the transition temperature @xmath2 ) initially increases gradually with @xmath0 , then after reaching a maximum , decreases fairly rapidly near @xmath1 . on the other hand , for small @xmath0",
    ", @xmath2 increases almost linearly up to @xmath145 . for larger @xmath0",
    ", the transition temperature increases rapidly with @xmath0 .",
    "we provide an explanation of this behavior , based on the microscopic mechanism of absorption of internal energy , as @xmath11 increases . as @xmath0 increases towards @xmath1 , the depth and width of the metastable well decrease rapidly . as a result , the number of energy levels supported by the metastable well decreases rapidly .",
    "this tends to increase @xmath2 , since fewer energy levels are available for absorption of internal energy , and bosons are forced to be in lower energy levels as @xmath11 increases .",
    "rapid reduction of available energy levels as @xmath15 , causes quicker saturation of internal energy of the condensate .",
    "consequently , the maximum of @xmath9 decreases rapidly as @xmath15 .",
