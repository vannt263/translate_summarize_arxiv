    "the ridges appear to be the front side of a continuous windings of collimated structures around the general biconical outflow of the lobes ( see text ) .",
    "the galactic centre spur is nearly vertical at low latitude , possibly explained by a projection effect if it is mostly at the front of the northern lobe . at its higher latitudes ,",
    "the galactic centre spur becomes roughly parallel with the northern ridge ( above ) which itself exhibits little curvature ; this is consistent with the overall outflow s becoming cylindrical above 4 - 5 kpc as previously suggested@xcite .",
    "in such a geometry , synchrotron emission from the rear side of each cone is attenuated by a factor @xmath35 with respect to the front - side , rendering it difficult to detect the former against the foreground of the latter and of the galactic plane ( see supplementary information ) .",

    "the flux densities and polarization fraction quoted in the text we can infer equipartition@xcite magnetic field intensities of @xmath36 g ( 1 @xmath2 g @xmath37 t ) if the synchrotron - emitting electrons occupy the entire volume of the lobes , or @xmath38 g if they occupy only a 300  pc thick skin ( the width of the ridges ) . for the southern ridge , @xmath39 g ; for the galactic centre spur @xmath40 g ; and , for the northern ridge , @xmath41 g .",
    "note the large area of depolarization and small angular scale signal modulation visible across the galactic plane extending up to @xmath42 on either side of the galactic centre ( thin dashed line ) .",
    "this depolarization is due to faraday rotation by a number of shells that match h@xmath28 emission regions@xcite , most of them lying in the sagittarius arm at distances from the sun up to 2.5  kpc , and some in the scutum - centaurus arm at @xmath123.5  kpc .",
    "the small scale modulation is associated to weaker h@xmath28 emission encompassing the same hii regions and most likely associated with the same spiral arms .",
    "thus 2.5  kpc constitutes a lower limit to the lobes near side distance and places the far side beyond 5.5  kpc from the sun ( cf . ref .",

    "electrons are taken to be transported with a speed given by the sum of the inferred vertical wind speed ( 1100 km / s ) and the vertical component of the alfven velocity in the magnetic field .",
    "the former is inferred from the geometry of the northern ridge : if its footpoint has executed roughly half an orbit in the time the galactic centre spur has ascended to its total height of @xmath48 kpc , its upward velocity must be close to 1,000  km / s@xmath49[@xcite ] , where we have normalised to a footpoint rotation speed of 80 km / s at a radius of 100 pc from the galactic centre@xcite ( detailed analysis gives 1100 km / s : see the supplementary information ) . in a strong , regular magnetic field ,",

    "<S> such coincident , non - thermal radio , microwave and @xmath0-ray emission indicates the presence of a non - thermal electron population covering at least the energy range 1 - 100  gev ( figure [ fig_4 ] ) that is simultaneously synchrotron radiating at radio and microwave frequencies and up - scattering ambient radiation into @xmath0-rays by the inverse compton process . </S>",

    "<S> an important question about the fermi bubbles is whether they are ultimately powered by star - formation or by activity of the galaxy s central , super - massive black hole . </S>",
    "<S> despite their very large extent , the @xmath0-ray bubbles and the x - shaped polarized microwave and x - ray structures tracing their limb - brightened base@xcite have a narrow waist of only 100 - 200 pc diameter at the galactic centre . </S>",
    "<S> this matches the extent of the star - forming molecular gas ring ( @xmath18 ) recently demonstrated to occupy the region@xcite . with 5 - 10% of the galaxy s molecular gas content@xcite , </S>",
    "<S> star - formation activity in this ` central molecular zone ' is intense , accelerating a distinct cosmic ray population@xcite and driving an outflow@xcite of hot , thermal plasma , cosmic rays , and ` frozen - in ' magnetic field lines@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one consequence of the region s outflow is that the cosmic ray electrons accelerated there ( dominantly energised by supernovae ) are advected away before they lose much energy radiatively in situ@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is revealed by the fact that the radio continuum flux on scales up to 800 pc around the galactic centre is in anomalous deficit with respect to the expectation afforded by the empirical far - infrared - radio continuum correlation@xcite . the total 2.3  ghz radio continuum flux from the lobes of @xmath12 21  kjy , however , saturates this correlation normalising to the inner @xmath19 pc diameter region s 60 @xmath2 m flux of 2 mjy[@xcite ] . </S>",
    "<S> together with the morphological evidence , this strongly indicates the lobes are illuminated by cosmic ray electrons accelerated in association with star - formation within this region ( see the supplementary information ) not as a result of black hole activity .    </S>",
    "<S> the ridges appear to be continuous windings of individual , collimated structures around a general biconical outflow out of the galactic centre . </S>",
    "<S> the sense of galactic rotation ( clockwise as seen from galactic north ) and angular - momentum conservation mean that the ridges get ` wound - up'@xcite in the outflow with increasing distance from the plane explaining the projected curvature of the visible , front - side of the ridges towards galactic west . </S>",
    "<S> polarized , rear - side emission is attenuated rendering it difficult to detect against the lobes front - side and the galactic plane s stronger emission ( figure  [ fig_1 ] and the supplementary information ) .    for cosmic ray electrons synchrotron - emitting at 2.3  ghz to be able to ascend to the top of the northern ridge at @xmath12 7  kpc in the time it takes them to cool ( mostly via synchrotron emission itself ) requires vertical transport speeds of @xmath20500 km / s ( for 15 @xmath2 g ; see figure  [ fig_4 ] ) . given the geometry of the gc spur , the outflowing plasma is moving at @xmath21 km / s ( figure  [ fig_4 ] and the supplementary information ) , somewhat faster than the @xmath22 km / s gravitational escape velocity from the galactic centre region@xcite , implying that 2.3-ghz - radiating electrons can , indeed , be advected to the top of the ridges in their loss time .    </S>",
    "<S> given the calculated fields and the speed of the outflow , the total magnetic energy for each of the ridges , @xmath23 erg ( see the supplementary information ) , is injected at a rate @xmath24 erg / s over a few @xmath25 years ; this is very close to the rate at which independent modelling@xcite suggests galactic centre star formation is injecting magnetic energy into the region s outflow . </S>",
    "<S> on the basis of the ridges individual energetics , geometry , outflow velocity , timescales , and plasma content ( see supplementary information ) , we suggest that their footpoints are energised by and rotate with the super - stellar clusters inhabiting@xcite the inner @xmath12100 pc ( in radius ) of the galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , we suggest that the ridges constitute ` phonographic ' recordings of the last @xmath1210  myr of galactic centre star - formation . given its morphology , the galactic centre spur likely still has an active footprint . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the northern and southern ridges seem not to connect to the plane at 2.3 ghz . </S>",
    "<S> this may indicate their footpoints are no longer active though the southern ridge may be connected to the plane by a gamma - ray counterpart ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ lobes : fig ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , present data do not allow us to trace the galactic centre spur all the way down to the plane but a connection between this structure and one ( or some combination ) of the @xmath26-scale radio continuum spurs@xcite emanating north of the star - forming giant molecular cloud complexes sagittarius b and c or the bright , non - thermal ` radio arc'@xcite ( itself longitudinally coincident with the @xmath124 myr quintuplet@xcite stellar cluster ) , seems plausible .    </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic energy content of both lobes is much larger than the ridges , @xmath27 erg . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests the magnetic fields of the lobes are the result of the accumulation of a number of star formation episodes . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , if the lobes field structure were formed over the same timescale as the ridges , it would have to be associated with recent activity of the super - massive black hole , perhaps occurring in concert with enhanced nuclear star - formation activity@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> our data indicate the process of gas accretion on to the galactic nucleus inescapably involves star - formation which , in turn , energises an outflow . </S>",
    "<S> this carries away low angular momentum gas , cosmic rays and magnetic field lines and has a number of important consequences : i ) the dynamo activity in the galactic centre@xcite , likely required to generate its strong@xcite in situ field , requires the continual expulsion of small - scale helical fields to prevent dynamo saturation@xcite ; the presence of the ridges high in the halo may attest to this process . </S>",
    "<S> ii ) the lobes and ridges reveal how the very active star formation in the galactic centre generates and sustains a strong , large - scale magnetic field structure in the galactic halo . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of this on the propagation of high - energy cosmic rays in the galactic halo should be considered . </S>",
    "<S> iii ) the process of gas expulsion in the outflow may explain how the milky way s super - massive black hole is kept relatively quiescent@xcite despite sustained , inward movement of gas </S>",
