    "tracer spreading in flows between parallel walls has received considerable attention since the celebrated work of taylor@xcite .",
    "this problem is of fundamental importance in a variety of fields , and in particular transport processes through artificial or natural porous media . in general",
    ", the dispersion of a tracer carried along by a flowing fluid in a medium of disordered structure , such as hydrocarbon or water reservoirs , involves a combination of convection - dispersion through the microscopic pore space of the rock itself and through macroscopic channels such as fractures . in the simplest case of poiseuille flow in a hele - shaw cell , which in several applications is used to model fractures @xcite , the vanishing velocity near the solid gives rise to a large dispersion , quadratic in the pclet number @xcite .",
    "however , one frequently encounters systems in which the channel aperture varies along the flow direction , or in which the channel walls have some rugosity .",
    "this is the case for fractured rocks , in which fractured boundaries can be usually described as correlated , self - affine fractals@xcite .",
    "the roughness exponent , is usually found to be close to @xmath1 , insensitive to the material and fracturing process @xcite .",
    "most of the studies dealing with varying channel aperture model the fluctuations as slowly varying periodic functions @xcite .",
    "only a few works deal with more realistic models of fractures , such as random rugosities perpendicular to the flow @xcite or self - affine fractures @xcite .    in the present paper we present numerical simulations of tracer diffusion and dispersion in self - affine fractures .",
    "the simulations are two - dimensional , ( two - dimensional fracture surfaces ) , and the fluid flow and tracer spreading are computed using the lattice - boltzmann ( lb ) method .",
    "we will first discuss , in section [ lb ] , the implementation of the lb method to simulate diffusive transport .",
    "we shall propose a new boundary condition which improves the accuracy and validity of the method , particularly when describing narrow fractures . in section [ comparison ]",
    "we will compare the proposed boundary condition with previous ones , in two different cases .",
    "diffusion ( section [ diffusion2d ] ) and taylor dispersion ( section [ taylor2d ] ) in a two - dimensional straight channel .",
    "after reviewing some basic facts about self - affine surfaces ( section [ self - affine ] ) , we investigate , in section [ diffusion ] , how the complex geometry of fracture surfaces affects the diffusive transport ( zero mean flow velocity ) .",
    "we also study the dependence of diffusivity on the size of the gap between complementary fracture surfaces",
    ". we will show that it is possible to derive an analytic expression , which accounts for the geometric effects on the diffusivity , in the limiting case where the roughness associated with the fracture surface is small compared to the mean aperture .",
    "in section [ sec_dispersion ] we study dispersive transport in two different situations .",
    "first , when the two surfaces are simply displaced normally to the mean fracture plane . in this case , we will show that a description in terms of a parameter @xmath0 , related to _ dynamically connected _ pore space , accounts for a large part of the enhancement due to the presence of low - velocity zones in the fracture channel .",
    "secondly , we show that when there is a lateral shift as well as the normal displacement , an increase in dispersion is obtained . finally , we present a novel result , showing that dispersion is diminished in the presence of convection at low pclet numbers .",
    "this effect is found when the surfaces are shifted and the convective transport is weak enough .",
    "our goal is to study various aspects of transport in fractures which are sensitive to the fracture roughness . since we consider convection and dispersion in a highly irregular geometry , the lattice - boltzmann method @xcite is particularly convenient . in this algorithm",
    ", fictitious particles move between neighboring sites on a lattice , with suitable collision rules , and the boundary of the flow domain is simply a surface of sites where boundary condition rules should be imposed .",
    "we use a version of the lb model first proposed by qian _ et .",
    "al _ @xcite , with a cubic lattice in 3 dimensions and 19 velocities ( d3q19 in the terminology of @xcite ) .",
    "the collision operator is approximated by a single relaxation parameter @xmath2 , the bhatnagar - gross - krook model@xcite , and the local equilibrium distribution given in @xcite is used .",
    "this pseudo - equilibrium distribution locally preserves mass and momentum values , and is formulated specifically to recover the navier - stokes equation at large length and time scales . as usual , we define the lattice spacing as the unit of length , and the time step in the simulations as the unit time . in what follows , quantities will be measured in terms of the lattice - spacing and simulation time - step .",
    "note that , since we are concerned with incompressible flows , we do not need to introduce a dimension of mass .",
    "the model used for miscible fluids is a straightforward extension of the model restricted to describe simple fluids . following the convention of rothman and zaleski @xcite",
    ", we will distinguish between particle types by assuming that the particles are colored . the pseudo - equilibrium color distribution given in @xcite",
    "is used , and a single but new relaxation parameter @xmath3 ( bgk approximation ) is used in the equation that describes the advection and diffusion of color .",
    "in addition to mass and momentum , color is also a conserved quantity .",
    "the basic variables of the model are the distribution functions @xmath4 , corresponding to the mean occupation number of particles in the direction @xmath5 at a given node , and @xmath6 , describing the relative amount of color @xcite .",
    "since the evolution of the total population is independent of the color of the particles , the hydrodynamic equations for mass and momentum may be obtained as in the simple fluids case . in other words ,",
    "the time evolution of the @xmath4 s is independent of the @xmath6 s .",
    "these evolution equations are then coupled to the evolution of color , through the local fluid velocity .",
    "thus , the diffusive behavior of the fluids is superimposed on the underlying navier - stokes dynamics .",
    "the fact that that the information on mass density and flow is decoupled from the information on color , opens the possibility of imposing different boundary conditions ( bc ) on the populations describing fluid flow ( @xmath4 ) and those describing advective - diffusive transport ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "specifically , for the non - slip bc on the solid surface , we shall use the simplest implementation of particle exclusion - the bounce - back rule ( bb ) , where the particles incident on the boundary are propagated back into the directions from which they came . on the other hand , for color concentration a different macroscopic bc is desired , _",
    "i. e. _ zero color - gradient normal to the solid surface .",
    "as mentioned , we will study tracer dispersion in narrow gaps between self - affine solid surfaces .",
    "thus , in this situation , the bc imposed at the solid surfaces becomes a crucial aspect of the simulation method .    in previous works concerning lattice bgk models for miscible fluids",
    ", bc imposed on color concentration at solid boundary were not distinguished from those used to simulate fluid flow . in these situations ,",
    "the relevance of the bc at solid surfaces varies depending on the particular system under consideration . in some cases ,",
    "when simulating bulk processes , as in @xcite , there is no need to treat the bc separately , and periodic boundary conditions on all distribution functions may be used . in other cases ,",
    "fully three dimensional problems in helle - shaw cells are described in terms of two dimensional lb model by the modification of the forcing to account for the viscous drag of the top and bottom plates of the cell @xcite . therefore , molecular diffusion in the transverse direction is not described and similar bc can be applied to all fields . in the others ,",
    "where fluid flows in complex geometries @xcite or in narrow channels bounded by solid surfaces @xcite , the above - mentioned distinction in bc would be desirable .",
    "here we will use a different set of bc for color concentration , to ensure zero color - gradient normal to the solid surface . to this end",
    ", we implement a mirror - reflection condition or bounce - forward rule ( bf ) , where upon collision only the normal component of the particle velocity is changed . in figure  [ bf ]",
    "we show a schematic view of the bf collision rule .",
    "the last case was chosen arbitrarily , due to its very simple implementation , among the different possibilities that satisfy the mirror - reflection - type condition .",
    "for instance , it would be also consistent to split the incoming concentration into the two neighboring sites .",
    "physically , bb has the ( approximate ) effect of making both components of the fluid velocity vanish at the solid , consistent with the non - slip condition . a passive tracer may , however , diffuse along a solid boundary , so the relevant condition is that only the normal component of the flux vanishes at a solid .",
    "the bounce - forward rule is the obvious lb realization of the physical boundary condition .    to answer the question whether this bc improves the lb method for miscible fluids we shall present the results of numerical simulations using both bb and bf in two different situations : diffusion and taylor hydrodynamic dispersion in a two - dimensional straight channel",
    "we will exhibit a comparison between bb and bf , in two applications , diffusion and taylor dispersion in a two - dimensional channel .",
    "these situations are particularly important in terms of addressing the validity and accuracy of the above - mentioned boundary conditions , particularly if one is interested in further use of them in complex geometries .",
    "diffusion was studied varying the channel width @xmath7 from @xmath8 to @xmath9 in grid sites , in a channel of length @xmath10 , with periodic bc used at both ends . in the lb model the diffusion coefficient in bulk",
    "is given by , @xmath11 varying the relaxation parameter @xmath3 we have also studied diffusive transport for a set of bulk diffusivities ranging from @xmath12 to @xmath13 .",
    "in all the simulations for both boundary rules , the obtained depth - averaged color - concentration displays a gaussian distribution , and the mean square displacement grows linearly in time .",
    "however , the vertical dependence of the concentration , as well as the diffusivity values , strongly depend on the bc used . while concentration remains vertically - homogeneous using bf , in fig .",
    "[ vertical ] we show that , using bb yields the undesired effect of a transient vertical variation of color .",
    "two different situations can be distinguished in figure  [ vertical ] , namely , close to the mean position of tracer particles @xmath14 , or far from it .",
    "( note that @xmath14 is constant in time ) . at @xmath14 ( fig .",
    "[ vertical]a ) , the initial concentration gradient in drives tracer particles . due to the bounce",
    "back rule , particles close to the surface remain there longer , and the relative tracer concentration builds up . shortly after , particles close to the surface diffuse toward the center of the channel , and eventually the concentration gradient in vertical direction is smoothed out .",
    "on the other hand , far from the mean position of tracer particles the situation is inverted .",
    "bounce back at solid surfaces , makes the tracer particles mostly arrive from the center of the channel , and a vertical concentration gradient develops .",
    "thus , after several time steps , particles diffuse from the center toward the solid surfaces . at large times , the vertical gradient vanishes an concentration becomes homogeneous across the channel .    using bb ,",
    "the diffusion coefficient strongly depends on the vertical size of the channel .",
    "diffusive transport close to the solid surfaces is reduced due to the bb rule , yielding a smaller diffusion coefficient compared to bulk diffusivity .",
    "this effect becomes negligible when the gap is large enough or , when the diffusivity is sufficiently small . in figure  [ d_real ]",
    "we show the dependence of the diffusion coefficient ( relative to @xmath15 ) , on the size of the gap and bulk diffusivity .",
    "we also show that simulations using bf give @xmath16 , for any size and @xmath15 .",
    "as mentioned , the undesired effects due to bb boundary conditions become less significant at small diffusivities . when using @xmath12 the deviation of the numerical value from the expected one is within @xmath17",
    ". however , the use of small diffusion coefficients allows large concentration gradients , which may result in numerical instability .",
    "discrepancies between theory and simulations have been reported , in lb model of miscible fluids , for values of @xmath15 below @xmath18@xcite . also , for values of @xmath15 below @xmath18 , oscillations between negative and positive values of concentration have been observed @xcite .",
    "therefore , the parameter space where the model is fairly independent of the particular choice of the boundary condition rule , is very close to being numerically unstable .      finally , we compute the asymptotic hydrodynamic dispersion when a mean flow is set within the channel . in this case , dispersion has two different contributions , one due to molecular diffusion and the other due to spatial variations of the fluid velocity , namely taylor dispersion @xcite .",
    "asymptotic analysis of taylor dispersion in a two - dimensional channel of constant width @xmath7 and mean flow velocity @xmath19 gives the exact formula for the longitudinal dispersion coefficient@xcite , @xmath20    introducing the pclet number , which accounts for the relative magnitude of the convective and diffusive transport , @xmath21 , the previous equation can be rewritten as , @xmath22    concerning the numerical simulations , whether the bf rule is implemented or not , the taylor regime for the longitudinal dispersion is expected to hold . however , the effective diffusivity is slowed down when bb collision at solid surfaces is used . thus",
    ", as the diffusivity is smaller , the characteristic homogenization time in the transverse direction becomes larger .",
    "in other words , we may expect eq .",
    "( [ taylor_dispersion ] ) to hold , but where @xmath15 is replaced by the effective diffusion coefficient in the channel @xmath23 , as measured in diffusion simulations using bb rule .",
    "( section [ diffusion2d ] ) . in figure  [ taylor_fig ]",
    "we compare the numerical results with eq .",
    "( [ taylor_dispersion ] ) .",
    "there is a very good agreement between the numerical results and the taylor theory in both cases , using bb and bf as boundary rules .",
    "let us remark that solid and dashed lines corresponds exactly to eq .",
    "( [ taylor_dispersion ] ) with no adjustable parameter , and the only difference between them is the molecular diffusivity value .",
    "these results confirms the previous one , showing that the bb rule diminishes the diffusive transport and consequently enlarges the longitudinal hydrodynamic dispersion . a departure from eq .",
    "( [ taylor_dispersion ] ) at large pclet numbers can also be observed , where the largest discrepancy is @xmath24 .",
    "similar results , showing slightly smaller numerical values than theoretical ones have been previously reported @xcite .    as a conclusion to this section",
    "we may say that the effect of using the same bc on fluid and color distributions slows down the diffusive transport .",
    "this effect becomes appreciable when the system is narrow enough or the diffusion coefficient is large .",
    "we briefly review here the mathematical characterization of self - affinity .",
    "a more detailed discussion can be found in our previous work @xcite .",
    "we consider a rock surface without overhangs , whose height is given by a single - valued function @xmath25 , where the coordinates @xmath26 and @xmath27 lie in the mean plane of the fracture .",
    "self - affine surfaces @xcite display scale invariance with different dilation ratios along different spatial directions ( in contrast to self - similar surfaces which stretches the coordinates with equal ratios ) .",
    "experiment indicates that isotropy can be assumed in the mean plane , implying that there is only one non - trivial exponent relating the dilation ratio in the mean plane to the scaling in the perpendicular direction , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the roughness or hurst exponent @xcite . in all cases",
    "the roughness exponent is chosen as the experimentally - observed value @xmath30 .",
    "we shall emphasize the limiting situation of narrow fractures , in which the two surfaces are very close to each other .",
    "consider the situation in which a rock of lateral size @xmath31 is fractured and the two surfaces are simply displaced by a distance @xmath32 , perpendicular to the mean fracture plane , with no relative shift .",
    "the fluctuations ( the difference between the maximum and minimum values of @xmath33 ) scales as @xmath34 . if @xmath7 is the width of the fracture , then the limiting situation corresponds to @xmath35 .    in narrow fractures ,",
    "the correlation between the two sides is an important feature for the dispersion process , and we consider two possibilities .",
    "we first study fractures where the upper surface has been simply translated a distance @xmath7 normal to the mean plane , so that the local aperture @xmath36 equals the constant @xmath7 .",
    "alternatively , the two surfaces may have a relative lateral displacement @xmath37 in the mean fracture plane , accompanied by a displacement @xmath7 in the perpendicular direction , so that the two surfaces do not overlap . in this case",
    "the local aperture is given by the random variable .",
    "@xmath38 it turns out @xcite that @xmath37 is the lateral correlation length for fluctuations in the aperture , in the sense that @xmath39 and @xmath40 decorrelate for @xmath41 .",
    "the notion of fractal dimension also differs from the case of self - similar surfaces .",
    "it has been shown @xcite , that one needs in general several distinct notions .",
    "we are interested in the local and global box dimensions of vertical plane sections . using the self - affine scaling law for the correlation function , @xmath42 ^ 2 \\rangle = \\phi(\\ell )   \\left({\\delta x \\over\\ell } \\right)^{2\\zeta}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 is a microscopic length ,",
    "say a grain size , such that @xmath44 we can estimate , @xmath45    for length scales @xmath46 it can be seen from the previous relation that @xmath47 ( given that @xmath29 is smaller than one ) .",
    "this so called local property yields a local box counting dimension @xmath48 . on the other hand , for length scales",
    "@xmath49 , it is clear that @xmath50 .",
    "thus , the global box counting dimension is @xmath51 . as we consider @xmath43 as the lower cut - off of the self - affine behavior in real fractured system , we will focus on the global regime where the box dimension is one .",
    "this fact largely determines the convective - diffusive behavior , as we will discuss later .    in this paper we restrict ourselves to the two - dimensional case where the surface is invariant in the @xmath27 direction , @xmath52 , and the mean flow ,",
    "when present , is forced in the @xmath26 direction by a constant pressure drop . in a subsequent paper we will extend these calculations to fully three dimensional fractures , but it is convenient , both conceptually and in the numerical simulations , to regard the system as having a translationally invariant third dimension .",
    "we use statistically self - affine surfaces with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the periodicity is not a physically essential ingredient here , but has some calculational advantages in alleviating finite - size effects .",
    "the surface is generated by a fourier synthesis method , based on power - law filtering of arrays of independent random numbers @xcite .",
    "in this section we study diffusion in two - dimensional self - affine fractures . the approach will be based on the tortuosity concept @xcite .",
    "it is a common characteristic in fluid transport in porous media , and in fractures in particular , that the actual path followed by the fluid is very tortuous . in our fractured two - dimensional systems , a purely geometrical definition of tortuosity",
    "can be done , by considering the ratio of the shortest continuous paths between any two points within the fracture to the length of the system projected on to the main plane @xcite .",
    "it is clear that , for narrow fractures , this ratio will approach the ratio between the length of the surface profile in the @xmath53 plane to the distance @xmath54 between the two points .",
    "then , if @xmath55 is the true length between the two points separated a distance @xmath56 , we can write for the tortuosity , @xmath57    the tortuosity factor @xmath58 accounts for the reduction in diffusivity , due to irregular geometries , in a very simple way . along the actual average - path of tracer particles",
    ", diffusion behaves as in free bulk , where the diffusion coefficient is the free bulk molecular diffusion coefficient @xmath15 . on the other hand , diffusive spreading along the @xmath26 axis",
    "is reduced , due to the difference between @xmath55 and @xmath59 . in terms of @xmath58",
    ", this difference can be accounted for by writing , @xmath60 ( some authors prefer to define tortuosity as @xmath61 , or as the inverse of this definition @xcite ) .    for the previous equation to be meaningful one should have a constant value of @xmath58 , that is , independent of @xmath59 . whether or not @xmath58 is constant",
    "clearly depends , for narrow fractures , on the dimension of the vertical plane sections of the surface . in general",
    ", the effective length @xmath55 depends on @xmath59 through @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the dimension of the surface profile .",
    "therefore , while at local length scales @xmath64 and @xmath58 depends on @xmath59 , at global length scales , considered in this work , @xmath65 and the tortuosity factor is constant @xcite . for the numerically - generated self - affine surfaces used in this work",
    ", we tested the dependence of the effective length @xmath55 on @xmath59 . using the method of ` dividers ' @xcite to measure @xmath55",
    ", we obtain , in all cases , a linear relation between the dividers opening @xmath66 and @xmath67 , _ i.e. _ @xmath68 .    the fact that @xmath58 is constant has some important consequences on diffusive transport .",
    "first , the relation between mean square displacement and time should be linear ( after perhaps a transient time ) .",
    "second , the distribution of tracer concentration should be asymptotically gaussian , and independent of the initial distribution of tracer .",
    "finally , the correction due to tortuosity is strictly geometrical and therefore it should be independent on the actual value of the free bulk molecular diffusivity @xmath15 .    in fig .",
    "[ linear ] we show the linear dependence of the mean square displacement on time , for different values of the diffusion coefficient .",
    "many other simulations , with different values of @xmath15 and @xmath7 were performed , and in all cases a linear relation was obtained . in fig .",
    "[ gaussian ] we show how the same gaussian distribution is approached at long times , starting from three different initial distribution of tracer particles . finally , in fig .",
    "[ f_tortuosity ] we show that the tortuosity factor is a strictly geometrical property , being clearly independent on the diffusivity of the tracer particles .      in the previous section",
    ", we discussed the linear relation between the effective length @xmath69 and @xmath31 , and its consequences on diffusive transport .",
    "we showed that the effect of surface roughness on diffusion can be accounted for by a purely geometrical property of the system , the tortuosity @xmath58 .",
    "however , it remains to analyze the dependence of @xmath58 on geometrical parameters that describe the system .",
    "of particular importance , is the dependence of @xmath58 on the width of the fracture @xmath7 .",
    "the theoretical analysis presented here will closely follow the kind of approximation used in @xcite , where the fracture is divided into a sequence of quasi - linear segments at varying orientation angles .",
    "first , we estimate a typical size @xmath70 in the direction of the mean flow over which the fluctuations in the vertical direction are small compared to the effective aperture of the channel . a segment of length @xmath71 is roughly straight",
    "when @xmath72 is a small fraction of @xmath7 , which yields @xmath73    returning to the entire fracture , each @xmath70-channel is oriented at some angle @xmath74 with respect to the mean plane , and has effective aperture @xmath75 , and length @xmath76 .",
    "thus , we write for the total length of the channel @xmath77 finally , taking into account that @xmath78 is the number of channels , we can convert the sum into an average over the distribution of angles , and write for the tortuosity , @xmath79    since @xmath80 , the channels have small vertical fluctuations , and we can give a simple estimate of the cosine as @xmath81 replacing this approximation in eq .",

    "( [ variance ] ) and ( [ dz ] ) ) .",
    "a more precise evaluation can be obtained based on a gaussian distribution of heights @xcite , as supported by experimental measurements @xcite and , in fact , the actual distribution given by our numerical procedure for generating self - affine surfaces . in this case",
    ", the angular average is given by @xmath84 where @xmath85 , and @xmath86 is the _ confluent hypergeometric function of the second kind_@xcite .",
    "therefore , we can get a more convincing evaluation of the tortuosity of a narrow two - dimensional self - affine fracture , using the leading terms in the asymptotic representation of @xmath19 for large @xmath26 and eq .",

    "the only adjustable parameter is the coefficient @xmath89 , which is found to be @xmath91 in good agreement with the expected value .    in fig .",
    "[ small_s ] we present the numerical results obtained for smaller fluctuations in the surface height . in this case",
    "it is clear that the exponent differs from the predicted value .",
    "we believe that , this discrepancy comes from the discretization of the surface height which introduces a larger error the smaller the fluctuations are .",
    "however , we also show in fig .",
    "[ small_s ] , the theoretical correction to diffusive transport computing the tortuosity factor directly through the numerically - generated surfaces instead of using the asymptotic analysis . in this case",
    "a good agreement is recovered and the only adjustable parameter @xmath92 is again of order one ( and in agreement with previous results @xcite ) .",
    "similar results were obtained using several intermediate values for the surface fluctuations in height , where the reduction in diffusivity is always in agreement with the correction due to the tortuosity of the channels . in addition , we found that the decrease in diffusivity is , in all cases , well described by a power - law ( where the power - law exponent increases slightly with the amplitude of the surface fluctuations ) , for which we have no explanation .",
    "in this section we address the case of taylor hydrodynamic dispersion in narrow fractures .",
    "first , we will analyze the case where the two sides of the fracture are displaced normally to the mean fracture plane , and then we will turn to the case where there is a lateral shift as well .    when the two complementary surfaces are simply displaced vertically by a distance @xmath32 , the vertical aperture of the system",
    "is constant everywhere .",
    "nevertheless , the flow field differs from one in a straight channel , due to variations in the local width of the channel normal to the mean flow direction . in fig .",
    "[ stream ] we show a set of streamlines inside a fracture , where the effect of the varying effective aperture of the fracture is evident ( aperture normal to the mean flow ) .",
    "moreover , in @xcite we show that the complex geometry of the fracture gives rise to low - velocity zones ( close to depressions and corners ) , reducing the permeability of the system . in order to describe the dispersion process",
    "we need to obtain a measure of the fraction of the system that is subject to convection . to this end",

    "let us note that the uncertainty in the computed dispersion coefficient is considerably larger than in the case where there is no lateral shift .",
    "it has been shown , in three - dimensional fractures and under lubrication approximation for the velocity field , that a lateral shift yields geometric dispersion for tracer particles advected along the flow @xcite .",
    "this effect is due to different mean velocity along different streamlines . in our case ,",
    "the two - dimensional nature of the fractures prevents the presence of geometric dispersion , given that the height - averaged velocity is constant throughout the system .",
    "however , an analogous effect appears when averaging over different fractures , giving rise to a large dispersion in the computed mean velocity and dispersion coefficient .",
    "in fact , from the previous discussion an uncertainty proportional to the mean velocity is expected when averaging the dispersion coefficient ( corresponding to a geometric dispersion term in fully three - dimensional fractures ) .    in order to validate the dispersion results obtained by means of the lb method",
    ", we shall now compare them with results computed via a monte - carlo ( mc ) approach to dispersion process . in the mc method ,",
    "one follows the displacement of a large number of particles , or random walkers , moving in a two - dimensional fracture .",
    "the motion of each particle is a combination of the effects of molecular diffusion and convection ( we assume , as in the lb simulations that tracer particles moves independently of each other ) . in time",
    "@xmath115 , a particle is displaced according to @xmath116 where @xmath117 is the velocity field obtained by the lb method , @xmath118 is a unit vector with random orientation , and the amplitude of the random steps has been chosen so that the variance of any coordinate is @xmath119@xcite .",
    "boundary condition at solid surfaces are implemented as in @xcite , where those random steps that would take the particle outside the channel are suppressed .",
    "the sequence of steps is repeated while recording the distance @xmath54 from the initial position of the particle .",
    "the process is repeated for a large number of particles and average values are computed .",
    "we found an excellent agreement between the two methods . in fig .",
    "[ montecarlo ] we compare the mean square displacement as a function of time obtained using lb and mc methods .",
    "the agreement is evident , and it can be seen that after releasing @xmath120 particles in the mc simulations , the noise is negligible .",
    "both simulations corresponds to a fracture of mean aperture @xmath101 , length @xmath10 , and a lateral shift between surfaces @xmath109 .",
    "it is also interesting to note , in fig .",
    "[ montecarlo ] , a change in the slope at time @xmath121 , which approximately corresponds to the characteristic time for transverse diffusion across the aperture @xmath122 .",
    "therefore , this marked change in slope is showing the transition towards taylor - like spreading at times larger than @xmath123 .",
    "in a straight channel , the presence of convection increases the dispersion of tracer particles .",
    "the same effect is usually found in porous media , including fracture systems .",
    "however , in the case where surfaces are laterally shifted , and at very small pclet number , we observed the opposite behavior .",
    "that is , the presence of convective transport inside the fractures reduces the dispersion of tracer particles .",
    "this effect can be observed in fig .",
    "[ shift ] , at very small pe the dispersion coefficient grows as the flow rate decreases . in order to validate this observation",
    "we simulate the dispersion process with two other methods .",
    "the first one is the mc method presented before .",
    "the second method is a variation of the mc where , instead of using the velocity field computed by means of lb simulations , we use lubrication approximation for velocities . in the lubrication approximation",
    "the velocity @xmath124 is given by , @xmath125 where @xmath126 is the local aperture of the fracture .    in figure [ low ]",
    "we show the results obtained using the three different methods in a range of pe from @xmath127 to @xmath8 .",
    "the agreement between methods is excellent and all show an initial decrease in dispersion due to the presence of weak convective transport .",
    "we believe that , at very low velocities , the main effect of convective transport is to carry out tracer from _ low - velocity _ zones , and thus , reducing dispersion .",
    "this explanation is supported by the fact that lubrication approximation yields very similar results .",
    "( note that this approximation assumes local poiseuille profile without accounting for possible stagnant zones ) .",
    "unfortunately , the small pclet numbers at which this surprising effect arises , makes it very difficult to be experimentally measured .",
    "in first place , we have presented a new set of boundary conditions to describe diffusive transport within the lattice - boltzmann method .",
    "we tested this new boundary rule in two situations , simple diffusion and taylor dispersion in two - dimensional straight channels .",
    "we showed that the proposed bounce - forward rule improves the accuracy of the method and does not possess the undesirable effects of the bounce - back rule , i.e. , dependence of the diffusion coefficient on the aspect ratio of a straight channel and transient concentration gradients near solid walls .",
    "even though the accuracy might be recovered in the bb case using small diffusivities , we showed that this option leads the simulations towards the numerical instability border .",
    "we then turn to study diffusive transport in two - dimensional self - affine fractures .",
    "first , we showed that the slow - down in diffusive transport can be accounted for by the purely - geometric tortuosity factor .",
    "our numerical simulations have verified all the implications of this result , that is , linear spreading on time , gaussian distribution of tracer and independence of geometrical effects on the actual value of the diffusivity .",
    "secondly , using analytic arguments in the limit of small aperture fluctuations , we have obtained an expression for the tortuosity in terms of the fracture gap and the hurst exponent characterizing the fracture surface .",
    "numerical simulations verify the validity of the theoretical approach even when the discrete nature of the surface seems to affect the asymptotic scaling law .",
    "finally we studied tracer dispersion in fractures in the presence or not of a lateral shift between complementary surfaces .",
    "in both cases we showed that tracer spreading can be described as analogous to taylor - like dispersion in a straight channel . in the case without lateral shift we showed that , the enhancement in dispersion can be mostly understood assuming an effectively reduced aperture for fluid transport , due to the rugosity of the surface .",
    "the @xmath0-parameter measuring this effective aperture , and computed from permeability measurements , was shown to be similar to that estimated from dispersion measurements .",
    "we also presented a novel result , showing a decrease in tracer dispersion when convective transport is set in the fracture .",
    "this last observation was obtained in the frame of three different numerical approaches .",
