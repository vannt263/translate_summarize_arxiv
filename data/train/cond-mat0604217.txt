    "the generation and control of spin currents in various solid state systems have been an area of active research interest .",
    "such systems can be broadly grouped into two categories ; those which have broken time - reversal symmetry ( trs ) and those which do not .",
    "examples of the first group include chiral superfluids and superconductors such as two dimensional ( 2d ) @xmath4he - a films @xcite , 2d layered strontium ruthenate @xcite and @xmath5 superconductor @xcite .",
    "in these systems , the superfluid or superconducting order parameters break trs and also provide a gap for the quasiparticle states at fermi surface .",
    "such a gap , together with broken trs , naturally lead to chiral edge states and hall effect @xcite .",
    "however , none of these systems support the usual charge hall effect , since they are either charge neutral ( @xmath4he - a ) or do not have conserved physical charge density ( ruthenates , @xmath5 superconductors)@xcite .",
    "instead , they support spin and thermal hall currents which were found to be quantized with @xmath6 in @xmath5 systems @xcite , and @xmath7 in @xmath4he - a and triplet superconductors @xcite . the second class of systems which do not break trs but exhibit spin - hall effect include doped semiconductors with spin - orbit interaction @xcite and graphene @xcite . in graphene , which provides a realization of haldane s model @xcite , the spin - orbit interaction provides the gap for the effective low - energy dirac - like hamiltonian of the electrons near the fermi ( @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) points @xcite .",
    "such a gap breaks trs individually for each spin species , but leaves the whole system invariant .",
    "consequently , one expects a quantized charge hall current @xmath10 in the presence of an external electric field separately for the spin species @xmath11 .",
    "these currents move in opposite directions so that @xmath12 .",
    "thus the total charge hall current vanishes ; however , there exists a net spin - hall current @xmath13 . in the absence of a rashba term in the hamiltonian , this spin current is exactly quantized with a spin - hall conductivity @xmath14 . in the presence of the rashba term , where the number of up and down spin electrons are not conserved",
    ", the spin - hall conductivity deviates from its quantized value @xcite .",
    "this bulk picture of the spin - quantum hall effect in graphene is further supported by numerical verification of the presence of chiral edge states at the boundaries of the 2d graphene sheet @xcite .",
    "it has also been shown that although the spin - hall conductivity deviates from its quantized value , the spin - hall effect and the edge states are robust against weak rashba coupling @xcite .",
    "the quantization of spin - hall conductivity in both classes of such quasi 2d systems necessitates the existence of topological terms in their low energy bulk effective action .",
    "the nature of these topological terms depends crucially on whether the system is invariant under trs or not . for systems with broken trs",
    ", it has been shown that the low energy effective action has a su(2 ) hopf term which may lead to quantized spin - hall current in the presence of an external magnetic field gradient @xcite .",
    "however , the details of the spin response of the triplet superconductors is expected to be qualitatively different from both singlet @xmath5 superconductors where the pair potential does not break spin - rotational symmetry , and @xmath4he - a , which , being charge neutral , do not experience meissner screening",
    ". a detailed understanding of the spin - current in triplet superconductors therefore requires an analysis of its effective action in the presence of an arbitrary zeeman field . such a study has not been undertaken so far .",
    "in contrast , for the second class of systems which respects trs , one expects a crossed hopf term @xcite which leads to a spin - hall current in the presence of an external electric field .",
    "however , such a term has not been explicitly derived for graphene .",
    "the presence / absence of trs is also crucial for the properties of the chiral edge states in these systems .",
    "such states are well - known to exist for both triplet and singlet ( @xmath5 ) chiral superconductors @xcite . in these systems ,",
    "the edge modes corresponds to localized bogoliubov quasiparticles states which have zero charge , but carry a finite charge current @xcite . for singlet @xmath5 superconductors",
    ", it is well known that the edge states also have a definite spin quantum number and would therefore carry a quantized spin - hall current in the presence of an external magnetic field @xcite .",
    "however , the spin structure of the edge states in triplet chiral superconductors has not been studied before .",
    "in contrast , for systems which preserves trs , the edge modes , in the absence of external perturbations , can not carry any net charge current , but is expected to carry a finite non - quantized spin current @xcite .",
    "however , as we shall show , they can carry a experimentally detectable quantized charge current , if a population imbalance of spin - up and spin - down electrons is created at the edge .",
    "the main results reported in this work are the following .",
    "first , for triplet chiral superconductors with the pair - potential given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 denotes pauli matrices in spin - space , @xmath17 denotes the fermi wavevector , and @xmath1 denotes a direction in spin space orthogonal to the spin of the cooper pair @xcite , we show that the spin structure of the chiral edge states is qualitatively different from the previously studied @xmath5 superconductors @xcite .",
    "in particular , these edge states carry a quantized spin - current in response to an external magnetic field @xmath3 only if the external magnetic field is applied along the @xmath1 vector .",
    "the spin - current for @xmath18 is screened by meissner current of the condensate .",
    "second , we obtain an effective action for the bulk system in the presence of an arbitrary external zeeman field , and derive an expression for bulk spin - current from this effective action for arbitrary relative orientation of the applied zeeman field @xmath3 and @xmath1 . we compare this bulk spin - current with its edge counterpart for both @xmath19 and @xmath18 . in the limit of zero external zeeman field",
    "our effective action reduces to those derived in ref .   and contains an su(2 ) hopf term .",
    "third , for the trs invariant system graphene , starting from the low energy dirac - like hamiltonian @xcite , we derive an effective action in the presence of an external electromagnetic field , and show that it contains a crossed hopf term @xcite which leads to a quantized spin - hall current in response to an external electric field .",
    "we also include a weak rashba term in the hamiltonian @xcite and demonstrate that the spin - current deviates from its quantized value in the presence of such a term .",
    "finally , we present a solution of the edge problem in graphene for the armchair edge and obtain analytical expressions for the energy dispersion and wavefucntions of the edge states .",
    "the properties of the edge states obtained from this analytical derivation matches previous numerical results @xcite .",
    "we also point out that these edge states can carry a quantized charge current in response to an applied magnetic field which can be experimentally measured .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows .",
    "we discuss the properties of triplet chiral superconductors in sec .",

    "[ ruedge ] , we develop the edge state picture and discuss the spin structure of the edge states .",

    "for triplet superconductors , cooper - pairing occurs in the @xmath20 , @xmath21 channel , and consequently the pair - potential ( eq .  [ pp1 ] ) breaks spin - rotational invariance .",
    "this is manifested in the presence of the @xmath1 vector in the expression of the pair - potential ( eq .  [ pp1 ] ) which refers to a direction orthogonal to the direction of the spin @xmath22 of the cooper pair , so that a choice of spin quantization axis along @xmath1 implies opposite - spin pairing @xcite . in the presence of such a pair potential ,",

    ". we shall use this action to analyze the edge and the bulk properties of the system in secs .",
    "[ ruedge ] and [ rubulk ] .      in this section ,",
    "we analyze the spin properties of the edge states .",
    "we shall assume that the @xmath1 vector is fixed along a specific direction due to the spin - orbit interaction throughout the superconductors .",
    "this is expected to be the case for layered chiral superconductors @xmath30 where the @xmath1 vector is fixed along c - axis perpendicular the @xmath31 plane @xcite . in this section",
    ", we shall adapt the following convention for the choice of spin - quantization axis for the electrons : if an external magnetic field is applied , the spin - quantization will be chosen along the field ; else it will be chosen to be along @xmath32 .",
    "for the rest of this work , we shall choose @xmath33 , unless explicitly mentioned .",
    "first , we consider the edge problem in absence of the zeeman field . here",
    "we shall consider a semi - infinite sample with an edge at @xmath34 and assume a step - function dependence of the pair - potential @xcite . in this case , the bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) equation can be written as @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the linearized dispersion and @xmath37 is the in - plane momentum component of the fermi surface along the edge , and @xmath38 is the four - component spinor wavefunction .",
    "it is well - known that in the presence of an edge which enforces a boundary condition @xmath39 , eq .",
    "[ bdg1 ] admits localized chiral edge states @xcite @xmath40 where @xmath41 for @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 is the global u(1 ) phase of the pair - potential @xmath45 , and @xmath46 are the coefficients of spin - up and spin - down components of the normalized single - particle wavefunctions with @xmath47 .",
    "these chiral edge quasiparticles are bcs quasiparticles with equal proportion of spin @xmath48 electrons and spin @xmath49 holes ; consequently , they do not carry any charge but have a well defined a spin quantum number @xmath50 along @xmath1 .",
    "they have a group velocity @xmath51 and carry a charge current @xcite @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the density of states for edge state with spin @xmath50 at zero temperature .",
    "the charge current is not carried with group velocity and is not quantized .",
    "the presence of such a charge current at the edge of a superconductor also leads to meissner screening current by the condensate , so that the sum of magnetic fields due to both the currents vanish at the bulk of the superconductor @xcite .    in the absence of any external zeeman magnetic field , the spin - up and spin - down edge quasiparticle states are equally populated and hence the spin - current carried by them cancels",
    "now , let us apply a zeeman magnetic field @xmath0 along @xmath1 so that ( choosing the spin - quantization axis along @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) the bdg equations for the edge quasiparticles states can be written as @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the bohr magneton and @xmath56 denotes the gyromagnetic ratio .",
    "we note that here the effect of the magnetic field is to shift the energies of the spin - up and spin - down states in _ opposite _ direction : @xmath57 . as a result , there is an imbalance in the population of the spin - up and spin - down quasiparticle states as shown in fig .",
    "[ figspin1 ] which leads to a net quantized edge spin - current @xmath58 note that the spin current , in contrast to the charge current , is associated with the group velocity @xmath59 of the edge states .",
    "further with our choice of spin - quantization axis ( along @xmath1 ) , the condensate comprises of cooper pairs with _",
    "opposite spin pairing_. hence the condensate do not carry any spin or spin - current and can not screen the edge spin - current .",
    "such a quantized spin current in the presence of external zeeman field is also carried by edge states in singlet @xmath5 superconductors regardless of the direction of the applied magnetic field .",
    "the situation for the triplet superconductors is different as we now show by studying the spin response of the edge states in the presence of the zeeman field applied perpendicular to @xmath1 . here , without loss of generality , we choose @xmath60 and take the spin - quantization axis along @xmath61 .",
    "the bdg equation can now be written as @xmath62 one immediately notes that in this case , the magnetic field does not shift the energy of the edge states , but shifts the fermi wave - vector for the spin - up and spin - down quasiparticles in opposite directions : @xmath63 .",
    "the bcs quasiparticles are now equal superposition of electron and hole states with the _ same spin _ @xmath48 . as a result , just as in the case of charge , they do not carry a spin quantum number along @xmath64 : @xmath65 .",
    "the edge states now carry a net charge current @xmath66 now let us consider meissner screening of this charge current . since we have chosen the direction of spin quantization axis perpendicular to the @xmath1 vector , we have equal spin pairing in the bulk ( @xmath67 ) and hence the cooper pairs carry a net @xmath68 . in the presence of a zeeman magnetic field ,",
    "the spin - up and the spin - down condensates see a shifted chemical potential @xmath69 .",
    "in this situation , one can apply the arguments of refs .   in a straightforward manner and show that the edge currents would be screened by spontaneously generated meissner current @xmath70 so as to cancel the net magnetic field due to the edge currents in the bulk .",
    "the edge states now also carry a net spin current , since the electron and holes with spin @xmath48 constituting the bcs quasiparticles have opposite velocities . in the presence of an external zeeman field",
    "@xmath18 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 are different , and consequently the net spin - current is given by @xmath73 notice that the spin current is not carried by the group velocity . further ,",
    "since the condensate now carry a net spin , the meissner current generated as the response to edge charge current also carry a net spin - current @xmath74 thus the edge spin current generated by the response of a magnetic external zeeman field @xmath18 is screened by the condensate , analogous to the charge current .",
    "therefore the response of the edge states to an applied zeeman field in triplet chiral superconductors depends crucially on the direction of the applied field .",
    "we shall discuss possible experiments to probe this behavior in sec .",

    "the corresponding contravariant vectors and operators can be obtained by applying the metric tensor @xmath82 .",
    "also , here we have followed ref .   to treat the zeeman magnetic field as the time component of an external su(2 ) gauge field @xmath83 with @xmath84 .",
    "the spatial component of @xmath85 are fictitious fields which shall be set to zero at the end of the calculation .",
    "the advantage of introducing these fictitious gauge fields becomes apparent when we note that the spin - current can be obtained using these fields as @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the effective action obtained by integrating out fermions in @xmath88 ( eq .  [ ac2 ] ) .",

    "thus the only non - vanishing coefficients can be written as @xmath183 it turns out @xcite that coefficients @xmath184 also satisfy the identity @xmath185 . using this , we find that the contribution of terms proportional to @xmath186 in the effective action leads to a total derivative which we ignore and those due to @xmath187 vanish identically .",

[ aterm ] is a sum of contributions from spin @xmath197 and @xmath198 sectors : @xmath199 . whereas each of these two contributions can be finite since the hamiltonian ( eq[grham1 ] ) breaks time reversal symmetry for each spin species , their sum must vanish since the total hamiltonian for both the spin species is time reversal invariant . thus we conclude that @xmath200 and hence @xmath201 , so that graphene does not support charge hall effect in the absence of an external magnetic field and also does not have a pure su(2 ) hopf term .",
    "however , the same argument tells us that @xmath202 , since @xmath203 .",
    "indeed a straightforward evaluation of @xmath195 shows @xmath204 .",
    "hence we conclude that the effective action of graphene supports a crossed hopf term @xmath205 where @xmath206 is the electromagnetic field tensor .",
    "this leads to a quantized hall spin - current ( eq .  [ scurrent ] ) @xmath207 where @xmath208 is the applied electric field .",
    "next we introduce the rashba term in eq .",

    "we shall restrict the analysis to the case of @xmath209 and assume that the strength of the rashba term is not sufficient to destroy the spin - hall phase . in the presence of such a term ,",
    "the inverse of the green function in @xmath210 ( eq .  [ s0 ] ) becomes @xmath211 one can now repeat the same analysis as described above with @xmath212 replaced by @xmath213 . since @xmath214 is identical to @xmath215 , one finds that all the arguments regarding the coefficients @xmath216 , and @xmath217 remain the same and , in the end , we are left with @xmath218 where the ellipsis represent terms which are higher order in @xmath219 , and we have obtained the last line by explicitly evaluating the matrix traces and frequency and momentum integrals in the expression of @xmath220 . thus we find that the spin - hall conductivity deviates from its quantized value and equals @xmath221 for @xmath222 .",
    "the edge states in graphene in the absence of any external magnetic field can be analytically obtained from the dirac hamiltonian @xmath153 ( eq .  [ grham1 ] ) for the armchair edge . throughout this section ,",
    "we shall restrict ourselves to the case @xmath223 .",
    "the geometry we study here is that of a semi - infinite sample occupying @xmath224 with an armchair edge at @xmath34 .",
    "for such an edge , the boundary condition demands both @xmath225 and @xmath226 to vanish at @xmath34 . in what follows",
    ", we construct an analytical solution for the low - energy subgap localized energy states of the graphene hamiltonian @xmath153 ( eq.[grham1 ] ) which respects the boundary condition @xmath227 and @xmath228 . notice that in doing so by starting from dirac equation , we ignore the lattice effects at the edge , which usually puts a momentum cut - off @xmath229 above which the present description breaks down .",
    "the estimate of @xmath229 can not be reliably done without going into numerical analysis of the lattice hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "to construct such a solution , we note that the only way to achieve the above - mentioned boundary condition is to superpose wave - functions in the @xmath8 and @xmath9 points .",

    "this is clearly an artifact throwing out the lattice and so we would expect the results to break down at momenta @xmath250 , as commented earlier .",
    "the edge states , in contrast to their chiral superconducting counterparts , have _ opposite _ group velocities for spin - up and spin - down electrons as shown in fig .",
    "[ spinedge ] .",
    "further , in a transverse momentum state @xmath235 , the edge states carry a charge current @xmath251 where we have neglected the small @xmath252 contributions .",
    "note that the charge current is carried with the group - velocity @xmath253 and thus has opposite direction for opposite spins .",
    "hence these edge states do not carry a net charge current for equal occupation of spin - up and spin - down electron states , but carry a net spin - current circulating along the edge .",
    "note that an estimation of the total spin - current carried by the edge requires a knowledge of the states at large @xmath235 , and hence can not be reliably done within this formalism .",
    "however , we would like to stress that the low - energy linear dispersion of the edge states with opposite group velocities for spin - up and spin - down electrons agrees well with the numerical calculations of refs.@xcite .",
    "the most direct way of detecting spin / charge current at the edge is to create a population imbalance of the spin - up and spin - down edge states .",
    "such experiments has been performed for quantum hall samples in ref .   and suggested for ruthenates in ref .. the idea is to apply a magnetic pulse @xmath254 to the edge of a chiral triplet superconductor with @xmath129 .",
    "this creates a imbalance in the population of the spin - up and spin - down edge states leading to local magnetization which travels with the group velocity @xmath59 .",
    "the magnetic moment due to this spin imbalance can be detected by a squid magnetometer as pointed out in ref .  .",
    "the spin structure of the edge states can also be verified since a similar experiment with @xmath18 will produce a null result .",
    "this feature distinguishes the triplet chiral superconductors from their singlet counterparts where the direction of the applied pulsed magnetic field does not matter .",
    "a similar experiment can be performed to verify the edge state picture for graphene .",
    "let us consider creating a population imbalance for sub - gap edge states in graphene by applying a magnetic field pulse @xmath0 along @xmath64 . in the absence of spin - flip scattering and for @xmath255 where the states in the bulk are gapped , such an imbalance would persist and lead to a circulating quantized charge current .",
    "the spin - flip scattering rate in graphene is expected to be small since the rashba coupling @xmath256mk is small compared to the spin - orbit gap @xmath257k , and thus we expect the population imbalance and hence the charge current to persist for a sufficiently long time @xcite .",
    "the magnitude of this charge current depends only on the population imbalance between up and down spin low - energy subgap electrons and hence , unlike the edge spin - current , can be reliably estimated from the edge state picture developed in sec.[gredge ] . using eq .",
    "[ ech1 ] , we obtain for the magnetic pulse along @xmath64 @xmath258 this quantized charge - current for @xmath259 leads to a net current of @xmath260na which can be easily detected by a setup similar to that proposed in ref .  .",
    "one of the central feature of the edge states in graphene is that the direction of this charge edge current depends on the direction of the applied magnetic pulse .",
    "this feature can also be detected by a time - of flight measurement analogous to those suggested in refs . .",
    "alternatively , one can also selectively populate the up or down - spin edge states by spin - polarized tunneling into the edge states .",
    "the direction of the edge current measured in such a tunneling experiment would depend on the polarization of the tunneling electrons and would serve as a definitive proof of the spin - dependent velocity of the edge states .    in conclusion",
    ", we have studied the bulk and edge properties of trs broken and trs invariant systems such as triplet chiral superconductors and graphene .",
    "we have shown that both the structure of the edge states and the topological terms in the bulk effective action of these systems depend crucially on whether trs is preserved or not .",
    "for trs broken systems such as triplet chiral superconductor , the edge states carry a net charge current and the bulk action contains a su(2 ) hopf leading to a spin - hall current in response to the gradient of applied zeeman magnetic field .",
