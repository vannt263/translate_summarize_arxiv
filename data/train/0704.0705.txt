    "the eikonal approximation @xcite has a long history of successful results in describing scattering processes like nucleon - nucleus scattering , heavy - ion collisions , and electroinduced nucleon - knockout reactions .",
    "the latter class of reactions , usually denoted as @xmath0 , provide access to a wide range of nuclear phenomena like short- and long - range correlations , relativistic effects , the transition from hadronic to partonic degrees of freedom , and medium modifications of nucleon properties .",
    "the interpretation of @xmath0 data heavily relies on an accurate description of the effect of the final - state interactions ( ) , i.e. , the interactions of the ejected proton with the residual nucleus such as rescattering and/or absorption .",
    "the eikonal approximation has been widely used to treat these distortions , either in combination with optical potentials @xcite , or with glauber theory , its multiple - scattering extension .",
    "the eikonal scattering wave functions are derived by linearizing the continuum wave equation for the ejected proton .",

    "several authors have investigated the effect of higher - order eikonal corrections in elastic nuclear scattering by protons , antiprotons , and @xmath5 particles @xcite , heavy - ion collisions @xcite , and inclusive electron - nucleus scattering @xcite .",

    "finally , in section  [ sec : concl ] , we state our conclusions .",
    "for the description of the @xmath0 reaction , we adopt the impulse approximation ( ia ) and the independent - nucleon picture . within this approach , the basic quantity to be computed is the transition matrix element @xcite @xmath8 here , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the relativistic bound - state and scattering wave functions , with @xmath11 the quantum numbers of the struck proton and @xmath12 and @xmath13 the momentum and spin of the ejected proton .",
