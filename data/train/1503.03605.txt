    "the paper is devoted to the numerical solution of small - strain quasi - static elastoplastic problems .",
    "such a problem consists of the constitutive initial value problem ( civp ) and the balance equation representing the principle of virtual work .",
    "a broadly exploited and universal numerical / computational concept includes the following steps :    * time - discretization of civp leading to an incremental constitutive problem ; * derivation of the constitutive and consistent tangent operators ; * substitution of the constitutive ( stress - strain ) operator into the balance equation leading to the incremental boundary value problem in terms of displacements ; * finite element discretization and derivation of a system of nonlinear equations ; * solving the system using a nonsmooth variant of the newton method .",
    "civp satisfies thermodynamical laws and usually involves internal variables such as plastic strains or hardening parameters .",
    "several integration schemes for numerical solution of civp were suggested . for their overview , we refer , e.g. , @xcite and references introduced therein . if the implicit or trapezoidal euler method is used then the incremental constitutive problem is solved by the elastic predictor / plastic corrector method .",
    "the plastic correction leads to the return - mapping scheme .",
    "we distinguish , e.g. , implicit , trapezoidal or midpoint return - mappings depending on a chosen time - discretization ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 7 ) .    in this paper",
    ", we assume that the plastic flow direction is generated by the plastic potential , @xmath3 .",
    "if @xmath3 is smooth then the corresponding plastic flow direction is uniquely determined by the derivative of @xmath3 and consequently , the plastic flow rule reads as follows , e.g.  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 8) : @xmath4 here , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 denotes the plastic strain rate , the plastic multiplier rate , the stress tensor and the hardening thermodynamical forces , respectively .",
    "the corresponding return - mapping scheme is relatively straightforward and leads to solving a system of nonlinear equations .",
    "a difficulty arises when @xmath3 is _",
    "nonsmooth_. mostly , it happens if the yield surface contains singular points , such as apices or edges .",
    "then the function @xmath3 is rather pseudo - potential than potential and its derivative need not exist everywhere . in such a case , the rule ( [ eqn_flow_rule ] ) is usually completed by some additive formulas depending on particular cases of @xmath3 and @xmath7 in an ad - hoc manner .",
    "for example , the implementation of the mohr - coulomb model reported in  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 6 , 8) employs one , two , or six plastic multipliers @xmath9 , depending on the location of @xmath7 on the yield surface . since the stress tensor @xmath7 is unknown in civp one must blindly guess its right location .",
    "moreover , for each tested location , one must usually solve an auxilliary system of nonlinear equations whose solvability is not guaranteed in general .",
    "_ these facts are evident drawbacks of the current return - mapping schemes . _    in associative plasticity",
    ", it is well - known that the plastic flow rule ( [ eqn_flow_rule ] ) together with a hardening law and loading / unloading conditions can be equivalently replaced by the principle of maximum plastic dissipation within the constitutive model .",
    "this alternative formulation of civp does not require special treatment for nonsmooth @xmath3 and enables to solve civp by techniques based on mathematical programming @xcite . in particular , if the implicit or trapezoidal euler method is used then the incremental constitutive problem can be interpreted by a certain kind of the closest - point projection @xcite . for some nonassociative models ,",
    "civp can be re - formulated using a theory of bipotentials that leads to new numerical schemes @xcite .",
    "these alternative definitions of the flow rule enable a variational re - formulation of the initial boundary value elastoplastic problem .",
    "consequently , solvability of this problem can be investigated ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the corresponding numerical techniques are usually also correct from the mathematical point of view . on the other hand ,",
    "such a numerical treatment is not so universal and its implementation is more involved / too complex in comparison with standard procedures of computational inelasticity .",
    "the approach pursued in this paper builds on the subdifferental formulation of the plastic flow rule , e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 6.3.9 ) , @xmath10 for nonsmooth @xmath3 . here",
    ", @xmath11 denotes the subdifferential of @xmath3 at @xmath12 with respect to the stress variable .",
    "if @xmath3 is convex at least in vicinity of the yield surface then this definition is justified , e.g. , by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* corollary 23.7.1 ) and is valid even when @xmath3 is not smooth at @xmath7 . on the first sight , it seems that ( [ inclusion_flow_rule ] ) is not convenient for numerical treatment due to the presence of the multivalued flow direction .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to show that the _ opposite is true _ , by demonstrating that the implicit return - mapping scheme based on ( [ inclusion_flow_rule ] ) leads to solving a just one system of nonlinear equations regardless whether the unknown stress tensor lies on the smooth portion of the yield surface or not at least for a wide class of models with nonsmooth plastic pseudo - potentials . using this technique , we eliminate the blind guessing and",
    "thus considerably simplify the solution scheme .",
    "moreover , the new technique enables to investigate some useful properties of the constitutive operator , like uniqueness or semismoothness , that are not obvious for the current technique .",
    "first of all , we illustrate the new technique on a simple 2d projective problem that mimics the structure of an incremental elastoplastic constitutive problem .",
    "consider the convex set @xmath13 and define the projection @xmath14 of a point @xmath15 as follows : @xmath16 the scheme of the projection is depicted in figure [ fig_projection ] .        clearly , the function @xmath17 is convex in @xmath18 , nondifferentiable at @xmath19 and @xmath20 if @xmath21 then @xmath22 .",
    "conversely , if @xmath23 it follows from the karush - kuhn - tucker conditions and ( [ motivation0 ] ) that the projective problem can be written as follows : _",

    "this crucial transformation will be derived in detail in section [ sec_dp ] on an analogous elastoplastic example .",
    "thus ( [ motivationb2 ] ) leads to the following system of equations : @xmath31 since ( [ motivationb3])@xmath28 implies @xmath32 , the system of three nonlinear equations reduces to a single one @xmath33 consequently , @xmath9 can be found in the closed form as @xmath34 from which one can easily compute @xmath35 by ( [ motivationb3])@xmath36 and ( [ motivationb3])@xmath28 .",
    "the presented idea is systematically extended on some elastoplastic models .",
    "this paper , part i , is focused on isotropic models containing : @xmath0 yield surfaces with one or two apices ( singular points ) laying on the hydrostatic axis ; @xmath1 plastic pseudo - potentials that are independent of the lode angle ; @xmath2 nonlinear isotropic hardening ( optionally ) .",
    "such models are usually formulated by the haigh - westergaard coordinates .",
    "further , the implicit euler discretization of civp is considered and thus two types of return on the yield surface within the plastic correction are distinguished : @xmath37 return to the smooth portion of the yield surface ; @xmath38 return to the apex ( apices ) .",

    "section [ sec_preliminaries ] contains some preliminaries related to invariants of the stress tensor and semismooth functions .",
    "section [ sec_dp ] is devoted to the drucker - prager model including the nonlinear isotropic hardening .",

    "the related graphical outputs are available in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ss - dp - nh ) .",
    "further , in vicinity of the limit load , we have observed lower rounding errors for the improved return - mapping scheme and thus lower number of newton steps is necessary to receive the prescribe tolerance than for the current scheme",
    ". however , the computational time for both schemes are practically the same since return to the apex happens only on a few elements lying in vicinity of the yield surface .      to be the simplified jirasek - grassl ( jg ) model applicable for the investigated soil material we fit its parameters using the associative perfect plastic drucker - prager ( dp ) model as follows : @xmath69 , @xmath444 , @xmath445 , @xmath446 , @xmath447 , @xmath448 and @xmath449 .",
    "recall that @xmath69 implies @xmath67 .",
    "further the value of @xmath277 corresponds to the uniaxial compressive strength computed from the drucker - prager model . to eliminate the influence of the exponential term in the function @xmath329",
    ", the value of @xmath450 is chosen sufficiently large .",
    "then the model is insensitive on @xmath451 and one can vanish it .",
    "finally , we require the same flow direction for both the models under the uniaxial compressive strength .",
    "since the yield function in the jg model is normalized in comparison to the dp model it is convenient to introduce the following relation between the plastic multipliers : @xmath452 , where @xmath453 is a scale factor .",
    "then the values of @xmath276 and @xmath454 are determined from the following equations : @xmath455 to be @xmath276 positive , @xmath453 must be greater than @xmath456 . to be in accordance with results of the dp model , we set @xmath457 . , the limit load factor is underestimated and for greater values of @xmath453 the limit load factor is overestimated .",
    "] comparison of yield surfaces ( in the meridean plane ) and flow directions for the dp and jg models is illustrated in figure [ fig_model_comparison ] . here , the fixed value @xmath458 is used for vectors representing the flow directions .",
    "loading curves for the investigated @xmath428 , @xmath429 meshes and the jg model are depicted in figure [ fig.load_path_h_jg ] and [ fig.load_path_h_q2_jg ] .",
    "we observe much faster convergence of the @xmath428-loading curves than for the dp model .",
    "moreover , the results for @xmath428 and @xmath429 elements are comparable .",
    "the computed values of the limit load factor on the finest @xmath428 and @xmath429 meshes are 4.124 , and 4.107 , respectively .",
    "the main idea of this paper is that the subdifferential formulation of the plastic flow rule is also useful for computational purposes and numerical analysis .",
    "namely , it has been shown that such an approach improves the implicit return - mapping scheme for non - smooth plastic pseudo - potentials as follows .    *",
    "the unique system of nonlinear equations is solved regardless on a type of the return .",
    "* it can be a priori determined the type of the return from a given trial state for some models ( without knowledge of the solution ) .",
    "* the scheme can be more correct than the current one , and its form enables to study properties of constitutive operators like existence , uniqueness and semismoothness .    in this paper ( part i )",
    ", the new technique has been systematically built on a specific class of models containing singularities only along the hydrostatic axis . beside an abstract model , two particular models",
    "have been studied : the drucker - prager and the simplified jirasek - grassl model",
    ". however , the presented idea seems to be more universal .",
