    "the planetary nebula luminosity function ( pnlf ) technique is one of the simplest methods for determining extragalactic distances out to @xmath6  mpc .",
    "one takes a deep exposure of a galaxy through a filter which passes light at [ o  iii ] @xmath0 , and compares the image to a slightly deeper exposure off the emission line .",
    "those stellar objects that appear on the [ o  iii ] @xmath0 image but not on the off - band frame are either planetary nebulae ( pn ) or compact h  ii regions",
    ". if the target object is a normal elliptical or s0 galaxy with no star formation , then the presence of h  ii regions can generally be discounted , and one is left with a list of pn , from which one can form a luminosity function .",
    "the power of the pnlf technique comes from the shape of the luminosity function . at faint magnitudes ,",
    "the pnlf has the power law form predicted from models of uniformly expanding shells surrounding slowly evolving central stars ( henize & westerlund 1963 ; jacoby 1980 ) .",
    "however , observations have demonstrated that the bright end of the pn luminosity function dramatically breaks from this relation , and falls to zero very quickly , within @xmath7  mag ( cf .",
    "jacoby 1992 ) .",
    "it is the constancy of this cutoff magnitude , @xmath8 , and its high monochromatic luminosity , that makes the pnlf such a useful standard candle .",
    "the shape and absolute magnitude of the pnlf cutoff has been successfully reproduced theoretically by a number of authors , including jacoby ( 1989 ) , dopita , jacoby , & vassiliadis ( 1992 ) , mndez ( 1993 ) , han , podsiadlowski , & eggleton ( 1994 ) , and richer , mccall , & arimoto ( 1997 ) .",
    "nevertheless , bottinelli ( 1991 ) and tammann ( 1992 ) have argued that the bright - end of the pnlf is actually a power law , and thus observations which do not reach the break in the luminosity function are not useful for distance measurements . in support of this model , bottinelli and tammann point to the `` overluminous '' [ o  iii ] @xmath0 sources found by jacoby , ciardullo , & ford ( 1990 ) in virgo elliptical galaxies , which can plausibly be argued to be part of a high - luminosity tail to the pnlf . by adopting the power - law model , and ignoring evidence for curvature in the observed pnlf of virgo , bottinelli and tammann have argued that the pnlf distance to this cluster is biased towards too low a value .",
    "although kolmogorov - smirnov and @xmath9 tests show this interpretation is highly unlikely , the most unambiguous way to test the hypothesis is to perform a deep , wide - field [ o  iii ] @xmath0 imaging survey of the virgo ellipticals and better define the shape of the faint - end of the pnlf .    in this paper , we report the results of a @xmath1 [ o  iii ] @xmath0 survey centered on the central elliptical of virgo , m87 . in  2 , we give the details of the survey , present the positions and magnitudes of 338 planetary nebulae found in the galaxy s envelope and outer halo , and estimate the photometric accuracy of our measurements by comparing our derived pn magnitudes with those given in jacoby , ciardullo , & ford ( 1990 ) . in  3 , we select two statistically complete subsets of these planetaries , and demonstrate that our planetary nebula luminosity function extends well onto the henize & westerlund ( 1963 ) tail , making a distance determination to the galaxy possible . in  4 , we discuss the surprising result that the pnlf of m87 s outer halo has a cutoff that is @xmath10  mag brighter than that for the inner part of the galaxy .",
    "we then show that , in retrospect , this behavior could have been predicted , since the intracluster stars of virgo should produce a considerable number of planetary nebulae , and some of these objects will be foreground to m87 . in  7 , we include this `` field '' contribution in our maximum likelihood analysis , and derive a distance to m87 of @xmath5  mpc , in good agreement with the previous pnlf distance determination to the galaxy .",
    "this result vitiates the hypothesis of bottinelli ( 1991 ) and tammann ( 1992 ) that the bright - end of the pnlf is an unbounded power - law .",
    "we conclude by discussing the implications intracluster pn have for morphological and dynamical studies of nearby clusters .",
    "on 6 and 7 april 1995 we surveyed a @xmath1 region of sky around m87 with the t2 kb ccd on the kitt peak 4-m telescope , which afforded a plate scale of @xmath11 per pixel .",
    "our on - band data consisted of seven exposures totaling 6.8  hours through a @xmath12  full - width - half - maximum ( fwhm ) interference filter centered at 5030     in the converging f/2.7 beam of the telescope .",
    "( the transmission curve of this filter at the ambient temperature of @xmath13  c is displayed in figure  1 . ) our off - band data was composed of five 540  sec exposures through a 267    wide filter centered at 5312   .",
    "in addition , an image , consisting of nine 900  sec exposures through a 75    fwhm interference filter centered at 6606   , was obtained on 8 april 1995 .",
    "these latter data were used to discriminate pn from compact h  ii regions , supernova remnants , and emission associated with m87 s cooling flow .",
    "the seeing for our @xmath0 on - band survey was @xmath14 ; our data was taken in better than @xmath15 seeing .",
    "planetary nebula candidates were identified and measured in a manner similar to that described in detail by jacoby ( 1989 ) , ciardullo , jacoby , & ford ( 1989b ) , and jacoby , ciardullo , & ford ( 1990 ) .",
    "after spatially registering all the individual frames , we combined the on - band , off - band , and frames of each field , using the imcombine task in iraf to reject radiation events .",
    "we then `` blinked '' the on - band [ o  iii ] @xmath16 sum against the off - band @xmath17 and sum .",
    "objects clearly visible on the on - band image , but absent on the off - band and frame were noted as possible planetaries .",
    "we confirmed these identifications by examining the candidates on each individual on - band frame , and then looking closely at the appearance of each object on our [ o  iii ] @xmath18 `` difference '' picture .",
    "equatorial coordinates for the pn candidates were derived using 86 reference stars from the usno - a.1.0 astrometric catalog ( monet 1996 ) to define the ccd s coordinate system ; the internal error in these coordinates is @xmath19 .",
    "[ o  iii ] @xmath0 photometry was accomplished relative to bright field stars with the daophot point - spread - function fitting routines ( stetson 1987 ) within iraf .",
    "these measurements were placed on the standard system by comparing large aperture measurements of the field stars with similar measurements of the stone ( 1977 ) and oke ( 1974 ) spectrophotometric standards g191b2b , feige  34 , bd+25  3941 , and bd+40  4032 .",
    "the dispersion in the photometric zero point computed from these stars was @xmath20  mag .",
    "finally , we computed the standard @xmath0 magnitudes for the pn by modeling the filter transmission curve ( jacoby 1989 ) and using the photometric procedures for emission - line objects described by jacoby , quigley , & africano ( 1987 ) . for this computation ,",
    "the systemic velocity of m87 was taken from the third reference catalog of bright galaxies ( de vaucouleurs 1991 ) , and the galaxy s envelope velocity dispersion was estimated from sargent ( 1978 ) .",
    "note that since the systemic velocity of m87 is near the peak of the filter transmission curve , a @xmath21  error in the latter quantity translates into a flux error of only @xmath22  mag .",
    "table  1 lists the pn candidates identified in the field of m87 , and follows on from the numbering scheme of jacoby , ciardullo , & ford ( 1990 ) .",
    "columns  2 , 3 , and 4 of the table list the objects epoch 2000 coordinates and @xmath0 magnitudes as defined by ciardullo ( 1989a ) , @xmath23 column  5 gives the semi - major axis of the isophote upon which each pn is superposed .",
    "for @xmath24 , these values were determined using the surface photometry of cohen ( 1986 ) ; at larger distances , the isophotal radii were computed from an assumed axis ratio @xmath25 and a galactic position angle of @xmath26 .",
    "table  2 lists an additional 9 pn that are projected very near other galaxies in the field and are presumably bound to them .",
    "these objects are included only for completeness and are not used in any of our analyses .",
    "table  3 gives the mean errors in our photometric measurements as reported by the psf - fitting algorithms of daophot .",
    "however , because portions of m87 have been previously surveyed by jacoby , ciardullo , & ford ( 1990 ) , it is possible to independently assess our errors by comparing the two data sets .",
    "of the 55  pn identified by jacoby et al .",
    ", 45 were recovered in this survey .",
    "a comparison of the magnitudes of the four pn with the highest signal - to - noise ratio shows that there is no statistical difference between the magnitude system of the two surveys : the zero point of the new observations is @xmath27  mag brighter than that from 1990 .",
    "however , as figure  2 demonstrates , a comparison of the entire dataset indicates that there is an additional source of scatter @xmath28  mag above that expected from the combined errors of the two measurements .",
    "part of the scatter is probably due to differences in filter transmission curves , as m87 s internal velocity dispersion will shift the emission lines of some objects on the filters wings .",
    "( we correct for this effect in the mean using the techniques outlined in jacoby ( 1989 ) and ciardullo , jacoby , & ford ( 1989b ) , but corrections for individual objects can not be made without velocity information .",
    "most of the additional error probably comes from the 1990 data , which was compromised by variable seeing and a high readout noise rca ccd .",
    "nevertheless , for the analysis below , we have added an additional 0.07  mag uncertainty in quadrature to the errors listed in table  3 . in practice",
    ", the amplitude of the error term makes very little difference to our final results .",
    "nine pn candidates from jacoby , ciardullo , & ford ( 1990 ) were not detected in this survey : pn # 30 , 35 , 45 , 49 , 50 , 51 , 52 , 53 , and 54 .",
    "in addition , pn candidate # 55 also was not recovered , but it fell at the position of a ccd defect , and thus could not be checked .",
    "eight of these objects were at the limit of the previous survey and below the stated completeness limit ; the other two were near the limit of completeness .",
    "all of the brighter pn from the previous survey were easily recovered in this new , wide - field survey .",
    "figure  3 displays the raw planetary nebula luminosity function for m87 .",
    "as is illustrated , our data extend well past the pnlf cutoff onto the expected power - law tail .",
    "although these data are not statistically complete , and can not be used for a precise distance estimate , it is clear that the position of the pnlf cutoff is much brighter than the @xmath29 value needed if the virgo core is at the distance suggested by sandage & tammann ( 1995 , 1996 ) .    to form a statistical sample of pn , we began by considering the detectability of planetary nebulae in our field .",
    "for most of our @xmath1 survey region , the background sky ( which is the dominant source of photometric noise ) is constant , hence the limiting magnitude for pn detections is constant .",
    "however , near the center of m87 , the galaxy background dominates , and the detectability of faint pn decreases . to address this problem , we used the results of ciardullo ( 1987 ) and hui ( 1993 ) , who showed that pn detections are essentially 100% complete when the daophot signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) is greater than @xmath30 , but no pn are detected when the snr is less than @xmath31 .",
    "thus , for our statistical sample , we included only those pn with a daophot measurement error of @xmath32  mag .",
    "at isophotal galactic radii greater than @xmath33 , this completeness criteria included essentially all pn brighter than @xmath34 . at galactic radii smaller than this , however , the limiting magnitude decreased quickly , so that by @xmath35 , no pn were detectable .",
    "we therefore defined our `` complete sample '' to be those pn with @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "figure  4 plots the planetary nebula luminosity function for the statistical sample of pn . from these data ,",
    "the pnlf distance to the galaxy can normally be derived by convolving the empirical model for the pnlf given by ciardullo ( 1989a ) @xmath38\\ ] ] with the photometric error function ( table  3 ) and fitting the data to the resultant curve via the method of maximum likelihood . however , in the case of m87 , the most likely empirical curve is a poor fit to the luminosity function ( cf .",
    "figure  4 ) .",
    "in fact , kolmogorov - smirnov and @xmath9 tests both exclude the ciardullo law at the 99.9% confidence interval .",
    "this is a remarkable result : none of the pnlfs from any of the @xmath12 previously studied galaxies differs significantly from the empirical law .",
    "moreover , the large number of pn detected in this survey can not be invoked to explain the discrepancy .",
    "the luminosity functions of m31 ( ciardullo 1989a ) , m81 ( jacoby 1989 ) , ngc  5128 ( hui 1993 ) , and ngc  4494 ( jacoby , ciardullo , & harris 1996 )",
    "all contain similar numbers of objects .",
    "the planetaries surrounding m87 are therefore unique in some way .",
    "an even more surprising result comes if we divide our pn sample in two , and compare the pnlfs of m87 s inner and outer halo . for the inner sample ( sample `` a '' ) , we take all the pn in our statistical sample with isophotal radii between @xmath33 and @xmath39 ; for the outer sample , ( sample `` b '' ) we take those pn with @xmath40 .",
    "both samples are plotted in figure  5 . as is illustrated",
    ", sample `` a '' contains pn # 1 , the extremely overluminous object first identified by jacoby , ciardullo , & ford ( 1990 ) .",
    "however , of the 20 brightest pn in the samples , 18 belong to sample `` b '' . more importantly , the shapes of the two pnlfs appear different : a kolmogorov - smirnov test reveals that the two samples are different at the 92% confidence level .",
    "again , this result is unique .",
    "explicit tests for changes in the pnlf cutoff with galactocentric radius have been performed with the large samples of pn available in ngc  5128 ( 224 objects ; hui 1993 ) and ngc  4494 ( 101 objects ; jacoby , ciardullo , & harris 1996 ) . in neither case was a gradient observed .",
    "internal and external tests on the @xmath12 early and late - type galaxies surveyed to date have shown that the pnlf cutoff is remarkably insensitive to changes in stellar population ( cf .",
    "jacoby 1996 ) .",
    "however , a number of mechanisms do exist which can , at least in theory , cause the pnlf technique to fail and produce a change in the observed value of @xmath41 .",
    "the first , and simplest , is to hypothesize that some instrumental effect exists , such as a radial gradient in the flatfield or the transmission curve of the filter .",
    "we have examined the former possibility by comparing the flatfields taken through our [ o  iii ] @xmath0 virgo filter with similar flats taken through a different ( lower redshift ) [ o  iii ] @xmath0 filter that same night ( cf .  feldmeier , ciardullo , & jacoby 1997 ) .",
    "no large - scale difference is apparent .",
    "similarly , we tested for problems with the filter bandpass by tracing the transmission curve of our filter at four different positions on the glass : to within @xmath42   , the central wavelength of our filter is the same at all points .",
    "since at the velocity of m87 , a @xmath42    shift in wavelength corresponds to , at most , a @xmath43 change in the filter transmission ( cf .",
    "figure  1 ) , the effect is much too small to explain our result .    a second method for explaining the variation in @xmath41 is to invoke non - uniform extinction in the galaxy .",
    "dust has been detected in the central regions of many elliptical galaxies ( sadler & gerhard 1985 ; ebneter , djorgovski , & davis 1988 ; goudfrooij 1994 ) , and several authors have suggested that extinction is responsible for the presence of radial color gradients in these systems ( witt , thronson , & capuano 1992 ; goudfrooij & de jong 1995 ; wise & silva 1996 ) . however , these studies have concentrated on the central regions of elliptical galaxies , while our survey deals exclusively with pn that are more than 1.5 effective radii ( @xmath44 ) from the galactic nucleus .",
    "in fact , there is little reason to believe that the extinction in m87 changes by @xmath45@xmath46@xmath47 between 2 and @xmath48 .",
    "moreover , even if there is a strong gradient in the dust distribution , this still may not translate into an observed gradient in @xmath41 .",
    "as feldmeier , ciardullo , & jacoby ( 1997 ) have shown , the location of a galaxy s pnlf cutoff is relatively insensitive to the presence of dust , as long as the scale length for the obscuration is smaller than that of the stars .",
    "( this is because the bright end of the pnlf ( the pnlf cutoff ) is always dominated by the bright , unextincted pn . unless the dust extends far enough to cover virtually all the pn , the bright - end cutoff will always consist of unreddened objects . )",
    "this makes it very unlikely that dust is responsible for the change in @xmath41 .",
    "although the absolute magnitude of the pnlf cutoff is extremely insensitive to the details of the underlying stellar population , a dramatic change in the metallicity or age of m87 s halo stars could , in principle , produce a change in @xmath41 similar to that observed .",
    "both observations ( ciardullo & jacoby 1992 ; richer 1994 ) and theory ( dopita , jacoby & vassiliadis 1992 ) suggest that galaxies with [ o / h ] @xmath49 can have a pnlf cutoff that is different from that of metal - rich populations by @xmath28  mag . unfortunately , this effect acts in the wrong direction : it is the metal - poor systems that have fainter values of @xmath8 . in order to explain the observed gradient ,",
    "the center of m87 would have to be metal - poor , and the halo would need to be metal - rich .",
    "observations show that this is extremely unlikely ( kormendy & djorgovski 1989 ) .    similarly , it is difficult to use population age to explain pnlf variations . according to the models of dopita , jacoby , & vassiliadis ( 1992 ) and mndez ( 1993 ) ,",
    "the location of the pnlf cutoff is nearly independent of age for populations between 3 and 12  gyr .",
    "if these models are correct , then in order to enhance the luminosity of the pnlf cutoff in m87 s outer halo , one must hypothesize an unrealistically young age for the stars , @xmath50  gyr .",
    "moreover , even this may not be sufficient , as there is excellent agreement between the pnlf and cepheid distances to the large magellanic cloud and m101 ( jacoby , walker , & ciardullo 1990 ; feldmeier , ciardullo , & jacoby 1997 ) .",
    "these observations strongly suggest that the location of the pnlf cutoff does not change by much , even in systems with active star formation .",
    "it is therefore difficult to attribute changes in the pnlf cutoff to variations in stellar population .",
    "the best hope for explaining the observed changes in m87 s halo pnlf lies in the virgo cluster itself .",
    "all of the above explanations implicitly assume that the pn projected onto m87 s outer halo are at the same distance as those pn which are members of the inner sample",
    ". however , if the virgo cluster has a substantial population of intracluster stars , this will not be the case , as some objects will be superposed in the foreground , and others will be in the background .",
    "for example , if the virgo cluster is at a distance of @xmath51  mpc , then the central @xmath52 core of the cluster ( de vaucouleurs 1961 ) , has a linear extent of @xmath53  mpc .",
    "if the core is spherically symmetric and filled with stars , then we might expect some intracluster objects to be up to @xmath54  mag brighter than the value of @xmath41 derived from galaxies at the center of the cluster .",
    "this is roughly what is observed in figure  5 .",
    "further evidence that the anomalous pnlf of m87 is due to foreground contamination comes from the fact that it is the outer sample of objects that has most of the bright pn .",
    "the number of foreground pn detected in any region of our ccd field should be roughly proportional to the area of the field ; since the outer region samples @xmath55 times more area than the inner field , those data should contain @xmath55 times more intracluster objects .",
    "in addition , m87 s sharply peaked surface brightness profile guarantees that the ratio of galaxy light to intracluster light in the inner field will be much larger than that in the outer field .",
    "consequently , the contribution of intracluster objects to sample `` a '' will be small , while that for sample `` b '' will be relatively large . again , this is roughly what is displayed in figure  5 .",
    "the intracluster pn hypothesis also explains the existence of `` overluminous '' planetary nebulae . in their survey of virgo ,",
    "jacoby , ciardullo , & ford ( 1990 ) identified a small number of [ o  iii ] @xmath0 sources that were significantly brighter than predicted by the empirical planetary nebula luminosity function .",
    "as discussed by jacoby , ciardullo , & harris ( 1996 ) , there are a number of possible origins for these objects , including compact h  ii regions , supernova remnants , wolf - rayet nebulae , supersoft x - ray nebulae , coalesced binary - star nebulae , chance superpositions of multiple objects , and even background quasars at @xmath56 . however , most of these explanations are not satisfactory from a stellar population standpoint , and the remaining ideas have little observational support .",
    "in fact , to investigate this question , we imaged the overluminous object ngc  4406 pn # 1 ( jacoby , ciardullo , & ford 1990 ) with the planetary camera of the _ hubble space telescope_. even at wfpc  ii resolution , the object is unresolved .",
    "since @xmath57 at virgo corresponds to a linear size of @xmath31  pc , this observation effectively excludes h  ii regions , supernova remnants , and pn superpositions from the list of possibilities .",
    "the existence of intracluster pn provides a natural explanation for the overluminous planetaries .",
    "it also explains why similarly bright [ o  iii ] @xmath0 sources have not been detected in the leo  i , triangulum , coma  i , or fornax clusters , nor in any field galaxy . if the overluminous pn are indeed intracluster in origin , then isolated field galaxies will be clean systems without foreground contaminants .",
    "furthermore , of the clusters observed to date , only fornax is rich enough to have a substantial intracluster environment , but it has very little front - to - back depth ( tonry 1991 ; mcmillan , ciardullo , & jacoby 1993 ) .",
    "virgo is the only cluster surveyed for pn where depth of field is important , and it is the only cluster in which overluminous planetaries are found .",
    "although the idea of intracluster planetary nebulae seems speculative , there is , in fact , conclusive evidence that such objects do exist . in their radial velocity survey of 19  pn in the halo of the virgo cluster elliptical m86 ( @xmath58  ) , arnaboldi ( 1996 ) found three objects with @xmath59  .",
    "these planetaries are undoubtably intracluster in origin .",
    "significantly , the pn observed by arnaboldi were originally identified with a 30    filter centered at 5007    ( jacoby , ciardullo , & ford 1990 ) ; intracluster objects with @xmath60  should have been strongly excluded .",
    "the only reason three were detected was that at @xmath61  , [ o  iii ] @xmath62 is shifted into the bandpass of the [ o  iii ] @xmath18 filter !",
    "since @xmath63 , only the very brightest pn could have been detected in this way .",
    "the existence of three intracluster objects in the arnaboldi sample therefore implies the presence of many more .",
    "similar evidence for a population of intragalactic stars in virgo comes from sn  1980i .",
    "this event occurred in intergalactic space , midway between the virgo core ellipticals ngc  4374 and ngc  4406 .",
    "considering that only @xmath64 probable sn  ia supernovae have occurred in the cluster core this century ( barbon , cappallaro , & turatto 1989 ) , the existence of one intergalactic object suggests that intracluster stars must be fairly common .",
    "intracluster pn have also been proven to exist in the fornax cluster .",
    "an imaging survey of three intergalactic fields by theuns & warren ( 1997 ) turned up ten planetary nebula candidates in 104 sq .",
    "arcmin of sky .",
    "when this detection rate is extrapolated to the entire cluster , the result is that a substantial fraction of the fornax cluster s stars , perhaps as much as @xmath65% , must be in intergalactic space . if the same is true for virgo , then the effect of intracluster objects on the galactic pnlfs can not be ignored .",
    "in fact , a quantitative estimate for the stellar mass of virgo s intracluster environment comes from observations of faint stars by the _ hubble space telescope .",
    "_ by comparing the number counts of objects in a virgo field with that in the hubble deep field , ferguson , tanvir , & von hippel ( 1997 ) found an excess of @xmath66 stars in a @xmath67 square arcmin region .",
    "if these are red giant and asymptotic giant branch stars , and if their mean lifetime at this luminosity is @xmath68  years , then a simple scaling of areas and lifetimes implies the existence of @xmath69  pn in our survey field .",
    "if , as implied by equation ( 2 ) , @xmath70 of these pn are bright enough to be observable , then our pnlf of m87 should be contaminated by @xmath71 intracluster objects . given the uncertainties involved ,",
    "this is in agreement with our data .",
    "the presence of intragalactic planetary nebulae in the virgo cluster impedes our ability to measure m87 s distance via the planetary nebula luminosity function technique . of the two samples of pn plotted in figure  5 ,",
    "clearly sample `` a '' is the better one to use for this purpose , but even it has some contamination from intracluster objects .",
    "this `` field '' contribution must be removed before any distance measurement to the galaxy can be attempted .    to do this",
    ", we first made the assumption that all pn with isophotal radii @xmath72 ( @xmath73 ) are intracluster in origin .",
    "( this is probably not strictly true ; bound pn have been found @xmath74 from the center of ngc  3379 ( ciardullo , jacoby , & dejonghe 1993 ) and more than @xmath75 away from the nucleus in ngc  5128 ( hui 1995 ) .",
    "however , this radius represents the best compromise between the need to exclude galactic objects and the desire for good counting statistics . )",
    "we then binned our sample of intracluster pn ( sample `` c '' ) into 0.2  mag intervals , and fit a smooth curve through the points .",
    "this curve , displayed in figure  6 , represents our estimate of the intracluster pn luminosity function .    with the field luminosity function in hand",
    ", we proceeded to derive an expression for the most likely distance of m87 .",
    "if we treat both the empirical pnlf of equation ( 2 ) and the intracluster pnlf as probability distributions , then in any magnitude range , @xmath76 , the expected number of observable pn is @xmath77 dm\\ ] ] where @xmath78 is the convolution of the photometric error function ( table  3 ) with the ( normalized ) empirical luminosity function , @xmath79 is the ( normalized ) intracluster luminosity function , @xmath80 is the total population of m87 planetaries in our field , and @xmath81 is the total number of intracluster pn in our field .",
    "following hanes & whittaker ( 1987 ) and ciardullo ( 1989a ) , the relative probability of observing a given set of @xmath82 planetaries down to limiting magnitude @xmath83 , as a function of distance modulus @xmath84 , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 , is @xmath85 now note that , although @xmath81 is an independent variable , it is constrained by the observations . if @xmath86 is the number of intracluster pn in sample `` c '' , and @xmath87 is the ratio of the area of sample  a  to the area of sample  c  , then @xmath81 should be distributed according to the poisson distribution function , @xmath88 , with a mean of @xmath89 and a standard deviation of @xmath90 .",
    "thus , when integrated over all @xmath80 and @xmath84 , equation ( 4 ) should give @xmath91 this renormalization of ( 4 ) enabled us to derive a distance to m87 despite the fact that the functions @xmath92 and @xmath79 are somewhat similar in shape .",
    "the formulation also maintains the advantage of the original pnlf maximum - likelihood technique , in that it avoids all problems associated with the binning of small amounts of data .",
    "figure  7 displays the likelihood of each solution as a function of m87 s distance modulus . for the plot ,",
    "we have assumed a foreground galactic extinction of @xmath45@xmath46@xmath93 ( burstein & heiles ( 1984 ) , a seaton ( 1979 ) reddening law , and a value of @xmath94 based on an m31 distance of 770  kpc ( freedman & madore 1990 ) and an m31 extinction of @xmath45@xmath46@xmath95 ( burstein & heiles 1984 ) .",
    "the most likely distance modulus is @xmath96 ( 14.4  mpc ) ; the formal uncertainty of the result is @xmath97  mag , @xmath98  mag .",
    "this distance would decrease by @xmath43 if the ciardullo ( 1989a ) value of @xmath8 ( @xmath99 ) were used .",
    "the present result is in excellent agreement with the previous pnlf distance determination .",
    "when scaled to the same set of assumptions regarding the pnlf zero point and galactic extinction , the jacoby , ciardullo , & ford ( 1990 ) value for m87 is @xmath100 ( @xmath101  mpc ) .",
    "note that the previous survey was limited by a small sample size ( only 36  objects in the statistical sample ) and a noisy ccd chip .",
    "it did , however , extend to smaller galactocentric radii than the present survey , and thus was not as badly contaminated by intracluster objects .",
    "consequently , although the present survey contains many more pn and has a greater photometric accuracy , the distance derivation is not significantly better than the older work .",
    "an interesting feature of our new pnlf distance measurement is the robustness of the result . because the empirical pnlf of equation ( 2 ) goes to zero at @xmath102 ,",
    "the earlier pnlf measurements in virgo were sensitive to the luminosity of the brightest one or two planetaries .",
    "in fact , as jacoby , ciardullo , & ford ( 1990 ) pointed out , the inclusion ( or exclusion ) of overluminous objects from their virgo samples could change the derived distances to galaxies by more than @xmath103 .",
    "( jacoby handled this problem by noting that overluminous pn could be excluded based on the overall quality of the fits  solutions that included overluminous objects were significantly poorer than fits without them . ) the present analysis , however , is much less sensitive to the existence of these objects .",
    "for example , if pn # 1 is arbitrarily excluded from our sample , the derived distance to m87 changes by less than 0.02  mag . figure  6 plots the best fit luminosity function , @xmath104 .",
    "as is illustrated , the fit is excellent .",
    "the agreement between the two pnlf distance estimates strongly refutes the contention of bottinelli ( 1991 ) and tammann ( 1992 ) that sample size affects pnlf distance measurements .",
    "the new measurement uses over a factor of two more planetaries than the older determination , yet the distance to the galaxy remains substantially the same .",
    "moreover , the presence of intracluster stars in virgo negates one of the core tenets of tammann ( 1992 ) , that overluminous pn are a natural extension of the empirical pnlf .",
    "this interpretation is no longer needed to explain the data .",
    "the distance error quoted above is the formal uncertainty derived from our maximum likelihood procedure , not the total error in the computed distance . to obtain the latter quantity , the uncertainty in the solution",
    "must first be combined with usual random uncertainties associated with the photometric zero point ( 0.03  mag ) , the correction associated with going from the daophot magnitudes to the large aperture magnitudes ( 0.02  mag ) , the filter calibration ( 0.03  mag ) , and the galactic extinction ( 0.05  mag ) .",
    "in addition , the present analysis has an additional error , that associated with the uncertain _ shape _ of the field pn luminosity function .",
    "simulations suggest that this error is small , probably less than @xmath105  mag .",
    "thus , the total random uncertainty in our distance determination is @xmath106  mag .    finally , two sources of error that affect all pnlf measurements is the uncertainty in the distance to m31 , which provides the zero point ( 0.10  mag ) , and the definition of the empirical pnlf itself ( 0.05  mag ) .",
    "the addition of these two quantities in quadrature yields a total uncertainty of 0.16  mag .",
    "our new distance modulus to m87 , @xmath107 ( @xmath108  mpc ) is consistent with distances to the galaxy derived from the surface brightness fluctuation method ( @xmath109 ; ciardullo , jacoby , & tonry 1993 , tonry 1997 ) , and the globular cluster luminosity function ( @xmath110 ; whitmore 1995 ) .",
    "it is , however , marginally smaller than the median distance of @xmath111  mpc obtained from cepheid measurements in the virgo cluster ( pierce 1994 ; ferrarese 1996 ; sandage 1996 ; saha 1996a , b ) .",
    "this difference may not be significant ; our results point out the problem with using cepheids to estimate the distance to the virgo cluster core .",
    "the brightest pn in sample `` c '' is @xmath112  mag brighter than the value of @xmath41 in m87 .",
    "this implies that the virgo cluster _",
    "_ extends at least 2.1  mpc in depth .",
    "furthermore , of the five spirals with cepheid measurements , only three are actually projected within the @xmath113 core , and only ngc  4571 ( which has a ground - based cepheid distance of @xmath114  mpc ) shows any evidence of being physically _ in _ the core ( cf .",
    "van der hulst 1987 ) .",
    "thus , the issue of cluster depth can not be neglected .",
    "nevertheless , our pnlf measurements should give a reliable estimate of the distance to the virgo core .",
    "although m87 is offset by about @xmath115 from the center of the cluster s isopleths , and has a radial velocity that is @xmath116  larger than the cluster mean ( binggeli , tammann , & sandage 1987 ) , the galaxy is almost certainly at the center of the cluster s potential .",
    "velocity and positional offsets , such as those observed for m87 , are common in cd galaxies within dynamically young clusters ( bird 1994 ) , and there is good evidence to suggest that virgo is such a cluster .",
    "based on the radial velocities of dwarf galaxies inside the virgo cluster core , binggeli , popescu , & tammann ( 1993 ) have concluded that there is a separate group of galaxies associated with m86 ( ngc  4406 ) that is falling into virgo from the far side of the cluster .",
    "independent confirmation of this hypothesis comes from jacoby , ciardullo , & ford ( 1990 ) , whose pnlf distances place m86 ( radial velocity @xmath117  ) over 1  mpc behind m87 .",
    "if this interpretation is correct , then the masses of m86 and m87 , as derived from their x - ray halos , imply that the peculiar position and velocity of m87 is a direct consequence of the disturbance caused by the infall of m86 and its group ( bhringer 1994 ) .",
    "in fact , the best evidence of m87 s position within the virgo cluster comes from the x - ray data obtained by the _",
    "rosat _ satellite .",
    "the distribution of virgo s intracluster x - ray gas demonstrates quite conclusively that a large portion of the cluster s mass is centered at the position m87 ( bhringer 1994 ) .",
    "this fact , along with the presence of a diffuse cd halo around the galaxy ( cf .",
    "weil , bland - hawthorn , & malin 1997 ) , strongly indicates that m87 is , indeed , at the center of the cluster .",
    "our distance measurement to m87 should therefore be representative of that of the group .",
    "the existence of intracluster planetary nebulae provides us with a new and unique tool for probing the structure of virgo .",
    "for example , huchra ( 1985 , 1988 ) has pointed out that , from isopleths and velocity measurements alone , it is difficult to tell whether or not the central @xmath52 core of virgo is virialized .",
    "evidence for virialization includes the nearly gaussian distribution of velocities for the early - type galaxies , and the excellent agreement between the apparent morphology of the core and distribution of galaxies expected from an isothermal king ( 1962 ) model ; evidence against virialization comes from the positional and velocity offset between the x - ray halo of m87 and the cluster center .",
    "thus , while huchra ( 1988 ) states that the virgo ellipticals form an apparently virialized core , binggeli , tammann , & sandage ( 1987 ) , and binggeli , popescu , & tammann ( 1993 ) argue strongly that the cluster contains significant substructure , even near its center .",
    "the observed planetary nebula luminosity function can help answer this question .",
    "old stellar populations produce planetary nebulae in proportion to the population s total luminosity ( renzini & buzzoni 1986 ; ciardullo 1995 ) .",
    "hence the number of intergalactic pn detected in our survey should reflect the total amount of intracluster luminosity present in our field .",
    "more importantly , since the observed pnlf is formed from a superposition of pnlfs at different distances along the line - of - sight , the precise shape of the observed luminosity function contains information on the cluster s front - to - back morphology .",
    "it is therefore possible to test models of the virgo cluster by comparing the field pnlf of figure  6 with the luminosity distributions expected from different cluster profiles .",
    "figure  8 demonstrates this possibility . in the figure",
    ", we compare the field pnlf of m87 ( sample `` c '' ) with the pnlf expected from an isothermal cluster with a core radius of @xmath118  mpc and a center @xmath119 from the position of our survey field ( binggeli , tammann , & sandage 1987 ) .",
    "it is obvious that the model fails to fit the bright end of the pnlf by many orders of magnitude .",
    "in fact , this result is a general property of all dynamically relaxed cluster profiles : once virialization occurs , the cluster becomes much too condensed to explain the large number of ( presumably ) foreground pn present in the observed pnlf . to come close to producing the requisite number of bright objects ,",
    "the radial profile of the cluster must be shallower .",
    "however , as figure  8 shows , even a uniform density law fails to fit the overall shape of observed pnlf .",
    "consequently , it is likely that the distribution of intergalactic stars in virgo is clumpy , and that the cluster is not virialized .",
    "since planetary nebulae sample the light , it is possible , at least in theory , to use our observations to place a constraint on the fraction of the virgo cluster s dark matter that is in intergalactic stars . in practice , however , three difficulties prevent us from using our data in this manner .",
    "first is the limitation imposed by our narrow - band filter .",
    "the interference filter used for this project was designed to detect the pn associated with m87 , and its 30     fwhm bandpass is ideal for this project ( cf .  figure  1 ) .",
    "however , the virgo cluster core has an observed velocity dispersion of @xmath120  ( binggeli , tammann , & sandage 1987 ) , or @xmath121    at the wavelength of the [ o  iii ] @xmath0 emission line . as a result",
    ", our survey is probably missing a significant number of intracluster planetaries , perhaps as many as 30% .",
    "a second difficulty with the interpretation of our data is that our ccd field is not at a `` typical '' location in the virgo cluster , but is instead centered on m87 .",
    "consequently , the density of intracluster objects in our field is likely to be higher than average .",
    "moreover , we can not exclude the possibility that some of the pn at large galactocentric radii are actually bound to the m87 .",
    "while it may be possible to remove this contribution by extrapolating the luminosity profile of m87 out to large radii , this profile is not very well known ( cf .",
    "weil , bland - hawthorn , & malin 1997 ; graham 1996 ) .",
    "furthermore , any extrapolation would require the extra assumption that m87 s luminosity - specific pn number density does not change with radius .",
    "unfortunately , this quantity has been observed to increase with galactocentric radius in ngc  5128 ( hui 1993 ) and in a composite galaxy formed from eight elliptical galaxies ( ciardullo , jacoby , & feldmeier 1995 ) .",
    "thus , the validity of this assumption is unknown .    by far",
    "the most serious obstacle encountered when trying to use our pn detections to estimate the density of virgo s intracluster stars comes from the finite depth of the cluster and the steeply rising bright - end of the pnlf .",
    "our [ o  iii ] @xmath0 survey reached a limiting magnitude of @xmath2 ; thus , if the distance to the virgo cluster core is @xmath51  mpc and its size is @xmath53  mpc , then our measurements sample the top @xmath122  mag of the pnlf on the front side of the cluster . on the back - side of virgo , however , our [ o  iii ] @xmath0 measurements only go @xmath50  mag down the luminosity function . in terms of equation ( 2 ) , this means that the intracluster luminosity in the foreground of virgo receives @xmath123 times more weight than luminosity on the backside .",
    "if the radial profile of the virgo cluster were smooth , this effect , as well as the others presented above , could be modeled . however , since it is likely that sub - structure is present in the core of virgo , any extrapolation of the results from our one ccd field to the entire cluster is premature .",
    "we have detected 338 planetary nebulae in our new , wide - field survey of m87 and its surrounding halo .",
    "the analysis of the luminosity function of these pn demonstrates that m87 is at a distance of @xmath5  mpc ; this number is in excellent agreement with the earlier pnlf measurement , as well as recent distance determinations from the surface brightness fluctuation method and the globular cluster luminosity function .",
    "the result is , however , in sharp disagreement with the hypothesis of bottinelli ( 1991 ) and tammann ( 1992 ) that pnlf measurements in virgo are biased due to a limited sample size .",
    "our observations of m87 also present strong evidence for the presence of a substantial population of intergalactic stars , which extends over @xmath124  mpc in front of m87 .",
    "the intergalactic stars are , in all likelihood , the explanation for the `` overluminous '' planetaries encountered by jacoby , ciardullo , & ford ( 1990 ) in virgo , but not seen any where else ( jacoby , ciardullo & harris 1996 ) .",
    "the analysis of the intracluster pn luminosity function suggests that the virgo cluster core is not virialized , but is instead dynamically young .",
    "however , the mismatch between the width of our [ o  iii ] @xmath0 filter and the virgo cluster velocity dispersion precludes a definitive statement or a more detailed analysis at the present time .    planetary nebula observations offer a new opportunity for morphological and dynamical studies of nearby clusters . to date , the only way to study intergalactic light in clusters has been through deep surface photometry , and as a result , only a few , very rich , abell clusters have been measured ( cf .",
    "uson , boughn , & kuhn 1991 ; vlchez - gmez , pell , & sanahuja 1994 ) .",
    "planetary nebula observations offer an alternative to these studies , and provide information on both the two and three dimensional structure of the cluster .",
    "moreover , a pn s [ o  iii ] @xmath0 emission line is an excellent target for a radial velocity measurement .",
    "since there are never enough sufficiently bright galaxies in a cluster to fully define the cluster s velocity field , planetary nebulae can provide invaluable data for cluster dynamics .",
    "future [ o  iii ] @xmath0 surveys may therefore allow us to probe the effects of galactic mergers , cluster accretion , and tidal - stripping within several nearby clusters , and enable new investigations into the distribution of dark matter in clusters and of the initial conditions of cluster formation .",

    "<S> we present the results of a wide - field [ o  iii ] @xmath0 survey for planetary nebulae ( pn ) in m87 and its surrounding halo . in all </S>",
    "<S> , we identify 338 pn candidates in a @xmath1 field around the galaxy ; 187 of these objects are in a statistical sample which extends to @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the planetary nebula luminosity function ( pnlf ) of m87 s halo is unlike any pnlf observed to date , with a shape that differs from that of the empirical law at the 99.9% confidence level . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we find that the pnlf of m87 s outer halo differs from that of the galaxy s inner regions at a high degree of certainty ( @xmath3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we show that both these effects are most likely due to the existence of intracluster pn , many of which are foreground to m87 . </S>",
    "<S> these intracluster objects explain the `` overluminous '' [ o  iii ] @xmath0 sources previously identified by jacoby , ciardullo , & ford ( 1990 ) , and present us with a new tool with which to probe the morphological and dynamical properties of the cluster .    by modifying the maximum likelihood procedures of ciardullo ( 1989a ) to take into account the presence of `` field objects , '' and using an assumed m31 distance of 770  kpc ( freedman & madore 1990 ) with a burstein & heiles ( 1984 ) reddening law </S>",
    "<S> , we derive a distance modulus to m87 of @xmath4 ( @xmath5  mpc ) . </S>",
    "<S> this value is in excellent agreement with the previous survey of jacoby , ciardullo , & ford ( 1990 ) and contradicts the assertion of bottinelli ( 1991 ) and tammann ( 1992 ) that the pnlf distance to virgo has been underestimated due to inadequate survey depth . </S>"
