    "recent measurements on the heavy - fermion ( hf ) metal @xmath0 have been performed under the application of both a magnetic field @xmath3 and hydrostatic pressure @xmath2 , with results that have received considerable theoretical analysis @xcite .",
    "measurements of the magnetization @xmath6 at different temperatures @xmath7 reveal that the magnetic susceptibility @xmath8 demonstrates non - fermi liquid ( nfl ) behavior and diverges as @xmath9 , implying that the quasiparticle effective mass @xmath10 diverges as @xmath11 at a quantum critical point ( qcp).@xcite this kind of quantum criticality is commonly attributed to scattering of electrons off quantum critical fluctuations related to a magnetic instability ; yet in a single crystal of @xmath12 , the qcp in question is located well away from a possible magnetic instability , making the nfl phase take place without magnetic criticality .",
    "@xcite additionally , it is observed that the qcp is robust under application of pressure @xmath2 , in that the divergent @xmath7 and @xmath3 dependencies of @xmath13 are conserved and are accompanied by an anomalous @xmath1 dependence of the electrical resistivity @xmath14.@xcite in contrast to resilience of these divergences under pressure , application of even a tiny magnetic field @xmath3 is sufficient to suppress them , leading to landau fermi liquid ( lfl ) behavior at low temperatures @xcite .",
    "thus , among other unusual features , the metal @xmath12 presents challenging theoretical problems : how to reconcile the frailty of its nfl behavior under application of a magnetic field , with the robustness of the nfl phase against application of pressure in zero magnetic field ; how to explain that the paramagnetic nfl phase takes place without magnetic criticality , thus not from quantum critical fluctuations .",
    "to address these challenges within a topological scenario based on the emergence of a fermion condensate ( fc ) , we begin with an examination of the scaling behavior of the thermodynamic functions of this hf compound considered as homogeneous hf liquid @xcite .",
    "we note that the existence of fc has been convincingly demonstrated by purely theoretical and experimental arguments , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the landau functional @xmath15 representing the ground - state energy depends on the quasiparticle momentum distribution @xmath16 . near the fermion - condensation quantum phase transition ( fcqpt ) , the effective mass @xmath10 is governed by the landau equation @xcite @xmath17 here written in terms of the deviation @xmath18 of the quasiparticle distribution from its field - free value under zero pressure . the landau interaction @xmath19 serves to bring the system to the fcqpt point where @xmath20 at @xmath21 . as this occurs ,",
    "the topology of the fermi surface is altered , with the effective mass @xmath10 acquiring temperature and field dependencies such that the proportionalities @xmath22 relating the specific heat ratio @xmath23 and the magnetic susceptibility @xmath13 to @xmath10 persist . approaching the fcqpt , @xmath24 and thus eq",
    ".   becomes homogeneous , i.e. , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , with @xmath27 depending on the analytical properties of @xmath28.@xcite on the ordered side of the fcqpt at @xmath21 , the single - particle spectrum @xmath29 becomes flat in some interval @xmath30 surrounding the fermi surface at @xmath31 , coinciding there with the chemical potential @xmath32 , @xmath33 at the fcqpt the flat interval shrinks , so that @xmath34 , and @xmath29 acquires an inflection point at @xmath31 , with @xmath35 .",
    "another inflection point emerges in the case of a non - analytical landau interaction @xmath28 , instead with @xmath36 at which the effective mass diverges as @xmath37 such specific features of @xmath38 can be used to identify the solutions of eq .   corresponding to different experimental situations .",
    "in particular , the experimental results obtained for @xmath12 show that near qcp at @xmath39 , the magnetization obeys @xcite @xmath40 .",
    "this behavior corresponds to the spectrum @xmath29 given by eq .   with @xmath41 .",
    "at finite @xmath3 and @xmath7 near the fcqpt , the solutions of eq .",
    "determining the @xmath7 and @xmath3 dependencies of @xmath42 can be well approximated by a simple universal interpolating function @xcite .",
    "the interpolation occurs between the lfl ( @xmath43 ) and nfl ( @xmath44 ) regimes separated by the crossover region at which @xmath10 reaches its maximum value @xmath45 at temperature @xmath46 , and represents the universal scaling behavior of @xmath47 here @xmath48 and @xmath49 are fitting parameters , @xmath50 is the normalized temperature , and @xmath51 while @xmath52 it follows from eqs .  , , and that the effective mass exhibits the universal scaling behavior @xmath53 with @xmath54 a constant.@xcite eqs .  , , , and will be used along with eq .   to account for the experimental observations on @xmath12 .",

    "the normalization is implemented by dividing @xmath67 and @xmath68 respectively by the maximum value of @xmath69 and by the value of @xmath70 value the maximum occurs .",

    "it should be kept in mind that several bands simultaneously intersect the fermi surface , so that the hf band never covers the entire fermi surface .",
    "accordingly , it turns out that quasiparticles that do not belong to the hf band make the main contribution to the conductivity .",
