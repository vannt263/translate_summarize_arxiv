    "currently , primordial inflation  @xcite is supposed to be the leading candidate to provide the necessary conditions for the successful big bang cosmology  @xcite .",
    "the simplest model of inflation driven by only a single inflaton field is consistent with most recent observations  @xcite .",
    "it is however expected that , in the context of theories beyond the standard model of particle physics e.g. supersymmetry , there is a number of multiple scalar fields which may contribute to the inflationary dynamics  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we may be able to observationally detect deviations from the predictions of single field models in the near future and to discuss interesting phenomenology , such as isocurvature perturbations and non - gaussianity .",
    "hybrid inflation  @xcite is an interesting realization with two field contents , the usual inflaton field @xmath1 which drives slow - roll inflation and the waterfall field @xmath2 which terminates inflation by triggering an instability , a `` waterfall '' phase transition .",
    "previously , it has been assumed that @xmath2 becomes momentarily massless only at the time of waterfall and very heavy otherwise , and thus does not contribute to the curvature perturbation @xmath3 on large scales : only the quantum fluctuations of @xmath1 contributes to @xmath3 and we can follow the well - known calculations of single field case , with the energy density of the universe being dominated by a non - zero vacuum energy .",
    "this naive picture has been receiving a renewed interest  @xcite with the common qualitative results that the power spectrum of the curvature perturbation induced by the waterfall field is very blue and extremely small on large scales . however , quantitatively it is not clear if they all agree or not . in particular , in ref .",
    "@xcite the @xmath4 formalism , which takes account of fluctuations only on super - horizon scales by construction , was employed to derive the power spectrum , but the approach there was not quantitative enough and hence the dependence on the model parameters was not explicitly presented .    in this note",
    ", we provide another complementary view .",
    "we adopt a few reasonable assumptions on the model parameters and solve the mode functions of @xmath2 in terms of the number of @xmath5-folds analytically . then using the @xmath0 formalism  @xcite we calculate the corresponding @xmath3 induced by @xmath2 explicitly .",
    "the result is consistent with the above references , i.e. the contribution of @xmath2 to the large scale curvature perturbation is totally negligible .",
    "we also clarify the model parameter dependence on the spectrum of the curvature perturbation .",
    "furthermore , we calculate the corresponding bispectrum , which shows its peak at the equilateral limit .",
    "we also compute explicitly the one - point probability distribution function which clearly shows the highly non - gaussian nature of the curvature perturbation .",
    "the outline of this note is as follows . in section  [ sec : solution ] , we find the mode function solution of the waterfall field @xmath2 valid both on super - horizon and sub - horizon scales . in section  [ section : r ] , we calculate the corresponding curvature perturbation @xmath3 induced by @xmath2 using the @xmath0 formalism . in section",
    "[ sec : correlation ] , we present the power spectrum and bispectrum of @xmath3 . in section  [ sec : distribution ] , we show the explicit form of the one - point probability distribution function of @xmath3 and discuss relates issues .",
    "we conclude in section  [ sec : conclusion ] . in appendices , we discuss some technical details . in appendix",
    "[ app : conventional ] , to check the consistency of the @xmath4 formalism with the standard perturbation theory , we give an estimation of the curvature perturbation by using the linear perturbation equation for @xmath3 .",
    "we find a good agreement with our result based on the @xmath4 formalism . in appendix",
    "[ app : subhorizon ] we reconsider the splitting of the super- and sub - horizon modes and compute the average over the horizon scales .",

    "before we begin explicit computations , first of all we make the physical picture clear .",
    "our purpose is to calculate the contribution of the waterfall field @xmath2 to the curvature perturbation @xmath3 .",
    "this is only possible when @xmath2 becomes dynamically relevant .",
    "while @xmath2 is well anchored at its minimum during the phase of slow - roll inflation and hence does not participate in the inflationary dynamics , it controls the physical processes from the moment of waterfall till the end of inflation .",
    "thus , in the context of the @xmath0 formalism , if we can find the evolution of @xmath2 during this phase as a function of the number of @xmath5-folds @xmath6 , it amounts to finding @xmath3 by the geometrical identity @xmath7 .",
    "therefore , our aim in this section is to calculate @xmath8 starting from the moment of waterfall .",
    "we will directly use this result to calculate @xmath3 in the next section .",
    "we consider the potential of the two fields , the inflaton @xmath1 and the waterfall field @xmath2 , as @xmath9 we note that during the most period of inflation of our interest , it is assumed that the vacuum energy @xmath10 dominates so that the hubble parameter is effectively a constant , @xmath11 .",
    "this is a good approximation even after the waterfall phase transition until the last moment of inflation .",
    "the slow - roll and the waterfall conditions are @xmath12 respectively .",
    "the equations of motion are given by @xmath13 where the spatial gradient term for @xmath1 is neglected as usual .",
    "note that before waterfall , @xmath14 , @xmath2 is well anchored at its minimum @xmath15 so it is itself the same as its fluctuation , @xmath16 .",
    "thus we may regard ( [ chieq ] ) as the equation for @xmath17 while @xmath18 , and thus the metric fluctuations are _ relatively _ second order with respect to @xmath17 and does not appear in the equation of motion for @xmath17 .",
    "this situation is closely analogous to the case of false vacuum inflation  @xcite .",
    "the correlation functions also show similar momentum dependence to those produced during false vacuum inflation  @xcite ] , which arises from the vacuum fluctuations . then after the waterfall transition , @xmath17 becomes unstable and @xmath19 starts to grow rapidly , and inflation ends when the inflaton starts to roll fast , which happens when the term @xmath20 exceeds @xmath21 in ( [ phieq ] ) . here",
    "we adopt the mean field approximation , i.e. we replace @xmath20 by its expectation value @xmath22 , which should be valid for the motion of the homogeneous inflaton field @xmath1 .",
    "we also assume that the nonlinear term @xmath23 in ( [ chieq ] ) can be neglected until the end of inflation .",

    "@xmath82 as we will see in the next section , we must require @xmath83 .",
    "the above result ( [ super_initial ] ) implies that all the super - horizon modes have the same amplitude at the moment of waterfall .",
    "the the moment of waterfall will be taken as the `` initial '' time to estimate the contribution of @xmath17 to the curvature perturbation @xmath3 .",
    "for the modes that are still on sub - horizon scales at the time of waterfall , @xmath84 , the wkb solution is valid until @xmath73 . denoting them by a subscript @xmath85 , ( [ wkbsol ] )",
    "readily gives @xmath86 so that at the moment of waterfall @xmath87 this is the `` initial '' amplitude of the sub - horizon modes .",
    "before we move on , we mention that the initial amplitudes of large scale limit ( [ super_initial ] ) and that of small scale limit ( [ sub_initial ] ) do not match at @xmath88 if we extrapolate from both sides , but are different by a suppression factor @xmath89 .",
    "this indicates that in the intermediate regime around @xmath88 these two extreme values are deviating from the limiting values and smoothly connected  @xcite .",
    "in particular , this implies that the sub - horizon modes with @xmath90 have slightly different initial amplitudes from ( [ sub_initial ] ) .",
    "however this will not affect our subsequent discussions because of the phase volume @xmath91 that gives rise to a sharp peak in the spectrum at @xmath92 , as we will see below .",

    "hence this asymptotic form is valid until the end of inflation .",
    "then , plugging ( [ hankel_asymptotic ] ) into ( [ general_sol ] ) , we can find that after waterfall the mode function on super - horizon scales evolves as - folds was found from the airy function solutions in refs .",

    "let us now turn to the small scale modes .",
    "an important point to calculate the evolution of sub - horizon modes is that the end of inflation is determined by the quanta of @xmath2 which become tachyonic right after waterfall  @xcite , and affect the effective mass of @xmath1 in the form @xmath22 .",

    "can be neglected in comparison with @xmath47 at leading order approximation , they satisfy the same equation as the equation for the large scale modes , ( [ chieq3 ] ) .",

    "inverting this relation , we can write the curvature perturbation generated between the moment of phase transition and the end of inflation as @xmath138 this explicitly shows that the spectrum of @xmath3 is determined by the spectrum of @xmath139 .    from the result",

    "see ( [ chifluc_spectrum ] ) for example ) .",
    "assuming that the spectrum has a ultraviolet cutoff at @xmath88 , this implies that @xmath139 also has the same white spectrum , since the convolution of two white spectra is white . thus apart from the amplitude which we will calculate below",
    ", we can already conclude that @xmath145 , so that the spectral index is strongly blue with @xmath146 , indicating that the curvature perturbation is strongly suppressed on large scales .",
    "before we move to the computation of the power spectrum , let us also observe that @xmath3 seems to be _ always _ negative .",
    "this can be also read from ( [ deltapsi_deltan2 ] ) : although @xmath140 may be positive or negative , it appears in the form of a square in ( [ deltapsi_deltan2 ] ) .",
    "so irrespective of the sign of @xmath140 its contribution is always positive .",

    "also we note that the average value of @xmath3 is _ not _ zero , @xmath147 we will consider these issues a little further later .    finally , before closing this section , let us discuss constraints on the model parameters .",

    "of course there is a natural choice for the cutoff in the present case ; @xmath194 , up to which the modes become tachyonic , as advocated in ref .",
    "@xcite . if we are to take this choice , then the resulting amplitude of curvature perturbations will be substantially enhanced , though the qualitative result will not change .",
    "nevertheless , this strong dependence of super - horizon fluctuations on the ultraviolet cutoff deep inside the horizon looks physically strange because it seems to imply the violation of causality .",
    "in fact if this were indeed the case , then we would have a first example in which the @xmath0 formalism fails even for the curvature perturbation on super - horizon scales .",
    "this may be originated from our assumption of the knowledge of the _ entire _ universe beyond the horizon scale in the fourier transformation .",
    "we discuss this point of maintaining causality regarding the horizon scale patches in the inflating universe in appendix  [ app : subhorizon ] , justifying ( [ deltapsisquare ] ) and ( [ mode_integration ] ) which are the very foundation of our computation of the correlation functions .",

    "<S> + we study carefully the contribution of the waterfall field to the curvature perturbation at the end of hybrid inflation . in particular we clarify the parameter dependence analytically under reasonable assumptions on the model parameters . </S>",
    "<S> after calculating the mode function of the waterfall field , we use the @xmath0 formalism and confirm the previously obtained result that the power spectrum is very blue with the index 4 and is absolutely negligible on large scales . </S>",
    "<S> however , we also find that the resulting curvature perturbation is highly non - gaussian and hence we calculate the bispectrum . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the bispectrum is at leading order independent of momentum and exhibits its peak at the equilateral limit , though it is unobservably small on large scales . </S>",
    "<S> we also present the one - point probability distribution function of the curvature perturbation . </S>"
