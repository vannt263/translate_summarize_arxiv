    "the traditional description of elastic fields produced by dislocations is based on the classical theory of linear elasticity",
    ". however the classical dislocation theory breaks down in the dislocation core region .",
    "the elastic fields due to dislocations which are calculated within the theory of elasticity contain singularities at the centre of the dislocation .",
    "this is unfortunate since the dislocation core is an important region in metallic plasticity and dislocations and failure occur because of the high shear stress action in this region . clearly",
    ", such singularities are unphysical and an improved model should eliminate them . on the other hand , in conventional plasticity theory no internal length scale enters the constitutive relations and no size effects are predicted .    a field theory of elastoplasticity is proposed as a means of describing plastic and elastic deformation even in the dislocation core . in this theory",
    "the elementary acts of plastic deformation at the microscopical level are investigated .",
    "in fact , the dislocations are considered as elementary carriers of plasticity . from the field",
    "theoretical point of view , dislocations bring new special degrees of freedom ( e.g. anholonomity ) and their presence leads to a specific response with the dimension of a moment stress . in straightforward manner , a new internal characteristic length scale enters the constitutive relation between the dislocation density tensor and the moment stress tensor .    in this dislocation theory",
    "it turns out that the force stresses , elastic and plastic strains , elastic and plastic distortions and displacement fields due to dislocations contain no singularities and they are finite .",
    "in fact , they vanish at the centre of dislocations .",
    "moreover , the extremum stress and strain occur at a short distance away from the dislocation line .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section  [ elastoplasticity ] , i present the basics of the elastoplastic field theory of dislocations .",
    "the non - singular solutions of straight screw and edge dislocations calculated in the proposed theory of elastoplasticity are considered in section  [ screw ] and [ edge ] , respectively .",
    "section  [ concl ] concludes the paper .",
    "in this section we discuss how the dislocations can be described in the frame of field theory of elastoplasticity .",
    "we shall in particular consider such plastic deformations which originate from the presence of dislocations .    in elastoplasticity",
    "the elastic incompatible distortion is given as  @xcite @xmath0 it is an additive decomposition of the elastic distortion into compatible and purely incompatible distortion .",
    "this decomposition can be justified by the help of the translational gauge theory of defects  @xcite .",
    "the displacement field @xmath1 gives rise to a compatible distortion and the tensor @xmath2 is the proper incompatible part of the distortion .",
    "thus , it is not a formal additive decomposition .",
    "note that the distortion is dimensionless . in elastoplasticity",
    "the linear elastic strain tensor is given by means of the incompatible distortion tensor as @xmath3    the ( symmetric ) force stress is the response quantity ( excitation ) with respect to the strain and is given by the generalized hooke s law for an isotropic medium @xmath4 where @xmath5 , @xmath6 are shear modulus and poisson s ration , respectively .",
    "the ( symmetric ) force stress has to satisfy the force equilibrium condition @xmath7 the skew - symmetric part of the distortion tensor defines the elastic rotation of a dislocation  @xcite @xmath8 the rotation vector gives rise to a rotation gradient ( dewit s bend - twist tensor ) @xmath9    the total strain @xmath10 and distortion @xmath11 are defined in terms of the displacement field @xmath1 .",
    "they must be compatible . in the presence of dislocations , the total strain is not completely elastic , but a part of it is plastic  @xcite so that @xmath12 here @xmath13 is the plastic strain and @xmath14 the plastic distortion which are not derivable from the displacement field when the plastic strain is incompatible . in performing the differentiations of the displacement  @xmath1",
    "we obtain the elastic distortion @xmath15 plus excess terms which we identify with the plastic distortion @xmath14 .",
    "we notice that this decomposition of @xmath16 is close to the green - naghdi decomposition ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "the dislocation density tensor is defined by means of the distortion tensor @xmath17 and @xmath18 physically , the incompatible distortion corresponds to dislocations .",
    "the dislocation density tensor has the dimension of an inverse length .",
    "it is a fundamental quantity in plasticity because the dislocation is the elementary carrier of plasticity .",
    "the usual dislocation density tensor @xmath19 is recovered by ( see also  @xcite ) @xmath20 here the index @xmath21 indicates the direction of the burgers vector , @xmath22 the dislocation line direction .",
    "thus , the diagonal components of @xmath19 represent screw dislocations , the off - diagonal components edge dislocations . in this approach the dislocation density is not given a priori as a delta function .",
    "it follows from the physics of the problem .",
    "( [ torsion2 ] ) and ( [ alpha - ij ] ) justify the identification of @xmath23 with the plastic distortion .",
    "the dislocation density tensor satisfies the translational bianchi identity @xmath24 which means that dislocations do not end inside the medium .",
    "the moment stress which is the response quantity ( excitation ) to the dislocation density is given by ( see  @xcite ) @xmath25 or with @xmath26 @xmath27 obviously , ( [ moment2 ] ) and ( [ moment3 ] ) are ( linear ) constitutive relations between dislocation density and moment stress in an isotropic medium .",
    "the coefficient @xmath28 has the dimension of a force .",
    "the field equation in elastoplasticity for the force stress in an isotropic medium is proposed as the following inhomogeneous helmholtz equation  @xcite @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the stress tensor obtained for the same traction boundary - value problem within the `` classical '' theory of dislocations . in the field theory of elastoplasticity eq .",
    "( [ stress - fe ] ) is obtained from the moment stress equilibrium condition ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "it is important to note that ( [ stress - fe ] ) agrees with the field equation for the stress field in eringen s nonlocal elasticity  @xcite and in gradient elasticity  @xcite .",
    "the factor @xmath31 has the physical dimension of a length and therefore it defines an internal characteristic length ( dislocation length scale ) . using the inverse of the generalized hooke s law and ( [ stress - fe ] )",
    "we obtain an inhomogeneous helmholtz equation for the strain fields ( see  @xcite ) @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the classical strain tensor .",
    "equation  ( [ strain - fe ] ) is similar to the equation for strain of the gradient theory used by gutkin and aifantis  @xcite if we identify @xmath34 with their corresponding gradient coefficient ( see , e.g. , equation  ( 4 ) in  @xcite ) . from the fact that the field equation of the force stress  ( [ stress - fe ] ) has the same form in elastoplastic field theory , strain gradient elasticity and nonlocal elasticity some relations for the corresponding solutions will follow .",
    "we assume that the stress and strain fields at infinity should have the same form for both the classical and elastoplastic field theory .",
    "consider an infinitely long screw dislocation whose dislocation line coincides with the @xmath35-axis of a cartesian coordinate system . due to the symmetry of the problem",
    ", we choose the burgers vector , which is parallel to the dislocation line , in @xmath35-direction : @xmath36 , @xmath37 .",
    "we solve the force stress equilibrium condition  ( [ feq ] ) identically by a so - called stress function ansatz . using the stress function ansatz  @xcite the elastic stress of a volterra screw dislocation , in cartesian coordinates , reads @xmath38 or , in cylindrical coordinates , @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 . here",
    ", @xmath42 is the well - known stress function of elastic torsion , sometimes called prandtl s stress function .",
    "it is given by ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) @xmath43 this is green s function of the two - dimensional potential equation @xmath44 here @xmath45 is the two - dimensional dirac delta function and @xmath46 denotes the two - dimensional laplacian @xmath47 .",
    "obviously , the `` classical '' stress fields are singular at the dislocation line . for the modified stress we make the ansatz @xmath48 where @xmath49 is called the modified prandtl stress function .",
    "substituting the stress functions into ( [ stress - fe ] ) , we get the following inhomogeneous helmholtz equation @xmath50 the solution of the modified stress function of a screw dislocation is given by @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the modified bessel function of the second kind and of order @xmath53 .",
    "consequently , we find the force stresses @xmath54 and in cylindrical coordinates @xmath55 the appearance of the modified bessel function in ( [ t - cart ] ) and ( [ t - cyl ] ) leads to the elimination of classical singularity @xmath56 at the dislocation line . the modified stress field ( [ t - cart ] ) agrees with the stress field calculated by eringen  @xcite within his version of nonlocal elasticity . additionally , it is interesting to note that the stress field  ( [ t - cart ] ) is the same as the one obtained by gutkin and aifantis  @xcite in their version of gradient elasticity .",
    "the stress @xmath57 has its extreme value @xmath58 at @xmath59 , whereas the stress @xmath60 has its extreme value @xmath61 at @xmath62 .",
    "we notice that the extremum stress may be identified with the theoretical shear strength .",
    "the factor @xmath63 should be fitted by comparing predictions of the theory with experimental results . in general",
    ", the parameter @xmath63 can be used to determine the width of a dislocation and the amplitude of the force stress .",
    "let us now calculate the distortion of a screw dislocation . the distortion @xmath15 is given in terms of the stress function @xmath64 where the two functions @xmath65 and @xmath66 are used to express the antisymmetric part of the distortion ( @xmath67}\\equiv \\omega_1 $ ] and @xmath68}\\equiv -\\omega_2 $ ] ) .",
    "eventually , @xmath65 and @xmath66 are determined from the conditions @xmath69 one finds for the distortion tensor of the screw dislocation @xmath70 and for elastic rotation vector @xmath71 the rotation vector is in agreement with the result calculated in the cosserat theory  @xcite .",
    "the incompatible elastic strain reads @xmath72    by means of the distortion tensor  ( [ dist - screw ] ) the effective burgers vector , @xmath73 , for a circular circuit of radius @xmath74 is given by @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the burgers circuit .",
    "it depends on the radius @xmath74 .",
    "in fact , we find @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "this effective burgers vector differs appreciably from the constant value @xmath79 in the core region from @xmath80 up to @xmath81 .",
    "thus , it is suggestive to take @xmath82 as the characteristic length ( dislocation core radius ) .",
    "therefore , in the field theory of elastoplasticity the dislocation has a core in quite natural manner . outside this core region",
    "the burgers vector reaches its constant value .",
    "accordingly , the classical and the elastoplastic solution coincide outside the core region .",
    "if we use the decomposition  ( [ dist2 ] ) of the distortion into the compatible and purely incompatible distortion , the displacement field of a screw dislocation turns out to be ( see also  @xcite ) @xmath83 where @xmath84 is multi - valued .",
    "thus , the proper incompatible part of the distortion is the ( negative ) plastic distortion which is confined in the dislocation core region @xmath85 it fulfils eq .",

    "the plastic strain reads @xmath86    now we are able to calculate the dislocation density by means of the distortion tensor .",

    "stresses caused by the screw dislocation can be expressed in terms of the dislocation density as @xmath90 and @xmath91 accordingly , moment stresses of twisting - type occur at all positions where the dislocation density @xmath92 is non - vanishing . when @xmath88 , the moment stresses vanish .",
    "the far - reaching rotation gradients of a screw dislocation read @xmath93 they are in agreement with the expressions calculated within the theory of cosserat media ( see  @xcite ) .",

    "the stress fields have no artificial singularities at the core and the extremum stress occurs at a short distance away from the dislocation line .",

    "the dislocation densities of straight screw and edge dislocations obtained in elastoplastic field theory agree with eringen s two - dimensional nonlocal modulus ( nonlocal kernel ) used in  @xcite .",
