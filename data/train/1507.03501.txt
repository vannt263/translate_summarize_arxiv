    "+ in random walk theory , the study of convolution powers is of central importance : given an independent sequence of random vectors @xmath17 , all with distribution @xmath0 ( here , @xmath18 ) , @xmath3 is the distribution of the random vector @xmath19 .",
    "equivalently , a probability distribution @xmath0 on @xmath4 gives rise to a random walk whose @xmath2th - step transition kernel @xmath20 is given by @xmath21 for @xmath22 .",
    "for an account of this theory , we encourage the reader to see the wonderful and classic book of f. spitzer @xcite and , for a more modern treatment , the recent book of g. lawler and v. limic @xcite ( see also subsection [ subsec : classicalllt ] ) . in the more general case that @xmath0 takes on complex values ( or just simply takes on both positive and negative values ) , its convolution powers @xmath3",
    "are seen to exhibit rich and disparate behavior , much of which never appears in the probabilistic setting .",
    "given @xmath12 , we are interested in the most basic and fundamental questions that can be asked about its convolution powers . here are four such questions :    a.   [ ques : supremumdecay ] what can be said about the decay of @xmath23 as @xmath24",
    "? b.   [ ques : llt ] is there a simple pointwise description of @xmath25 , analogous to the local ( central ) limit theorem , that can be made for large @xmath2 ?",

    "question is a question about the validity of ( generalized ) local limit theorems and can be restated as follows : under what conditions can the convolution powers @xmath3 be approximated pointwise by a combination ( perhaps a sum ) of appropriately scaled smooth functions called _ attractors _ ?",

    "such estimates , with matching lower bounds on appropriate space - time regions , are in fact valid in a much wider context , see @xcite .",
    "finally , the conservation of mass provides an obvious positive answer to question in the case that @xmath0 is a probability distribution .",
    "+ beyond the probabilistic setting , the study of convolution powers for complex valued functions has centered mainly around two applications , statistical data smoothing procedures and finite difference schemes for numerical solutions to partial differential equations ; the vast majority of the existing theory pertains only to one dimension . in the context of data smoothing , the earliest ( known ) study was motivated by a problem of erastus l. de forest .",
