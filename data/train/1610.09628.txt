    "the origin of cosmic rays and its acceleration mechanism is the most fundamental problem in cosmic ray research .",
    "the relation between dimensions of particle confinement cavity and their energy ( gyro - radius ) indicate cosmic ray source region in broad perspective e.g. heliosphere ( solar ( including anomalous ) cosmic ray ) , galaxy ( galactic cosmic ray ) , and outside galaxy ( extragalactic cosmic ray ) etc .",
    "the present understanding of cosmic ray acceleration and the recent observations have led to a search for sources within the spacial structures e.g. the active galactic nuclei , supernovae remnants , neutron stars etc . could be the possible sources of ultra high energy galactic or extra - galactic cosmic rays .",
    "however , how these sources contribute to cosmic ray acceleration is poorly understood .",
    "fermi first order ( diffusive shock ) and second order ( random collisions with interstellar clouds with characteristic velocity ) acceleration process is considered as the primal cosmic ray acceleration mechanism . besides this , magnetic reconnection ( strong localized electric field )",
    "is also thought to be contributed in cosmic ray acceleration @xcite .",
    "magnetic reconnection is a fundamental process which rearranges the magnetic field - line configuration , i.e. produces magnetic islands / structures@xcite .",
    "further , it is responsible for energy conversion in magnetized astrophysical and laboratory plasmas and contributes in particle acceleration @xcite.to understand the magnetic reconnection process and the corresponding particle acceleration , researchers have hunted for magnetic structures in solar corona and space .",
    "recent numerical simulation suggest that the magnetic islands originate from the dynamical processes of magnetic reconnection and turbulence @xcite .",
    "moreover , observational studies also identified magnetic island formation regions .",
    "the literature suggest that the sun is a natural generator of magnetic islands , e.g. cme .",
    "the regular solar wind interaction produces small scale magnetic islands as well .",
    "the occurrence of magnetic islands also observed near helio - spheric current sheets , magnetopause , earths magnetotail etc .",
    "the magnetic reconnection process of these small - scale islands / flux - ropes give rise to an anti - reconnection electric field that can accelerate charged particles and further leads to merging or contraction of island .",
    "the particle acceleration is also possible through the contraction of islands .",
    "the trapped particles experience multiple reflections from the strongly curved field of contracting island gaining energy during each reflection via either fermi first - order or second - order mechanism @xcite.the supporting evidences for particle acceleration ( from kev to mev energy range ) are observed at various places in interplanetary space ( where the magnetic islands observed ) @xcite .",

    "initially , the arc length of circle is decreasing to minimum and then again increasing with slowly continuous oscillation of the arc - circle plane ( see the circle arc with different color , on - line only ) .",
    "moreover , to estimate the phase difference between @xmath11 and @xmath10 , the top circle arc layer is selected and shown as the sub - figure ( a ) in figure  [ fig:3 ] .",

    "the simulated data is clearly fitted with the observed top circle arc layer data .",
    "this proves that the @xmath11 and @xmath10 are having phase angle @xmath22 .",
    "further , in region 2 of figure  [ fig:1 ] , we have observed @xmath11 and @xmath10 are rotating and finally total imf is oriented along the y - direction .",
    "now , if we assume toroid shape of flux - rope , in which @xmath11 and @xmath10 presents poloidal and toroidal field direction respectively as shown in figure  [ fig:4 ] and the ace spacecraft crossing direction is not parallel to the axis of the flux - rope .",
    "then observations suggest that the different circle arc observed in hodogram are the different layers of flux - rope . from top to inside , at every layer , the poloidal component of magnetic field slowly aligning with the toroidal component .",
    "this can be seen as the oscillation of arc plane in figure  [ fig:3 ] .",
    "finally @xmath11 poloidal component reach to its minimum whereas the total imf of flux - rope is represented by toroidal component i.e. @xmath10 .",
    "this ascribed that the plasma in shock - sheath region minimize their potential energy .",
    "this physical process is known as plasma relaxation ( self - organization of a plasma ) by magnetic reconnection @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig:4 ] ( artistic illustration ) exhibits the updated visualization of icme propagation in interplanetary space .",
    "the icme flux - rope with turbulent shock - sheath is the earlier hypothesis . in this work",
    ", we advances this traditional hypothesis and demonstrate the first in - situ evidence of flux - rope formation other than icme flux - rope in shock - sheath region .",
    "the flux - rope could be originated from the interaction of icme with ambient solar wind or fragmentation of icme flux - rope due to solar wind interaction @xcite .        beside this , the enhancement of cosmic rays flux ( in all observed energy band ) is unambiguously observed in red and blue shaded region of figure  [ fig:1 ] . in addition , in figure [ fig:2 ] , the top right hodogram shows the indication of rotating magnetic island formation and bottom left hodogram demonstrates the signature of magnetic reconnection during respective time .",
    "the enhancement in red shaded region could be understood on the basis of gradual decrease in toroidal and poloidal field strength of flux - rope during corresponding period .",
    "moreover , the enhancement in charged particle flux is generally interpreted as the particle energization i.e. acceleration @xcite .",
    "the simulation studies suggest that the particle acceleration is possible when particle gyro - radius is smaller than the magnetic islands scale length @xcite .",
    "that means the accelerated particle energy range is depends on the dimensions of magnetic island . in present case ,",
    "the dimension of observed magnetic island is estimated approximately @xmath23 using the time duration of magnetic island crossing and average solar wind speed .",
    "the estimated dimension is much higher than the order of cosmic ray ( 1 - 10 gev energy range observed by neutron monitors ) gyro - radius .",
    "therefore , the enhancement in cosmic ray flux in red shaded region also could be the outcome of acceleration through a stochastic repeated reflections ( first - order fermi mechanism ( in the case of compressible contraction ) or a second - order fermi mechanism ( if the contraction is incompressible ) ) from contracting or merging flux - rope @xcite .",
    "however , enhancement in cosmic ray flux in blue shaded region could be ascribed as explicit evidence of cosmic ray acceleration via magnetic reconnection of shock - sheath flux - rope and icme flux - rope .",
    "a charged particle acceleration via contraction and/or merging of magnetic islands through magnetic reconnection is observationally evident in kev to mev energy range and strongly supported by numerical simulations .",
    "the present work extend this accelerating process to gev energy range charged particles i.e. cosmic rays .",
    "on the basis of dimensional argument including field strength inside the magnetic island and the particle energy , we propose that the same processes should contribute significantly in high energy and/or ultra - high energy cosmic ray acceleration .",
    "this further imply that not only the active core region but also transient disturbances in the spatially extended region of active core - region are responsible for cosmic ray acceleration .",
    "for example , after supernova expansion , the hot thermal material generates shocks into the undisturbed interstellar medium @xcite .",
    "this physical scenario is similar to the icme shock in heliosphere .",
    "the transient disturbances could give rise to turbulent and dynamic conditions leads to magnetic islands formation .",
    "moreover , the interactions of these magnetic structures through magnetic reconnection induce merging and contraction of islands , ultimately contributes to the charge particle ( cosmic ray ) acceleration . in summary , we conclude that the cosmic rays acceleration by fermi mechanism is valid not only through stochastic reflections of particles from the shock boundaries but also through merging and/or contraction of magnetic islands via magnetic reconnection .",
    "this may provide some insight into the origin of ultra - high energy cosmic rays .",
    "the ultra - high energy cosmic rays may not be one - step process but a multi - step one .",
    "the region responsible for final acceleration may be thought of as the origin of these ultra - high energy cosmic rays . .",
