    "in this paper we give an explicit construction of a symplectic lefschetz fibration whose total space is a smooth compact four dimensional manifold with a prescribed fundamental group .",
    "the existence of such a fibration is also a consequence of the remarkable recent work of donaldson @xcite ( see also @xcite ) who proved the existence of a lefschetz pencil structure on any symplectic 4-manifold and the results of gompf @xcite , who proved that any finitely presentable group can be realized as the fundamental group of a symplectic 4-manifold .    since donaldson s proof is non - constructive , as an alternative we present a direct purely topological construction of symplectic lefschetz fibrations which is effective and allows an explicit control on the number of singular fibers .",
    "the construction is based on an algebraic geometric method for creating positive relations among right handed dehn twists .",
    "the ubiquity of such relations combined with a simple group theoretic characterization of symplectic lefschetz fibrations due to gompf ( see proposition  [ p : direct ] ) turns out to be sufficient for the construction .",

    "in general it is expected that every smooth four - dimensional manifold is diffeomorphic to an achiral lefschetz fibration possibly after some stabilization .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to study what other conditions besides chirality determine the slf among all fibrations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section two",
    "we give some preliminaries on subgroups of mapping class groups generated by dehn twists and recall an important result of gompf which characterizes symplectic lefschetz fibrations via their monodromy representations .",
    "in section three we explain the general construction and prove theorems [ main ] and [ thm - high ] . in section four we give an explicit example of a symplectic lefschetz fibration of genus three riemann surfaces whose total space has first betti number one and a different construction of a lefschetz fibration whose total space has a fundamental group isomorphic @xmath29 .",
    "all this demonstrates the flexibility of the construction for obtaining interesting examples .",
    "the second construction is similar in spirit to a computation done by donaldson in which he has represented thurston s example as a symplectic lefschetz fibration of genus three riemann surfaces .",
    "a whole series of examples of the same flavor was constructed independently in @xcite and @xcite .    in the last section",
    "we apply the group theoretic part of the construction to the study of the numerical properties of sections in symplectic lefschetz fibrations .",

    "on the other hand since the geometric monodromy of @xmath12 is contained in the torelli group it follows that @xmath1121 for all smooth fibers @xmath1122 of @xmath12 .",
    "in particular @xmath1123 and so @xmath1124 must be a symplectomorphism .",
    "this shows that the natural map @xmath1125 is a symplectic isomorphism in the complement of all @xmath1113 spheres .",
