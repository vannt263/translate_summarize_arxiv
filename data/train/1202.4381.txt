    "the notorious complexity of the yang - mills vacuum manifests itself in emergent infrared phenomena which , despite vigorous theoretical efforts over the last decades , remain only fragmentarily understood .",
    "quark confinement @xcite was early recognized as a paradigm for these infrared complexities , both because of its unprecedented nature and of its almost universal impact on the hadronic world .",
    "the long struggle to explain the nonperturbative confinement mechanism has led to the development and often ongoing refinement of a wide variety of theoretical approaches @xcite , ranging from various vacuum models to ab - initio lattice simulations wil74etc .",
    "the latter , in particular , have provided strong and unbiased evidence for the main signatures of quark confinement , i.e. the linear growth ( and saturation ) of the static quark - antiquark potential at large distances and the associated color flux - tube formation @xcite ( and breaking @xcite ) .    beyond establishing confinement and its characteristics , intense efforts were devoted to pinning down the underlying dynamical mechanism and to identify the infrared degrees of freedom best suited to describe it in humanly fathomable terms .",
    "vacuum  model analyses have played a prominent and often pioneering role in this endeavor .",
    "the majority of them is based on ensembles of specific constituentfields , i.e. at least partly localized  gauge fields ( with their prospective monopole loop and center vortex content ) which are supposed to populate and disorder the yang - mills vacuum .",
    "potential candidates for these building blocks can be classified according to the increasing number of spacetime dimensions in which they are localized , and thus equivalently to their increasing efficiency in disordering the vacuum .",
    "the minimally , i.e. in just two dimensions localized candidates are center vortices @xcite . an intermediate position occupy both ( gauge - projected ) abelian che97,tho76 and non - abelian monopoles or dyons @xcite ( possibly in the guise of bps constituents @xcite of kvbll calorons @xcite , see below ) which are localized in the three spacial dimensions .    among the maximally , i.e. in all four ( euclidean ) spacetime dimensions localized candidates for the building blocks of confining field configurations , finally , are regular - gauge instantons @xcite , calorons with nontrivial @xcite holonomy and merons dea76,len04,len08 .",
    "all of these pseudoparticles  carry a nontrivial topological charge , mediate vacuum tunneling events and solve the classical yang - mills equation .",
    "the latter property , in particular , has raised hopes that at least one of these solutions may provide a basis for semiclassical and therefore potentially analytical treatments of confinement .",
    "( this proved indeed possible in lower - dimensional models where instantons or vortices were shown to generate confinement at weak coupling @xcite . ) in classically scale - invariant , four - dimensional yang - mills theory , however , where one is inevitably faced with large couplings at large distances , the justification for semiclassical approximations depends crucially on the characteristic distance scales involved . a successful semiclassical description of confinement , in particular , would require all physically relevant confinement effects ( as , for example , the quark binding inside light hadrons ) to take place over distances which remain small enough to  avoid the strong - coupling regime .",
    "in order to overcome these potentially stymying limitations , one may resort to simulating fully interacting pseudoparticle ensembles numerically .",
    "the first and still most extensive such calculations were based on rather dilute  superpositions of instantons and anti - instantons in singular gauge @xcite .",
    "such superpositions maintain part of the instantons semiclassical nature , are known to generate a variety of  important physical effects including spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking , and describe a large amount of successful vacuum and hadron phenomenology @xcite .",
    "however , they fail to generate a confining , i.e. linearly growing potential between static quarks @xcite . by now , numerical simulations were performed for superpositions of all the other above - mentioned pseudoparticle candidates as well .",
    "a central result was that each of them proved capable of generating a finite string tension .",
    "the discovery of new finite - temperature instantons  @xcite has given renewed impetus to semiclassically inspired confinement models .",
    "these generalized calorons contain @xmath1 self - dual monopole ( dyon ) constituents without classical interactions and carry a non - trivial holonomy as an explicit degree of freedom .",
    "the ability of the calorons to separate into @xmath1 quasi - independent constituents ( without cost in action ) in the confinement phase has led to simulations @xcite where the separation appears as an additional ( internal ) degree of freedom compared to the old - fashioned  instanton simulations .",
    "encouraging results have been obtained .",
    "later , an analytic solution for the caloron - dyon gas was proposed @xcite at the price of a non - positive weight of an overwhelming multitude of configurations with respect to the moduli metric @xcite .",
    "an analytic as well as numerical treatment of the purely abelian non - interacting dyon gas was shown to provide a confining force bru11 .",
    "in addition , equilibrated lattice gauge - field configurations were successfully searched for the presence of pseudoparticles ( with the notable exception of merons ) in the yang - mills vacuum .",
    "such searches are typically performed by smoothing techniques designed to filter out infrared gluon fields and in particular solutions of the classical yang - mills equation . for examples in the most extensively studied case of instantons and their size distribution",
    "@xcite , and for calorons with nontrivial holonomy refs .",
    "@xcite .    in the present paper ,",
    "building upon the above developments , we are going to introduce and study a new type of pseudoparticle ensemble .",
    "the latter is based on superpositions of dimerons and anti - dimerons ( in singular gauge ) , i.e. on those four - dimensionally localized solutions of the classical su@xmath2 yang - mills equation which contain two meron centers dea76 .",
    "the relatively large dimeron solution family includes as one extreme members which are contracted to ( singular - gauge ) instantons and as another members which are dissociated into two far separated merons .",
    "moreover , it contains continuous sets of dimeron fields which interpolate between these extremes .",
    "hence our configuration space includes many of the previously studied singular - gauge instanton  and single - meron configurations and is ideally suited to study transitions between instanton and meron ensembles .",
    "this is a crucial advantage because such a transition process was conjectured to take place between the instanton , dimeron and meron components of the yang - mills vacuum as a function of the bare gauge coupling .",
    "indeed , this transition is a central ingredient of the meron - induced confinement scenario which was put forward on the basis of qualitative arguments by callan , dashen and gross ( cdg ) @xcite ( and further explored in several promising directions , including e.g. a two - phase picture of hadron structure @xcite which recieved some support from lattice simulations @xcite ) .",
    "( for more recent work on merons see refs .",
    "an alternative meron confinement mechanism was suggested in refs . @xcite . )",
    "the cdg confinement scenario was inspired by the already mentioned weak - coupling confinement mechanism in 2 + 1 dimensional yang - mills - higgs theory @xcite .",
    "in contrast to this classic paradigm , however , even the ingenious use of semiclassical arguments turned out to be of limited use in 3 + 1 dimensional yang - mills theory .",
    "in fact , the resulting estimates remained qualitative at best .",
    "further progress was achieved only recently , when a numerical study of superpositions of merons and antimerons @xcite provided the first convincing support for a central assumption of the cdg scenario , namely that the meron component of the yang - mills vacuum may indeed confine , i.e. generate a static quark potential which rises linearly at large interquark separations .",
    "the suggested origin of the meron population in the vacuum from dimeron dissociation remained obscure , on the other hand , since the field content was from the outset restricted to a purely meronic phase .",
    "to search for the  development of such a meron - dominated phase and to analyze the underlying mechanism in dimeron - antidimeron ensembles evolving under the yang - mills dynamics will therefore be important points on our agenda . for this purpose , and in contrast to previous simulations of pseudoparticle ensembles",
    ", we will monitor pertinent vacuum properties in a wide range of gauge coupling values .",
    "in particular , we will look for signatures of the envisioned dimeron dissociation process .",
    "similar to the gradual break - up of molecules into their atomic constituents with increasing temperature , this dissociation is suggested to be driven by a competition between the decreasing attraction among the dimeron s regularized meron centers and the entropy gain from their increasingly distant positions .",
    "guided by the behavior of an ideal dimeron gas , one may indeed roughly estimate the inter - meron attraction to decrease relative to the entropy with growing coupling . in view of the strong interactions anticipated especially between the meron centers of different dimerons in significantly dissociated ensembles , however , such estimates are unreliable .",
    "moreover , in our dynamical context the coupling - dependent competition between energy and entropy is particularly subtle since both attraction and entropy are expected to depend only logarithmically on the intermeron separation .",
    "this further impedes even qualitative analytical estimates of dimeron ensemble properties .",
    "our fully interacting ensembles , on the other hand , are well suited to tackle and clarify these issues .",
    "since they take all classical gauge interactions  including those which may be strong , long - range or many - body  between the dimerons into account , we do not have to rely on the semiclassical or any other weak - coupling or low - density approximation .",
    "nevertheless , it will be of heuristic value and of help for future , possibly more analytic treatments to understand which aspects of the dimeron - ensemble dynamics may be described semiclassically .",
    "in fact , one of our reasons for transforming the individual dimerons into a singular gauge was to provide additional insight into this issue by more strongly localizing them .",
    "this allows the dimerons and their meron centers to retain their identities and their classical shapes to a larger extent , even in the presence of quantum fluctuations , and thus facilitates ( semi-)classical behavior . at several points during the course of our investigation we will therefore check for indications of such behavior",
    "besides studying the dimeron dissociation process and its dynamics in detail , we will also survey other structural and topological  properties of the ensemble configurations .",
    "in particular , we will examine distributions and correlations of the topological charge carriers and search for ordering tendencies with respect to both dimeron and meron centers .",
    "( a side benefit for investigating topology distributions is that dimerons , in contrast to e.g. center vortices and monopoles @xcite , carry the topological charge of the yang - mills gauge group directly . )",
    "this will result in a more detailed understanding of the restructuring processes which accompany the transition to the strong - coupling regime .",
    "we will pay particular attention to the behavior of the topological susceptibility and of confinement properties , which we monitor by evaluating wilson - loop expectation values and the associated string tension , as a function of the bare coupling .",
    "the quantitative picture emerging from these investigations will reveal , in particular , at which stage of dissociation ( as quantified e.g. by the average separation of the dimerons meron partners ) dimeron ensembles can best describe the confining phase of the yang - mills vacuum .    in the next section",
    "we start by acquainting the reader with pertinent properties of the dimeron solutions , transform them into a singular gauge and discuss the regularization of their singularities .",
    "we then set up our ensemble field configurations and write down their partition function .",
    "section [ simul ] presents an outline of our simulation strategy and , in particular , of the measures taken to control systematic finite - size and discretization errors . the next and central sec .",
    "[ ressec ] contains our results and their discussion .",
    "we start with an extensive statistical analysis of the spacetime , topological - charge and color structure of the ensemble configurations as well as of the crucial dimeron dissociation process .",
    "these investigations provide a broad spectrum of insights into the behavior of the dimeron ensemble and its phase structure as a function of the gauge coupling .",
    "they furthermore relate this behavior to the changes in the average properties of the individual dimerons .",
    "we then evaluate the topological susceptibility and the static quark potential ( based on the calculation of wilson - loop expectation values ) and analyze the results in relation to the coupling - dependent restructuring of the ensemble configurations .",
    "we further discuss scale - setting issues , evaluate dimensionless observable ratios , rewrite our results in physical units and confront them with those of other approaches .",
    "section [ sum ] , finally , contains a summary of our main findings and presents our conclusions .",
    "in the following subsections we construct the ( continuum ) dimeron field - configuration space on which our study will be based . along the way , we will motivate our expectation that such dimeron configurations approximate crucial features of the gauge - field population in the yang - mills vacuum , and in particular that they may provide a decent description of the confinement - deconfinement transition with decreasing gauge coupling .",
    "we start by deriving the building blocks of our fields , i.e. the individual dimeron solutions of the yang - mills equation in singular gauge , and discuss their collective coordinates .",
    "we then superpose these solutions to define our gauge - field configuration space and write down the partition function which specifies its dynamics .",
    "finally , we discuss the ( both gauge - dependent and -independent ) singularities of our configurations and introduce suitable regularization procedures to prepare for their numerical treatment in sec .

    "the unitary matrices @xmath13 are global su@xmath14 color rotations .",
    "the dimerons ( [ dimreg ] ) carry the same topological charge as instantons , i.e. @xmath15 . the anti - dimeron @xmath16 with opposite topological charge @xmath17 is obtained from eq .",
    "( [ dimreg ] ) by replacing @xmath18 .",
    "in contrast to instantons , however , dimerons are not selfdual .",
    "the solution class ( [ dimreg ] ) depends on eleven real and continuous collective coordinates  or moduli  whose values uniquely and completely specify each member .",
    "eight of these parameters , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , determine the spacetime position and orientation of the dimeron while the remaining three determine the su@xmath0 group elements @xmath21 .",

    "it is instructive to consider several limits of the solution family ( dimreg ) . for @xmath23",

    "although these merons maintain the fixed relative color orientation of eq .",
    "( [ dimreg ] ) , changing it by hand will yield increasingly action - degenerate two - meron solutions when the inter - meron separation @xmath25 becomes large .",
    "this is because the color - dependent attraction which locks the meron constituents of eq .",
    "( [ dimreg ] ) into their rigid color orientation decreases with increasing @xmath25 .",
    "hence both instantons and merons are contained in the solution class ( [ dimreg ] ) as limiting cases .",
    "the fields ( [ dimreg ] ) therefore provide on - shell interpolations between instantons and isolated meron pairs , i.e. continuous paths in yang - mills solution space which connect these particular gauge fields . in our context",
    "these paths are of particular interest since they provide preferred doorways along which the dimerons may dissociate into merons .",
    "as already mentioned , such dissociation processes are conjectured to drive the deconfinement - confinement transition .",
    "the solutions ( [ dimreg ] ) have the same @xmath26 behavior as an instanton in regular gauge bel75,col80,vai99 , i.e. they contain a long - distance tail @xmath27 @xmath28 which implies an exceptionally weak localization . in multi - dimeron configurations these tails generate strong overlap interactions between the individual dimerons .",
    "building dimeron ensembles by superposing solutions of the type ( [ dimreg ] ) would thus lead to very strongly correlated systems , in some respects similar to the regular - gauge instanton ensembles studied in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the present work",
    "we will take a different route , however .",
    "in contrast to merons , dimerons  like instantons  may be transformed to singular gauges in which they are more strongly localized , with their long - range tails decaying as @xmath29 .",
    "a superposition of singular - gauge dimerons thus improves the vacuum description at short distances , compared to superpositions of either regular - gauge instantons or single merons .",
    "as long as the characteristic dimeron size is small compared to the average inter - dimeron separation , furthermore , it will provide much better approximations to classical yang - mills solutions .",
    "this is essentially because at moderate pseudoparticle densities the contribution of the overlap regions to the action is much smaller than in regular - gauge dimeron superpositions .",
    "hence singular - gauge multi - dimeron configurations provide a privileged testing ground especially for the semiclassical features of the cdg confinement mechanism @xcite .",
    "in addition , dimeron configurations in singular gauge may also describe less classical or even fully quantum - mechanical aspects of confinement .",
    "this holds , in particular , for the vacuum disordering mechanism envisioned by cdg .",
    "the latter relies on the long - distance tails of the individual merons which come into play when the separation @xmath25 between the meron centers of the dimerons becomes large . as discussed above ,",
    "the partner merons are then practically independent and regain their long - range tail @xmath28 ( at least in isolation ) .",
    "the ensuing long - distance color correlations among these merons were found in refs .",
    "len04,len08 to be far from semi - classical and to generate confinement .",
    "of course , a complete dimeron dissociation into isolated and thus far separated merons is impossible in the finite spacetime volumes in which numerical simulations are feasible .",
    "( the same holds for the solution in which one of the merons delocalizes on the three - sphere at spacetime infinity dea76,cal78 .",
    ") however , such isolated merons would anyhow be unphysical ( since they carry infinite action ) and incompatible with a finite dimeron density .",
    "instead , one expects that beyond some typical separation the two meron centers of a dimeron experience stronger interactions with their individual field environment than with their partner .",
    "the rigid link between their color orientations can then be broken , i.e. the partner merons can become effectively independent of each other .    in order to construct the multi - dimeron configurations motivated above",

    "the three additional coordinates arise from the more complex structure of extended ( i.e. @xmath60 ) dimerons which requires more degrees of freedom to locate and orient them in spacetime .",
    "this results in a substantially larger position entropy   @xcite which is instrumental in counterbalancing the ( regularized ) dimeron  action which grows logarithmically with @xmath61 .",
    "indeed , the larger entropy is a necessary ( but not sufficient ) requirement for dimerons to dissociate with increasing coupling @xmath62 and to finally split up into their meron partners .",
    "as motivated above , we intend to study a model which drastically reduces the field content of yang - mills theory ( as integrated over in amplitudes and the partition function ) to superpositions of @xmath63 dimerons and @xmath64 @xmath63 antidimerons in singular gauge , i.e. @xmath65with @xmath66 @xmath67 .",
    "each term in this sum is uniquely characterized by the set @xmath68 of collective coordinates of the corresponding ( anti- ) dimeron .",

    "as in the case of instantons , however , the bogomolnyi - type bound @xmath71 on the action @xcite implies that such multi-(anti)-meron contributions to the partition function are exponentially suppressed relative to the dimeron contributions .",
    "seem to be known analytically . ] since the entropy increases only logarithmically with @xmath69 and thus can not compensate this suppression , such multi - meron contributions may be safely neglected .",
    "nevertheless , the ansatz ( [ cf ] ) should be regarded as a rather minimal choice .",
    "it is mainly geared towards a transparent study of the proposed ( instanton and ) dimeron dissociation mechanism and its role in the deconfinement - confinement transition @xcite .",
    "hence there are several natural directions in which eq .",
    "( [ cf ] ) may be extended in future studies to provide a more complete description of the yang - mills vacuum physics .",
    "an example would be to add the meron - antimeron pair solutions @xcite of the yang - mills equations , again individually transformed into singular gauge .",
    "this would maintain the approximately semiclassical nature of the configurations at small @xmath72 and yield a richer dynamics .",
    "however , it would probably also lead to a less transparent interpretation of the results , and we do not expect the topologically trivial meron - antimeron pair configurations to provide qualitatively new insights into the transition behavior . indeed , their limits for @xmath73 , a pure - gauge field of zero action , and for @xmath24 , a meron and an independent antimeron , indicate that meron - antimeron pairs do not generate new pathways for the transition .",
    "more promising improvement options would include generalizations of the dimeron superposition ansatz ( [ cf ] ) which allow for a complete transition into a meron ensemble ( e.g. by releasing the rigid color locking between the dimerons meron partners beyond a suitable intermeron separation @xmath74 ) or the admixture of a pure instanton component @xcite with a realistic size distribution @xcite .",

    "an improved alternative may include jacobians which arise from the transformation of the linear gauge - field measure @xmath83 into the collective - coordinate basis and thereby implement the full moduli - space metric . finally , an additional @xmath84 dependence of the measure can emerge from the trace anomaly cal78,cal279 .",
    "the singular - gauge dimeron solutions ( [ gmsing ] ) contain two types of singularities .",

    "this ceases to be the case for the superpositions ( [ cf ] ) , however , where the location of the gauge singularities varies with the positions of the pseudoparticles .",
    "since both types of singularities would impede our numerical simulations , they have to be regularized in a physically acceptable manner .",
    "( recall that the individual dimeron fields ( [ dimreg ] ) and ( [ gmsing ] ) do not solve the yang - mills equation at their singularities , so that a suitably localized regulator will only minimally affect the semiclassical properties of the configurations ( [ cf ] ) . ) a natural way to regularize the singularities at the meron centers is to add the square of a size  parameter @xmath86 to the denominators @xmath87 in eqs .",

    "the latter arises because a substantial part of the action density of dimerons near the boundary is located outside the ensemble volume and thus not accounted for while the compensating tails of outside dimerons reaching into the ensemble volume are neglected .",
    "we approximately remove this artefact by surrounding the ensemble box with another , covering  volume which extends beyond the ensemble box by 10% of the core size in each direction . to keep the additional computational costs under control ,",
    "we decrease the grid - point density of the outermost shell ( i.e. the part of the covering volume not shared by the ensemble volume ) inversely with the distance from the ensemble boundary .",
    "since this shell does not contain the rapidly varying fields close to the meron centers , calculating the action in the full covering volume indeed largely prevents the fake attraction to the ensemble boundary ( cf .",

    "hence the instanton - like dimeron component indeed resembles a rather weakly interacting liquid . on the other hand , this raises the question why cooling studies , designed to detect semiclassical solutions in equilibrated lattice configurations , have reported clear evidence for instantons or calorons with non - trivial holonomy but none for dimerons cal - latt , instlat .",
    "closer inspection reveals , however , that these findings are not in conflict with our above scenario .",
    "in fact , the finite - resolution algorithms used to identify these solutions by their shapes may have counted small dimerons as instantons . moreover , under cooling the logarithmic attraction between the dimerons ( smoothed ) meron centers can no longer be counterbalanced by their decreasing entropy . hence the dimerons will shrink and at least partially coalesce into instantons @xcite as which they are identified afterwards .    as established in sec .",
    "[ wlsec ] , the effectively released meron centers of the meron - like dimeron component develop the strong long - range correlations required to generate confinement .",
    "although these color correlations produce a more complex long - distance structure than encountered in fully disordered random ensembles , they still generate enough entropy for a string tension of the physically expected magnitude to develop ( cf .",
    "[ wlsec ] ) .",
    "moreover , it seems likely that our above scenario can be extended to an at least qualitatively realistic description of the qcd vacuum .",
    "the instanton - like component of dimeron ensembles , in particular , should adapt to the presence of light quarks in essentially the same manner as in instanton liquid models .",
    "this is because most instanton effects in the light - quark sector , including the induced quark interactions which spontaneously break chiral symmetry , originate from the characteristic quark zero - modes arising in the instanton background .",
    "since these zero modes are of topological origin , their existence and bulk properties @xcite are little affected by moderate deformations of the instantons into dimerons .",
    "hence the ensuing phenomenology should be similarly robust under such deformations .",
    "we have studied the extent to which the yang - mills vacuum can be described by restricting its gauge - field content to  superpositions of regularized  su@xmath2  ( anti- ) dimeron solutions .",
    "our set - up and analysis of the corresponding effective theory focused mainly on structural changes in dimeron ensembles as a function of the bare gauge coupling and traced their impact on topological and confinement properties .",
    "the underlying quantum superpositions of dimerons , with their dynamics governed by the yang - mills action , were generated without recourse to weak - coupling or low - density approximations by monte - carlo simulations in a wide range of bare coupling values .",
    "the localization of the individual dimerons was enhanced by transforming them into a singular gauge , which simultaneously improves numerical efficiency , the vacuum description at shorter distances and the compatibility with semiclassically motivated instanton liquid models .",
    "our initial survey of dimeron ensemble properties and their coupling dependence concentrated on the spacial distribution of the dimerons , their local degree of selfduality and their meron substructure . to understand relevant aspects of the underlying inter - dimeron dynamics , we further studied short- and intermediate - range correlations between positions , topological charges and color orientations of neighboring dimerons and of their meron centers .",
    "the resulting structural patterns turned out to be multifaceted and revealing . a strong repulsion up to distances of the meron center sizes",
    "governs the short - range interactions between dimerons of both topological charges and at all couplings . in our",
    "minimally coupled and thus most ordered ensemble , we additionally find a striking ( about sevenfold ) preference for nearest - neighbor dimerons to carry opposite topological charges , indicating a strong intermediate - range attraction ( repulsion ) between dimerons of opposite ( equal ) topological charge . a less pronounced but still significant majority of next - to - nearest neighbors is found to carry identical topological charges .",
    "the resulting short- to mid - range order among the topological charges is reminiscent of debye screening clouds in a plasma .",
    "these ordering patterns can be traced to the dependence of the underlying interactions on the relative color orientations between neighboring dimerons .",
    "ensemble and configuration averages of these color orientations indicate , on the other hand , that in the mean the intermediate - range attraction between neighboring dimerons and anti - dimerons is almost completely compensated by their shorter- and longer - range repulsion and by the ensemble entropy . in any case , with increasing coupling and hence entropy  the observed topological order weakens rather rapidly , together with the underlying color correlations .",
    "the most far - reaching impact of the increasing bare coupling , however , manifests itself in the structural changes which it induces in the individual dimerons .",
    "in particular , we found the first robust evidence , established in fully interacting ensembles , for the dimerons to graduallydissociate into their meron constituents when the coupling grows .",
    "this process is driven by a competition between the coupling - dependent interactions and the entropy .",
    "several complementary pieces of evidence further indicate that  the meron constituents continuously replace the dimerons as the dynamically relevant degrees of freedom . with growing coupling * *  * * the interactions between merons belonging to different dimerons therefore increasingly determine the ensemble properties .",
    "this renders the dimerons meron partners more and more independent ( except for their frozen relative color orientation ) and allows our field configurations to approximate more closely those of meron ensembles .",
    "in particular , however , the changing nature of the dynamically active topological - charge carriers and of their coupling - dependent correlations leaves various revealing imprints on bulk ensemble properties .    among the latter ,",
    "the  topological susceptibility is particularly relevant in our context .",
    "when calculated in a sequence of growing evaluation volumes up to the largest accessible ones , it is found to level off towards the end of the sequence .",
    "this indicates or at least foreshadows the expected saturation of the topological - charge fluctuations in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "moreover , the resulting values of the susceptibility in the intermediate , physical coupling range remain within errors practically constant .",
    "this behavior may be related to the similarly weak temperature dependence of the  topological susceptibility in yang - mills theory below the deconfinement temperature .",
    "our intermediate - coupling results reproduce those of comparable single - meron ensembles rather closely , furthermore , which seems to indicate that ( on average relatively loosely  bound ) meron centers of dimerons and single merons produce topological charge fluctuations of roughly equal strength . on the other hand ,",
    "our results for the topological susceptibility underestimate lattice and instanton ensemble values by about 50% , perhaps due to insufficient saturation in our evaluation volumes and the underlying boundary effects . in any case",
    ", the dimeron ensemble predictions for the susceptibility could be straightforwardly adjusted by increasing the dimeron density .",
    "since the long - range color tails of less bound meron centers disorder the vacuum more strongly , we have payed particular attention to the confinement properties of the dimeron ensembles .",
    "the latter were monitored by evaluating ensemble averages of rectangular wilson loops and by extracting the associated static quark - antiquark potentials for a wide range of coupling values .",
    "initially , the resulting potentials are found to rise quadratically with the interquark separation .",
    "this behavior is typical for ( sufficiently dilute ) instanton ensembles and indicates that our short - distance potentials are dominated by contributions from moderately dissociated dimerons which act essentially as singular - gauge instantons . for quark - antiquark separations beyond about half a fermi ,",
    "on the other hand , the wilson loops indeed develop an area - law behavior and the potentials consequently show the linear distance dependence characteristic of quark confinement .",
    "the associated string tension is found to grow with the coupling and to reach values of the experimentally expected order of the magnitude in the physical coupling range .",
    "hence we have shown  without reliance on weak - coupling or low - density approximations  that sufficiently strongly coupled and therefore on average far enough dissociated dimeron ensembles indeed produce confining long - range correlations of about the physically required strength . since the latter originate from the meron tails of the more strongly dissociated dimerons , these results also provide complementary evidence for single - meron ensembles to confine ( even though our finite simulation volume and our limited field configuration space prevent the dimerons from breaking up completely ) . moreover ,",
    "both dimeron and single - meron ensembles are found to generate confining static - quark potentials of comparable strengths at our largest accessible interquark distances .",
    "since the linear rise of the meron - induced potential turns out to continue beyond these distances , furthermore , our above reasoning indicates that the same should happen in dimeron ensembles .",
    "hence we expect an ongoing linear rise of the dimeron - induced potentials into the distance region where the underlying color flux tubes are fully developed .",
    "while dimeron ensembles thus share with single - meron ensembles the main features of the  confinement mechanism , they additionally provide a more complete description of the yang - mills vacuum .",
    "the first evidence is that our results establish how a confining meron component in the vacuum can robustly emerge from instanton and dimeron dissociation .",
    "this provides , in particular , the first quantitative confirmation for a key ingredient of the meron - induced confinement scenario envisioned more than three decades ago on the basis of qualitative arguments .",
    "in addition , our results on the coupling dependence of dimeron ensemble properties should contain useful information on their temperature dependence and , in particular , on the impact of temperature - induced variations of the gauge coupling ( although we did not pursue this issue in the present paper ) .    furthermore , we found evidence for the physical dimeron density to be about twice as large as typical instanton densities .",
    "this allows confining dimeron ensembles to retain a phenomenologically relevant fraction of contracted and thus more weakly interacting , instanton - like  dimerons .",
    "an independent indication for their considerable density is the strong quadratic rise of our heavy - quark potentials at short interquark distances .",
    "the instanton - like component should adapt to the presence of light quarks in essentially the same fashion as in phenomenologically successful instanton vacuum models , furthermore , since the underlying quark zero - modes in the instanton background are of topological origin and therefore little affected by the moderate deformations of instantons into contracted dimerons .",
    "hence , in addition to confining color , dimeron ensembles should be able to reproduce much of the successful vacuum and hadron phenomenology predicted by ( non - confining ) singular - gauge instanton ensembles .",
