    "the recent discovery of the fe - based superconductors has proved that superconductivity and ferromagnetism may coexists with the consequent changes on the electronic pair formation , different to the electron - phonon type described by the bcs theory @xcite .",
    "the new type of superconducting materials opens other possibilities for the electron pairing and the perspectives to explore different processes on superconducting compounds with magnetic elements , for instances the recent results by nakayama et al .",
    ", in @xmath1 film with k doping , discovered that the cross - interfacial electron - phonon coupling was not the primary interaction for the superconducting pairing @xcite .",
    "the superconducting family of compounds with fe and chalcogenides , i.e. , @xmath2 has a simple crystal structure known as the anti - pbo , with @xmath3 symmetry @xcite .",
    "physical modifications on these structures , particularly on the fe - se bonds give place to other superconducting compounds with different transition temperatures @xcite .",
    "yeh , et al . , have investigated that the transition temperature in these compounds changes because the coupling between layers can be modified via chemical and/or external pressures @xcite .",
    "one example of these changes was observed in the @xmath1 @xcite where the transition temperature @xmath4 changes with the internal pressure when selenium is substituted by tellurium resulting the family of @xmath5 . in the particular case of @xmath0",
    "the internal pressure increases the @xmath4 from 8 to 15 k @xcite .",
    "moreover , other manner to produce changes in the electronic and structural properties on these compounds is by applying high pressures by external means .",
    "the tools to produce external pressures are called pressure cells .",
    "the most powerful of these instruments are the diamond pressure cells that are able to produce pressures of the order of hundred of gpa at hydrostatic or quasi - hydrostatics forms . here in this work we used a pressure cell without diamonds that is able to produce in a simple manner hydrostatic pressures at the order of a few mpa .",
    "so , this cell was used to investigate the range not yet studied , of the variations of critical fields and ginzburg - landau parameters at pressures of only a few mpa .",
    "recent pressure studies of the @xmath2 family were focused in the observation of changes on @xmath4 and in its crystal structure . in a report by stemshorn , et al .",
    "@xcite , the authors indicate that the @xmath1 tetragonal structure ( @xmath6 ) was transformed to an hexagonal one ( @xmath7 ) with applied pressure and becoming amorphous at higher pressures .",
    "on the other hand , it was observed that @xmath0 increased its @xmath4 to 26 k at @xmath8 gpa while higher pressures produces structural transitions to a monoclinic symmetry that decreases @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "moreover at @xmath9 gpa the compound changes into an amorphous phase @xcite .",
    "in a recent report pietosa et al . , studied the pressure effects on the critical fields up to 1.04 gpa founding no important variations on the behavior of the @xmath10 , concluding that the observed changes on the upper critical field was related only to changes of @xmath4 @xcite .    in this work we investigated the behavior and changes on the critical fields of @xmath0 under hydrostatic pressures below 900 mpa .",
    "our investigation pointed out that this behavior is almost independent of the variations of @xmath4 the primary objective of this research is to study the behavior on the critical fields , ginzburg - landau parameters and thermodynamic properties at different pressures .",
    "it is important to mention that this superconductor has been scarcely studied under the influence of external pressures below 1 gpa .",
    "other researchers have attributed those changes to variations on the density of the superconducting carriers . however , that analyses by fedor , et al .",

    "daphne pressure oil medium was used because of its lack of magnetic contribution when the temperature decreases @xcite .",
    "the superconducting transition temperatures were determined by magnetic susceptibility with field of 20 oe oriented parallel to the ab - plane in two modes , zero field cooling zfc , and field cooling fc .",

    "demonstrate that the meissner fraction could varies in a non - monotonic way with the pressure .",
    "however we believe that more experimental work will be necessary in order to investigate more about this behavior .",

    "the upper critical field shows a concave upward feature near @xmath4 , see illustration in fig 7 .",

    "note that the slope @xmath55 has different values for each pressure . in some investigations",
    "@xcite , the authors have considered that the increment on the critical fields is caused only by the increment of @xmath4 . our experiments clearly indicate that the critical fields reach the highest value at @xmath56 mpa , instead of 823 mpa , these values are shown in fig . 8 . in order to assure that this behavior is correct , our measurements were repeated at least twice using different samples .

    "we found that some parameters varies in irregular form and present anomalous values .",
    "@xmath46 for instances decreases more than @xmath57 as pressure is applied , and then shows a small increment at higher pressure .",
    "this may implies a considerable increment on the superconducting electronic density .",
    "coherence length also is increased by about @xmath58 at @xmath31 mpa . according to our experiments , and others ,",
    "pressure strongly affect the superconducting parameters and these changes can be attributed not only to increment of @xmath42 but to additional factors , as crystal parameters and structural changes , etc @xcite . in our investigation , we noticed that the @xmath42 , critical fields and superconducting parameter are very sensitive to pressure , being a clear sign that this compound presents unconventional superconductivity @xcite .",
    "magnetic studies under hydrostatic pressure were performed in @xmath0 in order to investigate the impact of pressure on the basic parameters of this superconductor . we found a linear increase of @xmath42 that changes from 14.03 k to 20.5 k , at a rate of 0.0069 k / mpa .",
    "the anomalous behavior of the meissner fraction and superconducting parameters are difficult to explain because those are not directly related to changes of the transition temperature with pressure . as mentioner earlier , the changes in pressure may be associated with @xmath59 interlayer separation @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the dependence of superconducting properties with pressure of this compound implying that microscopic mechanism of the electronic pairing is different of electron - phonon , as it is shown in unconventional superconductors .",
    "other reports on similar studies @xcite , indicate that the increment of the density of electronic states are not enough to explanation the notable increment of the transition temperature .",
    "the presence of a peierls distortion , as a spin density wave , must be decreased by pressure but nevertheless has any influence on the transition temperature , again this is quite anomalous .",
    "lastly , we must mention that still more experiments are necessary in order to completely understand this type of new superconducting materials @xcite .",
