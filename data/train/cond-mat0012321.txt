    "in magnetic semiconductors there are two main mechanisms of the charge carrier self - trapping : magnetic and polaronic .",
    "the former corresponds to trapping of the electron by a microregion of a changed magnetic phase created by this electron .",
    "this effect is most energetically favored in antiferromagnetic semiconductors where the self - trapping occurs in ferromagnetic microregions@xmath0 . on the other hand ,",
    "the magnetic semiconductors are partly polar crystals .",
    "for this reason polaronic effects should exist in them .",
    "the elecron - phonon interaction is not so strong in them as in the completely polar nacl - type crystals , and only it alone can not change the state of the charge carriers drastically . in particular , the small polarons are impossible in the magnetic semiconductors@xmath1 . otherwise , they would not be degenerate at heavy dopings , and the charge carriers would not realize the indirect exchange in them .",
    "but , being added to the magnetic mechanism of the self - trapping , the lattice mechanism can considerably increase the stability of the self - trapped state@xmath2 .    in degenerate antiferromagnetic semiconductors",
    "the magnetic self- trapping is a cooperative phenomenon .",
    "it manifests itself as a phase separation into the highly - conductive ferromagnetic phase and insulating phase as a result of the fact that all the charge carriers concentrate inside the ferromagnetic phase@xmath3 .",
    "both these phases are charged oppositely .",
    "due to the coulomb interaction between them the phase intermixing takes place .",
    "two main types of such intermixing were considered in an isotropic crystal : the droplet one@xmath4 and the slab one@xmath5 . in the former case at relatively low charge carrier densities , droplets of a metallic ferromagnetic phase",
    "arise inside an insulating antiferromagnetic host , with all the charge carriers concentrated inside these droplets . at larger densities",
    ", the highly - conductive ferromagnetic phase occupies the larger part of the volume , and the antiferromagnetic phase is represented by insulating droplets inside it .",
    "the slab structure corresponds to alternating highly - conductive ferromagnetic and insulating antiferromagnetic plane layers . as a particular case",
    ", it includes the stripe structure with the ferromagnetic phase consisting of monolayers which separate the antiferromagnetic slabs .",
    "as is well known , the stripe structrure attracts much attention in connection with the manganites , nickelates , and high @xmath6 superconductors nowadays .    in the pioneering paper [ 5 ]",
    "only very crude estimates of the energy of the slab phase - separated state were carried out .",
    "the electric properties of such a phase - separated state should be highly anisotropic : it should be highly - conductive along the layers and insulating across them for any charge carrier density in the range where the phase separation is realized .",
    "in the subsequent paper [ 6 ] much more accurate calculations were carried for the droplet model .",
    "this model made it possible to explain the transition from the insulating state to the highly - conductive state with increasing charge carrier density as a result of the percolation of the ferro - electronic liquid , i.e. of changing the topology of the ferromagnetic phase from multiply- connected to simply - connected .",
    "such a transition was observed experimentally in euse and in other materials ( see refs .",
    "[ 3,7 ] ) .",
    "the problem of the phase separation becomes again highly actual due to enhanced interest to the manganites .",
    "the coexistence of the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases in them was established very long ago@xmath7 .",
    "there are new experimental data which evidence coexistence of these types of the magnetic ordering ( e.g. , refs .",
    "[ 9 - 16 ] ) .",
    "though sometimes these data were interpreted in terms of the canted antiferromagnetic ordering , one should keep in mind that it is unstable against fluctuations of the charge carrier density@xmath8 . for this reason one can assume that these properties are related to the ferro- antiferromagnetic phase separation .",
    "this makes it necessary to reinvestigate theoretically the phase separation in the degenerate antiferromagnetic semiconductors more accurately .",
    "in particular , it is necessary to find out whether the slab structure is really impossible in them .",
    "the present paper is devoted to this problem . a more general model than in refs .",
    "[ 5,6 ] is used here which takes into account not only the magnetic self - trapping but also the polarization that . for this reason",
    "essentially new results are obtained not only for the slab structures but also for the droplet ones . it will be shown that for some systems , both polarizable and nonpolarizable , the difference in the energies of the slab and droplet structures is so small that it is below the accuracy of the calculation .",
    "hence , one can not state with certainty that the slab structure is impossible in the isotropic antiferromagnetic crystals .",
    "the small difference in the energies assumes that a small force can transform one structure into the other even if the latter is normally unstable .",
    "for example , if normally the droplet structure is stable , a small uniaxial deformation can stabilize the slab structure .    independently of the type of the structure , the lattice polaronic effects can essentially influence the electron - magnetic phase separation making it considerably more stable .",
    "they increase the size of the ferromagnetic regions in both droplet and slab structures . on the other hand",
    ", they increase the density of electrons in the ferromagnetic phase . as a result ,",
    "the total volume of the ferromagnetic phase and the total magnetization of the crystal become decreased .",
    "hence , the electron - lattice interaction , suppressing the ferromagnetic phase , hinders the metal - insulator transition for the droplet geometry and the transition to the uniform ferromagnetic state for both geometries .",
    "especially large is contribution of the polaronic effect in the case when the polaronic attraction between the charge carriers almost compensates the coulomb interaction arising due to the mutual charging of both phases .",
    "if the former exceeds the latter , the phase separation of the types discussed here becomes impossible .",
    "the condition for this the inequality @xmath9 . where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the static and high- frequency dielectric constants , respectively .",
    "but such a situation will not be considered here .",
    "there are antiferromagnetic semiconductors , in which @xmath12 only slightly exceeds @xmath11 , e.g. , euse with @xmath10 = 9.4 and @xmath11 = 5.0 [ 22 ] , so that the investigation of the polaronic effects close the stability boundary is a quite actual problem .",
    "recently some authors expressed the point of view that the purely polaronic phase separation is possible in the manganites without magnetic phase separation ( e. g. , [ 23 ] ) .",
    "this seems hardly possible as such a state would correspond to formation of regions consistsing of the pekar polarons .",
    "but , as is well known , the pekar polarons are impossible for realistic parameter values .",
    "this qualitative consideration was confirmed numerically using the procedure described below .",
    "the situation can be different when the small polarons are more energetically favored than the large polarons .",
    "accordong to ref .",
    "[ 24 ] , the small polaron condensation into a string is possible .",
    "but , as was already mentioned , the small polarons do not exist in the magnetic semiconductors .",
    "it should be noted that other types of the electron - phonon interaction can be essential for certain systems . in ref . [ 25 ] the idea was advanced that the interaction between the electrons and jahn - teller phonons can cause the phase separation in the manganites . but this problem will not discussed here . in ref .

    "26 ] the magnetostriction at the magnetic single - electron self - trapping was investigated . in the present paper the modulation of the lattice due to the interaction of the slab structure with the acoustical phonons will be investigated .",
    "the problem of magnetostriction at the electron self - trapping became actual now due to its experimental discovery [ 27 , 28 ] .",

    "the charge of the latter compensating the charge of the charge carriers is assumed to be distributed uniformly over the sample ( the jellium model ) .",
    "the reason for the magnetoelectronic phase separation in an antiferromagnetic semiconductor is the fact that the charge carrier energy is lower for the ferromagnetic ordering than for the antiferromagnetic that .",
    "if the charge carrier density is insufficient to make the entire crystal ferromagnetic , the charge carriers can concentrate in a portion of the crystal and make it ferromagnetic .    .",

    "such an accurate calculation of @xmath77 will not be carried out for a reason pointed out in the end of this section .",

    "one comes to the expression for @xmath107 .    to determine @xmath108 using the same simplified treatment",
    ", one should note that one can introduce an analogue of the wigner spheres for the slab structure , too .",
    "namely , one can introduce the wigner layers with the total zero charge , consisting of the highly - conductive layer with the @xmath109 coordinates between @xmath110 and @xmath111 and two adjacent insulating half - layers between @xmath112 and @xmath111 and symmetrical one .",
    "for them in the adiabatic approximation ( 22 ) one arrives to an expression for @xmath113 similar to that for @xmath107 . for them",
    "both @xmath114 the question arises about the accuracy of eq ( 23 ) .",
    "one observes that for the slabs one obtains the same expression directly from eqs ( 21 ) , ( 11a ) if the quantities @xmath44 and @xmath43 tend to @xmath115 and to 0 , respectively .",

    "the sum over @xmath94 in eq ( 21 ) becomes equal to @xmath117 where @xmath118 is the riemann zeta - function .",
    "hence , eq ( 23 ) and its analogue are valid for large - scale phase separation with relatively small increase in the density or for very large volumes of the antiferromagnetic phase independenty of the size of the ferromagnetic layers .",
    "as follows from eqs ( 11a , b ) and ( 23 ) , the polaron instability ( @xmath68 + @xmath119 ) should occur for @xmath120    if these conditions are not met , eqs .",
    "( 21 ) and ( 23 ) lead to different results .",
    "for example , if one takes @xmath10 = 5 and @xmath11 = 2.5 , then one obtains by numerical calculations from eqs ( 21 ) and ( 11.a ) : @xmath121 = 1.0008 for @xmath44 = 1 and @xmath122 or for @xmath44 = 1000 and @xmath123 = 1 in agreement with eq ( 23 ) . but",
    "for @xmath124 one obtains a value of 2.4317 for this ratio .",
    "this means that for such a structure the polaronic effects are considerably stronger than for thicker ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic layers . hence , in principle , they can stabilize the stripe structure when the ferromagnetic layers are reduced to monoatomic planes ( the long - rang ferromagnetic ordering is possible in the two - dimensional systems even at @xmath125 due to the magnetic anisotropy ) .    as is seen from eqs ( 23 ) and ( 11a , b ) , in the adiabatic approximation used here the polaronic energy vanishes for the uniform ferromagnetic state ( for the slab structure it follows from the fact that according to eq ( 21 ) @xmath126 for @xmath127 ) .",
    "now we return to the problem of a calculation of the polaronic energy in the manner similar to that leading to eq .",
    "as follows from above - said , such a calculation could be very useful for monoatomic sublattices which are the limiting case for the droplet model .",
    "but such sublattices have nothing in common with the phase separation as single atoms can not form a ferromagnetic phase .",
    "thus , this problem is beyond the framework of the present paper , and for this reason is not considered here . the eq .",
    "( 23 ) is sufficient for the droplet model which assumes that the size of the ferromagnetic droplets is large compared with the lattice constant .",
    "now results of calculations will be presented .",
    "first , it should be noted that a necessary condition for a phase - separated state to be energetically favored consists in the requirement that the energy ( 6 ) be less than the energy of the uniform antiferromagnetic state @xmath128 : @xmath129 @xmath130 the latter equation for the double - exchange system is obtained using an expression for the charge carrier energy in a system with the double exchange , if the @xmath24-spins are quantum [ 3 ] . it should be noted that the term @xmath131 does not disappear for any type of the magnetic ordering playing the part of an additive constant in the case of the double exchange .    according to eq ( 23 ) ,",
    "if one wishes to account for the polaronic effects , in the case of sufficiently large radii @xmath52 or layer thicknesses @xmath44 one can introduce the effective dielectric constant @xmath132 , defined by the relationship @xmath133 in this case one can carry out the minimization of the energies ( 6 - 9a , b ) , ( 11 a , b ) , ( 12 ) with respect to @xmath52 or @xmath44 in an explicit form , and then only the minimization with respect to @xmath43 should be carried numerically . if one interested only in the pure magnetic self - trapping , one should leave eqs ( 11a , b ) as they stand , and if one wishes to take into account the polaronic contribution , one should replace @xmath10 by @xmath132 ( 27 ) in them .    in this case",
    "one can exclude the quantities @xmath52 ot @xmath44 from the expressions ( 6 ) for the energy and make it a function of the only variational parameter @xmath43 .",
    "for the droplets structure with both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic droplets this procedure was carried out in ref . [ 6 ] .",
    "for the slab structure this program was not carried out yet .    for the droplet model , as in eq ( 6 )",
    "only the terms @xmath134 and @xmath135 are @xmath52- dependent , one should replace the sum @xmath136 by its minimal value with respect to @xmath52 : @xmath137^{1/3}(1+x)^{2/9 } \\qquad ( 28)\\ ] ] @xmath138^{1/3}\\ ] ] and substitute the following expression for the radius : @xmath139 } \\right\\}^{1/3 } \\qquad   ( 29)\\ ] ] a similar calculation for the slab structure leads to the expressions @xmath140 @xmath141^{1/3 } \\qquad ( 31)\\ ] ] further calculations should be carried numerically .",
    "now some results of them will be presented .",
    "first , we consider the case when the the system is close to the boundary of the polaron instability .",
    "for this aim the same values of the dielectric constants will be taken as in euse [ 23 ] : @xmath142 , @xmath143 .",
    "as euse is an isotropic metamagnet with a very low critical field of about 2000 oe , a value of @xmath144 = 0.0001 is chosen ( here and below all the typical energies are in the ev units ) .",
    "other quantities are : @xmath28 = 0.2 , @xmath145 = 1.2/7 , @xmath146 = 2.7 , @xmath26 = 7/2 .",
    "not all they coincide with the corresponding quantities in euse though are likely to be close to them .",
    "nevertheless , the inequality @xmath147 is certainly met here , and the energy of the system will be counted off from the expression ( 25 ) .    the results of the calculations are depicted in fig.1 for both droplet and slab structures . here and below the upper indices @xmath148 and @xmath149 will denote the polarizable and rigid lattices , the lower indices @xmath24 and @xmath17 the droplet and slab structures , respectively .",
    "the parameters @xmath150 , @xmath151 , @xmath152 and @xmath153 are presented in fig.1 for the droplet model the calculations are carried only down to the @xmath154 value of 1 , which corresponds to the electronic and ferromagnetic percolation .",
    "calculations of the polaronic effects for @xmath155 should be carried out using another procedure .    as is seen from fig .",
    "1 , the parameters @xmath156 and @xmath157 decrease and hence the ferromagnetic portion of the crystal increases with increasing charge carrier density @xmath50 . respectively , the sizes of the ferromagnetic regions @xmath152 and @xmath153 increase . for the slab structure an abrupt concentration phase transition into the uniform ferromagnetic state takes place though the @xmath154 jump is rather small . as the polaronic contribution to the energy is small at @xmath158 , this effect is not related to the polaronic effect .",
    "a corresponding calculation for the unpolarized droplet model using results of refs [ 3,6 ] shows that the phase separation also disappears abruptly .    comparing numerical results for these two models ,",
    "one should point out that their energies and @xmath154 values are close to each other .",
    "in both cases the energy per conduction electron decreases smoothly with increasing electron density . for the droplet structure",

    "it is interesting to note that the densities corresponding to equal volumes of the antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic phases coincide for both models .",
    "one should compare results obtained with accounting and without accounting for the lattice polarization .",
    "it is advisable to carry out this comparison for the density @xmath50 = 0.00095 corresponding to the percolation threshold in the rigid lattice .",
    "one obtains : for the droplet model in the rigid lattice the energy per electron @xmath163 = - 0.2054 , @xmath164 = 1.0 , @xmath165 = 10 , the number of electrons in the droplet @xmath166 = 8,3 .",

    "obviously , the polarization increases the number of the electrons in each droplet by a factor of 4.75 , whereas its volume is increased only by a factor of 4.1 .",
    "hence , the polarization increases the density of conduction electrons .",
    "the total magnetization of the crystal is proportional to the relative volume of the ferromagnetic phase @xmath171 .",
    "thus , the polarization decreases the total magnetization by about 30 % .",
    "simultaneously , the system is shifted from the percolation threshold to the insulating side .    now these results will be compared with those obtained for the slab model with the same @xmath50 value of 0.00095 . without polarization ,",

    "though , formally , the energy of the slab structure is less than that of the droplet structure , the difference between then amounts only to 0.3 % which is certainly considerably less than the accuracy of the present calculations .",

    "one finds : for a rigid lattice @xmath184 = - 0.0708 with @xmath185 = 1.1 and @xmath174 = 3.44 , for a polarizable lattice @xmath162 = -0.0986 with @xmath157 = 1.3 and @xmath153 = 3.84 .    as is seen from these data , the main regularities established above for the case of the wide bands @xmath147 remain in force for the case of the double exchange .",
    "the difference in the energies of the slab and droplet structures is larger in this double - exchange system case which points to the droplet structure being preferential .",
    "one can also give examples where the situation is opposite .",
    "being unable to predict in some cases which structure should be realized , i would like to point out that just due to this small energy difference a small external force can cause transition of one structure to the other .",
    "for example , if the droplet structure is normally realized then a small uniaxial stress increasing the hopping integral @xmath28 in the corresponding direction can stabilize the slab structure .",
    "it is still necessary to discuss the possibility of the ferromagnetic stripe structure ( @xmath44 = 1 ) .",
    "it is clear that the single layer ferromagnetic phase could be possible only in the double exchange systems since in the opposite case @xmath186 the energy of the two - dimensional motion of the electron is by @xmath187 higher than in the three - dimensional case .",
    "meanwhile , the gain in its energy due to the ferromagnetic ordering is only @xmath131 . on the other hand ,",
    "as was shown in the preceding section , the polaronic effect is enhanced in the structures with alternating ferro- and antiferromagnetic atomic planes .",
    "for this reason one can expect the existence of such structure in the double - exchange systems .",
    "i managed to prove the possibility of such structure in the limit @xmath188 .",
    "the following values of the parameters were used : @xmath189 .",
    "then one finds from eqs ( 6 ) and ( 10 ) that for @xmath190 the system with @xmath153 = 1 is the most energetically favored for @xmath191 ( 3 antiferromagnetic layers per ferromagnetic layer ) . for @xmath192 the most energetically favored structure is @xmath193 with alternating ferro - and antiferromagnetic atomic planes . for small @xmath26 ,",
    "i did not find parameter values at which the stripe structure is most energeticlly favored .",
    "i    it remains only to consider the magnetostiction deformation of a sample in the case of the slab phase separated state .",
    "for this aim one should use eqs ( 20 ) , ( 5b ) yielding the shifts @xmath194 of the operators for the longitudinal acoustical phonons . going over from the phonon operators to the normal",
    "coordinates in the standard manner , one obtains the following expression for their shift @xmath195 : @xmath196 \\qquad ( 32)\\ ] ] where @xmath41 is the mass of the unit cell . using this eq , one obtains for the displacement of the atom * g * along the @xmath109 axis related to the wave with the vector @xmath197 ( 20 ) : @xmath198 @xmath199 as follows from eq ( 33 ) , the lattice becomes modulated not only with the periodicity of the phase - separated structure but also the higher harmonics are present .",
