    "thus , universal behavior is not guarantied .        where @xmath236 is the two - body wave function decreasing as @xmath237 at infinity , the constants @xmath238 and @xmath239 are determined to satisfy normalization and boundary conditions at @xmath240 . after straightforward but tedious calculation we obtain @xmath241 .",
    "we know  @xcite that @xmath122 is negative , and consequently @xmath242 must be positive .",
    "this can also easily be confirmed directly by rewriting @xmath242 as @xmath243 ^ 2\\mathrm{d}x}{\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}(xu(x))^2}.\\ ] ] this means that the derived adiabatic potential necessarily should be supplemented with both the @xmath122 term and the term , @xmath119 , obtained by inclusion of next - to - leading order terms in the solution to the homogeneous part of eqs.([system_eq ] ) and ( [ system_eq1 ] ) .",
    "it turns out that the leading contribution in the @xmath122 term cancels exactly the @xmath119 term .",
    "thus , to make a rigorous conclusion about the allowed interval for the three - body binding energy , the next - to - leading order in @xmath122 term should be calculated .",
    "this investigation is , however , out of scope of the present paper but it should be the focus in future more detailed and more elaborate work .    _",
    "case with @xmath16_. this case is not very different from the @xmath17 just discussed above . we therefore only give the resulting @xmath244 , and the couplings that are needed to solve the corresponding equations .",
    "the couplings for @xmath245 take the form        where @xmath248 defines @xmath244 as @xmath249 . in the same way as we obtained eq .",
    "( [ eigen - eq ] ) we derive the following equation for @xmath248 @xmath250 this equation has a particular solution @xmath251 , which produces @xmath252 .",
    "the corresponding adiabatic potential was presented in the main part of this paper .",
    "we also note that to determine the large - distance behavior up to terms proportional to @xmath253 we need an investigation similar to the one provided for @xmath17 .",
    "however , since the leading term in the adiabatic potential , @xmath124 , only marginally allows universal weakly - bound states the results of such calculations are not expected to be particularly interesting . in the @xmath16 channel",
    "the most important physics comes from the non - universal adiabatic potential at short - distance .",

    "<S> the study of quantum mechanical bound states is as old as quantum theory itself . yet </S>",

    "<S> we demonstrate the existence of borromean systems of spin - polarized ( spinless ) identical fermions in two spatial dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> the ground state with zero orbital ( planar ) angular momentum exists in a borromean window between critical two- and three - body strengths . the doubly degenerate first excited states of angular momentum one appears only very close to the two - body threshold . </S>",
    "<S> they are the lowest in a possible sequence of so - called super - efimov states . </S>",
    "<S> while the observation of the super - efimov scaling could be very difficult , the borromean ground state should be observable in cold atomic gases and could be the basis for producing a quantum gas of three - body states in two dimensions .    </S>",
    "<S> unlike classical mechanics quantum mechanics allows bound @xmath0-body states without having bound subsystems . </S>",
    "<S> these so - called borromean systems are discussed in a number of publications for the simplest example of three particles @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> borromean three - body systems are abundant in three dimensions ( 3d ) for both bosonic and fermionic systems in nuclear , atomic and molecular physics @xcite . however , the behavior is strikingly different for bosonic systems in one or two ( 2d ) spatial dimensions  @xcite . where bound states appear for infinitesimally small attractions . without an artificial repulsive barrier at large distance </S>",
    "<S> it is virtually impossible to form a borromean bosonic 2d system @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the celebrated efimov effect of infinitely many bound three - body states at the two - body threshold is not present in 2d @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> three identical spin - polarized fermions are harder to bind than bosons , because relative two - body @xmath1-states are forbidden by the pauli principle . it would therefore intuitively be more difficult to form borromean systems and the efimov effect should be out of reach . </S>",
    "<S> however , both effects are possible in 2d as we shall discuss in the present paper . </S>",
    "<S> the efimov effect was recently derived in an extreme double - exponential scaling form @xcite using a momentum space formalism . </S>",
    "<S> the same scaling behavior was also found in low - energy scattering of three spinless fermions @xcite .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we present analytical and numerical evidence for a new state of fermionic matter where the basic constituent is a borromean three - fermion cluster . </S>",
    "<S> this may be considered a trion quantum gas as opposed to the two - component bcs - bec crossover @xcite driven by the absence ( bcs ) or presence ( bec ) of a two - body bound state . </S>",
    "<S> the new structure should be accessible through the tunability of both interactions and geometry of modern cold atom experiments @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> both the single particles and the three - body borromean states are fermionic entities and thus have to obey the pauli principle </S>",
    "<S> . this could imply an increase in stability of the many - body system , but estimates of the lifetime show that it is expected to be considerably shorter than the two - component fermi gas @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the creation of a superfluid state of spin - polarized fermions is still an important outstanding goal in the field . </S>",
    "<S> observation of the three - body borromean ground state is , however , not dependent on reaching the superfluid state . </S>",
    "<S> when formed , these three - body states are likely susceptible to chemical reactions and may be used to study quantum chemical dynamics of a fermionic gas with suppressed two - body but enhanced three - body reactions . </S>"
