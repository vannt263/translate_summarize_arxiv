    "the event occurred before the beginning of the 2015 bulge season and proceeded throughout the whole bulge season .",

    ", we use the numerical ray - shooting method @xcite . in the region around the caustic ,",
    "we use the semi - analytic hexadecapole approximation @xcite .",
    "we also consider the limb - darkening effect of the source star .",
    "for this , the surface brightness variation is parameterized as @xmath50 , where @xmath51 denotes the filter used for observation and @xmath52 represents the angle between the normal to the source star s surface and the line of sight toward the center of the source star .",
    "the adopted value of the limb - darkening coefficient is @xmath53 , which is chosen from the catalog of @xcite based on the stellar type of the source star .",
    "the source type is determined from the de - reddened color and brightness for which we discuss about the procedure of the determinations in section 4 .    from the standard modeling , we find a unique solution that describes the three main caustic - crossing features of the ground - based light curve . from the solution , it is found that the lens is a binary object composed of similar - mass components and a projected separation slightly greater than @xmath9 .",
    "however , the solution leaves a significant residual from the model as presented in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : one ] .",

    "to be also noted is that the standard model provides a poor fit to the _ spitzer _ data .",
    "it is known that the orbital motion of a binary lens can cause long - term deviations in lensing light curves @xcite .",
    "consideration of the orbital effect requires to include two additional parameters @xmath54 and @xmath55 , where @xmath54 denotes the rate of the binary separation change and @xmath55 represents the change rate of the source trajectory angle . from the modeling considering the orbital effect ( `` orbit model '' ) , we find that the observed data still leave a substantial residual from the model , indicating that the orbital effect is not the main cause of the deviation . in the third residual panel of figure",
    "[ fig : one ] , we present the residual from the orbit model .    another higher - order effect known to cause long - term deviations is the annual parallax effect .",
    "we check the possibility of the parallax effect by conducting another modeling considering the parallax effect ( `` parallax model '' ) .",

    "this implies that if the parallax effect detected in the light curve obtained from the ground - based observation is real , the effect should also be able to explain the light curve obtained from the _ spitzer _ observation .",
    "therefore , we conduct two sets of modeling where the first modeling is based on the ground - based data , while the second modeling is based on the combined data sets from the ground - based and from the _ spitzer _ observations . from these modelings , we find that the parallax effect can explain both the deviations of the ground - based and the _ spitzer _ data , as shown in the second residual panel of figure  [ fig : one ] .",

    ", the four - fold parallax degeneracy collapses into a two - fold degeneracy for a general case of binary - lens events because the degeneracy between the pair of @xmath59 and @xmath61 [ or @xmath60 and @xmath62 ] solutions are generally resolved due to the lack of lensing magnification symmetry compared to the single lens case although the remaining degeneracy , i.e.  @xmath59 and @xmath60 solutions , may persist .",

    "this degeneracy between the @xmath59 and @xmath60 solutions , which is referred to as the `` ecliptic degeneracy '' @xcite , is known to exist for general binary - lens events .",

    "this is possible because the difference between the light curves seen from the ground and from a solar - orbit satellite produces a large parallax effect .",

    "it is estimated that the source star has an angular radius of @xmath111 from the measured @xmath93 and @xmath46 , it is estimated that the angular einstein radius of the lens system is @xmath112 where the values in and out of the parenthesis are the values for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 solution , respectively .    by measuring both @xmath9 and @xmath14 , the masses of the lens components are determined as @xmath113 for the lens component located closer to the source trajectory and @xmath114 for the other lens component .",
    "the distance to the lens is @xmath115 the estimated mass and distance indicate that the binary lens is composed of roughly equal - mass m dwarf stars and located in the disk of the galaxy .",
    "the binary components are separated in projection by @xmath116 in table  [ table : three ] , we summarize the physical lens parameters .",

    "we analyzed the binary - lensing event ogle-2015-blg-0196 that was observed both from the ground and from the _ spitzer space telescope_. the light curve obtained from ground - based observations exhibited significant deviations from the lensing model based on the rectilinear relative lens - source motion motion and analysis of the deviation allowed us to measure the microlens parallax .",
    "the measured microlens parallax was confirmed by the data obtained from space - based observations up to the two - fold degeneracy caused by the well - known ecliptic degeneracy .",
    "this event is the first case where the ground - based microlens parallax was firmly confirmed with space - based observations . by additionally measuring the angular einstein radius from the analysis of caustic crossings of the light curve , we determined the mass and distance to the lens .",
