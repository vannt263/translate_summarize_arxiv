    "open clusters , with their dense central concentrations of stars , are relatively easy to identify . over a thousand systems are known , and the census is thought to be complete out to 2  kpc @xcite . because the clusters are no longer buried within interstellar gas and dust , their internal structure and dynamics is also more accessible than for younger groups .    despite these favorable circumstances ,",
    "many basic questions remain unanswered .",
    "most fundamentally , how do open clusters form ? all observed systems have undergone some degree of dynamical relaxation .",
    "thus , the present - day distribution of stellar mass differs from the one just after disruption of the parent cloud . recovering this initial configuration",
    "will clearly be of value in addressing the formation issue .",
    "but such reconstruction presupposes , and indeed requires , that we gauge accurately the stellar content of _ present - day _ clusters . even this simpler issue is a non - trivial one , as we show here .",
    "we consider one of the most intensively studied open clusters , the pleiades .",
    "again , our ultimate goal is to trace its evolution from the earliest , embedded phase to the present epoch . focusing here on the latter",
    ", we ask the following questions : what are the actual masses of the member stars ?",
    "do they follow the field - star initial mass function ?",
    "how many of the members are single , and how many are in binary pairs ?",
    "are the primary and secondary masses of binaries correlated ? what is the overall density distribution in the cluster ?",
    "what is the evidence for mass segregation , and how can this phenomenon be quantified ?",
    "all of these questions have been addressed previously by others .",
    "@xcite constructed a global mass function for the pleiades .",
    "their method was to assign masses based on the observed distribution of @xmath0-magnitudes .",
    "a more accurate assessment should account for the photometric influence of binaries .",
    "several studies directed specifically at binaries have probed selected regions for spectroscopic pairs @xcite .",
    "however , the overall binary fraction has not been carefully assessed , despite some preliminary attempts @xcite .    a fuller investigation of these and the other issues raised requires statistical methods ;",
    "these should prove generally useful in characterizing stellar populations .",
    "section  2 describes our approach , which employs a regularized maximum likelihood technique ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "a similar method has been applied to other astronomical problems , including the reconstruction of cloud shapes @xcite and the investigation of binarity within globular clusters @xcite .",
    "our study is the first to apply this versatile tool to young stellar groups . in doing so",
    ", we also relax many of the restrictive assumptions adopted by previous researchers .",
    "section  3 presents our derived mass function for the pleiades , along with our results for binarity .",
    "the density distribution , as well our quantification of mass segregation , are the topics of section  4 .",
    "finally , section  5 summarizes our findings , critically reexamines the binarity issue , and indicates the next steps in this continuing study .",
    "the basic problem is how to assign stellar masses to all the point - like sources believed to be cluster members . in many cases ,",
    "the source is actually a spatially unresolved binary pair .",
    "more rarely , it is a triple or higher - order system ; for simplicity , we ignore this possibility .",
    "the available observational data consists of photometry in several wavebands . given the inevitable , random error associated with each photometric measurement , it is not possible to identify a unique primary and secondary mass for each source .",
    "instead we adopt a statistical approach that finds the relative probability for each source to contain specific combinations of primary and secondary masses .",
    "we introduce a stellar mass probability density , to be denoted @xmath1 .",
    "this two - dimensional function is defined so that @xmath2 is the probability that a binary system exists with primary mass ( hereafter expressed in solar units ) in the interval @xmath3 to @xmath4 and secondary mass from @xmath5 to @xmath6 .",
    "single stars are viewed here as binaries with .",
    "we normalize the function over the full mass range : @xmath7 note that we integrate the secondary mass @xmath5 only to @xmath3 , its maximum value .",
    "furthermore , we set the lower limit of @xmath5 to 0 , in order to account for single stars .",
    "it is assumed that for . here , the global minimum mass @xmath8 is taken to be 0.08 , the brown dwarf limit .",
    "we consider @xmath9 to be the highest mass still on the main sequence .",
    "the age of the pleiades has been established from lithium dating as @xmath10  yr @xcite .",
    "this figure represents the main - sequence lifetime for a star of @xmath11 @xcite , which we adopt as @xmath9 .",
    "we examine separately the handful of stars that are ostensibly more massive than @xmath9 , and hence on post - main - sequence tracks . for these 11 sources , we assigned approximate masses from the observed spectral types , and obtained data on their known unresolved binary companions ; this information was taken from the bright star catalogue @xcite .",
    "these systems were then added by hand to our mass functions . finally , we ignore the brown dwarf population , thought to comprise from 10 to 16% of the total system mass @xcite .    the most direct method for evaluating @xmath12 would be to guess its values over a discrete grid of @xmath3- and @xmath5-values .",
    "each @xmath13 pair makes a certain contribution to the received flux in various wavebands .",
    "thus , any guessed @xmath12 yields a predicted distribution of fluxes , which will generally differ from that observed .",
    "one changes the guessed function until the observed flux distribution is most likely to be a statistical realization of the predicted one .",
    "unfortunately , this straightforward approach is impractical .",
    "the basic difficulty is the mass - sensitivity of stellar luminosities . for secondary masses",
    "@xmath5 only modestly less than @xmath3 , the binary is indistinguishable photometrically from a single star having the primary mass .",
    "a @xmath14 main - sequence star , for example , has a @xmath15-band flux of 10.81  mag at the 133  pc distance of the pleiades @xcite . pairing this star with a @xmath16 secondary ( which is not yet on the main sequence ) only changes the flux to 10.68  mag . in summary ,",
    "the function @xmath12 evaluated in this way is unconstrained throughout much of the @xmath17 plane .",
    "since binaries of even modestly large primary to secondary mass ratio are difficult to recognize observationally , we need to infer their contribution indirectly , within the context of a larger theoretical framework .",
    "the physical origin of binaries is far from settled @xcite .",
    "there is a growing consensus , however , that most pairs form together , perhaps within a single dense core .",
    "the accumulating observations of protobinaries , i.e. , tight pairs of class  0 or class  i infrared sources , have bolstered this view ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "if binaries indeed form simultaneously , but independently , within a single dense core , there is no reason to expect a strong correlation between the component masses .",
    "( such a correlation would be expected if the secondaries formed within the primaries circumstellar disks , for example . ) a credible starting hypothesis , then , is that each component mass is selected randomly from its own probability distribution .",
    "if the formation mechanism of each star is identical , then these distributions are also the same .",
    "that is , we postulate that the true binary contribution to @xmath12 is @xmath18 , where the single - star probability density @xmath19 is properly normalized : @xmath20    of course , not all sources are unresolved binaries .",
    "let @xmath21 represent the fraction of sources that are .",
    "we suppose that this fraction is independent of stellar mass , provided the mass in question can represent either the primary or secondary of a pair . while this hypothesis is reasonable for low - mass stars , it surely fails for o- and early b - type stars , which have an especially high multiplicity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . such massive objects , however , are not present in clusters of the pleiades age .    accepting the assumption of a global binary fraction",
    ", we have a tentative expression for the full stellar mass probability : @xmath22 here , the first term represents true binaries , and the second single stars of mass @xmath3 .",
    "the factor of 2 multiplying the first term is necessary because of the restricted range of integration for @xmath5 in equation  ( 1 ) .",
    "that is , this integration effectively covers only half of the @xmath3-@xmath5 plane . on the other hand",
    ", the normalization condition of equation  ( 2 ) applies to both the primary and secondary star , and covers the full range of mass , from @xmath8 to @xmath9 , for each component .",
    "we shall see below that the strict random pairing hypothesis , as expressed in equation  ( 3 ) , does not yield the optimal match between the predicted and observed distribution of magnitudes .",
    "the match can be improved , in the statistical sense outlined previously , if one allows for a limited degree of correlation between the primary and secondary masses within binaries . in other words",
    ", there is an apparent tendency for more massive primaries to be accompanied by secondaries that have a greater mass than would result from random selection .",
    "a simple way to quantify this effect is to consider the extreme cases .",
    "if there were _ perfect _ correlation between primary and secondary masses , then the contribution to @xmath12 from binaries would be @xmath23 . with no correlation at all ,",
    "@xmath12 is given by equation  ( 3 ) .",
    "we accordingly define a correlation coefficient @xmath24 , whose value lies between 0 and 1 .",
    "our final expression for @xmath1 uses @xmath24 to define a weighted average of the two extreme cases : @xmath25 note that the last righthand term , representing the probability of the source being a single star , is unaffected by the degree of mass correlation within binaries .        reconstructing the stellar mass probability @xmath26",
    "requires that we evaluate the constants @xmath21 and @xmath24 , as well as the single - star probability @xmath27 . to deal with this continuous function ,",
    "we divide the full mass range into discrete bins of width @xmath28 . integrating over each bin ,",
    "we find @xmath29 , the probability of a star s mass being in that narrow interval : @xmath30 we symbolize the full array of @xmath29-values by the vector @xmath31 , and similarly denote other arrays below .",
    "our task , then , is to find optimal values not only for @xmath21 and @xmath24 , but also for all but one element of @xmath31 .",
    "the normalization of @xmath19 is now expressed by the constraint @xmath32 which sets the last @xmath31-value .    for each choice of @xmath21 , @xmath24 , and @xmath31 , equation  ( 4 )",
    "tells us the relative probability of binaries being at any location in the @xmath17 plane . after dividing the plane into discrete bins ,",
    "each labeled by an index @xmath33 , we define @xmath34 as the predicted number of systems associated with a small bin centered on an @xmath13 pair . if @xmath35 is the total number of systems , i.e. , of unresolved sources in all magnitude bins , then our chosen @xmath21 , @xmath24 , and @xmath29-values yield the relative fractions @xmath36 .    as an example , consider a bin @xmath33 in which @xmath3 and @xmath5 have different values lying between @xmath8 and @xmath9 . then the system is an unequal - mass binary , for which equation  ( 4 ) gives @xmath37 here , @xmath38 is the element of @xmath31 corresponding to the selected @xmath3 , while @xmath39 is similarly associated with @xmath5 . for a bin where , the corresponding relation is @xmath40 note the additional term accounting for correlated binaries .",
    "note also that a factor of 2 has been dropped from equation  ( 4 ) , since we are integrating only over that portion of the mass bin with . finally , if the system is a single star , so that , we have @xmath41    our observational data consists of a catalog of @xmath42 sources , each of which has an apparent magnitude in at least two broadband filters .",
    "( in practice , these will be the @xmath43- and @xmath15-bands ; see below . ) as before , we divide this two - dimensional magnitude space into small bins .",
    "our choice of @xmath21 , @xmath24 , and @xmath31 leads not only to a predicted distribution in mass space , but also in magnitude space .",
    "let @xmath44 be the predicted number of sources in each magnitude bin , now labeled by the index @xmath45 .",
    "then we may write the transformation from the mass to the magnitude distribution as @xmath46 which may be recast in the abbreviated form @xmath47 here , @xmath48 is the _ response matrix _ , whose elements @xmath49 give the probability that a source in a mass bin @xmath33 is observed in a magnitude bin @xmath45 .",
    "in detail , this probability utilizes a theoretical isochrone in the color - magnitude diagram ( see section  3.1 ) . we must also account for random errors in the measured photometry . in other words ,",
    "a given magnitude pair can have contributions from a range of mass pairs .",
    "it is for this reason that each element of @xmath50 involves a _ sum _ over all @xmath33-values .",
    "we previously showed how to obtain the relative mass distribution @xmath36 , not the actual @xmath51 itself .",
    "however , it is the latter that we need for equation  ( 11 ) . to find @xmath35 , we sum equation  ( 10 ) over all @xmath45-values , and demand that this sum be @xmath42 , the total number of observed sources : @xmath52 so that @xmath53 in summary , choosing @xmath21 , @xmath24 , and @xmath31 gives us @xmath36 through through equations  ( 7 ) , ( 8) and ( 9 )",
    "we then solve equation  ( 12 ) for @xmath35 .",
    "supplied with knowledge of @xmath51 , we finally use equation  ( 11 ) to compute @xmath50 .",
    "having chosen @xmath21 , @xmath24 , and @xmath31 , how do we adjust these so that the predicted and observed magnitude distributions best match ?",
    "our technical treatment here closely follows that in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 11 ) , but specialized to our particular application .",
    "let @xmath54 be the number of sources actually observed in each two - dimensional magnitude bin .",
    "we first seek the probability that the full array @xmath55 is a statistical realization of the predicted @xmath50 .",
    "the supposition is that each element @xmath44 represents the _ average _ number of sources in the appropriate bin .",
    "this average would be attained after a large number of random realizations of the underlying distribution .",
    "if individual observed values follow a poisson distribution about the mean , then the probability of observing @xmath54 sources is @xmath56 this probability is highest when @xmath54 is close to @xmath44 .",
    "the likelihood function @xmath57 is the total probability of observing the full set of @xmath54-values : @xmath58 we will find it more convenient to deal with a sum rather than a product .",
    "thus , we use @xmath59 the strategy is then to find , for a given @xmath55 , that @xmath50 which maximizes @xmath60 . for this purpose",
    ", we may neglect the third term in the sum , which does not depend on @xmath50 .",
    "we thus maximize a slightly modified function : @xmath61    since , for a given @xmath55 , each @xmath62 peaks at , maximizing @xmath63 is equivalent to setting @xmath50 equal to @xmath55 in equation  ( 11 ) , and then inverting the response matrix to obtain @xmath51 .",
    "such a direct inversion procedure typically yields a very noisy @xmath51 , including unphysical ( negative ) elements .",
    "the solution is to _ regularize _ our result by employing an entropy term @xmath64 : @xmath65 the function @xmath64 is largest when the elements of @xmath31 are evenly spread out .",
    "adding @xmath64 to @xmath66 and maximizing the total guarantees that the @xmath31-values are smoothly distributed , i.e. , that @xmath27 is also a smooth function .    in practice , we also want to vary the relative weighting of @xmath64 and @xmath66 .",
    "we do this by defining a _ regularization parameter _",
    "@xmath67 , and then maximizing the function @xmath68 , where @xmath69 for any given value of @xmath67 , maximizing @xmath68 yields an acceptably smooth @xmath31 that reproduces well the observed data . for the optimal solution , we find that value of @xmath67 which gives the best balance between smoothness of the derived @xmath27 and accuracy of fit .",
    "we do this by considering another statistical measure , the bias .",
    "our observational dataset , @xmath55 , is an imperfect representation of the unknown probability density @xmath27 in two senses .",
    "as already noted , @xmath55 may be regarded as only one particular realization of the underlying distribution .",
    "even this single realization would directly reveal @xmath27 ( or , equivalently , @xmath31 ) if the sample size were infinite , which of course it is not .",
    "imagine that there were other realizations of @xmath27 .",
    "for each , we employ our maximum likelihood technique to obtain @xmath31 .",
    "averaging each @xmath29 over many trials yields its expectation value , @xmath70 .",
    "however , because of the finite sample size , @xmath70 does not necessarily converge to the true value , @xmath71 .",
    "their difference is the bias , @xmath72 : @xmath73    the values of the biases , collectively denoted @xmath74 , reflect the sensitivity of the estimated @xmath31 to changes in @xmath55 .",
    "following ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 11.6 ) , we define a matrix @xmath75 with elements @xmath76 the bias is then given by @xmath77 to evaluate the derivatives in @xmath75 , we consider variations of the function @xmath68 about its maximum . in matrix notation , @xmath78 where the matrix @xmath79 has elements @xmath80 and @xmath81",

    "we find the covariance matrix @xmath88 by repeated application of the rule for error propagation ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 1.6 ) .",
    "we begin with @xmath89 , the covariance of @xmath55 .",
    "since these values are assumed to be independently , poisson - distributed variables , @xmath89 has elements @xmath90 here we have used the fact that the variance of the poisson distribution equals its mean , @xmath44 . in this equation only , both @xmath33 and @xmath45 range over the @xmath91-values , i.e. , @xmath89 is a square matrix .",
    "we next consider @xmath92 , the covariance of @xmath31 .",
    "this is given by @xmath93 finally , we obtain the desired @xmath88 by @xmath94 the matrix @xmath95 in this last equation has elements @xmath96 differentiating equation  ( 21 ) and applying the chain rule , we find @xmath95 to be @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the identity matrix .      thus far , we have focused on determining global properties of the cluster , especially the mass function @xmath27 . we also want to investigate the spatial distribution of stellar masses . for this purpose",
    ", we need not perform another maximum likelihood analysis .",
    "the reason is that we can treat the mass distribution at each radius as a modification of the global result .",
    "we divide the ( projected ) cluster into circular annuli , each centered on a radius @xmath99 .",
    "what is @xmath100 , the number of sources in an annulus that are within mass bin @xmath33 ? ( as before , each bin is labeled by the masses of both binary components . ) the quantity we seek is @xmath101 here , @xmath102 is the probability that a source observed within magnitude bin @xmath45 has component masses within bin @xmath33 . in principle",
    ", this probability depends on radius .",
    "for example , the source could have a high probability of having a certain mass if there exist many such stars in that annulus , even stars whose real magnitude is far from the observed one .",
    "if we discount such extreme variations in the underlying stellar population , then we may approximate @xmath103 by its global average .",
    "the factor @xmath104 in equation  ( 32 ) is the estimated number of sources at radius @xmath99 in magnitude bin @xmath45 .",
    "we only compute , via the maximum likelihood analysis , @xmath44 , the estimated number of sources in the entire cluster .",
    "but we also know @xmath105 , the _ observed _ number of sources in the annulus .",
    "if the total number of observed sources , @xmath54 , is non - zero , then we take @xmath106 in case , then @xmath105 vanishes at all radii .",
    "we then assume @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the observed source number of all magnitudes in the annulus .",
    "in the end , equation  ( 32 ) attributes the radial mass variation to changes in the local magnitude distribution , rather than to improbable observations of special objects .",
    "it is clear that the global @xmath103 must be closely related to the response matrix @xmath48 , which is the probability that a source with a given mass has a certain magnitude .",
    "the precise relation between the two follows from bayes theorem : @xmath109 the numerator of the fraction is the probability that a source at any radius lies within the mass bin @xmath33 , while the denominator is the probability of it lying within magnitude bin @xmath45 .",
    "note that @xmath35 and @xmath110 need not be identical .",
    "the first quantity is the estimated number of sources covering all possible masses .",
    "the second is the observed number in the magnitude range under consideration . in practice",
    ", this range is extensive enough that the two are nearly the same .",
    "we thus write @xmath111 using this last equation , along with equation  ( 33 ) , equation  ( 32 ) now becomes @xmath112 for those terms where , equation  ( 34 ) tells us to replace the ratio @xmath113 by @xmath114 .",

    "shown are all sources which have high membership probability , as gauged by their colors , radial velocities , and proper motions ( see , e.g. , @xcite for one such proper motion study . )",
    "the lower open circles correspond to probable brown dwarfs ; we exclude such objects from our study .",

    "for the actual maximization , we employ a standard simplex algorithm ( * ? ? ?",

    "the next step is to increase @xmath67 slightly .",
    "we maximize @xmath68 in the same way as before , again recording covariances and biases .",
    "we again increase @xmath67 , repeating the entire procedure until @xmath143 , the weighted sum of the biases , starts to become acceptably small . at this point , the best - fit @xmath21 , @xmath24 , and @xmath31",
    "have been established .    as a first test of the procedure",
    ", we introduced an artificial cluster whose single - star probability , @xmath27 , we selected beforehand .",
    "sources were chosen randomly to have masses according to this distribution . in a certain fraction of the sources , our preset binary fraction @xmath21 ,",
    "a second star was added to the source .",
    "the mass of this object was also randomly chosen from @xmath27 .",

    "note that most of the scatter seen in both plots , especially in the left panel , was already present in the input data , which were finite realizations of the analytic distributions . the derived ( i.e. , predicted ) binary fractions , and , respectively , are also in good agreement .",
    "we had similar success when we reduced @xmath42 to 1245 , the actual number in our pleiades source catalog . in this smaller sample ,",
    "the errors in our predicted mass function and binary fraction increased , roughly as @xmath150 .",

    "it is the second threshold ( in this case ) that marks the true stopping point .",
    "the earlier dip in @xmath143 is due , not to a decrease in the biases , but to a sharp _ increase _ in the covariances @xmath88 .",

    "generalizing the prescription of @xcite , we then altered the secondary mass in each source according to @xmath151 here , @xmath152 , a preset number between 0 and 1 , represents our imposed degree of correlation .",

    "one price we paid for our simplified account of correlation was that our matching of @xmath27 was less accurate than for randomly paired input binaries .",

    "concurrently , our output function was too narrow compared to the input @xmath146 . the ( negative ) difference , @xmath155 , displayed as open circles in figure  6 , was also more pronounced at higher @xmath152 .",
    "these systematic errors need to be considered when analyzing a real cluster .",
    "the two patched areas in the figure again represent the likely regime of the pleiades , as we explain shortly .",
    "we now present the results of applying our maximum likelihood analysis to the pleiades itself , i.e. , to the @xmath43- and @xmath15-magnitudes of 1245 sources from the catalog of @xcite .",

    "( these and other uncertainties represent only random statistical error , and do not include systematic effects ; see section  5 . )",
    "we will discuss the implications of these findings in the following section .",
    "first , we examine the global distribution of stellar mass .",
    "the data points in figure  7 are the best - fit values of each @xmath148 . as in figure  3 , these points are a discrete representation of the single - star mass function @xmath27 .",
    "the large error bars on the two points at highest mass are due to the small number of sources gauged to be in the respective bins .",
    "the smooth , solid curve in figure  7 is a log - normal mass function that best matches the empirical @xmath31 . referring again to equation  ( 41 )",
    ", we find that and .",
    "the presence of a finite binary correlation affects both estimates . judging from figure  6 ,",
    "our @xmath153 is overestimated by about 0.06 , while @xmath146 should be raised by 0.08 .",
    "each of our mass bins has contributions from both the primary and secondary components of binary pairs , as quantified by equation  ( 4 ) . integrating the full stellar mass probablity @xmath12 over all secondary masses ,",
    "we obtain @xmath156 , the probability distribution of primary masses : @xmath157 note that this distribution includes the possibility that the star is single ( ) .",
    "the solid curve in figure  8 is a log - normal fit to the empirical @xmath156 . shown for comparison as",
    "a dashed curve is the fit for @xmath27 from figure  7 .",
    "relative to the latter function , the primary distribution falls off at lower masses .",
    "this falloff simply reflects the fact that less massive objects are more likely to be part of a binary containing a higher - mass star , and thus to be labeled as  secondaries . \" by integrating @xmath12 over @xmath3 , from @xmath5 to @xmath9 .",
    "the function @xmath158 has an excess of low - mass stars and drops very steeply at high masses , as most such objects are primaries . ] in any event , we now see why the peak of @xmath156 , , is elevated with respect to the peak of @xmath27 . similarly , the primary distribution is also slightly narrower than the single - star mass function , with .",
    "the parameters of our log - normal approximation to @xmath156 may be compared to those of @xcite .",
    "these authors fit the entire mass function .",
    "since , however , they did not account for binarity , their results are more closely analogous to our primary distribution .",
    "their best - fit @xmath153 of 0.25 is close to ours , while their @xmath146 of 0.52 is higher , mostly because of their inclusion of the highest - mass members .",
    "these parameters are also close to those given by @xcite in his log - normal fit to the field - star initial mass function ( , ) .    in figure  9 , we compare our single - star distribution @xmath27 to the field - star initial mass function ( dashed curve ) .",
    "the latter , which has been raised in the figure for clarity , is taken from @xcite , who did correct for binarity .",
    "it is apparent that @xmath27 itself veers away from the imf for both low- and high - mass objects .",
    "when these are added in , the resemblance improves .",
    "the open circles in figure  9 are pleiades low - mass stars and brown dwarfs found by @xcite .",
    "we have normalized their data , taken from a limited area of the cluster , so that their total number of stars matches ours within the overlapping mass range .",
    "no such normalization was necessary for the 11 b - type stars ( filled circles ) , which are from the catalog of @xcite but not included in our maximum likelihood analysis . adding both these groups not only improves the match to the imf , but also reveals a gap in the stellar distribution between about 2 and @xmath159 .",
    "a similar gap is seen in the pleiades mass function of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see their figure  1 ) .",
    "our estimate for the total cluster mass , based solely on the 1245 catalog sources , is @xmath160 , with a 4% uncertainty .",
    "adding in the brightest stars brings this total to @xmath161 , with the same relative error .",
    "tests with synthetic data indicate that the systematic bias due to binary correlation raises this figure by roughly @xmath162 , to @xmath163 .",
    "addition of the brown dwarfs would cause a further , relatively small , increase . for comparison ,",
    "@xcite found @xmath164 in stars , and an upper limit of @xmath165 for the brown dwarf contribution .",
    "@xcite used the virial theorem to estimate a total mass of @xmath166 , with a 28% uncertainty .",
    "direct integration of their mass function gave @xmath167 , with an 18% fractional error .",
    "the global binary fraction , , obtained in our analysis represents most , but not all , of the full binary population . omitted here",
    "are spatially resolved systems . for these ,",
    "the primary and secondary appear as separate sources in the catalog of @xcite .",
    "counting resolved pairs raises the total fraction to about 76% , as we now show .",
    "the smallest angular separation between stars in the catalog is @xmath168 . at the pleiades distance of 133  pc ,",
    "the corresponding physical separation is 1400  au .",
    "an edge - on circular binary of exactly this orbital diameter will still be unresolved , since the components spend most of their time closer together .",
    "the true minimum separation in this case is 2200  au . here",
    ", we have divided 1400  au by @xmath169 , which is the average of @xmath170 , for @xmath171 randomly distributed between 0 and @xmath172 .    of course ,",
    "only a relatively small fraction of binaries have separations exceeding 2200  au .",
    "the average total mass of our unresolved systems is @xmath173 .",
    "a binary of that total mass and a 2200  au diameter has a period of @xmath174 .",
    "what fraction of binaries have even longer periods ?",
    "our average _ primary _ mass is @xmath175 , corresponding to a spectral type of m1 .",
    "@xcite studied the period distribution of binaries containing m - type primaries .",
    "they claimed that this distribution was indistinguishable from that found by @xcite for g - type primaries . in this latter sample ,",
    "11% of the systems had periods greater than our limiting value . if the pleiades periods are similarly distributed , then the total fraction of binaries - both resolved and unresolved - becomes .    even without this augmentation",
    ", our total binary fraction appears to be inconsistent with the available direct observations of the pleiades .",
    "thus , @xcite found visual pairs with periods between 40 and @xmath176  yr . using the period distribution of @xcite to extrapolate their observed binary fraction of 28% yields a total fraction of 60% .",
    "@xcite observed spectroscopic pairs with periods under 3  yr . a similar exercise again yields 60% .",
    "we note , however , that this ostensible concurrence of results is based on very broad extrapolations from limited data .",
    "( see fig .  4 of @xcite .",
    ")    our derived binary fraction also exceeds that found in the field - star population .",
    "@xcite found that 57% of g  stars are the primaries of binary or higher - order systems .",
    "note that our @xmath21 represents the total probability that a star is in a binary , whether as the primary or secondary component . since g  stars are rarely secondaries , the comparison with @xcite is appropriate . on the other hand , m  stars _",
    "are _ frequently secondaries , so we would expect the fraction of binaries with m - type primaries to be reduced . @xcite has found that only 25% of m - stars are the primary components of binaries . our own analysis yields a binary fraction of 45% for m - star primaries , still in excess of the field - star result .",
    "if our finding of a relatively high binary fraction proves robust , it may provide a clue to the progenitor state of the pleiades and other open clusters .",
    "a similar statement applies to the correlation between component masses within binaries .",
    "our adopted method of gauging this correlation - inserting a fraction of equal - mass pairs in the mass function - is admittedly crude .",
    "nevertheless , the strong result ( ) is significant . referring back to figure  5",
    ", we find that the pleiades correlation is equivalent to setting @xmath152 equal to about 0.65 in the alternative description of equation  ( 42 ) .",
    "whatever the origin of the pleiades binaries , the primaries and secondaries were not formed by completely independent processes .",
    "we now employ the procedure outlined in section  2.4 to investigate both the surface and volumetric density as a function of the projected distance from the cluster center .",
    "the filled circles in figure  10 , along with the associated error bars , represent the surface number density of sources , measured in pc@xmath177 .",
    "the solid curve is a density profile using the empirical prescription of @xcite . here",
    ", the core radius is 2.1  pc , while the tidal radius is 19  pc . for comparison ,",
    "@xcite also fit the surface number density profile of their low - mass stars to a king model , with a core radius of 2.3 - 3.0  pc .",
    "our profile is also at least roughly consistent with the cumulative number distribution displayed by @xcite .",
    "our best - fit tidal radius is slightly larger than the 17  pc cited by these authors .",
    "the surface mass density is plotted in an analogous fashion , again as a function of the projected radius .",
    "we show both the data points ( small open circles ) and , as the dashed curve , the best - fit king model . here , the core radius is 1.3  pc , and the tidal radius is 18  pc .",
    "note that the mass density profile falls off more steeply than the number density .",
    "thus , stars near the center are abnormally massive , a trend we shall explore more extensively below .    figure  11 displays the corresponding volumetric densities .",
    "as we indicated , the deconvolution from surface profiles assumes spherical symmetry .",
    "in fact , the pleiades is slightly asymmetric , with a projected axis ratio of 1.2:1 @xcite .",
    "this ellipticity is thought to stem from the tidal component of the galactic gravitational field @xcite . under the spherical assumption ,",
    "the filled circles and solid , smooth curve show the number density . here , the king model is the same used for the surface number density in figure  10 , but deprojected into three - dimensional space .",
    "figure  11 also shows , as the small open circles and dashed curve , the mass density as a function of spherical radius .",
    "again , the king model here is the deprojected version of that from figure  10 . the relatively rapid falloff in the mass , as opposed to the number",
    ", density is another sign of the tendency for more massive stars to crowd toward the center .",
    "the information we used in obtaining these profiles also gives us the spatial variation of the binary fraction @xmath21 .",
    "that is , we first used equation  ( 37 ) to obtain @xmath178 , the predicted mass distribution in each radial annulus . recall that the distribution refers to both primaries and secondaries , as well as single stars .",
    "the binary fraction can thus be computed locally . to within our uncertainty ,",
    "about @xmath179 at each radial bin , we find no variation of @xmath21 across the cluster .",
    "we have mentioned , in a qualitative manner , that more massive cluster members tend to reside nearer the center . in figure  12",
    ", we explicitly show this trend . here , we plot @xmath180 , the average system mass ( primary plus secondary ) as a function of the projected cluster radius .",
    "it is apparent that @xmath180 monotonically falls out to about 4  pc . beyond that point ,",
    "the average mass is roughly constant .",
    "the pattern here is consistent with mass segregation , but is not a clear demonstration of that effect .",
    "the problem is that figure  12 gives no indication of the relative populations at different annuli .",
    "if the outer ones are occupied by only a small fraction of the cluster , is mass segregation present ? to gauge any variation in the mass distribution of stars , that distribution must be calculated over an adequate sample size .",
    "previous authors have also claimed evidence of mass segregation , using various criteria .",
    "@xcite looked at the distribution of surface and volumetric number densities for a number of different mass bins .",
    "@xcite divided the population by magnitude into relatively bright and faint stars .",
    "they calculated the cumulative number as a function of radius for both groups , and found the bright stars to be more centrally concentrated .",
    "finally , @xcite fit king profiles to the surface density of various mass bins . as the average mass increases , the core radius shrinks .",
    "figure  13 gives a simpler and more clear - cut demonstration of the effect .",
    "here , we consider @xmath181 , the number of sources enclused in a given projected radius , divided by the total number of sources in the cluster .",
    "we also consider @xmath182 , the analogous fractional mass inside any projected radius .",
    "the figure then plots @xmath182 versus @xmath181 . in the absence of mass segregation",
    ", @xmath182 would equal @xmath181 at each annulus .",
    "this hypothetical situation is illustrated by the dotted diagonal line .    in reality , @xmath182 rises above @xmath181 , before they both reach unity at the cluster boundary ( see upper smooth curve , along with the data points ) .",
    "this rise , as already noted , indicates that the innermost portion of the cluster has an anomalously large average mass , i.e. , that mass segregation is present .",
    "moreover , the _ area _ between the solid and dotted curves is a direct measure of the effect . in the case of  perfect \" mass segregation",
    ", a few stars near the center would contain virtually all the cluster mass .",
    "the solid curve would trace the upper rectangular boundary of the plot , and the enclosed area would be 0.5 .",
    "we thus define the _ gini coefficient _ , @xmath183 , as _",
    "twice _ the area between the actual @xmath184 curve and the central diagonal . is also half the mean mass difference of radial shells , where that mass difference is normalized to the average system mass in the cluster . ] for the pleiades , we find that .",
    "it is possible , at least in principle , that this effect is due entirely to a few exceptionally massive stars located near the center .",
    "in fact , this is _ not _ the case .",
    "we have artificially removed the 11 brightest sources ( all late - b stars ) and recalculated @xmath182 versus @xmath181 .",
    "the result is shown by the dashed curve in figure  13 . while the rise above the diagonal is diminished",
    ", it is still present .",
    "that is , the intermediate - mass population exhibits segregation , as well .",
    "an interesting contrast is presented by another populous group , the orion nebula cluster ( onc ) .",
    "the distribution of stellar masses in this far younger system was recently studied by @xcite .",
    "figure  2 in that paper compares the stellar populations in the inner and outer halves of the cluster .",
    "apart from a few high - mass objects , the two populations are essential identical .",
    "we may also construct an @xmath184 curve for the onc , as shown here in figure  14 .",
    "the solid curve again lies well above the fiducial diagonal , ostensibly indicating mass segregation .",
    "however , removal of just the four trapezium stars gives a dramatically different result ( dashed curve ) that is virtually indistinquishable from the diagonal .",
    "all stars except this tiny subset are similarly distributed .",
    "the cluster is too young to have undergone true mass segregation , a conclusion drawn previously from n - body simulations @xcite .",
    "the trapezium represents a special population , one that probably formed just prior to cloud dispersal @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we have applied a versatile statistical tool , the maximum likelihood technique , to assess the distribution of stellar mass and the incidence of binaries in the pleiades .",
    "we began with a near - infrared catalog of cluster members .",
    "our basic assumption was that all cluster members share the same evolutionary age , and that any dispersion in the color - magnitude plane stems from binarity and random photometric errors .",
    "we were then able to infer the most probable distribution of masses , both for the cluster as a whole , and as a function of distance from its center .",
    "finally , we introduced a simple method for gauging the degree of mass segregation in the cluster .",
    "one of our surprising results is the relatively high fraction of binaries .",
    "we estimate that 68% of all systems in the cluster are unresolved binaries ; this figure climbs to about 76% if resolved pairs are included .",
    "these fractions are significantly higher than the accepted field - star result , so we should scrutinize them carefully . could they stem from an underestimate of the photometric error at faint magnitudes ?",
    "since the error in @xmath43 is greater than @xmath15 , we artificially increased the dispersion @xmath135 .",
    "we kept @xmath135 at 0.15 until , below which we increased it linearly , reaching at . after redoing the maximum likelihood analysis ,",
    "the global binary fraction @xmath21 for unresolved pairs is unchanged .",
    "another potential difficulty is our neglect of the physical thickness of the cluster .",
    "we have assigned all members a distance of 133  pc , although there will naturally be some variation .",
    "however , this effect is also relatively small . from section  4.1",
    ", the volumetric number density falls off with radius approximately as a king model with core and tidal radii of 2.1 and 19  pc , respectively .",
    "consider the front half of a spherical cluster with such a density distribution .",
    "it may readily be shown that the mean distance from the plane of the sky of any cluster member is . for a cluster at mean distance @xmath185 ,",
    "the induced magnitude spread is , which is 0.04 in our case .",
    "although the actual spread in magnitudes is not gaussian , we have added this figure in quadrature to both @xmath135 and @xmath136 , and rerun the analysis .",
    "again , the binarity is unaffected .",
    "the errors due to both photometry and finite cluster thickness induce a symmetric spread in stellar magnitudes .",
    "that is , they scatter as many sources below the fiducial isochrone as above it .",
    "thus , they can not reduce the estimated binarity , which stems from an excess of stars above the isochrone .",
    "one systematic error that _ would _",
    "affect @xmath21 is an overestimation of the cluster distance .",
    "if @xmath185 were lowered , the absolute magnitudes of all sources would decrease equally , as would the inferred @xmath21-value .",
    "quantitatively , the distance would have to decrease by about 15  pc to bring the binary fraction down to the field - star result for g - dwarf primaries .",
    "an error of this size for the average distance is excluded by current observations , for which the estimated uncertainty is only 1  pc @xcite .",
    "since our method relies solely on photometry to assess binarity , we can not distinguish between physically linked pairs and chance alignments . as mentioned in section  3.4 ,",
    "the resolution limit of our data is @xmath168 , or at the distance of the pleiades .",
    "consider a star at a radius @xmath99 from the cluster center .",
    "its average number of neighbors within @xmath186 is , where @xmath187 is the projected surface number density of the cluster .",
    "since each ring of width @xmath188 contains stars , integration over all members yields the total number of chance alignments : @xmath189 where @xmath0 is the cluster s outer radius , using @xmath187 from figure  10 , we find .",
    "thus , chance alignments have no quantitative impact .",
    "yet another source of systematic error is the cluster age .",
    "we have adopted the lithium - based figure of 125  myr from @xcite .",
    "earlier estimates , using the main - sequence turnoff , yielded a range of answers .",
    "for example , @xcite found 100  myr .",
    "even this minor reduction affects our results , since it lifts the low - mass end of the isochrone toward higher luminosity . for an age of 100  myr",
    ", our analysis gives and .",
    "the binary fraction is augmented to 0.64 when we include resolved pairs . from figure  3 of @xcite",
    ", a 100  myr age corresponds to a lithium edge at , or at the pleiades distance .",
    "such a result seems incompatible with the lithium data shown in figure  2 of @xcite , but the total number of observations is relatively small .",

    "our next step in addressing this basic issue is to try and account theoretically for the empirical properties just obtained through our statistical analysis .",
    "we will ascertain , using direct numerical simulations , the range of initial states that can relax dynamically to the present - day pleiades .",
    "such a study will bring us one step closer to understanding the molecular cloud environments that give rise to open clusters .",
    "we are grateful to eric huff , who first suggested the use of the maximum likelihood technique for this problem and provided continued insight .",

    "in section 4.2 , we introduced the gini coefficient geometrically , as twice the area between the @xmath184 curve and the diagnonal line representing zero mass segregation .",
    "alternatively , @xmath183 may be defined in terms of the mean mass difference between radial shells in the cluster . here",
    "we describe more precisely , and prove the equivalence of , this second interpretation .    altering our previous notation",
    ", we now let @xmath190 be the average system mass ( primary plus secondary ) in a shell with outer radius @xmath99 .",
    "if there are many shells , then we may define a system number density @xmath191 , such that the number of systems between @xmath99 and @xmath192 is @xmath193 .",
    "the total number of systems at all radii is @xmath194 this total was called @xmath35 in the text .",
    "the average system mass throughout the entire cluster is @xmath195 we will be concerned with the _ relative mean difference _ in the mass of shells .",
    "this is @xmath196 we will prove that the gini coefficient , as defined in section  4.2 , is also @xmath197 .    in the geometric definition of @xmath183 , we utilized the cumulative fractional number @xmath181 and cumulative fractional mass @xmath182 .",
    "these may be written in terms of the system number density : @xmath198 we will later need the differentials of @xmath181 and @xmath182 , which are @xmath199 in terms of @xmath181 and @xmath182 , the geometric definition of @xmath183 is then @xmath200 if the mass is centrally concentrated , as expected in a real stellar cluster , then at all radii , and .",

    "we now return to equation  ( a3 ) and manipulate it to obtain @xmath183 , as defined above .",
    "a central assumption we will make is that @xmath190 declines monotonically with @xmath99 .",
    "we may then expand the righthand side of equation  ( a3 ) .",
    "we split the integral over @xmath201 into two parts , one for and the other for . under our assumption , in the first integral , and in the second . after pulling @xmath191 from the @xmath201-integration",
    ", we further split the integrands to find @xmath202 the first two terms of the integrand are @xmath203 the third term is @xmath204 while the fourth is @xmath205    putting equations  ( a10 ) , ( a11 ) , ( a14 ) , and ( a17 ) back into equation  ( a9 ) yields @xmath206\\ , n ( r)\\,dr \\\\             & = & 2\\,\\left ( \\int_0 ^ 1\\!f_m\\,d f_n \\,-\\ , \\int_0 ^ 1\\!f_n\\,d f_m \\right ) \\,\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have used both equations  ( a1 ) and ( a2 ) to cancel the last two terms on the right side of equation  ( a18 ) , and equations ( a6 ) and ( a7 ) to transform the remaining two terms .",
    "the second integral in the last equation is @xmath207 since @xmath182 and @xmath181 attain their upper and lower bounds simultaneously .",
