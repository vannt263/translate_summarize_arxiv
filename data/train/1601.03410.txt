    "the signals from a process of interest are often contaminated by signals from `` noise '' processes , which are thought to be statistically independent of the process of interest but are otherwise unknown .",
    "this raises the question : can one use the signals to determine if two or more independent processes are present , and , if so , can one derive a representation of the evolution of each of them ?",
    "in other words , if a system is effectively evolving in a closed box , can one  explore \" the signals emanating from the box in order to learn the number and nature of the subsystems within it ?",
    "there is a variety of methods for solving this blind source separation ( bss ) problem for the special case in which the signals are linearly related to the system states .",
    "however , some observed signals ( e.g. , from biological or economic systems ) may be nonlinear functions of the underlying system states , and computational methods for performing nonlinear bss are limited ( @xcite ) , even though humans can often perform it quite effortlessly .",
    "consider an evolving physical system that is being observed by making time - dependent measurements , @xmath5 , which are invertibly related to the system s state variables . in conclusion , we describe how to choose measurements that have this invertibility property .",
    "the objective of bss is to determine if the measurements are mixtures of the state variables of statistically independent subsytems .",
    "specifically , we want to know if there is an invertible , possibly nonlinear , @xmath6  mixing \" function , @xmath7 , that transforms the measurement time series into a time series of separable states : @xmath8 , \\ ] ] where @xmath9 denotes a set of state components , @xmath10 , which can be partitioned into two or more statistically independent groups .",
    "note that the mixing function defines a transformation between two coordinate systems on state space : the coordinate system ( @xmath4 ) defined by the choice of measurements and the coordinate system ( @xmath11 ) of separable state components .",
    "the method proposed in this paper utilizes a criterion for statistical independence that differs from the conventional one .",
    "let @xmath12 be the probability density function ( pdf ) , defined so that @xmath13 is the fraction of total time that the trajectory @xmath9 is located within the volume element @xmath14 at location @xmath11 . in the usual formulation of the bss problem , the mixing function must transform the measurements so that @xmath12 is the product of the density functions of individual components ( or groups of components ) @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a subsystem state variable , comprised of one or more of the components @xmath17 . in every formulation of bss ,",
    "multiple solutions can be created by permuting the subsystem state variables and/or transforming their components . however , the criterion in ( [ state space factorization ] ) is so weak that it suffers from a much worse non - uniqueness problem : namely , solutions can be created by mixing the state variables of other solutions ( see  @xcite and references therein ) .    in this paper ,",
    "the issue of non - uniqueness is circumvented by considering the data s trajectory in @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) , instead of @xmath20 ( i.e. , state space ) .",
    "first , let @xmath21 be the pdf in this space , defined so that @xmath22 is the fraction of total time that the location and velocity of @xmath9 are within the volume element @xmath23 at location @xmath24 . as in an earlier paper  @xcite , the mixing function must transform the measurements so that @xmath21 is the product of the density functions of individual components ( or groups of components ) @xmath25 separability in @xmath18 is a stronger requirement than separability in state space . to see this , note that ( [ state space factorization ] ) can be recovered by integrating both sides of ( [ phase space factorization ] ) over all velocities , but the latter equation can not be deduced from the former one . in fact , it can be shown that ( [ phase space factorization ] ) is strong enough to guarantee that the bss problem has a unique solution , up to permutations of subsystem state variables and transformations of their components ( @xcite ) , and that is why it is studied here .    because this paper utilizes the separability criterion in ( [ phase space factorization ] ) , it is fundamentally different from most other bss techniques , which utilize the weaker criterion in ( [ state space factorization ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the new method exploits statistical constraints on the measurement velocities in each _ local _ region of state space .",
    "in contrast , existing methods of using velocity information utilize weaker constraints on the _ global _ distribution of measurement velocities ( @xcite ) .",
    "the new method should be compared to two earlier techniques of performing bss according to the criterion in ( [ phase space factorization ] ) .",
    "in @xcite it was shown that the local second - order correlation matrix of measurement velocity can be taken to define a riemannian metric on the space of measurements ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "nonlinear bss can then be performed by finding the transformation to another ( @xmath11 ) coordinate system , in which this metric is block - diagonal everywhere . in order to construct this new coordinate system ,",
    "it is necessary to compute the metric s first and second derivatives with respect to @xmath4 .",
    "this approach suffers from a practical difficulty : namely , a great deal of data is required to cover the measurement manifold densely enough in order to calculate these derivatives accurately . in contrast , the method proposed in this paper only depends on the computation of the second and fourth - order correlations of the local @xmath2 distribution .",
    "this can be done with much less data .",
    "reference @xcite describes a second way of performing nonlinear bss according to the criterion in ( [ phase space factorization ] ) .",
    "higher - order local correlations of the data s velocity ( typically , at least fifth - order correlations ) are used to compute multiple scalar quantities ( typically , at least six scalars ) at each point @xmath4 .",
    "a necessary consequence of separability is that certain subgroups of these scalars must map @xmath26 onto a subspace of lower dimensions .",
    "typically , this approach requires more data than the proposed technique because it is necessary to compute local velocity correlations of order greater than four .",
    "the next section describes how to determine if the data are separable and , if so , how to recover a representation of the evolution of each independent subsystem .",
    "section iii illustrates the method by using it to recover the utterances of two speakers from unknown nonlinear mixtures of their waveforms .",
    "the last section discusses the implications of this approach .",
    "this paragraph and figure [ figure1 ] provide a brief description of the proposed bss procedure .",
    "the procedure is initiated by using the local distribution of measurement velocities to construct @xmath3 local vectors ( @xmath27 ) at each point @xmath4 .",
    "if the data are separable , there is a special @xmath11 coordinate system in which ( [ phase space factorization ] ) is true . in that",
    "coordinate system it is evident that each vector is directed along the subspace created by varying one subsystem s state variables , while all other subsystems are held constant .",
    "because of this property , these vectors can be used to construct a finite set of functions on @xmath28 , and one of those functions must transform the data to a separable coordinate system if it exists .",
    "therefore , we can determine whether the data are separable by seeing if any of these functions transforms the data s density function ( or correlations ) into a factorizable form .",
    "if the data are separable , they can be transformed into the separable coordinate system in order to recover the time course of each subsystem ( up to an arbitrary transformations on the state space of each subsystem ) .",
    "the first step is to construct second - order and fourth - order local correlations of the data s velocity @xmath29 @xmath30 where @xmath31 , where the bracket denotes the time average over the trajectory s segments in a small neighborhood of @xmath4 , and where all indices are integers between @xmath32 and @xmath3 . because @xmath2 is a contravariant vector , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are local contravariant tensors of second and fourth rank , respectively .",
    "the definition of the pdf implies that @xmath33 and @xmath34 are two of its moments ; e.g. , @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the pdf in the @xmath4 coordinate system , where  @xmath37 \" denotes possible additional indices on the left side and corresponding factors of @xmath38 on the right side , and where all indices are integers between @xmath32 and @xmath3 .",
    "although ( [ pdf moment ] ) is useful in a formal sense , in practical applications all required correlation functions can be computed directly from local time averages of the data ( i.e. , ( [ c2 definition])-([c4 definition ] ) ) , without explicitly computing the data s pdf . also , note",
    "that velocity  correlations \" with a single subscript vanish identically @xmath39    next , let @xmath40 be any local @xmath41 matrix , and use it to define @xmath42 velocity correlations @xmath43 @xmath44 because @xmath33 is generically positive definite at any point @xmath4 , it is possible to find a particular form of @xmath40 that satisfies @xmath45 @xmath46 where @xmath47 is a diagonal @xmath48 matrix .",
    "such an @xmath40 can be constructed from the product of three matrices : 1 ) a rotation that diagonalizes @xmath33 , 2 ) a diagonal rescaling matrix that transforms this diagonalized correlation into the identity matrix , 3 ) another rotation that diagonalizes @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the fourth - order velocity correlation ( @xmath34 ) after it has been transformed by the first rotation and the rescaling matrix .",
    "as long as @xmath51 is not degenerate , @xmath40 is unique , up to arbitrary _ local _ permutations and/or reflections . in almost all applications of interest ,",
    "the velocity correlations will be continuous functions of @xmath4 .",
    "therefore , in any neighborhood of state space , there will always be a continuous solution for @xmath40 , and this solution is unique , up to arbitrary _",
    "global _ permutations and/or reflections .    in any other coordinate system @xmath52 , the most general solution for @xmath53 is given by @xmath54 where @xmath55 is a matrix that satisfies ( [ m definition 1 ] ) and ( [ m definition 2 ] ) in the @xmath4 coordinate system and where @xmath56 is a product of permutation , reflection , and identity matrices .",
    "this can be proven by substituting this equation into the definition of @xmath57 and @xmath58 and by noting that these quantities satisfy ( [ m definition 1 ] ) and ( [ m definition 2 ] ) in the @xmath52 coordinate system because ( [ i2 definition])-([i4 definition ] ) satisfy them in the @xmath4 coordinate system .",
    "note that , by construction , @xmath55 is not singular , and , therefore , it has a non - singular inverse .    notice that ( [ m ] ) shows that the rows of @xmath55 transform as local covariant vectors , up to global permutations and/or reflections .",
    "likewise , the same equation implies that the columns of @xmath59 transform as local contravariant vectors ( denoted as @xmath27 ) , up to global permutations and/or reflections .",
    "because these vectors are linearly independent , the measurement velocity at each time , @xmath60 , can be represented by a weighted superposition of them @xmath61 where @xmath62 are time - dependent weights . because @xmath2 and @xmath63 transform as contravariant vectors , the weights @xmath62 must transform as scalars ; i.e. , they are independent of the coordinate system in which they are computed ( except for possible permutations and/or reflections ) . in this sense ,",
    "the time series of weights comprises an invariant or coordinate - system - independent representation of the system s velocity .",
    "now , let s imagine the computation of these weights in the separable ( @xmath11 ) coordinate system , in which the components of @xmath11 have been partitioned into disjoint blocks corresponding to ( possibly multidimensional ) subsystem state variables .",
    "in this coordinate system , correlations @xmath64 , having all indices in block @xmath65 , are the correlations between the components of state variable @xmath16 .",
    "next , construct the block diagonal matrix @xmath66 @xmath67 where submatrix @xmath68 satisfies ( [ m definition 1 ] ) and ( [ m definition 2 ] ) for correlations between components of @xmath16 .",
    "it is not difficult to show that @xmath69 satisfies ( [ m definition 1 ] ) and ( [ m definition 2 ] ) in the @xmath11 coordinate system and that it is unique , up to global permutations and/or reflections . to see this , first note that ( [ pdf moment ] ) , ( [ phase space factorization ] ) , and ( [ c_k=0 ] ) imply that velocity correlations in the @xmath11 coordinate system vanish if their indices contain a solitary index from any one block .",
    "it follows that @xmath70 is block diagonal and that ( [ block - diagonal ms ] ) satisfies the constraint ( [ m definition 1 ] ) , because each block of @xmath69 is defined to transform the corresponding block of @xmath71 into an identity matrix . in order to prove that ( [ block - diagonal ms ] ) satisfies ( [ m definition 2 ] ) , substitute it into the definition of @xmath72 then , note that : 1 ) when @xmath73 and @xmath74 belong to different blocks , each term in this sum vanishes because it factorizes into a product of correlations , one of which has a single index ; 2 ) when @xmath73 and @xmath74 belong to the same block and are unequal , each term with @xmath75 in any other block contains a factor equal to @xmath76 , which vanishes as proved above ; 3 ) when @xmath73 and @xmath74 belong to the same block and are unequal , the sum over @xmath75 in the same block vanishes , because each block of @xmath69 is defined to satisfy ( [ m definition 2 ] ) for the corresponding subsystem .    after transforming ( [ xdot rep ] ) into the @xmath11 coordinate system , it has the form @xmath77 where @xmath78 is @xmath79 in the @xmath11 coordinate system and @xmath56 is a possible permutation and/or reflection .",
    "note that @xmath80 is the @xmath81 column of @xmath82 .",
    "in other words , the @xmath80 are the local vectors , which are derived from the local distribution of @xmath83 in the same way that the @xmath63 were derived from the local distribution of @xmath2 .",
    "so , ( [ sdot rep ] ) shows that the weights that represent @xmath83 are the same ( up to a possible permutation and/or reflection ) as those that represent @xmath2 .",
    "observe that each vector @xmath80 vanishes except where it passes through one of the blocks of @xmath82 .",
    "therefore , equation ( [ sdot rep ] ) is equivalent to a group of equations , which are formed by projecting it onto each block corresponding to a subsystem state variable .",
    "for example , projecting both sides of ( [ sdot rep ] ) onto block @xmath65 gives the result @xmath84 here , @xmath85 is the projection of @xmath78 onto block @xmath65 ;",
    "i.e. , it is the column of @xmath86 that coincides with column @xmath87 of @xmath82 , as it passes through block @xmath65 .",
    "this means that the vectors @xmath85 , for @xmath88 , are the local vectors on the @xmath16 manifold , which are derived from the local distribution of @xmath89 in the same way that the @xmath63 were derived from the local distribution of @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , ( [ s(a)dot rep ] ) shows that each weight @xmath90 , appearing in the invariant representation of @xmath2 , is one of the weights in the invariant representation of the velocity of an isolated subsystem .",
    "notice that each time - dependent weight , @xmath90 , reflects the evolution of _ just one _ subsystem ; it does not contain information about the evolution of several subsystems .",
    "equation ( [ s(a)dot rep ] ) also shows that the time - dependent weights can be partitioned into subsets such as @xmath91 for @xmath88 , each of which describes the canonical representation of one subsystem s velocity .",
    "each of these subsets of time - dependent weights is statistically independent of the other subsets , and the weights within any of these subsets will usually be correlated with one another .",
    "because of the block - diagonality of @xmath55 in the @xmath11 coordinate system , it is apparent that each vector @xmath80 is directed along a subspace traversed by varying the state variables of one subsystem , while all other subsystems are held constant .",
    "it follows that the vectors @xmath63 are directed along the images of those subspaces in the @xmath4 coordinate system , and this property is heavily exploited below .",
    "it is interesting that the @xmath63 would not have this important property if the definition of @xmath55 ( see ( [ m definition 1 ] ) and ( [ m definition 2 ] ) ) was changed by replacing @xmath92 with higher order correlations ( e.g. , @xmath93 ) .",
    "if the data are separable , the weight components can be partitioned into two groups corresponding to independent ( possibly multidimensional ) subsystems , and these groups will be mutually uncorrelated . therefore , the next step is to determine if the weight components can be so partitioned . in principle",
    ", these groups should be required to factorize the density function of weights in @xmath94 or @xmath95 . in practice",
    ", one could simply look for groups of weight components that factorize lower order weight correlations . if it is found that the weight components can not be partitioned into two mutually uncorrelated groups , the data are inseparable ; i.e. , there is only one subsystem ( the system itself ) . on the other hand , if the weight components can be so partitioned , the measurements may or may not be separable .",
    "in the following paragraph : 1 ) it is assumed that there are one or more ways to partition the weights in this manner ; 2 ) the vectors @xmath63 are used to derive a function corresponding to each partitioning ; 3 ) it is shown that at least one of these must be a transformation to a separable coordinate system , if it exists . in principle , each of these functions can then be used to transform @xmath0 into the corresponding coordinate system , and the factorizability of the density function of the transformed data can be determined . in practice",
    ", it may suffice to determine the factorizability of lower order correlations of the transformed data .",
    "in any event , the measurements are separable if and only if at least one of the computed functions maps the data s density function into a factorizable form . if the data are found to be separable into two subsystems , the transformed data",
    "consists of two time series , each one describing the evolution of one subsystem .",
    "then , the above methodology can be applied to the time series of each subsystem in order to determine if it is separable into even smaller independent subsystems .",
    "as described above , in this paragraph , it is assumed that there are one or more ways to partition the weight components into two uncorrelated groups .",
    "then , this information is used to derive a set of functions , which must include a transformation to a separable coordinate system , if it exists . to do this ,",
    "suppose that the weights have been partitioned into two groups ( having @xmath96 and @xmath97 elements ) , which correspond to two independent subsystems . because of the block - diagonal structure of @xmath69 ( see ( [ block - diagonal ms ] ) ) , the vectors associated with either one of these groups are directed along subspaces created by varying the corresponding subsystem s state variable , while holding all other subsystems constant .",
    "these subspaces can be used to construct the mapping between the @xmath4 coordinate system and a separable coordinate system on state space .",
    "first , choose some point @xmath98 , and use the vectors in group @xmath32 to construct an @xmath99 subspace ( called the  first subspace of type @xmath32 `` ) , which contains points that can be reached by starting at @xmath98 and then varying @xmath100 , the state variable of subsystem @xmath32 .",
    "impose on this subspace some smoothly varying coordinates @xmath101 ( having components @xmath102 ) .",
    "next , at each point in this subspace , use the vectors in group @xmath103 to construct an @xmath104 subspace , which contains points that can be reached by starting at this point and then varying @xmath105 , the state variable of subsystem @xmath103 .",
    "each point in each one of these subspaces is assigned a constant value of @xmath101 : namely , the value of @xmath101 at the ' ' starting point `` in the first subspace of type @xmath32 . in the same way , construct an @xmath104 subspace ( called the ' ' first subspace of type @xmath103 ) , which contains points that can be reached by starting at @xmath98 and then varying @xmath105 .",
    "then , impose on this subspace some smoothly varying coordinate system @xmath106 ( having components @xmath107 ) .",
    "finally , at each point in this subspace , use the vectors in group @xmath32 to construct an @xmath99 subspace , which contains points that can be reached by starting at this point and then varying @xmath100 .",
    "each point in each one of these subspaces is assigned a constant value of @xmath106 : namely , the value of @xmath106 at the `` starting point '' in the first subspace of type @xmath103 . in this way , each point in the space is assigned values of both @xmath101 and @xmath106 , thereby defining a @xmath108 coordinate system .",
    "note that the @xmath109 coordinate system has been constructed so that subspaces having constant @xmath101 coincide with subspaces having constant @xmath100 .",
    "likewise , subspaces having constant @xmath106 coincide with subspaces having constant @xmath105 .",
    "this means that the @xmath109 coordinates are the same as the @xmath11 coordinates , except for transformations among the components of @xmath100 and transformations among the components of @xmath105 . because such subspace - wise transformations do not affect separability , @xmath109 must be a separable coordinate system , and , by construction , we know the transformation @xmath110 that maps the measurements onto these separable coordinates .",
    "now , consider the group of functions , which can be derived in this manner from each way of partitioning the weight components .",
    "the above result implies that the data are separable if and only if this group contains a transformation to a separable coordinate system .",
    "in this section , the new bss technique is illustrated by using it to disentangle nonlinear mixtures of the waveforms of two male speakers .",
    "each speaker read an english text , consisting of a thirty - second excerpt from one of two audio book recordings .",
    "the waveform of each speaker , @xmath111 ( for @xmath112 ) , was sampled 16,000 times per second with two bytes of depth .",
    "the thick gray lines in figure [ figure2 ] show the two speakers waveforms during a short ( 30 ms ) interval .",
    "these waveforms were then mixed by the nonlinear functions @xmath113 where @xmath114 .",
    "this is one of a variety of nonlinear mixing functions that were tried with similar results .",
    "the measurements , @xmath115 , were taken to be the variance - normalized , principal components of the sampled waveform mixtures , @xmath116 $ ] .",
    "figure [ fig_warped_grid ] shows how this nonlinear mixing maps an evenly - spaced cartesian grid in the @xmath11 coordinate system onto a warped grid in the @xmath4 coordinate system .",
    "figure [ fig_measurements ] shows a random subset of the measurements @xmath0 , and figure [ figure4 ] shows the time course of the measurements @xmath0 during the same short time interval depicted in figure [ figure2 ] .",
    "when either measured waveform , @xmath117 or @xmath118 , was played as an audio file , it sounded like a confusing superposition of two voices , which were quite difficult to understand .",
    "the entire set of 500,000 measurements , consisting of @xmath4 and @xmath2 at each sampled time , was sorted into a @xmath119 array of bins .",
    "then , the @xmath2 distribution in each bin was used to compute local velocity correlations ( see ( [ c2 definition ] ) and ( [ c4 definition ] ) ) , and these were used to derive @xmath55 and @xmath63 for each bin .",
    "figure [ fig_v ] shows these local vectors at each point .",
    "finally , ( [ xdot rep ] ) was used to transform the measurement velocity ( @xmath60 ) at each time into its coordinate - system - independent representation , given by the weights , @xmath90 .",
    "the thin black lines in figure [ figure5 ] show the time - dependent weights , which were derived from the waveform mixtures in figure [ figure4 ] , using ( [ xdot rep ] ) .",
    "the thick gray lines in figure [ figure5 ] show the time - dependent weights , which were derived directly from each of the unmixed waveforms in figure [ figure2 ] , using ( [ s(a)dot rep ] ) .",
    "notice that the weights , derived from the mixed and unmixed waveforms , are nearly the same , despite the fact that these waveforms differed significantly because of nonlinear mixing ( e.g. , compare figures [ figure4 ] and [ figure2 ] ) .",
    "this illustrates the coordinate - system - independence of the weight time series .",
    "the correlation between the two weight time series , @xmath120 and @xmath121 , was quite small ( namely , -0.0016 ) . in order to determine",
    "if these weights correspond to completely separable subsystems , the vectors associated with these two weights were used to construct the putative coordinate transformation , @xmath110 . as described in method ,",
    "this was done by using these vectors to construct a family of lines having constant values of @xmath122 , together with a family of lines having constant values of @xmath123 .",
    "the thin black lines in figure [ fig_warped_grid ] depict these lines for evenly space values of @xmath122 and @xmath123 .",
    "the function , @xmath110 , defined by these curves was the only possible transformation to a separable coordinate system .",
    "as in method , the separability of the data could be determined by using this function to transform @xmath0 into the @xmath109 coordinate system and by verifying that @xmath124 $ ] has a factorizable density function ( or factorizable correlation functions ) .    in this illustrative example ,",
    "the separability of the data in the @xmath109 coordinate system was verified by showing that the @xmath109 and @xmath11 coordinate systems differed by component - wise transformations , which do not affect separability .",
    "this was done by comparing the lines of constant @xmath122 and @xmath123 to lines of constant @xmath125 and @xmath126 , which are the thin black and thick gray lines , respectively , in figure [ fig_warped_grid ] . notice the near coincidence of the families of lines of constant @xmath122 ( or @xmath123 ) and the families of lines with constant @xmath125 ( or @xmath126 ) .",
    "this demonstrates that the @xmath109 and @xmath11 coordinate systems differ by component - wise transformations of the form : @xmath127 where @xmath128 and @xmath129 are monotonic . because the data are separable in the @xmath11",
    "coordinate system and because component - wise transformations do not affect separability , the data must also be separable in the @xmath109 coordinate system .",
    "therefore , we have accomplished the objectives of bss : namely , by blindly processing the data @xmath0 , we have determined that the system is separable , and we have computed the transformation , @xmath110 , to a separable coordinate system .",
    "the transformation @xmath110 can be applied to the data @xmath0 to recover the original unmixed waveforms , up to component - wise transformations .",
    "the resulting waveforms , @xmath130 $ ] and @xmath131 $ ] , are depicted by the thin black lines in figure [ figure2 ] , which also shows the trajectory of the unmixed waveforms in the @xmath11 coordinate system .",
    "notice that the two trajectories , @xmath124 $ ] and @xmath9 , are similar except for component - wise transformations along the two axes .",
    "the component - wise transformation is especially noticeable as a stretching of @xmath9 with respect to @xmath124 $ ] along the positive @xmath126 axis .",
    "when each of the recovered waveforms , @xmath130 $ ] and @xmath131 $ ] , was played as an audio file , it sounded like a completely intelligible recording of one of the speakers . in each case , the other speaker was not heard , except for a faint  buzzing \" sound in the background .",
    "therefore , the component - wise transformations , which related the recovered waveforms to the original unmixed waveforms , did not noticeably reduce intelligibility .",
    "this paper describes how to determine if time - dependent signal measurements , @xmath0 , are comprised of linear or nonlinear mixtures of the state variables of statistically - independent subsystems .",
    "first , the local distribution of measurement velocities , @xmath2 , is used to construct local vectors at each point @xmath4 .",
    "if the data are separable , each of these vectors is directed along a subspace traversed by varying the state variable of one subsystem , while all other subsystems are kept constant .",
    "because of this property , these vectors can be used to derive a finite set of functions , @xmath110 , which must include the transformation to a separable coordinate system , if it exists .",
    "therefore , separability can be determined by testing the separability of the data , after it has been transformed by each of these mappings .",
    "furthermore , if the data are separable , we can recover a time series that describes the evolution of each subsystem .",
    "therefore , nonlinear blind source separation has been accomplished .    some comments on this result :    1 .",
    "the time - dependent weights are independent of the choice of sensors used to observe the underlying physical process , and in that sense they comprise an intrinsic or ",
    "inner \" property of that process . to see this , note that different sets of sensors detect different mixtures of signals from that process , and different signal mixtures simply describe the system s state in different coordinate systems . because the weights are scalars ( up to permutations and/or reflections ) , they are independent of the nature of the coordinate system in which they are derived",
    ". therefore , they are also independent of the observer s choice of sensors , as asserted above .",
    "this type of sensor - independent signal representation should be contrasted with conventional signal representations , which contain mixtures of information about the sensors , together with information intrinsic to the underlying processes .",
    "2 .   this paper shows how to perform nonlinear bss for the case in which the measurements are invertibly related to the state variables of the underlying system .",
    "invertibility can almost be guaranteed by observing the system with a sufficiently large number of independent sensors : specifically , by utilizing at least @xmath132 independent sensors , where @xmath3 is the dimension of the system s state space . in this case",
    ", the sensors output lies in an @xmath133 subspace within a space of at least @xmath132 dimensions .",
    "dimensional reduction techniques ( e.g. , @xcite ) can be used to find the subspace coordinates corresponding to the sensor outputs . because an embedding theorem asserts that this subspace is very unlikely to self - intersect ( @xcite ) , the coordinates on this subspace constitute synthetic  measurements \" that are almost certainly invertibly related to the system s state space . in other words ,",
    "suitable synthetic measurements can be found by adding more and more sensors until the number of sensors is more than twice the dimensionality ( @xmath3 ) of the subspace containing the sensors outputs .",
    "theoretically , the proposed method can be applied to measurements described by any diffeomorphic mixing function . however , in practice , more data will have to be analyzed in order to handle mixing functions with more pronounced nonlinearities .",
    "this is because rapidly varying mixing functions may cause the local vectors ( @xmath63 ) to vary rapidly in the measurement coordinate system , and , therefore , it will be necessary to compute those vectors in numerous small neighborhoods .",
    "4 .   more data will also be required to apply this method to state spaces having higher dimensions . in experiments ,",
    "thirty seconds of data ( 500,000 samples ) were used to recover two waveforms from measurements of two nonlinear mixtures . in other experiments , approximately six minutes of data ( 6,000,000 samples ) were used to cleanly recover the waveforms of four sound sources ( two speakers and two piano performances ) from four signal mixtures . as expected , blind separation of the 4d state space did require more data , but it was not a prohibitive amount .",
    "the method does not require a lot of computational resources . in any event , the most computationally expensive tasks are the binning of the measurement data and the computation of the local vectors , @xmath63 , in each bin .",
    "if necessary , these calculations can be parallelized across multiple cpus .",
