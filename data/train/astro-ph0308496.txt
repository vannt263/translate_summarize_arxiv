    "high spatial resolution surveys allow for the detection of faint companions such as very low mass ( vlm ) stars , brown dwarfs , and possibly giant planets .",
    "these surveys also tell us something about the frequency of binary systems , their separations , mass ratios , and the variation in these parameters as a function of the primary s mass . together",
    "they help place empirical constraints on binary star formation mechanisms .    many of the statistical studies on binaries have concentrated on field stars in the immediate solar vicinity .",
    "@xcite conducted a spectroscopic survey of g - dwarfs and estimated a multiplicity fraction of approximately 50@xmath16 at separations greater than 3au .",
    "proceeding down the main sequence at similar separations , the fraction appears to drop monotonically : @xmath12 for m0-m4 dwarfs @xcite , @xmath17 for m8.0-l0.5 @xcite , @xmath18 - 15@xmath16 for l dwarfs @xcite , and @xmath19 for t dwarfs @xcite . from the same surveys",
    ", semimajor - axis separations also appear to be a function of primary mass .",
    "while g and early m dwarfs ( m0-m4 ) show broad separation peaks of @xmath9au , late m ( @xmath20m8 ) , l , and t dwarfs appear to have separations closer to @xmath21 - 5au .",
    "as also noted in the above references , evidence suggests that both the binary fraction _ and _ mean semimajor axis are functions of primary mass .    as part of a larger survey @xcite , we sample here a portion of the m dwarf spectral range not previously surveyed , namely m6.0-m7.5 .",
    "we measure the binary frequency , binary separations , and mass ratios comparing the results to stars slightly more and less massive .",
    "the adaptive optics ( ao ) techniques used to make our observations and the 3 newly discovered binaries : lp415 - 20 , lp475 - 855 , and 2massw j1750129 + 442404 are discussed in the following section while in  3 we present our data reduction techniques .",
    "the two lp objects are suspected hyades cluster members and we examine their membership probabilities in  4 along with the systems derived characteristics such as distances , ages , temperatures , spectral types , and masses .",
    "we conclude by discussing the binary frequency and separation distribution of m6.0-m7.5 dwarfs in  5 .",
    "in 2001 , we commenced the first ground - based , ao infrared survey searching for faint companions ( giant planets , brown dwarfs , and vlm@xmath220.185m@xmath15 . ] stars ) around vlm stars at the gemini north telescope .",
    "the survey strategy combines 4 observational advantages : 1 ) the low luminosity of vlm stars , 2 ) the near diffraction - limited resolution ( @xmath23 ) of ao in the near - ir ( nir ; 1 - 2.5 @xmath24 m ) , 3 ) high sensitivity to cool objects in the nir , 4 ) a large aperture telescope .",
    "the overall survey targets m6.0-l0.5 dwarf objects with k@xmath25 from mainly 2mass stars listed in cruz et al .",
    "2003 ( in preparation ) , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . to date , we have observed 69 of these objects detecting 12 binary systems , 10 of which are newly discovered .",
    "in @xcite we presented a summary of our initial findings targetting m8.0-m9.5 stars : 20 objects observed , 4 binary systems discovered , with at least one of the four companions most likely a brown dwarf with spectral type @xmath26l7 .",
    "@xcite presented the tightest ( 3au ) brown dwarf ( @xmath26l7.5 ) ever imaged around a star , lhs 2397a .",
    "@xcite summarize the whole survey and discuss implications for brown dwarf / vlm binary formation theory . here",
    "we present , in detail , the results from a subset of our survey targetting 30 m6.0-m7.5 stars .",
    "the selection constraints of our observed objects , mainly from @xcite , are galactic latitude b @xmath27 ( for 0@xmath284.5 hours , @xmath29 ) and k@xmath30@xmath2212 .",
    "one of the challenges when utilizing ao is locating sufficiently bright guide stars close enough to one s scientific object such that the isoplanatic error does not reduce the strehl ratio to unusable levels .",
    "when observing @xmath31 out of the galactic plane , as we are here , the challenge becomes even more significant since there are even fewer bright natural guide stars ( v@xmath2216 ) .",
    "thus the capability of guiding an ao system directly on one s target object in the absence of bright natural or artificial guide stars becomes an important scientific capability .",
    "however , if the science object itself is a very faint vlm star ( v@xmath32 , i=14 - 16 ) , locking an ao system may be quite difficult .",
    "most ao systems can not guide on such faint targets . as explained elsewhere",
    "@xcite , working exceptions are curvature - based ao systems which employ red - sensitive , photon - counting , avalanche photodiodes ( apds ) with effectively zero read - noise in their wavefront sensors .",
    "we utilized the recently decomissioned university of hawaii curvature ao system hokupaa @xcite which was a visitor instrument on the 8 m gemini north telescope .",
    "hokupaa is a highly sensitive curvature ao system and well suited to guiding on nearby , faint , late - type m stars producing @xmath33 images at k@xmath34 band .",
    "this capability has allowed us to survey the nearest late m and early l stars in order to characterize their binary nature and search for vlm stellar and substellar companions .",
    "two of the discovery binaries in this paper , lp415 - 20 and lp475 - 855 , both had v magnitudes of 19.2 ( * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* respectively ) .",
    "the m6.0-m7.5 survey was conducted during 4 observing runs in 2001 and 2002 at the gemini north telescope on mauna kea .",
    "a total of 30 objects were observed and 3 new binary systems were discovered .",
    "table [ tbl-1 ] lists the objects observed with no likely physical companion detections between 0.1@xmath1 - 15@xmath1 ( @xmath35 - 300au ) .",
    "table [ tbl-2 ] lists the 3 newly discovered binary systems , their photometry , and the dates observed .",
    "each of the observations were made by dithering over 4 different positions on the university of hawaii s quick ir camera ( quirc ) containing a 1024@xmath361024 infrared array detector with a platescale of 0.0199/ pixel @xcite . at each dither position we took 3@xmath3610s exposures at j , h , k@xmath37 bands and longer 3@xmath3630s exposures at h to improve the detection sensitivity of faint companions .",
    "each object was additionally analyzed within its halo for even nearer , very faint companion objects as explained in the following section .",
    "the images were reduced using an ao data reduction pipeline written in the iraf language as described in @xcite . unlike conventional nir photometry , we purposefully disabled the cassegrain rotator so that the pupil image remained fixed with respect to the camera and detector . the residual psf aberrations including telescope primary and secondary structures remained static and fixed in the final images , allowing for comparative identification of companions without confusion from the rotation of psf artifacts .",
    "the pipeline compensates for this in the final images by rotating each image by the parallactic angle as described in @xcite .",
    "the pipeline produces final unsaturated 120s exposures in three nir bandpasses : j ( fwhm @xmath38 ) , h ( fwhm @xmath39 ) , and k@xmath37 ( fwhm @xmath40 ) with deep 360s exposures ( fwhm @xmath41 ) at h band for each observed binary system . the dithering of the shorter exposures produces a final 30@xmath42 image with the most sensitive overlap region ( 10@xmath43 ) centered on the binary . a technique that we used to search for tight companions potentially orbiting within the halo of the primary involved fourier filtering the low spatial frequency components leaving behind only high frequency residuals in the psf . with",
    "the cassegrain rotator disengaged , potential companions within the halo could have been easily differentiated from psf artifacts .",
    "however , no very faint companions were found in the halo of our primaries using this technique .",
    "all 3 binary systems were detected from reductions of the shorter exposures .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows k@xmath37 images of each of the new systems .",
    "photometry was performed using the daophot psf fitting photometry package in iraf .",
    "the psfs used were reduced 12@xmath3610s unsaturated single stars observed during the same night with similar ir brightness , spectral type , and air mass .",
    "adjustments to the psf were made in some cases to match slight psf elongations due to the ao system .",
    "this technique was successfully employed for the data reduction of the 0.29@xmath1 separated lp475 - 855 and the k@xmath37 images of each of the 2 tightly separated lp systems .",
    "the errors in @xmath3mag are the differences in the photometry between 2 similar psf stars .",
    "daophot could not successfully separate the two blended components of lp415 - 20 and 2m1750 in the j and h bands due to the lower strehl ratios of the ao system at these shorter wavelengths .",
    "instead , we use a technique applied by @xcite which uses the annulus photometry task _ phot _ on the images that have had their low spatial frequencies previously removed .",
    "this purely differential technique preserves the relative magnitude difference while removing sufficient primary halo flux to reveal the companions clearly seen in k@xmath37 .",
    "the technique gave reliable @xmath3mags and was verified on binary images with known @xmath3mags with , however , increased photometric uncertainties of about 0.10 mag .",
    "we calculate individual fluxes and their uncertainties from the measured flux ratios of the binaries and the integrated 2mass apparent magnitudes @xcite , along with their respective uncertainties . in order to work with the 2mass blended k@xmath30 photometry",
    "we seek a conversion from @xmath3k@xmath34 to @xmath3k@xmath30 .",
    "we find @xmath3k@xmath44k@xmath30 to within 0.02 mag for @xmath45(j - k@xmath30)@xmath462.0 according to the models of @xcite for objects between 0.05 - 0.10m@xmath15 .",
    "hence , we simply assume @xmath3k@xmath34=@xmath3k@xmath30 .",
    "table 3 lists the photometry and derived characteristics of the new binary systems .",
    "overall uncertainty in the flux includes this @xmath3mag error along with the 2mass error for the integrated image per bandpass .",
    "the platescale and orientation of the ir camera were determined from a short exposure of the trapezium cluster in orion and compared to published positions @xcite . from these observations",
    "a platescale of @xmath47/pix and an orientation of the y - axis ( @xmath48 degrees e of north ) was determined .",
    "our target list consists mainly of objects @xmath27 above the galactic plane so we did not expect to observe many background stars in our images . from the 69 objects already observed in the total survey ( @xmath49 square arcsec ) , we did not detect any additional ( j - k@xmath50 mag ( background ) objects in any of the fields .",
    "thus the probability of a chance projection of an object within 0.5@xmath1 of the primary is estimated to be @xmath51 . furthermore , if we consider the possibility that our apparent companions are actually background m6-m8 dwarfs fainter by a @xmath3 magnitude of 1.5 mag ( ie .",
    "they are twice as distant as their primaries ) , we estimate the probability of a background m6-m8 ( with a stellar density of 0.007/pc@xmath52 ; @xcite ) appearing within @xmath53 of any of our 30 targets to be @xmath54 .",
    "additionally , none of the companion images appear spatially extended as might be expected for background galaxies .",
    "therefore , we conclude that all three very red objects are physically associated with their primaries and hereafter will refer to them as lp415 - 20b , lp475 - 855b , and 2masswj1750129 + 442404b ( 2m1750b , hereafter ) .      with none of the 3 binary systems having published trigonometric parallaxes",
    ", we estimate photometric distances based on trigonometric parallaxes of other nearby vlm stars @xcite .",
    "we construct a color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) of m6.5-l1 stars in figure [ fig6 ] using 2mass photometry and parallaxes from @xcite .",
    "we cut the fit at m6.5 based on evidence in the dahn/2mass photometry of an upward break just blueward of j - k@xmath55 .",
    "@xcite show similar evidence in their figure 1 for hyades members as do @xcite . in figure [ fig4 ]",
    "we overplot our cmd from figure [ fig6 ] onto a cmd of the faintest candidate low mass hyads from @xcite .",
    "the @xcite/2mass data match very well with the @xcite hyades results redward of @xmath56mag . with all our binary components having j - k@xmath57 , we believe that the linear fit of figure [ fig6 ] redward of j - k@xmath55 to be justified for either field or apparent hyades members as well .",
    "this also suggests that the differences in the cmd for the hyades and other field stars due to astrophysical effects ( age , metallicity , log(g ) , etc . )",
    "are less than our observational errors .",
    "we find ( fig . [ fig6 ] ) a linear least - squares fit of m@xmath58(j - k@xmath59 for the spectral range m6.5-l1 .",
    "the rms scatter in m@xmath60 is 0.33 mag which when taken in quadrature with the uncertainty in the photometry gives the overall m@xmath60 error .",
    "the result is nearly identical to the cmd fit of @xcite using parallaxes of late m dwarfs .",
    "we then use the distance modulus of the primary to estimate the distances to the binaries .",
    "this method estimates photometric distances of @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 pc for lp415 - 20a , lp475 - 855a , and 2m1750a , respectively ( table [ tbl-3 ] ) .    before we commence an analysis of the ages , temperatures , spectral types , and masses of these new objects , we consider the possibility that 2 of the discovered binaries are members of the hyades open cluster .",
    "assigning cluster membership is quite valuable in that it provides credible ages and abundances . in turn ,",
    "known ages place tighter constraints on estimated temperatures and masses using theoretical evolutionary tracks .",
    "lp415 - 20 and lp475 - 855 are only offset by approximately 3@xmath64 from the cluster center which is well within the @xmath65 tidal radius of the cluster .",
    "furthermore , 95@xmath16 of 190 cluster members from a hipparcos study of the hyades @xcite have trigonometric distances between 25 and 73pc .",
    "lp415 - 20 and lp475 - 855 have photometric distances of @xmath61 and @xmath62pc , respectively .",
    "we examine further the membership probabilities of these two objects in the next section .",
    "two of our objects , lp415 - 20 and lp475 - 855 , have been previously discussed in the literature as candidate hyades members ( lp415 - 20=bryja262 ; @xcite ; lp475 - 855=[lhd]042614 + 13312=2masswj0429028 + 133759 ; @xcite ) with varying conclusions over their membership .",
    "classifying individual objects as _ bona fide _ cluster members is often problematic , especially in a nearby open cluster such as the hyades whose proximity ( mean distance @xmath66pc ) means that it occupies more than 200 square degrees of sky . besides the proximity in the sky to the cluster center and consistent distances , we consider several additional factors in evaluating if these two objects are members of the hyades : 1 ) proper motions , 2 ) cluster membership probabilities , 3 ) radial velocities , and 4 ) nir photometry .",
    "when we compare the proper motions and radial velocities of lp415 - 20 and lp475 - 855 to that of the hyades , we find it useful to have a kinematic model for field stars to which we can compare them .",
    "we generate a monte carlo simulation of 100,000 synthetic stars with the kinematic properties of ultracool m dwarfs ( spt@xmath20m7 ) at the positions and photometric distances ( @xmath2630 pc ) of the 2 candidate systems , lp415 - 20 and lp475 - 855 .",
    "for our kinematic model , we use the velocity ellipsoid for ultracool m dwarfs given by reid et al.(2002 ; eq.2 ) .",
    "this defines a local standard of rest ( lsr ) for ultracool dwarfs as well as a 3d velocity dispersion .",
    "the likelihood of membership is best judged when all factors are evaluated collectively .",
    "we discuss each of them and list both measured data from the literature and predicted quantities for hyades members in table [ tbl-4 ] .",
    "we show in figure [ fig2 ] a proper motion vector diagram showing the proper motions of both candidate objects @xcite along with the proper motions of tycho-2 catalogue stars @xcite within 5@xmath64 .",
    "the outlined sectors represent the regions where the proper motions of hyades cluster members are expected to lie according to @xcite - between 90@xmath64 and 135@xmath64 east of north and proper motions in the range 74 - 140 mas / yr . the proper motions of lp415 - 20 and lp475 - 855 fall within this proper motion space while the majority of field stars covers a distinctively different portion of proper motion space .    what do the proper motions of field late - m stars look like with respect to the positions of the 2 lp objects in figure [ fig2 ] ?",
    "the proper motion of the mean space motion ( lsr ) of ultracool dwarfs as a function of distance is shown as a diagonal line ( solar reflex motion ) .",
    "the centroid of the proper motion distribution of 100,000 ultracool m dwarfs from our simulation ( large open circles ) is the lsr motion at the photometric distances for lp415 - 20 and lp475 - 855 .",
    "hence , the lsr is located in a distinctively different portion of proper motion space from the lp stars and hyades loci . in the next section",
    ", we will attempt to quantify the probability of a field star moving at this solar reflex motion is a member of the hyades using the moving cluster method .",
    "convergent point analysis selects cluster members based on proper motions and positions without any assumptions of their spatial distribution .",
    "therefore , the technique can identify moving groups which share a constant velocity vector .",
    "however , a star moving towards a cluster convergent point does not prove cluster membership but a non - converging motion can exclude it .",
    "we transform the equatorial proper motion components ( @xmath67 ) for our objects to the proper motion towards the hyades convergent point ( @xmath68 ) and perpendicular to the convergent point - star great circle ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "the orthogonal component @xmath69 can be considered a rough indicator of the relative probability of cluster membership whereby the larger the absolute value of @xmath69 , the lower the likelihood of membership . to estimate membership probabilities",
    ", we use the formulae from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq .  23 and those in @xmath70 ) , the @xcite hyades convergent point solution @xmath71,@xmath72=(@xmath73 , s@xmath74=46.38 km / s , v@xmath75=0.3 km / s , and proper motion uncertainties of 10mas / yr in @xmath76 and @xmath77 for the 2 lp objects ( j. gizis , private communication ) .",
    "we calculate membership probabilities for lp415 - 20 and lp475 - 855 of 90@xmath16 and 98@xmath16 , respectively .",
    "@xcite assigned lp415 - 20 a 15 - 50@xmath16 membership probability but using a pre - hipparcos convergent point solution for the hyades .    quantifying the discussion from the previous section , hypothetical field stars at the positions of lp415 - 20 and lp475 - 855 at the photometric distance ( @xmath9pc ) moving with the lsr for ultracool dwarfs would have hyades membership probabilities of well under 1@xmath16 ( 10@xmath78 ) .",
    "we find that only 2.5@xmath16 and 2.4@xmath16 of the monte carlo sample of ultracool m dwarf field stars have membership probabilities higher than 90@xmath16 , for lp415 - 20 and lp475 - 855 , respectively .",
    "the moving cluster method also predicts radial velocities for cluster members . using the positions of our binary systems and the hyades convergent point solution , the method predicts @xmath79 km / s and @xmath80 km / s for lp415 - 20 and lp475 - 855 , respectively .",
    "the uncertainty in radial velocities is due to just the internal velocity dispersion following @xcite .",

    "measured @xmath83 km / s for lp475 - 855 .",
    "the values are not inconsistent with cluster membership , especially if orbital motions are considered ( the radial velocity amplitude of the primary is of order 2 - 3km / s using the masses we derive in  4.5 ) .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows a predicted radial velocity distribution along the line of sight of the hyades for an m - dwarf sample as calculated by @xcite . within this distribution , @xcite find a narrow range of radial velocities for known low mass hyades .",
    "the measured radial velocities of the two candidate objects fall in this range of radial velocities for hyades members .    quantifying this",
    "further we ask : what fraction of field stars have radial velocities within a given threshold of the predicted hyades velocity ?",
    "our monte carlo simulation shows that only 12@xmath16 of ultracool m - dwarf field stars would have radial velocities within @xmath84km / s of the hyades mean .",
    "the uncertainty in our predicted radial velocities are mostly in the internal velocity dispersion of the cluster and is relatively insensitive to variations in the assumed distances , the observational radial velocity errors ( 2 - 4km / s ) , and the proper motion uncertainties .",

    "the average proper motion of stars in the taurus - auriga molecular clouds is ( @xmath90 , @xmath91 ) = ( + 4 , -17 ) mas / yr @xcite while lp415 - 20 and lp475 - 855 have proper motions of ( + 127 , -36 ) mas / yr and ( + 103 , -16 ) mas / yr , respectively @xcite .",
    "not only are the proper motions nearly an order of magnitude too high , but their velocity direction is nearly 90@xmath64 off .",

    "the greater distances are both within @xmath94 of the photometric - derived distances and may be due to a potential underestimation of the photometric distances in the m@xmath60 upturn shown in figure [ fig4 ] . while these larger distances are statistically consistent with the photometric distances , they correspond to more luminous primaries ( m@xmath60=9.1 and 8.8 mag for lp415 - 20 and lp475 - 855 , respectively ) .",

    "we also utilize the dusty evolutionary tracks @xcite to estimate the component masses of the three binary systems ( see figures 7 - 9 ) .",
    "the tracks provide theoretical estimates for both stellar and substellar masses as a function of both absolute k@xmath30 magnitude and age .",
    "the tracks are calibrated for the k@xmath30 bandpass ( i. baraffe , private communication ) and we slightly extrapolate the isochrones from 0.10 to 0.11m@xmath7 to estimate the upper mass limits of the primaries .",
    "a primary s mass is estimated knowing both its age and absolute k@xmath30 .",
    "the companion s absolute magnitude is simply determined by adding the measured @xmath3k@xmath30 to its primary s m@xmath60 .",
    "the crosses indicate the best estimates of where the binary components lie on the tracks and their uncertainties are represented by the shaded regions .",
    "the primary s region of uncertainty is indicated in bold outline and the companion s is dashed .",
    "note that their uncertainty regions overlap .",
    "the maximum mass is related to the minimum m@xmath60 at the oldest possible age ; the minimum mass is related to the maximum m@xmath60 at the youngest possible age .",
    "the uncertainty in the masses is largely due to both the uncertainty in the j band photometry , where the ao s resolution was poorest , and the error ( @xmath88=0.33 mag ) in our cmd linear fit from figure [ fig6 ] .",
    "the uncertainty in j band photometry propagates as error in the j - k@xmath30 color and hence in the m@xmath60 determination .",
    "table [ tbl-3 ] lists the estimated masses for all 3 binary systems .",
    "all 3 systems primary masses are consistent with m7-type dwarfs and their secondaries all appear stellar , however , their uncertainties extend into the substellar region . the extended regions of uncertainty reinforce the need for trigonometric parallaxes of these objects .",
    "lp415 - 20b and lp475 - 855b are among the lowest mass objects spatially resolved to date in the hyades with best estimate masses of 0.081@xmath101m@xmath15 and 0.082@xmath102m@xmath15 , respectively ( there is a @xmath260.25mas spectroscopic brown dwarf candidate companion rhy 403b discussed in @xcite and a 0.04m@xmath15 brown dwarf candidate companion of v471 tauri @xcite ; lh0418 + 13 is estimated at 0.083m@xmath15 in @xcite ) .",
    "additionally , the lp415 - 20 system would be the tightest system resolved to date in the cluster with a projected separation of @xmath103au .",
    "the tightest known binaries in the hyades are the 2 confirmed spectroscopic binaries from @xcite , rhy42 and rhy403 , with semimajor axis of 0.61 and 0.0047au , respectively .",
    "the tightest resolved binary in the hyades was previously rhy371 , 6.8au , observed by hst @xcite .",
    "one of the goals of our overall survey is to characterize the multiplicity of late m stars .",
    "@xcite report a binary fraction of @xmath104 for m8.0-l0.5 binaries with separations @xmath105 au .",
    "complimenting their spectral type range , we present here the results from the largest flux limited ( k@xmath25 ) high - resolution imaging survey of m6.0-m7.5 primaries . from a sample of 30 target objects",
    "we have spatially resolved 3 systems that have companions . in order to estimate the binary fraction over this spectral range we examine two different techniques - malmquist bias adjustment and flux ratio distribution limits .",
    "we attempt to compensate for the leakage of equal magnitude binaries into our sample from further distances .",
    "the number of stars in the sample is adjusted upward by the ratio between the volume containing approximately 95% of our detected binaries and the volume containing approximately 95% of our target objects so as to compensate for fainter single stars that were not originally included .",
    "this results in a scaling factor of @xmath106=2.09 .",
    "this gives a malmquist corrected binary frequency of @xmath107 with a poisson uncertainty of @xmath108 .",
    "@xcite explored the limiting cases of the ratio of flux distributions emitted from binary stars for a magnitude - limited sample like ours . using an observed uncorrected binary fraction of 0.1 ( 3/30 )",
    ", we consider 2 limiting cases for the flux ratio @xmath109 distribution : 1 ) all the binary systems are of equal magnitude @xmath110 resulting in a binary fraction of @xmath111 ; 2 ) the flux ratio distribution is flat and the binary fraction rises to @xmath112 .",
    "this results in a binary frequency range of @xmath113 which is consistent with the @xmath114 we estimated when correcting for the malmquist bias . @xcite",
    "derive a more accurate estimate of uncertainty for small samples using the binomial distribution .",
    "in this case the binary fraction is 5@xmath10 ( a. burgasser , private communication ) . _",
    "hence we conclude that for binaries with separations 3au@xmath22a@xmath115300au the m6.0-m7.5 binary frequency is within the range 5@xmath10_.    this result is significantly lower than the @xmath12 observed for earlier m0-m4 dwarfs @xcite but more comparable with the 15@xmath116 for later m8.0/early l @xcite , 10 - 15@xmath16 and 15@xmath117 for l dwarfs ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* respectively ) and 9@xmath118 for t dwarfs @xcite .",
    "our binary fraction is also comparable to open cluster surveys of m dwarfs in the hyades ( 11@xmath117 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and brown dwarfs in the pleiades ( 15@xmath119 ; * ? ? ?",
    "we note the peculiar result of @xcite who predict binary frequencies of @xmath120 for ultracool m dwarfs in the pleiades and praesepe open clusters using over - luminous positions on nir cmds to predict multiplicity .",
    "they claim the missing binaries have not been detected in the other surveys because the systems ,  la ppl15 @xcite , are spectroscopic ( a@xmath121au ) and beyond the resolution limit .",
    "however , @xcite conducted a spectroscopic binary survey of field m dwarfs and found 2 out of 36 targets .",
    "this implies a bias - corrected fraction of only 3@xmath122 @xcite .",
    "is there a possible explanation for our lower result , 5@xmath10 , besides small number statistics ?",
    "over as narrow a spectral range as we have here , could there have been conditions in the local star formation process that led to a shortage of certain binary masses ?",
    "we are more inclined to believe that these results are largely influenced by small number statistics and that our results are statistically consistent to within 1.5@xmath88 of the later objects .",
    "_ we conclude , therefore , that for binary systems with separations 3au@xmath22a@xmath115300au the m6.0-m7.5 binary frequency from our survey , while only within the range 5@xmath10 , is statistically consistent with less massive m , l , and t stars and significantly less common than that of g and early m stars .",
    "_      even though our survey is sensitive out to 10@xmath1 ( @xmath123 au ) , all 3 observed binary systems had projected separations @xmath124 ( 3 - 9au ) apart .",
    "we do not detect any wide ( @xmath125au ) vlm binary systems in our sample .",
    "consequently , this rules out a sensitivity selection effect .",
    "this is consistent , and apparently without exception , in 31 other vlm binaries from several researchers as recorded in table 4 of @xcite and 3 recent brown dwarf binary discoveries in the pleiades @xcite .",
    "sensitive to only 14au , this may explain why @xcite found no hyades brown dwarf binary systems from 53 hst pc observations .",
    "when we compare binary surveys that are sensitive to separations @xmath202au , there is consistency between the median separation of our 3 new binaries ( 5au ) and the peak distribution ( @xmath262 - 5 au ) of late m",
    "/ early l binaries @xcite , l dwarfs @xcite , and t dwarfs @xcite .",
    "going towards earlier spectral types there appears to be an increase in the semimajor axis separation . @xcite and",
    "@xcite show a broad separation peak of @xmath9  au for early m and g dwarfs , respectively .",
    "_ we conclude that the semimajor axes of m6.0-m7.5 binaries appear consistent with those of late m , l , and t dwarf systems but are significantly smaller on average than early m and g stars .",
    "_    the difference between the separation distributions of these vlm binaries and more massive binary systems suggests that there may be important differences in their formation and evolution processes as well .",
    "this is further supported by the observed preference of equal - mass systems ( q@xmath1260.7 ) as seen in this paper and for all the vlm binaries @xcite as compared to the flatter distributions of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "ejection models @xcite , high - resolution hydrodynamical simulations @xcite , collapsing turbulent molecular clouds @xcite , and multi - body decay models @xcite have not been able to predict both the @xmath2615@xmath16 vlm binary fractions observed _ and _ the @xmath2660@xmath16 binary fraction for the more massive @xmath26g - type stars . our results reported here hope to add to the constraints of these and future formation and evolutionary models .",
    "we have conducted the largest survey of nearby m6.0-m7.5 dwarfs with k@xmath25 mag using the ao system hokupaa at the gemini north telescope .",
    "the survey consisted of 30 stars and discovered 3 new binary systems with relatively equal mass components ( q@xmath127 ) and close projected separations of 0.12 - 0.29@xmath1 ( 3 - 10au ) . while none of the binaries have been confirmed by common proper motions , they are very likely to be bound based on space density arguments .",
    "we have used various astrometric , observational , and statistical arguments to characterize the vlm binary frequencies and separations that contribute additional empirical constraints to binary formation mechanisms :    * we estimate the binary frequency of spectral type m6.0-m7.5 main sequence stars for separations 3au@xmath22a@xmath115300au from this survey to be 5@xmath10 .",
    "the figure is lower than , but statistically consistent with , slightly later type m , l , and t dwarfs to within 1.5@xmath88 .",
    "however , the frequency is less than that measured in studies of earlier m and g dwarfs . * the separations of the 3 systems are all @xmath128 au and consistent with the separations of later type m and l dwarfs ( separation peak @xmath21 - 5au ) .",
    "this is in stark contrast with the broad peak separations of @xmath9 au for the more massive m and g binaries .",
    "* two of the new systems are probable hyades cluster members based on proper motions , moving cluster membership probabilities , radial velocities , and photometry .",
    "lp415 - 20 and lp475 - 855 have hyades membership probabilities of 90@xmath16 and 98@xmath16 , respectively .",
    "our simulations show that only @xmath97 of ultracool field m dwarfs at the photometric distances of the lp stars would have both hyades membership probabilities @xmath12990@xmath16 and radial velocities within 5km / s of the hyades mean value . both lp stars satisfy these criteria .",
    "* triginometric distances would settle the question of membership .",
    "assuming membership , the lp415 - 20 system is the tightest spatially resolved binary to date in the hyades cluster with a projected separation of @xmath103 au and the companions to lp415 - 20 and lp475 - 855 are among the lowest mass objects resolved to date in the cluster ( 0.081@xmath101m@xmath15 and 0.082@xmath102m@xmath15 , respectively ) .",
