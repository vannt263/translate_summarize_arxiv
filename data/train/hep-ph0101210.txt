    "there is still no fundamental physical theory of the very early universe which addresses issues that arise from the regime of transplanckian physics .",
    "one of these issues relates to the origin of the cosmological perturbation spectrum . in an expanding universe ,",
    "the physical momentum gets blue - shifted back in time , therefore the observed low values of the momentum today that contribute to the cmbr spectrum may have originated from values larger than the planck mass @xmath4 in the early universe .",
    "this is similar to the problems that arise in trying to explain the origin of hawking radiation in black hole physics . in a series of papers @xcite",
    ", it was demonstrated that the hawking radiation remains unaffected by modifications of the ultra high energy regime , expressed through the modification of the usual linear dispersion relation at energies larger than a certain ultraviolet scale @xmath5 . following a similar procedure , in the case of an expanding friedmann - lemaitre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) spacetime , martin and brandenberger in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also @xcite ) showed that standard predictions of inflation are indeed sensitive to trans - planckian physics : different dispersion relations lead to different results for the cmbr spectrum .",
    "it is the lack of a fundamental theory , valid at all energies , that makes the model building of the transplanckian regime very interesting .",
    "the main issue is how much are the known observables affected by the unknown theory .",
    "the apparently _ ad hoc _ modification of the dispersion relation at high energies is contrained by the criterion that its low energy predictions do no conflict the observables .",
    "specifically , in this paper we address two questions : a ) can the transplanckian regime contribute to the dark energy of the universe , and b ) how sensitive is the cmbr spectrum to energies higher than the planck scale @xmath4 , where our current physics theory is known to break down .",
    "we choose a family of dispersion relations for the frequency of the wavefunctions that modifies the behaviour of the field at the ultrahigh energies of the transplanckian regime .",
    "the dispersion relation has the following features : it is smooth , nearly linear for energies less than the planck scale , reaches a maximum , and attenuates to zero at ultrahigh momenta thereby producing ultralow frequencies at very short distances .",
    "we name the @xmath3 that part of the dispersion graph of very short distances that contains the range of ultralow frequencies less or equal to the current hubble constant @xmath2 .",
    "it follows that the @xmath3 modes are still currently frozen .",
    "we calculate the energy of the @xmath3 modes in order to address the former question ( a ) and show that although the @xmath3 does not contribute significantly to the cmbr spectrum , it has a dominant contribution to the dark energy of the universe @xcite .",
    "the energy density of the @xmath3 modes is of the same order today as the matter energy density .",
    "the second question ( b ) is motivated by the problem that in most inflationary models the present large scale structure of the universe is extrapolated from a regime of ultra - high energies ( known as the transplanckian regime ) originating from before the last 60 e - foldings of the exponential expansion . in refs .",
    "@xcite the authors have demonstrated that the problem of calculating the spectrum of perturbations with a time - dependent dispersive frequency can be reduced to the familiar topic of particle creation on a time - dependent background @xcite .",
    "we will use their observation in what follows .",
    "they also conjecture that the observed power spectrum can always be recovered only by using a smooth dispersion relation , which ensures an adiabatic time - evolution of the modes . by taking the frequency dispersion relations to be the general class of epstein functions @xcite ,",
    "we check and lend strong support to their conjecture . we present the exact solutions to the mode equation for the scalar field with a `` time - dependent mass '' , and the resulting cmbr spectrum below .",
    "we show that the major contribution to the cmbr spectrum comes from the long wavelength modes when they re - enter the horizon .",
    "the spectrum is nearly insensitive to the very short wavelength modes inside the hubble horizon .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we present the set - up and formalism of our analysis .",
    "the family of dispersion functions , exact solutions to the mode equations of motion and the resulting cmbr spectrum ( from the bogoliubov method ) are reported in section 3 . in section 4",
    ", we calculate the contribution of the _ tail _ modes to the dark energy of the universe today . in this work ,",
    "we have neglected the backreaction effects of particle production .",
    "this assumption is fully justified from the calculation of the energy for the transplanckian modes , in section 4 .",
    "due to the _ dispersed _ ultralow frequency of these modes , the energy contained in that transplanckian regime is very small ( @xmath6 ) , thus the backreaction effect is reasonably negligible @xcite .",

    "nonlinear dispersion relations , similar to the ones we consider in this work , are known to arise in effective theories of : nonlocal condensed matter or particle physics models arising from non - canonical kinetic terms @xcite ; from the dissipative behavior of a quantum system immersed into an environment after coarse - graining @xcite ; or from effective theories with phase transitions , time - dependent mass squared terms or effective potentials @xcite .",

    "the preheating @xcite from the nonthermal phase transition then leads to the second stage of inflation below planck energies .",
    "in the former case , the motivation comes from the common belief that the superstring theory is the one that describes or at least is valid at energies of the transplanckian period .",
    "taking this idea one step further , we incorporate the concept of superstring duality ( which applies at transplanckian regimes ) in our analysis by choosing a particular family of dispersion relations that exhibits _ dual _ behavior and winding radius @xmath25 , the frequency mode spectrum is dual in the sense that @xmath26 and @xmath25 are related as @xmath27 .",

    "we introduce the class of epstein functions as the family of dispersion relations in section 3 , and derive the cmbr spectrum from the exact solutions to the evolution equations .",
    "meanwhile , for the special features of our choice of dispersion relation , the modes at very high momenta but of ultra low frequencies @xmath61 are frozen for as long as the hubble expansion rate @xmath45 of the universe dominates over their frequency .",

    "this becomes clearer when recognizing the strong relation between the time - dependent dispersion relation and the curvature given by the time derivatives of the scale factor @xmath9 .",

    "the calculation showed that the tail energy was @xmath130 ( times a prefactor @xmath119 which weakly depends on @xmath81 and , for random values of the parameter , takes values between 1 to 9 ) orders less than the total energy during inflation .",
    "this result is true for the whole class of dispersion relations .",
    "we chose different random values of the 1-parameter dispersion family @xmath81 , and the numerical calculation shows that @xmath81 influences the energy at the most by less than an order of magnitude .",
    "we _ did not need to do any tuning _ of the parameters and used the _ planck scale as the fundamental scale of the theory_. clearly , at present the tail energy dominates in the friedmann equation , if the ratio of its energy to the total energy ( as found by the calculation ) was @xmath131 during inflation .",
    "the @xmath3 thus provides a _ strong candidate _ for explaining the dark energy of the universe @xcite .",
    "we suspect that the above result of producing such an extremely small number for the @xmath3 energy without any fine - tuning ( and by using @xmath132 as the only fundamental scale of the theory ) , is generic for any dispersion graph with a @xmath3 .",
    "the family of dispersion relations that feature a @xmath3 , corresponding to vacuum modes of very short distances , was motivated by superstring duality @xcite",
    ".    however , in section 2 we made the observation that _ introducing a dispersion relation is equivalent to introducing changes in the curvature of the universe _ , at very short or very large distances while keeping the generalized frequency @xmath57 of eq .",
    "( [ modeneff ] ) invariant .",
    "it is quite possible that the dispersion relation for the @xmath3 modes results from a different curvature of the universe at very short distances .",
    "this is an important link and we use it in a sequential paper @xcite to demonstrate that the sn1a data can not be reinterpreted away by changing the large scale curvature of the universe .",
    "although it is counterintuitive , since large distance would correspond to low energy theories , we show in @xcite that any changes in large scale curvature would disagree with the observed cmbr spectrum",
    ".    it would be interesting to know what happens to the tail and the hubble rate in the future .",
    "after all , a model is useful in so far as it can make future predictions .",
    "although conceptually it is straightforward to find out the answer , given by the solution to the coupled equations ( [ modeneff ] ) , ( [ phia1 ] ) and ( [ phia2 ] ) , technically it appears difficult to predict the future evolution of the tail modes .",
    "the technical difficulty lies in the fact that at present , the @xmath3 equation of motion is strongly coupled to the friedmann equation for @xmath45 since the @xmath3 energy dominates .",
    "the hubble rate would continue to decrease _ only if _ these modes decay , but",
    "these modes can decay _ only when _ the hubble rate decreases below their frequency .",
    "it may be possible that the frozen tail will sustain a constant hubble rate which in turn will not allow the further decay of the tail modes .",
    "it is also possible that @xmath45 will continue to decrease in which case the tail modes will become dynamic and redshift away in the future .",
    "it is only the solution to the mode equations coupled to the friedmann equation , that will provide the answer on whether the hubble constant and tail will decay in the future or remain at their current value .",
    "we do not have this solution yet , and the work is left for future investigation .",
    "in addition , the equation of state , @xmath133 , is an @xmath134 that will provide a test to the model @xcite , especially with the new data coming in the near future from the snap @xcite and sdss @xcite missions .",
    "however , we know that currently these @xmath3 modes are frozen vacuum modes of ultralow energy but very short distance , thus their energy behaves like a cosmological constant energy .",
    "we also know they become dynamic and acquire a kinetic term only when the hubble rate drops below the frequency . and , if they decay , the product is radiation of gravity waves at very short distances since their physical origin is from the tensor perturbations during inflation ( it is well known that scalar perturbations do not contribute to the energy ) .",
    "the condition for the decay of the last mode in the tail is fulfilled when @xmath45 has dropped to zero .",
    "many of our results , e.g. the dispersion family and the exact solutions together with the bogoliubov coefficients , could be applied to the black hole physics .",
    "the issue of transplanckian physics was originally raised in the black hole context with respect to the sensitivity of the hawking radiation to the blueshifted , superplanckian energy wavepackets . following a phenomenological approach ,",
    "a few dispersive models were introduced @xcite-@xcite in order to introduce a bound on the blueshifted energies and check the sensitivity of the black hole spectrum .",
    "we have introduced a new , different family of dispersive models , that also gives rise to a thermal spectrum .",
    "the analytical results of our class of dispersion models can be applied to the black hole physics and reproduce the same thermal hawking spectrum .",
    "there are many subtleties involved due to the different symmetries of the two scenarios , but these issues are beyond the purpose and scope of this paper .",
    "it is left for future work . however ,",
    "if the hawking radiation for this class of dispersions is again thermal , it lends strong support to unruh s conjecture that black hole radiation is insensitive to physics in the far ultraviolet ( trans - planckian ) regime , being predominantly an infrared effect . on the other hand , our class of models departs from the previous ones in the asymptotic behavior at very high momenta , with the presence of an infinite `` tail '' of ultralow frequency modes .",
    "the @xmath3 feature and energy results , applied to a black hole case , may raise interesting issues , in particular with respect to the black hole s information loss paradox .",
