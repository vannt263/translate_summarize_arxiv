    "about 110 years ago , bryan analyzed oscillations of self - gravitating and spheroidal liquids and obtained the period equations for oscillation modes whose frequencies are proportional to the angular velocity  @xcite .",
    "these modes are similar to those which were investigated for rotating realistic compressible stars and named r - modes by papaloizou & pringle  @xcite ( see also e.g. @xcite ) .    it is only very recently that the r - mode has been rediscovered from a standpoint of its strong instability and intensively studied . for sufficiently rapidly rotating stars",
    "whose oscillations are coupled to gravitational radiation , instability induced by gravitational radiation was discovered by chandrasekhar  @xcite and by friedman & schutz  @xcite .",
    "thus it is called the cfs instability ( for reviews , see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "andersson  @xcite has pointed out that the r - mode oscillations suffer from the cfs instability and play a very important role in a first few years after formation of neutron stars .    in subsequent studies by many authors ( e.g. @xcite ) ,",
    "it has become clear that the r - mode oscillations make newly born neutron stars significantly unstable by gravitational radiation emission for a temperature range around @xmath6 k. for the cfs instability of the f - mode oscillations , the effect of viscosity stabilizes neutron stars almost all range of the temperature .",
    "consequently the angular velocity would be affected only slightly and would become 90 - 95% of the keplerian angular velocity .",
    "contrast to the cfs instability of f - modes , the cfs instability of r - modes will not be stabilized for a certain range of the temperature @xmath7 of neutron stars , i.e. , roughly around @xmath8  k , even if there exists viscosity . this may be explained by the weakness of bulk viscosity damping because the volume expansion rate of the r - mode oscillation is small .",
    "also the critical rotational frequency of the star from which the instability sets in is zero , in contrast to the case of the f - modes .",
    "it leads to the enhancement of the instability as well . due to the effect of the r - mode instability , neutron stars which have been born with @xmath9  k",
    "will lose most of their angular momentum in only one year and settle down to slowly rotating configurations .",
    "this time scale is determined from that of cooling of newly born neutron stars down to @xmath10  k. thus there exist critical angular velocities for neutron stars above which no stable configurations exist for each value of the temperature .",
    "this sets a severe limit to the scenario of evolution of newly born neutron stars , in particular , to that of millisecond pulsars . from the observational point of view",
    ", the rotational periods of neutron stars were considered to be rather long ( see e.g. @xcite ) , although from the angular momentum considerations of the progenitors of neutron stars they could be shorter than @xmath11 ms .",
    "therefore , some mechanism which sets limit to the rotational periods of neutron stars has been required and looked for . from the significant feature of the r - mode instability",
    ", it could be the promising one which explains the observational results .",
    "however , we should note that almost all results mentioned above have been obtained from stability analysis of slowly rotating stars except two works by bryan  @xcite and lindblom & ipser  @xcite .",
    "for example , lockitch & friedman  @xcite have introduced the slow rotation approximation to get eigenfrequencies and eigenfunctions of the classical r - modes and generalized r - modes for polytropic stars ( about generalized r - modes , see also @xcite ) , and andersson , kokkotas , & schutz  @xcite have also analyzed slowly rotating equilibrium configurations to estimate the spin evolution of young neutron stars . as for the results of @xcite and those of @xcite ,",
    "maclaurin spheroids were analyzed . since",
    "realistic stars are not incompressible fluid and newly born neutron stars might be rotating with very short periods , it would be desirable to investigate r - mode oscillations of _ rapidly rotating _ and _ compressible _ stars .    in the previous letter paper  @xcite",
    ", we have shown some representative results of the classical r - mode oscillations of rapidly rotating polytropic stars with the polytropic index @xmath12 .",
    "those results have been obtained by developing a new scheme to handle r - mode oscillations of rapidly rotating polytropic stars in newtonian gravity . in this paper",
    ", we will explain the new scheme in detail and show classical r - mode oscillations of rotational equilibrium configurations for a wide range of @xmath13 and @xmath4 .",
    "the numerical scheme is an extended version of the one which was used to analyze f - mode instability by yoshida & eriguchi  @xcite . after computing r - mode oscillations for equilibrium sequences of several rotating polytropes",
    ", we will calculate time scales of evolution due to dissipation by taking account of the effect of viscosity and gravitational radiation and obtain critical curves for the r - mode instability in the temperature  rotational frequency plane by following the analysis method proposed by ipser & lindblom  @xcite . in the same plane , we can also draw  evolutionary curves \" due to cooling by using the standard modified urca process@xcite or other mechanisms .",
    "our newly developed scheme for the oscillations of rotating stars will be explained in section 2 . in section 3 , we will show our computational results for the classical r - mode oscillations of rotating polytropes .",
    "time scales of evolution due to gravitational radiation as well as viscosity will be calculated by using the eigenfrequencies and eigenfunctions of r - mode oscillations . by using these time",
    "scales we will be able to get critical curves for the r - mode instability and the ` evolutionary ' curves for hot young neutron stars . finally , in section 4",
    ", we will discuss the uncertain issues included in our analysis , and some other important problems which we will have to treat carefully in the future .",
    "in this paper we will treat _ uniformly rotating polytropes _ in the framework of _ newtonian _ gravity .",

    "we have made use of the relation between the perturbed pressure , @xmath42 , and the perturbed density as follows : @xmath43 since the unperturbed states are axisymmetric and stationary , all perturbed quantities can be expressed by using the expansion as follows : @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the oscillation frequency and the expansion coefficients of corresponding quantities , respectively .    when we define the physical quantities @xmath47 and apply the above expansion , the perturbed equations become as follows : @xmath48 @xmath49 @xmath50 @xmath51      for @xmath52 polytropes , we can follow the same procedure as that for @xmath34 polytropes by choosing the pressure perturbation as one of the unknown quantities instead of the density perturbation .",
    "the final equations can be written as follows : @xmath53 @xmath54 @xmath55 @xmath56      instead of solving the basic equations derived above , we make use of the compatibility relations among the equations of motion , in particular , the compatibility equations between eqs .",

    "instead of solving the eigenvalue problem directly , we add one more condition to the basic equations of the system and solve for all the unknown quantities simultaneously by using the newton - raphson iteration scheme .",

    "we have computed equilibrium sequences of uniformly rotating polytropes with @xmath0 and @xmath1 by starting from spherical models to terminal models which are configurations just before shedding mass from the equatorial surface . by using these equilibrium models , classical r - mode oscillations for @xmath2 and @xmath3 modes",
    "have been solved and eigenfrequencies and eigenfunctions have been obtained . in the actual numerical computations ,",

    "( [ energyloss ] ) , i.e. the first term in the righthand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : degdt ] ) , becomes positive as follows : @xmath102 consequently , since the time derivative of the energy dissipation due to gravitational radiation becomes positive , gravitational radiation makes the system unstable by growing the perturbation .    on the other hand , as seen from the second and third terms in the righthand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : degdt ] ) , viscosity works as a stabilizing factor for the system .",
    "therefore , if we compare the time scale of gravitational radiation and that of viscosity , we will be able to conclude the stability of the system .",
    "the time scale of the system change due to dissipation can be defined as the inverse of the imaginary part of the mode eigenfrequency , @xmath103 as follows : @xmath104 where @xmath105 .",
    "positive values of @xmath106 imply that the effect of gravitational radiation emission overcomes the stabilization effect due to viscosity .",
    "in other words , the system is in an unstable state .",
    "therefore , the critical condition which divides stable and unstable configurations can be defined by the following equation : @xmath107 in order to evaluate the time scales we need to know the viscosity coefficients at high density regions . as for the origin of the viscosity , we adopt the same mechanisms as @xcite . the shear viscosity is owing to neutron - neutron or electron - electron collisions in the neutron matter when the temperature of the star is not so high .",
    "on the other hand , for high temperature regions , the bulk viscosity which is due to the energy generation caused by compression of the neutron star matter because the time scale to balance between @xmath108-decay and inverse @xmath108-decay is longer than that of the dynamical perturbed motion of the star is dominant .",
    "the coefficients of each viscosity are written as follows @xcite : @xmath109 where @xmath110 for lower temperature regions , we need to consider only electron - electron collisions for the coefficient of shear .      in this paper",
    "we will choose the polytropic constant @xmath23 so that the mass and the radius of the star become @xmath111 and @xmath112 km in the spherical limit .",
    "we will call this star a canonical neutron star .",
    "if we specify the polytropic index , the value of the polytropic constant @xmath23 is uniquely determined .",
    "the critical condition ( [ critical ] ) depends on the structure of the unperturbed configuration , the eigenfunctions of the perturbed state , the eigenfrequency and the temperature . since we assume the polytropic relation for the canonical neutron stars and consider only classical r - modes , the structure of the equilibrium state , the eigenfunctions and the eigenfrequency are all determined by specifying the angular velocity in addition to the polytropic index @xmath13 and the mode number @xmath4 .",
    "thus the critical condition can be considered to be a function of the angular velocity and the temperature as well as @xmath13 and @xmath4 . in other words",
    ", once we specify the values of @xmath13 and @xmath4 , the critical condition can be expressed as a _ critical curve _ on the temperature  rotational frequency plane .",
    "it is not easy to follow realistic evolution of neutron stars by considering the effect of gravitational loss and viscosity as well as the effect of cooling due to neutrino loss .",
    "thus we will choose a different approach .",
    "once cooling mechanisms are specified , we can estimate cooling time scales of the neutron star . in this paper , we assume that the standard modified urca process is dominant in the initial stage of the neutron star formation @xcite . for this process , the effective cooling time scale is a function of the stellar temperature and defined by @xmath113^{-1 }   = \\frac{6t_c}{t_9 ^ 6},\\ ] ] where @xmath114 is a cooling time for the modified urca process , typically @xmath115 1y .",
    "since the neutron stars evolve due to radiation of gravitational wave and neutrino loss , we can define a critical state where the time scales of two mechanisms are the same as follows : @xmath116 since this state is also a function of the rotational frequency and the temperature if @xmath13 and @xmath4 are specified , we can draw an _ ` evolutionary ' curve of the stellar spin _ , whose meaning is made clear in the following discussion , on the rotational frequency  temperature plane .      in figs .",
    "812 , critical curves for the classical r - modes instability are drawn in the rotational frequency , @xmath117 , and the temperature plane for different values of @xmath13 and @xmath4 . above these solid curves ,",
    "the instability due to gravitational wave emission overcomes the stabilizing effect of viscosity and consequently neutron stars become unstable .    in these figures",
    ", the evolutionary curves of the stellar spin are also shown by dashed curves . above these curves ,",
    "cooling time scale of each cooling mechanism is longer than the instability time scale .",
    "it implies that in this region the neutron stars evolve nearly downwards by losing the angular momentum but keeping the temperature constant . in the region below these curves , the stars sweep leftwards due to neutrino loss by keeping the rotational frequency almost constant .",
    "suppose we fix a cooling mechanism of the star .",
    "it is certain that neutron stars are born with high temperature with @xmath118 k. concerning the rotational frequency of the newly born neutron stars , they may not rotate so rapidly compared with the rotational frequency of the kepler limit @xcite but may rotate with certain rotational frequencies above the minimum value of the critical curve .",
    "it implies that such newly born neutron stars are clearly located below the critical curve at the right side of the @xmath7@xmath117 plane . since this region is also below the evolutionary curve , cooling stars move almost horizontally to leftwards on this plane .    during the evolution due to cooling ,",
    "the stars come to and cross the critical curve .",
    "once they come into the regions above the critical curve , the r - mode instability due to gravitational radiation loss starts working significantly . as a result , the stars would evolve downwards vertically .",
    "however , the stars are still located below the evolutionary curve and the time scale of cooling is smaller than that of the instability .",
    "therefore , due to this cooling effect , the stars move to leftwards almost horizontally on the plane .",
    "eventually the stars go across the evolutionary curve .",
    "as soon as they cross the curve , the instability works efficiently and the stars move downwards vertically .",
    "if they cross the evolutionary curve once more , the cooling effect becomes dominant again and the stars will evolve horizontally .",
    "consequently we can consider that the stars evolve almost along the evolutionary curve of the cooling mechanism being considered . in this sense",
    "we can regard the evolutionary curves as curves along which the spin evolution of a cooling star takes place .    as seen from figs .",
    "812 , the evolutionary curves are located above the critical curves .",
    "this means that the evolution mentioned above will come to an end because they go out of the unstable region of the gravitational radiation and reach the lower left part of the @xmath7@xmath117 plane .",
    "consequently , the neutron stars will settle down to the states with the rotational frequencies corresponding to the minimum values of the corresponding evolutionary curve for each cooling channel .    in figs .",
    "810 , we show the critical and evolutionary curves for @xmath119 , @xmath120 and @xmath121 modes , respectively . from these figures ,",
    "the minimum values of critical curves are about 100hz , 200hz , and 300hz for the @xmath75 , @xmath120 , and @xmath121 , respectively .",
    "therefore we can see that the instability of the @xmath119 mode dominates other modes with higher values of @xmath4 .    in figs .  1112",
    ", we show the critical and evolutionary curves of polytropes with @xmath122 and @xmath123 for the @xmath75 r - mode .",
    "these results are almost the same as the result of @xmath81 polytropes .",
    "it means that the classical r - mode instability depends little on the compressibility .",
    "this agrees with the result of @xcite in which they conclude that the instability is insensitive to the equation of state .",
    "in particular , the smallest values of the rotational frequency of the critical curves seem to be determined uniquely irrespective of the polytropic index as far as the value of @xmath4 is the same .",
    "thus we can conclude that neutron stars will settle down to states with a unique rotational frequency , i.e. around 100hz .    as a summary ,",
    "neutron stars which are born with high temperature ( @xmath124 ) and rather rapid rotational frequency ( a few times of 100hz ) will be spun down to about 100hz by the effect of the gravitational instability on a quite short time scale .",
    "in this paper we have developed a new numerical method for solving the r - mode oscillations of rapidly rotating compressible stars . by using the obtained eigenfrequencies and eigenfunctions ,",
    "we have calculated the condition for occurrence of the gravitational radiation induced instability . by combining the cooling of the neutron stars and the instability ,",
    "we have confirmed the evolutionary scenario of hot young neutron stars proposed from the slow rotation approximation , in particular , considerable spin down of the neutron stars with rather high rotation rates of initial spins on a very short time scale ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the shortness of the spin down time scale implies that this mechanism would , effectively , result in  birth of slowly rotating neutron stars \" because it would be difficult to observe the very initial stage with rather high rotational frequencies during one or so years just after the formation of neutron stars .",
    "this might be the reason of observational data of nonexistence of pulsars with very short initial spin periods @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that our analysis has been carried out under some restricted assumptions .",
    "first , we have formulated the problem in the framework of newtonian gravity . in order to get quantitatively correct values we have to use general relativity , although it is considerably difficult to solve oscillations of not only the matter but also the gravitational field . at the moment",
    ", no one has succeeded in treating the perturbations of the gravitational field of axisymmetric configurations except obtaining neutral points for f - mode oscillations @xcite . concerning the r - mode oscillations in general relativity",
    ", there arises another problem .",
    "since there is the frame dragging , the effective angular velocity can not be uniform any more .",
    "some authors suggest that this may make the problem a singular eigenvalue problem @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "second , we have to treat the realistic equation of state for the neutron star matter instead of simplified equations of state such as polytropes .",
    "however , as has been known from the slow rotation approximation @xcite and as we have shown for rapidly rotating models in this paper , there arise little differences of the oscillations of polytropes with different polytropic indices . therefore ,",
    "even if we treat the realistic equation of state , the situation would not change drastically as far as the classical r - modes are concerned .",
    "third , there is some uncertainty about the cooling process .",
    "although the modified urca process has been taken as the standard mechanism of the neutron star cooling , there are some other mechanisms which would contribute to cooling of neutron stars .",
    "therefore , we have computed evolutionary curves by introducing several possible cooling mechanisms .",
    "13 shows such curves for several cooling processes : the neutrino bremsstrahlung , the quark @xmath108 decay , the pion condensation , and the direct urca cooling model , beside the modified urca process . in our calculations ,",
    "the time scale of the direct urca process is taken from @xcite and those of other processes are taken from @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . as seen from this figure , other cooling mechanisms give obviously different evolutionary curves or  evolutionary paths \" . concerning the minimum values of the evolutionary curves , however , differences among different cooling processes are rather small . in other words ,",
    "the final rotational frequencies depend weakly on the cooling mechanisms .",
    "consequently the final rotational frequencies would be around 50 @xmath115 180hz as far as the scenario mentioned above works for the hot young neutron stars .",
    "fourth , the assumption that neutron stars rotate uniformly is also uncertain . since we are dealing with the very beginning of the neutron star formation stages , newly born neutron stars may rotate differentially , although they will soon settle down to uniform rotation on a time scale of several years .",
    "the r - mode oscillations of differentially rotating stars are another problem",
    ". there may arise a corotation point within the star and the similar problem as that in general relativity needs to be solved .",
    "in addition to these problems , we have to discuss the following crucial issues which may play a more important role in realistic formation and evolution of neutron stars than the above mentioned things .",
    "the superfluidity is one of the most important but poorly understood physics about the realistic neutron stars .",
    "some authors ( e.g. @xcite ) have suggested that the effect of the superfluid might suppress the r - mode instability completely in the low temperature regions , while other authors have assumed that this effect might not be strong enough @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . in this paper , we assume that the superfluidity will not work effectively .",
    "in fact , since the realistic neutron star matter can not be examined by any present experiments on the earth , the only way to estimate this effect may be the comparison between the theoretical works and the observational data .",
    "the existence of a solid crust may be another important factor for the r - mode instability .",
    "bildsten & ushomirsky  @xcite have suggested that the existence of the solid crust whose thickness is @xmath115 1 km would work as a stabilizing factor of the r - mode instability and that the minimum rotational frequency might be 40% of that of the kepler limit .",
    "however , it is not clear whether or not the solid crust has formed only in a year or so from the formation of the neutron star .",
    "furthermore , it is uncertain about the transition region from the fluid to the solid .",
    "thus we have not taken the effect of the crust into our considerations in this paper .",
    "the most important factor concerning the neutron star evolution may be the presence of the magnetic field .",
    "there is a high possibility that hot young neutron stars might spin down by the effect of the magnetic field and/or that neutron stars might be born with rather slow rotation rates because the angular momentum is transferred by the effect of the magnetic field from the core to the envelope during the evolution of the massive stars ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "inclusion of magnetic fields may change the r - mode characteristics itself .",
    "for instance , magnetic braking may enhance the instability by increasing the amplitude of the mode  @xcite .",
    "also suggested is that the cfs instability by the alfvn wave radiation may exist for stars with strong magnetic fields . on the other hand",
    "it is argued  @xcite that the drifting fluid motion produced by the r - mode may generate strong toroidal magnetic fields .",
    "this may suppress the growth of the r - mode amplitude .",
    "therefore , the realistic evolution of the neutron stars have to be studied by including the r - mode instability as well as the effect of magnetic fields in the future .",
