    "the past 40 years have witnessed a huge increase of the transmission capacity in single - mode fibers .",
    "every available degree of freedom has been explored , such as multiplexing in time , in wavelength , in polarization and in phase . on the other hand ,",
    "nowadays single - mode fibers are gradually reaching their capacity limit of about 100 tbit / s which is dictated by the shannon theorem @xcite .",
    "+ in this scenario , multicore and multimode fibers are rapidly emerging as the ideal solution in order to fulfil the growing demand of capacity . in these fibers",
    "nonlinear pulse manipulation can be efficiently exploited for various applications @xcite .",
    "furthermore , they allow exploring a further degree of freedom , namely the spatial , and therefore the implementation of space division multiplexing ( sdm ) schemes @xcite . in sdm",
    "each fiber core and/or mode represents an independent information channel parallel to the others , which permits in principle to largely overcome the capacity limit of single - mode fibers . + a key - component for an efficient operation of sdm schemes",
    "is represented by multimode optical amplifiers @xcite , which have been the subject of intense research over the last years . among the most important",
    "we find multimode fiber raman amplifiers ( ra ) @xcite and multimode erbium doped fiber amplifiers ( edfa ) @xcite .",
    "+ an alternative fiber - based approach is represented by parametric amplification @xcite , which is based on a modulational instability ( mi ) process .",
    "+ compared to ras and edfas , parametric amplification guarantees more flexibility since it makes possible to tune the position of the amplified sidebands at arbitrary wavelength by means of the input pump and of the fiber parameters . moreover , kerr - nonlinearity is practically instantaneous , enabling ultrafast signal processing applications .",
    "+ intermodal - mi ( im - mi ) in multimode fibers was demonstrated decades ago @xcite and more recently explored as a possible means for supercontinuum generation @xcite as well as for the development of efficient fiber parametric amplifiers @xcite and low - cost broadband fiber sources @xcite .",
    "+ in all previous works , im - mi has been analyzed by considering separately the interaction between couples of modes and studying the bimodal - mi process related to the phase - matching of each couple . with this approach",
    ", the complex im - mi dynamics is decomposed in a set of bimodal - mi processes , which greatly simplifies its analysis . on the other hand ,",
    "the presence and the influence of the non - phase - matched modes is usually neglected .",
    "+ the main purpose of this paper is to go beyond this simplistic view and to develop a model taking into account for the interaction between all the fiber modes , which is the solely way to correctly describe the im - mi .",
    "furthermore we provide , for the first time to the best of our knowledge , some useful analytical estimates for the im - mi gain and we evaluate the impact of higher - order dispersion terms and losses , which reveals some surprising phenomena into the im - mi dynamics .",
    "the final result is a general description of the im - mi that paves the way to the realization of wideband multimode parametric amplifiers .",
    "+ the paper is organized as follows .",
    "+ in section  [ rif : general ] we linearize and reduce to an eigenvalue problem the coupled nonlinear schrdinger equations ( cnlse ) describing the propagation in a multimode fiber .",
    "we focus our attention on single - core isotropic , highly - birefringent and telecommunication fibers .",
    "we finally obtain a matrix @xmath1 storing all the information about the dispersion properties of the modes and the modal power distribution of the pump .",
    "this outcome generalizes previous results on bimodal - mi @xcite , generated by the interaction between 2 spatial or polarization modes , to the most general case of @xmath0 interacting modes .",
    "+ in section  [ rif : simulations ] we find some useful analytical formulas that quantify the growth of each mode as function of the eigenvalues of @xmath1 with negative imaginary part , namely the gains , and their corresponding eigenvectors .",
    "interesting enough , several gains could coexist for the same pump - sideband detuning , giving rise to a competition between two or more amplification processes .",
    "we thus introduce the concept of dominant gain , which is the truly leader of the mi growth , and we show that different gains could be dominant at different fiber positions and for different modes .",
    "+ in section  [ rif : inside ] we provide a deeper physical insight into the im - mi and we derive some analytical estimates for the im - mi gain as function of the pump - sideband detuning and the system parameters .",
    "we put in evidence that im - mi is truly associated to a phase - matched four - wave mixing process , which is the usual point of view of past works , but we also clearly show that all the fiber modes undergo amplification , and not only the phase - matched ones .",
    "the amplification of each mode can be controlled by means of the system parameters and over a large bandwidth that increases with the number of the modes .",
    "+ in sections  [ rif : tod impact ] ,  [ rif : pump impact ] and  [ rif : losses impact ] we analyze the impact of third - order dispersion as well as of the pump power distribution and of the propagation losses on the im - mi dynamics .",
    "we find that absorption losses cause a shift of the gain curves towards low frequencies and that , differently from single - mode fibers , third - order dispersion plays a substantial role and may lead to the generation of secondary mi bands in addition to conventional ones . + in section  [ rif : limits ] we discuss the limits of validity of our model and finally , in section  [ rif : conclusions ] , we resume the main outcomes and we give the concluding remarks .",
    "let us consider a beam , centered at the carrier angular frequency @xmath2 , which is injected in an optical fiber and is coupled to the n propagating modes of the fiber . in the weakly guiding approximation , which is well accurate in typical silica fibers with low core - cladding refractive index difference ,",

    "+ equation ( [ totalequation ] ) is valid in a fiber where we can neglect the linear coupling among the different modes , which is induced by random perturbations in the fiber structure such as manufacturing imperfections , environmental variations or local mechanism stress @xcite .",
    "+ for example , in a highly birefringent ( hibi ) fiber the intrinsic large birefringence makes the propagation constants of all spatial and polarization modes to be noticeably different so as to nullify in practice the linear modal coupling .",
    "+ on the contrary , in quasi - perfectly circular core fibers we find group of modes that are quasi - degenerate and may thus experience a strong linear coupling .",
    "nevertheless eq.([totalequation ] ) is still valid provided that the length @xmath33 of the fiber is small if compared to the characteristic linear coupling length of these modes .",
    "actually , under this condition the fiber may be considered isotropic so that quasi - degenerate modes do not exchange energy and can thus be represented by an unique mode that is a proper linear combination of them .",
    "+ we introduce here the nonlinear length @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the largest among the nonlinear coupling coefficients and @xmath36 is the total input power .",

    "if this is the case and the pump frequency @xmath2 coincides with @xmath409 , then this nonlinear term must be taken into account in eq.([totalequation ] ) .",
    "what said is generally true for anyone of the terms that we have neglected .",
    "+ note also that , although the neglected terms are typically truly fast oscillating , however they could lead to some mi process that we have not accounted in our analysis . as an example , let us consider once again the term @xmath402 previously discussed , assuming @xmath410 so that it is effectively fast - oscillating .",
    "its decomposition by means of eq.([decomposition ] ) would lead to the presence of the term @xmath411 in eq.([sidebandequation ] ) , which is associated to a fwm process where energy is transferred from the @xmath177pump to the @xmath177signal and the @xmath412idler . once again",
    ", these considerations are generally true for anyone of the terms that we have dismissed in eq.([totalequation ] ) ; consequently , a group of mi bands exist that we have ignored in our analysis . however , these mi bands are typically located far away from the gain bands predicted by our theory ; moreover the corresponding fwm processes are very sensitive to small fiber imperfections so that their typical coherence length is less than 1 meter ( @xcite ) , which practically prevent an efficient mi growth in fibers longer than a few meters .",
    "+ for this reason we can safely assume that these neglected mi - bands do not affect the analysis developed in this paper . on the other hand , for very high - input powers and/or a large number of propagating modes in short fibers , some of the im - mi gain bands predicted by our analysis would be located far away from the pump and could thus overlap with the neglected mi - bands , which may invalidate our results in the portion of the spectrum where overlap occurs .",
    "+ another important issue that we have not considered in our analysis is the effect of polarization mode dispersion ( pmd ) as well as of spatial mode dispersion ( smd ) related to groups of quasi - degenerate modes , which could greatly impair the im - mi growth in telecom fibers @xcite . indeed , in the case of telecom fibers , eq.([sidebandequation ] )",
    "is strictly valid in the regime of zero - pmd and zero - smd only .",
    "+ a proper analysis taking into account for the pmd and smd could be done following a treatment similar to that proposed in @xcite in the case of single - mode fibers .",
    "the final result would be the presence of exponentially - decaying nonlinear coefficients in eq.([sidebandequation ] ) , which is completely analogue to the presence of exponentially decaying pump amplitudes when propagation losses are taken into account .",
    "we could therefore employ the magnus expansion proposed in section  [ rif : losses impact ] to deal with both losses and pmd / smd . on the other hand ,",
    "the derivation of the exponentially - decaying nonlinear coefficients in presence of pmd and smd is complex and out of the scope of this paper .",
    "in this paper we have presented a detailed theoretical and numerical analysis of the im - mi in multimode fibers , which brings to the idea of wideband multimode parametric amplification .",
    "we can summarize the main results as follows : +   + -_eigenvalue equation for multimode fibers- _ one of the main outcomes of this work consists in the linearization of the coupled nonlinear schrdinger equations describing the propagation in a multimode fiber and in their following transformation in an eigenvalue problem . in this way the modal amplification can be described by means of the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of a matrix @xmath1 that contains the information about the dispersion characteristics of the modes and the modal power distribution of the pump .",
    "this result generalizes previous studies of mi with 2 spatial or polarization modes to the most generale case of @xmath0 interacting modes .",
    "the computation of the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of @xmath1 as function of the pump - sideband detuning @xmath148 permits to completely characterize the im - mi . in particular , the eigenvalues with negative imaginary part , called as usual gains , lead to sideband amplification .",
    "+   + -_dominant gain and wideband amplification- _ for a given detuning several gains could be found , each one playing the role of dominant gain at different fiber positions and for different fiber modes .",
    "the amplification of each mode is thus controlled by its dominant gain as well as the corresponding eigenvector , which in turn depend on the system parameters .",
    "this issue is well highlighted by eq.([spectralestimation ] ) , which offers an analytical estimate of the modal amplification .",
    "most importantly , as highlighted in section  [ rif : general ] , each mode undergoes amplification in the whole im - mi band .",
    "+   + -_physical interpretation of the multimode amplification- _ although the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of @xmath1 can completely characterize the multimode amplification , however they do not provide a simple and intuitive picture of the physics behind the im - mi . at this purpose we considered separately the nonlinear interactions between all the possible couples of modes , which allows decomposing the complex im - mi dynamics in a set of bimodal - mi processes .",
    "the bimodal nonlinear interaction between the @xmath11mode and the @xmath291mode gives rise to a mi process , called @xmath294 , completely analogous to the vectorial mi in single - mode fibers .",
    "similarly the self nonlinear interaction of the @xmath11mode gives rise to the @xmath292 process , which is analogous to the scalar mi in single - mode fibers .",
    "these analogies permit to find out the analytical estimates eqs .",
    "(  [ smispectrum ] ,  [ nambspectrum ] ) approximating the im - mi gain and to interpret the wide im - mi band as the union of the bands related to each @xmath294 and @xmath292 process . as a result ,",
    "the useful bandwidth is in principle much larger than in the case of single - mode fibers .",
    "+   + -_phase - matched and not - phase - matched modes- _ in the simple bimodal model describing the @xmath294 and the @xmath292 processes the @xmath11mode and the @xmath291mode play the role of phase - matched modes , namely , they are amplified by means of a phase - matched fwm .",
    "nevertheless , this simple model can not give any information about the other modes , which we call not - phase matched and which undergo amplification because they are nonlinearly coupled to the phase - matched modes .",
    "therefore , although it sheds an important light on the im - mi dynamics , the bimodal model does not offer a complete characterization of the im - mi amplification , which is provided by the eigenvectors and the eigenvalues of @xmath1 instead .",
    "+   + -_influence of tod and losses- _ we have concluded our work by analyzing the impact of tod and of losses on the im - mi dynamics .",
    "we have put in evidence that the large gvm between different spatial modes may shift the im - mi gain bands towards high frequencies , so that higher - order dispersion terms should be contemplated in order to correctly describe the im - mi . differently from single - mode fibers",
    ", the tod difference between different modes plays an important role and leads to the formation of secondary mi - bands in addition to the conventional ones .",
    "+ contrary to the gvm , propagation losses may shift the gain bands towards low frequencies .",
    "their impact ( gain drop and frequency shift ) can be evaluated by properly modifying the matrix @xmath1 and resorting to a magnus expansion which accounts for the spatial decaying of the pump amplitudes .",
    "+   + -_future perspectives- _ the outcomes exposed in this paper pave the way towards the implementation of wideband multimode parametric amplifiers where the amplification of each mode could be selectively controlled by means of the system parameters .",
    "for this reason a natural evolution of this work is the study of the optimization of the pump modal distribution and of the fiber parameters in order to maximize the amplification of one or more modes in a desired band .",
    "* a further important issue to address will concern the system scalability*. in addition , although limited to the case of single - core step - index fibers , the theory here developed could be conveniently modified so as to describe im - mi phenomena in multicore fibers or photonic crystal fibers , which provide a unique opportunity for tailoring the modal dispersion characteristics and the nonlinear coupling coefficients .",

    "<S> , the amplification of each mode can be described by means of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix that stores the information about the dispersion properties of the modes and the modal power distribution of the pump . </S>",
    "<S> some useful analytical formulas are also provided that estimate the modal amplification as function of the system parameters . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the impact of third - order dispersion and of absorbtion losses is evaluated , which reveals some surprising phenomena into the im - mi dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> these outcomes generalize previous studies on bimodal - mi , related to the interaction between 2 spatial or polarization modes , to the most general case of @xmath0 interacting modes . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , they pave the way towards the realization of wideband multimode parametric amplifiers . </S>"
