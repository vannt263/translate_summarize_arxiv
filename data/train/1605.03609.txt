    "the top quark mass is a fundamental parameter of the standard model ( sm ) . due to its large size , it has non - negligible impact in the precision tests of the sm .",
    "after the discovery of the higgs boson and the measurement of its mass , the values of the @xmath9 and top mass are strongly correlated , such that a precise determination of both parameters would lead to a sm test of unprecedented precision  @xcite . indeed , there is presently some tension between the value of the top mass @xmath10  gev fitted from electroweak data and from its direct measurement  @xcite , for which the combination of the tevatron and lhc data yields the 1.6  @xmath11 lower value of @xmath12  gev  @xcite .",
    "the value of the top mass is also crucial to the issue of stability of the sm vacuum  @xcite .",
    "higgs quartic coupling decreases at high scales , eventually becoming negative .",
    "this evolution is very sensitive to the top mass value .",
    "for example , a top mass near 171  gev would imply that the quartic coupling may vanish at the planck scale , rather than turn negative .",
    "the standard direct determination of the top mass at hadron colliders , being based upon observables that are related to the mass of the system comprising the top decay products , are quoted as measurements of the pole mass . on the other hand",
    ", it seems more natural to use the @xmath0 mass in both precision electroweak observables and in vacuum stability studies . in  @xcite the relation between the @xmath0 and",
    "pole mass for a heavy quark ( the `` mass conversion formula '' from now on ) has been computed to the fourth order in the strong coupling @xmath13 . assuming the value of @xmath14  gev for the top - quark @xmath0 mass @xmath15 , and assuming @xmath16",
    ", we have  @xcite @xmath17 for the series expansion of the mass conversion formula .",
    "the last term from the fourth order correction is less than one half of the third order one .",
    "it is also known that the mass conversion formula is affected by infrared ( ir ) renormalons  @xcite .",
    "this means that there are factorially growing terms of infrared origin in the perturbative expansion , such that the expansion starts to diverge at some order . if the series is treated as an asymptotic expansion , the ambiguity in its resummation is of order of a typical hadronic scale . because of this",
    ", it is often stated that the ultimate accuracy of top pole mass can not be below a few hundred mev .",
    "one of the goals of this work is to make this estimate more precise .",
    "it is remarkable that the perturbative relation between the pole and @xmath0 mass of a heavy quark appears to be dominated by the leading infrared renormalon already in low orders  @xcite .",
    "this observation was used in previous work @xcite , and more recently in @xcite to estimate the unknown normalization of the leading ir renormalon , and mostly applied in the context of bottom physics . in the context of top physics ,",
    "the importance of this issue was raised recently in @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this work is to combine the newly available four - loop coefficient @xcite in the mass conversion formula with the known structure of the first infrared renormalon singularity  @xcite to determine the normalization constant and discuss its impact on top physics .",
    "we also perform an analysis of the dependence on the number of colours and flavours , which is by itself of interest , and stability tests with respect to variations of the scale of the strong coupling and @xmath0 mass .",
    "this leads to an expression for the mass conversion factor including an estimate of the contributions beyond four loops , and an estimate of the irreducible error .",
    "the renormalon divergence is a manifestation of the fact that the mass conversion formula , while infrared finite is sensitive to small loop momentum . in the case of the pole mass",
    "this sensitivity is particularly strong , namely linear , resulting in rapid divergence of the perturbative expansion , and an infrared sensitivity of order @xmath18  @xcite .",
    "the ambiguity in defining the pole mass is therefore of similar size .",
    "this is not surprising as the pole mass of a quark is not an observable due to confinement and the difference with the physical heavy meson masses is also of order @xmath18 .",
    "unlike other heavy quarks , the top quark decays on hadronic time scales , and thus the propagator pole position acquires an imaginary part .",
    "the renormalon divergence is not altered @xcite by the fact that the top quark is unstable with a width larger than @xmath18 and hence does not form bound states .",
    "the finite width simplifies the perturbative treatment of top quarks , since it provides a natural ir cut - off , and there exists no quantity for which the pole mass would ever be relevant .",
    "but the infrared sensitivity of the qcd corrections to the mass conversion factor , which causes the divergence , remains unaffected by the width .",
    "slightly more technically , the divergence arises from logarithmic enhancements of the loop integrand .",
    "heuristically , this can be understood by noticing that the running coupling evaluated at the scale @xmath19 of the loop momentum has the expansion @xmath20 the ir contribution to the last loop integration in the @xmath21-loop order then takes the form @xmath22 with this behaviour the series of mass corrections reaches a minimal term of order @xmath23 when @xmath24 and then diverges .",
    "asymptotic expansions can sometimes be summed using the borel transform .",
    "given a power series @xmath25 the corresponding borel transform is defined by @xmath26(t)=\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty } c_{n+1}\\,\\frac{t^n}{n!}\\,.\\ ] ] the borel integral @xmath27(t)\\ ] ] has the same series expansion as @xmath28 and provides the exact result under suitable conditions .",
    "however , for the case of ( [ eq : selfenexp ] ) , where @xmath29 , the borel integral @xmath30 can not be performed because of the pole at @xmath31 .",
    "we can introduce some prescription for handling the pole in the integral , as , for example , the principal value prescription .",
    "whether or not this reconstructs the exact result , an ambiguity remains , quantified by the imaginary part of the integral when going above or below the singular point .",
    "a commonly used procedure is to define this ambiguity to be equal to the imaginary part of the integral divided by pi ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite , section  5.2 ) . for ( [ eq : simpleborel ] ) ,",
    "this yields @xmath32 in the range of @xmath33 values considered in this paper , the ambiguity is close to the size of the smallest term in ( [ eq : minestimate ] ) . of ( [ eq : minestimate ] ) and ( [ eq : boralambiguity ] ) .",
    "the correct dependence is that of ( [ eq : boralambiguity ] ) , for the following reason : the typical width of the region where the minimal term is attained grows parametrically as @xmath34 .",
    "the accuracy of an asymptotic series is better estimated by the minimal term times the factor accounting for the number of terms in this region , which makes ( [ eq : minestimate ] ) parametrically consistent with ( [ eq : boralambiguity ] ) .",
    "numerically , this factor turns out to be of order one for the applications considered in this paper , as will be confirmed in section  [ sec : extrapolation ] below . in case of doubt ,",
    "the estimate from the ambiguity of the borel integral should be the preferred choice . ]",
    "it can be shown @xcite that while the precise asymptotic behaviour of the mass conversion formula differs from the simple ansatz employed in this section for illustration , as discussed below , the ambiguity is exactly proportional to @xmath18 , which evaluates to about @xmath35mev in the @xmath0 scheme . in the remainder of this work",
    ", we aim to quantify the proportionality factor .",
    "we write the perturbative expansion of the mass conversion formula as @xmath36 here @xmath37 is the @xmath0 coupling in the @xmath38 light flavours theory , and @xmath39 stands for the @xmath0 mass evaluated at the scale @xmath40 .",

    "we also use @xmath41 to denote the @xmath0 mass evaluated self - consistently at a scale equal to the mass itself , i.e. @xmath42    the leading ir renormalon divergence implies the following large-@xmath43 behaviour of the perturbative coefficients  @xcite ( and @xcite in this reference are related to those employed here by @xmath44 . with this notation",

    "the dependence on the scale @xmath53 of the strong coupling is compensated by the factor @xmath53 in front of @xmath54 in  ( [ eq : cnasymp ] ) . with these definitions",
    "the normalization @xmath55 is independent of @xmath53 and @xmath40 .",
