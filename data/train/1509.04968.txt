    "heavy ion collision experiments and lattice simulations are probing the phase diagram of qcd matter to help understand the chiral and deconfinement phase transitions @xcite .",
    "these experiments have shown that at low density , the transition is a continuous cross - over at @xmath0mev @xcite . at high density ,",
    "models lead to the expectation that the transition is first order .",
    "this structure would be verified by locating a critical end point in chemical potential ",
    "temperature plane where the first order line begins .",
    "the heavy ion collision experiments yield statistical observables of qcd matter , including proton number and electric charge fluctuations @xcite , and lattice studies have developed a variety of approaches to searching for structure at @xmath1 fodor:2001au , allton:2002zi , deforcrand:2010he , gavai:2010zn , li:2011ee , endrodi:2011gv , schmidt:2015kea .    to interpret the experimental data in terms of the phase diagram",
    ", we need to relate them to signatures derived from theory calculations . since conventional lattice methods are limited to low baryon density by the sign problem , it is useful to complement the investigation with model studies in which we can thoroughly study the phase structure at @xmath2 .",
    "we use the models to identify robust signatures of the critical point , such as consequences of the large correlation length , that would be manifest also near a critical point in qcd . the correlation length becomes large near the critical point ( cp ) because the cp is a second - order phase transition where the mass term in the landau effective potential for the order parameter @xmath3 vanishes , @xmath4 .",
    "therefore , at the cp , the longest wavelength correlations ( of order the system `` size '' ) can be investigated using the partition function @xcite @xmath5 }   \\label{partfnsigma}\\]]with the landau effective action @xmath6=\\omega _ { 0}+\\frac{1}{2}(\\vec{\\nabla}\\sigma ) ^{2}+\\frac{m_{\\sigma } ^{2}}{2}\\sigma ^{2}+\\frac{\\lambda _ { 3}}{3}\\sigma ^{3}+\\frac{\\lambda _ { 4}}{4}\\sigma ^{4}+ ... \\]]@xmath7 is the energy due to the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the order parameter , @xmath3 is the fluctuation around this vev , and for fluctuations at wavelengths similar to the system size , we consider only the zero momentum mode , so the kinetic term @xmath8 vanishes .",
    "the divergent parts of the fluctuations associated with @xmath9  at the cp ( an infrared fixed point ) are universal for systems within the same universal class .",
    "the finite parts of the fluctuations are model dependent which can be described by higher dimensional operators in the effective action . using eq.([partfnsigma ] ) , statistical observables such as baryon number fluctuations are related to fluctuations of the order parameter @xcite .",
    "for example , higher order , non - gaussian fluctuation moments are more sensitive to a critical point because they diverge with a larger power of the correlation length , as shown for the third and fourth order susceptibilities stephanov:2008qz , asakawa:2009aj , stephanov:2011pb .    in this approach ,",
    "we hypothesize the presence of a critical point , investigate the consequences , and compare them to data .",
    "it is important to bear in mind that the conditions we identify for a critical point can only be necessary conditions but not sufficient conditions .",
    "also , there are many assumptions in our attempt to compare with heavy ion data . for example",
    ", we assume the fireball is near thermal equilibrium at freeze - out , though critical slowing of dynamics would be important if the fireball approaches the critical point chemical potential and temperature @xcite .",
    "additionally , there can be changes in expansion dynamics and interactions that produce variations in particle spectra and acceptance independent of critical phenomena , whose fluctuations must also be controlled for koch:2008ia .",
    "to claim evidence of a critical point in this context , we should identify as many model - independent signatures as possible to corroborate interpretation of the data in terms of a critical point .    in this work",
    ", we study the nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) model , which is a qcd inspired field theoretic model with spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry @xcite .",
    "the model comprises distinct flavors of quarks that interact via ( effective ) point - like 4-fermion operators . at low density and temperature ,",
    "the model exhibits a non - zero chiral condensate @xmath10 vogl:1991qt , klevansky:1992qe , hatsuda:1994pi , buballa:2005rept , huang:2004ik .",
    "the goal is to identify , in the njl model results , characteristics of fluctuation observables that are predicted to be model - independent by analysis such as given in @xcite .",
    "previous work using the njl model has focused on third moments asakawa:2009aj , or electric charge susceptibilities skokov:2011rq .",
    "numerical studies of the susceptibilities have also used the polyakov - loop improved njl model @xcite and dyson - schwinger approaches @xcite . some of the model - independent characteristics have been confirmed and cross - checked in the ising @xcite and gross - neveu ( gn ) models @xcite .",
    "there are two main goals in this work .",
    "the first goal is to make use of the flavor dependence in the njl model to compute the complete set of susceptibilities on the phase diagram .",
    "the second goal is to check whether some model - independent features obtained from a general effective potential analysis then confirmed by the gn model @xcite  will remain in the njl model , which belongs to the same universality class with qcd at the cp .",
    "these features include : ( 1 ) the negative @xmath3-kurtosis ( @xmath11 ) region occurs almost entirely in the symmetric ( normal ) phase .",
    "( 2 ) however , in addition to the @xmath3-kurtosis , there are more critical - mode correlators contributing to the fourth - order baryon number susceptibility ( @xmath12 ) to determine its negative region .",
    "( 3 ) the peaks in non - gaussian susceptibilities on a freeze out line obey an ordering in temperature .    among those features ,",
    "we expect ( 1 ) to be robust , because they can be understood from the shape of the effective potential around the critical point @xcite .",
    "we also expect ( 2 ) to happen , that is , there are other terms as important as the @xmath3-kurtosis to determine the negative region of ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "this is based on a general effective action analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite to identify terms with leading power divergence in @xmath14 near the cp .",
    "we will check it numerically using the njl model .",
    "fluctuations in conserved charges are important observables because they can be obtained in principle from hic experiments as well as lattice simulations .",
    "not all fluctuation moments can be measured in practice , and we will discuss below the observationally most relevant subset .",

    "for example , since protons and neutrons comprise only up and down quarks and strangeness is conserved by qcd reactions , @xmath19 . on the other hand ,",
    "since the heavy nuclei typically contain more neutrons than protons , the initial state has an isospin asymmetry . at quark level",
    ", we have three independent chemical potentials @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22  associated with the conserved quark numbers for @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25  quarks , respectively . to compare to experiment , we use the basis of conserved charges @xmath26 . the hadron - level strangeness ( large @xmath27 ) is defined so that @xmath28 has @xmath29 in agreement with the experimental notation and opposite the quark - level definition of the strange charge ( small @xmath25 ) where the strange quark has @xmath30 and antistrange quark has @xmath31 .",
    "we will use the @xmath32 basis of charges , where @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "since the isospin potential @xmath35 is also measurable at hadron - level , we can use observations to constrain the chemical potentials , and so also the set of susceptibilities we need to evaluate .",
    "the chemical potentials @xmath36 at chemical freeze - out are determined by fitting the observed particles yields to a statistical model of hadronization in the fireball .",
    "limited acceptance and experimental effects can mean the fit values of the chemical potentials differ from the theoretical expectation .",
    "the data indicate that when collision energy per nucleon pair in the center - of - mass frame ( @xmath37 ) is 7.7 , 39 , 200 gev , @xmath38 is @xmath39130 , 30 , 10 gev and @xmath40 is @xmath3990 , 20 , 5 , respectively @xcite . using eq.([quark2hadron ] ) and",
    "isospin symmetry @xmath41 , this implies @xmath22 is @xmath3940 , 10 , 5 gev , even though theoretically @xmath19 in the initial state .",
    "however , given @xmath4240 mev which is smaller than the lower range on the strange quark ( current ) mass @xmath43 mev , it is a good approximation to set @xmath44 in our model calculations : dependence of the phase diagram on @xmath22 is weak as long as for @xmath45 .",
    "it is worth noting here that one piece of evidence for non - equilibrium at chemical freeze - out is that particle yield fits are improved by including a strange quark quenching factor @xmath46 , which observationally is @xmath47 .",
    "this smaller - than - equilibrium abundance of both @xmath25 and @xmath48 can be understood considering that the phase space for producing @xmath49 quarks is smaller due to their moderately large mass @xmath50 mev compared to the temperature @xmath51 mev .",
    "that is , a substantially smaller fraction of gluons ( or @xmath52 pairs ) collide with center - of - mass energy @xmath53 mev , which suppresses the reaction rate for production in comparison to the lifetime of the fireball @xcite .",
    "although it impacts the absolute abundance of measured strange particles , it is linearly independent of @xmath54 that controls net strangeness , i.e. the number of strange minus the number of antistrange quarks @xmath55 . with @xmath56 , there is no violation of strange quark number independent the value of @xmath46 .",
    "additionally , analysis of the charged pion ratio @xmath57 has consistently concluded that @xmath58 at high beam energies , though @xmath59 can differ from zero at the lowest collision energy @xmath60 gev @xcite .",
    "this variation as a function of @xmath37 can be understood by the total particle multiplicity becoming much higher for larger @xmath37 .",
    "we have checked quantitatively in the njl model , that the phase diagram is weakly dependent on @xmath35 as long as @xmath61 mev ( this is also found in @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , in our work we shall for simplicity set @xmath58 for all @xmath62 .    with @xmath63 ,",
    "a complete set of nontrivial susceptibilities up to fourth order is : @xmath64these are easy to count in the @xmath32 basis , because @xmath65 implies that odd - order derivatives of @xmath35 vanish identically .",
    "when we choose another basis , there can only be 3 , 3 , and 6 independent susceptibilities at 2nd , 3rd and 4th order respectively .",

    "this relation shows that charge fluctuations diverge like the baryon fluctuations near the critical point @xcite .",
    "as explained in the next section and appendix [ app : diagrams ] , the second - order isospin and strange susceptibilities do not have a singularity at the critical point , even in the presence of flavor mixing . by direct computation of @xmath66 and @xmath67 in the njl model below",
    ", we will verify this fact . on the other hand , because the correlation length in the fireball may peak at @xmath68 fm , only about twice the thermal correlation length ( and much smaller than infinity ) , the difference between the singular iso - scalar critical mode contribution and the smooth model - dependent contributions to correlations may be less dramatic .    to relate the @xmath69 susceptibilities to the derivatives with respect to quark susceptibilities we need to rewrite partition function in terms of the @xmath69 charges .",
    "the grand canonical partition function can be expressed as @xmath70where @xmath71 is the number operator , i.e. the time component of the conserved current .",

    "[ fig : b - fo ] ( top ) . for the lower @xmath163 freeze - out lines",
    "( green dashed and blue dotted lines ) , the loop does not close .",
    "even so , the low @xmath163/high @xmath107 end of the trajectory is the same for all freeze - out lines because the statistics and fluctuations are given by @xmath165-dominated thermal distributions there .",
    "these plots show clearly the ordering of features @xmath166which was found also in the gn and ising models .",

    "in this paper , we have investigated the behaviour of non - gaussian fluctuations of baryon number , electric charge and strangeness on the phase diagram .",
    "our purpose was to characterize their dependence at @xmath2 and find robust qualitative features that can be used to help interpret experimental data in the search for a qcd critical point .",
    "to this end , we evaluated the third- and fourth - order susceptibilities in the njl model , which is in the same universality class as qcd .",
    "our analysis is limited to the mean - field approximation which means that we have not included several known corrections : modifications to the critical exponents controlling the divergence of the correlation length at the cep , and model - dependent corrections described by higher - dimensional operators in the low energy effective field theory .",
    "the corrections to the critical exponents are better known quantitatively , but model - dependent corrections are less well - controlled and their importance is not known in the context of the physical fireball where the correlation length of the critical mode may not be much larger than thermal correlation length .",
    "we have found several characteristics of the third- and fourth - order susceptibilities that are likely to be robust .",
    "these are :    1 .",
    "baryon number fluctuations are the largest in amplitude .",
    "this is because they are dominantly composed of the leading singular contributions from the light quark susceptibilities .",
    "charge fluctuations are suppressed by numerical coefficients , as seen by comparing the expansions in eq.([3susceptibilities ] ) and eq.([4susceptibilites ] ) .",
    "strangeness fluctuations are the smallest in amplitude , though at high order they also show a singularity at the critical point .",
    "the strangeness fluctuations are suppressed by the relatively large bare mass of the strange quark , @xmath171 .",
    "the critical region  where we see non - monotonicity in @xmath159 and @xmath160 along hypothetical freeze - out linesis largest for baryon number fluctuations .",
    "therefore it provides the largest signal for freeze - outs occurring farther in the @xmath172 plane from the cp .",
    "this act follows from the amplitude of the fluctuations being largest .",
    "3 .   the qualitative profile of the third and fourth order susceptibilities along the freeze - out line is model - independent .",
    "@xmath159 for both @xmath145 has a single peak at a temperature greater than the cp .",
    "@xmath160 has first a minimum and then a peak as the critical point is approached from high @xmath163 ( equivalently larger collision energy @xmath37 ) .",
    "the @xmath173 negative region may be accessible at chemical freeze - out in the symmetry broken phase .",
    "these behaviours have been seen in the gn and njl models .",
    "the features of the @xmath159 and @xmath160 freeze - out profiles obey a numerical ordering temperature or collision energy , given by eq.([tordering ] ) .",
    "this is demonstrated by plotting @xmath160 versus @xmath159 along the freeze - out line , and we have argued this trajectory is difficult to change in qualitative features .    it is our hope that these features can aid the interpretation of experimental data for the third- and fourth - order susceptibilities .",
    "although our results may support preliminary indications of critical behaviour in the data , it is clear that much more work is required to identify these signatures with a qcd critical point .",
    "in our study , we consider the 3-flavor njl model with two degenerate light quarks and a heavier strange quark .",
    "the quark level lagrangian is @xmath174 \\notag \\\\ & -k(\\det\\bar q(1-\\gamma_5)q+\\det\\bar q(1+\\gamma_5)q)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the model parameters are the `` bare '' quark masses @xmath175 and the 4-fermion couplings @xmath176 . in addition , for numerical evaluation of the effective potential below we must introduce a momentum cutoff @xmath177 .",
    "these model parameters are fixed by matching the pion , kaon , @xmath178 masses and the pion decay constant in vacuum , @xmath179mev , @xmath180mev , @xmath181mev and @xmath182mev .",
    "we use the residual freedom to set the light quark mass near the physical point , so that the parameter set is @xmath183 spontaneous symmetry breaking leading to nonzero light quark condensates @xmath184 has greater impact on phenomenology than the explicit breaking from their masses , as is the case in qcd .    to solve the model and study the phase diagram , we take the mean field approximation . after shifting the quark bilinears with their vacuum expectation values @xmath185 , the quark fields can be integrated out , and we obtain an effective potential depending only on @xmath157 and @xmath186 ( @xmath187 ) . as long as the isospin chemical potential @xmath188 the @xmath80 condensates are equal and transition at the same @xmath189 .",
    "pseudoscalar , vector and pseudovector diquark condensates are also suppressed and can be ignored .",
    "experimental data indicates that this condition holds even at the lowest collision energies .",
    "the resulting effective potential has the form @xmath190 where @xmath191 is the heaviside step function , @xmath192 .",
    "the last two terms in @xmath193 are respectively the particle and antiparticle fermi distributions including the chemical potential .",
    "the @xmath194 are effective masses , functions of the condensates @xmath195 the term off - diagonal in flavor implies that the strange quark condensate is discontinuous where the light quark condensates are discontinuous and vice versa .",
    "the larger bare mass of the strange quark means the impact of explicit chiral symmetry breaking is larger than for the light quarks , and its phase transition occurs only for larger chemical potential and temperature , see @xcite for discussion how the position of the critical point depends on the bare quark mass",
    ". if a critical point is accessible to lattice or hic , it will be the light quark critical line , which is at lower chemical potential and temperature .",
    "however , due to the flavor coupling , some evidence of the criticality will be manifest in the strange susceptibilities .",
    "we will discuss this point further below .",
    "the phase diagram is determined by solving the coupled set of gap equations @xmath196 taking the solution that corresponds to the global minimum of the effective potential .",
    "tensor is + 1 in entries with @xmath198 . )",
    "we solve the system using two independent numerical methods , as a quantitative check on our results .",
    "@xmath95-derivatives of the pressure include a term for each flavor @xmath199 the vectors @xmath200 are shorthand for @xmath201 and @xmath202 subscript indicates the derivative is evaluated at the minimum of the potential .",
    "the last factor @xmath203 can be rewritten using the fact that the gap equation is independent of the chemical potential @xmath204 note that the second term contains a factor which has the form of a two - point correlator of the @xmath93 field .",
    "when we write out a general ( second order ) susceptibility , we find two terms @xmath205 a similar relation has been discussed by @xcite .",
    "the first is the second derivative at the minimum of the potential , and the second relates @xmath95-derivatives at different points through the @xmath93 two - point function .",
    "we express this naturally by the diagrams in figure [ fig : suscept2 ] .",
    "this `` @xmath93 correlator '' @xmath206 is not diagonal in flavor space due to the anomaly - induced interaction ( proportional to @xmath207 ) .",
    "the third and fourth order susceptibilities include new terms , such as the @xmath93 three- and four - point functions . by writing out all the diagrams constructed from these pieces ,",
