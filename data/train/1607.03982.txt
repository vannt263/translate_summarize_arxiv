    "each particle in the simulation has a mass of @xmath37 .",
    "dark matter halos were identified using the standard fof algorithm @xcite with a linking length of @xmath38 times the mean inter particle separation .",
    "next , the halos are populated with galaxies of different luminosities .",
    "we use the conditional luminosity function ( clf , * ? ? ?",

    "we make use of the set of clf parameters provided by @xcite to generate model galaxies with @xmath39 band luminosities . following the observational definition ,",
    "the central galaxy is defined as the brightest member and is assumed to be located at the center of the corresponding halo .",
    "its velocity follows the velocity of the dark matter halo center .",
    "other galaxies , referred to as satellite galaxies , are distributed spherically following a nfw @xcite profile where the concentration model of @xcite was adopted .",
    "their velocities are assumed to be the sum of the velocity of the host halo center plus a random velocity drawn from a gaussian distribution with dispersion given by the virial velocity dispersion of the halo .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite and @xcite for details . in general",
    ", one can also populate / generate mock galaxies using more sophisticated methods , e.g. , based on sub - halos or halo merger trees , where the galaxies are not spherically distributed .",
    "however , as we have tested in @xcite , our group finder is not very sensitive to the somewhat non - spherical distribution of galaxies .    in order to convert the @xmath39 band magnitude to the @xmath30 band ,",
    "we first measure the _ cumulative _ luminosity function separately for both the mock and 2mrs samples . assuming that galaxies more luminous in the @xmath39 band are also more luminous in the @xmath30",
    ", we assign a @xmath30 band luminosity ( absolute magnitude ) to each galaxy . in practice",
    ", we relate @xmath40 and @xmath41 through abundance matching : @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the luminosity functions of galaxies in @xmath40 and @xmath41 , respectively .",

    ", we have 41,876 galaxies in our mock 2mrs catalog . the black solid curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : lf ] shows the @xmath30 band luminosity function estimated from our mock sample .",
    "apart from the luminosity function of galaxies , we set out to measure the true halo mass function in the mock 2mrs catalog .",
    "because of the survey magnitude limit , faint galaxies formed in low mass halos might not be observed at high redshift , i.e. , low mass halos can only be detected below a redshift limit . to properly estimate the halo mass function",
    ", one needs to have a complete sample of groups ( halos ) , i.e. to obtain the limiting redshift for a given mass of halos , within which the selection of groups is complete . unlike the luminosity for which the limiting redshift can be directly calculated from the magnitude limit",
    ", we use an empirical way to get the limiting redshift for halos .",
    "first , we calculate the number densities of halos in small redshift and halo mass bins and plot them in the @xmath48-@xmath49 plane using color bars ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : colorbar ] ) .",
    "we can see that the number density of halos of given mass drops sharply above certain redshift . here",

    "[ fig : colorbar ] shows the limiting redshift as a function of @xmath48 we use , which clearly represents a conservative cut to ensure completeness .",
    "once a limiting redshift is adopted , we can calculate the halo mass function using only halos ( and volume ) below this redshift .",
    "[ fig : hmf0 ] shows the halo mass function obtained in this way with dots and error bars . here again , the error bars are estimated using 1000 bootstrap re - samplings . for comparison ,",
    "we also show , using the solid line , the theoretical model predictions given by @xcite . compared with the model prediction ,",
    "the data points are slightly lower at intermediate to low mass range , which is mainly due to cosmic variance , since the overall halo mass function in the whole simulation box is quite consistent with theoretical predictions ( see * ? ? ?",
    "since we have both the true halo and the galaxy membership informations in our mock 2mrs sample , we can use it to test the performance of our group finder . together with the 2mrs observational sample , there are three galaxy group catalogs involved in this paper .",
    "we refer to the two catalogs related with the mock 2mrs samples as ` mockt ' and ` mockg ' respectively .",
    "the former catalog indicates the true group memberships in the fof dark matter halos obtained directly from the simulation , where we use @xmath20 to represent the _ true _ halo mass .",
    "the latter is constructed using our group finder , where the halo masses are estimated using our ` gap ' related mass estimator and are named as @xmath21 .",
    "finally , the group catalog constructed from the 2mrs data is referred to as ` 2mrs ' and the related halo mass are named as @xmath22 . for clarity , we list the differences of the three definitions in table .",
    "[ tab : samples ] , including the group finders that were used to identify galaxy groups , and the methods used to estimate the halo masses .",
    "apart from the above three specific halo mass definitions , we use @xmath50 to represent the general halo masses , including those used in theoretical model predictions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "one of the key steps in the halo - based group finder @xcite is to have accurate estimates of the halo masses of candidate galaxy groups . as demonstrated in @xcite , halo mass",
    "is tightly correlated with the total luminosity of member galaxies . in practice , however , one can only estimate a characteristic luminosity which is the sum of the luminosities of member galaxies brighter than some given limit . for a relatively deep survey such as the sdss , where the limit can be set sufficiently low ,",
    "the characteristic luminosity is a good proxy of the total luminosity and so can be used to indicate halo mass . for a shallow survey like the 2mrs , on the other hand , only a few ( in most cases one or two ) brightest member galaxies in the halos can be observed .",

    "since every groups have the true central galaxies and true halo masses from the simulation , we can obtain this relation directly .",

    "here we adopt the latter and assume that there is a monotonic relation between the luminosity of central galaxy and the mass of dark matter halo , so that a more luminous galaxy resides a more massive halo .",

    "although the @xmath73 relation we obtain may deviates from the true one , especially at the massive end , the deviation can be compensated to some extent by our ` gap'-based correction factor .",
    "our modeling of the @xmath73 relation using eq .",
    "( [ eq : ab3 ] ) is carried out via the following two steps .",
    "first , before we are able to separate galaxies into centrals and satellites with the help of group memberships , we assume that all of them are centrals ( as shown in * ? ? ?",
    "* more than 60% of the galaxies are centrals ) . to show the performance , we have applied this to our mock 2mrs sample , and obtain the ` round 1 ' @xmath77 relation , which is shown in fig .",

    "we also plot , as black solid points , the true median @xmath78 relation obtained from the true centrals and true halo masses in the simulation , with error bars indicate the @xmath52 percentiles of the distributions .",
    "compared to the true relation , we see that , the round 1 relationship shows a general agreement with the true one , with a slight over - prediction of the halo masses at the bright end and slight under - prediction at the faint end .",
    "the deviation at the massive end is caused by the malmquist bias in the @xmath77 relation which can be corrected by the ` gap ' ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the deviation at the faint end is caused by the inclusion of all the galaxies ( including satellites ) in our abundance matching .",
    "as we apply our group finder to the galaxy catalog in the next step , the group membership will enable us to separate galaxies into centrals and satellites .",
    "we can then limit the application of the abundance matching to centrals only , and improve the @xmath73 relation .",
    "after two to three iterations we converge to a new set of group memberships and a new @xmath77 relationship , which is referred to as round 2 and shown as the solid red line in fig .",
    "[ fig : mhlcmock ] . after this step ,",
