    "m79 ( ngc 1904 ) is a centrally condensed , intermediate - metallicity ( [ fe / h ] = @xmath3 ) globular cluster with an extremely blue horizontal branch , extending at its high - temperature end as faint as the main - sequence turnoff .",
    "the cluster s integrated uv spectrum is nearly flat from 1500 to 3300   , and observations with the ultraviolet imaging telescope ( uit ; ) indicate that most of the far - uv flux emanates from individual blue hb ( bhb ) and post - hb stars .    in our current understanding , stars with zero - age - main - sequence mass @xmath4 lose about @xmath5 while ascending the red - giant branch ( rgb ) and eventually produce zero - age horizontal branch ( zahb ) stars with core masses @xmath6 and envelope masses @xmath7 .",
    "a star s location on the zahb is determined by the mass of the hydrogen - rich envelope remaining above the helium - rich core , which for typical globular cluster ages is a function only of the abundances of helium and heavier elements @xmath8 .",
    "stellar evolutionary models imply a spread in @xmath9 , with the bluest hb stars having the lowest masses .",
    "the mass distributions used to derive gross cluster properties from the hb population are most often based on the function introduced by .",
    "this function consists of a gaussian multiplied by polynomial truncation terms designed to ensure that the simulation contains physically possible objects , , stars with @xmath10 .",
    "otherwise , the assumption is not based on any physical understanding of the cause of the hb mass spread .",
    "monte - carlo simulations based on such syntheses have been quite successful in reproducing observed hb morphologies (; , 1994 ; ) ; however , the polynomial truncation terms give distributions that are skewed away from the theoretical limits of the mass range , a situation that may not be desirable for the extremely blue hb of m79 .    in this paper",
    "we analyze the far - uv spectrum of m79 obtained with the hopkins ultraviolet telescope ( hut ) .",
    "our object is to derive constraints on the zahb mass distribution from our far - uv spectrum and from optical photometry .",
    "note that the distribution of stars in the color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) of m79 seems quite different from a gaussian .",
    "we investigate whether a gaussian distribution of masses along the zahb can reproduce this asymmetry by combining the hb evolutionary models of with the synthetic stellar flux distributions of to fit the cluster s optical cmd .",
    "we find that a gaussian distribution of zahb masses with a mean of @xmath11 and standard deviation @xmath1 can indeed reproduce the cluster s cmd .",
    "we use this model to compute synthetic far - uv spectra using a monte carlo algorithm , compare them with the hut spectrum , and find that it can not reproduce the observed far - uv flux distribution . using individual kurucz model flux distributions ,",
    "we derive surface gravities for bhb stars that are significantly lower than theoretical predictions .",
    "this result is consistent with that of for individual hb stars in m15 .",
    "we conclude that more precise constraints on the hb mass distribution must await a resolution of this discrepancy .",
    "the spectrum of m79 was obtained with hut on the astro-1 mission of the space shuttle _ columbia _ in 1990 december .",
    "hut consists of a 0.9-m mirror that feeds a prime - focus spectrograph with a microchannel - plate intensifier and photo - diode array detector .",

    "the spectrograph and telescope are described in detail by .",
    "two observations of m79 were obtained during orbital night through a @xmath13 aperture , with a total integration time of 2366  s. the first observation , of 764  s duration , was begun on 1990 december 5 at ut 15:33:47 ; the second , for 1602  s , was obtained two orbits later , beginning at ut 18:33:45 . during both observations ,",
    "the aperture was centered on the cluster center of light .",
    "the pointing stability was quite good : 1.0  rms in both pitch and yaw for the 1602 s observation and 1.4  and 1.8  rms , respectively , in pitch and yaw for the 764 s pointing .",
    "( pitch corresponds to the short dimension of the hut aperture , yaw to the long dimension . )",
    "the combined spectrum , presented in fig .",
    "[ hut_raw]a , shows strong absorption by atomic hydrogen , but no emission features other than well - known geocoronal lines .",
    "in order to estimate the contribution of the earth s residual atmosphere to the observed spectrum , emission - line profiles were fit to an airglow spectrum taken during orbital night through the same aperture as the m79 observations .",
    "these airglow line profiles were combined with a linear continuum and fit to the region around each airglow line in the cluster spectrum .",
    "the line profiles were held fixed while their fluxes were allowed to vary .",
    "exception was made for the ly@xmath14 and @xmath15 airglow lines , for which a gaussian absorption feature was included in the continuum - plus - airglow model that was fit to the data , and the complex of and airglow features between 903 and 916  , for which the model line shapes , as well as the fluxes , were allowed to vary in fitting the cluster spectrum .",
    "the resulting synthetic airglow spectrum was subtracted from the cluster spectrum .",
    "this procedure led to an oversubtraction of the core of ly@xmath16 ; regions around this line were omitted from subsequent model fits to the spectra .",
    "the airglow lines subtracted are marked in fig .",
    "[ hut_raw]a .",
    "once airglow - subtracted , the spectrum was scaled to correct for pulse - persistence effects .",
    "a constant dark - current contribution was subtracted , as was scattered light from the grating , determined from the count rate between 850 and 895  , a region free from airglow and stellar emission .",
    "the second - order contribution from wavelengths longward of 912  , which affects fluxes longward of 1824  , was also scaled and subtracted .",
    "the raw - counts spectrum was converted to physical units using the hut absolute calibration , based on a model atmosphere of the white dwarf g191-b2b .",
    "comparison with pre - flight and post - flight laboratory measurements indicates that the calibration is accurate to approximately 5% over all wavelengths .",

    "we have used the formulation of in fitting a gaussian hb mass - distribution model to the optical cmd of m79 .",
    "this model assumes that stars on the zahb have a gaussian distribution in mass @xmath20 resulting from variable amounts of mass loss on the rgb : @xmath21 \\left ( m_{rg } - m \\right ) \\exp \\left\\ { - { \\left ( \\frac { \\langle m_{hb}\\rangle - m } { \\sigma } \\right ) } ^2 \\right\\ } , \\label { ldz_dist}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is the mass a star would have at the tip of the rgb if it did not lose mass ( assuming a cluster age of about 15 gyr ) , @xmath23 is the mean amount of mass loss , and @xmath24 is the mass dispersion .",

    "10  000 stars are selected with masses distributed according to the probability distribution @xmath20 and ages chosen from a set of uniform random deviates between 0 and @xmath28 years .",
    "we ignore variations in the main - sequence turn - off mass ( @xmath29 ; ) over this time scale .",
    "given the stellar mass and age , we use the hb evolutionary models of to determine the temperatures and surface gravities of the evolving hb and post - hb stars .",
    "these models assume [ fe / h ] @xmath30 , [ o / fe ] @xmath31 , and a core mass of 0.485 @xmath32 .",
    "stellar magnitudes and colors are then interpolated from the grid of synthetic stellar flux distributions computed by for stars with an abundance @xmath33 , assuming a distance modulus of @xmath34 .",
    "in order to provide a purely empirical measure of the stellar distribution along the hb , define a coordinate `` @xmath35 '' ( similar to @xmath36 in the coordinate system of ) that is linear along the ridge line of the hb , divide the whole length into equal bins , and count the stars populating each bin , perpendicular to the ridge line ( see their figs .",

    "the transformation from a gaussian distribution of initial masses to a skewed distribution of stars along the hb reflects an evolutionary effect of the tracks : stars with @xmath48 evolve to higher luminosities at nearly constant temperature , while those with higher masses cool rapidly , driving the @xmath35 distribution sharply toward the red .",
    "the model hb seems to be about 0.2 magnitudes brighter than the cluster ridge line at @xmath49 and about 0.2 magnitudes fainter at @xmath50 .",

    "to determine whether the gaussian mass - distribution model that best fits the optical cmd of m79 is able to reproduce its far - uv spectrum , we use a monte carlo procedure to construct synthetic cluster spectra .",
    "we select stars at random from our best - fitting model hb , compute their far - uv spectra from the nearest kurucz ( 1992 ) model in @xmath52 space , and sum them until the model flux between 900 and 1768   equals the hut flux in this range . by computing the far - uv spectra for 1000 realizations of this random sampling of the hb mass distribution",
    ", we can accurately assess the probability that the observed spectrum could have been obtained from the model hb distribution .",

    "the models provide a thorough treatment of line blanketing by metals , though kurucz s assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) is inappropriate for stars with high effective temperatures or low surface gravities .",

    "because the systematic errors are comparable to the random statistical errors , it is necessary to relax the standard @xmath54 criterion for goodness of fit . as a guide to how well models can fit hut spectra , we consider the individual globular - cluster uv - bright stars studied by .",
    "for those stars , the best - fitting models yield @xmath60 for @xmath61 and @xmath62 for @xmath63 , respectively .",
    "we will thus consider an acceptable spectrum to be one with @xmath64 and exclude as unacceptable any ensemble of stars that does not yield @xmath64 in at least 5% ( 50 of 1000 ) of its spectra .",

    "the authors estimate the star to have @xmath65 13  000 k , @xmath66 3.3 , and solar abundance .",
    "its abundance is important , for though changes in metallicity have only a minor effect on the flux of kurucz ( 1992 ) models longward of 1200  , line blanketing by metals can vastly alter the apparent continuum level at shorter wavelengths .",
    "spectra have a short - wavelength cutoff of about 1200  , while hut spectra continue to the lyman limit , revealing the extreme sensitivity of the sub - ly@xmath16 continuum to metal - line opacity in stellar atmospheres .",
    "@xcite fit kurucz ( 1992 ) models to hut spectra of three uv - bright stars in globular clusters . in each case , a kurucz model with the cluster metallicity provides a significantly better fit to the data than the best fitting solar - metallicity model .",
    "we thus include a model spectrum of a star with @xmath65 13  000 k , @xmath67 ( interpolated from @xmath68 and 3.5 models ) , and @xmath33 in each of our synthetic spectra .",
    "we seek to model only the bhb of m79 . from its cmd ( fig .",
    "[ m79]a ) , we see that the red end of the cluster s bhb lies at @xmath69 , corresponding to stellar temperatures of about 7500 k. because models with @xmath70 k do not emit significant flux at wavelengths shortward of 1770  , and because the hut spectrum of m79 rises at longer wavelengths , reflecting the contribution of stars at the main - sequence turn - off to the integrated cluster flux , we exclude this region ( @xmath71  ) from our analysis .",
    "we construct 1000 synthetic spectra from the 10  000 stars in our model hb population using the above algorithm and compute @xmath54 for each spectrum .",

    "the idea is less to constrain uniquely the relative strengths of the  absorption and emission features than to maximize the contribution of the model  airglow line .",
    "when this model airglow feature is subtracted from the data , we find no significant change in the resulting absorption line profile , indicating that the discrepancy between the model and the data is not due to errors in our airglow subtraction . we conclude that the gaussian mass distribution that best fits the optical cmd of m79 is unable to reproduce its far - uv spectrum .",
    "hereafter , we shall refer to this distribution of stars as the gaussian model .",
    "we have found that a gaussian distribution of zahb masses is able to reproduce the cmd of m79 , but not its far - uv spectrum .",
    "is this failure a reflection of errors in our zahb mass distribution , or does it point to more subtle problems in our model ? to address this question , we first attempt to reproduce the cluster s far - uv flux distribution using a simple collection of stellar atmosphere models .",
    "we find that the hut spectrum of m79 can be reproduced using only four kurucz model spectra , all with @xmath75 .",

    "we choose @xmath80 to match the observed , then select @xmath81 according to the following scheme : for stars with @xmath82 k , models with @xmath68 are selected ; for those with @xmath83  000 k , @xmath84 ; for stars with 13  @xmath85  000 k , @xmath86 ; and for @xmath87  000 k , @xmath84 .",

    "we believe that this result indicates a real discrepancy between hb evolutionary theory and the models most commonly used to determine stellar parameters , if not between the theory and the stars themselves .    the high metallicity of the stars in the empirical model may be an artifact of the uncertainties in their surface gravities , or may reflect genuine abundance anomalies in the cluster s hb stars . in kurucz s ( 1992 ) model spectra , the apparent far - uv continuum level is determined by the combined absorption of innumerable metal lines .",

    "this is an important task , as it would allow the joint optical / uv technique we have adopted to provide meaningful constraints on the mass distribution of the hb , and the balmer series line fits to provide accurate masses for individual hb stars .",
    "given the current discrepancies between derived stellar parameters and hb evolutionary theory , however , we conclude that it is not yet possible to combine these models to provide meaningful constraints on the zahb mass distribution in globular clusters .",
    "we _ can _ place limits on the temperature distribution of the hb stars in m79 .",
