    "in this paper we present a brief review of some recent work on an alternative way to formulate of quantum mechanical models and present new results concerning the perturbative calculation of what has become known in this theory as the @xmath6 operator",
    ".    in the conventional formulation of quantum mechanics the hamiltonian @xmath0 , which incorporates the symmetries and specifies the dynamics of a quantum theory , must be hermitian : @xmath8 .",
    "the usual meaning of the symbol @xmath9 , which indicates dirac hermitian conjugation , is combined transpose and complex conjugation .",
    "it is commonly thought that a hamiltonian must be hermitian in order to ensure that the energy spectrum ( the eigenvalues of @xmath0 ) is real and that the time evolution of the theory is unitary ( probability is conserved in time ) .",
    "although @xmath8 is sufficient to guarantee these properties , it is not necessary .",
    "indeed , we believe that this condition of hermiticity is a mathematical requirement whose physical basis is somewhat obscure .",
    "recently , a more physical alternative axiom called space - time reflection symmetry ( @xmath10 symmetry ) , @xmath11 , has been investigated .",
    "this symmetry allows for the possibility of complex non - hermitian hamiltonians but still leads to a consistent theory of quantum mechanics .    because @xmath1 symmetry is an alternative condition to conventional hermiticity",
    ", it is now possible to construct infinitely many new hamiltonians that would have been rejected in the past because they are not hermitian in the usual sense .",
    "one example of such a hamiltonian is @xmath12 , which is the quantum mechanical analog of the quantum field theoretic hamiltonian @xmath13 $ ] .",
    "another example of a @xmath4-symmetric non - hermitian hamiltonian is @xmath14 , which is the @xmath1-symmetric analog of the quantum field theoretic hamiltonian @xmath15 $ ] .",
    "this latter hamiltonian could be an interesting candidate for describing the higgs sector of the standard model .",
    "it should be emphasized that we do not regard the condition of conventional hermiticity as wrong .",
    "rather , we view the condition of @xmath1 symmetry as offering the possibility of studying new kinds of quantum theories that have heretofore never been studied because they have been thought to be physically unacceptable .",
    "let us review the properties of the space reflection ( parity ) operator @xmath16 and the time - reflection operator @xmath17 : @xmath18 is a _ linear _ operator with the property that @xmath19 and has the effect @xmath20 and @xmath21 ; @xmath17 is an antilinear operator with the property that @xmath22 and has the effect @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 . the operator @xmath17 is called _ antilinear _ because it changes the sign of @xmath26 .",
    "we know that it reverses the sign of @xmath26 because , like @xmath18 , this operator preserves the fundamental commutation relation of quantum mechanics , @xmath27=i$ ] , known as the heisenberg algebra .",
    "it is easy to construct hamiltonians of the form @xmath28 that are not hermitian but do possess @xmath1 symmetry . the trick is to take the potential to be a function of @xmath29 : @xmath30 . we also impose a general condition that has not been widely emphasized in the literature ; namely , we require that @xmath0 be symmetric : @xmath31 , where @xmath32 represents the transpose .",
    "the reason for this symmetry condition will become clear later on . for example , consider the one - parameter family of symmetric hamiltonians @xmath33 where @xmath34 is real .",
    "while @xmath0 in ( [ e1 ] ) is not symmetric under @xmath18 or @xmath17 separately , it is invariant under their combined operation .",
    "such hamiltonians are said to possess space - time reflection symmetry .",
    "other examples of complex hamiltonians having @xmath1 symmetry are @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and so on @xcite .",
    "note that these classes of hamiltonians are all _",
    "different_. for example , the hamiltonian obtained by continuing @xmath0 in ( [ e1 ] ) along the path @xmath37 has a different spectrum from the hamiltonian that is obtained by continuing @xmath36 along the path @xmath38 .",
    "this is because the boundary conditions on the eigenfunctions are different .",
    "the class of @xmath1-symmetric hamiltonians is larger than and includes real symmetric hermitians because any real symmetric hamiltonian is @xmath1-symmetric .",
    "for example , consider the real symmetric hamiltonian @xmath39 .",
    "this hamiltonian is time - reversal symmetric , but according to the usual definition of space reflection for which @xmath21 , this hamiltonian does not appear to have @xmath1 symmetry .",
    "however , the parity operator is defined only up to unitary equivalence , and if we express the hamiltonian in the form @xmath40 , then it is evident that @xmath0 is @xmath1 symmetric provided that the parity operator performs a space reflection about the point @xmath41 rather than @xmath42 .",
    "@xcite for the general construction of the relevant parity operator .    with properly defined boundary conditions",
    "the spectrum of the hamiltonian @xmath0 in ( [ e1 ] ) is _ real and positive _ when @xmath43 @xcite and the spectrum is partly real and partly complex when @xmath44 .",
    "the eigenvalues have been computed numerically to very high precision , and the real eigenvalues are plotted as functions of @xmath34 in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] .    the @xmath1 symmetry of a hamiltonian @xmath0 is said to be _ unbroken _ if all of the eigenfunctions of @xmath0 are simultaneously eigenfunctions of @xmath45 .",
    "note that even if a system is defined by an equation that possesses a discrete symmetry , the solution to this equation need not exhibit that symmetry .",
    "for example , although the differential equation @xmath46 is symmetric under time reversal @xmath47 , the solutions @xmath48 and @xmath49 do not exhibit time - reversal symmetry ; other solutions , such as @xmath50 , are time - reversal symmetric .",
    "the same is true of a system whose hamiltonian is @xmath1 symmetric .",
    "even if the schrdinger equation and corresponding boundary conditions are @xmath1 symmetric , the wave function that solves the schrdinger equation boundary value problem need not be symmetric under space - time reflection .",
    "when the solution exhibits @xmath1 symmetry , we say that the @xmath1 symmetry is unbroken .",
    "conversely , if the solution does not possess @xmath1 symmetry , we say that the @xmath1 symmetry is broken .",
    "it is extremely easy to prove that if the @xmath1 symmetry of a hamiltonian @xmath0 is unbroken , then the spectrum of @xmath0 is real : assume that ( i ) @xmath0 possesses @xmath1 symmetry ( that is , that @xmath0 commutes with the @xmath1 operator ) , and ( ii ) if @xmath51 is an eigenstate of @xmath0 with eigenvalue @xmath52 , then it is simultaneously an eigenstate of @xmath1 with eigenvalue @xmath53 ( it is this second assumption of _ unbroken _ @xmath4 symmetry that is crucial ) : @xmath54 we first show that the eigenvalue @xmath53 is a pure phase .",
    "we multiply @xmath55 on the left by @xmath1 and use the fact that @xmath18 and @xmath17 commute and that @xmath56 to conclude that @xmath57 and thus @xmath58 for some real @xmath59 .",
    "next , we introduce a convention used throughout this paper . without loss of generality",
    "we replace the eigenstate @xmath51 by @xmath60 so that its eigenvalue under the operator @xmath1 is unity : @xmath61 . next , we multiply the eigenvalue equation @xmath62 on the left by @xmath1 and use @xmath63=0 $ ] to obtain @xmath64 . hence ,",
    "@xmath65 and the eigenvalue @xmath52 is real .",
    "the crucial step in the argument above is the assumption that @xmath51 is simultaneously an eigenstate of @xmath0 and @xmath1 . in quantum mechanics",
    "if a linear operator @xmath66 commutes with the hamiltonian @xmath0 , then the eigenstates of @xmath0 are also eigenstates of @xmath66 .",
    "however , we emphasize that the operator @xmath1 is not linear ( it is antilinear ) and thus we must make the extra assumption that the @xmath1 symmetry of @xmath0 is unbroken ; that is , that @xmath51 is simultaneously an eigenstate of @xmath0 and @xmath1 . this extra assumption is nontrivial because it is difficult to determine _ a priori _ whether the @xmath1 symmetry of a particular hamiltonian @xmath0 is broken or unbroken . for the hamiltonian @xmath0 in ( [ e1 ] )",
    "the @xmath1 symmetry is unbroken when @xmath43 and it is broken when @xmath44 .",
    "the conventional hermitian hamiltonian for the quantum mechanical harmonic oscillator lies at the boundary of the unbroken and the broken regimes .",
    "recently , dorey _ et al .",
    "_ proved rigorously that the spectrum of @xmath0 in ( [ e1 ] ) is real and positive @xcite in the region @xmath43 .",
    "many other @xmath1-symmetric hamiltonians for which space - time reflection symmetry is not broken have been investigated , and the spectra of these hamiltonians have also been shown to be real and positive @xcite .",
    "it is important to know whether a given non - hermitian @xmath1-symmetric hamiltonian has a positive real spectrum , but the most urgent question is whether such a hamiltonian defines a physical theory of quantum mechanics . by a _ physical theory _ we mean that there is a hilbert space of state vectors and that this hilbert space has an inner product with a positive norm . in quantum mechanics",
    "we interpret the norm of a state as a probability and this probability must be positive .",
    "furthermore , we must show that the time evolution of the theory is unitary .",
    "this means that as a state vector evolves in time the probability does not leak away . with these considerations in mind",
    "one would wonder whether a hamiltonian such as @xmath0 in ( [ e1 ] ) gives a consistent quantum theory .",
    "indeed , early investigations of this hamiltonian have shown that while the spectrum is entirely real and positive when @xmath43 , one inevitably encountered the severe problem of a hilbert space endowed with an indefinite metric @xcite .",
    "however , there is a new symmetry that all @xmath1-symmetric hamiltonians having an unbroken @xmath1-symmetry possess @xcite .",
    "we denote the operator representing this symmetry by @xmath6 because the properties of this operator resemble those of the charge conjugation operator in particle physics .",
    "this allows us to introduce an inner product structure associated with @xmath67 conjugation for which the norms of quantum states are positive definite .",
    "because of this we can say that @xmath1 symmetry is an alternative to conventional hermiticity ; it introduces the new concept of a _ dynamically determined _ inner product ( one that is defined by the hamiltonian itself ) .",
    "consequently , we can extend the hamiltonian and its eigenstates into the complex domain so that the associated eigenvalues are real and the underlying dynamics is unitary .",
    "this shows that @xmath1-symmetric hamiltonians are hermitian in an extended ( non - dirac ) sense .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ s2 ] we give a general discussion of the @xmath6 operator and in sec .",
    "[ s3 ] we present a simple @xmath68 matrix example of this operator . in sec .",
    "[ s4 ] we show how to calculate @xmath6 using perturbation theory for the cubic hamiltonian @xmath69 . in secs .",
    "[ s5 ] and [ s6 ] we calculate @xmath6 for quantum mechanical hamiltonians having two and three degrees of freedom .",
    "this is the principal new result in this paper . in secs .",
    "[ s7 ] and [ s8 ] we consider possible physical applications and draw some conclusions .",
    "we begin by summarizing the mathematical properties of the solution to the sturm - liouville differential equation eigenvalue problem @xmath70 associated with the hamiltonian @xmath0 in ( [ e1 ] ) .",
    "this differential equation must be imposed on an infinite contour in the complex-@xmath71 plane . for large @xmath72",
    "this contour lies in wedges placed symmetrically with respect to the imaginary-@xmath71 axis @xcite .",
    "the boundary conditions on the eigenfunctions are that @xmath73 exponentially rapidly as @xmath74 along the contour . for @xmath75",
    ", the contour may lie on the real axis .",
    "when @xmath43 , the hamiltonian has an unbroken @xmath1 symmetry .",
    "thus , we know that the eigenfunctions @xmath76 are simultaneously eigenstates of the @xmath1 operator : @xmath77 as we argued above , @xmath78 is a pure phase and , without loss of generality , for each @xmath79 this phase can be absorbed into @xmath76 by a multiplicative rescaling so that the new eigenvalue under @xmath1 is unity : @xmath80    it is not known rigorously yet , but there is strong evidence that when properly normalized the eigenfunctions @xmath76 are complete .",
    "the coordinate - space statement of completeness reads @xmath81 this nontrivial result has been verified numerically to extremely high accuracy ( twenty decimal places ) @xcite .",
    "there is a factor of @xmath82 in the sum .",
    "this unusual factor does not appear in conventional quantum mechanics .",
    "the presence of this factor is explained in the following discussion of orthonormality [ see ( [ e8 ] ) ] in which we encounter the problem associated with non - hermitian @xmath1-symmetric hamiltonians .",
    "there seems to be a natural choice for the inner product of two functions @xmath83 and @xmath84 : @xmath85g(x ) , \\label{e7}\\ ] ] where @xmath86^*$ ] and the integration path is the appropriate contour in the complex-@xmath71 plane .",
    "[ we will see that ( [ e7 ] ) is _ not _ the correct choice for an inner product because it gives an indefinite metric .",
    "the correct inner product will be defined shortly , but studying this inner product is useful because it reveals the underlying mathematical structure of the theory .",
    "] the apparent advantage of this inner product is that the associated norm @xmath87 is independent of the overall phase of @xmath83 and is conserved in time because @xmath0 commutes with @xmath1 and the time - evolution operator is @xmath88 .",
    "phase independence is desired because in quantum mechanics the objective is to construct a space of rays to represent quantum mechanical states . with respect to this inner product ,",
    "the eigenfunctions @xmath89 and @xmath76 of @xmath0 in ( [ e1 ] ) are orthogonal for @xmath90 because @xmath0 is symmetric . however ,",
    "when we set @xmath91 we see by direct numerical calculation that the norm is evidently _ not positive _ :",
    "@xmath92 this result is apparently true for all values of @xmath34 in ( [ e3 ] ) , and it has been verified numerically to extremely high precision . because the norms of the eigenfunctions alternate in sign , the metric associated with the @xmath1 inner product @xmath93 is indefinite .",
    "this sign alternation appears to be a _",
    "generic _ feature of this @xmath1 inner product .",
    "[ extensive numerical calculations verify that the formula in ( [ e8 ] ) holds for all @xmath43 .",
    "] we emphasize that while the sign of the norm of @xmath94 is hard to verify analytically , the orthogonality of @xmath95 and @xmath94 is a trivial consequence of the symmetry of @xmath0 .",
    "it is necessary to assume that @xmath0 be symmetric in order to have this orthogonality .    in spite of the nonpositivity of the inner product",
    ", it is instructive to proceed with the usual analysis that one would perform for any sturm - liouville problem of the form @xmath96 .",
    "first , we use the inner product formula ( [ e8 ] ) to verify that ( [ e6 ] ) is the representation of the unity operator .",
    "that is , we verify that @xmath97 .",
    "second , we show how to reconstruct the parity operator @xmath18 in terms of the eigenstates . in coordinate space",
    "the parity operator is given by @xmath98 , so from ( [ e6 ] ) we get @xmath99 by virtue of ( [ e8 ] ) the square of the parity operator is unity : @xmath100 .",
    "third , we reconstruct @xmath0 in coordinate space : @xmath101 using ( [ e6 ] )  ( [ e8 ] ) we can see that @xmath0 satisfies @xmath102 .",
    "fourth , we construct the coordinate - space green s function @xmath103 : @xmath104 the green s function is the functional inverse of @xmath0 ; that is , @xmath105 satisfies @xmath106g(x , z)= \\delta(x - z ) .",
    "\\label{e12}\\ ] ] the time - independent schrdinger equation ( [ e3 ] ) can not be solved analytically ; it can only be solved numerically or perturbatively .",
    "however , the differential equation for @xmath107 in ( [ e12 ] ) _ can _ be solved exactly and in closed form because it is a bessel equation @xcite .",
    "the technique is to consider the case @xmath108 so that we may treat @xmath71 as real and then to decompose the @xmath71 axis into two regions , @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "we solve the differential equation in each region in terms of bessel functions and patch the solutions together at @xmath111 .",
    "then , using this coordinate - space representation of the green s function , we construct an exact closed - form expression for the _ spectral zeta function _ ( sum of the inverses of the energy eigenvalues ) .",
    "to do so we set @xmath112 in @xmath107 and use ( [ e8 ] ) to integrate over @xmath71 .",

    "all of these general sturm - liouville constructions are completely standard .",
    "but now we must address the crucial question of whether a @xmath1-symmetric hamiltonian defines a physically viable quantum mechanics or whether it merely provides an amusing sturm - liouville eigenvalue problem .",
    "the apparent difficulty with formulating a quantum theory is that the vector space of quantum states is spanned by energy eigenstates , of which half have @xmath1 norm @xmath115 and half have @xmath1 norm @xmath116 .",
    "because the norm of the states carries a probabilistic interpretation in standard quantum theory , the existence of an indefinite metric in ( [ e8 ] ) seems to be a serious obstacle .",
    "the situation here in which half of the energy eigenstates have positive norm and half have negative norm is analogous to the problem that dirac encountered in formulating the spinor wave equation in relativistic quantum theory @xcite .",
    "following dirac s approach , we attack the problem of an indefinite norm by finding a physical interpretation for the negative norm states .",
    "we claim that in _ any _ theory having an unbroken @xmath1 symmetry there exists a symmetry of the hamiltonian connected with the fact that there are equal numbers of positive - norm and negative - norm states . to describe this symmetry we construct a linear operator denoted by @xmath6 and represented in position space as a sum over the energy eigenstates of the hamiltonian @xcite : @xmath117    the properties of this new operator @xmath6 closely resemble those of the charge conjugation operator in quantum field theory .",
    "for example , we can use ( [ e6 ] )  ( [ e8 ] ) to verify that the square of @xmath6 is unity ( @xmath118 ) : @xmath119 thus , the eigenvalues of @xmath6 are @xmath120 .",
    "also , @xmath6 commutes with the hamiltonian @xmath0 . therefore , since @xmath6 is linear , the eigenstates of @xmath0 have definite values of @xmath6 .",
    "specifically , if the energy eigenstates satisfy ( [ e8 ] ) , then we have @xmath121 because @xmath122 we then use @xmath123 according to our convention .",
    "we conclude that @xmath6 is the operator observable that represents the measurement of the signature of the @xmath1 norm of a state .",
    "note that since the @xmath6 operator measures the @xmath1 norm of a state , we can think of the @xmath1 norm as the @xmath6 `` charge '' of the state .",
    "the operators @xmath18 and @xmath6 are distinct square roots of the unity operator @xmath124 .",
    "that is , @xmath125 , but @xmath126 .",
    "indeed , @xmath18 is real , while @xmath6 is complex .",
    "note that the parity operator in coordinate space is explicitly real @xmath127 ; the operator @xmath128 is complex because it is a sum of products of complex functions , as we see in ( [ e14 ] ) .",
    "the complexity of the @xmath6 operator can be seen explicitly in perturbative calculations of @xmath128 @xcite .",
    "we show how to perform these perturbative calculations in secs .",
    "[ s4 ] and [ s5 ] .",
    "furthermore , these two operators do not commute ; in the position representation @xmath129 which shows that @xmath130 .",
    "however , @xmath6 _ does _ commute with @xmath1 .",
    "finally , having obtained the operator @xmath6 we define a new inner product structure having _ positive definite _ signature by @xmath131g(x ) .",
    "\\label{e18}\\ ] ] this inner product is phase independent and conserved in time like the @xmath10 inner product ( [ e7 ] ) . this is because the time evolution operator , just as in ordinary quantum mechanics , is @xmath132 .",
    "the fact that @xmath0 commutes with the @xmath1 and the @xmath67 operators implies that both inner products , ( [ e7 ] ) and ( [ e18 ] ) , remain time independent as the states evolve in time .",
    "however , unlike ( [ e7 ] ) , the inner product ( [ e18 ] ) is positive definite because @xmath6 contributes @xmath116 when it acts on states with negative @xmath1 norm . in terms of the @xmath67 conjugate",

    "\\label{e19}\\ ] ] unlike the inner product of conventional quantum mechanics , the @xmath67 inner product ( [ e19 ] ) is _ dynamically determined _ ; it depends implicitly on the hamiltonian .",
    "the operator @xmath6 does not exist as a distinct entity in conventional quantum mechanics .",
    "indeed , if we allow the parameter @xmath34 in ( [ e1 ] ) to tend to zero , the operator @xmath6 in this limit becomes identical with @xmath18 .",
    "thus , in this limit the @xmath67 operator becomes @xmath17 , which is just complex conjugation .",
    "as a consequence , the inner product ( [ e18 ] ) defined with respect to the @xmath67 conjugation reduces to the complex conjugate inner product of conventional quantum mechanics when @xmath134 .",
    "similarly , in the @xmath134 limit , ( [ e19 ] ) reduces to the usual statement of completeness @xmath135 .",
    "the @xmath67 inner - product ( [ e18 ] ) is independent of the choice of integration contour @xmath136 so long as @xmath136 lies inside the asymptotic wedges associated with the boundary conditions for the sturm - liouville problem ( [ e2 ] ) .",
    "path independence follows from cauchy s theorem and the analyticity of the integrand . in ordinary quantum mechanics , where the positive - definite inner product has the form @xmath137 , the integral",
    "must be taken along the real axis and the path of the integration can not be deformed into the complex plane because the integrand is not analytic .",
    "[ note that if a function satisfies a linear ordinary differential equation , then the function is analytic wherever the coefficient functions of the differential equation are analytic .",
    "the schrdinger equation ( [ e3 ] ) is linear and its coefficients are analytic except for a branch cut at the origin ; this branch cut can be taken to run up the imaginary axis .",
    "we can choose the integration contour for the inner product ( [ e8 ] ) so that it does not cross the positive imaginary axis .",
    "path independence occurs because the integrand of the inner product ( [ e8 ] ) is a product of analytic functions . ] the @xmath1 inner product ( [ e7 ] ) shares with ( [ e18 ] ) the advantage of analyticity and path independence , but suffers from nonpositivity .",
    "we find it surprising that a positive - definite metric can be constructed using @xmath67 conjugation without disturbing the path independence of the inner - product integral .    why are @xmath1-symmetric theories unitary ?",
    "time evolution is determined by the operator @xmath88 whether the theory is expressed in terms of a @xmath1-symmetric hamiltonian or just an ordinary hermitian hamiltonian .",
    "to establish the global unitarity of a theory we must show that as a state vector evolves , its norm does not change in time . if @xmath138 is a prescribed initial wave function belonging to the hilbert space spanned by the energy eigenstates , then it evolves into the state @xmath139 at time @xmath140 according to @xmath141 with respect to the @xmath67 inner product defined in ( [ e18 ] ) , the norm of the vector @xmath139 does not change in time , @xmath142 , because the hamiltonian @xmath0 commutes with the @xmath67 operator .",
    "establishing unitarity at a local level is more subtle . here",
    ", we must show that in coordinate space , there exists a local probability density that satisfies a continuity equation so that the probability does not leak away .",
    "this is a nontrivial consideration because the probability current flows about in the complex plane rather than along the real axis as in conventional hermitian quantum mechanics .",
    "preliminary numerical studies indeed indicate that the continuity equation is fulfilled @xcite .",
    "just as states in the schrdinger picture evolve in time according to the usual equation ( [ e19a ] ) , operators @xmath143 also evolve according to the conventional heisenberg - picture equation @xmath144 given this equation , it is clear how to define an _",
    "observable _ in @xmath45-symmetric quantum mechanics .",
    "the crucial property of an observable in any theory of quantum mechanics is that its expectation value in a state must be real .",
    "this will be true if @xmath145 where @xmath32 signifies transpose .",
    "if this condition is fulfulled by a linear operator in a theory defined by a @xmath1-symmetric hamiltonian , we say that the operator is `` @xmath146 symmetric '' and is an observable .",
    "note that this condition is the analog of the usual condition in conventional quantum mechanics that an observable be hermitian in the usual dirac sense @xmath147 : @xmath148 the condition for an operator to _ remain _ an operator as time evolves is simply that @xmath0 be symmetric : @xmath149 .",
    "this symmetry condition has been implicitly assumed in all of the @xmath1-symmetric models discussed in the literature .",

    "these clearly have to be respected when one is attempting to calculate the @xmath6 operator .",
    "obviously , the problem of degenerate states makes it very difficult to calculate the @xmath6 operator in systems having more that one degree of freedom .",
    "the problems associated with degeneracy can , in fact , be overcome and the techniques for doing so are described in a paper under preparation by bender , brody , and jones @xcite ; in this paper it is shown that it is even possible to find @xmath6 for systems having an infinite number of degrees of freedom ( quantum field theory ) .",
    "we do not know if non - hermitian , @xmath1-symmetric hamiltonians can be used to describe experimentally observable phenomena .",
    "however , non - hermitian hamiltonians have _ already _ been used to describe interacting systems .",
    "for example , wu showed that the ground state of a bose system of hard spheres is described by a non - hermitian hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "wu found that the ground - state energy of this system is real and conjectured that all energy levels were real .",
    "hollowood showed that even though the hamiltonian of a complex toda lattice is non - hermitian , its energy levels are real @xcite .",
    "non - hermitian hamiltonians of the form @xmath2 also arise in reggeon field theory models that exhibit real positive spectra @xcite . in each of these cases",
    "the fact that a non - hermitian hamiltonian had a real spectrum appeared mysterious at the time , but now the explanation is simple : in each case the non - hermitian hamiltonian is @xmath1-symmetric and in each case the hamiltonian was constructed so that the position operator @xmath71 or the field operator @xmath51 is always multiplied by @xmath26 .    an experimental signal of a complex hamiltonian might be found in the context of condensed matter physics .",
    "consider the complex crystal lattice whose potential is @xmath370 . while the hamiltonian @xmath371 is not hermitian , it is @xmath1-symmetric and all of its energy bands are _",
    "real_. however , at the edge of the bands the wave function of a particle in such a lattice is always bosonic ( @xmath372-periodic ) and , unlike the case of ordinary crystal lattices , the wave function is never fermionic ( @xmath373-periodic ) @xcite .",
    "direct observation of such a band structure would give unambiguous evidence of a @xmath1-symmetric hamiltonian .",
    "there are many opportunities for the use of non - hermitian hamiltonians in the study of quantum field theory .",
    "many field theory models whose hamiltonians are non - hermitian and @xmath1-symmetric have been studied : @xmath4-symmetric electrodynamics is a particularly interesting theory because it is asymptotically free ( unlike ordinary electrodynamics ) and because the direction of the casimir force is the negative of that in ordinary electrodynamics @xcite .",
    "this theory is remarkable because it can determine its own coupling constant .",
    "supersymmetric @xmath1-symmetric quantum field theories have also been studied @xcite .",
    "a scalar quantum field theory with a cubic self - interaction described by the lagrangian @xmath374 is physically unacceptable because the energy spectrum is not bounded below .",
    "however , the cubic scalar quantum field theory that corresponds to @xmath0 in ( [ e1 ] ) with @xmath375 is given by the lagrangian density @xmath376 this is a new , physically acceptable quantum field theory .",
    "we have found that @xmath1-symmetric quantum field theories exhibit surprising and new phenomena .",
    "for example , consider the theory that corresponds to @xmath0 in ( [ e1 ] ) with @xmath377 , which is described by the lagrangian density @xmath378 for example , for @xmath379 sufficiently small this @xmath380 theory possesses bound states ( the conventional @xmath381 theory does not because the potential is repulsive ) .",
    "the bound states occur for all dimensions @xmath382 @xcite , but for purposes of illustration we describe the bound states in the context of one - dimensional quantum field theory ( quantum mechanics ) .",
    "for the conventional anharmonic oscillator , which is described by the hamiltonian @xmath383 the small-@xmath379 rayleigh - schrdinger perturbation series for the @xmath384th energy level @xmath385 is @xmath386 \\qquad(\\nu\\to0^+ ) , \\label{e30}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath387 .",
    "renormalized mass _ @xmath388 is defined as the first excitation above the ground state : @xmath389 $ ] as @xmath390 .    to determine if the two - particle state is bound , we examine the second excitation above the ground state using ( [ e30 ] ) .",
    "we define @xmath391\\qquad(\\nu\\to0^+ ) .",
    "\\label{e31}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if @xmath392 , then a two - particle bound state exists and the ( negative ) binding energy is @xmath393 .",
    "if @xmath394 , then the second excitation above the vacuum is interpreted as an unbound two - particle state .",
    "we see from ( [ e31 ] ) that in the small - coupling region , where perturbation theory is valid , the conventional anharmonic oscillator does not possess a bound state . indeed , using wkb , variational methods , or numerical calculations",
    ", one can show that there is no two - particle bound state for any value of @xmath395 . because there is no bound state the @xmath396 interaction",
    "may be considered to represent a repulsive force .",
    "note that in general , a repulsive force in a quantum field theory is represented by an energy dependence in which the energy of a two - particle state decreases with separation .",
    "the conventional anharmonic oscillator hamiltonian corresponds to a field theory in one space - time dimension , where there can not be any spatial dependence . in this case",
    "the repulsive nature of the force is understood to mean that the energy @xmath397 needed to create two particles at a given time is more than twice the energy @xmath388 needed to create one particle .",
    "the perturbation series for the non - hermitian , @xmath1-symmetric hamiltonian @xmath398 is obtained from the perturbation series for the conventional anharmonic oscillator by replacing @xmath399 .",
    "thus , while the conventional anharmonic oscillator does not possess a two - particle bound state , the @xmath4-symmetric oscillator does indeed possess such a state .",
    "we measure the binding energy of this state in units of the renormalized mass @xmath388 and we define the _ dimensionless _ binding energy @xmath400 by @xmath401 this bound state disappears when @xmath402 increases beyond @xmath403 . as @xmath402 continues to increase , @xmath400 reaches a maximum value of @xmath404 at @xmath405 and then approaches the limiting value @xmath406 as @xmath407 .    in the @xmath1-symmetric anharmonic oscillator , there are not only two - particle bound states for small coupling constant but also @xmath384-particle bound states for all @xmath408 .",
    "the dimensionless binding energies are @xmath409 the coefficient of @xmath402 is negative . since the dimensionless binding energy becomes negative as @xmath402 increases from @xmath410 ,",
    "there is a @xmath384-particle bound state .",
    "the higher multiparticle bound states cease to be bound for smaller values of @xmath402 ; starting with the three - particle bound state , the binding energy of these states becomes positive as @xmath402 increases past @xmath411 , @xmath412 , @xmath413 , and @xmath414 .",
    "thus , for any value of @xmath402 there are always a finite number of bound states and an infinite number of unbound states .",
    "the number of bound states decreases with increasing @xmath402 until there are no bound states at all .",
    "there is a range of @xmath402 for which there are only two- and three - particle bound states , just like the physical world in which one observes only states of two and three bound quarks . in this range of @xmath402",
    "if one has an initial state containing a number of particles ( renormalized masses ) , these particles will clump together into bound states , releasing energy in the process . depending on the value of @xmath402",
    ", the final state will consist either of two- or of three - particle bound states , whichever is energetically favored .",
    "there is a special value of @xmath402 for which two- and three - particle bound states can exist in thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "how does a @xmath415 theory compare with a @xmath381 theory ?",
    "a @xmath416 theory has an attractive force .",
    "bound states arising as a consequence of this force can be found by using the bethe - salpeter equation . however , the @xmath417 field theory is unacceptable because the spectrum is not bounded below .",
    "if we replace @xmath379 by @xmath418 , the spectrum becomes real and positive , but now the force becomes repulsive and there are no bound states .",
    "the same is true for a two - scalar theory with interaction of the form @xmath419 , which is an acceptable model of scalar electrodynamics that has no analog of positronium .",
    "another feature of @xmath1-symmetric quantum field theory that distinguishes it from conventional quantum field theory is the commutation relation between the @xmath18 and @xmath6 operators . if we write @xmath420 , where @xmath421 and @xmath422 are real , then @xmath423 and @xmath424 .",
    "these commutation and anticommutation relations suggest the possibility of interpreting @xmath1-symmetric quantum field theory as describing both bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom , an idea analogous to the supersymmetric quantum theories .",
    "the distinction here , however , is that the supersymmetry can be broken ; that is , bosonic and fermionic counterparts can have different masses without breaking the @xmath1 symmetry .",
    "therefore , another possible observable experimental consequence might be the breaking of the supersymmetry .",
    "we have described an alternative to the axiom of standard quantum mechanics that the hamiltonian must be hermitian .",
    "we have shown that hermiticity may be replaced by the more physical condition of @xmath1 ( space - time reflection ) symmetry .",
    "space - time reflection symmetry is distinct from the conventional dirac condition of hermiticity , so it is possible to consider new quantum theories , such as quantum field theories whose self - interaction potentials are @xmath425 or @xmath380 . such theories have previously been thought to be mathematically and physically unacceptable because the spectrum might not be real and because the time evolution might not be unitary .",
    "these new kinds of theories are extensions of ordinary quantum mechanics into the complex plane ; that is , continuations of real symmetric hamiltonians to complex hamiltonians .",
    "the idea of analytically continuing a hamiltonian was first discussed by dyson , who argued heuristically that perturbation theory for quantum electrodynamics diverges @xcite .",
    "dyson s argument involves rotating the electric charge @xmath426 into the complex plane @xmath427 .",
    "applied to the anharmonic oscillator ( [ e29 ] ) , dyson s argument goes as follows : if the coupling constant @xmath379 is continued in the complex-@xmath379 plane to @xmath428 , then the potential is no longer bounded below , so the resulting theory has no ground state .",
    "thus , the ground - state energy @xmath429 has an abrupt transition at @xmath430 . as a series in powers of @xmath379",
    ", @xmath429 must have a zero radius of convergence because @xmath429 is singular at @xmath430 .",
    "hence , the perturbation series must diverge for all @xmath431 .",
    "the perturbation series does indeed diverge , but this heuristic argument is flawed because the spectrum of the hamiltonian ( [ e32 ] ) that is obtained remains ambiguous until the boundary conditions that the wave functions must satisfy are specified .",
    "the spectrum depends crucially on how this hamiltonian with a negative coupling constant is obtained .",
    "there are two ways to obtain @xmath0 in ( [ e32 ] ) .",
    "first , one can substitute @xmath432 . under this rotation",
    ", the ground - state energy @xmath429 becomes complex .",
    "evidently , @xmath433 is real and positive when @xmath395 and complex when @xmath434 .",
    "note that rotating from @xmath435 to @xmath436 , we obtain the same hamiltonian as in ( [ e32 ] ) but the spectrum is the complex conjugate of the spectrum obtained when we rotate from @xmath435 to @xmath437 .",
    "second , one can obtain ( [ e32 ] ) as a limit of the hamiltonian @xmath438 as @xmath439 .",
    "the spectrum of this hamiltonian is real , positive , and discrete .",
    "the spectrum of the limiting hamiltonian ( [ e32 ] ) obtained in this manner is similar in structure to that of the hamiltonian in ( [ e29 ] ) .",
    "how can the hamiltonian ( [ e32 ] ) possess two such astonishingly different spectra ?",
    "the answer lies in the boundary conditions satisfied by the wave functions @xmath76 . in the first case , in which @xmath440 is rotated in the complex-@xmath379 plane from @xmath410 to @xmath441",
    ", @xmath442 vanishes in the complex-@xmath71 plane as @xmath74 inside the wedges @xmath443 and @xmath444 . in the second case ,",
    "in which the exponent @xmath34 ranges from @xmath410 to @xmath445 , @xmath76 vanishes in the complex-@xmath71 plane as @xmath74 inside the wedges @xmath443 and @xmath446 . in this second case the boundary conditions hold in wedges that are symmetric with respect to the imaginary axis ; these boundary conditions enforce the @xmath1 symmetry of @xmath0 and are responsible for the reality of the energy spectrum .",
    "apart from the spectra , there is yet another striking difference between the two theories corresponding to @xmath0 in ( [ e32 ] ) .",
    "the one - point green s function @xmath447 is defined as the expectation value of the operator @xmath71 in the ground - state wave function @xmath448 , @xmath449 where @xmath450 is a contour that lies in the asymptotic wedges described above .",
    "the value of @xmath447 for @xmath0 in ( [ e32 ] ) depends on the limiting process by which we obtain @xmath0 .",
    "if we substitute @xmath451 into the hamiltonian ( [ e29 ] ) and rotate from @xmath435 to @xmath437 , we find by an elementary symmetry argument that @xmath452 for all @xmath379 on the semicircle in the complex-@xmath379 plane .",
    "thus , this rotation in the complex-@xmath379 plane preserves parity symmetry ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "however , if we define @xmath0 in ( [ e32 ] ) by using the hamiltonian in ( [ e35 ] ) and by allowing @xmath34 to range from @xmath410 to @xmath445 , we find that @xmath453 .",
    "indeed , @xmath453 for _ all _ values of @xmath113 .",
    "thus , in this theory @xmath1 symmetry ( reflection about the imaginary axis , @xmath454 ) is preserved , but parity symmetry is permanently broken .    finally , we point out that the `` wrong - sign '' field theory described by the lagrangian density ( [ e28 ] ) is remarkable because , in addition to the energy spectrum being real and positive , the one - point green s function ( the vacuum expectation value of the field @xmath455 ) is _ nonzero _ @xcite . furthermore ,",
    "the field theory is renormalizable , and in four dimensions is asymptotically free ( and thus nontrivial ) @xcite .",
    "based on these features , we believe that a @xmath380 quantum field theory the theory may provide a useful setting to describe the dynamics of the higgs sector in the standard model .",
