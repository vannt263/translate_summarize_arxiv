    "in astronomy , the highest angular resolution is obtained with ery ong aseline nterferometry ( vlbi ) .",
    "vlbi observations at short millimeter wavelengths ( mm - vlbi ) provide angular resolutions in the ten micro - arcsecond range ( i.e. @xmath0@xmath1as for a @xmath2 km baseline at @xmath3 mm ( @xmath4ghz ) ) . while vlbi observations at 2 mm and 1 mm wavelength are still in a stage of technical development , 3 mm vlbi experiments are performed on a regular basis .",
    "the global mm - vlbi array ( gmva ) is operational since early 2000 . at 86ghz ( @xmath5 mm )",
    ", it combines the european antennas ( effelsberg 100 m , pico veleta 30 m , the phased plateau de bure interferometer 6x15 m , onsala 20 m , metshovi 14 m ) with the vlba . with the participation of the two sensitive iram telescopes and the 100 m effelsberg telescope ,",
    "the array sensitivity is improved by a factor of @xmath6 , when compared to the vlba alone . for compact galactic and extragalactic radio sources",
    ", the gmva provides vlbi images with an angular resolution of down to @xmath7@xmath1as .    in the following we present and discuss results from mm - vlbi observations of the nuclei of m87 and of sgra*. when expressed in terms of schwarzschild radii ( @xmath8 ) , the spatial resolution obtained for m87 and sgra * become very comparable .",
    "m87 is about @xmath9 times more distant than sgra * , but has a putative black hole at its center , which is also @xmath9 times more massive than that of sgra*. present day 3mm - vlbi therefore allows to image both sources with a spatial resolution of only @xmath10 . in view of the morphological difference between sgra * and m87 ( the latter exhibits a long relativistic jet ) , a comparison of the sub - milliarcsecond structure and kinematics of both objects may lead to a better understanding of the astro - physical processes acting in the vicinity of such super - massive black holes .",
    "the giant elliptical galaxy m87 ( ngc4486 , 3c274 , virgoa ) is one of the closest radio galaxies with a prominent radio jet .",
    "its relative brightness at millimeter wavelengths makes it ideally suited for high angular resolution mm - vlbi studies , which address the still unanswered question how the powerful jets in radio - galaxies and quasars are launched and collimated .    at a distance of d=16.75mpc ( whitmore et al .",
    "199 ) an angular scale of 0.1mas corresponds to a spatial scale of @xmath11 cm ( 0.0081pc ) .",
    "this translates to @xmath12 schwarzschild radii for an assumed @xmath13 super - massive black hole at the center of m87 ( e.g. machetto et al . 1997 ) .",
    "global 3 mm vlbi observations , performed at the edge of the accessible vlbi observing bands , have revealed new images of the inner - most region of m87 .",
    "the 3 mm vlbi images shown in figure 1 were made from observations performed during 20022004 and show a one - sided core - jet structure , extending @xmath14mas to the west .",
    "the complexity of the source structure and the only moderate dynamic range of the maps ( lower sensitivity in earlier observations ) do not yet allow to relate the individual structural components seen at the different epochs with each other and by this determine the jet kinematics . despite the obvious limitations , which will be overcome in the near future",
    ", a number of basic statements can already be made :    \\(i ) in the maps , an unresolved compact component at the eastern end of the jet is seen .",
    "an upper limit to its size is given by the ( elliptical ) vlbi observing beam .",
    "the uniformly weighted and un - tapered beam size of the observations of april 2004 is @xmath15as , which gives an upper limit to the size of the jet base ( vlbi core ) of @xmath16 .",
    "circular gaussian model fitting yields a typical flux density of @xmath17jy and a size of @xmath18as ( @xmath19 ) for the vlbi core .",
    "this results in a brightness temperature of @xmath20k , clearly indicative of non - thermal ( synchrotron ) radiation .",
    "\\(ii ) the 86ghz vlbi map of april 2004 looks remarkably similar to two previously observed 43ghz vlbi maps , which indicate conical jet - expansion on sub - milliarcsecond scales ( junor et al .",
    "1999 , ly et al .",
    "2004 ) . the new 86ghz maps , which have a @xmath14 times higher resolution , reveal a bifurcated ( possibly edge - brightened ) expanding one - sided jet , with the southern edge of the emission cone being brighter and more compact than the northern part .",
    "the fact that the northern edge of the cone ( at @xmath21mas ) is almost invisible in the maps of 2002 and 2003 may be explained with dynamic range limitations in these two maps .",
    "\\(iii ) the large morphological differences seen between the three 86ghz maps indicate structural variations on time - scales of less than one year . on angular scales",
    "@xmath22mas , all three maps show some south - west oriented jet emission oriented along a position angle of @xmath23 . in april 2003 ,",
    "the source was @xmath24 times brighter than usual , and a bright component was seen at the map center ( at zero position ) . since in hybrid vlbi imaging using closure phases",
    "the absolute position information is lost , this bright component most likely should not be identified with the jet base ( vlbi - core ) . instead , the fainter component located @xmath25mas in the north - east , may be identified with the vlbi - core .",
    "we note the tentative detection of a possible counter - jet at 43ghz ( ly et al . 2004 ) , which however was not seen earlier ( junor et al .",
    "1999 ) , nor at longer wavelengths ( dodson et al .",
    "2006 ) , nor in our 86ghz vlbi maps of 2002 and 2004 .",
    "\\(iv ) owing to the limited time sampling at 86ghz , a detailed kinematic study of the component motion in the inner jet of m87 is not yet possible .",
    "similar to the case of many other vlbi jets , we may assume that the bright central component seen in april 2003 was ejected from the vlbi core after a flux density outburst .",
    "this would give an apparent rate of change of @xmath26mas / yr , corresponding to an apparent velocity of @xmath27c .",
    "this speed would be consistent with the observed motion of @xmath28c seen at larger core separations with vlbi at 15ghz ( kellermann et al .",
    "2004 ) , and with a lower limit of 0.25c from vlbi at 43ghz ( ly",
    "on the other hand , if we compare the relative positions of the two main secondary components seen in april 2002 and april 2004 ( at @xmath29mas & @xmath30mas , respectively ) stationarity of the inner jet components can not be excluded .",
    "more frequent vlbi observations are necessary to determine the jet kinematics .",
    "we like to point out that a measurement of vlbi core size and of the jet s transverse width as a function of core separation , are very important parameters for theoretical jet models . the class of models , which are based on the magnetic sling shot mechanism ( blandford & payne 1982 ) predict a minimum transverse width of the jet after initial acceleration to be of order @xmath31 , ( with bulk lorentz factor @xmath32 and light cylinder radius @xmath33 , e.g. tomimatsu & takahashi 2003 ) . notably such jets are expected to be hollow ( edge - brightened ) , just as observed here .",
    "after collimation , the light cylinder has a radius of at least @xmath34 @xmath35 ( camenzind 1990 , fendt & memola , 2001 , casse & keppens 2004 ) , which sets a lower bound to the observable jet width . with jet lorentz - factors in the range @xmath36 ( biretta et al .",
    "1999 ) , we expect a minimum jet width of @xmath37 .",
    "the observed diameter of the jet ( at @xmath38mas ) is @xmath39mas , or @xmath40 ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "this is at the lower end of the expected range , favoring a moderately low bulk lorentz - factor ( @xmath41 ) in this region .    at its origin near the black hole ,",
    "the diameter of the jet depends on the size of the region , where it is initially accelerated . in the blandford & payne type models ,",
    "the twisted magnetic field lines are anchored in the inner part of the rotating accretion disk . the minimum jet width",
    "is then determined by the diameter of the least stable orbit , which is at @xmath42 for a schwarzschild bh , and @xmath43 for a rotating kerr bh ( e.g. meier et al .",
    "the observed small size of the vlbi core ( @xmath44 ) is already within a factor of @xmath45 near these values , suggesting that the width of the ` jet - nozzle ' is indeed of order of the light cylinder diameter . since the radiating jet boundary can not be indefinitely thin",
    ", one could expect that the observed jet width is a bit larger than the light cylinder .",
    "in this case , the observed small size of the vlbi core would point more towards jet models , in which the jet gains energy directly from bh - rotation ( blandford & znajek 1977 , see also mckinney 2006 ) . better vlbi images and more specific theoretical",
    "modeling of jet opening angle and speed will help to discriminate between the different types of models ( e.g. blandford & payne versus blandford & znajek ) , and may tell to what degree black hole rotation plays a role in jet formation .",
    "* 3 mm : * from the early 1990 s onwards , sgra * was repeatedly observed with vlbi at 3.5 mm ( 86ghz ) in various array configurations , using european , american and global vlbi arrays ( krichbaum et al .",
    "1994 , rogers et al .",
    "1994 , doeleman et al .",
    "2001 , etc . ) . in figure 2",
    "we show one of the early maps from global 3 mm vlbi , which reveals a partially resolved point sources , similar to the recently published vlba image ( shen et al . 2005 ) . at mm - wavelengths ,",
    "the accurate determination of flux density and size is often affected by calibration uncertainties ( low source elevation on the northern hemisphere , atmospheric opacity variations ) .",
    "this requires special observing and calibration methods . in parallel to the ongoing research with the vlba , we have continued to observed sgra * , using the sensitive and large antennas at mpifr ( effelsberg 100 m telescope ) and at iram ( pico veleta 30 m , plateau de bure 6 x 15 m ) . with baseline lengths of @xmath46 km , and a detection sensitivity of @xmath47mjy ( @xmath48 , 512 mbit / sec ) per baseline",
    ", this array measures the visibility amplitudes and ( closure- ) phases with particular high @xmath49 . in april and october 2004 ,",
    "sgra * was moderately bright with flux densities of @xmath50jy and @xmath51jy , respectively .",
    "in october 2005 , however , the source was detected with a much higher signal - to - noise ratio than before ( @xmath52 on pv - pdb ) . a preliminary analysis of the new data yields ( via circular gaussian model fitting ) a flux density of @xmath53jy and a size of @xmath54mas .",
    "the relatively high source flux is confirmed independently by atca measurements , performed 3 days after our vlbi experiment ( @xmath55jy , z .- q .",
    "shen , priv .",
    "the source size appears marginally larger ( by @xmath56 ) , when compared to our previous size measurements in 2004 ( @xmath57mas and @xmath58mas ) , and in comparison to the vlba measurements of shen et al .",
    "2005 , who obtained @xmath59mas with the vlba . as in previous observations ,",
    "the closure phase ( see figure 3 ) is close to zero ( within @xmath60 ) , showing no evidence for a deviation from the known point - like ( or symmetric ) structure . in figure 5",
    ", we plot all available 86ghz vlbi size measurements , using the data from the literature and including own unpublished old and new data .",
    "if one excludes the new data point of october 2005 , the weighted mean average size is @xmath58mas .",
    "this appears significantly smaller than the october 2005 measurement . for comparison",
    "we also show in fig .",
    "5 the sizes at 43ghz ( weighted mean : @xmath61mas ) and the flux density of sgra * at 86ghz .",
    "it will need a denser 3 mm vlbi monitoring to check , if the brightness distribution of sgra * indeed is variable . in view of the observed flux density variations at millimeter wavelengths ( see miyoshi et al .",
    ", miyazaki et al . , marrone et al . , this conference ) , structural variability of sgra * would be not unexpected ( see bower et al .",
    "2004 for possible size variations at 7 mm ) .",
    "* 2 mm : * vlbi observations at wavelengths shorter than 3 mm are still difficult and are limited by the number of available radio telescopes and their sensitivity . in a pilot vlbi experiment at 147ghz ( 2 mm ) , which aimed at first fringe detection across the atlantic at this short wavelength , sgra * was observed among a dozen other agn ( krichbaum et al .",
    "several agn were detected on the long ( @xmath62 km ) baseline between spain ( pico veleta ) and the arizona telescopes ( kitt peak ( kp ) 12 m , heinrich - hertz telescope ( hht ) 10 m ) , which limits the size of their compact emission regions to @xmath63@xmath1as .",
    "sgra * was detected with a signal - to - noise ratio of @xmath64 on the short ( 85m@xmath65 ) baseline between kp and hht . with a total flux density of @xmath66jy and a correlated flux density of @xmath67jy",
    "an upper limit to its size of @xmath68mas can be derived , fully consistent with the measured sizes at 3 mm and 1.4 mm .",
    "* 1 mm : * in april 2003 , our attempt to observe sgra * with global vlbi at 230ghz failed due to weather and technical problems . in this experiment , which was motivated in a similar manner as the 2 mm vlbi experiment",
    "described before , several bright agn were observed .",
    "finally two blazars ( 3c454.3 , 0716 + 714 ) were detected with @xmath69 on the 6.4g@xmath65 baseline between pico veleta and hht ( krichbaum et al .",
    "although limited by receiver performance and stability of local oscillators at hht , this experiment demonstrates the technical feasibility of global vlbi at 1.3 mm , and sets a new record in angular resolution . for the detected compact radio sources we obtained sizes of @xmath70@xmath1as .",
    "with such a high angular resolution , which would correspond to a spatial resolution of @xmath71 schwarzschild radii in sgra * , the direct ( vlbi- ) imaging of the immediate vicinity of a smbh should become possible within the next few years .",
    "we now like to make a remark with regard to the previous 215ghz vlbi observations of sgra * published earlier ( krichbaum et al .",
    "recently , eckart et al . 2006",
    "( also eckart et al . , this conference ) detect an emission component d1 of @xmath72mas size , located @xmath73 mas west of sgr a*. with single dish radio telescopes operating at short mm-/sub - mm wavelengths , in - beam confusion between sgra * and d1 leads to an over - estimate of the total flux density of sgra * in this spectral band ( by @xmath74jy for @xmath75k ) , at least partially removing the so called sub - mm excess ( e.g .. serabyn et al .",
    "1997 , falcke et al .",
    "in fact , a less pronounced or non - existing sub - mm excess , leads to a flat synchrotron - self - absorbed radio spectrum as observed in many other agn .",
    "this then would allow an interpretation of the high energy data via the synchrotron - self - compton process ( see eckart et al .",
    "2004 & 2006 ) .",
    "the existence of such an extended emission region , which is fully resolved and therefore invisible to vlbi , was considered by krichbaum et al .",
    "1998 as a possibility to explain the apparent discrepancy between observed total flux ( from single antenna measurements ) and the correlated vlbi flux , which originates from the compact component .",
    "relating the sub - mm excess of the total spectrum mainly to the flux contribution of component d1 , allows to redetermine the total flux of sgra * at 215ghz and reject ` case 1 ' in the discussion of krichbaum et al .",
    "this leads to refined estimate of the observed size for sgra * at 215ghz : @xmath76as , which corresponds to a linear size of @xmath77 schwarzschild radii and a robust lower limit of @xmath78 .",
    "the observed frequency dependence of the source size of sgra * ( fig .",
    "4 ) is commonly interpreted as being due to scatter broadening by the intervening interstellar medium .",
    "the intrinsic size is determined by the deconvolution of the observed size @xmath79 with the extrapolated scattering size @xmath80 : @xmath81 .",
    "the exact form of the assumed scattering law ( @xmath82 , with fit parameters @xmath83 ) determines @xmath84 . in figure 4",
    "we show a few illustrative least - square fit lines , which were obtained from all at present available size measurements , selecting those above @xmath85 cm and performing a fit to ( i ) only the major axis , ( ii ) the geometric mean of major and minor axis , and ( iii ) the most recent ( @xmath86 ) data .",
    "the resulting mean slopes in the range of @xmath87 deviate slightly from the slope of @xmath88 other authors recently have used ( bower et al .",
    "2004 , shen et al .",
    "2005 and references therein ) .",
    "depending on the number of data points included in the fit , their weighting scheme and the frequency range over which the fit is performed , one obtains slightly different estimates of the intrinsic size of sgra*. since the size determination at the shortest wavelengths ( @xmath89 mm ) is still restricted to a circular gaussian component , we determine the de - convolved intrinsic size of sgra * using the geometric mean size from major and minor axis at wavelengths .",
    "formally we obtain the following sizeskpc and @xmath90 an angle of 0.1mas corresponds to @xmath91 : @xmath92 at 7 mm , @xmath93 at 3.4 mm , @xmath94 at 2 mm , and @xmath95 at 1.4 mm .",
    "global mm - vlbi performed at the shortest wavelengths ( @xmath96 mm ) will allow to study sgra * ( and other agn like , e.g. m87 ) with a resolution of only a few schwarzschild radii , facilitating the direct imaging of the immediate vicinity of super - massive black holes .",
    "global mm - vlbi observations of sgra * are clearly a great challenge and demand coordinated efforts . in figure 6",
    "we show simulations of visibility amplitudes and closure phases for a realistic near future global mm - vlbi observation of sgra * at 230ghz .",
    "new telescopes like apex ( to be later replaced by alma ) located in the southern hemisphere , and phased interferometers operating as single vlbi antennas ( pdb , carma , sma ) are crucial to provide the necessary sensitivity on the longest baselines .",
    "when these telescopes become available for mm - vlbi , we may hope to image the environment of the smbh in sgra * and detect possible deviations from circular symmetry , which are theoretically predicted for a rotating accretion disk black hole system .",
