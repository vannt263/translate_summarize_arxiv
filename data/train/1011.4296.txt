    "one of the most significant advances in contemporary theoretical physics has been the realization that certain geometric backgrounds in string theory have completely equivalent descriptions as ordinary quantum field theories .",
    "thanks to this gauge / gravity correspondence , many new insights have been obtained on both sides .",
    "the archetypal example is the @xmath3 solution of type iib supergravity , with the round einstein metric on @xmath4 , which corresponds to @xmath5 super - yang - mills theory @xcite .",
    "in fact , according to the ads / cft correspondence , _ any _ supersymmetric @xmath0 solution admits a dual description in terms of a four - dimensional superconformal field theory ( scft ) . in this paper",
    "we shall elucidate the geometric structure of such general solutions , and explain how it maps to important properties of scfts .    following on from the @xmath3 solution ,",
    "a rich class of special solutions takes the form @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is a sasaki - einstein five - manifold @xcite .",
    "the latter is by definition a compact five - manifold whose metric cone @xmath8 is khler and ricci - flat , _",
    "i.e. _  calabi - yau .",
    "the dual scfts have @xmath2 supersymmetry and can be understood as arising on a stack of d3-branes located at the apex of the cone .",
    "some essential properties of these scfts , such as the central charge and the conformal dimensions of chiral primary operators , are captured by their abelian r - symmetry @xcite .",
    "this corresponds geometrically to a canonical killing vector field @xmath9 , which is real holomorphic with respect to the complex structure on the calabi - yau cone , and is also the _ reeb vector field _",
    "associated with the contact structure on @xmath7 descending from the symplectic structure of the cone .",
    "recall here that a _ contact form _ on an odd - dimensional manifold of dimension @xmath10 is a one - form @xmath11 such that @xmath12 is nowhere zero , _",
    "i.e. _  a volume form .",
    "it is a standard result that there is always a unique vector field @xmath9 , called the reeb vector field , such that @xmath13 , @xmath14 .",
    "the central charge of the field theory may then be expressed as the _ volume _ of @xmath7 @xcite , while the volumes of supersymmetric three - submanifolds give the conformal dimensions of chiral primary operators corresponding to wrapped d3-branes .",
    "the most general solutions of type iib supergravity with fluxes dual to @xmath2 scfts take the form @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is a compact riemannian five - manifold that in general is _ not _ sasaki - einstein .",
    "the requirement of supersymmetry puts certain constraints on @xmath16 , and in particular the cone @xmath17 is _ generalized calabi - yau _",
    "@xcite , in the sense of hitchin @xcite that it carries a non - degenerate closed pure spinor , and thus an integrable generalized complex structure .",
    "in addition to this , there is a second compatible generalized complex structure , which although non - integrable nevertheless implies that the cone is _ symplectic",
    "_ @xcite ( provided the five - form flux sourced by d3-branes is non - vanishing ) .",
    "precisely as in the sasaki - einstein case , one can define a canonical killing vector field which is also the reeb vector field @xmath9 associated with the induced contact structure on @xmath16 .",
    "the difference with the sasaki - einstein case is that @xmath9 is now _",
    "generalized holomorphic _ , that is holomorphic with respect to the generalized complex structure ( there is no complex structure in general ) .",
    "remarkably , the volume formulas for the central charge and the conformal dimensions of chiral primary operators still hold in this generalized setting , but now in terms of _ contact volumes _ @xcite .    as shown in @xcite , a very useful perspective is to regard sasaki - einstein metrics as critical points of the einstein - hilbert action restricted to a space of _ sasakian _ metrics , whose cones are by definition khler but not necessarily ricci - flat .",
    "more precisely , on the space of sasakian metrics whose cones admit a nowhere - vanishing holomorphic @xmath18-form @xmath19 , with homogeneous degree three under the euler vector field @xmath20 , the einstein - hilbert action precisely reduces to the _ volume _ functional .",
    "this volume actually depends only on the reeb vector field , and a critical point hence determines the unique reeb vector field for which a sasakian manifold is also einstein , provided such a metric exists .",
    "this allows one to extract important geometric information _ without having to know the sasaki - einstein metric explicitly_. this is extremely useful since there are now many existence results for sasaki - einstein metrics ( for a review , see @xcite ) , with vast classes of examples not known explicitly . notwithstanding",
    "this ignorance , one can still compute the volumes of these solutions by volume minimization @xcite and compare them to bps quantities in the conjectured dual scfts .",
    "as first suggested in @xcite , the determination of the reeb vector field by volume minimization corresponds to the determination of the r - symmetry of a four - dimensional @xmath2 scft by @xmath21-maximization @xcite .",
    "the procedure involves constructing a trial r - symmetry , which mixes arbitrarily with the set of global ( flavour ) abelian symmetries , and imposing anomaly cancellation constraints .",
    "the correct r - symmetry at the infrared fixed point is then the one which ( locally ) maximizes the trial central charge .",
    "proof _ that the trial central charge function ( appropriately interpreted ) is equal to the inverse of the `` off - shell '' sasakian volume function was presented in @xcite for toric ( that is , @xmath22-invariant ) sasakian metrics , and very recently in @xcite for general sasakian metrics .    since @xmath21-maximization applies in principle to every @xmath2 scft",
    ", it is clearly desirable to extend the procedure of volume minimization beyond the sasaki - einstein case , to the most general supersymmetric @xmath0 solutions of type iib supergravity .",
    "this is one of the goals of the present paper .",
    "the motivation is the same as in the sasaki - einstein case : _ explicit _ solutions will form a very small subset of the space of _ all _ solutions , since finding them always relies on having a large amount of symmetry . on the other hand , one might hope that the development in this paper will eventually lead to _ existence _ results , say for toric @xmath0 solutions with general fluxes ; then volume minimization and the results of @xcite will allow one to compute bps quantities for these solutions .",
    "following our previous work in these references , the approach we will take is to reformulate the backgrounds in terms of generalized geometry .",
    "we begin in section [ gensas ] by expressing the constraints imposed on the cone @xmath17 by supersymmetry in a geometric form .",
    "after reduction on the euler and reeb vector fields @xmath20 and @xmath9 , we obtain a system of equations on a four - dimensional transverse space for a _",
    "triple of orthogonal symplectic forms _ @xmath23 , a structure first studied in @xcite , and two functions @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "more precisely , the symplectic forms satisfy [ cond1 ] _ i & = & 0  i \\{0,1,2 }  , + _ i_j&= & 0   ij  , + _ 0_0 & = & _ 1  _ 1 _ 1  =  _ 2  _ 2 _ 2  0  , where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are positive functions depending on @xmath24 and @xmath25 , together with the following differential conditions : [ cond2 ] _ 1 & = & 12__h_2  , _ _",
    "1 )  =  _ _ ^-4 _ 2  . here",
    "the notation @xmath28 means the _ hamiltonian vector field _ for the function @xmath24 , with respect to the symplectic form @xmath29 .",
    "this differential system defines what we will call a `` _ _ generalized sasakian geometry__. '' , but we shall not comment further on this here . ] in fact , there is in general also a special subspace of @xmath16 where @xmath24 diverges and @xmath25 is constant , along which the geometry is simply sasakian .",
    "this `` type - change locus '' @xmath30 corresponds physically to the _ mesonic moduli space _ of the dual scft @xcite  for a sasakian manifold @xmath30 is of course the whole space , rather than a subspace .",
    "note that the set of conditions  also gives a notion of `` _ _ generalized khler geometry _ _ '' for the transverse space to the reeb foliation , although we shall not use this terminology as the meaning is different to that already introduced in @xcite .",
    "the upshot is that when such a generalized sasakian manifold satisfies an additional condition on the lengths of the three symplectic forms , it precisely provides a general supersymmetric @xmath0 solution of type iib supergravity ( with non - zero d3-brane charge ) .",
    "as we shall see , this additional condition is effectively the einstein equation .    in section [ genvolume ]",
    "we explain how volume minimization works for generalized sasakian manifolds .",
    "we show that the type iib supergravity action reduces , when restricted to a space of generalized sasakian structures , to the _ contact volume _ , and that the latter is then a strictly convex function of the reeb vector field , as shown in appendix [ contactappendix ] .",
    "it follows that a supersymmetric @xmath0 solution that is in the same deformation class as a given generalized sasakian manifold is obtained by minimizing the contact volume over a space of reeb vector fields . as a concrete example , the critical reeb vector field for which a _ toric _ generalized sasakian manifold satisfies also the einstein equation is obtained by minimizing the volume of a polytope , just as in the sasakian case .",
    "however , in contrast to the sasakian case , generalized volume minimization requires not the holomorphic @xmath18-form , but rather the _ pure spinor _",
    "@xmath31 , which is a formal sum of one- , three- , and five - forms , to be homogeneous of degree three .",
    "this imposes additional constraints on the space of reeb vector fields that is to be minimized over . here",
    ", our current understanding of the space of reeb vector fields for a deformation class of generalized sasakian manifolds is not yet as developed as in the sasakian case @xcite .",
    "we will nevertheless show in _ examples _ that this space is non - trivial , and that generalized volume minimization agrees with computations in dual scfts .",
    "in fact , we go further and make the natural conjecture that the volume function is _ equal _ to the inverse of the trial central charge of the dual scft , again checking this is indeed true in examples . as a very simple illustration we recurrently refer to a so - called `` @xmath32-transform '' of @xmath33 by a bivector @xmath32 , which is known to be dual to a certain marginal deformation of @xmath5 super - yang - mills theory @xcite . in section [ genconifolds ]",
    "we then study a new class of examples obtained by mass deformation of generalized conifolds @xmath34 @xcite . after making some physically motivated assumptions on the geometry ,",
    "we verify in this class of examples the equivalence of generalized volume minimization and @xmath21-maximization .",
    "we begin with a brief summary of generalized geometry , focusing on the results that are most relevant for what follows .",
    "we then proceed to study a pair of compatible generalized structures with pure spinors @xmath31 and @xmath35 , on which the requirement of supersymmetry imposes the following differential constraints @xcite : [ susyconstraints ] & _ -  =  0  , & + & ( ^-a _ + )  =  0  , ^ _ - ( ^-3a _ + )  =  0  . & here the function @xmath36 is a conformal factor , @xmath37 is the ( integrable ) generalized complex structure associated with @xmath31 , and @xmath38 $ ] . if @xmath31 and @xmath35 have the same _ length _ , with respect to the mukai norm , then with the addition of an appropriate conical symmetry these conditions are equivalent to those for a supersymmetric @xmath0 solution of type iib supergravity @xcite .",
    "however , relaxing this compatibility condition on the lengths of @xmath39 will give us our definition of a _",
    "generalized sasakian _",
    "manifold ; in particular , this definition reduces to the definition of a sasakian manifold in the case without fluxes .",
    "the closure of @xmath31 implies that the cone is generalized calabi - yau , in the sense of hitchin @xcite .",
    "the generalized darboux theorem of @xcite then allows one to locally put @xmath31 into a normal form .",
    "the second generalized structure @xmath35 is instead related to the background fluxes .",
    "this structure is not integrable , but it nevertheless provides a symplectic structure on the cone . after reduction along the euler and reeb vector fields , the compatibility condition between @xmath31 and @xmath35 leads to a system involving a symplectic triple on the transverse space to the reeb foliation .",
    "more precisely , this is true away from a sublocus along which the generalized sasakian structure in fact becomes sasakian .",
    "the fluxes also satisfy a bianchi identity , the third equation in ( [ susyconstraints ] ) , which gives an additional differential constraint .",
    "we first recall a few relevant facts about generalized complex geometry .",
    "we refer the reader to section 2 of @xcite for a concise review , to @xcite for an extensive mathematical introduction , or to the review @xcite for physicists .",
    "a pure spinor @xmath19 on a manifold @xmath40 , in the generalized geometry sense , can be understood as a formal sum of complex differential forms of even or odd degrees , on which the clifford algebra action of a generalized vector field @xmath41 is given by @xmath42 .",
    "more precisely , the even and odd forms of indefinite degree on a @xmath43-dimensional manifold @xmath40 are irreducible representations of the clifford algebra cliff@xmath44 associated with @xmath45 , with even and odd chirality respectively .",
    "the annihilator space of @xmath19 is defined as @xmath46 , and then purity of @xmath47 means that @xmath48 is _ maximal _ isotropic , _",

    "this is an endomorphism of @xmath60 with @xmath61 , which is defined by identifying the @xmath62-eigenspace of @xmath59 with @xmath63 .",
    "the condition @xmath64 , for some generalized vector field @xmath65 , is equivalent to @xmath59 being integrable .",
    "this means that @xmath63 is closed under the courant bracket @xcite .",
    "if @xmath40 is equipped with a non - degenerate closed pure spinor , @xmath66 , then @xmath40 is called _ generalized calabi - yau _ in the sense of hitchin @xcite .    at any given point on @xmath40",
    "a pure spinor takes the general form & = & _ 1 _ k ^-b +  , where the @xmath67 are complex one - forms and @xmath68 , @xmath69 real two - forms .",

    "indeed , the compatibility condition gives @xmath94 , which says that @xmath69 is a @xmath95-form with respect to the complex structure @xmath93 . from the expressions for @xmath73 and @xmath74 above",

    "this is the case , for instance , in the topological string and in purely neveu - schwarz solutions of type ii string theories  a short and highly incomplete list of references is @xcite . for general @xmath0 solutions of type iib string theory",
    ", however , the presence of background fluxes on the cone is an obstruction to the full integrability of @xmath74 . as we pointed out in section [ reviewgcg ] , this is true even for sasaki - einstein backgrounds .",
    "thus integrability of @xmath74 is too strong .",

    "the presence of the @xmath219 factor sets the homogeneous degree of this symplectic form to two , again as one wants for a _",

    "these conditions now explain the presence of @xmath223 in the definition : its homogeneity property is required to balance the degree three of @xmath35 .    for the five - form component @xmath110",

    "constant_. from the string theory point of view , this follows since in type iib supergravity the full rr five - form is self - dual , and thus of the form [ freundrubin ] f_5 ( _ ads+ _ y )  .",
    "the bianchi identity is @xmath226 , but the right - hand side vanishes since by construction @xmath227 and @xmath228 are three - forms on @xmath16 .",

    "this constant is then necessarily non - zero if @xmath35 is everywhere type zero , as we have already assumed , and as shown in proposition [ propplus ] below .",
    "the above are the full set of conditions we shall impose .",
    "the motivation largely came from the fact that these conditions are implied by supersymmetry , as shown in @xcite .",
    "however , hopefully the above discussion also motivates these as natural geometric conditions . as we shall see later , they are not quite the _ full _ set of conditions required for a supersymmetric @xmath0 solution .",
    "in fact the structure we have now defined is in some sense the generalized version of _ khler cones _ , and we analogously call the base @xmath16 a _ generalized sasakian manifold_. the following proposition summarizes the consequences of the above conditions , which also justify our use of terminology :    * the function @xmath217 is related to the radial function @xmath103 and the conformal factor @xmath25 through ^a & = & r ^  . * the generalized reeb vector field @xmath9 preserves the generalized metric as well as the rr fluxes : _ g & = & 0  , _ ( ^-b f )  =  0  . *",

    "in fact this step , although correct , is a little cavalier : notice that the above formula is really valid only on the dense open set @xmath342 where the integrable structure is of type one .",
    "thus strictly speaking we end up with an integral over an infinitesimal boundary around the type - change locus after applying stokes theorem .",
    "one can then check that the integrand is smooth as one approaches the type - change locus and thus this integral is indeed zero . to see this",

    "we are now in a position to outline the procedure of volume minimization for generalized sasakian manifolds .    in the previous section",
    "we have shown that the action ( [ zy ] ) for a space of supergravity fields on @xmath16 , restricted to generalized sasakian structures , is precisely the contact volume @xmath430 .",
    "the contact volume , in turn , depends only on the reeb vector field @xmath9 .",
    "a general proof of this statement , which supersedes the proofs in @xcite , may be found in appendix [ contactappendix ] .",
    "the reeb vector field @xmath9 for which a generalized sasakian manifold is also einstein is then a critical point of the contact volume @xmath435 over the reeb vector fields of a space of generalized sasakian structures . as also shown in appendix [ contactappendix ] , @xmath430 is strictly convex , and thus such a critical point is necessarily a minimum .",
    "provided we work within a deformation class of generalized sasakian structures , implying that the space of reeb vector fields we are minimizing over is path - connected , then this minimum will be a global minimum .",
    "clearly , all these statements generalize the results of @xcite to general supersymmetric @xmath0 solutions of type iib string theory , with the only constraint being that the background has non - zero d3-brane charge .",
    "the key technical difference to the sasakian case , which is currently also a deficiency , is that we do not yet have a good understanding of the deformation space of generalized sasakian structures , and thus the corresponding space of reeb vector fields over which we are to vary @xmath436 .",
    "in the final part of this paper we shall make some reasonable assumptions about this , based on physical arguments in some particular examples , and show that the geometric result above indeed then agrees with the field theory @xmath21-maximization computation .",
    "it should be noted , however , that even in sasakian geometry there is currently no _ general _ understanding of the deformation space .",
    "in fact a global picture may not even be necessary , depending on what one wants to show .",
    "for example , one of the motivations for @xcite was to prove that the on - shell @xmath430 is an _ algebraic number _ , since this is a definite prediction of @xmath21-maximization in field theory .",
    "as pointed out in @xcite , this follows in the general case for _ quasi - regular _ reeb vector fields , which by definition generate a @xmath368 action on @xmath16 , since then the on - shell @xmath430 is a rational number , again as expected from field theory .",
    "what about irregular critical reeb vector fields ?",
    "since the reeb vector field also generates an isometry , and the isometry group of @xmath16 is necessarily compact , it follows that such a reeb vector field lies in the lie algebra @xmath437 of some torus @xmath438 of rank at least two that acts isometrically on @xmath16 .",
    "if we assume that there is at least a one - parameter family of deformations of generalized sasakian structures away from such a critical point , with reeb vector fields defining a curve in @xmath437 , then the duistermaat - heckman formula for the contact volume in @xcite implies that the critical reeb vector field @xmath439 is algebraic , and hence that @xmath440 is also algebraic , as desired . to see this ,",
    "one notes that there is then always a nearby generalized sasakian structure with reeb vector field @xmath441 that is quasi - regular , and thus one can apply the duistermaat - heckman formula to the total space of the associated complex line bundle over the orbifold @xmath442 , where @xmath441 defines the action of @xmath443 on @xmath16 .",
    "this formula is then a rational function of the reeb vector field with rational coefficients determined by certain chern classes and weights , and thus setting its derivative to zero will give polynomial equations for @xmath439 with rational coefficients .",
    "we refer to @xcite for the details .",
    "in fact the only case over which there is complete control is the case of _ toric _ sasakian structures . in this setting the original paper of @xcite provides a complete description .",
    "it is worth contrasting this situation with the corresponding case in generalized geometry .",
    "thus , as in @xcite , we define a _ toric _ generalized sasakian manifold to be a generalized sasakian manifold for which the symplectic structure on the cone is invariant under @xmath444 .",
    "we also assume that the corresponding reeb vector field lies in the lie algebra of this torus .",
    "notice that this does _ not _ imply that the whole structure is invariant under @xmath22  for example , the pilch - warner solution is a non - trivial solution with fluxes which is toric in this sense , but for which only a @xmath445 subgroup preserves the fluxes . in any case , in this setting there is a moment map @xmath446 under which the image of the cone @xmath40 is a strictly convex rational polyhedral cone @xmath447 .",
    "this is a set of the form [ polycone ] ^*&=&\\{y^*y , v_a0  , a=1, ",
    ",d}^3  , where the integer vectors @xmath448 , @xmath449 , are the inward normal vectors to the @xmath450 faces of the polyhedral cone @xmath451 .",
    "the reeb vector field @xmath9 then defines a hyperplane @xmath452 in @xmath453 that cuts @xmath451 in a compact convex two - dimensional polytope , and the contact volume is simply the euclidean volume of this polytope , as a function of @xmath9 .",
    "thus the minimization problem we are required to do involves minimizing this volume over an appropriate space of reeb vector fields @xmath9 .",
    "as explained in @xcite , necessarily @xmath9 lies in the interior of the dual polyhedral cone @xmath454 since @xmath455 , so @xmath456 is necessary .",
    "however , in the sasakian case , the condition that the holomorphic volume form @xmath19 has charge 3 then further restricts @xmath9 to lie in the intersection of @xmath457 with a hyperplane .",
    "this then leads to a well - defined volume minimization problem , with a unique ( finite ! ) critical point @xmath439 .    in the toric generalized setting ,",
    "almost everything said above remains true .",
    "thus a toric generalized sasaki - einstein solution is similarly obtained by minimizing the _ same _ two - dimensional polytope volume that appears above .",
    "the difference is that the space of reeb vector fields over which one minimizes is in general _ different_. this is related to the fact that in the generalized setting the closed pure spinor @xmath31 on the cone is required to have charge 3 under the reeb vector field , as part of our definition of generalized sasakian , so @xmath458 , or equivalently @xmath459 . since @xmath31 is in general a polyform , the minimization problem in the generalized setting is naively going to be over a small space .",
    "we shall see some examples of precisely this in section [ genconifolds ] .",
    "although the generalized geometry in these examples is not under good control , fortunately the _ physical _ interpretation is , and this allows us to determine the constraints on the reeb vector field and apply volume minimization .",
    "in fact even more simple are the @xmath32-transforms :    [ [ example - beta - transform - of - mathbbc3 - 1 ] ] example : @xmath32-transform of @xmath91 + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    in order to be very concrete , let us return to the class of generalized sasakian manifolds presented in section [ sec : example ] .",
    "recall this arises from a family of generalized khler cone structures on @xmath91 with reeb vector fields in @xmath460 .",
    "in fact these are toric , in the above sense , and here @xmath461 .",
    "we can then calculate the contact volume as a function of the reeb vector field @xmath9 : [ zfors5 ] z & = & _ y  =  .",
    "the homogeneity condition @xmath458 imposes that the components of the reeb vector field @xmath462 satisfy [ xi123=3 ] _",
    "1 + _ 2 + _ 3 & = & 3  .",
    "notice here that everything is independent of the parameter @xmath240 .",
    "we see immediately that @xmath430 is minimized for @xmath463 , at which point @xmath464",
    "so that the contact volume of the generalized sasaki - einstein manifold @xmath16 is equal to the volume of the five - sphere , @xmath465 . given the definition of the function @xmath327 , this then indeed corresponds to the einstein condition @xmath344 .",
    "we have thus reproduced the result that the beta deformation of @xmath91 does not change the supergravity central charge @xcite .",
    "of course this is physically fairly obvious , since it is a marginal deformation , but the important point is that we have reproduced this in a non - trivial way using generalized geometry .",
    "the above result presumably extends to general beta deformations of toric khler cones , which could be treated as in @xcite .",
    "as explained above , the minimization problem involves precisely the same volume function of precisely the same polytope .      as mentioned in the introduction",
    ", volume minimization is believed to correspond to @xmath21-maximization in the dual @xmath2 superconformal field theory .",
    "the equivalence of the two procedures has been _ proven _ for the case of toric sasakian manifolds in @xcite , and in a very interesting and recent paper also for non - toric sasakian manifolds as well @xcite . in this subsection",
    "we briefly review the relation , and make a more general conjecture .    in @xcite",
    "it was shown that for a general solution of type iib supergravity of the form @xmath15 , with @xmath16 a generalized sasaki - einstein manifold , the contact volume of @xmath16 is related to the central charge @xmath21 of the dual scft by the simple formula [ contactcentral ] & = &  , where @xmath466 is the central charge for @xmath5 super - yang - mills theory with gauge group @xmath467 at large @xmath468 .",
    "moreover , it was shown in @xcite that the reeb vector field corresponds to the r - symmetry of the dual @xmath2 scft .    just as the contact volume is determined by the reeb vector field ,",
    "so the central charge @xmath21 is completely determined by the r - symmetry through @xcite a & = & ( 3 r^3 - r )  .",
    "here the trace is over the fermions in the theory .",
    "more precisely , one typically computes this quantity in a uv theory that has a lagrangian description and is believed to flow to an interacting superconformal fixed point in the ir , and then uses t hooft anomaly matching . for some time a major problem was identifying the correct global symmetry in such a uv description that becomes the r - symmetry in the ir .",
    "this was solved by intriligator and wecht in the beautiful paper @xcite .",
    "the result is that , among the set of potential r - symmetries that are free of abj anomalies , the correct r - symmetry is that which ( locally ) maximizes the central charge .",
    "that is , one maximizes the trial central charge function over all admissible r - symmetries : a _ & = & ( 3 r_^3 - r _ )  .",
    "of course , this immediately resembles @xmath430-minimization , where one varies the contact volume as a function of the reeb vector field .",
    "indeed , even the condition that the superpotential has r - charge 2 is analogous to the condition that @xmath31 has scaling dimension 3 : both are immediate consequences of the supersymmetry parameters having a canonical ( non - zero ) r - charge .",
    "in general even the dimensions of the spaces of trial r - charges and trial reeb vector fields are different . however , in @xcite it was shown in the _ toric sasakian _ case that one can effectively perform the field theory @xmath21-maximization in two steps , the first step resolving the mixing with global baryonic symmetries .",
    "the upshot of this is that one obtains trial r - charges which are then functions of the reeb vector field ; that is , the field theory trial r - charges satisfy the well - established ads / cft formula @xcite [ rmatter ] r ( ) & = &  . here",
    "@xmath51 is a chiral matter field which is `` dual '' to a supersymmetric three - subspace @xmath469 , and the volumes are understood in our language as contact volumes , which are thus functions of the trial reeb vector field .",
    "more geometrically , in the abelian mesonic moduli space @xmath470 defines a conical divisor in @xmath40 , which is then a cone over @xmath471 .",
    "it is a non - trivial and striking fact that the trial r - charges _ defined _ this way satisfy the field theory anomaly cancellation conditions , for _ any _ choice of trial reeb vector field .",
    "the authors of @xcite then proved that [ zatrial ] z & = &  , holds as a relation between _ functions _ , with the right hand side understood as a function also of the reeb vector field , as described above .",
    "it is then natural to conjecture that the relation still holds when @xmath16 is generalized sasakian but not necessarily einstein . of course",
    ", in general there would also be some analogue of the baryonic mixing to resolve in the dual field theory .",
    "however , in the examples we shall study in the next section there is no such mixing as there are no baryonic symmetries , and the functions will agree on the nose .",
    "we also note that , although the abelian mesonic moduli space in the field theory is only a subspace of @xmath40 in general , namely the type - change locus of @xmath31 , it is nevertheless still true in examples that one can match chiral matter fields @xmath51 with supersymmetric three - subspaces @xmath471 , and that ( [ rmatter ] ) still holds .",
    "this was demonstrated for the explicit pilch - warner solution in @xcite , and we shall see it is also true of the new examples in the next section .",
    "in this section we present new examples of superconformal field theories whose dual geometries are generalized sasaki - einstein .",
    "they are obtained by massive deformations of quiver gauge theories describing the worldvolume theories of a stack of d3-branes located at so - called `` generalized conifold '' singularities .",
    "the simplest such example is the suspended pinch point ( spp ) singularity , but this generalizes to an infinite family of generalized conifolds which are cones over the @xmath472 sasaki - einstein orbifolds .",
    "the mass deformation induces an rg flow , and the field theory analysis suggests that these theories flow to interacting superconformal fixed points in the ir",
    ". the mesonic moduli spaces of the corresponding scfts are not ( @xmath468 symmetrized copies of ) the original calabi - yau singularities , but rather only a subspace . given the identification @xcite between the abelian mesonic moduli space and the type - change locus @xmath473 of @xmath31 in @xmath40 , where the geometry reduces to being khler",
    ", this means that the dual supergravity solution is indeed necessarily generalized sasaki - einstein .",
    "notice that these theories _ must _ have a dual @xmath0 type iib description , since they have been obtained by deformation of a sasaki - einstein background of type iib .",
    "although we do not know the explicit supergravity solutions , we will show that with some reasonable assumptions about their geometry , we have enough information to perform the generalized @xmath430-minimization described in the previous section , and hence compute _ geometrically _ the central charge of the dual scft and the r - charges of certain three - subspaces .",
    "we then show that these agree with the dual field theory @xmath21-maximization computations , and moreover that the quantities even agree off - shell , as in ( [ zatrial ] ) .      before considering mass deformations of generalized conifolds , we start by looking at a simple well - known example in order to acquire some geometric intuition .",
    "one way to deform @xmath5 super - yang - mills theory is by giving a mass to one of its three chiral superfields @xmath474 , @xmath475 , in @xmath2 language , which are all in the adjoint representation of @xmath467 .",
    "the corresponding superpotential deformation is thus w_m & = & _ 1 [ _ 2,_3 ] + _ 1 ^ 2  .",

    "this structure is essentially inherited from that of the original solution before mass deformation , which is @xmath91 with its flat calabi - yau metric .",
    "the complex coordinates @xmath486 , @xmath475 , effectively get rescaled ( as the r - symmetry changes ) , and in polar coordinates these have weights @xmath487 and are given by    lll & z_1  =  r^_1 ^_1  , & _ 1  =  3/2  , + & z_2  =  r^_2 ^_2  , & _ 2  =  3/4  ,   + & z_3  =  r^_3 ^_3  , & _ 3  =  3/4  .",

    "following on from @xcite , we have studied a pair of compatible pure spinors on a generalized calabi - yau cone , which generalizes the notion of a khler cone with zero first chern class .",
    "the key point is that the complex structure on the cone is replaced by a generalized complex structure , which becomes an ordinary complex structure on a special type - change locus .",
    "physically , this locus is the abelian mesonic moduli space of the dual field theory . in section [ gensas ]",
    "we have introduced the notion of generalized sasakian geometry , which shares many properties with sasakian geometry . in particular , there is an underlying contact structure , and the associated reeb vector field , dual to the r - symmetry , is generalized holomorphic , generalized killing , and related to @xmath98 via the integrable generalized complex structure @xmath37 .",
    "away from the type - change locus , the transverse space to the reeb foliation , rather than being khler as in the sasakian case , is endowed with a triple of orthogonal symplectic forms satisfying a system of differential equations .",
    "equipped with this definition of generalized sasakian geometry , we then proved in section [ genvolume ] the analogous result to @xcite : the action for the bosonic supergravity fields is equal , when restricted to a space of generalized sasakian structures , to the underlying contact volume , and thus depends only on the reeb vector field .",
    "this implies that the reeb vector field of a supersymmetric @xmath0 solution is obtained by minimizing the contact volume over a space of the reeb vector fields under which the pure spinor @xmath31 has charge three . since at the critical point",
    "this contact volume is equal to the inverse central charge of the dual field theory @xcite , this is conjecturally the geometric counterpart of @xmath21-maximization in four - dimensional @xmath570 superconformal field theories .",
    "a number of important questions and problems arise from this work .",
    "firstly , our current understanding of the deformation space of generalized sasakian structures is very limited .",
    "this is simply because this is a new structure , which we have only had chance to develop quite superficially in the course of a single paper ; on the other hand , sasakian geometry has been studied since 1960 .",
    "having said that , there is still no general understanding of the deformation space even for sasakian manifolds , the only complete description being that for toric sasakian manifolds given in @xcite .",
    "we believe that a similar level of understanding should be achievable for generalized toric sasakian manifolds , but leave this for future work .",
    "notice that , in any case , our definition of generalized sasakian geometry reduces to that of sasakian geometry when the generalized complex structure is complex , and that the beta deformation of a khler cone is a cone over a generalized sasakian manifold .",
    "secondly , we have not investigated the type - change locus @xmath30 in any detail here .",
    "it is an important problem to understand what the constraints are on the type - change locus , and to classify the types of boundary conditions associated with the structures introduced in section [ gensas ] .",
    "we note that this is very much an open problem in generalized geometry , for which there are currently only some very preliminary results @xcite .",
    "in section [ genconifolds ] we bypassed most of the above open issues by focusing on some examples for which we have a fairly good understanding of the physics on the scft side of the correspondence .",
    "this allowed us to predict the existence of supersymmetric @xmath0 solutions of type iib supergravity , with the same topology and toric symplectic structure as the cones @xmath34 .",
    "although we do not know the pure spinor @xmath31 , we made some reasonable assumptions about the generalized geometry based on the dual field theories and on the pilch - warner solution that these solutions generalize , and thereby determined the type - change locus to be @xmath571 .",
    "we were then able to compute the critical reeb vector field and hence the contact volumes . using the formulae in @xcite",
    ", we found perfect agreement with the central charges and r - charges of chiral primary fields computed via @xmath21-maximization in the dual scfts obtained by mass deformation .",
    "perhaps the main issue raised here is why the toric symplectic structure is preserved after the renormalization group flow triggered by the mass deformation .",
    "in fact , the field theory interpretation of the contact or symplectic structure , which exists whenever the solution has non - zero d3-brane charge , is still unclear .",
    "we hope to return to many of these issues in future work .",
    "we thank jerome gauntlett , dario martelli and daniel waldram for discussions at an early stage of this project , and davide cassani and luca martucci for electronic communications .",
    "m.  g.   is supported by the berrow foundation and the swiss national fund , and j.  f.  s.  by a royal society university research fellowship .",
    "in section [ sugraaction ] we derived the equations of motion on @xmath16 for the bosonic fields of type iib supergravity from ten - dimensional equations , and then constructed an action @xmath430 whose variation led to those equations . an alternative strategy to obtain @xmath430",
    "would have been to dimensionally reduce the type iib action on @xmath100 , where the `` reduction '' is along the @xmath0 direction . however , this approach is complicated by ambiguities associated with the self - duality of @xmath110 , and to the lack of proper normalization of the chern - simons term @xcite . in this appendix",
    "we outline the relation between these two approaches .    even though the field equations of type iib supergravity can not be derived directly from the variation of an action , one can have recourse to a pseudo - action that leads to equations of motion that match the type iib equations only when supplemented by the self - duality condition @xmath572 . with @xmath573 ,",
    "this pseudo - action reads @xcite s_^10 & = & ^10 x ( r _ -2|p|^2 - 12 |g|^2 -|f_5|^2 )   + & & - c_4 h c_2  . after a weyl rescaling @xmath574",

    "one finds [ siibred ] s_^10 & = &  .",
    "note that the prefactor @xmath575 here is infinite .",
    "pragmatically , one can simply discard this prefactor in order to obtain an action for the bosonic fields on @xmath16 , although in a more systematic treatment this should be regularized holographically following henningson and skenderis @xcite .",
    "the term @xmath576 should be understood only symbolically , since the diabolic self - duality property makes it vanish .",
    "naively , one might be tempted to formally set @xmath577 . comparing with the action @xmath430 in",
    ", we conclude that instead a factor of @xmath578 is missing in front of the second line of .",
    "a similar factor was already pointed out by belov and moore @xcite .",
    "is this appendix we consider the contact volume _ ( y ) & & _ y  =  _ y  =  _ y _  . as a functional on an appropriate space of contact structures on a fixed five - manifold @xmath16 .",
    "thus here @xmath11 is a contact one - form on @xmath16 .",
    "we begin by showing that this volume depends only on the unique reeb vector field @xmath9 that is associated with @xmath11 . as we explain , this is analogous to the statement in symplectic geometry that the symplectic volume depends only on the cohomology class of the symplectic form .",
    "we then compute the first and second derivatives of the contact volume .",
    "in particular , provided one considers only deformations of the reeb vector field that preserve @xmath11 , then the volume functional is _ strictly convex_. these results generalize those of @xcite , @xcite for sasakian manifolds to general contact manifolds .",
    "of course , the results that follow hold in arbitrary odd dimension , with appropriate replacements of dimension - dependent constants .",
    "consider a fixed contact one - form @xmath11 on @xmath16 , and a one - parameter family of deformations @xmath579 , with @xmath580 and @xmath581 .",
    "we taylor - expand @xmath582 , with a similar expansion of the reeb vector field @xmath583 .",
    "since by definition @xmath584 , @xmath585 , one immediately deduces the first order equations [ defeqns ]  ( ) & = & -( )  , ",

    "we now compute [ firstder ] _ y _ _ t - _ y _ & = & + ( t^2 ) + & = & _ y ()^2 + ( t^2 ) + & = & - _ y (  ) ( ) ^2 + ( t^2 )  , where in going from the first to the second line we have integrated the second term by parts and used stokes theorem , and in going from the second to the third line we have used the first equation in ( [ defeqns ] ) .",
    "in particular , if we consider deformations of the contact structure that leave fixed the reeb vector field , then by definition @xmath586 and the contact volume is invariant",
    ". thus we may regard the contact volume as a functional of @xmath9 , as opposed to @xmath11 , and we have then shown that the first derivative of the contact volume is [  ] = - 3_y (  ) _  .",
    "of course , this result reproduces that in @xcite , but here we have used only contact geometry . in the special case in which @xmath9 generates a @xmath368 action on @xmath16 , the quotient @xmath587 is a symplectic orbifold and the contact volume is ( proportional to ) the symplectic volume of @xmath587 .",
    "deformations of the contact structure that leave @xmath9 invariant are then deformations of the symplectic structure on @xmath587 that leave the cohomology class fixed , which thus preserve the volume .",
    "more generally , such deformations leave fixed the _",
    "basic _ cohomology class of the symplectic structure on the leaf space of the reeb foliation .",

    "<S> we begin by defining a notion of `` generalized sasakian geometry , '' which consists of a contact structure together with a differential system for three symplectic forms on the four - dimensional transverse space to the reeb vector field . a generalized sasakian manifold which satisfies an additional `` einstein '' condition </S>",
    "<S> provides a general supersymmetric @xmath0 solution of type iib supergravity with fluxes . </S>",
    "<S> we then show that the supergravity action restricted to a space of generalized sasakian structures is simply the contact volume , and that its minimization determines the reeb vector field for such a solution . </S>",
    "<S> we conjecture that this contact volume is equal to the inverse of the trial central charge whose maximization determines the r - symmetry of any four - dimensional @xmath2 superconformal field theory . </S>",
    "<S> this variational procedure allows us to compute the contact volumes for a predicted infinite family of solutions , and we find perfect agreement with the central charges and r - charges of bps operators in the dual mass - deformed generalized conifold theories .    </S>",
