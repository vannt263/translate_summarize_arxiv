    "the germanium detector array ( gerda )  @xcite is an experiment at the laboratori nazionali del gran sasso ( lngs ) of infn searching for the neutrinoless double beta ( @xmath0 ) decay of @xmath1ge .",
    "it uses high - purity germanium ( hpge ) detectors that are enriched in @xmath1ge to ( 86 - 88)% as sources and as detection media .",
    "the detectors are mounted in low - mass holders and are embedded in liquid argon ( lar ) , which serves as a cryogenic coolant and absorber against external radiation . a tank filled with ultrapure water",
    "provides a 3 m thick water buffer around the cryostat and serves as an additional absorber and as a cherenkov muon veto .",
    "the experimental signature of @xmath0  decay is a peak in the spectrum of the summed energies of the two electrons released in the nuclear process .",
    "the peak should arise at the @xmath2  value which in the case of @xmath1ge is at ( 2039.061@xmath30.007)kev  @xcite .",
    "the expected number of signal events @xmath4 is given by : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the half life of the @xmath0  decay , @xmath7 the live time of the measurement , @xmath8 the avogadro constant , @xmath9 the molar mass of the enriched material and @xmath10 the total detector mass .",
    "the parameters @xmath11 and @xmath12 correspond to the fraction of the detector volume that is active , and to the @xmath1ge isotopic fraction , respectively .",
    "the efficiency @xmath13 corresponds to the fraction of events that deposit their entire energy at @xmath2  inside the active volume without bremsstrahlung loss .",
    "finally , @xmath14 represents the efficiency of the signal acceptance by pulse shape discrimination ( psd ) .",
    "the number of background events @xmath15 in the region of interest ( roi ) around @xmath2  scales in a first approximation with the detector mass .",
    "it can be expressed as follows : @xmath16 @xmath17 is the background index for the roi around @xmath2  in units of cts/(kev@xmath18kg@xmath18yr )  and @xmath19 is the width of the search window which depends on the energy resolution at @xmath2 .    if the experiment can be carried out background - free , the sensitivity on the half life scales with @xmath20 . in case of a sizable background contribution ( @xmath21 ) , its statistical fluctuation can be assumed to be gaussian and the sensitivity would scale approximately with @xmath22 .",
    "gerda  has been conceived to proceed in different phases in order to fulfill a quasi background - free condition in each of them .",
    "a sensitivity scaling almost linearly with the exposure of the experiment is aimed for .    in phase",
    "i semi - coaxial ge detectors from the heidelberg - moscow ( hdm )  @xcite experiment and the international germanium experiment ( igex )  @xcite were deployed after their refurbishment .",

    "it has been pointed out , that the mean value @xmath23 of the gaussian components describing the @xmath24 distributions was affected by two time variations .",
    "firstly , an exponentially decreasing @xmath23 with a time period of @xmath251 month was observed .",

    "these instabilities were quantified and time - corrections were applied to the @xmath24 distributions of calibration and physics data .",
    "the origin of the dynamic processes is still under investigation .",
    "the observed dynamic @xmath24 drift might originate from charges present on the passivated groove , which neutralize or dissolve into the lar over several months of operation .",
    "the width @xmath27 of the @xmath24 distributions obtained from all calibration data turned out to be @xmath281.5% for the four bege detectors .",
    "this was sufficient for phase  i , however , a value @xmath291% is aimed for phase  ii . it was demonstrated that a @xmath27 of 1% can be achieved with beges in lar ( section  [ sec : bege_gdl - tests ] ) .",

    "14 events with @xmath24@xmath461 show strong pairwise time correlations . since each pair or triple occurs in the same detector with a very similar @xmath24 , it is suggestive that consecutive decays in @xmath43 chains were observed which has caused some of the spikes in fig .",

    "a small fraction might also be due to @xmath35k @xmath37-surface events . moreover , one candidate populating the sse band has a sse like pulse shape , while three other events with @xmath24 @xmath470.965 are identified in one case as a mse and in two cases as surface background events with long rise times . despite these few contaminating events from non - alpha sources , fig .",
    "[ fig : bege_alpha - contamination ] clearly demonstrates that surface @xmath43 events are efficiently rejected by the a / e cut .",
    "as discussed in sections  [ sec : vacuum_psa ] and  [ sec : bege - gerda_psa ] , the observed pulse shape degradation can be caused by charge carriers present or collected over time on the surface of the passivation layer between the anode and cathode of the diodes .",
    "to examine if the effect is related to environmental conditions and can be improved for the operation in lar , the detectors gd32a and gd35a were tested in the gerda  detector laboratory ( gdl )  @xcite at lngs .",
    "both detectors were deployed in the same lar test cryostat that has already been used for a long - term test with a prototype depleted bege detector which was not passivated  @xcite .",
    "the two enriched bege detectors were operated in the standard configuration used in gerda ; i.e. , bare detectors in lar without passivation on the groove surface . according to ref .",
    "@xcite this is necessary in order to guarantee stable operation in lar and a negligible increase of the leakage current .",
    "the gdl lar tests of the two detectors revealed a slightly increased energy resolution compared to the vacuum tests : in the case of detector gd32a it increased from 2.5 to 2.8kev at 2615kev , while in the case of gd35a it deteriorated from 2.4 to 3.0kev .",
    "this was expected , since the distance of the first amplifying signal stage to the read - out electrodes was @xmath2560 cm in lar and thus larger than in the vacuum setup .",
    "the widths @xmath27 of the @xmath24 distributions of the two detectors gd32a and gd35a improved from 1.3 and 2.4% to 1.1 and 1.0% , respectively .",
    "the residual @xmath24 resolution was dominated by the noise of the gdl test set - up , and was similar to past measurements with prototype bege detectors .",

    "[ fig : gd35a_w - wo - pl ] .",

    "the psd survival efficiencies of @xmath30-peaks and compton - continua in @xmath26th source spectra were determined for detector gd32a : the sep , fep and compton events at @xmath2  survive at 8.2 , 11.5 and 38% , respectively .",
    "it should also be noted that for contaminants such as events from the detector n+ surface an improvement in @xmath24 resolution would have a greater effect on reducing the survival efficiency than for mse dominated background contaminants such as @xmath26th .",
    "this paper presents a detailed review of the production chain of the new gerda  phase  ii broad energy germanium detectors . it discusses the performance of the first seven delivered detectors which were operated in vacuum and in liquid argon .",
    "the detector production included an efficient isotopic enrichment of @xmath1ge from @xmath258% in natural germanium to @xmath2588% , a successful purification and crystal growth .",
    "30 crystal slices were obtained and converted into operational diodes .",
    "only one diode did not fulfill all required performance specifications by showing charge collection deficiencies in the av . in total , the 30 detectors have a mass of 20.0 kg which corresponds to a mass yield of 53% .",
    "the obtained impurity concentrations allowed for an operation of the detectors at relatively low voltages of ( 3 - 4)kv . during all production steps , the activation of the enriched germanium by cosmic radiation was kept at a minimum in order to meet the background specifications of gerda  phase  ii .",
    "this was pursued by storing the germanium in underground sites near to the manufacturers and by using a shielded container for transportation . according to the tracked exposure histories and the predicted production rates of cosmogenic isotopes , the production of detectors underground  potentially needed in a future upgrade of the experiment for further background reduction  @xcite  was not necessary at this stage .",
    "finally , more than 25% of the original germanium material was recovered for future crystal growth .    in order to characterize the detectors , an underground facility with the capability of screening two detectors per week",
    "was installed . for the tests",
    "the detectors were mounted in standard vacuum cryostats . as demonstrated by means of the first seven detectors",
    ", they all turned out to have excellent energy resolutions of 0.13% in terms of full widths at half maximum of the 1333kev @xmath34co @xmath30-line .",
    "this is an improvement of @xmath2530% compared to the gerda  detectors based on a semi - coaxial design .",
    "the active volume fraction was measured with a precision of a few percent .",
    "the pulse shape discrimination power was quantified . a previously unknown anomaly originating probably from surface charges deposited in the groove around the read - out electrode",
    "was identified . as a consequence ,",
    "the psd performance notably deteriorated for some detectors .",
    "nonetheless , possibilities for improvement were found  either by chemical and thermal treatment of the passivation layer , or by removing the passivation entirely and handling the detector under clean nitrogen atmosphere .",
    "five out of the seven enriched bege detectors were deployed in the lar cryostat of gerda  during phase  i of the experiment .",
    "it was the first time that this detector type was used in a @xmath0  decay experiment .",
    "all but one were operated over almost 320d .",
    "the leakage current and the energy scale were stable , while the energy resolution was @xmath2530% worse compared to their operation in vacuum .",
    "this was expected due to an increased distance of the first signal amplifying stages from the detectors .",
    "the pulse shape behavior experienced drifts in time which , however , could be corrected offline .",
    "a similar , but dynamic mechanism as observed in vacuum could be the reason for the effect .",
    "an appropriate modification of the passivation layer of the detectors is expected to keep leakage currents low and to cure the observed pulse shape degradations in lar for gerda  phase  ii .",
    "beta - decays of the @xmath35ar daughter nuclide @xmath35k , and gamma - rays induced by @xmath32bi and @xmath26th decays were found to be the major contaminants affecting the background region at @xmath2  for the bege detectors in gerda .",
    "the contribution from surface @xmath43-events was of secondary order in the range of 5% . moreover , the spectral fit of gerda  phase  i data confirmed agreement between the predicted and the fit - constrained contribution from cosmogenic isotope decays .",
    "signals induced by most types of backgrounds can be efficiently removed by psd cuts .",
    "further background rejection will be possible by combining psd with a veto by anti - coincidences between detectors or by scintillation light in lar induced by contaminants .",
    "in addition , a transparent nylon cylinder around the detectors to stop mechanically the attracted @xmath35k ions is in preparation .",
    "gerda  phase  ii is expected to reduce its background by one order of magnitude compared to phase  i. the resulting background index of 10@xmath48cts/(kev@xmath18kg@xmath18yr )  in the region of interest , the new additional detector mass and the improved energy resolution will allow for the exploration of half life values above 10@xmath49yr for the @xmath0  decay of @xmath1ge after a few years of data collection .",
