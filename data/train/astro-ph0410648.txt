    "it is almost a hundred years since ludendorff discovered the absence of balmer lines in the spectrum of the f type irregular variable rcrb , the first recognised hydrogen deficient star .",
    "about 35 years later , the first helium star was discovered by popper .",
    "the basic problem about the origins of these stars , namely , a single ( or double ) star of intermediate mass becoming a high luminosity hydrogen deficient star , still remains a mystery . presently , there are two principal hypotheses to account for their origins .",
    "the prime contender is the white dwarf merger scenario ( or double degenerate , dd ) in which a helium white dwarf secondary is accreted onto a co ( or he ) white dwarf primary resulting in the ignition of a helium shell in the accreted envelope .",
    "the energy generated forces the star to expand to cool supergiant dimensions .",
    "the life time at this stage depends on the supply of helium in the shell and the mass of the envelope .",
    "the subsequent evolution would be like a canonical post - agb contraction to the white dwarf track ( webbink 1984 , iben & tutukov 1984 , saio & jeffery 2000 ) .",
    "the second scenario proposed is called the late thermal pulse ( or final flash , ff ) , in which an agb star in its final stages retains a helium shell of enough mass as to get ignited for a last time after it descends on to the white dwarf track .",
    "the final thermal pulse forces the star to become a cool supergiant for a second time .",
    "the subsequent evolution would again resemble the canonical post - agb evolution of single stars ( iben et al .",
    "presently , there are no decisive observational tests predicted to choose either one ( or any other alternative ) of the scenarios .",
    "several groups of hydrogen deficient stars have now been identified ranging from high luminosity ( low surface gravity ) cooler hdc stars , rcbs , ehes to low luminosity ( high gravity ) hot pg1159 stars ( see jeffery 1996 for a display of various groups in the log @xmath4 , log @xmath5 plane ) .",
    "it is not clear how these various groups of hydrogen deficient stars are related to each other @xmath3 e.g. , ehes and rcbs .",
    "do they represent sucessive stages in evolution ?",
    "even some groups are further subdivided and show diversity in properties e.g. , majority and minority rcbs which show [ s / fe ] , [ si / fe ] values of about 0.5 and much higher , respectively ( lambert & rao 1994 , asplund et al . 2000 ) .",
    "do they suggest different paths of evolution ? in the last few years , stars like sakurai s object and fgsge provided us examples of stellar evolution in real time by turning from a normal star to hydrogen deficient born - again giant ( asplund et al .",
    "1997 , gonzalez et al .",
    "1998 , duerbec et al . 2002 ) . how are these born - again giants related to rcbs are some of the intriguing questions that the theory of intermediate mass star evolution is unable to provide . in keeping with the theme of the conference,`abundances as records of stellar evolution and nucleo- synthesis '",
    ", i would like to explore in this presentation the interrelationships of rcbs and ehes and also address some of the issues raised above by seeking clues from surface chemical compositions .",
    "r coronae borealis ( rcb ) stars are carbon - rich , hydrogen - poor f - g supergiants that exhibit light fades of several magnitudes at irregular intervals due to circumstellar dust formation .",
    "they range in @xmath5 from 8000 to 4000 k. after keenan & barnbaum s ( 1997 ) spectroscopic investigation even the cool so - called dyper stars also seem to belong to this class , extending the @xmath5 to 3500 k. the effective gravities range from log @xmath4 = 0.5 to 1.5 .",
    "the rcb population in the lmc provides the estimates of absolute magnitudes which range from @xmath6 @xmath32.5 to @xmath35 and corresponding luminosities log ( l/@xmath7 ) of 4.0 @xmath3 3.2 ( alcock et al .",
    "presently known members in the galaxy amount to about 35 including the 3 hot rcbs , about 21 are known in the lmc ( including dy per stars ) and a lone one in the smc ( alcock et al .",
    "2001 , morgan et al .",
    "the distribution of the number of rcbs with respect to spectral type suggests a peak around f - g for galactic ones whereas the lmc population shows a peak at much cooler temperatures . by scaling the lmc population of rcbs to the galaxy , alcock et al .",
    "estimate more than 3200 to be present in the galaxy most of them being cooler members .",
    "any evolutionary schemes that are proposed to explain the origins should also be able to account for these numbers .",
    "the two evolutionary schemes that have been proposed ( dd and ff ) can account only partially for the estimated number of rcbs present in the galaxy ( iben , tutukov , yungelson 1996 ) .",
    "extreme helium stars are mostly carbon rich , hydrogen poor a - b supergiants .",
    "some of them show short period pulsations with a period of a few days .",
    "they range in @xmath5 from 32000 to 9000 k with log @xmath4 of 0.7 to 4.0 .",
    "the luminosities , log l/@xmath7 , are estimated to be about 4.4 to 3.0 ( saio & jeffery 2000 ) .",
    "presently there are about 21 known members in the galaxy and none in either lmc or smc .",
    "the galactic distribution of both groups ( rcb and ehe ) suggests a bulge population ( jeffery et al .",
    "1987 ) and might belong to the thick disk , although there are suggestions that a few of them might even be part of the halo ( eg .",
    "u aqr - cottrell & lawson 1998 ) .",
    "the first major study of the surface abundances of a larger number of rcbs by lambert & rao ( 1994 ) revealed that majority of the stars analysed ( 14 out of 18 ) showed similar patterns ; particularly [ si / fe ] and [ s / fe ] ] notation refers to log @xmath8(i)@xmath9 @xmath3 log @xmath8(i)@xmath10 are around 0.5 and a mild fe deficiency relative to solar .",
    "the minority rcbs are marked by approximately solar si and s abundances and a severe fe deficiency ( or a very high [ si / fe ] , [ s / fe ] ) .",
    "a similar classification by fe abundance was also suggested for ehe stars ( heber 1986 ) .",
    "before discussing the surface abundances it is appropriate to recall some of the uncertainities involved in arriving at these estimates . most of the analyses are based on the line - blanketed , lte atmospheric models computed at uppsala by asplund et al .",
    "( 1997 ) for rcb stars of @xmath5 8000 to 6000 k and at armagh by jeffery & heber ( 1992 ) , jeffery , woolf , pollacco ( 2001 ) for ehes with @xmath5 @xmath11 9000 k. the continuous opacity in the atmospheres of rcbs is controlled by the photoionization of ci from excited levels and the gas pressure is provided by helium . in estimating the mass fraction of elements ,",
    "a crucial parameter needed for rcbs is the c / he ratio ( the number density of carbon to helium ) , which can not be estimated from the spectrum directly ( rao & lambert 1996 , asplund et al .",
    "this ratio in ehes , which can be directly estimated from the analysis of spectral lines ( jeffrey 1996 , pandey et al .",
    "2001 ) has a mean value of 1% .",
    "it has been assumed in the analyses of rcbs that the same c / he of 1% holds .",
    "this value of c / he seems to be consistent with the metallicity expected from galactic distribution ( rao & lambert 1996 , pandey et al .",
    "one of the surprising outcomes of the atmospheric analysis of rcbs is the so called ` carbon problem ' , as discussed in detail by asplund et al .",
    "( 2000)(first noticed by david lambert ) .",
    "the carbon abundance estimated from the observed ci lines is four times less than the input carbon abundance for c / he , with less input the c / he ratio is very very small .",
    "recently , based on the analysis of [ ci ] lines 9850  and 8727 , pandey et al .",
    "( 2004b ) suggest that a chromosphere like temperature rise in the atmosphere might be able to account for the carbon problem .",
    "however it was realised by asplund et al .",
    "( 2000 ) that the abundance ratios are largely unaffected by the carbon problem ( and the assumed c / he values ) .",
    "an @xmath12 of @xmath35 has been assumed for all rcbs in arriving at the appropriate @xmath5 and log @xmath4 , although it is known that lmc rcbs show a range of values . as discussed by pandey et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , the element which represents the initial metallicity of the stars is not clear , whether it is fe or si , s. a metallicity parameter m has been defined by pandey et al . based on the si , s abundances that represents initial fe abundance . the observed fe abundance might be affected by things other than the intial metallicity of the star .",
    "this property might even apply to hot rcb stars like dy cen as well .",
    "the extreme fe deficiency is suggested to be a result of the accretion of winnowed gas from dust ( jeffery & heber 1993 ) .",
    "the surface abundances of rcbs and ehes have been estimated by asplund et al .",

    "( 2004a ) . both rcbs and ehes show the majority , minority division proposed by lambert & rao ( 1994 ) .",
    "mainly they are differentiated by fe abundance .",
    "the majority cluster around [ fe ] of @xmath31 and the minority show a larger deficiency about @xmath31.7 or more .",
    "since a c / he of 1% is assumed for all stars ( except the minority rcb star v854cen for which a value of 10% is suggested -asplund et al .",
    "1998 ) , the absolute numbers can be compared .",

    "the minority stars ( both groups and dycen ) have n abundances less than that expected from full convertion of c to n. although the n abundance in many rcbs and in some ehes imply wholesale conversion of o to n via on cycles , many stars are not o deficient suggesting o is synthesized along with c , i.e. , 3@xmath21 -process was followed by @xmath1c@xmath22o . most of the o - rich stars have an observed o / c about 1 implying equal production of c and o.      dramatic enhancement of light @xmath0-process elements sr , y , and zr was first seen in cool rcb star uaqr ( bond et al .",

    "the similarity in the abundance patterns of majority rcbs and majority ehes including the @xmath0-process elements and the presence of enhanced abundances of ne and mg in ehes does suggest that ehe phase might be later in evolution to that of rcbs .",

    "minority ehes and rcbs show a very similar abundance pattern , except for si , sc , and ca , ( elements that could be tied up in dust ) .",
    "rcbs have ir excesses and dust production episodes .",
    "the discovery of low @xmath1c/@xmath2c ratio ( 4 @xmath3 10 ) in the minority rcb , vcra does provide long awaited evidence for the mixing of surface protons to the intershell region and subsequent production of neutrons by @xmath2c@xmath28o , similar to sakurai s object .",

    "we need to make sure that the abundance peculiarities are real and not the result of the physical phenomena of gravitational settling and radiative levitation such as seen on the blue hb of globular clusters .",
    "k.rao : these stars are supergiants with low effective gravities , with rotation , and appreciable microturbulance . as such it is unlikely to expect gravitational settling to operate .",
