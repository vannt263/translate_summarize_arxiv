    "measuring chemical properties of galaxies and their redshift evolution is a crucial step in understanding galaxy evolution since the metallicity of galaxies is closely related to the history of star - formation , gas inflow , and outflow .",
    "a number of observational studies have been devoted to measure the metallicity of galaxies , revealing metallicity correlations with various galaxy properties . in the local universe",
    ", it has been shown that metallicity scales with galaxy luminosity and mass ( the luminosity - metallicity relation and mass - metallicity relation , respectively ) based on the metallicity measured from gas emission lines or stellar absorption lines ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these scaling relations indicate that metal enrichment is closely connected to the galaxy mass assembly .",
    "recently the redshift evolution of these scaling relations in star - forming galaxies has been extensively investigated . at @xmath2 ,",
    "many studies have suggested apparent metallicity evolution as a function of redshift . the evolution is significant especially for low stellar - mass galaxies ( e.q .",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , though it could be due to observational selection effects ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . at @xmath3 ,",
    "exploring the metallicity of galaxies is extremely challenging , because typical galaxies at such high redshifts are very faint and the classical metallicity indicators in the rest - frame optical spectra shift out of the atmospheric windows ( but see also , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    to extend the metallicity measurement toward higher redshifts , one possible approach is to focus on active galactic nuclei ( agns ) .",
    "thanks to their high luminosity ( @xmath4 ) and a various metallic emission lines in their rest - frame ultraviolet spectra , it is possible to infer the metallicity of broad - line regions ( blrs ) even for qsos at @xmath5 with ground - based telescopes ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "previously a positive relation between the metallicity of blrs ( @xmath6 ) and the redshift of agns has been reported ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; however it turned out that the apparent relation was caused by a selection bias and that the correlation between agn luminosity and blr metallicity ( the @xmath7 relation ) was fundamental ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "note that the luminosity - metallicity relation of agns has been also reported based on the emission lines in the narrow - line region ( nlr ) , which is much more extended than blr and traces the chemical properties in the spatial scale of agn host galaxies @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the luminosity - metallicity relation of high - luminosity qsos shows no strong redshift evolution in the redshift range of @xmath8 @xcite , implying that the chemical evolution at the center of host galaxies is mostly completed at a very high redshift ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "although the observed @xmath7 relation in agns and its redshift dependence are crucial to constrain evolutionary scenarios of the supermassive black hole ( bh ) , the host galaxy , and the interplay between these two ( i.e. , the galaxy - bh coevolution ) , there are two main drawbacks that should be resolved .",
    "first , while the @xmath7 relation is well established , its origin is still controversial .",
    "for example , @xcite reported that the metallicity of blr showed a correlation with the mass of bh ( @xmath9 ) , but no correlation with the eddington ratio ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "their result was recently confirmed by a larger sample of qsos @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite claimed that the observed @xmath7 relation was caused by the dependence of @xmath6 on the eddington ratio , not on @xmath9  . at lower redshifts , it has been reported that narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxies ( nls1s , whose eddington ratios are believed to be high ; see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) show higher metallicity than typical broad - line agns .",
    "the higher metallicity of nls1s in these studies is qualitatively consistent with the result reported by @xcite .",
    "the other drawback comes from observational limitations .",
    "the agn metallicity based on both blrs and nlrs has been examined predominantly for agns at @xmath11 , since the agn metallicity studies generally utilizes emission lines in the rest - frame ultraviolet spectra .",
    "consequently , the observational studies with ground - based telescopes are limited to agns at @xmath11 .",
    "this prevents us from studying the difference in the chemical properties of blrs between high-@xmath0 and low-@xmath0 qsos .",
    "for instance , @xcite studied the @xmath7 relation of qsos at @xmath12 .",
    "the possible physical origin of this @xmath13 relation has been examined by @xcite for @xmath14 , and by @xcite for @xmath15 .",
    "although @xcite investigate this issue for agns in a wide redshift range of @xmath16 , they did not examine the redshift dependence of blr chemical properties .",
    "although there are a few attempts to infer the nlr metallicity based on the rest - frame optical spectra , those methods are in turn difficult to apply for high-@xmath0 agns since infrared spectroscopy is required to obtain rest - frame optical emission lines , thus inconvenient for the comparative study between high and low redshifts . using space observations with the @xmath17 and the @xmath18 , @xcite investigated uv spectra of low-@xmath0 agns and showed that a significant @xmath7 relation was present also in low-@xmath0 agns",
    ". however , they did not examine the physical origin of the @xmath13 relation and thus it is not clear whether bh mass or the accretion rate derives the observed @xmath7 relation , and whether the low-@xmath0 and high-@xmath0 agns show the same correlations .",
    "motivated by these considerations , in this paper we investigate the correlation between blr metallicity with various agn properties , including mass , luminosity , and eddington ratio , for a sample of 70 low-@xmath0 palomar - green ( pg ) qso at @xmath1 , by utilizing the archival uv spectra .",
    "we describe the sample selection and the data in  2 , the data analysis and the fitting procedure in  3 .",
    "the main results are presented in  4 , followed by discussion in  5 and summary and conclusions in  6 .",
    "we adopt a cosmology of @xmath19 km s@xmath20 mpc@xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "to investigate metallicity of high-@xmath0 qsos , both permitted and weak semi - forbidden lines have been used .",
    "the weak semi - forbidden emission lines in the rest - frame uv spectra , i.e. , n  iv]@xmath231486 , o  iii]@xmath231663 , and n  iii]@xmath231749 are good metallicity indicators ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , since the flux ratio among these lines do not show strong dependences on physical properties of gas clouds ( such as the density and ionization parameter ) . however , the actual application to observational data is generally difficult since those semi - forbidden emission lines are too faint to be measured accurately .",
    "thus , stronger emission lines are preferred in the studies of @xmath6 .",
    "for example , the flux ratios of n  v@xmath231240 to c  iv@xmath231549 and n  v@xmath231240 to he  ii@xmath231640 have been utilized to infer @xmath6 by comparing them with the prediction of photoionization models .",
    "@xcite showed that the flux ratios of ( si  iv@xmath231397+o  iv]@xmath231402)/c  iv@xmath231549 and al  iii@xmath231857/c  iv@xmath231549 are also useful to infer @xmath6 through photoionization model runs , that are used for inferring @xmath6 in high-@xmath0 qsos ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "since most previous studies used the rest - frame uv spectra to infer blr metallicity of high - redshift type-1 qsos , we therefore focus on high - luminosity qsos at low - redshfit , for which uv spectra are available , in order to investigate the chemical properties of low-@xmath0 qsos compared to high-@xmath0 qsos .",
    "the palomar - green ( pg ) qsos @xcite are well - studied low-@xmath0 luminous type-1 agns , and the uv spectra of many pg qsos have been previously obtained with space facilities , thus suitable for our blr metallicity study .",
    "we selected all pg qsos at @xmath1 ( 89 objects ) , for which reliable black hole masses are available from either reverberation mapping results @xcite or single - epoch estimates @xcite .",
    "to investigate blr metallicity , we will use the flux ratios of n  v@xmath231240/c  iv@xmath231549 , n  v@xmath231240/he  ii@xmath231640 , and ( si  iv@xmath231397+o  iv]@xmath231402)/c  iv@xmath231549 , since these emission lines have relatively large equivalent widths .",
    "thus , we searched for available uv spectra previously obtained from space facilities , using the mikulski archive for space telescopes ( mast ) . among 89 pg qsos at @xmath1 , the archival uv spectra covering",
    "the required emission lines were available for 86 objects . among them , we excluded 7 broad absorption line ( bal ) qsos , since the strong absorption features prevent us from measuring the emission - line fluxes accurately .",
    "we also excluded 9 additional objects , for which the spectral quality is too low to identify the aforementioned emission lines .",
    "thus , we finalized a sample of 70 pg qsos for this work as listed in table 1 .",

    "the weaker correlation of @xmath9  with @xmath6  at low-@xmath0 can be interpreted as combination of two additional effects .",
    "first , gas metallicity increased from high-@xmath0 to low-@xmath0 by further star formation after major bh growth . in other words , for the same galaxy mass ( or black hole mass ) , metallicity has been increased , particularly at the nuclear region , leading to higher metallicity at fixed @xmath9  compared to high-@xmath0 objects . for example , nuclear star formation induced by secular process ( e.g. , bar instability ) and galaxy interaction may sufficiently increase metallicity ( e.q . , * ? ? ?",
    "another difference between low-@xmath0 and high-@xmath0 is the gas fraction , especially for massive galaxies like quasar host galaxies .",
    "the minor merger process is more important as an agn triggering mechanism at low-@xmath0 ( e.q .",

    "thus , as a consequence of minor mergers between a gas - poor massive galaxy ( i.e. , a quasar host galaxy ) and a relatively gas - rich less - massive galaxy , the metallicity of accreting gas onto the nucleus can be largely affected by the chemical property of the merging , less - massive galaxy . in this case",
    ", the metallicity of accreting gas does not simply reflect the mass - metallicity relation of the host galaxy .",
    "second , the @xmath9-to-@xmath544 ratio may change over cosmic time .",
    "if black hole mass was higher at fixed stellar mass at high-@xmath0 , then by combining galaxy mass - metallicity relation and @xmath542 relation , we may expect similar @xmath9-metallicity relation in low-@xmath0 , but with a different normalization .",
    "in other words , at fixed metallicity , @xmath9  is lower in low-@xmath0 than in high-@xmath0 . although it is beyond the scope of the current work to quantify and compare these two effects , it is reasonable to conclude that coupling between black hole mass with gas metallicity becomes much weaker with decreasing redshift .",
    "to investigate the chemical properties of low-@xmath0 qsos , we measured the flux ratios of the rest - frame uv emission lines as metallicity indicators using a sample of 70 low-@xmath0 pg qsos at @xmath1 . by comparing blr gas metallicity with black hole mass , luminosity and eddington ratio , we find that @xmath6  correlates with eddington ratio while @xmath6  shows much weaker correlation with @xmath9 , indicating that the metal enrichment at the central part of host galaxies is closely connected to the accretion activity of agn .",
    "these trends are different from high-@xmath0 qsos , which shows a tighter correlation between @xmath6  and @xmath9  and a weaker correlation between @xmath6  and eddington ratio .",
    "the apparent difference between low-@xmath0 and high-@xmath0 samples seems to be caused by the limited dynamical range in the high-@xmath0 sample .",
    "various star formation mechanism can increase blr gas metallicity the cosmic time , increasing the scatter in the metallicity correlation with properties of agn in low-@xmath0 .",
