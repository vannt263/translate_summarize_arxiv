    "extraordinary optical transmission through arrays of holes of subwavelength diameter in metal films has been the subject of extensive study since detection of large enhancements in transmitted intensity was first reported.@xcite several mechanisms responsible for this enhancement have been discussed , including excitation of surface plasmon polaritons ( spps ) of the film surfaces.@xcite in this paper we propose a novel physical realization for studying possible anomalous optical transmission through a thin film . in particular , we consider a film comprised of a type - ii superconductor subjected to a strong magnetic field , which causes a phase transition of the superconductor to a state with a lattice of abrikosov vortices.@xcite due to the dielectric contrast between regions inside abrikosov vortices and outside them , these vortices can behave in a manner analogous to an array of holes in the metal . by controlling the properties of the abrikosov lattice of vortices via external magnetic field strength and temperature , it is possible to change the light transmission through the lattice of vortices .",
    "we consider resonant light transmission by the vortices and calculate the properties of spps excited in the film by the incident radiation .",

    "we consider the following scenario of anomalous light transmission through the film ( analogously to ref .",

    "the incident light excites an spp on the front surface .",
    "subsequently , the front spp resonantly excites through the vortices an spp on the opposite surface of the film .",
    "finally , this second spp emits photons from the opposite side of the film .",

    "have been used as components in optical transmission nano - materials.@xcite it was found that dielectric losses are substantially reduced in the sc metals relative to analogous structures made out of normal metals , and also that band edges tend to be sharper with the sc metals .    here",
    "we study optical transmission through a film of thickness @xmath6 comprised of a type - ii superconductor subjected to an external perpendicular magnetic field such that the superconductor is in the mixed state @xmath4 .",
    "we consider a highly anisotropic superconductor where the axis corresponding to large plasma frequency is perpendicular to the superconducting film , and the axis corresponding to small plasma frequency is located in the plane parallel to the film .",
    "an example of such a superconductor is a quasi - one - dimensional type - ii superconductor.@xcite we will choose the incident light direction so that light propagates along the axis of this quasi - one - dimensional superconductor .",
    "the corresponding electric field excites the polarization in the direction perpendicular to the axis .",
    "the plasma frequency in the direction perpendicular to the axis is sufficiently small that the photonic band gap is located within the region of the superconducting gap .",
    "we show herein that the surface plasmon polariton ( spp ) band gap and hence light transmission @xcite are tunable via external magnetic field @xmath2 and temperature @xmath7 .",

    "the axes of the vortices ( directed along the @xmath8 axis ) are perpendicular to the surface of the superconductor .",
    "we assume the @xmath9 and @xmath10 axes to be parallel to the two real - space lattice vectors that characterize the 2d triangular lattice of abrikosov vortices in the film ( the angle between @xmath9 and @xmath10 is @xmath11 ) .",
    "the nodes of the 2d triangular lattice of abrikosov vortices are assumed to be placed on the @xmath12 and @xmath13 axes .",

    "although light itself can not penetrate into the film further than the skin - depth , it can excite surface - plasmon polaritons ( spps ) , which are collective excitations of the electron plasma at a surface of metal ( surface plasmons ) coupled with photons.@xcite these spps can be resonantly coupled through the vortices .",

    "we employ the following fourier expansions for the dielectric constant and electric field : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the reciprocal lattice vector directed along the @xmath12 axis connecting the nearest nodes of the 2d triangular lattice of the abrikosov vortices .",
    "we have omitted the expressions for the @xmath13 components of the fourier expansions since they are analogous to the expressions for the @xmath12 components , and we consider only spps propagating in the @xmath12 direction . using a weak field treatment ( due to the small dielectric contrast inside vs. outside the vortices ) , and retaining only the two first components of the fourier series , we have@xcite @xmath37 this approximation is valid when the distance between two nearest abrikosov vortices is not much greater than the size of an abrikosov vortex ( the distance between two nearest abrikosov vortices is about the same order of magnitude as the size of an abrikosov vortex ) .",
