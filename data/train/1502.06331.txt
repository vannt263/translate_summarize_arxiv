    "a lot of gravitational solitons in general relativity , which describe gravitational solitonic waves propagating throughout spacetime , have been found within the framework of so - called inverse scattering method  @xcite . in particular , it has attracted a lot of relativists since it can generate black hole solutions in an axisymmetric and stationary case  @xcite , in addition to exact solutions describing non - linear gravitational waves on various physical background .",
    "the method was immediately generalized to the higher dimensional einstein equations ( see the references in @xcite ) but such a simple generalization to higher dimensions tends to lead to singular solutions .",
    "however , @xmath0 years ago , pomeransky  @xcite succeeded in modifying the original inverse scattering method  @xcite so that it can generate regular solutions even in higher - dimensions .",
    "thanks to this , as for five dimensions , several black holes solutions were found  @xcite .",
    "a diagonal metric form of a cylindrically symmetric spacetime makes the vacuum einstein equation to an extremely simple structure of a linear wave equation in a flat background . as a solution of such a equation , einstein - rosen wave , which can be interpreted as superposition of cylindrical gravitational waves with a @xmath1 mode only , were obtained  @xcite .",
    "however , the existence of nontrivial non - diagonal components of a metric drastically changes the structure of the einstein equation since it generally yields a @xmath2 mode together with non - linearity .",
    "et al_.  @xcite numerically studied non - linear interaction of cylindrical gravitational waves of both polarization modes and showed that a @xmath1 mode converts to a @xmath2 mode .",
    "this phenomenon is named _ gravitational faraday effect _ after the faraday effect in electrodynamics .",
    "tomimatsu  @xcite studied the gravitational faraday rotation for cylindrical gravitational solitons generated by the inverse scattering technique .",
    "moreover , the interaction of gravitational soliton waves with a cosmic string was also studied in  @xcite .",
    "as one of new attempts to understand strong gravitational effects we have recently constructed a new cylindrically symmetric single - soliton solution from minkowski seed by the pomeransky s inverse scattering method and clarified the behavior of the new solution including the effect similar to the gravitational faraday rotation .    in this paper , for further investigation we first construct more complicated gravitational two - soliton solutions with complex conjugate poles by the pomeransky s method , which are considered as cylindrically symmetric gravitational waves with rich structure and can be used to study gravitational non - linear effects .",
    "one of important and remarkable features of the solutions is that there are no null singularities which appear generally in the case of single - soliton solutions .",
    "we may therefore adopt the picture similar to the scattering theory that from the past null infinity one gravitational wave packet comes into ` the interaction region ' near the symmetric axis and after reflection leave the region for the future null infinity .",
    "the behavior of the wave packet can be analyzed by following the time sequential images and also by comparing the physical quantities measured in the past and future infinity . as an interesting example",
