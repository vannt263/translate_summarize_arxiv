    "recently a great interest has been devoted to the study of the effects of generalized uncertainty principles ( gups ) and modified dispersion relations ( mdrs ) on black holes thermodynamics .",
    "the concepts of gups and mdrs originates from several studies in string theory approach to quantum gravity @xmath0 $ ] , loop quantum gravity @xcite , noncommutative space - time algebra @xmath1 $ ] and black holes gedanken experiments @xmath2 $ ] .",
    "all these approaches indicate that the standard heisenberg uncertainty principle must be generalized to incorporate additional uncertainties when quantum gravitational effects are taken into account .",
    "actually it is believed that any promising candidate for a quantum theory of gravity  must include the gups and/or mdrs  as central ingredients .",
    "the main consequence of the gup is the appearance of a minimal length scale of the order of the planck length which can not be probed , providing a natural uv cut - off , and thus corrections to black holes thermodynamic parameters  are expected at the planck scale .    the consequences of gups and/or mdrs on black holes thermodynamics have been considered intensively in the recent literature on the subject @xmath3 $ ] .",
    "notably , it has been shown that gup prevents black holes from complete evaporation , exactly like the standard heisenberg principle prevents the hydrogen atom from total collapse @xcite .",
    "then at the final stage of the hawking radiation process of a black hole , a inert black hole remnant ( bhr ) continue to exist with zero entropy , zero heat capacity and a finite non zero temperature .",
    "the inert character of the bhr , besides gravitational interactions , makes this object a serious candidate to explain the nature of dark matter @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "a particular attention has been also devoted to the computation of the entropy of a black hole and the sub - leading logarithmic correction @xmath4 $ ] .",
    "all the above studies have been performed with a gup to leading order in the planck length .",
    "however , recent generalization of the gup induces quantitative corrections to the entropy and then influences the evaporation phase of the black hole @xcite .",
    "besides this growing interest in quantum gravity phenomenology , a intense activity is actually devoted to possible production of black holes at particle colliders @xcite and in ultrahigh energy cosmic ray ( uhecr ) airshowers @xcite .",
    "the next generation of particle colliders are planned to reach a _",
    "c - m _ energy of the order of few _ tev _ , a scale at which the complete evaporation of bh is expected to end , leaving up in a scenario with gup a inert bhr .",
    "then , it is phenomenologically relevant , to obtain the corrections to bh thermodynamic parameters in the framework of a gup beyond the leading order in the planck length .    in this paper",
    "we discuss the effects , brought by a generalization of the gup to all orders in the planck length , on thermodynamic parameters of the schwarzschild black hole .",
    "hereafter , we refer to this version of gup as gup@xmath5 .",
    "the organization of this work is as follows . in section 2",
    ", we introduce a deformed position and momentum operators algebra leading to gup@xmath5 and examine its various implications . in section 3 , the hawking temperature and entropy are computed and the departures from the standard case shown . in section 4 , we calculate the deviation from the standard stefan - boltzmann law of the black body radiation spectrum and investigate the hawking evaporation process of black holes by a calculation of the evaporation rate , the decay time and the heat capacity .",
    "finally we compare our results with the ones obtained in the context of the gup to leading order in the planck length commonly used in the literature .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in the last section .",
    "loop quantum gravity and string theory approach to quantum gravity predict slight deviations in the laws describing photons propagation in vacuum .",
    "it is expected that these effects , leading to a modified dispersion relation ( mdr ) , could be amplified by cosmological distances and then become observables @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "quantum gravity phenomenology has been tackled within effective models based on mdrs and/or gups and containing the minimal length as a natural uv cut - off .",
    "recently the relation between these approaches has been clarified and established sabine .",
    "the idea of a minimal length can be modelled in terms of a quantized space - time and goes back to the early days of quantum field theory snyder ( see also @xmath6 $ ] ) .",
    "an other approach is to consider deformations to the standard heisenberg algebra @xcite , which lead to generalized uncertainty principles . in this section",
    "we follow the latter approach and exploit results recently obtained .",
    "indeed , it has been shown in the context of canonical noncommutative field theory in the coherent states representation @xcite and field theory on non - anticommutative superspace @xcite , that the feynman propagator display an exponential uv cut - off of the form @xmath7 , where the parameter @xmath8 is related to the minimal length .",
    "this framework has been further applied , in series of papers nicolini , to the black hole evaporation process .    at the quantum mechanical level",
    ", the essence of the uv finiteness of the feynman propagator can be also captured by a non linear relation , @xmath9 , between the momentum and the wave vector of the particle @xcite .",
    "this relation must be invertible and has to fulfill the following requirements :    1 .   for smaller energies than the cut - off the usual dispersion relation is recovered .",
    "2 .   for large energies",
    ", the wave vector asymptotically reaches the cut - off .    in this case , the usual momentum measure @xmath10 is deformed and becomes @xmath11 . in the following , we will restrict ourselves to the isotropic case and work with one space - like dimension .",
    "following @xcite and setting @xmath12 we have @xmath13where @xmath14 is a dimensionless constant of order one .    from eq.@xmath15",
    "we obtain the dispersion relation @xmath16from which we have the following minimum compton wavelength @xmath17    let us show that these results can be obtained from the following representation of the position and momentum operators   @xmath18    the corrections to the standard heisenberg algebra become effective in the so - called quantum regime where the momentum and length scales are of the order of the planck mass @xmath19 and of the planck length @xmath20 respectively .",
    "the hermiticity condition of the position operator implies the following modified completeness relation @xmath21and modified scalar product @xmath22from eq.@xmath23 we observe that we have reproduced the gaussian damping factor in the feynman propagator @xcite .",
    "the algebra defined by eq .",
    "@xmath24 leads to the following generalized commutator and generalized uncertainty principle ( gup@xmath5 ) @xmath25 = i\\hbar \\exp \\left ( \\frac{\\alpha ^{2}l_{pl}^{2}}{\\hbar ^{2}}p^{2}\\right ) , \\quad \\left ( \\delta x\\right ) \\left ( \\delta p\\right )",

    ". using the property @xmath27  and @xmath28 the saturate gup@xmath5 is then given by    @xmath29    taking the square of this expression we obtain    @xmath30    where we have set @xmath31 and @xmath32    the equation given by eq.@xmath33 is exactly the definition of the lambert function @xcite .",
    "the lambert @xmath34  function is a multivalued functions .",
    "its different branches are labelled by the integer @xmath35 .",
    "when @xmath36 is a real number eq.@xmath33 have two real solutions for @xmath37 , denoted by @xmath38 and @xmath39 , or it can have only one real solution for @xmath40 , namely @xmath38 .",
    "for -@xmath41 , eq.([lam ] ) have no real solutions .    using eq.([lam ] ) the uncertainty in momentum",
    "is then given by @xmath42then from the argument of the lambert function in eq.@xmath43 we have the following condition @xmath44which leads to a minimal uncertainty in position given by @xmath45the absolutely smallest uncertainty in position or minimal length  is obtained for physical states for which we have @xmath46 and @xmath47 and is given by @xmath48 in terms of the minimal length the momentum uncertainty becomes @xmath49here we observe that @xmath50 is a small parameter , by virtue of the gup@xmath5 , and perturbative expansions to all orders in the planck length can be safely performed .",
    "indeed a series expansion of eq.([argup ] ) gives the corrections to the standard heisenberg principle @xmath51this expression of @xmath52 containing only odd powers of @xmath53 is consistent with a recent analysis in which string theory and loop quantum gravity , considered as the most serious candidates for a theory of quantum gravity , put severe constraints on the possible forms of gups and mdrs @xcite .    before ending this section and for later use",
    "let us recall the form of the gup to leading order in the planck length widely used in the literature on quantum gravity phenomenology .",
    "this gup is given by @xmath54a simple calculation leads to the following minimal length @xmath55which is of order of the planck length .",
    "however , as nicely noted in sabine , this form of gup do not fulfill the second requirement listed above . in the following sections we use the form of the gup given by eq.@xmath56 and investigate the thermodynamics of the schwarzschild black hole .",
    "we use units @xmath57 which imply @xmath58",

    "hawking picture , temperature and entropy of the schwarzschild black hole of mass @xmath60 are @xcite    @xmath67    let us then examine the corrections to the above expressions due to the gup@xmath5 .",
    "following the heuristic argument of bekenstein we have @xmath68using eq.@xmath56 , the gup@xmath5-corrected hawking temperature is @xmath69on substituting eq.@xmath70 into eq.@xmath71 we obtain the following black hole maximum temperature @xmath72the corrections to the standard hawking temperature are obtained by expanding eq.@xmath71 in terms of @xmath73 .",
    "indeed we obtain @xmath74the variation of the hawking temperature , eq.@xmath71 , with the mass of the black hole is shown in figure 1 .",
    "it is interesting to inverse eq.@xmath71 and write the mass of the black hole as a function of the temperature @xmath75this relation shows that  for temperatures larger than @xmath76 , the black hole mass increases with temperature . in our framework , such a behavior is forbidden by the cut - off brought by gup@xmath5 .",
    "however , in the noncommutative approach to radiating black hole , this behavior is allowed because of a lack of a generalized uncertainty principle nicolini .",

    "gup  ( doted line ) and gup@xmath5 results  ( solid line ) for @xmath14=0.75 @xmath77 , @xmath14=1 @xmath78 , @xmath14=1.25 @xmath79respectively .",
    "we turn now to the calculation of the micro canonical entropy of a large black hole . in the standard situation",
    "the entropy is proportional to the black hole horizon - area .",
    "following heuristic considerations due to bekenstein , the minimum increase of the area of a black hole absorbing a classical particle of energy @xmath80 and size @xmath81 is given by @xmath82 . at the quantum mechanical level the size and the energy of the particle are constrained to verify @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",

    "the dependence on the planck length is contained in @xmath105 .",
    "we observe that we have reproduced , in our framework with gup@xmath5 , the log - area correction with a negative sign .",

    "it follows that the gup@xmath5-corrected temperature and entropy are respectively higher and smaller than the semi classical results .",
    "as a warming to study the hawking radiation process of the schwarzschild black hole , we examine the effects of gup@xmath5 on the black body radiation spectrum . with the aid of the squeezed momentum measure given by eq.@xmath23 , which suppress the contribution of unwanted high momenta , the energy density of a black body at temperature @xmath113 is defined by @xmath114using the variable @xmath115 @xmath116 and expanding the exponential , equation @xmath117 becomes @xmath118now with the help of the following definition of the riemann zeta function @xmath119we obtain @xmath120this energy density is defined only for values of temperatures below some characteristic scale .",

    "we clearly observe that the divergence for @xmath139 in the standard description of the black hole evaporation process is now completely regularized by the gup@xmath5 .",
    "this regularization is also reflected by the constraint @xmath140 , which suppress the evaporation process beyond the planck temperature .",
    "this phenomenon is similar to the prevention , by the standard uncertainty principle , of the hydrogen atom from total collapse . in our picture , the regularization can be considered as a dynamical effect and  not as a consequence of any quantum symmetry in the theory .",

    "on the other hand , we observe that the evaporation phase ends when the bh mass becomes equal to @xmath66 with a minimum rate given by @xmath149thus the evaporation process of a black hole with initial mass @xmath150 continue until the horizon radius becomes @xmath151 leaving a massive relic referred to , in the literature , as a black hole remnant ( bhr ) . to find the nature of the bhr we calculate the heat capacity defined by @xmath152using the expression of temperature given by @xmath71",

    "the correction terms to the heat capacity due to gup@xmath5 are all positive indicating that the evaporation process is accelerated and leading to a corrected decay time smaller than the decay time in the standard case .",
    "let us consider a black hole starting the evaporation process with a mass @xmath60 and ending the process with the minimum mass @xmath66 .",
    "using @xmath167 and the variable @xmath168 the decay time is given by    @xmath169    performing the integration we obtain @xmath170 + c ,   \\label{decay}\\]]where the constant @xmath171  is the value for @xmath172 and @xmath173 for @xmath14 of order one . ignoring @xmath174 and performing a series expansion in @xmath175  we have @xmath176then to first order in @xmath137 the relative correction to the decay time is @xmath177where @xmath178 is the decay time without gup@xmath5 . from eq.@xmath179 , it follows that black holes with gup@xmath5 are hotter and decay faster than in the standard case .",
    "let us now turn to a comparison of the corrected bh thermodynamics with gup@xmath5 with the corrections brought by the gup to leading order in the planck length .",
    "since our comparison is quantitative we use the planck units . repeating the same calculations as above with the gup given by eq.@xmath180 , the temperature , the entropy and the heat capacity of the black hole",
    "are respectively given by    @xmath181    @xmath182    and    @xmath183    the minimum black hole mass and maximum temperature allowed by gup are @xmath184 and @xmath185 in figures 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 we have plotted , besides the results obtained with gup@xmath5 , the variation of temperature , entropy , evaporation rate and heat capacity with gup as functions of the black hole mass for different values of the parameter @xmath186 figure 2 shows , that in the scenario with gup@xmath187 the bh entropy  decreases compared to the entropy in the standard case and the scenario with gup .",
    "this reveals the deeper quantum nature of the black hole in the scenario with gup@xmath188 .",
    "thus quantum effects become manifest at an earlier stage of the evaporation phase than was predicted by the semi classical hawking analysis @xcite and the gup analysis @xmath189    the calculation of the evaporation rate in the framework with gup requires a careful analysis . in all the calculations",
    "done until now , the validity of the stefan - boltzmann law is assumed , ignoring the uv cut - off implemented by gup .",
    "however , it was pointed in @xcite that the effect of the gup should be also reflected in a modification of the de broglie wave length relation    @xmath190    this relation must be translated into a modification of the momentum measure such that the contributions of high momenta are suppressed . as shown in c222 , the gup to leading order in the planck length leads to a squeezing of the momentum measure by a factor @xmath191 then following the same calculation leading to eq.@xmath130 the energy density of a black body with gup is    @xmath192    performing the integral and using the same argument as before , we obtain the expression given by eq .",
