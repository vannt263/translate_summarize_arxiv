    "since the discovery of high - temperature superconductivity , doped antiferromagnets ( af ) have been studied intensively .",
    "it is widely accepted that many properties of the superconducting cuprates are determined by the hole - doped cuo@xmath3 planes .",
    "a number of experiments @xcite indicate that the cuprates are near a quantum - critical point of antiferromagnetic instability : the undoped materials are known to be antiferromagnetic mott - hubbard insulators , whereas hole doping destroys the antiferromagnetic long - range order ( lro ) and leads to superconductivity .",
    "the investigation of the interplay between long - range magnetic order and quantum disorder is therefore of great theoretical interest .",
    "a model system which shows a quantum transition between an ordered and a disordered magnetic phase is the @xmath4 bilayer antiferromagnet @xcite . here each of the two planes is composed of a nearest - neighbor heisenberg model with coupling constant @xmath5 .",
    "the spins of corresponding sites of each layer are coupled antiferromagnetically with a coupling constant @xmath6 . in the limit of small @xmath7",
    "the model describes two weakly coupled af planes . at @xmath8 this system possesses af long - range order and gapless goldstone excitations . in the opposite case of large @xmath7 , pairs of spins interacting via @xmath6 form spin singlets being weakly coupled by @xmath5 . then the spin excitations are gapped triplet modes , there is no magnetic lro . at a critical ratio @xmath9 a quantum transition between the two phases occurs which is believed to be of the o(3 ) universality class @xcite .",
    "the bilayer antiferromagnet has been studied by a number of numerical and analytical techniques .",
    "quantum monte carlo calculations @xcite and series expansions @xcite yield an order - disorder transition point of @xmath10 . a similar result has also been obtained analytically using a diagrammatic approach to account for the hard - core interaction between triplet excitations @xcite .",
    "bond - operator mean - field theory has recently been applied to the bilayer heisenberg af @xcite and gives a transition point of @xmath11 .",
    "note that schwinger boson mean - field theory @xcite predicts a very large value of @xmath12 , and also self - consistent spin - wave theory @xcite , which yields @xmath13 , fails to reproduce the numerical results .",
    "chubukov and morr @xcite have pointed out that this discrepancy is due to the neglect of longitudinal spin fluctuations in the conventional spin - wave approach .    in this paper",
    "we discuss the bilayer antiferromagnet at zero temperature with hole doping as an additional degree of freedom .",
    "we consider the standard @xmath1 model on a bilayer square lattice consisting of @xmath14 sites per plane , so the total number of lattice sites is @xmath15 .",
    "each pair of corresponding sites in different planes is considered to form a rung , so we have @xmath14 rungs . more precisely , the hamiltonian reads @xmath16 here and in the following @xmath17 and @xmath18 denote @xmath19 of the bilayer lattice , @xmath20 denotes a summation over all pairs of nearest - neighbor rungs .",
    "@xmath21 is the plane index , so @xmath22 denotes a lattice site .",
    "@xmath23 is the electronic spin operator and @xmath24 the electron number operator at site @xmath22 .",
    "the electron operators @xmath25 exclude double occupancies , .",
    "we choose the @xmath26-axis along the direction of the rungs , i.e. , perpendicular to the planes .",
    "first we want to comment the zero - temperature phase diagram of the doped bilayer @xmath1 model which has to our knowledge not been systematically studied up to now .",
    "the following non - thermal control parameters can be considered : the ratio @xmath7 , the doping level @xmath27 , and the relative hopping strength @xmath28 . the doped single - layer antiferromagnet is known to exhibit a strong dependence of magnetic properties on the hole concentration @xmath27 . with increasing hole concentration the staggered magnetization decreases and vanishes at a critical hole concentration @xmath29 of a few percent where the system becomes paramagnetic @xcite .",
    "( this is consistent with experiments on high-@xmath30 superconductors @xcite . ) on the other hand , in the undoped limit a large interplane coupling @xmath6 also destroys the antiferromagnetic lro as discussed above .",
    "thus it is likely that the system shows ( i ) af lro accompanied by spontaneous symmetry breaking and the existence of massless goldstone modes in the region of very small doping and small @xmath6 .",
    "otherwise it is paramagnetic ; here one has to distinguish between ( ii ) a spin - gapped phase which occurs at small @xmath27 , small hopping @xmath31 , and large interplane coupling , and ( iii ) a gapless phase at larger doping and small interplane coupling . the gapped phase ( ii )",
    "is dominated by interplane singlet pairs ( incompressible spin fluid ) whereas the gapless phase ( iii ) shows only weak interplane coupling and behaves mainly like a single layer system at @xmath32 ( compressible spin fluid ) .",
    "( issues like pseudogap features and transport properties will not be adressed here . ) in the present work we restrict ourselves to the zero - doping limit ( one hole ) .",
    "so the magnetic ( bulk ) properties will not be affected by the doped hole , i.e. , we probe the transition between the antiferromagnetic ( i ) and the gapped ( incompressible ) paramagnetic phase ( ii ) .",
    "the dynamical properties of holes in high-@xmath30 superconductors have been subject to a lot of experimental and theoretical work .",
    "angle - resolved photoemission ( arpes ) experiments at zero@xcite or small doping@xcite indicate a quasiparticle band with a small bandwidth providing evidence for strong electronic correlations in the high-@xmath30 compounds .",
    "a large number of numerical and analytical studies reveal that a single hole in an af spin background has non - trivial properties : the spectral function consists of a pronounced coherent peak at the bottom of the spectrum and a incoherent background at higher energies .",
    "the coherent peak can be associated with the motion of a dressed hole , i.e. , a hole surrounded by spin defects ( `` spin polaron '' )  @xcite .",
    "the hole motion in bilayer antiferromagnets has been studied in a few papers and only for a small parameter range : using self - consistent born approximation ( scba ) it has been shown @xcite that small interplane coupling only weakly affects the hole properties .",
    "exact diagonalization studies @xcite have indicated a larger effect of the interplane coupling at finite doping",
    ". however , the system sizes accessible to numerical methods ( @xmath33 in ref . )",
    "do not allow for the study of small hole densities and arbitrary momenta .",
    "in this paper we prefer an analytical approach to the one - hole problem which is based on the picture of the spin - bag quasiparticle ( qp ) or magnetic polaron @xcite .",
    "the magnetic background for the hole motion will be modelled within a modified bond - operator representation of the spins on each rung . in the ordered phase one type of triplet bosons condenses which will be included in the modified basis operators .",
    "so our excitation operators continuously interpolate between the triplet excitations of a singlet product state and the transverse and longitudinal excitations of a nel - ordered state .",
    "the deviations of the spin background caused by the hole motion are described by a set of path operators @xcite .",
    "the one - hole spectral function will be evaluated using a cumulant version @xcite of mori - zwanzig projection technique@xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we propose a ground - state wave function for the undoped bilayer antiferromagnet . in sec .",
    "iii we develop the hamiltonian for the doped system in this new operator representation and discuss the various hole motion processes .",
    "iv focuses on the motion of a single hole in an otherwise half - filled bilayer antiferromagnet .",
    "the one - hole spectral function for this case corresponds directly to the result of an arpes experiment on an undoped system . after a brief sketch of the projection technique",
    "we investigate the spectral properties in dependence of the magnetic background , especially when crossing the phase boundary between gapped paramagnet and antiferromagnet .",
    "the results show that the character of the one - hole spectrum is mainly determined by the local spin environment of the hole whereas the spectrum changes only weakly when crossing the order - disorder transition .",
    "a conclusion will close the paper .",
    "to begin with , we consider the case of half - filling . using bond operators we derive a wave function which describes the ground states in both the quantum disordered phase ( at large @xmath6 ) and the nel phase ( at small @xmath6 ) .",
    "the wave function will be constructed within a cumulant formalism @xcite .",

    "approaching the quantum critical point the triplet excitations will become gapless at momentum @xmath48 , see e.g. refs . .",
    "the magnetic quantum phase transition to an antiferromagnetically ordered state includes spontaneous symmetry breaking and can be described via the condensation of triplet bosons in one particular direction ( which has to be induced by an infinitesimal staggered field ) . neglecting fluctuations a symmetry - broken state with a condensate of @xmath26-type triplet bosons",

    "this can be seen from the equality @xmath113 here we have used the fact that a cumulant expectation value does not change when the operator @xmath114 is subject to cumulant ordering instead of being applied directly to the wave function @xmath47 ( see ref . ) .",

    "the magnetization in the limit of decoupled planes ( @xmath118 ) is around 86 % of its classical value being larger than predicted by monte - carlo and spin - wave calculations .",
    "the described approximation can be systematically improved by including higher - order fluctuations . this behavior is also known from calculations within the coupled - cluster method for the heisenberg model @xcite .",
    "it can be shown that in the limit of an infinite set of operators the cumulant method yields exact results .",
    "for instance , if we include two additional operators @xmath92 with three and four fluctuations on adjacent sites into the operator @xmath85 ( [ omega_o ] ) the transition point shifts to @xmath119 . however , the analytical and numerical effort to set - up and solve the non - linear equations equivalent to ( [ coeff_eq_diso],[coeff_eq_o ] ) increases drastically with including higher - order fluctuations .",
    "the solution of the non - linear equations ( [ coeff_eq_diso],[coeff_eq_o ] ) shows that the absolute values of all coefficients in @xmath85 are small compared to 1 . in the disordered phase",

    "; higher - order fluctuations acquire a coefficient being one or more orders smaller in magnitude .",
    "the fact that the coefficients are small is equivalent to the statement that the total triplet density even at the transition point is small ( @xmath123 ) , see ref . .    in fig",

    "however , paths of length 4 and more are hard to access for the bilayer system due to the increasing numerical effort . )    the main contribution to the hole motion in the af case can be understood as follows : the hopping hole locally destroys the antiferromagnetic spin order leaving behind a string of spin defects .",
    "quantum spin fluctuations can repair pairs of frustrated spins which leads to a coherent motion in one of the antiferromagnetic sublattices ( spin - fluctuation - assisted hopping ) . for @xmath203",
    "the bandwidth of this coherent hole motion is of order @xmath5 because the spin - flip part of the intraplane heisenberg interaction @xmath5 is necessary to remove the spin defects caused by hopping .",
    "with increasing @xmath6 the bandwidth of the dispersion first decreases ; at a value of @xmath185 the minima move to @xmath48 and @xmath186 .",
    "slightly larger values of @xmath6 lead to an increase of the bandwidth , and spectral weight is transferred to a band which has nearly tight - binding form .",
    "so the lowest pole at @xmath204 has very small weight around momentum @xmath186 .",

    "[ fig_disp1 ] . in the paramagnetic phase for larger @xmath6 the shadow band disappears .",
    "the qp peak has a dispersion being nearly the one of a free fermion but with a reduced bandwidth .",
    "this behavior follows from the existence of the direct hopping term with prefactor @xmath205 in @xmath206 ( [ hh ] ) .",

    "[ fig_disp2 ] . again , for small @xmath198 ( small @xmath6 ) the dispersion character is `` antiferromagnetic '' whereas for large @xmath198 ( large @xmath6 ) the bands have a simple tight - binding form . for @xmath208 and @xmath209 their dispersion is given by @xmath210 the bandwidth for the in - plane motion is reduced by a factor of 2 compared to a free fermion since the relevant hopping matrix element is @xmath211 .",

    "[ fig_bandw1 ] we finally show the bandwidth of the qp dispersion for the case of vanishing interplane hopping and @xmath212 , i.e. , for the dispersions shown in fig . [ fig_disp1 ] .",
    "it can clearly be seen that the cross - over from an `` antiferromagnetic '' to a simple tight - binding dispersion occurs at @xmath185 and is connected with a pronounced minimum in the qp bandwidth . for @xmath213 the bandwidth increases and saturates for large @xmath6 at @xmath214 as discussed above .",
    "results for other values of @xmath199 are qualitatively similar .",
    "the minimum in the dispersion ( i.e. the cross - over point ) shifts with @xmath199 : for @xmath215 it is located at @xmath216 , for @xmath217 it is found at @xmath218 .",

    "the basic ingredience for the observed behavior of the qp dispersion is the competition between direct hopping which dominates in the disordered phase and spin - fluctuation - assisted hopping known from the single - layer af .",
    "the relevant matrix element for direct hopping between states without spin deviations is @xmath219 where @xmath220 are nearest - neighbor sites and @xmath83 denotes the undoped background state .",

    "the matrix element for the spin - fluctuation process ( being the most important for not too small values of @xmath31 ) can be written as where @xmath224 moves the hole by two hopping steps ( creating a path of spin defects ) and @xmath220 are now next - nearest neighbors . transforming the expectation value into spin correlation functions one obtains @xcite @xmath225 where the average over the possible paths of length 2 has already been performed .",

    "values @xmath227 correspond to an `` antiferromagnetic '' dispersion whereas @xmath228 occurs for a nearest - neighbor tight - binding dispersion . neglecting longer paths and more complicated contributions to the hole motion",
    "the qp dispersion is given by the sum of a nearest - neighbor and a next - nearest neighbor dispersion originating from the two processes described above .",
    "then @xmath229 can be roughly estimated from the matrix elements @xmath230 and @xmath231 : @xmath232 the prefactor of @xmath230 arises from the number of nearest neighbors ; for the @xmath231-prefactor the influence of two hopping steps has to be kept in mind , a fit to numerical results for the single - layer problem yields a value of order 1 . from this",
    "we see that the cross - over phenomenon can be understood in terms of the interplay between short - range spin correlations and the ratio of @xmath199 .",
    "[ fig_spincorr1 ] shows the values of @xmath233 for nearest and next - nearest neighbor sites obtained from the present calculation . with increasing @xmath7 the absolute values of the in - plane spin correlation functions decrease from their single - layer values and",
    "are weakened within the antiferromagnetic phase . at the transition",
    "point the magnitude has dropped by a factor around @xmath234 compared to @xmath68 which again coincides with the fact that the density of spin ( triplet ) excitations is small in the disordered phase even at the transition point @xcite .",
    "we have also plotted the quantity @xmath229 estimated from eq .",
    "( [ delta_approx ] ) for two different values of @xmath199 .",
    "one notices a semi - quantitative agreement of the zero in @xmath229 and the dispersion minimum described in sec .",
    "in this paper we have presented for the first time a systematic analytical study of the one - hole dynamics on both sides of a magnetic ordering transition in a low - dimensional antiferromagnet .",
    "the system under consideration was a bilayer antiferromagnet described by a @xmath235-@xmath236 hamiltonian in the limit of zero doping .",
    "the magnetic background state has been modelled with modified bond operators . in the disordered phase",
    "these operators describe the singlet ground state and the triplet excitations . in the af ordered phase they account for the condensation of one type of triplet bosons and describe transverse as well as longitudinal fluctuations . using the spin - polaron concept which describes the one - hole states in terms of local spin deviations",
    "we have calculated the one - hole spectral function for the whole range of magnetic couplings .    for the disordered background ( large @xmath7 ,",
    "gapped spin excitations ) spin fluctuations around the hole are suppressed .",
    "the hole motion is dominated by direct hopping processes , i.e. , hopping without disturbing the spin background . in the ordered phase for very small interplane coupling",
    "we recover the results known from the single - layer hole motion : the spectrum consists of a coherent qp peak at the bottom and an incoherent background .",
    "the qp can be associated with a mobile hole dressed by spin fluctuations .",
    "the bandwidth of its coherent motion is controlled by @xmath5 .",
    "the cross - over between these two scenarios occurs * inside * the ordered phase where the antiferromagnetic short - range correlations become weakened .",
    "the cross - over is located between @xmath237 depending on @xmath238 ( for @xmath239 it is found at @xmath185 ) .",
    "note that the cross - over can also be driven by variation of the hopping strength @xmath31 at a fixed value of @xmath7 well in the antiferromagnetic phase ( e.g. 1.3 ) .",
    "this behavior follows from the competition between direct nearest - neighbor hopping and spin - fluctuation - assisted next - nearest - neighbor hopping .",
    "in contrast , when crossing the magnetic phase boundary at @xmath240 there are no drastic changes in the spectrum ( and therefore in the arpes response of such a system ) . the only differences between the spectra in both phases near the phase transition are weak shadow bands in some regions of the brillouin zone in the af phase .",
    "note that our approximation which describes the hole motion processes in terms of short - range spin fluctuations is questionable in a region in the close vicinity of the phase transition due to the existence of long - ranged critical fluctuations .",
    "however , it has been argued recently@xcite that the influence of the critical modes suppresses the quasiparticle weight only in the limit of vanishing hopping @xmath241 . in contrast , for finite hopping the number of spin fluctuations near the hole remains finite even at the transition point .",
    "so we expect the picture presented in this paper to be valid at least in the regions away from the transition , i.e. , @xmath242 , which is supported by the fact that our spectral functions on both sides of the phase transition ( e.g. at @xmath243 and 2.7 ) do not show major differences .",
    "so the main result of the present paper can be summarized as follows : a magnetic phase transition has only weak influence on the arpes spectrum of a doped antiferromagnet .",
    "the properties of the spectrum are , however , dominated by the short - range environment of the hole .",
    "the statement is expected to hold also for the doping - induced phase transition in the single - layer af . here",
    "the antiferromagnetic correlations are strong even in the paramagnetic phase , i.e. , from the above considerations one expects to find an `` antiferromagnetic '' hole dispersion on both sides of the transition .",
    "this is exactly what was observed in recent work @xcite : analytical investigations of one hole in the af phase as well as numerical studies of finite systems ( which have a singlet ground state without long - range order ) both show a coherent hole motion with a dispersion of width @xmath244 and minima at @xmath2 .",
    "it should be pointed out that the above discussion applies to intermediate and high energy scales ( order @xmath235 , @xmath236 ) only .",
    "of course there exist low - energy properties of the spectrum which are expected to be influenced by quantum criticality , e.g. , the linewidth in a finite - temperature photoemission experiment should show scaling behavior in the quantum - critical region associated with the transition @xcite .",
    "these features as well as the hole dynamics in the bilayer system at low but finite doping are beyond the scope of the present study and will be subject of future research .",
