    "the detection limits of space infrared ( ir ) telescope systems are governed by instrumental , photon , and confusion noise sources .",
    "the instrumental noise is intrinsic to the detector and electronics system , e.g. , readout noise and dark current fluctuations .",
    "the photon noise is due to poissonian fluctuations in the photon counts from the sky background emission and the telescope thermal emission which can be reduced by decreasing the telescope temperature . on the other hand , the confusion noise is due to both the superposition of point sources in crowded fields and the brightness fluctuation of extended structures at scales of order of the telescope beam size . in the far - ir bands , due to the relatively large beam sizes ,",
    "astronomical observations are mostly affected by the sky confusion due to the galactic cirrus structure @xcite and the source confusion due to the unresolved extragalactic sources .",
    "though the confusion level is the unavoidable limit for the detection of faint point sources , the source structure below the confusion limit also creates background fluctuation in the observed image .",
    "this means that the source distribution can be obtained by measuring the background fluctuation which results from a convolution of the background sources and the telescope optics @xcite .",
    "after the successful infrared astronomy satellite mission ( _ iras _ ) @xcite , subsequent space ir telescopes such as the infrared space observatory ( _ iso _ ) @xcite and _ spitzer _",
    "@xcite , have increased the levels of sensitivity and spatial resolution at far - infrared wavelengths .",
    "in addition , the japanese _ akari _ ( formerly known as _ astro - f _ ) satellite was launched successfully on februrary 21st 2006 @xcite , and will perform an all sky survey in 4 far - ir bands with much improved sensitivities , spatial resolutions and wider wavelength coverage than the previous _ iras _ survey over two decades ago .",
    "moreover , within the next decade , the herschel space observatory ( _ herschel _ ) @xcite and the space infrared telescope for cosmology and astrophysics ( _ spica _ ) @xcite will observe the much deeper universe with large aperture sizes of 3.5 m. in our previous paper ( jeong et al .",
    "2005 , hereafter paper i ) , we numerically generated a high spatial resolution map of the galactic cirrus and investigated the effect of sky confusion for current and future space far - ir missions .",
    "in addition to the simulated sky confusion noise , this work includes realistic source confusion effects assuming various cosmological evolutionary scenarios .",
    "we also obtain the expected cosmic far - ir background ( cfirb ) .    the fluctuations in the surface brightness of extended structure on scales smaller than the resolution of the telescope / instrument beam can produce spurious events that can be easily mistaken for genuine point sources , since the existence of a source is usually simply derived from the difference in signal between the on source and some background ( off source ) position .",
    "such extended structure is observed in wispy neutral interstellar dust in the milky way that is heated by the interstellar radiation field and is known as the infrared cirrus  @xcite , and is one of the main noise sources in the far - ir range .",
    "cirrus emission peaks at far - ir wavelengths but was detected in all 4 _ iras _ bands",
    ". there have been realistic estimations of the sky confusion from observational data by _ iras _ and _ iso _ @xcite .",
    "the intensity of galactic cirrus is a function of galactic latitude and is serious for wavelengths longer than 60 @xmath0 m . using high resolution maps extended from currently available galactic emission maps ,",
    "we have estimated the sky confusion noise for various missions , based on fluctuation analysis and detailed photometry over realistically simulated images . in paper",
    "i , we concluded that the sky confusion is expected to be two orders of magnitude lower for the next generation of space missions with larger aperture sizes such as _ herschel _ and _ spica _ , but on the other hand , current 6090 cm aperture missions such as _ spitzer _ and _ akari _ , will have to endure a sky dominated by confusion noise at long wavelengths ( @xmath1 m ) . in this paper",
    ", we also discuss the composite effect of sky confusion and source confusion from the implementation of a realistic model for the source distribution .    note",
    "that additional components affecting the confusion noise are the presence of faint , unresolved , asteroids and the zodiacal light . though bright asteroids can be easily rejected via source confirmation between 2 pointings / scans over the same sky position",
    ", faint asteroids may contribute to fluctuations assumed to be from faint galaxies .",
    "although @xmath2brah@xmath3 m et al . found no such fluctuations on small scales from the isophot ( photometer on board the _ iso _ ) data , more sensitive instruments may detect them .",
    "thus , these two components may show a non - negligible contribution to the far - ir confusion near the ecliptic plane .",
    "this paper is structured as follows . in section [ sec : confused ] , we briefly describe the confusion noise due to sky brightness fluctuations and the source confusion due to extragalactic point sources .",
    "we present our source count models including galaxy evolution and the simulated images in section [ sec : models ] . based upon the specifications of each ir mission",
    ", we estimate the source confusion noise through fluctuation and photometric analyses in section [ sec : simulation ] .",
    "we present the expected results from our simulations in section [ sec : expected ] .",
    "our conclusions are summarised in section [ sec : conclusions ] .    throughout this work",
    "we assume a concordance cosmology of @xmath4 , @xmath5 = 0.3 , and @xmath6 = 0.7 , unless otherwise explicitly stated .",
    "the galaxy confusion limit is defined as the threshold of the fluctuations in the background sky brightness below which sources can not be discretely detected in the telescope beam @xmath7 @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the observation wavelength and @xmath10 is the telescope diameter .",
    "thus , the fluctuation noise arises from the same origin as the galaxies that one is aiming to detect .",
    "if we assume galaxies are distributed as a power law in flux , @xmath11 , down to some detection limit @xmath12 , @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the number of sources per unit solid angle with flux greater than @xmath11 , @xmath15 is the slope of the integral source counts ( where @xmath16 for a euclidean universe ) and @xmath17 is the number of sources brighter than @xmath12 per unit solid angle .",
    "assuming that the counts flatten at some faint flux , @xmath18 , i.e. @xmath19 , then the intensity of the background ( in jy / sr ) up to some maximum flux , @xmath20 , corresponding to these sources is given by , @xmath21 the fluctuations contributed by sources below the detection limit @xmath12 is given by the second moment of the differential source counts @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 assuming the power law distribution of sources given in equation ( [ counts ] ) , equation ( [ fluctuations ] ) can be evaluated to give @xmath25.\\ ] ] for the euclidean case , the dominant sources contributing to the background intensity are those just below the detection limit @xmath26  @xcite .",
    "however , the strong evolution detected in the galaxy population steepens the source counts and produces super euclidean slopes ( @xmath27 1.5 ) and the sources around the detection limit also contribute significantly to the fluctuations in the background intensity .",
    "rigorous theoretical definitions of confusion have been presented by scheuer and condon .",
    "hogg has highlighted more practical aspects of galaxy confusion noise .",
    "an analytical derivation broadly following franceschini et al .",
    "is given below .",
    "note that the clustering of sources will complicate the confusion noise [ e.g. , as in the case of radio sources , condon ] although here , for clarity , we do not treat this effect .",
    "some authors @xcite have investigated the effect of the clustering of sources on the confusion limit .",
    "they found that clustering possibly increases the level of the source confusion by 10% for _ akari _ mission @xcite and by 10 @xmath28 15% for _ spitzer _ and _ herschel _ missions @xcite in the far - ir range .    assuming that the sources are distributed randomly over the sky described by a power law form @xmath29 and a corresponding differential distribution given by @xmath30 where @xmath31 , the detector response to a source of flux @xmath11 , at a position @xmath32 from the axis of a detector beam of profile ( point spread function ) @xmath33 is given by @xmath34 .",
    "hence the mean number of responses with amplitudes between @xmath35 , @xmath36 in a solid angle @xmath37 is given by ; @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the solid angle of the beam in steradians .",
    "note that for the power law distribution of sources discussed above , equation ( [ responses1 ] ) can be rewritten as , @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the effective beam size  @xcite .",
    "taking the second moment of the @xmath42 distribution ( the variance ) gives the fluctuation of the response , @xmath43 ; @xmath44 where @xmath45 is a cut off response introduced to stop the variance from diverging at bright source fluxes .",
    "more practically the confusion limit @xmath45 ( corresponding to a cut off flux @xmath46 ) is set to some factor of the confusion noise such that @xmath47 , where the factor @xmath48 ( usually chosen values between 3 and 5 ) limits the largest response included in the evaluation of the confusion noise @xmath23 [ values of @xmath28 5 are assumed in the calculations of franceschini et al . ] .",
    "the difference in assuming a cut off in the response as opposed to a cut off in flux is that weak contributions from strong sources are not neglected , as even a strong source far from the axis of the beam may contribute significantly to the point spread function of the beam .",
    "assuming for clarity in the calculations , a circular gaussian beam profile , @xmath49 such that @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the beam , integrating equation ( [ noise ] ) over the solid angle of the beam gives ; @xmath52    or    @xmath53    where @xmath54 , effectively the power in the fluctuations , is given by , @xmath55 thus , the confusion limit can be directly related to the fwhm of the instrumental beam . for the simple power law representation of the distribution of extragalactic sources given previously and the definitions of equations ( [ responses1 ] ) and ( [ responses2 ] ) ,",
    "the confusion limit is given by , @xmath56 therefore , the confusion noise limit will be a complex function of the beam size @xmath51 , the source counts @xmath57 , the cut off in flux @xmath46 or response @xmath45 and the factor @xmath48 . for the assumed symmetric gaussian beam profile , @xmath58 .",
    "the confusion due to faint galaxies will be worse at longer wavelengths and smaller telescope diameters .",
    "since the confusion noise is related to the mean number of responses ( the source density ) and the cut off response @xmath59 , a useful , practical benchmark for the confusion limit can be set by limiting the number sources per beam before the beam becomes confused .",
    "ideally , the confusion limit would be determined by the flux at which the source density becomes 1 source per beam although more realistically a limit of between 1/20 - 1/50 sources per beam ( 20 - 50 beams per source ) is assumed [ e.g. , hogg ] . note that this difference is due to the contribution from faint sources undetected below a certain limit .",
    "many authors @xcite have described the source confusion due to extragalactic point sources and the sky confusion due to galactic cirrus as separate issues since most extragalactic surveys are limited to low background regions . however , in order to cover much larger survey areas , we also naturally have to include the medium - to - high background regions .",
    "in addition , since the cirrus structure covers both large and small scales , both of these contributions should be considered together . by using various source distributions and a realistically simulated cirrus background",
