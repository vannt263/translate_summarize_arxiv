    "given an interaction lagrangian characterized by a dimensionless coupling constant @xmath1 , one can usually guess whether perturbation theory can be used by comparing @xmath2 with unity .",
    "if it is much less than unity , there is a good chance that the perturbation technique could be used .",
    "effective chiral lagrangian gives on the other hand a power series expansion in momenta and hence the above rule can not be applied .",
    "it is important to set up a set of rules to test whether perturbation theory could be used .",
    "chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) @xcite is a well - defined perturbative procedure for the effective chiral lagrangian allowing one to calculate systematically low energy phenomenon involving soft pions .",
    "it is now widely used to analyze low energy pion physics even in the presence of resonance as long as the energy region of interest is sufficiently far from the resonance . in this scheme , the unitarity relation is satisfied perturbatively order by order .",
    "the standard procedure of testing chpt calculation of the pion form factor @xcite , which claims to support the perturbative scheme , is shown here to be unsatisfactory .",
    "this is so because the calculable terms are extremely small , less than 1.5% of the uncalculable terms at an energy of 0.5 gev or lower whereas the experimental errors are of the order 10 - 15% .",
    "this obvious fact escapes the attention of many due to the complexity of the calculations .",
    "we show how this situation can be dealt with without asking for a new measurement of the pion form factor with a precision much better than 1.5% .",
    "this can be done using dispersion relation which establishes in a model independent way a relation between the real and imaginary part of the amplitude .    from these results",
    ", we set up a procedure to test whether it is possible to use the perturbation technique for a given lagrangian .",
    "because the vector pion form factor @xmath3 is an analytic function with a cut from @xmath4 to @xmath5 , the @xmath6 times subtracted dispersion relation for @xmath3 reads : @xmath7 where @xmath8 and , for our purpose , the series around the origin is considered .",
    "because of the real analytic property of @xmath3 , it is real below @xmath4 . by taking the real part of this equation",
    ", @xmath9 is related to the principal part of the dispersion integral involving the @xmath10 apart from the subtraction constants @xmath11 .",
    "the polynomial on the r.h.s . of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ff1 ] ) will be referred in the following as the subtraction constants and the last term on the r.h.s . as the dispersion integral ( di ) .",
    "the evaluation of di as a funtion of @xmath12 will be done later . notice that @xmath13 is the coefficient of the taylor series expansion for @xmath3 , where @xmath14 is the nth derivative of @xmath3 evaluated at the origin .",
    "the condition for eq .",
    "( [ eq : ff1 ] ) to be valid was that , on the real positive s axis , the limit @xmath15 as @xmath16 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath17 of the taylor s series is given by : @xmath18 where @xmath19 .",
    "the meaning of this equation is clear : under the above stated assumption , not only the coefficient @xmath11 can be calculated but all other coefficients @xmath17 can also be calculated .",
    "the larger the value of @xmath20 , the more sensitive is the value of @xmath17 to the low energy values of @xmath10 . in theoretical work such as in chpt approach , to be discussed later , the number of subtraction is such that to make the di converges .",
    "the elastic unitarity relation for the pion form factor is @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the elastic p - wave pion pion phase shifts . below the inelastic threshold of @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the pion mass",
    ", @xmath3 must have the phase of @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "it is an experimental fact that below @xmath25 the inelastic effect is very small , hence , to a good approximation , the phase of @xmath3 is @xmath26 below this energy scale .",
    "@xmath27    and @xmath28    where @xmath26 is the strong elastic p - wave @xmath29 phase shifts .",
    "because the real and imaginary parts are related by dispersion relation , it is important to know accurately @xmath30 over a large energy region .",
    "below 1.3 gev , @xmath30 can be determined accurately because the modulus of the vector form factor @xcite and the corresponding p - wave @xmath29 phase shifts are well measured @xcite except at very low energy .",
    "it is possible to estimate the high energy contribution of the dispersion integral by fitting the asymptotic behavior of the form factor by the expression , @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the @xmath0 mass squared .    using eq .",
    "( [ eq : ieu ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq : reu ] ) , @xmath30 and @xmath9 are determined directly from experimental data and are shown , respectively , in fig.1 and fig.2 .",
    "in the following , for definiteness , one assumes @xmath33 as @xmath34 on the cut , i.e. @xmath3 does not grow as fast as a linear function of @xmath12 .",
    "this assumption is a very mild one because theoretical models assume that the form factor vanishes at infinite energy as @xmath35 . in this case , one can write a once subtracted dispersion relation for @xmath3 , i.e. one sets @xmath36 and @xmath37 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ff1 ] ) .    from this assumption on the asymptotic behavior of the form factor ,",
    "the derivatives of the form factor at @xmath38 are given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : an ] ) with n=1 and m=0 .",
    "in particular one has :    @xmath39    where the standard definition @xmath40 is used .",
    "eq.([eq : rms ] ) is a sum rule relating the pion rms radius to the magnitude of the time like pion form factor and the p - wave @xmath29 phase shift measurements . using these data ,",
    "the derivatives of the form factor are evaluated at the origin : @xmath41 where the upper limit of the integration is taken to be @xmath42 . by fitting @xmath10 by the above mentioned asymptotic expression ,",
    "the contribution beyond this upper limit is completely negligible .",
    "the only experimental data on the derivatives of the form factor at zero momentum transfer is the rms radius of the pion , @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "this value is very much in agreement with that determined from the sum rules .",
    "in fact the sum rule for the rms radius gets overwhelmingly contribution from the @xmath0 resonance as can be seen from fig.1 . the success of the calculation of the r.m.s .",
    "radius is a first indication that causality is respected and also that the extrapolation procedures to low energy for the p - wave @xmath29 phase shifts and for the modulus of the form factor are legitimate .",
    "dispersion relation for the pion form factor is now shown to be well verified by the data over a wide energy region . using @xmath30 as given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : ieu ] ) together with the once subtracted dispersion relation , one can calculate the real part of the form factor @xmath9 in the time - like region and also @xmath3 in the space like region .",
    "because the space - like behavior of the form factor is not sensitive to the calculation schemes , it will not be considered here .",
    "the result of this calculation is given in fig.2 .",
    "as it can be seen , dispersion relation results are well satisfied by the data .",
    "the i - loop chpt result can be put into the following form , similar to eq .",
    "( [ eq : ff1 ] ) : @xmath44 where @xmath45 subtraction constants are needed to make the last integral on the rhs of this equation converges and @xmath46 with @xmath47 calculated by the @xmath48 loop perturbation scheme .    similarly to these equations ,",
    "the corresponding experimental vector form factor @xmath49 and @xmath50 can be constructed using the same subtraction constants as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : peri ] ) but with the imaginary part replaced by @xmath51 , calculated using eq .",
    "( [ eq : ieu ] ) .",
    "the one - loop chpt calculation requires 2 subtraction constants . the first one is given by the ward identity , the second one is proportional to the r.m.s .",
    "radius of the pion .    in fig .",
    "1 , the imaginary part of the one - loop chpt calculation for the vector pion form factor is compared with the result of the imaginary part obtained from the experimental data . it is seen that they differ very much from each other .",
    "one expects therefore that the corresponding real parts calculated by dispersion relation should be quite different from each other .    in fig.2 the full real part of the one loop amplitude",
    "is compared with that obtained from experiment . at very low energy one can not distinguish the perturbative result from the experimental one due to the dominance of the subtraction constants . at an energy around @xmath52",
    "there is a definite difference between the perturbative result and the experimental data .",
    "this difference becomes much clearer in fig .",
    "3 where only the real part of the perturbative di , @xmath53 , is compared with the corresponding experimental quantity , @xmath54 .",
    "it is seen that even at 0.5 gev the discrepancy is clear .",
    "supporters of chpt would argue that chpt would not be expected to work at this energy .",
    "one would have to go to a lower energy where the data became very inaccurate .",
    "this argument is false as can be seen by comparing the ratio @xmath55 .",
    "it is seen in fig .",
    "4 that _ everywhere _ below 0.6 gev this ratio differs from unity by a factor of 6 - 7 due to the presence of non perturbative effects .",
    "similarly to the one - loop calculation , the two - loop results are plotted in fig .",
    "( 1 ) - fig .",
    "( 4 ) @xcite .",
    "although the two - loop result is better than the one - loop calculation , because more parameters are introduced , calculating higher loop effects will not explain the data because in chpt both the form factor and scattering amplitude which enter in the imaginary part calculation are dominated by a polynomial behavior .",
    "it is seen that perturbation theory is inadequate for the vector pion form factor even at very low momentum transfer .",
    "this fact is due to the very large value of the pion r.m.s . radius or a very low value of the @xmath0 mass ( see below ) .",
    "two unitarized models which are relevant are as follows .",
    "the first model is obtained by introducing a zero in the calculated form factor to get an agreement with the experimental r.m.s . radius .",
    "the pion form factor is now multiplied by @xmath56 where @xmath32 is the @xmath0 mass squared @xcite .",
    "the experimental data can be fitted with a @xmath0 mass equal to @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "these results are in excellent agreement with the data @xcite .    the second model , which is more complete at the expense of introducing more parameters , is based on the two - loop chpt calculation with unitarity taken into account .",
    "it has the singularity associated with the two loop graphs . using the same inverse amplitude method as was done with the one - loop amplitude , but generalizing this method to two - loop calculation",
    ", hannah has recently obtained a remarkable fit to the pion form factor in the time - like and space - like regions .",
    "his result is equivalent to the ( 0,2 ) pad approximant method as applied to the two - loop chpt calculation @xcite .",
    "both models contain ghosts which can be shown to be unimportant @xcite .    as can be seen from figs . 1 , 2 and 3 the imaginary and real parts of these two models are very much in agreement with the data .",
    "a small deviation of @xmath10 above @xmath59 is due to a small deviation of the phases of @xmath3 in these two models from the data of the p - wave @xmath29 phase shifts .",
    "let us examine in details the one - loop chpt calculation of the vector pion form factor @xmath3 @xcite :    @xmath60    where @xmath61 and the r.m.s .",
    "radius of the vector form factor is related to @xmath62 by the definition @xmath63 .",
    "the function @xmath64 is given by : @xmath65 for@xmath66 ; for other values of s , @xmath67 can be obtained by analytic continuation .    the unitarised version of eq . ( [ eq : pertv ] ) , obtained by the inverse amplitude , the pad approximant or the n / d methods , is given by @xcite : @xmath68    it is obvious that eq .",
    "( [ eq : vu ] ) has the breit - wigner resonance character while that from eq .",
    "( [ eq : pertv ] ) does not , although their amplitude and first derivative are identical at @xmath38 .",
    "furthermore , if the parameter @xmath69 was fixed by the the r.m.s .",
    "radius , the @xmath0 mass squared , @xmath32 , would come out to be slightly low compared measured @xmath0 mass . neglecting this last problem which is unimportant here",
    ", the taylor s series expansion around @xmath38 reveals that eq .",
    "( [ eq : vu ] ) gives rise to a coefficient of the @xmath70 term as @xmath71 which is much larger than that coming from the third term of eq .",
    "( [ eq : pertv ] ) , @xmath72 .",
    "this is the signal of the failure of the perturbation method .",
    "in other words , chpt should work if the r.m.s .",
    "radius is much smaller than its experimental value or @xmath73 .",
    "this last condition means that the physical @xmath0 mass is far too small for the perturbation theory to be valid",
    ".    we can generalize our criteria for the validity of the perturbation method to the nth loop result .",
    "for this purpose we have to add one more step in our calculation in order to make it free from criticisms : eq .",
    "( [ eq : vu ] ) could in principle contain unwanted poles due to the unitarisation procedure .",
    "this can be eliminated by subtracting out the ghost pole which can be conveniently done by writing down a dispersion relation for @xmath3 with the same subtraction constants as used in the perturbative series eq .",
    "( [ eq : pertv ] ) , but with the imaginary part given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : vu ] ) @xcite .",
    "provided that the ghost removing procedure did not change very much the unitarised amplitude , one could then compare the perturbative calculation with the modified unitarized result .",
    "if their difference was negligible , one could be sure that the perturbative scheme could then be used .",
    "because the calculable quantities of the vector pion form factor in the chpt scheme are too small ( well within experimental errors ) compared with the uncalculable ones , unless some unitarisation is made , it may be better to give up this perturbative scheme .",
    "one would then gain in the transparency of the physics .",
    "although we have not made here a detailed study of the processes @xmath74 the loop contributions can be shown to be completely negligible compared with the subtracted terms and are therefore not relevant .    in conclusion ,",
    "higher loop perturbative calculations do not solve the unitarity problem .",
    "the perturbative scheme has to be supplemented by the well - known unitarisation schemes such as the inverse amplitude , n / d and pad approximant methods @xcite .      for a review , see j. f. donoghue , e. golowich and b. r. holstein , _ dynamics of the standard model _ ( cambridge univ . press , cambridge , 1992 ) .",
