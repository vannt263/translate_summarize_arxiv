    "there has been an ever - increasing interest in casimir forces during the past half - century.[1 ]  what began as an obscure phenomenon in electrodynamics[2 ] has became of general theoretical interest in quantum field theory[3 ] , has been connected to wave phenomena in acoustics[4 ] and boating,[5 ] and is now of technological concern in connection with microelectromechanical devices.[6 ]  in particular , there have been accurate experimental measurements of electromagnetic casimir forces[7 ] and suggestions that such forces will create a `` stiction '' which will bind surfaces together at small separations .  in order to overcome such stiction , the repulsive aspects of casimir forces have recently been reinvestigated.[8 ]  in this article we review some aspects of thermodynamic casimir forces and energies in a simple model system allowing extraction of the essential physics with a minimum of mathematical complexity .    our work presents simple examples of physical aspects of casimir forces in one spatial dimension .",
    "we begin with an example of positive and negative casimir energies at zero - temperature in connection with changes in wave boundary conditions .",
    "next we give examples of the natural maximum - entropy principle for thermal radiation leading to the planck spectrum , noting that the result indeed holds for the repulsive case , as was shown earlier for the attractive case .",
    "then we give examples of the attractive and repulsive casimir forces due to thermal radiation at finite temperature .",
    "in one spatial dimension , we find that whereas the attractive force increases with increasing temperature , the repulsive force diminishes to zero with increasing temperature .",
    "finally , we consider the entropy changes of the wave system and note the temperature - independent casimir entropy which arises in the attractive but not the repulsive case at high temperature .",
    "some of these aspects of casimir forces already appear in the literature for more complicated systems demanding more elaborate mathematical calculation .",
    "the examples illustrate the variety of behaviors encountered for different boundary conditions .",
    "casimir forces are those arising from the discrete normal mode structure of a wave system .",
    "thus if we consider random radiation in a box , the introduction of a partition will change the normal mode structure of the box and so lead to changes in forces and energies .",
    "the changes of these forces and energies associated with the placement of the partition are termed casimir energies .",
    "the nature of these casimir forces and energies will depend upon the energy spectrum of the waves , upon the number of spatial dimensions , and upon the boundary conditions at the partition and walls of the box .     in this article we will consider thermodynamic casimir forces in one space dimension .",
    "thus we may imagine waves on a string between two supports , or electromagnetic waves all of whose wave vectors point in a single direction perpendicular to the cavity walls .  furthermore , the energy spectrum of the radiation is not taken arbitrarily[9 ] but rather is assumed to correspond to thermodynamic equilibrium and so to satisfy the wien displacement theorem .",
    "accordingly , the average energy @xmath0 per normal mode is related to the angular frequency @xmath1 and temperature @xmath2 by[10 ] @xmath3 where the thermodynamic potential[11 ] @xmath4 is a function of the single variable @xmath5 .",
    "of course , the analysis given here can be extended easily to more general energy spectra .",
    "wien s displacement theorem for thermal radiation allows two extremes where the energy @xmath6 per normal mode is independent of one of its two variables .",
    "if the derivative of the thermodynamic potential is a constant @xmath7 , then @xmath8 corresponding to the familiar zero - point energy where the constant is chosen as related to planck s constant , @xmath9  on the other hand , if the derivative of the thermodynamic potential is equal to the inverse of its argument @xmath10 , then we find the familiar energy equipartition result @xmath11 where the constant is chosen as boltzmann s constant , @xmath12      at zero temperature @xmath13 , a one - dimensional box of length @xmath14 contains the zero - point energy @xmath15 where the sum is over all normal modes of wave oscillation .",
    "if a partition is introduced at @xmath16 into the box of length @xmath14 , then the casimir energy is the change of energy @xmath17 when the partition is at distance @xmath16 from one of the ends compared to when it is in the middle of the box is @xmath18\\ ] ] where we have summed over all the energies on both sides of the partition for the two cases .",
    "realistic systems will not enforce the boundary conditions at very small wavelengths so that these sums should actually involve only a finite number of waves .",
    "it is natural to imagine a smooth cut - off function @xmath19 dependent upon wavelength @xmath20 of the form @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the wave speed .",
    "one example is @xmath23 .",
    "the energy sums in ( 5 )  are evaluated for a finite cut - off @xmath20 , and then the cut - off is taken to zero to remove the dependence upon the cut - off .",
    "it turns out that the energy found in this limit is independent of the the choice of the smooth cut - off function @xmath19.[12 ]  provided that the boundary conditions are enforced down to some wavelength @xmath20 smaller than any of the dimensions of the system , the cut - off result for finite @xmath20 will agree with the no - cut - off limit @xmath24 .    for casimir forces in nature due to electromagnetic fields where we wish to avoid the details of the interaction with the walls",
    ", it is natural to choose either perfectly - conducting boundary conditions or else infinitely - permeable boundary conditions.[13 ]  in one spatial dimension , these correspond to dirichlet or neumann boundary conditions analogous to a fixed or free end of a string.[14 ]  if we imagine the partition to enforce the same boundary conditions as the walls ( e.g. , both partition and walls are good conductors @xmath25 fixed ends ) , then the normal modes on a string of length @xmath14 will have wave numbers @xmath26 , @xmath27  on the other hand , if the partition enforces the opposite boundary conditions from the walls ( e.g. , a highly permeable partition and good conducting walls @xmath25 free end and fixed end ) ,  then the normal modes on a string of length @xmath14 have wave numbers @xmath28 , @xmath29 .",
    "we can discuss both cases at once by writing @xmath30 where @xmath31 for like boundary conditions for partition and walls , and @xmath32 for unlike boundary conditions .",
    "the casimir energy at zero - temperature can be calculated easily by using an exponential cut - off function and summing the geometric series , @xmath33@xmath34@xmath35   \\right\\}\\]]@xmath36   + \\right.\\]]@xmath37   \\right.\\]]@xmath38   \\right\\}\\]]@xmath39 thus for partition and walls which enforce like boundary conditions ( either both dirichlet or both neumann ) , the parameter @xmath40 takes the value @xmath31 , and the casimir energy at zero temperature is negative @xmath41 giving an attractive force .  on the other hand , for partition and walls which enforce unlike boundary conditions , one dirichlet and one neumann , @xmath32 and",
    "the casimir energy is positive @xmath42 giving a repulsive force .",
    "exactly the analogous situation is found for the electromagnetic casimir forces between two parallel conducting plates or between two permeable plates , or between a conducting plate and a permeable plate .",
    "the original 1948 calculation by casimir[2 ] involved two conducting plates , and the result has been recalculated from many points of view.[1 ]  the force between a conducting plate and a permeable plate was given[13 ] in 1974 and has been recalculated several times recently.[15 ]      the zero - point - energy limit of wien s law leads to the casimir energies given in ( 7 ) and ( 8) .",
    "it is also of interest to obtain the casimir energies for the energy - equipartition limit of wien s law .",
    "this corresponds to the rayleigh - jeans spectrum of radiation .",
    "the casimir energies again take the form given in ( 5 ) , but this time with the energy per normal mode in ( 3 ) .",
    "once again the calculation can easily be carried through analytically for both like and unlike boundary conditions , @xmath43@xmath44@xmath45@xmath46@xmath47   + k_{b}t\\left [   \\frac { l - x}{\\lambda\\pi}+\\frac{1}{2}(\\alpha-1)+\\frac{\\pi\\lambda}{(l - x)}c- ... \\right ] + \\right.\\]]@xmath48   \\right\\ }   = 0\\ ] ] in both cases , like or unlike boundary conditions , the rayleigh - jeans spectrum gives no change in the casimir energy .",
    "indeed , the equipartition rayleigh - jeans spectrum is the unique spectrum which produces no casimir energy changes associated with the placement of the casimir partition , @xmath49 , no matter whether the partition enforces the same boundary conditions as the walls or the opposite boundary conditions .",
    "the vanishing changes in casimir energies for the rayleigh - jeans spectrum found here in ( 9 ) agrees with the work of revzen , opher , opher , and mann[16 ] for the case of two parallel conducting plates and with the work of da silva , matos neto , placido , revzen , and santana[17 ] for the case of two parallel plates , one of which is conducting and one of which is permeable .",
    "it has been pointed out recently that casimir forces and zero - point radiation allow the derivation of the planck spectrum as the unique radiation spectrum giving minimum casimir energy changes over an ensemble of containers with partitions spaced uniformly across the volume.[18 ]  the result has been submitted for publication in the case of one - dimensional casimir energies and has been suggested in the electromagnetic case for a three - dimensional box , both cases assuming dirichlet boundary conditions .",
    "the same energies are involved for neumann boundary conditions .  here",
    "we note that the result holds also for mixed boundary conditions in the case of one - dimensional waves .",
    "we consider an ensemble of one - dimensional boxes of length @xmath14 with partitions placed at different locations @xmath16 in the boxes so as to give uniform spacing across the entire ensemble .",
    "if each of these boxes contains radiation at thermal equilibrium at the same temperature @xmath2 , then the boxes will still have different average energies corresponding to different casimir energies relating to the differing placements of their partitions .  just as it is natural to suggest that maximum particle entropy involves a uniform distribution of particles across the volume of a box , it is natural to suggest that maximum radiation entropy involves the least possible variation in casimir energies across the ensemble of boxes .",
    "thus we are looking for that spectrum of random radiation which satisfies the wien displacement theorem ( and therefore has energy per normal mode @xmath50 per normal mode at low frequency and @xmath51 at high frequency ) which gives a minimum for the sum of the absolute values of the casimir energies taken across the ensemble of boxes , @xmath52  this condition can be converted to the minimum for an integral@xmath53 where @xmath54 is a fixed small cut - off distance .",
    "the fixed distance @xmath54 is chosen much smaller than any distance of interest in the situation ; it is required by the divergence of the casimir energy at small separations .",
    "the integrand in ( 11 ) can be evaluated numerically for various suggested radiation spectra which provide smooth interpolations between @xmath50 at low frequency and @xmath51 at high frequency .",
    "indeed one can assume various functional forms and then vary the parameters to provide the smallest value for the integral ( 11 ) .",
    "for example , if one introduces parameters @xmath55 and @xmath56 into the functional form @xmath57}{1-\\exp[-c_{1}(\\omega",
    "/ t)]}+(1/2)\\omega\\ ] ] then this provides a smooth interpolation of the required form for every positive value of @xmath55 and @xmath56 .  by numerical calculation for both like and unlike boundary conditions , it is found that the values of @xmath55 and @xmath56 which provide the smallest integral @xmath58 in ( 11 ) are @xmath59 and @xmath60 , corresponding to exactly the planck spectrum with zero - point energy@xmath61}{1-\\exp[-(\\omega / t)]}+\\frac{1}{2}\\omega=\\frac{\\omega}{\\exp(\\omega /t)-1}+\\frac{1}{2}\\omega=\\frac{1}{2}\\omega\\coth\\left (   \\frac{1}{2}\\frac { \\omega}{t}\\right)\\ ] ] where for the numerical evaluation we have set @xmath62 .",
    "the case of like boundary conditions where the normal modes of the wave field are @xmath26 , @xmath63 was calculated earlier and submitted for publication.[18 ]  the case of unlike boundary conditions where the normal modes of the field are @xmath28 has now been completed and is found by numerical calculation to lead to the planck law as the spectrum providing a minimum for the integral @xmath58 in ( 11 ) .",
    "for this case and for all spectra which have been tested , the planck spectrum with zero - point radiation gave a smaller integral in ( 11 ) .",
    "an idea of what is involved can be seen in the figs 1 , 2 , and 3 .  in fig . 1",
    ", we plot the energy per normal mode @xmath6 versus frequency @xmath1 for zero - point radiation , for the rayleigh - jeans spectrum , and for the planck spectrum with zero - point radiation at two different temperatures .",
    "we note how smoothly the planck spectrum interpolates between the equipartition behavior at low frequency and zero - point energy at high frequency .",
    "figures 2 and 3 give the casimir energies in a one - dimensional box with a partition at location @xmath16 for these same radiation spectra .  in figure 2 ( like boundary conditions )",
    ", the partition has the same boundary conditions as the walls of the box , while in figure 3 ( unlike boundary conditions ) , the partition has opposite boundary conditions from the walls .",
    "thus we see the negative zero - point casimir energy ( 7 ) in fig . 2 and the positive zero - point casimir energy ( 8) in figure 3 .",
    "the rayleigh - jeans spectrum gives zero casimir energies ( 9 ) for both cases .",
    "the planck spectrum with zero - point energy provides a smooth interpolating casimir energy between these two extremes .",
    "one should notice how the planck spectrum with zero - point energy hugs the axis of both the figures 3 and 4 before leaving the axis to join the zero - point curve at small separations @xmath16 .",
    "this hugging - the - axis corresponds to small casimir energies and accounts for the minimum behavior of the test integral in ( 11 ) .",
    "it is easy to graph the casimir energies for other interpolating spectra .",
    "one finds that other interpolating spectra satisfying the wien displacement law do not hug the axis nearly so closely and therefore do not give a minimum for the test integral ( 11).[19 ]    we note that in both these cases , the presence of zero - point radiation is absolutely necessary .  in the absence of zero - point radiation , there would be no non - zero minimum for the integral @xmath58 ; rather the energy would diverge to the rayleigh - jeans spectrum where the casimir energies vanish for both like and unlike boundary conditions .",
    "it is precisely the presence of zero - point radiation which prevents the familiar `` ultraviolet catastrophe '' for thermal radiation .",
    "at zero temperature , the casimir forces @xmath64 on a partition can be obtained by using the casimir energies in ( 7 ) and ( 8) as potential functions@xmath65 accordingly , we find the attractive force @xmath66 for the case of like boundary conditions ( @xmath31 ) , and the repulsive force@xmath67 for the case of unlike boundary conditions ( @xmath32 ) .    at finite temperature @xmath2 , it is the derivative of the change in the helmholtz free energy @xmath68 which gives the force on the partition .",
    "the helmholtz free energy @xmath69 per wave normal mode in the case of the planck spectrum with zero - point radiation is given by @xmath70   = \\frac{1}{2}\\hbar\\omega+k_{b}t\\ln\\left [ 1-\\exp\\left (   \\frac{-\\hbar\\omega}{k_{b}t}\\right )   \\right]\\ ] ] the helmholtz free energy in a box is found by summing the helmholtz free energies of the radiation modes @xmath71 and the change in the helmholtz free energy due to a change in the position of a partition in the box is @xmath72 because of the zero - point energy , the change in helmholtz free energy for the planck spectrum with zero - point radiation requires the use of a temporary cut off as for our calculation in eq .",
    "( 6 ) .  for numerical evaluation",
    ", one may separate out the divergent zero - point energy contribution @xmath73 and deal with the convergent thermal part @xmath74 .  the zero - point helmholtz free energy @xmath73 is identical to the zero - point energy @xmath75 given in ( 6 ) .",
    "however , rather than dealing with the total helmholtz free energy @xmath76 as a potential function for forces , it seems easier to sum the forces due to the individual normal modes .",
    "the force @xmath77 on the boundary due to a single normal mode in a box is given by the derivative of the helmholtz free energy of the normal mode in ( 17)@xmath78 then the force @xmath79 on a partition at @xmath16 due to all the modes is @xmath80\\ ] ] where once again we can include both sets of boundary conditions by including the parameter @xmath40 in the normal modes in ( 21 ) .  for the planck spectrum with zero - point radiation used in ( 20 )",
    ", this sum can be easily evaluated in closed form for the limits of zero - point radiation ( which gives just @xmath81 above in ( 15 ) and ( 16 ) ) or for the high - temperature limit of the rayleigh - jeans spectrum .  for finite temperatures ,",
    "the force can easily be evaluated numerically ; we separate off the zero - point contribution and are left with a convergent sum in ( 21 ) .     in the case of the high - temperature equipartition limit corresponding to the rayleigh - jeans law ,",
    "the force in ( 20 ) due to a single normal mode becomes independent of @xmath1,@xmath82 therefore the sum over all the normal modes in ( 21 ) now involves the difference of two divergent sums .",
    "accordingly , we temporarily introduce a smooth frequency - dependent cut - off function dependent upon the cut - off parameter @xmath20 , and take the net force as the result when @xmath83,@xmath84 @xmath85 once again we are dealing with a geometric series which can be summed easily to give@xmath86   + \\right.\\ ] ] @xmath87   \\right\\}\\]]@xmath88 thus at high temperatures for like boundary conditions where @xmath31 , there is a force attracting a partition to one of the walls @xmath89 we notice that this force , which arises from the discrete classical normal mode structure of the box , involves a different power of length from the zero - point force in ( 15 ) , but both are significant only if @xmath16 or @xmath90 is small .  on the other hand , in one dimension for unlike boundary conditions where @xmath32 , the net force on the partition in ( 24 ) vanishes entirely @xmath91 in the high - temperature rayleigh - jeans limit .",
    "the results for the casimir forces on a partition in one space dimension are shown in figures 4 and 5 for like and unlike boundary conditions respectively .  in the case of like boundary conditions shown in fig .",
    "4 , the casimir force is attractive at all separations and increases steadily as the temperature increases .  in the case of unlike boundary conditions shown in fig . 5",
    ", the casimir force is repulsive at low temperatures for fixed displacement @xmath16 , but then goes to zero as the temperature increases .  in the limit of high temperature ,",
    "both force curves go over to the results given by the rayleigh - jeans limit .",
    "we should emphasize that the appearance of attractive or repulsive casimir forces at zero temperature is not intuitively clear ; changes in boundary conditions or shape or spatial dimension all seem involved.[1 ]  also , there seems to be some disagreement regarding the detailed temperature dependence of casimir forces for like boundary conditions , though only increasingly attractive forces with increasing temperature seem to be expected , just as seen in fig .",
    "4.[20 ]  in the case of repulsive forces involving mixed boundary conditions , the one - dimensional result in fig .",
    "5 involving diminishing repulsion with increasing temperature agrees with the behavior found by ferrer and grifols[21 ] for the repulsive casimir - polder force involving the electric polarizability of one particle and the magnetic polarizability of another.[22 ]  however , it is qualitatively different from the increasing repulsion with temperature found by da silva , matos neto , placido , revzen , and santana for the high - temperature limit of two parallel plates one of which is a conductor and the other of which is highly permeable.[17 ]",
    "in addition to the surprising sign reversals found for casimir forces and energies , and to the natural connection of casimir energies with the planck spectrum , there is an entropy aspect of the casimir forces which seems curious .",
    "the casimir entropy is the change in entropy of a wave system depending upon the placement of the system partition .",
    "the entropy @xmath92 of radiation in a box is the sum over modes for the entropy  @xmath93  of a normal mode which follows from the thermodynamic potential @xmath94 as@xmath95 accordingly , the casimir entropy change @xmath96 in a box of length @xmath14 at temperature @xmath2 due to a partition at @xmath16 , is given by @xmath97 for the planck spectrum@xmath98   + \\frac{\\hbar\\omega}{2k_{b}t}% \\coth\\left (   \\frac{\\hbar\\omega}{2k_{b}t}\\right)\\ ] ] the entropy changes for the case of like boundary conditions are given in fig .",
    "6 , and those for unlike boundary conditions are given in fig .",
    "it is curious that in the case of like boundary conditions shown in fig .",
    "6 , there is clearly a non - zero , temperature - independent limit for the casimir entropy @xmath96 at high temperature , whereas in the case of unlike boundary conditons shown in fig .",
    "7 there is not .      for fixed frequency @xmath1 and increasing temperature @xmath2 ,",
    "the planck spectrum with zero - point radiation goes over to the rayleigh - jeans spectrum .",
    "similarly , for fixed length @xmath16 and increasing temperature @xmath2 the casimir energy @xmath99 for the planck spectrum with zero - point radiation goes over to the rayleigh - jeans result @xmath100 .",
    "however , the net force @xmath101  and the net change in entropy @xmath102 do not necessarily go to zero with increasing temperature .",
    "indeed , these quantities go over to the values for the rayleigh - jeans spectrum , which values need not vanish . thus at high temperature , casimir forces are associated with changes in system entropy , not the vanishing changes in system energy .",
    "applying thermodynamic analysis to a partitioned one - dimensional box of radiation with a rayleigh - jeans spectrum at temperature @xmath103 an isothermal change of the the position of the partition gives no change in system energy but involves heat added so that @xmath104 then using the casimir force ( 25 ) associated with the rayleigh - jeans spectrum and like boundary conditions , @xmath105 and @xmath106 we emphasize that the right - hand side of eq.(31 ) is independent of temperature @xmath2 .",
    "thus due to the normal mode structure of the box , there is a temperature - independent change of entropy when the partition is moved .",
    "this seems reminiscent of the temperature - independent change associated with mixing entropy for ideal gas particles .",
    "this same result ( 31 ) can be obtained by summing the rayleigh - jeans entropy @xmath107 per normal mode over the normal modes of the box when using a cut - off function , subtracting , and allowing the cut - off to disappear .",
    "the casimir entropy change @xmath108 associated with the planck spectrum ( and involving convergent sums ) goes to the rayleigh - jeans limit ( 31 ) at high temperature for fixed values of @xmath16 and @xmath14 .",
    "however , for fixed finite temperature @xmath2 , the entropy change @xmath102 for the planck spectrum goes to a finite temperature - dependent limit as @xmath16 goes to @xmath109 or @xmath14 , as seen in fig .",
    "the casimir entropy for unlike boundary conditions is seen in fig . 7",
    "to first increase from zero for increasing temperature and then to decrease back to zero for additional increase of temperature for fixed partition - coordinate x.  thus in one dimension for unlike boundary conditions , there is no non - vanishing temperature - independent casimir entropy in the high - temperature limit .",
    "we note that for the rayleigh - jeans spectrum , there is no casimir energy @xmath110 and , for unlike boundary conditions in one dimension , no casimir force @xmath111 .",
    "accordingly , the first law of thermodynamics in ( 29 ) indicates that the casimir entropy vanishes for the rayleigh - jeans spectrum and unlike boundary conditions .",
    "the existence of temperature - independent casimir entropy seems to depend sensitively on both the boundary conditions and dimension .",
    "the existence of a geometrical temperature - independent casimir entropy for like boundary conditions as given in ( 31 ) agrees with the result reported by revzen , opher , opher and mann for the case of two conducting parallel plates.[23 ]  however , the absence of such an entropy for unlike boundary conditions is in contrast to the temperature - independent casimir entropy reported by da silva , matos neto , pacido , revzen , and santana for the case two parallel plates , one of which is conducting and one of which is highly permeable.[17 ]",
    "the the introduction of a partition into a wave system leads to changes in energies , forces , and thermodynamic variables associated with the wave boundary conditions at the partition and the walls .  for electromagnetic waves ,",
    "these casimir forces are termed `` dispersion forces '' or `` van der waals forces . ''",
    "although physicists usually think of van der waals forces as attractive , the type of analysis introduced originally by casimir suggests the possibility of repulsive forces .",
    "several aspects of casimir forces can be easily illustrated by a mathematical model involving waves in one space dimension .",
    "depending upon the boundary conditions , a partition introduced into a one - dimensional box will experience attraction to or repulsion form the walls at zero temperature .  the attractive force becomes increasingly attractive with increasing temperature whereas the repulsive force diminishes with increasing temperature .",
    "also , there are changes in entropy associated with changes in position for the partition .  for high temperatures ,",
    "these entropy changes become temperature independent in the attractive case ( rather like a wave form of mixing entropy ) but vanish in the repulsive case .",
    "finally , we note that casimir energies are closely related to the thermodynamics of blackbody radiation , allowing a derivation of the planck spectrum from a natural maximum - entropy principle .",
    "i would like to thank professor daniel c. cole for sending me annotated copies of the work on repulsive casimir forces by e. buks and m. l. roukes , and by o. kenneth , i. klich , a .. mann , and m. revzen .",
