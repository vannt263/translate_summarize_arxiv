    "in order to test the wide - band imaging capabilities of the evla , we have observed several known and possible galactic supernova remnants ( snrs ) .",
    "there are 274 galactic snrs catalogued @xcite , the majority of which are classified as ` shell ' remnants , showing limb - brightened synchrotron radio emission , typically with @xmath1 .",
    "some snrs are classed as ` filled - center ' remnants ( or ` plerions ' ) , as they show emission at radio wavelengths that is brightest in the center , due to the power input from a central pulsar .",
    "these filled - center remnants generally have much flatter radio spectra at ghz - frequencies , with @xmath2 . finally , there are some remnants that are classed as composite remnants , as they show a mixture of limb - brightened shell - like emission , with a filled - center - like core ( i.e. ,  a pulsar wind nebula ) showing a much flatter spectrum .",
    "in addition to the known remnants , there are many other possible and probable galactic snrs that have been proposed , for which additional observations are needed to confirm their nature . in many regions of the galactic plane ,",
    "particularly near to @xmath3 and @xmath4 , radio emission from snrs is easily confused with thermal radio emission ( typically with @xmath5 ) from hii regions .",
    "the wide - band of the evla allows a variety of spectral studies of snrs to be made , in order to : ( 1 ) investigate spectral variations across the face of shell remnants , in order to study the differences in the shock acceleration mechanism at work in different regions of the remnants ; ( 2 ) study the flat spectrum cores of composite remnants ; and ( 3 ) clarify the nature of proposed possible snrs , by disentangling the non - thermal synchrotron emission from confusing thermal emission .",
    "we have observed two smaller known remnants g16.7@xmath60.1 and g21.5@xmath70.9 .",
    "g16.7@xmath60.1 is a ` composite ' remnant , @xmath8 across ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "g21.5@xmath70.9 was classed as a filled - center remnant , only @xmath9 in extent , until a faint x - ray shell @xmath10 in diameter was identified by @xcite .",
    "since then it has been classed as a composite remnant , although a radio counterpart to the x - ray shell has not been identified ( see @xcite ) .",
    "g21.5@xmath70.9 contains a pulsar , which has a high spin - down luminosity ( @xcite ) .",
    "we also observed a field centered at @xmath11 , @xmath12 , which contains ` high - probability ' snr candidate , g19.66@xmath70.22 , identified by @xcite .",
    "finally , we observed one larger known but poorly studied shell remnant , g55.7@xmath63.4 , which is @xmath13  arcmin@xmath14 in extent ( see @xcite ) .",
    "an old , probably unrelated pulsar lies within the northern edge of this remnant .",
    "the observations were made using the evla in d - array .",
    "the _ l_-band observations used the full 1  ghz bandwidth covering the frequency range of @xmath15  ghz .",
    "c_-band observations used 2  ghz bandwidth in two separate @xmath16  ghz bands .",
    "the observations parameters for all the fields are listed in table  [ tab : obsparams ] . at the time of observations ,",
    "not all antennas in the array were outfitted with the new _ l_- and _ c_-band receivers . due to this and other failures during the commissioning phase of the evla ,",
    "typically 20 antennas were used for these observations .",
    "l_-band data was recorded in 8 or 16 spectral windows ( spw ) at a frequency resolution of 2 and 1  mhz respectively with an integration time of 1  s. the _ c_-band data was recorded in 16 spws at a resolution of 2  mhz .",
    "high time and frequency resolution was required to allow effective removal of radio frequency interference ( rfi ) , accurate bandpass calibration and corrections for wideband group delay present in the data from evla widar correlator . to reduce the data volume , after initial data flagging the data were averaged to 10  s resolution in time .",
    "the standard flux calibrators 3c286 and 3c147 were observed for flux calibration and the compact sources j1822@xmath70938 ( for g16.7@xmath60.1 , g19.6@xmath70.2 and g21.5@xmath70.9 ) and j1925@xmath62106 ( for g55.7@xmath63.4 ) were observed at intervals of 30  min for phase and bandpass calibration . using known frequency dependent model for the flux calibrators ( including spectral index ) antenna gains for each frequency channel across the observed bandwidth",
    "were determined for flux and group delay calibration .",
    "the antenna gains for each spw were also determined using the phase calibraters . in order to account for the spectral index of the calibraters , a model including the frequency dependent flux",
    "was determined using the multi - scale multi - frequency synthesis ( ms - mfs ) imaging algorithm which simultaneously makes stokes-_i _ and spectral index maps .",
    "the final complex bandpass shape was determined using this model and applied to the data for the target fields .",
    "this calibration procedure allowed calibration of time - varying direction independent gains without transferring the effects of the frequency dependent flux of the calibraters to the target fields .",
    "rfi affected frequency channels were flagged throughout the observing band .",
    "full spws covering the frequency range @xmath17  ghz had to be dropped due to the presence of strong rfi at _ l_-band .",
    "ten channels at the edges of the spws were also flagged due to the roll - off of the digital filters in the signal chain .",
    "the rest of the frequency channels were used for wide - band imaging .",
    "conventional image reconstruction techniques for interferometric imaging fundamentally models the brightness distribution as a collection of scaleless components ( amplitude per pixel ) leaving errors which limit the imaging performance .",
    "scale - sensitive methods @xcite significantly reduce the magnitude of such errors by explicitly solving for the scale size of emission across the field of view .",
    "imaging performance using wide - band interferometric observations of fields with extended emission is additionally limited by the fact that not only does the scale of emission vary across the field of view , the spectral properties also vary across the field .",
    "the dominant source of these spectral variations is the change of antenna primary beam with frequency and spatial dependence of the spectral index of the radio emission .",
    "both effects result in variation of the strength of emission as a function of frequency in a direction dependent manner .",
    "furthermore , antenna primary beams are typically rotationally asymmetric which result in time - varying gains due to the rotation of the primary beams with parallactic angle for el - az mount antennas .",
    "scale - sensitive imaging reconstruction algorithms that can also _ simultaneously _ account for time and frequency - dependent effects are therefore required for wide - band wide - field imaging with the evla , particularly in the galactic plane . for this , two new algorithms , namely the ms - mfs @xcite and the a - projection @xcite algorithm , have been developed .",
    "the ms - mfs algorithm combines the scale - sensitive deconvolution with explicit frequency dependent modeling of the emission to map the spatial distribution of the spectral index in a scale - sensitive manner .",
    "the a - projection algorithm on the other hand corrects for the time and frequency dependence of the antenna primary beams as part of the iterative image reconstruction .",
    "we used the ms - mfs @xcite algorithm implemented in the @xmath18 post - processing package , for wide - band imaging .",
    "the spectral index information derived using the traditional method of using images made at different frequencies make spectral index images at the _ lowest _ resolution and at the sensitivity of _ single _ channel bandwidth .",
    "spectral index images made using the ms - mfs algorithm on the other hand does not require smoothing the images to the lowest resolution and produces the spectral index images at the full sensitivity and resolution offered by the data . this must be combined with techniques to correct for various time variable pb - effects during image deconvolution to achieve noise limited imaging performance . while the a - projection algorithm can be used to correct for these pb - effects during image deconvolution , for the images presented here we used only the time - averaged pbs ( see figure  [ fig : avgpb ] ) to apply correction post deconvolution .",
    "work towards a fully integrated wide - field wide - band imaging algorithms is in progress .",

    "l_-band and _ c_-band , the galaxy is replete with compact and diffuse emission of both thermal and non - thermal origin .",
    "sources often have a mixture of thermal and non - thermal emission , resulting in spectral indices that vary with position across a given source and with spatial scale . conventional imaging algorithms that rely on multiple narrow - band images to derive spectral - index information",
    "are limited to the angular resolution allowed by the lowest measured frequency , and the single - channel sensitivity .",
    "the ms - mfs algorithm was designed to optimally use the multi - frequency measurements to do spectral - index mapping across diffused sources _ at the highest sensitivity and angular resolution _ offered by the data .",
    "the following is a summary of our current status , based on the imaging results shown in the previous section .",

    ".   separation of thermal versus non - thermal ; steep versus steeper spectra : we see clear morphological separations between regions expected to have different spectral structure from the surroundings . these differences range from @xmath37 between thermal and non - thermal regions , down to @xmath38 between structures thought to be cores and shells . in regions with high s",
    "/ n ratios ( @xmath39 ) , the estimated uncertainty in the spectral index is @xmath40 . in regions with low signal - to - noise ( @xmath41 ) , the uncertainty in the spectral index rises rapidly , and all the images presented here used a stokes-_i _ s / n threshold of 100 . 2 .",
    "image - reconstruction errors : errors in the spectral reconstructions are dominated by multi - scale deconvolution artifacts that decrease with appropriate choices of multi - scale imaging parameters ( a set of scale - sizes with which to model the spatial structure ) .",
    "error estimates from monte - carlo simulations ( by varying the choice of spatial scales ) range from @xmath42 when scales are chosen appropriately , up to 0.2 in the extreme case where diffuse emission is modeled by a series of @xmath43-functions .",
    "these simulations were done for the evla d - configuration and the errors depend on the precise uv - coverage just as they depend for the standard imaging algorithms .",
    "the ms - mfs algorithm reconstructs the frequency dependence of the flux by a polynomial fit across the frequency range on a per component basis .",
    "the errors on the estimated spectral index therefore also depend on the errors of the fitted coeffcients .",
    "these errors depend on variations in s / n ratio ( across the frequency range or due to the scale of the emission ) in the same way as the errors on the coefficients of any least - squares polynomial fitting algorithm ( see  @xcite for further details ) .",
    "further , at the largest spatial scales sampled by the interferometer ( which , of course , is telescope dependent ) , the spectrum is unconstrained by the data and the ms - mfs model does not provide adequate additional constraints .",
    "out of our examples , g55.7@xmath63.4 and g16.7@xmath60.1 contain structure at spatial scales that fall within the unsampled central region of the interferometer sampling function , aleading to overall systematic errors in the spectral index across the source .",
    "these errors are limited to the largest scales , but in the current implementation of the algorithm , it is not possible to analyse the scales separately . in our examples ,",
    "g55.7@xmath63.4 is affected significantly by this error and spectra of only the most compact emission can be trusted .",
    "finally , in addition to errors in the spectral index , off - source artifacts are present in the stokes-_i _ images beyond dynamic - ranges of a few thousand ( measured as the ratio of the peak brightness to the peak residual near the source ) .",
    "dynamic - ranges for the images presented here range from 2000 for g16.7@xmath60.1 to 10000 for g19.6@xmath70.2 . in most cases ,",
    "wide - band self - calibration was required to achieve these limits .",
    "wide - field wide - band sensitivity of the instrument , and related errors : across a 2:1 bandwidth , the size of the antenna power - pattern changes enough to produce an average beam that is significantly different from the beams at individual frequencies .",
    "the most - prominent difference is the near lack of a first null , with sensitivity at the few percent level out to almost three times the hpbw .",
    "the g55.7@xmath63.4 field is an example of this wide - field sensitivity pattern ( the reference - frequency primary beam has a hpbw of 30 ) . for sources",
    "far from the phase - center , the @xmath44-term causes the dominant wide - field error , and these images ( in particular g55.7 + 3.4 ) are a result of w - projection combined with ms - mfs .",
    "the next dominant error ( in stokes-_i _ and spectral index ) is due to the frequency dependence of the primary beam .",
    "all the spectral - index maps shown here have been corrected for this effect using the time - averaged pb - model , and can be trusted out to the 25% point of the reference - frequency primary - beam .",
    "the time - variability of the primary - beams has not been accounted for , and is thought to be the cause of the next dominant error ( visible as artifacts around bright sources about @xmath33 from the phase center in g55.7@xmath63.4 ) .",
    "the next steps in our analysis include combining multi - configuration and multi - band data for the g16.7@xmath60.1 and g19.6@xmath70.2 fields to introduce more constraints during image - reconstruction , to complete the software integration required to combine ms - mfs and w - projection with the a - projection algorithm to correct for time - varying primary - beams , and further tests with mosaicking observations and how the additional information aids the image reconstruction .",
    "these steps are in accordance with our long - term goal of doing a wide - band mosaiced survey of the galactic plane at low frequencies ."
