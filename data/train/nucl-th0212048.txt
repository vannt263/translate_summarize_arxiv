    "the low - energy orbital magnetic - dipole excitations of deformed nuclei , commonly called the scissors mode , were predicted about 25 years ago @xcite .",
    "the prediction was inspired by the geometric picture that the ( prolate ) deformed neutron and proton distributions counter rotate ( like scissors ) within a small opening angle @xmath0 in an oscillatory way around their common axis perpendicular to the long symmetry axis of the nucleus .",
    "only a few years later the idea was confirmed experimentally with its detection in @xmath1gd @xcite . at present , in addition to the rare earth nuclei , this excitation is also known in the actinides and in light nuclei .",
    "a complete review of the experimental situation can be found in @xcite .",
    "the discovery of the scissors mode has initiated a cascade of theoretical studies .",
    "an excellent review of the present situation in this field is the one by d. zawischa @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "very briefly the situation can be described in the following way .",
    "all microscopic calculations with effective forces reproduce experimental data with respect to the position and the strength of the scissors mode , some of them @xcite giving also reasonable fragmentation of its strength . however , the situation is more obscure in regard to simple phenomenological models whose aim is to explain the physics of the phenomenon and to interpret it in the most simple and transparent terms .",
    "a noticeable discord of the opinions of various authors must be observed here as has been pointed out in @xcite .",
    "one is forced to conclude that there is no general agreement in the understanding of the nature of this curious phenomenon .",
    "we here will try to shed some light into the confusing situation .",
    "our model hamiltonian will be the one of the well served harmonic oscillator plus separable quadrupole - quadrupole ( q - q ) residual interaction .",
    "the interaction will have isoscalar and isovector parts whose coupling constants are reasonably well known from the literature .",
    "of course , given such a simple schematic hamiltonian the rpa equations , which are the standard tool to describe the scissors mode , can readily be solved .",
    "this , however , does not advance us in its physical interpretation .",
    "namely , numerous calculations , performed during 25 years of investigation of the scissors mode have undoubtedly demonstrated at least one fact : the scissors mode is a very non - trivial , subtle type of motion subject to the influence of many factors .",
    "in fact its nature is much more complicated and interesting than the above picture of two counter rotating and oscillating pieces of matter might suggest .",
    "first of all one easily imagines that the rotational oscillations of neutron and proton systems are inevitably accompanied by the ( quadrupole ) distortion of their shapes .",
    "this entails that the scissors mode is intricately entangled with the iso - vector giant quadrupole resonance ( ivgqr ) .",
    "thus , if one wants to observe the scissors mode , one has to excite at the same time the ivgqr .",
    "the quadrupole distortions give rise to high lying excitations because of the so - called nuclear elasticity ( or fermi surface deformation ) , the quantum effect discovered by bertsch @xcite .",
    "it turns out that without this additional restoring force the scissors mode would actually be a zero energy mode !",
    "hence , the scissors mode is a pure quantum mechanical phenomenon , which can not be explained in the frame of classical mechanics .",
    "the above properties of the scissors mode highlight perhaps its most characteristic features . they will obtain a natural , sufficiently simple , and visual explanation in the frame of our approach outlined below .",
    "one further issue , strongly debated in the literature , is whether the neutron and proton fluids really spatially separate at least to a certain extent during the scissors motion . with diffuse surfaces and small amplitude motion",
    "this is a not completely trivial question and it only makes sense to speak about the separation of the symmetry axes of neutron and proton distributions .",
    "the debate is not without foundation , since there were attempts @xcite to construct a model with sharp surfaces : neutron and proton liquids perform out - of - phase rotational oscillations with steinwedel - jensen boundary conditions .",
    "our approach allows us to derive the analytic expressions for the current lines and the corresponding figures show unambiguously that indeed a separation of the two fluids occurs .",
    "more surprisingly , the separation not only exists in the low energy magnetic dipole excitation @xmath2 ( the scissors mode proper ) but also in the @xmath3 branch of the ivgqr , which is named `` the high energy scissors mode '' and whose existence was guessed by various authors many years ago @xcite .    from the above discussion",
    "it seems clear that in order to elucidate all these subtle features an approach involving macroscopic quantities as dynamical variables is indicated .",
    "most naturally this can be achieved by working in phase space @xcite .",
    "this can be easily performed by applying the wigner transform to the time dependent hartree - fock ( tdhf ) equations .",
    "the method of the wigner function moments ( wfm ) @xcite is then applied .",
    "it can be characterized as a link between microscopic and macroscopic approaches : starting from a microscopic hamiltonian one derives macroscopic dynamic equations for collective variables .",
    "usually one has to establish the set of such variables with the help of some physical considerations .",
    "the wfm method allows one to avoid this non - trivial problem : if one knows at least one collective variable ( in our case it is the relative angular momentum of neutrons and protons ) , the procedure of derivation of dynamical equations will automatically generate all the other variables needed .    in this way",
    "an unambiguous set of coupled equations in terms of dynamic physical variables is obtained , which in the small amplitude limit ( rpa ) allows for analytic solutions . since",
    "our equations are written down in the laboratory frame the total angular momentum @xmath4 is , of course , conserved . in this work",
    "we study the case without rotation and take @xmath5 .",
    "these remarks are important , since microscopic calculations @xcite have shown that for the results to be reasonable , it is very important to exclude from the wave function the spurious component responsible for the rotation of the nucleus , as a whole .",
    "such problems do not arise in our approach , because there is no necessity to introduce the intrinsic coordinate system .",
    "the analytical form of our results is very convenient to study the deformation ( @xmath6 ) dependence of various quantities such as position of resonances and transitions probabilities . in the small @xmath6 limit",
    "we mostly reproduce results already obtained by other authors .",
    "however , for large @xmath6 we obtain predictions for super- and hyper - deformed nuclei .",
    "this area is practically not investigated at present .",
    "the only investigation within a phenomenological model @xcite and the only existing microscopic calculation @xcite are in rather good agreement with our results . in @xcite pairing",
    "is taken into account whereas we have , so far , not considered superfluidity in our approach . however , it is well known that at large deformations superfluidity is of little influence on the dynamics and this is also the conclusion in @xcite . on the other hand at small and moderate @xmath6",
    "the influence of pairing may be appreciable and certainly our approach must be generalized to include superfluidity in the future .",
    "it is for example shown that pairing reduces b(m1 ) - transition probabilities by important factors and that this yields agreement with the experimental deformation dependence @xcite . in spite of the importance of pairing correlations in nuclei we know from other features that it certainly changes results quantitatively but it is too weak in nuclei to yield qualitative changes .",
    "for example the moment of inertia usually goes only half way from its rigid body value to its irrotational liquid limit ( strong pairing case ) .",
    "we therefore believe that the physical insights we will develop in this paper will stay qualitatively correct , even if superfluidity is included in a later stage .",
    "as we mentioned already , this shall be the subject of future studies .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "the general outline of the wfm formalism is presented .",
    "this formalism is applied to the model of a harmonic oscillator potential with q - q residual interaction in section 3 : the equations of motion for irreducible tensors are derived and analyzed , the energies of collective isoscalar and isovector excitations are calculated .",
    "the method of infinitesimal displacements is used in section 4 to find the expressions for the nucleon currents of the different modes and to display the respective figures .",
    "the magnetic and electric transition probabilities are calculated in section 5 with the help of the linear response theory .",
    "sum rules are analyzed in section 6 .",
    "the most interesting points in the description and understanding of the scissors mode are discussed in section 7 .",
    "the scissors mode in superdeformed nuclei is considered in section 8 .",
    "the summary of the main results and concluding remarks are contained in section 9 . to obtain a general impression of the approach and results one can omit the sections 4 , 5 and 6 in a first reading",
    "the basis of our method is the time dependent hartree - fock ( tdhf ) equation for the one - body density matrix @xmath7 : @xmath8,\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is the one - body self - consistent hamiltonian depending implicitly on the density matrix and @xmath10 is an isotopic index .",
    "it is convenient to modify equation ( [ tdhf ] ) introducing the wigner transform @xcite of the density matrix @xmath11 and of the hamiltonian @xmath12 using ( [ f],[hw ] ) one arrives @xcite at    @xmath13    where the upper index on the nabla operator stands for the function on which this operator acts .",
    "if the hamiltonian is a sum of a kinetic term and a local potential @xmath14 , its wigner transform is just the classical version of the same hamiltonian @xmath15 then equation ( [ fsin ] ) becomes @xmath16 expanding in powers of @xmath17 leads to @xmath18    now we apply the wfm method to derive a closed set of dynamical equations for different multipole moments and other integral characteristics of the nucleus .",
    "this method is described in detail in ref .",
    "its idea is based on the virial theorems of chandrasekhar and lebovitz @xcite .",
    "it is shown in @xcite , that by integrating equation ( [ sinexpan ] ) over the phase space @xmath19 with the weights @xmath20 , where @xmath21 runs from @xmath22 to @xmath23 , one can obtain a closed finite set of dynamical equations for cartesian tensors of the rank @xmath23 .",
    "taking linear combinations of these equations one is able to represent them through irreducible tensors .",
    "however , it is more convenient to derive the dynamical equations directly for irreducible tensors using the technique of tensor products @xcite . for this",
    "it is necessary to rewrite the wigner function equation ( [ sinexpan ] ) in terms of cyclic variables @xmath24 with @xmath25 @xmath26and the analogous definitions for @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "the required equations shall be obtained by integrating ( [ sincyclic ] ) with different tensor products of @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "as outlined in the introduction , the model considered here is a harmonic oscillator mean field potential with quadrupole - quadrupole residual interactions .",
    "its microscopic hamiltonian is @xmath31 where the quadrupole operator @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the numbers of neutrons and protons respectively .",
    "the hamiltonian is of the standard bohr - mottelson type @xcite , however , with an interaction coupling protons and neutrons ( constant @xmath34 ) and , separately , coupling protons and neutrons among themselves ( constant @xmath35 ) .",
    "this form is appropriate for the description of the scissors mode .",
    "the corresponding mean field potentials are @xmath36 for protons and @xmath37 for neutrons .",
    "the multipole moments @xmath38 are defined as @xmath39 where @xmath40 . introducing the notation @xmath41",
    "one can rewrite the mean fields in a more compact way @xmath42 substituting the spherical functions by the tensor products @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 is the clebsch - gordan coefficient ( let us recall that the vector @xmath46 is a tensor of rank one ) , one has @xmath47 here @xmath48 @xmath49 @xmath50    integration of the equation ( [ sincyclic ] ) with the weights @xmath51 and @xmath52 yields the following set of equations ( it is important to note , that because ( [ mfield ] ) is of quadratic form , the wfm break off at second order ) : @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the wigner @xmath55-symbol . for the sake of simplicity the time dependence of tensors",
    "is not written out .",
    "further the following notation is introduced @xmath56 it is necessary to say some words about the physical meaning of the collective variables introduced above . by definition @xmath57 and @xmath58",
    "is the quadrupole moment of the system of particles and @xmath59 with @xmath60 being the mean square radius of the same system . by analogy with these variables , defined in the coordinate space",
    ", we can say that the variables @xmath61 and @xmath62 describe the quadrupole moment and the mean square radius of the same system in a momentum space .",
    "the variables @xmath63 describe the coupling of momentum and coordinate spaces . to understand their nature it is useful to recall the definitions @xcite of nuclear density and mean velocity :",
    "@xmath64 they enter into the definitions ( [ rlmu],[p , l ] ) of irreducible tensors @xmath65 the last expression for @xmath63 demonstrates in an obvious way the physical meaning of these variables : being the first order moments of mean velocities they give information about the distribution of these velocities in the nucleus .",
    "( `` first '' means that velocities are weighted with the coordinate @xmath46 ) .",
    "sometimes , if the motion is comparatively simple , this information turns out sufficient to completely determine the velocity field ( see section 4 ) . in the case of more intricate motions",
    "higher order moments are required for a complete description of velocities @xcite . in any case",
    "the moments of velocities are a very convenient tool to descibe the collective motion .",
    "for example , the zero order moment of velocity is nothing more than the linear momentum describing the nucleus center of mass motion .",
    "one of the first order moments corresponds to the very well known angular momentum of a nucleus .",

    "adjustment of the model parameters to the low - energy vibrational and rotational states @xcite finally has the effect that the average energy is also well reproduced . ''",
    "\\iii ) `` in order to find out the physical interpretation of the lowest @xmath125 mixed symmetry state of the ibm-2 , the ( semi)classical limit of the ibm-2 hamiltonian has been investigated by balantekin and barrett @xcite , bijker @xcite and walet @xcite , yielding a hamiltonian similar to that of trrm , the potential being a function of the angle @xmath126 between the symmetry axes of protons and neutrons : @xmath127 . ''    with respect to iii ) we must note , that deriving the classical limit , the vibrational degrees of freedom have been neglected to simplify the derivation . not surprisingly they obtained the trrm hamiltonian as a result for which we have already given our opinion above .    generally speaking these above citations",
    "give exaustive characteristic of the status of ibm ( iba ) calculations of the scissors mode : they are able to give correct values for the energy and strength of the scissors mode but they do not explain the real physics of the phenomenon .",
    "the situation with shell model calculations is rather complicated .",
    "there are the well known difficulties to treat heavy nuclei because of the huge dimension of matrices",
    ". therefore the calculations are usually made for very light nuclei .",
    "even there one must divide them into two groupes .",
    "there are qualitative estimations with truncated basis ( @xmath128 , see for example @xcite ) .",
    "naturally , those calculations suffer from the same drawbacks as the ibm calculations and then the same comment given above apply .",
    "there are also realistic calculations ( for @xmath129be and @xmath130be ) with an extended @xmath131 basis @xcite . in principle",
    "they have the same status as rpa calculations .",
    "still one can ask the question whether it makes sense to talk about scissors mode in such light nuclei .",
    "we also would like to comment on the neutron - proton deformation ( npd ) model .",
    "we again cite @xcite : \" the bohr - mottelson model has been generalized to isovector degrees of freedom leading to the neutron - proton deformation ( npd ) model ... rohozinski and greiner @xcite applied the npd model to the orbital magnetic dipole excitations ....    the trrm also has been changed by its authors to the trm , relaxing the condition of rigid rotation and replacing the rigid - body moment of inertia by a smaller one obtained from some model or a phenomenological one @xcite .",
    "`` if their parameters ' ' ... are adjusted to the data , the trm and npd model will coincide , even though in their original assumptions ",
    "rigid rotation in the one , irrotational flow in the other  the models are contradictory .",
    "\"    therefore we agree with the conclusion of zawischa @xcite that the npd model can not describe the scissors mode .",
    "the reasons are also especially well born out in terms of our method : the collective variables in their model are only @xmath132 and @xmath133 , there are no rotational degrees of freedom ( @xmath134 ) and there is no fermi surface deformation ( @xmath135 ) .",
    "as we know from an earlier discussion , only the isovector giant resonance survives in such conditions ( see section 7.3 ) .",
    "therefore , the @xmath136-dependence of @xmath137-factor which the npd model predicts and which is in principle in agreement with experiment , must actually be interpreted as the @xmath136-dependence of @xmath137 for the ivgqr ( see eq .",
    "( [ isovmat ] ) ) .",
    "the @xmath6-dependence of the low lying scissors becomes quadratic only after inclusion of pairing @xcite .    in conclusion",
    "we think that above set of citations and argumentations is convincing enough to state that all the models and methodes describing the scissors mode without coupling to ivgqr are pure phenomenological and are therefore of restricted usefulness .",
    "as already mentioned , a certain drawback of our approach is that , so far , we have not included superfluidity into our description .",
    "nevertheless , our formulas ( [ omeg2fin ] , [ scimat ] , [ m1iv ] ) can be successfully used for the description of the superdeformed nuclei , where the pairing is very weak @xcite .",
    "for example , applying them to the superdeformed nucleus @xmath138dy ( @xmath139 ) , we get @xmath140 for the isovector gqr and @xmath141 for the scissors mode .",
    "there are not so many results of other calculations to compare with . as a matter of fact",
    ", there are only two papers considering this problem .",
    "the phenomenological trm model predicts @xcite : @xmath142 the only existing microscopic calculation @xcite in the frame of qrpa with separable forces gives slightly more information : @xmath143 @xmath144 here @xmath145 denotes the total @xmath111 orbital strength carried by the calculated @xmath3 qrpa excitations modes in the energy region below 20 mev .",
    "the @xmath146 denotes `` the calculated overlap probabilities of the qrpa solutions with the synthetic orbital scissors mode which is defined as @xmath147 where @xmath148 is a normalisation factor .",
    "the parameter @xmath149 is determined by the requirement that the mode @xmath150 is orthogonal to the spurious state @xmath151 '' @xcite .",
    "it is easy to see that in the case of ivgqr one can speak , at least , about qualitative agreement .",
    "our results for @xmath152 and @xmath146 are in good agreement with that of phenomenological model and with @xmath152 and @xmath145 of hamamoto and nazarewicz .",
    "the very small value of @xmath153 is explained quite naturally by the fact , that the synthetic mode does not treat properly two main ingredients of the scissors mode : fermi surface deformation and coupling with ivgqr .",
    "examples of @xmath6-dependences of energies and b(m1)-factors are shown in fig.[fig3 ] .",
    "in this work we again have considered the issue of the physics behind the nuclear scissors mode . in spite of 25 years of research and many valuable contributions to this subject",
    "the subtleties of the scissors mode are still under debate , and in our opinion erroneous interpretations of the subject continue to appear in the literature .",
    "surprisingly , no systematic study of the mode in the bohr - mottelson hamiltonian has yet been carried out , and our purpose here was to fill that gap .",
    "the bohr - mottelson hamiltonian consist of a harmonic single - particle potential together with a separable q - q interaction .",
    "the q - q forces have different couplings in the isoscalar and isovector channels .",
    "the isoscalar coupling strength is determined from bohr and mottelson self - consistency condition , leaving the isovector strength as a free parameter .",
    "we adjust it from the fact that the isovector giant quadrupole resonance is experimentally known to lie practically at twice the energy of the isoscalar giant quadrupole mode . with this our model",
    "is entirely fixed and its solution in the small amplitude limit can be found analytically for excitation energies and transition amplitudes .    the physics becomes particularly transparent once the tdhf equations are written down in phase space and the so called wigner function moments are introduced .",
    "this approach allows one to establish the optimum set of macroscopic variables : quadrupole moment , angular momentum , pressure tensor , etc .",
    "these variables are , in the scheme of our formalism , absolutely unambiguous and , together with the analytic solution , they allow for a maximum of physical insight . at least , the inevitable coupling of the scissors mode with the isovector giant quadrupole resonance becomes obvious immediately , already at the stage of the formulation of the model .",
    "furthermore , the fermi surface deformation , whose decisive role in the physics of the scissors mode is difficult to predict employing naive phenomenological models , appears in our approach quite naturally .    the eigenvalue equation in the isovector channel yields two frequencies which are given by @xmath154 .",
    "they are distributed in a non symmetric way around twice the harmonic oscillator frequency @xmath155 and they gradually approach one another with increasing @xmath6 .",
    "the low lying frequency corresponds to the one of the scissors mode proper , whereas the other is the so - called high lying scissors mode .",
    "our analysis shows that , indeed , the motion of both modes is `` scissors''-like in the sense that the long symmetry axes of proton and neutron distributions get tilted by a small angle during their oscillatory motion .",
    "nevertheless both modes are quite distinct what is revealed by looking at the respective flow patterns ( figs .",
    "[ fig1],[fig2 ] ) .",
    "the flow lines of the scissors mode are closed ellipses ( i.e. mostly rotational flow ) leading to a compression of the long axis , while the ones of the high lying mode are open hyperbolas ( i.e. mostly irrotational flow ) leading to an elongation of the long axis . the frequency of the scissors mode as a function of mass number turns out to be about 15% too low , compared with the experimental data . in respect to the somewhat crude model we have been employing this",
    "may seem a reasonable agreement .",
    "one should , however , mention that we completely disregarded pairing in our work .",
    "it is generally known that superfluidity makes the mass parameters smaller , i.e. the frequencies of the modes become higher .",
    "it will be a further task to study whether this accounts for the missing 15% in energy .",
    "other quantities we studied in our model are transition probabilities , for instance with respect to their deformation dependence . though for small deformation",
    "most of our results have already been found by other authors @xcite with different methods , we make a point here in predicting the behaviour for superdeformed nuclei .",
    "we also want to attract the attention to the potential richness of the set of our equations ( [ quadr ] ) . in a further study one may employ them for the description of the joint dynamics of the isoscalar and isovector giant monopole and quadrupole resonances plus the scissors mode in deformed rotating nuclei , the amplitudes of vibrations being not necessarily small .",
    "a large amplitude motion was already treated in the frame of this approach to describe the multiphonon giant quadrupole and monopole resonances @xcite .",
    "what about two - phonon scissors ?",
    "the question is not only academic - the first attempt to interpret some numerical results as the multiphonon scissors is already known @xcite .",
    "one may also think to take into account the spin degrees of freedom - only the number of dynamic equations must be doubled ( spin projections up and down ) .",
    "then , the theory becomes capable of describing spin - flip excitations . as a result",
    ", there appears a possibility of considering the orbital and spin components of the scissors mode simultaneously .",
    "it is worth noticing that the set of equations ( [ quadr ] ) is written in the laboratory coordinate system .",
    "it allows one to get rid of any troubles connected with spurious rotation , because the total ( i.e. , isoscalar ) angular momentum is conserved ( the last equation of ( [ isos ] ) ) .",
    "moreover , the total angular momentum enters into the dynamic equations - hence one can study the behaviour of all modes in rotating nuclei",
    ". this would be especially interesting for the scissors mode in superdeformed ( sd ) nuclei , because `` the sd bands in nuclei around @xmath138dy and @xmath156hg are observed at high spins '' @xcite .",
    "the first interesting results of calculation interpreted as the rotational band built on the scissors excitation appeared in @xcite . the above mentioned problems shall be investigated in future work .",
