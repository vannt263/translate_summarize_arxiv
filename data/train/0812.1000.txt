    "the existence of supermassive black holes ( bhs ) in normal galaxy nuclei was predicted forty years ago by @xcite , but until fifteen years ago it was still considered an interesting possibility which had to be demonstrated .",
    "nowadays bhs are regarded as a crucial ingredient for our understanding of how galaxies form .",
    "key to this paradigm shift was the launch in 1990 of the hubble space telescope ( hst ) .",
    "it all started with the realisation that the mass of the bh is correlated to other global characteristics of the host galaxy as a whole . initially a correlation @xmath8 was found between the mass of the bh and the luminosity of the host - galaxy stellar spheroid @xcite . in 1997",
    "the installation of the stis long - slit spectrograph on hst allowed the spatially - resolved kinematical observations to probe inside the radius of the subarcsecond bh sphere of influence @xmath9 in nearby galaxies ( @xmath10 being the velocity dispersion of the stars in the galaxy ) .",
    "the increased accuracy in the  determinations contributed to the discovery of the tighter @xmath11 correlation @xcite .",
    "as @xmath10 is a good predictor of galaxy properties , it is perhaps not surprising that similar correlations were found between  and respectively the galaxy concentration @xcite , the dark - halo mass @xcite , the bulge mass @xcite and the stars gravitational binding energy @xcite .",
    "the existence of these correlations is broadly consistent with a scenario in which the bh regulates the galaxy formation , during the hierarchical galaxy merging , by shutting off the conversion of gas into stars via a feedback mechanism due to its powerful outflows @xcite .    even though the current scenario explains a number of observed facts , our interpretation of the role of bhs in galaxy formation is far from secure .",
    "one of the problems lies in the fact that the models have few observables to compare with , mainly the galaxy mass ( or @xmath10 ) and .",
    "moreover , even after a decade of hst spectroscopy and models , only about 40 secure bh determinations exist ( compilations are given e.g. in * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . with few exceptions",
    "the bh determinations have been performed with a single dynamical tracer ( either gas or stars ) , so that no independent test of the two measurements methods could be made .",
    "very little is known about the orbital distribution near the bhs , which is expected to contain key information on the bh accretion process @xcite .",
    "the advent of integral - field spectroscopy on all the 810-m class telescopes , combined with adaptive optics ( ao ) to reduce the blurring effect of the earth s atmosphere is opening a new epoch for bh studies .",
    "the large mirrors allow for shorter exposure times and higher signal - to - noise ratios ( @xmath12 ) of the observations , than what was possible with the 2.4-m mirror and the stis long - slit spectrograph of hst .",
    "observations at near - infrared wavelengths allow dust absorption effects to be virtually eliminated .",
    "the integral - field observations , due to the tight constraint on the orbital distribution , dramatically improve the accuracy of  determination , for a given spatial resolution and @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "integral - field data are also needed for a unique recovery of the orbital distribution from the observations @xcite .",
    "this can be understood from dimensional arguments , considering that most orbits in a stationary potential conserve three isolating integrals of motion .",
    "this three - dimensional orbital distribution can not be recovered without the knowledge of at least another three - dimensional observed quantity .",
    "motivated by these arguments ,  determinations from ao - assisted integral - field observations in the near - infrared are starting to appear in the literature @xcite .",
    "the elliptical galaxy ngc  5128 ( centaurus  a ) is a prime candidate for ao - assisted integral - field observations .",

    "specifically , lengths and masses scale as @xmath13 , while mass - to - light ratios scale as @xmath15 . ]",
    "@xmath16 mpc to be consistent with all the earlier papers on  determination on this galaxy @xcite .",

    "a is the nearest elliptical galaxy and one arcsec corresponds to 17 pc .",
    "cen  a is among the only @xmath17 galaxies on the whole sky with an observed @xmath18 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a partial list ) .",
    "moreover cen  a possesses a nuclear gaseous disk in regular rotation from which a number of independent determinations of  have been performed , with ever increasing accuracy @xcite .",
    "this allows for an accurate comparison between the bh mass derived with gaseous or stellar kinematics .",
    "the @xmath0-band central surface brightness of cen  a is quite bright at @xmath19 mag @xcite , which allows a high @xmath12 in the stellar spectra to be achieved in reasonable exposure times .",
    "a bright star , sufficiently close to the nucleus , can be used as reference for the ao correction .",
    "all these facts make cen  a a unique observational benchmark for  determinations in the near - infrared .    in section  2",
    "we describe our data and the extraction of the stellar kinematics . in section  3",
    "we present the stellar dynamical models .",
    "we discuss our results in section  4 and we finally summarize them in section  5 .",
    "for the dynamical modeling of the stellar kinematics we used integral - field spectroscopy obtained with sinfoni on the ut4 ( yepun ) of the very large telescope of the european southern observatory on the cerro paranal .",
    "sinfoni consists of the cryogenic near - ir integral field spectrometer spiffi @xcite coupled to the visible curvature ao system macao @xcite .",
    "we observed the nucleus of cen  a with two different spatial scales : 0250@xmath200125 ( 250mas scale ) with a field of view ( fov ) of 8@xmath208and 010@xmath20005 ( 100mas scale ) with a fov of 32@xmath2032 .",
    "the 100mas observations and data reduction were already described in @xcite .",
    "the observations were performed in excellent seeing conditions of 05 fwhm , as measured by the seeing monitor in the @xmath21-band . with the 250mas spatial scale",
    "the observations were taken in natural seeing , while with the 100mas scale the sinfoni ao module was locked onto an r@xmath2214 mag star about 36southwest of the nucleus .",
    "although the reference star is relatively distant from the galaxy nucleus , the good seeing allowed us to achieve a nearly diffraction - limited correction in the @xmath0-band .",
    "both data sets were obtained in the @xmath0-band , which covers the wavelength range 1.932.47 .",
    "the spectral resolution of the observations was @xmath23 in both scales , and corresponds to an instrumental dispersion of @xmath24 .",
    "the 250mas observations followed an object - sky - object sequence with equal exposure time of 300 s each , for a total on - source exposure time of @xmath25 s. the sky exposure were taken at 200from the nucleus to make sure the spectra were not contaminated by the large galaxy .",
    "the 100mas observations followed a similar sequence with individual exposure times of 900 s each and a total on - source exposure time of @xmath26 s. the different exposures were dithered with shifts of 02 to allow for the removal of detector defects and cosmic rays .",
    "the data were reduced using the sinfoni data reduction pipeline provided by eso as described in section  2 of @xcite .",
    "the spatial point - spread - function ( psf ) of the 100mas observation was determined in section  2.1 of @xcite from a fit to the non - thermal nucleus , which is unresolved down to a 006 ( fwhm ) spatial resolution @xcite .",
    "the psf can be approximated by two gaussians with fwhm of 012 and 030 respectively , with the smallest gaussian containing 17% of the total flux .",
    "a two - dimensional fit with a single gaussian to the nucleus in the reconstructed image from the data cube gives a fwhm of 017 .",
    "for the stellar dynamical modeling the integral - field high - spatial resolution sinfoni observations are essential to tightly constrain the bh mass and stellar orbital distribution .",
    "however they are not sufficient as they sample only a small fraction of the half - light radius of cen  a ( @xmath27 in @xmath0-band ; @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite showed that one has to sample with the kinematics a significant fraction of  to accurately constrain bh masses .",
    "for this reason in this paper we also use the @xmath0-band kinematics obtained with the gemini near infrared spectrograph ( gnirs ) at gemini south by @xcite .",
    "the long - slit observations extend to a distance of @xmath28 from the galaxy nucleus and were obtained at two position angles : ( i ) centered on the nucleus , along the galaxy major axis at large radii ( @xmath29 from north through east ) , and ( ii ) along the galaxy minor axis ( @xmath30 ) , but offset from the nucleus by 085 . in this paper",
    "we increased the gnirs @xmath10 by 5% to match our sinfoni kinematics .",
    "differences at this level between the two datasets are almost unavoidable and are likely due to low - level systematic calibration errors , or differences in the adopted stellar templates .",
    "for this reason we can not state which of the two datasets has the proper absolute @xmath10 calibration . as none of the results in this paper depends on whether we apply the small shift to the gnirs or sinfoni data , we arbitrarily decided to increase the gnirs data to match our sinfoni ones , which we adopt as reference .",
    "a 5% uncertainty in @xmath10 approximately translates into a 10% uncertainty in the @xmath31 .",
    "the individual sinfoni exposures were registered using reconstructed images and merged into a single data cube . in the process",
    "they were resampled to a spatial scale of 0125@xmath200125 ( 250mas scale ) and 005@xmath20005 ( 100mas scale ) .",
    "the stellar kinematics requires a high @xmath12 for an unbiased extraction from the spectra . for typical observational setups , values on the order of @xmath32 per spectral pixel ,",
    "are generally required to detect deviations of the line - of - slight velocity distribution from a simple gaussian shape ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "for this reason long - slit data are invariably adaptively binned along the spatial direction , before the kinematic extraction ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the goal of binning is to maintain the maximum spatial resolution , given a constraint on the minimum @xmath12 .",
    "four our integral - field data we use the voronoi binning technique , mxc / idl/ ] which constitutes an optimal solution to this problem in two - dimension @xcite .    given that the observations are dominated by the photon noise",
    ", we spatially binned the data by requiring an equal number of counts in each spatial bin . in this way",
    "we did not have to rely on the , often inaccurate , noise propagation by the reduction pipeline , to estimate the @xmath12 .",
    "this constant flux per bin is achieved in the voronoi binning algorithm by setting the input noise @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the total flux ( in arbitrary units ) in each unbinned spectrum . for the 100mas scale",
    "the target @xmath12 for the binning was fixed by the requirement for the data to be unbinned ( pixel size 005@xmath20005 ) within a radius @xmath35 and start being binned at larger radii , where the surface brightness decreases .",
    "this led to 622 voronoi bins , out of the original @xmath36 pixels .",
    "similarly for the 250mas scale we required the data to be unbinned ( pixel size 0125@xmath200125 ) within @xmath37 , leading to 554 bins .",
    "the actual minimum @xmath12 achieved by the adopted binning was determined afterwards , from the rms residuals of a spectral template fit ( section  [ sec : ppxf ] ) , to be @xmath38 for both spatial scales .",
    "the near - infrared @xmath0-band spectral region is dominated by the strong stellar absorption feature of the 2.30  ( 2 - 0 ) @xmath39co band head . at this wavelength",
    "the galaxy spectrum is dominated by the light from cool and evolved giant stars .",
    "the strength of the co absorption is very sensitive to the star surface gravity @xcite and this implies that , contrary to the optical region , in the @xmath0-band it is _ essential _ to include giant stars in the construction of an optimal stellar template for an unbiased extraction of the stellar kinematics @xcite .",
    "the extraction of the stellar kinematics was performed using the penalized pixel - fitting method@xmath40 ( ppxf ; * ? ? ?",

    "additive polynomials of degree four were used to allow for possible variations in the stellar line - strength at different radii , to account for imperfections in the sky subtraction or spectral calibration , and to model the contribution of the non - thermal nucleus ( section  [ sec : nonthermal ] ) .",
    "consistent results were obtained using polynomials of degree 18 . from numerous tests on other galaxies we found that , even for the most extreme gradients in the stellar population , the additive polynomials are sufficient to approximate possible low - frequency variations in the line - strength , once the global galaxy template is accurately determined from a high-@xmath12 spectrum , to account for the high - frequency content in the spectrum .",

    "a reasonable fit to the @xmath129 is obtained in this case at the upper limit @xmath140 of our schwarzschild confidence interval .",
    "this general agreement confirms previous comparisons , showing that although general three - integral models are needed for accurate  determinations , much simpler isotropic models , applied to the same data , provide a useful sanity - check for the determination @xcite .",

    "it would be interesting to perform a similar type of comparison , but using the same data for both anisotropic jeans and schwarzschild models .",
    "the reason for the reasonable agreement between the simpler and the more general models is likely due to the fact that many real galaxies do not ` utilize ' all the freedom in the orbital distribution that would be required to produce more dramatic disagreements , and do not deviate very strongly from being isotropic in their centers ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "this gas - stars  comparison constitutes one of the most robust and accurate ones , due to a very well resolved bh sphere of influence ( @xmath5 compared to a psf fwhm@xmath143 ) and thanks to the use of high - resolution integral - field data for both kinematical tracers .",
    "comparable and equally successful comparisons were done by @xcite and @xcite , while a less good agreement was found in @xcite , likely due to the disturbed gas kinematics .",

    "in summary the only significant disagreement in  is with the previous stellar  determination by @xcite . in section  [ sec : jeans ] we showed that the disagreement is likely caused by a difference in the data quality and in the treatment of the contribution from the central non - thermal continuum in the kinematic extraction .",
    "it is not due to differences in the details of the modeling methods . as shown in @xcite , with our new gas and stars  determination cen  a lies within the errors on the @xmath11 relation as given by either @xcite or @xcite .",

    "the profile is to first order flat around the value @xmath148 .",
    "the maximum deviations of the velocity ellipsoid from a sphere ( isotropy ) are on the order of 15% .",
    "the profile shows no sudden bias towards tangential orbits inside @xmath120 , while a tangential bias appears only inside @xmath6 .",
    "this profile seems typical of the few nuclear anisotropy profiles that have been published so far using integral - field observations or spherical models ( the only cases for which the orbital distribution can be robustly recovered ) : m32 @xcite , m87 @xcite , ngc  3379 @xcite , ngc  1399 @xcite .",
