    "the understanding of entanglement in a multipartite quantum system is a central problem of contemporary quantum mechanics , also spreading to statistical and solid state physics .",
    "a multipartite quantum system can not exhibit arbitrary entanglement properties , and the restrictions are far from being straightforward .",
    "this fact has several implications on the properties of spin chains and spin lattices , the typical subjects of statistical and solid state physics .",
    "this became apparent along with the recent developments of density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) techniques ( consult  @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "in particular , if one considers a system of two subsystems in a maximally entangled state , neither of the subsystems can , of course , be entangled with anything else . in a system of many quantum bits ( qubits , or spin-@xmath0 particles ) the limitations on the entanglement of the qubit - pairs are quantified by the coffman - kundu - wootters ( ckw ) inequalities  @xcite , for more than three qubits this long standing conjecture was recently proven @xcite . finding a quantum state with prescribed pairwise entanglement between each pair",
    "is therefore not always possible , and it is a rather involved task  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we consider an infinite one dimensional chain of qubits where each qubit is entangled at least with its two nearest neighbours .",
    "we impose the constraint of translation invariance : the state should be invariant under all transformations that shift each qubit from its original position @xmath4 to @xmath5 for some integer @xmath6 . our main goal is to find the maximal possible achievable entanglement of the nearest neighbours , and study the properties of the so arising chain .",
    "this problem is interesting mainly for two reasons .",
    "first , because if the bound on nearest neighbour entanglement is optimal , then it serves as a reference point for interpreting entanglement values obtained for real physical systems ( such as the antiferromagnetic heisenberg chain  @xcite or lines of ions in a trap which could be used for quantum computations  @xcite ) .",
    "second , because the results contribute to the knowledge on the possible structures of distributed entanglement in systems of ( infinitely ) many subsystems .",
    "this question was also addressed by wootters  @xcite . via a certain procedure he succeeded in constructing such translation invariant entangled chains in which the maximal achievable concurrence is @xmath7 which corresponds to a value of entanglement of formation of @xmath8 ebits .",
    "this value is below @xmath9 , the limit that the ckw inequalities would allow for , in the case when each quantum bit is maximally entangled with the rest of the system , while the bipartite entanglement is restricted to the nearest neighbours .",
    "the concurrence @xmath10 is conjectured to be an absolute bound , but this fact is not proven .",
    "a challenging question in this context is if one can go beyond @xmath11 , or even reach @xmath12 .",
    "in this paper we attack the problem in a different way , related to the dmrg method .",
    "this latter is found to be a variational method in terms of the so - called matrix product states ( mps )  @xcite , equivalent to a sequence of entanglement swappings  @xcite .",
    "the mpss constitute a representation of the pure state of a finite number of qubits . for each qubit of the system",
    "an auxiliary finite dimensional hilbert space is considered .",
    "the state is described by projectors acting between the auxiliary space and the space of the system under consideration .",
    "they are very suitable for approximating ground states of hamiltonians in a numerically efficient way where the approximation lies on the dimensionality of the auxiliary system .",
    "the infinite chain can be studied as a limit , assuming periodic boundary conditions .",
    "this attitude is equivalent to a different formulation , termed finitely correlated states ( fcs ) .",
    "a pure state of the whole translationally invariant chain is encoded into a state of an auxiliary system and a completely positive ( cp ) map . in this framework , the density operator for any finite subset of the system can be constructed by the successive application of the cp map , while the auxiliary system models the rest of the system from the point of view of quantum correlations .",
    "all translational invariant states can be approximated in that way with an accuracy which may depend on the dimension of the auxiliary system .",
    "the entanglement distribution of such chains has been already studied in refs .",
    "@xcite under the restriction of @xmath13 dimensional auxiliary systems  @xcite .",
    "we shall use a specific subset of such fcs as an ansatz to maximize nearest neighbour entanglement in a translationally invariant infinite chain of qubits .",
    "this approach has several advantages .",
    "first , it provides us explicitly with a well - defined pure state on the whole chain .",
    "second , we can study a class of quantum states different to the one studied in ref .",
    "third , we can also investigate higher correlations as next nearest neighbour entanglement and entanglement of one qubit with the rest of the chain .",
    "thus we can study the entanglement distributed along the chain , however , we focus mainly on maximizing nearest neighbour entanglement and the properties of such an optimal state regarding the entanglement of next nearest , and further neighbours . for two dimensional auxiliary systems we have analytical results describing the properties of entanglement of such an entangled chain and for higher dimensions",
    "we have performed a numerical optimization .",
    "we have found that the achievable nearest neighbours entanglement seems to converge fast to wootters bound @xmath14 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . section  [ sec : states ] is devoted to the construction of the states of translationally invariant finitely correlated chains utilized in this paper . in section  [ max ]",
    "analytical results are presented for the maximization of the nearest neighbour entanglement for the case of low dimensional auxiliary hilbert spaces , to give an insight into the nature of the problem . in section  [ numericaloptimization ]",
    "our numerical results are presented for higher dimensionalities , while in section  [ sec : properties ] the properties of the so found optimal states are discussed . in section  [",
    "sect : summary ] our results are summarized , and conclusions are drawn .",
    "we consider an infinite ensemble of qubits arranged along a line .",
    "the first question we address is what we mean by the word `` state '' as applied to infinitely many qubits .",
    "we adopt the standard approach described in e.g.  ref .",
    "a state @xmath15 of the infinite chain is a functional that assigns to every finite set of local operators @xmath16}=a_1\\otimes a_2\\dots\\otimes a_n$ ] a normalized density matrix @xmath17})$ ] describing the properties of the of @xmath6 qubits .",
    "moreover one demands that if one considers a subset of local operators @xmath18}$ ] of the set @xmath16}$ ] then the state @xmath19})$ ] has to be obtained by taking the partial trace of @xmath17})$ ] over the qubits not in @xmath16}$ ] .    before describing the rather mathematical construction in detail , we outline first the idea behind it .",
    "the trick is to describe the part of the chain in which one is not interested in by a density matrix on an auxiliary hilbert space @xmath20 , a local operator of the bounded operators @xmath21 and a completely positive map which maps tensor products of such an auxiliary local operator and the local operator of one qubit @xmath22 always back into @xmath21 . in this way",
    "the completely positive map ensures that one only archives permitted states of a qubit or more qubits in such an infinite chain .",
    "it is clear that the set of the permitted and thus realized states of a qubit or more qubits of the chain can increase if the dimension of the auxiliary system describing the `` rest of the chain '' is increased . further one has to carefully choose the appropriate completely positive maps in order to study the class of permitted one or more qubit states one is interested in .",
    "explicit examples for choices of the completely positive map for increasing dimensions of the auxiliary system which maximize nearest neighbour entanglement ( our main goal ) are then given in sec .",
    "[ max ] , but let us first proceed with the construction of the finitely correlated states in more detail .      in the following we summarize the exact mathematical construction of translationally invariant finitely correlated states according to ref .",

    "we have set the control parameters of the routine to @xmath178 , @xmath179 @xmath180 , @xmath181 and @xmath182 ( consult the documentation  @xcite of the routine for their exact meaning ) .",
    "the routine showed a normal convergence in each case .",
    "then the so - obtained maxima were used as an initial condition for a conjugate gradient search bfgsmin , with numerical gradient .",
    "we have found that the function is indeed differentiable around this maximum .",
    "the conjugate gradient search showed a strong convergence .",
    "the so obtainable final result is somewhat more accurate than the one obtained directly from simulated annealing . as a result of these procedure",
    ", we have obtained the parameter sets @xmath175 for which the nearest - neighbour concurrence @xmath177 has a maximum value .",
    "though this procedure does not give a full warranty for finding the global maximum , it is very likely that the obtained maxima are indeed global .",
    "we have summarized the results of the above described optimization procedure in table  [ table1 ] . in case of entangled chains it is conjectured  @xcite that the maximum value of nearest neighbour entanglement as measured by concurrence is @xmath183 .",
    "as it is apparent from the results in table  [ table1 ] , in our framework we can obtain a state which almost reaches this upper bound .",
    "thus the translationally invariant finitely correlated chains can approach the state of an entangled chain with maximal bipartite entanglement quite fast .",
    "this is our main result .",
    "the approximation improves with the increasing dimensionality @xmath52 of the auxiliary hilbert - space @xmath35 .",
    "in addition , with accidental conjugate gradient searches we could obtain local maxima @xmath184 for @xmath185 and @xmath186 for @xmath187 .",
    "these both constitute about @xmath2 relative difference from @xmath183 .",
    "we have to remark however , that as the maximum value of @xmath188 is a conjecture , too , and we can neither fully warrant the global maximum , nor check the @xmath189 case in the numerical framework , we can not exclude the possibility to go beyond @xmath188 .",
    "nevertheless we can prove explicitly that the bound can indeed be obtained in the framework of fcs , even under several restrictions .",
    "further we have checked numerically the possibility of using unitary instead of orthogonal matrices for @xmath141 , and also the application of a more general , non - nilpotent @xmath86 by adding certain elements to its upper diagonal .",
    "we have found for @xmath52 up to @xmath190 that this does not improve the obtained maximal concurrence .",
    "in addition , the so arising @xmath86 was always nilpotent , with numerically the same matrix elements as in eq .",
    ", though eventually ordered in a different form in the matrix .",
    "this supports the assumptions we have made as well as those in ref .",
    "@xcite .    as we explicitly can calculate elements of the nearest neighbour state ( see table [ table2 ] )",
    ", we can ask which final state is approached for enlarging the dimensionality @xmath52 of the auxiliary system . for this we plotted the obtained nearest neighbour density matrices maximizing entanglement in a concurrence versus purity diagram ( see fig .  [ cversusp ] ) . for dimension @xmath187 the relative difference of concurrence and purity of the nearest neighbour state maximizing entanglement and",
    "the maximally entangled mixed state ( mems ) ref .",

    "we have addressed the optimization of entanglement between nearest neighbours in an infinite translational invariant chain in an increasing set of states .",
    "using finitely correlated states with a recursive structure and certain reasonable assumptions we have shown that the nearest neighbour entanglement almost reaches its conjectured upper bound @xmath193 .",
    "our approach allows for an explicit calculation of the elements of the nearest neighbour density matrix maximizing entanglement .",
    "we show that in a concurrence versus purity ( measured by @xmath194 ) diagram the obtained nearest neighbour state seems to approach the maximally entangled mixed states ( mems ) which bound the realizable bipartite states in this diagram .",
    "the approach we have adopted has the same roots as the dmrg methods .",
    "however , instead of using a matrix product form for a state of a finite set of qubits the formalism used provides an exact description of the infinite chain .",
    "the accuracy of the approximation increases with the dimensionality @xmath52 of the auxiliary hilbert space .    for dimension @xmath117 and @xmath135",
    "we have given a detailed analytical treatment of the problem while in higher dimensions we rely on numerical calculations .",
    "apart from the investigation of nearest neighbour entanglement we have evaluated other properties of the chain .",
    "these results support the qualitative expectations that due to the monogamy of entanglement the increase in the nearest neighbour entanglement leads to the decrease in the longer distance quantum correlation .",
    "not only concurrence but also the whole nearest neighbour density matrix tends to reach a given fixed value .",
    "this is , however , not the case with the state of the whole system .",
    "the difference of the concurrence and the concurrence of assistance suggest that some kind of multipartite entanglement is also present .",
