    "supersymmetric integrable systems constitute a subject of current interest , and as a consequence a number of well known integrable equations have been generalized into the supersymmetric ( susy ) context .",
    "we just mention the susy versions of sine - gordon ( @xcite ) , nonlinear schrdinger ( @xcite ) , kp ( @xcite ) , kdv ( @xcite ) and boussinesq ( @xcite ) .",
    "we also point out that there are two different generalizations , namely nonextended ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 being the number of fermionic independent variables ) and extended ( @xmath2 ) generalizations . here",
    "we are mainly interested in the former case .",
    "so far many of the tools used in the standard theory have been extended to this framework , such as bcklund transformations ( @xcite ) , prologation theory ( @xcite ) , hamiltonian formalism ( @xcite ) , grasmmanian description ( @xcite ) , tau function ( @xcite ) , the relationship with super @xmath3 algebras ( @xcite ) , additional symmetries ( @xcite ) , etc ..    however , there is one that only recently has been considered , we are talking about the so called _ darboux transformation _ , that constitutes a very successful tool in the realm of integrable systems whenever one is interested in the constructions of solutions .",
    "the roots of these techniques go back to geometrical studies of the last century .",
    "it was in @xcite , see also @xcite , where the two dimensional schrdinger equation ( as we called it today ) was considered giving new wave functions and potentials from given ones .",
    "this was taken by darboux ( @xcite ) and applied to the one - dimensional case .",
    "in fact these results are connected with the theory of conjugate nets ( @xcite ) and it was in @xcite where a transformation of this type was applied for surfaces , and was iterated in @xcite .",
    "new transformations for conjugate nets appeared in @xcite which were called fundamental in @xcite containing the levy ones in appropriate limits .    in @xcite ,",
    "independently of these geometrical studies , it was presented , for the schrdinger equation , the iteration of the transformation found by darboux , giving compact expressions in terms of wroski determinants .",
    "later on , in @xcite , a _ new _ transformation for soliton equations was introduced .",
    "this tool was rapidly devoloped and it was in @xcite where they were named as darboux transformations .",
    "this name is standard nowadays in the soliton community , however we have seen that is not completely appropriate . in @xcite",
    "a further extension of the darboux transformation was given and some people refer to it as binary or darboux - levi transformation , however this is just the fundamental type transformation mentioned above .",
    "finally , we remark that recently ( @xcite ) a vectorial formulation of the binary darboux transformation was given , allowing compact formulae for the iteration of the darboux transformation , for the nonlinear schrdinger and davey - stewartson equations .",
    "the paper @xcite was the first one that considered darboux transformations for the susy kdv system .",
    "later on ( @xcite ) extensions of the binary darboux transformation ( fundamental transformation in geometry ) and darboux transformation appeared . in this paper",
    "we want to present the susy version of the darboux tranformations .",
    "in particular we will consider three important supersymmetric integrable systems , namely the manin - radul kdv and its reduction to the mathieu kdv , and also the susy extension of the sine - gordon equation .",
    "for the manin - radul kdv and vectorial binary darboux transformations we improve the presentation of @xcite giving the general transformation for wave functions and a permutability theorem . for the mathieu kdv equation we present some technical improvements with respect to @xcite and the part regarding the sine - gordon equation",
    "is entirely new . finally , let us remark that given the character of these proceedings we are not going to give any proof .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows .",
    "we start with the manin - radul kdv ( mrkdv ) by considering the vectorial binary darboux transformations and the construction of solutions in terms of ordinary determinants of grammian type , we also give the iteration of the darboux transformation found in @xcite to get wroski superdeterminantal expressions for the solutions , here we present a genuine supersoliton . in ",
    "3 we study the application of the darboux transformation for the mathieu kdv to the susy sine - gordon equation , presenting a superkink .",
    "the mrkdv system is defined in terms of three independent variables @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is an odd supernumber , and @xmath6 are even supernumbers , and two dependent variables @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is an odd function taking values in @xmath9 and @xmath10 is even function with values in @xmath11 .",
    "a basic ingredient is a superderivation defined by @xmath12 .",
    "the system is @xmath13 where we use the notation @xmath14 and @xmath15 .    the following linear system for the wave function @xmath16 , that takes values in the grassmann algebra @xmath17",
    ", @xmath18 where the spectral parameter @xmath19 is an even supernumber , has as its compatibility condition eqs .",
    "( [ mr ] ) , and therefore it can be considered as a lax pair for ( [ mr ] ) .",
    "the linear system ( [ linear ] ) is of a scalar nature , @xmath19 , @xmath20 .",
    "nevertheless , it is possible to give a vector extension of these linear problem .",
    "indeed , we may replace @xmath21 by an arbitrary linear grassmann space @xmath22 over @xmath21 and take @xmath23 as an @xmath22-valued eigenfunction , then the spectral parameter can be taken as @xmath24 , an even operator .",
    "namely , the linear system @xmath25 has as its compatibility condition the mrkdv system ( [ mr ] ) .",
    "notice that eqs .",
    "( [ mr ] ) are also the compatibility condition of adjoint linear system : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is a linear function on the supervector space @xmath28 , and @xmath29 .    in order to construct darboux transformations for these linear systems",
    "we need to introduce an operator , say @xmath30\\in\\text{l}({\\cal e},\\tilde{\\cal   e})$ ] , bilinear in @xmath31 and @xmath32 , defined by the compatible equations @xmath33=&\\psi\\otimes \\phi , \\\\",
    "v[\\psi,\\phi]_t=&\\ell v[\\psi,\\phi]_x + v[\\psi,\\phi]_xm \\\\&-",
    "d(\\psi_x\\otimes\\phi_x+{1\\over 2}udv[\\psi,\\phi ] ) -{1\\over 4}\\alpha_x dv[\\psi,\\phi]\\\\ & -{1\\over2}(d\\psi)\\otimes((d\\alpha)\\phi-\\alpha ( d\\psi))+{1\\over2}\\alpha(\\psi\\otimes \\phi_x -\\psi_x\\otimes \\phi ) \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] such that @xmath34-v[\\psi,\\phi]m = d(\\psi_x\\otimes\\phi-\\psi\\otimes \\phi_x)- \\alpha \\psi\\otimes \\phi.\\ ] ]    now we are ready to present the following :    let @xmath35 be an even vector satisfying eq .",
    "( [ veclin ] ) with spectral parameter @xmath36 , @xmath37 an odd functional solving eq .",
    "( [ aveclin ] ) with spectral parameter @xmath38 and @xmath39\\in \\text{l}(\\cal v_{\\underline{0}})\\oplus\\text{l}(\\cal v_{\\underline{1}})$ ] a non singular even operator , @xmath40_{\\text{body}}\\neq 0 $ ] , defined in terms of the compatible eqs .",
    "( [ pont ] ) and ( [ constraint ] ) .",
    "then , the objects @xmath41v[\\psi_0,\\phi_0]^{-1}\\psi_0,\\\\ & \\hat{\\phi}:=\\phi-\\phi_0v[\\psi_0,\\phi_0]^{-1}v[\\psi_0,\\phi],\\\\ & \\hat\\alpha=\\alpha-2d^3\\ln\\det v[\\psi_0,\\phi_0],\\\\ & \\hat u = u+2\\hat\\alpha d\\ln\\det v[\\psi_0,\\phi_0]+2\\left ( \\frac{\\sum_{j}d(\\psi_0)_j\\;\\det v[\\psi_0,\\phi_0]_j}{\\det v[\\psi_0,\\phi_0]}\\right)_x,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath39_j$ ] is an operator with associated supermatrix obtained from the corresponding one of @xmath39 $ ] by replacing the @xmath42-th column by @xmath43 , satisfy the eqs .",
    "( [ veclin ] ) and ( [ aveclin ] ) whenever the unhatted variables do .",
    "thus , @xmath44 and @xmath45 are new solutions of the mrkdv ( [ mr ] ) .",
    "moreover , @xmath46=v[\\psi,\\phi]- v[\\psi,\\phi_0]v[\\psi_0,\\phi_0]^{-1}v[\\psi_0,\\phi].\\ ] ]    let us remark that this theorem extends theorem 1 in our paper ( @xcite ) .",
    "in particular we stress the role of the general wave functions @xmath31 and @xmath32 , and also the formula ( [ newv ] ) that gives the path for iteration and it is also deeply connected , in the non susy case , with geometrical objects such as points of the transformed manifolds .    we shall call @xmath47 as transformation data .",
    "the composition of two vectorial darboux transformations yield a new darboux transformation , and as it is shown in next proposition they commute as they can be expressed as a vectorial darboux transformation :    the vectorial darboux transformation with transformation data @xmath48 coincides with the following composition of darboux transformations :    1 .",
    "first transform with data @xmath49 , and denote the transformation by @xmath50 .",
    "2 .   on the result of this transformation",
    "apply a second one with data @xmath51    a similar theorem in a completely different framework , namely discrete integrable systems : multidimensional quadrilateral lattices , appears in @xcite .",
    "a darboux transformation for the mrkdv equation is ( @xcite )    let @xmath31 be a solution of ( [ linear ] ) and @xmath52 be a particular solution with @xmath53 .",
    "then , the quantities defined by @xmath54 satisfy @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are obtained from @xmath58 and @xmath59 by replacing @xmath8 and @xmath10 with @xmath44 and @xmath45 , respectively .    as a consequence of this proposition",
    "we conclude that @xmath45 and @xmath44 are new solutions of the mrkdv system ( [ mr ] ) .",
    "we remark that , as usual , the darboux transformation can be viewed as a gauge transformation : @xmath60    to construct crum type transformation , let us start with @xmath61 solutions @xmath62 , @xmath63 , of equation ( [ linear ] ) with eigenvalues as @xmath64 , @xmath65 . to make sense , we choose the @xmath66 in such way that its index indicates its parity : those with even indices are even and with odd indices are odd variables .",
    "we use @xmath52 to do our first step transformation and then @xmath62 , @xmath67 , are transformed to new solutions @xmath68 $ ] of the transformed linear equation and @xmath52 goes to zero .",
    "next step can be effected by using @xmath69 $ ] to form a darboux operator and at this time @xmath69 $ ] is lost .",
    "we can continue this iteration process until all the seeds are mapped to zero . in this way ,",
    "we have    let @xmath62 , @xmath70 , be solutions of the linear system ( [ linear ] ) with @xmath64 , @xmath71 , and parities @xmath72 , then after @xmath61 iterations of the darboux transformation of proposition 1 , one obtains a new lax operator @xmath73 where the coefficients @xmath74 of the gauge operator @xmath75 are defined by @xmath76    the explicit form of the transformed field variables is given by @xmath77 from where it follows that the new fields @xmath44 and @xmath45 can be written as @xmath78    now , we must recall the reader that the berezinian or superdeterminant of an even matrix , say @xmath79 , is @xmath80    to obtain the explicit expressions , we have to find out the @xmath81 and @xmath81 by solving the linear system ( [ l2 ] ) . in the even case @xmath82 which is most interesting , we have @xmath83 where @xmath84 and @xmath85 and @xmath86 are obtained from the matrices @xmath87 and @xmath88 by replacing the last rows with @xmath89 and @xmath90 , respectively .",
    "it should be noticed that the supermatrix @xmath91 is even and has a wronski type structure .    summarizing the above results",
    ", we now have the following    let @xmath92 be a solution of ( [ mr ] ) and @xmath93 be a set of @xmath94 solutions of the associated linear system ( [ linear ] ) , such that the parity is @xmath95 .",
    "then , we have new solutions @xmath44 , @xmath45 of ( [ mr ] ) given by @xmath96    let us remark that our darboux transformations are useful even outside the mrkdv system .",
    "indeed , the most obvious application is to the susy kp equation ( @xcite ) which is a closed system obtained from supersymmetric kp hierarchy .",
    "since the lax pair is essentially the one we had for mrkdv , our darboux transformations can be used directly in this context .",
    "solutions of the mrkdv are found rarely , see for example @xcite . in @xcite and @xcite",
    "one can find examples of solutions , in particular in @xcite we gave an interesting solution which behaves like a genuine supersoliton .",
    "our solution is @xmath97 with @xmath98 where @xmath99 here @xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 , @xmath103 are supernumbers with parities indicated by the superfix .",
    "notice that our solution can be understood as a supersoliton which has the kdv soliton , @xmath104 , as its body , and that the choice @xmath105 and @xmath106 gives the solution found in @xcite .",
    "in the figures we plot , in the real @xmath107-@xmath108 plane , the functions @xmath109 , @xmath110 and @xmath111 that appear in the construction of the solution corresponding to the data : @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 , @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "the mathieu kdv equation reads ( @xcite ) @xmath117 which is obtained from ( [ mr ] ) by setting @xmath118 , being the lax operator @xmath119 in @xcite one of the authors presented a preliminary version of      compared with the result of @xcite , the above proposition is an improved version in the sense that the constant @xmath125 has a much simpler structure .",
    "an application of this darboux transformation is to the supersymmetric sine - gordon system , which reads ( @xcite ) @xmath126 where @xmath127 and @xmath128 is another grassmann odd variable .",
    "if @xmath139 is a solution of the susy sine - gordon equation ( [ sg ] ) and @xmath140 and @xmath141 are particular solutions of ( [ sg1 ] ) and ( [ sg2 ] ) with spectral parameter @xmath53 , such that @xmath142 , then @xmath143 is a new solution of ( [ sg ] ) .      1 .",
    "the method we used is a generalization of the one by @xcite for the classical sine - gordon equation .",
    "we also notice that this idea was used in @xcite for the two - dimensional sine - gordon equation of konopelchenko and rogers .",
    "2 .   we may also obtain darboux type transformations for the susy modified kdv equation ( @xcite ) .",
    "we conjecture that crum type iteration of the above darboux transformation will be represented in terms of pfaffians instead of wronskians .",
    "the application of this theorem to the most simple case , namely @xmath144 yields the following interesting susy extension of the kink solution .",
    "namely , we have the following solution @xmath145 where @xmath146 with @xmath147 and @xmath148 even supernumbers with nonvanishing body , @xmath149 and @xmath150 an odd supernumber .",
    "this solution can be thought as a superkink , in fact its body is @xmath151 that after taking the appropriate wick rotation goes into the standard kink solution of the sine - gordon equation . obviously , the soul of this solution is far from trivial .",
