    "our analysis was based on the combination of the radio observations from westerbork northern sky survey ( wenss ; * ? ? ?",

    "this spectral property was also used in the past for the associations of @xmath0-ray sources since the egret era ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , despite a small survey of bl lac objects at 102 mhz @xcite , the low radio frequency spectral behavior of blazars was still an unexplored region of the electromagnetic spectrum until our recent analyses @xcite .",
    "using wsrt data at 325 mhz and at 352 mhz as well as those of very low - frequency observations of the very large array low - frequency sky survey ( vlss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) at 74 mhz we showed that blazars maintain a flat radio spectrum even below @xmath1100 mhz and we extended the radio-@xmath0-ray connection below @xmath11 ghz @xcite .",
    "thus , motivated by these recent results we assembled a catalog of low - frequency flat spectrum radio sources using the combination of both the wenss and the wish surveys with the nvss .",

    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : survey ] we briefly present the main properties of the low - frequency radio survey performed by wsrt and used to carry out our investigation ( i.e. , the wenss and the wish ) . in section  [ sec : radius ] we search for the nvss counterparts of wsrt sources . then in section  [ sec : catalog ] we extract the main low - frequency catalog of flat spectrum radio sources ( lorcat ) from the combined wsrt - nvss surveys and we discuss on its main properties .",
    "section  [ sec : cross ] is devoted to the comparison the green bank 6-cm ( gb6 ) radio source catalog ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "finally , section  [ sec : conclusions ] is dedicated to the summary and the conclusions .    for our numerical results ,",
    "we use cgs units unless stated otherwise spectral indices , @xmath2 , are defined by flux density , s@xmath3 .",
    "the wsrt catalogs used to carry out our analysis are available from both the heasarc@xmath4 and the vizier@xmath4 databases as well as that of the nvss@xmath4 .",
    "the westerbork northern sky survey ( wenss ) is a low - frequency radio survey that covers the northern sky above + 30  in declination performed at 325 mhz to a limiting flux density of @xmath118 mjy at 5 sigma level @xcite .",
    "the version of the wenss catalog used in our analysis was implemented as a combination of two separate catalogs obtained from the wenss website : the wenss polar catalog that comprises 18186 sources above + 72  in declination and the wenss main catalog including 211234 objects in the declination range between + 28  and + 76 .",
    "we also used the westerbork in the southern hemisphere ( wish ) catalog that is the southern extension of the wenss .",
    "wish is a low - frequency ( 352 mhz ) radio survey covering most of the sky between -26and -9  at 352 mhz to the same limiting flux density of the wenss .",
    "it is worth noticing that the galactic plane region at galactic latitudes @xmath510  are excluded from the wish observations . due to the very low elevation of the observations ,",
    "the survey has a much lower resolution in declination than in right ascension .",
    "a correlation with the nvss shows that the positional accuracy is less constrained in declination than in right ascension , but there is no significant systematic error ( see * ? ? ? * for more details ) .",
    "finally , we highlight that the wish catalog contains multiple observations of the same source for many objects as well as measurements of individual components of multi - component sources .",
    "we adopted the following statistical approach to find the radio nvss counterparts at 1.4 ghz for the sources in the wsrt low radio frequency surveys , namely : the wenss and the wish .    for each radio source listed in either the wenss and the wish surveys , we searched for all the nvss counterparts that lie within elliptical regions that corresponds to the positional uncertainty at 95% level of confidence ( i.e. , 2@xmath6 ) .",
    "we took into account the uncertainties on both the right ascension , @xmath2 , and the declination , @xmath7 , in the wsrt and in the nvss surveys .",
    "we found that the total number of correspondences is 225933 out of 268425 radio sources included in either the wsrt surveys .",
    "we excluded from our analysis all the wsrt source with radio analysis flags ( i.e. , p and y as reported in the wenss and wish catalog , respectively , to indicate that there were problems in the model fitting for a source ) and variability flag in the wish observations , all the double matches and all those sources labeled as components of a multi - component source ( flag  c \" ) in the wsrt catalogs .",
    "in addition , for this version of the lorcat catalog , we also excluded from our sample 2707 multiple matches since their wsrt radio flux densities could be due to the emission of several , unresolved , nvss sources so contaminating our estimates of the low frequency spectral index .",
    "we then built 100 mock realizations of the wsrt catalog by shifting each source position in a random direction of the sky by a fixed length of 1 .",
    "this shift adopted to create the mock wsrt catalogs were chosen not too distant from the original wsrt position and within the nvss footprint so to obtain fake catalogs with a sky distribution similar to the original wsrt and to perform the cross - match with each fake catalog and the nvss taking into account the local density distribution of the wsrt radio sources .",
    "the total number of wsrt sources in each mock realization is also preserved .    for each mock realization of the wsrt catalog",
    ", we counted the number of associations with the nvss occurring at angular separations @xmath8 smaller than 300 .",
    "then we computed the mean number @xmath9 of these mock associations , averaged over the 100 fake wsrt catalogs and verifying that @xmath9 has a poissonian distribution . increasing the radius by @xmath105",
    ", we also computed the difference @xmath11 as : @xmath12    in figure  [ fig : delta ] we show the comparison between @xmath13 and @xmath11 .",
    "for radii larger than @xmath1495the @xmath11 curve superimposes that of @xmath13 indicating that wsrt - nvss cross - matches could occur by chance at angular separations larger than @xmath15 .",
    "thus we choose @xmath15 as to the maximum angular separation between the wsrt and the nvss position to consider the 1.4ghz radio source a reliable counterpart of a wsrt object .",
    "in addition we calculated the chance probability of spurious associations @xmath16 as the ratio between the number of real associations @xmath17 and the average of those found in the mock realizations of the wsrt catalog @xmath9 , corresponding to a value of @xmath110% for @xmath18 ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for a similar procedure to estimate the probability of spurious associations ) .",
    "we then computed the uncertainties on the wsrt positions according to the procedure described in rengelink et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and combined them with the nvss ones @xcite using the following relation : @xmath19    we also defined the angular separation normalized to the values of the positional uncertainties @xmath20 as : @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the angular separations in right ascension and in declination , respectively . in figure",
    "[ fig : posunchist ] we show the distributions of the ratio between the angular separation @xmath8 and the combined positional uncertainty @xmath6 for ra and dec , respectively .    in order to build the final sample of wsrt - nvss correspondences that will be used to extract the low - frequency radio catalog of flat spectrum sources , we selected only sources with @xmath24 .",
    "this wsrt - nvss final sample lists 224438 radio sources out of 225933 previously selected .",
    "we note that we found a potential nvss counterpart for about 85% of the wsrt sources , and since we adopted a threshold on @xmath253 , this corresponds to a completeness @xmath26 of about 80% , evaluated according to the relations described in condon et al .",
    "( 1975 ) .",
    "moreover , this is also in agreement with the reliability of our associations , estimated via monte carlo simulations , occurring at @xmath15 that is of the order to 10% ( see figure  [ fig : delta ] ) .",
    "for the wsrt - nvss associations we defined a low - frequency radio spectral index : @xmath27 , using the integrated flux densities at 325 mhz from the wenss and those at 352 mhz reported in the wish , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively , in combination with the nvss @xmath30 at 1.4 ghz as : @xmath31 where the @xmath32 factor is equal to 1.58 and 1.67 ( i.e. , @xmath33^{-1}$ ] and @xmath34^{-1}$ ] ) for the wenss and the wish surveys , respectively , @xmath35 is the flux density at 325 mhz ( wenss ) or at 352 mhz ( wish ) with all flux densities in units of mjy . the uncertainties on @xmath27 where computed according to the following relation : @xmath36 where the @xmath37 factor is equal to 0.68 and 0.72 ( i.e. , @xmath38^{-1 } \\mid$ ] and @xmath39^{-1 } \\mid$ ] ) for the wenss and the wish surveys , respectively while @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the uncertainties on the wsrt and nvss flux densities .    in radio astronomy",
    "it is conventional to indicate flat spectrum radio sources as those with a two - point spectral index @xmath420 or typically lower than 0.5 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the origin of these thresholds reside in the distribution of the two - point spectral indices measured between @xmath11.4 ghz and @xmath15 ghz for a number of flux - limited source samples @xcite .",
    "as shown in these analyses , the ( unnormalized ) spectral - index distributions consist of a narrow steep - spectrum component with @xmath420.7 and a broader flat - spectrum component centered on @xmath420 . as the sample selection frequency",
    "is lowered , the number of steep - spectrum sources increases rapidly and the median spectral indices of both components increase ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as reported by kellermann et al .",
    "( 1964 ) , the increase in @xmath43 of each spectral component is proportional to the square of its width , so the median spectral index of the flat - spectrum component changes more rapidly with frequency .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : distalfas ] , even considering three or more flux limited subsample of the wsrt - nvss associated sources , we were not able to identify a bimodal behavior in the spectral index distribution of @xmath27 .",
    "this , in addition to the frequency dependence highlighted by kellerman ( 1964 ) , suggest that a different criterion has to be chosen to indicate flat spectrum radio sources at low frequencies .",
    "we noticed that both blazars and _ fermi _  blazars detected in the wenss show values of @xmath27 between -1 and 0.65 for the largest fraction of their samples @xcite .",
    "specifically , in our previous analysis we considered low - frequency flat spectrum radio sources as those having @xmath440.65 .",
    "this occurred for 90% of the blazars detected by _",
    "fermi_and for more than 80% of those listed in the roma - bzcat  @xcite .",
    "however , to assemble the lorcat , we adopted a more conservative threshold based on the following statistical criterion .",
    "first we established the number of blazars and _ fermi _  blazars that we expect to find within this subsample simply performing the crossmatch with the roma - bzcat  within 8.5 as adopted in our previous analysis .",
    "we found that the number of expected blazars with a wsrt counterpart is 979 , including 274 _ fermi _  blazars .",
    "for a given value of the threshold @xmath45 , we defined the fractional efficiency @xmath46 as the ratio between the difference of total number of sources having : @xmath47 and those with @xmath48 and the total number of expected sources @xmath49 within the wsrt - nvss associations with -1@xmath500.7 : @xmath51 where @xmath52= 0.1 .",
    "in particular , @xmath46 has been computed for all blazars ( i.e. , @xmath53 ) , the subsample of _ fermi _  blazars ( i.e. , @xmath54 ) with -1@xmath500.7 ( see figure  [ fig : threshold ] ) .",
    "since the main goal underlying the lorcat is to have a catalog of potential counterparts for the ugss , we chose the @xmath550.4 threshold as the value corresponding to the peak of the @xmath54 . according to the above threshold",
    "the total number of low - frequency sources with a flat radio spectrum listed in the lorcat is 28358 having -1@xmath500.40 . adopting",
    "the above criterion on the choice of the @xmath56threshold the lorcat catalog will be less complete .",
    "however , the selected low frequency flat spectrum radio sources are more reliable to be @xmath0-ray blazar candidates since this criterion ensures to avoid the heavy contamination by steep spectrum radio sources .    in figure",
    "[ fig : threshold ] we also show the completeness @xmath57 of the sample considered above defined as the ratio between the total number of sources with our criterion is then supported by the comparison at high - frequency described in section  [ sec : cross ] .",
    "( @xmath47 ) and the total number of expected sources : @xmath58 thus we noticed that for our choice of @xmath550.4 we are able to re - associate 80% of the _ fermi _  blazars of all blazars listed in the wsrt - nvss with @xmath27 between -1 and 0.65 @xcite .     in table",
    "[ tab : lorcat ] we listed all lorcat sources with their wsrt and nvss names .",
    "for all these  sources we also report the nvss coordinates , the angular separation @xmath8 between the nvss and the wsrt positions , the @xmath27 value with its uncertainty @xmath41 and the wsrt survey name which each original source belong to : wish or wenss .",
    "finally , we note that , as found by our previous analysis ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the source density of the lorcat sources is @xmath11.8 src / deg@xmath59 , given the total 4.7 sr of footprint of the combined wenss - wish survey ( 3.1 sr in the wenss plus 1.6 sr in the wish ) while according to the roma - bzcat  the blazar density is currently of the order of 0.1 src / deg@xmath59 .",
    "so we can expect that only about 10% of the sources in the lorcat are blazar - like , however , to confirm this insight optical spectroscopic observations and high frequency radio data are necessary .",
    "moreover , since the roma - bzcat  is not a survey and it is not a complete catalog , the above estimate on the expected fraction of blazars present in the lorcat has to be considered carefully .",

    "in addition they also appear to be `` flat '' spectrum radio sources above @xmath11 ghz , according to the canonical definition ( i.e. , @xmath680.5 ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein )",
    ". the lack of detections for a small fraction of the lorcat sources in the gb6 footprint could be explained in terms of a spectral steeping toward high frequencies ( i.e. , a mild curvature ) as already observed in blazars .",
    "finally , we highlight that to investigate the nature of the lorcat sources , aiming to identify the fraction of @xmath0-ray blazar candidates associable to _ fermi _  sources , a detailed analysis of the ir and optical properties is necessary .",

    "<S> observations is the presence of radio counterparts , in particular for those associated to extragalactic objects . </S>",
    "<S> this observational evidence is the basis of the radio-@xmath0-ray connection established for the class of active galactic nuclei known as blazars . in particular , </S>",
    "<S> the main spectral property of the radio counterparts associated with @xmath0-ray blazars is that they show a flat spectrum in the ghz frequency range . </S>",
    "<S> our recent analysis dedicated to search blazar - like candidates as potential counterparts for the unidentified @xmath0-ray sources ( ugss ) allowed us to extend the radio-@xmath0-ray connection in the mhz regime . </S>",
    "<S> we also showed that below 1 ghz blazars maintain flat radio spectra . </S>",
    "<S> thus on the basis of these new results , we assembled a low - frequency radio catalog of flat spectrum sources built by combining the radio observations of the westerbork northern sky survey ( wenss ) and of the westerbork in the southern hemisphere ( wish ) catalog with those of the nrao very large array sky survey ( nvss ) . </S>",
    "<S> this could be used in the future to search for new , unknown blazar - like counterparts of the @xmath0-ray sources . </S>",
    "<S> first we found nvss counterparts of wsrt radio sources and then we selected flat spectrum radio sources according to a new spectral criterion specifically defined for radio observations performed below 1 ghz . </S>",
    "<S> we also described the main properties of the catalog listing 28358 radio sources and their logn - logs distributions . </S>",
    "<S> finally a comparison with with the green bank 6-cm radio source catalog has been performed to investigate the spectral shape of the low - frequency flat spectrum radio sources at higher frequencies . </S>"
