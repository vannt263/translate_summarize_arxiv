    "planetary magnetic fields are generated by the dynamo effect , the process that provides for a transfer of kinetic energy from a flow of a conducting fluid into magnetic energy .",
    "usually , it is assumed that these flows are driven by thermal and/or chemical convection but other mechanisms are possible as well . in particular , precessional forcing due to ( regular ) temporal changes of the orientation of earth s rotation axis has long been discussed as a complementary power source for the geodynamo @xcite .",
    "the basic principle of a fluid flow driven dynamo has been successfully demonstrated in three different experimental configurations , all of which using a more or less artificial flow driving @xcite .",
    "further progress is expected from present and future dynamo experiments like the madison plasma dynamo experiment ( mpdx , @xcite , the liquid metal spherical couette experiment at the university of maryland @xcite or the planned precession dynamo experiment that will be designed in the framework of the liquid sodium facility dresdyn ( dresden sodium facility for dynamo and thermohydraulic studies , @xcite ) .",
    "precession driven dynamos were found in simulations with a critical magnetic reynolds number of the order of 1000 in a sphere @xcite , cylinder @xcite , spheroid @xcite , ellipsoid @xcite , and cube @xcite .",
    "experimentally , a precessing magnetohydrodynamical flow has been examined by r. gans @xcite in a cylinder with height @xmath1 , rotating with @xmath2 and precessing with @xmath3 ( thus yielding a precession ratio of @xmath4 ) . in these experiments an externally applied magnetic field",
    "was amplified by a factor of @xmath5 but the magnetic reynolds number of this setup remains to small to cross the dynamo threshold . in order to achieve the required large magnetic reynolds number indicated by the above listed numerical studies ,",
    "the scheduled precession dynamo experiment at hzdr must represent a greatly enlarged version of this previous setup making the construction of the experiment a challenge .    .",

    "in contrast to previous dynamo experiments no internal blades , propellers or complex systems of guiding tubes will be used for the optimization of the flow properties .",
    "a small scale water experiment is in operation in order to investigate the essential operation parameters for the liquid metal experiment , such as gyroscopic moments and associated load for the foundation , motor power consumption , typical flow pattern and flow amplitude ( figure  [ fig::exp2 ] ) .",
    "this experiment is intended to supplement previous studies that were conducted as part of the french ater experiment @xcite .",
    "most probably , the precession driven flow will be less suitable for dynamo action than the flow in highly optimized setups used in the dynamo experiments in riga , karlsruhe or cadarache . in order to narrow suitable parameter regimes that may allow for dynamo action flow properties",
    "are estimated in dependence of precession angle @xmath13 , precession ratio @xmath14 and reynolds number @xmath15 .",
    "these properties will be included in kinematic simulations of the induction equation which are used to estimate the ability of different flow fields to provide for dynamo action .        in the water experiment",
    "axial velocity profiles at different radial positions were measured using _ ultrasonic doppler velocimetry _ ( udv ) .",
    "first results confirm observations of @xcite that precession provides an efficient flow forcing mechanism which yields bulk flow speeds of the order of one fifth to one third of the rotation speed of the container . in the liquid metal experiment",
    "this will correspond to flow velocities of up to @xmath16 so that a rather violent flow is expected .",
    "based on the rotation speed of the cylinder at @xmath17 , and the diffusivity of liquid sodium ( @xmath18 at @xmath19 ) , we expect magnetic reynolds numbers of @xmath20 which is rather close to the critical @xmath21 reported by @xcite from simulations of dynamo action in a precessing cylinder .",
    "the most striking feature in the water experiment is an abrupt transition at a critical precession ratio @xmath22 from a laminar state to a disordered chaotic behavior ( see figure  [ fig::picprecession ] ) .",

    "a vague evidence for such a transition in the simulations occurs only at significantly larger @xmath38 .",
    "this is indicated in figure  [ fig::streamlines ] where the rotation axis of the bulk flow has changed its orientation from roughly parallel to the symmetry axis of the container ( left panel ) to a perpendicular direction ( aligned with the precession axis , right panel ) .    ) and strong precessional forcing ( right , @xmath39 ) .",
    "note the bulk flow rotating around the precession axis in the latter case.,scaledwidth=97.5% ]    the change of the orientation of the fluid axis is much less obvious ( abrupt ) in the simulation than in the water experiment which may be due to the much larger @xmath40 in the experiment .",
    "in the following we concentrate on the more laminar regime with the main fluid rotation axis oriented ( more or less ) parallel to the container symmetry axis .",

    "so far the kinematic simulations performed within this study did not show dynamo action .",
    "reasons for this might be the simplistic structure of the flow which is close to the fundamental kelvin mode in the low @xmath40 regime or restricted to regions close to the boundaries for larger @xmath40 ( but still dominated by @xmath23 ) .",
    "the behavior of the growth rates confirms the results from @xcite where it was shown that inertial waves can not drive a dynamo .",
    "however , our simulations were restricted to parameter regimes with quite low reynolds number whereas the experiment will be characterized by @xmath65 and we expect an emergence of more complex flow structures for more realistic parameters .",
    "two promising candidates are already known from which we expect an improvement of the ability of the flow to drive a dynamo .",

    "a subclass of these modes have a close similarity to the columnar convection rolls that are responsible for dynamo action in geodynamo models and there is little reason to believe that this should not be the case with a precession driven flow field .",
    "the second possibility relies on observations of cyclones in the french precession experiment ater @xcite . in that experiment large scale vortex - like structures",
    "emerge for intermediate precession ratios .",
    "these vortices are oriented along the rotation axis of the cylindrical container , and , depending on the parameter regime , their number varies between one and four ( figure  [ fig::cyclones ] ) .",
    "the vortices are cyclonic , i.e. , their sense of rotation is determined by the rotation orientation of the cylindrical container .",
    "we suspect that these vortices provide a significant amount of helicity , but so far , the axial dependence of their contribution and their interaction with the fundamental m=1 mode is unknown .",
    "furthermore , cyclones were neither observed in the hzdr experiment ( so far , no appropriate velocity measurements in a horizontal plane are available ) nor in any simulations which probably must run at much higher reynolds number in order to reveal these modes ."
