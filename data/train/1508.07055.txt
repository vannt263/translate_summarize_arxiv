    "one of the most intriguing theoretical results in quantum field theory ( qft henceforth ) has been the realization that fermions can emerge out of purely bosonic lagrangians as solitonic excitations ( for a detailed review see @xcite ) . the clearest demonstration that the importance of this result goes far beyond pure theoretical physics",
    "is given by the skyrme theory @xcite which is one of the most important models of nuclear and particle physics .",
    "the skyrme term @xcite allows the existence of static soliton solutions with finite energy , called",
    "_ skyrmions _ ( see   @xcite ) describing fermionic degrees of freedom ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the wide range of applications of the theory in other areas ( such as astrophysics , bose - einstein condensates , nematic liquids , multi - ferric materials , chiral magnets and condensed matter physics in general @xcite ) is well recognized by now .",
    "it is also worth to emphasize that the skyrme model appears in a very natural way in the context of the ads / cft correspondence @xcite .    from the point of view of nuclear physics , it is very important to have analytic tools allowing to analyse the skyrme model when interacting skyrmions are present within bounded regions .",
    "this case is relevant whenever one wants to take into account the effects of the finite size on the topological properties of the skyrmions themselves .",
    "it is commonly believed that many - nucleons systems ( such as the ones occurring in nuclear pasta @xcite ; for a review see @xcite ) are completely out of reach of the analytical techniques provided by soliton theory already in the @xmath4 case ( while , at a first glance , the @xmath5 case is even worse ) . in particular ,",
    "the task to compute physical parameters of such multi - nucleon systems with analytic multi - skyrmionic configurations is believed to be completely hopeless .",
    "recently , the generalized hedgehog ansatz in the @xmath4 case , introduced in @xcite , allowed the construction of the first multi - skyrmions at finite volume : namely , the first exact solutions of the skyrme model representing interacting elementary skyrmions with a non - trivial winding number , in which finite - volume effects can be explicitly taken into account ( arriving at a good prediction for the compression modulus ) , was obtained @xcite . the way to do",
    "this is to write the system in a modified  cylinder - like \" metric whose curvature is parametrized by a length @xmath6 .",
    "then multi - skyrmionic configurations look like necklaces of elementary skyrmions interacting in bounded tube - shaped regions .",
    "the ground state of such multi - skyrmions has the remarkable property that , although the bps bound in terms of the winding can not be saturated , a new topological charge exists which leads to a different bps bound , which can instead be saturated .    in this paper , we consider the @xmath5 case . a very powerful technique to construct multi - skyrmionic configurations in unbounded regions is given by an ansatz for @xmath5 skyrmions introduced in @xcite and @xcite , based on harmonic maps of @xmath0 into @xmath1 , which allowed the construction of many interesting numerical multi - skyrmionic configurations .",
    "here we will exploit the fact that the metric we use is spherically symmetric , just like flat space , so the harmonic map ansatz can be used also in the present case without modifications .",
    "we shall see that in the new metric the equations simplify with respect to those studied in @xcite and @xcite ; in particular they become autonomous , thus techniques from dynamical systems theory become available . thanks to the choice of the background geometry , a novel type of large @xmath2 limit becomes possible in which @xmath2 is large and the curvature is small in such a way that their product is constant . in this way",
    "one can see that both the effects of the curvature become negligible and the field equations remain autonomous ( so that , in such a limit , one can kill the curvature of the metric but keeping all the advantages of the technique of @xcite ) .",
    "it is also worth to emphasize that it is precisely the large @xmath2 limit which discloses in the clearest possible way the role of the skyrme model as low energy limit of qcd . a non constructive proof of the existence of such nontrivial solutions is also provided and a few numerical solutions are exhibited as well .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in the second section , the @xmath4 case treated in @xcite will be briefly reviewed in order to set the stage . in the third section",
    ", the ansatz for the skyrmions will be described . in the fourth section ,",
    "the general equations of motion are written down and the flat - large @xmath2 limit is discussed .",
    "in the fifth section , we study the system using techniques from the theory of dynamical systems ; in particular , the stability of the fixed points in the @xmath7 case is analyzed , and their dependence on the geometric t hooft parameter is discussed . in the sixth section , some nontrivial numerical solution of the equations of motion in the @xmath8 case will be studied . in the seventh section , some conclusions will be drawn . in the appendix ,",
    "it is proved on general grounds that the equations of motion do have nontrivial solutions which can be interpreted as genuine @xmath5 skyrmions .",
    "in this section , the construction of analytic multi - skyrmionic configurations in the @xmath4 case @xcite will be shortly reviewed .",
    "the action of the four  dimensional skyrme model is given by @xmath9   \\   , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the planck constant and the speed of light have been set to @xmath10 , and @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the coupling constants .",
    "the @xmath13 s are the generators of the flavor group , which in this section is @xmath4 .",
    "notice that we allowed for curved metrics .",
    "the coupling constants @xmath11 and @xmath12 are related to the couplings @xmath14 and @xmath15 used in @xcite . ] by @xmath16 the non - linear sigma model term of the skyrme action is necessary to take into account pions .",
    "the second term is the only covariant term leading to a well - defined hamiltonian formalism in time which supports the existence of skyrmions .",
    "the field equations following from the above action are @xmath17=0 . \\label{nonlinearsigma1}\\ ] ]    the following standard parametrization of the @xmath4-valued scalar @xmath18 will be adopted@xmath19 where @xmath20 is the @xmath21 identity matrix ; to describe a spherically symmetric field configuration we use the hedgehog ansatz @xcite:@xmath22@xmath23    in order to mimic finite - volume effects without loosing the nice properties of the hedgehog ansatz we will consider the following curved background , but this has already been considered in @xcite . the geometry in eq .",
    "( [ metric ] ) was considered in @xcite but with a motivation different from the analysis of finite - volume effects .",
    "consequently , the main results obtained in @xcite ( the derivation of both a novel bps bound which can be saturated and analytic multi - skyrmions at finite volume and an explicit formula for the compression modulus in good agreement with experiments ) are indeed novel . ]",
    "@xmath24@xmath25 where @xmath26 is the length of the @xmath27interval .",
    "the total volume of space is @xmath28 .",
    "this geometry describes three - dimensional cylinders whose sections are @xmath0 spheres , so that parameter @xmath6 plays the role of the ( finite ) diameter of the transverse sections of the tube .",
    "the fact that this parameter replaces the radial variable @xmath29 in the metric also leads , as we will see , to considerable simplification of the equations of motion , even allowing to find exact solutions in the @xmath4 case .",
    "moreover , the curvature of this metric is proportional to @xmath30 . as it will be explained in the next sections , the explicit presence of this parameter in eq .",
    "( [ metric ] ) together with the @xmath2 of @xmath5 allows to define a smooth flat limit in which @xmath31 and so all the effects of the curvature disappear ( however , the global topology  of space remains cylindrical even in the flat limit and so it differs from the trivial @xmath32 topology of flat static _ unbounded _",
    "skyrmions ) .",
    "thus , in a sense , the above metric is introduced just as a  regulator \" whose local effects can be removed at the end . in the present context , ",
    "flat limit \" really means @xmath33 so that , from the practical point of view , already when @xmath6 is around @xmath34 @xmath35 all the effects of the curvature are negligible and , consequently , even in the flat limit in eq .",
    "( [ flatl2 ] ) finite volume effects will not disappear .",
    "it is also worth to emphasize that the well known result that elementary skyrmions should be quantized as fermions ( which originally was derived on flat spaces ) has been extended to space - times with compact orientable three - dimensional spatial sections in @xcite ( and the metric in eq .",
    "( [ metric ] ) belongs to this class ) .    since , at the end , we will be interested in the flat limit in eq .",
    "( [ flatl2 ] ) , one may wonder whether it would be possible to start from the very beginning with a flat metric .",
    "in fact , as it has been shown in @xcite , the background metric in eq .",
    "( [ metric ] ) is a very suitable tool to take into account finite volume effects ( since the total spatial volume is finite ) without breaking relevant symmetries of the hedgehog ansatz , with the additional advantage of simplifying the field equations .",
    "a further relevant advantage of the above background metric is that , unlike what happens in the usual unbounded case , it allows to define in a very transparent way a smooth large @xmath2 limit of the @xmath5 skyrmions .",
    "therefore , it is much more convenient to analyze the skyrme theory first within the background metric in eq .",
    "( [ metric ] ) , and take the flat limit only later .",
    "the effectiveness of such a choice for the metric is also shown by the results in @xcite and @xcite in which it has been shown that , unlike what happens in flat space , the equations for the yang - mills - higgs system ( in the sector with non - vanishing non - abelian electric and magnetic charges ) possess analytic solutions even in the case in which the higgs coupling is non - zero .    with the above ansatz the skyrme field equations reduce in the static case to the following scalar differential equation for the skyrmion profile @xmath36 @xcite : @xmath37   \\right )   = 0\\ ] ]    the winding number @xmath38 for such a configuration reads:@xmath39 in the present case",
    ", the natural boundary conditions correspond to the choice:@xmath40 and with these boundary conditions the winding number takes the integer value @xmath41 .",
    "these boundary conditions are unique in that they ensure @xmath42 , which correspond to bosonic and fermionic states for even and odd @xmath41 , respectively .",
    "smooth solutions exist for any @xmath41 satisfying the above boundary conditions for a finite range @xmath43 .",
    "in particular multi - soliton solutions exist , which represent skyrmions with winding number @xmath41 living in a finite spatial volume @xmath28 .",
    "it is worth to remark that the large @xmath41 limit in the present context is quite natural in order to consider thermodynamical properties of the multi - skyrmions system and @xmath41 is the baryon number : obviously , a thermodynamical analysis only makes sense in the cases in which the number of particles is very large .",
    "now we switch to the @xmath5 case with generic @xmath2 .",
    "our analysis will be based on the techniques introduced in @xcite , which we shall now briefly describe .",
    "the hedgehog ansatz for @xmath5 spherically symmetric skyrmions living in flat minkowski metric @xmath44 is based on a suitable family of projectors from @xmath0 into @xmath1  ( see @xcite ) . such projectors @xmath45 can be written as @xmath46 where @xmath47 is an @xmath2-component complex vector of two complex variables @xmath48 and @xmath49 which locally parametrize @xmath0 , where @xmath50 , and @xmath51 . the first @xmath52 is constructed with a holomorphic @xmath53 while the gram - schmidt procedure gives rise to the others . indeed , @xmath54 can be found by its action on any vector @xmath55 @xcite as @xmath56 consequently , the other vectors @xmath57 are determined inductively : @xmath58 .",
    "thus the operator @xmath59 corresponding to the family of vectors @xmath60 ( for @xmath61 ) reads @xmath62 where , due to the orthogonality of the projectors , we have @xmath63 .    due to the holomorphy of @xmath64 , the following identities of the above defined vectors can be proved @xcite : @xmath65 &   \\partial_{\\bar{\\xi}}|v_{k}\\rangle= -|v_{k-1}\\rangle\\frac{|v_{k}|^{2}}{|v_{k-1}|^{2}},\\hspace{5mm}\\hspace{5mm}\\partial_{\\xi}\\left (   \\frac { |v_{k-1}\\rangle}{|v_{k-1}|^{2}}\\right )   = \\frac{|v_{k}\\rangle}{|v_{k-1}|^{2}}. \\label{aaa}\\ ] ] for @xmath5 the components of @xmath66 , up to an irrelevant overall factor which cancels in the projector , are functions of only @xmath49 .    the @xmath5 hedgehog ansatz defined in @xcite reads then@xmath67 where we defined @xmath68 .",
    "such an ansatz involves the introduction of @xmath69 projectors and of @xmath69 profile functions @xmath70 , @xmath71 ; .",
    "note that the projector @xmath72 is not included in the above formula since it is a linear combination of the others .",
    "one of the main results in @xcite and @xcite has been to show that the above ansatz in eq .",
    "( [ ansatzsu(n ) ] ) , when inserted into the full skyrme field equations in the case in which the background metric is the standard flat metric in spherical coordinates in eq . ( [ flat ] ) , gives rise to a consistent set of @xmath69 coupled non - linear differential equations for the @xmath69 profiles @xmath73 .",
    "moreover , such field equations can also be derived as stationary equations for the energy functional with respect to variations of the profiles .",
    "a close inspection of the computations in @xcite shows that the main requirement in order for the ansatz to work is the @xmath74 invariance of the background metric .",
    "this then suggests that the above ansatz may also work in the finite - volume metric in eq .",
    "( [ metric ] ) adopted in @xcite .",
    "this is what we show in the next section .",
    "in this section we switch back to the finite - volume @xmath74-invariant metric in eq .",
    "( [ metric ] ) .",
    "a direct computation shows that the ansatz in eq .",
    "( [ ansatzsu(n ) ] ) , when inserted into the full skyrme field equations in this metric gives rise to a consistent system of @xmath69 coupled _ autonomous _ non - linear differential equations for the @xmath69 profiles @xmath73 which is simpler than the flat _ non - autonomous _ system analyzed in @xcite as it will be now discussed .",
    "furthermore , also in the present case the field equations can be derived as stationary equations for the energy functional with respect to variations of the @xmath75 s .",
    "it is worth emphasizing here that the explicit presence of the parameters @xmath2 and @xmath76 allows to consider a flat large @xmath2 limit in which the curvature is negligible and the product @xmath77 remains constant .",
    "hence , the present formalism is also relevant for people only interested in the skyrme model on flat space - times .",
    "it is important to notice that in such a flat limit , while the effects of the curvature of the metric in eq.([metric ] ) disappear , _ the effects of the cylindrical topology do not_.    from now on we shall use the following energy @xmath78   $ ] and length @xmath79   $ ] units:@xmath80    &   = \\frac{f_{\\pi}}{4e}\\approx1\\ gev\\ ,",

    "another important point is that when the parameter @xmath6 is very large the field equations ( [ equ(n ) ] ) tend to linear equations , on the other hand when @xmath6 is small the nonlinear terms become very important .",
    "thus , this parameter ( more precisely , the quantity @xmath88 ) controls the nonlinearity of the theory , and thus it plays the rle of an additional coupling constant .",
    "all the analyses we shall perform in the following will confirm the fact that the physics of the model crucially depends on it . more precisely ,",
    "both the numerical analysis of sect .",
    "[ numsol ] and the existence theorem of the appendix tell us that the global properties of the solutions of the system depend on the dimensionless parameter @xmath89 , which controls the shape of the cylinder .    by comparing the present total energy in eq .",
    "( [ enersu(n ) ] ) and the field equations in eq . ( [ equ(n ) ] ) with the corresponding expressions in @xcite , the first of the advantages mentioned above in working within the metric in eq . ( [ metric ] )",
    "is apparent .",
    "namely , the field equations become an autonomous system which can , as such , be analyzed with the powerful tools of dynamical systems theory .    in the special case in which all the profiles are equal ,",
    "i.e. @xmath90 all the equations of the above system become proportional and equivalent to : @xmath91   = 0\\ ] ] upon setting @xmath92 , this is precisely eq .",
    ", valid in the @xmath4 case .",
    "this is to be expected since setting all the profiles to be equal corresponds to looking for solutions which are embeddings of the @xmath4 ones in @xmath5 .    in the next sections we shall see numerically in some cases that the above system of equations does admit nontrivial solutions , i.e. solutions whose profiles are not equal nor proportional , while in the appendix we shall prove analytically the existence of such solutions .",
    "such solutions have winding numbers which in general are nonvanishing , therefore can be interpreted as genuine @xmath5 multi - skyrmion configurations .",
    "as said , the formalism developed so far strongly relies on the usage of a spacetime whose spatial sections have a finite radius @xmath93 , and whose curvature goes to zero as @xmath94 . in this section",
    "we will show that there is a natural way to accommodate this flat limit , which requires to take the large @xmath2 limit as well .",
    "the latter is a common tool in quantum field theory , see e.g. @xcite for a review .    the field equations in eq .",
    "( [ equ(n ) ] ) can be rewritten as follows@xmath95 \\",

    "more precisely : @xmath98 hence , the proper way to consider the large @xmath2 limit is to simultaneously consider the _ flat _",
    "limit @xmath99 in such a way that the parameter @xmath100 in eq .",

    "( [ largen1 ] ) does not depend on @xmath2 and @xmath6 separately but only on the effective radius @xmath97 defined in eq .",
    "( [ largen2 ] ) , the quantity @xmath101 plays the rle of a _ geometric _ ( it defines a length scale ) t hooft coupling .",
    "physically , the parameter @xmath100 in eq .",
    "( [ largen2 ] ) represents the  effective area \" available for each skyrmion within each section of the tube .    in conclusion",
    ", one can see the metric defined in eq .",
    "( [ metric ] ) just as a technical device in order to analyze multi - skyrmionic configurations since , at the end , one can turn off all the effects of the curvature ( keeping the cylindrical topology ) . in this limit ,",
    "the solutions of the field equations represent multi - skyrmionic configuration living in a _",
    "flat _ tube - shaped region whose sections have a radius much bigger than the scale @xmath97 .",
    "when n is large the equations read : @xmath102   \\ \\ \\mathbf { , } \\label{largen10}\\ ] ] the first two terms in the above equation ( involving summations ) describe the free part of the theory , while the rest ( involving @xmath97 ) is responsible for interactions , therefore defines nontrivial dynamics .",
    "therefore we find our prescription a reasonable way to implement flat ( large volume ) limit within our formalism . in the next section",
    "we will demonstrate ( for @xmath103 ) , that the dynamics _ does _ depend on @xmath97 .",
    "one of the strongest advantages of our formalism lies in the fact that we have an _ autonomous _ system of differential equations .",
    "the latter can be qualitatively described by its phase portrait , an important characteristic of which is the set of critical points . in particular",
    "if under some change of parameters the set of critical points remains the same ( their number and their character ) , then one does not expect that dynamics of the system changes dramatically under the same change . on the contrary , if the number and/or character of the critical points changes , one may definitely say that the dynamics of the system is qualitatively different .    in this section",
    "we are going to study our system by using the tools of dynamical system theory ( we will follow @xcite ) . in particular , we will analyze how changing the value of @xmath100 the number of the critical points of the dynamical system , as well as their linear stability properties , change .    for simplicity , we shall perform the analysis in the @xmath7 case . in this case",

    "it is also to be noticed that one can not obtain a very large value for the allowed @xmath26 by increasing @xmath261 since the left hand sides of eqs .",
    "( [ ban10.5 ] ) and ( [ ban11.5 ] ) increase faster than the right hand sides .",
    "moreover , the situation gets worse if @xmath100 is very small ( as all the above inequalities are violated at a certain point ) .",

    "it is trivial to see that it is always possible to choose the initial data and @xmath261 , @xmath26 and @xmath97 in such a way that all the above inequalities are fulfilled .",

    "equicontinuous_. consequently , by virtue of the ascoli - arzel theorem , from any sequence @xmath278   $ ] one can extract a convergent subsequence : this , together with the bounds ( [ ban10.5])-([ban11.7 ] ) , implies that the operator @xmath224 is a compact operator from a bounded closed convex set into itself .",
    "thus , it is possible to apply the schauder theorem , which ensures that eq .",
    "( [ fixedpoint ] ) ( which is equivalent to our original system ) has at least one solution .",
    "moreover , it is always possible to choose appropriately the inital data @xmath221 and @xmath222 in such a way that the two profiles are not proportional .",
    "the conclusion is that not only one can construct numerical solutions ( which are very interesting by themselves ) , as we do in the main text , but also one can prove analytically that non - trivial multi - skyrmions in which the profiles are not proportional do indeed exist . besides the intrinsic mathematical elegance of the fixed - point schauder - type argument , the present procedure also discloses the presence of the bounds in eqs.([ban10.5])-([ban11.7 ] ) on the radius @xmath97 and on the length @xmath26 of the tube - shaped region in which these multi - skyrmions are living ( which constrain its shape ) , as well as on the other parameters of the model . at the present stage of the analysis ,",
    "it is not possible yet to say whether such a bound is just a limitation of the method or it signals some deeper physical limitation on the volume of the regions in which one constrains these skyrmions to live .",
    "however , to understand whether or not @xmath5 multi - skyrmions can fit into very large tube - shaped regions is certainly a very interesting and deep question on which we hope to come back in a future investigation .",
