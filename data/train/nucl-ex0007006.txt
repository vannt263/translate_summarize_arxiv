    "no thermal component is apparent in the photon spectrum of the small @xmath1ar+@xmath5c projectile - target combination and pure direct bremsstrahlung clearly accounts for the whole photon emission above @xmath17 = 20 mev ( fig .",

    "the slopes of the direct component , @xmath18 , follow the known linear dependence with the _ projectile energy per nucleon in the laboratory _ @xcite as expected for pre - equilibrium emission in prompt @xmath19 collisions @xcite ( the large values of the slope reflect the coupling of the beam energy with the intrinsic fermi momentum of the colliding nucleons ) .",

    "this property points to a thermal process taking place during later stages of the reaction after dissipation of the incident kinetic energy among internal degrees of freedom over the whole system in the @xmath21 center - of - mass ( the lower slope values reflecting the less energy available in secondary @xmath19 collisions ) .",
    "the interpretation of the second component of the hard - photon spectrum as being emitted during later stages of the reaction in a thermal process is also confirmed by the study of the ( doppler - shifted ) laboratory angular distributions @xcite .",
    "the hard - photon angular distributions can be well interpreted assuming an emission from a source with slope parameter @xmath18 moving with @xmath22 plus an isotropic source with slope parameter @xmath20 and @xmath23 , with the ratios of thermal to direct intensities being fixed by the energy spectra .",

    "the existence of a thermal mechanism accounting for part of the total hard - photon yield , justifies the use of a thermal bremsstrahlung model @xcite to extract the thermodynamical properties of the radiating nuclear systems .",
    "such a model predicts thermal photon spectra basically exponential in the region @xmath17",
    "= 30 - 80 mev in agreement with our data .",
    "the slopes @xmath20 of such exponential spectra are linearly correlated with the local temperature @xmath24 of the nuclear source according to : @xmath25    the correlation of the temperatures obtained using eq .",
    "( [ eq : t vs e0 t ] ) , in the range @xmath24 = 4 - 6 mev , with the excitation energies attained in each reaction ( @xmath26 = 4_a _ - 10_a _ mev ) yields a  caloric curve \" which shows a slightly increasing  plateau \" @xcite .",
    "such a trend , observed by the aladin collaboration , was interpreted as a signal of the nuclear liquid - gas phase transition @xcite .",
    "this observation disagrees with the higher apparent temperatures obtained using the slopes of the ( maxwell - boltzmann ) kinetic energy distributions of different light - particles ( @xmath27 or @xmath28 ) @xcite .",
    "however , at variance with aladin data , we measure temperatures for nuclear systems around the saturation density ( @xmath19 collisions only take place with sizeable cross - sections around or above @xmath29 ) . we conclude that the hot radiating nuclear residues are more likely in a liquid - gas coexistence phase in an  evaporation \"- like scenario , than undergoing a simultaneous breakup in a dilute state .",

    "<S> inclusive and exclusive hard - photon ( e@xmath0 30 mev ) production in five different heavy - ion reactions ( @xmath1ar+@xmath2au , @xmath3ag , @xmath4ni , @xmath5c at 60_a _ mev and @xmath6xe+@xmath7sn at 50_a _ mev ) has been studied coupling the taps photon spectrometer with several charged - particle multidetectors covering more than 80% of 4@xmath8 . the measured spectra , slope parameters and source velocities as well as their target - dependence , confirm the existence of thermal bremsstrahlung emission from secondary nucleon - nucleon collisions that accounts for roughly 20% of the total hard - photon yield . </S>",
    "<S> the thermal slopes are a direct measure of the temperature of the excited nuclear systems produced during the reaction .    </S>",
    "<S> nucleus - nucleus collisions constitute the only mean to study in the laboratory the thermodynamical properties of hot and dense nuclear matter and , consequently , to determine the nuclear equation - of - state @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> heavy - ion ( hi ) reactions at bombarding energies between 20_a _ mev and 100_a _ mev lead to the formation of chunks of nuclear matter at subnuclear densities and moderate excitation energies in the vicinity of the predicted transition from the fermi liquid phase to the nucleon gas phase @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> hi collisions are however dynamical processes involving finite and transient systems . </S>",
    "<S> this fact renders difficult the extraction of the thermostatistical properties of infinite nuclear matter at equilibrium . as a matter of fact </S>",
    "<S> , several key questions still remain open : is thermodynamical equilibrium attained ? </S>",
    "<S> if so , what is the temperature of the excited nuclear systems produced ? what is the time - scale of nuclear break - up ? </S>",
    "<S> is multifragmentation a signal of the liquid - gas phase transition and/or of the passage through the spinodal region of the phase diagram ? </S>",
    "<S> + to answer these questions , precise experimental probes of the phase - space evolution of the hi collision are needed . </S>",
    "<S> this is the primary motivation for the investigation of  elementary \" particle production ( hard photons , dileptons or mesons ) @xcite . despite their very small production cross - sections , </S>",
    "<S> such energetic particles convey valuable information about the stages of the reaction in which they are created . among them , photons are very clean probes since , due to their weak electromagnetic coupling to nucleons , they have a small probability of interacting with the surrounding medium and provide a faithful image of the emission source . </S>",
    "<S> hard - photons with @xmath9 30 mev have been consistently interpreted as issuing from the bremsstrahlung scattering of protons against neutrons , @xmath10 , within the first 50 fm / c of the reaction @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such prompt photons provide thus valuable information about the _ two - body _ dissipation mechanism in the compressed and pre - equilibrium phase of the reaction . during the last 5 years </S>",
    "<S> , however , it has been experimentally proven that the production of hard - photons exclusively through first - chance @xmath11 collisions needed to be reconsidered as the existence of a bremsstrahlung emission component of thermal origin emerged @xcite . to confirm the existence of this second - chance bremsstrahlung emission and to exploit its characteristics to extract the thermodynamical properties ( temperature , density ) of the hot nuclear source(s ) , two campaigns of the taps collaboration were carried out in 1997 and 1998 at the kvi and ganil facilities . </S>",
    "<S> these experiments coupled the taps photon spectrometer with several charged - particle multidetectors for @xmath12-particle coincident detection . </S>",
    "<S> the heavy - ion reactions studied were @xmath1ar+@xmath2au , @xmath3ag , @xmath4ni , @xmath5c at 60_a _ mev and @xmath6xe+@xmath7sn at 50_a _ mev . </S>"
