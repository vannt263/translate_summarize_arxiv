    "mechanical strength of crystalline and disordered solids has ever been exploited in vast research arena as well as day - to - day life .",
    "this physical property of amorphous materials like glasses , ceramics and even metallic glasses or disordered systems in general , to resist applied strain have shown immense influence in applied sciences and current technology . and the subject of improving or enhancing the mechanical strength of materials has kept its interest among researchers intact .",
    "amorphous silicon represents an interesting choice to go beyond the study of model glasses towards the understanding of the mechanical response of real disordered systems .",
    "amorphous silicon ( from now on a - si ) is as such , distinguished from its crystalline counterpart mainly on the ground of an absence of long - range order . from the theoretical point of view a - si",
    "is a generic example of a 4-fold covalent semi - conductor .",
    "it is also convenient to study from molecular simulations since it is a single element system for which several empirical potentials have already been developed ( for e.g.,@xcite ) .",
    "although a considerable amount of work has been devoted to its optical , electrical and vibrational properties over the past few years , there is still a lot to be investigated in order to understand its mechanical behaviour from the microscopic to the macroscopic scale .",
    "previous numerical studies of the elastic and plastic response of lennard - jones model glasses @xcite have shown that at the microscopic scale the response is strongly heterogeneous and involves irreversible atomic rearrangements that appear even in the macroscopic linear regime .",
    "these systems have been studied through the analysis of the non - affine field of displacement that displays a vortex like structure .",
    "elementary plastic events were then associated to large fluctuations of the non - affine displacement field supported by very few atoms and were observed at the boundaries between the vortices where they induce quadrupolar features in the stress field .    in the present paper ,",
    "we report on the elastic and plastic properties of md generated a - si systems at low temperatures with four classical potentials .",
    "other analysis discussed later in this paper and focussed on the shear strain regime between 0 and 20% concerns ( i ) the correlation between the co - ordination defects and the localization of the elementary plastic events and ( ii ) an analysis of the non - affine displacement field .",
    "amorphous silicon structures were modelled through a molecular dynamics ( md ) quench performed from a liquid phase equillibrated at 3500k .",
    "we considered here , a system of 32768 silicon atoms with a classical potential , the tersoff @xcite potential , from which model a - si structures have already been obtained by md quenches@xcite . following the approach of @xcite , the tersoff quench was done in the nve ensemble at a density of 2.33 g@xmath0 . after reaching a temperature of about 10 k , atomic position - optimization and cell - optimization",
    "were achieved by the damped molecular dynamics algorithm in order to leave maximum total force below 10@xmath1 ev.@xmath2 to release the residual stress in the system until the maximum component in the stress tensor was below 0.5 mpa .    in order to examine the dependence of the mechanical behaviour of a model a - si on the type of classical potentials already used to describe the si - si interaction , we have considered apart from the tersoff potential , three other potential forms based on the stillinger - weber ( sw ) potential : ( 1 ) the original sw potential @xcite , ( 2 ) a modified sw potential proposed by @xcite which is equivalent to the original sw potential except for the three - body term that is twice the three - body term in sw potential @xcite",
    ", we call it here swm1 , ( 3 ) a modified sw potential developed by @xcite for a - si in which the original sw unit of energy is scaled by a factor 0.76 while the three - body term is also multiplied by a factor 1.5 , we call it here swm2 . to obtain the initial configurations of a - si for these three sw - potentials , we started off with the tersoff configuration generated at 10@xmath3k.@xmath4 quenching rate as mentioned above and then equillibrated it in the nve ensemble with considered three sw potentials at 100k .",
    "positions and cell parameters were then optimized further with the force and stress threshold similar to those used with the tersoff potential ( i.e. @xmath5 = 10@xmath1 ev.@xmath2 , @xmath6 = 0.5 mpa ) .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the stress - strain relation , however shows in general similar behaviour , is potential dependent . for the tersoff and the sw models ,",
    "the plastic events localize mainly on 5-fold co - ordinated defects , while 3-fold co - ordinated defects are mainly preferred for swm1 and swm2 .",
    "the non - affine displacement field shows quadrupolar like structure when there are plastic events and forms elementary shear bands for higher strain values for sw potential models which exhibit a large stress drop around yield strain , as in other model amorphous solids without local tetragonal order .",
    "only the amplitude of the non - affine contribution to the displacement field vary which is much lower for silicon than for other systems .",
