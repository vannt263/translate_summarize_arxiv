    "such a modelling is straightforward when the density contrasts are small and perturbation theory , based on a suitably chosen small parameter , is applicable ( see e.g. , fry 1984 , moutarde et al 1991 , buchert 1992 , bernardeau 1992 ) . in the other extreme",

    "to do so , padmanabhan ( 1996 ) has concentrated on a typical spherical region and has ignored the effects arising out of averaging over peaks of different sizes .",
    "also no attempt was made to model higher order correlation functions . in this paper , we generalise these ideas in two directions :    \\(a ) we consider peaks of different heights and average over them along the lines suggested in padmanabhan et al .",

    "we will see that there is reasonable - though not excellent - agreement between the model and simulations suggesting that the ansatz we have proposed is along the right direction .",
    "the basic idea behind the model used in padmanabhan ( 1996 ) can be described as follows : consider the evolution of density perturbations starting from an initial configuration which we take to be a realisation of a gaussian random field with variance @xmath4 .",
    "a region with initial density contrast @xmath5 will expand to a maximum radius @xmath6 and will finally collapse to an object of radius @xmath7 which will contribute to the two - point correlation function an amount proportional to @xmath8 .",

    "[ we have obtained the quadratic scaling in @xmath13 based on the assumption that @xmath14 scales in the same way as mean square fluctuations in the mass , which - in turn - will scale as the mean square of the gaussian density field . in general , one expects the scaling to be @xmath15 with @xmath16 .",

    "most dominant contribution arises from high peaks and we find the scaling to be @xmath20 .",
    "the non - linear virialized regime is dominated by contribution from several typical initial regions and has the scaling @xmath21 .",
    "this was essentially the feature pointed out in padmanabhan ( 1996 ) though in that work it was assumed that @xmath22 . to take into account the statistical fluctuations of the initial gaussian field we can average over different @xmath13 with a gaussian probability distribution . [ strictly speaking",
    ", there will be deviations from pure gaussian distribution because our averaging requires a mapping from lagrangian to eulerian coordinates ; we shall ignore this because it is a higher order effect ] .",
    "we shall do this calculation in the next section .",
    "to generalise the above ideas for higher order correlation functions is more nontrivial . in general n - point correlation functions",
    "will depend on shapes but volume averaging will remove this shape dependence .",
    "the  @xmath3 parameters \" are then defined as dimensionless ratios of @xmath23 and @xmath24 . such volume - averaged n - point functions ( which can be directly related to counts - in - cells ) and the @xmath3 parameters have been studied extensively in literature ( white 1979 , balian & schaeffer 1984 , bouchet et al .",
    "1991 , bouchet & hernquist 1992 ) .",
    "the @xmath25 parameters show fairly simple pattern of behaviour both in the perturbative and nonlinear regimes .",
    "it can be shown that all @xmath3 s can be evaluated from spherical collapse model in the limit @xmath26 . in this limit , they are constant and depend only on initial spectral index when smoothing is taken into account .",
    "they are also expected to be constants in the nonlinear regime .",
    "these results indicate that the hierarchical pattern , which is generally assumed to describe nonlinear @xmath27 functions , could have a larger range of validity .",
    "we shall exploit this possibility to estimate the @xmath3 in the intermediate and nonlinear regimes along the following lines :    the evolution of n - point correlation functions is described by momentum moments of bbgky hierarchical equations , which can be expressed in the form    @xmath28    here @xmath17 varies from 1 to n , @xmath29 varies over the cartesian components and @xmath30 is the full n - point correlation function given by    @xmath31    and @xmath27 denotes the reduced part of n - point correlation function . for 2-point correlation function , the resulting equation can be simplified to ( peebles 1980 )    @xmath32    which describes the conservation of pairs . in the integral form , the same result can be expressed as @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the average initial scale from which collapsed structures of size @xmath35 have formed .",
    "our aim is to generalise the above result for higher order correlation functions , but it is obvious that one can not get such a simple relation for higher order correlation functions in which @xmath36 different length scales are present . to make progress , one needs to assume that , although there are different length scales present in reduced n - point correlation function , all of them have to be roughly of the same order to give a significant contribution .",
    "this is supported by the fact that - by its very construction - the reduced n - point correlation function vanishes when a single point or group of points from this set of @xmath37 points are moved to large separation ( in that limit , the correlation function is just the product of lower order reduced correlation functions ) . for a geometrical picture , one can think of a polyhedron , inscribed in sphere , with particles at each vertex having their velocities directed towards the centre of the sphere .",
    "( this configuration has the relative velocity of particles directed along their relative separation and hence can satisfy the stable clustering ansatz . ) for such a configuration , the scale in the correlation function will be the radius of the sphere circumscribing the polyhedron .",
    "if the correlation functions are described by a single scale , then a natural generalisation of equation ( 4 ) , will be    @xmath38    the validity of such an ansatz is open to question and we do hope to check it directly in numerical simulations in a future work . in this paper",
    "we accept the above ansatz as a working hypothesis and use it to calculate the @xmath3 parameters in different regimes .",
    "since these parameters have been studied numerically we can directly test predictions of this ansatz against existing results to obtain a feel for the validity of the ansatz .",
    "it may be noted that , even though several models has been proposed to predict the values of @xmath3 parameters ( hamilton 1988 , fry 1984 , schaeffer 1984 , balian & schaeffer 1989 , bernardeau & schaeffer 1992 ) they fail to reproduce correct values for lower order @xmath3 parameters .",
    "we shall show that the non linear values of lower order @xmath3 parameters are predicted with fair degree of accuracy in our model .",
    "we shall now consider the implementation of the above ideas in three different regimes of gravitational clustering .",
    "we shall call the first one  perturbative regime \" in which we expect perturbation theory is valid .",
    "the second regime ( which we call  intermediate \" regime ) is dominated by scale invariant radial infall of high peaks .",
    "finally the third regime (  nonlinear \") is dominated by virialised blobs of matter .",
    "while we are mainly interested in the latter two regimes , we shall begin with some important observations regarding the perturbative regime .    _",
    "( a ) perturbative regime _",
    "we divide the density field into two parts at each point with one part coming from spherical collapse ( which we call the  monopole \" part ) and the rest of the contribution comes from higher order spherical harmonics , characterising shear , tide and nonlinear coupling between them : @xmath39 it should be noted that one can _ not _",
    "assume @xmath40 for each point .",
    "while this may be obvious from symmetry considerations , a more formal argument can be given along the following lines : let us assume for a moment that we can set @xmath41 . since the growth of density contrast in spherical collapse model is well known ( peebles 1980 ) , we can expand @xmath42 in taylor series to get    @xmath43    where @xmath44 , @xmath45 .... it is clear that , in spherical collapse , @xmath46 . on the other hand ,",
    "since @xmath47 we demand @xmath48 at every order of perturbation .",
    "this implies , in case of spherical collapse model , that @xmath49 for all n i.e. , moments of @xmath50 vanish at all orders ; hence we must conclude that @xmath51 vanishes at each point identically .",
    "clearly , we can not set @xmath41 in ( 6 ) .    for a generic gaussian field",
    ", we have to work with a @xmath51 which has two parts , one coming from pure spherical collapse the other part , @xmath52 is related to deviation from spherical collapse dynamics .",
    "the taylor series will then be    @xmath53    where we have expanded @xmath52 in a perturbative series with @xmath54 being of order @xmath50 .",
    "( note that there is no contribution to @xmath52 in linear order ) .",
    "although both the terms will be important for a generic random field , it has already been shown ( bernardeau 1994a ) that @xmath52 becomes less dominating for rare events i.e. for large values of @xmath13 = ( @xmath55 ) . in the perturbative regime , where @xmath4 is small",
    ", any deviation from homogeneity is a rare event and hence one can assume that , statistically , @xmath52 will be close to zero at most of the points .",
    "one can explicitly demonstrate this claim by calculating the parameters @xmath56 in the limit @xmath57 and showing that it will reproduce the well known results of @xmath3 derived earlier by summing up all tree level diagrams in the limit @xmath58 ( bernardeau 1992 ) .",
    "consider , for example , the case of @xmath59 ; we have    @xmath60    the first term vanishes because @xmath61 and the second term gives us vanishing contribution in the limit @xmath62 and we get the well known result @xmath63 . a similar calculation for higher order moments",

    "these are the exact values of @xmath3 parameters in the limit @xmath65 ( i.e. at the tree level of perturbative calculation neglecting all loop corrections ) obtained previously by rigorous analytical calculations ( bernardeau 1992 , 1994a , 1994b , 1994c , 1995 ) .",
    "our analysis reconfirms that any deviation from spherical dynamics does not alter the values of @xmath3 parameters at tree level in which only monopole part of the dynamics is relevant . the higher order harmonics ( shear , stress and their couplings ) start contributing only from loop level .",

    "this region will expand to a maximum radius @xmath70 and then collapse back to a final radius @xmath71 . in the scale invariant radial collapse ,",
    "the resulting profile will scale with @xmath72 ( fillmore & goldreich 1984 , bertschinger 1985 , hoffman & shaham 1985 ) .",

    "it shows that the averaging introduces a spectrum dependent scaling .",
