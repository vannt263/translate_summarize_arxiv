    "the new science of quantum information builds on the recognition that entanglement , an essential but long underemphasized feature of quantum mechanics , can be a valuable resource .  many of the headline - grabbing quantum communication schemes ( including quantum teleportation bennbrass , zeil , demartini , dense coding @xcite , and quantum cryptography @xcite ) are based on the maximally - entangled two - particle quantum states called bell states .  using the polarization states of a pair of photons in different spatial modes ,",
    "the four bell states are written as:@xmath0where @xmath1 and @xmath2 describe horizontal- and vertical - polarization states , and the subscripts 1 and 2 are spatial mode labels .",
    "these four states form a complete , orthonormal basis for the polarization states of a pair of photons .  in each bell state , a given photon is completely unpolarized but perfectly correlated with the polarization of the other photon .",
    "photon bell states were produced in atomic cascades for the first tests of the nonlocal predictions of quantum mechanics @xcite .  since that time , parametric down - conversion sources @xcite have replaced cascade souces due to their ease of use , high brightness , and the high - purity states they produce .",
    "however , down - conversion sources do not deterministically prepare photon bell states , but rather states in which the bell state component is in a coherent superposition with a dominant vacuum term ; coincidence detection of photon pairs projects out only the two - photon component of the state .",
    "while optical bell state source technology has shown marked improvement , methods of distinguishing these states has proven a difficult challenge .",
    "perhaps the most well - known example of why distinguishing bell states is important comes from quantum teleportation .",
    "a general projective measurement is required for unconditional teleportation ; experimental teleportation was originally limited to a maximum efficiency of 25% since only the singlet state , @xmath3 could be distinguished from the triplet states @xcite .",
    "the challenge for measuring bell states stems from the requirement for a strong inter - particle interaction , which is usually nonexistent for photons .",
    "without such a nonlinearity , only two of the four states can be distinguishedcircuits2 .",
    "it was realized that a strong enough optical nonlinearity , typically @xmath4 , could be used to mediate a photon - photon interaction .",
    "unfortunately , even the nonlinearities of our best materials are far too weak .",
    "an experiment using standard nonlinear materials to demonstrate a scheme for unconditional teleportation was limited to extremely low efficiencies ( on the order of 10@xmath5 ) by the tiny nonlinearities involved @xcite .",
    "proposals for extending optical nonlinearities to the quantum level include schemes based on cavity qed qed , electromagnetically - induced transparency @xcite , photon - exchange interactions @xcite , and quantum interference techniques  switch , phase .  using the latter , we have recently demonstrated a conditional - phase switch @xcite which is similar to the controlled - phase gate in quantum computation .  in this work ,",
    "we show how to apply the conditional - phase switch to the problem of bell state detection .",
    "it should be noted that if recently published schemes for performing quantum computing with linear optics @xcite could be experimentally realized , then the problem of distinguishing all four bell states could be performed without the need for strong optical nonlinearities .",
    "theoretical work has also shown that if the bell state is embedded appropriately in a higher - dimensional hilbert space , all of the bell states can be distinguished @xcite .",
    "strong optical nonlinearities are desired so that one can construct a controlled-@xmath6 , a specific case of the controlled - phase gate for photons .  such a gate and all one - qubit rotations form a universal set of gates for the more general problem of quantum computation  just as the nand gate is universal for classical computation .  the controlled-@xmath6 transformation @xcite is described by:@xmath7 in which the two qubit states are @xmath8 and @xmath9 and the subscript is the qubit label .",
    "this transformation does nothing to the input state unless both qubits have a value of @xmath10 in which case it applies a phase - shift of @xmath11  on the surface this transformation appears to do nothing since an overall phase in quantum mechanics is meaningless .  however , it is clearly nontrivial when applied to superpositions of states .",
    "the polarization of the photon makes an ideal two - level system for encoding a qubit largely due to its relative immunity to environmental decoherence .",
    "a  large enough @xmath4 nonlinearity could be used to effect the c-@xmath12 transformation on a pair of photons .",
    "given a polarization - dependent @xmath13 , or through the use of polarizing beam - splitters , only photon pairs with , say , horizontal polarization would experience the nonlinear interaction and pick up the additional phase shift .",
    "such a gate could then be incorporated into the optical implementation of the quantum circuits shown in fig .",
    "( similar circuits are discussed in circuits2,circuits ) .",
    "the circuit in fig .",
    "converts , through unitary transformation , a state in the rectilinear product state basis ( i.e. @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) to the bell basis .",
    "the circuit in fig .",
    "2a . performs the opposite function converting a bell state via unitary transformation to the rectilinear basis .",
    "in essence , these circuits allow for the creation and removal of entanglement between pairs of qubits .",
    "if the qubit states @xmath16 and @xmath17 are encoded into the polarization states @xmath1 and @xmath2 in two different spatial modes 1 and 2 , then an optical realization of the circuit in fig . 2a .",
    "allows for the conversion of a photon pair in a bell state to a rectilinear basis state .",
    "these four rectilinear basis states are easily distinguishable using the simple optical setup shown in fig .",
    "3 . thus , after passing the photon pair in a bell state through the optical realization of the circuit in fig . 2a . , the subsequent detection of the rectilinear state is equivalent to determination of the bell state .",
    "the conditional - phase switch we propose is related to the controlled - phase gate of quantum computation and is described in the theory section of this work .",
    "the switching effect occurs in a @xmath18 nonlinear material that is pumped by a strong , classical beam .",
    "this pump beam is capable of creating pairs of down - converted photon pairs into a pair of output modes .",
    "pairs of photons , in a coherent superposition with the vacuum , pass through the crystal into those same output modes .",
    "it is the interference between the amplitudes for multiple paths leading to a photon pair that greatly enhances the effective nonlinearity ; since the down - converted light is only created in pairs , the interference only affects the amplitude for photon pairs .  however , since the switching effect is based on an interference effect , it is intrinsically dependent on the phase and amplitude of the incoming beams .",
    "this has two consequences .",
    "first , the switch requires an input which is in a coherent superposition with the vacuum .  in this way ,",
    "the input has the required _ uncertain _ number of photons , since photon number and phase are conjugate quantities .  and",
    "second , the switch works as described only for states in the correct superposition with the vacuum , not a general input state .  as we will show",
    ", these conditions do allow for one to distinguish between the four bell states provided they are in the correct superposition with the vacuum .  nonetheless , the conditions are too stringent to allow for unconditional teleportation using this method .",
    "first , we describe the effective nonlinearity .",
    "then we show how the nonlinearity can be used to construct optical devices analogous to the quantum computation circuits shown in fig .",
    "1a . and fig",
    "the general down - conversion state can be written as@xmath19where the part of the state describing photon pairs has been written as an inner product .",
    "the amplitudes for the polarization states @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 are @xmath24 , @xmath25 @xmath26 , and @xmath27 , respectively .  again , the subscripts 1 and 2 describe two different spatial modes .  throughout this theory section , we adopt a 4-dimensional vector representation to describe the polarization state of the photon pairs .  in this more compact notation ,",
    "the general state is written @xmath28 in both cases , we have suppressed the normalization factor for clarity , and for the discussion here we will restrict ourselves to the case where the probability of having a photon pair at any given time is small , i.e. @xmath29 ( as is always the case in real down - conversion experiments ) .    the effective nonlinearity @xcite can be described as follows .",
    "modes 1 and 2 are of frequency @xmath30 and pass through a @xmath18 nonlinear crystal that is simultaneously pumped by a strong classical laser beam of frequency @xmath31 in mode p.  the modes are so chosen such that the nonlinear crystal can create degenerate horizontally - polarized photon pairs in spatial modes 1 and 2 via spontaneous parametric down - conversion , as shown in fig .",
    "the nonlinear process is mediated by the interaction hamiltonian ,    @xmath32    where g is the coupling constant and @xmath33 is the field annihilation ( creation ) operator for the @xmath34 mode , and the subscripts @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the polarizations of the relevant modes for the type - iphase - matching .",
    "the pump laser is intense enough that we treat it classically by replacing its field operators with c - number amplitudes , @xmath37 and @xmath38:@xmath39due to phase - matching constraints , the nonlinear crystal can only produce horizontally - polarized photon pairs .  in the weak coupling regime , we can use first - order perturbation theory to propagate our state under the interaction to,@xmath40to first order , this hamiltonian simply creates an amplitude for a horizontally - polarized pair of photons .",
    "this new down - conversion amplitude interferes with the preexisting amplitude for the @xmath41 term .     the transformation ,",
    "as described here , does not appear unitary .",
    "this is due to a few approximations .",
    "we assume that the vacuum term in our state is unchanged , and neglect terms describing more that one pair of photons .",
    "these approximations are only valid in the relevant limit where @xmath42 @xmath43 , where we can also suppress the normalization term for clarity .",
    "however , the exact propagator follows from a hermitian hamiltonian and is of course unitary .    as was shown in the `` railcross experiment '' @xcite and in our subsequent work with photon pairs from coherent state inputs @xcite , interference between the amplitudes for existing pairs and for down - conversion can modulate the rate of pair production .",
    "given the phase - matching scheme presented here , only the amplitude for @xmath41 pairs is affected .  accompanying",
    "this modulation of the photon pair production rate is a shift in the phase of the horizontally - polarized photon pair term .",
    "the down - conversion crystal impresses a @xmath6 phase - shift on the @xmath41 term if the down - conversion amplitude , @xmath44 to be @xmath45 .  to implement a tranformation analogous to the c-@xmath6 ( eq . cpi ) in the coincidence basis ,",
    "this is the only condition that must be enforced ; the values for the coefficients @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 are free .",
    "this condition takes the place of the more usual normalization condition on @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 to describe our state space .",
    "it can be enforced experimentally by controlling the amplitude and phase of the pump laser and/or the overall pair amplitude @xmath51 .",
    "unfortunately , this means that the gate can not be utilized on arbitrary inputs without some prior information .  under these conditions ,",
    "the crystal implements @xmath52if horizontal polarization is used to represent a logical ` 0 ' , this performs a transformation analogous to a c-@xmath6 within the state space defined by our constraint on @xmath53  we do not use the conventional c-@xmath6 so that we can use the common convention for the hadamard gate later on without the need for additional quantum gates .",
    "we will now describe how this operation can be used to perform bell state creation under certain conditions .       the circuit in fig .",
    "1a . is capable of converting each rectilinear basis state to a different bell state .",
    "to give a concrete example , we begin with the qubit pair in the state @xmath54represented as the 4-vector@xmath55where the rows now contain the amplitudes for the states @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59  the circuit contains one - qubit hadamard transformations which are defined by the 2@xmath602 matrix ,    @xmath61\\ ] ]    and the two - qubit c-@xmath6 gate whose operation has already been discussed .",
    "the circuit then takes the input state , @xmath62 , to the output state @xmath63 given by@xmath64 \\left [   \\begin{array}{cccc } 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\   0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\   0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\   0 & 0 & 0 & -1% \\end{array}% \\right ] \\left [   \\begin{array}{cccc } 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\   1 & -1 & 1 & -1 \\\\   1 & 1 & -1 & -1 \\\\   1 & -1 & -1 & 1% \\end{array}% \\right ] \\left (   \\begin{array}{c } 1 \\\\   0 \\\\   0 \\\\   0% \\end{array}% \\right ) \\\\ & = & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left (   \\begin{array}{c } 1 \\\\   0 \\\\   0 \\\\   1% \\end{array}% \\right ) .\\end{aligned}\\]]this final state is the bell state @xmath65",
