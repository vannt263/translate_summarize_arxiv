    "for the past four decades the subject of higher - order mechanics was revisited by many authors from the point of view of global analysis , including certain features of intrinsic differential geometry ( see monographs @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "the equations of motion and the lagrange function of higher order analytical mechanics contain higher order derivatives .",
    "such mechanics is often referred to as generalized mechanics or ostrogradsky s mechanics .",
    "ostrogradsky was interested in variational principles with higher order derivatives present in the integrand  @xcite .",
    "as far as we know , he was the first to introduce a hierarchy of generalized momenta corresponding to the sequence of higher order velocities in the lagrange function ( see  @xcite and the reference therein ) .",
    "in the case when no transition from the lagrangian framework to a generalized canonical framework involving generalized ostrogradky s momenta is made , one may prefer to speak about the higher order dynamics .",
    "the more intriguing fact is that the investigations on the application of ostrogradsky s mechanics to real physical models have not been abandoned since the pioneer works by mathisson , bopp , weyssenhoff , raabe , and hnl ( see references @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "most of the applications consider models of test particles endowed with inner degrees of freedom  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite or models that put the notion of the acceleration into the framework of general differential - geometric structure of the extended configuration space of the particle  @xcite .",
    "one interesting example of how the derivatives of the third order may appear in the equations of motion of a test particle is provided by the mathisson ",
    "papapetrou equations @xmath0 together with the supplementary condition @xmath1 it is immediately clear that the second term in ( [ mpu ] ) may produce the derivatives of the third order of the space - time variables @xmath2 as soon as one replaces @xmath3 with @xmath4 in virtue of ( [ pir ] ) .",
    "such a substitution in fact means differentiating equation ( [ pir ] ) .",
    "however , the system of equations thus obtained will not possess any additional solutions comparing to that of  as long as one keeps the original constraint ( [ pir ] ) .",
    "the system of equations  is discussed in  @xcite .",
    "the right - hand side of equation  ( [ mpu ] ) vanishes in the absence of gravitation .    in this contribution",
    "we intend to present certain tools of the intrinsic analysis on manifolds that may appear helpful in solving the invariant inverse problem of the calculus of variations .",
    "the main goal is to introduce a combined approach consisting in the simultaneous imposition of symmetry principles and the inverse variational problem considerations in terms of vector - valued differential forms . besides",
    ", a simple algorithm for an invertible transition from an autonomous variational problem to the variational problem in a parametric form is established . in the special case of three - dimensional space - time , we shall successfully follow some prescriptions for obtaining third - order poincar - invariant variational equations up to the very final solution , thus discovering the unique possible one .",
    "the example shows nonexistence of a globally and intrinsically defined lagrangian for poincar - invariant and well - defined unique variational equation in the considered case .",
    "the model will then be identified with the motion of a free relativistic top in the flat three - dimensional space - time by means of comparing it to equations  when @xmath5 ( and , consequently , @xmath6 ) .",
    "our example exposes the following features of the inverse problem of the calculus ofvariations :    * nonexistence ( in our case ) of a well - defined invariant lagrangian for intrinsically well - defined and poincar - invariant equations of motion . *",
    "existence of a finite set of ( degenerate , in our case ) lagrangians , each producing the aforementioned equations .",
    "* failure of a sum of lagrangians to be a lagrangian of minimal order ; in our case , this is caused by the dependence of different lagrangians on different sets of second - order derivatives .",
    "* invariance , in our case , of this set of lagrangians , but not the lagrangians themselves , with respect to permutations of the axes of the lorentz frame .    in order to simplify the exposition , some of the technical details are omitted in sections  [ section2][section5 ] .",
    "these details are elucidated in section  [ appendix ] .",
    "presentation of the equation of motion in the so - called ` manifestly covariant form ' stipulates introducing the space of ehresmann s velocities over the configuration manifold @xmath7 of the particle , @xmath8 . in the following the notations @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12",
    "will frequently be used in place of @xmath13 , and also @xmath14 sometimes will denote the quantity @xmath2 .",
    "we call a mapping @xmath15 the _ parametrized _",
    "( by means of @xmath16 ) _ world line_. its image in @xmath7 will be called the _ non - parameterized world line . _",
    "the term ` world line ' is borrowed from the relativity theory , and the reader may replace it with ` path ' or ` curve ' . as we are interested in a variational equation ( of order @xmath17 ) that should describe the non - parameterized world lines of the particle , @xmath18 the lagrange function @xmath19 has to satisfy the zermelo conditions , which in our case of only derivatives up to the second order present in @xmath19 read @xmath20    in this approach the independent variable @xmath16 ( called the _",
    "parameter along the world line _ ) is not included into the configuration manifold @xmath7 . thus the space @xmath21 is the appropriate candidate for the role of the underlying manifold on which the variational problem in the autonomous form should be posed .",
    "we may include the parameter @xmath16 into the configuration manifold by introducing the trivial fiber manifold @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and taking into consideration its @xmath24-order prolongation , @xmath25 , i.e. the space of the @xmath24-order jets of local cross - sections of @xmath26 over @xmath27 .",
    "each such a cross - section of @xmath28 is nothing but the graph in @xmath29 of some local curve @xmath30 in @xmath7 . for each @xmath31 there exists a natural projection @xmath32 introduced as follows .",
    "the manifold @xmath33 consists of the derivatives up to the @xmath34-order of curves @xmath30 in @xmath7 , evaluated at @xmath35 . for every @xmath36 , denote by the same character @xmath37 the mapping @xmath38 of @xmath27 onto itself .",
    "then the projection reads @xmath39    by means of projection ( [ p0r ] ) , every lagrange function @xmath19 initially defined on @xmath21 may be pulled back to the manifold @xmath25 and thus defines there the function @xmath40 by the formula @xmath41 .",
    "we say that the differential form @xmath42 constitutes a variational problem in the extended parametric form because in the construction of the new configuration manifold @xmath29 the independent variable @xmath16 is artificially doubled .",
    "nevertheless , we shall need this construction later .",
    "let us return to the variational problem on the manifold @xmath21 specified by a given lagrange function @xmath19 .",
    "the moment we impose the zermelo conditions , the problem becomes degenerate .",
    "one can avoid this degeneracy by reducing the number of velocities at the cost of losing the ` homogeneity ' property of the equation  ( [ f ] ) as follows .",
    "consider some way of separating the variables @xmath43 into @xmath44 and @xmath45 , @xmath46 , thus making @xmath7 into some fibration , @xmath47 , over @xmath27 .",

    "intrinsically defined global projection of non - zero elements of @xmath33 onto the manifold @xmath49 , in this local and ` non - covariant ' representation is denoted by @xmath51 and in the third order is implicitly defined by the following formulae , where the local coordinates in @xmath48 are denoted by @xmath52 with @xmath53 and @xmath54 representing @xmath55 and @xmath56 : @xmath57 u^i.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    there does not exist any well - defined projection from the manifold @xmath49 onto the space of independent variable @xmath27 , so an expression @xmath58 will depend on the selection of the local representation @xmath59 .",
    "we say that two different expressions of type  ( [ l ] ) define the same variational problem in the parametric form if their difference expands into nothing but the pull - backs to @xmath60 of the contact forms @xmath61 that live on the manifold @xmath62 .",
    "these differential forms obviously vanish along the jet of any curve @xmath63 .",
    "let the components of the variational equation @xmath64 corresponding to the lagrangian ( [ l ] ) be treated as the components of the vector - valued one - form @xmath65    we intend to give a ` homogeneous ' description to ( [ e ] ) and ( [ l ] ) in terms of some objects defined on @xmath66 and @xmath21 , respectively .",
    "but we can not apply directly the pull - back operation to the lagrangian  ( [ l ] ) because the pull - back of one - form is a one - form again , and what we need on @xmath21 is a lagrange _ function _ and not a differential form .",
    "however , it is possible to pull ( [ l ] ) ultimately all the way back to the manifold @xmath25 using the composition of projections ( [ p0r ] ) and ( [ wp ] ) , @xmath67 this way we obtain a differential form @xmath68 .",
    "but what we do desire is a form that solely involves @xmath69 ( i.e. , the semi - basic with respect to the projection @xmath70 ) .",
    "fortunately , the two differential forms , @xmath71 and @xmath72 , differ at most by the contact form @xmath73 now , we recall that equivalent lagrangians that are of the same structure ( [ l ] ) differ by multiplies of the contact forms ( [ theta ] ) . by ( [ p0 ] ) and ( [ calp ] ) , the pull - backs of the contact forms ( [ theta ] ) are superpositions of the contact forms ( [ theta ] ) and @xmath74 that is , @xmath75 thus , every variational problem posed on @xmath76 and represented by ( [ l ] ) transforms into an equivalent variational problem on @xmath25 characterized by @xmath77 but the lagrange function of this new variational problem , @xmath78 does not depend on the parameter @xmath16 , and , consequently , may be thought of as a function defined on @xmath21 .",
    "we prefer to cast the variational equation ( of order @xmath79 ) generated by the lagrangian ( [ lambda ] ) into the framework of vector - valued exterior differential systems theory by introducing the following vector - valued differential one - form @xmath80 defined on the manifold @xmath81 .",
    "the expressions @xmath82 in ( [ epsilon ] ) may also be interpreted as the quantities defined on @xmath66 , similar to the interpretation of @xmath83 .",
    "summarizing , we obtain following statement :    [ homogen ] let the differential form correspond to the variational equation with the lagrangian .",
    "then the quantities @xmath84 are the variational expressions for the lagrange function .    in this case the @xmath85-order equation ( [ f ] ) gives a homogeneous representation of the same non - parameterized world lines of a particle governed by the variational problem ( [ l0 ] ) , as does the equation ( [ fe ] ) with the lagrangian given by ( [ l ] ) .",
    "besides , @xmath83 satisfies the zermelo conditions . for more details ,",
