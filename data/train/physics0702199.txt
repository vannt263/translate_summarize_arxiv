    "magnetic stirrers are common equipments in several types of laboratories .",
    "the main component of this equipment is a magnet rotating with adjustable frequency around a fixed vertical axis below a flat horizontal surface .",
    "the rotation of this magnet brings a magnetic stirrer bar in rotation on the bottom of a container put on the flat surface .",
    "if the container is filled with a liquid , the bar generates strong fluid motion which is believed to cause efficient stirring and mixing .",
    "a striking pattern of such flows is a big vortex above the stirrer bar and the corresponding depletion , the funnel , on the surface , which indicates that the flow is strongly structured .",
    "our aim is the experimental investigation of the fluid motion in cylindrical containers generated by magnetic stirrers .",
    "surprisingly enough , despite the widespread use of this device we could not find any reasonable description of such flows in the literature .    in the next section simple theoretical models of isolated vortices are reviewed .",
    "then ( in sections iii , iv ) we describe the experimental setup and the used methods of data acquisition . in section",
    "v we present the results of optical observations , of piv measurements and of monitoring tracer particles and dyes .",
    "section vi is devoted to deriving simple relations for the vortex parameters based on the measured data .",
    "the concluding section points out the similarities and the differences of our results compared with other whirling systems : bathtub vortices , dust devils and tornadoes .",
    "here we review the most important elementary models of steady isolated vortices in three - dimensional fluids of infinite extent.@xcite although our system is obviously more complicated then these models , they are useful reference points in interpreting the data .",
    "the model flows shall be expressed in cylindrical ( radial , tangential and axial ) velocity components ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 ) .",
    "_ rankine vortex .",
    "_ in this model the vorticity is uniformly distributed in a cylinder of radius @xmath3 with a central line ( the @xmath4 axis ) as its axis .",
    "the tangential component is continuous in @xmath5 but a break appears at the radius @xmath3 .",
    "the two other components remain zero : @xmath6 within the radius @xmath3 a rigid body rotation takes place , while outside a typical @xmath7-dependence appears with @xmath8 proportional to the circulation of the flow .",
    "the limit @xmath9 corresponds to an ideal vortex line .    _",
    "burgers vortex_. in a real fluid viscosity smoothes out the break in the tangential component of the rankine vortex . in order to maintain a steady rotation , an inflow and an axial flow",
    "should be present . in the burgers",
    "vortex the strength of the axial flow increases linearly with the height @xmath4 , measured from a certain level : @xmath10 here @xmath11 is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid , and @xmath3 remains an effective radius within which the tangential flow is approximately a rigid body rotation .",
    "note that the tangential velocity component may depend on the viscosity indirectly only , via a possible @xmath11-dependence of the radius @xmath3 .",
    "the experiments were carried out with tap water in glass cylinders , in different combinations of radii @xmath12 and initial water heights @xmath13 as summarized in table [ t:1 ] .",
    "radii @xmath12 of the cylinders used and the heights @xmath13 to which water was filled up in each .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the value of @xmath14 can be estimated in our case to be a few dm@xmath15s , for the estimate we take @xmath16 cm@xmath15s .",
    "the core radius and the height are @xmath18 cm and @xmath19 cm , respectively .",
    "the data for the other flows are taken from the literature and are summarized , along with the resulting dimensionless numbers in table [ t:3 ] .",
    "the froude numbers are on the same order of magnitude but the reynolds numbers are rather different .",
    "this shows that the role of viscosity is much stronger in small scale flows then in the atmosphere .",
    "viscous flow is present in the vortex core , therefore the detailed flow patterns do not match there .",
    "the global flow is , however , in all cases practically that of an ideal fluid .",
    "therefore we conclude that outside of the vortex core the tangential flows are dynamically similar , i.e. our experiment faithfully models all these whirling systems , an observation which can be utilized in undergraduate teaching .    finally we mention that the analog of the dye curtain can be seen in tornadoes , typically in the vicinity of the bottom since it is the earth surface which is the source of ` dye ' ( in the form of dust or debris ) . in some tornadoes this ` dye ' curtain is clearly separated from the funnel ( cf .",
