    "the study of @xmath7 meson decays plays an important role in determining the cp - violating parameters in the standard model ( sm ) and discovering new physics in the flavor - changing processes .",
    "in particular , @xmath7 non - leptonic two - body decays provide an abundant sources of information about the ckm matrix .",
    "for example , the most promising measurement of @xmath8 ( @xmath9,@xmath10 and @xmath11 are three angles in the unitarity tri - angle ) is from measurement of the time - dependent cp - asymmetry in @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath0 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are also very important for determining @xmath15 .",
    "however , the theoretical calculation of these hadronic decays suffers from the complicated strong interactions which compromise the precision of the determination of the ckm matrix elements from the experimental data .",
    "thus the higher order calculation of such decays are essential for a better understanding of the cp violations .    besides the non - leptonic decays , the new measurements on @xmath16 mixing and @xmath5 have a great impact on constraining the unitarity tri - angle",
    ". both of two decay modes are also sensitive to new physics .",
    "the @xmath7 decays also offer us a good place to study the strong interaction dynamics in heavy flavor systems . in the abundant decay products of @xmath7 mesons ,",
    "experimentalists observed a lot of new hadron resonances at babar and belle .",
    "they are mainly excited ( or exotic ) charmed mesons and charmonium states .",
    "the excited @xmath7-mesons and @xmath6-baryons can be only studied at the hadron colliders .",
    "we will briefly review the spectrum of the excited @xmath7 mesons and @xmath6-flavored baryons from the measurements at tevatron .",
    "@xmath17 and @xmath1 are the most popularly studied two - body decay modes in @xmath7 physics in addition to @xmath18 .",
    "the big experimental achievement is that the direct cp asymmetries in these decays have been observed .",
    "the latest world averages are@xcite @xmath19 both of which are @xmath20 away from zero .",
    "@xmath0 are dominated by tree amplitudes . due to the isospin symmetry ,",
    "the decay amplitudes of tree @xmath21 modes can be parameterized graphically as the following @xmath22 where @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 stand for the color - allowed , color - suppressed tree amplitude and penguin amplitude respectively . according to the naive factorization , the ratios @xmath26 and @xmath27 are expected to be small .",
    "this leads to that the @xmath28 is almost half of @xmath29 , and @xmath30 is very small .",
    "however , this expectation is strongly against the experimental data@xcite @xmath31 which requires @xmath32 .",
    "it means that the color - suppression is not valid any more .    for @xmath33 decays ,",
    "the similar graphical parameterization can be written as @xmath34+e^{-i\\gamma}[t^\\prime+c^\\prime],\\nonumber \\\\ a(\\pi^+k^{-})&= & p^\\prime+e^{-i \\gamma}t^\\prime , \\\\",
    "-\\sqrt{2}a(\\pi^0\\bar k^{0})&=&[p^\\prime - p^{ew}]-e^{-i\\gamma}c^\\prime,\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in which penguin amplitude @xmath35 dominates comparing with the color - allowed tree amplitude @xmath36 , color - suppressed tree amplitude @xmath37 and the electro - weak penguin @xmath38 .",
    "@xmath39 is expected if @xmath40 and @xmath41 are small .",
    "however , the recent experimental data shows @xmath42 .",
    "it requires either the enhancement in @xmath38 or @xmath37 .",
    "the large @xmath38 scenario @xcite seems to be going away with the new experimental measurement of @xmath43 .",
    "@xmath44 is needed to meet the data .",
    "so similar to the situation in @xmath0 , the color - suppression for @xmath45 is not valid any more .    in qcd",
    "factorization , these color - suppressed amplitudes are related to the qcd coefficient @xmath46 . for illustration@xcite ,",
    "@xmath47_{v_2 } \\\\&+ & \\left\\{\\begin{array}{lc } [ 0.18]_{\\rm lohsi } & \\qquad \\mbox{(default ) } \\\\ { [ 0.46]_{\\rm lohsi } } & \\qquad \\mbox{(s4 ) } \\end{array } \\right . \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "the accidental cancellation between the leading order ( lo ) and next - to - leading order ( nlo ) vertex corrections ( @xmath48 ) makes the hard spectator interaction ( hsi ) very important .",
    "the nlo corrections to the hsi are recently studied by beneke , jager and yang@xcite . in their papers , the corrections from the two scale regions are encoded into the jet function and hard coefficient respectively , both of which enhance the color - suppressed amplitude effectively .    in table",
    "[ table1 ] , the predictions in qcdf with nlo hsi in a certain parameter setting ( @xmath49 ) is shown .",
    "the agreement between the prediction and experimental data is very good except for the direct cp asymmetries @xmath50 .",
    "it means that the strong phases still need further study .",
    "recently , the efforts towards the nlo corrections to the imaginary part of the amplitude has started . in @xcite , the next - next - to - leading order",
    "vertex corrections has been considered .",
    ".predictions in qcdf with nlo hsi vs. experimental data . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "almost 30 years after the discovery of @xmath6 quark , and 7 years @xmath7 factories running , @xmath7 physics has entered a precision test era . the higher order theoretical calculations are essential to explain the more and more accurate experimental data , especially the data for non - leptonic decays .",
    "this does not only require the straight - forward but tough computation but also developing new theoretical concepts in heavy flavor physics .    for the theoretically clean decays , the new experimental measurements shed a light on the precision test of the sm and the door towards new physics .",
    "@xmath7 factories are also good places to find charmed mesons and charmonium states .",
    "the recently observed new mesons properties still need further theoretical study .",
    "lhc will run in next year , @xmath7 physics will enter a new era .",
    "we can fully explore all the @xmath6-flavored hadrons and their decays .",
    "theorists will find more interesting subjects there .",
