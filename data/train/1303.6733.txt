    "an unexpectedly large value of neutrino mixing angle @xmath12 was measured by the daya bay reactor neutrino experiment ( dyb ) @xcite , together with other consistent evidences from the reactor @xcite and accelerator @xcite neutrino experiments .",
    "it opens a gateway to the measurement of neutrino mass hierarchy ( i.e. , the sign of @xmath0 or @xmath13 ) and the leptonic cp - violating phase ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "a large value of @xmath12 makes both above measurements easier in the next generation of neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "possible information on the neutrino mass hierarchy ( mh ) can be extracted not only from the matter - induced oscillations of long - baseline accelerator neutrino experiments @xcite and atmospheric neutrino experiments @xcite , but also from the vacuum oscillation in reactor neutrino experiments at medium baseline @xcite .",
    "the mh sensitivity of a future reactor neutrino experiment comes from the interference effect of two separated oscillation modes @xcite ( i.e. , two fast oscillations driven by @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) .",
    "the relative sizes of @xmath15 and @xmath16 and the non - maximal value of @xmath17 make it possible to determine the mh in vacuum , immune from the uncertainty of the earth density profile and ambiguity of the cp - violating phase in atmospheric and long - baseline accelerator neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "such a measurement is challenging .",
    "the energy resolution as the size of @xmath18 and event number of several tens of thousands are the minimal requirements  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the spatial distribution of reactor cores  @xcite and non - linearity of the energy response  @xcite may also degrade the mh sensitivity .",
    "besides the interference effect in neutrino vacuum oscillations , direct measurements of the flavor - dependent effective mass - squared differences ( i.e. , @xmath19 , @xmath7 and @xmath20 ) @xcite may also include the mh information .",
    "@xmath19 from short base - line reactor neutrino experiments ( i.e. , daya bay @xcite ) and @xmath21 from the long - baseline accelerator muon - neutrino disappearance are different combinations of @xmath0 and @xmath13 .",
    "reactor neutrino experiment at the medium baseline can measure both @xmath0 ( or @xmath13 ) and @xmath22 up to the mh sign .",
    "therefore , a comparison of the effective mass - squared differences in different oscillation scenarios can discriminate the neutrino mh .",
    "considering the mh determination from the daya bay ii reactor neutrino experiment , the sensitivity from the interference effect can be improved by including the accurate measurement of the effective mass - squared difference @xmath7 from accelerator neutrino experiments or @xmath19 from reactor neutrino experiments .",
    "such a study has not been done before and makes sense at least in the following four aspects .",
    "( a ) we do the first analysis of the non - linearity effect with explicit non - linearity functions ; ( b ) we propose the new idea of non - linearity self - calibration to reduce the non - linearity effect ; ( c ) our strategy to improve the mh sensitivity using the effective neutrino mass - squared differences is different from previous publications ; ( d ) we discuss the effect of baseline differences and provide the real baseline distribution of the approved daya bay - ii experiment .",
    "the outline of this work is planned as follows .",
    "we first give a brief description on the effective mass - squared differences in different oscillation channels in section 2 .",
    "statistical analysis of daya bay ii is introduced in section 3 .",
    "impact from the energy non - linearity of the liquid scintillator detector is discussed in section 4 . improved mh sensitivity with the absolute mass - squared difference @xmath19 and external @xmath7 measurements",
    "is presented in section 5 .",
    "finally , we conclude in section 6 .",
    "in the standard three - neutrino mixing scheme the survival probability for the @xmath23-flavor neutrinos is given by @xcite @xmath24 where @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 is the element of the leptonic mixing matrix .",
    "note that only two of the three @xmath28 are independent because we have the relation @xmath29 from their definitions .",
    "strong hierarchy ( i.e. , @xmath30 ) between the magnitudes of @xmath22 and @xmath0 ( or @xmath13 ) is achieved from the analysis of solar ( or kamland ) and atmospheric ( or long - baseline accelerator ) neutrino oscillation data @xcite . to separate the fast and slow oscillation modes",
    ", we can rewrite the probability in eq .",
    "( [ alphasurvp ] ) as @xmath31}\\sin[2\\delta_{\\alpha\\alpha}+(1-\\eta_\\alpha)\\delta_{21 } ] \\nonumber \\\\    & + & 4|u_{\\alpha3}|^2 |u_{\\alpha2}|^2\\sin{[\\eta_\\alpha    \\delta_{21}]}\\sin[2\\delta_{\\alpha\\alpha}-\\eta_\\alpha\\delta_{21 } ] \\nonumber \\\\     & - &   4|u_{\\alpha2}|^2|u_{\\alpha1}|^2 \\sin^2 \\delta_{21 } ,     \\nonumber \\ ] ] where an effective mass - squared difference is defined as the linear combination of @xmath0 and @xmath13 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "we can choose proper values of @xmath34 to eliminate the terms in the second and third lines of eq .",
    "( [ alphasurvppow ] ) , and therefore keep the independent fast and slow oscillation terms .",
    "in general , @xmath34 is not only the function of neutrino mass and mixing parameters , but also the function of the neutrino energy and the baseline .    at the first oscillation maximum of the atmospheric mass - squared difference",
    ", we have @xmath35 and the corresponding oscillation effect is extremely small .",
    "expanding to the linear term of @xmath36 , we can obtain an effective two - neutrino oscillation scheme , if the parameter @xmath34 satisfies the following relation , @xmath37 in a neutrino oscillation experiment of this type , such as the short base - line reactor neutrino experiment ( i.e. , daya bay ) or the long - baseline accelerator muon - neutrino disappearance experiment , it is impossible to distinguish between the two neutrino mass hierarchies because two degenerate solutions with identical @xmath38 but different hierarchies can generate the identical neutrino energy spectrum .",
    "the absolute values of @xmath39 ( or @xmath13 ) in the two solutions are different due to non - zero @xmath22 .",
    "the value of @xmath34 varies for different oscillation channels due to the flavor - dependent amplitudes in the oscillation probabilities , so the degeneracy of the neutrino mh can be removed by comparing the effective mass - square differences of different neutrino flavors @xcite .    using the standard parametrization of the leptonic mixing matrix @xcite , we get the effective mass - squared differences in eq .",
    "( [ dmeff ] ) for different channels of neutrino oscillations @xmath40 where terms at the order of @xmath41 have been neglected for simplicity .",
    "we can also calculate the differences of the effective quantities between different flavors as @xmath42 where the positive and negative signs correspond to normal and inverted mass hierarchies , respectively .",
    "on the other hand , at the first oscillation maximum of the solar mass - squared difference , such as the reactor neutrino experiment at the medium baseline , we have the approximation of @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "therefore , we can separate the fast and slow oscillation terms , if @xmath34 fulfills the equation as @xmath45\\cos[2\\delta_{32}+\\eta_\\alpha\\delta_{21}]+    |u_{\\alpha2}|^2\\sin[\\eta_\\alpha    \\delta_{21}]\\sin[2\\delta_{32}+\\eta_\\alpha\\delta_{21}]=0\\ , .",
    "\\label{etadm21}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] one should note that @xmath34 depends on both the neutrino mh and the neutrino energy . the mh sensitivity is encoded in the energy dependence of @xmath46 .",
    "moreover , because of the different definitions of @xmath46 in these two oscillation scenarios , the mh sensitivity of the reactor neutrino experiment at the medium baseline can be improved by including the extra measurements of @xmath19 in eq .",
    "( [ dmee ] ) and @xmath7 in eq .",
    "( [ dmmu ] ) .    for a reactor neutrino experiment at the medium baseline , corrections to the mass - squared differences from the terrestrial matter effect",
    "are around @xmath9 and the induced uncertainties are negligibly small ( less than @xmath47 ) . on the other hand , in the muon - neutrino disappearance channel of long - baseline accelerator neutrino experiments ,",
    "the matter corrections are suppressed by the smallness of @xmath12 and only at the level of @xmath48 for the baselines of several hundreds kilometers ( e.g. , 295 km for t2k @xcite and 735 km for nova @xcite ) . moreover ,",
    "the different signs in the matter potentials of neutrino and antineutrino oscillations are also favorable to increase the discrepancy of different mass - squared differences .",
    "the 20 kt liquid scintillator detector of daya bay ii experiment  @xcite will be located at equal baselines of 52 km away from two reactor complexes ( 36 gw in total ) . in this study",
    "we use nominal running time of six years , 300 effective days per year , and a detector energy resolution @xmath49 as a benchmark .",
    "a normal mh is assumed to be the true one ( otherwise mentioned explicitly ) while the conclusion wo nt be changed for the other assumption .",
    "the relevant oscillation parameters are taken from the latest global analysis @xcite as @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "the cp - violating phase will be specified when needed .",
    "finally , the reactor antineutrino flux model from vogel _ et al . _",
    "@xcite is adopted in our simulation .",
    "both evaluations give consistent results on the mh determination . ] . because two of the three mass - squared differences ( @xmath22 , @xmath0 and @xmath13 ) are independent , we choose @xmath22 and @xmath19 defined in eq .",
    "( [ dmee ] ) as the free parameters in this work .    to obtain the sensitivity of the proposed experiment",
    ", we employ the least squares method and construct a standard @xmath54 function as following : @xmath55 ^ 2}{m_{i } } + \\sum_k\\frac{\\epsilon^2_{k}}{\\sigma^2_k}\\,,\\label{chirea}\\ ] ] where @xmath56 is the measured neutrino events in the @xmath57-th energy bin , @xmath58 is the predicted reactor antineutrino flux with oscillations , @xmath59 is the systematic uncertainty , @xmath60 is the corresponding pull parameter , and @xmath61 is the fraction of neutrino event contribution of the @xmath62-th pull parameter to the @xmath57-th energy bin .",
    "the considered systematic uncertainties include the correlated ( absolute ) reactor uncertainty ( @xmath63 ) , the uncorrelated ( relative ) reactor uncertainty ( @xmath64 ) , the flux spectrum uncertainty ( @xmath9 ) and the detector - related uncertainty ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "we use 200 equal - size bins for the incoming neutrino energy between 1.8 mev and 8.0 mev .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "next we can discuss the ambiguity of the unknown cp - violating phase @xmath65 and evolution of the mh sensitivity with respect to changes of the @xmath7 error .",
    "the @xmath66 dependence on different input errors is shown in figure 7 , where the blue , black and red lines stands for different values of the cp - violating phase ( @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 respectively ) . in figure 7",
    ", we can notice that the improvement are obvious for an external @xmath21 measurement better than @xmath63 and becomes significant if we can get to the @xmath9 level .",
    "for the effect of the cp - violating phase , it is most favorable for the value close to @xmath70 .",
    "the cases of maximal cp violation are in the middle region which are just the cases discussed in figure 6 .",
    "the ambiguity of the cp - violating phase can induce an uncertainty of @xmath71 at @xmath72 .",
    "the effect of the external @xmath7 measurement can also be viewed as a probe of the cp - violating phase .",
    "if the improvement is much better than the discussion in figure 6 , a preference of @xmath65 close to @xmath70 can be achieved .",
    "otherwise , we may get a nearly vanishing cp - violating phase if the situation is totally opposite .",
    "current best measurement for @xmath21 from the minos experiment @xcite gives an error of @xmath73 .",
    "two new experiments t2k @xcite and nova @xcite are in operation or construction and each of them can reach @xmath8 by 2020 after finishing of their nominal running plans ( 5 years of @xmath74 mode at 750 kw for t2k and 3 years of @xmath74 mode plus 3 years of @xmath75 mode at 700 kw for nova ) .",
    "if these experiments could extend to another 5-year running , it might be possible to obtain the precision of @xmath9 which will be useful for the measurement of the precision reactor neutrino experiment .",
    "in this work , we have discussed the determination of the neutrino mh using the daya bay ii reactor neutrino experiment at a medium baseline around 50 km away from reactors .",
    "precision measurements of the reactor antineutrino spectrum can probe the interference effect of two fast oscillation modes ( i.e. , oscillations induced by @xmath39 and @xmath13 ) and sensitive to the neutrino mh .",
    "the corresponding sensitivity depends strongly on the size of @xmath12 , the energy resolution , the baseline differences and energy response functions .",
    "moreover , the mh sensitivity can be improved by including a measurement of the effective mass - squared difference in the long - baseline muon - neutrino disappearance experiment due to flavor dependence of the effective mass - squared differences .",
    "we have calculated the mh sensitivity taking into account the real spatial distribution of reactor complexes , and demonstrated that the residual energy non - linearity of the liquid scintillator detector has limited impacts on the sensitivity due to the self - calibration of small oscillation peaks .",
    "we numerically calculated the sensitivity by assuming two typical classes of energy non - linearity functions ( @xmath63 ) and discussed the improvement with the external @xmath7 measurement quantitatively .",
    "to conclude , the daya bay ii experiment could determine the mass hierarchy unambiguously with a confidence level of @xmath76 ( @xmath77 ) or @xmath78 ( @xmath79 ) in 6 years , for the @xmath7 uncertainty of 1.5% or 1% ."
