    "related multivariable quadratic systems should be computed , the complexity of which is possibly np - complete @xcite . in practice ,",
    "the measurements are possibly contaminated by noise , and one shall seek an approximation solution to the reformulated noncovex optimization problem by maximum a posterior ( map ) of noise .",
    "numerically , researchers have developed various iterative algorithms involving with a nonconvex constraint set of magnitude , such as an alternating projection algorithm @xcite for the classical phase retrieval problem .",
    "several variant heuristic algorithms popular in the optics community including @xcite were proposed to solve the classical phase retrieval problems , and one can refer to @xcite and the reference therein .",
    "these methods are based on projections onto a nonconvex set , and it is therefore very difficult to describe and prove the convergence mathematically .",
    "consequently , more recent work has focused on designing fast algorithms with convergence guarantee for such nonconvex minimization problem , _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite , _ etc _ , with random - masking or oversampling measurements . in the optics community , in order to increase the imaging resolutions and robustness , a popular approach , known as ptychography @xcite , uses a sequence of phaseless diffraction measurements recorded while translating the specimen with respect to a constant illumination mask .",
    "in order to prevent trapping into a local minimum for solving conventional nonconvex projection or minimizing methods , another scheme is to model phase retrieval by convex methods including phaselift @xcite and phasecut @xcite based on semi - definite programming(sdp ) , as well as phasemax @xcite operating in the original signal space with much less computational cost compared with sdp based convex methods .    to the best of our knowledge , an early work for phase retrieval by employing sparse _",

    "the @xmath1 norm based phase retrieval method with a compressibility constraint was proposed in @xcite .",

    "prior _ knowledge of exact sparsity level(number of nonzeros ) , a sparse fieup method @xcite was proposed in @xcite .",
    "generic _ two - step iterative scheme was proposed in @xcite , which consisted of updating support set , and using damped gauss - newton algorithm to solve a nonconvex optimization problem with updated support set .",
    "a two - stage solution technique was presented in @xcite by first using arbitrary phase retrieval technique to recover sampling measurements and then compressive sensing method to recover the unknown signals . if the transform domain of the unknown objects are corrupted by additive noise , a probabilistic method based on the generalized approximate message passing algorithm",
    "was given in @xcite .",
    "hard thresholding based truncated gradient iterations in @xcite were employed in order to refine a sparse orthogonality - promoting initialization .",

    "shearlet and total variation based regularization methods were considered in @xcite .",
    "dictionary learning methods were proposed to reconstruct the image in @xcite from gaussian noised measurements with outliers , where gaussian distributions only provide a limited approximation in most real applications .",
    "roughly speaking , the intensity is recorded by a detector for a limited time , which is usually affected by poisson noise . for linear measurements , in order to remove the poisson noise , one can adopt a variance stabilizing transformation such as the anscombe root transformation in @xcite , where a pointwise nonlinear transformation was introduced such that one just needs to deal with gaussian data . when the peak level decreases , this transformation is less efficient .",
    "one should directly tackle it and total variation based regularization based method was proposed in @xcite , where kullback - leibler ( kl ) divergence was derived based on the bayesian framework in the case of poisson noise . in a similar manner , for phaseless nonlinear measurements of phase retrieval ,",
    "variational methods based on tikhonov and total variation regularization were proposed to recover images from poisson measurements in @xcite .",
    "the reconstructed images shown in @xcite exhibit sharp edges and clean background for very noisy and limited data .",
    "however , as such method was built upon the local - sparsity regularization term , there exist visible staircase artifacts , and the smaller repetitive features can not been preserved particularly for measurements generated with deterministic illumination in ptychographic phase retrieval problem . in order to further increase the accuracy and visual quality of recovery results for practical applications , one possible direction is to exploit the redundancy between overlapping image patches to boost the sparsity , such as using dictionary learning based denoising method @xcite , which pursues a sparse representation by a dictionary learned from image patches .    in this paper , we propose to build up a novel dictionary learning model to reconstruct high quality images from poisson phaseless measurements , which can deal with both real and complex - valued images .",
    "it consists of three terms , _",
    "i.e. _ a representation terms by an orthogonal dictionary , an @xmath0 pseudo norm of coefficient matrix , and a kullback - leibler divergence to fit phaseless poisson data .",
    "the pseudo @xmath0 norm is used as a sparse regularization of coefficient matrix with both isotropic and anisotropic forms . meanwhile ,",
    "fast algorithms are designed with global convergence guarantee in order to solve the proposed nonconvex nondifferential optimization model . since an orthogonal dictionary is employed , subproblems _",

    "moreover , they are capable of producing higher quality results by preserving the texture features compared with total variation based method @xcite .",
    "additionally , it also shows that the proposed method helps to further increase the quality for reconstructing complex - valued images by unitizing the introduced anisotropic @xmath0 pseudo norm .",

    "the proposed dictionary learning model is given in section [ sec1 ] .",
    "we first propose an alternative minimization method in section [ sec2 ] by alternately minimizing the coupled variables to compute the proposed model .",
