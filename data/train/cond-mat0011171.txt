    "frustration in the antiferromagnetic ( afm ) ordering of fcc and spinel lattices was recognized long ago by anderson in his analysis of the highly degenerate magnetic ground state of these structures.@xcite this so - called @xmath26 frustration can prevent the system from undergoing spin - glass ( sg ) or afm ordering down to temperatures much lower than the curie - weiss temperature , @xmath27,@xmath28 .",
    "it has also been shown , theoretically @xcite and experimentally , @xcite that the ground state degeneracy can be removed by atomic disorder leading to a sg type of ordering .",

    "@xcite besides , recent interesting low-@xmath0 neutron diffraction experiments showed , in the ordered phase ( @xmath24 ) , the existence of a near dispersionless excitation at @xmath23 mev , and for @xmath34 , a continuous magnetic gapless density of states.@xcite    in this work we report on the @xmath0-dependence ( @xmath1 - @xmath2 k ) of the electron paramagnetic resonance ( epr ) , magnetic susceptibility , @xmath3 , and specific heat , @xmath4 , in a single crystal of the @xmath5 spinel zncr@xmath35o@xmath7 of cubic structure ( @xmath36 , o@xmath37 ) and in the cd doped polycrystalline zn@xmath8cd@xmath9cr@xmath6o@xmath7 ( @xmath10 ) compounds .",

    "5 ) , indicating that all the cr@xmath97 ions that contribute to @xmath3 also participate in @xmath88 .",

    "the maximum in @xmath3 is caused by afm correlations and indicates the onset of long range afm ordering .",
    "instead , the maximum in @xmath88 can be interpreted as transitions within thermally populated exited states .",
    "the observation of epr resonances in exited state levels of nearest - neighbor cr@xmath18 spin - coupled pairs diluted in the spinel znga@xmath6o@xmath7 has been reported by henning et .",
    "@xcite these authors were able to determine , from the observed @xmath88 , the energy separation between the first exited triplet state ( s @xmath108 ) and the ground singlet state ( s @xmath109 ) to be @xmath110 @xmath111 k. also , from the optical spectra of the cr@xmath18 spin - coupled pairs in znga@xmath6o@xmath7 a value of @xmath112 @xmath111 k was measured for @xmath113 .",
    "@xcite within the same scenario and taking into account the thermal population of all the exited states for the cr@xmath18 spin - coupled pairs ( @xmath114 - @xmath115 ; 3 , 2 , 1 , and 0 ; @xmath116 @xmath19 ) , the expected @xmath0-dependence of the total epr intensity , @xmath88 , in the three exited states levels at energies @xmath117 @xmath118 , and @xmath119 above the singlet ground state is given by:@xcite    @xmath120 /z\\ ] ]    where @xmath121 is the partition function , the coefficients @xmath122 , @xmath123 , and @xmath124 are adjustable parameters proportional to the transition probability within each excited multiplet .",
    "the solid line in the inset of the figure 4 shows the @xmath0-dependence given by eq . 2 for @xmath125 , @xmath126 , @xmath127 and @xmath128 @xmath129 k. the value found for @xmath113 is larger than the one ( @xmath112 @xmath111 k ) found for isolated cr@xmath18 spin - coupled pairs in znga@xmath6o@xmath7.@xcite this difference is probably due to the different lattice parameters of zncr@xmath35o@xmath7 ( @xmath130 @xmath131  ) in znga@xmath6o@xmath7 ( @xmath130 @xmath132  ) .",
    "@xcite nevertheless , the value is in good agreement with that extracted from the curie - weiss temperature , @xmath74 , ( see above ) .",
    "as we pointed out elsewhere @xcite , one can also attribute the difference between the temperature dependence of the susceptibility and the epr intensity to the presence of non  resonant low frequency modes that contribute spectral weight to the kramers  kronig integral for the static susceptibility ,    @xmath133    but do not participate in the epr absorption .",
    "it is likely that such modes are seen in inelastic neutron scattering above @xmath63@xcite .",
    "the fact that the susceptibility and the epr intensity have a common temperature variation in the cd ",
    "doped samples suggests that the non  resonant , low frequency modes , if present , are not making a significant contribution to the susceptibility integral .",
    "figure 7 shows the @xmath134 plots obtained from the data of figure 6 for each studied sample . the contribution from the magnetic component",
    "is obtained from the difference with the data for the non magnetic reference compound znga@xmath6o@xmath7 .",
    "the entropy , @xmath135 , is obtained integrating these differences and gives approximately the multiplicity of the involved levels , @xmath112 @xmath136 . within the same scenario of cr@xmath18 spin - coupled pairs , the schottky anomaly for the spin - coupled pairs",
    "is given by : @xmath137\\ ] ] figure 8 shows the fitting of the data to eq .",
    "the obtained value for @xmath138 @xmath139 k suggests the scheme of levels shown in figure 8 .",
    "the value found for @xmath113 is consistent with those values obtained independently from the curie - weiss temperature , @xmath74 , and epr intensity measurements in the htpp ( see above ) .    in the ltop",
    "our epr experiments show the appearance of small resonance modes ( see figure 1 for @xmath83 @xmath140 k ) .",
    "we believe that their sample size and shape dependence and angular variation are , probably , more related to demagnetizing effects rather than to the tetragonal crystal distortion observed at @xmath48 k.@xcite besides , for @xmath24 the magnetic susceptibility increases at higher fields ( see inset of figure 3 ) and also , a small increase is oberved for @xmath83 @xmath141 k ( see figure 3 ) .",
    "these behaviors are similar to those observed in magnetization measurements of polycrystalline samples of zncr@xmath6o@xmath7 and they have been attributed to the presence of afm domains in the ltop.@xcite thus , we associate our resonance modes with afm domains that might be present in these materials as a consequence of their highly frustrated 3d long range afm magnetic structure .",
    "in conclusion , our epr and @xmath3 results in the @xmath5 spinel zncr@xmath35o@xmath7 show , between @xmath32 k and @xmath69 k , a transition from a long to a short range regime of afm correlations ( ltop - htpp ) . from the @xmath0-dependence of the epr intensity in the htpp an exchange parameter of @xmath81 @xmath142 k between the cr@xmath18 ( s @xmath19 ) spin - coupled pairs was extracted .",
    "this value is close to the one obtained independently from the curie - weiss temperature , @xmath74 , and from the schottky anomaly observed in the specific heat .",
    "thus , the magnetic properties of these strongly frustrated systems in the htpp can be described within a scenario involving just spin - coupling pairs of cr@xmath18 ( s @xmath19 ) . the sharp drop in @xmath3 at @xmath90 @xmath32",
    "k , the peak in @xmath4 also at @xmath90 @xmath32 k , and the ordering temperature extracted from the broadening of the epr linewidth ( @xmath31 @xmath32 k ) confirmed the afm ordering at @xmath90 @xmath32 k in zncr@xmath6o@xmath7 .",
    "the resonance modes observed in the ltop and the field dependent susceptibility , @xmath67 , indicates the presence of afm domains in this material .",
    "finally , we found that the disorder caused by the cd impurities in zncr@xmath6o@xmath7 drives the system from an afm to a sg type of highly frustrated magnetic ordering .",
    "although a model based on isolated pairs can account for many of the magnetic properties of zncr@xmath64o@xmath65 , it does not include the interaction of the pairs with the surrounding ions .",
    "a widely used pair model that does include the effects of the interaction with neighboring spins is the constant coupling approximation @xcite .",
    "however , this model does not exploit the unique tetrahedral character of the cr sublattice in zncr@xmath64o@xmath65 .",
    "in particular , it predicts the same susceptibility for zncr@xmath64o@xmath65 as found in an unfrustrated simple cubic antiferromagnet , which has the same number of nearest neighbor interactions ( 6 ) and exhibits a conventional afm transition . this contradiction has led two of us ( ajga and dlh ) to develop a quantum tetrahedral mean field model @xcite . in this model , the energy levels of a four  spin tetrahedral cluster",
    "are calculated exactly and the interaction with the neighboring ions is treated in the mean field approximation .",
    "good agreement with the susceptibility and the magnetic specific heat are obtained with nearest  neighbor interaction , @xmath143",
