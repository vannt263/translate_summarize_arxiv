    "the large - scale expansion of the universe is usually taken to be dominated by the newtonian part of the gravitational field .",
    "this idea probably originates from the close correspondence between the friedmann equations of general relativity and the equations that govern newtonian cosmologies @xcite , but also has strong support from rigourous constructions that are based on perturbative expansions of einstein s field equations @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , there are good reasons to be interested in relativistic effects in cosmology .",
    "these include the apparent existence of dark energy , as well as the dawn of the age of precision cosmology .",
    "put bluntly , relativistic effects need to be understood in order to have faith in the cosmological models that we use to interpret observational data .    geometrically ,",
    "the newtonian part of the free gravitational field is described entirely by the electric part of the weyl tensor .",
    "the magnetic part of the weyl tensor , on the other hand , has no newtonian counterpart , and therefore describes a part of the gravitational field that is entirely relativistic ( both of these objects are defined in section , below ) .",
    "well known relativistic effects such as frame - dragging and gravitational radiation require a non - vanishing magnetic weyl tensor in order to exist , but the effects of the magnetic part of the weyl tensor on the large - scale expansion of the universe are still largely unknown .",
    "this is partly due to an absence of realistic cosmological models that have non - zero magnetic weyl curvature , and that could therefore be considered to be non - silent @xcite .",
    "this situation is , however , changing .",
    "it has recently been demonstrated that cosmological models that contain regularly - arranged discrete masses can generate a non - zero magnetic weyl tensor , even if no such curvature existed in their initial data @xcite .",
    "the authors of this study considered the effect that this tensor has on the large - scale expansion of a universe that contains eight black holes , using both the leading - order term in a taylor series expansion , and by numerically integrating the evolution equations of the initially silent space .",
    "we extend their study by calculating both the leading - order and next - to - leading - order parts of the relevant series expansion , and by using these results to determine the effect of the magnetic part of the weyl tensor on the large - scale expansion of all cosmological models that contain regularly arranged discrete masses in a closed cosmology .",
    "the phenomenology of such models is interesting , as they can be considered a first approximation to the type of universe within which we actually live .",
    "more mathematically , they provide a tractable way to formulate @xmath1-body cosmology as a relativistic initial value problem .",
    "they therefore provide an ideal arena within which to study relativistic gravitational effects in cosmology .    in section",
    "we describe in detail the cosmological models that we will be using in this study .",
    "they consist of regularly - arranged discrete masses in a closed space , and are formulated as a relativistic initial value problem . in section",
    "we then introduce the compact formalism that will be used in the rest of the paper .",
    "this starts by using a 1 + 3 decomposition of the geometric and kinematic quantities involved , and finishes with a 1 + 1 + 2 decomposition that can be efficiently used to exploit the symmetries of the problem .",
    "the explicit form of the symmetry restrictions are then determined in section , where it is shown that the influence of the magnetic part of the weyl tensor on the relevant evolution equations does not necessarily vanish .",
    "section then contains some lengthy calculations to determine the coefficients of a taylor series expansion that can be used to include the effect of the magnetic weyl tensor on the large - scale expansion of space . in section",
    "we present the numerical results for each of the lattice universes that we will be considering , before concluding in section .    throughout the paper",
    "we use the first half of the latin alphabet to denote space - time coordinate indices , and the second half to denote spatial coordinate indices .",
    "greek letters are reserved to denote spatial frame indices , where they are required .",
    "sec : models    the space - times we wish to consider are those that have come to be known as `` lattice models '' , in some parts of the cosmology literature .",
    "these models have a periodic structure , and are constructed from a number of regularly arranged cells , each of which are identical to one another .",
    "such models have been studied in a number of different contexts over the past few years , as they offer a simple enough setting to provide concrete answers to questions of direct physical interest .    the particular type of lattices we wish to consider are those in which the topology of the cosmological region is a hypersphere .",
    "furthermore , we want to consider situations where the only mass present is in the form of black holes , without angular momentum or electric charge .",
    "we position one single black hole at the centre of every lattice cell , so that the cosmological region as a whole contains a regular array of these objects .",
    "the geometry of the space - time can then be treated as a vacuum solution of einstein s equations , with its scale and expansion being prescribed accordingly .    in the rest of this section",
    "we will describe the specifics of the six different lattice configurations that we will be studying , as well as the solutions to the constraint equations , and the existence of curves within the space - time that display special rotational symmetries .",
    "this recaps results from previous work @xcite .      before solving for the geometry of space - time , we need to understand how to divide a hyperspherical universe into @xmath1 identical cells .",
    "if we choose each cell to be one of the five possible platonic solids ( _ i.e. _ one of the five possible regular convex polyhedra ) , then there are six different ways that we can arrange these cells to form a closed lattice .",
    "each of these configurations corresponds directly to one of the six regular , convex polychora that exist in four dimensions . they are @xcite :    * * 5-cell . *",
    "this lattice consists of five tetrahedral cells .",
    "three cells meet along every cell edge , and there are a total of five vertices ( the points where cell corners meet ) .",

    "* this lattice is made from sixteen tetrahedral cells , with four cells meeting at every cell edge .",
    "it is dual to the 8-cell ( meaning that interchanging vertices and cell centres gives an 8-cell lattice ) . * * 24-cell . *",
    "the 24-cell is constructed from twenty four octahedral cells .",
    "three of these cells meet along every cell edge , and there are a total of twenty four vertices .",
    "the 24-cell is self - dual , as it has the same number of cells and vertices .",
    "* * 120-cell .",
    "* this structure contains one hundred and twenty dodecahedral cells , with three cells meeting at every edge .",
    "there are six hundred vertices in this structure , meaning that it is dual to the 600-cell , described below .",
    "* * 600-cell .",
    "* this is the largest of all lattices that fits our specifications .",
    "it is built from six hundred tetrahedral cells , with five of these meeting along every edge .    in the rest of this section",
    "we will outline how einstein s constraint equations can be solved for these lattices , as well as how curves that exhibit local rotational symmetry can be identified .",
    "if we treat general relativity as an initial value problem , then we can split einstein s equations into constraint and evolution equations .",
    "the former of these can then be written as a hamiltonian constraint and a momentum contraint , such that , in vacuum , ^(3)r+k^2 - k_ij k^ij = 0 con1 + d_j k_i^j- d_i k = 0 con2 , where @xmath2 is the ricci scalar of the geometry on the initial hypersurface , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 is its extrinsic curvature in the embedding space - time .",
    "the @xmath5 derivative is used here to denote a covariant derivative within @xmath3 , and @xmath6 is the trace of @xmath4 .",
    "( ) and ( ) are , in general , very difficult to solve .",
    "however , we can simplify the problem dramatically if we choose our initial hypersurface carefully .",
    "for example , if we choose it to be symmetric under time reversal then we automatically have @xmath7 .",
    "the hamiltonian constraint then reduces to ^(3)r = 0 , con3 while the momentum constraint is identically satisfied .",
    "this equation is much easier to solve , and is the basis of the study of geometrostatics ( the gravitational analogue of the field of electrostatics @xcite ) .",
    "we will assume initial data of exactly this type in what follows , and find solutions to the constraint equation ( ) that describe the maximum of expansion of our lattices .",
    "these results were presented for the first time in lifton_etal:2012 .",
    "a metric ansatz for the initial geometry can be chosen as follows : dl^2 = ^4 ( d^2 + ^2 d ^2 ) , sol1 where @xmath8 is the line - element of a 2-sphere , and where @xmath9 acts as the square root of the scale factor .",
    "the time - symmetric hamiltonian constraint then reduces to d^2 = 0 , con4 where @xmath10 is the covariant laplacian operator in @xmath3 .",
    "this equation is now linear in @xmath11 , meaning that if a solution can be found for a single black hole , then we can simply super - impose this with other solutions of the same form to find multi - black hole solutions .",
    "this is exactly what we need to form our lattice models of the universe .    a simple solution to eq .",
    "( [ con4 ] ) is given by @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is a constant .",
    "this function has a pole at @xmath14 , and looks very much like the gravitational field one might expect for a point - like particle located at that position .",
    "of course , there is nothing special about the point @xmath14 , and we can generate any number of similar functions by rotating the coordinate system so that @xmath15 , and then replacing @xmath16 by @xmath17 in the denominator .",
    "this gives the solution for @xmath18 such particles as = _",

    "this is just what we need to construct our lattice cosmologies , as it is a solution that corresponds to @xmath18 arbitrarily located black holes , in a universe that is at its maximum of expansion .    in the sections that follow",
    ", we will use the solution given by eqs .",
    "( ) and ( ) as initial data for our cosmology .",
    "this initial data is exact , but has some subtleties to its interpetation .",
    "the parameter @xmath21 that appears in eq .",
    "( [ sol2 ] ) looks like it corresponds to the mass of a particle positioned at @xmath20 , but it is not the proper mass of the @xmath19th black hole .",
    "this must be found by looking at the geometry of the space in the limit @xmath22 , and comparing this to a time - symmetric slice through the schwarzschild solution .",
    "one then finds that the proper mass of each of the black holes is a function of the location and @xmath21 of each of the other black holes .",
    "the parameter @xmath21 can then be interpreted as an `` effective mass '' , which includes information about the gravitational field of the gravitational potential energy , as well as that from the proper mass of each of the individual black holes lifton_etal:2012,mass .",
    "as we want all of the black holes in our lattice models to have the same mass , we choose @xmath23 for all values of @xmath19 .",
    "there exists a number of curves , within our lattices , that display local rotational symmetry ( lrs ) lifton_etal:2013,clifton_etal:2014 .",
    "perhaps the simplest of these curves to visualize is the example of a cell edge . in each of the lattice structures listed above",
    "there were between three and five identical cells meeting along every cell edge .",
    "this means that the geometry of space - time in the vicinity of these curves must be invariant under a rotation that interchanges the cells .",
    "if we pick a set of orthonormal frame vectors for our 3-space @xmath24 , and align @xmath25 with this special curve , then the rotational symmetry implies lifton_etal:2013 v_2=v_3 = 0 = t_23 t_22=t_33 , lrs where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the spatial frame components of any vector @xmath28 , and any symmetric tensor @xmath29 .",

    "( ) and ( ) are only valid in the tangent spaces of the points that make up these lrs curves , but they are significant restrictions .    as well as cell edges , there are other curves in our lattices that also exhibit rotational symmetry lifton_etal:2014 .",
    "they are given by the lines that connect the horizon of the black hole at the cell centre with the cell corner , and the line that connects this horizon will the centre of a cell face .",
    "such curves are illustrated in fig .",
    ", for the particular case of a cubic cell . they will be the curves that we solve for in section .",
    "the curves that connect the centre of the cell with the cell corner , and the centre of a cell face , are formally infinitely long in the initial data , which is why we have chosen to cut them off at the black hole horizon .",
    "they then have finite proper length",
    ".    the location of the horizon will be determined by assuming the horizon to be initially non - expanding . in this case , the location of the horizon along lrs curves is found by looking for solutions to the following equation lifton_etal:2013 : d_*e*_1 e_11 = 0 , where @xmath25 is again aligned with the direction of the lrs curves , and @xmath31 is the frame component of the electric part of the weyl tensor .",
    "the location of the horizon at subsequent times is found by propagating null geodesics along the lrs curves , from the initial location ( as can be seen to be required by the null raychaudhuri equation lifton_etal:2013 ) .",

    "sec : formalism    in order to exploit the symmetries of a space - time it is often convenient to decompose the geometric objects that exist within it .",
    "this can be achieved by picking out vector fields that are either aligned with , or orthogonal to , certain invariantly defined sub - spaces , and then by defining projection operators associated with these vectors . within the field of cosmology , the most widely applied decomposition of this type is the @xmath32-decomposition pioneered by ehlers hlers , and developed by ellis and others ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) . if there also exists a preferred space - like direction within the space , as in lrs space - times @xcite , then the @xmath33 decomposition of clarkson becomes a useful tool @xcite .",

    "it also grows as time goes on , and can reach the level of @xmath0 by the time @xmath244 .",
    "sec : discussion    we have considered the effect of @xmath84 on the evolution of lrs curves in lattice models of the universe .",
    "these models treat the matter in the universe as a collection of point - like sources , and allow the formulation of cosmology as an initial value problem .",
    "they are therefore particularly well suited to the study of relativistic effects in cosmology , including the study of the evolution and effects of the magnetic part of the weyl tensor ( a purely relativistic part of the free gravitational , with no analogue in newtonian gravity ) .",
    "we find that although the initial data of our models is silent ( with @xmath245 ) , the evolution of the space is not silent .",
    "in particular , a @xmath186 term appears in the evolution equation for the electric part of the weyl tensor , which in turn acts as the source for the evolution of lrs curves .",
    "this result was identified and studied numerically by korzyski , hinder and bentivegna for the particular case of a universe that contains eight black holes @xcite .",
    "we extend their study by calculating the leading - order and next - to - leading order terms in a taylor series approximation that can be used to incorporate the effects of @xmath84 on lrs curves , and by applying it to all possible regular arrangements of black holes in a closed cosmological model .",
    "the inclusion of the next - to - leading order term , in our study , allows us to estimate when the series expansion stops converging , and when numerical techniques need to be employed instead .",
    "we find that the effect of @xmath84 is small , while the series expansion remains valid , but grows with time .",
    "in particular , we find that while the effect of the @xmath84 on the expansion of lrs curves can be at the level of @xmath246 when the number of masses in the universe is small ( as in @xcite ) , but that this number decreases as the number of masses in the universe is increased ( when comparing at the same time , measured in terms of @xmath230 ) . while the effect on the expansion rate is small for larger lattices , however , it does appear that the effect of @xmath84 on the expansion is , in some sense , cumulative .",
    "that is , the difference in the curve length that results from including the effect of @xmath84 tends to increase over time , as the magnitude of the magnetic weyl tensor increases over time . when comparing lattices at the same cosmological time ( _ i.e. _ at the same time , as measured in units of @xmath237 )",
    ", it therefore appears that the effect of @xmath186 on the evolution of the lrs curve increases as the number of masses in the universe is increased . whether or not similar result holds in cosmological models that expand for all time , rather than re - collapsing , remains to be seen .",
    "it should be noted , however , that while the effects we find are always small ( less than @xmath246 , in most cases ) , the taylor series approximation used to derive them usually breaks down on time scales that are shorter than the age of the universe .",
    "this is especially true in the larger lattices , where it can be seen that increasing the number of masses in the universe results in the series approximation breaking down at earlier cosmological times .",
    "this result holds for all of the lrs curves that we studied , but seems to be especially true of the cell edges ( which , unfortunately , are probably the best indicators of the scale of the cosmology as a whole ) . to reliably follow the evolution of these curves",
    "any further will require more advanced techniques .",
    "it is interesting to see that the effect of higher - order terms in einstein s equations can lead to non - negligible effects in the large - scale expansion of space .",
    "one may note , for example , that it is not until we get to order @xmath247 in the taylor series expansion in eq .",
    "( [ da1 ] ) that the influence of @xmath186 becomes non - zero at all . in a weak - field expansion of the gravitational field , about a suitably chosen background",
    ", this would probably correspond to quite a high order in perturbations .",
    "nevertheless , the terms involved grow rapidly over cosmological time - scales , until they come close in magnitude to the leading - order terms represented by @xmath176 .",
    "this is remiscent of the gravitational wave memory effect @xcite , where the small effects of non - linear gravity accumulate over time until ( in the case of gravitational waves from astrophysical sources ) they are comparable with the magnitude of the linear , leading - order terms .",
