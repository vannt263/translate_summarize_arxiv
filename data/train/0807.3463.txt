    "the original idea of fu and nielsen in the mid - eighties of the last century consisted in proposing a new way of dimensional reduction through higher dimensional lattice models with anisotropic couplings @xcite . since then in a series of papers the phase diagram of the higher - dimensional lattice models was studied by mean field and monte carlo methods . besides that a mechanism of producing the anisotropic couplings was proposed invoking a randall - sundrum space - time metric to the ( continuum ) higher dimensional models@xcite .",
    "the lattice model with anisotropic couplings which came up could help in understanding the localisation of the gauge interaction on the brane ; the idea was that the usual four - dimensional space - time is embedded in a higher dimensional bulk in which the extra dimensions are subject to confinement .",
    "indeed the assumed strong coupling dynamics along the extra dimension requires a non - perturbative study .",
    "the numerical study on the lattice has verified the prediction of a new phase ( layer phase ) proposed by fu and nielsen who used mean field methods . in this new phase",
    "we established the existence of a massless photon on the four - dimensional subspace while at the same time the extra dimension is confined @xcite .",
    "this confinement is responsible for the fact that the higher - dimensional space is layered - like and the interactions are confined in the four - dimensional space - time slices .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention that in the dvali - shifman model a similar way of thinking has been used in order to achieve a localization mechanism on a brane : the assumption of confinement ( of a non - abelian nature ) along one of the dimensions which limits the dynamics of the model in a subspace with one dimension less @xcite .",
    "it is possible to generate gravitationally this localization mechanism for the trapping of the charged fields , under a non - abelian gauge field , on a 3d submanifold ( brane ) using the non - minimal coupling of gravity with a scalar field @xcite .",
    "the result is a spontaneously broken phase on the brane ( higgs phase ) and a confining ( symmetric phase ) in the transverse directions ( bulk ) .    in this work",
    "we consider the following exercise : we assume a five - dimensional u(1 ) lattice model with anisotropic couplings at finite temperature .",
    "our intention is to discover the fate of the layer phase as we switch on the temperature to non zero values . by means of numerical methods we study the phase diagram and",
    "our main result is that for @xmath0 the layer phase becomes a deconfined phase with new properties . in other words ,",
    "the confining extra dimension that is detected at @xmath1 , becomes deconfined for non zero values of the temperature and the system is lacking the four - dimensional layered structure .",
    "the previous result is suggestive for the behavior of a multidimensional anisotropic gauge - higgs model at finite temperature .",
    "it is well known that at high temperature the higgs phase turns into a symmetric phase .",
    "we expect then that the layer higgs phase disappears at this temperature .",
    "the new phase is probably a multidimensional high temperature symmetric phase : a hot multidimensional world in the `` quark - gluon plasma '' phase . in this rather hypothetical scenario",
    "the universe starts as a hot multidimensional system that cools down , passes through a series of phase transitions and ends up to a brane universe at zero temperature .    to explore the phase diagram of the anisotropic 5d u(1 ) gauge model we have to understand first the phase structure of the 4d u(1 ) gauge model at high temperature .",
    "the study of the phase structure of lattice electrodynamics in three and four dimensions at zero temperature , using the topological excitations of the theory ( monopoles ) was first performed by the authors of ref .",
    "computer simulations for the 3d compact qed at finite temperature were performed in ref .",
    "@xcite for the deconfinement transition from the monopole anti - monopole point of view . in three dimensions and zero temperature",
    "the theory is confining for all values of the coupling constant and a monopole and anti - monopole plasma is responsible for the permanent confinement of oppositely charged particles . for non - zero temperature the binding of monopoles and the formation of magnetic dipoles lead to loss of confinement .",
    "the dipole plasma can not sufficiently screen the field created by electric currents and the screening mass vanishes .    in four dimensions",
    "the point - like topological excitations become one - dimensional objects ( strings of monopole currents ) . again , in the zero - temperature case and for small values of the coupling constant @xmath2 there is a large number of monopole loops winding around the system and causing disorder . as a consequence ,",
    "if an external field is applied it will be shielded after a small penetration . for large values of @xmath2 ,",
    "on the other hand , the situation is different .",
    "a long distance penetration of the external field is observed , accompanied by the renormalization of the magnetic charges due to the monopole currents . the case of 4d compact u(1 )",
    "gauge theory at finite temperature was studied separately in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the authors of reference @xcite reported a second order phase transition to a coulomb phase for @xmath3 , with critical exponents consistent with 3d gaussian values and no obvious dependence on @xmath4 .",
    "a different picture emerged in ref .",
    "@xcite , where among other things the disappearance of the coulomb phase for all values of @xmath5 was predicted . instead of a coulomb phase we are left with a spatial confining - temporal coulomb phase for all temperatures .    in this paper",
    ", we are not going to present a detailed study of the nature of the phase transitions ; however , some of our findings seem to indicate the absence of a coulomb phase for all temperatures different from zero for the case of four dimensional compact qed ( as long as the condition @xmath6 is satisfied ) .",
    "we go one step further and examine a finite temperature scenario in five dimensions through the anisotropic u(1 ) gauge model with couplings @xmath2 and @xmath7 .",
    "the connection of this model with the brane model scenarios makes it an ideal candidate for the study of the brane models in the non - zero temperature case .",
    "we are mostly interested to discover if some of the most promising characteristics of this model survive in the high - temperature regime . in what follows we will try to give a brief summary of our findings through the description of the limiting cases of our model .    for @xmath8",
    "we obtain the four dimensional qed at finite temperature . from the study of the system with volume @xmath9 and @xmath10 and 6 we come to the conclusion that , although phase transitions seem to appear for finite @xmath11 , they are actually finite - size effects and disappear in the limit @xmath12 . for all values of @xmath13",
    "the coulomb phase gives its place to a temporal coulomb - spatial confining phase ( deconfining phase ) @xcite .",
    "the coulomb phase is recovered only at @xmath1 .    for @xmath14 and @xmath15",
    "we have a five dimensional , anisotropic model in a high temperature state .",
    "the zero temperature model has been already studied and it is characterized by three distinct phases @xcite . a five dimensional confining phase , a 5d coulomb phase and the layer phase where the system is confining along the fifth direction while , along the four remaining directions , it exhibits the coulomb behaviour with a massless photon .",
    "these characteristics change when the temperature becomes non - zero .",
    "we observed the replacement of the layer phase by a deconfining phase , due to the same mechanism responsible for the disappearance of the coulomb phase in four dimensions .",
    "the behavior of the system in the time direction is coulombic and confining in the remaining four directions .",
    "our work is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we present the action of the model and the observables , the helicity modulus and the polyakov line , that we use in order to characterize the phase diagram of the model . in section 3",
    "we analyze the system in the three limiting cases : 5d anisotropic for @xmath1 , @xmath8 and @xmath16 .",
    "finally in section 4 we present the phase diagram for the 5d anisotropic model at finite temperature and in particular for @xmath15 . in lattice units . ]",
    "the five dimensional anisotropic u(1 ) gauge model with two couplings , @xmath2 and @xmath7 , at finite temperature is defined as :    @xmath17    @xmath18    where @xmath19 are the plaquette variables defined on the 4d - subspaces \\{(@xmath20 ) - t } and planes containing an extra , fifth dimension ( @xmath21 ) . with an obvious noatation we call these plaquettes as @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "+ the link variables are defined as @xmath24    let us make the notation clear .",
    "the action is defined in an euclidean lattice volume , namely @xmath25 in lattice units .",
    "@xmath4 is the compactified temporal dimension which is related to the temperature through the relationship @xmath26 we denote with @xmath27 the lattice spacing , @xmath4 is an integer number , @xmath28 are the usual  infinite ",
    "space dimensions and finally @xmath29 is an extra , fifth dimension , which we consider to be infinite and equal to @xmath30 . we assume periodic bourdary conditions for the u(1 ) gauge field in all directions .",
    "the proclaimed anisotropy of the model has nothing to do with the  time  direction . in this model",
    "the lattice spacings @xmath31,@xmath32 are equal .",
    "the anisotropy is introduced through the interaction along the extra direction .",
    "so , we have @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the lattice spacing related to the extra dimension .    in our model the gauge couplings @xmath2 and @xmath7 are generally independent from each other and the coordinates .",
    "the lattice spacing is determined from the value of the couplings @xmath2 and @xmath7 . in some cases we can have a coordinate dependence and it is possible to relate them with extra fields , as in the brane model  @xcite . in terms of the continuum fields the link angles , @xmath35 ,",
    "can be written as : @xmath36 where @xmath37 are the gauge potentials  @xcite and with @xmath38 we denote @xmath39 . in the nave continuum limit @xmath40 we define : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the bare five - dimensional coupling constant for the gauge field .",
    "the resulting continuum action takes the standard form : @xmath43 note that @xmath44 has dimensions of length and is related to a characteristic scale for five dimensions .",
    "the previous expression does not exhibit any anisotropy at all .",
    "however , the results that we present below indicate that the anisotropy may survive in the continuum limit .",
    "we now proceed to the introduction of the observables , i.e. the gauge invariant quantities which are used for the study of the model .      among the quantities",
    "used to distinguish the various phases and the respective phase transitions in a statistical model the ones that attract the most attention are the so called order parameters .",
    "their great significance comes from the fact that they display completely different behavior between the various phases .",
    "their  thermal average  is zero on the one side of the transition and moves away from zero on the other side . for the case of a confining - coulomb transition",
    "a quantity with the properties of an order parameter is the helicity modulus ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "it was first introduced in the context of lattice gauge theories by p.de forcrand and m. vettorazzo and it characterizes the responce of a system to an external flux .",
    "it is zero in a confining phase and nonzero in a coulombic one@xcite .",
    "+ let us consider our five dimensional system with @xmath46 and let us choose a particular orientation , for example , @xmath47 . through the remaining orthogonal directions",
    "it is defined a stack of @xmath48 plaquettes parallel to the @xmath47 orientation . in order to study the response of the system to an external static field we assume the presence of an external flux @xmath49 through this stack of plaquettes . by a suitable choice of variable transformations",
    "we can spread the flux homogeneously over the parallel planes .",
    "in other words , we can add the constant value of @xmath50 to each of the plaquettes of the given ( @xmath51 ) orientation .",
    "also we can impose an external flux by changing the boundary links using twisted boundary conditions instead of using pure periodic  @xcite .",
    "the partition function , in the presence of the external flux , is : @xmath52    @xmath53    @xmath54    @xmath55    where @xmath56 is the sum over the plaquettes of the given orientation @xmath47 , containing the flux and @xmath57 its complement , consisting of all the plaquettes that remained unchanged ( plaquettes belonging to the other planes ) .",
    "+ > from the partition function we can obtain the flux dependent free energy @xmath58 an important observation is that the partition function @xmath59 of equation ( 3 ) and hence the flux free energy is clearly @xmath60 periodic .",
    "so , the extra flux we impose on the system is defined only @xmath61 .",
    "+ in the confining phase the flux free energy @xmath62 is constant in the thermodynamic limit because the correlation length and the effect of the external flux through the twisted boundary links is exponentially decreasing . on the contrary , in the coulomb phase we have an infinite correlation length ,",
    "so the influence of the twisted boundary conditions is extended to the full extent of the system . as a result",
    "we have a nontrivial dependence of @xmath62 by the external flux @xmath49 .",
    "+ the helicity modulus is defined as @xmath63 and it gives a measure of the curvature of the free energy profile around @xmath64 . from the above equation and for various choices with respect to the orientation , due to the anisotropy of the model , we have : @xmath65    @xmath66    @xmath67    @xmath68    now , consider for the moment the classical limit ( @xmath69 ) for the action ( 4 ) where all the fluctuations are suppressed . in this limit",
    "the flux is distributed equally over all the plaquettes of each plane and it does not change as we cross the parallel planes . if we expand the classical action in powers of the flux , since in the thermodynamic limit the quantity @xmath70 is always small , we find : @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the 5d lattice volume .",
    "the above expression for the free energy , f , holds all the way up to the phase transition , where fluctuations are present , if one only replaces the bare coupling by a renormalized coupling , @xmath73 ( for details see @xcite ) :    @xmath74}(\\phi)-f_{[\\mbox{\\tiny finite $ \\beta$}]}(0)= \\frac{\\beta_{r}}{2}\\phi^{2}\\left(\\frac{l_{\\rho}l_{t}l_{5}}{l_{\\mu}l_{\\nu}}\\right)\\ ] ]    > from the eqs .",
    "( 6 ) and ( 11 ) we have for the `` spatial '' h.m @xmath75 and following the same steps , we can get the scaling relations for the remaining quantities : @xmath76 @xmath77 @xmath78 although the arguments presented above are based mainly on the classical approach , this is indeed the case in the coulomb phase and the helicity moduli applied for the five dimensional system behave exactly as the above equations predict .      for the evaluation of the potential between a static quark - antiquark pair at zero temperature",
    ", the study of the ground state expectation value of the wilson loop for large euclidean times is needed . when the temperature is non zero ( @xmath79 as opposed to the former case ) the same information is obtained by using a different quantity which is the polyakov loop or the wilson line .",
    "it consists of the product of link variables along topologically non - trivial loops , winding around the time direction due to periodic conditions .",
    "@xmath81 where @xmath82 denotes a lattice site .",
    "+ physically , the expectation value of the polyakov loop determines the free energy of a system with a single , static heavy quark , measured relative to the vacuum : @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the absolute value of p and @xmath85 the statistical average value evaluated using the action of equation ( 1 ) .",
    "the above relation holds even in the presence of finite mass quarks coupled to the gauge potential with the only difference that in that case the expectation value has to be calculated using the finite temperature action that includes the dynamical fermions .",
    "the polyakov loop is somewhat the world line of a static quark in a wilson loop and that suggests that the free energy of a quark - antiquark pair located at @xmath86 and @xmath87 respectively is given by the correlation function of two such loops , with bases at the aforementioned points and having opposite orientations .",
    "consequently we have : @xmath88 keeping @xmath4 constant .",
    "+ for large distance separation of the quark - antiquark pair and assuming that the correlation functions satisfy clustering , the above expression reduces to @xmath89 which is just the self - energy of two isolated quarks .",
    "+ in the confinement phase the correlation function of the polyakov loop decays exponentially for large distances : @xmath90 giving a linear potential with string tension @xmath91 and @xmath92 . + the flux",
    "free energy @xmath93 increases , in general , for large separation of the quarks in the confining phase , giving eventually @xmath94 and @xmath95 in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "we interpret @xmath94 as a signal for confinement .",
    "if we have @xmath96 , then the free energy of the static quark - antiquark pair tends to a constant value , for large separation of the heavy charges , as shown in eqs .  ( 18 ) and ( 19 ) , and this is a signal for deconfinement . in other words , the expectation value of the temporal polyakov loop serves as an order parameter in finite temperature gauge theories .",
    "the five dimensional anisotropic u(1 ) gauge model , at zero temperature , was first introduced by fu and nielsen @xcite as an attempt to offer an alternative way to achieve dimensional reduction . since then many numerical investigations of the model",
    "have been made @xcite .",
    "as we have already noted in the introduction , the interest in this comes from the fact that the anisotropy of the model produces a new phase , the so called layer phase , which can serve as a mechanism for gauge field localization on a brane .",
    "we can induce this anisotropy to the gauge coupling using , for example , the randall - sundrum metric background in five dimensions .",
    "the effect of the warp factor from the rs background or a general anti - de - sitter ( @xmath97 ) background on the u(1 ) gauge theory is to provide the gauge theory with a different gauge coupling in the fifth direction(@xcite ) .    in fig .  1 we present the phase diagram of the theory .",
    "it consists of three distinct phases . for large values of @xmath2 and @xmath7",
    "the model lies in a coulomb phase ( @xmath98 ) on the 5-d space .",
    "now , if one keeps @xmath2 constant and bigger than one and at the same time lets decrease @xmath7 , one will eventually come across the new phase , the layer phase ( @xmath99 ) , where the forces in four dimensions will still be coulomb - like but in the fifth dimension the confinement is present .",
    "for small values of @xmath2 and @xmath7 the force is confining in all five directions and the corresponding phase is the strong phase ( @xmath100 ) .",
    "the properties of the three phases can become more transparent in terms of two test charges . in the coulomb phase the force between two heavy charges is 5d coulomb - like , and becomes the exact five dimensional coulomb law in the diagonal line , defined by @xmath101 for which no anisotropy appears ( for a numerical investigation see @xcite ) .",
    "the completely opposite picture emerges in the strong phase .",
    "there the force is confining in all five directions giving infinite energy for the separation of the test charges in any direction .",
    "now , two test charges in the layer phase will experience a coulomb force in the four dimensional layers , with the coupling given by the four - dimensional coupling @xmath2 ; there are strong indications of the similarity with the usual 4d coulomb law ( see @xcite for details ) , while along the fifth direction the test charges will experience a strong force as the corresponding coupling @xmath7 takes small values .",
    "this means that charged particles in the layer phase will mainly run only along a layer since in an attempt to leave the layer in which they belong they will be driven back by a linear potential , analogous to the one responsible for the quark confinement .",
    "this is the mechanism on which the gauge field localization scheme is based .",
    "now we would like to sketch the three phases in terms of the helicity modulus .",
    "in the zero temperature case ( @xmath102 ) we are left with only two possible choices . instead of the eqs .",
    "( 7)-(10 ) we have : @xmath103 @xmath104 the first one , @xmath105 , is used to probe the response of the system to an external flux in the spatial planes ( belonging to a 4d layer ) while the second one , @xmath106 , is used in a similar way for the planes containing the extra , transverse direction . + ( i ) in the strong phase ( keeping @xmath7 constant ) the space - like helicity modulus vanishes ( which is a clear signal of confinement ) ;",
    "as we approach and eventually pass the phase boundary it becomes non - zero in the layer phase with a value that approaches 1 as @xmath2 increases further .",
    "on the other hand , the transverse h.m , @xmath107 , remains zero throughout the transition since both phases exhibit confinement in the fifth direction .",
    "+ ( ii ) for the transition between the 5d coulomb phase and the layer phase , @xmath105 retains a value close to 1 for all values of @xmath7 , since the four dimensional layers experience already a 4d coulomb - like phase , while @xmath107 vanishes for the layer phase ; as the system crosses the critical point and enters the coulomb phase it grows towards 1 as @xmath7 increases further @xcite .      on the axis defined by @xmath8",
    "we consider the four - dimensional u(1 ) model . in this section",
    "our intention is to strengthen the arguments given in references @xcite .",
    "we present numerical results showing that we have a coulomb phase only for t=0 , in accordance with fig .",
    "12 of  @xcite .",
    "our findings contradict the ones of ref .",
    "@xcite that stipulates the existence of a coulomb phase for @xmath3 and @xmath109 .",
    "the numerical results presented below show that we have a spatial confinement phase when the spatial lattice size @xmath30 gets big enough , compared to the temporal size @xmath4 @xmath110 .",
    "this behavior can be understood , following closely the ref .",
    "@xcite , using simple theoretical arguments . in order to have @xmath111",
    ", one must have at least two monopole loops ( far apart ) winding around the time direction with opposite orientations .",
    "a non contractible time - like monopole loop can , in principle , disorder all the spatial planes in the lattice .",
    "the probability to have one such loop passing through a given lattice site is , roughly , @xmath112 , where @xmath113 is the monopole mass .",
    "so the condition to achieve a probability of order 1 for a system to containing one ( or two ) wrapping monopole loops , is : + @xmath114 since @xmath113 is of order @xmath2 . now , starting from the above equation we can make two statements . first , it predicts a pseudocritical coupling @xmath115 which was verified by our measurements and second , that as we go to smaller temperatures ( bigger @xmath4 ) , for sufficiently large @xmath30 eq .",

    "there is a critical vertical line that separates the layer from the 5d coulomb phase .",
    "our intention in this section is to explore the effects of finite temperature on our system and the most important , the feasibility ( if any ) of a layer phase , through the study of the changes in the aforementioned phase line boundaries and the phases themselves . to that end",
    "we move , first , on the line @xmath177 in order to study the strong - layer phase transition at finite t ; we know that for @xmath8 ( subsection 3.2 ) there is phase transition for @xmath178 .",

    "using the results presented in the two following sections we can argue that the layer phase disappears for @xmath15 and becomes a deconfined phase with new properties which will be described below .",
    "we can also generalize the arguments and say that there is no layer phase in finite temperature for any temperature different from zero .",
    "the existence of the layer phase is based strongly on the existence of the coulomb phase for @xmath8 .",
    "however there is no coulomb phase for @xmath8 at @xmath181 as it is argued in ref .",
    "we also confirm this result ( see subsection 3.2 ) .",
    "we begin the investigation of the 5d anisotropic pure u(1 ) gauge model at finite temperature with what used to be called as a 5d strong - layer phase transition at zero temperature ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "we utilize the helicity modulus @xmath182 in order to bring out the features of the transition and compare them with the t=0 and @xmath8 cases . as it is shown in fig .",
    "3 the first deviation from the zero temperature case comes from the fact that now , the transition line boundary between the two phases , is found at a lower value of @xmath183 in contrast with the value of @xmath184 for @xmath1 case .",
    "another observation is that the values obtained here concerning @xmath120 are of the same order of magnitude as the ones , for the @xmath8 case ; the only difference is the slight movement of the critical region to a value between 0.85 and 0.90 .",
    "moving now to a discussion of fig .  7 and the spatial helicity modulus @xmath131 we encounter many similarities with the results of subsection 3.2 : + i ) there is a pseudocritical value @xmath133 for each lattice size , with @xmath135 equal to zero for @xmath185 , signal of spatial confinement .",
    "for @xmath186 the spatial helicity modulus @xmath135 increases with @xmath2 , as one would expect from a coulomb phase .",
    "but the transition point moves to higher and higher values of @xmath2 as the spatial extent of the lattice ( @xmath30 ) grows .",
    "what we see here is only a finite size effect that ceases to exist in the thermodynamic @xmath12 limit .",
    "+ ii ) the magnitude of @xmath131 , calculated on a single 4d layer , decreases with @xmath30 for the same value of @xmath2 for @xmath186 , following the ratio @xmath187 .",
    "so we expect , as in the 4d case for @xmath8 , that the spatial helicity modulus tends to zero for all values of @xmath2 as @xmath12 ( indicating spatial confinement ) ; the phase transition to a coulomb phase disappears together with the layer phase in the infinite volume limit .",
    "we mention also that the spatial - transverse helicity modulus ( @xmath188 ) remains zero throughout the transition .",
    "is strictly zero for each volume @xmath189 until the pseudo - critical value @xmath133 is approached .",
    "for @xmath186 the @xmath135 tends to zero as @xmath190 for constant @xmath2.,width=5,height=8 ]    in fig .",
    "8(a ) we present the temporal helicity modulus @xmath129 ; also , in fig .",
    "8(b ) we present the temporal - transverse helicity modulus @xmath191 versus @xmath2 , for three different volumes .",
    "the two quantities have the same behavior : both take values equal to zero for @xmath192 and non - zero for @xmath193 and they increase with the lattice size @xmath30 , indicating a coulombic behavior in the temporal direction .",
    "we also note that the polyakov loop in the temporal direction , a result not shown here , is zero for @xmath2 smaller than a critical value ( @xmath194 ) and tends to one for @xmath146 .",
    "the transition , for the three quantities @xmath129 , @xmath191 and @xmath116 , concerning the strong confining phase ( @xmath192 ) to the deconfining phase ( @xmath193 ) is a continuous one .",
    "although we do not analyze further the order of this phase transition we may guess that it may not be the case of a first order phase transition .",
    "all of the results obtained so far advocate to the disappearance of the layer phase at finite temperature .",
    "the layer gives its place to a phase showing a confining behavior in the 4d subspaces ( formed by the three spatial coordinates and the transverse one ) and a coulombic behavior along the temporal direction .",
    "as we have seen in the previous sections the system undergoes a continuous phase transition from the strong , confining phase , to a new phase . the transition point for @xmath8",
    "is shown to be @xmath196 and for @xmath177 it is slightly smaller being in the interval @xmath197 region . in order to study the nature and the extent of the new phase , we choose to keep @xmath2 fixed at the value of 1.10 and let @xmath7 to vary . in figs .",
    "9(a ) and 9(b ) we present the spatial helicity modulus @xmath198 and the spatial - transverse helicity modulus @xmath199 for three values of the volume .",
    "the @xmath135 and @xmath200 are zero , within the statistical error , for @xmath7 smaller than 0.445 signaling disordering in the spatial and transverse directions .",
    "this phase is the continuation of the @xmath8 phase to non zero values of @xmath7 .",
    "the 3d u(1 ) theory obtained through dimensional reduction for @xmath8 , is extended ( for @xmath201 ) to a 4d dimensionally reduced u(1 ) theory in the confining phase .",
    "we observe that the layer phase , consisting of a combination of 4d coulomb phase and confinement in the extra dimension , becomes a deconfined phase .",
    "there is a critical region defined in the interval ( @xmath202 ) in which a finite discontinuity in both quantities ( @xmath203 ) is shown up . for @xmath204",
    "the spatial helicity modulus is non zero and almost constant which is a characteristic of a coulomb phase .",
    "the value of @xmath199 increases linearly with @xmath7 , following the lattice weak coupling expansion , approaching @xmath198 as @xmath205 .",
    "the values of @xmath135 and @xmath200 in fig .",
    "9 are divided by @xmath4 and are independent of the spatial lattice size @xmath30 .",
    "the spatial helicity modulus gives the renormalized coupling @xmath206 of the 5d u(1 ) theory in the coulomb phase which is fixed by the value of @xmath179@xcite .",
    "the temporal and the temporal - transverse helicity modulus ( not shown here ) , remain non zero and increase with @xmath7 . also the temporal polyakov loop is non zero which is a signal of a finite temperature phase .    by close inspection of fig .  4 ( @xmath8 ) and fig .  7 ( @xmath177 )",
    ", it becomes obvious that for a constant value of @xmath2 the spatial helicity modulus is non - zero for some of the volumes that we used and it vanishes as the spatial volume increases beyond a definite value . for @xmath179 , for example , the lattice size @xmath143 is enough to show the correct thermodynamic limit behavior .",
    "if we move to larger values of @xmath2 , like @xmath207 , we have to use a spatial size of the order @xmath144 in order to find the correct behavior .",
    "this is beyond our current computer capabilities . in fig .",
    "10 we sketch , roughly , the phase diagram for @xmath15 in the ( @xmath208 ) plane .",
    "there are three phases with different behavior of the observables we used :    1 .",
    "5d confining phase with : @xmath209 , @xmath210 , @xmath211 and @xmath212 2 .",

    "dimensionally reduced 4d confining phase - temporal coulomb @xmath213,@xmath216 , @xmath217 and @xmath218    .",
    "there are three different phases , a 5d confining phase , a 5d coulomb phase in finite temperature and a new one characterized as temporal coulomb-4d confining.,width=6,height=9 ]    from the discussion in section 3.2 for @xmath8 we argue that the critical temperature for the appearance of the phase diagram of fig .",
    "10 it is the zero temperature .",
    "the reason is that the layer phase strongly depends on the existence of the phase transition in the coulomb phase for @xmath8 .",
    "all the results we have presented in section 3.2 for @xmath219 and @xmath8 point to a 3d confining phase , in the infinite volume limit , for @xmath2 larger than a critical value @xmath220 . a coulomb phase does not seem to be the case . from this analysis we conclude that the phase diagram presented in fig .",
    "10 is reproduced for every temperature bigger than zero . especially for @xmath221 and @xmath222",
    "we have a 4d confining - temporal coulombic phase instead of a layer phase .",
    "two charges are not anymore localized ( confined ) on a three dimensional subspace ( brane ) but the temperature gives the possibility of having interactions between the neighbor three dimensional subspaces .",
    "it seems that there are two characteristic correlation lengths in this deconfining phase . the correlation length given by the spatial string tension and a second one characterising the thickness of the brane given by the interaction in the transverse direction and the temperature .",
    "we did not study quantitatively these two correlation lengths at finite temperature but we may easily see from the fig .",
    "6 what happens in two limiting cases .",
    "for @xmath16 ( infinite temperature ) we have a 4d u(1 ) gauge theory in the strong confining phase and the two correlation lengths are indistinguishable and approach each other .",
    "for the zero temperature case on the other hand , there is no spatial string tension ; we get a massless photon on the branes . note that in this case the branes are characterized by zero thickness . in between these two limiting cases",
    "we expect a continuous change in the behavior depending strongly on the temperature .",
    "the extra dimensional models , like the brane models , are well studied mainly in the zero temperature case .",
    "but if we imagine that our brane world is a part of the universe history then a study of the brane models at high temperature is required . in this paper",
    "we tried to do a first approach to this open problem , namely the behavior of brane models in high temperature ( though neglecting the gravity effects ) .",
    "we believe that our toy model of five dimensional u(1 ) anisotropic lattice gauge theory has all the required essential characteristics .",
    "this model has a very rich phase diagram with respect to the temperature ( see the discussion in sections 3 and 4 ) summarized in figures 6 and 10 .",
    "concluding we could note that the layer phase for zero temperature ( with a massless photon on the brane and confinement in the extra dimensions ) gives its place to a deconfined phase at non - zero temperature . in this phase the three spatial dimensions and the transverse one form a 4d subspace with confining properties , while the temporal direction shows a coulombic behavior .",
