    "the first galactic quadrant ( and portions of adjacent quadrants ) was mapped in the optically thinner isotopologue @xmath12 line by the bell laboratories survey @xcite with their 7-m telescope ( @xmath13 resolution ) and the boston university - fcrao galactic ring survey @xcite with the 14-m telescope .",
    "surveys in higher-@xmath14 transitions ( e.g. , @xmath15 by * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) were also made to diagnose the physical conditions of the gas .",
    "these surveys have revealed the basic properties of molecular gas , such as its large - scale distribution in the galaxy @xcite , and the presence of discrete molecular entities , i.e. , giant molecular clouds @xcite .",
    "there were many studies focused on identifying discrete molecular clouds and determining their physical / statistical properties ( e.g. , mass spectrum and the size - linewidth relation : * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and of substructures within them ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite studied the distribution of molecular clouds in the first galactic quadrant .",
    "although the catalogued clouds were distributed rather uniformly in the longitude - velocity ( @xmath16-@xmath17 ) plane , they found that a subset of the clouds , `` warm '' or `` hot '' clouds with high brightness temperatures , followed clear @xmath16-@xmath17 patterns .",
    "the patterns agreed with those traced by regions and were considered as spiral arms .",
    "this might reflect the variation of the characteristics of the clouds affected by the galactic structures .",
    "previous surveys employed sparse spatial sampling and/or low resolution ( on the order of arcminutes ) . recently developed instruments have enabled us to perform nyquist - sampled , high - resolution ( tens of arcseconds ) survey observations over wide fields ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . with the high quality data",
    ", we would like to re - evaluate the picture of molecular content in the galaxy .",
    "in particular , is there a way to study the spatial structures and the properties of the gas without decomposing it into clouds or their substructures , since the decomposition inevitably omits a part of the emission which may be important .    in this paper",
    "we present the results from our observations in the @xmath1 and @xmath2 @xmath3 lines with the nobeyama radio observatory ( nro ) 45-m telescope , proposing an alternative , complementary method to study the spatial structure of the gas at a sub - pc resolution .",
    "the method is based on the histogram of the brightness temperature of the line emission , or the _ brightness distribution function_. we show how we selected the field , at @xmath0 , in section [ sec : field ] . the observations and the data reduction process are described in section [ sec : observations ] . in section [ sec : results ] the velocity channel maps are presented .",

    "we have chosen a field centered at @xmath19 for the following reason .",
    "this longitude is located between the sct tangent ( @xmath20 ) and the sgr tangent ( @xmath21 ) , and therefore it intersects the sgr arm twice .",

    "the clouds at @xmath24 are mostly on the near side , while those at @xmath25 are on the far side .",

    "the ratio between the far and near kinematic distances for the 45- and 60-@xmath30 components are 3.4 and 2.3 , respectively : i.e. , a misidentification of the distance causes an over- or under - estimation of the linear scale of structures of the gas by a factor of a few ( 2.33.4 ) .",

    "the forward spillover and scattering efficiency @xcite at 115 ghz was measured using the moon in november 2003 , @xmath39 .",
    "we used the 25-beam array receiver system ( bears : * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the frontend consists of a @xmath40 focal - plane array of double - sideband ( dsb ) , superconductor - insulator - superconductor ( sis ) mixer receivers with a beam separation of @xmath41 @xcite .",

    "an emission - free reference ( off ) position was taken at @xmath47 for three 20-s on - source integrations .",
    "the total number of observed points was about 13500 , and typical integration time per point was 80 s. we also mapped the same area at a sparse spatial sampling using the wide - band mode to determine the spectral baseline range .    in period 2 , we employed the on - the - fly ( otf ) mapping technique @xcite to map the @xmath1 and @xmath2 lines in a @xmath48 region ( @xmath49 ) .",

    "the sampling interval along the scan rows was set to be @xmath51 , and the separation between the scan rows was @xmath52 .",
    "an off position was observed before every scan , whose duration was typically 40 s. the off position @xmath53 had been confirmed to be emission - free in @xmath18 : i.e. , @xmath54 in @xmath55 , which corresponds to @xmath56 in single sideband ( ssb ) .",
    "scans were made in two orthogonal directions , i.e. , along @xmath16 and @xmath57 , in order to minimize scanning artifact ( systematic errors along the scan direction ) in the data reduction process ( see section [ sec : reduction ] ) .",
    "the pointing of the telescope was calibrated by observing sio @xmath3 maser ( 42.821 and 43.122 ghz ) sources oh39.7 + 1.5 and r aql with another sis receiver at 40-ghz band ( s40 ) every 12 hours .",
    "the pointing accuracy was typically @xmath58 ( period 1 ) and @xmath59 ( period 2 ) .",
    "since bears is a dsb receiver system , we need to correct the observed intensity scale to that of an ssb receiver .",
    "the scaling factors to convert @xmath55 to @xmath60 were derived by observing a calibrator with s100 , the single - beam sis receiver equipped with an ssb filter , and with every beam of bears .",
    "we used the factors provided by the observatory in period 1 , and measured them ourselves by observing w51 in period 2 .",
    "based on multiple measurements , the reproducibility of the factors in period 2 was 4% ( @xmath1 ) and 9% ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "the @xmath61 psw data were reduced with the _ newstar _ reduction package developed at nro @xcite . during the data reduction , it turned out that there was weak emission of @xmath62 and @xmath63 at the off position for the outer 4 receiver beams .",
    "we successfully corrected this error for 3 out of the 4 beams by removing gaussian profiles from the off data . for the remaining 1 beam ,",
    "we could not remove the influence ; therefore we have excluded the beam from the further reduction process . due to an aberration originating in the beam - transfer optics of the telescope ,",
    "the beams of bears were not exactly aligned on a regular @xmath41 grid on the sky .",
    "therefore , after flagging out bad data , the data were resampled onto a @xmath64 grid using a convolution with a gaussian whose full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) was @xmath46 . as a result",
    "the effective spatial resolution became @xmath65 .",
    "linear baselines were fitted and subtracted .",
    "baseline ranges were taken at @xmath66 and @xmath67 , which had been confirmed to be emission - free using the wide - band data .",
    "resultant spectra have typical root - mean - square ( rms ) noise of 0.4 k at a resolution of @xmath68 .",
    "the reduction of the otf data was made with the _ nostar _ reduction package @xcite .",
    "bad data were flagged , and linear ( high - resolution ) or parabolic ( wide - band ) baselines were fitted and subtracted .",
    "the data were mapped onto a square grid of @xmath58 separation by spatial convolution with a gaussian - tapered jinc function @xmath69 $ ] , where @xmath70 is the first - order bessel function , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 is the distance from the grid point to the observed position divided by the grid spacing @xcite . as a result",
    "the effective spatial resolution was @xmath5 .",
    "the scanning artifact was reduced by combining the maps made from the longitudinal and latitudinal scans using the _ plait _ method @xcite .",
    "since the @xmath2 high - resolution data do not cover sufficient emission - free velocity ranges for baseline subtraction , we used the wide - band data as a reference to determine the spectral baseline .",
    "that is , the difference between the high - resolution and wide - band spectra was linearly fitted for each spatial grid , and the regression was added to the high - resolution data .",
    "the final dataset has an rms noise level of 0.18 k ( @xmath1 wide - band ) , 0.074 k ( @xmath2 wide - band ) , and 0.29 k ( @xmath2 high - resolution ) , at a resolution of @xmath74 ( wide - band ) and @xmath75 ( high - resolution ) .",
    "we checked the relative intensity calibration between periods 1 and 2 .",
    "the period 1 map was resampled onto the same grid as the period 2 map , and the correlation of the intensities was examined in the region in which the maps overlap .",
    "the results are consistent and we found the relation @xmath76 for the pixels which were brighter than 1 k in both maps .",
    "the difference of @xmath77 is within the uncertainties of @xmath37 and the scaling factors converting @xmath55 into @xmath60 .",
    "thus we combined the maps from two periods .",
    "hereafter , the line intensities are shown in the main - beam temperature [ @xmath78 scale ( for the @xmath2 data , we adopted the value in period 2 , i.e. , @xmath79 ) .",
    "the @xmath80 is appropriate for the brightness temperature of compact structures , whereas the brightness of spatially extended emission may be overestimated ( appendix [ app : efficiency ] ) .      the @xmath82 data ( sawada et al .",
    "in prep . )",
    "are compared with the @xmath3 lines .",
    "the observations of the @xmath81 line were made with the atacama submillimeter telescope experiment ( aste ) 10-m telescope at pampa la bola , chile @xcite in september 2005 .",
    "the region of @xmath44 , @xmath45 ( a part of the 45-m field of view : see fig .",
    "[ fig : peaktemp ] ) was mapped using the otf technique .",
    "the hpbw and @xmath37 of the telescope were @xmath83 and 0.6 , respectively .",
    "the data were reduced with _",
    "nostar _ and the reduced data cube has an effective resolution of @xmath84 .",
    "details will be described in a forthcoming paper .",

    "figs .  [ fig : chmap12_1 ] and [ fig : chmap13_1 ] show the velocity channel maps of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 lines , respectively , which cover the velocity range @xmath85 with an interval of 5 @xmath86 .",
    "the distribution of the emission in the channel maps significantly changes with the velocity . at the lowest velocity ( 1025 @xmath86 ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : chmap12_1 ] , low brightness @xmath1 emission originating in the solar neighborhood is widespread in the field of view . beyond 25 @xmath86 , the widespread emission vanishes . instead",
    ", bright ( @xmath87 ) and spatially confined structures begin to dominate at @xmath88 .",
    "these structures have sharp boundaries and form clumps ( e.g. , at @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 ) and filaments ( e.g. , at the top of the panel at 47.5 @xmath86 ) . beyond @xmath92 ,",
    "the bright structures become less prominent .",
    "though they remain up to 62.5 @xmath86 ( at the bottom of the panel ) , low brightness extended emission starts to spread over the field . at the tangent velocity ( 7590 @xmath86 ) , the low brightness ( @xmath93 ) emission almost fills the field of view , except a lump of @xmath94 emission at the top - right corner of the field .",
    "the high surface filling factor at the tangent velocity can be attributed partly to the velocity crowding effect ; nevertheless , the lack of bright structures is a distinct difference from the velocity range of 4060 @xmath86 ( section [ subsec : bdf ] ) .",
    "the @xmath2 channel maps ( fig .  [ fig : chmap13_1 ] ) show similar characteristics as those seen in the @xmath1 maps : the bright ( @xmath95 ) , compact structures dominate at 4065 @xmath86 , whereas the emission of 12 k is widespread at 7590 @xmath86 .",
    "the @xmath2 maps have , in general , higher brightness contrast than those of the @xmath1 line , likely due to the lower optical depth",
    ". one of the most extreme cases is the 62.5-@xmath86 channel .",
    "the bright ( @xmath95 ) clumps seen in the @xmath2 map are not very prominent in @xmath1 , implying the gas in the foreground with low excitation temperature obscures the bright @xmath1 line of the clumps .",
    "@xcite compiled catalogues of regions in the first galactic quadrant , and determined the distances to them , resolving the near - far distance ambiguity using the emission / absorption method and the self - absorption method .",
    "their catalog contains 10 regions situated in our field of view ( table [ tab : hii ] ) .",
    "[ fig : hii12 ] and [ fig : hii13 ] show the peak brightness maps around the regions in @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "nine of them are associated with the bright ( @xmath96 in @xmath1 and/or @xmath97 in @xmath2 ) clumps or filaments within a few pc .",
    "in particular , 5 ultracompact regions ( whose names begin with ` u ' ) are all tightly associated with the molecular clumps .",
    "this is consistent with @xcite .",
    "one exception is c37.67@xmath980.13 at the tangent velocity .",
    "the @xmath1 around this object appears weak and extended , probably due to the self - absorption .",
    "the @xmath2 line is rather faint ( @xmath99 ) in comparison with the other regions .",
    "our sufficient ( @xmath100 ) spatial resolution reveals that the spatial structure of molecular gas varies with the radial velocity and thus with respect to the galactic structure .",
    "we classify the structures into the following two components , the _ b component _ and the _ d component_. the b component is bright ( @xmath101 in @xmath1 ; @xmath97 in @xmath2 ) and spatially confined emission .",
    "it appears as clumps and filaments in the channel maps , whose typical size and mass are @xmath102@xmath103 ( 38 pc at 9 kpc ) and @xmath104@xmath105 , respectively .",
    "the d component is diffuse ( i.e. , spatially extended ) and fainter ( @xmath106 in @xmath1 and @xmath107 in @xmath2 ) emission .",
    "the former is seen in the velocity range of @xmath108 , while the latter dominates the solar neighborhood ( 1025 @xmath86 ) and at the tangent velocity ( 7590 @xmath86 ) .",
    "the emission in the range 6065 @xmath86 is in - between  possibly a transition between or the mixture of them .",
    "a number of studies have been performed in order to investigate the distribution and physical conditions of the gas in the milky way galaxy .",
    "most of them started from the decomposition of emission into individual , discrete molecular clouds / clumps and determined their properties ( see section [ sec : introduction ] ) .",
    "for example , @xcite identified 1427 _ clouds _ and 255 _ hot cloud cores _ from the massachusetts - stony brook survey data . among them 19 and 1 are in our field of view , respectively .",
    "their only hot cloud core is at @xmath109 and is a prototype of the b component in our classification . our higher - resolution and nyquist - sampled maps reveal a number of comparable structures ( e.g. , fig .",
    "[ fig : peaktemp ] ) .",
    "we also find a significant extended molecular emission .",
    "the previous studies might have missed a considerable amount of emission because of the cloud identification , i.e. , the assumption that the molecular gas forms discrete objects .",
    "the emission below the cloud boundary threshold can be inevitably excluded from such analyses .",
    "the d component has a typical intensity ( @xmath93 ) comparable to the boundary used by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "thus a significant fraction of emission would have been overlooked in their work . in our data ,",
    "62% and 48% of the @xmath1 emission is below 4 k in the velocity ranges of 4060 and 7590 @xmath86 , respectively .",
    "though the b component emission will easily be identified as clouds / clumps , it only accounts for a small fraction of the total gas mass ( section [ subsec : bdi ] ) . in the following",
    ", we address the characteristics of the gas in a quantitative fashion by using the _ crude _ observed line brightness , rather than extracting clouds .",
    "there is clear variation of spatial structure of the gas with the radial velocity .",
    "here we use histograms of the brightness temperatures , or the _ brightness distribution functions _",
    "( bdfs ) , which visualize the spatial structure of the gas without separating structures into arbitrary clouds .",
    "[ fig : bdf_12 ] and [ fig : bdf_13 ] present the bdfs of @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "the data with the @xmath110 grid are divided into 5-@xmath86 velocity channels , and the number of @xmath16-@xmath57-@xmath17 pixels in each 1 k ( @xmath1 ) and 0.4 k ( @xmath2 ) brightness bin is plotted ( normalized by the total number of pixels in each velocity channel ) . in each panel",
    "the _ brightness distribution index _ is also shown , which we introduce in the following subsection in order to quantify the characteristics of bdf .",
    "the bdf clearly reflects the amount of the two components of molecular gas described above .",
    "the @xmath1 bdf in the @xmath111 channel ( fig .",
    "[ fig : bdf_12 ] ) shows a sharp peak in the 01 k brightness bin .",
    "this corresponds to the fact that a large portion of the field of view is almost emission - free ( fig .",
    "[ fig : chmap12_1 ] ) .",
    "the high - brightness tail represents the b component in the right - hand side of the field ( the most prominent structure is at @xmath112 , @xmath113 ) .",
    "as the velocity goes up to @xmath114 , the high - brightness tail is even more populated , and the peak brightness also increases .",
    "it corresponds to the b component structures in the velocity channel maps , with increased numbers ( i.e. , surface filling factors ) and peak brightness .",
    "the peak of the bdf at @xmath115 is still prominent , reflecting the relatively small surface filling factor of the co emission . at @xmath116 ,",
    "the 0-k peak starts to drop , and another remarkable component , the shoulder at @xmath99 , emerges .",
    "it reflects the d component which fills the bottom half of the field . at @xmath117 , the high - brightness tail truncates , while the 4-k shoulder still exists . at the tangent velocity ( 7590 @xmath86 )",
    ", the 0-k peak is no longer prominent , and the 4-k shoulder turns into a peak .",
    "this transition is obvious in the channel maps , in which d component fills almost the whole field of view . beyond 95 @xmath86 , the 0-k peak reappears since the surface filling factor of the d component decreases .",
    "the bdf , with a 4-k shoulder and truncation toward high brightness , is similar to that at 6575 @xmath86 .",
    "the @xmath2 bdf shows a similar trend  high - brightness ( @xmath95 ) tail at 4065 @xmath86 , truncation beyond 65 @xmath86 , and a shoulder at @xmath118 at the tangent velocity .",
    "the @xmath2 bdf has , in general , a more prominent 0-k peak and sharper truncation toward the high - brightness tail , which come from the higher brightness contrast in the @xmath2 channel maps ( section [ subsec : chmap ] ) .",
    "we suggest that the difference of the bdf between the sgr arm ( @xmath119 ) and the inter - arm region ( @xmath120 ) is due to a change of gas properties .",
    "there are , however , a couple of potential issues that we should consider , which might cause apparent variation between the velocity components : ( a ) distance from us ( i.e. , linear resolution ) , and ( b ) velocity crowding .    in order to test ( a ) , we convolve the maps with a gaussian to degrade the resolution by a factor of 3 ( equivalent to @xmath121 ) and see how the spatial resolution affects the map s appearance and thus the bdf .",
    "the bdfs from the convolved maps ( crosses in figs .",
    "[ fig : bdf_12 ] and [ fig : bdf_13 ] ) confirm the features discussed above .",
    "this implies that a near - far distance ambiguity up to a factor of @xmath122 ( section [ sec : field ] ) does not affect the result .    as for ( b ) , the line - of - sight path length in a 10-@xmath86 bin for the tangent component is @xmath123 times larger than those for the near- and far - side sgr arm ( section [ sec : field ] ) .",
    "this increases the @xmath124-volume filling factor of the emitting region in the tangent component , which may have turned the 4-k shoulder in the @xmath1 bdf into the peak seen at the tangent velocity .",
    "the absence of bright ( @xmath125 ) @xmath1 emission may possibly be attributed to velocity crowding and self - absorption .",
    "however , the optically thin @xmath2 emission also lacks bright ( @xmath95 ) structures at this velocity .",
    "this supports that the bdf in the inter - arm region differs intrinsically from that in the sgr arm .",
    "the bdfs clearly characterize the variation of the spatial structure , showing the bright , compact clumps / filaments and more extended component of molecular gas .",
    "we introduce the _ brightness distribution index _ ( bdi ) to characterize the bdf with one number , which can be correlated with other parameters , such as the physical conditions of the gas and star - forming activity .",
    "the bdi is defined as the flux ratio of the bright emission to the low - brightness emission : @xmath126<t_3}t[i]}{\\sum_{t_0<t[i]<t_1}t[i ] }   \\right ) ,   \\label{eq : bdi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the bdf is denoted as @xmath127 ; @xmath128 , @xmath129 , @xmath130 , and @xmath131 are the brightness thresholds ; and @xmath132 $ ] is the brightness of the @xmath133-th pixel .",
    "we note that the flux is roughly proportional to the mass .",
    "in this paper we adopt @xmath134 for @xmath1 and @xmath135 for @xmath2 .",
    "these thresholds are somewhat arbitrary , but are empirically chosen so that the numerator and the denominator of eq .",
    "( [ eq : bdi ] ) represent the gas of the typical brightness of the b and d components that are evident in the channel maps ( section [ subsec : bdf ] ) , respectively .",
    "the typical molecular gas temperature that is determined in a wider galactic plane @xmath1 survey is @xmath136 k @xcite ; subtracting the cosmic microwave background temperature , the average brightness temperature would be @xmath137 k. our choice of the thresholds represents the brightness appreciably below and above this average over the large area in the galactic plane .",
    "the thresholds for @xmath2 are adjusted correspondingly to pick out the similar regions in the maps ( figs .",
    "[ fig : chmap12_1 ] and [ fig : chmap13_1 ] ) . in the following",

    "the fraction of bright emission varies with velocity .",
    "it is also remarkable that even at the velocities with a high bdi ( i.e. , in spiral arm ) , only a small fraction of the gas is composed in the b component .",
    "that is , despite the highest @xmath1 bdi ( @xmath147 ) at 4550 @xmath86 , the flux of the @xmath148 emission amounts to only one third of the @xmath149 emission , or , 6.6% of the total flux .",

    "the overall characteristics of the @xmath1 brightness and the bdi are similar to those in the whole 45-m field of view ( fig .",
    "[ fig : bdi_prof_12 ] ) .",
    "the @xmath160 is the highest at the radial velocity of 4045 @xmath86 and tends to decrease toward the higher velocity .",
    "it has local peaks at 4045 , 55 , and 85 @xmath86 .",
    "the first two peaks agree with those of the bdi .",
    "if we assume that the brightness peaks at @xmath161 and 63 @xmath86 trace the near- and far - side sgr arm respectively , these bdi and @xmath160 peaks are both offset from the corresponding brightness peaks toward the lower velocity by several @xmath86 ( discussed in section [ subsec : arm ] ) .",

    "the @xmath162 generally correlates with the brightness , and traces the optical depth ( the column density ) of the gas .",

    "the number density of molecular hydrogen [ @xmath173 was assumed to be @xmath174 , @xmath175 , @xmath176 , and @xmath177 @xmath178 . the @xmath179 abundance ratio at a galactocentric distance of 6 kpc was estimated to be 4055 @xcite .",

    "although no tight constraints on the gas density can be given , the possibility of the high ( @xmath183 ) density of the d component is rejected because the observed brightness can not be reproduced even if the surface filling factor is unity .",
    "the region catalog compiled by @xcite contains 10 samples in our field of view ( table [ tab : hii ] : see section [ subsec : chmap ] ) .",
    "the radial velocities of these regions are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : bdi_prof_12_asteregion ] . the ones in the aste field of view",
    "are shown in filled symbols , while the others are open .",
    "eight regions are located at the far side ( circles in fig .",
    "[ fig : bdi_prof_12_asteregion ] , top ) , and they are mostly concentrated at @xmath184 .",
    "this coincides with the velocity range where the bdi and the @xmath160 are high .",
    "these 8 regions at the far side ( @xmath185 ) are most likely associated with the far - side sgr arm ( i.e. , the peak of the brightness at @xmath186 ) .",
    "thus the regions in our line of sight have radial velocities systematically lower than that of the molecular spiral arm .",
    "we note again that the radial velocities of the bdi and @xmath160 peaks are offset from those of the co brightness maxima toward the lower velocity ( section [ subsec : ratio ] ) .",
    "all bdi and @xmath160 peaks and regions are offset in velocity from the spiral arm .",
    "we identified two distinct components of the molecular gas , the b component and the d component , based on high - resolution , wide - field mapping observations of the galactic plane .",
    "the b component emission is prominent at the velocities of the spiral arms , although its flux ( mass ) fraction of the total flux is small .",
    "the d component ( and even fainter emission ) is the majority of the molecular mass , dominating the emission both at the spiral arm and at the inter - arm velocities .",
    "we have introduced the bdf and the bdi to quantify the difference , and demonstrated that the bdi characterizes the structural variation of the gas along the line of sight : i.e. , the bdi is high in the spiral arm velocities and low outside .",
    "the b component emission corresponds to the _ `` warm '' _ or _ `` hot '' _ clouds defined in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "our analysis confirms their results that the _ `` warm '' _ or _ `` hot '' _ clouds are concentrated on the @xmath16-@xmath17 loci of the spiral arms and resolves them as bright clumps and filaments .",
    "the advantages of our study are the following : the high - resolution observations revealed that the d component emission is faint and spatially extended , and therefore was missed in the `` cloud identification '' scheme .",
    "this component consists about half the mass in our field and is quite substantial .",
    "our method is free from the process of cloud identification and takes into account such a component as well as bright and clumpy ( the b component ) emission .",
    "furthermore , the new parameter , bdi , characterizes the gas structure and is directly comparable with other tracers of the spiral arms ( e.g. , regions ) and the physical conditions of the gas ( e.g. , line ratios ) .",
    "extended emission in co @xmath3 has been found in external galaxies , especially in their inter - arm regions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , at their current resolutions even with interferometers ( @xmath187 pc ) , it remains unclear if these components are an ensemble of small unresolved giant molecular clouds or truly - extended emission .",
    "our results are drawn at a very high spatial resolution of @xmath188 pc , and are therefore different from the extragalactic results both qualitatively and quantitatively .",
    "the relation between such small structures and kpc - scale galactic structures that we find in figs .",
    "[ fig : chmap12_1 ] and [ fig : chmap13_1 ] is the new finding .",
    "the atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array will bridge the gap between these studies with its ability to produce high - fidelity images of pc - sized structures over nearby galaxies .",
    "the peaks of the bdi coincide in velocity with the @xmath160 local maxima .",
    "the b component gas , which makes the bdi high , shows a high @xmath160 ratio and is warm , as opposed to the d component gas",
    ". the bdi peaks also coincide with regions , but are offset toward lower velocities from the maxima of the co brightness ( the near- and far - side sgr arm ) .",
    "these results indicate that the distribution of the high - bdi gas and regions is shifted from the molecular spiral arm by several @xmath86 .",
    "the offset in velocity between the high - bdi gas and molecular spiral arm implies that the high - bdi gas is located in the outer ( i.e. , larger galactocentric radius : see fig .",
    "[ fig : lvpunch]b ) side of the spiral arm .",
    "if we assume the 220-@xmath86 flat rotation of the galaxy , the velocity offset ( several @xmath86 ) translates to @xmath189 in space . the corotation radius of spiral arms in the milky way galaxy is likely outside the solar circle . ] .",
    "therefore the gas at a galactocentric radius of 6 kpc revolves faster than the spiral pattern , by @xmath190 .",
    "hence , the gas with high bdi and high @xmath160 and star - forming regions are located on the downstream side of the spiral arm ( co brightness peak ) in our field of view . if we assume a pitch angle of the sgr arm of @xmath191 @xcite , the drift timescale for the offset is @xmath192 .",
    "this is consistent with the timescale found in other galaxies @xcite .",
    "note that the velocity offset may partially be attributed to the effect of radiative transfer ( e.g. , the b component gas in the spiral arm velocity with high @xmath160 may be obscured by the bulk d component gas ) and needs to be verified by using optically thinner lines .",
    "nevertheless , the asymmetry of bdi , @xmath160 , and the distribution of regions with respect to the arm velocities indicates that the trend is real .",
    "we treated the tangent - velocity gas as a prototype of the gas in the inter - arm region .",
    "there are , however , some caveats .",
    "first , this line of sight shows slightly more emission at the tangent velocity compared with the neighboring longitudes ( e.g. , fig .  3 in * ? ? ?",
    "this area is a molecular - rich inter - arm region .",
    "second , the bdi is higher compared with the other velocity ranges corresponding to inter - arm regions : i.e. , between the far - side sgr arm and the tangent velocity ( 7080 @xmath86 ) and the solar neighborhood ( @xmath193 ) .",
    "the emission at the tangent velocity has been proposed , though not proven , as a special structure , a spur that extends from a spiral arm into the inter - arm region ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite found that there was no enhancement of the @xmath194 ratio and deduced a lower gas density than the average over a much larger region .",
    "@xcite performed high - resolution mapping observations of the @xmath7 line in the entire disk of m51 and detected spurs in the inter - arm regions .",
    "the gas at our tangent velocity could be a relatively molecular - rich portion of the inter - arm region . still , the clear difference of gas structure between spiral arms and inter - arm regions is striking .",
    "the richness of molecular gas is not the only determinant of gas structure .",
    "there is a correlation with large galactic structure .",
    "we performed mapping observations of a @xmath4 field on the galactic plane in the @xmath1 and @xmath2 @xmath3 lines .",
    "the high - resolution maps resolve the spatial structure of the emission down to @xmath100 and clearly show its variation with the radial velocity , and therefore , between spiral arm and inter - arm regions .",
    "the bright and spatially confined emission ( b component ) is prominent in the sgr arm , while the fainter , diffuse emission ( d component ) dominates in the inter - arm regions .",
    "we investigated the characteristics of the gas and revealed the followings :    * the typical size and mass of the b component structures are @xmath195 ( 38 pc at 9 kpc ) and @xmath104@xmath105 , respectively ; and it contains only a small fraction of the total gas mass .",
    "the b component exists predominantly in spiral arms .",
    "the d component is widespread and dominant in the inter - arm region .",
    "it also exists in the arm as well .",
    "* the bdfs characterize the variation of the spatial structure of the gas .",
    "we also defined a new parameter , bdi , as the flux ( @xmath196 ) ratio between the b component and d component , in order to characterize the spatial structure . *",
    "high bdi coincides with high @xmath160 .",
    "thus the high bdi component contains warm / hot gas . *",
    "high bdi also coincides with regions .",
    "almost all regions are associated with the b component emission . * the high - bdi gas ( and thus , the high @xmath160 gas and star - forming regions )",
    "is offset from the peak of the line brightness toward lower velocities , i.e. , the downstream side of molecular spiral arms .",
    "this implies that b component ( warm gas ) develops at the downstream side of the spiral arm and forms stars there .",
    "these analyses are based on the pixel - by - pixel brightness distribution and are free from the process of cloud identification .",
    "our method is advantageous in investigating the molecular gas content in the galaxy as a whole , since the majority of the emission in our field of view is found as the diffuse , more extended component ( d component ) , which does not come under the traditional `` cloud '' classification .",

    "although we assumed the structure of the galaxy briefly described in section [ sec : field ] , the precise picture is the topic under debate .",
    "@xcite referred to the sgr and sct arms as `` major '' and `` intermediate '' arms , on the basis of a study of regions .",
    "`` warm '' or `` hot '' molecular clouds follow the @xmath16-@xmath17 loci of the regions in these arms @xcite , as mentioned in section [ sec : introduction ] .",
    "these studies suggested that the sgr arm is a major and prominent arm . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite presented that at the sgr tangent ( @xmath197 ) there is no enhancement in the _ k _ band , as opposed to the sct tangent ( @xmath198 ) , and suggested that the sgr is an interarm or secondary arm structure .",
    "similar results were also achieved from mid - infrared star count @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we regarded the radial velocities at which the total co intensity within the field of view takes its maxima as `` spiral arm '' velocities , and found that they coincide with the _ traditional _ sgr arm velocities ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we then focused on the relationship between the indices of the gas properties ( bdf / bdi , line ratios , and regions ) and the arm velocities .",
    "our study , therefore , relies on the existence of the sgr arm and the assumption that the observed maxima of the total co intensity correspond to the sgr arm , but is independent of the details of the structure of the galaxy ( i.e. , whether the sgr arm is a major or secondary arm , and its exact location in the galaxy ) .",
    "the location ( distance ) of the observed gas content is affected by the near - far distance ambiguity and the deviation from the flat , circular rotation of the galaxy .",
    "the near - far ambiguity was taken into account in the analyses of the bdi and bdf and the difference between the arm and the inter - arm regions was proven to be firm .",
    "the implication that the high - bdi gas and regions are located in the outer side of the spiral arm ( from the fact that they have lower radial velocities than the brightness peak ) is unchanged regardless of the near - far ambiguity , unless the local non - circularity ( streaming motion ) overrides the global trend of the velocity field of the galaxy .",
    "the @xmath80 brightness scale is likely overestimated because the sources are , in general , bigger than the main beam sizes of the telescopes .",
    "in particular , @xmath37 of the 45-m telescope differs significantly from @xmath199 , which means a considerable amount of power comes from the sidelobe . since the emission in the velocity range of 7080 @xmath86 is widespread over the field of view , the coupling efficiency @xmath200 should be close to @xmath199 rather than @xmath37 .",
    "therefore we adopt @xmath201 for this component . on the other hand ,",
    "the high - brightness structures are less affected because of their low surface filling factors .",
    "the typical size of these structures is up to a few arcminutes ( section [ subsec : chmap ] ) .",
    "the 45-m telescope , whose dish consists of 1- to 2-m reflection panels , is considered to have an error patterns of @xmath202 width .",
    "thus a high - brightness structure fills only a small part of the error pattern : we use @xmath37 as the lower limit of @xmath200 .",
    "we consider that the error of the co @xmath81 brightness due to the error pattern of the aste telescope is small compared with that of the @xmath3 , given the high @xmath37 of the telescope .",

    "<S> we classify the molecular gas in the line of sight into two distinct components based on its appearance : the bright and compact _ b component _ and the fainter and diffuse ( i.e. , more extended ) _ d component_. the b component is predominantly seen at the spiral arm velocities , while the d component dominates at the inter - arm velocities and is also found at the spiral arm velocities . </S>",
    "<S> we introduce the _ brightness distribution function _ and the _ brightness distribution index _ ( bdi , which indicates the dominance of the b component ) in order to quantify the map s appearance . </S>",
    "<S> the radial velocities of bdi peaks coincide with those of high @xmath6 intensity ratio ( i.e. , warm gas ) and regions , and tend to be offset from the line brightness peaks at lower velocities ( i.e. , presumably downstream side of the arm ) . </S>",
    "<S> our observations reveal that the gas structure at small scales changes across a spiral arm : bright and spatially confined structures develop in a spiral arm , leading to star formation at downstream side , while extended emission dominates in the inter - arm region . </S>"
